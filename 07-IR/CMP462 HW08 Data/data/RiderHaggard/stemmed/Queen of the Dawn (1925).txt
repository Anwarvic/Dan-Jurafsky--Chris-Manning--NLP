themselv of the wealth of the land at thebe in the south the
descend of the ancient pharaoh still rule precari again
and again attempt to drive out the fierc semit or bedouin king
name the shepherd whose banner flew from the wall of all the
northern citi
thei fail becaus thei were too weak inde the hour of their final
victori wa yet far awai and of it our tale doe not tell
nefra the princess she who wa name the beauti and afterward wa
known as unit of land wa the onli child of on of these theban
antef kheperra born of hi queen rima daughter of ditanah the
king of babylon who had given her to him in marriag to strengthen
him in hi struggl against the shepherd also call the aati or
plaguebear nefra wa the first and onli child of thi marriag
for shortli after she wa born kheperra the king her father with all
the host that he could gather went down nile to fight the aati who
march to meet him from tani and from memphi thei met in a great
battl in which kheperra wa slain and hi armi defeat though not
befor it had slaughter such number of the enemi that abandon
their advanc on thebe the gener of the shepherd return with
the remnant of their troop whenc thei came yet by thi victori
apepi the king of the shepherd becam in fact pharaoh of all egypt
kheperra wa dead leav behind him but on infant girl and so were
number of the great theban lord other of whom hasten to submit
to the ruler of the north
the shepherd peopl too like the egyptian of the south were weari
of war and would not fight again therefor although thei were
defeat no cruelti were inflict upon the follow of kheperra
nor wa great tribut ask of them also thei were allow to worship
their ancient god in peac and thi in the northern as well as the
southern land inde by now although the god of the shepherd wa
baal to whom thei gave the name of set becaus alreadi it wa well
known upon the nile the shepherd king rebuilt the templ of ra and
amen and ptah of isi and of hathor that their forefath had
destroi when first thei invad egypt and themselv made offer
in them acknowledg these divin
onli on thing did apepi demand of the conquer theban name that
rima the queen of dead kheperra and the babe nefra hi daughter and
law heiress of upper egypt should be given up to him hear
which rima hid herself awai with the child as shall be told
now of the birth of nefra the princess there were strang stori it
wa said that after she came into the world a veri fair babe grai
ei lightskin and blackhair and the rite had been
accomplish she wa laid upon her mother bosom when rima had
look upon her and she had been shown to the king her father in a
weak voic for she had suffer much the queen demand to be left
alon so earnestli that the physician and women thought it best to
appear to obei her and withdrew themselv behind certain curtain
that divid the birthchamb from anoth where thei remain
silent
the night had fallen and the birthchamb wa dark for as yet rima
could bear no light near her yet of a sudden on of the women a
priestess of hathor name kemmah who had nurs the king kheperra
from hi birth and now wa to fill that offic to hi child have
remain awak saw a light glow through the curtain and be
frighten peep between them behold in the birthchamb look
down on the queen who seem to be asleep were two royal and
gloriou women or so kemmah swore and believ from whose robe and
bodi flow light and whose ey shone like star queen thei
seem to be no less for there were crown upon their head and thei
glitter with jewel which onli queen could wear moreov on of
them held in her hand the cross of life fashion in gold and the
other a loop sistrum with gem strung on golden wire such as is
us to make music when the priestess walk in process befor the
statu of the god
thi gloriou pair at the sight of whom the knee of the watcher
trembl and the power of speech left her so that she could sai no
word to wake the other bent downfirst she who held the cross of
life and then she who held the sistrumand whisper into the ear of
the sleep queen then she who held the cross of life veri gentli
lift the babe from the mother breast kiss it and laid the
cross upon it lip thi done she gave it to the other goddess who
also kiss it and shook abov it head the sistrum which made a
tinkl music er she laid the infant back upon it mother breast
next instant both were gone and the room that had been fill with
bright grew black with night while the priestess who had seen
be overcom with fear swoon awai until the sun wa risen
nor wa she the first to speak of thi matter which she deem holi
and fear be afraid lest she had but dream or should be held a
teller of tale who took the name of the god in vain yet on the
morrow the queen call for her husband and said that a veri strang
vision had come to her dure the night which she describ in these
word
it seem to me that when weak with pain i had fallen asleep two
gloriou ladi appear to me cloth in the garment and wear the
emblem of goddess of egypt on of these who bore in her hand the
symbol of life spoke to me in my dream sai o daughter of
babylon by marriag queen of egypt and mother of egypt heiress
hear us we ar isi and hathor ancient goddess of egypt as you
know who of late sinc you came to thi land have worship in our
templ and made offer on our altar be not afraid for although
you were bred to the servic of other god we come to bless her who is
born of you know o queen that great troubl await you and bitter
loss that shall leav you desol nor with all our strength can we
save you from these for thei ar written in the book of fate and must
befal nor for a while that to mortal must seem long can we free
egypt from the bond with which the shepherd have bound her as thei
bind the feet of their own sheep for slaughter though the time shall
come when she shall shake them loos like a bull break through it
net and grow greater than ever she ha been as everi live thing
suffer for it sin so must egypt suffer for her sin who ha not
been loyal to herself her faith or the lesson of the past yet in
the end if onli for a while her troubl shall pass like summer
cloud and from behind them shall shine out the bright star of her
glori
now i answer that vision or that goddess sai these ar heavi
word you speak to me o divin ladi with egypt inde i have littl
to do who am but the wife of on of it king a princess sprung from
anoth land egypt must find the fate that she ha shape but as a
woman i would learn that of my lord whom i love and of the child that
ha been given to us
the fate of thi lord of your shall be gloriou answer she who
bore the symbol of lifeand in the end that of your child shall be
happi
then she seem to bend down and to take the babe in her arm and to
kiss it sai the bless of isi the mother be upon thee the
strength of isi be thy strength and the wisdom of isi be thy
guid star fear not be not faintheart o royal child sinc
alwai isi is at thy side and howev great thy danger never shalt
thou come to harm long shall be thy dai and peac at the last and
thou shalt see thy grandchildren plai round thy knee if onli for
a while thou shalt bind togeth that which is divid and thy name
shall be unit of land such ar the gift that isi give to thee
o ladi of egypt
so that goddess spoke hold out the babe in the hollow of her
shine arm to the divin sister who stood at her side she took the
child she too kiss her on the brow and said behold i hathor
goddess of love and beauti bestow upon thee the princess of egypt
all that i have to give beauti exceedingli shalt thou be and
through love thou shalt make smooth the path of million turn
neither to right nor left forget crooked and polici
follow thou hathor star and thine own heart rejoic in hathor
gift and leav all els to heaven that see what thou canst not see
and work to end thou dost not know thu o royal child shalt thou
sow happi upon the earth and beyond the earth garner it harvest
to thy breast
thu in my dream those goddess seem to speak and lo thei were
gone
kheperra the king listen to thi tale and made light of it
a dream inde he said laugh and a happi dream sinc it
prophesi naught but good to thi babe of our who it seem is to be
beauti and wise a veri flower of love and a unit of egypt if
onli for a while what more could we wish for her
ye lord answer rima heavili it prophesi good to the child
but as i fear ill to other
if so what of it wife on crop must fall befor anoth can be
sown and in everi crop there ar weed as well as wheat such is the
law to which all that live must bow nai do not weep over a phantasi
born of pain and dark thei call me i must go for soon the armi
start to fight those shepherd and to conquer them
yet kheperra thought more of thi tale than he chose to sai so much
inde that he went to the high priest of isi and of hathor and
repeat it to them word for word these priest not know what to
believ inquir if ani had seen aught in the birthchamb and thu
came to learn of the vision of the ladi kemmah for to them as her
superior she must tell all
now thei were astonish inde and rejoic becaus thei were sure
that such a wonder had happen as wa not told of in egypt for
gener moreov thei caus the word of the dream and the
vision of kemmah to be written down in full and seal by the queen
and kemmah also by themselv as wit in three differ roll
on of which wa given to the queen to keep for the princess nefra
while the other were hidden awai in the archiv of hathor and isi
yet both thei and the magician whom thei consult were frighten at
that part of the dream which told of great troubl and bitter loss
that were to befal the queen and leav her desol
what loss thei ask could befal her when happi and
prosper were promis to her child save that of the king her
husbandunless inde other children were to be born to her whom
heaven would take awai
still of these terror thei said noth onli let it be known
that isi and hathor had appear and bless the newborn princess of
egypt yet thei were true enough for veri soon king kheperra march
to the war and within two moon came the evil tide that he wa
slain fight gallantli in the van of hi troop and that hi armi
although not crush wa too weak from loss of men and gener to
renew the battl and wa retreat upon thebe
rima the queen heard the tide which inde her heart seem to
have taught her befor thei were spoken when she had listen to
them all she said wa
that ha happen which the great goddess of egypt foretold to me
and so without doubt shall the rest of their word be fulfil in due
season
then accord to the babylonian fashion she withdrew herself to her
chamber with the child and there mourn mani dai for the husband
whom she love see none save the ladi kemmah who tend the babe
at length the armi reach thebe bring with it the bodi of king
kheperra that had been embalm though rude on the field of
battl she caus the wrap to be loos and for the last time
look upon her lord face all shatter and mar with wound
the god have taken him and he di well she said but my heart
tell me that as he ha di in blood in a dai to come so in blood
shall perish that usurp who brought him to hi death
these word were repeat to apepi and caus him to go in fear
through all hi life for hi spirit told him that thei were inspir
by the god of vengeanc as did the magician whom he consult
inde when he rememb that queen rima wa by birth of the royal
babylonian hous he grew more afraid than he had been befor becaus
in hi famili the babylonian to whom onc hi forefath had been
subject were held to be the greatest wizard in the world therefor
he wa not surpris at the tale of the vision of rima which came to
her in the night of the birth of her child though he could not
understand why the goddess of egypt should appear to a babylonian
if babylon and old egypt come togeth what chanc will there be for
us shepherd king who sit astrid of the mouth of nile sure our
state will be as that of the corn between the upper and the nether
millston and we shall be ground to fine flour he said to hi wise
men
those stone grind slowli and after all flour is the bread of
peopl o king answer the chief of them did not the dream of
the wife of dead kheperra tellif report be truethat long year
would go by befor the egyptian shake off our yoke and did it not
sai that thi princess of egypt who ha been born to dead kheperra and
the babylonian should be a unit of land bring hither the
babylonian widow and her daughter the royal princess o king that
these thing mai be accomplish in their season though as yet we
know not how
why should i admit to dwell in my hous on who inspir by the
devil of babylon ha prophesi that i shall die in blood why
should i not rather kill her and be done and her babe with her
ask apepi
becaus o king answer the chief of the wise men the dead ar
stronger than the live and the spirit of thi royal ladi will smite
more shrewdli than can her flesh moreov we think that if the
oracl of those egyptian goddess be true thi child of her cannot
be kill make them captiv o king and hold them fast but do not
leav them at larg to move mighti babylon and the world against you
you ar right said apepi it shall be done let rima the widow of
king kheperra and her daughter nefra princess of upper egypt be
brought to my court even if an armi must be sent to fetch them but
first try to lead them hither by peac word and promis or if
these fail bribe the theban to deliv them into my hand
chapter ii
the messeng
rima the queen heard through her spi that apepi king of the
shepherd purpos to take her and her child and to hold them
captiv have learn that thi wa the truth she summon a
council of such lord as remain in upper egypt and of the high
priest of the god to ask them what she should do
behold she said i am a widow my lord and your fell fight
brave against the north leav hi heir thi royal infant when
it becam known that he wa dead hi armi would fight no more but
fell back on thebe and therefor the shepherd claim the victori
now as i hear thei claim more name that i who wa the wife of
your king and our daughter who is your royal princess should be
deliv up to them sai that if thi is not done an armi shall
be sent to take us what is your mind o lord will you defend us
from apepi or will you not
now some answer on thing and some anoth thei show that the
peopl would fight no more sinc the king of the shepherd offer
them better term than ever thei could hope to win in battl and that
after the sight of so much blood thei long for peac whoever might
be call pharaoh of egypt
i perceiv that i and your princess have naught to hope from you
lord for whom and for whose caus my husband and her father gave hi
life said rima quietli ad but what sai the priest of the
god he worship
now these answer with mani smooth word on declar that the will
of heaven must be obei anoth that perchanc she and the princess
would be safer in the court of king apepi who swore to treat them
both with all honour a third that it might be well if she would
appeal to her mighti father the king of babylon for succour and so
forth
when all had finish rima laugh bitterli and said
i perceiv o priest that the gold thrown by the shepherd king is
so heavi that it can travel mani leagu of air into the treasuri of
your templ let me be plain will you help me and your princess to
escap from bondag or will you not if you will stand by me i will
stand by you to the last and so i swear will my daughter when she
come to the year of knowledg if you reject us then we wash our
hand of you leav you to go your wai while we go our to babylon
or anywher save to a prison in the hous of the shepherd king
where certainli your royal princess would be done to death that egypt
might be left without a law heir now i prai you consult togeth
i withdraw myself that you mai talk freeli but at noon that is
within an hour i will return to you for your answer
then she bow to that compani who bow back to her and went awai
at the appoint time of noon accompani onli by ladi kemmah the
nurs who bore the princess in her arm she return to the council
hall enter it through the side door by which she had depart lo
it wa quit empti the lord and priest had gone everi on of them
now it seem that i am alon said rima the queen well such is
often the lot of the fallen
not altogeth queen answer the ladi kemmah sinc the royal
princess and i ar still the companion of your majesti moreov i
think that in yonder empti chair i see the shape of certain of the
god of egypt who perchanc will prove better councillor than those
who have desert us in the hour of need now let us talk with them in
our heart and learn of their wisdom
so there thei sat awhil gaze at those empti chair and at the
paint pictur of divin upon the wall beyond each of them
put up supplic in her own fashion for help and guidanc at
length the ladi kemmah lift her head and ask
ha light come to you queen
nai answer rima naught but dark thi onli do my god tell
methat if we stai here those fals lord and priest certainli will
seiz us and deliv us into the power of apepi as i think that thei
have been bribe to do have your aught els to sai to you nurs
kemmah
someth ladi it seem to me that the divin queen of heaven
godmoth of thi royal babe isi and hathor whom i serv have been
whisper in my ear fly said the whisper fly fast and far
ay kemmah but whither shall we fly where can the queen of the
south and her babe the royal princess of egypt be hidden awai from
apepi spi certainli not here in the south where be fear or
suborn all would betrai us
nai queen not in the south but in the north where perhap none
would search for us sinc the lion doe not seek for the buck at the
door of it own den hearken queen there is a certain ag holi man
name roi a brother of my grandfath sprung from an old line of
theban king thi greatuncl of mine whom when a girl i knew
well wa inspir by the god and becam the prophet of a secret
brotherhood call the order of the dawn which ha it home by the
pyramid that stand near to memphi there he and hi brotherhood
which is veri power have dwelt these thirti year or more sinc
none now dare to approach those pyramid and least of all ani of the
shepherd becaus thei ar haunt
by whom ask rima
it is said by a spirit that appear as a beauti barebreast
woman though whether she is the ka of on who is buri in the
tomb where my uncl live or a ghost from hell or the shadow of
egypt itself shape like a woman is not known at least becaus of
her no man dare approach those ancient pyramid after night ha
fallen
why not sinc when have men been afraid of beauti unveil
women
becaus queen if ani look upon her loveli he goe mad and
wander off to perish miser in the wilder or perchanc he
follow her up to the crest of on of the pyramid and fall
thenc is crush to powder
an idl tale as i think kemmah but what of it
thi queen that there in those tomb could we come to them we
might dwell safe enough with my uncl the prophet roi no man ha
courag to approach the place save from time to time some young fool
who long to look upon the loveli of the ghost and meet hi
death or have seen her goe thenc a rave madman even the
wildest bedouin of the desert dare not pitch hi tent within a mile or
more of those pyramid while the shepherd king and their subject
hold the place accurs becaus two of their princ have found doom
there nor would thei draw near to it for all the gold in syria also
thei fear the magic of thi brotherhood which is protect by spirit
and have sworn to leav it unharm at least such is the tale that i
have heard though doubtless there is more of it that i have not
heard
here then it seem we might rest in peac said rima with a littl
laugh at ani rate for a while until we found opportun to escap
to babylon where doubtless the king my father would welcom us yet
how can we do so bear a babe with us now when there is war all
along the frontier and none can cross the arabian desert but
kemmah how ar we to know that your uncl would receiv us and if he
will how ar we to reach him
as to the first question queen the answer is easi strang enough
it chanc that onli thi dai i have receiv a messag from the holi
roi the captain of a corn boat sail from memphi to thebe brought
it to me he told me that hi name is tau
what did he sai to you and where did you meet him kemmah
last night queen i could not sleep be full of fear for you and
the babe so i rose befor the dawn and go out i stood on the
privat quai in the palac garden watch the sun rise that i might
make my prayer to ra when he appear in the heaven present as
the mist thin i saw that i wa not alon for quit close to me a
stalwart man who had the air or at least wore the dress of a seafar
wa lean against the trunk of a palm stare at the nile beneath
near to the bank of which wa moor a trade ship he spoke sai
that he wait for the mist to clear and the wind to rise that he
might sail on to the trade quai and there deliv hi cargo i ask
him whenc he came and he answeredfrom memphi of the white wall
have permiss from the governor of thebe and from him of memphi
to trade between the two citi i wish him good fortun and wa
about to leav to make my prayer elsewher tell him my purpos
when he said
nai let us prai togeth for i too whose name is tau am a
worshipp of ra and see the god appear and he made certain sign
to me which i who am a priestess understood
our prayer finish again i prepar to go but he stai me ask
me for new as to the state of thebe and whether it were true that
the queen rima had di of grief becaus of the loss of her husband
kheperra who fell in the battl or as some said had been kill
with her child i answer that these thing were not true word at
which he seem glad for he thank the god and said that without
doubt the princess nefra wa the law heiress of all egypt north
and south togeth i ask him how he knew the name of thi princess
he repli
a learn man told it to me a holi hermit to whom i confess my
sin which ala ar mani who dwell in the wilder nigh to the
great pyramid and among the tomb he told me also that he knew the
name of thi royal child nurs who wa a kinswoman of hi and that
it is kemmah a ladi of high blood ye and he charg me with a
messag for thi ladi kemmah if i could find her in thebe becaus
he said he dare put noth in write
here thi tau the captain of the ship stop and stare at me and
i stare back at him wonder whether he were set ani trap for
my feet
it would be veri danger o tau i said to him if perchanc you
gave thi secret messag to the wrong woman there mai be mani kemmah
in thebe how will you know that you find the right on or that she
whom you ar told is the nurs of the princess is in truth that
nurs
it is not so difficult as it seem ladi as it chanc the holi
hermit gave to me the half of an amulet of lapi lazuli on which is
cut a charm or spell or prayer he said that on thi half the sign
read mai the live ra protect the wearer of thi holi thing at the
last nightfal mai that protect on travel in the boat of ra
and here ladi the write ceas but the holi hermit said that
the ladi kemmah would know the rest and again he look at me
doe it perchanc run i ask and mai thoth find the balanc
even and mai osiri receiv thi protect on at hi tabl to feast
with him etern
ye he said i think that those were the word or someth veri
like them that the holi on repeat to me still i cannot be sure
becaus my memori is bad especi where prayer or write about
the god ar concern sinc you ladi a stranger know the end of
the charm doubtless it is a common on worn by thousand between
thebe and the sea she whom i have to find not onli know the charm
but wear it other half and how to seek her out i cannot think can
you help me ladi
perhap i answer show me thi amulet o tau
he look round him to see that we were alon then he thrust hi
hand into hi garment and from somewher drew out the upper half of a
veri ancient tablet carven over with write that wa fasten about
hi neck by a woven string of woman hair thi tablet wa broken or
sawn asund in the middl not straight across but so as to leav a
jag edg with mani point and hollow i look at it and knew it
at onc sinc year befor roi the hermit and my greatuncl had
given me it counterpart bid me send it to him as a token if ever
i had need of help then from where it hung upon my breast i drew out
that counterpart and set it against the half that tau the sailor held
befor me lo thei fit exactli sinc the stone be veri hard
had worn but littl dure the passag of the year
tau look and nod hi head
strang that i should meet you thu ladi kemmah and quit by
chanceoh quit by chanc still the god know their own busi
so why should we troubl ourselv about such thing yet there might
be anoth half that fit on to thi broken charm that ha been lent
to me so befor we go farther tell me the name of the sender and
where he dwell and aught els that you know about him
hi name is roi i answer who in the world wa known as roi the
king son though that king di long ago and as you have said
yourself he live beneath the shadow of the pyramid for the rest he
is the holi prophet of a great brotherhood ha a long white beard and
hair is veri handsom and pleasantspoken can see in the dark like a
cat becaus he ha dwelt so much among shadow ha knee that ar
hornier than the feet of a desert man becaus of hi continu
kneel in prayer and when he think that he is alon convers
much with hi own doubl the ka that is alwai at hi side or
perchanc with other ghost which tell him everyth that pass in
egypt at least such were hi appear and custom mani year ago
when he gave me thi half of the amulet but what thei ar now i
cannot sai
the descript will serv ladi ye it will serv well enough
though now the holi roi ha lost most of the hair from the top of hi
head and is too thin to be call handsom have someth of the
air of an ancient and halffamish halk yet without doubt we speak
of the same man as the join amulet bear us wit therefor
ladi kemmah whom i have met by chanc ye quit by chanc just by
wait for you where the holi roi told me i should do hearken to my
messag
here queen the manner of thi seaman chang and from be light
and easi like to that of on whose word conceal a jest becam quick
and intent hi pleasant smile face chang also for of a sudden
it seem to grow fierc and eager the face of on who ha great
thing to carri through and whose honour hang upon their do
listen to me nurs of royal on he said the king whom onc you
dandl on your knee li in hi tomb slain by the shepherd spear
would you see her who is sprung from him and the ladi who gave her
birth follow by the same road
your question seem foolish tau see that where thei go i must
accompani them i answer
i know that you would not he went on and not for your own sake
onli yet the danger is great there is a plan to take all three of
you it wa reveal to the holi roi in thi citi dwell traitor who
ar parti to the plot soon tomorrow mayhap or the next dai thei
will come to the queen and tell her that she is in peril and that thei
purpos to hide her awai in some safe place if she is persuad by
them soon she will find that thi safe place is in the prison of
apepi at tani if ever she live to reach themand thendo you
understand or if she is not persuad then thei will drag her awai
by forc with the babe and deliv them up to the shepherd
i nod my head and answer
it would seem that time press what is your plan messeng
thi present i sail on to the citi and there deliv a certain
cargo to merchant who await it also i have passeng on board
travel from siout farmer folk fly from the shepherd there

form ladi kemmah who pass as my sister a fair young woman who
pass as my wife and nurs in her arm a babi girl of some three
month as such at least i shall describ them to the offic on the
quai nor will those two women question my word yet be
changeabl thei will desert me here for other friend and the place
where thei slept will be empti again do you understand ladi
kemmah
i understand that you propos that the queen and i and the babe
should take the place of the three upon your boat if so when and
how
tonight ladi kemmah i am told there is a religi feast in thi
citi in honour of the god of nile to celebr which hundr will
row out upon the river bear lantern and sing hymn to avoid
all these craft i purpos to bring my ship back to thi wharf sinc i
must sail down nile with the south wind that spring up er the dawn
shall i perchanc find two peasant women and a babe wait among
those palm an hour befor the rise of ra
perchanc messeng but tell me if so where would that journei
end
in the shadow of the great pyramid ladi where a certain holi on
await them sinc he sai that although the lodg be poor there
alon thei will be safe
that thought ha come to me also tau yet thi flight is veri
danger and how know i that in it there is not some trap how know
i that you yourself ar not in the pai of the shepherd or in that of
the theban traitor and sent to tempt us to our doom
a wise question he answer you have the messag and you have
the token of the amulet and you have my oath sworn upon the holi name
to break which will consign me everlastingli to hell still a veri
wise question when there is so much at stake and by the god i know
not how to answer it
we stood still awhil stare at each other and my heart wa full
of doubt and fear onc we were in thi man power what might not
befal us or rather what might not befal you o queen and the royal
child sinc it is true queen that for myself i care and care
littl
i know it kemmah belov answer rima but to your tale what
happen
thi queen of a sudden tau the messeng seem to grow uneasi
thi place is quiet and lone he said yet certainli i feel as
though we were be watch
now queen we stood back from the privat quai by the singl palm
that stand in the open place whither we had withdrawn when we began
to talk for there we could not be seen from the river and i knew that
none could overhear us in the hollow to my left stand that old
shrine surmount by the shatter statu of some god which onc it
is said wa the gatewai of a fallen templ the same queen in which
you often sit
i know it well kemmah
thi shrine queen wa still half hidden by the morn mist and
although it wa out of earshot tau gaze at it earnestli as he gaze
the mist depart from it like a lift veil and follow hi
glanc i saw that the shrine wa not empti as i had thought for
there queen kneel in it as though lost in prayer wa an ag

chapter iii
the escap
thei stood in the privat apart of the palac eunuch guard
or were suppos to guard the outer gate for the queen rima wa
still surround by the trap of royalti and at the door of her
chamber stood the giant nubian ru he who had been the bodyserv
of king kheperra he who after slai six of the shepherd with hi
own hand had rescu the bodi of hi master throw it over hi
shoulder and bear it from the battl as a shepherd bear a lamb
the queen rima and the ladi kemmah had examin the garment brought
by tau the messeng and hidden them awai now thei were consult
togeth near to a littl bed on which the infant princess lai
asleep
your plan is veri danger said the queen who wa much disturb
and walk to and fro with her ey fix upon the sleep babe you
ask me to fly to memphi that is to walk into the jaw of the hyena
thi you do becaus a messeng is come from an ag uncl of your
who is a hermit or a high priest or a prophet of some secret sect
and who for aught you know mai have been dead for year and now be
but a bait upon a hook to catch us
there is the cut amulet queen see how well the piec fit and how
that white line in the stone run on from on to the other
doubtless thei fit doubtless thei ar the halv of the same
talisman but such holi thing ar famou and so is their stori
mayhap someon knew that the priest roi had given you on half of thi
charm and took the other from hi bodi or stole it to be us to
deceiv you and to give colour to the offer of a hide place among
the dead who is thi tau of whom you never heard befor how came he
to find you so easili how is it that he can pass in and out of thebe
without question he who come from memphi hold all the thread
of these plot between hi finger if plot there be
i do not know who he is said kemmah i know onli that when these
same doubt cross my mind thi messeng show me the holi roi
himself in proof of the truth of hi messag and that then i
believ
ay kemmah but bethink you ar you not a priestess on soak in
the mysteri and magic of the egyptian from your childhood like to
thi uncl of your befor you did you not see the vision of the
egyptian goddess isi and hathor bless my child which after all
is but an old tale retold of those who spring from the bodi of
king how come it that no on els saw those goddess
how come it that you dream of them o queen ask kemmah drili
a dream is a dream who can give weight to dream that come and go by
thousand flit round our head like gnat in sleep to vanish into
the dark whenc thei rose a dream is a dream and of no account
but a vision seen with the wake ey is anoth matter someth
that spring from madnessor perchanc from truth and now you have
anoth vision that of an old man who if he live at all dwell far
awai and on thi unstabl cloud you ask me to build a hous of hope
and safeti how can i be sure that you ar not mad as inde the wise
men of my countri sai that most of us ar in thi wai or in that you
behold god but ar there ani god and if so why ar the god of
egypt not the same as those of babylon and the god of babylon not
the same as those of tyre if there be god why ar thei all
differ
becaus men ar differ queen and everi nation of them cloth
god in it own garment ay and everi man and woman also
mai be mai be yet a stranger tale and a vision ar poor prop to
lean upon when life and safeti hang in the balanc and with them the
crown of egypt ill not trust myself and the babe to thi man and hi
boat lest soon both of us should sleep at the bottom of the nile or
lie await death in some shepherd dungeon let us bide where we ar
your god can protect us as well here as by the pyramid of memphi
should we live to reach them or if we must go let these god send us
some sign thei have still mani hour in which to travel from their
heaven
thu spoke queen rima wildli in her doubt and despair kemmah listen
and bow her head
let it be as the queen pleas she said if the god desir
doubtless thei will show us a path of escap if thei should not
desir so to do then we can remain here and await their will sinc
the god ar still the god now ladi let us eat and rest but let
us not sleep till that hour is past when we should have embark upon
the ship of tau the messeng
so thei at and afterward take a lamp kemmah walk through the
palac and found it strang silent all seem to have depart as
on weak old slave told her to attend the feast of the god of the
nile and to sail in boat upon the river
such thing would not have been allow to happen in the old dai
he said querul for then who ever heard of a palac be
desert by those who were in attend upon majesti in order that
thei might enjoi themselv elsewher but sinc the good god kheperra
wa kill by those shepherd dog in the battl everyth seem to
have chang nobodi think anyth of servic everybodi think of
himself and what he can get and there is monei go ladi kemmah i
tell you there is monei go oh sit in my corner i have seen
plenti of it be pass from hand to hand where it come from i do
not know i wa even offer some myself what for i do not know but
i refus it for what do i want with monei who am so old and draw my
ration from the store as i have done these fifti year also my
summer and winter garment
kemmah contempl him with her quiet ey then answer

then friend grow strong again even if it be for the last time go
lock those door and gate and shoot those bolt and bring the kei to

those revel who ar absent without leav when thei return and find
that thei cannot get in to sleep off their drink until after the sun
ha risen
ye ye ladi kemmah a veri good trick i will get the kei and go
follow the round as i us to do and shoot the inner bolt that
i name after all the god of the underworld so that i might never
forget the order in which thei came oh i will light my lantern and
go at onc as though i were young again and my wife and littl
children were wait to receiv me at the end of my round
the half of an hour later the old man reappear at the privat
chamber announc that all the gate and door were lock and
that strang enough he had found everi on of them open and the kei

thei forgot that i had their twin he said chuckl also that i
knew how to shoot the inner bolt i whom thei look upon as a silli
old fool onli fit for the embalm bath here ar the kei ladi
kemmah which i shall be glad to be rid of for thei ar a great
weight take them and promis not to tell that it wa i who lock the
door and forc all those idl peopl to sleep out in the cold for
if you do thei will beat me tomorrow now if you had a cup of wine
kemmah fetch drink and gave it to the ag man mix with water
that it might not be too strong for him then while he smack hi
lip refresh by the liquor she bade him go to the littl gatehous
of the privat apart and watch there and if he should see ani
approach the gate to make report to ru who kept guard at the door
which wa at the foot of the eight stair that led to the antechamb
of the apart
thi encourag by the wine and by a sens that onc more he wa
take part in the affair of life though what these might be he did
not understand the old fellow said that he would do and depart to
hi station
then kemmah went and talk earnestli with the giant ru who listen
nod hi head and as he did so girt hi armour of bull hide upon
hi mighti frame moreov he look to see that hi javelin were
loos in their sheath and that the edg of hi great bronz battleax
wa sharp lastli he set lamp in the nich of the wall in such
fashion that if the door were forc their light would fall upon those
come up the stair while he stand at the head of it would
remain in shadow
these thing done kemmah return to the queen who sat brood by
the bed of the child but of them to her she said noth
why do you carri a spear in your hand kemmah ask rima look
up
becaus it make a good staff to lean upon queen and on that at
need mai serv anoth purpos thi place seem veri still and
fate and who know but that in the still we mai hear some god
speak er the dawn tell us whether we should take ship with
tau or bide where we ar

to her brood till at length she sank to sleep
but kemmah did not sleep she wait and watch the curtain that hid
the stair on which ru kept guard at length in the intens silenc of
the night that wa broken onli now and again by the melancholi note of
some dog howl at the moon for all the inhabit of the citi
seem to be absent at the festiv kemmah thought she heard the
sound as of gate or door be shaken by someon try to enter
them rise softli she went to the curtain beyond which ru wa
seat on the topmost stair
did you note anyth she ask
ay ladi he answer men try to enter by the gate but find
them close the old slave report to me that thei were come and
ha fled to hide himself now go up to the top of the littl pylon
abov thi door and tell me if you can see aught
kemmah went climb a narrow stair in the dark and present found
herself on the roof of the pylon some thirti feet abov the ground
where in time of troubl a watchman wa station round it ran a
battlement with open through which arrow could be shot or spear
thrown the moon shone brightli flood the palac garden and the
great citi beyond them with silver light but the nile she could not
see becaus of the roof behind her though she heard the distant
murmur of those who kept festiv upon it water from which thei
would not return until the sun had risen
present in the shadow of on of the great gatewai she saw a group
of men stand and as it seem to her take counsel togeth
thei move out of the shadow and she count them thei were eight in
all arm everi on of them for the light shone upon their spear
thei came to some decis for thei began to walk across the open
court toward the privat door of the royal apart kemmah ran

more than crown
nai ru set it on my head for thu peasant bear their burden i
can hold it with my left hand and clasp the child with my right
he did so and lift the queen in hi great arm
thu thei pass down the stair step over the dead and out into
the night
across the open space thei went head for the palm tree of the
garden the babe wail feebli but kemmah stifl it cri beneath
her cloak the weight of the treasur in the sack press her down
and the sharp edg of the jewel crown and sceptr cut into her

three minut later that ship wa glide down the nile befor the
strong south wind nor wa it too soon for as thei pass silent
into the night thei caught sight of men some of whom bore lantern

chapter iv
the templ of the sphinx
for dai after dai the ship of tau journei on down nile at night or
when the wind would not serv it wa ti up to the bank alwai in
as uninhabit a place as might be but never near a town twice thi
happen in the neighbourhood of great templ that had been wreck
by the shepherd in the first furi of their invas and not as yet
repair yet after it wa dark out of these desol fane or of
the sepulchr around them issu men who brought food and other
thing to sell but who from the sign that thei made kemmah be
initi well knew to be priest though of what faith she did not
know these men would talk with tau apart show him much rever
then on thi pretext or on that he would bring them into the cabin
where the infant princess lai asleep whom thei would look upon
fearfulli and even ador upon their bend knee as though she were
divin then rise depart bless her in the name of the god thei
worship moreov never did thei seem to take payment for the food
thei brought
all of these thing kemmah note as did ru although he appear so
simpl but of them rima the queen took but littl heed ever sinc
her lord the pharaoh kheperra had been slain in the battl her spirit
had left her and the discoveri of the treason of the lord who had
been hi counsellor and gener whereof ru had slain six and kemmah
on in the fight upon the stair of the theban palac seem to have
crush her veri soul so that now she care for noth save to nurs
her child
when she woke from her swoon to find herself upon the ship she ask
few question and from ru she shrank although she love him well
sai that he smelt of blood nor would she speak much to tau
becaus as she declar she trust no man ani more to kemmah onli
did she talk freeli at time and then mostli as to how she might
escap out of thi accurs egypt with her child back to her royal
father the king of babylon
so far the god of egypt have not serv you so ill queen said the
ladi kemmah see that thei brought you and that royal oneand
she wave her hand toward the babeout of the net of traitor and
when escap seem imposs safe on to thi ship do thi after
you had declar that you had no faith in them
mayhap kemmah yet those god decre that my royal husband should
be kill and that those whom he and i trust should prove themselv
the foulest of all men who sought to betrai hi wife and child into
the hand of enemi whenc we were save onli by your wit and the
strength and courag of an ethiopian also it is not for me a
stranger that thei work but for egypt royal seed that wa born of
my bodi nor is thi to be wonder at see although as pharaoh
wife i made offer upon their altar thei ar no god of mine i
tell you that i would get me back to babylon and er i die bow my knee
again in the templ of my forefath take me back to babylon
kemmah where men ar not traitor to the bread thei eat and do not
strive to sell the seed of those who di for them into captiv or
death
thi i will do if i mai answer kemmah but ala babylon is far
off and all the land between ar ablaz with war therefor take
heart queen and wait with patienc
i have no heart left answer rima who desir but on thingto
find my lord again whether he sit at the tabl of your osiri or
ride the cloud with bel or sleep in the deep dark where he
is there would i be and nowher els and least of all in thi
accurs egypt give me my child to nurs that i mai hold her while i
mai we love that most that we must leav the soonest kemmah
then kemmah gave her the babe and turn awai to hide her tear sinc
she wa sure that sorrow wa eat out the life of thi bereav
widow and daughter of king
onc when thei were off memphi which thei strove to pass at earli
dawn befor men were abroad there wa danger offic came to their
ship from a boat bid it lie to a command that tau thought it
best to obei
now plai your part well he said to kemmah rememb that you

to forget her woe and be as crafti as a serpent as for you ru hide
that great ax of your though where you can find it easili
rememb that you ar a slave whom i bought for a great sum in
thebe that i mai make monei by show off your strength in market
place and that you can talk littl or no egyptian
the boat came alongsid in it were two offic young men who seem

just then the lantern went out and tau began to talk of find oil to
relight it
it is needless friend said the chief offic i think that we
have seen enough pursu your voyag in peac and sell the calv at
the best price you can get
then he turn to the deck where as ill luck would have it he caught
sight of ru squat on the board and try to look as small as he
could
that is a big black man he said now did not some spy send a
messag about a negro who kill mani of our friend up yonder stand
up fellow
tau translat or seem to do so and ru stood up roll hi big
ey till the white show and grin all over a silli face

arm now captain who is thi giant and what ar you do with him
on board your trade boat

most of my save he is mighti and perform feat of strength for
the sight of which i hope to get much monei down in tani
doe he said the offic much interest but with suspicion
well fellow perform a feat of strength
ru shook hi head vagu
he doe not understand your tongu sir who is an ethiopian stai i
will tell him
then he began to address ru in unknown word ru woke up and nod
grin next instant he sprang at the two offic seiz on of
them with either hand by the neckband of their garment and lift
them from the deck as though thei had been infant next roar with
laughter he step to the side of the ship and held them out over
the nile as though he were about to drop them into the water the
offic shout tau swore and tri to drag him back yell order
into hi ear ru turn round astonish still hold the two men in
the air befor him and look at the belli of the ship as though he
meant to throw them into it
at length he seem to understand and drop them to the deck on
which thei fell flat
that is on of hi favourit trick sir said tau as he help
them to their feet he is so strong that he can carri a third man in
hi teeth
is it said an offic well we have had enough of your savag and
hi trick who i think will land you in prison befor you have done
with him keep him off now while we get into the boat
thu wa the ship of tau search by the offic of apepi
when the boat had gone and onc more the ship wa slip past the
quai of memphi unobserv in the mist drawn by the rise sun from
the river ru came near to the tiller and said
i think lord tau for a lord or count i hold you to be although it
pleas you to pass as the owner of a small trade boat that you
would have done well to let me drop those two fine fellow into the
nile that tell no stori of those it buri by and by it will be
found that there is no warship such as you talk of so wonderfulli
and then
and then breaker of bone it mai go hard with those offic who
chatter of such a ship like finch in the reed and while thei did
so let the real prize slip through their finger for thi inde i
am sorri sinc those young men were not bad fellow in their wai as
for drop them into the nile it might have been well enough
though cruel had there not been a wit what would that boatman
who row them to the ship have report when he found that thei
return from it no more
you ar clever said ru admiringli i never thought of that
no ru if my brain were ad to your brute strength and
uninstruct honesti why you would rule the world of brute but
thei ar not and therefor you must be content to serv in the yoke
like a bull which is as strong as you ar or stronger
if it is brain that make a differ why do you not rule lord
tau who ar also a like man though not so big as i am why ar you
carri fugit upon a dirti littl merchant ship instead of
sit upon a pharaoh throne tell me who am but a simpl black
man bred to war and honesti
tau with much skill steer hi ship through a fleet of barg pole
up nile laden with fodder then call to a sailor to take hi place
for now the river wa open with no craft in sight he sat himself down
in the low bulwark and answer
becaus mayhap friend ru i also choos to serv be stupid like
most honest men especi if thei ar strong and on of a simpl
race that understand noth except love from which is born mankind
and war that keep down it number you mai not believ me when i
tell you that the onli true joi in life li in servic of thi sort
or of that pharaoh ar serv which is why thei ar often so blind
and so satisfi at be but vain bubbl blown along by a wind thei
cannot see spring although thei know it not from the poison
breath of multitud for the most part thei do more harm than good
and ar themselv the slave of slave with him who serv it is
otherwis for set asid selfseek and ambit he work
humbl for that which is good and in thi work find hi reward
ru rub hi brow then ask
but whom doe such an on serv lord
he serv god ru
god there ar mani god that i have heard of in ethiopia in egypt
and in other land what god doe he serv and where doe he find that
god
he find him in hi own heart ru but what hi name mai be i cannot
tell you some call it justic some call it freedom some call it
hope some call it spirit
and what do those call it who serv onli themselv and their own
lust careless of all those fine thing lord
i do not know ru and yet i know that name it is death
yet thei live as long as other men lord and often reap a finer
harvest
ay ru but veri soon their dai is done and then if thei have not
repent their soul die
so you believ that soul can live on as the priest seem to teach
ye ru i believ that thei can live longer than ra the sun himself
longer than the star and from ag to ag reap the fruit of honest
servic yet of these matter do not ask me but ask on whom you will
soon meet and whose discipl i am
i dont wish to lord see that my brain swim alreadi but tell
me if it pleas you to what end is all thi servic of your that
caus you to sail up nile and at great risk to rescu certain ladi
and a certain babe
i am not sure for true servic is it own end moreov it is not
for me to ask of end who am sworn to obei without doubt or
question
so you also have a master lord who is he
that you will learn er long ru yet do not think to look upon some
king or enthron high priest surround with pomp and ceremoni
ru i will instruct you who ar so ignor doubtless you believ
that egypt and the world ar rule by the strength you see by
pharaoh by armi and by wealth yet it is not so there is anoth
strength you do not see which is it guid and conqueror and it name
is spirit the priest teach that to everi man there is given a ka
or a doubl an invis someth that is stronger purer more
endur than he is someth that perhap from time to time look
upon the face of god and whisper of god will now if thi be a
parabl yet in a sens it is true sinc alwai such a spirit is at
the elbow of everyon who live or rather there ar two spirit on
of good and on of evil on that lead upward and on that lead
downward
i sai again that you make my head swim lord but tell me where and
to what is your spirit lead you
toward the gate of peac ru peac for myself and peac for egypt
toward a land where you would find littl occup for in it there
is no war look yonder ar the great pyramid the home of the dead
and mayhap of their soul which do not die come help me lower the
sail sinc we must drift past them slowli to return when night ha
fallen and land certain passeng there perhap ru you will learn
more of the mean of all thi talk of mine
night had come at it approach he who wa call tau had row hi
ship back to a certain land place which now at the time of the
rise nile wa not so veri far awai from the great pyramid and the
sphinx that sit near to them stare etern into nothing here
thei disembark all of them under shelter of the dark and of a
bed of reed
scarc were thei on shore when thei saw boat which great lantern
hung at their prow and stern show to be full of arm men row
down nile tau watch them go by and said
i think some messeng ha told those offic at memphi that there
wa no warship follow us from thebe and that now thei search for a
certain trade boat on which travel two women and a babe well
let them search for the bird ar out of their hand and where thei
nest no shepherd will dare to come
then have given direct to the mate of the boat a veri quiet
secretfac man as were all those on board of her he took rima the
queen by the hand and led her into the dark be follow by
kemmah who bore the child and by ru the ethiopian who carri upon
hi shoulder the sack that contain the jewel of the pharaoh of
upper egypt
for a long while thei trudg forward first between grove of palm
tree and then over desert sand till at length the wane moon rose
and thei saw a wondrou sight in front of them appear the enorm
shape of a lion cut from the live rock whose face wa not that of a
beast but of a man wear the headdress of a god or king and
stare toward the east with solemn terrifi ey
what is that ask rima faintli have we reach the underworld
and is thi it god for sure yonder dread smile counten
must be that of a god
nai ladi answer tau it is but the symbol of a god the sphinx
which ha sat here for countless ag look behind it stand the
pyramid outlin against the sky and beneath it ar safeti and rest
for you and for your child
safeti for the child perhap she said and for me as i think
the longest rest of all for know o tau that death look at me out
of those solemn smile ey
tau made no answer inde even hi calm spirit seem to be
frighten at those word of evil omen as wa kemmah who mutter
we go to dwell among sepulchr and it is as well for i think that
soon thei will be need
even ru wa frighten though more by the gigant figur of the
sphinx tower abov him than by the queen word which he scarc
seem to understand
here is that which turn my heart to water and loosen my knee he
said in hi savag imageri here is that with which no man not even
i can fight and therefor for the first time i am afraid here is
fate itself and what can man do in the face of fate
obei it decre as all must answer tau solemnli forward now
for the templ of thi god is open and leav the restto fate
thei came to some step about fifti pace from the outstretch paw
of thi mighti monument and descend them found themselv face
what seem to be a huge granit block in a wall take a stone which
lai at hand tau knock upon thi block in a peculiar fashion thrice
did he repeat thi rhythmic seri of blow each time with some
differ then he wait and behold present in a silent fashion
the great stone turn leav a narrow open through which he
beckon them to follow him thei enter to find themselv in dens
dark and to hear sound as of password be given and receiv
next lamp appear float toward them through the dark and
thei perceiv that these were born by men cloth as whiterob
priest who yet carri sword like soldier and wore knive thrust
through their girdl there were six of these priest and a seventh
who appear to be a leader of them for he walk ahead to thi man
tau spoke sai
i bring you that i went forth to seek and he point to the royal
child sleep in the arm of kemmah and to the queen and behind her
to the gigant ru on whom the priest look doubtfulli

it is needless the holi prophet ha spoken to me of him yet let him
understand that he who reveal the secret of thi place di
terribl

buri
then on by on the priest made obeis to the babe and thi done
motion to them to follow
on thei went down a long passag that seem to be built of block of
alabast till thei came to a great hall of which the roof wa
support by huge column of granit in which hall sat solemn statu

vision of whiterob men and women who from time to time gather in
these place and sang sad and mellow chant of which the echo
haunt her sleep from year to year also there wa the state shape
of the ladi kemmah her nurs whom she love well yet fear a littl
and that of the gigant ethiopian name ru who alwai seem to be
about her dai and night carri a great bronz ax in hi hand whom
she love entir and fear not at all
foremost among them too wa the aw apparit of an ag man with
a white beard and black flash ey whom she came to know as the
prophet and whom all worship as though he were a god she
rememb wake up at night and see him bend over her a
lantern in hi hand or in the daytim meet her in the dark templ
passag and pass by with word of bless to her childish
imagin inde he wa not human but a ghost to be fled from yet
a kindli ghost withal sinc sometim he gave her delici
sweetmeat or even flower that a brother carri in a basket
infanc pass by and there came childhood still the same hall were
about her peopl by the same folk but now at time with kemmah
her nurs and guard by the giant ru and other she wa allow to
wander outsid of them most frequent after night had fallen and
when the full moon shone in the sky thu it wa that first she came
to know the lion shape of the terribl sphinx ly crouch upon the
desert in the begin she wa afraid of thi stone creatur with
it human face paint red it royal headdress and it beard chin
though afterward when it grew familiar to her she learn to love
that face find someth friendli in it smile and it great calm
ey that stare at the sky as though thei would search out it
secret inde at time she would sit on the sand send kemmah
and ru to a littl distanc and tell it her childish troubl and ask
it question furnish the answer for herself sinc from the great
lip of the sphinx none ever came
then beyond the sphinx rose the mighti pyramid three princip on
that pierc the veri sky with templ at the base of them wherein
dead king had onc been worship and other that were smaller
which she fanci must be their children she worship those
pyramid believ that the god had made them till tau her tutor
told her that thei were built by men to be the grave of king
thei must have been great king that had such grave i should like
to look on them
perhap you will some dai answer tau who wa a most learn man
and her instructor in mani thing
besid herself there were other children of the order born of the
wed brother and sister these were form into a school nefra
among them which school wa taught by the instruct among the
brotherhood inde nearli all of them had learn for the full
member of the order of the dawn were no common folk although their
servant and those who till the flat land not far from the sphinx
have their habit upon the border of the great necropoli
were or seem to be like ani other husbandmen to look on them
none would have known that thei were partak in mysteri which thei
were sworn by solemn oath not to reveal and inde never did reveal
even under the fear of death or tortur
soon nefra becam the head of thi school not becaus of her rank but
for the reason that she wa by far the cleverest of all it pupil
and her quick mind drank up knowledg as a dry fleec of wool drink
up the dew yet if ani visit that school and watch the children
listen to the teacher or seat on their stool copi the
picturewrit of the egyptian upon potsherd or fragment of
papyru save that she sat at the head of a line of them and for
someth differ in her face thei would have found noth to
distinguish her from the other littl maiden who were her companion
she wore the same plain robe of white the same simpl sandal to
protect her feet from stone and scorpion while her hair wa ti
with a stem of dri grass into a singl tress after just the same
fashion inde it wa a rule of the order that she should carri on
her person no robe or ornament which might reveal that she wa not as
other children were
yet the instruct of nefra did not end with her lesson in thi
school for when these were done or in time of holidai she must learn
a deeper lore tau accompani by kemmah her nurs would take her to
a littl privat room that onc had been the sleep place of a
priest of the templ in ancient dai and there teach her mani secret
thing
thu he taught her the babylonian tongu and write or knowledg of
the movement of the star and planet or the mysteri of religion
show her that all the god of all the priest were but symbol of
the attribut of an unseen power a spirit that rule everyth and
wa everywher even in her own heart he taught her that the flesh
wa but the earthli cover of the soul and that between flesh and
soul there reign etern war he taught her that she live here upon
the earth to fulfil the purpos of thi almighti spirit that creat
her to whom in a dai to come she must return perchanc to be sent
out again to thi or other world though what those purpos might be
were not known even by the wisest men who breath and while he
taught thu and she listen watch him with eager ey sometim
the old prophet roi would steal into the chamber and listen also
ad a word here or there then hold out hi hand in bless and
steal awai
thu though outwardli nefra wa as ar other merri children inwardli
her soul open like a lotu lili in the sun and she wa differ
from them all
so the year went on till from a child she grew into a maiden tall
and sweet and veri fair it wa at thi time in her life that roi
himself and tau in the presenc of kemmah onli reveal to her who
she wa name none other than the royal princess of egypt by right
of blood and the appoint of heaven and told her the stori of her
father and her mother and of the king and queen who went befor
them also of the divis in the land
when she heard these thing nefra wept and trembl
ala that it should be so she said for now no longer can i be
happi tell me holi father whom men name homeofspirit that thei
sai hold convers with you in your sleep what can a poor maid do to
right so mani wrong and to bring peac where there is but bitter
and bloodsh
princess of egypt said roi for the first time give her her
titl i do not know becaus it is not reveal to me or to ani yet
it is reveal to me and to certain other that in some wai unforeseen
you will do these thing ay and it wa reveal in a dream to your
mother the queen rima when you were born for in thi dream that
part of the univers spirit whom here in egypt we know as mother isi
appear to her and amongst other gift gave to you the royal child
the high name of unit of land
here kemmah thought to herself that anoth goddess appear as well
as isi and gave to thi same child differ gift and though she
said noth roi seem to read her thought for he went on
as to thi dream and certain mysteri by which it wa accompani
the ladi kemmah your nurs and instructress is command to inform
you also to show to you the record of all these matter which at that
time wa written down and seal and with it anoth record of a
certain oath which i and other swore to your mother the queen rima
upon her deathb concern a journei which you must make at the
appoint time enough of these matter now i am command to tell
you that on a dai to come which shall be declar when it is known to
me it is our purpos with such state as we can compass to crown you
stand as you do on the threshold of womanhood as queen of egypt
how can that be ask nefra king and queen ar crown in
templ or so i have been taught and in the presenc of multitud
of courtier with pomp and shout but here and she look
about her
is not thi a templ and on of the most ancient and holiest in
egypt nefra ask roi and for the rest listen we seem to be but
a humbl brotherhood the inhabit of tomb and pyramid which few
dare approach becaus thei hold them haunt and deadli to the life
and soul of ani stranger who dare to violat their sanctuari yet i
tell you that thi order of the dawn is more power and more far
reach than the shepherd king himself and all those that cling to
him as you will learn shortli when you ar sworn of it it discipl
ar everywher from the cataract of the nile down to the sea ay
and in land beyond the sea and as we believ in heaven abov and
on and all thei obei the command that issu from these catacomb
accept them as the voic of god
then if so holi prophet why do you not sit at tani openli instead
of in secret in these tomb
becaus princess visibl power and the trap of power can onli
be won by war and we ar sworn to wage no war we whose empir is of
the spirit it mai be that in the end it is decre that war must be
wage and that thu all will be accomplish yet it is not our
brotherhood that will lift it banner or save in selfdef bring
men to their death for we ar sworn to peac and gentl
i rejoic to hear it said nefra and now master i prai you let
me go to rest for i am overwhelm
a year or more after thi dai of the reveal of secret but befor
the ceremoni which it foretold a terribl thing happen to nefra
now it wa her custom to wander about the great graveyard that
surround the pyramid where in their splendid tomb so mani of the
ancient nobl and princ of egypt had been laid to rest a thousand
year or more befor her dai so long ago inde that none rememb
the name of those who slept beneath these monument on these
wander of her it wa her pleasur to go unaccompani save by her
bodyserv ru for kemmah who now grew ag had no strength for
such rough journei over tumbl stone and through deep sand
moreov at thi time nefra love to be alon that she might find
time to think in solitud over all that had been reveal to her as to
her histori and fate and the unsought great that had been thrust
upon her
further be veri vigor in bodi as she wa in mind she weari
of be coop up in the narrow precinct of the templ and it
neighbourhood and long for exercis and adventur by natur she wa
a climber on of those who love to scale height and thenc look down
upon the world below thu it becam her pleasur to scrambl to the
top of great monument and even of some of the smaller pyramid which
she found she could do with eas sinc her feet were sure and no
dizzi ever overtook her
all of these fanci of her were report to kemmah by ru and other
who watch her and to roi and tau by kemmah when she found that the
young princess would not listen to her chide but for the first
time in her life turn upon her angrili remind her that she wa
no more a child to be led by the hand and would have her wai
these consult of the matter and it would seem accord to their
rule made divin take counsel of that spirit who as thei
declar guid them in all thing
the end of it wa that the prophet roi bade hi greatniec the ladi
kemmah to troubl the princess no more about thi busi but to
suffer her to walk where it pleas her and to climb what she would
becaus it wa reveal to him that whoever took harm she would take
none
it is not wise to thwart her as to such a littl thing niec he
went on see that there is no danger to her and none of the
shepherd or other enemi dare to approach thi haunt place also
she goe forth guard by ru to talk not with ani man but onli with
her own heart amid the holi compani of the dead
there ar alwai some who will dare that of which all other ar
afraid and who know whom she mai meet and talk with befor all is
done answer kemmah
i have spoken niec withdraw said roi
so have triumph nefra who wa young and headstrong continu
her wander and inde did more
now there wa a famili of arab blood among those who serv and were
sworn to the brotherhood of the dawn who from gener to
gener had been climber of the pyramid these men alon by
follow certain crack in their marbl case and cling to knob
or hollow that had been worn in them by the blow of sand dure
hundr or thousand of year had the art and courag to come to the
crest of everi on of them nor until thei had done so were thei
count fit to take a wife with the sheik of these men nefra often
talk and for her pleasur at differ time he and hi son scale
everi on of the pyramid befor her ey return safe from their
dizzi journei to her side
why cannot i do as you do she ask of thi sheik at length i am
light and surefoot and my head doe not swim upon a height also i
have limb as long as your
the captain of the pyramid for so he wa commonli call look at
her astonish and shook hi head
it is imposs he said no woman ha ever climb those stone
mountain that is except the spirit of the pyramid herself
who is the spirit of the pyramid
ladi we know not he answer we never ask her and when we see
her in the full moon upon her journei we veil our face
why do you veil your face captain
becaus if we did not we should go mad as men have done who look
into her ey
why do thei go mad
becaus too much beauti breed mad as perchanc you mai find out
on dai ladi he answer word that brought the colour to nefra
brow
who and what is thi spirit she continu hastili and what doe
she do
we ar not certain but the stori tell that long long ago there wa
a maiden queen of thi land who would not marri becaus she love some
man of a humbl station now it came about that stranger invad
egypt which wa weak and divid and conquer then the king of the
stranger see the beauti of thi queen and that he might build hi
throne upon a sure foundat wish to take her to wife even by
forc but she fled from him and in her despair climb the greatest
of the pyramid he follow after her reach it crest she hurl
herself thenc and wa crush see which faint took hold of
the king so that he too fell to the ground and di after thi
thei buri both of them in a secret chamber of on of the pyramid
which is not known but i think it must have been the second sinc
there the spirit is most often seen
a pretti tale said nefra but is that the end of it
not quit ladi sinc to it hang a propheci it is that when
anoth king follow anoth queen of egypt up the pyramid whenc thi
on fell whichev it mai have been and there win her love the
aveng spirit of her who threw herself thenc will find rest and no
more bring destruct upon men
i would see thi spirit said nefra as i am a woman she cannot
make me mad
nor be a woman ladi do i think that she will appear to you
nevertheless it mai be her pleasur to possess your soul for her own
purpos he ad thoughtfulli
my soul is my own and no on shall possess it answer nefra in
anger nor inde do i believ that there is such a spirit who think
that what you and other foolish men have seen wa noth but a moon
cast shadow travel among the grave so tell me no more such idl
tale
there ar on or two mad fellow live among the tomb who know more
of that mooncast shadow than i do ladi still it mai be as you sai
repli the sheik bow courteous after the ancient fashion of the
east to a superior ye mayb you ar right have it as you will
and he turn to go
stai said nefra it is my wish that you who have more skill and
knowledg of them than ani other man should teach me to climb those
pyramid let us begin upon the third which is the smallest and at
onc the other we can conquer afterward when i am more accustom
to the work
now the man stare at her and began to protest
have you not the command of the holi prophet roi and of the council
of the order to obei me in all thing ask nefra present
that is so ladi though why we should obei you i do not know
nor do i quit captain see that you can climb pyramid and i
cannot and you ar therefor greater than i still there ar the
order and you know what happen to those who break the command of
the council now let us begin
the sheik reason and prai and almost wept but all that happen
wa that nefra exclaim at last
if you ar afraid to go up that pyramid i will go by myself then
you know i mai fall
so the end of it wa that the afflict sheik summon hi son a
lissom youth who could climb like a goat bid him bring with him a
long rope made of twist palm fibr which rope he fasten round
nefra slender waist but now there wa more troubl for ru who had
been listen to all thi talk amaz ask him what he wa do
bind hi ladi like a slave
the sheik explain while nefra nod assent
but it cannot be said ru my duti is to accompani thi nobl on
everywher
then friend ru said nefra accompani me up the pyramid
up the pyramid said ru puf out hi cheek look at me i prai
you mistress and sai whether i am a cat or a monkei that i can climb
up a slope of smooth stone from earth to heaven er we had gone the
length of that rope i should fall and break my neck rather would i
fight ten men singlehand than be so mad
it is true i think that you will make no good scaler of stone
mountain friend ru said nefra survei the ethiopian mighti
form which had grown no smaller with the passag of the year now
ceas from talk for we wast time if you cannot go up the
pyramid stand at the bottom of it just beneath me and if i slip and
fall catch me as i come
catch you as you come catch you as you come gasp ru
without more word nefra went to the foot of the third pyramid up
which the sheik who also seem to be empti of speech began to mount
by the wai he knew have the end of the rope that wa about nefra
ti round hi middl she follow him her feet bare and her robe
tuck up about her knee as he bade her while after her came hi
son watch her everi movement
hearken men groan ru if you suffer my ladi to slip you had
better stop on that pyramid for the rest of your live for if you
come down i will kill you both
if she slip we shall slip also the god bear me wit that it is
no fault of mine answer the sheik who wa ly on hi face upon
the slope of the pyramid
now it is to be told that nefra prove an apt pupil at thi game she
had the ey of a hawk the courag of a lion and wa surefoot as
an ap up she went set her hand and feet exactli where her
guid had done till thei had conquer half the height
it is enough for todai said the sheik no beginn of our race
come farther at the first trial that is the rule rest here awhil
and then descend my son will place your feet where thei should go
i obei said nefra and turn herself round as her guid had done
abov her to see noth beneath her save a sheer gulf of space and
ru grown small stand on the sand at the bottom then for the
first time she grew dizzi
my head swim she said faintli
turn about again said the sheik nor could hi quiet voic quit
conceal the agoni of hi fear
she obei and her strength came back to her her flesh obei the
will within
i am well again she said
then ladi turn onc more for if you do not do so now you never
will
for the second time she obei and lo she no longer fear the
height the spirit within her had conquer her mortal trembl
after thi the descent wa easi for she could see where to place her
hand and feet in the fissur of that hot and shine marbl
moreov the young man beneath who know everi on of them wa
abl to keep hi face to the pyramid guid her as to where to set
them so thei came safe to the ground where nefra sat a littl
while pant and smile at ru who mop hi brow with hi robe
hi big ey start from hi head for never befor had he been so
frighten
have you had enough of the pyramid ladi ask the sheik as he
loos the rope from about her
by no mean answer nefra spring up and clap her sore
hand i love the work and never shall i have had enough of them till
i can climb them all alon by moonlight as it is said that you can
do
isi mother of heaven exclaim the sheik throw up hi hand
thi is no mortal maid thi is a goddess thi is the spirit of the
pyramid herself appear in earthli form
ye said nefra i think that is what i amth spirit of the
pyramid now will it pleas you to meet me here tomorrow at the same
time when i hope that we mai be abl to reach the top of the smallest
of them
then have put on her sandal befor the unhappi man could answer
she depart at a run follow by ru who wa so astonish that he
could not speak
thi wa but a begin for what nefra prophesi that she
perform at thi time all the strength of her young and burn
natur wa direct to on thing onlyth masteri of those pyramid
it wa a small ambit yet to her in the dai of her dawn
womanhood it wa everyth she had been told that by birth she wa
queen of egypt it move her littl for dwell amid those desert
templ and tomb the royalti of egypt seem to her a dream or at
least someth far awai but the pyramid were near and what she
desir wa to be queen of the pyramid which she wa also told her
faroff ancestor had rais up to be their tomb moreov that
stori of a spirit which haunt them had stir her she did not
believ in the spirit but sinc youth is credul over matter that
have to do with love she believ the stori she saw that fair young
queen such a on as she wa who had also learn to climb the
pyramid fly to the top of the tallest of them and thenc hurl
herself to doom to escap on whom she hate and who had humbl her
countri to the dust thu bring conquer and conqueror to a common
doom also she found someth beauti someth that touch the
heart in the pendant of thi stori name that in a dai to come
anoth young and love queen would fly up on of those pyramid
pursu by anoth alien lover and that there on the verg of dizzi
death their hate would melt in the fire of passion thu bring
bless on the land for the rule of which thei fought
as yet nefra knew noth of love still natur wa at work in her as
it is in the smallest child and she understood someth of the
mean of thi beauti fabl and the dim thought that sprang from
it warm her sleep soul meanwhil she had but on desireto
achiev that which seem to be imposs to woman to conquer the
pyramid not understand in those dai that the thing wa an
allegori and that she whose strong spirit could enabl her to dare so
mani danger and to overcom them with her young bodi might also in
time come to meet subtler peril and tread them beneath her conquer
feet
moreov at thi time the desir of prayer and the mysteri of
communion with that which is abov mankind that which the dweller
upon earth call god came home to her not from ani teach of roi
or tau but as it were out of her own soul abov all thing she
yearn for thi communion and there fell upon her on of the strang
fanci some would call them mad which often enough possess
those who ar pass from childhood into the ful of life or from
the ful of life into the twilight that preced the dark of
death thi wa her particular dream or illus or vision of the
truth that she could best make her prayer and come into closest
communion with the spirit which brood over her and all the world in
utter solitud upon the summit of those pyramid it wa a folli
perhap yet a nobl folli at least in the end she reap it fruit
for within a year she learn to climb them all and thi quit alon
the sheik of the pyramid and hi son who had instruct her the art
and craft of whose famili it had been for gener to scale these
stone mountain for prais and reward on dai of festiv were
astonish and abas to see themselv equal or outpass in their
peculiar busi by a mere maiden
at the begin of the adventur thei had been summon befor the
council of the order who had grown alarm at the report of ru and
kemmah as to thi vagari which had seiz upon on whose life wa
preciou and ask as to it peril thei repli that there wa none
for those to whom the gift wa given sinc not for six gener
had a singl man among them come to hi death from follow thi
busi yet thei ad that to those who were not of their famili
it wa fatal sinc mani had tri to share their secret and it
fruit but all of them had perish miser an answer that
frighten the council yet becaus of the revel of roi thei
did noth to restrain nefra who went her wai about the matter and
took no harm at all till at length by dai or even by night when the
moon wa at it full she could reach the top of ani of the pyramid
as quickli as the sheik or hi son
then that famili abas themselv befor her and gather togeth
prai her to accept the captainci and leadership of them all sinc
she had outpass them all but nefra onli laugh and said that it
wa noth and she would not and order that thei should be given
reward such as she had to bestow thereaft she had the freedom of
the pyramid and wa allow to climb them when and how she like
without the attend of the sheik or hi son
yet of thi at last came troubl
chapter vii
the plot of the vizier
nefra as ha been said when the fanci took her made a custom of
climb on or other of the pyramid gener at the hour of the
rise or the set of the sun and stand there upon the topmost
flat copingston of prai in that gloriou loneli or
perchanc she would not prai but content herself with look down
upon the world beneath reflect the while upon what fortun it
might have to offer her or on such other matter as come into a
maiden mind
now thi habit of her becam known not onli among the member of the
order and their depend but to mani who dwelt or journei beyond
the boundari of what wa call the holi ground upon which no
stranger dare to set hi foot nor wa thi strang see that her
slender form thu pois between earth and heaven and outlin against
the sky at dawn or sunset could be seen from far awai even from the
nile itself when it wa in flood most held it to be that of the
spirit of the pyramid herself whose appear thu herald troubl
in egypt for there were few inde who believ it to be possibl
that ani woman could adventur herself in thi fashion or find the
strength and skill to climb up marbl like a lizard
soon the stori of the marvel spread far and wide and even came to the
court of king apepi
on even nefra have climb the second pyramid in thi fashion
descend as usual and becaus the light wa fail chose a somewhat
shorter rout that brought her to the ground not by the southern face
where ru wa wait to receiv her but just round the angl on that
face which look toward the west where the light of the dy dai
still shone have leapt lightli to the sand she look about for ru
and instead of him saw four men approach her of whom at first she
took littl note think in the fade light that these were the
sheik of the pyramid and hi son who came to inquir of her about
the new road she had found upon the western face of thi pyramid so
she stood still and thei drew near then hesit a littl as though
thei were afraid of her till present a voic call out
woman or spirit seiz her let her not escap us think of the great
reward and seiz her
thu encourag with a bound thei came at her understand her
peril nefra turn to fly up the pyramid again and alreadi wa some
feet abov the sand when the first of the men caught her by the ankl
and drag her down
ru she cri in a clear and pierc voic to my aid ru i am
snare ru
now as it chanc ru wa veri near onli just round the angl of the
pile inde becaus have lost sight of nefra in the shadow as she
descend feel disturb he wa advanc to the western face
where the light wa better to discov if perchanc she were there he
heard her cry for help he rush forward and turn the corner saw
nefra on the ground while round her were the four men three of them
bind her with a rope while the fourth wa ty a linen bandag
across her face
with a roar he leapt upon them hold hi great ax aloft he who had
the bandag saw him first a black gigant figur whom doubtless he
took for some terribl guardian spirit and strove to leap past him and
fly the ax flash and down he went dead cloven through and
through then the other men who at first thought that a lion had
roar saw also and for a moment stood amaz instantli ru wa on
them let fall the ax he grip the two who were nearest
seiz each of them by the throat he dash their head togeth
and put out hi mighti strength cast them far awai to right and
left in such fashion that where thei fell there thei lai stone dead
the fourth man had drawn a knife either to stab at ru or to kill
nefra but when he saw the fate of hi fellow all courag left him
and scream with fear he let fall the knife and fled awai ru
snatch the knife from the sand and hurl it after him a yell of
pain told him that hi aim wa true though becaus of the shadow he
could no longer see the man ru would have start in pursuit but
nefra struggl from the ground cri
nai bide here there mai be more of them
true he answer and the dog ha it
then without more word snatch up nefra and hold her to hi
breast with hi left arm as though she were but a babe he found hi
ax and without wait to look at the dead sped awai with her along
the western base of the pyramid till present thei were among tomb
where thei could be seen no more
thi is the end of those trick of your ladi he said roughli for
he wa shake not with fear but at the thought of what she had
escap
had it not been for you it might have been wors answer nefra
still i have learn my lesson set me down now o most dear ru for
my breath ha return to me
when present all thi tale wa told to kemmah and to the council of
the order fear and dismai took hold of them even tau the wise wa
dismai onli roi the prophet remain undisturb
the maid will take no harm he said i know it from those who
cannot lie and therefor it is that i have permit her to follow
her fanci as to the climb of the pyramid for it is ill to cross
or to coop up such a on as she as it is good that she should learn
to look upon the face of danger and to overcom them still
doubtless thi is the begin of peril and henceforward we must be
upon our guard
then he sent out men to bring in the dead whom ru had slain and to
search for the wound man and if he could be found to captur him
aliv thi howev did not happen for when the light came again of
that man there remain onli certain bloodstain upon the sand which
after a while were lost show that he had been abl to staunch hi
hurt and by walk upon stone to leav no track behind him
the dead howev told their own stori for thei were of the
shepherd race and two of them wore garment such as were us in the
court of king apepi the third it would seem wa a guid though of
what peopl could not be known see that it wa on hi head that
the ax of ru had fallen and who could tell aught of whenc he came
upon whose head the ax of ru had fallen
so the bodi of those womanthiev were thrown to the jackal and
the vultur that their ka might find noth to inhabit and
their soul with all solemn were curs by roi in a chapter of the
order that from ag to ag thei might find no rest becaus of their
doubl crime for had thei not violat the pact of gener and
enter the holi ground which wa the home of the consecr order of
the dawn and there striven to steal awai or perchanc to murder a
certain ladi who in the world without wa not known by ani name
thenc the matter end for a space except that at dawn or sunset
nefra wa no longer seen stand upon the crest of pyramid
yet some while later a sick and sorri man with a bandag back who
from time to time cough up blood as though from a pierc lung
stagger into the court at tani where hi face wa known and be
admit told hi tale to a great offic who listen to it
wrathfulli and command a scribe to write it down word for word when
it had finish that offic curs thi man becaus he had fail in
hi mission
is it my fault ask the man wa it right to send those who ar
born of women to captur a spirit or a witchsinc no maid in whom
warm blood flow can run up and down pyramid face with smooth and
shine stone as fli run up and down a wall which we saw thi on
do is it right to expect them to fight and overcom a black devil
from the underworld larger than ani who walk the earth whose voic
is the voic of a lion and whose hand can crush skull as though thei
were pomegran is it right to command them to enter a haunt
place peopl by god and wizard and the ghost of the dead a fool
wa i to listen to you and your promis of great reward and fool
were my companion as doubtless thei think in the underworld todai
for who is there in egypt that doe not know that to violat the holi
ground of the order of the dawn is to court death and damnat now
give me my price that i mai divid it among my children
your price gasp the high offic were you not wound it
should be rod go dog go
where am i to go ask the man i who am accurs
to the home of all who failto hell repli the offic make a
sign to hi servant
so thei threw him out and to hell or elsewher he went veri shortli
for that knife of hi which ru had cast after him with so good an aim
wa poison moreov it had struck him beneath the shoulder and
pierc hi lung
the offic went into the privat chamber where sat king apepi with
some of hi counsellor and hi young son the princ khian the heir
appar to the throne thi apepi wa a big fleshi man still in
middl ag with the hook nose of the shepherd and black beadi
ey on who wa violent in hi temper reveng and fiercenatur
like all hi peopl yet veri anxiousmind a fearer of evil
veri differ from him wa hi son khian born of an egyptian mother
with royal blood in her vein whom apepi had marri for reason of
polici moreh had love her in hi fashion and when she di in
give birth to her onli child khian had taken no other queen in her
place though of those who were not queen he had mani about him and
now thi child khian had grown up to manhood he wa gentlenatur
and softei show but littl trace of the shepherd blood strong
and handsom in bodi and quick in mind on too who thought and
studi a soldier and a hunter yet a lover of peac by natur a
ruler of men who desir to heal the wound of egypt and make her
great
befor these appear the old vizier anath and told hi tale read
what had been written down from the lip of the wound man
apepi listen earnestli
do you know vizier who thi mad girl is who ha a fanci for
climb the great pyramid he ask at length
no your majesti though perhap i might hazard a guess answer
the vizier in a doubt voic
then i will tell you vizier she is no other than the onli child of
kheperra the pharaoh of the south who fell in the battl year ago
i am sure of it it is known that such a child wa born for as you
mai rememb with the help of certain bribe theban nobl we tri
to captur her and her mother the queen rima the daughter of the king
of babylon it would seem that her god fought for her sinc both of
them escap and of those who went to take them onli on wa left
aliv the rest he swore were all kill by a black giant who
guard them now there wa such a giant for he fought at the side of
kheperra and bore hi bodi out of the battl more he wa seen upon a
trade boat go down the nile and with him were two women and a
child doubtless disguis by craft these three slip through the
hand of my offic at memphi who afterward were degrad for
their neglig and it wa report that thei had made their wai to
babylon yet our spi tell us noth of their come to babylon
which is strang if queen rima and her daughter who is call
princess of egypt reach the court of ditanah with whom now and
again we have been at war for mani year therefor either thei ar
dead or thei ar hide in egypt
it would seem that thi is so pharaoh said the vizier and the
other councillor nod assent
of late went on apepi a wind of rumour ha sprung up which blow
from the cataract to the sea and whisper in the ear of men in
everi citi and villag on the nile thi rumour sai that the queen of
egypt live and er long will appear to take her throne it sai
moreov that she shelter among that strang brotherhood of learn
folk who have their home in the tomb of the old pyramid near memphi
and who ar call the order of the dawn it wa to find out the truth
of thi matter that somewhat against my counsel you vizier anath
sent certain bold fellow under promis of great reward to spy upon
thi order which ha no traitor and to get sight of thi wondrou
maiden who can climb the pyramid and who rumour sai is none other
than the princess of egypt herself though for aught i know she mai be
but a juggler
or a spirit suggest the vizier sinc it seem imposs that a
woman can perform such feat and as to thi matter there is a
legend
or even a spirit though for my part i put littl faith in spirit
well the men go thei creep into the holi land as thi place is
call thei see the climber descend a pyramid though i gave no
such order thei seiz her which show that she is flesh and blood
she call aloud a black giantmark again a black giantrush
roar to her rescu he slai three of these men as though thei were
but children and hurl the man own knife after the fourth wound
him sore so that the maiden escap and the order of the dawn is
put upon it guard now i sai that thi maiden is no other than nefra
princess of egypt still guard by that ethiopian who bore her
father bodi from the battlefield
when the murmur of assent had di awai apepi continu
i sai also that thi busi is veri danger let us look it in
the face what ar we shepherd we ar a race that gener ago
enter egypt and took possess of it richest land drive the
king back to thebe and usurp the throne of the north thi i still
hold and the south also in a fashion for we have corrupt it chief
nobl and it high priest bind them with chain of gold yet we
ar in peril have been much weaken by ceaseless war with
babylon also mani of our peopl have intermarri with egyptian as
inde i did myself so that the shepherd ar becom stain to the
colour of the dweller on the nile now these egyptian ar a stubborn
and a subtl folk also thei ar loyal to their old tradit and to
the blood of the king that rule them for thousand of year if on
dai thei should learn certainli that a queen of that blood live it
well mai be that thei will rise like the nile in flood and sweep us
into nothing therefor i sai that thi queen must be destroi
and with her the brotherhood that is call the order of the dawn
in the silenc that follow the princ khian rose from the chair in
which he wa seat below the throne and make obeis spoke for
the first time sai
o king my father hear me as is known to you i studi mani thing
that have to do with the tradit and the mysteri of ancient
egypt and amongst other from certain instruct men and from old
write i have learn much of thi order of the dawn it is an old
order and it member ar peac folk who fight with the spirit and
not with the sword a veri power order moreov for although none
know them it ha adher by the thousand throughout egypt perhap
even in thi court and it is report in far land as well
especi in babylonia further it is head by a mighti prophet an
ancient man name roi if inde he is a man on who hold commun
with the god and like all those over whom he rule is protect by
the god lastli by treati made with our forefath the first of
the shepherd king and renew by everi on of them even by
yourself my father thi holi ground of grave where thi order
dwell in the shadow of the pyramid is sacr and inviol under
pain of a dread curs which curs it would seem ha fallen swiftli
upon those four who somewhat against your counsel and certainli
against mine broke the pact and enter thi land and there not
satisfi with spy tri to do violenc to a certain ladi or
spirit yet under oath and custom it mai not be enter nor mai ani
harm be work to the dweller in the tomb therefor pharaoh my
father i prai you think no more of bring destruct on thi order
and on a maiden whom you believ to be the daughter of kheperra sinc
if you attempt it i am sure that you will bring destruct upon
yourself and upon mani of those who serv you
now the king grew angri
almost might on think princ he said with a sneer that you
yourself had been sworn of thi order of the dawn what ar oath and
treati when our throne itself is at stake there is disaffect in
the land babylon harass us continu and why becaus she sai
that we have work wrong to on of her princess who marri
kheperra or have done her to death you do not know it but i have it
in a recent letter from her king i sai that all thi nest of plotter
must be destroi whether it be your will or not
the princ khian seat himself again and wa silent but anath the
vizier said
o pharaoh a thought ha come to me is there not anoth wai can
you not walk a gentler road and gain your end without break faith
with the order of the dawn which inde is greatli to be fear
sinc like the princ khian i hold that it is protect by heaven
itself you believ that thi ladi of the pyramid is the law child
of kheperra and it mai be so if thi can be establish here is my
plan send an embassi to roi the prophet and demand that thi ladi
should be given to you in marriag and becom your law queen as
she well mai do see that now you have none thu would you tie all
egypt togeth in the bond of love and keep your hand unstain
at these word khian laugh aloud and the councillor smile but
apepi stare at anath then drop hi fierc ey and consid
awhil at length he lift them again and said
you ar wise in your fashion anath a lion cub can be tame as
well as kill although it must be rememb that if tame still it
grow at last into a lion and long to walk the desert and fill itself
with wild meat as did it begett from the first of time why
should i not wed thi maidenif she live as i believeand thu
unit the hous of the shepherd king and that of the old pharaoh of
the land it would put an end to mani differ and thereaft egypt
might be on and at peac abl also to look babylon in the face
onli what sai the princ khian i am not so old but that children
might be born of such a union undertaken in the hope that the eldest
of them like to the pharaoh of old time should wear the doubl
crown of north and south without question or disput for ever it wa
the law of egypt that the right to royalti came through the mother
born of the true race of pharaoh and thu ha dynasti been link to
dynasti from the begin
now the vizier and all there present look at khian wonder what
he might answer becaus upon thi answer in the end might hang hi
inherit to the crown of the north
for a littl while he made none then suddenli he laugh again and
said
it seem that the case stand thu if there live on who is the
heiress of kheperra the dead pharaoh of the south and therefor of
the ancient royal blood of egypt that rule for thousand of year
befor we shepherd seiz a portion of their inherit and if
she consent to wed my royal father the king and if have wed
him a child is born of thi marriag i the present appar heir
under such a solemn treati of union mai be dispossess of my
heritag well here ar mani if and should all of them be fulfil
a score of year or so henc doe it so greatli matter do i so much
desir to be king of the north and the inheritor of war and troubl
that for the sake of such a rule i should seek to prevent the heal
of egypt wound and the weld togeth of her sever crown
man dai is short and pharaoh or peasant soon he is forgot and
perchanc in the end it will be better for him if he ha been a
bringer of peac rather than the wearer of a ravel robe of power
that he doe not seek
truli i wa right when i said that you must belong to yonder order of
the dawn for not so in a like case should i have answer the king my
father khian said apepi astonish still let that be for each
man dream hi own dream and feed upon hi own folli therefor i
take you at your word that as the heir appar to my throne you have
noth to sai against thi plan to my mind wild enough yet on of
which trial mai be made even if in the end it should damag you now
hearken khian it is my will to send you the princ of the north on
an embassi to thi prophet roi and to the council of the order of the
dawn will you who ar wise and polit undertak such a mission
befor i answer pharaoh tell me what word would be put in the
mouth of your ambassador would these be word of peac or war
both khian he would sai to the peopl of the dawn that the pharaoh
of the north wa griev that against hi will the pact between him
and them wa broken by certain madmen in hi servic who everi on of
them had paid the penalti of their crime in aton of which he
brought gift to be laid as offer upon the altar of whatev god
thei worship he would inquir whether it is true that among them
shelter nefra the child of kheperra and of rima the daughter of the
king of babylon and if he discov that thi is so which mai prove
imposs for perhap she might be hidden awai and all knowledg of
her deni he would declar in the presenc of their council and of
the maiden herself if mai be that apepi king of the north be
still a man of middl ag and on who lack a law queen offer to
take thi maiden nefra to wife with all due solemn and have
obtain your consent thereto to swear that a child of her should
she bear ani shall by right of birth after my death wear the doubl
crown of egypt as pharaoh of the upper and the lower land all of
these thing he would prove by write seal with my own seal and
your own which would be given to him
such ar the word of peac o king which i hear and understand now
let me learn what ar those of war
few and simpl it would seem khian if thi maiden live and the
offer is refus by her or on her behalf then you would sai that i
the king apepi tear up all treati between myself and the peopl of
the dawn whom i will destroi as plotter against my throne and the
peac of egypt
and if it should be prove that there is no such maiden what then
then utter no threat you would return and report to me
life at thi court is wearisom to me sinc my return from the syrian
war pharaoh and here is a new busi to which i have a fancyi
know not why therefor if it pleas you to send me i will
undertak your mission said khian after think for a while yet
is it well that i should go as the princ khian see that although
the throne is your gift and you can bequeath it to whom you will
hitherto i have been look upon as your heir and thi order of the
dawn might be mistrust of such a messeng or even make strang
us of him thu he might remain as a hostag among them
which mayhap i should ask you to do khian as a proof of my good
faith until thi marriag is accomplish for understand on thing
if the princess nefra live it is my will to wed her becaus as i
see she and she alon is the road to safeti he who cross me in
thi matter is my enemi to the death whether he be the prophet roi or
ani other man sure he shall die
you ar quick of decis my father an hour ago no such thought had
enter your mind and now it hold no other
ay son for now thank to anath i see a ship that will bear me
and egypt over a rise flood of troubl which soon might overwhelm
us both and after the fashion of the great i embark befor it be
swept downstream vizier when you espi that ship you did good
servic and for you there is a chain of gold and much advanc
nai keep your thank till it ha born us safe to harbour for the
rest if you khian think thi mission too dangerousand it ha
dangersi will seek anoth envoi though you ar the on whom i
should choos i doubt whether you will deceiv these keenei
magician by take anoth name and pretend that you ar not
khian but an offic of the court or a privat person still do so
if you will
why not pharaoh answer khian laugh see that if all
goe well it is your purpos to make of me a veri privat person for
then i who thi morn wa the heir appar or so it pleas you to
sai shall be but on of mani king son if that chanc i would ask
whether i who shall have lost much mai retain my privat estat and
revenu that have come to me through my mother or by the endow of
your majesti for i who do not greatli care for crown could wish to
remain rich with mean to live at eas and follow those pursuit i
love
that is sworn to you khian here and now and upon my royal word let
it be record
i thank the king and now by permiss i will withdraw myself to
talk with that wound man befor he di sinc perhap he can tell
me much that mai be us upon thi busi
then the princ khian prostrat himself and went
when he had watch him go king apepi thought to himself
sure thi young man ha a great heart few would not have winc
beneath such a blow unless inde thei plan treacheri which khian
could never do almost am i griev yet it must be so if that royal
maiden live i will wed her and swear the throne to her children for
thu onli can i and egypt sleep in peac then he said aloud
the council is end and woe to him that betrai it secret for he
shall be thrown to the lion
chapter viii
the scribe rasa
within thirti dai of the hold of thi council a messeng
appear on what wa acknowledg to be the frontier of the holi
ground that wa mark by the highest point to which the nile rose in
time of flood and call to on who wa work in the field that he
had a write which he prai him to deliv to the prophet of the
order of the dawn
the man came and stare at the messeng stupidli ask
what is the order of the dawn and who is it prophet
perchanc friend you might make inquiri said the messeng
hand him the roll and with it no small present meanwhil i who
mai alwai be found at dawn or sunset seat at my prayer in yonder
group of palm will bide here and await the answer
the farmer for such he seem to be scratch hi head and take
the roll and the present said that he would try to serv on so
gener though he knew not of whom to ask concern thi order and
it prophet
on the follow dai at sunset he appear again and hand to the
messeng anoth roll which he declar he had been charg by some
person unknown to give to him for deliveri to the king apepi at hi
court at tani the messeng mock thi peasant said that he had
never heard of king apepi and did not know where tani might be still
out of kind of heart he would try to discov and make due
deliveri of the roll after which the two smile at each other and
depart
some dai later thi write wa read to apepi by hi privat scribe
it ran thu
in the name of that spirit who rule the world and of hi servant
osiri god of the dead greet to apepi king of the shepherd
now dwell at the citi of tani in lower egypt
know o king apepi that we roi the prophet and the council of
the order of the dawn who sit in the shadow of the ancient
pyramid built long ago by certain king of egypt onc member of
our order to serv as tomb for their bodi and to be monument
to their great on which all ey might gaze till the end of
the world we who from ag to ag drink of the wisdom of the
sphinx the terror of the desert have receiv your messag and
given it consider know o king that although of late we
have suffer grievou wrong at the hand of some who seem to have
been your offic for which wrong those unhappi on paid with
their live as all must do who attempt to violat our sanctiti
and to peer into our secret in obedi to the precept of our
order we forgiv that wrong and have put it asid as a matter
of small account we will receiv the ambassador whom you desir
to send to us to discuss matter of which you do not reveal the
purport know o king further that thi ambassador whoever he
mai be must come alon for it is contrari to our rule to admit
more than on stranger beyond the border of the holi ground if
after learn thi it be still your pleasur to send that
ambassador let him appear befor the next full moon in the same
grove of palm where thi roll wa deliv to your messeng
here on of those who serv us will find him and guid him to
where we ar nor shall he suffer ani harm at our hand
when apepi had heard thi letter he sent for the princ khian and
ask him privat whether still he dare to adventur himself
unaccompani among the peopl of the order of the dawn and in a place
which all men swore wa haunt
why not father ask khian if mischief is meant against me an
ambassador guard would be no protect nor ar ghost and spirit
to be frighten awai by number if i go at all i would as soon go
alon as in compani also it is plain that thu onli can thi embassi
be carri out becaus yonder brotherhood will not receiv more than
a singl man
as it pleas you son repli apepi go now and make readi
tomorrow the write shall be deliv to you by the vizier togeth
with my instruct also a guard will be wait to conduct you to
the place appoint by thi prophet go and return in safeti
rememb our bargain and bring thi maiden with you in charg of
women of her own peopl if so it mai be for thu shall you earn my
favour
i go said khian to return or perchanc not to return as the
god mai direct
so everyth have been made readi and the roll contain the
offer and the threat of king apepi given into hi keep togeth
with offer of gold for the god of the children of the dawn and
present of jewel for the princess nefra if it should be prove that
she wa the wondrou maiden who dwelt among them khian depart yet
he did not travel as the princ but rather as a scribe of the court
rasa by name whom it had pleas the king to choos to be hi envoi
upon a certain busi leav tani so secretli that few discov
he had gone he sail up nile in a ship whose sailor had never seen
him and although thei had order to obei him in everyth took him
to be what he said he wa a messeng rasa by name travel upon
the royal busi even the guard that accompani him six in
number were soldier from a distant citi who had never look upon
hi face
hi journei end he reach the land place in the afternoon upon
the dai appoint and wa escort by the soldier who bore the gold
and other gift also hi travel gear to the grove of palm which
the messeng had describ as to which there could be no mistak
for no other wa in sight here he dismiss the guard who left him
doubtfulli and yet were glad to go befor even came for like all
egypt thei believ thi place to be haunt by the ghost of the
mighti dead also by the spirit of the pyramid whose ey drove men
to mad
now as we ar order by anath the vizier said the captain of the
guard we and the ship in which you have travel my lord rasa
depart to memphi where we mai be found when we ar summon though
we ar not sure that you will ever need a ship again
why not captain ask khian or rasa
becaus thi place ha an evil reput my lord rasa and it is said
that no stranger who cross yonder belt of sand ever return
if so what happen to him captain
we do not know but it is report that he is wall up in a tomb and
left to perish there or if he escap thi fate and is as young and
wellfavour as you ar perchanc he meet the beauteou spirit of
the pyramid who wander about in the moonlight and becom her
lover
if she is so fair captain wors thing might happen to a man
nai lord rasa for when he kiss her on the lip she look into
her ey and mad take hold of him so that he run after her
till at last he fall on the sand rave and should he live at all
remain thu all hi dai
why doe he not catch her captain
becaus she lead him to on of the pyramid up which be a
spirit she can glide like a moonbeam but whither he cannot follow
and when he see that he ha lost her then hi brain boil and he is
no more a man
you make me afraid captain thi would be a sad fate to happen to a
learn scribe for such is realli my trade just when he had won
favour at the court still i have my order and you know the doom of
him who disobei or even doe not carri out the command of hi
majesti apepi
ay lord rasa i know well enough for thi king is veri fierc and
if he ha set hi mind on anyth ill to cross such a on if he is
lucki is shorten by a head or if he is unlucki is beaten to death
with rod
if so captain it would seem better to run the risk of the ghost
or even of the terribl ey of the spirit of the pyramid rather
than to return with you as i confess that i should wish about my
neck i have a holi charm which is said to defend it wearer from all
tombdwel and other evil thing and to thi and to my prayer i
must trust myself soon i hope to see you again upon the ship but if
you learn that i am dead i prai of you lai an offer for my soul
upon the first altar of osiri that you find
ill not forget it lord rasa for know that i like you well and
could have wish you a better fate answer the captain who wa
kindheart ad as he depart with hi compani perchanc you
have offend pharaoh or the vizier and on or other of them ha
chosen thi wai to be rid of you
that man is as cheer as a bullfrog croak in a pool in a night
of storm thought khian to himself well perhap he is right and
if so what will it matter when those pyramid have seen the nile rise
anoth hundr time
then he sat himself down upon the ground rest hi back against the
bole of on of the palm and contempl the mighti outlin of
these same pyramid which hitherto he had onli seen from far awai
think to himself as nefra had thought that those who built them
must have been king inde also he reflect not without pleasur
for he wa a lover of adventur and new thing upon the strang
of hi mission and of the manner in which it had been thrust upon him
if thi royal maiden live he thought and i succe it mean that i
lose a crown and if i do not succe then it is also possibl that i
shall lose the crown sinc my father never forgiv those who fail
inde it would be best for me if there is no such ladi or that i
should not find her at ani rate there is some girl who climb
pyramid becaus befor he di that womanthief swore to me that he
saw her he swore to me also that she wa veri beauteou the
loveliest ladi that ever he beheld which almost prove to me that she
cannot have been the princess for as the god do not give everyth
princess ar alwaysor almost alwaysugli moreov thei do not
climb pyramid but lie about and eat sweetmeat perhap after all she
whom the dy thief believ he saw if he saw ani on is a spirit
and if so mai it be given to me to behold her to do which i would
take my chanc of mad meanwhil these children of the dawn ar
strang folk to judg from all that i can learn concern them yet
it is said most kindli so perhap thei will not murder me even if
thei guess or know that i am the princ khian what would be the us
see there ar so mani who ar princ or who can be made princ
by a decre and a touch of a sceptr
reflect thu khian fell asleep for the afternoon wa veri hot and
he had found littl rest upon that crowd boat
while he wa sleep roi the prophet the lord tau and the princess
nefra were take counsel togeth in a chamber of the templ where
thei dwelt
the messeng ha land prophet said tau it is report to me
that he is alreadi seat in the grove of palm
is aught els report tau that is as to hi busi ask roi
if so speak it out sinc a command ha come to me that the time is
at hand when our ladi of egypt hereand he point to nefrashould
be taken into our full counsel
ye prophet a certain brother of our who is on of the court of
king apepilook not astonish princess for our brethren ar
everywhereinform me by the fashion that is known to you that thi
busi is on which concern a certain ladi veri close to be
brief when four men strove to carri off thi ladi ru the ethiopian
made a mistak for he kill three of them but suffer the fourth to
get awai though wound to the death thi man reach the court at
tani and befor he di made a report which ad to other rumour
assur king apepi that a certain babe who escap from hi hand in
thebe long agodwel among us here and is no other than the heiress
of the ancient line of the pharaoh of egypt
it seem that thi king is a shrewd man said roi
veri shrewd answer tau and quick to decid so much so that on
a hint given to him by hi vizier anath also a shred man he
determin at onc not to kill a certain ladi as at first he thought
to do but to make her hi queen and thu by promis their
heritag to her offspr to unit the upper and the lower land
without war or troubl
now nefra start but befor she could speak roi answer
the scheme ha merit great merit for thu would our end be
attain and mani sorrow and peril melt awai like morn mist
but he ad with a sigh what sai nefra our princess who after
tonight ceremoni will be our queen
i sai answer nefra coldli that i am not a woman to be sold for
the price of a crown or of a hundr crown thi man apepi the
usurp is on of the fierc shepherd who ar the enemi of our
race he is a thief of the desert who ha stolen half egypt and hold
it by forc and fraud he who is more than old enough to be my
father slew my father the pharaoh kheperra and strove to slai me
and my mother the queen rima the daughter of babylon have fail
in thi now he seek to bui me whom he ha never seen as an arab
bui a mare of priceless blood and for hi own purpos to set me at
the head of hi household prophet i will have none of him rather
than enter hi palac as a bride i will hurl myself from the tallest
pyramid and seek refug with osiri
here we have the answer that i foresaw said roi with a littl smile
upon hi ag lip nor is it on that caus me to griev sinc
whatev it gain such a union would be unholi fear not princess
while the order of the dawn ha power you ar safe from the arm of
apepi the wolf tell me tau accord to the report that ha reach
you is thi all that the king of the north ha to sai to us
nai prophet when the roll that yonder messeng bear is open i
think that in it will be found written that if the heiress of egypt
is not deliv to him then he propos to take her by forc or if
he cannot do so to send her down to death and with her
notwithstand hi treati everi on of the children of the dawn
from the most ag to the babe in arm
is it so said roi well if a fool strive to drag a sleep
snake from it hole that snake awak puff out it head and
strike as mayhap apepi will find befor all is done but these
thing ar not yet time to talk of them when the royal hand is thrust
into the hole to grip the deadli hood snake meanwhil thi envoi
from apepi must be grant the hospit which we have sworn to him
and brought from the palm grove where he sit alon would it pleas
you princess to throw a man robe over that woman dress of your
and go to lead him here ru and the ladi kemmah would accompani you
keep themselv out of sight if so be clever you might learn
someth from the man who find but a gentl youth sent to guid
him would fear no trap and perhap even speak freeli to such a on
ye answer nefra i think that it would pleas me that is if
you ar sure that there is no trap or ambush sinc the walk to the
grove is pleasant and i have been coop up of late
there is no ambush ladi repli roi sinc what happen awhil
ago by the pyramid our frontier have been well guard also your
everi step will be watch although you do not see the watcher
therefor fear noth learn all you can from thi envoi and bring
him to the sphinx where he will be blindfold and led befor us
i go said nefra laugh tomorrow i shall be call a queen and
who know whether afterward i shall be suffer to walk alon
so she went accompani by tau who summon ru and kemmah in on of
the court of the templ and there gave certain order to them and to
other who seem to be await him thi done he return to roi and
look him in the face said in a low voic
do you o prophet who know so much chanc to have learn what mai
be the name and qualiti of thi envoi from apepi
now roi look him in the ey and said
it come into my mind how or whenc doe not matter that although
he travel as a simpl offic of the court call i know not what
the man is no other than the princ khian apepi heir
so i think also said tau and not without reason tell me holi
prophet have you learn aught concern thi khian
much tau from hi boyhood he ha been watch by those at apepi
court who ar our friend and their report of him is veri good he
ha hi fault like other men in youth and he is somewhat rash had
he not been so never would he have undertaken thi mission under
strang condit for the rest he is more egyptian than shepherd
for in him the mother blood run strong and if he worship ani god
at all of which he be a philosoph i am not sure thei ar
those of egypt further he is learn brave handsom of bodi and
gener in mind someth of a dreamer on who seek that which he
will never find upon the earth on too who long to heal egypt
wound inde he seem to be such a man as had i a daughter i
would choos for her in marriag if i might thi is the report that i
have concern the princ khian is your as good
in all thing it is the same prophet yet why doe he come hither
upon such an errand see that if it succe it mai cost him hi
success to the crown i fear some trap
i think tau that he come for adventur and becaus he seek new
thing also becaus he is drawn to our doctrin and would studi them
with hi own ey and ear not know that he mai find more than he
seek
is it in the hope that he will do so prophet that you have put it
into the mind of the princess nefra to meet him yonder in the palm
grove
it is tau when i said that such a marriag as thi apepi propos
had mani merit what i meant wa not that she should be thrown to
the shepherd lion but that a marriag between her and the princ
khian would have those merit how could egypt be better ti
togeth even if we were strong enough to wage it we ar hater of
war and would not attain our end by death and bloodsh yet to
propos such a thing would defeat itself sinc as she told us thi
ladi nefra is not on to be sold or driven her heart and noth els
is her guid which she will follow fast and far
the heart of woman goe out more readili to princ than it doe to
humbl messeng what if thi on who sit among the palm tree doe
not pleas her
then tau all is finish and we must find anoth road let fate
decid after she ha judg not of the princ but of the man we
cannot hearken thi envoi howev name come to learn what
thousand know alreadi whether or not the daughter and heiress of
kheperra shelter among us we can deni or we can confess which shall
we do
if we deni prophet certainli he will discov the truth otherwis
and set us down as liar and coward if we confess he and the world
will know us for true men and brave and that the oath which we swear
to the goddess of veriti is no empti form so whatev we mai lose we
shall win honour even from our foe therefor i sai confess and face
the issu
so sai i and the rest of the council tau tonight befor the
deleg from all egypt and elsewher the princess is to be crown
it queen in the great hall of the templ a matter that cannot be
hid sinc the veri bat will twitter it throughout the land
therefor it seem wise to me that thi messeng should be present at
the ceremoni and if he will make open report of it to apepi there is
anoth thing of which he must also make report tau name whether
the newcrown queen will take thi apepi as a husband
alreadi we know the answer prophet but after itwhat
after itbabylon listen tau apepi will send an armi to destroi us
and to captur the queen but he will find noth to destroi for the
order ha it hide place and in egypt ar mani tomb and catacomb
where soldier dare not come while the queen will be far awai if
apepi seek a curs let the curs fall upon him as fall it shall
when a hundr thousand babylonian pour down on tani in answer to
dead rima prayer and to right her daughter wrong
be it so said tau those who seek the face of war must be prepar
to look him in the ey for such is the rule of god and man
nefra wrap in a long cloak approach the grove of palm
follow by ru and the ladi kemmah who grumbl at the busi
the dai is hot she said and who but fool would walk so far in
the blaze of the sun tonight there ar ceremoni in which you
princess must plai the greatest part is it fit that you and i
should weari ourselv thu when the work of make readi your robe
and jewel is not finish what is thi new mad what do you
seek
that which as you have instruct me is sought of all women nurs
namelya man answer nefra in her sweet mock voic i believ
that there is a man in yonder palm grove and i go to find him
a man inde ar there not men in plenti nearer home if tomb can
be call a home while on is still live beneath the sun still it
is true that most of them ar graybeard dotard and the rest but
priest or anchorit who think of noth but their soul or
husbandmen who toil all dai and dream all night of how much mud nile
will yield at it next rise well there ar the palm and i see no
man nor can i walk ani farther in thi accurs sand here is the
statu of a god or perchanc of some king whose name no on ha heard
for a thousand year at least god or king he give shade and in it
i will sit as if you ar wise you will do also while ru hunt for
thi man of your though when he see a black giant grin at him
with a great ax in hi hand i think that he will run awai
so do i said nefra yet ru come with me as inde you must
then walk somewhat to the right she enter the grove of palm at
it end and step softli along it bid ru keep himself as much
hidden as possibl present seat against the trunk of on of them
she saw an offic who wore upon hi robe the lion badg of the
shepherd king have by hi side certain packag and behold he
wa fast asleep now a thought took her and she command ru to
approach him softli and have carri off the packag to go and
hide with them behind the statu where kemmah sat then she said he
wa to follow her with kemmah and the gear in such fashion if might
be that the offic did not see them as she led him toward the statu
of the sphinx
thi ru did without awaken khian for although he wa so larg
like all ethiopian he could move softli enough at needan art that
thei learn in track enemi and game he vanish with hi burden
behind the statu whenc she knew well he wa watch her in case of
danger but nefra lean against anoth palm studi the sleeper
close at the first glanc she wa awar that never befor had she
beheld such a man as thi offic on at onc so handsom and so
refin of face
if hi ey which i cannot see ar as good as the rest of him he is
beauti though nefra also he look like on whose spirit guid
hi flesh and not hi flesh hi spirit and as she thought someth
new someth she had never felt befor stir her seren and
frighten her a littl though in what wai she wa not sure
so for mani minut thei remain the weari khian sleep and nefra
watch him at length he stir stretch out hi arm as though
to clasp a dream yawn and open hi ey
thei ar as good as the rest of him reflect nefra as she slip
behind the palm and hid there which thei were be larg brown
and somewhat melancholi
now khian rememb the packet which contain the present and the
gold and began to search for them eagerli
by the god thei ar gone he said aloud in a voic that although
anxiou still wa soft and pleasant how can thi have happen and

in those who run errand and guid travel yet i dare to differ
from you these stone heap undoubtedli ar beauti with a beauti
that crush the mind though not so much so as ar mountain
chisel out by natur and cap with snow such as i have seen in
syria but to me thei speak not of the mighti dead whose memori thei
glorifi but of the thousand of forgotten on who perish in the
toil of their uprear that in them the bone of king might find a
hous deem to be etern and their name preserv among men wa it
worth while to leav monument to be the marvel of gener at the
cost of so much doom and miseri

bear fruit even though we know not the purpos and never see the
fruit mai be born also with joi but empti steril suffer is a
desert without water and a torment without hope

meet no on by a secret doorwai to the desert beyond
where have all those gone whom we saw last night ask khian
where do the bat go lord when the sun aris thei vanish awai and
ar no more seen yet thei ar not dead but onli hidden so it is with
the compani of the dawn search for them among the fishermen of the

them in the court of foreign king search where you will yet be
sure that neither you nor all the spi of the shepherd king will find

truli thi is a land of ghost said khian almost could i believ
that those veil on were not men but spirit
perhap answer ru enigmat and now where would it pleas
you to wander
to the pyramid said khian
so to the pyramid thei went walk round all of them while khian
marvel at their great
is it possibl that these stone mountain can be climb he said
present
ru led him round the corner of the second pyramid and there seat on
the sand and plai pipe that made a wild music were three men the
captain of the pyramid and two of hi son
here ar those who can answer your question lord he said then
turn to the men ad thi lord who is an envoi and a guest
desir to know whether the pyramid can be climb
we await you said the captain grave as we have been command
to do is it now your pleasur to see thi feat perform
it is answer khian moreov the climber will not lack a
present though i who am a scaler of mountain hold the thing to be
imposs
be pleas to stand back a littl wai and watch said the captain
then he and hi son threw off their long robe and cloth onli in a
linen garment about their middl ran to that pyramid which wa in
front of them and separ on son disappear to the north and the
other to the south while the father began to spring up the eastern
face as a goat spring up a precipic up he went high and higher
yet while khian watch amaz till at last he saw him gain the veri
crest lo as he did so there appear with him the two son who
unseen had travel thither by other road moreov present
there appear a fourth figur clad in white
who is the fourth exclaim khian but three start to climb and
now behold there ar four
ru stare at the top of the pyramid then answer stupidli
sure stare at those polish stone ha daze you lord i see
but three doubtless the captain and hi two son
khian look again and said
it is true that now i also see but three yet there were four he
ad obstin
present the climber began to descend follow on anoth down
the eastern face at length thei reach the ground safe and have
don their robe came to khian bow and ask him whether he
were now satisfi that the pyramid could be climb
i am satisfi that thi pyramid can be climb though of the other
i know noth he answer yet befor i give you the reward you
have earn so well tell me captain how it come about that you and
your son who were three at it base becam four upon it crest
what doe my lord mean ask the sheik grave
what i sai captain neither more nor less when you stood upon the
top yonder with the three of you wa a fourth a slender figur clad
in white i sweat it by all the god
it mai be so answer the sheik imperturb onli then as we
saw no on it must have been given to my lord to perceiv the spirit
of the pyramid herself who accompani us invis to our ey had
thi chanc when the full moon shine it would not have been so
wonder sinc then she is apt to wander or so it is report but
that he should have seen her in the light of dai is most strang and
portend we know not what
now khian began to ply the man and hi son with question about thi
spirit of the pyramid and whether she would be visibl if thei came
to look for her when the full moon shone but from them learn
noth sinc to everi question thei answer that thei did not know
next he inquir of them whether thei would teach him how to climb the
pyramid as thei did if he paid them well thei repli that except
by order of the council thei would not becaus the busi wa veri
danger and if aught happen to him hi blood would be on their
hand so in the end he made them a larg present for which thei
thank him with mani bow and just as the sun began to set
depart back to the templ
as thei went side by side khian who wa lost in thought and wonder
heard ru mutter
a second whom the god have smitten with the desir to climb the
pyramid who could have believ that there were two such mad peopl
in the world what doe it mean sure such folli must have a
mean for among my peopl the ethiopian thei sai that the
maddest ar alwai the most inspir
twice or thrice he mutter thu till at last khian ask him
suddenli
who then wa the other fool to whom the god gave the desir to
climb the pyramid wa she perchanc that on whom i saw stand
with the sheik and hi son upon yonder crest
no i think not answer the startl ru confusedli inde i am
sure not sinc todai she ha other busi to attend also i
should have known then he rememb and stop
so there is a ladi who love thi sport well i have heard as much
befor and friend ru as you seem to know her if you will arrang
that i can follow it in her compani you will find yourself grow
richer than you ar
here is the door to the templ answer ru with a grin and by
the wai the second prophet tau bade me to prai you to eat with him
and other thi night
i obei said khian hope in hi heart that on of those other
would be the love ladi whom he had seen crown as princess of
egypt yet thi wa not so for at that meal were onli tau and with
him three ag councillor who when thei had partaken sparingli
slip awai leav him and hi host togeth then these two began
to talk each of them seek knowledg of the other
soon khian learn that thi tau the second prophet of the order
though not egyptian by blood had been born to a high station and
great wealth he had been a warrior and a statesman also and it
seem might have becom a king either in cypru or syria where he
would not sai far and wide he had travel about the world
acquir the languag of mani peopl and much learn and
studi religion and philosophi yet in the end he had abandon
all and becom on of the priesthood of the dawn
khian ask him why he who as he understood might have sat upon a
throne and mingl with the great on of the earth while children
grew up about him had chosen instead to dwell in tomb with the
brethren of a secret order
would you learn then i will tell you answer tau i have done
thi becaus i seek peac peac for egypt and the world and peac for
my own soul and in pomp and govern there is no peac but onli
strive that for the most part end in war to win more wealth and
power that we do not need scribe rasa he ad look at him
keenli were you other than you ar a princ for instanc i think
that perhap had you instruct in our philosophi in the end you
might prove to be such anoth as i am or even as is roi the prophet
and turn your back upon what the world call great might
follow in thi same path of peac and servic
were i such a on priest tau it might be so though other road run
to peac through servic than those that lead there by monasteri or
tomb and each must follow that which li open to hi feet
that is true and well spoken scribe rasa
yet went on khian be athirst for knowledg i would learn of
these mysteri of your and of how their servant mai attain to thi
peac and help to call it down upon the world is it possibl while i
sojourn here that on could be found to instruct me in them
i think that it is possibl but of thi matter we will talk again
sleep well scribe rasa and take counsel with your heart befor you
enter on thi difficult path
then he rose and ru appear to lead khian back to hi chamber
chapter xi
the fall
on the follow morn khian wa inform by ru that order had been
sent to the captain of the pyramid to instruct him in the art of
scale them should he so desir so present accompani by ru he
went out and at the foot of the smallest of the pyramid found thi
man and hi son await him awhil later have been strip of
most of hi garment and remov hi sandal he began hi lesson
much as nefra had done with a rope ti about hi middl like her
be young activ and veri bold accustom to the scale of
height moreov he prove an apt pupil climb two third of the
height of the pyramid that is as far as he wa allow to go
turn about as nefra had done and descend again with but littl
help from hi guid yet troubl came for when he wa within some
forti feet of the ground to which the sheik who wa beneath him had
descend alreadi and there stood talk to ru khian call to him
abov who held the rope to throw it down as it wa no more need and
at the same time undid the noos from about hi middl
thu freed the rope slid awai but although khian did not notic
thi it caught upon the marbl but a littl below him continu hi
descent carelessli enough in set hi foot upon a certain knob of
thi marbl hi heel rest upon the rope that twist round beneath
hi weight caus him to slip and lose hi balanc
next instant he wa slide down the face of the pyramid and as he
slid he turn so that now hi head point toward the ground the
sheik saw as did ru togeth thei bound forward to catch him in
hi fall in a second he wa on them but the weight of hi bodi
struck between them forc them apart although thei grasp him as
he came do what thei would hi head hit the ground not so veri hard
inde but as it chanc where a stone fallen from the pyramid wa
hidden just beneath the sand and though he never felt the blow of a
sudden hi sens left him for he wa stun
when thei return dimli and as at a great distanc he heard a voic
speak though who spoke he could not see becaus hi eyelid seem
to be glu togeth with blood and for thi or some other reason
he wa unabl to open them
i think that he is not dead said the voic which in truth wa that
of a physician the neck doe not seem to be broken nor inde ani
limb therefor unless the skull is crack which i cannot discov
for the blood from the cut make search difficult i hold that he is
but stun and will come to himself in time
the god send that you ar right leech answer anoth voic a
woman voic that wa full of doubt and fear for three long hour
ha he lain senseless in thi tomb and so still that almost i
think oh see he stir hi hand he live he live feel hi
heart again
the physician did so and said
it beat more strongli troubl not ladi i believ that he will
recov
prai that he doe all of you went on the woman voic in which
now wa hope mingl with anger ill did you pyramidclimb guard
him who tangl the rope about hi feet as for you ru wa not your
great strength enough to hold so light a weight fall from but a
littl height
it seem not ladi answer the deep voic of ru see that thi
light weight of hi knock me down and the sheik with me and almost
tore my arm out of it socket full forti feet he came like a stone
from a sling
at thi moment khian open hi lip and veri faintli ask for water
it wa brought to him a soft hand lift hi head a vase wa held to
hi lip he drank sigh and swoon again
onc more he awok or wa awaken by the sharp pain that seem to
stab hi head from side to side now he could open hi ey and
look about him saw that he wa back in hi chamber at the templ
for upon a stool lai possess of hi own at the foot of the couch
a curtain had been drawn and beyond the curtain he heard two women
talk
how goe he kemmah ha he awaken ask a sweet voic that he
knew again for it wa the voic of the guid who had led him from the
palm grove the voic too of her whom he had seen crown as queen
of egypt
khian strove to lift hi head to look past the end of the curtain
but could not becaus hi neck wa stiff as a stone so he lai still
and listen hi heart beat for joi becaus thi fair royal ladi
had been at the pain to visit him that she might learn hi state
not yet child answer the ladi kemmah though it is true that it
is time he did the learn leech our brother said that he can find
no great hurt and that he should wake within twelv hour but twenti
have gone by and still he sleepsor swoon
oh kemmah do you think that he will die ask nefra in tone that
were full of fear
nai nai i hope not though when the head is hurt on never can be
sure it would be most sad for he is a fine man never did i see on
more perfect in bodi or more come in hi face though half hi blood
is that of the accurs shepherd
who told you about hi blood kemmah and whenc it sprang
the bird of the air or the blow wind ar you the last to learn
what all here knowthat thi guest of our is no palac scribe or
offic but the princ khian himself who if you take apepi as a
husband will be your stepson
have done with your talk of apepi on whom be the curs of all the
god of egypt and of hi own as well for the rest i guess but i
did not know though i wa sure that thi rasa could be no common man
save him kemmah for if he diesoh what am i sai come let me
look on him as he sleep there can be no harm and i will make the
sign of health upon hi brow and prai for hi recoveri to the spirit
that we worship
well then be swift for if the leech or tau should come thei might
think it strang to find the queen of egypt in a sick man chamber
still have your wai but be swift i will keep watch without
now although khian shut hi ey close so that he could see noth
with hi ear he heard the curtain drawn asid heard too a light
footfal by hi bed more he felt soft finger make a sign upon hi
brow a loop it seem to be with a line drawn through it perchanc
the loop of life then she who had drawn the sign seem to lean over
him and set her lip close to hi face to murmur holi word of
which he could not catch the drift or mean and as she murmur
ever those lip drew closer to hi own till at length for on second
thei touch hi own and swiftli were withdrawn then came a sigh and
silenc
now khian open hi ey to see other ey gaze down at him and
in them tear
where am i what ha chanc he ask faintli i dream that i
wa dead and that some daughter of the god breath new life into me
oh now i rememb my foot turn on that accurs rope and be
careless and oversur i fell it matter not soon i shall be strong
again and then i swear that i will climb those pyramid on by on
more swiftli than doe the spirit who inhabit them
hush hush murmur nefra nurs come here thi sick on is
awak and speak though foolishli
soon he will be asleep again for good if you stai at hi side talk

either have you not had enough of pyramid both of you would that
those vain fool of king had never built them to bring troubl to the
greater fool who come after

begon child and bid ru bring the leech and swiftli went on
kemmah
with on quick glanc at khian nefra glide awai kemmah watch her
go sai to herself as she turn to minist to him
how strang a thing is love that can send so mani to their death or
by it strength draw the dy back to life again but of the love of
these two what will be born
then she gave khian milk to drink and bade him lie still and silent
yet he would not obei who have drunk ask her dreamili

know that thei ar not the same thing i will tell youperhapswhen
i have climb those pyramid by the light of the full moon
which ha alreadi shone interrupt kemmah angrili
there ar more full moon to come nurs the sky is as peopl with
full moon unborn as the sea is with oyster that will be eaten and
the pyramid will stand for a long while to welcom climber
answer khian faintli
to set with the pyramid and with your silli talk burst out kemmah
stamp her foot then she ceas note that khian had onc more
swoon awai
a fool she thought to herself as she ran to find help inde the
first of fool who would hunt a ghost when the loveliest of flesh and
blood li to hi hand yet were i thirti year younger i think that i
might find it in my heart to go mad with thi spiritseek fool as
i think also anoth is in the wai of do what did he sai that in
search for the spirit he might find the woman well perhap he
will perhap after all thi moonstruck princ is not such a fool as
he seem perhap those who climb the pyramid find joi at the top of
them and joi is better than wisdom so at least some come to believ
when we grow old and have left it far behind
veri soon khian who wa young and strong and though shaken by the
shock of hi fall as the physician said quit unhurt in hi brain or
hi bone rose recov from hi bed inde within five dai onc
more he wa climb the pyramid by the help of the captain and hi
son for it would seem that thi passion had grown upon him dure
hi swoon also that swoon when he shook off the last of it left no
memori of what he had said or done while it endur from the moment
when he set hi foot upon the cord and slip until at last he rose
from hi bed he rememb noth not even the visit of nefra to
hi chamber or hi talk with kemmah though it is true that these came
back to him in after dai so where he had left off there he began
again name on the slope of the pyramid which veri soon he
master as in due time he did the other like nefra befor him
dai by dai from dawn until the sun grew too hot for the work he
labour at those pyramid so hard that at last the captain and hi
son were almost outworn and declar that thei had to do with a
devil not a man yet thei spoke well of him as did all other
hold that he who after such a fall dare to persever and conquer
must be greatheart for thei did not understand that from the
moment of hi slip of hi fall he rememb noth
meanwhil though he knew it not at the court of king apepi it wa
believ that he wa dead the tide of hi fall from the pyramid
and it wa ad of hi death for dead he seem to be had
overtaken that messeng a brother of the dawn name temu who bore
the answer from the council of the dawn and khian own letter as he
embark upon the nile and he had spread it abroad and carri it to
the court at tani when apepi heard thi new he wa griev in a
fashion sinc he had love hi son a littl at least when he wa
younger though not much becaus in hi fierc and selfish heart there
wa small room for ani love save of himself
soon howev hi grief wa swallow up in wrath at that which wa
written in the letter from the brotherhood of the dawn which he swore
to destroi root and branch unless nefra whom thei had dare to crown
queen of egypt were given to him in marriag moreov he believ
that khian had not come to hi end by a chanc tumbl from the
pyramid but that he had been done to death at the decre of thi
brotherhood that the heir to the crown of the north might be remov
becaus he stood in the path of her who had been consecr queen of
all egypt but of all these thing apepi wrote noth to the council
of the dawn inde he seiz their messeng temu and kept him in
a safe place where he could commun with none and meanwhil made
certain plan and prepar
dure the week which follow hi recoveri khian did more than climb
the pyramid thu he receiv instruct in the faith and worship of
the brotherhood of the dawn as it had been promis that he should
do in the even in a littl lamplit hall he wa taught by tau
or by roi the prophet or sometim by both of them togeth
moreov he share thi instruct with anoth pupil nefra the
neophyt
there he sat at on end of a tabl with ink and papyru in front of
him while at the other end with kemmah behind her and the gigant
ru stand in the shadow as a guard and sentinel sat the young queen
simpli cloth in white as a neophyt should be so place that he
could see her face in the rai of the lamp and she could see hi and
yet too far awai for them to talk togeth at the centr of the tabl
in carv seat sat roi and tau or on of them expound the secret
mysteri of their order and from time to time ask or answer
question
so pure and beauti wa the faith thei taught that veri soon it
possess the heart of khian in it outlin it wa simpl that of
the exist of on great spirit of whose attribut all the god
thei knew were minist a spirit who for it own purpos sent them
forth into the world whenc in due time it would draw them back
again moreov these holi and learn men taught their pupil of
those purpos declar that the greatest of them wa to promot
peac upon the earth and to do good to all that breath yet there
were other part of thi doctrin which were not so plain and easi
for these had to do with the method by which that spirit could be
approach of those who still dwelt upon the earth with form of
prayer and hidden rite also that would bring the worship into
communion with the worshipp further there were mani rule of life
and great principl of polit and govern all of which were a
part of the law
khian hearken and found thi doctrin good for therein wa that
which fed if as yet it did not satisfi hi hungri soul on a certain
dai at the end of the last lesson he rose and said
o holi prophet roi and tau i accept your teach i would be sworn
as the humblest of the brethren of the order of the dawn onli for a
certain reason which i must keep secret of your tempor polit i
sai noth either good or ill neither do i bind myself to them in
the spirit i am your in the flesh and for the purpos of the flesh
as yet i am the slave of other is it enough
roi and tau consult togeth while nefra watch them curious and
khian sat lost in thought hi head bow between hi hand at length
the old prophet spoke sai
son the time you can give to studi and prepar be short and
your heart be set upon the truth it is enough here in these tomb
also we learn mani thing and amongst them that men ar not alwai
what thei seem to be thu it well mai chanc that by blood birth
and duti you ar bound with chain you cannot break even to satisfi
your soul it well mai chanc moreov that it is not for you to
take the vow of celibaci and abstin or to swear that you will
lift no sword in war sinc perhap it is decre that your mission in
the world must be otherwis fulfil further what we sai to you we
sai to our sister who with you ha listen to the word of life her
feet also ar set upon a road that is high and difficult therefor
exempt both of you from much to which other must bow their head
tomorrow we will absolv you from your sin swear you to our
precept to break which will bring a curs upon your soul and
number you among our compani in earth and heaven
so it came about that on the next dai at a great ceremoni in the
templ hall khian the princ and nefra the queen receiv at the
hand of roi the ancient absolut of all evil that thei had thought
or done and thereaft were sworn as full member of the order of the
dawn vow themselv to accept it law as their guid star and to
pursu it holi end etern separ thei knelt befor it
whiterob high priest while far off on the confin of the great
hall and out of hear of their speech the brethren watch them as
wit and receiv forgiv and benedict with word of
whisper counsel then withdrew and seat themselv side by side
while all that compani chant the ancient hymn of welcom to their
soul reborn by slow degre the loud triumphant music grew less and
di awai as head by roi those who sang depart from the templ
till at last there wa a great silenc and in the silenc thei sat
alon
khian look about him and note that even ru and kemmah were gone in
that great and solemn place thei were quit alon stare at by the
cold statu of god and ancient king
khian look at nefra and ask
of what ar you think sister
i am think brother that i have heard wonder word and
receiv holi bless which should have chang me from a sin
maiden into a saint like roi and that yet i feel much the same as i
did befor
ar you sure that roi is so great a saint sister i have seen him
onc or twice grow wrath like other also doe the absenc of
temptat of which there can be littl after nineti make a saint
for the rest doubtless you feel as you did befor becaus it is not
possibl for snow to grow whiter than snow
or fire hotter than fire but have done brother is thi a time or
place for pretti speech hearken for as we ar now both bound in
the bond of the same great oath we can speak our mind to each other
fear no betray these rite have chang me littl if at all
who alwai have known the doctrin of the dawn that from childhood
were instil into my heart although until i attain my present
ag under it law i could not be admit to the full fellowship of
the order behold i am still no spirit but a woman as befor full of
mortal purpos thu she ad slowli consid him with her
larg ey my father wa slain by on i hold to be the usurp of
hi right on too who i think would have murder me if he
could and for those deed i desir to repai him also to them of late
he ha ad deadli insult for now thi slayer of my father and
wouldb murder seek to take me the orphan child in marriag
and for that affront too i would repai him
bad veri bad sister answer khian shake hi head sadli
perhap to hide a certain twitch of the corner of hi mouth but
if i mai ask did you confess these black sin to the holi prophet
roi and if so what did he sai of them sister
i did brother who could think of noth els to confess or at
least not much and what he answer make me believ that you ar
right in hold that the holi roi is still not so holi as he might
be he said brother that such thought were born of my ancient blood
and natur and that it wa right that those who commit great
crime for cold base purpos should suffer for the crime and that
if i were the mean of bring punish upon thi man it would be
becaus it had been so decre by heaven therefor he did not set me
down as sin in thi matter but enough tell me brother if it
pleas you do you find yourself chang at heart
i find my feet set upon a better and a higher road sister for now i
know what to worshipi who worship noth becaus i could believ
in nothingalso how thi new god should be worship for the rest
no on kill my father or sought to murder me and therefor i do not
wish to be aveng upon ani oneat present yet sister and he
paus
i am listen brother who feel sure that you cannot be quit so
good as you would have me understand
good no i am not good i onli hope to becom good if i can find
someon to help meno not roi or tau or kemmah or the whole
council of the dawnsomeon quit differ
a goddess from on high suggest nefra
ye that is well saida goddess from on highw will talk of her
present but first what i want to sai is that in follow after
righteous i have fallen into a veri deep pit
what pit brother ask nefra look up at the roof of the
templ
on out of which i think you alon can help me but i must explain
first you should know that i am a liar i am not the scribe rasa the
scribe rasa an excel man and a master of hi trade di mani
year ago when i wa a boi i am and he hesit
the princ khian son of apepi and heir appar to the crown of
the north suggest nefra
ye you have got it quit right except that i do not think i am ani
longer heir appar or at ani rate i shall soon ceas to be so but
mai i ask sister how you came to know my style and titl
we know everyth in the hous of the dawn brother also as it
chanc you told me them yourself when you were sickor wa it
kemmah
then it wa veri wrong of you to listen sister and i hope that you
confess that sin with the other well now perhap you see the pit
the princ khian the onli law son of king apepiat presentha
been sworn a member of the order of the dawn which order it is the
purpos of king apepi to destroi as is not wonder king be
what thei ar see that it ha just crown a certain ladi queen of
egypt and therebi in a sens declar war against him the usurp
now tell me what can i do who on the on hand am the princ khian and
on the other someth much higher and bettera brother of the order
of the dawn
the answer is simpl brother you must make peac between apepi and
the order of the dawn
inde and how by prai a certain sister to becom the queen of
king apepi thu onli can such a peac be made as you know well
i never said it answer nefra flush moreov it doe not
pleas me to listen to such counseleven from a brother
nor would it pleas even a brother to give such counsel for if it
were taken that brother would soon be number among those who make
their prayer and swing their censer in the heavenli shrine whereof
we ar instruct in the mysteri
why ask nefra innoc if he gave it not i could understand
for then a certain king might be wrath but if he gave it why
becaus then a certain queen might be wrath on who as you sister
have told me love vengeanc or at least becaus he himself if
that counsel were taken would be so weari of the world that he could
tread it no more
now for a while there wa silenc between them and beneath the shadow
of their white hood each of them sat stare at the ground
sister said khian at last and as she made no answer repeat in a
louder voic sister
forgiv me i had almost fallen asleep after last night vigil
what is it brother
onli thi would you be mind to help a poor princ out of the pit
of which i have spoken by drag him up with a silken rope ofwel
of love which all member of thi compani ow to on anotherand
make him a king
a king a king of what of these tomb and the dead in them
oh no of your heart and the life in it hearken nefra togeth we
mai stand against my father apepi but apart we must fall for when he
come to learn the truth he will kill me and if he can lai hi hand
on you drag you whither you do not wish to go moreov i love you
nefra from the moment when i heard your voic yonder by the palm
tree and knew you for a woman beneath your cloak i love you though
then i thought you but some simpl girl what more is there to sai
the futur is dark great danger lie ahead mayhap it will be
necessari to fly to far land and leav all these pomp behind us yet
togeth would thei not be well lost
then what of egypt princ khian what of egypt and the mission laid
upon me and the oath you heard me swear in thi veri hall
i do not know he answer confusedli the road is dark yet with
love to light our feet we shall find a wai sai that you love me and
all will be well
sai that i love you the son of him who slew my father that murder
who seek to make me hi how can i sai thi princ khian
if you love me nefra you can sai it becaus it will be the truth
and have we not heard that to hide the truth is the greatest of sin
do you love me
i cannot answer i will not answer ask it of the sphinx nai ask it
of the spirit of the pyramid and by her word i will abid for that
spirit is my spirit on dai still remain to us ask it tomorrow of
the spirit of the pyramid if you dare to seek and find her beneath
the moon
then suddenli she rose and fled awai leav him alon and wonder
chapter xii
the spirit of the pyramid
that night khian slept littl hi thought would not let him sleep
thei fill hi mind with problem and as in a mirror show him the
pitfal that lai about hi feet he the princ of the north wa
sworn a brother of the order of the dawn which hi father the king
threaten to destroi and how did these two offic agre could he
smite with the on hand and defend with the other nai it wa
imposs therefor he must ceas either to be a princ or to be a
brother there hi path wa clear let the rank go inde had it not
alreadi been taken awai from him with hi own consent therefor why
should he troubl about it now henceforth he wa noth but brother
khian of the order of the dawn nai he wa someth morean
ambassador who await a certain answer which must be convei to the
king who sent him on hi mission it wa as to a matter of marriag
as to whether a royal ladi would becom the wife of that king or would
choos to face hi wrath
here again hi task wa easi he must deliv the answer whatev it
might be after which hi duti came to an end and he would remain
noth more than a brother of the order of the dawn and perhap a
princ if that answer were such as the king desir then doubtless
he the ambassador would be allow to go hi wai in peac though
no more as heir to the throne of the north but if it were veri
differ if for exampl it announc that thi ladi refus the
king in favour of the ambassador who chanc to be hi sonwhat why
deathno lessdeath or flight
yet at thi thought khian wa not dismai he even smile a littl as
it cross hi mind rememb the teach of hi new philosophi
that all wa in the hand of heaven and that naught happen save that
which must happen he did not desir to die who now had so much for
which to live but if death came that philosophi taught him not to be
afraid nor did he write himself down a traitor to hi duti becaus
he knew that in ani case nefra would have refus thi monstrou
marriag of which she had spoken to him as an insult moreov as
yet he did not know that ani thought of him would weigh with her he
had offer her hi love but she had not accept thi gift she had
said that she could not answer that he must ask the spirit of the
pyramid whether she nefra the queen love or did not love him
khian the princ what could such word mean there wa no spirit of
the pyramid everywher he had inquir of thi legend and learn
that it wa built of air how could he ask of a spirit that which a
woman refus to tell and where should he find thi oracl
he wa told to seek it by the light of the full moon among the ancient
grave well that on hi part noth might be lack he would seek
like ani simpl fool and if he found noth would understand that
noth wa hi answer then seek no more he would demand from
roi the write that he must bear to king apepi and depart sore
heart to accomplish it deliveri thi done he would abid the wrath
of the king and should he escap would wander awai to such distant
place as roi or the council might appoint and there preach the
doctrin of the dawn or do such thing as he wa command turn
hi heart from woman and the joi of life
soon he would know soon all would be finish in thi wai or in that
for on the morrow of the night of full moon the young queen must give
her answer to the demand of apepi and he the ambassador must bear
that answer back to tani meanwhil thi wa certainh who had
never love befor worship the maiden nefra with bodi and with
spirit and abov all earthli thing desir her as hi wife so much
so that if he were to lose her he care not what els he might lose
even to life itself
it wa the appoint time and khian quit alon for as an admit
brother now he could pass where he would unquest and unwatch
wander to and fro among the tomb which surround the greatest of
the pyramid he wa sadheart who believ hi to be but a fool
errand moreov all hi troubl weigh upon hi soul the vast
solemn of the place too with it endless street of grave abov
which the pyramid tower etern crush him what a spot wa
thi for a love quest here surround by the monument which told of
the end of all human thing hundr of year ago those who slept
within these tomb had ceas from mortal love and hate and as thei
were soon he would be also perchanc befor anoth full moon shone
in yonder sky he wonder whether thei look upon him now with calm
invis ey not on but ten thousand spirit of the pyramid
he sat him down upon a stone in the midst of that deep silenc which
wa onli broken from time to time by the melancholi howl of some
jackal seek food and watch the shadow creep across the sand at
length grow weari he cover hi face with hi hand and brood
on the mysteri of all thing as wa natur in such a place and
whenc men came and whither thei must go a problem that not even roi
could solv
he heard noth yet suddenli why he did not know he wa move to
let fall hi hand and look about him sure someth stir yonder
in the shadow of a great tomb perhap it wa a nighthaunt beast
nai it seem too tall it came out of that shadow and for a moment
could be seen flit to the shelter of anoth tomb where it
vanish sure it wa a whiteveil woman or a ghost
khian wa frighten hi hair rose upon hi head yet spring to
hi feet he follow it he came to the tomb where it had disappear
it wa gone nai there it wa far awai shape a cours it would
seem toward the second pyramid that of the pharaoh khafra again he
follow but fast as he went that figur went faster now hidden and
now seen so that when at length it reach the north face of the
second pyramid call urkhafra or greatest khafra it wa a
spear cast in front of him
sure he thought it would halt there but it did not it began to
glide up the face of the pyramid and then at the height of a tall
palm tree it disappear
now khian more than onc had climb thi second pyramid by it
northern face and knew that there wa no open in it therefor it
would seem that what he had seen wa inde a ghost which had melt
awai as ghost ar said to do still to satisfi himself though
fearfulli he climb after it and when he had scale some fifti feet
of the steep side stop astonish for behold there in the
pyramid wa what seem to be an open door beyond which a passag ran
downward moreov in that passag lamp were set at a distanc from
each other he hesit for he wa much afraid but at length
think to himself that ghost need no lamp and that but on man or
woman had enter in front of him he grew courag and follow
for some five and thirti pace thi passag ran downward steepli
between wall of granit then for anoth thirti pace it ran on upon
the level end at last in a larg chamber hewn from the live rock
and roof with great paint slab of stone lean against each
other to bear the mighti weight of the pyramid abov in thi darksom
place sunk into the rock stood a sarcophagu of granit and naught
els
khian crept down the passag by the light of the lamp hi footstep
echo against their wall of stone and from the shelter of a huge
halfopen granit door peep into the tomb chamber it wa lit by
on lamp that stood upon the sarcophagu whereof the feebl rai shone
like a star in the black gloom of the vault hall thi gloom he
search with hi ey in vain he could see no on the veil shape
he had follow wa not or perchanc it had depart by some farther
door into the bowel of the pyramid
mutter a prayer for protect against the spirit of the pharaoh
upon whose rest he broke and draw hi bronz sword lest he should
find that he had been lure into thi dread place by evildo
khian crept forward through the gloom veri carefulli for there might
be pitfal in the rocki floor come at length to the sarcophagu he
stood irresolut for of a sudden hi courag seem to fail him
what if in truth he had been follow a ghost and that ghost should
spring upon him from behind nai he would be brave did ghost set
lamp in nich their shape show that thei were ancient lamp it
wa true perhap the same that were us by the builder of the
pyramid a thousand year befor or by those who bore the bodi of the
king to it last rest place yet lamp did not burn etern
unless inde thei were ghostli lamp the oil in them must be new and
set there by human hand the thought gave him courag and he stood
still who had medit flight there wa a sound at the far end of
the hall a rustl sound that check the beat of hi heart in
the dark appear a cloud of white which float forward the
ghost wa upon him
he stood where he wasperch becaus he could not stir the white
veil shape drew near and halt now onli the width of the tomb wa
between them and he stare at it over the flame of the lamp but could
see noth becaus the face wa cover like the face of on new
dead in hi terror he lift the sword as though to stab at thi
unearthli thing then a soft voic spoke sai
o seeker of the spirit of the pyramid would you greet her with a
swordthrust and if so why
becaus i am afraid he answer that which is veil is alwai
terribl especi in such a place as thi
as he spoke the veil fell and in the lamplight he saw the form and
the beauti flush face of nefra
what is the mean of thi plai o queen he ask faintli
doe khian the heir of the king of the north name me queen she
ask in a mock voic well if so he is right sinc here abov
the bone of him who histori tell wa my forefath and of whose
throne i am the heritor so i should be call princ khian you
sought the spirit of the pyramid who never wa except in fabl and
you have found a queen who is both flesh and spirit if still you have
aught to sai to her speak on sinc time is short and soon she mai be
miss
i have noth to sai except what i have said alreadi nefra i love
you well and i would learn of you whether you love me i prai you plai
with me no more but let me hear the truth
it is short and simpl she answer rais her head and look
straight into hi ey khian if you love me well i love you
better for of thi treasur woman ha more to give than man
hi mind reel beneath the weight of her word and hi bodi with it
so that he must rest hi hand upon the stone of the tomb to save
himself from fall yet hi first thought wa angri and broke from
hi lip in a sharp question
if that be so nefra what need to bring me to thi dread place of
death to tell me that it is so what need to make me follow a dream
and a ghost that i might find a woman sure the jest is ill
conceiv
not so much so as you think khian she answer gentli yesterdai
i could not tell you what i long to speak becaus be what i am
i must lai the matter befor other i who am not a mistress of
myself but the servant of a caus therefor i sought time till i had
learn that what i desir wa the will of those who ar set abov me
and as thei declar of heaven which is set abov them had it been
otherwis you would have seen no spirit of the pyramid tonight and
no queen nefra er you depart tomorrow morn and thu would have
had your answer which i should have been spare the pain of speak
then roi and the rest approv nefra
ay thei approv inde it seem that from the first thei hope
for thi and therefor brought us togeth as much as might be
becaus thei trust that so egypt mai onc more be unit and that thu
their polici mai prosper through our love
much must happen befor that can be said khian sadli
i know it khian great danger threaten us inde i think that
thei ar near it is for thi reason that plai the part of a
ghost i have led you to thi ancient sepulchr believ of all to be
haunt by the dead that you mai learn it secret and at need make of
it your hide place khian now i will show you the trick of the door
in the case of the pyramid reveal to me by right of birth and to
certain other by right of offic for from gener to gener
thi secret ha descend as an inherit in the famili of the
captain of the pyramid who ar sworn not to disclos it even under
tortur look khian
lift the lamp nefra held it abov her head and point to the end
of the tomb chamber where by it light he saw a larg number of great
jar set against the wall
those vessel she ad ar fill with wine oil grain dri
flesh corn and other sort of food also nearer to the entranc as
i will show you ar more jar of water which from time to time is
renew so that here a man or inde sever men might live for
month and yet not starv
the god defend me from such a fate he said dismai
ay khian yet who know that jackal is safest which ha a hole to
run to when it hunter ar afoot
sooner would i be kill in the open than go mad here in the dark
with the dead for fellowship he answer doubtfulli
nai khian you must not be kill now you must live onfor me and
egypt
she set down the lamp in it place and move to the foot of the tomb
he did likewis so that there thei met and stood a littl while
gaze at each other in the midst of a silenc that wa so deep that
thei could hear the beat of their heart speech had left them as
though thei had no more word to sai yet their ey spoke in a
languag of their own thei bent toward each other like windswai
palm nearer and nearer yet till of a sudden she lai in hi arm and
her lip were press upon hi own
belov he said present swear that while i live you will wed no
man but me
she lift her head from hi shoulder and look at him with her larg
and beauti ey that were aswim with tear
is it need she ask in a new voic a deep rich voic you
have littl faith khian and i ask no such oath from you
becaus it would be foolish nefra for who have love you could
turn to other yet there ar mani who will seek the fairest ladi on
the earth and egypt queen inde ha not on sought her alreadi
therefor i prai you swear
so be it i swear by the spirit that we worship both of us i swear
by egypt which if roi be right we shall rule in the dai to come
and i swear by the bone of my forefath who sleep within thi tomb
that i will wed none but you khian while you live i will be faith
to you and if you die then swiftli i will follow you that what we
have lost on earth we mai find in the underworld if i break thi my
oath then mai i becom as is he who sleep beneath my hand todai
and she touch the tomb with her finger ay mai my name be
blot from the roll of egypt royal on and mai set take my spirit
as hi slave is it enough o faithless khian
enough and more than enough oh how shall i thank you who have given
life to my heart how shall i serv you whom i ador
she shook her head make no answer but he loos her from hi
arm sank to hi knee befor her he abas himself as a slave he
lift the hem of her robe and kiss it sai
queen of my heart and right queen of egypt i khian worship you
and do you homag whatev i have or mai have i set beneath your
feet acknowledg your majesti henceforth i your lover who hope to
be your husband am the humblest of your subject
she bent down and rais him
nai she said smile when onc more he stood upon hi feet you
ar greater than i and it is the woman who serv the man not the man
the woman well we will serv each other and thu be equal but
khian what of apepi who is your father
i do not know he answer yet father or not i prai that he mai
not try to come between us
i prai so also khian tonight is happi never wa there so happi a
night but tomorrowoh what of tomorrow
it is in the hand of god nefra therefor let us fear noth
ay khian but often the path of god ar steep and rough or so my
father and my mother found like us thei love each other well yet
thi apepi wa their doom come we must go for ala all sweet
thing have their end
so onc more thei clung and kiss and then hand in hand went down
the darksom wai of that hous of death to the moonlit world without
when thei had climb the steep ascent and were come to the mouth of
the passag nefra stop and by the light of the last lamp for she
had extinguish the other as thei went taught khian how by
press a certain stone which swung upon a pivot the place could be
close at will and if need were made fast from within by the aid of
a bar and pin of granit which the builder of the pyramid had us
to shut out the curiou while thei went about their work upon the
secret burial chamber at it heart also she show him a great
hang door of granit that those who brought the pharaoh to hi
burial a thousand year befor had forgotten or neglect to let fall
as thei depart leav him to hi etern rest
see she said if that wedg of stone were knock awai the great
door would fall therefor touch it not lest we should be shut into
thi pyramid of ur and lai our bone with those of the mighti khafra
it architect look yonder in that nich where perhap onc stood
the priest or soldier who wa guardian of the door ar the jar of
water of which i spoke and by them oil and lamp and wick of reed
and fuel and mean of rais fire with other need thing
have shown him all and made sure that he understood nefra quench
the last lamp and set it in the nich then thei crept out on to the
side of the pyramid where thrice she made khian close and open the
swing stone until he had master the trick of it after which
with a wedg of marbl that fit in a socket hollow to receiv it
and yet could be withdrawn in a moment she made the stone fast so
that now none could tell it from those around unless thei had the
secret and knew in which cours of the case block it lai thi
done thei descend to the ground just by a fallen block that mark
where the seeker for the swing stone must mount cross the
pave that surround the pyramid thei reach the templ of the
worship of khafra to the east and kept in it shadow lest thei should
be seen by some night wander here too thei part with sweet
murmur word of farewel nefra take on path homeward and khian
anoth
slowli he made hi wai through the vast moonlit wilder of tomb
hi heart fill with a great joi for had he not won all that he
desir yet with thi joi wa mingl fear of what the morrow might
bring forth then would be hand to him the ambassador the written
answer of nefra to the demand of apepi hi father that she should
give herself to him in marriag now he knew well what that answer
would be but what he did not know wa how apepi would receiv him
when as duti demand he deliv it to him there wa but on hope
that he might prove content that hi son should wed thi queen
without a throne instead of himself see that the reason of such a
marriag wa polit and noth els and he khian wa hi
father heir had apepi seen nefra almost certainli thing would
befal otherwis for he knew hi father natur and that he would
desir to possess himself of beauti such as her happili howev he
had not seen her and therefor might be content to let her go who wa
naught to him if he could secur her heritag for the hous of the
shepherd king
yet khian doubt whether event would thu shape themselv it well
might be that when he learn as learn he would certainli through hi
spi or otherwis that hi son wa betroth to the high ladi whom
he had sought for himself that he would hold that hi son who wa
also hi ambassador had plai the traitor to him which in a sens
wa true if so he might be veri wrath and terribl in hi rage who
wa cruelheart moreov he might desir vengeanc what
vengeanc perhap the death of the traitor no less and if still she
would not marri him the death of nefra also for wa she not egypt
law queen and while she live could he sit safe upon hi stolen
throne
as he pick hi wai among the tomb by the moonlight khian knew in
hi heart that he and death were face to face dark imagin
possess him almost could he see that grisli shape stalk ahead of
him while wrap in the long hood cloak that he us as a
disguis hi shadow cast by the moonlight on the sand to hi sight
took the veri shape of osiri in hi mummi wrappingsy of osiri
the god of death yet if so wa not osiri also the god of
resurrect and the king of life etern if inde doom await him
and nefra at least beyond the grave lai joi and peac for thousand
of thousand of year
so roi taught and so he believ still come fresh from the lip of
hi love those warm and human lip with her sweet word echo in
hi ear he shiver at these sad and solemn thought for who could
be sure of what lai over the edg of the world oh who could be quit
sure
khian came to the privat door of the templ of the sphinx as he
approach it from beneath it arch appear the gigant shape of ru
who look at him with curiou ey
have you been seek the spirit of the pyramid lord that you
wander abroad so late
who els ask khian
and did you find her lord and look upon her face that men sai is so

do you swear thi khian
i swear it nefra also that as you ar to me so i will be to you
then with murmur word of love again thei clung and kiss till
soon at a sign for she could speak no more khian loos her from
hi arm he loos her he bow to her and she bow back to him
then he went at the doorwai he turn to look on her there robe in
the virgin white of the sister of the dawn wear no ornament or
mark of rank and yet look most royal she stood still as a statu
gaze after him while on by on the heavi tear well from her deep
ey anoth instant and like some gate of doom the door swung to
behind him and she wa seen no more
in hi chamber khian found tau the second prophet of the order
await him
i come to tell you princ that your ship is readi at the river
bank to which your good with the present sent by king apepi have
been born he said ad ru will escort you thither
ye tau but who will escort me back he ask sigh heavili i
feel like on who ha dream a happi dream and awaken to the world
and know it but a dream which will never be fulfil
take courag princ for i hold otherwis yet i will not hide from
you that the peril of all of us is great we learn that apepi mass
troop as he sai to protect himself against the babylonian who
threaten him but who can be certain i would that we had question
that messeng as wa my purpos but he slip awai while we thought
that he wa wait for our letter
so would i tau but he is gone and now it is too late
princ went on tau in a low voic it mai be that for a while the
order of the dawn and with it a certain ladi must vanish from egypt
yet if thi come about do not believ that we ar lost or dead who
shall but have gone to seek help whenc as yet i mai not reveal even
to you though perchanc you mai guess we hate war and bloodsh
princ but if these ar forc upon us we shall fight or certainli
i shall fight who in my youth wa as you ar a soldier and have
command armi therefor rememb that while i live and inde
while a brother or sister of the dawn live throughout the world and
as you saw on the night of the crown thei ar mani dwell in
mani land that ladi will not lack a defend or a home and now
farewel till perchanc in a dai to come i see you and that ladi wed
and afterward crown as king and queen of the land of the nile
reign from the cataract to the sea again brother fare you
well
onc more khian walk across the stretch of desert that lai between
the sphinx and the palm grove by the bank of the nile but thi time
hi companion wa no hood youth with the voic and the hand of a
woman but the ethiopian ru who as he went address him in a kind
of soliloqui after thi sort
so lord you realli ar the princ khian as rumour said and the
ladi kemmah and i guess from the first and now you ar affianc to
my queen for which i hate you becaus ever sinc you came she ha
hardli had a look or a word for me yet to be honest as such thing
must happen i would rather it wa to you than to ani on els
becaus you ar a soldier and i like you also a man of courag as
you show when you learn to climb those pyramid which i should
never have dare to do so i shall be glad to serv you when you ar
marri though if you do not treat my queen well bewar of thi ax
for then if you were fifti pharaoh and a hundr god with it i
would still cleav you to the chin no doubt you think that you ar
veri clever to win her love as certainli you have done but there you
ar mistaken you did not win her love and she did not win your it
wa those old priest of the dawn who arrang everyth and by their
magic threw a spell upon both of you becaus thei wish to bring all
thi about for purpos of their own believ me that as thei have
join you togeth so thei can separ you if thei choos and by
their incant make you hate each other onli i dont think thei
will as that would not suit them and you see you ar both of you
member of the order of the dawn and therefor will be support by
them in all thing that you mai desir
i am glad to hear that interrupt khian when at length ru paus
to take breath
ye ye lord it is a veri good thing to be on of the order or
even it servant as i am becaus then everywher you have a friend
therefor never be afraid howev desper your case mai be even if
the hangman is put hi rope about your neck for certainli roi or
anoth far awai will utter on of the spell or speak a word of
power and someon will appear to help you that is why i am quit
sure that in the end you will marri my queen if both of you continu
to want each other and that all of us will escap from the jaw of
that roar lion your father the king apepi although he doe think
that he ha our head in hi mouth
how will you all escap ru
why lord by find friend who ar stronger than apepi there is
the king of babylon for instanc our ladi grandfath who can put
two spearmen in the field for everi on of apepi to sai noth of
a multitud of chariot drawn by hors which apepi ha not got the
order ha plenti of brother at the court of the king of babylon some
of them were here on the night of the crown and i know that
messag have been go to them almost everi dai never mind how thei
wentthat a secret i should not wonder if we went too befor
long and then perhap i mai see some more fight befor i grow too
old and fat to us my ax as you ar affianc to our queen i do not
mind talk of these thing to you
no of cours you dont answer khian
talk of messag remind me of messeng went on ru or rather
of on messeng i mean that fellow who came from apepi thi morn
and slip awai afterward which he would never have done had i been
guard him instead of those silli priest
what of him ask khian
oh onli that he wa a queer sort of fellow and more i think than
he seem to be did you see hi ey lord it wa like that of a
hawk veri proud too such an ey as a great nobl might have and
when he heard the queen answer it grew full of rage and all hi
bodi shook beneath those shawl morether were other strang
thing thu when he came to the hall he limp as though he were
veri lame but some peopl who were work in the field told me that
thei saw him run down to the nile like a hunt jackal
now how can a lame man run like a jackal also i hear that when he
came to the boat which wa wait for him those who were in the boat
or watch on the shore prostrat themselv as though he were some
great on but he leapt aboard and curs them call them slave
as a great on doe that is why i think he wa more than he seem to
be just like yourself lord who were announc as the scribe rasa
and yet ar realli the princ khian but here we ar at the palm grove
where more than a month ago i stole your baggag while you were
asleep as the queen who wa onli a princess then put it into my
head to do for from childhood she ha love such jest and look
there is your ship the same that brought you hither and there ar
the priest with your packag
ye ru there thei all ar who i wish were somewher els and now
here is a present for you ru a chain of fine gold that i have worn
myself keep it in memori of me and hang it about your neck when you
attend upon the queen that it mai make her think of on who is
absent
i thank you lord though it seem that you seek to kill two bird
with thi stone of a gift which i mai show but mai not sell well
lover will think of themselv first and i hope that on dai if we
should stand togeth in war why look here come the ladi
kemmah walk faster than i have seen her do for year i think she
must have some word for you
as he spoke kemmah arriv
so i have caught you princ she said puf a pretti task for
an old woman to toil across that sand in the heat like a cow after a
lost calf just to pleas a maiden fanci
what is it kemmah ask khian anxious
oh littl enough to give you thi which a certain on might as well
have done herself had she thought of it and to prai you to wear it
alwai for her sake rememb that therebi she acknowledg you as
her king as well as her lover which of cours she ha no right to do
ani more than she ha a right to send you what she doe i told her so
but she flew into a rage and said that if i would not take it she
would bring it herself as she could trust it to no on els a pretti
sight inde that a queen should be seen tear across the desert
after a depart scribe for so the common peopl still believ you
to be therefor come i must or bear her wrath
i understand ladi kemmah but what do you bring you have given me
noth save word
have i not well here it is and she produc from her robe some
small object wrap in papyru on which wa written the gift of a
queen to her king and lover
khian undid the papyru there within lai the royal signet of nefra
the same which he had seen set upon her hand on the night of
coron
thi is the queen ring said khian astonish
ay princ and the king her father ring befor her that which
wa taken from hi finger by the embalm after the battl and hi
father befor him and so on back and back for ag look on it is
cut the name of khafra whose tomb i think you saw the other night
though if he ever wore it i cannot tell at least it ha descend
through countless gener from pharaoh to pharaoh and now it
seem must pass as a love gift to on who is not pharaoh but yet is
charg to wear it as though he were
as perchanc he mai be yet by right of anoth ladi kemmah though
the matter doe not troubl him overmuch answer khian smile
then he took the ancient hallow thing and have touch it with
hi lip set it on a finger of hi right hand that it fit well
remov thenc to make place for it anoth ring on which wa
engrav a crown and lionhead sphinx the symbol of hi hous
a gift for a gift he said take thi to the ladi nefra and bid her
wear it in token that all i have is her as i will wear that she
send to me sai to her also that on the dai when we ar wed each
shall return to the other that ring which belong to each and with it
all of which it is the symbol
so kemmah took the ring and as she hid it awai there came that captain
of the guard who had accompani him from tani
welcom my lord rasa who i rejoic to see have not fallen a victim
to the spirit of the pyramid of which we talk when we part here
some five and thirti dai ago or wa it more for time pass quickli
in yonder gai citi of memphi you seem to have found strang compani
in thi holi haunt land and he glanc with aw at the ebon form
of the giant ru who stood by lean on hi great ax and at the
whiteveil state ladi kemmah who stood near him you look thin
and chang too as though you had been keep compani with ghost
well the steersman sai that if you ar readi my lord rasa he
desir to sail befor the wind chang or becaus the sailor ar
afraid of thi place or for both reason so if it pleas you
come
i am readi answer khian and while kemmah bow to him and ru
salut him with the ax in farewel he turn and went to the river
bank where the sailor bore him through the shallow water to the ship
present he wa far out upon the nile watch the palmgrov where
first he had met nefra fade in the gather gloom still there he
sat upon the deck till the great moon rose shine upon the pyramid
and think of all the wondrou thing that had befallen him in their
shadow until these at last grew dim and vanish leav him
wonder like on who awaken from a dream
chapter xiv

how come it khian that you wear upon your hand where i rememb
us to be a certain ring that i gave to you engrav with the symbol
of our hous and your titl as princ of egypt anoth ring an
ancient ring inscrib with the name of khafra royal son of the sun
who onc a thousand year ago wa pharaoh of egypt and how doe it
chanc that thi letter of refus is seal with that same ring by
nefra who describ herself as queen of egypt
now all present stare at khian while for a moment a littl smile
flicker on the wither face of the vizier anath
it wa a part gift to me said khian look down
oh so thi puppet queen make a part gift of her royal ring to
you my envoi and did you perchanc make a part gift to her of the
ring of the heir appar to the crown of the north
apepi paus watch khian but he made no answer
then the king hi father went on in a low roar voic like to that

now i understand all know son that i wa that messeng who
visit the habit of the brethren of the dawn some few dai ago
ye sinc he could trust no on els not even hi own son pharaoh
himself fill that humbl offic and came for hi own answer see do
you know him now and rise from the throne with a quick motion he
wound the colour bedouin shawl about him so that it hid hi face up
to the ey and limp forward a few pace
ye answer khian and my father the disguis is as excel
as the plan wa bold for had you but known it you ran a great risk
among peopl who ar worshipp of truth and look for it in other
apepi return to hi throne and spoke again in the same roar
voic
ay i ran a risk becaus i too love truth and desir to know what
wa pass yonder by the pyramid also to behold thi daughter of
kheperra with my own ey so i came and saw that she is veri fair and
royal such a on as i desir abov all women for my queen other
thing i saw also among them that again and again she look sweetli
at on clad in the white robe of a brother of the dawn on who
present i discov to be no other than yourself my envoi that i
believ wa dead moreov i heard from a fisherman that there were
strang sai in those part name that the daughter of the
dawn had promis herself to the son of the sun and that the spirit
of the pyramid had been unveil by a man of which sai he swore
he did not know the mean though now to me it is clear enough tell
me therefor khian who come from the hous of truth firstar you
wed or affianc to the princess nefra daughter of kheperra whose
ring you wear upon your hand and secondli ar you sworn a brother of
the dawn
now hi courag came back to khian and look hi father in the
ey he answer boldli
why should i hide from your majesti that i am betroth to the royal
ladi nefra whom i love and who love me also that after thought and
studi i have adopt the pure doctrin of the dawn and am sworn of
it holi brotherhood
why inde ask apepi with bitter ironi see that these
thing have been discov befor it pleas you to announc them
so my son khian you whom i sent as my ambassador to ask a wife for
me have stolen that wife for your own and you whom i set to watch my
enemi have adopt their doctrin and been sworn of their secret
fellowship why have you done these thing i will tell you you have
broken your trust and rob me of the woman becaus did i marri her
her son might thrust you from your heirship wherea if you marri
her you keep it as you think and add to it whatev claim thi
princess mai have on the throne of egypt it is clever khian veri
clever
i becam affianc to the ladi nefra becaus we love each other and
for no other reason answer the princ hotli
if so khian your love and your advantag go hand in hand as do her
love and her advantag wherein i think i see the cun of that old
prophet roi for the rest you swear yourself of thi order becaus
you believ it to be power have friend in mani land and think
that by their help in dai to come you will buttress up your throne or
win mine from me khian i sai that you ar a thief a liar and a
traitor and that as such i will deal with you
your majesti know well that i am none of these in order to bring
about a certain allianc your majesti wa pleas to reduc me from
my rank of heir appar to that of a privat person and as such to
send me on an embassi as envoi i did my duti but those to whom i wa
sent would not listen to your majesti propos which i could not
help afterward as a privat person i chanc to becom attach to
a certain ladi who if i had not live for reason of her own would
never have listen to the offer of your majesti that is all the
tale
that perhap we shall know when you have ceas to live khian learn
now how i will deal with these tomb rat of the pyramid who have
defi and insult me i will send an armyalreadi it is on it road
to knock them on the head all of them onli on will i spareth
ladi nefra not becaus she is born of a royal hous but becaus i
have look upon her and seen that she is beauti for khian you
ar not the onli man who can worship beauti therefor i will bring
her here and make her mine and for a marriag gift i will give her
your head khian ye you the traitor shall die befor her ey
now when thei heard thi decre the high offic who were name
companion of the king stare at each other dismai for never befor
had such a thing been told of as that a pharaoh of egypt should kill
hi own son becaus both of them love the same woman even anath the
vizier start and pale yet all that came from hi lip wa the
ancient salut
life health strength pharaoh word is spoken let pharaoh will
be done
as thi hideou sentenc fell upon hi ear and a vision of all it
meant rose befor hi ey for a moment khian felt hi heart stop and
hi knee trembl beneath him he saw hi brethren of the dawn
slaughter and ly in their blood wherev thei were trap in
their hide place he saw the giant nubian ru overcom at last and
fall dead upon a mat of foe that he had slain he saw the ladi
kemmah butcher and nefra seiz and drag a prison to tani
there to be wed by forc to a man she loath he saw himself led out
to death befor her ey and hi gori head laid at her feet as an
offer all these thing and other he saw with the ey of hi mind
and wa afraid
yet of a sudden that fear pass it wa as though a spirit spoke to
hi soul the spirit of roi or so he thought becaus for an instant
he seem to appear befor him seat where apepi sat vener
calm and holi then he wa gone and with him went the terror of
khian moreov now he knew what to answer the word well up
within him like water well in a spring
pharaoh and my father he said in a bold clear voic speak not so
madli for i sai that you cannot do these thing which you have
decre did not the prophet of the dawn repeat to you in hi letter
hi answer to your threat did he not sai that he had no fear of you
and that should you attempt harm against the brotherhood everi stone
of the pyramid would lie lighter on your head than will the curs of
heaven which you would earn as a butcher and on forsworn did he not
tell you that the order of the dawn marshal host unseen and that
with it goe the strength of god if not i your son who am todai a
brother of the dawn and it consecr priest deliv to you thi
hi messag try to do the wicked that you have decre o
pharaoh and speak with the voic of the order of the dawn as i am
taught by the spirit which it worship i warn you that you will draw
down upon yourself disast and death on earth and after you have
left the earth woe untold in the underworld thu sai i speak not
with my own voic but with that of the spirit within me
when apepi heard these dread word he bow hi head and with
trembl hand drew the colour robe more tightli about him like to
on who in the midst of great heat is struck suddenli by a blast of
ici wind then again hi rage possess him and he answer
now khian i am mind to send you the traitor to your god your
king your father and your blood down to that underworld of which
you speak there to discov whether thi wizard roi is or is not a
liar ye i am mind to do thi instantli here in the presenc of
the court and yet i will not sinc to you i appoint a punish
more worthi of your crime you shall live to see your fellow knave
dead everi on of them to see thi maiden whom you have beguil
not your but mine then khian you shall die and not befor
pharaoh ha spoken and i an ordain brother and priest of the
order of the dawn have spoken also answer khian in the same clear
and quiet voic now let the spirit judg between us and show to all
who have heard our word and to the whole world in which of us
shine the light of truth
thu said khian then bow to apepi and wa silent
pharaoh stare at him awhil for he wa amaz wonder whenc came
the strength that gave hi son power to utter such word upon the edg
of doom then he turn to anath and said
vizier take thi evildo who is no longer princ of the north or
son of mine and make him fast in the dungeon of the palac let him
be well fed that life mai remain in him till all thing ar

anath prostrat himself rose and clap hi hand there appear
soldier khian wa set in the midst of them and led awai anath

chapter xv
brother temu
through long passag and down flight of step at the head of which
stood guard the melancholi process descend almost to the
foundat of the vast build of the palac as thei went khian
rememb that when he wa a child some captain of the guard had
led him by thi path to certain cell where through a grate in the
door he had look upon three men who were condemn to die upon the
morrow for the crime of have conspir to murder pharaoh these men
whom he expect to see groan and in tear he recal were
talk togeth cheerfulli becaus thei said for he heard it
through the grate their troubl would soon be over and either thei
would be justifi in the underworld or fast asleep for ever
the three of them took differ view upon thi matter on of them
believ in the underworld and redempt through osiri on reject
the god as fabl and expect noth save etern sleep while the
third held that he would be reborn upon the earth and reward for
all he had endur by a new and happier life
the next dai khian heard that all three of them had been hang and
awhil after he learn from hi friend the captain of the guard
that thei had been prove to be innoc of the offenc with which
thei were charg it seem that a woman of the hous of pharaoh
have been reject by on of them had aveng herself by a fals
accus and for certain reason had denounc two other men whom
she hate as partner in a plot against pharaoh afterward when at
the point of death from a sudden sick she had reveal all
though thi did not help her victim who were alreadi dead
the sight of these men and the learn of their stori khian
recollect as onc more he trod those gloomi stair had bred in hi
mind doubt as to the god which the shepherd worship and of the
justic decre by king and governor with the result that in the
end he turn hi back upon hi peopl faith and becam on of those
who desir to reform the world and to replac that which is bad if
ancient by that which is good if new so inde he had remain until
fate brought him to the templ of the dawn where he found all he
sought a pure faith in which he could believ and doctrin of peac
merci and justic such as he desir
now as innoc as those forgotten men he the proud princ of the
north disgrac and doom wa about to be cast into the same prison
that had hid their suffer and those of a thousand other befor
and after them he recal it allth stonevault place lit onli
by a highset grate of bronz to which none could climb becaus of
the curv of the wall the pave floor damp from the overflow of
the nile which in season of flood rose high abov the foundat
of the palac the stool and tabl also of stone the bronz ring
to which the offic had told him prison were ti if thei becam
violent or went mad the damp heap of straw whereon thei slept and
the worn skin rug that thei us for cover against the cold ye
even the place where each of the three victim lai or stood and the
veri aspect of their face especi that of the young and come
man upon whom the reject woman had aveng herself though to thi
hour it had never been revisit by him hi mind pictur that
horrid hole with all it detail
now thei had trodden the last flight there wa the massiv door and
in it the grate through which he had look and listen the bolt
were drawn by the jailer who had join them it open there were
the tabl and the stone stool the ring of bronz the coars
earthenwar vessel and the rest onli the men were goneof these
noth remain
khian enter the dread place at a sign from anath the guard
salut and withdrew look with piti at the young princ under whom
thei had serv in war and who wa belov of all of them anath
linger to give certain instruct to the jailer then as thei were
both depart he turn back and inquir of the princ what garment
he requir to be sent to him
i think such as ar thick and warm vizier repli khian shiver
as the damp cold of the dungeon got a hold of him
thei shall be sent to your high said anath mai your high
forgiv me who must fill thi sorri offic toward you
i forgiv you as i forgiv all men vizier when hope is dead
forgiv is easi
anath glanc behind him and saw that the jailer wa stand at a
distanc from the door with hi back toward them then he bow
deepli as though in farewel so that hi lip came close to the ear
of khian
hope is not dead he whisper trust to me i will save you if i
can
next moment he too wa gone and the massiv door had shut leav
khian alon he sat himself down upon on of the stool place it so
that the faint light from the grate fell upon him awhil later he
did not know how long the door open again and the jailer appear
accompani by anoth man who brought garment among them a dark
hood cloak line with black sheepskin also food and wine khian
thank him and put on the cloak gratefulli for the cold of the place
wa bite note as he did so that it wa not on of hi own which
made him wonder also that in such a cloak a man might go anywher
and remain unknown
the jailer set out the food upon the tabl and prai hi prison to
eat address him as princ
that titl belong to me no more friend
oh ye your high repli the man kindli troubl come to
all at time but it cannot chang the blood in the vein
no friend but it can empti the vein of the blood
the god forbid said the jailer shudder from which khian
learn that he had rightli name him friend and again thank him
it is i who should thank your high your high ha forgotten
that when my wife and child were sick in the season of fever three
year ago you yourself visit them in the servant hut and brought
them medicin and other thing
i think i rememb said khian though i am not sure for i have
visit so mani sick who had i not been what i am or rather wa
would i think have turn physician
ye your high and the sick do not forget nor do those to whom
thei ar dear i am charg to tell you that you will not be left
alon in thi place lest your mind should fail and you should go mad
as mani here have done befor you
what is anoth unfortun to be sent to join me friend
ye but on whose compani it is believ will pleas you now i must
go and he depart befor khian could ask him when thi other
prison would come after the door had shut behind him khian at and
drank heartili enough for he wa starv have touch no food
sinc the afternoon befor upon the ship which brought him to tani
when he had finish hi meal he fell to think and hi thought
were sad enough for it wa evid that it wa in hi father mind
utterli to destroi the brotherhood of the dawn and to drag nefra awai
to be made hi wife by violenc for have by evil fortun look
upon her beauti noth now would turn him from hi purpos of make
her hi own thi howev khian knew would never happen for the
reason that first nefra would choos to die therefor it would seem
that both of them were doom to death oh if onli he could warn them
by throw hi spirit afar as it wa said that roi and some of the
higher member of the order had the power to do inde had he not
felt the thought of roi strike upon him that morn when he stood
befor the pharaoh in the hall of audienc he would try who had been
taught the secret of the send of the soul as it wa call
though he had never practis them befor
try he did accord to the appoint form and with the appoint
prayer as well as he could rememb them sai
hear me holi father danger threaten the queen and all of you hide
or fly for i am in the toil and cannot help you
again and again he said it in hi heart fix the ey of hi mind
upon roi and nefra till he grew faint with the soul struggl and even
in that bitter place the sweat burst out upon him then of a sudden a
strang calm fell on him to whom it seem that these arrow of
thought had found their mark ye that hi warn had been heard
and understood
an utter weari fell upon him and he slept
he must have slept for long for when he woke all light had fade from
the grate and he knew that it wa night
the door open and through it came the jailer bear more food
quantiti of food and bring with him anoth man cloth like
khian himself in a dark hood cloak the stranger bow and without
speak took hi stand in a corner of the cell
behold your servant princ who is appoint to wait upon you you
will find him a good man and true said the jailer then he remov
the broken meat and went have first lit lamp which he left
burn in the prison
khian look at the meat and wine then he look at the hood
figur in the corner and said
will you not eat my brother in misfortun
the man threw back hi hood
sure said khian i have seen that face befor
the man made a certain sign which by habit as it were khian
answer the man made more sign and khian answer them all then
utter a secret sentenc which the man speak for the first time
complet with anoth sentenc still more secret
will you not eat priest of the dawn he ask again meaningli
in hope of the food etern i eat bread in hope of the water of life
i drink wine repli the man
then khian wa sure for in these veri word those of the order of the
dawn were accustom to consecr their meat
who ar you brother he ask
i am temu a priest of the order of the dawn whom you saw but onc in
the templ of the sphinx scribe rasa when you came thither on a
certain embassi though then i did not know that you were sworn of the
brotherhood scribe rasa if that inde be your name
it is not my name and at that time i wa not sworn of the
brotherhood priest temu who i think ar the messeng sent by the
holi roi with letter for apepi king of the north we heard that you
were dead of sick priest temu
nai brother it pleas apepi to keep me prison that is all had
i di my spirit as it depart would have whisper in the ear of
roi
i rememb now that so the prophet said but how come you here and
why
i come becaus i am sent to help anoth in distress by some great
on who visit me in my prison he gave no name or if he did i have
forgotten it as we of the order forget mani thing nor did he tell
me whom i wa to help yet i can guess as we of the order guess mani
thing i see that you wear a royal ring scribe rasa it is enough
quit enough priest temu but tell me why were you sent to me in
such a hole as thi even a pharaoh would need no servant
no brother yet he might need a companion anda deliver
veri much inde both of them especi the last but temu how
could even roi himself open that door or break through these wall
quit easili scribe rasa by mean of which we know noth and if
onli we have faith perhap i can do the same though not so easili and
in anoth fashion hearken dure the mani dai i have spent in
prison better my soul with prayer and medit from time to
time i have given instruct to that humbl man who is our jailer
set hi feet in the wai of truth thu in the end he ha becom
well affect to those who profess our faith to which i have promis
that he shall be gather in dai to come in reward he ha impart a
certain secret to me which as neither he nor ani other will visit
thi place again tonight i will now show to you brother rasa help
me if it pleas you to move thi tabl
with difficulti it wa drag asid for it wa of massiv stone
then temu took from hi robe a piec of papyru on which were mark
and line by aid of these he made certain measur and at length
in the roughli pave floor found a stone for which he seem to have
been search at thi stone he push from left to right for there
wa a rough on it against which he could rest the palm of hi
hand therebi it would appear loos some spring or bolt suddenli
a section of the floor a pace wide or more tilt up reveal a
shaft cut in the rock of which the bottom could not be seen and
against it side also cut from the rock stone bar set at interv
on abov the other down which it would be possibl for an activ man
to climb
is it a well ask khian
ay brother a well of death or so i think though perhap of that
we shall learn more later at least all is as the great on whose face
wa veil told me for it wa he who gave me the plan and bade me
trust the jailer and do as he instruct me
and what is that temu
descend by thi ladder brother until at the foot of it we come to a
tunnel then follow the tunnel until it end in what seem to be the
mouth of a drain in the stone embank of the river beneath thi
hole or drainmouth a boat should be wait and in it a fisherman
follow hi trade by night when the largest fish ar caught into
that boat we must enter and be gone swiftli befor it is discov
that thi place is empti
do we fly at onc ask khian
no brother not for anoth hour for so i wa instruct why i do
not know help me now to close the trap but not quit lest the spring
should refus to work again and to replac the tabl over it exactli
as it stood befor who know that some offic or spy might not be
move to pai us a visit although the jailer said that none would
come
ay who know temu
so thei close the trap set a piec of reed from a food basket
between it edg so that it did not shut altogeth and drag back
the tabl to it place then thei sat down to eat scarc had thei
done so when temu press khian foot and look toward the door
he look also and though he heard noth saw or thought that he
saw a white face and two glow ey set against the grate and
watch them a sight that made hi blood turn cold in an instant it
wa gone again
wa it a man whisper khian
a man or perchanc a ghost brother for i heard no footfal and of
such thi place mai well be a home
then he rose and take a linen cloth that had been laid over the
food he thrust it into the grate
is that not danger ask khian
ay brother but to be watch is more danger
to khian it seem as though that hour would never end moment by
moment he fear lest the door would open and all be discov yet
no on came and inde thei never learn whether thei had seen a
face at the grate or whether it appear wa but a trick of their
mind
whither would you fly brother ask temu
up nile whisper khian to warn our brethren who ar in great
danger
i felt it said temu then he rose and pack the most of the food
of which as ha been said there wa much more than thei could eat
into two of the basket wherein it had been brought which were made of
reed and had handl that could be slip on to the arm

their brotherhood befor thei enter on ani undertak
i will go first brother carri on of the lamp in my teethth

then he step to the door pull out the foodcloth from the
grate and have listen awhil return and take the smaller
of the lamp set it flat handl between hi teeth next he crawl
beneath the tabl push upon the stone so that it tilt up and
stood edg in air climb through the hole on to the stone ladder
and began to descend khian follow as it chanc when he had taken
some three step down the ladder the peak hood of hi cloak touch
the stone disturb it balanc instantli it swung to releas
the spring or catch so that now there wa no hope of return sinc
thi could not be open from beneath even then the purpos of thi
trap came into khian mind when it wa desir to destroi some
unhappi captiv unknown to him the spring or bolt wa set back then
shortli as the doom on tramp that gloomi cave he would tread
upon the swing stone and vanish into the gulf beneath for when
thi wa purpos doubtless the heavi tabl stood elsewher or if hi
secret end wa desir veri swiftli jailer would hurl him down the
pit khian shudder as he thought of it rememb that thi fate
might well have been hi own down down he climb the feebl littl
lamp which temu carri in hi teeth light hi wai it seem a
long journei for the pit wa deep but at length temu call to him
that he had reach it bottom present he wa at hi side perch
upon a white and move pile that crackl beneath hi feet he look
down and by the lamplight perceiv that thei stood upon a pyramid of
bone the bone of the victim who in past dai had fallen or been
cast down the shaft moreov some of them had fallen not so veri
long befor as hi sens told him which caus him to rememb
certain friend of hi own who had incur the wrath of pharaoh and
as it wa said were banish now he guess to what land thei had
been banish
lead on temu he said i choke and grow faint
temu obei turn to the right as he had been told that he must do
and hold the lamp near the ground lest there should be pitfal in
the path which ran down a tunnel so low and narrow that thei must
walk it doubl up with their shoulder brush against it wall
for forti or fifti pace thei follow thi wind burrow till at
length temu whisper that he saw light ahead whereon khian answer
that it would be well to extinguish the lamp lest it should betrai
them thi wa done and creep forward cautious for anoth ten
or twelv pace thei came at last to an open in the great
embank wall built of granit block upon which the palac stood
so small an open that few would notic it in the rough of the
block and twice the height of a man beneath them saw the water of
the nile gleam blackli in the starlight
thei thrust their head out of the hole and look down also to right
and left
here is the river said khian but i see no boat
as all the rest of the tale ha prove true brother doubtless the
boat will appear also faith have faith answer temu to whom the
god had given a trust soul and when thei had wait half an hour
or more he repeat hi word
i hope so answer khian sinc otherwis we must swim befor dawn
and hereabout ar mani crocodil that feed upon the refus from the
palac
as he spoke thei heard the sound of oar and in the deep shadow of the
wall saw a small mast boat creep toward them thi boat came to
a halt beneath their hole there wa a man in it who threw out a
fish line look upward and whistl veri softli temu whistl
back whereon the man began to hum a tune such as fisher us then
at the end of it sang softli
leap into my boat o fish
khian scrambl out of the hole and climb down the surfac of the
rough wall which be accustom to such work wa easi to him and
present wa safe in the boat temu have first thrown the lamp
into the nile lest it should be found in the tunnel follow after
him but more awkwardli inde had not khian caught him he would
have fallen into the river
help me to hoist the sail the wind blow strongli from the north
therefor you must fly southward there is no choic said the man
as he obei khian saw hi face it wa that of the jailer himself
be swift he went on i see light move perhap the dungeon ha
been found empti mani spi ar about
then khian bethought him of the glow ey he had seen at the
grate
with an oar the jailer push the boat awai from the wall the wind
caught the sail and it began to move through the water so that
present thei were in the middl of the nile and glide up it
swiftli
do you come with us ask khian
nai princ i have my wife and child to mind

as he spoke with the oar he steer the boat near to the farther
shore of the river where at thi spot were hundr of mean

there is fish gear in the boat also you will find such garment
as men us who live by it put them on er dawn by which time with

farewel and prai to your god for me as i will prai for you princ
take the steer oar and stand out into the middl of the river where

as he spoke the man slip over the stern of the boat for a moment
thei saw hi head a dark blot on the water then he vanish
at last i have found on who is good and honest although of an evil
trade said khian
chapter xvi
the pass of roi
all that night khian and temu sail on for the north wind held
strong and steadi and by daybreak were mani leagu from tani onc
thei saw light upon the water behind such as might have been born
by follow boat but soon these vanish at daybreak thei found
the fisher cloth of which the jailer had told them and put them
on so that for the rest of that journei all who saw them believ
them to be two fishermen ply their trade such men as were to be
found by hundr on the nile take their catch to market or have
sold it return to their home in some distant villag thu it
came about that khian be accustom to the handl of boat thei
accomplish their journei safe though dure the second night a
number of great ship pass them go down nile
catch sight of these ship thei lower their sail and row
inshor where thei hid among some reed in shallow water until thei
were gone by a whole fleet of them what these might be thei could
not discern becaus of the dark but from the lantern at their
prow and stern the word of command that reach them and the
sing of those on board khian thought thei must be war vessel full
of soldier though whenc such came he did not know onli he
rememb what he had heard at apepi court and that on hi return
to tani he had seen arm vessel sail up nile and rememb
grew afraid
what do you fear brother rasa ask temu read hi mind
i fear lest we should be too late to give a certain warn temu
oh let us plai no more with word i whom you call the scribe rasa
am khian onc princ of the north the affianc of queen nefra whom
my father apepi would seiz to be hi wife when he discov that i
hi envoi had becom hi rival the king imprison and would have
kill me and that is why we came togeth in yonder darksom vault
all thi i have guess princ and brother but what now
now temu i would warn the queen and our brethren of the danger
that threaten them name that apepi would steal her and kill out
the rest of the order to the last man and woman for so he ha sworn
to me that he will do
i think that there is no need to take them that messag princ
answer temu lightli sinc roi would learn such tide quicker
than men could carri it still let us go on for god is with us
alwai faith have faith
so thei sail forward and shortli after daylight saw the pyramid and
at last came to the strand that wa near to the palm grove where first
khian had met nefra disguis as a messeng
here thei hid awai their boat as best thei could and wear the long
cloak that had been given to them in the prison beneath which were
sword that thei had found in the boat set there doubtless for their
us made their wai across the sand to the sphinx and thenc to the
templ meet no man inde thei note that those who cultiv
the fertil belt of land were not to be seen and that the crop were
trodden down by men and wander beast fill with fear thei
enter the templ by the secret wai thei knew and crept down it
passag into the great hall where nefra had been crown it wa
silent and empti or so thei thought at first till suddenli far awai
at the end of the hall khian perceiv a whiterob figur seat in
the thronelik chair upon the dai behind which stood the ancient
statu of osiri god of the dead thei advanc swiftli now thei
were near and khian saw that it wa the figur of roi orth ghost of
roi there he sat in hi priestli robe down which flow hi long
white beard hi head bent upon hi breast as though he slept
awak holi prophet said khian but roi did not stir or answer
then thei went to him trembl climb the dai and look into
hi face
roi wa dead thei could see no wound on him but without doubt he wa
dead and cold
the holi prophet ha been taken awai said khian hoars though i
think that hi spirit remain with us let us search for the other
thei search but could find no on thei went into the chamber of
nefra it wa undisturb but she wa gone even her garment were
gone and so it wa with all the other
let us go out said khian perchanc thei ar hidden in the tomb
thei left the templ and wander far and wide but all wa silenc
and desol thei look for footprint but if there were ani the
strong north wind had cover them up with sand at length in the
shadow of the second pyramid thei sat down in despair roi wa dead
and the rest were gone khian could guess why but whither had thei
gone were thei perchanc on board those ship which had pass them
in the night or were thei slain if so how came it that thei had
seen no bodi or sign of slaughter so thei ask of themselv and
each other but found no answer
what shall we do princ ask temu doubtless all will be well in
the end still our food and water ar almost gone nor can we stai
here without shelter
hide in the templ i think temu at least for the come night
listen i am sure that the brotherhood of the dawn have fled be
warn that apepi wa about to fall upon them
ye but whither
to seek the aid of the king of babylon the lord tau hint to me as
did the giant ru that if it were need thei might go thither and
thi doubtless thei have done if so we must follow them though
without guid and beast to carri food and water the journei is
desper
fear not princ answer temu the hope faith have faith we
of the brotherhood ar never desert in our need were we desert in
the prison of tani or on our journei up the nile and shall we be
desert though we travel from on end of the world to the other i
tell you nai i tell you that alwai we shall find friend sinc in
everi tribe there ar brother of the dawn to whom we can make
ourselv known by sign which friend will give us all thei have
food and beast of burden and whatev is need pass us on to
other moreov i have about me a great sum in gold it wa given to
me by that high on whose face wa veil he who visit me in my
cell at tani and sent me to join you ye and when he gave me the
gold and the jewel for there ar jewel also he said with mean
that i and anoth of my fellowship might be call upon to journei
into far land and that if thi were so the treasur would be need
for our susten till we found shelter far from the wrath of a
certain king
now as he listen the heart of khian grew bold again for it seem
to him as though thi happymind temu had been sent to him as a veri
messeng from heaven which inde perhap he wa after a fashion
i find your fellowship good in troubl temu he said though i
know not whenc you win such calm and strength of soul
i win it from faith princ as you will do also when you have been
longer of our brotherhood sinc apepi seiz me yonder at tani and
threw me into prison not onc have i been afraid nor am i now never
yet have i known harm to come to a brother of the dawn go about hi
duti the prophet roi is dead it is true but that is becaus hi
time had come to die or perhap he who wa too old to travel chose to
withdraw himself from the world but hi mantl ha fallen upon tau
and other and with us will go hi spirit and who shall stand
against the freed spirit of the holi prophet roi who walk with god
todai
then have determin that thei could do noth more that dai for
thei were weari and first must rest also get food if thei could from
the store that were hidden awai by the order in case of troubl of
which temu knew the secret thei set out to return to the templ of
the sphinx where the dead roi still rule as he had done when he wa
aliv at the edg of the great rock platform upon which wa built the
pyramid of khafra khian halt suddenli for in the midst of the deep
silenc of the tomb he thought that he heard voic whilst he wa
wonder whenc thei came from behind a littl neighbour pyramid
that mark the grave of some king son or princess appear a negro
run with hi head bent down and hi ey fix upon the ground as
do black peopl when thei track game
thei have gone thi wai both of them captain he call out and
not an hour ago
then khian understood that the man wa follow the footstep of temu
and himself who inde had come round that same littl pyramid
whilst he stood wonder what to do for thi discoveri seem to
freez hi blood round the corner of the small pyramid came a whole
compani of men who by their dress and arm he knew to be soldier of
pharaoh guard forti or fifti of them
we have been follow up nile thei ar hunt us princ now we
must escap from them or we shall be kill said temu calmli
as he spoke the black tracker caught sight of them and point them
out with hi spear whereon the whole compani broke into a run
utter shout like hunter when at last thei view their game
then in hi extrem a memori came to khian
follow me temu he said and turn fled back toward the pyramid
of khafra though to do so he must pass even closer to the pursuer
temu saw thi and stare then mutter faith have faith bound
after him
for a moment the soldier halt think that thei were come to
surrend but when thei saw the pair speed past them thei began to
run again khian follow by the longleg temu sped along the
south face of the great pile and as their pursuer reach it from
the west were just seen turn the corner of the east face so
swiftli did khian and temu run that when the soldier reach thi
east face thei lost sight of them who alreadi were speed along the
north face and not know which wai thei had gone wait till the
tracker came up to guid them by hi art
meanwhil khian rush along the north face sought with hi ey
for that fallen block of stone which mark where it must be mount
there were mani such block but at last he saw thi on and knew it
again call to temu to keep close he began to scale the pyramid
which to him wa easi
ye god am i a goat gasp temu well faith faith and up he
went as best he could onc he would have fallen but khian glanc
back saw and caught him by the hair
which wa the cours of stone he had found no time to count them as
he climb and each wa like to the other he thought that he must
have overshot it and stop try to rememb all that nefra had
told and shown him whilst he stood thu suddenli and as though by
magic a great block of marbl stir and swung round in front of him
reveal the mouth of the passag beyond in which he saw a light
burn not stai to think how thi marvel came about he leapt
into the hole drag temu after him for now the tracker had round
the corner and though still far awai had caught sight of them on the
side of the pyramid though thi afterward the soldier would not
believ therefor guess by the shout of the man that thei had
been seen in went khian though to what fate he did not know sinc
he could not guess how the swing block had open of itself and
fear some snare
scarc had thei pass the stone when it close as swiftli and as
silent as it had open and he heard the clank of the bar then
pant he turn to look about him and by the faint light of the lamp
that wa far off perceiv a figur stand in the mouth of the
recess which nefra had shown him wa us as a storehous the figur
came forward bow
welcom lord it said wonder is the wisdom of the prophet of
the dawn for thei warn me that you might return here thu about
thi time and therefor i kept good watch
now as hi ey grew accustom to the light khian knew the man again
to be no other than the sheik who had taught him to climb the pyramid
and wa call their captain
how could you watch through a stone wall friend he ask amaz
oh easili enough lord come here and i will show you now lie down
on the floor and look through that hole or if you would see higher
up through that on
khian obei and perceiv that the hole were tube which ran
slantwis to the face of the pyramid so cunningli contriv that a
watcher within could see what wa pass at it base or if he us
other farther awai thu khian saw the soldier arriv pant and
the black tracker with mani wave of hi arm explain to them
that the fugit had run up the pyramid thi tale seem to make
their captain angryfor clearli he believ it to be a lieso angri
that he struck the tracker with the handl of hi spear whereon the
man grew sullen as negro do who ar beaten unjustli and throw
himself on to the sand would sai no more after thi the soldier
began to search for themselv some of them even began to climb the
side of the pyramid till on of them roll down and hurt himself and
wa carri awai groan then other of them went on and vanish
to hunt among the tomb beyond or so khian suppos but the captain
and some offic sat down on the sand at the base and took counsel
togeth for thei were bewild so thei remain till nightfal
when thei lit a fire and camp there
have seen these thing or certain of them khian bade the sheik
tell him what had becom of the brotherhood of the dawn and why he wa
here alon insid the pyramid
lord thi is the stori answer the man some hour after you had
sail awai down nile bear letter for the king of the north new
reach the council of the dawn whenc or how it came i do not know
who am not in their secret a spy mai have brought it or it mai have
been reveal from heaven i cannot sai at least thi happen all
of the brotherhood were gather togeth then the women and children
and some men who were too old to travel far were sent awai across the
desert southward in the direct of the other pyramid where is the
burialplac of the api bull though whether thei were to stai there
or to go further i did not hear at least thei depart quietli that
veri night and next morn had vanish doubtless to seek shelter
with friend of the order in some appoint place where thei will be
safe
but what happen to the ladi nefra and the rest captain
lord all that night thei made prepar and the next morn
befor the dawn thei start eastward bear with them tent and
much provis laden upon ass also thei took a mummi case from the
burial vault which i understood contain the embalm bodi of that
queen who wa the mother of our ladi nefra onli on remain behind
save myself and that wa the holi prophet roi
why did you not go also sheik
for two reason lord first becaus the captain of the pyramid is
sworn whatev chanc never to leav them here my forefath have
live and di for countless gener and here my descend will
live and die till the sun ceas to rise or the pyramid crumbl into
dust thi is promis to our race so long as we guard them and keep
our trust but if we break it then it is promis that our famili
will die out
you give a good reason for stai where you ar though in danger
and loneli sheik
ye lord and there is a second just as good befor she went the
ladi nefra sent for me and speak as queen laid her command upon
me these were that i should forthwith see to it that the tomb chamber
in thi pyramid of ur of which like her i had the secret wa full
provis with food fresh water wine oil mean of make fire
and all other need thing that thi done i should take up my
abod here and watch all that pass and if you came for lord she
seem to be sure that you would come that i should hide you in the
pyramid and tend you there thu protect you from all foe
moreov she command me as also did the lord tau to tell you that
she with all the brotherhood had fled to babylon there to seek the
aid of her grandsir the great king ditanah who it seem still live
and had sent messeng to greet her as queen of egypt and if need
were to guid her and all her compani to babylon where it is
believ he will give her a great armi to make war upon apepi and to
establish her upon the throne of egypt she said also that i wa to
bid you so soon as you could escap to fly to babylon where you
would find shelter from the wrath of apepi
i thank the queen for her messag and forethought said khian
though how she learn that i wa fate to revisit thi place i
cannot guess
i think that the holi prophet roi knew and told her lord for to him
at the last the futur seem to be as open as the present the onli
differ be that he saw the on with the ey of hi soul and the
other with the ey of hi bodi
mayhap sheik but how come it that roi sit dead in the templ
hall do you know aught of hi end
lord i know everyth i wa present when after the departur of
the ag the women and the children the prophet summon all the
order befor him in the great hall and with them nefra the queen and
the lord tau there he address them in wonder word tell them
that thei must make the journei to babylon without him as now he wa
too old to travel thei answer that thei would bear him with them in
a litter but he shook hi head sai
not so the time ha come for me to die to thi world and to pass to
anoth whenc i will watch over you and where i will await you all
when your hour ar fulfil here then i bide till i am call
awai
then while thei wept he call tau to him and caus him to kneel
with secret and mystic word ordain him to be prophet of the order
of the dawn after him give him author over the bodi and soul
of men after which he breath upon and kiss him next he summon
our ladi nefra the queen and bade her be of a good heart sinc it
wa given to him to know that all thing should befal accord to
her desir and that howev great hi danger he whom she love
would be protect and brought back to her at last then he kiss and
bless her also and after her he bless all the order those of the
council by name charg them to guard it secret and to keep it
doctrin to which thei were sworn pure and undefil moreov
should thei shed blood in pursuit of it righteou aim and in defenc
of their queen and sister he absolv them of it guilt sai that
sometim war wa necessari to peac but that when war wa end
thei must show merci and becom poor and humbl as befor after thi
he dismiss them nor would he speak with ani of them again save to
give tau a write for the king of babylon and anoth write
address to all the member of the order throughout the world
and what happen then sheik
then lord thei bent the knee to him on by on and went awai who
by dawn were march for babylon when all had gone roi look up
and perceiv me left alon ask why i wa not with them i told
him what i have told you and he said that it wa well and that i must
tend him till hi death after thi he left the throne and laid him
down in a chamber near at hand and there i visit him night and
morn for all the dai i wa busi prepar thi place to which i
carri food and water and the rest from the templ store and lest i
should be seen hid them here in the hour of dark i think it wa
on the fourth afternoon from the departur of the brotherhood that
all my task be finish i went to the holi prophet to give him
water to drink for now he would touch no food he drank and command
me to help him to rise and to arrai him in all hi priestli garment
then at hi bid i led him to the hall and sat him down on the
throne with hi rod of offic in hi hand
hearken he said to me our foe come think to destroi us
accord to the command of apepi i see them land on the shore i
see the shine of their spear man and brother hide you there and
watch know that no harm shall come to you and afterward go do as
you were bidden now as the brother temu will know if you do not
lord all the templ yonder is full of place where onli fire or
hammer could find a man into the secret of which we of the order
have been instruct in case of need to on of these i went and hid
myself but a littl wai from the platform on which roi sat nor would
ani have guess that the calm statu of an ancient god held a live
man who could see all through it hollow ey of stone
a while went by perhap an hour for when i came into the templ the
sun wa still high but now it beam strike through the western
windowplac began to fall upon roi and the throne upon which he sat
in shaft of light that cloth him in a robe of flame suddenli the
silenc wa broken by sound that grew ever nearer sound of run
feet sound of rude voic shout
here is the path thei shout here is the nest of the white rat
of the dawn who soon shall be red now let us see if their spell can
turn pharaoh spear
roar such word as these a mob of soldier burst into the hall
through the great entranc glitter with armour and with lift
sword the silenc of the ancient place seem to strike and chill
them for their tumult ceas and after a paus thei came on slowli
cling togeth like bee then it wa lord that the red rai of
the wester sun fell full upon roi reveal him seat white
robe upon the throne hi goldenhead staff held like a sceptr in
hi hand thei stare thei halt
it is a spirit cri on
nai it is the god osiri hold the rod of power answer
anoth
the offic consult togeth doubtfulli till some captain who wa
bolder than the rest said
shall we be frighten by magic trick let us look
he march up the hall follow by other and halt in front of the
platform
thi old god is dead he cri do you fear a dead god comrad
now roi spoke in a hollow echo voic sai
what is life and what is death and how know you the differ
between a dead and a live god o violat of sanctuari
the offic heard and fell back but made no answer for he wa
afraid
what seek you in thi holi place o men of blood and who sent you
here went on roi
then the offic found courag to answer
apepi the pharaoh whose servant we ar sent us and our mission
is to captur nefra the daughter of kheperra onc king of the south
and to put to the sword the compani of the priest of the dawn
captur nefra the anoint queen of the two land if you can find
her man and put the priest of the order of the dawn to the sword
if you can find them search the tomb and search the desert and when
you find them put them to the sword and bear back the head of the
dead to apepi the shepherd dog whom you call a king and with them
the live beauti of nefra her majesti of egypt
thei made no answer and roi went on
search search to find naught but wind and sand search till the
sword of god fall upon you as fall it will
now lord it would seem as though that offic drew courag out of
the depth of hi terror for he shout back
at least old prophet you ar neither god nor hi sword and for
you there is no need to search you we will take to pharaoh apepi
that yet live he mai hang you as a cheat and a wizard abov the
gate of tani
now roi aros from thi throne and terribl to behold stood in the
fierc light of the set sun slowli he rais hi wand and point
with it at that offic sai in a cold clear voic
prophet you name me and now at the last if never befor prophet i
am hearken man and bear back my word to your master the shepherd
thief apepi and lai them to your own heart it is you and not i who
shall hang from the pylon gate of tani yea i see you swing in
the wind you who have suffer that flock to escap on which the
shepherd dog would feed and must feel hi rage as thi apepi must
feel the wrath of god sai to him from roi the prophet of the order
of the dawn that death draw near to him the breaker of oath the
seeker of innoc blood and that soon he shall talk with roi not at
tani but befor the judgment seat in the underworld sai to him that
hi armi shall go down befor the sword of the aveng as corn is
reap by the sickl and that on whom he would murder shall sit upon
hi throne and cherish her whom he desir sai to him that when he
stood here in thi hall disguis as a messeng i knew him well but
spare him becaus hi time wa not yet and becaus the humbl
brethren of the dawn unlik to the king of the shepherd pack
rememb the duti of hospit and do not seek to stain their
hand with the blood of envoi sai to him the oathbreak who would
practis treacheri that he shall drink of the cup of treacheri and
that from the evil he ha sown other shall reap the harvest of
righteous and peac
thu lord spoke roi and sank back upon the throne
seiz him shout the offic beat him with rod torment him
till he tell us where he ha hidden the royal nefra for ill will be
our welcom at tani if we return without her upon whom the king ha
set hi heart
now lord veri slowli some of the soldier crept forward two pace
forward and on back for thei were much afraid at length thei came
to the platform and climb it the first of them not touch him
stare into the face of the holi roi then reel back cry
he is dead thi prophet is dead hi jaw ha fallen
ay answer on in the hall but hi curs live on woe woe to
apepi and woe to us who serv him woe woe
while the cry still echo from the wall of a sudden the sun sank
and the hall grew dark then lord there aros anoth cry of flee
flee swiftli er the curs strike us in thi haunt place
lord thei turn thei fled the narrow passag were choke with
them some fell and were trampl of their fellow for i heard their
groan but these thei drag awai dead or live i know not which
present all were gone i crept from my hide place i lift the
hand of the holi roi it grew cold and when i loos it fell
heavili i listen at hi heart it did not beat then i follow the
soldier and hide as i know how to do saw them embark upon their
ship fight in their mad hast and push out into the nile
although a great wind blew when i came again at dawn thei were all
gone onli i think that some boat had been overturn for on the
shore were three bodi which i thrust back into the water
such lord wa the end of roi our master who now sleep in the
bosom of osiri
a strang tale and a terribl said khian
ay broke in temu but on in which i see the hand of heaven but
if such is the begin princ what of the end ill for apepi i
think and for those who cling to him faith have faith
chapter xvii
the fate of the cliffclimb
that night khian temu and the sheik of the pyramid after thei had
eaten and drunk laid themselv down to sleep in the burial chamber
of the pharaoh khafra khian ly on on side of hi sarcophagu
temu on the other and the sheik who said that he would not profan
the sacr place with hi humbl presenc just outsid the doorwai
but as khian discov that night often enough it is on thing to
lie down and anoth to sleep
sleep inde he could not perchanc he wa overweari who had
rest littl for mani night for on the boat he had labour hard
and scarc dare to shut hi ey perchanc all the danger that he
had pass all that he had suffer seen and heard so fill hi
mind that it would not ceas from troubl perchanc the hot still
air of the tomb ly at the heart of a mountain of stone oppress
him and took awai hi breath
or there mai have been other reason within the great chest against
which he lai silent and stern repos the bone of a pharaoh the
builder of thi pyramid who had been mighti in the world uncount
year befor but of whom now there remain no histori and noth
upon earth save those bone the pyramid and in the templ without
certain statu portrai hi royal presenc such a on as thi wa
no good bedfellow thought khian especi for a man who as
suddenli he rememb wore todai the veri ring with which ag
past that depart monarch had seal hi document of state
khian wonder in hi wake whether the ka or doubl of thi
pharaoh which as wa well known or so swore all the priest and
learn men dwelt with hi bodi in the tomb till the hour of
resurrect wa now look at that ring and wonder how it came
to be on thi stranger hand as he rememb alreadi it had
brought him troubl sinc through it hi father apepi with all the
cun of the jealou had guess that he and nefra were lover and
thereon cast him into prison he had escap from that prison to find
anoth but if thi wa to be share with the ka of the mighti
khafra the second would be no better than the first for who could
deceiv a ka had he thought of the matter which in hi folli he
did not he might have hidden the ring from apepi but where wa the
pouch that would hide it from the ey of a ka perhap howev
khafra had given the ring to him who came after him from whom it had
descend gener by gener until it came to hi hand lawfulli
enough in which case the ka might pardon him who wore it todai
oh hi brain grew weak and foolish he would think no more of ka
and ring he would think of that sweet and love ladi with whom he
had plight troth in thi veri sepulchr where wa she now he
wonder and when should he find her again the sheik said that
almost with hi last breath roi had prophesi that thei would come
togeth onc more which were comfort word yet roi might have
meant that thi would chanc in anoth world sinc to roi especi
at the last there seem to be littl differ between the live and
the dead but he khian desir the breath woman not her ghost
for who knew how shadow love if inde thei love at all how
wondrou wa the tale of thi death of roi hurl curs with hi
last strength upon apepi and those who violat the sanctuari of the
brethren of the dawn and strove to steal awai their sister and their
queen he thank the god that roi had not curs him in such
fashion nai he had bless him and nefra also therefor sure
thei would be bless for he wa holi a minist of heaven who knew
it mind
even in that dread habit and surround by so mani peril he
would rememb that roi had bless them and that hi spirit
purifi etern wa watch him stronger than the ka of khafra
or than ani evil ghost or demon that make it home in tomb ye
comfort by that bless he would ceas to stare at the waver
shadow that the lamplight threw upon the arch roof and sleep
sleep he did at last though fitfulli and haunt by bad dream for
that place wa foulair till at length he wa awaken by the sound
of temu who stir upon the farther side of the tomb and yawn
loudli
aris princ said temu for though on would not guess it here
it must be dai
what is dai to those who live in the etern black of a pyramid
as though alreadi thei were dead ask khian gloomili
oh a great deal repli temu cheerfulli becaus on know that
the sun is shine without also dark ha it comfort thu in
it have noth els to do on can prai longer and with a mind
more fix
but that the sun is shine on other doe not comfort me in a
stifl gloom temu and i can prai best when i see the heaven abov
me
as doubtless you will soon again princ for be sure that by now
have lost us those soldier have depart to report to hi majesti
that we have melt awai like spirit
in which case hi majesti will make them into spirit temu that
thei mai search for us elsewher certainli wherev those soldier
go it will not be back to tani unless thei take us with them think
now we have escap from pharaoh strongest dungeon which none ha
ever done befor the queen nefra and all our brethren save roi who
chose to stai behind to die have escap hi armi what would hi
mood be then toward those who report to him that thei had track
and hunt us onli at the last to let us slip through their finger
no temu unless we accompani them i think that thei will not return
to tani
at thi moment the sheik appear bear a lamp
have the soldier gone ask temu
come and see said the sheik and turn led them down the
passag now look he ad point to the eyehol
khian look and when hi sight grew accustom to the bright light
that flow from without perceiv the soldier fifti or more of
them engag in build themselv hut or shelter of the loos
stone that lai about moreov by set hi ear to the hole he
heard an offic call to someon whom he could not see ask if all
were well with the compani that watch the other face of the
pyramid then understand that these men were sure that their quarri
lai hid within the pyramid and intend to guard it dai and night
until starvat or lack of water forc them to come out khian
motion to temu to look for himself and sat down upon the passag
floor and groan
certainli said temu after a while it seem as though thei were
go to stop here a long time for otherwis thei would not be
build themselv hous of stone well we will outwit them
somehow faithhav faith
ye said khian but meanwhil even faith need food so let us
eat
thu for these three there began a time of terror dai ad itself to
dai and still the soldier remain watch as a cat watch also
other came to join them and among these men who were skill at the
climb of cliff and other height and set themselv to scale the
pyramid with the aid of rope and spike of bronz hope thu to
discov the hide place of the princ it wa but lost labour sinc
although often thei crept over it never did thei find the secret
stone nor if thei had could thei have open it that wa bar
within still there thei remain believ alwai that the prison
must come out unless inde thei were alreadi dead
khian and hi companion slept no more in the tomb chamber the place
wa too close and dread thei could not rest there so after that
first night thei laid themselv down in the passag near to the
entranc stone for there some air reach them through the peephol
also a littl light inde by set hi ey to on of these hole
that slant upward appar to make it possibl for ani look
through it from within to see the southern face of anoth of the
pyramid khian found that he could behold a certain star for hour
at night he would lie watch that star until at length it pass
from hi vision as the sight of it seem to give him comfort though
why he did not know for the rest thei must lie in the dark or with
the peephol block lest the lamplight flow through these should
betrai them and therefor were oblig to eat farther down the
passag soon howev although there wa plenti of it food began to
grow distast to them who must stai still or nearli so dai after
dai the water too becam flat stale and nauseou to the tast
and of the wine thei dare not drink too much
thu it came about that at length courag and spirit began to desert
khian who would sit for hour after hour silent sunk in a gloom as
deep as that of the bowel of the pyramid even temu though still he
talk much of faith remind hi companion of roi and hi
propheci and prai for hour at a time becam less happyheart
and declar that the prison vault at tani were as a palac compar
to thi accurs tomb the sheik also grew so wild in hi manner
that khian thought that he wa go mad what anger him most wa
that stranger should dare to scrambl about the pyramid of which he
wa the captain for of thi he talk continu khian tri to
sooth him by sai that he wa sure thei dare not climb so veri
high even with the help of their rope sinc never would thei know
where to set their feet
these word made the sheik thought for after hear them he grew
silent as though he were consid deepli on the follow night
just befor the dawn he awok khian and said
princ i go on an errand ask me not what it is but tomorrow at
sunset unbar the stone and wait if i do not return befor the dawn
bar it up again and think of me as dead
he would sai no more nor did khian try to turn him from hi purpos
for he knew that then the man would go quit mad so the stone wa
open a littl and have eaten and drunk some wine the sheik
slip out into the dark
the sound of the bar fall into it place again woke temu who
sprang up cry
i dream that the stone wa open and that we were free why where
is the sheik he wa ly by my side
the stone wa open temu but we ar not free as for the sheik he
ha gone on some wild errand of hi own what it wa he would not tell
me i think that he could bear thi place no more and seek freedom in
death or otherwis
if so princ there will be more water left for us two to drink and
doubtless all is for the best faith have faith answer temu and
ly down went to sleep again
that dai pass as the other had done of the sheik thei spoke no
more for both of them believ that he had fled or hidden himself
among the stone of the pyramid to get air inde now their miseri
were so great that scarc could thei think of other matter and
talk littl but like two cage owl sat stare at the dark
with larg unnatur ey toward even khian watch through
hi peephol saw that some bedouin of the desert who were mount
upon fine hors had arriv at the camp of the soldier who were
chaffer with them for corn or perhap milk which other on foot
carri upon their head in jar or basket when the bargain wa
done the soldier talk with the desertdwel tell them why
thei were camp there or so khian guess for the latter stare at
the pyramid as though the tale move them and ask mani question
as he could see by their eager face and the movement of their hand
whilst thei were still talk the sun began to set sink swiftli
as it seem to do in the clear ski of egypt then suddenli on
shout point upward
look look yonder stand the spirit of the pyramid there on it
veri crest clad all in white
nai answer anoth it is clad in black
there must be two of them call a third on in white and on in
black without doubt these ar no spirit but those we seek the
princ khian and the priest who all thi while have dwelt not in the
pyramid but on it crest
fool cri a voic how can men live for week in such a place
these ar ghost i sai have we not heard that the pyramid ar
haunt look the thing mock us make sign with it arm
ghost or men said the first voic that of the captain we will
take them tomorrow tonight it is imposs for dark fall
then follow tumult for all the soldier spoke at onc and at that
distanc khian could not hear their word he note howev that the
desertdwel did not speak thei sat still upon their hors at a
littl distanc and behind the soldier while he who seem to be
their chief made strang sign with hi arm stretch them out
wide then hold them abov hi head with hi finger touch
after thi veri swiftli came the dark cover all and the
shout di awai though from the encamp below where the
soldier gather round their fire still rose the murmur of eager
talk
temu said khian later what doe thi sign mean among the
brotherhood of the dawn and first he stretch hi arm out wide and
then made them into a loop abov hi head with the finger touch
that princ is the sign of the cross of life which member of the
order us for a signal when thei ar too far apart to speak it is
thu that thei know friend from foe or stranger
i thought so said khian and wa silent then he went to the
entranc place and took down the bar that close it
an hour later or more he heard a sound and for an instant felt the
night air blow sweetli on hi face though becaus of the dark
he could see noth next he heard the bar fall into it socket and
the voic of the sheik call him by name he answer and togeth
thei crept up the passag till thei came to a spot where a lamp burn
and there were food and water
when the sheik had drunk deepli khian ask him where he had been
though he could guess well enough
to the top of the pyramid lord i climb thither in the dark thi
morn it wa veri danger so danger that although you ar as
skill as i am i dare not ask you to accompani me still although
i am weak from set so long stirless in thi hole i did not fear
who know the road well also no harm ever come to the captain of the
pyramid while he follow hi trade of scale them
why did you go there sheik
i will tell you lord first that i might make those soldier dog
believ that we were live not in the pyramid but on or near it
crest in some cave among the stone or if thei would not believ
thi that i might frighten them and perhap caus them to go awai
doubtless thei have heard the tale of the spirit of the pyramid and
that those who look upon it ar doom to death or mad and if so
have as thei believ seen it onc thei will not wish to do so
again lastli i had a reason of my own of which perhap you will not
think well skill cliffclimb have been brought here to scale the
pyramid my pyramid and that of my forefath on which none ha
set foot unless he wa of my blood except onli a certain ladi and
yourself by order of the council of the dawn yet these bungler have
never yet reach the crest of that i am sure now thei will try to
do so for the soldier will forc them to the task and i think that
what will happen to them will caus stranger for mani a gener to
leav the pyramid to be climb by my race alon
that is reveng which would have been displeas to roi answer
khian shake hi head then rememb that to thi man the
pyramid were as holi as is a templ to it priest and that to him he
who dare to try to conquer them deserv to die as much as he doe
who violat a sanctuari he said no more of the matter but bade the
sheik to continu hi tale
lord i reach the summit in safeti just as the dawn began to break
and there lai flat all dai in the littl hollow that you know where
part of the cap stone is broken off it wa veri hot there lord with
the sun beat full upon me nor did i dare to move lest i should be
seen yet i endur till at last came the hour of sunset then i rose
up and stood upon the veri point clad in my white robe so that all
the soldier could see me while thei gaze astonish i slip back
to the hollow and cover up the white robe with my black cloak of
camel hair and thu clad appear again bend my knee so as to
make it seem as though i were a second man of a differ statur
thi i did more than onc lord and thu those watcher came to
believ that unless thei saw ghost both you and the priest temu were
on the summit of the pyramid
a clever trick said khian laugh for the first time for dai
though i know not how it will serv us
thu lord if the soldier believ that you ar on the summit of the
pyramid thei will ceas to search and watch it slope and all night
long the ey of their sentri will be fix upon that summit but
listen there is more to tell while i stood thu on high i perceiv
certain men mount on veri fine hors who seem to be arab of the
desert and who were or had been engag in chaffer with the
soldier sell them milk or grain now the presenc of these men
caus me to wonder for i knew well that no arab dare to set foot
within the boundari of thi the holi ground of dawn fear lest
if thei do so the curs of heaven and of the prophet of the dawn
should fall upon them then a thought came to me sent as i think from
on high and see him who seem to be the headman of the arab
watch me with uplift face with my arm i made certain sign that
ar known to our order and perhap lord to you also who now ar on
of them
khian nod and he went on
lord that man answer the sign and so did anoth who wa near to
him to show me as i think that thi wa not done by chanc then i
knew that thei were friend sent here for a purpos and understood why
my spirit had move me to climb the pyramid
and if so what of it sheik ask khian in a hoars voic for hi
heart beat high with hope and choke him
thi lord tomorrow at the sunset onc more i shall stand upon the
crest of the pyramid and if as i think those arab still ar there i
shall make other sign to them show them where thei must wait at
midnight have hors in readi then i shall return and guid
you to them for i think that thei will know which wai to ride
it is danger said khian but so be it for if i bide here much
longer i think that i shall die therefor better meet fate in the
open and swiftli than perish here in thi hole by inch
then he call temu and the three of them took counsel togeth also
the sheik and temu talk much of the secret sign of the order and
practis them by the lamplight
next morn er dawn the sheik depart again as he had done befor
as soon as it wa light watch through their spyhol khian and
temu saw that there wa much disturb in the camp of the soldier
saw also that the skill cliffclimb six or more of them with
their rope and metal spike were collect togeth talk with
the offic
at last as it seem to khian somewhat against their will thei
advanc to the foot of the pyramid and set hi ear to the hole
khian heard them scrambl up the face of it for a long while he
heard no more but note the soldier watch eagerli talk
togeth and point with their hand now in thi direct and now
in that
suddenli there rose a scream of horror some of the soldier stare as
though fascin other turn their back and other hid their
ey the spyhol wa obscur for a moment as though by someth
pass between it and the light then soldier ran forward and
present khian and temu saw them return toward the hut bear
three shapeless thing that had been men a while later thei saw the
remaind of the cliffclimb stagger much as the drunken do
toward the same hut where thei cast down their rope with the air of
those who have done with them and depart out of the sight of the
watcher
the pyramid ar aveng on those who thought that thei could master
them and their captain will rejoic said khian sadli think to
himself that had not some power protect him thei would have been
aveng upon him also as inde veri nearli happen
onc more it wa sunset and again the arab mount on fine hors
appear at the camp again too there were shout and point
with much disturb in the midst of which he who seem to be the
chief of the arab drew a littl to on side of also behind the
soldier so as not to be seen of them and from time to time made
motion with hi arm as those do who at it rise or it set
worship the sun in the desert then follow dark and in it shone
the fire round which the soldier were seat
present thei stood up hold their hand behind their ear as
though to listen to some sound in the air then by two and three
depart like men who ar frighten and hid themselv in the hut or
elsewher a while later the stone turn and the sheik glide into
the passag but thi time he ask for wine not water
i have been near to osiri he said who slip upon the blood of
on of those cliffclimb fool and almost fell yet i did not fall
who i think wa guard and for the rest all goe well
except for the three who ar dead said khian sigh
if thei di it wa by no fault of mine lord without knowledg of
the road in their mad have scale twothird of the height
thei came to smooth marbl where is no hold place for hand or
feet then on slide down drag the other with him for thei were
rope togeth after which the rest see the fate of their
fellow gave up the ventur and return now as i think the
pyramid will be safe from these common cliffclimb for mani a
year
what chanc afterward ask khian
i appear at sunset as befor and make pretenc to toss my arm
about as a ghost or a devil might do i signal to him who seem to
be the captain of the arab he answer me we understood each other
after dark i shout curs at the soldier tell them that i wa
the spirit of roi the prophet and that doom wa near to them thei
grew frighten at what thei held to be a voic from heaven and crept
awai to hide themselv from the word of evil omen nor as i think
will thei come out of their hole again until the sun is high now
drink a cup of wine and follow me both of you
chapter xviii
how nefra came to babylon
after he who wa known as the scribe rasa the envoi of apepi king of
the north had receiv the betroth ring from hi affianc nefra
the queen and sail down nile to tani there to undergo mani evil
thing at the templ of the dawn all came about as the captain of the
pyramid afterward describ to him and the priest temu
scarc had thi rasa who wa khian the princ depart than there
arriv at the templ disguis as arab an embassi from ditanah
the old king of babylon these men nobl of babylon were receiv
in secret by the council and bow befor roi the prophet present
to him tablet of clai cover with strang sign
read the write tau said roi for my sight grow feebl and i
forget thi foreign tongu which is your own
so tau took the tablet and read
from ditanah the ag lord of babylon and king of king whose
glori is as that of the sun the mighti on to roi the holi seer
the friend of heaven the prophet of the order of the dawn and to
him who sit under roi the first of the brother of the dawn who
in egypt is name tau but who as i ditanah have heard in
babylon aforetim wa name the high princ abeshu the law son
of my bodi with whom i quarrel becaus he rebuk my majesti
as to a certain vengeanc which i took upon a subject peopl and
who thereaft fled awai and as i believ wa long dead
greet
know o roi and o tau or abeshu that i have receiv your letter
inform me of all that pass in egypt and that you abeshu
still live also that it wa the desir of my daughter rima whom i
gave in marriag to kheperra the pharaoh of the south and by
right of descent the king of all egypt that her bone should be
brought back for burial to babylon also i have read that her
daughter nefra ha in secret been crown queen of egypt and seek
my help to win her throne out of the hand of my enemi apepi the
usurp who rule at tani
now i ditanah sai to you roi the holi and to you queen nefra
my grandchild come to me at babylon with all your compani
thither i swear you safeconduct in the name of my god marduk
ruler of heaven and earth in the name of the god nebo and bel
and of all the other god who ar my lord there also you shall
be guard from all harm by the strength of my hand and there we
will talk togeth of all these matter
and to you who ar call tau i sai come also and if you can
prove to me that you ar in truth my son the princ abeshu i
will give you all thing that you desir who have mourn over
you for mani year save on thing onli the success to my
throne after me which is promis to anoth but if you have li
to me in thi matter then do not come for sure you shall die
to the bone also of my daughter rima whose husband kheperra
the wolf apepi brought to hi death i will give honour
burial in the sepulchr of king where it wa her desir to lie
at last nor do i think that i shall refus her deathpray if
nefra my grandchild the queen will obei me in a certain matter
seal with the seal of ditanah the great king and with the seal
of hi councillor
when tau had read he touch hi forehead with the tablet and gave it
to nefra who sat upon her throne in the centr of the council she
also laid it against her forehead then turn to tau and said
how come it my lord tau that all these year you have kept thi
secret from me who if the tale that is written here be true must be
a brother of my mother and my unclea question which caus the
envoi to stare at him
tau smile and answer
o queen and niec the tale is true enough as should we live to come
at babylon i will prove to my royal father ditanah and hi
councillor i am abeshu and the halfbroth of queen rima but when
i left babylon she wa but a littl child born of anoth mother whom
i had scarc seen sinc she dwelt with the royal women nor did i
reveal myself to her afterward when we met again and i save her from
the plot of apepi at thebe or to you when you grew to womanhood
becaus of oath that i had taken when i becam a brother of the dawn
which oath bound me to lai down all my earthli rank and to forget
that i had been a princ yet in those oath there wa a loophol
name should it ever becom need to declar myself and my true
name and histori therebi to help the order of the dawn i wa free to
do so to all of which our father the prophet can bear me wit
ay said roi it is true hearken queen and sister and you the
envoi of ditanah mani year ago a brother of our order now long
dead brought to me a man who said that he desir to becom on of
us a noblelook warrior man stalwart and squarebeard who i
judg had drunk of the water of euphrat i ask him hi name and
countri also why he sought the shelter of the dawn he told me and
prove hi word that he wa abeshu a princ of babylon who had
quarrel with hi father ditanah the great king whose gener he
had been over the matter of a subject peopl whom he had been order
to massacr but would not for merci sake and becaus of hi
disobedi had been banish or left the land afterward he had
serv under other king those of cypru and of syria as a captain
of their armi but in the end grew weari of fight and ambit
of love who betrai him also and determin to bid farewel to the
vaniti of the world and in solitud and silenc to feed and purifi
hi soul
therefor have heard of the order of the dawn he came to knock
upon it gate i answer to him that among us there wa no room for
on who onli sought salvat for himself and rest from earthli toil
sinc those of our brotherhood must be the servant of all men and
more particularli of the poor and those bound with the chain of sin
sworn to bring peac to the world even at the cost of their own
live sworn too to poverti and except for special purpos to
celibaci and the renounc of all earthli honour for thu onli
as we held could the soul of man come into union with it god
therefor if he becam on of us it must be as the slave of the
humblest and he must forget that he had been a princ of babylon and a
gener of her host he who henceforward would be but a minist of
heaven appoint to task mayhap that the meanest idol would
refus
in the end queen thi suppliant bow hi neck beneath our yoke and
lai down all hi titl becam known under the humbl name of tau
yet from tau the servant he grew to be tau the spiritu lord and
after me it ag prophet the greatest in our brotherhood and so
acknowledg throughout the world though until it becam necessari to
proclaim it to the great king ditanah but the other dai none knew
that he wa abeshu the princ of babylon
now when thei heard thi strang stori the member of the council rose
and bow to tau as did the envoi from babylon set their hand
upon their heart but nefra did more for she rose also and kiss
him on the brow call him her belov uncl and sai that now she
understood why she had alwai love him from a child
then tau spoke sai
all is as ha been told but becaus of it i neither seek nor deserv
your prais what i have done i did for my own soul sake who came to
know that there is no true joi save in the servic of other and in
the seek to draw near to god now for a while it seem that still
in the servic of other i must onc more be known as a princ and
perhap as a captain in war if so let not my royal father have ani
fear lest i should seek to claim the heritag of those whom he ha
appoint to succe him i whose onli hope and purpos is that i mai
live and die a brother of the dawn
at thi moment he who kept the door advanc and whisper into the
ear of roi who said
admit them
there came in three men travelstain and weari who when thei threw
open their cloak and made the sign were seen to be brother of the
order
holi prophet said on of them we come from tani and from the
camp of apepi armi we have it from those in author who in secret
ar the friend of our order that apepi make prepar should a
certain request of hi be refus to attack you here to put everi
on of the brotherhood to the sword and to drag awai yonder royal ladi
to be hi wife hi troop ar gather and in a few dai he will be
upon you
i know it well answer roi let those mad servant of apepi come
for i have word to sai to them
then he command tau to call togeth all the peopl of the dawn
that he might take counsel with them
thei gather togeth and in their presenc roi the prophet laid down
hi offic and consecr tau as hi successor as the sheik of the
pyramid had told khian and temu then too he bade them farewel and
bless them and thei depart weep after which all thing
happen as the sheik had said there were some among the council
nefra the queen wa on of themwho would have seiz roi and born
him awai by forc but he read their mind and forbad it so at last
thei went leav him alon accord to hi command yet that wa a
sad part and at it mani tear were shed thu nefra wept much for
she love roi who from her infanc had watch over thi orphan child
as though he were her father he note her grief and call her to
him
ladi of egypt he said you who todai ar a queen in name and er
so veri long unless my wisdom fail me will be so inde wide seem
the gulf that is set between you and the old hermit the prophet of a
secret faith whose name will vanish awai and who er long will be
utterli forgotten upon the earth also between you and me li the
span of mani year for i am veri veri old while but yesterdai you
came to womanhood moreov your lot in life is far differ from
that which i have trod and that now is end so it would seem as
though there were littl in common between us yet it is not so
becaus we ar ti togeth by the bond of love which did you but
know it is the on perfect etern thing in heaven and earth time
is noth it seem to be and yet is not for in everlasting what

egypt and that the scribe rasa and hi companion must follow by the
road she took lastli we were sworn to bring both of you safe to
babylon or die at the task which lord we purpos to do now lord
we must ride again these hors ar of the most swift and purest
desert blood but we have far to go befor we can find other and
certainli we shall be pursu moreov he ad ey temu
doubtfulli i think that yonder priest is more wont to travel on two
feet than on four and until he learn the trick of horsemanship we
must go with care lest he should fall or faint lastli both of you
ar weak who have i think lain for mani dai in an evil prison
true word fire said khian as he sought hi hors
all that dai thei rode forward rest while the sun wa high and
sleep at night among some rock where onc more thei found food and
water for man and beast and at length temu who wa brave and activ
began to lose hi sore and to win someth of that trick of
horsemanship of which he who wa call fire had spoken also in the
strong and winelik desert air their tombbr weak and langour
pass awai from both of them and thei grew strong again as young
men do
on night thei slept upon a mound by water where onc had stood some
villag both men and hors be well hidden by a grove of thorn and
other tree that flourish in the rich soil of the mound as the sun
sank behind them he who wa call fire came to khian and bade him
look through the tree toward the east he did so and to their right
saw that at a distanc of perhap a leagu a broad canal or natur
sheet of water that mai have been the head of a lake wa cross by a
ford beyond which stood an old and crumbl fort built of sundri
brick while in front of them there wa no ford and the water seem
to be wide and deep beyond thi water wa a great flat plain that
stretch awai and awai till veri far off upon the horizon it seem
to end in a line of stoni hill
listen now lord said fire that water is the boundari of egypt
that plain is arabia and among those hill is the first desert
outpost of the armi of the king of babylon to reach which will be to
win to safeti but i tell you lord that we ar in great danger i am
certain that yonder old fort is held by the horsemen of king apepi
for i have seen their track in the sand a number of them fifti men
perhap and that thei watch for us believ that if we would leav
egypt we must do so by thi ford
why ask khian can we not find anoth
there is no other lord sinc below thi water grow into a gulf
and abov it is deep for mani mile so that to pass round it we must
ride through a peopl countri guard by the border garrison
then it would seem that we ar trap or must fly back into egypt
where we should be trap inde lord for by now the whole land is
search for us
what then fire know that i would sooner look upon the face of death
than upon that of apepi
i have guess as much listen lord all is not lost these fleet
hors of our were bred in arabia yonder among the mountain and
thei scent their home and the troop of mare that wander there the
water in front of us will be unwatch becaus it is so wide and deep
and the current run so swiftli yet i think that the hors will not
fear to face it and onc across with good fortun we mai ride far
befor we ar seen and perhap even reach the pass of the hill in
safeti it is a narrow pass lord where on man can hold back a
number for a long while so that some of us at least should win
though to the heart of the hill and find shelter among the scout of
babylon he ad slowli and with mean
then speak veri rapidli he explain to khian all the detail of
the plan which he and hi brethren had prepar he told him and
temu who had join them how thei must move down to the water edg
befor the dawn and at the first light ride the hors into it and as
soon as it grew deep slip from the saddl and swim with them
cling to their mane
here temu explain that he could not swim whereon fire answer that
he must hang to hi hors as best he might or drown he went on to
sai that those of them who live to reach the farther shore must mount
at onc and ride for a certain bai in the hill where the pass began
which bai would becom visibl to them befor noon the pass thei must
climb on foot if the hors had fail them and descend it farther
side to the entrench camp of the babylonian compani who had order
to succour all fugit from egypt
have set out these and other matter he bade them drink and sleep
while thei could for none knew what might be their rest place on
the morrow
khian obei know that he must harbour hi strength the last
thing he saw er hi ey close wa the four strang brethren
groom the hors and with set face talk to each other in
whisper as thei work also nearer to him temu on hi knee lost
in earnest prayer for with all hi faith temu rememb that thi
water wa said to be broad and deep and thath could not swim
it seem that but a few minut had gone by when on of the brethren
woke khian sai that it wa time to be stir thei rose by the
starlight set the bridl and the saddl on the hors which had
been fed alreadi mount them and follow the brethren down toward
the water thei reach it in safeti just at the first glimmer of
dawn by the light of which khian saw that it wa inde widescarc
could the strongest bowman have shot an arrow from on bank to the
other also some tide or current seem to run veri strongli through
it toward the ford below which wa to thi water as is the neck of a
wineskin to the bottl
would it not be safer to risk the ford he ask of fire doubtfulli
nai lord for there we should certainli be seen and perhap kill
upon the bank wherea here where no man cross thei mai not note
us from so far awai follow me now befor the light strengthen
then have pat hi hors and whisper into it ear in the arab
fashion he rode into the flood after him came khian follow by
anoth of the brethren and by temu last of all rode the remain
two brethren those who were known as air and water
the hors went in brave enough and soon khian saw that fire wa
swim while it rider had slip from it back and float
alongsid hold fast to the mane or saddl present khian hors
also lost foothold and as fire had done so did khian the swim wa
long and rough for the swiftli run water chill by the night
air drove them downstream and sometim broke over their head yet
those train hors held on brave smell the pastur where thei
were born beyond the desert and be as fire had said that thei
would be eager to reach them
at last thei touch the farther shore and khian still cling to
the hors wa drag through the rush to firm ground as he came
there he heard a shout of help and look round saw temu hors
struggl up the bank but unaccompani by temu who inde have
let go wa flounder in the deep water and be swept down by the
current at a distanc from the shore all thi the strengthen light
show to them whereon without a word two of the brethren plung
into the stream and swam to temu whose shout grew ever louder thei
reach him and with difficulti between them drag him to the shore
much frighten but unharm and still call to god and men to
save him
then on of those strang fierc brethren drew a knife sai
will you be silent or shall i make you so who ar bring us all
to death
your pardon said temu when he understood but my mother alwai
taught me that he who drown in silenc drown the most quickli also
i ask you to note that my prayer have save me
mutter word that temu would have thought evil fire help to
thrust him on to hi hors and sign to the other to mount their
hearken lord rasa he said as thei push their wai through the
thorn bush that grew on the bank of the water illfortun is our
companion the shout of that mad priest will almost certainli have
been heard would that he had choke befor hi throat shape them
moreov he ha delai us so that the morn wind blow awai the
mist which i hope would shroud us for a while now there is but on
thing to be donerid straight for the gap in the hill and through
the pass our hors ar better than ani the shepherd have though
their will be more fresh and we or some of us mai outpac them at
the least rememb thi lord rasa if so in truth you ar name we
four brethren will do all that men can do to save you and we prai
you if we meet no more so to report to a certain ladi whom we serv
and to the prophet and council of the dawn that our memori mai be
honour among men
then without wait for an answer he spoke to hi hors which leapt
forward follow by that of khian and the other and sped awai
when thei had ridden thu for some minut and the sun wa up fire
turn and point back toward the ford khian turn also and saw
the bright light glanc on the spear of a great compani of mount
men some of whom were splash through the ford whilst other not
more than the half of a leagu awai were gallop toward them
thei were pursu and the race for life began
on thei rode for hour after hour toward those hill that scarc
seem to grow more near veri strong were their hors and well
accustom to these sandi plain over which thei swept at a long and
steadi gallop yet the wai wa far also for dai alreadi thei had
been ridden across the desert and that morn thei had swum a wide
stretch of rapid water wherea those of the shepherd troop were
fresh from the stabl still throughout the burn heat of the dai
those hors held their own and when it drew toward even and at
length that pass in the mountain wa at hand still thei held their
own ye parch with thirst pant thinbelli still thei held
their own long ago most of the shepherd had fallen out and vanish
so that when at length the pass wa reach not a score of them
remain men who had remount upon led hors when those thei rode
were founder but now these were hard upon their prei scarc a
bowshot behind inde
khian and hi compani stumbl up the pass for the hors both of
the pursu and the pursuer had ceas to gallop and at the best
could but ambl forward yet step by step the pursuer gain upon the
pursu the side of that pass were veri steep and the pathwai wa
veri narrow on hors fill it all and therefor thei must ride on
follow the other
suddenli at a turn in the road when the first of the shepherd wa
scarc more than fifti pace awai that arab or babylonian or
brother of the dawn whichev he might be who wa pleas to give
himself the name of fire turn and shout an order thereon the
last of those four brethren he who wa call water dismount and
with drawn sword took hi stand at the turn of the narrow path while
hi weari hors follow it fellow as by certain word and sign he
bade it do present those of the parti of khian heard the sound of
clash arm behind them follow by silenc then a while later the
pursuer appear again onli wherea there had seem to be fourteen
of them now but eleven could be count
onc more thei gain onc more thei drew near whereon he who wa
name fire shout a second order and that brother of hi call air
dismount in anoth narrow place leav a second hors without a
rider to follow in the train again there wa a sound of clash
arm and when the pursuer reappear there were but nine of them
as befor thei gain and as befor at a narrow place the word of
command rang out and the third of the brethren he who wa call
earth dismount wait follow the clash of arm and the
shout and when the pursuer reappear there were but six of
them thei gain thei came veri near whereon at a chosen place the
first of the brethren he who wa name fire halt and leapt from
hi hors which he drove forward as the other had done
ride on lord he cri should the god we worship give me strength
and skill for you there is yet a hope of safeti ride on and forget
not the messag i gave you by the water
nai answer khian wearili for hi head swam and scarc he knew
what pass about him nai here i stai to die with you let temu
who understand noth deliv your messag
begon lord cri fire would you put me to shame and caus me to
fail in my trust make my name a hiss and a reproach begon or i
fall upon my sword befor your ey
then as khian still stai swai in the saddl that most gallant
man call some secret word to the hors he rode and the beast
understand stumbl onward at a trot nor could khian stai it
onc more there came the clash of arm and the sound of shout and
present khian look back saw that of the pursuer but three
remain he urg hi hors but it could do no more almost at the
crest of the pass it whinni and stood still
the three struggl on grimli for thei were afoot have left their
spent beast behind them thei were strong soldierlik men black
with dust and sweat and on of them had been wound for blood ran
down hi face and robe he who seem to be an offic
we ar command to take you dead or live princ khian for so you
ar shall we slai you or will you yield ask thi man hoars
now when he heard these word khian spirit came back to him and
with it some of hi lost strength
neither he answer in a low tone
then chang hi sword from the right hand to the left from hi
belt he snatch hi short javelin and hurl it with all hi
strength the offic saw it come and shrank asid but in that
narrow place it caught the man who stood behind him pierc him
through from breast to back so that he fell down and di then the
offic sprang at him and thei fought with sword a wellmatch
pair though both were veri weari while the third man who could not
come at khian strove to drag the javelin from the breast of him who
had fallen the offic smote somewhat wildli perhap the blood from
hi wound had run into hi ey khian parri then bend himself
thrust forward and upward with all hi strength a trick of
swordsmanship that he had learn in the syrian war the bronz blade
caught the offic in the throat just beneath the chin and pierc
to the neck bone sever it so that down he went like a stun ox
in hi fall twist the sword from khian sweat hand then it wa
that the third man have recov the javelin cast it at him
though with no good aim for it struck him not in the bodi but abov
the left knee pierc the leg from front to back
khian reel against the rocki side of the pass support himself
there helpless and unarm he who had cast the spear see hi
state rush at him perhap he hope to take him live or perhap
he too had lost hi weapon at least he seiz him with hi hand
whereon khian fell backward to the ground with the man abov him now
those hand had him by the throat and were choke the life out of
him
all is finish thought khian
it wa then just as hi sens were leav him that he heard the
sound of run feet and of a voic cry
faith have faith
next there follow the thud of a heavi blow and the grip upon hi
throat loosen he lai still regain hi breath then sat up and
look about him there at hi side lai the soldier dead hi head
broken like a crush egg while over him stood the tall temu hold
in both hand a great smooth stone
none of them will move ani more said temu in the voic of on who
marvel who would have thought that i should live to kill a man in
such a fashion i a brother of the dawn sworn to shed no blood my
brain swam cook in the sun my mind wa almost gone that accurs
horseoh mai i never see anoth horsejolt on with me when i
heard a nois look over my shoulder and saw i could not stop the
hors so i slid over it tail and ran back toward you i had no
weaponi think i lost the sword in the river at least when i look
for it there wa noth but the scabbard still i ran prai and
as i prai my ey fell upon that stone i think that the holi roi
must have sent it there from heaven i pick it up and brought it
down upon the head of that man of blood as i us to bring down a
flail on corn and my arm be still strongwel you see brother
the stroke wa great and well aim
veri well aim most excel temu answer khian faintli now
if you can pull thi bronz out of my leg for it pain me
temu pull with goodwil and khian faint
when he came to hi mind again it wa to see himself surround by
tall squarebeard warrior clad in the babylonian uniform on of
whom support hi head upon hi knee and pour water down hi throat
from a gourd
have no fear lord said the soldier we ar friend who were
warn that fugit might reach us from egypt and hear sound of
war ran toward them though littl we thought to find you thu now
we will bear you to our camp beyond the pass there to recov of your
wound
then khian faint again for he had lost much blood yet thei carri
him to the camp where he wa doom to lie for mani a dai for hi
hurt fester so that he could not be move and it wa thought that he
must lose hi leg moreov thi camp wa beleagu by desert men
in the pai of apepi so that escap from it wa imposs
chapter xx
the march from babylon
long must nefra wait in that scent palac at babylon befor the
great armi gather to set her on her throne wa readi for it work
from all part of the vast empir troop must be collect hillsmen
and plainsmen and men from the border of the sea archer driver of
chariot infantri spearmen and those who rode upon camel slowli
thei came togeth and then must be exercis and weld to a whole
also provis and water for so huge a forc must be provid and
compani sent forward with these and to prepar the road thu it
came about that three full moon went by befor ever the vanguard
march out of the brazen gate of babylon
to nefra soon that citi grew hate she loath it pomp and
ceremoni and it stare crowd it religion wa not her and
unlik her mother to it god she put up no prayer inde scarc
could she bring herself to bow when her grandsir led her with him to
ritual in it enorm terrac templ she the pupil of roi and
the sister of the dawn who wa sworn to a purer faith
the unend ceremoni of that ancient court the adul accord
to it king and even to her hi granddaught who wa known to be a
queen the prostrat the shout of mai the king live for ever
address to on who soon must die weari and revolt her
moreov the confin and the hot airless of the place where
she could onli move in palac court or in formal garden told upon
the spirit of thi free daughter of the desert till kemmah watch
her note that she turn from her food and grew pale and thin
lastli her spirit wa torment with fear and doubt through the
secret servic of the brethren of the dawn new reach babylon that
the princ khian and the priest temu had escap from tani and
repair to the pyramid whenc thei had again escap toward
arabia guid by certain men who had been deput to aid them
then after a while came other new name that both of them
togeth with those guid had been cut off by apepi outpost
beyond the border of egypt and either kill or taken captiv as it
wa thought the former becaus the bodi of some of their compani
were report to have been seen after thi there wa silenc which
had nefra but known it wa not strang
when the shepherd captain of the border fort learn that those whom
he had been command to watch for and snare had slip from hi
hand and have kill certain of hi peopl had it wa believ
reach the babylonian outpost in the hill aliv although he did not
dare to attack that outpost which wa veri strongli place first
becaus he had not suffici strength and secondli becaus in a
time of truce it would be an open act of war upon babylon for which
he had no warrant still he surround it with skirmish with order
to kill or captur ani who set foot on the desert road thu it came
about that when messeng were sent bear new that khian lai sick
and wound at thi camp thei were cut off thrice thi chanc and
when at last ow to the recal of the skirmish at the open of
the war a letter came in safeti to babylon the armi had march
alreadi by anoth road to attack egypt and with it nefra and the
brethren of the dawn therefor the letter must be sent after it and
never came to nefra hand till she wa far upon her path
meanwhil when first she heard these rumour at babylon tell her
that khian wa dead or captur her heart seem to break within her
for a while she sat silent with a face of stone then she bade kemmah
bring tau to her and when he had come said to him
you have heard my uncl khian is dead
no niec i have heard a report that he mai be dead or captur
if roi were aliv he would tell us the truth he whose soul could see
afar said nefra bitterli but he is gone and onli men remain whose
ey ar set upon the ground and whose heart ar fill with matter
of the world
as it seem that your is niec yet roi be dead leav me all
unworthi in hi place still speak did he not tell you that howev
great your troubl you and khian would come togeth at the last
and wa the holi roi an utter of empti propheci
ay he said that but he to whom flesh and spirit were much the
same mai have meant that we should come togeth in the underworld
oh why did you ever suffer the princ to return to the court at
tani although i could not sai it it wa my desir that he should
bide with us at the pyramid then he might have fled safe with us
to babylon and by now perchanc we should have been wed
or perchanc other thing would have happen niec if ani knew the
decre of heaven that man wa roi and he held that believ hi
honour to be at stake the princ hi embassi accomplish must be
allow to follow hi desir and make report to apepi hi father so
he depart to fulfil hi mission and sinc then matter have not
gone so ill for you
i think that thei have gone veri ill she said stubbornli
how so niec we know through our spi that the princ and the
priest temu escap from tani and came to the pyramid where thei lai
hid a while we know also that by the help of those highborn warrior
brethren of our order whom i deput to the task thei escap again
from the pyramid and fled safe out of egypt it seem that thei
were follow and that there wa fight in which it well mai be that
those brethren or some of them lost their live as thei were sworn
to do if so peac be to their gallant spirit but of the death of
the princ or even of temu there is no certain word nor he ad
slowli doe a dream or voic tell me or ani of us that he is dead
as it would have told roi interrupt nefra
as mayhap it would have told roi and as mayhap roi be still
live though elsewher would have told me who fill hi offic
niec be not so roughtongu and ungrat have not all thing
happen accord to your desir ha not the royal ditanah my
father given you a great armi to set you on your throne ha he not
at your prayer and as i can tell you now at mine made in secret
abandon hi polici of wed you to hi heir mirbel and sent
that princ far from babylon to where he cannot molest you ha he
notthough thi ha been hid from youset me in command of that
armi that it mai be handl accord to your desir and mine
put trust in me that when it work is done i will lai down my
generalship and from a mighti princ of war onc more becom a priest
i who were i evilheart might us it to set the crown upon my
head
it seem that he ha done all these thing uncl but what of them
if khian is dead then i seek no throne then i seek noth but a
grave nai first i seek vengeanc i tell you that of apepi and hi
shepherd i will not leav on live of hi citi not on stone
shall remain upon anoth
kind word from a sister of the dawn and from her on of whose
titl is unit of landsnot their destroy exclaim tau
shrug hi shoulder and ad o child do you not understand
that all life is a trial and that as we pass the trial so we shall
be reward or condemn you ar mad with fear for on whom you love
and therefor i do not blame you overmuch though i think that you
will live to griev over those fierc threat
you ar right i am mad and be mad i will caus other to drink
of my cup of fear and sorrow that cup in which thei have mix the
wine send ru to me my uncl that although i be woman he mai teach
me how to fight and bid those babylonian smith come measur me for
armour of the best
then tau depart smile still he sent ru and with him came the
royal armour
so it happen that soon had there been ani to look over the wall of
a certain courtyard of the palac a strang sight might have been
seen of a lissom maid clad in silver mail cut and thrust at a
huge black giant who often enough cri out beneath the smart of her
blow and onc stung beyond endur smote her so shrewdli on the
helm with the flat of a wooden sword that she fell headlong to the
ground onli to spring up again while he stood dismai and deal him
such a thrust beneath the breast bone that hi breath left him and he
did likewis ye there he lai grunt out between hi gasp
the god help apepi if thi lion whelp get him in her claw
while she bade him be silent becaus by all the law of swordsmanship
he wa dead
at other time she would practis shoot with a bow an art in which
she had no small skill or when she weari of thi at the drive of
chariot in the privat circu of the palac take with her on of
the slave women a bold desertbr girl for passeng becaus ru
wa too heavi and kemmah said that she wa mad and refus to come
so you thought when i began to climb the pyramid yet thei serv me
my turn nurs she answer and went on drive more furious than
ever woman drove befor
now when her grandsir the old king ditanah heard of these thing
he wa amaz and caus himself to be hidden in place whenc he
could watch her secretli at her warlik exercis have done so and
listen to the tale of her conquest of the pyramid he sent for tau
and said to him with a curiou smile upon hi pucker face
i think son abeshu that i should have given the command of my great
armi not to you who if onc a great warrior have becom a priest
but to thi granddaught of mine who if onc a priestess ha becom
a goddess of war
nai sire answer tau for if you gave her that armi you would
never get it back again everi man in it would learn to love her and
she would us it to conquer the world
well why not ask ditanah and hobbl awai think in hi
heart that if it had truli pleas the god to take the princ khian
to their bosom so that mirbel might be recal to court hi tear
would be hard to weep for with such a beauteou and royalheart
ladi for it queen and that of egypt sure the glori of babylon
would fill earth and heaven indeedwa it too late then he
rememb that on thi matter he had pass hi royal word sigh
and hobbl on
these martial exercis serv nefra in two wai thei gave her back
her health which she had begun to lose in the soft life of the
babylonian palac and thei held her mind from brood upon it fear
that is while she wa engag in them yet at night these return
to her nor inde were thei ever quit absent from her thought she
importun tau and even her grandsir the king who caus search to
be made all along the egyptian frontier of hi empir messag came
back from the searcher that no trace of fugit could be found
but among them wa anoth messag name that certain hill could
not be approach becaus thei were watch by horsemen of the armi of
apepi inquiri wa made as to these hill and it wa found that in a
camp among them were station a compani of babylonian troop from
which no report had been receiv of late therefor as often
happen in so vast an empir for a while thi outpost had been
forgotten by that gener in whose command it lai or if rememb at
all it wa suppos to have been overwhelm by rebelli desert
dwell tribe
when tau heard thi new he went to the king hi father and gain
leav from him to send a hundr pick horsemen to dispers the
outpost of apepi and search those hill also he set spi to work
but of thi busi he said noth to nefra fear lest he should
fill her with fals hope
at length the vast armi that had been gather in the militari camp
upon the bank of the euphrat beyond the wall of babylon wa readi
to advanc two hundr thousand footsoldi and horsemen a
thousand or more of chariot countless camp follow and a
multitud of camel and ass bear provis besid those which
were alreadi stack at the water hole along the line of march
then came nefra farewel to babylon in state wear the crown of
egypt she visit the sepulchr of king and in it templ laid
offer upon her mother grave thi duti done at the court in the
great hall of the palac she bade farewel to her grandsir ditanah
the great king who bless her wish her well and even wept a
littl at part from her whom he could never hope to see again also
becaus he wa too old to accompani hi son upon thi war with tau
also now clad in the armour of a gener and princ of babylon and
look like on who had never felt the rub of a monk robe he
convers apart sai sadli
strang lot ar our belov son mani year ago we were dear to
each other then we quarrel more through my fault than your for
in those dai my heart wa hard and you went your wai to becom a
priest of some pure and gentl faith and your heirship wa given to
anoth now for a littl hour you ar onc more a princ and a
gener command a great host who yet purpos if you live to lai
down these rank and titl and your mission end again to seek
some desert cell and wear out your dai in prayer and i the king of
king your father remain here await death that soon must overtak
me and oh i wonder son abeshu which of us ha chosen the better
lot and done more righteous in the ey of god ye i wonder much
from whom all these pomp and glori flee awai like shadow
there is a great taskmast sire answer tau who portion out
to each of us hi place and labour man doe not choos hi lot it
is chosen for him to work for good or ill within it appoint round
such at least is the teach of my faith believ which i seek no
throne or power but am content to build on that foundat as truli
as i mai so let it be with you my royal father
ay son so let it be sinc so it must be
then veri tenderli thei bade each other farewel and part to meet no
more upon the earth sinc when that armi return to babylon anoth
king of king wa seat on the throne
so by proclam babylon declar war upon the shepherd who long
befor had learn that thi storm wa about to burst upon them and
were make readi to meet it as best thei might
for veri mani dai the great armi march across the plain and
desert as the progress of so vast a host wa slow till at length it
drew near to the border of egypt then it wa that tau heard from hi
spi and skirmish that apepi with all hi strength a mighti
power had built a line of fort upon hi boundari and in front of
these wa prepar to give battl to the babylonian these tide
he took to nefra who sat in her chariot arm in glitter mail like
some young war goddess surround by a bodyguard under the command of
ru
it is well she said indiffer the sooner we fight the sooner
it will be over and the sooner i shall be aveng upon the shepherd
of the blood of him whom i have lost for have receiv no tide
of khian now she had becom almost sure that he wa dead
do not run to meet evil niec said tau sadli is there not enough
of it at hand that you must go to seek out more have i not told you
that i believ the princ to be aliv
then where is he uncl how come it that you under whose command is
all the might of babylon cannot spare some few thousand to seek him
out
perchanc i am seek niec tau answer gentli
as he spoke a slave ran up sai
letter from the king of king letter from babylon and have
touch hi forehead with the roll he gave it to tau who open and
read within wa anoth roll a littl crumpl roll such as might
have been hidden in a headdress or a shoe
tau glanc at the content of thi second roll and gave it to nefra
a write for you niec he said quietli
seiz it she read it wa brief and ran thu
again o ladi a certain on whose name you mai guess write to
sai that save for a hurt to hi leg which crippl him he is well
in health thi he doe becaus he ha learn that the enemi
who surround the place where he li mai have cut off former
messeng should he who bear thi come safe to you at babylon
or elsewher he will tell you all more i dare not write
sign with the sign of the dawn which you yourself taught me how
to shape
nefra finish read then fell rather than leapt from the chariot
into the arm of tau
he live she gasp or he live where is the messeng
as she spoke the word a guard appear escort an offic who wa
travelstain and weari
on who crave audienc with you princ abeshu and at onc said
the leader of the guard
tau look at the offic and knew him again it wa he whom the king
had sent from babylon to search for the miss outpost
your report he said and wait with fear in hi heart
princ answer the man salut we won through to the outpost
and found all well there sinc it is so strongli place that the
shepherd skirmish have not dare attack also we found those
travel who were miss
again nefra pale and lean against the chariot for she could not
speak
what of them ask tau
princ the priest is well four brethren who travel with them
were slain on by on in a certain pass thei di nobli defend
those in their charg the lord whose name is not spoken who escap
with the priest is still sick that is he is wound in the left
knee and the wound run he cannot walk and though now it is believ
that hi leg will be save alwai he must be lame for the knee is
stiff
did you see him ask tau
ye princ i and anoth of my compani saw him while the rest of
us pretend to retreat drew off the shepherd horsemen we two won
our wai to the camp which is on a plain surround by hill not to be
reach except through two pass on to the west and on to the
east there we found the garrison well though weari for of food thei
have enough also the priest and the other travel who is hurt
these told us how thei came to the place and of the death of their
four guid which is a great stori
then repeat it afterward said tau it seem that you escap why
did you not bring these travel with you
princ how could the two of us carri a man who cannot walk down a
mountain path even with the help of the priest moreov if we could
have brought him to the plain it wa full of enemi all mount on
good hors through whom it would scarc have been possibl to bear
him safe while the garrison had receiv no order to attempt to
leav it post therefor it wa determin that he should remain
where he is safe enough until a suffici forc could be sent to
bring him awai
then the captain went on to tell how he and hi companion had rejoin
their men at night and fought their wai through the horsemen of apepi
who watch the stronghold though with loss how also thei had
learn from some desert wander that the armi of the great king wa
march upon egypt by a road that ran not more than thirti leagu
from where thei were and how therefor thei had ridden for the armi
instead of return to report at babylon
you have done wise said tau had you attempt to bring that
wound lord with you doubtless he would have been kill or
captur
then he went awai to give certain order leav the offic with
nefra who had mani question to put to him
when tau return an hour later nefra wa still question him tau
look at them and ask
friend how long is it sinc you slept
four night princ answer the offic
and how long is it sinc you and your companion at
fortyeight hour princ inde if we might crave a cup of water
and a bite of bread who have ridden hard and done some fight
these await you captain when it pleas her majesti of egypt to
dismiss you
then nefra redden and turn awai asham when the men had gone to
eat and rest humbl enough she ask tau what wa hi plan
my plan is niec to send five thousand mount men though we can
ill spare them to clear the desert between thi place and the
stronghold where he who wa name the scribe rasa li woundednot
dead as you fear niec and to bring him with our brother temu and
the garrison of the camp to join the armi on it march which
travel in a chariot or a litter he should do within some six
dai
a good plan said nefra clap her hand i will go with the
five thousand and in command of them kemmah can accompani me
no niec you shall not go you stai here with the armi
shall not shall not exclaim nefra bite her lip as wa her
fashion when cross why
for mani reason niec of which the first is that it would not be
safe we cannot tell how mani troop apepi ha between here and that
stronghold but we know he would risk much to captur hi son now that
the great war ha begun also the ladi kemmah could not bear such a
journei
if it is not safe for me who am sound and well neither is it safe
for khian who is wound and if thing be thu then let the whole
armi turn and march to the stronghold
it cannot be niec thi armi is a trust place in my hand and it
busi is to push on and give battl to apepi not to wander awai
into the desert where perhap it mai be overcom by thirst or other
disast
cannot be i sai it must be my uncl i the queen of egypt desir
it it is an order
tau look at her in hi calm fashion and answer
thi armi is under my command not your niec and have put on
armour the queen of egypt is but on offic among thousand and he
touch her shine mail therefor i must prai even the queen of
egypt to obei me or if that is not enough i must prai nefra a
sister of the dawn to accept the word of the prophet of the dawn
without question as she is sworn to do the safeti of the queen of
egypt is much as is the safeti of the princ khian but the safeti
and the triumph of the great host of the king of king ar more
nefra heard and wa about to answer furious for her high spirit wa
aflam yet there wa that on the strong face and in the quiet ey of
tau that still her word befor thei were utter she look at him
a while then burst into tear and turn depart to her tent
next morn at the dawn the five thousand horsemen with certain
chariot guid by that offic and other who had brought tide
depart to rescu khian and hi companion from the stronghold where
he wa imprison
chapter xxi
traitor or hero
the babylonian host march on and came in safeti to the border of
egypt the mightiest host perhap that ever had invad the land of
nile there it encamp protect in front by water to rest and
prepar befor it attack apepi encamp with all hi strength some
three leagu awai around the fort that he had built the captain of
the shepherd ride out saw with their own ey how terribl and
numberless how wellord also wa the armi of the king of king
with it horsemen it chariot it camelri it footmen and it
archer that seem to stretch for mile no eastern mob but
disciplin and train to war thei saw and trembl and return
made report to apepi at hi council
let pharaoh hearken thei said for everi man we muster the
babylonian have two under the command of the princ abeshu who is
report to be a great gener though some sai that he wa onc a
priest and a magician the spi tell also that with them march the
princess nefra daughter of kheperra she who slip through
pharaoh finger and is affianc to pharaoh son who also slip
through hi finger and if he live is hidden we know not where
unless he too be with the babylonian it is imposs that pharaoh
can stand against such a host as thi which will overrun the land
like locust and devour us like corn
apepi heard and rage took hold of him so that he gnaw at hi beard
suddenli he turn to anath the old vizier sai
you have heard what these craven sai now do you give me your
counsel you who ar cun as a jackal that ha often escap the
trap what shall i do
anath turn asid and spoke with certain other of hi fellow
councillor then he came and bow befor apepi and said
life blood strength o pharaoh such wisdom as the god have given
us bid us urg pharaoh as do the divin who have consult with
their spirit not to join battl but to make peac with babylon
befor it is too late
is it so ask apepi what term then can i offer to the king of
babylon who come to seiz egypt and add it to hi empir
we think pharaoh answer anath that ditanah doe not desir to
take egypt we have heard from those who serv pharaoh in secret at
babylon that ditanah is bewitch by nefra the beauti it seem
that when those wizard of the dawn through help of their magic art
escap to babylon thei took with them the bodi of the queen rima
the widow of king kheperra the tale run that the coffin of queen
rima wa open befor the king of king and that at the bid of
the princess nefra and of the head wizard of the dawn the bodi of
rima or the ghost of rima spoke to ditanah who begat it bid him
to attack egypt or bear the curs of the dead it bade him also to
give nefra in marriag not to hi grandson and heir mirbel but to
the son of your majesti the princ khian to whom she becam
affianc yonder by the pyramid and to send a great armi to aveng
the death of her husband kheperra and her own wrong by cast your
majesti from the throne and set the princess nefra and the princ
khian in your place moreov the royal rima or her spirit said to
ditanah king of king that if he neglect to do her bid he and
hi countri should be everlastingli accurs but if he obei her
bless should come upon them therefor becaus of the word of
dead rima hi daughter and becaus of the spell laid upon him by
the princess nefra and the wizard of the dawn ditanah ha sent thi
armi against your majesti to fulfil the command of rima upon you and
upon the peopl of the shepherd
what then must i do to turn asid the wrath of thi babylonian
ask apepi of the vizier glare at him
that which the king of king demand or so it seem o pharaohw
the princ khian if he still live and can be found to the royal
nefra and give up to them the crown of the upper and the lower
land
is thi your counsel vizier
who am i and who ar we that we should dare to show a path to be
trodden by the feet of pharaoh ask anath cring befor hi
master yet if he take anoth and these captain ar right
perchanc soon there will be a new pharaoh and if the princ khian be
dead as some believ the peopl of the shepherd will be driven from
the nile back into the desert whenc thei came centuri agoand the
king of king or the princess nefra under him will rule egypt
now apepi leapt to hi feet roar with rage and with the wandlik
sceptr that he carri smote anath on the head so hard that the blood
came and the vizier fell to hi knee
dog he cri speak more such word and you shall die a traitor
death beneath the whip long have i suspect that you were in the
pai of babylon and now i grow sure of it so i am to surrend my
throne and take ditanah for my lord and should he still live give
the woman whom i had chosen for my wife to be the queen of the son who
ha betrai me first will i see egypt devour by fire and sword and
perish with her out of my sight you whiteheart cur
anath wait for no more yet when he turn at the doorwai to make
the customari obeis though apepi could not see it in the shadow
there wa a veri evil look upon hi face
struck he murmur to himself i the great offic i the vizier
struck befor the council and the servant well if apepi ha a staff
i have a sword now come on babylon i must to my work oh khian
where ar you
apepi the pharaoh of the north dismiss hi councillor and hi
gener and sat in the chamber of the fort that he had built
brood and alon although often he wa possess by that devil of
rage who sleep so lightli in the breast of tyrant also by other
passion he wa a farse statesman and a good gener have
inherit from hi forefath the gift by help of which thei had
conquer egypt thu he knew that anath the old vizier the clearest
and most cun thinker in the land wa right when he told him that
he could not stand against all the strength of babylon drill and
martial as never it had been befor and march under the
guidanc of those wizard of the dawn who had escap him leav
behind him their high priest to lai upon him er he di the curs of
the oathbreak and the seeker of innoc blood yet for tell him
thi truth he had offer public insult to anath smite him as he
would a slave such insult as the old nobl and offic in whose
vein it wa said ran the pure blood of egypt never would forget
would it not be better then to follow the blow on the head with a
thrust to the heart and to have done with anath nai it wa not safe
he wa too power he had too mani in hi pai thei might rise
against him now when all complain at be forc into a war thei
hate thei might destroi him as thei believ he had destroi hi
son princ khian whom thei love he must send for anath and crave
pardon for what he had done when besid himself with rage and doubt
promis him great aton and more honour and bide hi time to
balanc their account
yet could he accept thi anath counsel and to save hi life and the
shatter of the shepherd power bow hi neck beneath the yoke of
babylon what did it mean that he must abandon hi throne and in
favour of khian if he still live of khian who had stolen from him
the woman upon whose beauti he had set hi heart and sent her to call
up the babylonian hord against him hi king and father or if
khian were dead then thi nefra queen of the south and inde of all
egypt by right of blood would take that throne as the vassal of
babylon and doubtless wed it heir therefor what could he gain by
surrend on thing onlyto live on in exil as a privat man
eat out hi heart with memori of the glori of the past and
watch the egyptian and their great alli stamp upon the shepherd
race
it wa not to be born if he must fall it should be fight as hi
forefath would have done how could he succe against so mighti a
foe not in a set battl there thei would overwhelm him or if he
kept to the wall of hi fort surround them and sweep on to captur
egypt yet generalship and craft might still give him victori he had
it he would send all hi best horsemen twenti thousand or more of
them of the old fight shepherd blood to make a circuit in the
desert and fall upon the rear of the babylonian as thei advanc to
give battl which doubtless accord to their custom thei would do
while it wa still dark in order that thei might attack in the
uncertain light of dawn by some such unexpect thrust their arrai
might be confus and broken so that he would have to deal not with
an armi but with a mob at least sinc no other offer the plan
should be tri
the five thousand despatch by tau came safe to the stronghold in
the hill and report themselv and their mission to the captain of
the outpost and to hi wound guest whom all knew to be the princ
khian though none call him by that name khian heard their tale and
grew faint with joi when he learn that the great armi of babylon wa
near to him and that with it safe and sound wa nefra hi belov
as a write in her own hand told him sad and heavi had been hi long
confin in thi place crippl as he wa but now at length the
night of fear and wait had pass awai and there in front of him
burn the dawn of joi
until the follow morn the five thousand rest themselv and
their hors then take with them the garrison of the outpost who
were glad enough to bid it goodby thei start to rejoin the
babylonian armi that thei had plan to meet at a certain spot on the
frontier of egypt in the centr of their arrai in a chariot becaus
he could not ride went khian follow by temu in anoth chariot
becaus he would not ride have sworn an oath unless fate forc
him never to mount anoth hors
so thei pass on safe across the desert for apepi skirmish
who had hem them in for so long had vanish awai thei could not
travel fast becaus of the soldier of the garrison who must march on
foot inde their progress wa so slow that khian who wa on fire to
rejoin nefra wish to gallop on to the babylonian armi escort onli
by a few horsemen but thi the offic in command of the five
thousand would not suffer have been strictli charg by tau who
foresaw that such a thing might happen to keep him who wa call the
scribe rasa safe in the heart of hi forc in vain did khian plead
those said the offic were hi order and he must obei them
on the third afternoon of their march thei learn from desert men
that thei drew near to the babylonian host which wa encamp over
against the fort that apepi had built as it wa still too far awai
to be reach that night and those on foot were veri weari it
gener halt the five thousand to eat and rest at a place where
there wa water give order that the forc wa to march again at
midnight by the light of the set moon which if all went well
should bring them to the armi shortli after dawn
thi plan wa carri out at midnight thei broke camp and went
forward through the hot desert air by the light of the half moon when
thei had march for about two hour temu caus hi chariot to be
brought alongsid that of khian and though the princ wa somewhat
silent talk on to him after hi fashion for none guess that on
the farther side of a certain rise of ground the five and twenti
thousand horsemen whom apepi had despatch to fall upon the flank of
the babylonian were creep toward them purpos to attack the
camp of the great armi at the first break of dawn why should it be
guess see that outpost rode ahead of them to give warn of
ani danger how could thei know that those outpost had been
surround and captur or kill when as thei thought thei were
ride into the fring of the host of babylon thu give the
shepherd warn of the approach of foe
brother said temu dure all thi while you have been veri
impati complain of your wound which will get quit well in
time though it mai leav you stiffleg and lame for life
complain becaus you were kept yonder in the hill instead of
thank the god that you ever reach them safe by the help of
those roughtongu but courag arab brethren who gave themselv
fanci name for which fault as your elder in our order i have
often reprov you sai that like myself you should have faith now
you see the end of it name that faith ha triumph as it alwai
doe within an hour or two we shall reach the mighti host of babylon
and make obeis to tau the prophet of the dawn all our troubl
ar end or rather all your troubl sinc becaus of faith i
never doubt but that thei would melt awai
at thi moment temu himself melt awai for a javelin or an arrow
pierc hi chariot through the heart so that the man fell dead on
the flank of the hors caus them to start forward at full gallop
in their fright and charg through the rank to vanish at speed
into the desert while temu clung to the chariot rail and grasp
wildli at the rein the hors were good hors be inde two of
those that had born them on their gallop from the water to the hill
now fat and strong again thei rush on up the rise thei came among
the shepherd troop where the line wa thin thei broke through it
unharm be scarc seen in the dim light befor thei were gone
thei gallop on across the sand smell other hors ahead of
them or perchanc it wa water that thei smelt at least thei rush
on while temu flung to the bottom of the chariot drag at the
rein in vain that is he drag onc or twice then let them be
mutter
faith have faith these accurs beast must go where fate drive
them and i see no more soldier
present howev he saw plenti for now the chariot heedless of
the challeng of the sentri wa rush down the central avenu of
the babylonian camp at length the feet of on of the hors becam
entangl in the rope of a tent so that it fell bring down it
companion with it and temu roll on to the ground in front of a
gener who wa give order to some offic
who is thi ask the gener testili and what doe that chariot
here take it awai
then temu know the voic sat up and said
o holi prophet as i understand that you ar now that roi is dead o
father tau that is if a prophet and father of the dawn can be clad
in armour which is against all the rule i am temu a priest of your
brotherhood as you mai rememb for it wa you who sent me on a
certain busi to the court of apepi king of the north sinc which
time i have suffer mani thing
i rememb you brother said tau but whenc come you in thi
chariot and why
i do not know prophet on moment i wa talk to him who is call
the scribe rasa with whom i have share mani adventur but who i
think ha anoth name and the next my chariot pitch forward
with a missil through hi breast and those mad brute of hors on
which he fell were drag me awai whither i knew not all i know is
that we pass through a host clad in such armour as the shepherd
us for the moonlight shone upon it and upon apepi banner which i
knew well for i saw enough of them at tani then the hors
direct of heaven came on here and that is all the stori
the scribe rasa exclaim a woman voic that of nefra who
see the fall of the hors had come from her tent accompani by
ru to learn it caus where did you leav the scribe rasa priest
ceas from question niec broke in tau can you not understand
that the forc we sent some dai ago to rescu a certain garrison ha
been ambush and that by some accid thi brother ha escap to
bring us tide or perchanc he ad as a thought struck him
apepi armi ha move from it defenc to attack us from the south
present when the sun rise
then he gave certain order trumpet blew captain ran up men by
the thousand still yawn took their appoint place all the
awaken camp burst into activ martial life
meanwhil not so veri far awai a desper battl rage the five
and twenti thousand of the shepherd attack who thought themselv
attack hurl themselv upon the five thousand babylonian who had
march into their midst the babylonian be alert and well
offic strove to cut a path through the shepherd ay and did
so lose mani men as thei struggl forward squadron rush on
them dimli seen in the moonlight and were beaten back there wa
charg and countercharg hors scream men fell and groan out
their live
the moon grew dark but still the battl went on in the twilight that
preced the dawn when it wa difficult to distinguish friend from
foe the light of dai began to gather and by it the captain of the
babylonian saw that he could advanc no more nor could he fly for
the cloud of apepi hors wa all about him therefor he made a
squar of those who remain to him perhap two thousand or more
sound men and mani wound and gave order that none must surrend
sinc thi wa a fight to the death for the honour of babylon
when apepi captain in the gather light perceiv with how small
a bodi thei had to do thei were dismai who thought that all thi
while thei had been attack the flank of the babylonian host in the
dark and now the dawn had come and their opportun wa gone
thei had fail in their mission and how could thei face apepi with
such a tale in the fight thei had seiz prison some of them
wound those men thei question under threat of death by torment
or with beat from some of these thei drew the truth that thi wa
but a forc of babylonian skirmish sent to reliev an outpost which
thei were bring back with them to the armi
who then is the man that sit in a chariot among the horsemen
ask apepi captain
the prison answer that thei did not know whereon he order them
to be flog a while and then repeat hi question thu he learn
that thi lord in the chariot wa none other than khian the princ
whom he himself had been order to captur when he wa escap from
egypt for though the prison gave onli the name of rasa the scribe
well he knew that rasa and khian were the same man
then that captain saw light in the midst of a great dark he had
fail it wa true he had not fallen upon the flank of the armi of
babylon at thi hour of dawn or thrown it into confus and panic
as he had hope to do but instead had becom engag with a petti
forc of which the destruct would help apepi not at all but now he
learn that with that forc wa on whose captur would mean as much
or more to apepi as a great slaughter of the babylonian instantli
he made up hi mind he would not try to attack the armi of the great
king it wa too late no he would destroi these horsemen and take
the princ khian live or dead as an offer to apepi hope thu
to assuag hi wrath
instantli he gave order and the attack began be mount neither
side had bow and now javelin were few therefor the frai must be
fought out with sword the babylonian had picket their hors in
the centr of the squar or given them to the wound there to hold
turn themselv into footsoldi moreov by command of their
gener with hand and stone and cook vessel thei were heap
the desert sand into a bank which with two thousand men or more
labour at it for their live rose as though by magic for the sand
wa soft and easi to handl at thi bank the shepherd charg from
everi side but the babylonian squar set on the crest of a desert
sand wave wa small for it gener had drawn up hi men three deep
each line stand behind the other therefor onli a few of the
cloud of apepi horsemen could come at them at onc and at these
the babylonian stab with their sword or cut at the hors leg
as thei scrambl up the sand slope lame them or caus them to
scream in agoni and rush awai
soon apepi captain saw that victori would be slow which fit hi
plan but ill everi moment he wa in fear lest the outpost of the
great armi should discov what wa pass not so veri far awai and
send out a mighti forc to destroi him he fear also that the
wound man in the chariot whom he guess to be the princ khian
might be kill in the fight wherea he desir to take him live
to apepi lastli he fear that even if he were not attack soon he
and hi horsemen would be cut off from egypt and driven back into the
desert to perish there of thirst and hunger therefor ceas from
hi onslaught he sent offic under a flag of truce to the
babylonian gener charg to deliv thi messag
your case is desper sinc i outnumb you ten to on surrend
and in the name of apepi i promis you your live fight on and i will
destroi you all
the babylonian heard but be a crafti man would give no immedi
answer for he too hope that new of their plight would reach the
great armi either through messeng whom he had despatch when thei
were first attack or otherwis therefor desir to gain time he
repli that he must take counsel with hi offic and present
would let their mind be known he went to the centr of the squar and
come to khian told him all
now what shall we do he ask if we continu the fight we must
soon be overwhelm yet surrend we cannot for the honour of
babylon inde first will i fall upon my sword
it seem that you have answer your own question gener repli
khian smile yet here is my poor counsel offer to give me up for
you know well who i am and it is whom thei seek i think that if you
do thi that captain will let the rest of you go free
now even in hi sore strait that gener laugh aloud sai
have you bethought you princ for sinc you have declar yourself
i call you what you ar how i should be greet by the princ abeshu
also name the lord tau who command the armi of the great king and
by a certain ladi who march with that armi if i return to tell them
such a tale rather would i die princ with honour upon the field
than shame befor all the host of babylon no i have anoth plan i
will parlei with these shepherd as on who bargain ask for the
promis of safeti in write and while i do so all must creep to
their hors take the lightli wound behind them and leav the
rest to fate then suddenli we will charg upon the shepherd and now
that we have light cut our wai through or perish
so be it said khian but in hi heart were thought that hi lip
did not utter he knew that such a charg made by weari men upon
weari hors could not succe that if it were attempt all who
remain aliv of the babylonian horsemen would perish togeth with
those on foot among them hi host of the mountain garrison and that
the wound would be slaughter where thei lai he wa sure also that
what the shepherd captain want wa himself not the live of more
babylonian horsemen whose slai or escap could make no differ
to the issu of the war and that if he could secur the great prize
he would turn and ride for egypt therefor certainli it wa laid upon
him to offer up himself as a sacrific he shiver at the thought
know that thi meant death perhap death by tortur at the hand
of apepi and what wa wors that never more after all that he had
suffer could he hope to look upon the face of nefra beneath the sun
oh he must choos and choos at onc
khian cast down hi ey and with all hi soul prai to that spirit
whom he had learn to worship that he might find guidanc in hi
agoni lo it seem to come it seem as though there amidst the
stamp and neigh of hors the groan of the wound the order of
offic who have receiv the gener word alreadi were make
prepar for that last wild rush for life he heard the quiet
wellrememb voic of roi sai
my son follow after duti even down the road of sacrific and leav
the rest to god
khian hesit no longer he wa alon in the chariot for it driver
had descend to give the hors the last of the forag thei had
carri with them and a sup of water that remain and stood at a
distanc watch them finish their food as best thei could for the
bit in their mouth hamper them he seiz the rein he smote the
stallion with the whip and the beast sprang forward
now thei had come to the low bank of sand and were scrambl over it
drag the light war chariot after them some fifti pace awai and
as mani perhap from the first of apepi horsemen stood the gener
of the babylonian and on offic talk to the captain of the
shepherd also accompani by on offic a man whom he knew well
enough for thei had serv togeth in the syrian war thei had
turn and did not see him come or hear the chariot wheel on the
soft sand apepi captain had grown angri and cri in a loud voic
hear my last offer give up to me the princ khian who is with you
and you and your soldier mai go free refus and i will kill you
everi on and take him live or dead to hi father apepi the
pharaoh answer i speak no more
i will answer said khian from the chariot whereon thei turn in
amaz and stare i am the princ khian and you friend know me
well i too know you for a man of honour and accept your promis to
let these babylonian go their wai unharm take their wound with
them and in payment i surrend myself to you is it sworn
it is sworn princ said the captain salut yet rememb that
apepi is veri wrath with your high he ad slowli as though in
warn
i rememb answer khian then he turn to the babylonian
gener who all thi while had stood like on transfix and said
sai to the lord tau and to the ladi of egypt that i have gone where
my duti call me and that if it be decre that we should meet no
more i trust that thei will not think ill of me see that what
seem fals often is the truth and that sometim ill deed ar done
for good end for the rest let them judg as thei will of me who
follow my own light
lord exclaim the gener like on who wake from sleep sure
you do not desert us for the shepherd
am i not a shepherd ask khian smile strang farewel
friend good fortun go with you and your compani no drop of whose
blood shall be shed for me
then he call to the hors and thei went forward while the gener
wrung hi hand and mutter the name of strang babylonian god
i do not understand your high said apepi captain as he walk
by the chariot back toward hi horsemen which is not strang sinc
alwai you were differ from other men and i am wonder whether

you see opportun you will not escap to them lest i should be
forc to kill you

mad mutter the captain still if he ha lost hi wit he will
keep hi word and that mai save my head
chapter xxii
khian return to tani
swiftli the shepherd horsemen gallop back toward apepi fort
across the border line of egypt leav their wound to follow after
them as best thei might or perish and in the centr of their arrai
surround by a guard race the chariot of khian their captain knew
there wa no time to lose for soon those babylonian whom he had
spare would be at the camp of the great kingand then what he
did not know wa that two hour befor temu had reach that camp and
that alreadi a mount armi wa sweep down to cut him off
far awai in the desert appear a cloud of dust it grew nearer and
more near and now through the dust shone helm and spear and
burnish chariot then the shepherd knew the worst their path wa
block babylon wa upon them flight wa imposs their case now
wa that of the five thousand whom thei had surpris not twelv hour
befor and thei must charg as these had done and with as littl
hope of victori
thei drew togeth thei line up their squadron to the shape of a
wedg skilfulli enough as khian note and rush forward bear
somewhat to the right that thei might strike the babylonian line
where it wa thinnest the two armi drew near togeth some twenti
thousand of the shepherd against fifti thousand of their foe who
were mass in dens squadron divid by compani of chariot a
roar of triumph went up from the babylonian but the doom shepherd
were silent
apepi captain appear by the chariot of khian
princ he cri as he gallop the god ar against me and i
think that our end is near yet i trust to you to rememb your oath
upon faith of which i spare your compani and to make no effort to
escap if you ar captur it is so decre but while you ar abl
i repeat i trust to you to head straight for the boundari which is
near and to surrend yourself to apepi or hi troop do i trust in
vain
my honour ha never yet been doubt khian call back
then that captain salut with hi sword and spur hi hors
vanish awai
with a shock and a sound like thunder the hord of horsemen met deep
into the babylonian arrai cut the shepherd wedg throw men and
steed to either side of it as a galedriven ship throw wave of the
sea yet slowli apepi squadron lost their speed as more and more of
the babylonian pour upon their flank the point of the wedg
pass through the first group becam engag with fresh squadron
beyond that escort a compani of chariot which had race in front
to cut them off
the fight grew desper slowli those befor him were kill
scatter or trodden down so that khian found hi chariot in the
forefront of the battl at a littl distanc he perceiv a throng of
the shepherd some of them dismount attack a few of the
babylonian who were gather round a splendid chariot that had
outrac the rest whereof the wound hors were struggl on the
ground in thi chariot sword in hand wa on clad in mail that
seem to be fashion of silver and gold whom he took to be a
beauti youth doubtless some princel of the royal hous of
babylon sent out to look upon the face of war while on that side of
it on which the shepherd six or eight of them press their attack
stood a blackfac giant hung about with plate of brazen armour that
clank as he swung hi great ax aloft and brought it crash down
upon those within it reach on glanc told khian that thi wa the
mighti ethiopian ru himself then with a sick heart he understood the
figur in the chariot wa no nobl babylonian youth but none other
than nefra hi betroth
oh she wa sore beset horsemen were come to her aid but the
nearest of them were still a full bowshot awai for in her fierc
folli she had outdriven them all ru smote and smote but he could not
be everywher and while some drew him to the rear of the chariot
which thei were strive to enter from behind other five or six of
them ran togeth at it side purpos to rush forward and kill or
drag awai her who stood therein it wa as if thei knew that thi wa
a prize inde on for whose sake all must be risk and as he came
nearer khian perceiv how thei knew for now he saw that about her
silver helm she wore the snakehead coronet the royal uraeu with
the sparkl ey that proclaim her egypt queen the men
gather watch ru as with savag war cri he beat down foe after
foe and wait their chanc to spring upon their prei and pierc her
through or captur her
khian thought for a moment
i swore not to escap but never that i would not fight upon my wai
to doom he said to himself and pull at the rein turn the
rush hors straight upon that knot of men as he came the first of
them leapt at nefra she smote with her sword and the blow fell upon
hi thick headdress he shot out hi long arm for he wa a great
fellow and grip her round the middl drag her to him the
other stood wait to seiz her as she fell to the ground and carri
her off if thei could or kill her if thei could not so eagerli did
thei watch that thei never saw or heard the whitehors war chariot
thunder down upon them from where thei knew there were no foe khian
call to the stallion beast train to war and turn neither to
left nor right thei rush on thei smote those men and down thei went
beneath the hoof and wheel onli on remain stand he who
drag nefra from the chariot in khian hand wa a spear he hurl
it as he pass and it pierc that man through and through so that
loos hi grip of nefra he fell to the ground and di
now ru had seen and wa rush back nefra freed stare at her
delivererand knew him
khian she cri khian come to me
ru knew him also and shout
halt lord rasa
but khian onli shook hi head and gallop on
then the babylonian deliver came up as a flood come along a dry
river bed and cover all but alreadi khian wa far off with the
remnant of the shepherd hors
the battl roll awai of the twenti thousand shepherd or more but
some few hundr escap the rest were cut or hunt down befor
thei reach the border line of egypt but among those who came
unharm to the armi of apepi wa the princ khian for through all
that frai it wa as though some god protect him and the hors that
drew hi chariot on he drove till he saw where a gener standard
flew then he halt the bloodstain weari beast and call aloud
i am the princ khian come bear me henc for i am hurt and cannot
walk
the offic who heard him salut and their men cheer for thei
thought that the princ khian whom thei love and who had been their
comrad in the syrian war had escap from the babylonian that he
might fight against them with hi own peopl tenderli thei lift him
from the chariot and gave him wine and food the best thei had then
place him in a litter such as thei us for wound men and bore him
to the royal encamp in and around the newbuilt fort over these
fort flew pharaoh banner yet when thei came to them thei found
confus and open gate pharaoh herald announc had been call
back to tani leav order to hi armi to follow after him that
thei might reform there to protect the great citi and egypt
now when the captain heard these command thei stare at each other
and murmur but khian look back across the frontier line
learn their reason yonder the sand were black with all the order
host of babylon on thei came foot and hors and chariot a mighti
flood of men befor the shock of whose onslaught the armi of the
shepherd must have broken and gone down therefor it wa that when
he learn that hi flank attack had miscarri and saw all the might
of babylon sweep down upon him apepi had fled to tani leav
hi troop to follow as best thei could
understand at last how matter stood some of the chief offic
came to khian and prai him to take command of the armi by right of
hi rank and reput in war but he smile and remain silent as thei
thought becaus he wa sick and could not stand upon hi feet while
thei still press him there came that captain to whom he had sworn
the oath and who like himself had escap the slaughter of apepi
horsemen call them asid he told hi comrad of how he had
captur the princ among the babylonian and the rest then thei
press khian no more though had he chosen to put anoth colour on
the tale perhap thei would still have listen or had he offer to
go to the babylonian and prai the clemenc of the queen of egypt and
of the princ abeshu their gener for pharaoh armi perhap thei
would also have listen but as he did neither of these thing thei
yoke fresh hors to hi chariot and set him in it took him with
them in their flight to tani
thu it came about that when the babylonian pour up to the camp of
the shepherd to give them battl save for some sick and wound men
thei found them gone learn the truth from these men who by tau
command were spare and care for also that the princ khian had come
in safeti to the camp and been welcom there and as some said wa
now in command of the retreat armi at onc thei start in
pursuit
at their first bivouac tau with some of the gener under him
wait upon nefra there be present also ru temu the priest and
the ladi kemmah by the wish of tau nefra and ru told all the tale of
their meet with khian in the battl of the horsemen and of how he
had driven hi hors over those who attack nefra thrust hi spear
through him who wa drag her from the chariot and then when thei
call to him to stai with them had shaken hi head and fled awai
make no attempt to check the hors as he might have done therebi
escap from the shepherd if he were their captiv
now when he had heard thi strang tale tau ask those present to
interpret it the babylonian gener on and all answer that
either thi princ wa mad or evid he wa a traitor it wa
clear thei said that otherwis he would have escap when he had
opportun and it wa also clear that be a shepherd and the son
of their king he had follow hi heart back to the shepherd and to
hi father kemmah who spoke next held that certainli he wa mad
for how she ask could a sane man fly awai from the loveliest woman
in the world to whom he wa affianc and on who wa a queen as
wellunless inde she ad as an afterthought sinc thei part
he had met on yet loveli word at which nefra sharpli bid her be
silent
then temu who had been the princ companion in hi captiv and
flight wa call upon but all he could do wa to mutter faith
have faith ad that in thi matter it wa easi becaus he could
not believ that ani on who had onc tast of the palac dungeon at
tani or of the tomb chamber in the dark of the pyramid could wish to
return to either of them again then he began to set out the tale of
their escap and of all that he had suffer on horseback and in the
chariot until an offic pull him back to hi seat
then spoke nefra ask angrili of the babylonian gener
have you ever known lord of a man who wish to plai the traitor
who began hi treacheri by kill sundri of those to whom he had sold
himself do you not understand that if thi princ wish to be rid of
me in order that in futur he might lai an undisput claim to the
doubl throne of egypt all he need to do wa to pass on and leav
those shepherd knave to kill me asru after hi fashion be
elsewher when he wa wanteddoubtless thei would have done yet he
drive hi chariot over four of them and pierc the fifth through
with hi spear thenth god alon know why though i doubt not for
some good reason other than that advanc by the ladi kemmah she
ad acidli he depart shake hi head and so swiftli that he
could not be caught as yonder priest sai to tast onc more of
apepi dungeon orher her voic grew faint and her ey fill
with tearsof wors thing
when thei had finish tau said
all who know the princ khian have learn that in some wai he is
differ from most men and it is probabl that among those
differ the truth mai be found inde i think that i have
discov it but if so as we have talk enough i will keep it to
myself until i know whether i be right or wrong meanwhil i would
ask you all to listen to the prayer of our brother temu and have
faith such as that which her majesti of egypt show when she rush
forth alon into battl against the command of those set over her
and now again show in him who preserv her from death
then he rose and depart from the tent leav nefra abash and yet
indign
those who remain of the armi of the frontier came at length to tani
which wa strongli held by apepi second armi of reserv thei were
not mani for the babylonian pursuit had been sharp and captur
thousand moreov when in thi wai or in that it becam known that
none of these were put to the sword or set asid to be sold as slave
but that all ask of them wa that thei should take an oath of fealti
to queen nefra of egypt and serv under her banner other thousand
grew weari of that rapid march and lag behind until thei were
overtaken by the babylonian picket
among the faith that at length straggl through it gate
howev were the princ khian and that captain to whom he had
surrend and sworn a certain oath togeth these two between whom
there wa now a bond of last friendship were brought to the palac
and to the wonder of khian place in the apart that had been hi
own when he wa princ and heir appar of the north here slave
wait upon him hi own slave and doctor came to treat hi knee
now much inflam and swollen with so long and rough a journei yet
as khian note with all of these were mingl spi and guard spi
to watch and note everi spoken word and guard to frustrat ani effort
at escap in short he wa now as close a prison as he had been in
that dungeon whenc he escap with temu
there in hi own place khian who had been brought to it at dawn
rest till the third hour after sunset sleep the most of thi
time save when he bath and at for he wa veri weari at length
came an offic and soldier with a litter to bear him into the
presenc of apepi hi father at the head of thi compani wa anath
the vizier who as khian note had grown thinner and more grai and
whose quick black ey dart from place to place as though everywher
he expect to see a murder and follow after him a sharpfac
scribe whom khian took to be a spy
anath bow a greet nice judg neither too scanti nor too full
sai
welcom home princ after long travel and mani adventur pharaoh
need your presenc be pleas to accompani me
then he wa set in hi litter born by eight soldier at the side of
which walk anath while the captain follow after in turn the
corner of on of the passag the long litter tilt and anath put out
hi hand to steadi it or to save himself from be press against
the wall while the spy for a moment wa left out of sight and hear
on the farther side of a corner swiftli anath whisper into khian
ear
the danger is great yet be calm and keep courag for you have
friend readi even to die for you of whom i am the first
then the spy appear and anath straighten himself and wa silent
thei came into the presenc of pharaoh who sat in a low chair clad in
mail with a sword in hi hand the litter wa set down and it bearer
help khian to a seat that wa place opposit to that of pharaoh
you seem to have taken some hurt son said apepi in a cold voic
who gave it to you
on of your majesti soldier dure a frai in a pass of certain
hill who overtook me when i wa fly from egypt a while ago
pharaoh
oh i heard some such tale but why were you fly from egypt
to save myself and to win anoth pharaoh
ye again i rememb the on who have done so far though with
damag the other you have not done and shall never do apepi said
slowli then he look at the captain who accompani khian and
ask
ar you that man whom i sent in command of some five and twenti
thousand hors to fall upon the flank of the babylonian if so tell
me why you fail in your task
in brief soldierlik word the captain told him all the stori how he
had met the bodi of babylonian hors dure the night and becom
engag with them how in the end khian had bought the live of those
of them who remain by hi surrend of himself how thei had fallen
in with the great forc of mount babylonian and chariot which in
the end destroi them nearli all how the princ khian had kept hi
word when he might have escap and thu wa now a prison at tani
and the rest
apepi listen till he had finish and said
enough man you have fail and by your failur have brought me to
the gate of ruin my armi is dispers and the babylonian under the
command of on of the accurs wizard of the dawn sweep down on
tani to captur it after which thei purpos to seiz all egypt and
set thi girl nefra as their puppet on it throne all these thing
have happen becaus you fail in the task i laid upon you and
instead of fall upon the babylonian flank were trap and wast
your strength and time in a petti fight with some few thousand men
for such as you there is no more place upon the earth get you down to
the underworld and there learn generalship if you mai
then he made a sign whereon certain arm slave ran forward the
captain answer noth to apepi turn to khian and salut him
sai
now princ i am sorri that i did not loos you from your oath and
bid you escap while you could for if i am treat thu what chanc
is there for you well i go to make report of these matter to osiri
who i have been told is a just god and an aveng of innoc blood
farewel
befor khian could answer the slave seiz the man and drag him
behind a curtain whenc present on of them reappear hold up a
human head to tell pharaoh that hi will wa done at thi sight for
the first time khian hate hi father and hope in hi heart that
apepi himself might be overtaken by the fate which he had brought upon
a loyal servant who had done hi best
now father and son were left alon and stare at each other in
silenc at length khian spoke
if it be the will of your majesti that i should follow on the path
that ha been trodden by yonder victim i prai that it mai be soon
sinc i am weari and would sleep
apepi laugh cruelli and answer
all in good time but not yet i think do you not understand son
that you ar the onli arrow left in my quiver it seem that by aid of
the art of these wizard of the dawn you have bewitch thi royal
egyptian in such fashion that she dote on you she the chosen of
your father from whom you stole her now how do you think it will
pleas her when she appear befor the wall of tani with the
babylonian as doubtless she will do tomorrow with the light if she
saw you her darl set upon the eastern gate and there about to die
as that fool di or in wors fashion
i do not know answer khian but i think that if such a thing
chanc veri soon tani would be given to fire and all that breath
within it wall would also die and with them onewho doe not wish
to die
you ar right my son mock apepi an angri woman with a hundr
thousand men behind her might commit such crime upon the helpless
therefor i propos to keep your head upon your shoulder at least
for the present thi is my plantel me if you do not think it good
you shall appear upon the gatewai and herald shall announc or
perhap thi would best be done by messeng that you ar about to
suffer death for treason in the presenc of pharaoh and hi court or
as mani of them as can find stand room upon that gatewai it will
be announc howev that pharaoh out of hi great piti and love
will spare you upon certain term can you perhap guess those term

chariot and sign a perpetu peac with us the shepherd the
babylonian armi retreat whenc it came
secondli that the princess nefra give up herself to me that in the
presenc of both armi and of the holi god the priest mai declar
her my wife and queen who bring to me as her dower all the right
and inherit that ar her by blood in egypt
never will she consent said khian
of cours son that is the danger sinc no on can tell what a
woman will or will not do but do you not think that if such should
chanc to be her mind and that she should determin that you must be
sacrif to what she hold her duti you who otherwis would be set
free among the babylonian the sight of a littl tortur and the
sound of your groan might work the need chang there ar some
clever black in thi place and by the wai that knee of your is
still swollen and pain is it not thei might begin there hot
ironsy hot iron
khian look at him and said in a low voic
do your worst devil who begat me if inde i am your son which now
is hard to believ you speak of the priest of the dawn as wizard
know that i am a priest of the dawn who share their wizardri or their
wisdom and it tell me that all your plot will fail and that your
wicked will fall back upon your own head
ah doe it i understand your scheme you think that you will kill

chapter xxiii
the queen of the dawn
befor the hour of dawn khian wa carri up the pylon stair to the
top of the eastern gate of tani it wa a larg flat place where
fifti or more might stand with comfort and be lame he wa seat
in a chair upon it eastern edg ra the sun aros and show him all
beneath him wa a wide moat fill with water from the nile but the
bridg which span it had been hoist up by the aid of rope and
pullei and wa made fast to the gatewai pillar
beyond the moat and almost at it edg for in their overwhelm
might thei seem to fear noth from their broken foe appear the
heart of the host of babylon whereof the wing alreadi encircl the
citi of tani cut off the escap of those who were within it
wall a littl wai back from the edg of thi moat though out of the
reach of arrow pavilion were pitch over which side by side
flew the royal ensign of egypt and babylon show to khian that
there rest nefra and the princ abeshu who wa also call the lord
tau for the rest the wall on either flank of the gatewai were
garrison by shepherd troop who seem restless and ill at eas
while on it top attend by anath and other councillor sat pharaoh
apepi gorgeous attir and wear the doubl crown of the upper and
the lower land
trumpet blew and guard gather about the royal pavilion after
which there wa silenc on the farther side of the moat behind the
outpost the order rank of the marshal babylonian soldier
stood stare up at the gatewai crest wall upon wall of white face
everi on as it seem to khian turn toward himself present a
messeng bear a white flag appear cross the moat upon a boat
and from it farther bank wa escort through the line to the
pavilion where flew the standard of babylon and egypt and there

deliv it to tau tau open it and read then said to nefra who
stood besid him largeei and haggardfac

in sight of the peopl of the shepherd and of the armi of babylon
what els my uncl
that if these term be refus then the princ khian will be
torment befor our ey until thei ar accept or until life leav

nefra face grew ashen she bow her head until it touch her knee
and rock her bodi to and fro then she straighten herself and
ask
what would khian wish that i should do i know i know he would wish
that i should defi apepi leav hi fate in the hand of god
have faith have faith mutter temu who wa seat behind her with
papyru on hi knee
ay brother went on nefra i have faith and if it fail me
well there is alwai death behind and in death i shall find khian
shall i of the ancient blood hi sworn betroth come to him beyond
the grave defil the woman of that dog of an old shepherd king
never shall babylon my great alli bow herself befor these runawai
who did not dare to await the battl never let khian die if die he
must and let me die with him but if so not on man shall be left
live in tani and not on man of shepherd blood throughout the
north write it down temu as the princ abeshu shall tell you and
let the messeng take it back to that cruel crossbr cur apepi and
let herald call it out to those who stand upon the gatewai and the
wall while the captain bid the attack begin at everi other mouth of
tani
tau heard and smile in hi slow secret wai then to offic mount
on swift hors he issu certain order on receipt of which present
thousand of men began to move to the onslaught upon the great citi
thi done he turn to temu and other scribe sai to them the
word that thei should write also he summon herald and caus them
to learn those word by heart and depart to shout them out at veri
gate
at length all wa readi and the messeng have receiv the roll
depart to the moat escort by ru who gave him anoth messag on
hi own account it wa
tell that sheep herder who call himself a king and tell all hi
councillor and the captain who remain to him that if a finger is
lift against the princ khian present i the ethiopian ru will
twist out their tongu and drive in their ey with my own finger
and afterward cast them into the desert to starv ay and your
also messeng if you fail to report thi my messag so that i can
hear you from thi shore of the moat
now the messeng look up at the giant nubian who glare down at him
grind hi great white teeth and swore that he would do hi bid
then he enter hi littl boat and cross the water wa admit
by a tini door in the gatewai tower so that present he appear
upon it crest and hand the write to apepi moreov as he had
sworn to do he repeat the messag of ru in a loud voic the word
of which seem to pleas those upon the gatewai littl for thei
gather into knot debat them fearfulli herald also call out
that which had been written in the roll so that all upon the wall
might learn and understand
khian bound upon the edg of the gatewai so that if spear were
thrown or arrow shot these might pierc him first heard the
proclam and wa glad becaus now he knew that not for hi life
sake would nefra be shame yet he turn hi head and spoke over hi
shoulder to apepi who stood behind him and to anath and the other
councillor sai
pharaoh and lord what the princ abeshu and the royal nefra have
sworn most certainli thei will do tortur and kill me befor their
ey if you desir but be sure that it will not chang their purpos
for not with my poor life can you bui their honour for myself i fear
not death but i ask of youi it your will to follow me everi on
of you and to give all the peopl of tani and the nation of the
shepherd to the sword if you spare me and set me free you and thei
will be spare if you lift a hand against me you and thei will die
i have spoken do what you will
now although becaus of hi bond he could not see what pass khian
heard tumult behind him he heard anath the vizier and other
councillor prai pharaoh to forego hi purpos becaus their case
and the case of the whole citi wa desper beleagu as thei were
by the countless host of babylon and it seem mad to die that
pharaoh might satisfi hi hate upon the princ hi son moreov
crowd from the citi who had also heard the proclam were rush
into the open space behind the gate sweep asid the soldier by
whom it wa guard and shout such word as
pharaoh spare the princ khian must we all die becaus you would
torment and murder him who wa born of you
then abov the tumult anath spoke again sai in a high cold voic
like on who threaten rather than prai
pharaoh thi is a veri evil busi the princ is belov in tani
and it is not well for king to kill those whom the peopl love when
the enemi is at their gate
now apepi answer hiss like on mad with rage
be silent anath and the rest of you or as i serv thi traitor so
shall you be serv slave to your task
behind khian aros guttur murmur it seem to him that the
black tormentor shrank from their offic again the furiou pharaoh
command but still thei hung back then came the sound of a blow and
groan and khian knew that he had cut on of them down and guess
that the other would no longer dare to resist hi will on the
farther side of the moat he saw ru the giant march to and fro like
a cage lion and shake hi great ax beyond him now were rang a
compani of archer their arrow set upon the string wait the
word to loos while behind the archer he perceiv tau and lean
on him nefra clad in her glitter mail then he lift up hi voic
and cri
ru hear mekhian bid the archer shoot for thu would i die
rather than in torment
he could sai no more for apepi step forward struck him heavili
upon the face and bade the tortur gag him a sight at which the
armi of babylon groan as did the inhabit of tani who now
pack the place of the gatewai in thousand ru roar out a curs
that sound like the bellow of a wound bull then turn repeat
khian word to the archer who lift their bow and look to tau
for the order to shoot but tau gave no order onli motion to them
to hold their hand while nefra sank to her knee as though she
swoon
khian becam awar of black hand tear at hi garment then there
wa a smell of fire and an agoni dart through him the slow
sacrific wa begun he shut hi ey make hi soul readi to
depart
there wa a sound behind him a veri strang sound of wrestl and
blow he open hi ey and look past him stagger backward
went the form of pharaoh and in hi breast wa fix a knife at the
edg of the gatewai platform he stop cling to the seat in which
khian wa bound
dog he gasp dog of a vizier i have spare you too long it
should have been done last night but i wait
ay answer the voic of anath you overshot yourself pharaoh
and gave the dog time to bite awai with you to set sonmurder
a wither form that of anath leapt forward it black ey gleam
in the yellow wrinkl face a thin arm smote with the tormentor
heart iron at the hand that grip the seat crush and burn
them apepi loos hi hold and with a cry fell backward into the
moat beneath
ru saw him fall and leap into the water swim with great
stroke as the pharaoh rose he seiz him with hi mighti hand and
drag him to the bank where he broke him like a stick then cast him
to the shore
pharaoh apepi is dead pipe the thin voic of anath but pharaoh

again he wa help forth as he thought into a larg place where
whisper ran as though from a gather multitud someon bade him

far awai a voic cri
ra is risen and from all round him rose a sound of sing
he knew the sound it wa that of the ancient chant with which on dai
of festiv the brotherhood of the dawn greet the rise of the sun
it di awai there wa deep silenc he heard a rustl as of robe
then suddenli and in unison from a hundr throat there rose a great
cry of

peril and now from sick and the gate of death ha brought me
with joi to those of health will be with us in the year to come
