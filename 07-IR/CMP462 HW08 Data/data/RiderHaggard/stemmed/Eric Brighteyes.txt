eric brightey is a romanc found on the iceland saga what is
a saga is it a fabl or a true stori the answer is not altogeth
simpl for such saga as those of burnt njal and grettir the strong
partak both of truth and fiction historian disput as to the
proport thi wa the manner of the saga growth in the earli dai
of the iceland communitythat republ of aristocratssai between the
date 900 and 1100 of our era a quarrel would aris between two great
famili as in the case of the njal saga it caus probabl wa the
ill do of some nobl woman thi quarrel would lead to manslaught
then blood call for blood and a vendetta wa set on foot that end
onli with the death by violenc of a major of the actor in the drama
and of larg number of their adher in the cours of the feud men
of heroic strength and mould would come to the front and perform deed
worthi of the iron ag which bore them women also would help to
fashion the tale for good or ill accord to their natur gift
and charact at last the tragedi wa cover up by death and time
leav onli a few dint shield and haunt cairn to tell of those
who had plai it lead part
but it fame live on in the mind of men from gener to gener
skald wander through the winter snow much as homer mai have
wander in hi dai across the grecian vale and mountain to find a
welcom at everi stead becaus of the oldtim stori thei had to tell
here night after night thei would sit in the ingl and while awai
the weari of the dayless dark with histori of the time when men
carri their live in their hand and thought them well lost if there
might be a song in the ear of folk to come to alter the tale wa on
of the greatest of crime the skald must repeat it as it came to him
but by degre undoubtedli the saga did suffer alter the fact
remain the same inde but around them gather a mist of miracul
occurr and legend to take a singl instanc the account of
the burn of bergthorsknol in the njal saga is not onli a piec of
descript write that for vivid simpl forc and insight is scarc
to be match out of homer and the bibl it is also obvious true we
feel as we read that no man could have invent that stori though some
great skald threw it into shape that the tale is true the writer of
eric can testifi for saga in hand he ha follow everi act of the
drama on it veri site there he who dig beneath the surfac of the
lone mound that look across plain and sea to westman isl mai still
find trace of the burn and see what appear to be the black sand
with which the hand of bergthora and her women strew the earthen
floor some nine hundr year ago and even the greasi and clot
remain of the whei that thei threw upon the flame to quench it he mai
discov the place where fosi drew up hi men where skarphedinn di
sing while hi leg were burnt from off him where kari leapt from
the flame ruin and the dell in which he laid down to restat everi
step in short the truth of the narr becom more obviou and yet
the tale ha been ad to for unless we mai believ that some human
be ar gift with second sight we cannot accept as true the
prophet vision that came to runolf thorstein son or that of njal
who on the even of the onslaught like theoclymenu in the odyssei
saw the whole board and the meat upon it on gore of blood
thu in the nors romanc now offer to the reader the tale of eric
and hi deed would be true but the dream of asmund the witchcraft of
swanhild the incid of the speak head and the vision of eric
and skallagrim would ow their origin to the imagin of success
gener of skald and final in the fifteenth or sixteenth
centuri the stori would have been written down with all it
supernatur addit
the tendenc of the human mindand more especi of the nors
mindi to suppli uncommon and extraordinari reason for action and
fact that ar to be ampli account for by the work of natur
forc swanhild would have need no familiar to instruct her in her
evil scheme eric would have want no lovedraught to bring about hi
overthrow our common experi of mankind as it is in opposit to
mankind as we fabl it to be is suffici to teach us that the passion
of on and the human weak of the other would suffic to these end
the natur magic the beauti and inher power of such a woman
as swanhild ar thing more forc than ani spell magician have
invent or ani demon thei ar suppos to have summon to their
aid but no saga would be complet without the intervent of such
extran forc the need of them wa alwai felt in order to throw
up the act of hero and heroin and to invest their person with
an ad import even homer felt thi need and did not scrupl to
introduc not onli second sight but god and goddess and to bring
their supernatur agenc to bear directli on the personag of hi
chant and that far more freeli than ani nors sagaman a word mai be
ad in explan of the appear of familiar in the shape
of anim an instanc of which will be found in thi stori it wa
believ in iceland as now by the finn and eskimo that the passion
and desir of sorcer took visibl form in such creatur as wolv
or rat these were call send and there ar mani allus to
them in the saga
anoth peculiar that mai be briefli allud to as emin
characterist of the saga is their fate as we read we seem
to hear the voic of doom speak continu thing will happen as
thei ar fate that is the keynot of them all the nors mind had
littl belief in free will less even than we have todai men and women
were born with certain charact and tendenc given to them in order
that their live should run in appoint channel and their act bring
about an appoint end thei do not these thing of their own desir
though their desir prompt them to the deed thei do them becaus thei
must the norn as thei name fate have map out their path long and
long ago their feet ar set therein and thei must tread it to the end
such wa the conclus of our scandinavian ancestorsa belief forc
upon them by their intens realis of the futil of human hope
and scheme of the terror and the tragedi of life the vaniti of it
desir and the untravel gloom or sleep dreamless or dreamful
which li beyond it end
though the saga ar entranc both as exampl of literatur of which
there is but littl in the world and becaus of their live interest
thei ar scarc known to the englishspeak public thi is easi
to account for it is hard to persuad the nineteenth centuri world to
interest itself in peopl who live and event that happen a thousand
year ago moreov the saga ar undoubtedli difficult read the
archaic natur of the work even in a translat the multitud of it
actor the nors sagaman habit of interweav endless sideplot
and the persist with which he introduc the genealog and
adventur of the ancestor of everi unimport charact ar none of
them to the tast of the modern reader
eric brightey therefor is clip of these peculiar and
to some extent is cast in the form of the romanc of our own dai
archaism be avoid as much as possibl the author will be
gratifi should he succe in excit interest in the troubl live
of our nors forefath and still more so if hi difficult experi
bring reader to the sagasto the prose epic of our own race too
ampl too prolix too crowd with detail thei cannot inde vie in
art with the epic of greec but in their pictur of life simpl and
heroic thei fall beneath no literatur in the world save the iliad and
the odyssei alon

how asmund the priest found groa the witch

to run under the lee of the westman isl in a great gale from the
northeast wa dash to piec on a rock and all those on board of
her were caught in the net of ran and drown except groa herself
who wa save by her magic art thi at the least is true that as
asmund the priest rode down by the seashor on the morn after the
gale seek for some strai hors he found a beauti woman
who wore a purpl cloak and a great girdl of gold seat on a rock
comb her black hair and sing the while and at her feet wash

thei spoke no more with her at that time see that she wa a
witchwoman but asmund took her up to middalhof and gave her a farm
and she live there alon and he profit much by her wisdom
now it chanc that gudruda the gentl wa with child and when her time
came she gave a daughter birtha veri fair girl with dark ey on
the same dai groa the witchwoman brought forth a girlchild and men
wonder who wa it father for groa wa no man wife it wa women
talk that asmund the priest wa the father of thi child also but when
he heard it he wa angri and said that no witchwoman should bear a
bairn of hi howsoev fair she wa nevertheless it wa still said
that the child wa hi and it is certain that he love it as a man
love hi own but of all thing thi is the hardest to know when groa
wa question she laugh darkli as wa her fashion and said that she
knew noth of it never have seen the face of the child father
who rose out of the sea at night and for thi caus some thought him
to have been a wizard or the wraith of her dead husband but other said
that groa li as mani women have done on such matter but of all thi
talk the child alon remain and she wa name swanhild
now but an hour befor the child of gudruda the gentl wa born asmund
went up from hi hous to the templ to tend the holi fire that burn
night and dai upon the altar when he had tend the fire he sat down
upon the crossbench befor the shrine and gaze on the imag of
the goddess freya he fell asleep and dream a veri evil dream
he dream that gudruda the gentl bore a dove most beauti to see
for all it feather were of silver but that groa the witch bore a
golden snake and the snake and the dove dwelt togeth and ever the
snake sought to slai the dove at length there came a great white swan
fly over coldback fell and it tongu wa a sharp sword now the
swan saw the dove and love it and the dove love the swan but the
snake rear itself and hiss and sought to kill the dove but the
swan cover her with hi wing and beat the snake awai then he
asmund came out and drove awai the swan as the swan had driven the
snake and it wheel high into the air and flew south and the snake
swam awai also through the sea but the dove droop and now it wa
blind then an eagl came from the north and would have taken the dove
but it fled round and round cry and alwai the eagl drew nearer
to it at length from the south the swan came back fly heavili and
about it neck wa twine the golden snake and with it came a raven
and it saw the eagl and loud it trumpet and shook the snake from it
so that it fell like a gleam of gold into the sea then the eagl and
the swan met in battl and the swan drove the eagl down and broke it
with hi wing and fly to the dove comfort it but those in the
hous ran out and shot at the swan with bow and drove it awai but now
he asmund wa not with them and onc more the dove droop again the
swan came back and with it the raven and a great host were gather
against them and among them all of asmund kith and kin and the men
of hi quarter and some of hi priesthood and mani whom he did not know
by face and the swan flew at bjrn hi son and shot out the sword of
it tongu and slew him and mani a man it slew thu and the raven
with a beak and claw of steel slew also mani a man so that asmund
kindr fled and the swan slept by the dove but as it slept the golden
snake crawl out of the sea and hiss in the ear of men and thei
rose up to follow it it came to the swan and twine itself about it
neck it struck at the dove and slew it then the swan awok and the
raven awok and thei did battl till all who remain of asmund
kindr and peopl were dead but still the snake clung about the swan
neck and present snake and swan fell into the sea and far out on the
sea there burn a flame of fire and asmund awok trembl and left
the templ
now as he went a woman came run and weep as she ran
hast hast she cri a daughter is born to thee and gudruda thy
wife is dy
is it so said asmund after ill dream ill tide
now in the bedcloset off the great hall of middalhof lai gudruda the
gentl and she wa dy

hearken my husband i have been a good wife to thee though thou hast
not been all good to me but thu shalt thou aton thou shalt swear
that though she is a girl thou wilt not cast thi bairn forth to
perish but wilt cherish and nurtur her

hour for after hi fashion he love hi wife

now it is said that as she spoke these word her face grew bright as
a spirit and have spoken them she fell back dead and thei laid

but when all wa over and done the dream that he had dream lai heavi
on him now of all divin of dream groa wa the most skill and
when gudruda had been in earth seven full dai asmund went to groa
though doubtfulli becaus of hi oath
he came to the hous and enter on a couch in the chamber lai groa
and her babe wa on her breast and she wa veri fair to see
greet lord she said what wouldest thou here
i have dream a dream and thou alon canst read it
that is as it mai be she answer it is true that i have some skill

then he unfold it to her everi word
what wilt thou give me if i read thy dream she said
what dost thou ask methink i have given thee much
yea lord and she look at the babe upon her breast i ask but a
littl thing that thou shalt take thi bairn in thy arm pour water
over it and name it
men will talk if i do thi for it is the father part
it is a littl thing what men sai talk goe by as the wind moreov
thou shalt give them the lie in the child name for it shall be
swanhild the fatherless nevertheless that is my price pai it if thou
wilt
read me the dream and i will name the child
nai first name thou the babe for then no harm shall come to her at
thy hand
so asmund took the child pour water over her and name her
then groa spoke thi lord is the read of thy dream els my wisdom
is at fault the silver dove is thy daughter gudruda the golden snake
is my daughter swanhild and these two shall hate on the other and
strive against each other but the swan is a mighti man whom both shall
love and if he love not both yet shall belong to both and thou shalt
send him awai but he shall return and bring bad luck to thee and thy
hous and thy daughter shall be blind with love of him and in the end
he shall slai the eagl a great lord from the north who shall seek to
wed thy daughter and mani anoth shall he slai by the help of that
raven with the bill of steel who shall be with him but swanhild shall
triumph over thy daughter gudruda and thi man and the two of them
shall die at her hand and for the rest who can sai but thi is
truethat the mighti man shall bring all thy race to an end see now i
have read thy rede
then asmund wa veri wroth thou wast wise to beguil me to name thy
bastard brat he said els had i been it death within thi hour
thi thou canst not do lord see that thou hast held it in thy
arm groa answer laugh go rather and lai out gudruda the fair
on coldback hill so shalt thou make an end of the evil for gudruda
shall be it veri root learn thi moreov that thy dream doe not
tell all see that thou thyself must plai a part in the fate go
send forth the babe gudruda and be at rest
that cannot be for i have sworn to cherish it and with an oath that
mai not be broken
it is well laugh groa thing will befal as thei ar fate let
them befal in their season there is space for cairn on coldback and
the sea can shroud it dead
and asmund went thenc anger at heart
ii
how eric told hi love to gudruda in the snow on coldback
now it must be told that five year befor the dai of the death of
gudruda the gentl saevuna the wife of thorgrimur ironto gave birth
to a son at coldback in the marsh on ran river and when hi father
came to look upon the child he call out aloud
here we have a wondrou bairn for hi hair is yellow like gold and hi
ey shine bright as star and thorgrimur name him eric brightey
now coldback is but an hour ride from middalhof and it chanc
in after year that thorgrimur went up to middalhof to keep the yule
feast and worship in the templ for he wa in the priesthood of asmund
asmundson bring the boi eric with him there also wa groa with
swanhild for now she dwelt at middalhof and the three fair children
were set togeth in the hall to plai and men thought it great sport to
see them now gudruda had a hors of wood and would ride it while eric
push the hors along but swanhild smote her from the hors and call
to eric to make it move but he comfort gudruda and would not and at
that swanhild wa angri and lisp out
push thou must if i will it eric
then he push sidewai and with such good will that swanhild fell
almost into the fire of the hearth and leap up she snatch a
brand and threw it at gudruda fire her cloth men laugh at thi
but groa stand apart frown and mutter witchword
why lookest thou so darkli housekeep said asmund the boi is
bonni and high of heart
ah he is bonni as no child is and he shall be bonni all hi
lifedai nevertheless she shall not stand against hi ill luck thi
i prophesi of him that women shall bring him to hi end and he shall
die a hero death but not at the hand of hi foe
and now the year went by peacefulli groa dwelt with her daughter
swanhild up at middalhof and wa the love of asmund asmundson but
though he forgot hi oath thu far yet he would never take her to wife
the witchwif wa anger at thi and she scheme and plot much
to bring it about that asmund should wed her but still he would not
though in all thing els she led him as it were by a halter
twenti full year had gone by sinc gudruda the gentl wa laid in
earth and now gudruda the fair and swanhild the fatherless were women
too eric too wa a man of fiveandtwenti year and no such man had
live in iceland for he wa strong and great of statur hi hair wa
yellow as gold and hi grei ey shone with the light of sword he
wa gentl and love as a woman and even as a lad hi strength wa the
strength of two men and there were none in all the quarter who could
leap or swim or wrestl against eric brightey men held him in honour
and spoke well of him though as yet he had done no deed but live at
home on coldback manag the farm for now thorgrimur ironto hi
father wa dead but women love him much and that wa hi banefor
of all women he love but on gudruda the fair asmund daughter he
love her from a child and her alon till hi dai of death and she
too love him and him onli for now gudruda wa a maid of maid most
beauti to see and sweet to hear her hair like the hair of eric wa
golden and she wa white as the snow on hecla but her ey were larg
and dark and black lash droop abov them for the rest she wa tall
and strong and come merri of face yet tender and the most witti of
women
swanhild also wa veri fair she wa slender small of limb and dark of
hue have ey blue as the deep sea and brown curl hair enough
to veil her to the knee and a mind of which none knew the end for
though she wa open in her talk her thought were dark and secret thi
wa her joi to draw the heart of men to her and then to mock them
she beguil mani in thi fashion for she wa the cunningest girl in
matter of love and she knew well the art of women with which thei
bring men to noth nevertheless she wa cold at heart and desir
power and wealth greatli and she studi magic much of which her
mother groa also had a store but swanhild too love a man and that
wa the joint in her har by which the shaft of fate enter her
heart for that man wa eric brightey who love her not but she
desir him so sore that without him all the world wa dark to
her and her soul but as a ship driven rudderless upon a winter
night therefor she put out all her strength to win him and bent her
witcheri upon him and thei were not few nor small nevertheless thei
went by him like the wind for he dream ever of gudruda alon and he
saw no ey but her though as yet thei spoke no word of love on to
the other
but swanhild in her wrath took counsel with her mother groa though
there wa littl like between them and when she had heard the
maiden tale groa laugh aloud
dost think me blind girl she said all of thi i have seen yea and
foreseen and i tell thee thou art mad let thi yeoman eric go and i
will find thee finer fowl to fly at
nai that i will not quoth swanhild for i love thi man alon and
i would win him and gudruda i hate and i would overthrow her give me
of thy counsel
groa laugh again thing must be as thei ar fate thi now is my
rede asmund would turn gudruda beauti to account and that man must
be rich in friend and monei who get her to wife and in thi matter
the mind of bjrn is as the mind of hi father now we will watch and
when a good time chanc we will bear tale of gudruda to asmund and to
her brother bjrn and swear that she overstep her modesti with
eric then shall asmund be wroth and drive eric from gudruda side
meanwhil i will do thi in the north there dwell a man mighti in all
thing and blown up with pride he is name ospakar blacktooth hi wife
is but late dead and he ha given out that he will wed the fairest
maid in iceland now it is in my mind to send koll the halfwit my
thrall whom asmund gave to me to ospakar as though by chanc he is a
great talker and veri clever for in hi halfwit is more cun than
in the brain of most and he shall so beprais gudruda beauti that
ospakar will come hither to ask her in marriag and in thi fashion if
thing go well thou shalt be rid of thy rival and i of on who look
scornfulli upon me but if thi fail then there ar two road left
on which strong feet mai travel to their end and of these on is that
thou shouldest win eric awai with thine own beauti and that is not
littl all men ar frail and i have a draught that will make the heart
as wax but yet the other path is surer
and what is that path my mother
it run through blood to black by thy side is a knife and in
gudruda bosom beat a heart dead women ar unmeet for love
swanhild toss her head and look upon the dark face of groa her
mother
methink with such an end to win i should not fear to tread that
path if there be need my mother
now i see thou art inde my daughter happi is to the bold to
each it come in uncertain shape some love power some wealth and
somea man take that which thou lovesti sai cut thy path to it and
take it els shall thy life be but a weari for what doe it serv
to win the wealth and power when thou lovest a man alon or the man
when thou dost desir gold and the pride of place thi is wisdom to
satisfi the long of thy youth for ag creep on apac and beyond is
dark therefor if thou seekest thi man and gudruda block thy
path slai her girlbi witchcraft or by steeland take him and in
hi arm forget that thine own ar red but first let us try the
easier plan daughter i too hate thi proud girl who scorn me as her
father lightoflov i too long to see that bright head of her dull
with the dust of death or at the least those proud ey weep tear
of shame as the man she hate lead her henc as a bride were it not
for her i should be asmund wife and when she is gone with thy
helpfor he love thee much and ha caus to love theethi i mai be
yet so in thi matter if in no other let us go hand in hand and match
our wit against her innoc
now koll the halfwit went upon hi errand and the time pass till
it lack but a month to yule and men sat indoor for the season wa
dark and much snow fell at length came frost and with it a clear sky
and gudruda ceas from her spin in the hall went to the woman
porch and look out saw that the snow wa hard and a great long
came upon her to breath the fresh air for there wa still an hour of
daylight so she threw a cloak about her and walk forth take the
road toward coldback in the marsh that is by ran river but swanhild
watch her till she wa over the hill then she also took a cloak and
follow on that path for she alwai watch gudruda
gudruda walk on for the half of an hour or so when she becam awar
that the cloud gather in the sky and that the air wa heavi with
snow to come see thi she turn homeward and swanhild hid
herself to let her pass now flake float down as big and soft as fifa
flower quicker and more quick thei came till all the plain wa on
white maze of mist but through it gudruda walk on and after her
crept swanhild like a shadow and now the dark gather and the
snow fell thick and fast cover up the track of her footstep and she
wander from the path and after her wander swanhild be loath to
show herself for an hour or more gudruda wander and then she call

by thy white swan but these shall be well wed and that will be a good
match for eric
let not thy tongu run on so fast said asmund sharpli who told thee
that eric should have gudruda
none told me but in truth have ey and ear i grew certain of
it said swanhild look at them now sure lover wear such face
now it chanc that gudruda had rest her chin on her hand and wa
gaze into eric ey beneath the shadow of her hair
methink my sister will look higher than to wed a simpl yeoman though
he is larg as two other men said bjrn with a sneer now bjrn wa
jealou of eric strength and beauti and did not love him
trust noth that thou seest and littl that thou hearest girl said
asmund rais himself from thought so shall thy guess be good
eric come here and tell us how thou didst chanc on gudruda in the
snow
i wa not so ill seat but that i could bear to stai grumbl eric
beneath hi breath but gudruda said go
so he went and told hi tale but not all of it for he intend to ask
gudruda in marriag on the morrow though hi heart prophesi no luck
in the matter and therefor he wa not overswift with it
in thi thing thou hast done me and mine good servic said asmund
coldli search eric face with hi blue ey it had been said if
my fair daughter had perish in the snow for know thi i would set
her high in marriag for her honour and the honour of my hous and so
some rich and nobl man had lost great joi but take thou thi gift in
memori of the deed and gudruda husband shall give thee anoth such
upon the dai that he make her wife and he drew a gold ring off hi
arm
now eric knee trembl as he heard and hi heart grew faint as
though with fear but he answer clear and straight
thy gift had been better without thy word ringgiv but i prai thee
to take it back for i have done noth to win it though perhap the
time will come when i shall ask thee for a richer
my gift have never been put awai befor said asmund grow angri
thi wealthi farmer hold the good gold of littl worth it is foolish
to take fish to the sea my father sneer bjrn
nai bjrn not so eric answer but as thou sayest i am but a
farmer and sinc my father thorgrimur ironto di thing have not
gone too well on ran river but at the least i am a free man and i will
take no gift that i cannot repai worth for worth therefor i will not
have the ring
as thou wilt said asmund pride is a good hors if thou ridest
wise and he thrust the ring back upon hi arm
then peopl go to rest but swanhild seek her mother and tell her all
that ha befallen her nor doe groa fail to listen
now i will make a plan she sai for these thing have chanc well
and asmund is in a ripe humour eric shall come no more to middalhof
till gudruda is gone henc led by ospakar blacktooth
and if eric doe not come here how shall i see hi face for mother
i long for the sight of it
that is thy matter thou lovesick fool know thi that if eric come
hither and get speech with gudruda there is an end of thy hope for
fair as thou art she is too fair for thee and strong as thou art in
a wai she is too strong thou hast heard how these two love and such
love mock at the will of father eric will win hi desir or die
beneath the sword of asmund and bjrn if such men can prevail against
hi might nai the wolf eric must be fenc from the lamb till he grow
hungri then let him search the fold and make spoil of thee for when
the best is gone he will desir the good
so be it mother as i sat crouch behind gudruda in the snow at
coldback i had half a mind to end her loveword with thi knife for
so i should have been free of her
ye and fast in the doomr thou wildcat the god help thi eric
if thou winnest him nai choos thy time and if thou must strike
strike secretli and home rememb also that cun is mightier than
strength that li pierc further than sword and that witchcraft win
where honesti must fail now i will go to asmund and he shall be an
angri man befor tomorrow come
then groa went to the shut bed where asmund the priest slept he wa
sit on the bed and ask her why she came
for love of thee asmund and thy hous though thou dost treat me ill
who hast profit so much by me and my foresight sai now wilt thou
that thi daughter of thine gudruda the fair should be the light mai
of yonder longleg yeoman
that is not in my mind said asmund stroke hi beard
knowest thou then that thi veri dai your white gudruda sat on eric
lap in the snow while he fondl her to hi heart content
most like it wa for warmth men do not dream on love in the hour of
death who saw thi
swanhild who wa behind and hid herself for shame and therefor she
held that these two must soon be wed ah thou art foolish now asmund
young blood make light of cold or death art thou blind or dost thou
not see that these two turn on each other like bird at nestingtim
thei might do wors said asmund for thei ar a proper pair and it
seem to me that each wa born for each
then all goe well still it is a piti to see so fair a maid cast like
rotten bait upon the water to hook thi troutlet of a yeoman thou hast
enemi asmund thou art too prosper and there ar mani who hate
thee for thy state and wealth were it not wise to us thi girl of
thine to build a wall about thee against the evil dai
i have been more wont housekeep to trust to my own arm than to
bought friend but tell me for at the least thou art farse how
mai thi be done as thing ar though i spoke roughli to him last
night i am inclin to let eric brightey take gudruda i have alwai
love the lad and he will go far
listen asmund sure thou hast heard of ospakar blacktoothth
priest who dwell in the north
ay i have heard of him and i know him there is no man like him for
ugli or strength or wealth and power we sail togeth on
a vike cruis mani year ago and he did thing at which my blood
turn and in those dai i had no chicken heart
with time men chang their temper unless i am mistaken thi ospakar
wish abov all to have gudruda in marriag for now that everyth
is hi thi alon is left for him to askth fairest woman in iceland
as a housewif think then with ospakar for a soninlaw who is there
that can stand against thee
i am not so sure of thi matter nor do i altogeth trust thee groa
of a truth it seem to me that thou hast some stake upon the race thi
ospakar is evil and hideou it were a shame to give gudruda over to him
when she look elsewher knowest thou that i swore to love and cherish
her and how run thi with my oath if eric is not too rich yet he is
of good birth and kin and moreov a man of men if he take her good
will come of it
it is like thee asmund alwai to mistrust those who spend their dai
in plot for thy weal do as thou wilt let eric take thi treasur
of thinefor whom earl would give their stateand live to rue it but
i sai thi if he have thy leav to roam here with hi dove the matter
will soon grow for these two sicken each to each and young blood is
hot and ill at wait and it is not alwai snowtim so betroth her
or let him go and now i have said
thy tongu run too fast the man is quit unprov and i will try him
tomorrow i will warn him from my door then thing shall go as thei
ar fate and now peac for i weari of thy talk and moreov it is
fals for thou lackest on thinga littl honesti to season all thy
craft what fee ha ospakar paid thee i wonder thou at least hadst
never refus the gold ring tonight for thou wouldst do much for
gold
and more for love and most of all for hate groa said and laugh
aloud nor did thei speak more on thi matter that night
now earli in the morn asmund rose and go to the hall awok
eric who slept by the centr hearth sai that he would talk with him
without then eric follow him to the back of the hall
sai now eric he said when thei stood in the grei light outsid the
hous who wa it taught thee that kiss keep out the cold on snowi
dai
now eric redden to hi yellow hair but he answer who wa it told
thee lord that i tri thi medicin
the snow hide much but there ar ey that can pierc the snow nai
more thou wast seen and there an end now know thisi like thee
well but gudruda is not for thee she is far abov thee who art but a
deedless yeoman
then i love to no end said eric i long for on thing onli and that
is gudruda it wa in my mind to ask her in marriag of thee todai
then lad thou hast thy answer befor thou askest be sure of on
thing if but onc again i find thee alon with gudruda it is my ax
shall kiss thee and not her lip
that mai yet be put to the proof lord said eric and turn to seek
hi hors when suddenli gudruda came and stood between them and hi
heart leapt at the sight of her
listen gudruda eric said thi is thy father word that we two
speak togeth no more
then it is an ill sai for us said gudruda lai her hand upon
her breast
sai good or ill so it sure is girl answer asmund no more
shalt thou go akiss in the snow or in the flower
now i seem to hear swanhild voic she said well such thing have
happen to better folk and a father wish is to a maid what the wind
is to the grass still the sun is behind the cloud and it will shine
again some dai till then eric fare thee well
it is not thy will lord said eric that i should come to thy
yulefeast as thou hast ask me these ten year past
now asmund grew wroth and point with hi hand toward the great
golden fall that thunder down the mountain name stonefel that is
behind middalhof and there ar no greater waterfal in iceland
a man mai take two road eric from coldback to middalhof on by the
bridlepath over coldback and the other down golden fall but i never
knew travel to choos thi wai now i bid thee to my feast by the
path over golden fall and if thou comest that wai i promis thee
thi if thou livest i will greet thee well and if i find thee dead
in the great pool i will bind on thy hellsho and lai thee to earth
neighbourli fashion but if thou comest by ani other path then my
thrall shall cut thee down at my door and he stroke hi beard and
laugh
now asmund spoke thu mockingli becaus he did not think it possibl
that ani man should try the path of the golden fall
eric smile and said i hold thee to thy word lord perhap i shall be
thy guest at yule
but gudruda heard the thunder of the mighti fall as the wind turn
and cri nai nayit were thy death
then eric find hi hors and ride awai across the snow
now it must be told of koll the halfwit that at length he came to
swinefel in the north have journei hard across the snow here
ospakar blacktooth had hi great hall in which dai by dai a hundr men
sat down to meat now koll enter the hall when ospakar wa at supper
and look at him with big ey for he had never seen so wonder a
man he wa huge in staturehi hair wa black and black hi beard
and on hi lower lip there lai a great black fang hi ey were small
and narrow but hi cheekbon were set wide apart and high like
those of a hors koll thought him an ill man to deal with and half a
troll and grew afraid of hi errand sinc in koll halfwitted
there wa much cunningfor it wa a cloak in which he wrap himself
but as ospakar sat in the high seat cloth in a purpl robe with
hi sword whitefir on hi knee he saw koll and call out in a great
voic
an ablebodi goblin
who is thi red fox that creep into my earth
for to look at koll wa veri like a fox
my name is koll the halfwit groa thrall lord am i welcom
here he answer
that is as it mai be why do thei call thee halfwit
becaus i love not work overmuch lord
then all my thrall ar fellow to thee sai what bring thee here
thi lord it wa told among men down in the south that thou wouldst
give a good gift to him who should discov to thee the fairest maid in
iceland so i ask leav of my mistress to come on a journei and tell
thee of her
then a lie wa told thee still i love to hear of fair maid and seek
on for a wife if she be but fair enough so speak on koll the fox and
lie not to me i warn thee els i will knock what wit ar left there
from that red head of thine
so koll took up the tale and greatli beprais gudruda beauti nor
in truth for all hi talk could he prais it too much he told of her
dark ey and the white of her skin of the nobl of her shape
and the gold of her hair of her wit and gentl till at length
ospakar grew afir to see thi flower of maid
by thor thou koll he said if the girl be but half of what thou
sayest her luck is good for she shall be wife to ospakar but if thou
hast li to me about her bewar for soon there shall be a knave the
less in iceland
now a man rose in the hall and said that koll spoke truth for he had
seen gudruda the fair asmund daughter and there wa no maid like her
in iceland
i will do thi now said blacktooth tomorrow i will send a
messeng to middalhof sai to asmund the priest that i purpos to
visit him at the time of the yulefeast then i shall see if the girl
pleas me meanwhil koll take thou a seat among the thrall and
here is someth for thy pain and he took off the purpl cloak and
threw it to him
thank to thee goldscatter said koll it is wise to go soon to
middalhof for such a bloom as thi maid doe not lack a bee there is
a youngl in the south name eric brightey who love gudruda and
she i think love him though he is but a yeoman of small wealth and
is onli twentyf year old
ho ho laugh great ospakar and i am fortyf but let not thi
suckl cross my desir lest men call him eric hollowey
now the messeng of ospakar came to middalhof and hi word pleas
asmund and he made readi a great feast and swanhild smile but gudruda
wa afraid
iv
how eric came down golden fall
now ospakar rode up to middalhof on the dai befor the yulefeast he
wa splendidli apparel and with him came hi two son gizur the
lawman and mord young men of promis and mani arm thrall and
servant gudruda watch at the women door saw hi face in the
moonlight and loath him
what thinkest thou of him who come to seek thee in marriag
fostersist ask swanhild watch at her side
i think he is like a troll and that seek as he will he shall not
find me i had rather lie in the pool beneath golden fall than in
ospakar hall
that shall be prove said swanhild at the least he is rich and
nobl and the greatest of men in size it would go hard with eric were
those arm about him
i am not so sure of that said gudruda but it is not like to be
known
come eric to the feast by the road of golden fall gudruda
nai no man mai try that path and live
then he will die for eric will risk it
now gudruda thought and a great fire burn in her heart and shone
through her ey if eric di she said on thee be hi blood
swanhildon thee and that dark mother of thine for ye have plot to
bring thi evil on us how have i harm thee that thou shouldst deal
thu with me
swanhild turn white and wickedlook for passion master her and
she gaze into gudruda face and answer how hast thou harm me
sure i will tell thee thy beauti ha rob me of eric love
it would be better to prate of eric love when he had told it thee
swanhild
thou hast rob me and therefor i hate thee and therefor i will
deliv thee to ospakar whom thou dost loathai and yet win brightey
to myself am i not also fair and can i not also love and shall i see
thee snatch my joi by the god never i will see thee dead and eric
with thee er it shall be so but first i will see thee shame
thy word ar illsuit to a maiden lip swanhild but of thi be
sure i fear thee not and shall never fear thee and on thing i know
well that whether thou or i prevail in the end thou shalt harvest the
greatest shame and in time to come men shall speak of thee with hatr
and name thee by ill name moreov eric shall never love thee from
year to year he shall hate thee with a deeper hate though it mai well
be that thou wilt bring ruin on him and now i thank thee that thou
hast told me all thy mind show me what inde thou art and gudruda
turn scornfulli upon her heel and walk awai
now asmund the priest went out into the courtyard and meet ospakar
blacktooth greet him heartili though he did not like hi look and
took him by the hand and led him to the hall that wa brave deck
with tapestri and seat him by hi side on the high seat and
ospakar thrall brought good gift for asmund who thank the giver
well
now it wa supper time and gudruda came in and after her walk
swanhild ospakar gaze hard at gudruda and a great desir enter into
him to make her hi wife but she pass coldli by nor look on him at
all
thi then is that maid of thine of whom i have heard tell asmund i
will sai thi fairer wa never born of woman
then men at and ospakar drank much al but all the while he stare at
gudruda and listen for her voic but as yet he said noth of what
he came to seek though all knew hi errand and hi two son gizur
and mord stare also at gudruda for thei thought her most wonderfulli
fair but gizur found swanhild also fair
and so the night wore on till it wa time to sleep
on thi same dai eric rode up from hi farm on ran river and took hi
road along the brow of coldback till he came to stonefel now all along
coldback and stonefel is a steep cliff face to the south that grow
ever higher till it come to that point where golden river fall over
it and part it water below run east and westth branch to the
east be call ran river and that to the west laxfor these two
stream girdl round the rich plain of middalhof till at length thei
reach the sea but in the midst of golden river on the edg of the
cliff a mass of rock jut up call sheepsaddl divid the water
of the fall and over thi the sprai fli and in winter the ic
gather but the river doe not cover it the great fall is thirti
fathom deep and shape like a horsesho of which the point lie
toward middalhof yet if he could but gain the sheepsaddl rock that
divid the midst of the water a strong and hardi man might climb down
some fifteen fathom of thi depth and scarc wet hi feet
now here at the foot of sheepsaddl rock the doubl arch of water
meet and fall in on torrent into the bottomless pool below but some
three fathom from thi point of the meet water and beneath
it just where the curv is deepest a singl crag as larg as a
drinkingt and no larger jut through the foam and if a man could
reach it he might leap from it some twelv fathom sheer into the
sprayhidden pit beneath there to sink or swim as it might befal thi
crag is call wolf fang
now eric stood for a long while on the edg of the fall and look
measur everi thing with hi ey then he went up abov where the
river swirl down to the precipic and look again for it is from
thi bank that the divid islandrock sheepsaddl must be reach
a man mai hardli do thi thing yet i will try it he said to himself
at last my honour shall be great for the feat if i chanc to live
and if i diewel there is an end of troubl after maid and all
other thing
so he went home and sat silent that even now sinc thorgrimur
ironto death hi housewif saevuna eric mother had grown dim
of sight and though she peer and peer again from her seat in the
ingl nook she could not see the face of her son
what ail thee eric that thou sittest so silent wa not the meat
then to thy mind at supper
ye mother the meat wa well enough though a littl undersmok
now i see that thou art not thyself son for thou hadst no meat but
onli stockfishand i never knew a man forget hi supper on the night

what troubl thee ericthat sweet lass yonder

thi that i go down golden fall tomorrow and i do not know how i
mai come from sheepsaddl rock to wolf fang crag and keep my life
whole in me and now i prai thee weari me not with word for my brain
is slow and i must us it
when she heard thi saevuna scream aloud and threw herself befor
eric prai him to forgo hi mad ventur but he would not listen
to her for he wa slow to make up hi mind but that be made up
noth could chang it then when she learn that it wa to get sight
of gudruda that he purpos thu to throw hi life awai she wa veri
angri and curs her and all her kith and kin
it is like enough that thou wilt have caus to us such word befor
all thi tale is told said eric nevertheless mother forbear to
curs gudruda who is in no wai to blame for these matter
thou art a faithless son saevuna said who wilt slai thyself
strive to win speech with thy mai and leav thy mother childless
eric said that it seem so inde but he wa plight to it and the
feat must be tri then he kiss her and she sought her bed weep
now it wa the dai of the yulefeast and there wa no sun till on hour
befor noon but eric have kiss hi mother and bidden her farewel
call a thrall jon by name and give him a sealskin bag full of hi
best apparel bade him ride to middalhof and tell asmund the priest that
eric brightey would come down golden fall an hour after middai to
join hi feast and thenc go to the foot of the golden fall to await
him there and the man went wonder for he thought hi master mad
then eric took a good rope and a staff tip with iron and so soon
as the light serv mount hi hors ford ran river and rode along
coldback till he came to the lip of golden fall here he stai a while
till at length he saw mani peopl stream up the snow from middalhof
far beneath and among them two women who by their statur should be
gudruda and swanhild and near to them a great man whom he did not
know then he show himself for a space on the brink of the gulf and
turn hi hors up stream the sun shone bright upon the edg of
the sky but the frost bit like a sword still he must strip off hi
garment so that noth remain on him except hi sheepskin shoe
shirt and hose and take the water now here the river run mightili
and he must cross full thirti fathom of the swirl water befor he
can reach sheepsaddl and woe to him if hi foot slip on the boulder
for certainli he must be swept over the brink
eric rest the staff against the stoni bottom and lean hi weight
on it took the stream and he wa so strong that it could not prevail
against him till at length he wa rather more than halfwai across and
the water swept abov hi shoulder now he wa lift from hi feet
and let the staff float he swam for hi life and with such mighti
stroke that he felt littl of that ici cold down he wa sweptnow the
lip of the fall wa but three fathom awai on hi left and alreadi
the green water boil beneath him a fathom from him wa the corner of
sheepsaddl if he mai grasp it all is well if not he di
three great stroke and he held it hi feet were swept out over the
brink of the fall but he clung on grimli and by the strength of hi
arm drew himself on to the rock and rest a while present he stood
up for the cold began to nip him and the peopl below becam awar
that he had swum the river abov the fall and rais a shout for the
deed wa great now eric must begin to clamber down sheepsaddl and
thi wa no easi task for the rock is almost sheer and slipperi with
ic and on either side the water rush and thunder throw their
blind sprai about him as thei leapt to the depth beneath he look
down studi the rock then feel that he grew afraid made an end
of doubt and grasp a point with both hand swung himself down hi
own length and more now for mani minut he climb down sheepsaddl
and the task wa hard for he wa bewild with the boom of the
water that bent out on either side of him like the arc of a bow and
the rock wa veri steep and slipperi still he came down all those
fifteen fathom and fell not though twice he wa near to fall and
the watcher below marvel greatli at hi hardihood
he will be dash to piec where the water meet said ospakar he
can never gain wolf fang crag beneath and if so it be that he come
there and leap to the pool the weight of water will drive him down and
drown him
it is certainli so quoth asmund and it griev me much for it wa
my jest that drove him to thi peril adventur and we cannot spare
such a man as eric brightey
now swanhild turn white as death but gudruda said if great heart
and strength and skill mai avail at all then eric shall come safe
down the water
thou fool whisper swanhild in her ear how can these help him no
troll could live in yonder cauldron dead is eric and thou art the bait
that lure him to hi death
spare thy word she answer as the norn have order so it shall
be
now eric stood at the foot of sheepsaddl and within an arm length
the mighti water met toss their yellow wave and seeth furious
as thei leapt to the misthid gulf beneath he bent over and look
through the sprai three fathom under him the rock wolf fang split
the water and thenc if he can come thither he mai leap sheer into
the pool below now he unwound the rope that wa about hi middl and
made on end fast to a knob of rockand thi wa difficult for hi
hand were stiff with coldand the other end he pass through hi
leathern girdl then eric look again and hi heart sank within him
how might he give himself to thi boil flood and not be shatter
but as he look lo a rainbow grew upon the face of the water and on
end of it lit upon him and the other like a glori from the god fell
full upon gudruda as she stood a littl wai apart watch at the foot
of golden fall
seest thou that said asmund to groa who wa at hi side the god
build their bifrost bridg between these two who now shall keep them
asund
read the portent thu she answer thei shall be unit but not
here yon is a spirit bridg and see the water of death foam and
fall between them
eric too saw the omen and it seem good to him and all fear left hi
heart round about him the water thunder but amidst their roar he
dream that he heard a voic call
be of good cheer eric brightey for thou shalt live to do mightier
deed than thi and in guerdon thou shalt win gudruda
so he paus no longer but shorten up the rope pull on it with
all hi strength and then leapt out upon the arch of water thei
struck him and he wa dash out like a stone from a sling again he
fell against them and again wa dash awai so that hi girdl burst
eric felt it go and clung wildli to the rope and lo with the inward
swing he fell on wolf fang where never a man ha stood befor and
never a man shall stand again eric lai a littl while on the rock till
hi breath came back to him and he listen to the roar of the water
then rise on hi hand and knee he crept to it point for he could
scarc stand becaus of the trembl of the stone beneath the shock
of the fall and when the peopl below saw that he wa not dead thei
rais a great shout and the sound of their voic came to him through
the nois of the water
now twelv fathom beneath him wa the surfac of the pool but he
could not see it becaus of the wreath of sprai nevertheless he must
leap and that swiftli for he grew cold so of a sudden eric stood up to
hi full height and with a loud cry and a mighti spring bound out
from the point of wolf fang far into the air beyond the reach of the
fall flood and rush headlong toward the gulf beneath now all men
watch held their breath as hi bodi travel and so great is the
place and so high the leap that through the mist eric seem but as a
big white stone hurl down the face of the arch water
he wa gone and the watcher rush down to the foot of the pool for
there if he rose at all he must pass to the shallow swanhild could
look no more but sank upon the ground the face of gudruda wa set like
a stone with doubt and anguish ospakar saw and read the mean and he
said to himself now odin grant that thi youngl rise not again for
the maid love him dearli and he is too much a man to be lightli swept
asid
eric struck the pool down he sank and down and downfor the water
fall from so far must almost reach the bottom of the pool befor
it can rise againand he with it now he touch the bottom but veri
gentli and slowli began to rise and as he rose wa carri along by
the stream but it wa long befor he could breath and it seem to
him that hi lung would burst still he struggl up strike great
stroke with hi leg
farewel to eric said asmund he will rise no more now
but just as he spoke gudruda point to someth that gleam white
and golden beneath the surfac of the current and lo the bright hair
of eric rose from the water and he drew a great breath shake hi
head like a seal and though but feebli struck out for the shallow
that ar at the foot of the pool now he found foot but wa swept
over by the fierc current and cut hi forehead and he carri that
scar till hi death again he rose and with a rush gain the bank
unaid and fell upon the snow
now peopl gather about him in silenc and wonder for none had
known so great a deed and present eric open hi ey and look up
and found the ey of gudruda fix on hi and there wa that in them
which made him glad he had dare the path of golden fall
v
how eric won the sword whitefir
now asmund the priest bent down and eric saw him and spoke
thou badest me to thy yulefeast lord by yonder slipperi road and i
have come dost thou welcom me well
no man better quoth asmund thou art a gallant man though
foolhardi and thou hast done a deed that shall be told of while skald

make place my father said gudruda for eric bleed and she loos
the kerchief from her neck and bound it about hi wound brow and
take the rich cloak from her bodi threw it on hi shoulder and no
man said her nai
then thei led him to the hall where eric cloth himself and rest
and he sent back the thrall jon to coldback bid him tell saevuna
eric mother that he wa safe but he wa somewhat weak all that dai
and the sound of water roar in hi ear
now ospakar and groa were ill pleas at the turn thing had taken but
all the other rejoic much for eric wa well love of men and thei
had griev if the water had prevail against hi might but swanhild
brood bitterli for eric never turn to look on her
the hour of the feast drew on and accord to custom it wa held in
the templ and thither went all men when thei were seat in the nave
of the hof the fat ox that had been made readi for sacrific wa led in

and the line strong that should win thi fair fish to hi angl and as

ralph the red took it from king eric cairn in norwai and he strove

and becam veri angri
look not so maiden he said for it shall be anoth eric than yon
flapperduck who hold whitefir aloft though it mai veri well chanc
that he shall feel it edg
now gudruda bit her lip and eric burn red to the brow and spoke

much as lift from my feet good i will lai thee on thy face and
whip thee and whitefir shall be the stakei swear it on the holi

eric

great sword against thy right ey and if i win the match it shall
be mine to tear it out wilt thou plai thi game with me if thy heart

ospakarat which some few of hi thrall laugh

a worst jest
now the feast went on and asmund rose from hi high seat in the centr
of the nave on the left hand look down from the altar and gave
out the holi toast first men drank a full horn to odin prai for
triumph on their foe then thei drank to frei ask for plenti to

accord to custom and ask if none had an oath to swear as to some
deed that should be done
for a while there wa no answer but present eric brightey stood up
lord he said i would swear an oath
set forth the matter then said asmund
it is thi quoth eric on mosfel mountain over by hecla dwell a
baresark of whom all men have ill knowledg for there ar few whom he
ha not harm hi name is skallagrim he is a mighti man and he ha
wrought much mischief in the south countri and brought mani to their
death and rob more of their good for none can prevail against him
still i swear thi that when the dai lengthen i will go up alon
against him and challeng him to battl and conquer him or fall
then thou yellowhead puppydog thou shalt go with on ey against
a baresark with two growl ospakar
men took no heed of hi word but shout aloud for skallagrim had
plagu them long and there were none who dare to fight with him ani
more onli gudruda look askanc for it seem to her that eric swore
too fast nevertheless he went up to the altar and take hold of the
holi ring he set hi foot on the holi stone and swore hi oath while
the feaster applaud strike their cup upon the board
and after that the feast went merrili till all men were drunk except
asmund and eric
now eric went to rest but first he rub hi limb with the fat of
seal for he wa still sore with the beat of the water and thei
must need be suppl on the morrow if he would keep hi ey then he
slept sound and rose strong and well and go to the stream behind
the stead bath and anoint hi limb afresh but ospakar did not
sleep well becaus of the al that he had drunk now as eric came back
from bath in the dark of the morn he met gudruda who watch
for hi come and there be none to see he kiss her often but
she chide him becaus of the match that he had made with ospakar and
the oath that he had sworn
sure she said thou wilt lose thine ey for thi ospakar is a
giant and strong as a troll also he is merciless still thou art a
mighti man and i shall love thee as well with on ey as with two oh
eric methought i should have di yesterdai when thou didst leap from
wolf fang my heart seem to stop within me
yet i came safe to shore sweetheart and well doe thi kiss pai for
all i did and as for ospakar if but onc i get these arm about him i
fear him littl or ani man and i covet that sword of hi greatli but
we can talk more certainli of these thing tomorrow
now gudruda clung to him and told him all that had befallen and of the
do and word of swanhild
she honour me beyond my worth he said who am in no wai set on her
but on thee onli gudruda
art thou so sure of that eric swanhild is fair and wise
ay and evil when i love swanhild then thou mayest love ospakar
it is a bargain she said laugh good luck go with thee in the
wrestl and with a kiss she left him fear lest she should be
seen
eric went back to the hall and sat down by the centr hearth for all
men slept be still heavi with drink and present swanhild glide
up to him and greet him
thou art greedi of deed eric she said yesterdai thou camest here
by a path that no man ha travel todai thou dost wrestl with a
giant for thine ey and present thou goest up against skallagrim
it seem that thi is true said eric
now all thi thou doest for a woman who is the betroth of anoth
man
all thi i do for fame sake swanhild moreov gudruda is betroth
to none
befor anoth yulefeast is spread gudruda shall be the wife of
ospakar
that is yet to be seen swanhild
now swanhild stood silent for a while and then spoke thou art a fool
ericy drunk with folli noth but evil shall come to thee from
thi mad of thine forget it and pluck that which li to thine
hand and she look sweetli at him
thei call thee swanhild the fatherless he answer but i think that
loki the god of guil wa thy father for there is none to match thee
in craft and evildo and in beauti on onli i know thy plot well
and all the sorrow that thou hast brought upon us still each seek
honour after hi own manner so seek thou as thou wilt but thou shalt
find bitter and empti dai and thy plot shall come back on thine
own heady even though thei bring gudruda and me to sorrow and
death
swanhild laugh a dai shall dawn eric when thou who dost hate me
shalt hold me dear and thi i promis thee anoth thing i promis
thee also that gudruda shall never call thee husband
but eric did not answer fear lest in hi anger he should sai word
that were better unspoken
now men rose and sat down to meat and all talk of the wrestl that
should be but in the morn ospakar repent of the match for it is
truli said that al is anoth man and men do not like that in the
morn which seem well enough on yester ev he rememb that he
held whitefir dear abov all thing and that eric ey had no worth
to him except that the loss of it would spoil hi beauti so that
perhap gudruda would turn from him it would be veri ill if he should
chanc to lose the playthough of thi he had no fear for he wa
held the strongest man in iceland and the most skill in all feat of
strengthand at the best no fame is to be won from the overthrow of a
deedless man and the pluck out of hi ey thu it came to pass that
when he saw eric he call to him in a big voic
hearken thou eric
i hear thee thou ospakar said eric mock him and peopl laugh
while ospakar grin angrili and said thou must learn manner puppi
still i shall find no honour in teach thee in thi wise last night
we made a match in our cup and i stake my sword whitefir and thou
thine ey it would be bad that either of us should lose sword or ey
therefor what sayest thou shall we let it pass
ay blacktooth if thou fearest but first pai thou forfeit of the
sword
now ospakar grew veri mad and shout thou wilt inde stand against
me in the ring i will break thy back anon youngster and afterward
tear out thine ey befor thou diest
it mai so befal answer eric but big word do not make big
deed
present the light came and thrall went out with spade and clear
awai the snow in a circl two rod across and brought dry sand and
sprinkl it on the frozen turf so that the wrestler should not slip
and thei pile the snow in a wall around the ring
but groa came up to ospakar and spoke to him apart
knowest thou lord she said that my heart bode ill of thi match
eric is a mighti man and great though thou art i think that thou
shalt lout low befor him
it will be a bad busi if i am overthrown by an untri man said
ospakar and wa troubl in hi mind and it would be evil moreov to
lose the sword for no price would i have it so
what wilt thou give me lord if i bring thee victori
i will give thee two hundr in silver
ask no question and it shall be so said groa
now eric wa without take note of the ground in the ring and
present groa call to her the thrall koll the halfwit whom she
had sent to swinefel
see she said yonder by the wall stand the wrestl shoe of eric
brightey hast thee now and take greas and rub the sole with it
then hold them in the heat of the fire so that the fat sink in do
thi swiftli and secretli and i will give thee three penni
koll grin and did as he wa bid set back the shoe just as
thei were befor scarc wa the deed done when eric came in and made
himself readi for the game bind the greas shoe upon hi feet for
he fear no trick
now everybodi went out to the ring and ospakar and eric strip
for wrestl thei were clad in tight woollen jerkin and hose and
sheepskin shoe were on their feet
thei name asmund master of the game and hi word must be law to both
of them eric claim that asmund should hold the sword whitefir that
wa at stake but ospakar gainsaid him sai that if he gave whitefir
into asmund keep eric must also give hi eyeand about thi thei
debat hotli now the matter wa brought befor asmund as umpir and
he gave judgment for eric for he said if eric yield up hi ey
into my hand i can return it to hi head no more if he should win but
if ospakar give me the good sword and conquer it is easi for me to
pass it back to him unharm
men said that thi wa a good judgment
thu then wa the armgam set ospakar and eric must wrestl thrice
and between each bout there would be a space while men could count a
thousand thei might strike no blow at on anoth with hand or head
or elbow foot or knee and it should be count no fall if the haunch
and the head of the fallen were not on the ground at the selfsam time
he who suffer two fall should be adjudg conquer and lose hi
stake
asmund call these rule aloud in the presenc of wit and
ospakar and eric said that should bind them ospakar drew a small knife
and gave it to hi son gizur to hold
thou shalt soon know youngl how steel tast in the eyebal he
said
we shall soon know mani thing eric answer
now thei drew off their cloak and stood in the ring ospakar wa great
beyond the big of men and hi arm were cloth with black hair
like the limb of a goat beneath the shoulder joint thei were almost
as thick as a girl thigh hi leg also were mighti and the muscl
stood out upon him in knotti lump he seem a veri giant and fierc
as a baresark but still somewhat round about the bodi and heavi in
movement
from him men look at eric
lo baldur and the troll said swanhild and everybodi laugh sinc
so it wa inde for if ospakar wa black and hideou as a troll eric
wa beauti as baldur the loveliest of the god he wa taller than
ospakar by the half of a hand and as broad in the chest still he wa
not yet come to hi greatest strength and though hi limb were well
knit thei seem but as a child against the limb of ospakar but he
wa quick as a cat and lith hi neck and arm were white as whei and
beneath hi golden hair hi bright ey shone like spear
now thei stood face to face with arm outstretch wait the word of
asmund he gave it and thei circl round each other with arm held low
present ospakar made a rush and seiz eric about the middl tri
to lift him but with no avail thrice he strove and fail then eric
move hi foot and lo it slip upon the sand turf again eric move
and again he slip a third time and he slip a third time and
befor he could recov himself he wa full on hi back and fairli
thrown
gudruda saw and wa sad at heart and those around her said that it wa
easi to know how the game would end
what said i quoth swanhild that it would go badli with eric were
ospakar arm about him
all is not done yet answer gudruda methink eric feet slip
most strang as though he stood on ic
but eric wa veri sore at heart and could make noth of thi
matterfor he wa not overthrown by strength
he sat on the snow and ospakar and hi son mock him but gudruda drew
near and whisper to him to be of good cheer for fortun might yet
chang
i think that i am bewitch said eric sadli my feet have no hold of
the ground
gudruda cover her ey with her hand and thought present she look
up quickli i seem to see guil here she said now look narrowli on
thy shoe
he heard and loosen hi shoestr drew a shoe from hi foot and
look at the sole the cold of the snow had harden the fat and there
it wa all white upon the leather
now eric rose in wrath methought he cri that i dealt with men
of honour mind not with cheat trickster see now it is littl
wonder that i slip for greas ha been set upon my shoesand by
thor i will cleav the man who did it to the chin and as he said it
hi ey blaze so dreadfulli that folk fell back from him asmund took
the shoe and look at them then he spoke
brightey tell the truth and we have a sorri knave among us
ospakar canst thou clear thyself of thi ill deed
i will swear on the holi ring that i know noth of it and if ani man
in my compani ha had a hand therein he shall die said ospakar
that we will swear also cri hi son gizur and mord
thi is more like a woman work said gudruda and she look at
swanhild
it is no work of mine quoth swanhild
then go and ask thy mother of it answer gudruda
now all men cri aloud that thi wa the greatest shame and that the
match must be set afresh onli ospakar bethought him of that two hundr
in silver which he had promis to groa and look around but she wa
not there still he gainsaid eric in the matter of the match be set
afresh
then eric cri out in hi anger that he would let the game stand as it
wa sinc ospakar swore himself free of the shame deed men thought
thi a mad sai but asmund said it should be so still he swore
in hi heart that even if he were worst eric should not lose hi
eyeno not if sword were held aloft to take it for of all trick thi
seem to him the veri worst
now ospakar and eric face each other again in the ring but thi time
the feet of eric were bare
ospakar rush to get the upper hold but eric wa too swift for him and
sprang asid again he rush but eric drop and grip him round
the middl now thei were face to face hug each other like bear
but move littl for a time thing went thu while ospakar strove to
lift eric but in nowis could he stir him then of a sudden eric put
out hi strength and thei stagger round the ring tear at each
other till their jerkin were rent from them leav them almost bare
to the waist suddenli eric seem to give and ospakar put out hi
foot to trip him but brightey wa watch he caught the foot in
the crook of hi left leg and threw hi weight forward on the chest of
blacktooth backward he went fall with the thud of a tree on snow
and there he lai on the ground and eric over him
then men shout a fall a fair fall and were veri glad for the
fight seem most uneven to them and the wrestler roll asund
breath heavili
gudruda threw a cloak over eric nake shoulder
that wa well done brightey she said
the game is still to plai sweet he gasp and ospakar is a mighti
man i threw him by skill not by strength next time it must be by
strength or not at all
now breathingtim wa done and onc more the two were face to face
thrice ospakar rush and thrice did eric slip awai for he would wast
blacktooth strength again ospakar rush roar like a bear and
fire seem to come from hi ey and the steam went up from him and
hung upon the frosti air like the steam of a hors thi time eric could
not get awai but wa swept up into that great grip for ospakar had the
lower hold
now there is an end of eric said swanhild
the arrow is yet on the bow answer gudruda
blacktooth put out hi might and reel round and round the ring
drag eric with him thi wai and that he twist and time on time
eric leg wa lift from the ground but so he might not be thrown
now thei stood almost still while men shout madli for no such
wrestl had been known in the southland grimli thei hug and
strove forsooth it wa a mighti sight to see grimli thei hug and
their muscl strain and crack but thei could stir each other no
inch
ospakar grew fear for he could make no plai with thi youngl
black rage swell in hi heart he ground hi fang and thought on
guil by hi foot gleam the nake foot of eric suddenli he stamp
on it so fierc that the skin burst
ill done ill done folk cri but in hi pain eric move hi foot
lo he wa down but not altogeth down for he did but sit upon hi
haunch and still he clung to blacktooth thigh and twine hi leg
about hi ankl now with all hi strength ospakar strove to forc the
head of brightey to the ground but still he could not for eric clung
to him like a creeper to a tree
a lose game for eric said asmund and as he spoke brightey wa
press back till hi yellow hair almost swept the sand
then the folk of ospakar shout in triumph but gudruda cri aloud
be not overthrown eric loos thee and spring asid
eric heard and of a sudden loos all hi grip he fell on hi
outspread hand then with a swing sidewai and a bound onc more
he stood upon hi feet ospakar came at him like a bull made mad with
goad but he could no longer roar aloud thei close and thi time
eric had the better hold for a while thei struggl round and round
till their feet tore the frozen turf then onc more thei stood face
to face now the two were almost spent yet blacktooth gather up hi
strength and swung eric from hi feet but he found them again he grew
mad with rage and hug him till brightey wa nearli press to
death and black bruis sprang upon the white of hi flesh ospakar
grew mad and madder yet till at length in hi furi he fix hi fang
in eric shoulder and bit till the blood spurt
ill kiss thou rat gasp eric and with the pain and rush of
blood hi strength came back to him he shift hi grip swiftli now
hi right hand wa beneath the fork of blacktooth thigh and hi left

ospakar rose from the grounda third mighti liftso mighti that the
wrap on eric forehead burst and the blood stream down hi
faceand lo great blacktooth flew in air up he flew and backward he
fell into the bank of snow and wa buri there almost to the knee
vi
how asmund the priest wa betroth to unna
for a moment there wa silenc for all that compani wa wonderstruck at
the great of the deed then thei cheer and cheer again and to
eric it seem that he slept and the sound of shout reach him but
faintli as though he heard through snow suddenli he woke and saw a
man rush at him with ax aloft it wa mord ospakar son mad at hi
father overthrow eric sprang asid or the blow had been hi bane
and as he sprang smote with hi fist and it struck heavili on the
head of mord abov the ear so that the ax flew from hi hand and he
fell senseless on hi father in the snow
now sword flash out and men ring round eric to guard him and it
came near to the spill of blood for the peopl of ospakar gnash
their teeth to see so great a hero overthrown by a youngl while the
southern folk of middalhof and ran river rejoic loudli for eric wa
dear to their heart
down sword cri asmund the priest and haul yon carcass from the
snow
thi then thei did and ospakar sat up breath in great gasp the
blood run from hi mouth and ear and he wa an evil sight to see
for what with blood and snow and rage hi face wa like the face of the
swinefel goblin
but swanhild spoke in the ear of gudruda
here she said look at eric we two have a man worth love
fostersist
ay answer gudruda worth and well worth
now asmund drew near and befor all men kiss eric brightey on the
brow
in sooth he said thou art a mighti man eric and the glori of the
south thi i prophesi of thee that thou shalt do deed such as have
not been done in iceland thou hast ill been serv for a knave unknown

iceland could not overthrow thee though like a wolf he fasten hi
fang in thee and like a coward stamp upon thy nake foot take

now eric took snow and wipe the blood from hi brow then he grasp
whitefir and drew it from the scabbard and high aloft flash the
warblad thrice he wheel it round hi head then sang aloud
fast yestermorn down golden fall

eric took hi hand and gudruda heard her father word and happi
shone in her dark ey and she grew faint for veri joi and now eric
turn to her all torn and bloodi from the frai the great sword in hi
hand and he spoke thu
thou hast heard thy father word gudruda now it seem that there is
no great need of trothplight between us two still here befor

love thee and thee onli gudruda the fair asmund daughter whom i
have desir all my dai and if i fail of thi my oath then our troth
is at an end and thou mayst wed whom thou wilt and in turn he put hi
lip upon the sword while swanhild watch them do the oath
now ospakar wa recov from the fight and he sat there upon the
snow with bow head for he knew well that he had won the greatest
shame and had lost both wife and sword black rage fill hi heart as
he listen and he sprang to hi feet
i came hither asmund he said to ask thi maid of thine in

mean with my own ey i saw thee stamp on the nake foot of eric

i cannot do that for thou hast my sword and till i am suit with
anoth weapon i mai fight no holmgang still fear not we shall soon
meet with weapon aloft and byrni on breast
never too soon can the hour come blacktooth said eric and turn
on hi heel he limp to the hall to cloth himself afresh on the
threshold of the men door he met groa the witch
thou didst put greas upon my shoe carlin and witchhag that thou

it is not true brightey
there thou liest and for all thi i will repai thee thou art not yet

groa look at him strang if thou speakest so take heed to thy
meat and drink she said i wa not born among the finn for noth
and know i am still mind to wed asmund for thy shoe i would to the
god that thei were hellshoon and that i wa now bind them on thy

oh the cat begin to spit said eric but know thi thou mayest
greas my shoesfit work for a carlinebut thou mayest never bind
them on thou art a witch and wilt come to the end of witch and
what thy daughter is that i will not sai and he push past her and
enter the hall
present asmund came to seek eric there and prai him to be gone to
hi stead on ran river the hors of ospakar had strai and he must
stop at middalhof till thei were found but if these two should abid
under the same roof bloodsh would come of it and that asmund knew
eric said yea to thi and when he had rest a while he kiss
gudruda and take a hors rode awai to coldback bear the sword
whitefir with him and for a time he saw no more of ospakar
when he came there hi mother saevuna greet him as on risen from
the dead and hung about hi neck then he told her all that had come
to pass and she thought it a marvel stori and sorrow that
thorgrimur her husband wa not aliv to know it but eric muse a
while and spoke
mother he said now my uncl thorod of greenfel is dead and hi
daughter my cousin unna ha no home she is a fair woman and skill
in all thing it come into my mind that we should bid her here to
dwell with us
why i thought thou wast betroth to gudruda the fair said saevuna
wherefor then wouldst thou bring unna hither
for thi caus said eric becaus it seem that asmund the priest
weari of groa the witch and would take anoth wife and i wish to
draw the band between us tighter if it mai befal so
groa will take it ill said saevuna
thing cannot be wors between us than thei ar now therefor i do not
fear groa he answer
it shall be as thou wilt son tomorrow we will send to unna and bid
her here if it pleas her to come
now ospakar stai three more dai at middalhof till hi hors were
found and he wa fit to travel for eric had shaken him sore but he
had no word with gudruda and few with asmund still he saw swanhild
and she bid him to be of good cheer for he should yet have gudruda
for now that the maid had pass from him the mind of ospakar wa set
in win her bjrn also asmund son spoke word of good comfort
to him for he envi eric hi great fame and he thought the match
with blacktooth would be good and so at length ospakar rode awai to
swinefel with all hi compani but gizur hi son left hi heart
behind
for swanhild had not been idl thi while her heart wa sore but she
must follow her illnatur and so she had put out her woman strength
and beguil gizur into love her but she did not love him at all and
the temper of asmund the priest wa so angri that gizur dare not ask
her in marriag so noth wa said of the matter
now unna came to coldback to dwell with saevuna eric mother and she
wa a fair and buxom woman she had been onc wed but within a month
of her marriag her husband wa lost at sea thi two year gone at
first gudruda wa somewhat jealou of thi come of unna to coldback
but eric show her what wa in hi mind and she fell into the plan
for she hate and fear groa greatli and desir to be rid of her
sinc thi matter of the greas of eric wrestlingsho great
loath of groa had come into asmund mind and he bethought him often
of those word that hi wife gudruda the gentl spoke as she lai dy
and griev that the oath which he swore then had in part been broken
he would have no more to do with groa now but he could not be rid of
her and notwithstand her evil do he still love swanhild but
groa grew thin with spite and rage and wander about the place glare
with her great black ey and peopl hate her more and more
now asmund went to visit at coldback and there he saw unna and wa
pleas with her for she wa a blith woman and a bonni the end of it
wa that he ask her in marriag of eric at which brightey wa glad
but said that he must know unna mind unna hearken and did not
sai no for though asmund wa somewhat gone in year still he wa an
upstand man wealthi in land good and monei out at interest and
have mani friend so thei plight troth and the weddingfeast wa
to be in the autumn after hayharvest now asmund rode back to middalhof
somewhat troubl at heart for these tide must be told to groa and
he fear her and her witchcraft in the hall he found her stand
alon
where hast thou been lord she ask
at coldback he answer
to see unna eric cousin perchanc
that is so
what is unna to thee then lord
thi much that after hayharvest she will be my wife and that is ill
new for thee groa
now groa turn and grasp fierc at the air with her thin hand her
ey start out foam wa on her lip and she shook in her furi like
a birchtre in the wind look so evil that asmund drew back a littl
wai sai
now a veil is lift from thee and i see thee as thou art thou hast
cast a glamour over me these mani year groa and it is gone
mayhap asmund asmundsonmayhap thou knowest me but i tell thee that
thou shalt see me in a wors guis befor thou weddest unna what have
i born the greatest shame ly by thy side these mani year and
shall i live to see a rival young and fair creep into my place with
honour that i will not while rune have power and spell can conjur
the evil thing upon thee i call down ruin on thee and thineyea and
on brightey also for he ha brought thi thing to pass death take ye
all mai thy blood no longer run in mortal vein anywher on the earth
go down to hela asmund and be forgotten and she began to mutter
rune swiftli
now asmund turn white with wrath ceas thy evil talk he said or
thou shalt be hurl as a witch into goldfoss pool
into goldfoss poolyea there i mai lie i see iti seem to see
thi shape of mine roll where the water boil fiercestbut thine
ey shall never see it thy ey ar shut and shut ar the ey of
unna for ye have gone beforei do but follow after and thrice groa
shriek aloud throw up her arm then fell foam on the sand
floor
an evil woman and a fei said asmund as he call peopl to her it
had been better for me if i had never seen her dark face
now it is to be told that groa lai besid herself for ten full dai and
swanhild nurs her then she found her sens again and crave to see
asmund and spoke thu to him
it seem to me lord if inde it be aught but a vision of my dream
that befor thi sick struck me i spoke mad and angri word against
thee becaus thou hast plight troth to unna thorod daughter
that is so in truth said asmund
i have to sai thi then lord that most humbl i crave thy pardon for
my ill word and ask thee to put them awai from thy mind sore heart
make sour speech and thou knowest well that howsoev great my
fault at least i have alwai love thee and labour for thee and
methink that in some fashion thy fortun ar the debtor to my wisdom
therefor when my ear heard that thou hadst of a truth put me awai
and that anoth woman come an honour wife to rule in middalhof my
tongu forgot it courtesi and i spoke word that ar of all word the
farthest from my mind for i know well that i grow old and have put off
that beauti with which i wa adorn of yore and that held thee to me
carlin eric brightey name me and carlin i aman old hag no

if thou drivest me henc i tell thee that i will lie down and die upon
thy threshold and when thou sinkest into eld sure the memori of it

thu she spoke and wept much till asmund heart soften in him and
though with a doubt mind he said it should be as she will
so groa stai on at middalhof and wa lowli in her bear and soft of
speech
vii
how eric went up mosfel against skallagrim the baresark
now atli the good earl of the orknei come into the stori
it chanc that atli had sail to iceland in the autumn on a busi
about certain land that had fallen to him in right of hi mother helga
who wa an iceland and he had winter west of reyjan spring be
come he wish to sail home and when hi ship wa bound he put to
sea full earli in the year but it chanc that bad weather came up from
the southeast with mist and rain so he must need beach hi ship in a
creek under shelter of the westman island
now atli ask what peopl dwelt in these part and when he heard the
name of asmund asmundson the priest he wa glad for in old dai he and
asmund had gone mani a vike cruis togeth
we will leav the ship here he said till the weather clear and go
up to middalhof to stai with asmund
so thei made the ship snug and left men to watch her but two of the
compani with earl atli rode up to middalhof
it must be told of atli that he wa the best of the earl who live in
those dai and he rule the orknei so well that men gave him a bynam
and call him atli the good it wa said of him that he had never
turn a poor man awai unsuccour nor bow hi head befor a strong
man nor drawn hi sword without caus nor refus peac to him who
prai it he wa sixti year old but ag had left few mark on
him except that of hi long white beard he wa keenei and
wellfashion of form and face a great warrior and the strongest of
men hi wife wa dead leav him no children and thi wa a sorrow
to him but as yet he had taken no other wife for he would sai love
make an old man blind and when ag run with youth both shall
fall and again mix grei lock and golden and spoil two head for
thi earl wa a man of mani wise sai
now atli came to middalhof just as men sat down to meat and hear the
clatter of arm all sprang to their feet think that perhap ospakar
had come again as he had promis but when asmund saw atli he knew him
at onc though thei had not met for nearli thirti year and he greet
him lovingli and put him in the high seat and gave place to hi men
upon the crossbench atli told all hi stori and asmund bade him
rest a while at middalhof till the weather grew clearer
now the earl saw swanhild and thought the maid wondrou fair and so
inde she wa as she move scornfulli to and fro in her kirtl of
white soft wa her curl hair and deep were her dark blue ey and
bent were her red lip as is a bow abov her dimpl chin and her teeth
shone like pearl
is that fair maid thy daughter asmund ask atli
she is name swanhild the fatherless he answer turn hi face
awai
well said atli look sharpli on him were the maid sprung from
me she would not long be call the fatherless for few have such a
daughter
she is fair enough said asmund in all save temper and that is bad
to cross
in everi sword a flaw answer atli but what ha an old man to do
with young maid and their beauti and he sigh
i have known younger men who would seem less brisk at bridal said
asmund and for that time thei talk no more of the matter
now swanhild heard someth of thi speech and she guess more and
it came into her mind that it would be the best of sport to make thi
old man love her and then to mock him and sai him nai so she set
herself to the task as it ever wa her wont and she found it easi for
all dai long with downcast ey and gentl look she wait upon the
earl and now at hi bid she sang to him in a voic soft and low
and now she talk so wise well that atli thought no such maid had
trod the earth befor but he check himself with mani learn saw
and on a dai when the weather had grown fair and thei sat alon he
told her that hi ship wa bound for orknei isl
then as though by chanc swanhild laid her white hand in hi and on a
sudden look deep into hi ey and said with trembl lip ah go
not yet lordi prai thee go not yetand turn she fled awai
but atli wa much move and he said to himself now a strang thing
is come to pass a fair maid love an old man and yet methink he
who look into those ey see deep water and he beat hi brow and
thought
but swanhild in her chamber laugh till the tear ran from those same
ey for she saw that the great fish wa hook and now the time had
come to plai him
for she did not know that it wa otherwis fate
gudruda too saw all these thing and knew not how to read them for
she wa of an honest mind and could not understand how a woman mai love
a man as swanhild love eric and yet make such plai with other men
and that of her free will for she guess littl of swanhild
guil nor of the cold of her heart to all save eric nor of
how thi wa the onli joi left to her to make a sport of men and put
them to grief and shame atli said to himself that he would watch thi
maid well befor he utter a word to asmund and he deem himself veri
cun for he wa wondrou cautiou after the fashion of those about
to fall so he set himself to watch and swanhild set herself to
smile and he told her tale of warfar and of dare and she clasp
her hand and said
wa there ever such a man sinc odin trod the earth and so it went
on till the servingwomen laugh at the old man in love and the wit of
her that mock him
now upon a dai eric have made an end of sow hi corn bethought
himself of hi vow to go up alon against skallagrim the baresark in hi
den on mosfel over by hecla now thi wa a heavi task for skallagrim
wa held so mighti among men that none went up against him ani more and
at time eric thought of gudruda and sigh for it wa like that
she would be a widow befor she wa made a wife still hi oath must
be fulfil and moreov of late skallagrim have heard that a
youngl name eric brightey had vow to slai him singlehand
had made of a mock of him in thi fashion for skallagrim rode down
to coldback on ran river and at nighttim took a lamb from the fold
hold the lamb beneath hi arm he drew near to the hous and smote
thrice on the door with hi battleax and thei were thunder knock
then he leapt on to hi hors and rode off a space and wait present
eric came out but half clad a shield in on hand and whitefir in the
other and look by the bright moonlight he saw a huge blackbeard
man seat on a hors have a great ax in on hand and the lamb
beneath hi arm
who art thou roar eric
i am call skallagrim youngl answer the man on the hors
mani men have seen me onc none have wish to see me twice and some
few have never seen aught again now it ha been echo in my ear that
thou hast vow a vow to go up mosfel against skallagrim the baresark
and i am come hither to sai that i will make thee right welcom see
and with hi ax he cut off the lamb tail on the pommel of hi saddl
of the flesh of thi lamb of thine i will brew broth and of hi skin i
will make me a vest take thou thi tail and when thou fittest it on
to the skin again skallagrim will own a lord and he hurl the tail
toward him
bide thou there till i can come to thee shout eric it will spare
me a ride to mosfel
nai nai it is good for lad to take the mountain air and skallagrim
turn hi hors awai laugh
eric watch skallagrim vanish over the knoll and then though he wa
veri angri laugh also and went in but first he pick up the tail
and on the morrow he skin it
now the time wa come when the matter must be tri and eric bade
farewel to saevuna hi mother and unna hi cousin and girt whitefir
round him and set upon hi head a golden helm with wing on it then he
found the byrni which hi father thorgrimur had strip togeth with
the helm from that baresark who cut off hi legand thi wa a good
piec forg of the welshmenand he put it on hi breast and take
a stout shield of bull hide stud with nail rode awai with on
thrall the strong carl name jon
but the women misdoubt them much of thi ventur nevertheless eric
might not be gainsai
now the road to mosfel run past middalhof and thither he came atli
stand at the men door saw him and cri aloud ho a mighti man
come here
swanhild look out and saw eric and he wa a goodli sight in hi
wargear for now week by week he seem to grow more fair and great
as the full strength of hi manhood rose in him like sap in the spring
grass and gudruda wa veri proud of her lover that night eric stai
at middalhof and sat hand in hand with gudruda and talk with earl
atli now the heart of the old vike went out to eric and he took
great delight in him and in hi strength and deed and he long much
that the god had given him such a son
i prophesi thi of thee brightey he cri that it shall go ill
with thi baresark thou seekesty and with all men who come within
sweep of that great sword of thine but rememb thi lad guard thy
head with thy buckler cut low beneath hi shield if he carri on
and mow the leg from him for ever a baresark rush on shield up
eric thank him for hi good word and went to rest but befor it
wa light he rose and gudruda rose also and came into the hall and
buckl hi har on him with her own hand
thi is a sad task for me eric she sigh for how do i know that
baresark hand shall not loos thi helm of thine
that is as it mai be sweet he said but i fear not the baresark or
ani man how goe it with swanhild now
i know not she make herself sweet to that old earl and he is fain of
her and that is beyond my sight
i have seen as much said eric it will be well for us if he should
wed her
ay and ill for him but it is to be doubt if that is in her mind
now eric kiss her soft and sweet and went awai bid her look for
hi return on the dai after the morrow
gudruda bore up brave against her fear till he wa gone but then she
wept a littl
now it is to be told that eric and hi thrall jon rode hard up stonefel
and across the mountain and over the black sand till two hour befor
sunset thei came to the foot of mosfel have hecla on their right
it is a grim mountain grei with moss stand alon in the desert
plain but between it and hecla there is good grassland
here is the fox earth now to start him said eric
he know someth of the path by which thi fortress can be climb
from the south and hors mai be ridden up it for a space so on thei
go till at length thei come to a flat place where water run down the
black rock and here eric drank of the water at food and wash hi
face and hand thi done he bid jon tend the horsesfor hereabout
there is a littl grassand be watch till he return sinc he
must go up against skallagrim alon and there with a doubt heart
jon stai all that night for of all that came to pass he saw but on
thing and that wa the light of whitefir as it flash out high abov
him on the brow of the mountain when first brightey smote at foe
eric went warili up the baresark path for he would keep hi breath in
him and the light shone redli on hi golden helm high he went till at
length he came to a pass narrow and dark and hedg on either side
with sheer cliff such as two arm men might hold against a score
he peer down thi path but he saw no baresark though it wa worn by
baresark feet he crept along it length move like a sunbeam through
the dark of the pass for the light gather on hi helm and sword
till suddenli the path turn and he wa on the brink of a gulf that
seem to have no bottom and look across and down he could see jon
and the hors more than a hundr fathom beneath now eric must stop
for thi path lead but into the black gulf also he wa perplex to
know where skallagrim had hi lair he crept to the brink and gaze
then he saw that a point of rock jut from the sheer face of the cliff
and that the point wa worn with the mark of feet
where baresark pass there mai yeoman follow said eric and
sheath whitefir without more ado though he like the task littl
he grasp the overhang rock and step down on to the point below
now he wa perch like an eagl over the dizzi gulf and hi brain
swam backward he fear to go and forward he might not for there wa
noth but air besid him grow from the face of the cliff wa a
birchbush he grasp it to steadi himself it bent beneath hi clutch
and then he saw behind it a hole in the rock through which a man could
creep and down thi hole ran footmark
first through air like a bird now through earth like a fox said eric
and enter the hole doubl hi bodi till hi helm almost touch hi
knee he took three pace and lo he stood on a great platform of rock
so larg that a hall might be built on it which curv inward
cannot be seen from the narrow pass thi platform that is back
by the sheer cliff look straight to the south and from it he could
search the plain and the path that he had travel and there onc more
he saw jon and the hors far below him
a strong place truli and well chosen said eric and look around
on the floor of the rock and some pace from him a turf fire still
smoulder and by it were sheep bone and beyond in the face of the
overhang precipic wa the mouth of a cave
the wolf is at home or wa but late said eric now for hi lair
and with that he walk warili to the mouth of the cave and peer
in he could see noth yet a while but sure he heard a sound of
snore
then he crept in and present by the red light of the burn
ember he saw a great blackbeard man stretch at length upon a rug
of sheepskin and by hi side an ax
now it would be easi to make an end of thi cavedwel thought
eric but that is a deed i will not dono not even to a baresarkto
slai him in hi sleep and therewith he step lightli to the side
of skallagrim and wa about to prick him with the point of whitefir
when as he did so anoth man sat up behind skallagrim
by thor for two i did not bargain said eric and sprang from the
cave
then with a grunt of rage that baresark who wa behind skallagrim
came out like a shebear rob of her whelp and ran straight at eric
sword aloft eric give befor him right to the edg of the cliff
then the baresark smite at him and brightey catch the blow on hi
shield and smite at him in turn so well and truli that the head of
the baresark fli from hi shoulder and spin along the ground but
hi bodi with outstretch arm yet grip at the air fall over the
edg of the gulf sheer into the water a hundr fathom down it wa
the flash that whitefir made as it circl er it smote that jon saw
while he wait in the dell upon the mountain side but of the baresark
he saw noth for he pass down into the great fireriven cleft and
wa never seen more save onc onli in a strang fashion that shall be
told thi wa the first man whom brightey slew
now the old tale tell that eric cri aloud littl chanc had thi
on and that then a wonder thing came to pass for the head on the
rock open it ey and answer
littl chanc inde against thee eric brightey still i tell thee
thi that where my bodi fell there thou shalt fall and where it li
there thou shalt lie also
now eric wa afraid for he thought it a strang thing that a sever
head should speak to him
here it seem i have to deal with troll he said but at the least
though he speak thi on shall strike no more and he look at the
head but it answer noth
now skallagrim slept through it all and the light grew so dim that eric
thought it time to make an end thi wai or that therefor he took
the head of the slain man though he fear to touch it and roll it
swiftli into the cave sai now be so glib of speech go tell
thy mate that eric brightey knock at hi door
then came sound as of a man rise and present skallagrim rush
forth with ax aloft and hi fellow head in hi left hand he wa
cloth in noth but a shirt and the skin of eric lamb wa bound to
hi chest
where now is my mate he said then he saw eric lean on whitefir
hi golden helm ablaz with the glori of the pass sun
it seem that thou holdest somewhat of him in thine hand skallagrim
and for the rest go seek it in yonder rift
who art thou roar skallagrim
thou mayest know me by thi token said eric and he threw toward him
the skin of that lamb tail which skallagrim had lift from coldback
now skallagrim knew him and the baresark fit came on hi ey roll
foam flew to hi lip hi mouth grin and he wa awesom to see he
let fall the head and swing the great ax aloft rush at eric
but brightey is too swift for him it would not be well to let that
stroke fall and it must go hard with aught it struck he spring
forward he lout low and sweep upward with whitefir skallagrim see
the sword flare and drop almost to hi knee guard hi head with the
ax but whitefir strike on the iron half of the ax and shear it in
two so that the axehead fall to earth now the baresark is weaponless
but unharm and it would be an easi task to slai him as he rush
by but it came into eric mind that it is an unworthi deed to slai
a swordless man and thi came into hi mind also that he desir
to match hi nake might against a baresark in hi rage so in the
hardihood of hi youth and strength he cast whitefir asid and cry
come try a fall with me baresark rush on skallagrim
thou art mad yell the baresark and thei ar at it hard now thei
grip and rend and tear ospakar wa strong but the baresark strength
of skallagrim is more than the strength of ospakar and soon brightey
think longingli on whitefir that he ha cast asid eric is mighti
beyond the might of men but he can scarc hold hi own against thi
mad man and veri soon he know that onli on chanc is left to him and
that is to cling to skallagrim till the baresark fit be pass and he is
onc more like other men but thi is easier to tell of than to do and
present strive as he will eric is on hi back and skallagrim
on him but still he hold the baresark as with band of iron and
skallagrim mai not free hi arm though he strive furious now thei
roll over and over on the rock and the gloom gather fast about them
till present eric see that thei draw near to the brink of that mighti
rift down which the sever head of the cavedwel ha foretold hi
fall
then we go togeth sai eric but the baresark doe not heed now
thei ar on the veri brink and here as it chanc or as the norn
decre a littl rock jut up and thi keep them from fall eric is
uppermost and strive as he will skallagrim mai not turn him on hi
back again still brightey strength mai not endur veri long for he
grow faint and hi leg slip slowli over the side of the rift till now
he cling as it were by hi rib and shoulderblad alon that rub
against the littl rock the light di awai and eric think on sweet
gudruda and make readi to die also when suddenli a last rai from the
sun fall on the fierc face of skallagrim and lo brightey see it
chang for the mad goe out of it and in a moment the baresark
becom but as a child in hi mighti grip
hold said skallagrim i crave peac and he loos hi clasp
not too soon then gasp eric as draw hi leg from over the
brink of the rift he gain hi feet and stagger to hi sword
grasp it veri thankfulli
i am fordon said skallagrim come drag me from thi place for i
fall or if thou wilt hew off my head
i will not serv thee thu said eric thou art a gallant foe and
he put out hi hand and drew him into safeti
for a while skallagrim lai pant then he gain hi hand and knee
and crawl to where eric lean against the rock
lord he said give me thy hand
eric stretch forth hi left hand wonder and skallagrim took
it he did not stretch out hi right for fear guil he grip
whitefir in it
lord skallagrim said again of all men who ever were thou art
the mightiest five other men had not stood befor me in my rage but
scorn thy weapon thou didst overcom me in the noblest fashion and
by thy nake strength alon now hearken thou hast given me my life
and it is thine from thi hour to the end here i swear fealti to thee
slai me if thou wilt or us me if thou wilt but i think it will be
better for thee to do thi rather than that for there is but on who
ha master me and thou art he and it is born in upon my mind that
thou wilt have need of my strength and that shortli
that mai well be skallagrim said eric yet i put littl trust in
outlaw and cavedwel how do i know if i take thee to me that
thou wilt not murder me in my sleep as it would have been easi for me
to do by thee but now
what is it that run from thy arm ask skallagrim

eric did so and the baresark put hi lip to the scratch and suck the
blood then said
in thi blood of thine i pledg thee eric brightey mai valhalla
refus me and hela take me mai i be hunt like a fox from earth to
earth mai troll torment me and wizard sport with me o night mai my

thrall am i of thine and thrall i will be and while thou wilt we will
live on life and in the end we will die on death

and it is like enough that i shall need on skallagrim baresark and
outlaw as thou art i take thee at thy word henceforth we ar master
and man and we will do mani a deed side by side and in token of it i
lengthen thy name and call thee skallagrim lambstail now if thou hast
it give me food and drink for i am faint from that hug of thine old

viii
how ospakar blacktooth found eric brightey and skallagrim lambstail on
horsehead height
now skallagrim led eric to hi cave and fed the fire and gave him flesh
to eat and al to drink when he had eaten hi fill eric look at the
baresark he had black hair streak with grei that hung down upon hi
shoulder hi nose wa hook like an eagl beak hi beard wa wild
and hi sunken ey were keen as a hawk he wa somewhat bent and not
over tall but of a mighti make for hi shoulder must pass mani a door
sidewai
thou art a great man said eric and it is someth to have overcom
thee now tell me what turn thee baresark
a shame deed that wa done against me lord ten year ago i wa a
yeoman of small wealth in the north i had but on good thing and that
wa the fairest housewif in those partsthorunna by nameand i love
her much but we had no children now not far from my stead is a
place call swinefel and there dwell a mighti chief name ospakar
blacktooth he is an evil man and strong
eric start at the name and then bade skallagrim take up the tale
it chanc that ospakar saw my wife thorunna and would take her but
at first she did not listen then he promis her wealth and all good
thing and she wa weari of our hard wai of life and hearken still
she would not go awai openli for that had brought shame on her but
plot with ospakar that he should come and take her as though by
forc so it came about as i lai heavili asleep on night at thorunna
side have drunk somewhat too deepli of the autumn al that arm men
seiz me bound me and hale me from my bed there were eight of them
and with them wa ospakar then blacktooth bid thorunna rise cloth
herself and come to be hi mai and she made pretenc to weep at thi
but fell to it readili enough now she bound her girdl round her and to
it a knife hung
kill thyself sweet i cri death is better than shame
not so husband she answer it is true that i love but thee
yet a woman mai find anoth love but not anoth life and i saw
her laugh through her mock tear now ospakar rode in hot hast awai
to swinefel and with him went thorunna but hi men stai a while and
drank my al and as thei drank thei mock me who wa bound befor
them and littl by littl all the truth wa told of the do of
ospakar and thorunna my housewif and i learn that it wa she who had
plan thi sport then my ey grew dark and i drew near to death from
veri shame and bitter but of a sudden someth leap up in my
heart fire rage befor my ey and voic in my ear call on to war
and vengeanc i wa baresarkand like hai band i burst my cord my
ax hung on the wainscot i snatch it thenc and of what befel i
know thi alon that when the mad pass eight men lai stretch
out befor me and all the place wa but a gore of blood
then i drew the dead togeth and pile drink tabl over them and
bench and turf and anyth els that would burn and put cod
oil on the pile and fire the stead abov them so that the tale went
abroad that all these men were burn in their cup and i with them
but i took the name of skallagrim and swore an oath against all men
ay and women too and awai i went to the woodfolk and work much
mischief for i spare few and so on to mosfel here i have stai
these five year await the time when i shall find ospakar and
thorunna the harlot and i have fought mani men but till thou camest
up against me none could stand befor my might
a strang tale truli said eric but now hearken thou to a stranger
for of a truth it seem that we have not come togeth by chanc
and he told him of gudruda and the wrestl and of the overthrow of
blacktooth and show him whitefir which he won out of the hand of
ospakar
skallagrim listen and laugh aloud sure he said thi is the
work of the norn see lord thou and i will yet smite thi ospakar he
ha taken my wife and he would take thy betroth let it be let it be
ah would that i had been there to see the wrestlingospakar had never
risen from hi snowb but there is time left to us and i shall yet
see hi head roll along the dust thou hast hi goodli sword and with it
thou shalt sweep blacktooth head from hi shouldersor perchanc that
shall be my lot and with thi skallagrim sprang up gnash hi teeth
and clutch at the air
peac said eric blacktooth is not here save thy rage until it can
run along thy sword and strike him
nai not here nor yet so far off lord hearken i know thi ospakar
if he ha set ey of long on gudruda asmund daughter he will not
rest on hour till he have her or is slain and if he ha set ey of
hate on theethen take heed to thy go and spy down everi path befor
thy feet tread it soon shall the matter come on for judgment and even
now odin valkyri choos their own
the corsechoos sister who were bidden by odin to
singl out those warrior whose hour had come to die in
battl and win valhalla
it is well then said eric
yea lord it is well for we two have littl to fear from ani six men
if so be that thei fall on us in fair fight but i do not altogeth
like thy tale too mani women ar mix up in it and women stab in the
back a man mai deal with sword aloft but not with trick and li
and fals women witcheri it wa a woman who greas thy wrestl
sole mayhap it will be a woman that bind on thy hellsho when all
is doneai and who make them readi for thy feet
of women as of men answer eric there is thi to be said that
some ar good and some evil
ye lord and thi also that the evil on plot the ill of their
evil but the good do it of their blind foolish forswear women and
so shalt thou live happi and die in honourcherish them and live in
wretched and die an outcast
thy talk is foolish said eric bird must to the air the sea to
the shore and man must to woman as thing ar so let them be for thei
will soon seem as though thei had never been i had rather kiss my dear
and die if so it pleas me to do than kiss her not and live for at
the last the end will be on end and kiss ar sweet
that is a good sai said skallagrim and thei fell asleep side by
side and eric had no fear
now thei awok and the light wa alreadi full for thei were weari and
their sleep had been heavi
hard by the mouth of the cave is a littl well of water that gather
there from the rock abov and in thi eric wash himself then
skallagrim show him the cave and the goodli store of arm that he had
won from those whom he had slain and rob
a wondrou place truli said eric and well fit to the us of
such a chapman as thou art but sai how didst thou find it
merchant
i follow him who wa here befor me and gave him choiceto go or to
fight for the stronghold but he need must fight and that wa hi bane
for i slew him
who wa that then ask eric whose head li yonder
a cavedwel lord whom i took to me becaus of the lonesom
of the winter tide he wa an evil man for though it is good to be
baresark from time to time yet to dwell with on who is alwai baresark
is not good and thou didst a need deed in smite hi head from
himand now let it go to find it trunk and he roll it over the
edg of the great rift
knowest thou skallagrim that thi head spoke to me after it had left
the man shoulder sai that where it bodi fell there i should
fall and where it lai there i should lie also
then lord that is like to be thy doom for thi man wa
foresight and but the night befor last as we rode out to seek
sheep he felt hi head and said that befor the sun sank again a
hundr fathom of air should link it to hi shoulder
it mai be so answer eric i thought as i lai in thy grip yonder
that the fate wa near and now arm thyself and take such good as thou
needest and let us henc for that thrall of mine who wait me yonder
will think thou hast been too mighti for me
skallagrim went to the edg of the rift and search the plain with hi
hawk ey
no need to hasten lord he said see yonder ride thy thrall across
the black sand and with him goe thy hors sure he thought thou
camest no more down the path by which thou wentest up and it is not
thrall work to seek skallagrim in hi lair and ask for tide
wolv take him for a fool said eric in anger he will ride to
middalhof and sing my deathsong and that will sound sadli in some
ear
it is pleasant lord said skallagrim when good tide dog the
heel of bad and womenfolk can spare some tear and be littl poorer i
have hors in a secret dell that i will show thee and on them we will
ride henc to middalhofand there thou must claim peac for me
it is well said eric now arm thyself for if thou goest with me
thou must make an end of thy baresark wai or keep them for the hour of
battl
i will do thy bid lord said skallagrim then he enter the cave
and set a plain black steel helm upon hi black lock and a black chain
byrni about hi breast he took the great axehead also and fit to
it the half of anoth ax that lai among the weapon then he drew out
a purs of monei and a store of golden ring and set them in a bag of
otter skin and buckl it about him but the other good he wrap
up in skin and hid behind some stone which were at the bottom of the
cavepurpos to come anoth time and fetch them
then thei went forth by that same peril path which eric had trod and
skallagrim show him how he might pass the rock in safeti
a rough road thi said eric as he gain the deep cleft
yea lord and till thou camest on that none but woodfolk have
trodden
i would tread it no more said eric again and yet that fellow thief
of thine said that i should die here and for a while hi heart wa
heavi
now skallagrim lambstail led him by secret path to a dell rich in
grass that is hid in the round of the mountain and here three good
hors were at feed then go to a certain rock he brought out bit
and saddl and thei caught the hors and mount them rode awai
from mosfel
now eric and hi henchman skallagrim the baresark rode four hour and
saw nobodi till at length thei came to the brow of a hill that is name
horsehead height and cross it found themselv almost in the
midst of a score of arm men who were about to mount their hors
now we have compani said skallagrim
ye and bad compani answer eric for yonder i spy ospakar
blacktooth and gizur and mord hi son ay and other down and back
to back for thei will show us littl gentl
then thei sprang to earth and took their stand upon a mound of rise
groundand the men rode toward them
i shall soon know what thy fellowship is worth said eric
fear not lord answer skallagrim hold thou thy head and i will
hold thy back we ar met in a good hour

must turn baresark when sword begin to flash at the least stand and be
baresark where thou art for if thou rushest on the foe my back will be
nake and i must soon be sped

now men rode round them but at first thei did not know eric becaus of
the golden helm that hid hi face in shadow
who ar ye call ospakar
i think that thou shouldst know me blacktooth eric answer for
i set thee heel up in the snow but latelyor at the least thou wilt

spear at him with all hi might
but skallagrim catch the spear as it fli and hurl it back it
strike right on the shield of ospakar and pierc it ay and the
byrni and the shoulder that is beneath the byrni so that blacktooth
wa made unmeet for fight and howl with pain and rage
go bid thorunna draw that splinter forth sai skallagrim and heal

now ospakar writh with hi hurt shout to hi men to slai the two
of them and then the fight begin

and lai there sob
it wa a sweet sight thu to see gudruda the fair her head of gold
pillow on eric warstain byrni her dark ey afloat with tear
of joi but not so thought swanhild watch she shook in jealou
rage then crept awai and hid herself where she could see no more lest
she should be smitten with mad
whenc camest thou ah whenc camest thou said gudruda i thought

hi hors he caught sight of a woman seat on the grass and knew the
colour of the cloak
then gudruda kiss him for veri joi and thei were happi each with
eachfor of all thing that ar sweet on earth there is noth more
sweet that thi to find him we love and thought dead and cold aliv
and at our side
and so thei talk and were veri glad with the glad of youth and
love till eric said he must on to middalhof befor the light fail
for he could not come on horseback the wai that gudruda took but must
ride round the shoulder of the hill and moreov he wa spent with
toil and hunger and skallagrim grew weari of wait

strive as thou mayest against thy fate that maid will be thy bane and
mine also

be her familiar for like groa her mother swanhild plai much with
witchcraft now i will awai back to gudruda for my heart misdoubt me
of thi matter stai thou here till i come lambstail and eric turn
and gallop back to the head of goldfoss
when eric left her gudruda drew yet nearer to the edg of the mighti
fall and seat herself on their veri brink her breast wa full
of joi and there she sat and let the splendour of the night and the

how asmund spoke with swanhild
now as the dai went though atli ship wa bound for sea she did not
sail and it came about that the earl sank ever deeper in the toil
of swanhild he call to mind mani wise saw but these avail him
littl for when love rise like the sun wisdom melt like the mist
so at length it came to thi that on the dai of eric come back
atli went to asmund the priest and ask him for the hand of swanhild
the fatherless in marriag asmund heard and wa glad for he knew well
that thing went badli between swanhild and gudruda and it seem good
to him that sea should be set between them nevertheless he thought it
honest to warn the earl that swanhild wa apart from other women
thou dost great honour earl to my fosterdaught and my hous he
said still it behov me to move gentli in thi matter swanhild is
fair and she shall not go henc a wife undow but i must tell thee
thi that her wai ar dark and secret and strang and fieri ar her
mood and i think that she will bring evil on the man who wed her
now i love thee atli were it onli for our youth sake and thou art
not altogeth fit to mate with such a maid for ag ha met thee on thy
wai for as thou wouldst sai youth draw to youth as the tide to the
shore and fall awai from eld as the wave from the rock think then
is it well that thou shouldst take her atli
i have thought much and overmuch answer the earl stroke hi grei
beard but ship old and new drive befor a gale

and if it sink mewel i have known fair weather great long ha
got hold of me and i think the maid look gentli on me and that thing
mai yet go well between us i have mani thing to give such as women
love at the least if thou givest me thy good word i will risk it
asmund for the bold thrower sometim win the stake onli i sai thi
that if swanhild is unwil let there be an end of my woo for i
do not wish to take a bride who turn from my grei hair
asmund said that it should be so and thei made an end of talk just
as the light fade
now asmund went out seek swanhild and present he met her near the
stead he could not see her face and that wa well for it wa not good
to look on but her mien wa wondrou wild
where hast thou been swanhild he ask

it is meeter for gudruda to mourn over eric than for thee for her loss

all wept for ar not lost nor all who ar lost wept for
littl do i know of thy dark rede said asmund where is gudruda
now
high is she or low sleep or perchanc awaken naught reck i she
also mourn for eric and we went nigh to mingl tearsnear togeth
were brown curl and golden and she laugh aloud

ay fosterfath fei yet is thi but the first of my feydom here
start the road that i must travel and my feet shall be red er the
journei done

fosterfath
thi atli the earl ask thee in marriag and he is a mighti man well
honour in hi own land and set higher moreov than i had look

ay answer swanhild set like the snow abov the fell set in the
year that long ar dead nai fosterfath thi whitebeard
dotard is no mate for me what shall i mix my fire with hi frost my
breath youth with the creep palsi of hi ag never if swanhild
wed she wed not so for it is better to go maiden to the grave than
thu to shrink and wither at the touch of eld now is atli woo
sped and there an end
asmund heard and grew wroth for the matter seem strang to him nor
ar maiden wont thu to put asid the word of those set over them
there is no end he said i will not be answer thu by a girl who
live upon my bounti it is my rede that thou weddest atli or els thou
goest henc i have love thee and for that love sake i have born
thy wicked thy dark secret wai and evil word but i will be
cross no more by thee swanhild
thou wouldst drive me henc with groa my mother though perchanc thou
hast yet more reason to hold me dear fosterfath fear not i will
goperhap further than thou thinkest and onc more swanhild laugh
and pass from him into the dark
but asmund stood look after her truli he said in hi heart ill
deed ar arrow that pierc him who shot them i have sow evilli and
now i reap the harvest what mean she with her talk of gudruda and the
rest
now as he thought he saw men and hors draw near and on man whose
helm gleam in the moonlight bore someth in hi arm
who pass he call
eric brightey skallagrim lambstail and gudruda asmund daughter
answer a voic who art thou
then asmund the priest sprang forward most glad at heart for he never
thought to see eric again
welcom and thrice welcom art thou eric he cri for know we
deem thee dead
i have late gone near to death lord said eric for he knew the
voic but i am hale and whole though somewhat weari
what ha come to pass then ask asmund and why holdest thou
gudruda in thy arm is the maid dead
nai she doe but swoon see even now she stir and as he spake
gudruda awok shudder and with a littl cry threw her arm about
the neck of eric
he set her down and comfort her then onc more turn to asmund
three thing have come about he said first i have slain on
baresark and won anoth to be my thrall and for him i crave thy
peac for he ha serv me well next we two were set upon by ospakar
blacktooth and hi fellowship and fight for our hand have wound
ospakar slain mord hi son and six other men of hi follow
that is good new and bad said asmund sinc ospakar will ask a
great weregild for these men and thou wilt be outlaw eric
the penalti for manslai
that mai happen lord there is time enough to think of it now there
ar other tide to tell come to the head of goldfoss i found
gudruda my betroth mourn my death and spoke with her afterward
i left her and present return again to see her hang over the
gulf and swanhild hurl rock upon her to crush her
these ar tide in truth said asmundsuch tide as my heart
fear is thi true gudruda
it is true my father answer gudruda trembl as i sat on the
brink of goldfoss swanhild crept behind me and thrust me into the gulf
there i clung abov the water and she brought a rock to hurl upon me
when suddenli i saw eric face and after that my mind left me and i
can tell no more
now asmund grew as on mad he pluck at hi beard and stamp on the
ground maid though she be he cri yet shall swanhild back be
broken on the stone of doom for a witch and a murderess and her bodi
hurl into the pool of faithless women and the earth will be well rid
of her
now gudruda look up and smile it would be ill to wreak such a
vengeanc on her father she said and thi would also bring the
greatest shame on thee and all our hous i am save by the merci
of the god and the might of eric arm and thi is my counsel that
noth be told of thi tale but that swanhild be sent awai where she
can harm us no more
she must be sent to the grave then said asmund and fell to
think present he spoke again bid yon man fall back i would
speak with you twain and skallagrim went grumbl
hearken now eric and gudruda onli an hour ago hath atli the good
ask swanhild of me in marriag but now i met swanhild here and her
mien wa wild still i spoke of the matter to her and she would have
none of it now thi is my counsel that choic be given to swanhild
either that she go henc atli wife or take her trial in the
doomr
that will be bad for the earl then said eric methink he is too
good a man to be plai on thu
bairn first then friend answer asmund
now i will tell thee someth that till thi hour i have hidden from
all for it is my shame thi swanhild is my daughter and therefor i
have love her and put awai her evil deed and she is halfsist
to thee gudruda see then how sore is my straight who must aveng
daughter upon daughter
know thy son bjrn of thi ask eric
none knew it till thi hour except groa and i
yet i have fear it long father said gudruda and therefor i have
also born with swanhild though she hate me much and ha striven hard
to draw my betroth from me now thou canst onli take on counsel
and it is to give choic to swanhild of these two thing though it is
unworthi that atli should be deceiv and at the best littl good can
come of it
yet it must be done for honour is often slain of heavi need said
asmund but we must first swear thi baresark thrall of thine though
littl faith live in baresark breast
now eric call to skallagrim and charg him strictli that he should
tell noth of swanhild and of the wolf that he saw by her and of how
gudruda wa found hang over the gulf
fear not growl the baresark my tongu is now my master what
is it to me if women do their wicked on on anoth let them
work magic hate and slai by stealth so shall evil be lessen in the
world
peac said eric if anyth of thi pass thy lip thou art no
longer a thrall of mine and i give thee up to the men of thy quarter
and i cleav that wolf head of thine down to thy hawk ey but
otherwis i give thee peac and will hold thee from harm wooddwel
as thou art said asmund
the baresark laugh my hand will hold my head against ten such
mannikin as thou art priest there wa never but on man who might
overcom me in fair fight and there he stand and hi bid is my
law so wast no word and make not nidder threat against greater
folk and he slouch back to hi hors

look littl
natheless a strong in battl quoth eric had he not been at my back
some six hour gone by now the raven had torn out these ey of mine
therefor for my sake bear with him
asmund said it should be so and then thei pass on to the stead
here eric strip off hi har wash and bound up hi wound
then follow by skallagrim ax in hand he came into the hall as men
made readi to sit at meat now the tale of the mighti deed that he
had done except that of the save of gudruda had gone abroad and as
brightey came all men rose and with on voic shout till the roof of
the great hall rock
welcom eric brightey thou glori of the south
onli bjrn asmund son bit hi hand and did not shout for he hate
eric becaus of the fame that he had won
brightey stood still till the clamour di then said
much nois for littl deed brethren it is true that i overthrew the
mosfel baresark see here is on and he turn to skallagrim i
strangl him in my arm on mosfel brink and that wa someth of
a deed then he swore fealti to me and we ar bloodbrethren now and
therefor i ask peac for him comradeseven from those whom he ha
wrong or whose kin he ha slain i know thi that when thereaft we
stood back to back and met the compani of ospakar blacktooth who
came to slai usai and asmund also and bear awai gudruda to be hi
wifeh war right gallantli till seven of their band lai stiff on
horsehead height overthrown of us and among them mord blacktooth
son and ospakar himself went thenc sore smitten of thi skallagrim
therefor for my sake do no harm to thi man who wa baresark but now
is my thrall and moreov i beg the aid and friendship of all men of
thi quarter in those suit that will be laid against me at the alth
for these slai which i herebi give out as done by my hand and by
the hand of skallagrim lambstail the baresark
at these word all men shout again but atli the earl sprang from the
high seat where asmund had place him and come to eric kiss him
and draw a gold chain from hi neck flung it about the neck of
eric cry
thou art a gloriou man eric brightey i thought the world had no
more of such a breed listen to my bid come thou to the earldom in
orknei and be a son to me and i will give thee all good gift and
when i die thou shalt sit in my seat after me
but eric thought of swanhild who must go from iceland as wife to atli
and answer
thou doest me great honour earl but thi mai not be where the fir
is plant there it must grow and fall iceland i love and i will stai
here among my own peopl till i am driven awai
that mai well happen then said atli for be sure ospakar and hi
kin will not let the matter of these slai rest and i think that
it will not avail thee much that thou smotest for thine own hand then
come thou and be my man
where the norn lead there i must follow said eric and sat down to
meat skallagrim sat down also at the sidebench but men shrank from
him and he glower on them in answer
present gudruda enter and she seem pale and faint
when he had done eat eric drew gudruda on to hi knee and she sat
there rest her golden head upon hi breast but swanhild did not
come into the hall though ever earl atli sought her dark face and
love ey of blue and he wonder greatli how hi woo had sped
still at thi time he spoke no more of it to asmund
now skallagrim drank much al and glare about him fierc for he
had thi fault that at time he wa drunken in front of him were two
thrall of asmund thei were brother and largemad men and thei
watch asmund sheep upon the fell in winter these two also grew
drunk and jeer at skallagrim ask him what aton he would make
for those ew of asmund that he had stolen last yule and how it came
to pass that he a baresark had been overthrown of an unarm man
skallagrim bore their gibe for a space as he drank on but suddenli
he rose and rush at them and seiz a man throat in either hand
thrust them to the ground beneath him and nearli choke them there
then eric ran down the hall and put out hi strength tore the
baresark from them
thi then is thy peac thou wolf eric cri thou art
drunk
ay growl skallagrim al is mani a man doom
have a care that it is not thine and mine then said eric go
sleep and know that if i see thee thu onc more i see thee not

but after thi men jeer no more at skallagrim lambstail eric
thrall
xi
how swanhild bid farewel to eric
now all thi while asmund sat deep in thought but when at length men
were sunk in sleep he took a candl of fat and pass to the shut bed
where swanhild slept alon she lai on her bed and her curl hair wa
all about her she wa awak for the light gleam in her blue ey
and on a nake knife that wa on the bed besid her half hidden by her
hair
what wouldst thou fosterfath she ask rise in the couch
asmund close the curtain then look at her sternli and spoke in a
low voic
thou art fair to be so vile a thing swanhild he said who now
would have dream that heart of thine could talk with goblin and with
werewolvesthat those ey of thine could bear to look on murder and
those white hand find strength to do the sin
she held up her shape arm and look on them laugh would that
thei had been fashion in a stronger mould she said mai thei wither
in their woman weak els had the deed been done outright now my
crime is as heavi upon me and noth gain by it sai what fate for
me fosterfatherth stone of doom and the pool where faithless women
lie ah then might gudruda laugh inde and i will not live to hear
that laugh see and she grip the dagger at her side along thi
bright edg run the path to peac and freedom and if need be i will
tread it
be silent said asmund thi gudruda my daughter whom thou wouldst
have foulli done to death is thine own sister and it is she who
piti thee hath plead for thy life
i will naught of her piti who have no piti she answer and thi
i sai to thee who art my father shame be on thee who hast not dare to
own thy child
hadst thou not been my child swanhild and had i not love thee
secretli as my child be sure of thi i had long sinc driven thee
henc for my ey have been open to much that i have not seem to see
but at length thy wicked ha overcom my love and i will see thy
face no more listen none have heard of thi shame deed of thine
save those who saw it and their tongu ar seal now i give thee
choic wed atli and go or stand in the doomr and take thy fate

market i have answer
fool think again for i go not back upon my word wed atli or diebi
thy own hand if thou wiltther i will not gainsai thee or if thou
fearest thi then anon in the doomr
now swanhild cover her ey with her hand and shook the long hair
about her face and she seem wondrou fair to asmund the priest who
watch and as she sat thu it came into her mind that marriag is
not the end of a young maid lifethat old husband have been known to
die and that she might rule thi atli and hi earldom and becom a rich
and honour woman set her sail in such fashion that when the wind
turn it would fill them otherwis she must dieai die shame and
leav gudruda with her love
suddenli she slip from the bed to the floor of the chamber and
clasp the knee of asmund look up through the mesh of her hair
while tear stream from her beauti ey
i have sin she sobbedi have sin greatli against thee and my
sister hearken i wa mad with love of eric whom from a child i have
turn to and gudruda is fairer than i and she took him from me most

made as though she rent her bosomi will wed atli and be a good
housewif to him and i crave but thi of gudruda that she forgiv me
her wrong for it wa not done of my will but of my mad and of the
drive of those whom my mother taught me to know
asmund listen and the spring of hi love thaw within him now thou
dost take good counsel he said and of thi be sure that so long as
thou art in that mood none shall harm thee and for gudruda she is the
most gentl of women and it mai well be that she will put awai thy sin
so weep no more and have no more deal with thy finnish witchcraft
but sleep and tomorrow i will bear thy word to atli for hi ship is
bound and thou must swiftli be made a wife
he went out bear the light with him but swanhild rose from the
ground and sat on the edg of the bed stare into the dark and
shudder from time to time
i shall soon be made hi wife she murmur who would be but on
man wifeand methink i shall soon be made a widow also thou wilt

doubt me much of their power and i shall soon wean swanhild from such

then thei fell to talk of swanhild dower and that wa not small
afterward asmund sought eric and gudruda and told them what had come
to pass and thei were glad at the new though thei griev for atli
the earl and when swanhild met gudruda she came to her humbl and
humbl kiss her hand and with tear crave pardon of her evil do
sai that she had been mad nor did gudruda withhold it for of all
women she wa the gentlest and most forgiv but to eric swanhild
said noth
the weddingfeast must be held on the third dai from thi for atli

ship might lie bound no longer blith wa atli the earl and swanhild
wa all chang for now she seem the gentlest of maid and as
befit on about to be made a wife move through the hous with soft
word and downcast ey but skallagrim watch her bethought him of
the grei wolf that he had seen by goldfoss and thi seem not well to
him
it would be bad now he said to eric as thei rode to coldback to
stand in yon old earl shoe thi woman weather ha chang too
fast and after such a calm therel come a storm inde i am now
mind of thorunna for she went just so the dai befor she gave herself
to ospakar and me to shame and bond
talk not of the raven till you hear hi croak said eric
he is on the wing lord answer skallagrim
now eric came to coldback in the marsh and saevuna hi mother and unna
thorod daughter the betroth of asmund were glad to welcom him
for the tide of hi mighti deed and of the overthrow of ospakar
and the slai of mord were nois far and wide but at skallagrim
lambstail thei look askanc still when thei heard of those thing
that he had wrought on horsehead height thei welcom him for hi
deed sake
eric sat two night at coldback and on the second dai saevuna hi
mother and unna rode thenc with their servant to the weddingfeast of
swanhild the fatherless but eric stop at coldback that night sai
that he would be at middalhof within two hour of sunris for he must
talk with a shepherd who came from the fell
saevuna and her compani came to middalhof and wa ask first by
gudruda then by swanhild why brightey tarri she answer that he
would be there earli on the morrow next morn befor it wa light
eric gird on whitefir took hors and rode from coldback alon for
he would not bring skallagrim fear lest he should get drunk at the
feast and shed some man blood
it wa swanhild weddingdai but she greet it with littl
lightsom of heart and her ey knew no sleep that night though
thei were heavi with tear
at the first light she rose and glide from the hous walk through
the heavi dew down the path by which eric must draw near for she
desir to speak with him gudruda also rose a while after though she
did not know thi and follow on the same path for she would greet
her lover at hi come
now three furlong or more from the stead stood a vetch stack and
swanhild wait on the further side of thi stack present she heard
a sound of sing come from behind the shoulder of the fell and of the
tramp of a hors hoof then she saw the golden wing of eric
helm all ablaz with the sunlight as he rode merrili along and great
bitter laid hold of her that eric could be of such a joyou mood on
the dai when she who love him must be made the wife of anoth man
present he wa befor her and swanhild step from the shadow of the
stack and laid her hand upon hi hors bridl
eric she said humbl and with bow head gudruda sleep yet canst
thou then find time to hearken to my word
he frown and said methink swanhild it would be better if thou
gavest thy word to him who is thy lord
she let the bridlerein drop from her hand i am answer she said

swanhild wipe her ey and glide thenc

noth of it that swanhild had tri to murder her gudruda could
forgiv for there she had fail but not that she had won eric to kiss
her for in thi she had succeed well
xii
how eric wa outlaw and sail avik
now the marriagefeast went on and swanhild drape in white and girt
about with gold sat by atli side upon the high seat he wa fain of
her and drew her to him but she look at him with cold calm ey in
which hate lurk the feast wa done and all the compani rode to the
sea strand where the earl ship lai at anchor thei came there and
swanhild kiss asmund and talk a while with groa her mother
and bade farewel to all men but she bade no farewel to eric and to
gudruda
why sayest thou no word to these two ask atli her husband
for thi reason earl she answer becaus er long we three shall
meet again but i shall see asmund my father and groa my mother no
more
that is an ill sai wife said atli methink thou dost foretel
their doom
mayhap and now i will add to my rede for i foretel thy doom also
it is not yet but it draw on
then atli bethought him of mani wise saw but spoke no more for it
seem to him thi wa a strang bride that he had wed
thei haul the anchor home shook out the great sail and pass awai
into the even night but while land could still be seen swanhild
stood near the helm gaze with her blue ey upon the lessen coast
then she pass to the hold and shut herself in alon and there she
stai sai that she wa sick till at length after a fair voyag of
twenti dai thei made the orknei island
but all thi pleas atli wondrou ill yet he dare not cross her mood
now in iceland the time drew on when men must ride to the alth and
notic wa given to eric brightey of mani suit that were laid against
him in that he had brought mord ospakar son to hi death deal
him a brain or a bodi or a marrow wound and other of that compani
but no suit were laid against skallagrim for he wa alreadi outlaw
therefor he must go in hide for men were out to slai him and thi
he did unwillingli at eric bid asmund took up eric case for
he wa the most famou of all lawmen in that dai and when thirteen full
week of summer were done thei two rode to the thing and with them a
great compani of men of their quarter
now men go up to the lgberg and there came ospakar though he wa
not yet heal of hi wound and all hi compani and laid their suit
against eric by the mouth of gizur the lawman ospakar son the
plead were long and cun on either side but the end of it wa
that ospakar brought it about by the help of hi friendsand of
these had manythat eric must go into outlawri for three year but no
weregild wa to be paid to ospakar and hi men for those who had been
kill and no aton for the great wound that skallagrim lambstail
gave him or for the death of mord hi son inasmuch as eric fought for
hi own hand to save hi life
the parti of ospakar were ill pleas at thi find and eric wa not
over glad for it wa littl to hi mind that he should sail awar
across the sea while gudruda sat at home in iceland still there wa
no help for the matter
now ospakar spoke with hi compani and the end of it wa that he call
on them to take their weapon and aveng themselv by their own
might asmund and eric see thi muster their armi of freemen and
thrall there were on hundr and five of them all stout men but
ospakar blacktooth band number a hundr and thirtythre and thei
stood with their back to the raven rift
now i would that skallagrim wa here to guard my back said eric for
befor thi fight is done few will left stand to tell it tale
it is a sad thing said asmund that so mani men must die becaus
some men ar now dead
a veri sad thing said eric and took thi counsel he stalk alon
toward the rank of ospakar and call in a loud voic sai
it would be grievou that so mani warrior should fall in such a
matter now hearken you compani of ospakar blacktooth if there be ani
two among you who will dare to match their might against my singl sword
in holmgang here i eric brightey stand and wait them it is better
that on man or perchanc three men should fall than that anon so
mani should roll in the dust what sai ye
now all those who watch call out that thi wa a good offer and a
manli on though it might turn out ill for eric but ospakar answer
were i but well of my wound i alon would cut that golden comb of
thine thou braggart as it is be sure that two shall be found
who is the braggart answer eric he who twice ha learn the
weight of thi arm and yet boast hi strength or i who stand crave
that two should come against me get thee henc ospakar get thee home
and bid thorunna thy leman whom thou didst beguil from that ounound
who now is name skallagrim lambstail the baresark nurs thee whole
of the wound her husband gave thee be sure we shall yet stand face to
face and that comb shall be cut then comb black or golden nurs
thee nurs thee ceas thy pratingget thee home and bid thorunna
nurs thee but first name thou the two who shall stand against me in
holmgang in oxar stream
folk laugh aloud while eric mock but ospakar gnash hi teeth with
rage still he name the two mightiest men in hi compani bid them
take up their sword against brightey thi inde thei were loth
to do still becaus of the shame that thei must get if thei hung
back and for fear of the wrath of ospakar thei made readi to obei hi
bid
then all men pass down to the bank of oxar and on the other side
peopl came from their booth and sat upon the slope of all man raft
for it wa a new thing that on man should fight two in holmgang
now eric cross to the island where holmgang ar fought to thi dai
and after him came the two chosen flourish their sword brave and
take counsel how on should rush at hi face while the other pass
behind hi back and spit him as woodfolk spit a lamb eric drew
whitefir and lean on it wait for the word and all the women held
him to be wondrou fair as clad in hi byrni and hi golden helm
he lean thu on whitefir present the word wa given and eric
stand not to defend himself as thei deem he sure would whirl
whitefir round hi helm and rush headlong on hi foe shield aloft
the great carl saw the light that plai on whitefir edg and the
other light that burn in eric ey and terror got hold of them now
he wa almost come and whitefir sprang aloft like a tongu of flame
then thei stai no more but run on thi wai and on that cast
themselv into the flood and swam for the riveredg now from either
bank rose up a roar of laughter that grew and grew till it echo
against the lava rift and scare the raven from their nest
eric too stop hi charg and laugh aloud then walk back to
where asmund stood unarm to second him in the holmgang
i can get littl honour from such champion as these he said
nai answer asmund thou hast got the greatest honour and thei
and ospakar such shame as mai not be wipe out
now when blacktooth saw what had come to pass he wellnigh choke
and fell from hi hors in furi still he could find no stomach for
fight but muster hi compani rode straightwai from the thing
home again to swinefel but he caus those two whom he had put up
to do battl with eric to be set upon with stave and driven from
hi follow and the end of it wa that thei might stai no more in
iceland but took ship and sail south and now thei ar out of the
stori
on the next dai asmund and with him eric and all their men rode back
to middalhof gudruda greet eric well and for the first time sinc
swanhild went awai she kiss him moreov she wept bitterli when she
learn that he must go into outlawri while she must bide at home
how shall the dai pass by eric she said when thou art far and i
know not where thou art nor how it goe with thee nor if thou livest
or art alreadi dead
in sooth i cannot sai sweet he answer but of thi i am sure
that wheresoev i am yet more weari shall be my hour
three year she went onthre long cold year and no sight of
thee and perchanc no tide from thee till mayhap i learn that thou
art in that land whenc tide cannot come oh it would be better to
die than to part thu
well i wot that it is better to die than to live and better never to
have been born than to live and die answer eric sadli here it
would seem is noth but hate and strife weari and bitter envi
to fret awai our strength and at last if we come so far sorrow ag
and death and thereaft we know not what littl of good do we find to
our hand and much of evil nor know i for what illdo these burden
ar laid upon us yet must we need breath such an air as is blown
about us gudruda clasp at thi happi which is given though we
mai not hold it at the worst the game will soon be plai and other
will stand where we have stood and strive as we have striven and fail
as we have fail and so on till man ha work out hi doom and the
god ceas from their wrath or ragnarrk come upon them and thei too
ar lost in the jaw of grei wolf fenrir
men mai win on good thing and that is fame eric
nai gudruda what is it to win fame is it not to rais up foe as it
were from the veri soil who made with secret hate seek to stab us
in the back is it not to lose peac and toil on from height to height
onli to be hurl down at last happi then is the man whom fame fli
from for her is a deadli gift
yet there is on thing left that thou hast not number eric and
it is lovefor love is to our life what the sun is to the world and
though it seem to set in death yet it mai rise again we ar happi
then in our love for there ar mani who live their live and do not
find it
so these two eric brightey and gudruda the fair talk sadli for
their heart were heavi and on them lai the shadow of sorrow that were
to come
sai sweet said eric at length wilt thou that i go not into
banish then i must fall into outlawri and my life will be in the
hand of him who mai take it yet i think that my foe will find it hard
to come by while my strength remain and at the worst i do but turn to
meet the fate that dog me
nai that i will not suffer brightey now we will go to my father
and he shall give thee hi dragon of warsh is a good vesseland thou
shalt man her with the briskest men of our quarter for there ar mani
who will be glad to fare abroad with thee eric soon she shall be bound
and thou shalt sail at onc eric for the sooner thou art gone the
sooner the three year will be sped and thou shalt come back to me
but oh that i might go with thee
now gudruda and eric went to asmund and spoke of thi matter
i desir he answer that thou eric shouldst bide here in
iceland till after harvest for it is then that i would take unna
thorod daughter to wife and it wa meet that thou shouldst sit at
the weddingfeast and give her to me
nai father let eric go said gudruda for well begun is sure
half done he must remain three year in outlawri add thou no dai to
them for if he stai here for long i know thi that i shall find no
heart to let him go and if go he must then i shall go with him
that mai never be said asmund thou art too young and fair to sail
avik down the seapath hearken eric i give thee the good ship
and now we will go about to find stout men to man her
that is a good gift said eric and afterward thei rode to the
seashor and overhaul the vessel as she lai in her shed she wa a
great dragon of war long and slender and stand high at stem and
prow she wa fashion of oak all bolt togeth with iron and at
her prow wa a gild dragon most wonderfulli carv
eric look on her and hi ey brighten
here rest a wavehors that shall bear a vike well he said
ay answer asmund of all the thing i own thi ship is the veri
best she is so swift that none mai catch her and she can almost go
about in her own length that gale must be heavi that shall fill her
with thee to steer yet i give her to thee freeli eric and thou shalt
do great deed with thi my gift and if thing go well she shall come
back to thi shore at last and thou in her
now i will name thi wargift with a new name said eric gudruda
i name her for as gudruda here is the fairest of all women so is thi
the fairest of all wardragon
so be it said asmund
then thei rode back to middalhof and now eric brightey let it be
known that he need men to sail the sea with him nor did he ask in
vain for when it wa told that eric went avik so great wa hi
fame grown that mani a stout yeoman and mani a greatlimb carl
reach down sword and shield and came up to middalhof to put their
hand in hi for mate he took a certain man name hall of lithdal
and thi becaus bjrn ask it for hall wa a friend to bjrn and he
had moreov great skill in all manner of seamanship and had often
sail the northern seasai and round england to the coast of franc
but when gudruda saw thi man she did not like him becaus of hi
sharp face uncanni ey and smooth tongu and she prai eric to have
noth to do with him
it is too late now to talk of that said eric hall is a wellskil
man and for the rest fear not i will watch him
then evil will come of it said gudruda
skallagrim also like hall littl nor did hall love skallagrim and hi
great ax
at length all were gather thei were fifti in number and it is said
that no such band of men ever took ship from iceland
now the great dragon wa bound and her fare good were aboard of her
for eric must sail on the morrow if the wind should be fair all dai
long he stalk to and fro among hi men he would trust noth to
other and there wa no sword or shield in hi compani but he himself
had prove it all dai long he stalk and at hi back went skallagrim
lambstail ax on shoulder for he would never leav eric if he had hi
will and thei were a mighti pair
at length all wa readi and men sat down to the faringfeast in the hall
at middalhof and that wa a great feast eric folk were gather on
the sidebench and by the high seat at asmund side sat brightey
and near to him where bjrn asmund son gudruda unna asmund
betroth and saevuna eric mother for thi had been settl between
asmund and eric that hi mother saevuna who wa some somewhat sunk in
ag should flit from coldback and come with unna to dwell at middalhof
but eric set a trusti griev to dwell at coldback and mind the farm
when the faringtoast had been drunk eric spoke to asmund and said i
fear on thing lord and it is that when i am gone ospakar will troubl
thee now i prai you all to bewar of blacktooth for though the hound
is whip he can still bite and it seem that he ha not yet put
gudruda from hi mind
now bjrn had sat silent think much and drink more for he
love eric less than ever on thi dai when he saw how all men did him
honour and mourn hi go and hi father not the least of them
methink it is thou eric he said whom ospakar hate and thee on
whom he would work hi vengeanc and that for no light caus
when bad fortun sit in thy neighbour hous she knock upon thy
door bjrn gudruda thy sister is my betroth and thou art a parti
to thi feud said eric therefor it becom thee better to hold her
honour and thy own against thi northland than to gird at me for that
in which i have no blame
bjrn grew wroth at these word prate not to me he said thou art
an upstart who wouldst teach their duti to thy bettersai puf up
with lightwon fame like a feather on the breez but i sai thi the
breez shall fail and thou shalt fall upon the goos back onc more
and i sai thi also that had i my will gudruda should wed ospakar
for he is a mighti chief and not a longleg carl outlaw for
manslai
now eric sprang from hi seat and laid hand upon the hilt of whitefir
while men murmur in the hall for thei held thi an ill speech of
bjrn
in thee it seem i have no friend said eric and hadst thou been
ani other man than gudruda brother forsooth thou shouldst answer for
thy mock word thi i tell thee bjrn that wert thou twice her
brother if thou plottest with ospakar when i am gone thou shalt pai
dearli for it when i come back again i know thy heart well it is
cun and greedi of gain and fill with envi as a cask with al
yet if thou lovest to feel it beat in thy breast strive not to work
me mischief and to put gudruda from me
now bjrn sprang up also and drew hi sword for he wa white with rage
but asmund hi father cri peac in a great voic
peac he said be seat eric and take no heed of thi foolish
talk and for thee bjrn art thou the priest of middalhof and
gudruda father or am i it ha pleas me to betroth brightey to
gudruda and it pleas me not to betroth her to ospakar and that is
enough for thee for the rest ospakar would have slain eric not he
ospakar therefor eric hand ar clean though thou art my son i sai
thi that if thou workest ill to eric when he is over sea thou shalt
rightli learn the weight of whitefir it is a nidder deed to plot
against an absent man
eric sat down but bjrn strode scowl from the hall and take
hors rode south nor did he and eric meet again till three year had
come and gone and then thei met but onc
maggot shall be bred of that fly nor shall thei lack flesh to feed
on said skallagrim in eric ear as he watch bjrn pass but eric
bade him be silent and turn to gudruda
look not so sad sweet he said for hasti word rise like the foam
on mead and pass as soon it vex bjrn that thy father ha given me
the good ship but hi anger will soon pass or at the veri worst i
fear him not while thou art true to me
then thou hast littl to fear eric she answer look now on thy
hair it grow long as a woman and that is ill for at sea the salt
will hang to it sai shall i cut it for thee
ye gudruda
so she cut hi yellow lock and on of them lai upon her heart for mani
a dai
now thou shalt swear to me she whisper in hi ear that no other
man or woman shall cut thy hair till thou comest back to me and i clip
it again
that i swear and readili he answer i will go longhair like a
girl for thy sake gudruda
he spoke low but koll the halfwit groa thrall heard thi oath
and kept it in hi mind
veri earli on the morrow all men rose and take hors rode onc more
to the seasid till thei came to that shed where the gudruda lai
then when the tide wa high eric compani took hold of the black
ship thwart and at hi word drag her with might and main she
ran down the greas block and sped on quiver to the sea and as her
dragonprow dip in the water peopl cheer aloud
now eric must bid farewel to all and thi he did with a brave heart
till at the last he came to saevuna hi mother and gudruda hi dear
love
farewel son said the old dame i have littl hope that these ey
shall look again upon that bonni face of thine yet i am well paid for
my birthpain for few have born such a man as thou think of me at
time for without me thou hadst never been be not led astrai of women
nor lead them astrai or ill shall overtak thee be not quarrelsom
becaus of thy great might for there is a stronger than the strongest
spare a fallen foe and take not a poor man good or a brave man
sword but when thou smitest smite home so shalt thou win honour
and at the last peac that is more than honour
eric thank her for her counsel and kiss her then turn to
gudruda who stood white and still pluck at her golden girdl
what can i sai to thee he ask
sai noth but go she answer go befor i weep
weep not gudruda or thou wilt unman me sai thou wilt think on me
ay eric by dai and by night
and thou wilt be true to me
ay till death and after for so long as thou cleavest to me i will
cleav to thee i will first die rather than betrai thee but of thee i
am not so sure perchanc thou mayest find swanhild in thy journei
and crave more kiss of her
anger me not gudruda thou knowest well that i hate swanhild more than
ani other woman when i kiss her again then thou mayst wed ospakar
speak not so rashli eric she said and as she spoke skallagrim drew
near
if thou lingerest here lord the tide will serv us littl round
westman he said ey gudruda as it were with jealousi
i come said eric gudruda fare thee well
she kiss him and clung to him but did not answer for she could not
speak
xiii
how hall the mate cut the grapnel chain
gudruda bent her head like a droop flower and present sank to
earth for her knee would bear her weight no more but eric march to
the lip of the sea hi head held high and laugh merrili to hide hi
pain of heart here stood asmund who grip him by both hand and
kiss him on the brow bid him good luck
i know not whether we shall meet again he said but if my hour
be sped befor thou returnest thi i charg thee that thou mindest
gudruda well for she is the sweetest of all women that i have known
and i hold her the most dear
fear not for that lord said eric and i prai thee thi that if
i come back no more as well mai happen do not forc gudruda into
marriag if she will it not and i think she will have littl lean
that wai and i sai thi also do not count overmuch on bjrn thy son

for she love not that unna should take her place and more and now i
thank thee for mani good thing and farewel

to me
eric turn to enter the sea and wade to the vessel but skallagrim
caught him in hi arm as though he were but a child and wade into
the surf till the water cover hi waistbelt bore him to the vessel
and lift him up so that eric reach the bulwark with hi hand
then thei loos the cabl and got out the oar and soon were danc
over the sea present the breez caught them and thei set the great
sail and sped awai like a gull toward the westman isl but gudruda
sat on the shore watch till at length the light fade from eric
golden helm as he stood upon the poop and the world grew dark to her
now ospakar blacktooth had new of thi sail and took counsel of
gizur hi son and the end of it wa that thei made readi two great
ship dragon of war and place sixti fight men in each of them
sail round the iceland coast to the westman and wait there to
waylai eric thei had spi on the land and from them thei learn of
brightey come and sail out to meet him in the channel between

gudruda came near to the mouth of the channel that had high cliff on
either hand eric saw two long dragon of warfor their bulwark were
shieldhungglid from the cover of the island and take their station
side by side between him and the open sea
now here ar vike said eric to skallagrim

thingvalla eric ospakar two chosen champion stood befor thee
yet at whitefir flash thei skurri through the water like startl
duck it wa an omen for so shall hi great ship fly when we swoop on
them then the other shout
ay ay never let it be said that we fled from ospakarfi on thy
woman talk hall
then we ar all of on mind save hall onli said eric let us put
ospakar to the proof and while men shout yea he turn to speak
with skallagrim the baresark wa gone for wast no breath in word
alreadi he wa fix the long shield on the bulwark rail
the men busk on their har and made them fit for fight and when
all wa readi eric mount the poop and with him skallagrim and bade
the rower give wai the gudruda leapt forward and rush on toward
ospakar ship now thei saw that these were bound togeth with a
cabl and yet thei must go betwixt them
eric ran forward to the prow and with him skallagrim and call aloud
to a great man who stood upon the ship to starboard wear a black
helm with raven wing
who art thou that bar the sea against me
i am name ospakar blacktooth answer the great man
and what must we lose at thy hand ospakar
but on thingyour live answer blacktooth
thrice have we stood face to face ospakar said eric and it seem
that hitherto thou hast won no great glori now it shall be prove if
thy luck ha better
art yet heal lord of that prick in the shoulder which thou camest
by on horsehead height roar skallagrim
for answer ospakar seiz a spear and hurl it straight at eric and
it had been hi death had he not caught it in hi hand as it flew then
he cast it back and that so mightili that it sped right through the
shield of ospakar and wa the bane of a man who stood besid him
a gift for a gift laugh eric on rush the gudruda but now the
cabl wa strain six fathom from her bow that held togeth the ship
of ospakar and it wa too strong for break eric look and saw then
he drew whitefir and while all men wonder leap over the prow of
the ship and clasp the golden dragon head with hi arm set hi
feet upon it claw and wait on sped the ship and spear flew thick
and fast about him but there brightey hung now the gudruda bow
caught the great rope and strain it taut and as it rose beneath her
weight eric smote swift and strong with whitefir and clove it in two
so that the sever end fell with a splash into the quiet water
eric sprang back to deck while stone and spear hiss about him
that wa well done lord said skallagrim now we shall be snugli
berth
in oar and out grapplingiron shout eric
up rose the rower and their wargear rattl as thei rose thei drew
in the long oar and not befor it wa time for now the gudruda forc
her wai between the two dragon of ospakar and lai with her bow to their
stern then with a shout eric men cast the iron and soon the ship
were lock fast and the fight began the spear flew thick and on
either side some got their death befor them then the men of that
vessel name the raven which wa to larboard of the gudruda made
readi to board on thei came with a rush and were driven back though
hardli for thei were mani and those who stood against them few again
thei came scrambl over the bulwark and thi time a score of them
leapt aboard eric turn from the fight against the dragon of ospakar
and saw it then with skallagrim he rush to meet the boarder as
thei swarm along the hold and naught might thei withstand the ax and
sword
through and through them swept the mighti pair now whitefir flash
and now the great ax fell and at everi stroke a man lai dead
or wound six of the boarder turn to fly but just then the
grapplingiron broke and their ship drift out with the tide toward
the open sea and present no man of that twenti wa left aliv
now the men of the ship of ospakar and of the gudruda press each other
hard thrice did ospakar strive to come aboard and thrice he wa push
back eric wa ever where he wa most need and with him skallagrim
for these two threw themselv from side to side and were now here and
now there so that it seem as though there were not on golden helm
and on black but rather four on board the gudruda
eric look and saw that the other ship wa draw round though
somewhat slowli to come alongsid of them onc more
now we must make an end of ospakar els our hand will be overful
he said and therewith sprang up upon the bulwark and after him mani
men onc thei were driven back but came on again and now thei thrust
all ospakar men befor them and pass up hi ship on both board by
the mast stood ospakar and with him gizur hi son and eric strove to
come to him but mani men were between them and he could not do thi
present while the fight yet went on hotli and men fell fast
brightey felt the dragon of ospakar strike and look saw that
thei had drift with the send of the tide on to the rock of the
island there wa a great hole in the hull amidship and the water
rush in fast
back men back he cri and all hi folk that were unhurt ran and
leapt on board the gudruda but ospakar and hi men sprang into the sea
and swam for the shore then skallagrim cut loos the grapplingiron
with hi ax and that not too soon for scarc had thei push
clear with great toil when the long warship slip from the rock and
founder take mani dead and wound men with her
now ospakar and some of hi peopl stood safe upon the rock and eric
call to him in mockeri bid him come aboard the gudruda
ospakar made no answer but stood gnaw hi hand while the water ran
from him onli gizur hi son curs them aloud
eric wa greatli mind to follow them and land and fight them there
but he might not do thi becaus of the rock and of the other dragon
that hung about them fear to come on and yet not will to go back
we will have her at the least said eric and bade the rower get out
their oar
now when the men on board the other ship saw the gudruda draw on
thei took to their oar at onc and row swiftli for the sea and at
thi a great roar of laughter went down eric ship
thei shall not slip from us so easili said eric give wai comrad
and after them
but the men were much weari with fight and the deck were all
cumber with dead and wound so that by the time that the gudruda had
put about and come to the mouth of the waterwai ospakar vessel
had shaken out her sail and caught the wind that now blew strong off
shore and sped awai six furlong or more from eric prow
now we shall see how the gudruda sail said eric and thei spread
their canva and gave chase
then eric bade men clear the deck of the dead and tend the wound he
had lost seven men slain outright and three were wound on to death
but on board the ship there lai of ospakar forc twenti and three dead
men
when all were cast into the sea men at and rest
we have not done so badli said eric to skallagrim
we shall do better yet said skallagrim to eric rather had i seen
ospakar head ly in the scupper than those of all hi carl for
he mai get more men but never anoth head
now the wind freshen till by midnight it blew strongli the mate hall
came to eric and said
the gudruda dip her nose deep in ran cup sai eric shall we
shorten sail
nai answer eric keep her full and bail where yonder raven fli
my seastag must follow and he point to the warship that rode the
wave befor them
after midnight cloud came up with rain and hid the face of the
nightsun and the ship thei sought the wind blew ever harder till at
length when the rain had pass and the cloud lift there wa much
water in the hold and the bailer could hardli stand at their work
men murmur and hall the mate murmur most of all but still eric
held on for there not two furlong ahead of them rode the dragon of
ospakar but now be afraid of the wind and sea she had lower
her sail somewhat and made as though she would put about and run for
iceland
that she mai not do call eric to skallagrim if onc she roll
side on to those sea ran ha her for she must fill and sink
so thei hold lord answer skallagrim see onc more she run
ay but we run fastersh is outsail up men up for present the
fight begin
it is bad to join battl in such a sea quoth hall
good or bad growl skallagrim do thou thy lord bid and he
half lift up hi ax
the mate said no more for he misdoubt him of skallagrim lambstail and
hi ax
then men made readi for the frai as best thei might and stood sword in
hand and drench with foam cling to the bulwark of the gudruda as
she wallow through the sea
eric went aft to the helm and seiz it now but a length ahead
ospakar ship labour on beneath her small sail but the gudruda
rush toward her with all canva set and at everi leap plung her
golden dragon beneath the surf and shook the water from her foredeck
make readi the grapnel shout eric through the storm skallagrim
seiz the iron and stood by now the gudruda rush alongsid the
raven and eric steer so skilfulli that there wa a fathom space and
no more between the ship
skallagrim cast the iron well and truli so that it hook and held on
sped the gudruda and the cabl tautenednow her stern kiss the bow of
ospakar ship as though she wa tow her and thu for a space thei
travel through the sea
eric folk shout and strove to cast spear but thei did thi but
ill becaus of the rock of the vessel as for ospakar men thei
clung to their bulwark and did noth for all the heart wa out of
them between fear of eric and terror of the sea eric call to a man to
hold the helm and skallagrim crept aft to where he stood
what counsel shall we take now said eric and as he spoke a sea broke
over themfor the gale wa strong
board them and make an end answer skallagrim
rough work still we will try it said eric for we mai not lie thu
for long and i am loath to leav them
then eric call for men to follow him and mani answer creep as
best thei might to where he stood
thou art mad eric said hall the mate cut loos and let us drive
els we shall both founder and that is a poor tale to tell
eric took no heed but watch hi chanc leapt on to the bow of the
raven and after him leapt skallagrim even as he did so a great sea
came and swept past and over them so that half the ship wa hid for
foam now hall the mate stood near to the grapnel cabl and fear
lest thei should sink out of the cowardic of hi heart he let hi
ax fall upon the chain and sever it so swiftli that no man saw
him except skallagrim onli forward sprang the gudruda freed from her
burden and rush awai befor the wind leav eric and skallagrim
alon upon the raven prow
now we ar in an evil plight said eric the cabl ha part
ay answer skallagrim and that losel hall hath part it i saw
hi ax fall
xiv
how eric dream a dream
now when the men of ospakar who were gather on the poop of the
raven saw what had come about thei shout aloud and made readi to
slai the pair but eric and skallagrim clamber to the mast and got
their back against it and swiftli made themselv fast with a rope so
that thei might not fall with the roll of the ship then the peopl
of ospakar came on to cut them down
but thi wa no easi task for thei might scarc stand and thei could
not shoot with the bow moreov eric and skallagrim be bound
to the mast had the us of both hand and were mind to die hard
therefor ospakar folk got but on thing by their onslaught and
that wa death for three of their number fell beneath the long sweep
of whitefir and on bow befor the ax of skallagrim then thei drew
back and strove to throw spear at these two but thei flew wide becaus
of the roll of the vessel on spear struck the mast near the head of
skallagrim he drew it out and wait till the ship steadi herself
in the trough of the sea hurl it at a knot of ospakar thrall and
a man got hi death from it after that thei threw no more spear
thenc onc more the crew came on with sword and ax but
faintheartedli and the end of it wa that thei lost some more men dead
and wound and fell back again
skallagrim mock at them with bitter word and on of them made mad
by hi scof cast a heavi ballastston at him it fell upon hi
shoulder and numb him
now i am unmeet for fight lord said skallagrim for my right arm is
dead and i can scarc hold my ax
that is ill then said eric for we have littl help except from
each other and i too am wellnigh spent well we have done a great
deed and now it is time to rest
my left arm is yet whole lord and i can make shift for a while with
it cut loos the cord befor thei bait us to death and let us rush
upon these wolv and fall fight
a good counsel said eric and a quick end but stai a while what
plan have thei now
now the men of ospakar have littl heart left in them for such work
as thi had taken thought togeth
we have got great hurt and littl honour said the mate there ar
but nineteen of us left aliv and that is scarc enough to work the
ship and it seem that we shall be fewer befor eric brightey and
skallagrim lambstail lie quiet by yonder mast thei ar mighti men
inde and it would be better methink to deal with them by craft
rather than by forc
the sailor said that thi wa a good word for thei were weari of the
sight of whitefir as he flame on high and the sound of the ax of
skallagrim as it crash through helm and byrni and as fear crept in
valour fled out
thi is my rede then said the mate that we go to them and give
them peac and lai them in bond swear that we will put them ashor
when we ar come back to iceland but when we have them fast as thei
sleep at night we will creep on them and hurl them into the sea and
afterward we will sai that we slew them fight
a shame deed said a man
then go thou up against them answer the mate if we slai them
not then shall thi tale be told against us throughout iceland that a
ship compani were worst by two men and we mai not live beneath that
dishonour
the man held hi peac and the mate lai down hi arm crept
forward alon toward the mast just as eric and skallagrim were about
to cut themselv loos and rush on them
what wouldest thou shout eric ha it gone so well with you with
arm that ye ar mind to come up against us bear none
it ha gone ill eric said the mate for ye twain ar too mighti for
us we have lost mani men and we shall lose more er ye ar laid low
therefor we make you thi offer that you lai down your weapon and
suffer yourselv to be bound till such time as we touch land where we
will set you ashor and give you your arm again meanwhil we will
deal with you in friendli fashion give you of the best we have nor
will we set foot ani suit against you for those of our number whom ye
two have slain
wherefor then should we be bound said eric
for thi reason onli that we dare not leav you free within our ship
now choos and if ye will take peac which we swear by all the god
we will keep toward you and if ye will not then we will bear you
down with beam and sail and stone and slai you
what thinkest thou skallagrim said eric beneath hi breath
i think that i find littl faith in yon carl face answer
skallagrim still i am unfit to fight and thy strength is spent so
it seem that we must lie low if we would rise again thei can scarc
be so base as to do murder have handsel peac to us
i am not so sure of that said eric still starv beggar must eat
bone hearken thou we take the term trust to your honour and i
sai thi that ye shall get shame and death if ye depart from them to
harm us
have no fear lord said the mate we ar true men
that we shall look to your deed to learn said eric lai down hi
sword and shield
skallagrim did likewis though with no good grace then men came with
strong cord and bound them fast hand and foot handl them fearsom
as men handl a live bear in a net then thei led them forward to the
prow
as thei went eric look up yonder twenti furlong and more awai
sail the gudruda
thi is good fellowship said skallagrim thu to leav us in the
trap
nai answer eric thei cannot put about in such a sea and
doubtless also thei think us dead nevertheless if ever it come about
that hall and i stand face to face again there will be need for me to
think of gentl
i shall think littl thereon growl skallagrim
now thei were come to the prow and there wa a half deck under which
thei were set out of reach of the wind and water in the deck wa a
stout iron ring and the men made them fast with rope to it so that
thei might move but littl and thei set their helm and weapon behind
them in such fashion that thei could not come at them then thei flung
cloak about them and brought them food and drink of which thei stood
much in need and treat them well in everi wai but for all thi
skallagrim trust them no more
we ar newhook lord he said and thei give us line present
thei will haul us in
evil come soon enough answer eric no need to run to greet
it and he fell to think of gudruda and of the dai deed till
present he drop asleep for he wa veri weari
now it chanc that as eric slept he dream a dream so strong and
strang that it seem to live within him he dream that he slept
there beneath the raven deck and that a rat came and whisper spell
into hi ear then he dream that swanhild glide toward him walk
on the stormi sea he saw her afar and she came swiftli and ever the
sea grew smooth befor her feet nor did the wind so much as stir her
hair present she stood by him in the ship and bend over him
touch him on the shoulder sai
awak eric brightey awak awak
it seem to him that he awok and said what tide swanhild and
that she answer
ill tide ericso ill that i am come hither from straumei to
tell of themai come walk on the sea had gudruda done so much
thinkest thou
stroma the southernmost of the orknei
gudruda is no witch he said in hi dream
nai but i am a witch and it is well for thee eric ay i am a witch
now do i seem to sleep at atli side and lo here i stand by thine
and i must journei back again mani a leagu befor anoth dai be
bornai mani a leagu and all for love of thee eric hearken for
not long mai the spell endur i have seen thi by my magic that these
men who bound thee come even now to take thee sleep and cast thee
and thy thrall into the deep there to drown
if it is fate it will befal he said in hi dream
nai it shall not befal put forth all thy might and burst thy bond
then fetch whitefir cut awai the bond of skallagrim and give him hi
ax and shield thi done cover yourselv with your cloak and wait
till ye hear the murder come then rise and rush upon them the two
of you and thei shall melt befor your might i have journei over the
great deep to tell thee thi eric had gudruda done as much thinkest
thou
and it seem to him that the wraith of swanhild kiss him on the brow
sigh and vanish bear the rat in her bosom
eric awok suddenli just as though he had never slept and look
around he knew by the low of the sun that it wa far into the
night and that he had slept for mani hour thei were alon beneath
the deck and far aft beyond the mast as the vessel rose upon the
wavesfor the sea wa still rough though the wind had fallener
saw the mate of the raven talk earnestli with some men of hi crew
skallagrim snore besid him
awak eric said in hi ear awak and listen
he yawn and rous himself what now lord he said
thi said eric and he told him the dream that he had dream
that wa a fei dream said skallagrim and now we must do as the
wraith bade thee
easi to sai but hard to do quoth eric thi is a great rope that
hold us and a strong
ye it is great and strong still we must burst it
now eric and skallagrim were made fast in thi fashion their hand were
bound behind them and their leg were lash abov the feet and abov
the knee moreov a thick cord wa fix about the waist of each and
thi cord wa pass through the iron ring and knot there but it
chanc that beneath the hollow of their knee ran an oaken beam which
held the forepart of the dragon togeth
we mai try thi said eric to set our feet against the beam and
strain with all our strength upon the rope though i think that no two
men can part it
we shall know that present said skallagrim gather up hi leg
then thei set their feet against the beam and pull till it groan
but though the rope gave somewhat it would not break thei rest a
while then strain again till the sweat burst out upon them and the
rope cut into their flesh but still it would not part
we have found our match said eric
that is not altogeth prove yet answer the baresark mani a
shield is riven at the third stroke
so onc again thei set their feet against the beam and put out all
their strength
the ring bend gasp eric now when the roll of the ship throw
our weight to leeward in the name of thor pull
thei wait then put out their might and lo though the rope did not
break the iron ring burst asund and thei roll upon the deck
well pull truli said skallagrim as he struggl to hi haunch
i am mark about the middl with ropetwist for mani a dai to come
that i will swear what next lord
whitefir answer eric
now their arm were pile a fathom or more from where thei sat and
right in the prow of the ship hither then thei must crawl upon their
knee and thi wa weari work for ever as the ship roll thei fell
and could in no wise save themselv from hurt eric wa bleed at the
brow and bloodi wa the hook nose of skallagrim befor thei came to
where whitefir wa at length thei reach the sword and push asid
the buckler that were over it with their head the great warblad wa
sheath and eric must need lie upon hi breast and draw the weapon
somewhat with hi teeth
thi is an ill razor to shave with he said rise for the keen
blade had cut hi chin
so some have thought and perchanc more shall think answer
skallagrim now set the rope on the edg and rub
thi thei did and present the thick cord that bound them wa in two
then eric knelt upon the deck and press the bond that bound hi leg
upon the blade and after him skallagrim thei were free now except for
their hand and it wa no easi thing to cut awai the bond upon their
wrist it wa done thu skallagrim sat upon the deck and eric push
the sword between hi finger with hi feet then the baresark rose
hold the sword and eric turn back to back with him fret the
cord upon hi wrist against the blade twice he cut himself but the
third time the cord part and he wa free he stretch hi arm
for thei were stiff then took whitefir and cut awai the bond of
skallagrim
how goe it with that hurt of thine he ask
better than i had thought answer skallagrim the sore ha come
out with the bruis
that is good new said eric for methink unless swanhild walk
the sea for noth thou wilt soon need thine arm
thei have never fail me yet said skallagrim and took hi ax and
shield what counsel now
thi skallagrim that we lie down as we were and put the cloak about
us as though we were yet in bond then if these knave come we can
take them unawar as thei think to take us
so thei went again to where thei had been bound and lai down upon their
shield and weapon draw cloak over them scarc had thei done
thi and rest a while when thei saw the mate and all the crew come
along both board toward them thei bore no weapon in their hand
none too soon did swanhild walk said eric now we shall learn their
purpos be thou readi to leap forth when i give the word
ay lord answer skallagrim as he work hi stiff arm to and fro
in such matter few have thought me backward
what new friend cri eric as the men drew near
bad new for thee brightey answer the mate and that baresark
thrall of thine for we must loos your band
that is good new then said eric for our limb ar numb and dead
becaus of the nip of the cord is land in sight
nai nor will be for thee eric
how now friend how now sure have handsel peac to us ye mean
no harm toward two unarm men
we swore to do you no harm nor will we eric thi onli will we do
deliv you bound to ran and leav her to deal with you as she mai
bethink you sir said eric thi is a cruel deed and most unmanli
we yield to you in faithwil ye break your troth
war ha no troth he answer ye ar too great to let slip between
our finger shall it be said of us that two men overcam us all
mayhap murmur skallagrim beneath hi breath
oh sir i beseech you said eric i am young and there is a maid
who wait me out in iceland and it is hard to die and he made as
though he wept while skallagrim laugh within hi sleev for it wa
strang to see eric feign fear
but the men mock aloud
thi is the great man thei cri thi is that eric of whose deed
folk sing look he weep like a child when he see the water drag him
forth and awai with him into the sea
littl need for that cri eric and lo the cloak about him and
skallagrim flew asid out thei came with a roar thei came out as
a shebear from her cave and high abov brightey golden curl
whitefir shone in the pale light and nigh to it shone the ax of
skallagrim whitefir flare aloft then down he fell and sought the
fals heart of the mate the great ax of skallagrim shone and wa lost
in the breast of the carl who stood befor him
troll shriek on here ar troll and turn to fly but again
whitefir wa up and that man flew not faron pace and no more then
thei fled scream and after them came ax and sword thei fled thei
fell thei leap into the sea till none were left to fall and leap
for thei had no time or heart to find or draw their weapon and
present eric brightey and skallagrim lambstail stood alon upon the
deckalon with the dead
swanhild is a wise witch gasp eric and whatev ill she ha
done i will rememb thi to her honour
littl good come of witchcraft answer skallagrim wipe hi brow
todai it work for our hand tomorrow it shall work against them
to the helm said eric the ship yaw and come side on to the sea
skallagrim sprang to the tiller and put hi strength on it and but just
in time for on big sea came aboard them and left much water in the
hold
we ow thi to thy baresark wai said eric hadst thou not slain the
steersman we had not fill with water
true lord answer skallagrim but when onc my ax is aloft it
seem to fly of itself till noth is left befor it what cours
now
the same on which the gudruda wa laid perhap if we mai endur till
we come to the farei isl we shall find her in harbour there
the faro
there is not much chanc of that said skallagrim still the wind is
fair and we fly fast befor it
then thei lash the tiller and set to bail thei bail long and it
wa heavi work but thei rid the ship of much water after that thei at
food for it wa now morn and it came on to blow yet more strongli
for three dai and three night it blew thu and the raven sped along
befor the gale all thi time turn and turn about eric and skallagrim
stood at the helm and tend the sail thei had littl time to eat and
none to sleep thei were so hard press also and must harbour their
strength so close that the bodi of the dead men yet cumber the
hold thu thei grew veri weari and like to fall from faint but
still thei held the raven on her cours in the begin of the fourth
night a great sea struck the good ship so that she quiver from stem to
stern
methink i hear water bubbl up said skallagrim in a hoars voic
eric climb down into the well and lift the bottom plank and
there beneath them wa a leak through which the water spout in a thin
stream he stop up the rent as best he might with garment from the
dead men and place ballast stone upon them then clamber on to the
deck again
our hour ar short now he said the water rush in apac
well it is time to rest said skallagrim but see lord and he
point ahead what land is that
it must be the farei answer eric now if we can but keep afloat
for three hour more we mai yet die ashor
after thi the wind began to fall but still there wa enough to drive
the raven on swiftli
and ever the water gain in the hold
now thei were not far from land for ahead of them the bleak hill
tower up shine in the faint midnight light and between the hill
wa a cleft that seem to be a fjord anoth hour pass and thei
were no more than ten furlong from the mouth of the fjord when
suddenli the wind fell and thei were in calm water under shelter of the
land thei went amidship and look the hold wa half full of water
and in it float the bodi of ospakar men
she ha not long to live said skallagrim but we mai still be save
if the boat is not broken
now aft near the tiller a small boat wa bound on the half deck of the
raven thei went to it and look it wa whole with oar lash in
it but half full of water which thei must bail out thi thei did as
swiftli as thei might then thei cut the littl boat loos and have
made it fast with a rope lift it over the siderail and let it fall
into the sea and that wa no great wai for the raven had sunk deep
it fell on an even keel and eric let himself down the rope into it and
call to skallagrim to follow
bide a while lord he answer there is that which i would bring
with me
for a space eric wait and then call aloud swift thou fool swift
the ship sink
and as he call skallagrim came and hi arm were full of sword and
byrni and red ring of gold that he had found time to gather from the
dead and out of the cabin
throw all asid and come said eric lai on to the oar for the
raven wallow befor she sank
there is yet time lord and the gear is good answer skallagrim
and on by on he threw piec down into the boat as the last fell the
raven sank to her bulwark then skallagrim step from the sink
deck into the boat and cut the cord not too soon
eric gave wai with all hi strength and as he pull when he wa no
more than five fathom from her the raven vanish with a huge swirl
hold still he said or we shall follow
round spun the boat in the eddi she wa suck down till the water
trickl over her gunwal and for a moment thei knew not if thei were
lost or save eric held hi breath and watch then slowli the boat
lift her nose and thei were safe from the whirlpool of the lost
dragon
greed is mani a man bane said eric and it wa nearli thine and
mine skallagrim
i had no heart to leav the good gear he answer and thou seest
lord it is safe and we with it
then thei got the boat head round slowli into the mouth of the fjord
paus now and again to rest for their strength wa spent for two
hour thei row down a gulf as it were and on either side of them
were barren hill at length the waterwai open out into a great
basin and there on the further side of the basin thei saw green
slope run down to the water edg strewn with white stockfish
set to dry in the wind and sun and abov the slope a larg hall and

how eric dwelt in london town
men stood astonish but hall the mate slunk back
hold comrad said eric i have someth to sai that song cannot
carri hearken my shieldmat we swore to be true to each other
even to death is it not so what then shall be said of that man who cut
loos the gudruda and left us two to die at the foeman hand
who wa the man ask a voic
that man wa hall of lithdal said eric
it is fals said hall gather up hi courag the cabl part
beneath the strain of the ship and afterward we could not put about
becaus of the great sea
thou art fals roar skallagrim with my ey i saw thee let thine
ax fall upon the cabl liar art thou and dastard thou art jealou
also of brightey thy lord and thi wa in thy mind to let him die
upon the raven and then to bind hi shoe upon thy cowardli feet though
none els saw i saw and i sai thi that if i mai have my will i will
string thee live to the prow in that same cabl till gull tear out
thy foxheart
now hall grew veri white and hi knee trembl beneath him it is
true he said that i cut the chain but not from ani thought of evil
had i not cut it the vessel must have sunk and all been lost
did we not swear hall said eric sternli togeth to fight and
togeth to falltogeth to fare and if need be togeth to ceas
from fare and dost thou read the oath thu sai mate what
reward shall be paid to thi man for hi good fellowship to us and hi
tender for your live
as with on voic the men answer death
thou hearest hall said eric yet i would deal more gentli with on
to whom i swore fellowship so late get thee gone from our compani
and let us see thy cur face no more get thee gone i sai befor i
repent of my merci
then amidst a loud hoot hall took hi weapon and without a word
slunk into the boat of the raven that lai astern and row ashor nor
did eric see hi face for mani month
thou hast done foolishli lord to let that weasel go said
skallagrim for he will live to nip thy hand
for good or evil he is gone said eric and now i am worn out and
desir to sleep
after thi eric and skallagrim rest three full dai and thei were so
weari that thei were awak for littl of thi time but on the third dai
thei rose up strong and well except for their hurt and sore then
thei told the men of that which had come to pass and all wonder at
their might and hardihood to them inde eric seem as a god for few
such deed as hi had been told of sinc the godkind were on earth
but brightey thought littl of hi deed and much of gudruda at
time also he thought of swanhild and of that witchdream she sent him
for it wa wonder to him that she should have save him thu from
ran net
eric wa heartili welcom by the earl of the farei isl for when he
heard hi deed he made a feast in hi honour and set him in the high
seat it wa a great feast but skallagrim becam drunk at it and ran
down the chamber ax aloft roar for hall of lithdal
thi anger eric much and he would scarc speak to skallagrim for
mani dai though the great baresark slunk about after him like hi
shadow or a whip hound at it master heel and at length humbl
hi pride so far as to ask pardon for hi fault
i grant it for thy deed sake said eric shortli but thi is upon
my mind that thou wilt err thu again and it shall be my caus of
deathai and that of mani more
first mai my bone be white said skallagrim
thei shall be white thereaft answer eric
at farei eric ship twelv good men and true to take the seat of
those who had been slain by ospakar folk afterward when the wound
were well of their hurt except on man who di and the gudruda wa
made fit to take the sea again brightey bade farewel to the earl of
those isl who gave him a good cloak and a gold ring at part and
sail awai
now it were too long to tell of all the deed that eric and hi men
did never so scald sing wa there a vike like him for strength
and skill and hardihood and in those dai no such wardragon as the
gudruda had been known upon the sea wherev eric join battl and
that wa in mani place he conquer for none prevail against him
till at last foe would fly befor the terror of hi name and earl and
king would send from far crave the aid of hi hand withal he wa
the best and gentlest of men it is said of eric that in all hi dai he
did no base deed nor hurt the weak nor refus peac to him who prai
it nor lift sword against prison or wound foe from trader
he would take a toll of their merchandis onli and let them go and
whatev gain he won he would share equal ask no larger part than
the meanest of hi band all men love eric and even hi foe gave him
honour and spoke well of him now that hall of lithdal wa gone there
wa no man among hi mate who would not have pass to death for him
for thei held him dearer than their live women too love him much
but hi heart wa set upon gudruda and he seldom turn to look on
them
the first summer of hi outlawri eric war along the coast of ireland
but in the winter he came to dublin and for a while serv in the
bodyguard of the king of that town who held him in honour and would
have had him stai there but eric would not bide there and next spring
the gudruda be readi for sea he sail for the shore of england
there he gave battl to two vike ship of war and took them after
a hard fight it wa in thi fight that skallagrim lambstail wa wound
almost to death for when have taken on ship eric board the other
with but few men he wa driven back and fell over a beam and would
have been slain had not skallagrim thrown himself across hi bodi
take on hi own back that blow of a battleax which wa aim at
eric head thi wa a great wound for the ax shore through the steel
of the byrni and sank into the flesh but when eric men saw their
lord down and skallagrim as thei deem dead athwart him thei made
so fierc a rush that the foemen fell befor them like leav befor
a winter gale and the end of it wa that the vike prai peac of
eric skallagrim lai sick for mani dai but he wa hard to kill and
eric nurs him back to life after thi these two love each other as
brother love twin brother and thei could scarc bear to be apart
but other peopl did not love skallagrim nor he them
eric sail on up the thame to london bring the vike ship with
him and he deliv their captain bound to edmund edward son
the king who wa call edmund the magnific these captain the king
hung for thei had wrought damag to hi ship
eric found much favour with the king and inde hi fame had
gone befor him so when he came into the court brave clad with
skallagrim at hi back who wa now almost recov of hi wound the
king call out to him to draw near sai that he desir to look on
the bravest vike and most beauteou man who sail the sea and on
that fierc baresark whom men call eric deathshadow
so eric came forward up the long hall that wa adorn with thing more
splendid than ever hi ey had seen and stood befor the king with
him came skallagrim drive the two captiv vike chief befor him
with hi ax as a flesher drive lamb now dure these mani month
brightey had grown yet more great in girth and gloriou to look on
than he wa befor moreov hi hair wa now so long that it flow
like a flood of gold down toward hi girdl for sinc gudruda trim
it no shear had come near hi head and hi lock grew fast as a
woman the king look at him and wa astonish
of a truth he said men have not li about thee iceland nor
concern that great wolfhound of thine and he point at skallagrim
with hi sword of state never saw i such a man and he bade all the
mightiest men of hi bodyguard stand forward that he might measur them
against eric but brightey wa an inch taller than the tallest and
measur half a span more round the chest than the biggest
what wouldest thou of me iceland ask the king
thi lord said eric to serv thee a while and all my men with
me
that is an offer that few would turn from answer the king thou
shalt go into my bodyguard and if i have my will thou shalt be near
me in battl and thy wolfdog also
eric said that he ask no better and thereaft he went up with edmund
the king to make war on the dane of mercia and he and skallagrim did
great deed befor the ey of the englishmen
that winter eric and hi compani came back to london and abod with
the king in much state and honour now there wa a certain ladi of
the court name elfrida she wa both fair and wealthi the sweetest of
women and of royal blood by her mother side so soon as her ey fell
on eric she love him and no on thing did she desir more than to
be hi wife but brightey kept aloof from her for he love gudruda
alon and so the winter wore awai and in the spring he went awai
war nor did he come back till autumn wa at hand
the ladi elfrida sat at a window when eric rode through london town
in the king follow and as he pass she threw him a wreath of
flower the king saw it and laugh
my cold kinswoman seem to melt befor those bright ey of thine
iceland he said as my foe melt befor whitefir flame well i
could wish her a wors mate and he look on him strang
eric bow but made no answer
that night as thei sat at meat in the palac the ladi elfrida be
bidden in jest of edmund the king to fill the cup of the bravest pass
down the board and befor all men pour wine into eric cup and
as she did so welcom him back with short sweet word
eric grew red as dawn and thank her gracious but after the feast
he spoke with skallagrim ask him of the gudruda and when she could
be readi to take the sea

gather herself togeth slowli and smile pass up the cup
asmund lift it to hi lip and drank deep then he turn and gave it

hideou as the face of a troll
asmund grew white and put hi hand to hi head as though to think then

friend but for a littl space whilst thou art here in atli hall
let us walk hand in hand as we walk long year ago in iceland
gather up the fifabloom and watch the midnight shadow creep up
the ici jkul crest
thu swanhild spoke to him most sweetli in a low voic of music while
the tear gather in her ey talk ever of iceland that he love
and of dai long dead till eric heart soften in him
almost do i believ thee swanhild he said stretch out hi hand

between us while i bide here
she touch hi hand humbl and turn to go but as she went eric spoke
again sai swanhild hast thou tide from iceland yonder i have
heard no word of asmund or of gudruda for two long year and more
she stood still and a dark shadow that he could not see flit across
her face
i have few tide eric she said turn and those few if i mai
trust them bad enough for thi is the rumour that i have heard
that asmund the priest my father is dead that groa my mother is
deadhow i know not and lastli that gudruda the fair thy love is
betroth to ospakar blacktooth and wed him in the spring
now eric sprang up with an oath and grasp the hilt of whitefir then
he sat down again upon the stone and cover hi face with hi hand
griev not eric she said gentli i put no faith in thi new for
rumour like the blackback gull often chang colour in it flight
across the sea also i had it but at fifth hand i am sure of thi at
least that gudruda will never forsak thee without a caus
it shall go ill with ospakar if thi be true said eric smile
grimli for whitefir is yet left me and with it on true friend
run not to meet the evil eric thou shalt come to iceland with the
summer flower and find gudruda faith and yet fairer than of yore
knowest thou that hall of lithdal who wa thy mate ha sat here these
two month he is gone but thi morn i know not whither leav a
messag that he return no more
he did well to go said eric and he told her how hall had cut the
cabl
ay well inde answer swanhild had atli known thi he would have
scourg hall henc with rod of seawe and now eric i desir to
ask thee on more thing why wearest thou thy hair long like a woman
inde few women have such hair as thine is now
for thi caus swanhild i swore to gudruda that none should cut my
hair till she cut it onc more it is a great burden to me sure for
never did hair grow so fast and strong as mine and onc in a frai i wa
held fast by it and went near to the lose of my life still i will
keep the oath even if it grow on to my feet and he laugh a littl
and shook back hi golden lock
swanhild smile also and turn went but when her face wa hidden
from him she smile no more
as i live she said in her heart befor spring rain fall i again
will caus thee to break thi oath eric ay i will cut a lock of that
bright hair of thine and send it for a lovetoken to gudruda
but eric still sat upon the rock think swanhild had set an evil seed
of doubt in hi heart and alreadi it put forth root what if the
tale were true what if gudruda had given herself to ospakar well if
sosh should soon be a widow that he swore
then he rose and stalk grimli toward the hall
xix

of atli the earl at straumei for mani week all thing went well and
eric forgot hi fear swanhild wa gentl to him and kindli she love
much to talk with him even of gudruda her rival but no word of love
pass her lip nevertheless she did but bide her time for when she

would go up against thi man and drive him from the land if he could
for brightey might not come to iceland till hard upon midsumm when

the winter wore awai and the spring came then atli gather hi men
and went with eric in boat to where the chief dwelt who held hi land
there thei fell on him and there wa a fierc fight but in the end the
man wa slain by skallagrim and eric did great deed as wa hi wont
now in thi frai eric wa wound in the foot by a spear so that he
must be born back to straumei and he lai there in the hall for mani
dai swanhild nurs him and most dai he sat talk with her in her
bower
when eric wa nearli heal of hi hurt the earl went with all hi
peopl to a certain island of the orknei to gather scat that wa
unpaid and skallagrim went with him but eric did not go becaus of
hi hurt fear lest the wound should open if he walk overmuch thu
it came to pass that except for some women he wa left almost alon
with swanhild

iceland i am sure of thi that the evil fate which atli foretold will
fall on thee and the dai to come shall be even more unlucki than the
dai that have been
it mai be so said eric methink inde it will be so henceforth
i am eric the unlucki i will go back to iceland and there plai out
the game i care littl if i live or am slaini have no more joi in my
life i stand alon like a fir upon a mountaintop and everi wind from
heaven and everi storm of hail and snow beat upon my head but i sai to
thee skallagrim go thy road and leav a luckless man to hi ill fate
otherwis it shall be thine also good friend hast thou been to me now
let us part and wend south and north the king will be glad to greet
thee yonder in london lambstail
but on sever shall we know lord said skallagrim and that shall
be sword work nor will it be for long it is ill to speak such word
as these of the part of lord and thrall bethink thee of the oath i
swore on mosfel let us go north sinc it is thy will in fifti year
it will count for littl which wai we wend from the isl
so thei went togeth down to the shore and find a boat and men who
as yet knew noth of what had chanc to atli thei sail across the
firth at the rise of the moon
two dai afterward thei found a ship at wick that wa bound for farei
and sail in her eric bui a passag with the half of a gold ring
that the king had given him in london
here at farei thei sat a month or more but not in the earl hall as
when eric came with honour in the gudruda but in a farmer stead
for the tale of eric deal with atli and atli wife had reach
farei and the earl there had been a friend of atli moreov
eric wa now a poor man have neither ship nor good nor friend
therefor all look coldli on him though thei wonder at hi beauti
and hi might still thei dare not to speak ill or make a mock of him
for two men have done so were nearli slain of skallagrim who seiz
the twain by the throat on in either hand and dash their head
togeth after that men said littl
thei sat there a month till at length a chapman put in at farei bound
for iceland and thei took passag with him eric pai the other half
of hi gold ring for shiproom the chapman wa not will to give them
place at first for he too had heard the tale but skallagrim offer
him choic either to do so or to go on holmgang with him then the
chapman gave them passag
now it is told that when hi thrall and housecarl bore the corps of
atli the earl to hi hall in straumei swanhild met it and wept over it
and when the spokesman among them stood forward and told her those word
that atli had bidden them to sai to her spare none she spoke thu
my lord wa distraught and weak with loss of blood when he spoke thu
the tale i told him wa true and now eric ha ad to hi sin by
shed the blood of him whom he wrong so sore
and thereaft she spoke so sweetli and with so much gentl craft
and wisdom that though thei still doubt them all men held her word
weighti for swanhild had thi art that she could make the fals sound
true in the ear of men and the true sound fals
still be mind of their oath thei hunt for koll and found
him and when the thrall knew that thei would slai him he ran thenc
scream nor did swanhild lift a hand to save hi life for she
desir that koll should die lest he should bear wit against her
awai he ran toward the cliff and after him sped atli housecarl
till he came to the great cliff that edg in the sea now thei were
close upon him and their sword were aloft then sooner than know the
kiss of steel the liar leapt from the cliff and wa crush dy
miser on the rock below thi wa the end of koll the halfwit
groa thrall
swanhild sat in straumei for a while and took all atli heritag into
her keep for he had no male kin nor did ani sai her nai also she
call in the monei that he had out at interest and that wa a great
sum for atli wa a care and a wealthi man then swanhild made readi
to go to iceland atli had a great dragon of war and she man that
ship and fill it with store and all thing need thi done she
set steward and griev over the orknei land and farm and when the
earl wa six week dead she sail for iceland give out that she
went thither to set a bloodsuit on foot against eric for the death of
atli her lord there she came in safeti just as folk rode to the thing
now hall of lithdal came to iceland and told hi tale of the do
of eric and the death of atli oft and loud he told it and soon peopl
gossip of it in field and fair and stead bjrn asmund son heard
thi talk and sent for hall to him also hall told the tale
now said bjrn we will go to my sister gudruda the fair and learn
how she take these tide
so thei went in to where gudruda sat spin in the hall sing as
she span
greet gudruda said bjrn sai hast thou tide of eric
brightey thy betroth
i have no tide said gudruda
then here is on who bring them
now for the first time gudruda the fair saw hall of lithdal up she
sprang thou hast tide of eric hall ah thou art welcom for no
tide have come of him for mani a month speak on and she press
her hand against her heart and lean toward him
my tide ar ill ladi
is eric dead sai not that my love is dead
he is wors than dead said hall he is shame
there thou liest hall she answer shame and eric ar thing
apart
mayst thou think so when thou hast heard my tale ladi said hall
for i am sad at heart to speak it of on who wa my mate
speak on i sai answer gudruda in such a voic that hall shrank
from her speak on but of thi i warn thee that if in on word thou
liest that shall be thy death when eric come
now hall wa afraid think of the ax of skallagrim still he might
not go back upon hi word so he began at the begin tell the
stori of how he wa wound in the fight with ospakar ship and left
farei isl and how he came thenc to scotland and sat in atli hall
on orknei then he told how the gudruda wa wreck on straumei
and of all aboard eric and skallagrim alon were save becaus of
swanhild dream
herein i see witchwork said gudruda
then hall told that eric becam swanhild love but of the other tale
which swanhild had whisper to atli he said noth for he knew that
gudruda would not believ thi and moreov if it were so swanhild
had not sent the token which he should give
it mai well be said gudruda proudli swanhild is fair and light
of mind perchanc she led brightey into thi snare but though
she spoke thu bitter jealousi and anger burn in her breast and she
rememb the sight which she had seen when eric and swanhild met on
the morn of atli wed
then hall told of the slai of atli the good by eric but he said
noth of the earl dy word nor of how he goad brightey with
hi bitter word
it wa an ill deed in sooth said gudruda for eric to slai an old
man whom he had wrong still it mai chanc that he wa driven to it
for hi own life sake
then hall said that he had seen swanhild after atli slai and that
she had told him that she and eric should wed shortli and that eric
would rule in orknei by her side
gudruda ask if that wa all hi tale
ye ladi answer hall that is all my tale for after that i
sail and know not what happen but i am charg to give someth
to thee and that by the ladi swanhild she bade me sai thi also that
when thou lookest on the gift thou shouldst think on a certain oath
which eric took as to the cut of hi hair and he drew a linen
packet from hi breast and gave it to her
thrice gudruda look on it fear to open it then see the smile
of mockeri on bjrn cold face she took the shear that hung at her
side and cut the thread with them and as she cut a lock of golden hair
rose from the packet untwist itself like a live snake the lock
wa long and it end wa cake with gore
whose hair is thi said gudruda though she knew the hair well
eric hair said hall that swanhild cut from hi head with eric
sword
now gudruda put her hand to her bosom she drew out a satchel and from
the satchel a lock of yellow hair side by side she place the lock
look first at on and then at the other
thi is eric hair in sooth she saider hair that he swore
none but i should cut eric hair that swanhild shore with whitefir
from eric headwhitefir whereon we plight troth sai now whose
blood is thi that stain the hair of eric
it is atli blood whom eric first dishonour and then slew with hi
own hand answer hall
now there burn a fire on the hearth for the dai wa cold gudruda the
fair stood over the fire and with either hand she let the two lock of
eric hair fall upon the ember slowli thei twist up and burn she
watch them burn then she threw up her hand and with a great cry fled
from the hall
bjrn and hall of lithdal look on each other
thou hadst best go henc said bjrn and of thi i warn thee hall
though i hold thy tide good that if thou hast spoken on fals
word that will be thy death for then it would be better for thee to
face all the wolv in iceland than to stand befor eric in hi rage
again hall bethought himself of the ax of skallagrim and he went out
heavili
that dai a messeng came from gudruda to bjrn sai that she would
speak with him he went to where she sat alon upon her bed her face
wa white as death and her dark ey glow
eric ha dealt badli with thee sister to bring thee to thi sorrow
said bjrn
speak no evil of eric to me gudruda answer the evil that he ha
done will be paid back to him there is littl need for thee to heap
word upon hi head hearken bjrn my brother is it yet thy will that
i should wed ospakar blacktooth
that is my will sure there is no match in iceland as thi ospakar
and i should win mani friend by it
do thi then bjrn send messeng to swinefel and sai to ospakar
that if he would still wed gudruda the fair asmund daughter let
him come to middalhof when folk ride from the thing and he shall not go
henc alon nai i have done now i prai thee speak no more to me of
eric or of ospakar of the on i have seen and heard enough and of the
other i shall hear and see enough in the year that ar to come
xxii
how eric came home again
swanhild made a good passag from the orknei and wa in iceland
thirtyf dai befor eric and skallagrim set foot there but she did
not land by westman isl for she had no wish to face gudruda at
that time but by reyja now she rode thenc with her compani to
thingvalla for here all men were gather for the thing at first
peopl hung aloof from her notwithstand her wealth and beauti but
swanhild knew well how to win the heart of men for now she told the
same stori of eric that she had told to atli and there were none to sai
her nai so it came to pass that she wa believ and eric brightey
held to be shame inde now too she set a suit on foot against eric
for the death of atli at hi hand claim that sentenc of the greater
outlawri should be pass against him and that hi land at coldback in
the marsh on ran river should be given half to her in aton for the
earl death and half to the men of eric quarter
on the dai of the open of the thing ospakar blacktooth came from the
north and with him hi son gizur and a great compani of men ospakar
wa blith for from the thing he should ride to middalhof there to wed
gudruda the fair then swanhild clad herself in beauti attir and
take men with her went to the booth of ospakar
blacktooth sat in hi booth and by him sat gizur hi son the lawman
when he saw a beauteou ladi veri richli clad enter the booth he did
not know who it might be but gizur knew her well for he could never
put swanhild from hi mind
lo here come swanhild the fatherless atli widow said gizur
flush red with joi at the sight of her
then ospakar greet her heartili and made place for her by him at the
top of the booth
ospakar blacktooth she said i am come to ask thi of thee that
thou shalt befriend me in the suit which i have against eric brightey
for the slai of earl atli my husband
thou couldst have come to no man who is more will said ospakar
for if thou hast someth against eric i have yet more
i would ask thi too ospakar that thy son gizur should take up my
suit and plead it for i know well that he is the most skil of all
lawmen
i will do that said gizur hi ey yet fix upon her face
i look for no less from thee said swanhild and be sure of
thi that thou shalt not plead for noth and she glanc at him
meaningli then she set out her case with a ly tongu and afterward
went back to her booth glad at heart for now she learn that hall had
not fail in hi errand see that gudruda wa about to wed ospakar
gizur gave warn of the bloodsuit and the end of it wa that though
he had no notic and wa not there to answer to the charg against all
right and custom eric wa declar outlaw and hi land were given half
to swanhild and half to the men of hi quarter for now all held that
swanhild wa a true tale and eric the most shame of men and
therefor thei were will to stretch the law against him also be
absent he had few friend and those men of small account wherea
ospakar who back swanhild suit wa the most power of the
northern chief as gizur wa the most skill lawman in iceland
moreov bjrn the priest asmund son wa among the judg and
though swanhild tale seem strang to him after that which he had
heard from hall of lithdal he love eric littl he fear also that
if eric came a free man to iceland befor gudruda wa wed to ospakar
her love would conquer her anger for he could see well that she still
love brightey therefor he strove with might and main that eric
should be brought in guilti nor did he fail in thi
so the end of it wa that eric brightey wa outlaw hi land
declar forfeit and hi head a wolf head to be taken by him who
might should he set foot in iceland
thereaft the alth be end bjrn gizur and ospakar with all
their compani rode awai to middalhof to sit at the marriagefeast but
swanhild and her folk went by sea in the long warship to westman for
thi wa her plan to seiz on coldback and to sit there for a while
till she saw if eric came out to iceland also she desir to see the
wed of ospakar and gudruda for she had been bidden to it by bjrn
her halfbroth
now ospakar came to middalhof and found gudruda wait hi come
she stood in the great hall pale and cold as april snow and greet
him courteous but when he would have kiss her she shrank from him
for now he wa more hideou in her sight than he had ever been and she
loath him in her heart
that night there wa feast in the hall and at the feast gudruda
heard that eric had been made outlaw then she spoke
thi is an ill deed thu to judg an absent man
sai gudruda said bjrn in her ear hast thou not also judg eric
who is absent
she turn her head and spoke no more of eric but bjrn word fix
themselv in her heart like arrow the tale wa strang to her for it
seem that eric had been made outlaw at swanhild suit and yet
eric wa swanhild love for swanhild self had sent the lock of
brightey hair by hall sai that he wa her love and soon would wed
her how then did swanhild bring a suit against him who should be her
husband moreov she heard that swanhild sail down to coldback and
wa bidden to the marriagefeast that should be on the third dai from
now could it be then when all wa said and done that eric wa less
faithless than she deem gudruda heart stood still and the blood
rush to her brow when she thought on it also even if it were so it
wa now too late and sure it wa not so for had not eric been made
outlaw men were not made outlaw for a littl thing nai she would meet
her fate and ask no more of eric and hi do
on the morrow as gudruda sat in her chamber it wa told her that
saevuna thorgrimur widow and eric mother had come from coldback to
speak with her for after the death of asmund and of unna saevuna had
move back to coldback on the marsh
nai how can thi be said gudruda astonish for she knew well that

that is a strang sight to see
at first gudruda wa mind to sai her nai but her heart soften and
she bade them bring saevuna in present she came be set in a chair
upon the shoulder of four men she wa white to see for sick had
ag her much and she stare about her with sightless ey but she wa

among them is bjrn the brother of her whom i would make my bride
better on such fight than mani bride said skallagrim shake hi
red ax we have won great glori thi dai brightey and ospakar is

now eric and skallagrim ran to their hors none hinder them and
mount rode toward mosfel
all that even and all the night thei rode and at morn thei came
across the black sand to mosfel slope that ar by the hecla here thei
rest and take off their armour wash themselv in the stream
for thei were veri weari and foul with blood and wound when thei had

peer across the plain with hi hawk ey saw men ride fast
toward them
foe ar soon afoot lord he said i thought we had stai their

i have still strength for on or two said skallagrim and then

carlin ha kept her word
then eric wa glad and present six men head by jon hi thrall
the same man who had watch on mosfel when eric went up to slai the
baresark rode to them and greet them beggar women said jon whom
thei met at ran river had told them of the death of ospakar and of

it is true jon said eric but first give us food if ye have it
for we ar hunger and spent when we have eaten we will speak
so thei led up a packhors and from it took stockfish and smoke meat
of which eric and skallagrim at heartili till their strength came back
to them
then eric spoke comrad he said i am an outlaw man and though
i have not sought it much blood is on my head atli is dead at my hand

i did not look for such a thing at your hand said eric but stormi
water show how the boat is built mai no bad luck come to you from your
good fellowship and now let us to our nest
then thei caught the hors and rode with brightey up the steep
side of mosfel till at length thei came to that secret dell which
skallagrim had onc shown to eric here thei turn the hors loos to
feed and go forward on foot reach the dark and narrow pass that
brightey had trod when he sought for the baresark foe skallagrim led
the wai along it then came eric and the rest on by on thei step
on to the giddi point of rock and catch at the birchbush enter
the hole so thei gain the platform and the great cave beyond and
thei found that no man had set foot there sinc the dai when eric had
striven with skallagrim for there on the rock rotten with the weather
lai that haft of wood which brightey had hew from the ax of
skallagrim and in the cave were mani thing besid as the baresark had
left them
so thei took up their dwell in the cave eric skallagrim and the
six coldback men and there thei dwelt mani month but eric sent out
hi men on at a time and got togeth food and a store of sheepskin
and other need thing for he knew thi well that gizur and swanhild
would befor long come up against them and if thei could not take them
by forc would set themselv to watch the mountainpath and starv
them out
when eric and skallagrim rode awai from middalhof the fight still rage
fierc in the hall and noth but death might stai it the mind of
men were mad and thei smote on anoth and slew each other till
at length of all that marriag compani few were left unharm except
gizur swanhild and gudruda for the serv thrall and womenfolk had
fled the hall and with them some peac men
then gudruda spoke as on in a dream

the hall of middalhof on gore of blood and lo it is so look upon thy

gudruda sat on high in the bride seat ask wisdom of the piledup

xxvi
how eric ventur down to middalhof and what he found
gizur went north to swinefel and swanhild went with him for now that
ospakar wa dead at eric hand gizur rule in hi place at swinefel
and wa the greatest lord in all the north he love swanhild and
desir to make her hi wife but she plai with him talk darkli of
what might be swanhild wa not mind to be the wife of ani man except
of eric to all other she wa cold as the winter earth still she
fool gizur as she had fool atli the good and he grew blind with
love of her for still the beauti of swanhild wax as the moon wax in
the sky and her wick ey shone as the star shine when the moon ha
set
now thei came to swinefel and there gizur buri ospakar blacktooth
hi father with much state he set him in a chamber of rock and timber
on a mountaintop whenc he might see all the land that onc were hi
and built up a great mound of earth abov him to thi dai peopl tell
that here on yule night black ospakar burst out and golden eric ride
down the blast to meet him then come the clang of sword and groan
and the sound of riven helm till present brightey pass southward
on the wind bear in hi hand the half of a cloven shield
so gizur bound the hellsho on hi father and swore that he would
neither rest nor stai till eric brightey wa dead and dead wa
skallagrim lambstail then he gather a great forc of men and rode
south to coldback to the slai of eric and with him went swanhild
gudruda sat alon in the haunt hall of middalhof and brood on her
love and on her fate eric too sat in mosfel cave and brood on hi
evil chanc hi heart wa sick with sorrow and there wa littl that
he could do except think about the past he would not go to forai after
the fashion of outlaw and there wa no need of thi for the talk of
hi mighti deed spread through the land so that the peopl spoke of
littl els and the men of hi quarter were so proud of these deed of
eric that though some of their kind had fallen at hi hand in the
great fight of middalhof and some at the hand of skallagrim yet thei
spoke of him as men speak of a god moreov thei brought him gift of
food and cloth and arm as mani as hi peopl could carri awai
and laid them in a booth that is on the plain near the foot of mosfel
which thenceforth wa name ericsfel further thei bade hi thrall
tell him that if he wish it thei would find him a good ship of war
to take him from icelandai and man it with loyal men and true
eric thank them through jon hi thrall but answer that he wish to
die here in iceland
now when eric had sat two month and more in mosfel cave and autumn
wa come he learn that gizur and swanhild had move down to
coldback and with them a great compani of men who were sworn to slai
him he ask if gudruda the fair had also gather men for hi slai
thei told him no that gudruda stai with her thrall and women at
middalhof mourn for bjrn her brother from these tide eric took
some heart of hope at the least gudruda laid no bloodfeud against him
for he wait think if inde she yet love him that gudruda would
send him some word or token of her love but no word came sinc between
them ran the blood of bjrn on the morrow of these tide skallagrim
spoke to eric
thi is my counsel lord he said that we ride out by night and fall
on the folk of gizur at coldback and burn the stead over them put
them to the sword i am weari of sit here like an eagl in a cage
such is no counsel of mine skallagrim answer brightey i am
weari of sit here inde but i am yet more weari of bring men
to their death i will shed no more blood unless it is to save my own
head when the peopl of gizur came to seek me on mosfel thei shall
find me here but i will not go to them
thy heart is out of thee lord said skallagrim thou wast not wont
to speak thu
ay skallagrim said eric the heart is out of me yet i ride from

like enough then thou wilt be silent thereaft
it well mai be said eric yet i will ride i can bear thi doubt no
longer
then i shall come with thee said skallagrim
as thou wilt answer eric
so at middai eric and skallagrim rode awai from mosfel in a storm of
rain the rain wa so heavi that those of gizur spi who watch the
mountain did not see them all that dai thei rode and all the night
till by morn thei came to middalhof eric told skallagrim to stai
with the hors and let them feed while he went on foot to see if by
chanc he might get speech with gudruda thi the baresark did though
he grumbl at the task fear lest eric should be done to death and
he not there to die with him
now eric walk to within two bowshot of the hous then sat down in a
dell by the river from the edg of which he could see those who pass
in and out present hi heart gave a leap for there came out from the
woman door a ladi tall and beauti to see and with golden hair
that flow about her breast it wa gudruda and he saw that she bore a
napkin in her hand then eric knew accord to her custom on the warm
morn that she came alon to bath in the river as she had alwai
done from a child it wa her habit to bath here in thi place for at
the bottom of the dell wa a spot where reed and bush grew thick and
the water lai in a basin of rock and wa clear and still for at thi
spot a hot spring ran into the river
eric went down the dell hid himself close in the bush and wait for
he fear to speak with gudruda in the open field a while pass and
present the shadow of the ladi crept over the edg of the dell then
she came herself in that beauti which sinc her dai ha not been known
in iceland her face wa sad and sweet her dark and love ey were
sad on she came till she stood within a spear length of where eric
lai crouch in the bush and look at her through the hedg of
reed here a flat rock overhung the water and gudruda sat herself
on thi rock and shake off her shoe dip her white feet in the
water then suddenli she threw asid her cloak bare her arm and
gaze upon the shadow of her beauti in the mirror of the water sigh
and sigh again while eric look at her with a burst heart for as
yet he could find no word to sai
now she spoke aloud of what us to be so fair she said oh
wherefor wa i born so fair to bring death to mani and sorrow on myself
and him i love and she shook her golden hair about her arm of snow
and hold the napkin to her ey wept softli but it seem to eric
that between her sob she call upon hi name
now eric could no longer bear the sight of gudruda weep while she
wept hide her ey he rose from behind the screen of reed and stood
besid her in such fashion that hi shadow fell upon her she felt the
sunlight pass and look up lo it wa no cloud but the shape of eric
and the sun glitter on hi golden helm and hair
eric gudruda cri eric then rememb how she wa attir
snatch her cloak she threw it about her arm and thrust her wet feet
into her shoe out upon thee she said is it not enough then that

didst sit as wife is more to thee than the death of bjrn
the bridecup wa not yet drunk eric therefor i have no bloodfeud

ye gogo never let me see thy face again
brightey turn without a word he took three pace and gudruda

now she said if we must stai here it is better that we hide where
thou didst hide lest some come upon thee and she pass through the
screen of rush and sat down in a grassi place beyond and spoke again

and for thi matter of the death of bjrn at my hand think gudruda
wa i to blame in it did not bjrn thrust the cloven shield befor my
feet and thu give me into the hand of ospakar did he not afterward
smite at me from behind and would he not have slain me if skallagrim
had not caught the blow wa i then to blame if i smote back and if

how he had board the raven and with skallagrim slain those who sail
in her he told her also of hi deed in ireland and of how he took the
vike ship and came to london town
and as he told gudruda listen as on who hung upon her lover dy

eric ey and there wa but on music the music of hi voic now
she look upon him sidelong no longer but with open ey and part

she crept closer to hi side
then he told her how he had been greatli honour of the king of
england and of the battl he had fought in at hi side lastli eric

put me from her if i should come again to england
now gudruda look him in the face and spoke sai eric is it in thy

answer
gudruda heard she thought on the great and beauteou ladi elfrida far

but gudruda sat a while behind the screen of reed and wa veri happi
for a space for it wa as though the winter were past and summer shone
upon her heart again
xxvii
how gudruda went up to mosfel
eric walk warili till he came to the dell where he had left skallagrim
and the hors it wa the same dell in which groa had brew the
poisondraught for asmund the priest and unna thorod daughter
what new lord said skallagrim thou wast gone so long that i
thought of seek thee hast thou seen gudruda
ay said eric and thi is the upshot of it that in the spring we
sail for england and bid farewel to iceland and our ill luck
would then that it were spring said skallagrim speak
brightey own word why not sail now and make an end
gudruda ha no ship and it is late to take the sea also i think that
she would let a time go by becaus of the bloodfeud which she ha
against me for the death of bjrn
i would rather risk these thing than stai the winter through in
iceland said skallagrim it is long from now to spring and yon
wolf den is coldli in the dark month as i know well
there is light beyond the dark said eric and thei rode awai
everyth went well with them till late at night thei came to the
slope of mosfel thei were half asleep on their hors be weari
with much ride and the hors were weari also suddenli skallagrim
look up caught the faint gleam of light from sword hidden behind
some stone
awak lord he cri here ar foe ahead
gizur folk behind the stone heard hi voic and came out from their
ambush there were six of them and thei form in line befor the pair
thei were watch the mountain for a rumour had reach them that eric
wa abroad and see him thei had hidden hastili behind the stone
now what counsel shall we take said eric draw whitefir
we have often stood against men more than six and sometim we have
left more men than six to mark where we stood answer skallagrim it
is my counsel that we ride at them
so be it said eric and he spur hi weari hors with hi heel
now when the six saw eric and skallagrim charg on them boldli thei
waver and the end of it wa that thei broke and fled to either side
befor a blow wa struck for it had come to thi pass so great wa the
terror of the name of eric brightey and skallagrim lambstail that no
six men dare to stand befor them in open fight
so the path be clear thei rode on up the slope but when thei had
gone a littl wai skallagrim turn hi hors and mock those who had
lain in ambush sai
ye fight well ye carl of gizur ospakar son ye ar hero
sure sai now mighti men will ye stand there if i come down alon
against you
at these word the men grew mad with wrath and flung their spear
skallagrim caught on on hi shield and it fell to the earth but
anoth pass over hi head and struck eric on the left shoulder
near the neck make a deep wound feel the spear fast in him eric
grasp it with hi right hand drew it forth and turn hurl it so
hard that the man befor it got hi death from the blow for hi shield
did not serv to stai it then the rest fled
skallagrim bound up eric wound as well as he could and thei went on
to the cave but when eric folk watch abov saw the fight thei
ran down and met him now the hurt wa bad and eric bled much still
within ten dai it heal up for the time
but a littl while after eric wound wa skin over the snow set
in on mosfel and the dai grew short and the night long onc gizur
men to the number of fifti came half wai up the mountain to take it
but when thei saw how strong the place wa thei fear and went back
and after that return no more though thei alwai watch the fell
it wa veri dark and lonesom there upon the fell for a while eric kept
in good heart but as the dai went by he grew troubl for sinc he
wa wound thi had come upon him that he fear the dark and the
death of atli at hi hand and atli word weigh more and more upon
hi mind thei had no candl on the fell yet rather than stai in the
black of the cave eric would wrap sheepskin about him and sit by
the edg of that gulf down which the head of the baresark had foretold
hi fall and look out at the wide plain and fell and icemountain
gleam in the silver shine of the northern light or in the white
beam of the star
it chanc that eric had bidden the men who stai with him to build a
stone hut upon the flat space of rock befor the cave and to roof it
with turv he had done thi that work might keep them in heart also
that thei might have a place to store such good as thei had gather
now there wa on stone ly near that no two men of their number could
move except skallagrim and on other on dai while it wa light eric
watch these two roll the stone along to where it must stand and it
wa slow work present thei stai to rest then eric came and put
hi hand beneath the stone lift and while men wonder he roll
the mass alon to where it should be set as the corner stone of the
hut
ye ar all children he said and laugh merrili
ay when we set our strength against thine lord answer skallagrim
but look the blood run from thy neckth spearwound ha broken out
afresh
so it is sure said eric then he wash the wound and bound it up
think littl of the matter
but that night accord to hi custom eric sat on the edg of the
gulf and look at the winter light as thei plai over hecla snow
he wa sad and heavi at heart for he thought of gudruda and wonder
much if thei should live to wed rememb atli word he had littl
faith in hi good luck now as eric sat and thought the bandag on hi
neck slip so that the hurt bled and the frost got hold of the wound
and froze it and froze hi long hair to it also in such fashion that
when he went to the cave where all men slept he could not loos hi
hair from the sore but lai down with it frozen to him on the morrow
the hair wa cake so fast about hi neck that it could onli be freed by
shear it but thi eric would not suffer none he said should shear
hi hair except gudruda thu he had sworn and when he broke the oath
misfortun had come of it he would break that vow no more if it cost
him hi life for sorrow and hi ill luck had taken so great a hold of
eric mind that in some wai he wa scarc himself
so it came to pass that he fell more and more sick till at length
he could not rise from hi bed in the cave but lai there all dai and
night stare at the littl light which pierc the gloom still he
would not suffer that anyon should touch hi hair and when on stole
upon him sleep think so to cut it befor he woke and come at the
wound suddenli he sat up and dealt the man such a buffet on the head
that he went near to death from it
then skallagrim spoke
on thi matter he said it seem that brightey is mad he will not
suffer that ani touch hi hair except gudruda and yet if hi hair is
not shorn he must die for the wound will fester under it nor mai we
cut it by strength for then he will kill himself in struggl it is
come to thi then either gudruda must be brought hither or eric will
shortli die
that mai not be thei answer how can the ladi gudruda come here
across the snow even if she will come
come she can if she ha the heart said skallagrim though i put
littl trust in women heart still i ride down to middalhof and
thou jon shalt go with me for the rest i charg you watch your lord
for if i come back and find anyth amiss that shall be the death of
some and if i do not come back but perish on the road yet i will haunt
you
now jon like not thi task still for love of eric and fear of
skallagrim he set out with the baresark thei had a hard journei
through the snowdrift and the dark but on the third dai thei came to
middalhof knock upon the door and enter
now it wa suppertim and peopl sit at meat saw a great black
man cover with snow and rime stalk up the hall and after him
anoth smaller man who groan with the cold and thei wonder at
the sight gudruda sat on the high seat and the firelight beat upon her
face
who come here she said
on who would speak with thee ladi answer skallagrim
here is skallagrim the baresark said a man he is an outlaw let us
kill him
ay it is skallagrim he answer and if there is kill to be
done why here that which shall do it and he drew out hi ax and
smile grimli
then all held their peac for thei fear the ax of skallagrim
ladi he said i do not come for slai or such child plai i come
to speak a word in thine earbut first i ask a cup of mead and a morsel
of food for we have spent three dai in the snow
so thei at and drank then gudruda bade the baresark draw near and tell
her hi tale
ladi said he eric my lord li dy on mosfel
gudruda turn white as the snow
dyinger li dy she said why then art thou here
for thi caus ladi i think that thou canst save him if he is not
alreadi sped and he told her all the tale
now gudruda thought a while
thi is a hard journei she said and it doe not becom a maid to
visit outlaw in their cave yet i am come to thi that i will die
befor i shrink from anyth that mai save the life of eric when must
we ride skallagrim
thi night said the baresark thi night while the men sleep for
now night and dai ar almost the same the snow is deep and we have no
time to lose if we would find brightey live
then we will ride tonight answer gudruda
afterward when peopl slept gudruda the fair summon her women and
bade them sai to all who ask for her that she lai sick in bed but she
call three trusti thrall bid them bring two packhors laden
with hai food drug candl made of sheep fat and other good
and ride with her then all be readi thei rode awai secretli
up stonefel gudruda on her hors blackman and the other on good
geld that had been hayf in the yard and by daylight thei pass
up horsehead height thei slept two night in the snow and on
the second night almost perish there for much soft snow fell but
afterward came frost and a bitter northerli wind and thei pass on
gudruda wa a strong woman and great of heart and will and so it
came about that on the third dai she reach mosfel weari but littl
harm though the finger of her left hand were frostbitten thei
climb the mountain and when thei came to the dell where the hors
were kept certain of eric men met them and their face were sad
how goe it now with brightey said skallagrim for gudruda could
scarc speak becaus of doubt and cold is he dead then
nai thei answer but like to die for he is besid himself and
rave wildli
push on quoth gudruda push on lest it be too late
so thei climb the mountain on foot won the pass and came to that
giddi point of rock where he must tread who would reach the platform
that is befor the cave now sinc she had hung by her hand over
goldfoss gulf gudruda had fear to tread upon a height with noth to
hold to skallagrim went first then call to her to follow thrice she
look and turn awai trembl for the place wa aw and the fall
bottomless then she spoke aloud to herself
eric did not fear to risk hi life to save me when i hung over golden
fall less then should i fear to risk mine to save him and she
step boldli down upon the point but when she stood there over the
giddi height shiver ran along her bodi and her mind grew dark she
clutch at the rock gave on low cry and began to fall inde she
would have fallen and been lost had not skallagrim ly on hi breast
in the narrow hole stretch out hi arm caught her by the cloak and
kirtl and drag her to him present her sens came back
i am safe she gasp but by a veri littl methink that here
in thi place i must live and die for i can never tread yonder rock
again
thou shalt pass it safe enough ladi with a rope round thee said

xxviii
how swanhild won tide of eric
now eric strength came back to him and hi heart open in the light
of gudruda ey like a flower in the sunshin for all dai long she
sat at hi side hold hi hand and talk to him and thei found
much to sai
but on the fifth dai from the dai of hi awaken she spoke thu
eric now i must go back to middalhof thou art safe and it is not well
that i should stai here
not yet gudruda he said leav me not yet
ye love i must leav thee the moon is bright the sky ha clear
and the snow is hard with frost and fit for the hoof of hors i must
go befor more storm come listen now in the second week of spring
if all is well i will send thee a messeng with word of token then
shalt thou come down secretli to middalhof and there eric we will be
wed then on the next dai we will sail for england in a tradingship
that i shall get readi to seek our fortun there
it will be a good fortun if thou art by my side said eric so
good that i doubt greatli if i mai find it for i am eric the unlucki
swanhild must yet be reckon with gudruda ye thou art right thou
must go henc gudruda and swiftli though it griev me much to part
with thee
then eric call skallagrim and bade him make thing readi to ride down
to middalhof with the ladi gudruda
thi skallagrim did swiftli and afterward eric and gudruda kiss and
part and thei were sad at heart to part
now on the fifth dai after the go of gudruda skallagrim came back
to mosfel somewhat cold and weari and he told eric who could now walk
and grew strong again that he and jon had ridden with gudruda the fair
to horsehead height see no man and had left her there to go on
with her thrall he had come back also see no on for the weather
wa too cold for the men of gizur to watch the fell in the snow
now gudruda came safe to middalhof have been eleven dai gone and
found that few had visit the hous and that these had been told that
she lai sick ab her secret had been well kept and though swanhild
had no lack of spi mani dai went by befor she learn that gudruda
had gone up to mosfel to nurs eric
after thi gudruda began to make readi for her flight from iceland she
call in the monei that she had out at interest and with them bought
from a certain chapman a good tradingship which lai in it shed under
the shelter of westman isl thi ship she began to make readi for sea
so soon as the heart of the winter wa broken put it about that she
intend to send her on a trade voyag to scotland in the spring and
also to give colour to thi tale she bought mani pelt and other good
such as chapmen deal in
thu the dai pass onnot so badli for gudruda who strove to fill
their empti in make readi for the full and happi time but for
eric in hi cave thei were veri heavi for he could find noth to do
except to sleep and eat and think of gudruda whom he might not see
for swanhild also sit at coldback the dai did not go well she
wa weari of the court of gizur whom she plai with as a cat plai
with a rat and her heart wa sick with love hate and jealousi for
she well knew that gudruda and eric still clung to each other and found
mean of greet if not of speech at that time she wish to kill
eric if she could though she would rather kill gudruda if she dare
still she could not come at eric for her men fear to try the narrow
wai of mosfel and when thei met him in the open thei fled befor him
present it came to her ear that gudruda made a ship readi to sail to
scotland on a trade voyag and she wa perplex by thi tale for
she knew that gudruda had no love of trade and never thought of gain
so she set spi to watch the ship still the slow dai drew on and
at length the air grew soft with spring and flower show through the
snow
eric sat in hi mountain nest wait for tide and watch the
nest eagl wheel about the cliff at length new came for on
morn as he rose skallagrim told him that a man want to speak with
him he had come to the mountain in the dark and had lain in a dell
till the break of the light for now that the snow were melt
the men of gizur and swanhild watch the wai
eric bade them bring the man to him when he saw him he knew that he wa
a thrall of gudruda and welcom him heartili
what tide he ask
thi lord said the thrall gudruda the fair bid me sai that she is
well and that the snow melt on the roof of middalhof
now thi wa the signal word that had been agre upon between eric and
gudruda that she should send him when all wa readi
good said eric ride back to gudruda the fair and sai that eric
brightey is well but on hecla the snow melt not
by thi answer he meant that he would be with her present though the
thrall could make noth of it then skallagrim ask tide of the
man and learn that swanhild wa still at middalhof and with her
gizur and that thei gave out that thei wish to make an end of wait
and slai eric
first snare your bird then wring hi neck laugh skallagrim
then eric did thi among hi men were some who he knew were not will
to sail from iceland and jon hi thrall wa of them for jon did not
love the angri sea he bade these bide a while on mosfel and make fire
nightli on the platform of rock which is in front of the cave that the
spi of gizur and swanhild might be deceiv by them and think that
eric wa still on the fell then when thei heard that he had sail
thei were to come down and hide themselv with friend till gizur and
hi follow rode north but he told two of the men who would sail with
him to make readi
that night befor the moon rose eric said farewel to jon and the other
who stai on mosfel and rode awai with skallagrim and the two who
went with him thei pass the plain of black sand in safeti and so
on to horsehead height now at length as the afternoon drew on to
even from stonefel crest thei saw the hall of middalhof befor
them and eric heart swell in hi breast yet thei must wait till
dark fell befor thei dare enter the place lest thei should be
seen and notic of their come should be carri to gizur and swanhild
and thi came into the mind of eric that of all the hour of hi life
that hour of wait wa the longest scarc inde could skallagrim
hold him back from go down the mountain side he wa so set on come
to gudruda whom he should wed that night
at length the dark fell and thei went on eric rode swiftli down
the rough mountain path while skallagrim and the two men follow
grumbl for thei fear that their hors would fall at length thei
came to the place and ride into the yard eric sprang from hi
hors and strode to the women door now gudruda stood in the porch
listen and while he wa yet some wai off she heard the clang of
brighteyen har and the colour came and went upon her cheek then
she turn and fled to the high seat of the hall and sat down there
onli two women were left in middalhof with her and some thrall who
tend the kine and hors but these slept not in the hall but in an
outhous gudruda had sent the rest of her peopl down to the ship to
help in the lade for it wa given out that the vessel sail on the
morrow she had done thi that there might be no talk of the come of
eric to middalhof
now brightey came to the porch and find the door wide walk
in but skallagrim and the men stai without a while and tend the
hors a fire burn upon the centr hearth in the hall and threw
shadow on the panel eric walk on by it light look to left
and right but see neither man nor woman then a great fear took
him lest gudruda should be gone or perhap slain of swanhild groa
daughter and he trembl at the thought he stood by the fire and
gudruda watch from the shadow of the high seat saw the dull light
glow upon hi golden helm and a sigh of joi broke from her lip eric
heard the sigh and look and as he look a stick of pitchi driftwood
fell into the fire and flare up fierc then he saw there in the
carv high seat robe all in bridal white sat gudruda the fair
hi love her golden hair flow about her breast her white arm were
stretch toward him and on her sweet face shone such a look of love
as he had never seen
eric she whisper softli and the breath of her voic ran down the
empti panel hall that from all side seem to answer eric
slowli he drew near to her he saw noth but the glori of gudruda
face and the light shine on gudruda hair he heard noth save the
sigh of her breath he knew noth except that befor him sat hi
fair bride won after mani year
now he had climb the high seat and now wrap in each other arm
thei sat and gaze into each other ey and lo the air of the great
hall roll round them a sea of glori and sweet voic whisper in
their ear now freya smile upon them and led them through her gate of
love and thei were glad that thei had been born
thu then thei were wed
now the stori tell that swanhild spoke with gizur ospakar son in
the hous at coldback
i tire of thi slow plai she said we have tarri here for mani
week and atli blood yet cri out for vengeanc and cri for
vengeanc the blood of black ospakar thy father and the blood of mani
anoth dead at great eric hand
i tire also said gizur and i am much need in the north i sai
thi to thee swanhild that hadst thou not so strictli laid it on me
that eric must die er thou weddest me i had flit back to swinefel
befor now and there bide my time to bring brightey to hi end
i will never wed thee gizur till eric is dead said swanhild
fierc
how shall we come at him then he answer we mai not go up that
mountain path for two men can hold it against all our strength and
folk do not love to meet eric and skallagrim in a narrow wai
the place ha been badli watch said swanhild i am sure of thi
that eric ha been down to middalhof and seen gudruda my halfsist
she is shameless who still hold commun with him who slew her brother
and my husband death should be her reward and i am mind to slai her
becaus of the shame that she ha brought upon our blood
that is a deed which thou wilt do alon then said gizur for i will
have no hand in the murder of that fair maidno nor will ani who live
in iceland
swanhild glanc at him strang hearken gizur she said gudruda
make a ship readi to sail with good to scotland and bring a cargo
thenc befor winter come again now i find thi strang for never
befor did i know gudruda turn her thought to trade i think that she
ha it in her mind to sail from iceland with thi outlaw eric and seek
a home over sea and that i will not bear
it mai be said gizur and i should not be sorri to see the last of
brightey for i think that more men will die at hi hand befor he
stiffen in hi barrow
thou art cowardlyheart thou son of ospakar swanhild said thou
sayest thou lovest me and wouldest win me to wife i tell thee that
there is but on road to my arm and it lead over the corps of eric
now thi is my counsel that we send the most of our men to watch that
ship of gudruda and when she lift anchor to board her and search
for she is alreadi bound for sea also among the peopl here i have a
carl who wa born near hecla and he swear thi to me that when
he wa a lad search for an eagl eyri he found a path by which
mosfel might be climb from the north and that in the end he came
to a larg flat place and look over saw that platform where eric
dwell with hi thrall but he could not see the cave becaus of the
overhang brow of the rock now we will do thi thou and i and the
carl aloneno more for i do not wish that our search should be
nois abroadtomorrow at the dawn we will ride awai for mosfel and
pass under hecla come round the mountain and see if thi path mai
still be scale for if so we will return with men and make an end of
brightey
thi plan pleas gizur and he said that it should be so
so veri earli on the follow morn swanhild have sent mani men to
watch gudruda ship rode awai secretli with gizur and the thrall and
befor it wa again dawn thei were on the northern slope of mosfel
it wa on thi same night that eric went down from the mountain to wed
gudruda
for a while the climb wa easi but at length thei came to a great
wall of rock a hundr fathom high on which no fox might find a
foothold nor anyth that had not wing
here now is an end of our journei said gizur and i onli prai thi
that eric mai not ride round the mountain befor we ar down again for
he did not know that brightey alreadi rode hard for middalhof
not so said the thrall if onli i can find the place by which some
thirti summer ago i won yonder rift and through it the crest of the
fell and he point to a narrow cleft in the face of the rock high
abov their head that wa cloth with grei moss
then he move to the right and search peer behind stone and
birchbush till present he held up hi hand and whistl thei
pass along the slope and found him stand by a littl stream of
water which well from beneath a great rock
here is the place the man said
i see no place answer swanhild
still it is there ladi and he climb on to the rock draw her
after him at the back of it wa a hole almost overgrown with moss
here is the path he said again
then it is on that i have no mind to follow answer swanhild
gizur go thou with the man and see if hi tale is true i will stai
here till ye come back
then the thrall let himself down into the hole and gizur went after him
but swanhild sat there in the shadow of the rock her chin rest on
her hand and wait present as she sat she saw two men ride round
the base of the fell and strike off to the right toward a turfbooth
which stood the half of an hour ride awai now swanhild wa the
keenestsight of all women of her dai in iceland and when she look
at these two men she knew on of them for jon eric thrall and she
knew the hors alsoit wa a white hors with black patch that jon
had ridden for mani year she watch them go till thei came to the
booth and it seem to her that thei left their hors and enter
swanhild wait upon the side of the fell for nearli two hour in all
then hear a nois abov her she look up and there black with
dirt and wet with water wa gizur and with him wa the thrall
what luck gizur she ask
thi swanhild eric mai hold mosfel no more for we have found a wai
to bolt the fox
that is good new then said swanhild sai on
yonder hole swanhild lead to the cleft abov have been cut
through the cliff by fire or perhap by water now up that cleft a man
mai climb though hardli as by a difficult stair till he come to the
flat crest of the fell then cross the crest on the further side
perhap six fathom below him he see that space of rock where is
eric cave but he cannot see the cave itself becaus the brow of the
cliff hang over and so it is that if ani come from the cave on to the
space of rock it will be an easi matter to roll stone upon them from
abov and crush them
now when swanhild heard thi she laugh aloud
eric shall mock us no more she said and hi might can avail noth
against rock roll on him from abov let us go back to coldback and
summon men to make an end of brightey
so thei went on down the mountain till thei came to the place where thei
had hidden their hors then swanhild rememb jon and the other man
whom she had seen ride to the booth and she told gizur of them
now she said we will snare these bird and perchanc thei will
twitter tide when we squeez them
so thei turn and rode for the booth and draw near thei saw two
hors graze without now thei got off their hors and creep up
to the booth look in through the door which wa ajar and thei saw
thi that on man sat on the ground with hi back to the door eat
stockfish while jon made bundl of fish and meal readi to tie on the
hors for it wa here that those of hi quarter who love eric brought
food to be carri by hi men to the cave on mosfel
now swanhild touch gizur on the arm point first to the man who sat
eat the fish and then to the spear in gizur hand gizur thought a
while for he shrank from thi deed
then swanhild whisper in hi ear slai the man and seiz the other i
would learn tide from him
so gizur cast the spear and it pass through the man heart and he
wa dead at onc then he and the thrall leapt into the booth and threw
themselv on jon hurl him to the ground and hold sword over
him now jon wa a man of small heart and when he saw hi plight and
hi fellow dead he wa afraid and prai for merci
if i spare thee knave said swanhild thou shalt do thi thou shalt
lead me up mosfel to speak with eric
i mai not do that ladi groan jon for eric is not on mosfel
where is he then ask swanhild
now jon saw that he had said an unlucki thing and answer
nai i know not last night he rode from mosfel with skallagrim
lambstail
thou liest knave said swanhild speak or thou shalt be slain
slai on groan jon glanc at the sword abov him and shut
hi ey for though he fear much to die he had no will to make
known eric plan
look not at the sword thou shalt not die so easili hearken speak
and speak truli or thou shalt seek hela lap after thi fashion and
bend down she whisper in hi ear then laugh aloud
now jon grew faint with fear hi lip turn blue and hi teeth
chatter at the thought of how he should be made to die still he
would sai noth
then swanhild spoke to gizur and the thrall and bade them bind him with
a rope tear the garment from him and bring snow thei did thi and
push the matter to the draw of knive but when he saw the steel
jon cri aloud that he would tell all
now thou takest good counsel said swanhild
then in hi fear jon told how eric had gone down to middalhof to wed
gudruda and thenc to fly with her to england
now swanhild wa mad with wrath for she had sooner di than that thi
should come about
let us awai she said to gizur but first kill thi man
nai said gizur i will not do that he ha told hi tide let him
go free
thou art chickenheart said swanhild who after the fashion of
witch had no merci in her at the least he shall not go henc to
warn eric and gudruda of our come if thou wilt not kill him then
bind him and leav him
so jon wa bound and there in the booth he sat two dai befor anyon
came to loos him
whither awai said gizur to swanhild
to middalhof first swanhild answer
xxix
how went the bridal night
now eric and gudruda sat silent in the high seat of the hall at
middalhof till thei heard skallagrim enter by the women door then
thei came down from the high seat and stood hand in hand by the fire
on the hearth skallagrim greet gudruda look at her askanc for

the world truli and that wa eric brightey hi lord now he knew

storeroom except for a littl line of light that crept through the
crack of the shutter at length he could bear the dark and hi
thought no longer but rise threw the shutter wide and let the
bright moonlight pour into the chamber whenc he could see the hillsid
behind and watch the shadow of the cloud as thei float across it
again skallagrim sat down against hi cask and as he sat it move and

brightey lie in their barrow or ar pick by raven on the mountain
side gizur will not troubl to hunt out those who clung to him if
inde gizur shall live to tell the tale nor need ye fear the hate of
swanhild for she aim her spear at me alon go therefor and when
i am dead do not forget me and do not seek to aveng me for death the
aveng of all will find them also
now eric men heard and groan aloud sai that thei would die with
him for thei love eric on and all onli skallagrim said noth
then brightey spoke again hear me comrad if ye will not go my
blood will be on your head for i will ride out alon and meet the men
of gizur in the plain and fall there fight
then on by on thei crept awai to seek their hors in the dell and
each man as he went came to eric and kiss hi hand then pass thenc
weep jon wa the last to go except skallagrim onli and he wa so
move that he could not speak at all
it wa thi jon who in after year when he wa grown veri old
wander from stead to stead tell the deed of eric brightey and
alwai find a welcom becaus of hi tale till at length as he
journei he wa overtaken by a snowstorm and buri in a drift for
jon who lack much had thi gift he had a skald tongu men have
alwai held that it wa to the honour of jon that he told the tale thu
hide noth see that some of it is against himself
now when all had gone eric look at skallagrim who still stood near
him ax in hand
wherefor goest thou not drunkard he said sure thou wilt find
al and mead in the vale or oversea here there is none hasten i
would be alon
now the great bodi of skallagrim shook with grief and shame and the red
blood pour up beneath hi dark sin then he spoke in a thick voic
i did not think to live to hear such word from the lip of eric
brightey thei ar well earn yet it is unmanli of thee lord thu
to taunt on who love thee i would sooner die as swanhild said yonder
thrall should die than live to listen to such word i have sin
against thee inde and becaus of my sin my heart is broken hast
thou then never sin that thou wouldst tear it live from my breast
as eagl tear a founder hors think on thine own sin eric and
piti mine taunt me thu onc more or bid me go onc more and i will go

overcom me by thy nake might and there i swore fealti to thee eric
brightey mani a year have we wander side by side and stand

lord yet if still thou biddest me i will go thu where i swore my
oath to thee there i will end it for i will lai me down on the brink
of yonder gulf as onc i lai when thy hand wa at my throat and call
out that thou art no more my lord and i am no more thy thrall then i
will roll into the depth beneath and by thi death of shame thou shalt
be freed of me eric brightey
eric look at the great manh look long and sadli then he spoke
skallagrim lambstail thou hast a true heart i too have sin and
now i put awai thy sin although gudruda is dead through thee and i must
die becaus of thee stai by me if thou wilt and let us fall togeth
then skallagrim came to eric and kneel befor him took hi hand
and kiss them
now i am onc more a man he said and i know thi we two shall die
such a great death that it will be well to have live to die it and he
aros and shout
a hai a hai i see foe pass in pride
a hai a hai valkyri ride the wind
hear the song of the sword
whitefir is aloftaloft
bare is the ax of the baresark
croak ye nest raven
flap your wing ye eagl
for bright is mosfel cave with blood
lap lap thou grei wolf
laugh aloud odin
laugh till shake the golden door
hero feet ar set on bifrost
open ye hundr gate
a hai a hai red run the frai
a hai a hai valkyri ride the wind
then skallagrim turn and went to clean hi har and the golden helm
of eric
now at coldback gizur spoke with swanhild
thou hast brought the greatest shame upon me he said for thou hast
caus me to slai a sleep woman knowest thou that my own men will
scarc speak with me i have come to thi evil pass through love of
thee that i have slain a sleep woman
it wa not my fault that thou didst kill gudruda answer swanhild
sure i thought it wa eric whom thy sword pierc i have not sought
thy love gizur and i sai thi to thee go if thou wilt and leav me
alon
now gizur look at her and wa mind to go but as swanhild knew
well she held him too fast in the net of her witcheri
i would go if i might go answer gizur but i am bound to thee for
good or evil sinc it is fate that i shall wed thee
thou wilt never wed me while eric live said swanhild
now she spoke thu truthfulli and by chanc as it were not as drive
gizur on to slai ericfor now that gudruda wa dead she wa in two
mind as to thi matter sinc if she might she still desir to take
eric to herselfbut mean that while eric live she would wed no
other man but gizur took it otherwis
eric shall certainli die if i mai bring it about he answer and
went to speak with hi men
now all were gather in the yard at coldback and that wa a great
compani but their look were heavi becaus of the shame that gizur
ospakar son had brought upon them by the murder of gudruda in her
sleep
hearken comrad said gizur great shame is come upon me becaus of
a deed that i have done unwittingli for i aim at the eagl eric and i
have slain the swan gudruda
then a certain old vike in the compani name ketel whom gizur had
hire for the slai of eric spoke
man or woman it is a nidder deed to kill folk in their sleep
gizur it is murder and no less and small luck can be hope for from
the stroke
now gizur felt that hi peopl look on him askanc and heavili and
knew that it would be hard to show them that he wa driven to thi deed
against hi will and by the witchcraft of swanhild so as wa hi
natur he turn to guil for shelter like a fox to hi hole and
spoke to them with the tongu of a lawman for gizur had great skill in
speech
that tale wa not all true which eric brightey told you he said
he wa mad with grief and moreov it seem that he slept and onli
woke to find gudruda dead it came about thu i stood with the ladi
swanhild and wa about to call aloud on eric to arm himself and come
forth and meet me face to face
then lord methink thou hadst never met anoth foe quoth the
vike ketel who had spoken first
when of a sudden went on gizur take no note of ketel word on
cloth in white sprang from the bed and rush on me then i think
that it wa eric lift sword not to smite but to ward him awai but
the linenwear met the sword and fell down dead then i fled fear
lest men should wake and trap us and that is all the tale it wa no
fault of mine if gudruda di upon the sword
thu he spoke but still men look doubtfulli upon him for hi ey wa
the ey of a liarand eric as thei knew did not lie
it is hard to find the truth between lawman brain and tongu said
the old vike ketel eric is no lawman but a true man and he sang
anoth song i would slai eric inde for between him and me there is
a bloodfeud sinc my brother di at hi hand when with whitefir
for a crook brightey drove arm men like sheep down the hall of
middalhofai and swordless slew ospakar yet i sai that eric is a
true man and whether or no thou art true gizur the lawman that thou
knowest bestthou and swanhild the fatherless groa daughter if thou
didst slai gudruda as thou tellest sai how come gudruda blood on
whitefir blade how did it chanc gizur that thou heldest whitefir
in thy hand and not thine own sword now i tell thee thi either thou
shalt go up against eric and clear thyself by blow or i leav thee
and methink there ar other among thi compani who will do the same
for we have no wish to be partner with murder and their wicked
ay a good word said mani who stood by let gizur go up with us to
mosfel and there stand face to face with eric and clear himself by
blow
i ask no more said gizur we will ride tonight
but much more shalt thou get liar quoth ketel to himself for that
hour when thou lookest onc again on whitefir shall be thy last
so gizur and swanhild made readi to go up against eric that dai thei
rode awai with a great compani a hundr and on in all and thi wa
their plan thei sent six men with that thrall who had shown them the
secret path bid him guid them to the mountaintop then when thei
were come thither and heard the shout of those who sought to gain the
platform from the south thei were to watch till eric and hi folk came
out from the cave and shoot them with arrow from abov or crush them
with stone but if perchanc eric left the platform and came to meet
hi foe in the narrow pass then thei must let themselv down with
rope from the height abov and creep after him round the rock
must smite him in the back moreov in secret gizur promis a great
reward of ten hundr in silver to him who should kill eric for he did
not long to stand face to face with him alon swanhild also in secret
made promis of reward to those who should bring eric to her bound but
live and she bade them do thisto bear him down with shield and tie
him with rope
so thei rode awai the seven who should climb the mountain from behind
go first and on the morrow morn thei cross the sand and came to
mosfel
xxxii
how eric and skallagrim grew fei
now the night came down upon mosfel and of all night thi wa the
strangest the air wa quiet and heavi yet no rain fell it wa so
silent moreov that did a stone slip upon the mountain side or a
hors neigh far off on the plain the sound of it crept up the fell and
wa echo from the crag
eric and skallagrim sat togeth on the open space of rock that is
befor the cave and great heavi and fear came into their heart so
that thei had no desir to sleep
methink the night is ghostridden said eric and i am fei for i
grow cold and it seem to me that on stroke my hair
it is ghostridden lord answer skallagrim troll ar abroad and
the godkind gather to see eric die
for a while thei sat in silenc then suddenli the mountain heav up
gentli beneath them thrice it seem to heav like a woman breast
and left them frighten
now the dwarffolk come from their cave quoth skallagrim and great
deed mai be look for sinc thei ar not drawn to the upper earth by
a littl thing
then onc more thei sat silent and thick dark came down upon the
mountain hide the star
look said eric of a sudden and he point to hecla
skallagrim look and lo the snowi dome of hecla wa aglow with a rosi
flame like the light of dawn
winter light said lambstail shudder
death light answer eric look again
thei look and behold in the rosi glow there sat three giant form of
fire and their shape were the shape of women befor them wa a loom
of black that stretch from earth to sky and thei wove at it with
thread of flame thei were splendid and terribl to see their
hair stream behind them like meteor flame their ey shone like
lightn and their breast gleam like the polish buckler of the
god thei wove fierc at the loom of black and as thei wove thei
sang the voic of the on wa as the wind whistl through the pine
the voic of the other wa as the sound of rain hiss on deep water
and the voic of the third wa as the moan of the sea thei wove
fearfulli and thei sang loudli but what thei sang might not be known
now the web grew and the woof grew and a pictur came upon the looma
great pictur written in fire
behold it wa the semblanc of a stormawaken sea and a giant ship
fled befor the galea dragon of war and in the ship were pile the
cors of men and on these lai anoth cors as on li upon a bed
thei look and the face of the cors grew bright it wa the face of
eric and hi head rest upon the dead heart of skallagrim
cling to each other eric and skallagrim saw the sight of fear that
wa written on the loom of the norn thei saw it for a breath then
with a laugh like the wail of wolv the shape of fire sprang up
and rent the web asund then the first pass upward to the sky the
second southward toward middalhof but the third swept over mosfel so
that the bright of her flame form shone on the rock where thei sat
by the cave and the lightn of her ey wa mirror in the byrni of
skallagrim and on eric golden helm she swept past point downward
as she went and lo she wa gone and onc more dark and silenc
lai upon the earth
now thi sight wa seen of jon the thrall also and he told it in
hi stori of the deed of eric for jon lai hid in a secret place on
mosfel wait for tide of what came to pass
for a while eric and skallagrim clung to each other then skallagrim
spoke
we have seen the valkyri he said
nai answer eric we have seen the nornswho ar come to warn us
of our doom we shall die tomorrow
at the least said skallagrim we shall not die alon we had a
goodli bed on yonder goblin ship and all of our own slai methink
it is not so ill to die thu lord
not so ill said eric and yet i am weari of blood and war of glori
and of my strength now i desir rest alon light firei can bear thi
dark no longer the marrow freez in my bone
fire can be seen of foe said skallagrim
it matter littl now said eric we ar feyfolk
so skallagrim light the fire pile much brushwood and dry turf over
it till present it burnt up brightli throw light on all the space
of rock and heavi shadow against the cliff behind thei sat thu a
while in the light of the flame look toward the deep gulf till
suddenli there came a sound as of on who climb the gulf
who come now climb where no man mai pass cri eric seiz
whitefir and spring to hi feet present he sank down again with
white face and stare ey and point at the edg of the cliff and
as he point the neck of a man rose in the shadow abov the brink and
the hand of a man grasp the rock but there wa no head on the neck
the shape of the headless man drew itself slowli over the brink it
walk slowli into the light toward the fire then sat itself down in
the glare of the flame which shrank awai from it as from a draught of
wind pale with terror eric and skallagrim look on the headless
thing and knew it it wa the wraith of the baresark that brightey had
slainth first of all the men he slew
it is my mate eric whom thou didst kill year ago and whose sever
head spoke with thee gasp skallagrim
it is he sure enough said eric but where mai hi head be
perchanc the head will come answer skallagrim he is an evil
sight to see sure sai lord shall i fall upon him though i love
not the task
nai skallagrim let him bide he doe but come to warn us of our fate
moreov ghost can onli be laid in on waybi the hew off of the
head and the lai of it at the thigh but thi on ha no head to
hew
now as he spoke the headless man turn hi neck as though to look
onc more there came the sound of feet and lo men march in from the
dark on either side eric and skallagrim look up and knew them
thei were those of ospakar folk whom thei had slain on horsehead
height all their wound were on them and in front of them march
mord ospakar son the ghost gaze upon eric and skallagrim with cold
dead ey then thei too sat down by the fire now onc more there came
the sound of feet and from everi side men pour in who had di at the
hand of eric and skallagrim first came those who fell on that ship of
ospakar which eric sank by westman then the crew of the raven who
had perish upon the seapath even as the man di so did each ghost
come some had been drown and their har drip water some had
di of spearthrust and the spear were yet fix in their breast
some had fallen beneath the flash of whitefir and the weight of the ax
of skallagrim and there thei sat look on their wide wound
then came more and more there were those whom eric and skallagrim had
slain upon the sea those who had fallen befor them in the english
war and all that compani who had been drown in the water of the
pentland firth when the witchcraft of swanhild had brought the gudruda
to her wreck
now here we have a goodli crew said eric at length is it done
thinkest thou or will mosfel send forth more dead
as he spoke the wraith of a greyhead man drew near he had but on
arm for the other wa hewn from him and the byrni on hi left side
wa red with blood
welcom earl atli cri eric sit thou over against me who
tomorrow shall be with thee
the ghost of the earl seat itself and look on eric with sad ey
but it spake never a word
then came anoth compani and at their head stalk black ospakar
these be thei who di at middalhof cri eric welcom ospakar
that marriagefeast of thine went ill
now methink we ar overdon with troll said skallagrim but see
here come more
as he spoke hall of lithdal came and with him koll the halfwit
and other and so it went on till all the men whom eric and skallagrim
had slain or who had di becaus of them or at their side were
gather in deep rank befor them
now it is sure done said eric
there is yet a space said skallagrim point to the other side of
the fire and hell hold mani dead
even as the word left hi lip there came a nois of the gallop of
hors hoof and on clad in white rode up it wa a woman for her
golden hair flow down about her white arm then she slid from the
hors and stood in the light of the fire and behold her white robe
wa red with blood a great sword wa set in her heart and the face and
ey were the face and ey of gudruda the fair and the hors she rode
wa blackman that eric had slain
now when brightey saw her he gave a great cry
greet sweet he said i am no longer afraid sinc thou comest to
bear me compani thou art dear to my sightai even in yon deathsheet
greet sweet my mai i laid thee stiff and cold in the earth at
middalhof but like a love wife thou hast burst thy bond and art
come to save me from the grip of troll thou art welcom gudruda
asmund daughter come wife sit thou at my side
the ghost of gudruda spake no word she walk through the fire toward
him and the flame went out beneath her feet to burn up again when she
had pass then she sat down over against eric and look on him with
wide and tender ey thrice he stretch out hi arm to clasp her but
thrice their strength left them and thei fell back to hi side it wa
as though thei struck a wall of ic and were numb by the bitter cold
look here ar more groan skallagrim
then eric look and lo the empti space to the left of the fire wa
fill with shadowi shape like shape of mist amongst them wa gizur
ospakar son and mani a man of hi compani there too wa swanhild
groa daughter and a toad nestl in her breast she look with wide
ey upon the ey of dead gudruda ghost that seem not to see her
and a stare of fear wa set on her love face nor wa thi all for
there befor that shadowi throng stood two great shape clad in their
har and on wa the shape of eric and on the shape of skallagrim
thu be yet aliv did these two look upon their own wraith
then eric and skallagrim cri out aloud and their brain swam and their
sens left them so that thei swoon
when thei open their ey and life came back to them the fire wa
dead and it wa dai nor wa there ani sign of that compani which had
been gather on the rock befor them
skallagrim quoth eric it seem that i have dream a strang
dreama most strang dream of norn and troll
tell me thy dream lord said skallagrim
so eric told all the vision and the baresark listen in silenc
it wa no dream lord said skallagrim for i myself have seen the
same thing now thi is in my mind that yonder sun is the last that
we shall see for we have beheld the deathshadow all those who were
gather here last night wait to welcom us on bifrost bridg and the
mistshap who sat there amongst whom our wraith were number ar
the shape of those who shall die in the great fight todai for dai
ar fled and we ar sped
i would not have it otherwis said eric we have been greatli
honour of the god and of the ghostkind that ar around us and abov
us now let us make readi to die as becom men who have never turn
back to blow for the end of the stori should fit the begin and of
us there is a tale to tell
a good word lord answer skallagrim i have struck few stroke to
be shame of and i do not fear to tread bifrost bridg in thy compani
now we will wash ourselv and eat so that our strength mai be whole in
us
so thei wash themselv with water and at merrili and for the first
time for mani month eric wa merri for now that the end wa at hand
hi heart grew light within him and when thei had put the desir of
food from them and buckl on their har thei look out from their
mountain height and saw a cloud of dust rise in the desert plain of
black sand beneath and through it the sheen of spear
here come those of whom if there is truth in vision some few
shall never go back again said eric now what counsel hast thou
skallagrim where shall we meet them here on the space of rock or
yonder in the deep wai of the cliff
my counsel is that we meet them here said skallagrim and cut them
down on by on as thei try to turn the rock thei can scarc come at
us to slai us here so long as our arm have strength to smite
yet thei will come though i know not how answer eric for i am
sure of thi that our death li befor us here then we will meet
them
now the cloud of dust drew nearer and thei saw that thi wa a great
compani which came up against them at the foot of the fell the men
stai and rest a while and it wa not till afternoon that thei began
to climb the mountain
night will be at hand befor the game is plai said skallagrim
see thei climb slowli save their strength and yonder among them is
swanhild in a purpl cloak
ay night will be at hand skallagrima last long night a hundr to
twoth odd ar heavi yet some shall wish them heavier now let us
bind on our helm
meanwhil gizur and hi folk crept up the path from below now that
thrall who knew the secret wai had gone on with six chosen men and
alreadi thei climb the watercours and drew near to the flat crest of
the fell but eric and skallagrim knew noth of thi so thei sat down
by the turn place that is over the gulf and wait sing of the
take of the raven and of the slai in the stead at middalhof and
tell tale of deed that thei had done and the thrall and hi six
men climb on till at length thei gain the crest of the fell and
look over saw eric and skallagrim beneath them
the bird ar in the snare and hark thei sing said the thrall now
bring rock and be silent
but gizur and hi peopl have learn that eric and skallagrim were
alon upon the mountain push on
we have not much to fear from two men said gizur
that we shall learn present answer swanhild i tell thee thi
that i saw strang sight last night though i did not sleep i mai
sleep littl now that gudruda is dead for that which i saw in her ey
haunt me
then thei went on and the face of gizur grew white with fear
xxxiii
how eric and skallagrim fought their last great fight
now the thrall and those with him on the crest of the fell heard the
murmur of the compani of gizur and swanhild as thei won the mountain
side though thei could not see them becaus of the rock
now it is time to begin and knock these bird from their perch said
the thrall for that is an awkward corner for our folk to turn with
whitefir and the ax of skallagrim wait on the farther side
so he balanc a great stone as heavi as three men could lift on the
brow of the rock and aim it then he push and let it go it smote
the platform beneath with a crash two fathom behind the spot where
eric and skallagrim sat then it flew into the air and just as
brightey turn at the sound it struck the wing of hi helm and
burst the strap tore the golden helmpiec from hi head and
carri it awai into the gulf beneath
skallagrim look up and saw what had come about
thei have gain the crest of the fell he cri now we must fly
into the cave or down the narrow wai and hold it
down the narrow wai then said eric and while rock spear and
arrow rush between and around them thei step on to the stone and
won the path beyond it wa clear for gizur folk had not yet come
and thei ran nearli to the mouth of it where there wa a bend in the
wai and stood there side by side
thou wast at death door then lord said skallagrim
headpiec is not head answer eric but i wonder how thei won the
crest of the fell i have never heard tell of ani path by which it might
be gain
there thei ar at the least said skallagrim now thi is my will
that thou shouldst take my helm i am baresark and put littl trust in
har but rather in my ax and strength alon
i will not do that said eric listen i hear them come
present the tumult of voic and the tramp of feet grew clearer and
after a while gizur swanhild and the men of their follow turn
the corner of the narrow wai and lo there befor themai within three
pace of themstood eric and skallagrim shoulder to shoulder and the
light pour down upon them from abov
thei were terribl to see and the light shone brightli on eric golden
hair and whitefir flash blade and the shadow lai dark on the
black helm of skallagrim and in the fierc black ey beneath
back surg gizur and those with him skallagrim would have sprung upon
them but eric caught him by the arm sai a truce to thy baresark
wai rush not and move not let us stand here till thei overwhelm us
now those behind gizur cri out to know what ail them that thei
push back
onli thi said gizur that eric brightey and skallagrim lambstail
stand like two grei wolv and hold the narrow wai
now we shall have fight worth the tell of quoth ketel the
vike on gizur ospakar son and cut them down
hold said swanhild i will speak with eric first and togeth
with gizur and ketel she pass round the corner of the path and came
face to face with those who stood at bai there
now yield eric she cri foe ar behind and befor thee thou
art trap and hast littl chanc of life yield thee i sai with thy
black wolfhound so perchanc thou mayest find merci even at the hand
of her whose husband thou didst wrong and slai
it is not my wai to yield ladi answer eric and still less
perchanc is it the wai of skallagrim least of all will we yield to
thee who after work mani ill didst throw me in a witchsleep and
to him who slew the wife sleep at my side hearken swanhild here
we stand await death nor will we take merci from thy hand for know
thi we shall not die alon last night as we sat on mosfel we saw
the norn weav our web of fate upon their loom of dark thei sat on
helca dome and wove their pictur in live flame then rent the web
and flew upward and southward and westward cry our doom to sky
and earth and sea last night as we sat by the fire on mosfel all the
compani of the dead were gather round usai and all the compani
of those who shall die todai thou wast there gizur the murder
ospakar son thou wast there swanhild the witch groa daughter
thou wast there ketel vike with mani anoth man and there were we
two also valkyri have kiss us and death draw near therefor talk
no more but come and make an end greet gizur thou womanmurder
draw nigh draw nigh out sword up shield and on thou son of
ospakar
swanhild spoke no more and gizur had no word
on gizur eric call thee quoth ketel vike but gizur slunk back
not forward
then ketel grew mad with rage and shame he call to the men and thei
drew near as mani as might and look doubtfulli at the pair who stood
befor them like rock upon a plain eric laugh aloud and skallagrim
gnaw the edg of hi shield eric laugh aloud and the sound of hi
laughter ran up the rock
we ar but two he cri and ye ar mani is there never a pair
among you will stand face to face with a baresark and a helmless man
and he toss whitefir high into the air and caught it by the hilt
then ketel and anoth man of hi follow sprang forward with an oath
and their ax thunder loud on the shield of eric and of skallagrim
but whitefir flicker up and the ax of skallagrim crash and at
onc their knee were loosen so that thei sank down dead
more men more men cri eric these were brave but their might wa
littl more men for the grei wolf maw
then swanhild lash the folk with bitter word and two of them sprang
on thei sprang on like hound upon a deer at bai and thei roll back
as gore hound roll from the deer horn
more men more men cri eric here lie but four and a hundr press
behind now he shall win great honour who lai brightey low and bring
down the helm of skallagrim
again two came on but thei found no luck for present thei also were
down upon the bodi of those who went befor now none could be found
to come up against the pair for thei fought like baldur and thor and
none could touch them and no har might withstand the weight of
their blow that shore through shield and helm and byrni deep to the
bone beneath then eric and skallagrim lean upon their weapon and
mock their foe while these curs and tore their beard with rage
and shame
now it is to be told that when the thrall and those with him saw eric
and skallagrim had escap their rock and spear thei took counsel
and the end of it wa that thei slid down a rope to the platform that is
under the crest of the fell thenc though thei could see noth thei
could hear the clang of blow and the shout of those who fought and
fellai and the mock of eric and of skallagrim
now it goe thu said the thrall who wa a cun man eric and
skallagrim hold the narrow wai and none can stand against them thi
then is my rede that we turn the rock and take them in the back
hi fellow thought thi a good sai and on by on thei stood upon
the littl rock and won the narrow wai thei crept along thi till thei
were near to eric and skallagrim now swanhild look up saw them and
start skallagrim note thi and glanc over hi shoulder and that
not too soon for as he look the thrall lift sword to smite the
head of eric
with a shout of back to back the baresark swung round and er ever
the sword might fall hi ax wa buri deep in the thrall breast
now we must cut our path through them said skallagrim and if it
mai be win the space that is befor the cave keep them off in front
and i will mind these mannikin
now gizur folk see what had come about took heart and fell upon
eric with a rush and those who were with the dead thrall rush at
