i have just buri my boi my poor handsom boi of whom i wa
so proud and my heart is broken it is veri hard have onli
on son to lose him thu but god will be done who am i that
i should complain the great wheel of fate roll on like a juggernaut
and crush us all in turn some soon some late it doe not
matter when in the end it crush us all we do not prostrat
ourselv befor it like the poor indian we fly hither and
thither we cry for merci but it is of no us the black fate
thunder on and in it season reduc us to powder
poor harri to go so soon just when hi life wa open to
him he wa do so well at the hospit he had pass hi
last examin with honour and i wa proud of them much
prouder than he wa i think and then he must need go to that
smallpox hospit he wrote to me that he wa not afraid of
smallpox and want to gain the experi and now the diseas
ha kill him and i old and grei and wither am left to
mourn over him without a chick or child to comfort me i might
have save him too i have monei enough for both of us and
much more than enough king solomon mine provid me with
that but i said no let the boi earn hi live let him labour
that he mai enjoi rest but the rest ha come to him befor
the labour oh my boi my boi
i am like the man in the bibl who laid up much good and build
barn good for my boi and barn for him to store them in
and now hi soul ha been requir of him and i am left desol
i would that it had been my soul and not my boi
we buri him thi afternoon under the shadow of the grei and
ancient tower of the church of thi villag where my hous is
it wa a dreari decemb afternoon and the sky wa heavi with
snow but not much wa fall the coffin wa put down by the
grave and a few big flake lit upon it thei look veri white
upon the black cloth there wa a littl hitch about get
the coffin down into the grave the necessari rope had been
forgotten so we drew back from it and wait in silenc watch
the big flake fall gentli on by on like heavenli benedict
and melt in tear on harri pall but that wa not all a
robin redbreast came as bold as could be and lit upon the coffin
and began to sing and then i am afraid that i broke down and
so did sir henri curti strong man though he is and as for
captain good i saw him turn awai too even in my own distress
i could not help notic it
the abov sign allan quatermain is an extract from my diari
written two year and more ago i copi it down here becaus
it seem to me that it is the fittest begin to the histori
that i am about to write if it pleas god to spare me to finish
it if not well it doe not matter that extract wa pen
seven thousand mile or so from the spot where i now lie painfulli
and slowli write thi with a pretti girl stand by my side
fan the fli from my august counten harri is there
and i am here and yet somehow i cannot help feel that i am
not far off harri
when i wa in england i us to live in a veri fine hous
at least i call it a fine hous speak compar and
judg from the standard of the hous i have been accustom
to all my life in africa not five hundr yard from the old
church where harri is asleep and thither i went after the funer
and at some food for it is no good starv even if on ha
just buri all on earthli hope but i could not eat much
and soon i took to walk or rather limp be perman
lame from the bite of a lion up and down up and down the
oakpanel vestibul for there is a vestibul in my hous
in england on all the four wall of thi vestibul were place
pair of horn about a hundr pair altogeth all of which
i had shot myself thei ar beauti specimen as i never
keep ani horn which ar not in everi wai perfect unless it
mai be now and again on account of the associ connect
with them in the centr of the room howev over the wide
fireplac there wa a clear space left on which i had fix
up all my rifl some of them i have had for forti year old
muzzleload that nobodi would look at nowadai on wa an
eleph gun with strip of rimpi or green hide lash round
the stock and lock such as us to be own by the dutchmen
a roer thei call it that gun the boer i bought it from
mani year ago told me had been us by hi father at the battl
of the blood river just after dingaan swept into natal and slaughter
six hundr men women and children so that the boer name
the place where thei di weenen or the place of weep
and so it is call to thi dai and alwai will be call
and mani an eleph have i shot with that old gun she alwai
took a hand of black powder and a threeounc ball and kick
like the veri deuc
well up and down i walk stare at the gun and the horn
which the gun had brought low and as i did so there rose up
in me a great crave i would go awai from thi place where
i live idli and at eas back again to the wild land where i
had spent my life where i met my dear wife and poor harri wa
born and so mani thing good bad and indiffer had happen
to me the thirst for the wilder wa on me i could toler
thi place no more i would go and die as i had live among
the wild game and the savag ye as i walk i began to
long to see the moonlight gleam silveri white over the wide
veldt and mysteri sea of bush and watch the line of game
travel down the ridg to the water the rule passion
is strong in death thei sai and my heart wa dead that night
but independ of my troubl no man who ha for forti year
live the life i have can with impun go coop himself in thi
prim english countri with it trim hedgerow and cultiv
field it stiff formal manner and it welldress crowd
he begin to long ah how he long for the keen breath
of the desert air he dream of the sight of zulu impi break
on their foe like surf upon the rock and hi heart rise up
in rebellion against the strict limit of the civil life
ah thi civil what doe it all come to for forti year
and more i live among savag and studi them and their wai
and now for sever year i have live here in england and have
in my own stupid manner done my best to learn the wai of the
children of light and what have i found a great gulf fix
no onli a veri littl on that a plain man thought mai spring
across i sai that as the savag is so is the white man onli
the latter is more invent and possess the faculti of combin
save and except also that the savag as i have known him is
to a larg extent free from the greed of monei which eat like
a cancer into the heart of the white man it is a depress
conclus but in all essenti the savag and the child of
civil ar ident i dare sai that the highli civil
ladi read thi will smile at an old fool of a hunter simplic
when she think of her black beadbedeck sister and so will
the superfin cultur idler scientif eat a dinner at
hi club the cost of which would keep a starv famili for
a week and yet my dear young ladi what ar those pretti thing
round your own neck thei have a strong famili resembl
especi when you wear that veri low dress to the savag woman
bead your habit of turn round and round to the sound of
horn and tomtom your fond for pigment and powder the
wai in which you love to subjug yourself to the rich warrior
who ha captur you in marriag and the quick with which
your tast in feather headdress vari all these thing
suggest touch of kinship and you rememb that in the fundament
principl of your natur you ar quit ident as for you
sir who also laugh let some man come and strike you in the
face whilst you ar enjoi that marvellouslook dish and
we shall soon see how much of the savag there is in you
there i might go on for ever but what is the good civil
is onli savageri silvergilt a vainglori is it and like a
northern light come but to fade and leav the sky more dark
out of the soil of barbar it ha grown like a tree and
as i believ into the soil like a tree it will onc more sooner
or later fall again as the egyptian civil fell as the
hellen civil fell and as the roman civil and
mani other of which the world ha now lost count fell also
do not let me howev be understood as decri our modern
institut repres as thei do the gather experi
of human appli for the good of all of cours thei have
great advantag hospit for instanc but then rememb
we breed the sickli peopl who fill them in a savag land thei
do not exist besid the question will aris how mani of
these bless ar due to christian as distinct from civil
and so the balanc swai and the stori run here a gain
there a loss and natur great averag struck across the two
whereof the sum total form on of the factor in that mighti
equat in which the result will equal the unknown quantiti
of her purpos
i make no apolog for thi digress especi as thi is
an introduct which all young peopl and those who never like
to think and it is a bad habit will natur skip it seem
to me veri desir that we should sometim try to understand
the limit of our natur so that we mai not be carri
awai by the pride of knowledg man clever is almost indefinit
and stretch like an elast band but human natur is like
an iron ring you can go round and round it you can polish
it highli you can even flatten it a littl on on side wherebi
you will make it bulg out the other but you will never while
the world endur and man is man increas it total circumfer
it is the on fix unchang thing fix as the star
more endur than the mountain as unalter as the wai of
the etern human natur is god kaleidoscop and the littl
bit of colour glass which repres our passion hope fear
joi aspir toward good and evil and what not ar turn
in hi mighti hand as sure and as certainli as it turn the
star and continu fall into new pattern and combin
but the compos element remain the same nor will there be
on more bit of colour glass nor on less for ever and ever
thi be so suppos for the sake of argument we divid ourselv
into twenti part nineteen savag and on civil we must
look to the nineteen savag portion of our natur if we would
realli understand ourselv and not to the twentieth which
though so insignific in realiti is spread all over the other
nineteen make them appear quit differ from what thei realli
ar as the black doe a boot or the veneer a tabl it
is on the nineteen rough servic savag portion that we
fall back on emerg not on the polish but unsubstanti
twentieth civil should wipe awai our tear and yet
we weep and cannot be comfort warfar is abhorr to her
and yet we strike out for hearth and home for honour and fair
fame and can glori in the blow and so on through everyth
so when the heart is stricken and the head is humbl in the
dust civil fail us utterli back back we creep and
lai us like littl children on the great breast of natur she
that perchanc mai sooth us and make us forget or at least
rid remembr of it sting who ha not in hi great grief
felt a long to look upon the outward featur of the univers
mother to lie on the mountain and watch the cloud drive across
the sky and hear the roller break in thunder on the shore to
let hi poor struggl life mingl for a while in her life
to feel the slow beat of her etern heart and to forget hi
woe and let hi ident be swallow in the vast impercept
move energi of her of whom we ar from whom we came and with
whom we shall again be mingl who gave us birth and will in
a dai to come give us our burial also
and so in my troubl as i walk up and down the oakpanel
vestibul of my hous there in yorkshir i long onc more
to throw myself into the arm of natur not the natur which
you know the natur that wave in wellkept wood and smile
out in cornfield but natur as she wa in the ag when creation
wa complet undefil as yet by ani human sink of swelter
human i would go again where the wild game wa back to
the land whereof none know the histori back to the savag
whom i love although some of them ar almost as merciless as
polit economi there perhap i should be abl to learn
to think of poor harri ly in the churchyard without feel
as though my heart would break in two
and now there is an end of thi egotist talk and there shall
be no more of it but if you whose ey mai perchanc on dai
fall upon my written thought have got so far as thi i ask
you to persever sinc what i have to tell you is not without
it interest and it ha never been told befor nor will again
chapter i
the consul yarn
a week had pass sinc the funer of my poor boi harri and
on even i wa in my room walk up and down and think
when there wa a ring at the outer door go down the step
i open it myself and in came my old friend sir henri curti
and captain john good rn thei enter the vestibul and sat
themselv down befor the wide hearth where i rememb a
particularli good fire of log wa burn
it is veri kind of you to come round i said by wai of make
a remark it must have been heavi walk in the snow
thei said noth but sir henri slowli fill hi pipe and lit
it with a burn ember as he leant forward to do so the fire
got hold of a gassi bit of pine and flare up brightli throw
the whole scene into strong relief and i thought what a splendidlook
man he is calm power face clearcut featur larg grei
ey yellow beard and hair altogeth a magnific specimen
of the higher type of human nor did hi form beli hi face
i have never seen wider shoulder or a deeper chest inde
sir henri girth is so great that though he is six feet two
high he doe not strike on as a tall man as i look at him
i could not help think what a curiou contrast my littl driedup
self present to hi grand face and form imagin to yourself
a small wither yellowfac man of sixtythre with thin
hand larg brown ey a head of grizzl hair cut short and
stand up like a halfworn scrubbingbrush total weight
in my cloth nine stone six and you will get a veri fair
idea of allan quatermain commonli call hunter quatermain
or by the nativ macumazahn anglicchar e grave he who
keep a bright lookout at night or in vulgar english a sharp
fellow who is not to be taken in
then there wa good who is not like either of us be short
dark stout veri stout with twinkl black ey in on
of which an eyeglass is everlastingli fix i sai stout but
it is a mild term i regret to state that of late year good
ha been run to fat in a most disgrac wai sir henri
tell him that it come from idl and overfeed and
good doe not like it at all though he cannot deni it
we sat for a while and then i got a match and lit the lamp that
stood readi on the tabl for the halflight began to grow dreari
as it is apt to do when on ha a short week ago buri the hope
of on life next i open a cupboard in the wainscot
and got a bottl of whiski and some tumbler and water i alwai
like to do these thing for myself it is irrit to me to
have somebodi continu at my elbow as though i were an
eighteenmonthold babi all thi while curti and good had
been silent feel i suppos that thei had noth to sai
that could do me ani good and content to give me the comfort
of their presenc and unspoken sympathi for it wa onli their
second visit sinc the funer and it is by the wai from
the presenc of other that we realli deriv support in our dark
hour of grief and not from their talk which often onli serv
to irrit us befor a bad storm the game alwai herd togeth
but thei ceas their call
thei sat and smoke and drank whiski and water and i stood by
the fire also smoke and look at them
at last i spoke old friend i said how long is it sinc
we got back from kukuanaland

civil i am go back to the veldt
sir henri laid hi head back in hi armchair and laugh on

as good and i were walk up here we had a talk
if good wa there you probabl did i put in sarcast
for good is a great hand at talk and what mai it have been about

i have said good solemnli i never do anyth without
a reason and it isnt a ladi at least if it is it sever
i look at him again good is so overpoweringli frivol
what is it i said
well if you realli want to know though id rather not speak
of a delic and strictli person matter ill tell you im

shut up good said sir henri and now quatermain tell
us where do you propos go to
i lit my pipe which had gone out befor answer
have you peopl ever heard of mt kenia i ask
dont know the place said good
did you ever hear of the island of lamu i ask again
no stop though isnt it a place about 300 mile north of zanzibar
ye now listen what i have to propos is thi that we
go to lamu and thenc make our wai about 250 mile inland to
mt kenia from mt kenia on inland to mt lekakisera anoth 200
mile or thereabout beyond which no white man ha to the best
of my belief ever been and then if we get so far right on
into the unknown interior what do you sai to that my hearti
it a big order said sir henri reflect
you ar right i answer it is but i take it that we ar
all three of us in search of a big order we want a chang of
scene and we ar like to get on a thorough chang all
my life i have long to visit those part and i mean to do
it befor i die my poor boi death ha broken the last link
between me and civil and im off to my nativ wild
and now ill tell you anoth thing and that is that for year
and year i have heard rumour of a great white race which is
suppos to have it home somewher up in thi direct and
i have a mind to see if there is ani truth in them if you fellow
like to come well and good if not ill go alon
im your man though i dont believ in your white race said
sir henri curti rise and place hi arm upon my shoulder
ditto remark good ill go into train at onc by
all mean let go to mt kenia and the other place with an
unpronounc name and look for a white race that doe not exist
it all on to me
when do you propos to start ask sir henri
thi dai month i answer by the british india steamboat
and dont you be so certain that thing have no exist becaus
you do not happen to have heard of them rememb king solomon mine
some fourteen week or so had pass sinc the date of thi convers
and thi histori goe on it wai in veri differ surround
after much deliber and inquiri we came to the conclus
that our best startingpoint for mt kenia would be from the neighbourhood
of the mouth of the tana river and not from mombassa a place
over 100 mile nearer zanzibar thi conclus we arriv at
from inform given to us by a german trader whom we met upon
the steamer at aden i think that he wa the dirtiest german
i ever knew but he wa a good fellow and gave us a great deal
of valuabl inform lamu said he you goe to lamu
oh ze beauti place and he turn up hi fat face and
beam with mild raptur on year and a half i live there
and never chang my shirt never at all
and so it came to pass that on arriv at the island we disembark
with all our good and chattel and not know where to go
march boldli up to the hous of her majesti consul where
we were most hospit receiv
lamu is a veri curiou place but the thing which stand out
most clearli in my memori in connect with it ar it exceed
dirti and it smell these last ar simpli aw just
below the consul is the beach or rather a mud bank that is
call a beach it is left quit bare at low tide and serv
as a repositori for all the filth offal and refus of the town
here it is too that the women come to buri coconut in the
mud leav them there till the outer husk is quit rotten
when thei dig them up again and us the fibr to make mat with
and for variou other purpos as thi process ha been go
on for gener the condit of the shore can be better
imagin than describ i have smelt mani evil odour in the
cours of my life but the concentr essenc of stench which
aros from that beach at lamu as we sat in the moonlit night
not under but on our friend the consul hospit roof
and snif it make the remembr of them veri poor and
faint no wonder peopl get fever at lamu and yet the place
wa not without a certain quaint and charm of it own though
possibl inde probabl it wa on which would quickli
pall
well where ar you gentlemen steer for ask our friend
the hospit consul as we smoke our pipe after dinner
we propos to go to mt kenia and then on to mt lekakisera
answer sir henri quatermain ha got hold of some yarn about
there be a white race up in the unknown territori beyond
the consul look interest and answer that he had heard
someth of that too
what have you heard i ask
oh not much all i know about it is that a year or so ago
i got a letter from mackenzi the scotch missionari whose station
the highland is place at the highest navig point of
the tana river in which he said someth about it
have you the letter i ask
no i destroi it but i rememb that he said that a man had
arriv at hi station who declar that two month journei
beyond mt lekakisera which no white man ha yet visit at
least so far as i know he found a lake call laga and that
then he went off to the northeast a month journei over desert
and thorn veldt and great mountain till he came to a countri
where the peopl ar white and live in stone hous here he
wa hospit entertain for a while till at last the priest
of the countri set it about that he wa a devil and the peopl
drove him awai and he journei for eight month and reach
mackenzi place as i heard dy that all i know and
if you ask me i believ that it is a lie but if you want to
find out more about it you had better go up the tana to mackenzi
place and ask him for inform
sir henri and i look at each other here wa someth tangibl
i think that we will go to mr mackenzi i said
well answer the consul that is your best wai but i warn
you that you ar like to have a rough journei for i hear that
the masai ar about and as you know thei ar not pleasant
custom your best plan will be to choos a few pick men
for person servant and hunter and to hire bearer from villag
to villag it will give you an infin of troubl but perhap
on the whole it will prove a cheaper and more advantag cours
than engag a caravan and you will be less liabl to desert
fortun there were at lamu at thi time a parti of wakwafi
askari soldier the wakwafi who ar a cross between the
masai and the wataveta ar a fine manli race possess mani
of the good qualiti of the zulu and a great capac for civil
thei ar also great hunter as it happen these particular
men had recent been on a long trip with an englishman name
jutson who had start from mombasa a port about 150 mile
below lamu and journei right round kilimanjaro on of the
highest known mountain in africa poor fellow he had di
of fever when on hi return journei and within a dai march
of mombasa it doe seem hard that he should have gone off thu
when within a few hour of safeti and after have surviv
so mani peril but so it wa hi hunter buri him and then
came on to lamu in a dhow our friend the consul suggest to
us that we had better try and hire these men and accordingli
on the follow morn we start to interview the parti
accompani by an interpret
in due cours we found them in a mud hut on the outskirt of
the town three of the men were sit outsid the hut and
fine franklook fellow thei were have a more or less civil
appear to them we cautious open the object of our visit
at first with veri scant success thei declar that thei could
not entertain ani such idea that thei were worn and weari with
long travel and that their heart were sore at the loss
of their master thei meant to go back to their home and rest
awhil thi did not sound veri promis so by wai of effect
a divers i ask where the remaind of them were i wa
told there were six and i saw but three on of the men said
thei slept in the hut and were yet rest after their labour
sleep weigh down their eyelid and sorrow made their heart
as lead it wa best to sleep for with sleep came forget
but the men should be awaken
present thei came out of the hut yawn the first two
men be evid of the same race and style as those alreadi
befor us but the appear of the third and last nearli made
me jump out of my skin he wa a veri tall broad man quit
six foot three i should sai but gaunt with lean wirylook
limb my first glanc at him told me that he wa no wakwafi
he wa a pure bred zulu he came out with hi thin aristocraticlook
hand place befor hi face to hide a yawn so i could onli see
that he wa a keshla or ring man endnot 1 and that he
had a great threecorn hole in hi forehead in anoth
second he remov hi hand reveal a powerfullook zulu
face with a humor mouth a short woolli beard ting with
grei and a pair of brown ey keen as a hawk i knew my man
at onc although i had not seen him for twelv year how

the woodpeck and also as the slaughter start and
almost let the longhandl battleax he held in hi hand fall
in hi astonish next second he had recogn me and wa
salut me in an outburst of sonor languag which made hi

chapter ii
the black hand
in due cours we left lamu and ten dai afterward we found
ourselv at a spot call charra on the tana river have
gone through mani adventur which need not be record here
amongst other thing we visit a ruin citi of which there
ar mani on thi coast and which must onc to judg from their
extent and the numer remain of mosqu and stone hous
have been veri popul place these ruin citi ar immeasur
ancient have i believ been place of wealth and import
as far back as the old testament time when thei were centr
of trade with india and elsewher but their glori ha depart
now the slave trade ha finish them and where wealthi
merchant from all part of the then civil world stood and
bargain in the crowd marketplac the lion hold hi court
at night and instead of the chatter of slave and the eager
voic of the bidder hi aw note goe echo down the ruin
corridor at thi particular place we discov on a mound
cover up with rank growth and rubbish two of the most beauti
stone doorwai that it is possibl to conceiv the carv
on them wa simpli exquisit and i onli regret that we had no
mean of get them awai no doubt thei had onc been the
entranc to a palac of which howev no trace were now
to be seen though probabl it ruin lai under the rise mound
gone quit gone the wai that everyth must go like the
nobl and the ladi who live within their gate these citi
have had their dai and now thei ar as babylon and nineveh
and as london and pari will on dai be noth mai endur
that is the inexor law men and women empir and citi
throne princip and power mountain river and unfathom
sea world space and univers all have their dai and
all must go in thi ruin and forgotten place the moralist
mai behold a symbol of the univers destini for thi system
of our allow no room for stand still noth can loiter
on the road and check the progress of thing upward toward
life or the rush of thing downward toward death the stern
policeman fate move us and them on on uphil and downhil
and across the level there is no restingplac for the weari
feet till at last the abyss swallow us and from the shore
of the transitori we ar hurl into the sea of the etern
at charra we had a violent quarrel with the headman of the bearer
we had hire to go as far as thi and who now wish to extort
larg extra payment from us in the result he threaten to
set the masai about whom more anon on to us that night
he with all our hire bearer ran awai steal most of the
good which had been entrust to them to carri luckili howev
thei had not happen to steal our rifl ammunit and person
effect not becaus of ani delicaci of feel on their part
but ow to the fact that thei chanc to be in the charg of
the five wakwafi after that it wa clear to us that we had
had enough of caravan and of bearer inde we had not much
left for a caravan to carri and yet how were we to get on
it wa good who solv the question here is water he said
point to the tana river and yesterdai i saw a parti of nativ
hunt hippopotami in cano i understand that mr mackenzi
mission station is on the tana river why not get into cano
and paddl up to it
thi brilliant suggest wa needless to sai receiv with
acclam and i instantli set to work to bui suitabl cano
from the surround nativ i succeed after a delai of three
dai in obtain two larg on each hollow out of a singl
log of some light wood and capabl of hold six peopl and
baggag for these two cano we had to pai nearli all our
remain cloth and also mani other articl
on the dai follow our purchas of the two cano we effect
a start in the first cano were good sir henri and three
of our wakwafi follow in the second myself umslopogaa
and the other two wakwafi as our cours lai upstream we had
to keep four paddl at work in each cano which meant that
the whole lot of us except good had to row awai like galleyslav
and veri exhaust work it wa i sai except good for of
cours the moment that good got into a boat hi foot wa on
hi nativ heath and he took command of the parti and certainli
he work us on shore good is a gentl mildmann man
and given to jocos but as we found to our cost good in
a boat wa a perfect demon to begin with he knew all about
it and we didnt on all nautic subject from the torpedo
fit of a manofwar down to the best wai of handl the
paddl of an african cano he wa a perfect mine of inform
which to sai the least of it we were not also hi idea of
disciplin were of the sternest and in short he came the royal
naval offic over us pretti consider and paid us out ampli
for all the chaff we were wont to treat him to on land but
on the other hand i am bound to sai that he manag the boat admir
after the first dai good succeed with the help of some cloth
and a coupl of pole in rig up a sail in each cano which
lighten our labour not a littl but the current ran veri
strong against us and at the best we were not abl to make more
than twenti mile a dai our plan wa to start at dawn and
paddl along till about halfpast ten by which time the sun
got too hot to allow of further exert then we moor our
cano to the bank and at our frugal meal after which we at
or otherwis amus ourselv till about three oclock when
we again start and row till within an hour of sundown when
we call a halt for the night on land in the even good
would at onc set to work with the help of the askari to build
a littl scherm or small enclosur fenc with thorn bush
and to light a fire i with sir henri and umslopogaa would
go out to shoot someth for the pot gener thi wa an
easi task for all sort of game abound on the bank of the
tana on night sir henri shot a young cowgiraff of which
the marrowbon were excel on anoth i got a coupl of
waterbuck right and left and onc to hi own intens satisfact
umslopogaa who like most zulu wa a vile shot with a rifl
manag to kill a fine fat eland with a martini i had lent him
sometim we vari our food by shoot some guineafowl or
bushbustard paau both of which were numer with a
shotgun or by catch a suppli of beauti yellow fish with
which the water of the tana swarm and which form i believ
on of the chief foodsuppli of the crocodil
three dai after our start an omin incid occur we
were just draw in to the bank to make our camp as usual for
the night when we caught sight of a figur stand on a littl
knoll not forti yard awai and intens watch our approach
on glanc wa suffici although i wa person unacquaint
with the tribe to tell me that he wa a masai elmoran or
young warrior inde had i had ani doubt thei would have
quickli been dispel by the terrifi ejacul of masai
that burst simultan from the lip of our wakwafi follow
who ar as i think i have said themselv bastard masai
and what a figur he present as he stood there in hi savag
wargear accustom as i have been to savag all my life
i do not think that i have ever befor seen anyth quit so
feroci or aweinspir to begin with the man wa enorm
tall quit as tall as umslopogaa i should sai and beautifulli
though somewhat slightli shape but with the face of a devil
in hi right hand he held a spear about five and a half feet
long the blade be two and a half feet in length by nearli
three inch in width and have an iron spike at the end of
the handl that measur more than a foot on hi left arm wa
a larg and wellmad ellipt shield of buffalo hide on which
were paint strang heraldiclook devic on hi shoulder
wa a huge cape of hawk feather and round hi neck wa a
naiber or strip of cotton about seventeen feet long by
on and a half broad with a stripe of colour run down the
middl of it the tan goatskin robe which form hi ordinari
attir in time of peac wa ti lightli round hi waist so
as to serv the purpos of a belt and through it were stuck
on the right and left side respect hi short pearshap
sime or sword which is made of a singl piec of steel and
carri in a wooden sheath and an enorm knobkerri but
perhap the most remark featur of hi attir consist of
a headdress of ostrichfeath which wa fix on the chin
and pass in front of the ear to the forehead and be shape
like an ellips complet frame the face so that the diabol
counten appear to project from a sort of feather firescreen
round the ankl he wore black fring of hair and project
from the upper portion of the calv to which thei were attach
were long spur like spike from which flow down tuft of
the beauti black and wave hair of the colobu monkei such
wa the elabor arrai of the masai elmoran who stood watch
the approach of our two cano but it is on which to be appreci
must be seen onli those who see it do not often live to describ
it of cours i could not make out all these detail of hi
full dress on the occas of thi my first introduct be
inde ampli taken up with the consider of the gener
effect but i had plenti of subsequ opportun of becom
acquaint with the item that went to make it up
whilst we were hesit what to do the masai warrior drew
himself up in a dignifi fashion shook hi huge spear at us
and turn vanish on the further side of the slope
hulloa holloa sir henri from the other boat our friend
the caravan leader ha been as good as hi word and set the
masai after us do you think it will be safe to go ashor
i did not think it would be at all safe but on the other hand
we had no mean of cook in the cano and noth that we
could eat raw so it wa difficult to know what to do at last
umslopogaa simplifi matter by volunt to go and reconnoitr
which he did creep off into the bush like a snake while
we hung off in the stream wait for him in half an hour he
return and told us that there wa not a masai to be seen anywher
about but that he had discov a spot where thei had recent
been encamp and that from variou indic he judg that
thei must have move on an hour or so befor the man we saw
have no doubt been left to report upon our movement
thereupon we land and have post a sentri proceed to
cook and eat our even meal thi done we took the situat
into our seriou consider of cours it wa possibl that
the apparit of the masai warrior had noth to do with us
that he wa mere on of a band bent upon some maraud and
murder expedit against anoth tribe but when we recal
the threat of the caravan leader and reflect on the omin
wai in which the warrior had shaken hi spear at us thi did
not appear veri probabl on the contrari what did seem probabl
wa that the parti wa after us and await a favour opportun
to attack us thi be so there were two thing that we could
do on of which wa to go on and the other to go back the
latter idea wa howev reject at onc it be obviou
that we should encount as mani danger in retreat as in advanc
and besid we had made up our mind to journei onward at
ani price under these circumst howev we did not consid
it safe to sleep ashor so we got into our cano and paddl
out into the middl of the stream which wa not veri wide here
manag to anchor them by mean of big stone fasten to rope
made of coconutfibr of which there were sever fathom in
each cano
here the mosquito nearli at us up aliv and thi combin
with anxieti as to our posit effectu prevent me from
sleep as the other were do notwithstand the attack
of the aforesaid tana mosquito and so i lai awak smoke
and reflect on mani thing but be of a practic turn
of mind chiefli on how we were to give those masai villain
the slip it wa a beauti moonlight night and notwithstand
the mosquito and the great risk we were run from fever
from sleep in such a spot and forget that i had the cramp
veri badli in my right leg from squat in a constrain posit
in the cano and that the wakwafi who wa sleep besid me
smelt horribl i realli began to enjoi myself the moonbeam
plai upon the surfac of the run water that speed unceasingli
past us toward the sea like men live toward the grave
till it glitter like a wide sheet of silver that is in the
open where the tree threw no shadow near the bank howev
it wa veri dark and the night wind sigh sadli in the reed
to our left on the further side of the river wa a littl
sandi bai which wa clear of tree and here i could make out
the form of numer antelop advanc to the water till
suddenli there came an omin roar whereupon thei all made
off hurriedli then after a paus i caught sight of the massiv
form of hi majesti the lion come down to drink hi fill after
meat present he move on then came a crash of the reed
about fifti yard abov us and a few minut later a huge black
mass rose out of the water about twenti yard from me and snort
it wa the head of a hippopotamu down it went without a sound
onli to rise again within five yard of where i sat thi wa
decidedli too near to be comfort more especi as the
hippopotamu wa evid anim by intens curios to know
what on earth our cano were he open hi great mouth to
yawn i suppos and gave me an excel view of hi ivori
and i could not help reflect how easili he could crunch up
our frail cano with a singl bite inde i had half a mind
to give him a ball from my eightbor but on reflect determin
to let him alon unless he actual charg the boat present
he sank again as noiselessli as befor and i saw no more of
him just then on look toward the bank on our right i
fanci that i caught sight of a dark figur flit between
the tree trunk i have veri keen sight and i wa almost sure
that i saw someth but whether it wa bird beast or man
i could not sai at the moment howev a dark cloud pass
over the moon and i saw no more of it just then too although
all the other sound of the forest had ceas a speci of horn
owl with which i wa well acquaint began to hoot with great
persist after that save for the rustl of tree and
reed when the wind caught them there wa complet silenc
but somehow in the most unaccount wai i had suddenli becom
nervou there wa no particular reason why i should be beyond
the ordinari reason which surround the central african travel
and yet i undoubtedli wa if there is on thing more than anoth
of which i have the most complet and entir scorn and disbelief
it is of presenti and yet here i wa all of a sudden fill
with and possess by a most undoubt presenti of approach
evil i would not give wai to it howev although i felt the
cold perspir stand out upon my forehead i would not arous
the other wors and wors i grew my puls flutter like
a dy man my nerv thrill with the horribl sens of
impot terror which anybodi who is subject to nightmar will
be familiar with but still my will triumph over my fear
and i lai quiet for i wa half sit half ly in the bow
of the cano onli turn my face so as to command a view of
umslopogaa and the two wakwafi who were sleep alongsid of
and beyond me
in the distanc i heard a hippopotamu splash faintli then the
owl hoot again in a kind of unnatur scream note endnot 4
and the wind began to moan plaintiv through the tree
make a heartchil music abov wa the black bosom of
the cloud and beneath me swept the black flood of the water
and i felt as though i and death were utterli alon between them
it wa veri desol
suddenli my blood seem to freez in my vein and my heart
to stand still wa it fanci or were we move i turn my
ey to look for the other cano which should be alongsid of
us i could not see it but instead i saw a lean and clutch
black hand lift itself abov the gunwal of the littl boat
sure it wa a nightmar at the same instant a dim but
devilishlook face appear to rise out of the water and
then came a lurch of the cano the quick flash of a knife and
an aw yell from the wakwafi who wa sleep by my side the
same poor fellow whose odour had been annoi me and someth
warm spurt into my face in an instant the spell wa broken
i knew that it wa no nightmar but that we were attack by
swim masai snatch at the first weapon that came to hand
which happen to be umslopogaa battleax i struck with all
my forc in the direct in which i had seen the flash of the
knife the blow fell upon a man arm and catch it against
the thick wooden gunwal of the cano complet sever it
from the bodi just abov the wrist as for it owner he utter
no sound or cry like a ghost he came and like a ghost he went
leav behind him a bloodi hand still grip a great knife
or rather a short sword that wa buri in the heart of our
poor servant
instantli there aros a hubbub and confus and i fanci
rightli or wrongli that i made out sever dark head glide
awai toward the righthand bank whither we were rapidli drift
for the rope by which we were moor had been sever with a
knife as soon as i had realiz thi fact i also realiz
that the scheme had been to cut the boat loos so that it should
drift on to the right bank as it would have done with the natur
swing of the current where no doubt a parti of masai were wait
to dig their shovelhead spear into us seiz on paddl
myself i told umslopogaa to take anoth for the remain
askari wa too frighten and bewild to be of ani us and
togeth we row vigor out toward the middl of the stream
and not an instant too soon for in anoth minut we should
have been aground and then there would have been an end of us
as soon as we were well out we set to work to paddl the cano
upstream again to where the other wa moor and veri hard and
danger work it wa in the dark and with noth but the note
of good stentorian shout which he kept fire off at interv
like a foghorn to guid us but at last we fetch up and
were thank to find that thei had not been molest at all
no doubt the owner of the same hand that sever our rope should
have sever their also but wa led awai from hi purpos by
an irresist inclin to murder when he got the chanc
which while it cost us a man and him hi hand undoubtedli save
all the rest of us from massacr had it not been for that ghastli
apparit over the side of the boat an apparit that i
shall never forget till my dy hour the cano would undoubtedli
have drift ashor befor i realiz what had happen and
thi histori would never have been written by me
chapter iii
the mission station
we made the remain of our rope fast to the other cano and
sat wait for the dawn and congratul ourselv upon our
merci escap which realli seem to result more from the
special favour of provid than from our own care or prowess
at last it came and i have not often been more grate to
see the light though so far as my cano wa concern it reveal
a ghastli sight there in the bottom of the littl boat lai
the unfortun askari the sime or sword in hi bosom and
the sever hand grip the handl i could not bear the sight
so haul up the stone which had serv as an anchor to the
other cano we made it fast to the murder man and drop
him overboard and down he went to the bottom leav noth
but a train of bubbl behind him ala when our time come
most of us like him leav noth but bubbl behind to show
that we have been and the bubbl soon burst the hand of hi
murder we threw into the stream where it slowli sank the
sword of which the handl wa ivori inlaid with gold evid
arab work i kept and us as a huntingknif and veri us
it prove
then a man have been transfer to my cano we onc more
start on in veri low spirit and not feel at all comfort
as to the futur but fondli hope to arriv at the highland
station by night to make matter wors within an hour of sunris
it came on to rain in torrent wet us to the skin and even
necessit the occasion bale of the cano and as the
rain beat down the wind we could not us the sail and had to
get along as best as we could with our paddl
at eleven oclock we halt on an open piec of ground on the
left bank of the river and the rain abat a littl manag
to make a fire and catch and broil some fish we did not dare
to wander about to search for game at two oclock we got off
again take a suppli of broil fish with us and shortli afterward
the rain came on harder than ever also the river began to get
exceedingli difficult to navig on account of the numer
rock reach of shallow water and the increas forc of the
current so that it soon becam clear to us that we should not
reach the rev mackenzi hospit roof that night a prospect
that did not tend to enliven us toil as we would we could
not make more than an averag of a mile an hour and at five
oclock in the afternoon by which time we were all utterli worn
out we reckon that we were still quit ten mile below the
station thi be so we set to work to make the best arrang
we could for the night after our recent experi we simpli
did not dare to land more especi as the bank of the tana
were cloth with dens bush that would have given cover to five
thousand masai and at first i thought that we were go to
have anoth night of it in the cano fortun howev
we espi a littl rocki islet not more than fifteen mile or
so squar situat nearli in the middl of the river for thi
we paddl and make fast the cano land and made ourselv
as comfort as circumst would permit which wa veri
uncomfort inde as for the weather it continu to be
simpli vile the rain come down in sheet till we were chill
to the marrow and utterli prevent us from light a fire
there wa howev on consol circumst about thi rain
our askari declar that noth would induc the masai to make
an attack in it as thei intens dislik move about in the
wet perhap as good suggest becaus thei hate the idea of
wash we at some insipid and sodden cold fish that is
with the except of umslopogaa who like most zulu cannot
bear fish and took a pull of brandi of which we fortun
had a few bottl left and then began what with on except
when we same three white men nearli perish of cold on the
snow of sheba breast in the cours of our journei to kukuanaland
wa i think the most try night i ever experienc it
seem absolut endless and onc or twice i fear that two
of the askari would have di of the wet cold and exposur
inde had it not been for time dose of brandi i am sure
that thei would have di for no african peopl can stand much
exposur which first paralys and then kill them i could
see that even that iron old warrior umslopogaa felt it keenli
though in strang contrast to the wakwafi who groan and
bemoan their fate unceasingli he never utter a singl complaint
to make matter wors about on in the morn we again heard
the owl omin hoot and had at onc to prepar ourselv
for anoth attack though if it had been attempt i do not
think that we could have offer a veri effect resist
but either the owl wa a real on thi time or els the masai
were themselv too miser to think of offens oper
which inde thei rare if ever undertak in bush veldt
at ani rate we saw noth of them
at last the dawn came glide across the water wrap in wreath
of ghostli mist and with the daylight the rain ceas and
then out came the gloriou sun suck up the mist and warm
the chill air benumb and utterli exhaust we drag ourselv
to our feet and went and stood in the bright rai and were
thank for them i can quit understand how it is that primit
peopl becom sun worshipp especi if their condit
of life render them liabl to exposur
in half an hour more we were onc again make fair progress
with the help of a good wind our spirit had return with
the sunshin and we were readi to laugh at difficulti and
danger that had been almost crush on the previou dai
and so we went on cheerili till about eleven oclock just as
we were think of halt as usual to rest and try to shoot
someth to eat a sudden bend in the river brought us in sight
of a substantiallook european hous with a veranda round
it splendidli situat upon a hill and surround by a high
stone wall with a ditch on the outer side right against and
overshadow the hous wa an enorm pine the tope of which
we had seen through a glass for the last two dai but of cours
without know that it mark the site of the mission station
i wa the first to see the hous and could not restrain myself
from give a hearti cheer in which the other includ the
nativ join lustili there wa no thought of halt now
on we labour for unfortun though the hous seem
quit near it wa still a long wai off by river until at last
by on oclock we found ourselv at the bottom of the slope
on which the build stood run the cano to the bank
we disembark and were just haul them up on to the shore
when we perceiv three figur dress in ordinari englishlook
cloth hurri down through a grove of tree to meet us
a gentleman a ladi and a littl girl ejacul good after
survei the trio through hi eyeglass walk in a civil
fashion through a civil garden to meet us in thi place
hang me if thi isnt the most curiou thing we have seen yet
good wa right it certainli did seem odd and out of place
more like a scene out of a dream or an italian opera than a real
tangibl fact and the sens of unreal wa not lessen when
we heard ourselv address in good broad scotch which howev
i cannot reproduc
how do you do sir said mr mackenzi a greyhair angular
man with a kindli face and red cheek i hope i see you veri
well my nativ told me an hour ago thei spi two cano with
white men in them come up the river so we have just come down
to meet you
and it is veri glad that we ar to see a white face again let
me tell you put in the ladi a charm and refinedlook
person
we took off our hat in acknowledg and proceed to introduc
ourselv
and now said mr mackenzi you must all be hungri and weari
so come on gentlemen come on and right glad we ar to see
you the last white who visit us wa alphons you will
see alphons present and that wa a year ago
meanwhil we had been walk up the slope of the hill the lower
portion of which wa fenc off sometim with quinc fenc
and sometim with rough stone wall into kaffir garden just
now full of crop of meali pumpkin potato etc in the
corner of these garden were group of neat mushroomshap
hut occupi by mr mackenzi mission nativ whose women
and children came pour out to meet us as we walk through
the centr of the garden ran the roadwai up which we were walk
it wa border on each side by a line of orang tree which
although thei had onli been plant ten year had in the love
climat of the upland below mt kenia the base of which is about
5000 feet abov the coastlin level alreadi grown to impos
proport and were posit laden with golden fruit after
a stiffish climb of a quarter of a mile or so for the hillsid
wa steep we came to a splendid quinc fenc also cover
with fruit which enclos mr mackenzi told us a space of
about four acr of ground that contain hi privat garden
hous church and outbuild and inde the whole hilltop
and what a garden it wa i have alwai love a good garden
and i could have thrown up my hand for joi when i saw mr mackenzi
first there were row upon row of standard european fruittre
all graft for on top of thi hill the climat wa so temper
that nearli all the english veget tree and flower flourish
luxuriantli even includ sever varieti of the appl which
gener run to wood in a warm climat and obstin refus
to fruit then there were strawberri and tomato such tomato
and melon and cucumb and inde everi sort of veget
and fruit
well you have someth like a garden i said overpow
with admir not untouch by envi
ye answer the missionari it is a veri good garden and
ha well repaid my labour but it is the climat that i have
to thank if you stick a peachston into the ground it will
bear fruit the fourth year and a rosecut will bloom in
a year it is a love clime
just then we came to a ditch about ten feet wide and full of
water on the other side of which wa a loophol stone wall
eight feet high and with sharp flint plentifulli set in mortar
on the cope
there said mr mackenzi point to the ditch and wall thi
is my magnum opu at least thi and the church which is the
other side of the hous it took me and twenti nativ two year
to dig the ditch and build the wall but i never felt safe till
it wa done and now i can defi all the savag in africa for
the spring that fill the ditch is insid the wall and bubbl
out at the top of the hill winter and summer alik and i alwai
keep a store of four month provis in the hous
cross over a plank and through a veri narrow open in the
wall we enter into what mr mackenzi call her domain
name the flower garden the beauti of which is realli beyond
my power to describ i do not think i ever saw such rose
gardenia or camellia all rear from seed or cut sent
from england and there wa also a patch given up to a collect
of bulbou root mostli collect by miss flossi mr mackenzi
littl daughter from the surround countri some of which
were surpassingli beauti in the middl of thi garden and
exactli opposit the veranda a beauti fountain of clear water
bubbl up from the ground and fell into a stonework basin
which had been carefulli built to receiv it whenc the overflow
found it wai by mean of a drain to the moat round the outer
wall thi moat in it turn serv as a reservoir whenc an
unfail suppli of water wa avail to irrig all the garden
below the hous itself a massiv built singlestori build
wa roof with slab of stone and had a handsom veranda in
front it wa built on three side of a squar the fourth side
be taken up by the kitchen which stood separ from the
hous a veri good plan in a hot countri in the centr of
thi squar thu form wa perhap the most remark object
that we had yet seen in thi charm place and that wa a singl
tree of the conif tribe varieti of which grow freeli on
the highland of thi part of africa thi splendid tree which
mr mackenzi inform us wa a landmark for fifti mile round
and which we had ourselv seen for the last forti mile of our
journei must have been nearli three hundr feet in height
the trunk measur about sixteen feet in diamet at a yard
from the ground for some seventi feet it rose a beauti taper
brown pillar without a singl branch but at that height splendid
dark green bough which look at from below had the appear
of gigant fernleav sprang out horizont from the trunk
project right over the hous and flowergarden to both of
which thei furnish a grate proport of shade without
be so high up offer ani impedi to the passag
of light and air
what a beauti tree exclaim sir henri
ye you ar right it is a beauti tree there is not anoth
like it in all the countri round that i know of answer mr
mackenzi i call it my watch tower as you see i have a
rope ladder fix to the lowest bough and if i want to see anyth
that is go on within fifteen mile or so all i have to do
is to run up it with a spyglass but you must be hungri and
i am sure the dinner is cook come in my friend it is but
a rough place but well enough for these savag part and i
can tell you what we have got a french cook and he led
the wai on to the veranda
as i wa follow him and wonder what on earth he could
mean by thi there suddenli appear through the door that
open on to the veranda from the hous a dapper littl man
dress in a neat blue cotton suit with shoe made of tan
hide and remark for a bustl air and most enorm black
mustachio shape into an upward curv and come to a point
for all the world like a pair of buffalohorn
madam bid me for to sai that dinnar is sarv messieur
my compliment then suddenli perceiv umslopogaa who wa
loiter along after us and plai with hi battleax he threw
up hi hand in astonish ah mai quel homm he ejacul
in french quel sauvag affreux take but note of hi huge
choppar and the great pit in hi head
ay said mr mackenzi what ar you talk about alphons
talk about repli the littl frenchman hi ey still
fix upon umslopogaa whose gener appear seem to fascin
him why i talk of him and he rude point of ce monsieur noir
at thi everybodi began to laugh and umslopogaa perceiv
that he wa the object of remark frown feroci for he
had a most lordli dislik of anyth like a person liberti
parbleu said alphons he is anger he make the grimac
i like not hi air i vanish and he did with consider rapid
mr mackenzi join heartili in the shout of laughter which we
indulg in he is a queer charact alphons he said
by and by i will tell you hi histori in the meanwhil let
us try hi cook
might i ask said sir henri after we had eaten a most excel
dinner how you came to have a french cook in these wild
oh answer mr mackenzi he arriv here of hi own accord
about a year ago and ask to be taken into our servic
he had got into some troubl in franc and fled to zanzibar
where he found an applic had been made by the french govern
for hi extradit whereupon he rush off upcountri and
fell in when nearli starv with our caravan of men who were
bring us our annual suppli of good and wa brought on here
you should get him to tell you the stori
when dinner wa over we lit our pipe and sir henri proceed
to give our host a descript of our journei up here over which
he look veri grave
it is evid to me he said that those rascal masai ar
follow you and i am veri thank that you have reach thi
hous in safeti i do not think that thei will dare to attack
you here it is unfortun though that nearli all my men
have gone down to the coast with ivori and good there ar
two hundr of them in the caravan and the consequ is that
i have not more than twenti men avail for defens purpos
in case thei should attack us but still i will just give
a few order and call a black man who wa loiter about
outsid in the garden he went to the window and address him
in a swahili dialect the man listen and then salut and
depart
i am sure i devoutli hope that we shall bring no such calam
upon you said i anxious when he had taken hi seat again
rather than bring those bloodthirsti villain about your ear
we will move on and take our chanc
you will do noth of the sort if the masai come thei come
and there is an end on it and i think we can give them a pretti
warm greet i would not show ani man the door for all the
masai in the world
that remind me i said the consul at lamu told me that he
had had a letter from you in which you said that a man had arriv
here who report that he had come across a white peopl in the
interior do you think that there wa ani truth in hi stori
i ask becaus i have onc or twice in my life heard rumour
from nativ who have come down from the far north of the exist
of such a race
mr mackenzi by wai of answer went out of the room and return
bring with him a most curiou sword it wa long and all
the blade which wa veri thick and heavi wa to within a quarter
of an inch of the cut edg work into an ornament pattern
exactli as we work soft wood with a fretsaw the steel howev
be invari pierc in such a wai as not to interfer with
the strength of the sword thi in itself wa suffici curiou
but what wa still more so wa that all the edg of the hollow
space cut through the substanc of the blade were most beautifulli
inlaid with gold which wa in some wai that i cannot understand
weld on to the steel endnot 5
there said mr mackenzi did you ever see a sword like that
we all examin it and shook our head
well i have got it to show you becaus thi is what the man
who said he had seen the white peopl brought with him and becaus
it doe more or less give an air of truth to what i should otherwis
have set down as a lie look here i will tell you all that
i know about the matter which is not much on afternoon just
befor sunset i wa sit on the veranda when a poor miser
starvedlook man came limp up and squat down befor
me i ask him where he came from and what he want and thereon
he plung into a long rambl narr about how he belong
to a tribe far in the north and how hi tribe wa destroi
by anoth tribe and he with a few other survivor driven still
further north past a lake name laga thenc it appear he
made hi wai to anoth lake that lai up in the mountain a
lake without a bottom he call it and here hi wife and brother
di of an infecti sick probabl smallpox whereon
the peopl drove him out of their villag into the wilder
where he wander miser over mountain for ten dai after
which he got into dens thorn forest and wa on dai found there
by some white men who were hunt and who took him to a place
where all the peopl were white and live in stone hous here
he remain a week shut up in a hous till on night a man with
a white beard whom he understood to be a medicineman came
and inspect him after which he wa led off and taken through
the thorn forest to the confin of the wilder and given
food and thi sword at least so he said and turn loos
well said sir henri who had been listen with breathless
interest and what did he do then
oh he seem accord to hi account to have gone through
suffer and hardship innumer and to have live for week
on root and berri and such thing as he could catch and kill
but somehow he did live and at last by slow degre made hi
wai south and reach thi place what the detail of hi journei
were i never learnt for i told him to return on the morrow
bid on of my headmen look after him for the night the
headman took him awai but the poor man had the itch so badli
that the headman wife would not have him in the hut for fear
of catch it so he wa given a blanket and told to sleep outsid
as it happen we had a lion hang about here just then
and most unhappili he wind thi unfortun wander and
spring on him bit hi head almost off without the peopl
in the hut know anyth about it and there wa an end of
him and hi stori about the white peopl and whether or no there
is ani truth in it is more than i can tell you what do you
think mr quatermain
i shook my head and answer i dont know there ar so mani
queer thing hidden awai in the heart of thi great contin
that i should be sorri to assert that there wa no truth in it
anyhow we mean to try and find out we intend to journei to
lekakisera and thenc if we live to get so far to thi lake
laga and if there ar ani white peopl beyond we will do our
best to find them
you ar veri venturesom peopl said mr mackenzi
with a smile and the subject drop
chapter iv
alphons and hi annett
after dinner we thoroughli inspect all the outbuild and
ground of the station which i consid the most success
as well as the most beauti place of the sort that i have seen
in africa we then return to the veranda where we found umslopogaa
take advantag of thi favour opportun to clean all
the rifl thoroughli thi wa the onli work that he ever did
or wa ask to do for as a zulu chief it wa beneath hi digniti
to work with hi hand but such as it wa he did it veri well
it wa a curiou sight to see the great zulu sit there upon
the floor hi battleax rest against the wall behind him
whilst hi long aristocraticlook hand were busili emploi
delic and with the utmost care clean the mechan of
the breechload he had a name for each gun on a doubl
fourbor belong to sir henri wa the thunder anoth
my 500 express which had a peculiarli sharp report wa the
littl on who spoke like a whip the winchest repeat were
the women who talk so fast that you could not tell on word
from anoth the six martini were the common peopl and
so on with them all it wa veri curiou to hear him address
each gun as he clean it as though it were an individu and
in a vein of the quaintest humour he did the same with hi
battleax which he seem to look upon as an intim friend
and to which he would at time talk by the hour go over all
hi old adventur with it and dread enough some of them
were by a piec of grim humour he had name thi ax inkosikaa
which is the zulu word for chieftai for a long while i
could not make out why he gave it such a name and at last i
ask him when he inform me that the ax wa veri evid
feminin becaus of her womanli habit of pry veri deep into
thing and that she wa clearli a chieftai becaus all men
fell down befor her struck dumb at the sight of her beauti
and power in the same wai he would consult inkosikaa if
in ani dilemma and when i ask him why he did so he inform
me it wa becaus she must need be wise have look into
so mani peopl brain
i took up the ax and close examin thi formid weapon
it wa as i have said of the natur of a poleax the haft
made out of an enorm rhinocero horn wa three feet three
inch long about an inch and a quarter thick and with a knob
at the end as larg as a maltes orang left there to prevent
the hand from slip thi horn haft though so massiv wa
as flexibl as cane and practic unbreak but to make
assur doubli sure it wa whip round at interv of a
few inch with copper wire all the part where the hand
grip be thu treat just abov where the haft enter the
head were score a number of littl nick each nick repres
a man kill in battl with the weapon the ax itself wa made
of the most beauti steel and appar of european manufactur
though umslopogaa did not know where it came from have taken
it from the hand of a chief he had kill in battl mani year
befor it wa not veri heavi the head weigh two and a half
pound as nearli as i could judg the cut part wa slightli
concav in shape not convex as it gener the case with
savag battleax and sharp as a razor measur five and
threequart inch across the widest part from the back of
the ax sprang a stout spike four inch long for the last two
of which it wa hollow and shape like a leather punch with
an open for anyth forc into the hollow at the punch end
to be push out abov in fact in thi respect it exactli
resembl a butcher poleax it wa with thi punch end
as we afterward discov that umslopogaa usual struck
when fight drive a neat round hole in hi adversari skull
and onli us the broad cut edg for a circular sweep or
sometim in a mele i think he consid the punch a neater
and more sportsmanlik tool and it wa from hi habit of peck
at hi enemi with it that he got hi name of woodpeck certainli
in hi hand it wa a terribl effici on
such wa umslopogaa ax inkosikaa the most remark and
fatal handtohand weapon that i ever saw and on which he cherish
as much as hi own life it scarc ever left hi hand except
when he wa eat and then he alwai sat with it under hi
leg
just as i return hi ax to umslopogaa miss flossi came
up and took me off to see her collect of flower african
lilium and bloom shrub some of which ar veri beauti
mani of the varieti be quit unknown to me and also i believ
to botan scienc i ask her if she had ever seen or heard
of the goya lili which central african explor have told
me thei have occasion met with and whose wonder loveli
ha fill them with astonish thi lili which the nativ
sai bloom onli onc in ten year flourish in the most arid
soil compar to the size of the bloom the bulb is small
gener weigh about four pound as for the flower itself
which i afterward saw under circumst like to impress
it appear fixedli in my mind i know not how to describ
it beauti and splendour or the indescrib sweet of it
perfum the flower for it ha onli on bloom rise from
the crown of the bulb on a thick fleshi and flatsid stem
the specimen that i saw measur fourteen inch in diamet
and is somewhat trumpetshap like the bloom of an ordinari
longiflorum set vertic first there is the green sheath
which in it earli stage is not unlik that of a waterlili
but which as the bloom open split into four portion and curl
back gracefulli toward the stem then come the bloom itself
a singl dazzl arch of white enclos anoth cup of richest
velveti crimson from the heart of which rise a goldencolour
pistil i have never seen anyth to equal thi bloom in beauti
or fragranc and as i believ it is but littl known i take
the liberti to describ it at length look at it for the
first time i well rememb that i realiz how even in a flower
there dwell someth of the majesti of it maker to my great
delight miss flossi told me that she knew the flower well and
had tri to grow it in her garden but without success ad
howev that as it should be in bloom at thi time of the year
she thought that she could procur me a specimen
after that i fell to ask her if she wa not lone up here
among all these savag peopl and without ani companion of her
own ag
lone she said oh inde no i am as happi as the dai
is long and besid i have my own companion why i should
hate to be buri in a crowd of white girl all just like myself
so that nobodi could tell the differ here she said give
her head a littl toss i am i and everi nativ for mile around
know the waterlili for that is what thei call me and
is readi to do what i want but in the book that i have read
about littl girl in england it is not like that everybodi
think them a troubl and thei have to do what their schoolmistress
like oh it would break my heart to be put in a cage like
that and not to be free free as the air
would you not like to learn i ask
so i do learn father teach me latin and french and arithmet
and ar you never afraid among all these wild men
afraid oh no thei never interfer with me i think thei
believ that i am ngai of the divin becaus i am so white
and have fair hair and look here and dive her littl hand
into the bodic of her dress she produc a doublebarrel
nickelpl derring i alwai carri that load and if
anybodi tri to touch me i should shoot him onc i shot a
leopard that jump upon my donkei as i wa ride along it
frighten me veri much but i shot it in the ear and it fell
dead and i have it skin upon my bed look there she went
on in an alter voic touch me on the arm and point to
some farawai object i said just now that i had companion
there is on of them
i look and for the first time there burst upon my sight the
glori of mount kenia hitherto the mountain had alwai been
hidden in mist but now it radiant beauti wa unveil for mani
thousand feet although the base wa still wrap in vapour
so that the lofti peak or pillar tower nearli twenti thousand
feet into the sky appear to be a fairi vision hang between
earth and heaven and base upon the cloud the solemn majesti
and beauti of thi white peak ar togeth beyond the power of
my poor pen to describ there it rose straight and sheer
a glitter white glori it crest pierc the veri blue of
heaven as i gaze at it with that littl girl i felt my whole
heart lift up with an indescrib emot and for a moment
great and wonder thought seem to break upon my mind even
as the arrow of the set sun were break upon kenia snow
mr mackenzi nativ call the mountain the finger of god
and to me it did seem eloqu of immort peac and of the pure
high calm that sure li abov thi fever world somewher
i had heard a line of poetri
a thing of beauti is a joi for ever
and now it came into my mind and for the first time i thoroughli
understood what it meant base inde would be the man who
could look upon that mighti snowwreath pile that white
old tombston of the year and not feel hi own utter insignific
and by whatev name he call him worship god in hi heart
such sight ar like vision of the spirit thei throw wide
the window of the chamber of our small selfish and let in
a breath of that air that rush round the roll sphere and
for a while illumin our dark with a faroff gleam of the
white light which beat upon the throne
ye such thing of beauti ar inde a joi for ever and i can
well understand what littl flossi meant when she talk of
kenia as her companion as umslopogaa savag old zulu that
he wa said when i point out to him the peak hang in the
glitter air a man might look thereon for a thousand year
and yet be hungri to see but he gave rather anoth colour
to hi poetic idea when he ad in a sort of chant and with
a touch of that weird imagin for which the man wa remark
that when he wa dead he should like hi spirit to sit upon that
snowclad peak for ever and to rush down the steep white side
in the breath of the whirlwind or on the flash of the lightn
and slai and slai and slai
slai what you old bloodhound i ask
thi rather puzzl him but at length he answer
the other shadow
so thou wouldst continu thy murder even after death i said
i murder not he answer hotli i kill in fair fight man
is born to kill he who kill not when hi blood is hot is a
woman and no man the peopl who kill not ar slave i sai
i kill in fair fight and when i am in the shadow as you white
men sai i hope to go on kill in fair fight mai my shadow
be accurs and chill to the bone for ever if it should fall
to murder like a bushman with hi poison arrow and he
stalk awai with much digniti and left me laugh
just then the spi whom our host had sent out in the morn
to find out if there were ani trace of our masai friend about
return and report that the countri had been scour for
fifteen mile round without a singl elmoran be seen and
that thei believ that those gentri had given up the pursuit
and return whenc thei came mr mackenzi gave a sigh of relief
when he heard thi and so inde did we for we had had quit
enough of the masai to last us for some time inde the gener
opinion wa that find we had reach the mission station
in safeti thei had know it strength given up the pursuit
of us as a bad job how illjudg that view wa the sequel
will show
after the spi had gone and mr mackenzi and flossi had retir
for the night alphons the littl frenchman came out and
sir henri who is a veri good french scholar got him to tell
us how he came to visit central africa which he did in a most
extraordinari lingo that for the most part i shall not attempt

chapter v
umslopogaa make a promis
next morn at breakfast i miss flossi and ask where she wa
well said her mother when i got up thi morn i found
a note put outsid my door in which but here it is you can
read it for yourself and she gave me the slip of paper on which
the follow wa written
dearest m it is just dawn and i am off to the hill to
get mr q a bloom of the lili he want so dont expect me till
you see me i have taken the white donkei and nurs and a coupl
of boi ar come with me also someth to eat as i mai
be awai all dai for i am determin to get the lili if i have
to go twenti mile for it flossi
i hope she will be all right i said a littl anxious
i never meant her to troubl after the flower
ah flossi can look after herself said her mother she often
goe off in thi wai like a true child of the wilder but
mr mackenzi who came in just then and saw the note for the
first time look rather grave though he said noth
after breakfast wa over i took him asid and ask him whether
it would not be possibl to send after the girl and get her back
have in view the possibl of there still be some masai
hang about at whose hand she might come to harm
i fear it would be of no us he answer she mai be fifteen
mile off by now and it is imposs to sai what path she ha
taken there ar the hill and he point to a long rang
of rise ground stretch almost parallel with the cours follow
by the river tana but gradual slope down to a dens bushclad
plain about five mile short of the hous
here i suggest that we might get up the great tree over the
hous and search the countri round with a spyglass and thi
after mr mackenzi had given some order to hi peopl to try
and follow flossi spoor we did
the ascent of the mighti tree wa rather an alarm perform
even with a sound ropeladd fix at both end to climb up
at least to a landsman but good came up like a lamplight
on reach the height at which the first fernshap bough
sprang from the bole we step without ani difficulti upon
a platform made of board nail from on bough to anoth
and larg enough to accommod a dozen peopl as for the view
it wa simpli gloriou in everi direct the bush roll awai
in great billow for mile and mile as far as the glass would
show onli here and there broken by the brighter green of patch
of cultiv or by the glitter surfac of lake to the
northwest kenia rear hi mighti head and we could trace the
tana river curl like a silver snake almost from hi feet
and far awai beyond us toward the ocean it is a gloriou countri
and onli want the hand of civil man to make it a most product
on
but look as we would we could see no sign of flossi and her
donkei so at last we had to come down disappoint on reach
the veranda i found umslopogaa sit there slowli and lightli
sharpen hi ax with a small whetston he alwai carri with
him
what doest thou umslopogaa i ask
i smell blood wa the answer and i could get no more out
of him
after dinner we again went up the tree and search the surround
countri with a spyglass but without result when we came down
umslopogaa wa still sharpen inkosikaa although she alreadi
had an edg like a razor stand in front of him and regard
him with a mixtur of fear and fascin wa alphons and
certainli he did seem an alarm object sit there zulu
fashion on hi haunch a wild look upon hi intens savag
and yet intellectu face sharpen sharpen sharpen
at the murderouslook ax
oh the monster the horribl man said the littl french cook
lift hi hand in amaz see but the hole in hi head
the skin beat on it up and down like a babi who would nurs
such a babi and he burst out laugh at the idea
for a moment umslopogaa look up from hi sharpen and a
sort of evil light plai in hi dark ey
what doe the littl buffaloheif so name by umslopogaa
on account of hi mustachio and feminin characterist sai
let him be care or i will cut hi horn bewar littl
man monkei bewar
unfortun alphons who wa get over hi fear of him
went on laugh at ce drole dun monsieur noir i wa about
to warn him to desist when suddenli the huge zulu bound off
the veranda on to the open space where alphons wa stand
hi featur aliv with a sort of malici enthusiasm and began
swing the ax round and round over the frenchman head
stand still i shout do not move as you valu your life
he will not hurt you but i doubt if alphons heard me be
fortun for himself almost petrifi with horror
then follow the most extraordinari displai of sword or rather
of axemanship that i ever saw first of all the ax went fly
round and round over the top of alphons head with an angri
whirl and such extraordinari swift that it look like a
continu band of steel ever get nearer and yet nearer
to that unhappi individu skull till at last it graze it
as it flew then suddenli the motion wa chang and it seem
to liter flow up and down hi bodi and limb never more
than an eighth of an inch from them and yet never strike them
it wa a wonder sight to see the littl man fix there
have appar realiz that to move would be to run the risk
of sudden death while hi black tormentor tower over him
and wrap him round with the quick flash of the ax for
a minut or more thi went on till suddenli i saw the move
bright travel down the side of alphons face and then
outward and stop as it did so a tuft of someth black fell
to the ground it wa the tip of on of the littl frenchman
curl mustachio
umslopogaa leant upon the handl of inkosikaa and broke into
a long low laugh and alphons overcom with fear sank into
a sit postur on the ground while we stood astonish at
thi exhibit of almost superhuman skill and masteri of a weapon
inkosikaa is sharp enough he shout the blow that clip
the buffaloheif horn would have split a man from the crown
to the chin few could have struck it but i none could have
struck it and not taken off the shoulder too look thou littl
heifer am i a good man to laugh at thinkest thou for a space
hast thou stood within a hairsbreadth of death laugh not
again lest the hairsbreadth be want i have spoken
what meanest thou by such mad trick i ask of umslopogaa
indignantli sure thou art mad twenti time didst thou
go near to slai the man
and yet macumazahn i slew not thrice as inkosikaa flew
the spirit enter into me to end him and send her crash
through hi skull but i did not nai it wa but a jest but
tell the heifer that it is not well to mock at such as i
now i go to make a shield for i smell blood macumazahn of
a truth i smell blood befor the battl hast thou not seen
the vultur grow of a sudden in the sky thei smell the blood
macumazahn and my scent is more keen than their there is
a dry oxhid down yonder i go to make a shield
that is an uncomfort retain of your said mr mackenzi
who had wit thi extraordinari scene he ha frighten
alphons out of hi wit look and he point to the frenchman
who with a scare white face and trembl limb wa make
hi wai into the hous i dont think that he will ever laugh
at le monsieur noir again
ye answer i it is ill jest with such as he when
he is rous he is like a fiend and yet he ha a kind heart
in hi own fierc wai i rememb year ago see him nurs
a sick child for a week he is a strang charact but true
as steel and a strong stick to rest on in danger
he sai he smell blood said mr mackenzi i onli trust
he is not right i am get veri fear about my littl girl
she must have gone far or she would be home by now it is
halfpast three oclock
i point out that she had taken food with her and veri like
would not in the ordinari cours of event return till nightfal
but i myself felt veri anxiou and fear that my anxieti betrai
itself
shortli after thi the peopl whom mr mackenzi had sent out
to search for flossi return state that thei had follow
the spoor of the donkei for a coupl of mile and had then lost
it on some stoni ground nor could thei discov it again thei
had howev scour the countri far and wide but without success
after thi the afternoon wore drearili on and toward even
there still be no sign of flossi our anxieti grew veri
keen as for the poor mother she wa quit prostrat by her
fear and no wonder but the father kept hi head wonderfulli
well everyth that could be done wa done peopl were sent
out in all direct shot were fire and a continu outlook
kept from the great tree but without avail
and then it grew dark and still no sign of fairhair littl
flossi
at eight oclock we had supper it wa but a sorrow meal
and mr mackenzi did not appear at it we three also were veri
silent for in addit to our natur anxieti as to the fate
of the child we were weigh down by the sens that we had brought
thi troubl on the head of our kind host when supper wa nearli
at an end i made an excus to leav the tabl i want to get
outsid and think the situat over i went on to the veranda
and have lit my pipe sat down on a seat about a dozen feet
from the righthand end of the structur which wa as the reader
mai rememb exactli opposit on of the narrow door of the
protect wall that enclos the hous and flower garden i
had been sit there perhap six or seven minut when i thought
i heard the door move i look in that direct and i listen
but be unabl to make out anyth conclud that i must
have been mistaken it wa a darkish night the moon not have
yet risen
anoth minut pass when suddenli someth round fell with
a soft but heavi thud upon the stone floor of the veranda
and came bound and roll along past me for a moment i
did not rise but sat wonder what it could be final i
conclud it must have been an anim just then howev anoth
idea struck me and i got up quick enough the thing lai quit
still a few feet beyond me i put down my hand toward it and
it did not move clearli it wa not an anim my hand touch
it it wa soft and warm and heavi hurriedli i lift it and
held it up against the faint starlight
it wa a newli sever human head
i am an old hand and not easili upset but i own that that ghastli
sight made me feel sick how had the thing come there whose
wa it i put it down and ran to the littl doorwai i could
see noth hear nobodi i wa about to go out into the dark
beyond but rememb that to do so wa to expos myself to
the risk of be stab i drew back shut the door and bolt it
then i return to the veranda and in as careless a voic as
i could command call curti i fear howev that my tone
must have betrai me for not onli sir henri but also good and
mackenzi rose from the tabl and came hurri out
what is it said the clergyman anxious
then i had to tell them
mr mackenzi turn pale as death under hi red skin we were
stand opposit the hall door and there wa a light in it
so that i could see he snatch the head up by the hair and
held it against the light
it is the head of on of the men who accompani flossi he
said with a gasp thank god it is not her
we all stood and stare at each other aghast what wa to be done
just then there wa a knock at the door that i had bolt
and a voic cri open my father open
the door wa unlock and in sped a terrifi man he wa on
of the spi who had been sent out
my father he cri the masai ar on us a great bodi of
them have pass round the hill and ar move toward the old
stone kraal down by the littl stream my father make strong
thy heart in the midst of them i saw the white ass and on

came out there wa a moment paus and then in stalk a
masai elmoran clad in the full war panopli that i have alreadi
describ but bear a larg basket in hi hand the moonlight
shone bright upon hi great spear as he walk he wa physic
a splendid man appar about thirtyf year of ag inde
none of the masai that i saw were under six feet high though
mostli quit young when he got opposit to us he halt put
down the basket and stuck the spike of hi spear into the ground
so that it stood upright
let us talk he said the first messeng we sent to you
could not talk and he point to the head which lai upon the
pave of the stoep a ghastli sight in the moonlight but
i have word to speak if ye have ear to hear also i bring
present and he point to the basket and laugh with an air
of swagger insol that is perfectli indescrib and
yet which on could not but admir see that he wa surround
by enemi
sai on said mr mackenzi
i am the lygonani war captain of a parti of the masai of
the guasa amboni i and my men follow these three white men
and he point to sir henri good and myself but thei were
too clever for us and escap hither we have a quarrel with
them and ar go to kill them
ar you my friend said i to myself
in follow these men we thi morn caught two black men
on black woman a white donkei and a white girl on of the
black men we kill there is hi head upon the pavement the
other ran awai the black woman the littl white girl and
the white ass we took and brought with us in proof thereof
have i brought thi basket that she carri is it not thy
daughter basket
mr mackenzi nod and the warrior went on
good with thee and thy daughter we have no quarrel nor do
we wish to harm thee save as to thy cattl which we have alreadi
gather two hundr and forti head a beast for everi man
father endnot 6
here mr mackenzi gave a groan as he greatli valu thi herd
of cattl which he bred with much care and troubl
so save for the cattl thou mayst go free more especi
he ad frankli glanc at the wall as thi place would
be a difficult on to take but as to these men it is otherwis
we have follow them for night and dai and must kill them
were we to return to our kraal without have done so all the
girl would make a mock of us so howev troublesom it
mai be thei must die
now i have a proposit for thee we would not harm the
littl girl she is too fair to harm and ha besid a brave spirit
give us on of these three men a life for a life and we
will let her go and throw in the black woman with her also
thi is a fair offer white man we ask but for on not for
the three we must take anoth opportun to kill the other
two i do not even pick my man though i should prefer the big
on point to sir henri he look strong and would die
more slowli
and if i sai i will not yield the man said mr mackenzi
nai sai not so white man answer the masai for then thy
daughter di at dawn and the woman with her sai thou hast
no other child were she older i would take her for a servant
but as she is so young i will slai her with my own hand ay
with thi veri spear thou canst come and see an thou wilt
i give thee a safe conduct and the fiend laugh aloud as
hi brutal jest
meanwhil i had been think rapidli as on doe in emerg
and had come to the conclus that i would exchang myself against
flossi i scarc like to mention the matter for fear it should
be misunderstood prai do not let ani on be misl into think
that there wa anyth heroic about thi or ani such nonsens
it wa mere a matter of common sens and common justic
my life wa an old and worthless on her wa young and valuabl
her death would pretti well kill her father and mother also
whilst nobodi would be much the wors for mine inde sever
charit institut would have caus to rejoic thereat
it wa indirectli through me that the dear littl girl wa in
her present posit lastli a man wa better fit to meet
death in such a peculiarli aw form than a sweet young girl
not howev that i meant to let these gentri tortur me to
death i am far too much of a coward to allow that be natur
a timid man my plan wa to see the girl safe exchang and
then to shoot myself trust that the almighti would take the
peculiar circumst of the case into consider and pardon
the act all thi and more went through my mind in veri few
second
all right mackenzi i said you can tell the man that i
will exchang myself against flossi onli i stipul that she
shall be safe in thi hous befor thei kill me
eh said sir henri and good simultan that you dont
no no said mr mackenzi i will have no man blood upon
my hand if it pleas god that my daughter should die thi
aw death hi will be done you ar a brave man which i
am not by ani mean and a nobl man quatermain but you shall
not go
if noth els turn up i shall go i said decidedli
thi is an import matter said mackenzi address the
lygonani and we must think it over you shall have our answer
at dawn
veri well white man answer the savag indiffer onli
rememb if thy answer is late thy littl white bud will never
grow into a flower that is all for i shall cut it with thi
and he touch the spear i should have thought that thou wouldst
plai a trick and attack us at night but i know from the woman
with the girl that your men ar down at the coast and that thou
hast but twenti men here it is not wise white man he ad
with a laugh to keep so small a garrison for your boma kraal
well good night and good night to you also other white men
whose eyelid i shall soon close onc and for all at dawn thou
wilt bring me word if not rememb it shall be as i have said
then turn to umslopogaa who had all the while been stand
behind him and shepherd him as it were open the door for
me fellow quick now
thi wa too much for the old chief patienc for the last
ten minut hi lip had been figur speak posit
water over the masai lygonani and thi he could not stand
place hi long hand on the elmoran shoulder he grip it
and gave him such a twist as brought him face to face with himself
then thrust hi fierc counten to within a few inch
of the masai evil featherfram featur he said in a low
growl voic
seest thou me
ay fellow i see thee
and seest thou thi and he held inkosikaa befor hi ey
ay fellow i see the toi what of it
thou masai dog thou boast windbag thou captur of littl
girl with thi toi will i hew thee limb from limb well
for thee that thou art a herald or even now would i strew thy
member about the grass
the masai shook hi great spear and laugh loud and long as
he answer i would that thou stoodst against me man to man
and we would see and again he turn to go still laugh
thou shalt stand against me man to man be not afraid repli
umslopogaa still in the same omin voic thou shalt stand
face to face with umslopogaa of the blood of chaka of the
peopl of the amazulu a captain in the regiment of the nkomabakosi
as mani have done befor and bow thyself to inkosikaa as
mani have done befor ay laugh on laugh on tomorrow night
shall the jackal laugh as thei crunch thy rib
when the lygonani had gone on of us thought of open the
basket he had brought as a proof that flossi wa realli their
prison on lift the lid it wa found to contain a most
love specimen of both bulb and flower of the goya lili which
i have alreadi describ in full bloom and quit uninjur
and what wa more a note in flossi childish hand written in
pencil upon a greasi piec of paper that had been us to wrap
up some food in
dearest father and mother ran the note the masai caught
us when we were come home with the lili i tri to escap
but could not thei kill tom the other man ran awai thei
have not hurt nurs and me but sai that thei mean to exchang
us against on of mr quatermain parti i will have noth
of the sort do not let anybodi give hi life for me try and
attack them at night thei ar go to feast on three bullock
thei have stolen and kill i have my pistol and if no help
come by dawn i will shoot myself thei shall not kill me
if so rememb me alwai dearest father and mother i am veri
frighten but i trust in god i dare not write ani more as
thei ar begin to notic goodby flossi
scrawl across the outsid of thi wa love to mr quatermain
thei ar go to take the basket so he will get the lili
when i read those word written by that brave littl girl in
an hour of danger suffici near and horribl to have turn
the brain of a strong man i own i wept and onc more in my
heart i vow that she should not die while my life could be
given to save her
then eagerli quickli almost fierc we fell to discuss
the situat again i said that i would go and again mackenzi
negativ it and curti and good like the true men that thei
ar vow that if i did thei would go with me and die back
to back with me
it is i said at last absolut necessari that an effort
of some sort should be made befor the morn
then let us attack them with what forc we can muster and take
our chanc said sir henri
ay ay growl umslopogaa in zulu spoken like a man incubu
what is there to be afraid of two hundr and fifti masai
forsooth how mani ar we the chief there mr mackenzi ha
twenti men and thou macumazahn hast five men and there ar
also five white men that is thirti men in all enough
enough listen now macumazahn thou who art veri clever and
old in war what sai the maid these men eat and make merri
let it be their funer feast what said the dog whom i hope
to hew down at daybreak that he fear no attack becaus we
were so few knowest thou the old kraal where the men have camp
i saw it thi morn it is thu and he drew an oval on the
floor here is the big entranc fill up with thorn bush
and open on to a steep rise why incubu thou and i with
ax will hold it against an hundr men strive to break out
look now thu shall the battl go just as the light begin
to glint upon the oxen horn not befor or it will be too
dark and not later or thei will be awaken and perceiv us
let bougwan creep round with ten men to the top end of the
kraal where the narrow entranc is let them silent slai
the sentri there so that he make no sound and stand readi
then incubu let thee and me and on of the askari the on
with the broad chest he is a brave man creep to the wide
entranc that is fill with thorn bush and there also slai
the sentri and arm with battleax take our stand also on
on each side of the pathwai and on a few pace beyond to deal
with such as pass the twain at the gate it is there that the
rush will come that will leav sixteen men let these men
be divid into two parti with on of which shalt thou go
macumazahn and with on the prai man mr mackenzi and
all arm with rifl let them make their wai on to the right
side of the kraal and on to the left and when thou macumazahn
lowest like an ox all shall open fire with the gun upon the
sleep men be veri care not to hit the littl maid
then shall bougwan at the far end and hi ten men rais the
warcri and spring over the wall put the masai there to
the sword and it shall happen that be yet heavi with food
and sleep and bewild by the fire of the gun the fall
of men and the spear of bougwan the soldier shall rise and
rush like wild game toward the thornstop entranc and there
the bullet from either side shall plough through them and there
shall incubu and the askari and i wait for those who break across
such is my plan macumazahn if thou hast a better name it
when he had done i explain to the other such portion of
hi scheme as thei had fail to understand and thei all join

the best chanc of success that such a forlorn hope would admit
of which howev consid the enorm odd and the charact
of our foe wa not veri great
ah old lion i said to umslopogaa thou knowest how to lie
in wait as well as how to bite where to seiz as well as where
to hang on

chapter vi
the night wear on
as mai be imagin at the veri first sign of a masai the entir
popul of the mission station had sought refug insid the
stout stone wall and were now to be seen men women and
countless children huddl up togeth in littl group and

and squat the group of arm men some with rifl in their
hand and other with spear and shield follow with eager
attent everi word that fell from the speaker lip the
white light of the moon peer in beneath the lofti bough threw
a strang wild glamour over the scene whilst the melancholi
sough of the night wind pass through the million of pine
needl overhead ad a sad of it own to what wa alreadi
a suffici tragic occas

to the throne of power prai that he in the hollow of whose
hand lie all our live who giveth life and giveth death mai
be pleas to make strong our arm that we mai prevail in what
await us at the morn light
and he knelt down an exampl that we all follow except umslopogaa
who still stood in the background grimli lean on inkosikaa
the fierc old zulu had no god and worship nought unless
it were hi battleax
oh god of god began the clergyman hi deep voic tremul
with emot echo up in the silenc even to the leafi roof
protector of the oppress refug of those in danger guardian
of the helpless hear thou our prayer almighti father to thee

he ceas and after a moment silenc we all rose and then
began our prepar in good earnest as umslopogaa said
it wa time to stop talk and get to busi the men who
were to form each littl parti were carefulli select and still
more carefulli and minut instruct as to what wa to be done
after much consider it wa agre that the ten men led
by good whose duti it wa to stamped the camp were not to
carri firearm that is with the except of good himself
who had a revolv as well as a short sword the masai sime
which i had taken from the bodi of our poor servant who wa murder
in the cano we fear that if thei had firearm the result
of three crossfir carri on at onc would be that some of
our own peopl would be shot besid it appear to all of
us that the work thei had to do would best be carri out with
cold steel especi to umslopogaa who wa inde a great
advoc of cold steel we had with us four winchest repeat
rifl besid half a dozen martini i arm myself with on
of the repeat my own an excel weapon for thi kind
of work where great rapid of fire is desir and fit
with ordinari flapsight instead of the cumbersom slide mechan
which thei gener have mr mackenzi took anoth and the
two remain on were given to two of hi men who understood
the us of them and were note shot the martini and some
rifl of mr mackenzi were serv out togeth with a plenti
suppli of ammunit to the other nativ who were to form the
two parti whose duti it wa to be to open fire from separ
side of the kraal on the sleep masai and who were fortun
all more or less accustom to the us of a gun
as for umslopogaa we know how he wa arm with an ax
it mai be rememb that he sir henri and the strongest of
the askari were to hold the thornstop entranc to the kraal
against the anticip rush of men strive to escap of cours
for such a purpos as thi gun were useless therefor sir
henri and the askari proceed to arm themselv in like fashion
it so happen that mr mackenzi had in hi littl store a select
of the veri best and englishmad hammerback axehead sir
henri select on of these weigh about two and a half pound
and veri broad in the blade and the askari took anoth a size
smaller after umslopogaa had put an extra edg on these two
axehead we fix them to three feet six helv of which mr
mackenzi fortun had some in stock made of a light but
exceedingli tough nativ wood someth like english ash onli
more springi when two suitabl helv had been select with
great care and the end of the haft notch to prevent the hand
from slip the axehead were fix on them as firmli as
possibl and the weapon immers in a bucket of water for half
an hour the result of thi wa to swell the wood in the socket
in such a fashion that noth short of burn would get it
out again when thi import matter had been attend to by
umslopogaa i went into my room and proceed to open a littl
tinlin deal case which contain what do you think
noth more or less than four mail shirt
it had happen to us three on a previou journei that we had
made in anoth part of africa to ow our live to iron shirt
of nativ make and rememb thi i had suggest befor
we start on our present hazard expedit that we should
have some made to fit us there wa a littl difficulti about
thi as armourmak is pretti well an extinct art but thei
can do most thing in the wai of steel work in birmingham if
thei ar put to it and you will pai the price and the end of
it wa that thei turn us out the loveliest steel shirt it
is possibl to see the workmanship wa exceedingli fine the
web be compos of thousand upon thousand of stout but tini
ring of the best steel made these shirt or rather steelsleev
and highneck jersei were line with ventil wash leather
were not bright but brown like the barrel of a gun and mine
weigh exactli seven pound and fit me so well that i found
i could wear it for dai next to my skin without be chafe
sir henri had two on of the ordinari make viz a jersei with
littl depend flap meant to afford some protect to the
upper part of the thigh and anoth of hi own design fashion
on the pattern of the garment advertis as combin and
weigh twelv pound thi combin shirt of which the
seat wa made of washleath protect the whole bodi down
to the knee but wa rather more cumbersom inasmuch as it
had to be lace up at the back and of cours involv some
extra weight with these shirt were what look like four brown
cloth travel cap with ear piec each of these cap wa
howev quilt with steel link so as to afford a most valuabl
protect for the head
it seem almost laughabl to talk of steel shirt in these dai
of bullet against which thei ar of cours quit useless but
where on ha to do with savag arm with cut weapon
such as assegai or battleax thei afford the most valuabl
protect be if well made quit invulner to them
i have often thought that if onli the english govern had
in our savag war and more especi in the zulu war thought
fit to serv out light steel shirt there would be mani a man
aliv todai who as it is is dead and forgotten
to return on the present occas we bless our foresight in
bring these shirt and also our good luck in that thei had
not been stolen by our rascal bearer when thei ran awai with
our good as curti had two and after consider deliber
had made up hi mind to wear hi combin on himself the
extra three or four pound weight be a matter of no account
to so strong a man and the protect afford to the thigh
be a veri import matter to a fight man not arm with
a shield of ani kind i suggest that he should lend the other
to umslopogaa who wa to share the danger and the glori of
hi post he readili consent and call the zulu who came
bear sir henri ax which he had now fix up to hi satisfact
with him when we show him the steel shirt and explain
to him that we want him to wear it he at first declin sai
that he had fought in hi own skin for thirti year and that
he wa not go to begin now to fight in an iron on thereupon
i took a heavi spear and spread the shirt upon the floor
drove the spear down upon it with all my strength the weapon
rebound without leav a mark upon the temper steel thi
exhibit half convert him and when i point out to him
how necessari it wa that he should not let ani oldfashion
prejudic he might possess stand in the wai of a precaut
which might preserv a valuabl life at a time when men were
scarc and also that if he wore thi shirt he might dispens
with a shield and so have both hand free he yield at onc
and proceed to invest hi frame with the iron skin and
inde although made for sir henri it fit the great zulu
like a skin the two men were almost of a height and though
curti look the bigger man i am inclin to think that the
differ wa more imaginari than real the fact be that
although he wa plumper and rounder he wa not realli bigger
except in the arm umslopogaa had compar speak
thin arm but thei were as strong as wire rope at ani rate
when thei both stood ax in hand invest in the brown mail
which clung to their mighti form like a web garment show
the swell of everi muscl and the curv of everi line thei form
a pair that ani ten men might shrink from meet
it wa now nearli on oclock in the morn and the spi report
that after have drunk the blood of the oxen and eaten enorm
quantiti of meat the masai were go to sleep round their
watchfir but that sentri had been post at each open
of the kraal flossi thei ad wa sit not far from
the wall in the centr of the western side of the kraal and
by her were the nurs and the white donkei which wa tether
to a peg her feet were bound with a rope and warrior were
ly about all round her
as there wa absolut noth further that could be done then
we all took some supper and went to lie down for a coupl of
hour i could not help admir the wai in which old umslopogaa
flung himself upon the floor and unmind of what wa hang
over him instantli sank into a deep sleep i do not know how
it wa with the other but i could not do as much inde
as is usual with me on these occas i am sorri to sai that
i felt rather frighten and now that some of the enthusiasm
had gone out of me and i began to calmli contempl what we
had undertaken to do truth compel me to add that i did not
like it we were but thirti men all told a good mani of whom
were no doubt quit unus to fight and we were go to
engag two hundr and fifti of the fiercest bravest and most
formid savag in africa who to make matter wors were
protect by a stone wall it wa inde a mad undertak
and what made it even madder wa the exceed improb
of our be abl to take up our posit without attract
the notic of the sentri of cours if we onc did that
and ani slight accid such as the chanc discharg of a gun
might do it we were done for for the whole camp would be
up in a second and our onli hope lai in surpris
the bed whereon i lai indulg in these uncomfort reflect
wa near an open window that look on to the veranda through
which came an extraordinari sound of groan and weep for
a time i could not make out what it wa but at last i got up
and put my head out of the window stare about present
i saw a dim figur kneel on the end of the veranda and beat
hi breast in which i recogn alphons not be abl
to understand hi french talk or what on earth he wa at i call
to him and ask him what he wa do
ah monsieur he sigh i do make prayer for the soul of
those whom i shall slai tonight
inde i said then i wish that you would do it a littl
more quietli
alphons retreat and i heard no more of hi groan and so
the time pass till at length mr mackenzi call me in a whisper
through the window for of cours everyth had now to be done
in the most absolut silenc three oclock he said we
must begin to move at halfpast
i told him to come in and present he enter and i am bound
to sai that if it had not been that just then i had not got a
laugh anywher about me i should have explod at the sight
he present arm for battl to begin with he had on a clergyman
black swallowtail and a kind of broadrim black felt hat
both of which he had don on account he said of their dark
colour in hi hand wa the winchest repeat rifl we had
lent him and stuck in an elast cricket belt like those
worn by english boi were first a huge buckhornhandl carv
knife with a guard to it and next a longbarrel colt revolv
ah my friend he said see me stare at hi belt you
ar look at my carver i thought it might come in handi
if we came to close quarter it is excel steel and mani
is the pig i have kill with it
by thi time everybodi wa up and dress i put on a light
norfolk jacket over my mail shirt in order to have a pocket handi
to hold my cartridg and buckl on my revolv good did
the same but sir henri put on noth except hi mail shirt
steellin cap and a pair of veldtschoon or soft hide shoe
hi leg be bare from the knee down hi revolv he strap
on round hi middl outsid the armour shirt
meanwhil umslopogaa wa muster the men in the squar under
the big tree and go the round to see that each wa properli
arm etc at the last moment we made on chang find
that two of the men who were to have gone with the fire parti
knew littl or noth of gun but were good spearsmen we took
awai their rifl suppli them with shield and long spear
of the masai pattern and took them off to join curti umslopogaa
and the askari in hold the wide open it have becom
clear to us that three men howev brave and strong were too
few for the work
chapter vii
a slaughter grim and great
then there wa a paus and we stood there in the chilli silent
dark wait till the moment came to start it wa perhap
the most try time of all that slow slow quarter of an
hour the minut seem to drag along with leaden feet and
the quiet the solemn hush that brood over all big as
it were with a come fate wa most oppress to the spirit
i onc rememb have to get up befor dawn to see a man hang
and i then went through a veri similar set of sensat onli
in the present instanc my feel were anim by that more
vivid and person element which natur appertain rather
to the person to be oper on than to the most sympathet
spectat the solemn face of the men well awar that the
short passag of an hour would mean for some and perhap all
of them the last great passag to the unknown or oblivion the
bate whisper in which thei spoke even sir henri continu
and thought examin of hi woodcutt ax and the fidgeti
wai in which good kept polish hi eyeglass all told the same
tale of nerv stretch pretti nigh to breakingpoint onli
umslopogaa lean as usual upon inkosikaa and take an
occasion pinch of snuff wa to all appear perfectli and
complet unmov noth could touch hi iron nerv
the moon went down for a long while she had been get nearer
and nearer to the horizon now she final sank and left the
world in dark save for a faint grei ting in the eastern
sky that pale herald the dawn
mr mackenzi stood watch in hand hi wife cling to hi arm
and strive to stifl her sob
twenti minut to four he said it ought to be light enough
to attack at twenti minut past four captain good had better
be move he will want three or four minut start
good gave on final polish to hi eyeglass nod to us in a
jocular sort of wai which i could not help feel it must
have cost him someth to muster up and ever polit took
off hi steellin cap to mr mackenzi and start for hi
posit at the head of the kraal to reach which he had to make
a detour by some path known to the nativ
just then on of the boi came in and report that everybodi
in the masai camp with the except of the two sentri who
were walk up and down in front of the respect entranc
appear to be fast asleep then the rest of us took the road
first came the guid then sir henri umslopogaa the wakwafi
askari and mr mackenzi two mission nativ arm with long
spear and shield i follow immedi after with alphons
and five nativ all arm with gun and mr mackenzi brought
up the rear with the six remain nativ
the cattl kraal where the masai were camp lai at the foot
of the hill on which the hous stood or roughli speak about
eight hundr yard from the mission build the first five
hundr yard of thi distanc we travers quietli inde but
at a good pace after that we crept forward as silent as a
leopard on hi prei glide like ghost from bush to bush and
stone to stone when i had gone a littl wai i chanc to look
behind me and saw the redoubt alphons stagger along
with white face and trembl knee and hi rifl which wa
at full cock point directli at the small of my back have
halt and carefulli put the rifl at safeti we start again
and all went well till we were within on hundr yard or so
of the kraal when hi teeth began to chatter in the most aggress wai
if you dont stop that i will kill you i whisper savag
for the idea of have all our live sacrif to a toothchatt
cook wa too much for me i began to fear that he would betrai
us and heartili wish we had left him behind
but monsieur i cannot help it he answer it is the cold
here wa a dilemma but fortun i devis a plan in the
pocket of the coat i had on wa a small piec of dirti rag that
i had us some time befor to clean a gun with put thi in
your mouth i whisper again give him the rag and if i
hear anoth sound you ar a dead man i knew that that would
stifl the clatter of hi teeth i must have look as if i
meant what i said for he instantli obei me and continu
hi journei in silenc
then we crept on again
at last we were within fifti yard of the kraal between us
and it wa an open space of slope grass with onli on mimosa
bush and a coupl of tussock of a sort of thistl for cover
we were still hidden in fairli thick bush it wa begin
to grow light the star had pale and a sickli gleam plai
about the east and wa reflect on the earth we could see
the outlin of the kraal clearli enough and could also make
out the faint glimmer of the dy ember of the masai campfir
we halt and watch for the sentri we knew wa post at
the open present he appear a fine tall fellow walk
idli up and down within five pace of the thornstop entranc
we had hope to catch him nap but it wa not to be he
seem particularli wide awak if we could not kill that man
and kill him silent we were lost there we crouch and watch
him present umslopogaa who wa a few pace ahead of me
turn and made a sign and next second i saw him go down on
hi stomach like a snake and take an opportun when the
sentri head wa turn begin to work hi wai through the grass
without a sound
the unconsci sentri commenc to hum a littl tune and umslopogaa
crept on he reach the shelter of the mimosa bush unperceiv
and there wait still the sentri walk up and down present
he turn and look over the wall into the camp instantli
the human snake who wa stalk him glide on ten yard and
got behind on of the tussock of the thistlelik plant reach
it as the elmoran turn again as he did so hi ey fell upon
thi patch of thistl and it seem to strike him that it did
not look quit right he advanc a pace toward it halt
yawn stoop down pick up a littl pebbl and threw it
at it it hit umslopogaa upon the head luckili not upon the
armour shirt had it done so the clink would have betrai us
luckili too the shirt wa brown and not bright steel which
would certainli have been detect appar satisfi that
there wa noth wrong he then gave over hi investig
and content himself with lean on hi spear and stand
gaze idli at the tuft for at least three minut did he stand
thu plung appar in a gentl reveri and there we lai
in the last extrem of anxieti expect everi moment that
we should be discov or that some untoward accid would
happen i could hear alphons teeth go like anyth on
the oil rag and turn my head round made an aw face at
him but i am bound to state that my own heart wa at much the
same game as the frenchman castanet while the perspir
wa pour from my bodi caus the washleatherlin shirt
to stick to me unpleasantli and altogeth i wa in the pitiabl
state known by schoolboi as a blue fright
at last the ordeal came to an end the sentri glanc at the
east and appear to note with satisfact that hi period
of duti wa come to an end as inde it wa onc and for
all for he rub hi hand and began to walk again briskli
to warm himself
the moment hi back wa turn the long black snake glide on
again and reach the other thistl tuft which wa within a
coupl of pace of hi return beat
back came the sentri and stroll right past the tuft utterli
unconsci of the presenc that wa crouch behind it had
he look down he could scarc have fail to see but he did
not do so
he pass and then hi hidden enemi erect himself
and with outstretch hand follow in hi track
a moment more and just as the elmoran wa about to turn the
great zulu made a spring and in the grow light we could see
hi long lean hand close round the masai throat then follow
a convuls twine of the two dark bodi and in anoth second
i saw the masai head bent back and heard a sharp crack someth
like that of a dry twig snap and he fell down upon the ground
hi limb move spasmod
umslopogaa had put out all hi iron strength and broken the
warrior neck
for a moment he knelt upon hi victim still grip hi throat
till he wa sure that there wa noth more to fear from him
and then he rose and beckon to us to advanc which we did
on all four like a coloni of huge ap on reach the kraal
we saw that the masai had still further choke thi entranc
which wa about ten feet wide no doubt in order to guard against
attack by drag four or five top of mimosa tree up to
it so much the better for us i reflect the more obstruct
there wa the slower would thei be abl to come through here
we separ mackenzi and hi parti creep up under the shadow
of the wall to the left while sir henri and umslopogaa took
their station on on each side of the thorn fenc the two spearmen
and the askari ly down in front of it i and my men crept
on up the right side of the kraal which wa about fifti pace
long
when i wa twothird up i halt and place my men at distanc
of four pace from on anoth keep alphons close to me
howev then i peep for the first time over the wall it
wa get fairli light now and the first thing i saw wa the
white donkei exactli opposit to me and close by it i could
make out the pale face of littl flossi who wa sit as
the lad had describ some ten pace from the wall round her
lai mani warrior sleep at distanc all over the surfac
of the kraal were the remain of fire round each of which slept
some fiveandtwenti masai for the most part gorg with food
now and then a man would rais himself yawn and look at the
east which wa turn primros but none got up i determin
to wait anoth five minut both to allow the light to increas
so that we could make better shoot and to give good and hi
parti of whom we could see or hear noth everi opportun
to make readi
the quiet dawn began to throw her everwiden mantl over plain
and forest and river mighti kenia wrap in the silenc
of etern snow look out across the earth till present
a beam from the unrisen sun lit upon hi heavenkiss crest
and purpl it with blood the sky abov grew blue and tender
as a mother smile a bird began to pipe hi morn song and
a littl breez pass through the bush shook down the dewdrop
in million to refresh the wake world everywher wa peac
and the happi of aris strength everywher save in the
heart of cruel man
suddenli just as i wa nerv myself for the signal have
alreadi select my man on whom i meant to open fire a great
fellow sprawl on the ground within three feet of littl flossi
alphons teeth began to chatter again like the hoof of
a gallop giraff make a great nois in the silenc the
rag had drop out in the agit of hi mind instantli
a masai within three pace of us woke and sit up gaze
about him look for the caus of the sound move beyond
myself i brought the buttend of my rifl down on to the pit
of the frenchman stomach thi stop hi chatter but
as he doubl up he manag to let off hi gun in such a manner
that the bullet pass within an inch of my head
there wa no need for a signal now from both side of the kraal
broke out a wave line of fire in which i myself join manag
with a snap shot to knock over my masai by flossi just as he
wa jump up then from the top end of the kraal there rang
an aw yell in which i rejoic to recogn good pierc
note rise clear and shrill abov the din and in anoth second
follow such a scene as i have never seen befor nor shall again
with an univers howl of terror and furi the brawni crowd of
savag within the kraal sprang to their feet mani of them to
fall again beneath our welldirect hail of lead befor thei
had move a yard for a moment thei stood undecid and then
hear the cri and curs that rose unceasingli from the top
end of the kraal and bewild by the storm of bullet thei
as by on impuls rush down toward the thornstop entranc
as thei went we kept pour our fire with terribl effect into
the thicken mob as fast as we could load i had empti my
repeat of the ten shot it contain and wa just begin
to slip in some more when i bethought me of littl flossi
look up i saw that the white donkei wa ly kick have
been knock over either by on of our bullet or a masai spearthrust
there were no live masai near but the black nurs wa on
her feet and with a spear cut the rope that bound flossi
feet next second she ran to the wall of the kraal and began
to climb over it an exampl which the littl girl follow
but flossi wa evid veri stiff and cramp and could
onli go slowli and as she went two masai fly down the kraal
caught sight of her and rush toward her to kill her the
first fellow came up just as the poor littl girl after a desper
effort to climb the wall fell back into the kraal up flash
the great spear and as it did so a bullet from my rifl found
it home in the holder rib and over he went like a shot rabbit
but behind him wa the other man and ala i had onli that
on cartridg in the magazin flossi had scrambl to her
feet and wa face the second man who wa advanc with rais
spear i turn my head asid and felt sick as death i could
not bear to see him stab her glanc up again to my surpris
i saw the masai spear ly on the ground while the man himself
wa stagger about with both hand to hi head suddenli i
saw a puff of smoke proceed appar from flossi and the
man fell down headlong then i rememb the derring pistol
she carri and saw that she had fire both barrel of it at
him therebi save her life in anoth instant she had made
an effort and assist by the nurs who wa ly on the top
had scrambl over the wall and i knew that she wa compar
speak safe
all thi take time to tell but i do not suppos that it took
more than fifteen second to enact i soon got the magazin
of the repeat fill again with cartridg and onc more open
fire not on the seeth black mass which wa gather at the
end of the kraal but on fugit who bethought them to climb
the wall i pick off sever of these men move down toward
the end of the kraal as i did so and arriv at the corner
or rather the bend of the oval in time to see and by mean
of my rifl to assist in the mighti struggl that took place
there
by thi time some two hundr masai allow that we had up
to the present account for fifti had gather togeth in
front of the thornstop entranc driven thither by the spear
of good men whom thei doubtless suppos were a larg forc
instead of be but ten strong for some reason it never occur
to them to try and rush the wall which thei could have scrambl
over with compar eas thei all made for the fenc which
wa realli a strongli interwoven fortif with a bound
the first warrior went at it and even befor he touch the
ground on the other side i saw sir henri great ax swing up
and fall with aw forc upon hi feather headpiec and he
sank into the middl of the thorn then with a yell and a crash
thei began to break through as thei might and ever as thei came
the great ax swung and inkosikaa flash and thei fell dead
on by on each man thu help to build up a barrier against
hi fellow those who escap the ax of the pair fell at
the hand of the askari and the two mission kaffir and those
who pass scatheless from them were brought low by my own and
mackenzi fire
faster and more furiou grew the fight singl masai would
spring upon the dead bodi of their comrad and engag on
or other of the axemen with their long spear but thank chiefli
to the mail shirt the result wa alwai the same present
there wa a great swing of the ax a crash sound and anoth
dead masai that is if the man wa engag with sir henri
if it wa umslopogaa that he fought with the result inde
would be the same but it would be differ attain it
wa but rare that the zulu us the crash doublehand
stroke on the contrari he did littl more than tap continu
at hi adversari head peck at it with the poleax end
of the ax as a woodpeck endnot 7 peck at rotten wood
present a peck would go home and hi enemi would drop down
with a neat littl circular hole in hi forehead or skull exactli
similar to that which a cheesescoop make in a chees he never
us the broad blade of the ax except when hard press or
when strike at a shield he told me afterward that he did
not consid it sportsmanlik
good and hi men were quit close by now and our peopl had
to ceas fire into the mass for fear of kill some of them
as it wa on of them wa slain in thi wai mad and desper
with fear the masai by a frantic effort burst through the thorn
fenc and piledup dead and sweep curti umslopogaa and
the other three befor them into the open and now it wa that
we began to lose men fast down went our poor askari who wa
arm with the ax a great spear stand out a foot behind
hi back and befor long the two spearsmen who had stood with
him went down too dy fight like tiger and other of
our parti share their fate for a moment i fear the fight
wa lost certainli it trembl in the balanc i shout
to my men to cast down their rifl and to take spear and throw
themselv into the mele thei obei their blood be now
thoroughli up and mr mackenzi peopl follow their exampl
thi move had a momentari good result but still the fight hung
in the balanc
our peopl fought magnific hurl themselv upon the
dark mass of elmoran hew thrust slai and be slain
and ever abov the din rose good aw yell of encourag
as he plung to wherev the fight wa thickest and ever with
an almost machinelik regular the two ax rose and fell
carri death and disabl at everi stroke but i could
see that the strain wa begin to tell upon sir henri who
wa bleed from sever flesh wound hi breath wa come
in gasp and the vein stood out on hi forehead like blue and
knot cord even umslopogaa man of iron that he wa wa
hard press i notic that he had given up woodpeck
and wa now us the broad blade of inkosikaa brown
hi enemi wherev he could hit him instead of drill scientif
hole in hi head i myself did not go into the mele but hover
outsid like the swift back in a footbal scrimmag put
a bullet through a masai whenev i got a chanc i wa more
us so i fire fortynin cartridg that morn and i did
not miss mani shot
present do as we would the beam of the balanc began to rise
against us we had not more than fifteen or sixteen effect
left now and the masai had at least fifti of cours if thei
had kept their head and shaken themselv togeth thei could
soon have made an end of the matter but that is just what thei
did not do not have yet recov from their start and some
of them have actual fled from their sleepingplac without
their weapon still by now mani individu were fight with
their normal courag and discret and thi alon wa suffici
to defeat us to make matter wors just then when mackenzi
rifl wa empti a brawni savag arm with a sime or sword
made a rush for him the clergyman flung down hi gun and draw
hi huge carver from hi elast belt hi revolv had drop
out in the fight thei close in desper struggl present
lock in a close embrac missionari and masai roll on the
ground behind the wall and for some time i be ampli occupi
with my own affair and in keep my skin from be prick
remain in ignor of hi fate or how the duel had end
to and fro surg the fight slowli turn round like the vortex
of a human whirlpool and the matter began to look veri bad for
us just then howev a fortun thing happen umslopogaa
either by accid or design broke out of the ring and engag
a warrior at some few pace from it as he did so anoth man
ran up and struck him with all hi forc between hi shoulder
with hi great spear which fall on the tough steel shirt
fail to pierc it and rebound for a moment the man stare
aghast protect armour be unknown among these tribe
and then he yell out at the top of hi voic
thei ar devil bewitch bewitch and seiz by a
sudden panic he threw down hi spear and began to fly i cut
short hi career with a bullet and umslopogaa brain hi man
and then the panic spread to the other
bewitch bewitch thei cri and tri to escap in everi
direct utterli demor and brokenspirit for the most
part even throw down their shield and spear
on the last scene of that dread fight i need not dwell it
wa a slaughter great and grim in which no quarter wa ask
or given on incid howev is worth detail just as
i wa hope that it wa all done with suddenli from under a
heap of slain where he had been hide an unwound warrior
sprang up and clear the pile of dy dead like an antelop
sped like the wind up the kraal toward the spot where i wa
stand at the moment but he wa not alon for umslopogaa
came glide on hi track with the peculiar swallowlik motion
for which he wa note and as thei near me i recogn in
the masai the herald of the previou night find that run
as he would hi pursuer wa gain on him the man halt and
turn round to give battl umslopogaa also pull up
ah ah he cri in mockeri to the elmoran it is thou whom
i talk with last night the lygonani the herald the captur
of littl girl he who would kill a littl girl and thou
didst hope to stand man to man and face to face with umslopogaa
an induna of the tribe of the maquilisini of the peopl of the
amazulu behold thy prayer is grant and i didst swear to
hew thee limb from limb thou insol dog behold i will do
it even now
the masai ground hi teeth with furi and charg at the zulu
with hi spear as he came umslopogaa deftli step asid
and swing inkosikaa high abov hi head with both hand
brought the broad blade down with such fear forc from behind
upon the masai shoulder just where the neck is set into the
frame that it razor edg shore right through bone and flesh
and muscl almost sever the head and on arm from the bodi
ou ejacul umslopogaa contempl the corps of hi foe
i have kept my word it wa a good stroke
chapter viii
alphons explain
and so the fight wa end on return from the shock scene
it suddenli struck me that i had seen noth of alphons sinc
the moment some twenti minut befor for though thi fight
ha taken a long while to describ it did not take long in realiti
when i had been forc to hit him in the wind with the result
of nearli get myself shot fear that the poor littl
man had perish in the battl i began to hunt among the dead
for hi bodi but not be abl either to see or hear anyth
of it i conclud that he must have surviv and walk down
the side of the kraal where we had first taken our stand call
him by name now some fifteen pace back from the kraal wall
stood a veri ancient tree of the banyan speci so ancient
wa it that all the insid had in the cours of ag decai
awai leav noth but a shell of bark
alphons i call as i walk down the wall alphons
oui monsieur answer a voic here am i
i look round but could see nobodi where i cri
here am i monsieur in the tree
i look and there peer out of a hole in the trunk of the
banyan about five feet from the ground i saw a pale face and
a pair of larg mustachio on clip short and the other as
lament out of curl as the tail of a newli whip pug then
for the first time i realiz what i had suspect befor
name that alphons wa an arrant coward i walk up to him
come out of that hole i said
is it finish monsieur he ask anxious quit finish
ah the horror i have undergon and the prayer i have utter
come out you littl wretch i said for i did not feel amiabl
it is all over
so monsieur then my prayer have prevail i emerg
and he did
as we were walk down togeth to join the other who were
gather in a group by the wide entranc to the kraal which
now resembl a verit charnelhous a masai who had escap
so far and been hide under a bush suddenli sprang up and charg
furious at us off went alphons with a howl of terror and
after him flew the masai bent upon do some execut befor
he di he soon overtook the poor littl frenchman and would
have finish him then and there had i not just as alphons
made a last agon doubl in the vain hope of avoid the
yard of steel that wa flash in hi immedi rear manag
to plant a bullet between the elmoran broad shoulder which
brought matter to a satisfactori conclus so far as the frenchman
wa concern but just then he trip and fell flat and the
bodi of the masai fell right on the top of him move convuls
in the death struggl thereupon there aros such a seri of
pierc howl that i conclud that befor he di the savag
must have manag to stab poor alphons i ran up in a hurri
and pull the masai off and there beneath him lai alphons
cover with blood and jerk himself about like a galvan
frog poor fellow thought i he is done for and kneel down
by him i began to search for hi wound as well as hi struggl
would allow
oh the hole in my back he yell i am murder i am
dead oh annett
i search again but could see no wound then the truth dawn
on me the man wa frighten not hurt
get up i shout get up arent you asham of yourself
you ar not touch
thereupon he rose not a penni the wors but monsieur i
thought i wa he said apologet i did not know that
i had conquer then give the bodi of the masai a kick
he ejacul triumphantli ah dog of a black savag thou
art dead what victori
thoroughli disgust i left alphons to look after himself
which he did by follow me like a shadow and proceed to
join the other by the larg entranc the first thing that
i saw wa mackenzi seat on a stone with a handkerchief twist
round hi thigh from which he wa bleed freeli have inde
receiv a spearthrust that pass right through it and still
hold in hi hand hi favourit carv knife now bent nearli
doubl from which i gather that he had been success in
hi rough and tumbl with the elmoran
ah quatermain he sang out in a trembl excit voic
so we have conquer but it is a sorri sight a sorri sight
and then break into broad scotch and glanc at the bent
knife in hi hand it fash me sair to have bent my best carver
on the breastbon of a savag and he laugh hyster
poor fellow what between hi wound and the kill excit
he had undergon hi nerv were much shaken and no wonder
it is hard upon a man of peac and kindli heart to be call
upon to join in such a gruesom busi but there fate put
us sometim into veri comic posit
at the kraal entranc the scene wa a strang on the slaughter
wa over by now and the wound men had been put out of their
pain for no quarter had been given the bushclos entranc
wa trampl flat and in place of bush it wa fill with
the bodi of dead men dead men everywher dead men thei
lai about in knot thei were flung by on and two in everi
posit upon the open space for all the world like the peopl
on the grass in on of the london park on a particularli hot
sundai in august in front of thi entranc on a space which
had been clear of dead and of the shield and spear which
were scatter in all direct as thei had fallen or been thrown
from the hand of their owner stood and lai the survivor of
the aw struggl and at their feet were four wound men
we had gone into the fight thirti strong and of the thirti
but fifteen remain aliv and five of them includ mr mackenzi
were wound two mortal of those who held the entranc
curti and the zulu alon remain good had lost five men kill
i had lost two kill and mackenzi no less than five out of
the six with him as for the survivor thei were with the except
of myself who had never come to close quarter red from head
to foot sir henri armour might have been paint that colour
and utterli exhaust except umslopogaa who as he grimli
stood on a littl mound abov a heap of dead lean as usual
upon hi ax did not seem particularli distress although
the skin over the hole in hi head palpit violent
ah macumazahn he said to me as i limp up feel veri
sick i told thee that it would be a good fight and it ha
never have i seen a better or on more brave fought as
for thi iron shirt sure it is tagati bewitch noth
could pierc it had it not been for the garment i should have
been there and he nod toward the great pile of dead men
beneath him
i give it thee thou art a brave man said sir henri briefli
koo answer the zulu deepli pleas both at the gift and
the compliment thou too incubu didst bear thyself as a
man but i must give thee some lesson with the ax thou dost
wast thy strength
just then mackenzi ask about flossi and we were all greatli
reliev when on of the men said he had seen her fly toward
the hous with the nurs then bear such of the wound as
could be move at the moment with us we slowli made our wai
toward the missionhous spent with toil and bloodsh but
with the gloriou sens of victori against overwhelm odd
glow in our heart we had save the life of the littl maid
and taught the masai of those part a lesson that thei will not
forget for ten year but at what a cost
painfulli we made our wai up the hill which just a littl more
than an hour befor we had descend under such differ circumst
at the gate of the wall stood mr mackenzi wait for us
when her ey fell upon us howev she shriek out and cover
her face with her hand cry horribl horribl nor were
her fear allai when she discov her worthi husband be
born upon an improv stretcher but her doubt as to the
natur of hi injuri were soon set at rest then when in a few
brief word i had told her the upshot of the struggl of which
flossi who had arriv in safeti had been abl to explain
someth she came up to me and solemnli kiss me on the forehead
god bless you all mr quatermain you have save my child
life she said simpli
then we went in and got our cloth off and doctor our wound
i am glad to sai i had none and sir henri and good were
thank to those invalu chain shirt of a compar harmless
natur and to be dealt with by mean of a few stitch and stick
plaster mackenzi howev were seriou though fortun
the spear had not sever ani larg arteri after that we had
a bath and what a luxuri it wa and have clad ourselv
in ordinari cloth proceed to the diningroom where breakfast
wa set as usual it wa curiou sit down there drink
tea and eat toast in an ordinari nineteenthcenturi sort of
wai just as though we had not emploi the earli hour in a regular
primit handtohand middleag kind of struggl as good
said the whole thing seem more as though on had had a bad
nightmar just befor be call than as a deed done when
we were finish our breakfast the door open and in came
littl flossi veri pale and totteri but quit unhurt she
kiss us all and thank us i congratul her on the presenc
of mind she had shown in shoot the masai with her derring
pistol and therebi save her own life
oh dont talk of it she said begin to cry hyster
i shall never forget hi face as he went turn round and round
never i can see it now
i advis her to go to bed and get some sleep which she did
and awok in the even quit recov so far as her strength
wa concern it struck me as an odd thing that a girl who
could find the nerv to shoot a huge black ruffian rush to
kill her with a spear should have been so affect at the thought
of it afterward but it is after all characterist of the
sex poor flossi i fear that her nerv will not get over
that night in the masai camp for mani a long year she told
me afterward that it wa the suspens that wa so aw have
to sit there hour after hour through the livelong night utterli
ignor as to whether or not ani attempt wa to be made to rescu
her she said that on the whole she did not expect it know
how few of us and how mani of the masai who by the wai
came continu to stare at her most of them never have seen
a white person befor and handl her arm and hair with their
filthi paw she said also that she had made up her mind that
if she saw no sign of succour by the time the first rai of
the rise sun reach the kraal she would kill herself with
the pistol for the nurs had heard the lygonani sai that thei
were to be tortur to death as soon as the sun wa up if on
of the white men did not come in their place it wa an aw
resolut to have to take but she meant to act on it and i
have littl doubt but what she would have done so although
she wa at an ag when in england girl ar in the schoolroom
and come down to dessert thi child of the wilder had
more courag discret and power of mind than mani a woman
of matur ag nurtur in idl and luxuri with mind carefulli
drill and educ out of ani origin or selfresourc
that natur mai have endow them with
when breakfast wa over we all turn in and had a good sleep
onli get up in time for dinner after which meal we onc
more adjourn togeth with all the avail popul
men women youth and girl to the scene of the morn
slaughter our object be to buri our own dead and get rid
of the masai by fling them into the tana river which ran
within fifti yard of the kraal on reach the spot we disturb
thousand upon thousand of vultur and a sort of brown bush
eagl which had been flock to the feast from mile and mile
awai often have i watch these great and repuls bird
and marvel at the extraordinari speed with which thei arriv
on a scene of slaughter a buck fall to your rifl and within
a minut high in the blue ether appear a speck that gradual
grow into a vultur then anoth and anoth i have heard
mani theori advanc to account for the wonder power of
percept natur ha given these bird my own found on
a good deal of observ is that the vultur gift as thei
ar with power of sight greater than those given by the most
power glass quarter out the heaven among themselv and
hang in midair at a vast height probabl from two to three
mile abov the earth keep watch each of them over an enorm
stretch of countri present on of them spi food and instantli
begin to sink toward it thereon hi next neighbour in the
airi height sail leisur through the blue gulf at a distanc
perhap of some mile follow hi exampl know that food
ha been sight down he goe and all the vultur within
sight of him follow after and so do all those in sight of them
in thi wai the vultur for twenti mile round can be summon
to the feast in a few minut
we buri our dead in solemn silenc good be select to
read the burial servic over them in the absenc of mr mackenzi
confin to bed as he wa gener allow to possess the
best voic and most impress manner it wa melancholi in
the extrem but as good said it might have been wors for
we might have had to buri ourselv i point out that thi
would have been a difficult feat but i knew what he meant
next we set to work to load an oxwagon which had been brought
round from the mission with the dead bodi of the masai have
first collect the spear shield and other arm we load
the wagon five time about fifti bodi to the load and empti
it into the tana from thi it wa evid that veri few of
the masai could have escap the crocodil must have been
well fed that night on of the last bodi we pick up wa
that of the sentri at the upper end i ask good how he manag
to kill him and he told me that he had crept up much as umslopogaa
had done and stab him with hi sword he groan a good
deal but fortun nobodi heard him as good said it wa
a horribl thing to have to do and most unpleasantli like
coldblood murder
and so with the last bodi that float awai down the current
of the tana end the incid of our attack on the masai camp
the spear and shield and other arm we took up to the mission
where thei fill an outhous on incid howev i must
not forget to mention as we were return from perform
the obsequi of our masai friend we pass the hollow tree
where alphons had secret himself in the morn it so happen
that the littl man himself wa with us assist in our unpleas
task with a far better will than he had shown where live masai
were concern inde for each bodi that he handl he found
an appropri sarcasm alphons throw masai into the tana
wa a veri differ creatur from alphons fly for dear life
from the spear of a live masai he wa quit merri and gai
he clap hi hand and warbl snatch of french song as
the grim dead warrior went splash into the run water
to carri a messag of death and defianc to their kindr a hundr
mile below in short think that he want take down a
peg i suggest hold a courtmarti on him for hi conduct
in the morn
accordingli we brought him to the tree where he had hidden and
proceed to sit in judgment on him sir henri explain to
him in the veri best french the unheardof cowardic and enorm
of hi conduct more especi in let the oil rag out
of hi mouth wherebi he nearli arous the masai camp with
teethchatt and brought about the failur of our plan
end up with a request for an explan
but if we expect to find alphons at a loss and put him to
open shame we were destin to be disappoint he bow and
scrape and smile and acknowledg that hi conduct might at
first blush appear strang but realli it wa not inasmuch as
hi teeth were not chatter from fear oh dear no oh certainli
not he marvel how the messieur could think of such a thing
but from the chill air of the morn as for the rag if
monsieur could have but tast it evil flavour be compound
inde of a mixtur of stale paraffin oil greas and gunpowd
monsieur himself would have spat it out but he did noth
of the sort he determin to keep it there till ala hi stomach
revolt and the rag wa eject in an access of involuntari
sick
and what have you to sai about get into the hollow tree
ask sir henri keep hi counten with difficulti
but monsieur the explan is easi oh most easi it wa
thu i stood there by the kraal wall and the littl grei monsieur
hit me in the stomach so that my rifl explod and the battl
began i watch whilst recov myself from monsieur cruel
blow then messieur i felt the heroic blood of my grandfath
boil up in my vein the sight made me mad i ground my teeth
fire flash from my ey i shout en avant and long
to slai befor my ey there rose a vision of my heroic grandfath
in short i wa mad i wa a warrior inde but then in my
heart i heard a small voic alphons said the voic restrain
thyself alphons give not wai to thi evil passion these
men though black ar brother and thou wouldst slai them
cruel alphons the voic wa right i knew it i wa about
to perpetr the most horribl cruelti to wound to massacr
to tear limb from limb and how restrain myself i look round
i saw the tree i perceiv the hole entomb thyself said
the voic and hold on tight thou wilt thu overcom temptat
by main forc it wa bitter just when the blood of my heroic
grandfath boil most fierc but i obei i drag my
unwil feet along i entomb myself through the hole i
watch the battl i shout curs and defianc on the foe
i note them fall with satisfact why not i had not rob
them of their live their gore wa not upon my head the blood
of my heroic
oh get along with you you littl cur broke out sir henri
with a shout of laughter and give alphons a good kick which
sent him fly off with a rueful face
in the even i had an interview with mr mackenzi who wa
suffer a good deal from hi wound which good who wa a
skil though unqualifi doctor wa treat him for he
told me that thi occurr had taught him a lesson and that
if he recov safe he meant to hand over the mission to
a younger man who wa alreadi on hi road to join him in hi
work and return to england
you see quatermain he said i made up my mind to it thi
veri morn when we were creep down those benight savag
if we live through thi and rescu flossi aliv i said to
myself i will go home to england i have had enough of savag
well i did not think that we should live through it at the
time but thank be to god and you four we have live through
it and i mean to stick to my resolut lest a wors thing
befal us anoth such time would kill my poor wife and besid
quatermain between you and me i am well off it is thirti thousand
pound i am worth todai and everi farth of it made by honest
trade and save in the bank at zanzibar for live here cost
me next to noth so though it will be hard to leav thi
place which i have made to blossom like a rose in the wilder
and harder still to leav the peopl i have taught i shall go
i congratul you on your decis answer i for two reason
the first is that you ow a duti to your wife and daughter
and more especi to the latter who should receiv some educ
and mix with girl of her own race otherwis she will grow up
wild shun her kind the other is that as sure as i am
stand here sooner or later the masai will try to aveng the
slaughter inflict on them todai two or three men ar sure
to have escap the confus who will carri the stori back to
their peopl and the result will be that a great expedit
will on dai be sent against you it might be delai for a
year but sooner or later it will come therefor if onli for
that reason i should go when onc thei have learnt that you
ar no longer here thei mai perhap leav the place alon
endnot 8
you ar quit right answer the clergyman i will turn
my back upon thi place in a month but it will be a wrench
it will be a wrench
chapter ix
into the unknown
a week had pass and we all sat at supper on night in the
mission diningroom feel veri much depress in spirit
for the reason that we were go to sai goodby to our kind
friend the mackenzi and depart upon our wai at dawn on the
morrow noth more had been seen or heard of the masai and
save for a spear or two which had been overlook and wa rust
in the grass and a few empti cartridg where we had stood outsid
the wall it would have been difficult to tell that the old cattl
kraal at the foot of the slope had been the scene of so desper
a struggl mackenzi wa thank chiefli to hi be so temper
a man rapidli recov from hi wound and could get about
on a pair of crutch and as for the other wound men on
had di of gangren and the rest were in a fair wai to recoveri
mr mackenzi caravan of men had also return from the coast
so that the station wa now ampli garrison
under these circumst we conclud warm and press as
were the invit for us to stai that it wa time to move
on first to mount kenia and thenc into the unknown in search
of the mysteri white race which we had set our heart on discov
thi time we were go to progress by mean of the humbl but
us donkei of which we had collect no less than a dozen
to carri our good and chattel and if necessari ourselv
we had now but two wakwafi left for servant and found it
quit imposs to get other nativ to ventur with us into
the unknown part we propos to explor and small blame to
them after all as mr mackenzi said it wa odd that three
men each of whom possess mani of those thing that ar suppos
to make life worth live health suffici mean and posit
etc should from their own pleasur start out upon a wildgoos
chase from which the chanc were thei never would return
but then that is what englishmen ar adventur to the backbon
and all our magnific musterrol of coloni each of which
will in time becom a great nation testifi to the extraordinari
valu of the spirit of adventur which at first sight look like
a mild form of lunaci adventur he that goe out to meet
whatev mai come well that is what we all do in the world
on wai or anoth and speak for myself i am proud of the
titl becaus it impli a brave heart and a trust in provid
besid when mani and mani a note croesu at whose feet the
peopl worship and mani and mani a timeserv and wordcoin
politician ar forgotten the name of those grandheart old
adventur who have made england what she is will be rememb
and taught with love and pride to littl children whose unshap
spirit yet slumber in the womb of centuri to be not that
we three can expect to be number with such as these yet have
we done someth enough perhap to throw a garment over
the naked of our folli
that even whilst we were sit on the veranda smoke
a pipe befor turn in who should come up to us but alphons
and with a magnific bow announc hi wish for an interview
be request to fire awai he explain at some length
that he wa anxiou to attach himself to our parti a statement
that astonish me not a littl know what a coward the littl
man wa the reason howev soon appear mr mackenzi wa
go down to the coast and thenc on to england now if he
went down countri alphons wa persuad that he would be seiz
extradit sent to franc and to penal servitud thi wa
the idea that haunt him as king charless head haunt mr
dick and he brood over it till hi imagin exagger
the danger ten time as a matter of fact the probabl is
that hi offenc against the law of hi countri had long ago
been forgotten and that he would have been allow to pass unmolest
anywher except in franc but he could not be got to see thi
constitut coward as the littl man wa he infinit prefer
to face the certain hardship and great risk and danger of
such an expedit as our than to expos himself notwithstand
hi intens long for hi nativ land to the possibl scrutini
of a polic offic which is after all onli anoth exemplif
of the truth that to the major of men a faroff foreseen
danger howev shadowi is much more terribl than the most
seriou present emerg after listen to what he had to
sai we consult among ourselv and final agre with mr
mackenzi knowledg and consent to accept hi offer to begin
with we were veri shorthand and alphons wa a quick activ
fellow who could turn hi hand to anyth and cook ah
he could cook i believ that he would have made a palat
dish of those gaiter of hi heroic grandfath which he wa
so fond of talk about then he wa a goodtemp littl
man and merri as a monkei whilst hi pompou vainglori
talk wa a sourc of infinit amus to us and what is more
he never bore malic of cours hi be so pronounc a coward
wa a great drawback to him but now that we knew hi weak
we could more or less guard against it so after warn him
of the undoubt risk he wa expos himself to we told him
that we would accept hi offer on condit that he would promis
implicit obedi to our order we also promis to give him
wage at the rate of ten pound a month should he ever return
to a civil countri to receiv them to all of thi he agre
with alacr and retir to write a letter to hi annett
which mr mackenzi promis to post when he got down countri
he read it to us afterward sir henri translat and a wonder
composit it wa i am sure the depth of hi devot and
the narrat of hi suffer in a barbar countri far
far from thee annett for whose ador sake i endur such sorrow
ought to have touch the feel of the stoniestheart chambermaid
well the morrow came and by seven oclock the donkei were
all load and the time of part wa at hand it wa a melancholi
busi especi sai goodby to dear littl flossi
she and i were great friend and often us to have talk togeth
but her nerv had never got over the shock of that aw
night when she lai in the power of those bloodthirsti masai
oh mr quatermain she cri throw her arm round my neck
and burst into tear i cant bear to sai goodby to you
i wonder when we shall meet again
i dont know my dear littl girl i said i am at on end
of life and you ar at the other i have but a short time befor
me at best and most thing lie in the past but i hope that
for you there ar mani long and happi year and everyth li
in the futur byandbi you will grow into a beauti woman
flossi and all thi wild life will be like a faroff dream
to you but i hope even if we never do meet again that you
will think of your old friend and rememb what i sai to you
now alwai try to be good my dear and to do what is right
rather than what happen to be pleasant for in the end whatev
sneer peopl mai sai what is good and what is happi ar the
same be unselfish and whenev you can give a help hand
to other for the world is full of suffer my dear and
to allevi it is the noblest end that we can set befor us
if you do that you will becom a sweet and godfear woman
and make mani peopl live a littl brighter and then you
will not have live as so mani of your sex do in vain and
now i have given you a lot of oldfashion advic and so i
am go to give you someth to sweeten it with you see thi
littl piec of paper it is what is call a chequ when
we ar gone give it to your father with thi note not befor
mind you will marri on dai my dear littl flossi and it
is to bui you a wed present which you ar to wear and your
daughter after you if you have on in remembr of hunter
quatermain
poor littl flossi cri veri much and gave me a lock of her
bright hair in return which i still have the chequ i gave
her wa for a thousand pound which be now well off and
have no call upon me except those of chariti i could well
afford and in the note i direct her father to invest it for
her in govern secur and when she marri or came of ag
to bui her the best diamond necklac he could get for the monei
and accumul interest i chose diamond becaus i think that
now that king solomon mine ar lost to the world their price
will never be much lower than it is at present so that if in
afterlif she should ever be in pecuniari difficulti she
will be abl to turn them into monei
well at last we got off after much handshak hatwav
and also farewel salut from the nativ alphons weep
copious for he ha a warm heart at part with hi master
and mistress and i wa not sorri for it at all for i hate those
goodby perhap the most affect thing of all wa to wit
umslopogaa distress at part with flossi for whom the grim
old warrior had conceiv a strong affect he us to sai
that she wa as sweet to see as the onli star on a dark night
and wa never tire of loudli congratul himself on have
kill the lygonani who had threaten to murder her and that
wa the last we saw of the pleasant missionhous a true oasi
in the desert and of european civil but i often think
of the mackenzi and wonder how thei got down countri and
if thei ar now safe and well in england and will ever see these
word dear littl flossi i wonder how she fare there where
there ar no black folk to do her imperi bid and no skypierc
snowclad kenia for her to look at when she get up in the morn
and so goodby to flossi
after leav the missionhous we made our wai compar
unmolest past the base of mount kenia which the masai call
donyo eger or the speckl mountain on account of the
black patch of rock that appear upon it mighti spire where
the side ar too precipit to allow of the snow ly on them
then on past the lone lake baringo where on of our two remain
askari have unfortun trodden on a puffadd di of
snakebit in spite of all our effort to save him thenc
we proceed a distanc of about a hundr and fifti mile to
anoth magnific snowclad mountain call lekakisera which
ha never to the best of my belief been visit befor by a
european but which i cannot now stop to describ there we
rest a fortnight and then start out into the trackless and
uninhabit forest of a vast district call elgumi in thi
forest alon there ar more eleph than i ever met with or
heard of befor the mighti mammal liter swarm there
entir unmolest by man and onli kept down by the natur
law that prevent ani anim increas beyond the capac
of the countri thei inhabit to support them needless to sai
howev we did not shoot mani of them first becaus we could
not afford to wast ammunit of which our stock wa get
peril low a donkei load with it have been swept awai
in ford a flood river and secondli becaus we could not
carri awai the ivori and did not wish to kill for the mere sake
of slaughter so we let the great beast be onli shoot on
or two in selfprotect in thi district the eleph
be unacquaint with the hunter and hi tender merci would
allow on to walk up to within twenti yard of them in the open
while thei stood with their great ear cock for all the world
like puzzl and gigant puppydog and stare at that new
and extraordinari phenomenon man occasion when the
inspect did not prove satisfactori the stare end in a
trumpet and a charg but thi did not often happen when it
did we had to us our rifl nor were eleph the onli wild
beast in the great elgumi forest all sort of larg game abound
includ lion confound them i have alwai hate the sight
of a lion sinc on bit my leg and lame me for life as a consequ
anoth thing that abound wa the dread tsets fly whose
bite is death to domest anim donkei have togeth with
men hitherto been suppos to enjoi a peculiar immun from
it attack but all i have to sai whether it wa on account
of their poor condit or becaus the tsets in those part
is more poison than usual i do not know but our succumb
to it onslaught fortun howev that wa not till two
month or so after the bite had been inflict when suddenli
after a two dai cold rain thei all di and on remov the
skin of sever of them i found the long yellow streak upon
the flesh which ar characterist of death from bite from the
tsets mark the spot where the insect had insert hi probosci
on emerg from the great elgumi forest we still steer
northward in accord with the inform mr mackenzi had
collect from the unfortun wander who reach him onli
to die so tragic struck the base in due cours of the larg
lake call laga by the nativ which is about fifti mile
long by twenti broad and of which it mai be rememb he
made mention thenc we push on nearli a month journei over
great roll upland someth like those in the transvaal
but diversifi by patch of bush countri
all thi time we were continu ascend at the rate of about
on hundr feet everi ten mile inde the countri wa on
a slope which appear to termin at a mass of snowtip
mountain for which we were steer and where we learnt the
second lake of which the wander had spoken as the lake without
a bottom wa situat at length we arriv there and have
ascertain that there wa a larg lake on top of the mountain
ascend three thousand feet more till we came to a precipit
cliff or edg to find a great sheet of water some twenti mile
squar ly fifteen hundr feet below us and evid occupi
an extinct volcan crater or crater of vast extent perceiv
villag on the border of thi lake we descend with great
difficulti through forest of pine tree which now cloth the
precipit side of the crater and were well receiv by the
peopl a simpl unwarlik folk who had never seen or even
heard of a white man befor and treat us with great rever
and kind suppli us with as much food and milk as we could
eat and drink thi wonder and beauti lake lai accord
to our aneroid at a height of no less than 11450 feet abov
sealevel and it climat wa quit cold and not at all unlik
that of england inde for the first three dai of our stai
there we saw littl or noth of the sceneri on account of an
unmistak scotch mist which prevail it wa thi rain that
set the tsets poison work in our remain donkei so that
thei all di
thi disast left us in a veri awkward posit as we had now
no mean of transport whatev though on the other hand we had
not much to carri ammunit too wa veri short amount
to but on hundr and fifti round of rifl cartridg and some
fifti shotgun cartridg how to get on we did not know inde
it seem to us that we had about reach the end of our tether
even if we had been inclin to abandon the object of our search
which shadow as it wa wa by no mean the case it wa ridicul
to think of forc our wai back some seven hundr mile to
the coast in our present plight so we came to the conclus
that the onli thing to be done wa to stop where we were the
nativ be so well dispos and food plenti for the
present and abid event and try to collect inform as
to the countri beyond
accordingli have purchas a capit log cano larg enough
to hold us all and our baggag from the headman of the villag
we were stai in present him with three empti colddrawn
brass cartridg by wai of payment with which he wa perfectli
delight we set out to make a tour of the lake in order to
find the most favour place to make a camp as we did not
know if we should return to thi villag we put all our gear
into the cano and also a quarter of cook waterbuck which
when young is delici eat and off we set nativ have
alreadi gone befor us in light cano to warn the inhabit
of the other villag of our approach
as we were puddl leisur along good remark upon the extraordinari
deep blue colour of the water and said that he understood from
the nativ who were great fishermen fish inde be
their princip food that the lake wa suppos to be wonderfulli
deep and to have a hole at the bottom through which the water
escap and put out some great fire that wa rage below
i point out to him that what he had heard wa probabl a legend
aris from a tradit among the peopl which date back to
the time when on of the extinct parasit volcan cone wa
in activ we saw sever round the border of the lake which
had no doubt been work at a period long subsequ to the
volcan death of the central crater which now form the bed
of the lake itself when it final becam extinct the peopl
would imagin that the water from the lake had run down and put
out the big fire below more especi as though it wa constantli
fed by stream run from the snowtip peak about there
wa no visibl exit to it
the farther shore of the lake we found on approach it to
consist of a vast perpendicular wall of rock which held the
water without ani intermedi slope bank as elsewher accordingli
we paddl parallel with thi precipic at a distanc of about
a hundr pace from it shape our cours for the end of the
lake where we knew that there wa a larg villag
as we went we began to pass a consider accumul of float
rush weed bough of tree and other rubbish brought good
suppos to thi spot by some current which he wa much puzzl
to account for whilst we were specul about thi sir henri
point out a flock of larg white swan which were feed
on the drift some littl wai ahead of us now i had alreadi
notic swan fly about thi lake and have never come
across them befor in africa wa exceedingli anxiou to obtain
a specimen i had question the nativ about them and learnt
that thei came from over the mountain alwai arriv at certain
period of the year in the earli morn when it wa veri easi
to catch them on account of their exhaust condit i also
ask them what countri thei came from when thei shrug their
shoulder and said that on the top of the great black precipic
wa stoni inhospit land and beyond that were mountain with
snow and full of wild beast where no peopl live and beyond
the mountain were hundr of mile of dens thorn forest so
thick that even the eleph could not get through it much
less men next i ask them if thei had ever heard of white
peopl like ourselv live on the farther side of the mountain
and the thorn forest whereat thei laugh but afterward a
veri old woman came and told me that when she wa a littl girl
her grandfath had told her that in hi youth hi grandfath
had cross the desert and the mountain and pierc the thorn
forest and seen a white peopl who live in stone kraal beyond
of cours as thi took the tale back some two hundr and fifti
year the inform wa veri indefinit but still there it
wa again and on think it over i grew firmli convinc that
there wa some truth in all these rumour and equal firmli
determin to solv the mysteri littl did i guess in what
an almost miracul wai my desir wa to be gratifi
well we set to work to stalk the swan which kept draw
as thei fed nearer and nearer to the precipic and at last
we push the cano under shelter of a patch of drift within
forti yard of them sir henri had the shotgun load with
no 1 and wait for a chanc got two in a line and fire
at their neck kill them both up rose the rest thirti or
more of them with a mighti splash and as thei did so he
gave them the other barrel down came on fellow with a broken
wing and i saw the leg of anoth drop and a few feather start
out of hi back but he went on quit strong up went the swan
circl ever higher till at last thei were mere speck level
with the top of the frown precipic when i saw them form
into a triangl and head off for the unknown northeast meanwhil
we had pick up our two dead on and beauti bird thei
were weigh not less than about thirti pound each and were
chase the wing on which had scrambl over a mass of driftwe
into a pool of clear water beyond find a difficulti in forc
the cano through the rubbish i told our onli remain wakwafi
servant whom i knew to be an excel swimmer to jump over
dive under the drift and catch him know that as there were
no crocodil in thi lake he could come to no harm enter
into the fun of the thing the man obei and soon wa dodg
about after the wing swan in fine style get gradual
nearer to the rock wall against which the water wash as he
did so
present he gave up swim after the swan and began to cry
out that he wa be carri awai and inde we saw that
though he wa swim with all hi strength toward us he wa
be drawn slowli to the precipic with a few desper stroke
of our paddl we push the cano through the crust of drift
and row toward the man as hard as we could but fast as we
went he wa drawn faster to the rock suddenli i saw that befor
us just rise eighteen inch or so abov the surfac of the
lake wa what look like the top of the arch of a submerg
cave or railwai tunnel evid from the watermark on the
rock sever feet abov it it wa gener entir submerg
but there had been a dry season and the cold had prevent the
snow from melt as freeli as usual so the lake wa low and
the arch show toward thi arch our poor servant wa be
suck with fright rapid he wa not more than ten fathom
from it and we were about twenti when i saw it and with littl
help from us the cano flew along after him he struggl brave
and i thought that we should have save him when suddenli i
perceiv an express of despair come upon hi face and there
befor our ey he wa suck down into the cruel swirl blue
depth and vanish at the same moment i felt our cano seiz
as with a mighti hand and propel with resistless forc toward
the rock
we realiz our danger now and row or rather paddl furious
in our attempt to get out of the vortex in vain in anoth
second we were fly straight for the arch like an arrow and
i thought that we were lost luckili i retain suffici presenc
of mind to shout out instantli set the exampl by throw
myself into the bottom of the cano down on your face down
and the other had the sens to take the hint in anoth instant
there wa a grind nois and the boat wa push down till
the water began to trickl over the side and i thought that
we were gone but no suddenli the grind ceas and we could
again feel the cano fly along i turn my head a littl
i dare not lift it and look up by the feebl light
that yet reach the cano i could make out that a dens arch
of rock hung just over our head and that wa all in anoth
minut i could not even see as much as that for the faint light
had merg into shadow and the shadow had been swallow up
in dark utter and complet
for an hour or so we lai there not dare to lift our head
for fear lest the brain should be dash out of them and scarc
abl to speak even on account of the nois of the rush water
which drown our voic not inde that we had much inclin
to speak see that we were overwhelm by the aw of
our posit and the immin fear of instant death either by
be dash against the side of the cavern or on a rock or
be suck down in the rage water or perhap asphyxi
by want of air all of these and mani other mode of death present
themselv to my imagin as i lai at the bottom of the cano
listen to the swirl of the hurri water which ran whither
we knew not on onli other sound could i hear and that wa
alphons intermitt howl of terror come from the centr
of the cano and even that seem faint and unnatur inde
the whole thing overpow my brain and i began to believ
that i wa the victim of some ghastli spiritshak nightmar
chapter x
the rose of fire
on we flew drawn by the mighti current till at last i notic
that the sound of the water wa not half so deafen as it had
been and conclud that thi must be becaus there wa more
room for the echo to dispers in i could now hear alphons
howl much more distinctli thei were made up of the oddest mixtur
of invoc to the suprem power and the name of hi belov
annett that it is possibl to conceiv and in short though
their evid earnest save them from profan were to
sai the least veri remark take up a paddl i manag
to drive it into hi rib whereon he think that the end
had come howl louder than ever then i slowli and cautious
rais myself on my knee and stretch my hand upward but
could touch no roof next i took the paddl and lift it abov
my head as high as i could but with the same result i also
thrust it out later to the right and left but could touch
noth except water then i bethought me that there wa in
the boat amongst our other remain possess a bullsey
lantern and a tin of oil i grope about and found it and have
a match on me carefulli lit it and as soon as the flame had
got a hold of the wick i turn it on down the boat as it happen
the first thing the light lit on wa the white and scare face
of alphons who think that it wa all over at last and
that he wa wit a preliminari celesti phenomenon gave
a terrif yell and wa with difficulti reassur with the paddl
as for the other three good wa ly on the flat of hi back
hi eyeglass still fix in hi ey and gaze blankli into
the upper dark sir henri had hi head rest on the thwart
of the cano and with hi hand wa try to test the speed
of the water but when the beam of light fell upon old umslopogaa
i could realli have laugh i think i have said that we had
put a roast quarter of waterbuck into the cano well it so
happen that when we all prostrat ourselv to avoid be
swept out of the boat and into the water by the rock roof umslopogaass
head had come down uncommonli near thi roast buck and so soon
as he had recov a littl from the first shock of our posit
it occur to him that he wa hungri thereupon he coolli cut
off a chop with inkosikaa and wa now emploi in eat it
with everi appear of satisfact as he afterward explain
he thought that he wa go on a long journei and prefer
to start on a full stomach it remind me of the peopl who
ar go to be hang and who ar gener report in the
english daili paper to have made an excel breakfast
as soon as the other saw that i had manag to light the lamp
we bundl alphons into the farther end of the cano with a
threat which calm him down wonderfulli that if he would insist
upon make the dark hideou with hi cri we would put
him out of suspens by send him to join the wakwafi and wait
for annett in anoth sphere and began to discuss the situat
as well as we could first howev at good suggest we
bound two paddl mastfashion in the bow so that thei might
give us warn against ani sudden lower of the roof of the
cave or waterwai it wa clear to us that we were in an underground
river or as alphons defin it main drain which carri
off the superflu water of the lake such river ar well
known to exist in mani part of the world but it ha not often
been the evil fortun of explor to travel by them that the
river wa wide we could clearli see for the light from the bullsey
lantern fail to reach from shore to shore although occasion
when the current swept us either to on side or the other we
could distinguish the rock wall of the tunnel which as far
as we could make out appear to arch about twentyf feet
abov our head as for the current itself it ran good estim
at least eight knot and fortun for us wa as is usual
fiercest in the middl of the stream still our first act wa
to arrang that on of us with the lantern and a pole there
wa in the cano should alwai be in the bow readi if possibl
to prevent us from be stove in against the side of the cave
or ani project rock umslopogaa have alreadi dine took
the first turn thi wa absolut with on except all
that we could do toward preserv our safeti the except
wa that anoth of us took up a posit in the stern with a
paddl by mean of which it wa possibl to steer the cano more
or less and to keep her from the side of the cave these matter
attend to we made a somewhat spare meal off the cold buck
meat for we did not know how long it might have to last us
and then feel in rather better spirit i gave my opinion that
seriou as it undoubtedli wa i did not consid our posit
altogeth without hope unless inde the nativ were right
and the river plung straight down into the bowel of the earth
if not it wa clear that it must emerg somewher probabl
on the other side of the mountain and in that case all we had
to think of wa to keep ourselv aliv till we got there wherev
there might be but of cours as good lugubri point
out on the other hand we might fall victim to a hundr unsuspect
horror or the river might go on wind awai insid the earth
till it dri up in which case our fate would inde be an
aw on
well let us hope for the best and prepar ourselv for the
worst said sir henri who is alwai cheer and even spirit
a veri tower of strength in the time of troubl we have
come out of so mani queer scrape togeth that somehow i almost
fanci we shall come out of thi he ad
thi wa excel advic and we proceed to take it each in
our separ wai that is except alphons who had by now
sunk into a sort of terrifi stupor good wa at the helm and
umslopogaa in the bow so there wa noth left for sir henri
and myself to do except to lie down in the cano and think
it certainli wa a curiou and inde almost a weird posit
to be place in rush along as we were through the bowel
of the earth born on the bosom of a stygian river someth
after the fashion of soul be ferri by charon as curti
said and how dark it wa the feebl rai from our littl lamp
did but serv to show the dark there in the bow sat old
umslopogaa like pleasur in the poem endnot 9 watch
and untir the pole readi to hi hand and behind in the shadow
i could just make out the form of good peer forward at the
rai of light in order to make out how to steer with the paddl
that he held and now and again dip into the water
well well thought i you have come in search of adventur
allan my boi and you have certainli got them at your time
of life too you ought to be asham of yourself but somehow
you ar not and aw as it all is perhap you will pull through
after all and if you dont why you cannot help it you see
and when all said and done an underground river will make
a veri appropri buryingplac
at first howev i am bound to sai that the strain upon the
nerv wa veri great it is try to the coolest and most
experienc person not to know from on hour to anoth if he
ha five minut more to live but there is noth in thi world
that on cannot get accustom to and in time we began to get
accustom even to that and after all our anxieti though
no doubt natur wa strictli speak illog see that
we never know what is go to happen to us the next minut
even when we sit in a welldrain hous with two policemen patrol
under the window nor how long we have to live it is all arrang
for us my son so what is the us of bother
it wa nearli middai when we made our dive into dark and
we had set our watch good and umslopogaa at two have agre
that it should be of a durat of five hour at seven oclock
accordingli sir henri and i went on sir henri at the bow and
i at the stern and the other two lai down and went to sleep
for three hour all went well sir henri onli find it necessari
onc to push us off from the side and i that but littl steer
wa requir to keep us straight as the violent current did
all that wa need though occasion the cano show a tendenc
which had to be guard against to veer and travel broadsid
on what struck me as the most curiou thing about thi wonder
river wa how did the air keep fresh it wa muggi and thick
no doubt but still not suffici so to render it bad or even
remark unpleas the onli explan that i can suggest
is that the water of the lake had suffici air in it to keep
the atmospher of the tunnel from absolut stagnat thi air
be given out as it proceed on it headlong wai of cours
i onli give the solut of the mysteri for what it is worth
which perhap is not much
when i had been for three hour or so at the helm i began to
notic a decid chang in the temperatur which wa get
warmer at first i took no notic of it but when at the expir
of anoth halfhour i found that it wa get hotter and
hotter i call to sir henri and ask him if he notic it
or if it wa onli my imagin notic it he answer
i should think so i am in a sort of turkish bath just about
then the other woke up gasp and were oblig to begin to
discard their cloth here umslopogaa had the advantag for
he did not wear ani to speak of except a moocha
hotter it grew and hotter yet till at last we could scarc
breath and the perspir pour out of us half an hour
more and though we were all now stark nake we could hardli
bear it the place wa like an antechamb of the infern region
proper i dip my hand into the water and drew it out almost
with a cry it wa nearli boil we consult a littl thermomet
we had the mercuri stood at 123 degre from the surfac
of the water rose a dens cloud of steam alphons groan out
that we were alreadi in purgatori which inde we were though
not in the sens that he meant it sir henri suggest that
we must be pass near the seat of some underground volcan
fire and i am inclin to think especi in the light of
what subsequ occur that he wa right our suffer
for some time after thi realli pass my power of descript
we no longer perspir for all the perspir had been sweat
out of us we simpli lai in the bottom of the boat which we
were now physic incap of direct feel like hot
ember and i fanci undergo veri much the same sensat
that the poor fish do when thei ar dy on land name
that of slow suffoc our skin began to crack and the
blood to throb in our head like the beat of a steamengin
thi had been go on for some time when suddenli the river
turn a littl and i heard sir henri call out from the bow
in a hoars startl voic and look up saw a most wonder
and aw thing about half a mile ahead of us and a littl
to the left of the centr of the stream which we could now
see wa about nineti feet broad a huge pillarlik jet of
almost white flame rose from the surfac of the water and sprang
fifti feet into the air when it struck the roof and spread out
some forti feet in diamet fall back in curv sheet of
fire shape like the petal of a fullblown rose inde thi
aw ga jet resembl noth so much as a great flame flower
rise out of the black water below wa the straight stalk
a foot or more thick and abov the dread bloom and as for
the fear of it and it fierc and awesom beauti who
can describ it certainli i cannot although we were now some
five hundr yard awai it notwithstand the steam lit up
the whole cavern as clear as dai and we could see that the roof
wa here about forti feet abov us and wash perfectli smooth
with water the rock wa black and here and there i could make
out long shine line of or run through it like great vein
but of what metal thei were i know not
on we rush toward thi pillar of fire which gleam fiercer
than ani furnac ever lit by man
keep the boat to the right quatermain to the right shout
sir henri and a minut afterward i saw him fall forward senseless
alphons had alreadi gone good wa the next to go there
thei lai as though dead onli umslopogaa and i kept our sens
we were within fifti yard of it now and i saw the zulu head
fall forward on hi hand he had gone too and i wa alon
i could not breath the fierc heat dri me up for yard
and yard round the great rose of fire the rockroof wa redhot
the wood of the boat wa almost burn i saw the feather
on on of the dead swan begin to twist and shrivel up but i
would not give in i knew that if i did we should pass within
three or four yard of the ga jet and perish miser i set
the paddl so as to turn the cano as far from it as possibl
and held on grimli
my ey seem to be burst from my head and through my close
lid i could see the fierc light we were nearli opposit now
it roar like all the fire of hell and the water boil furious
around it five second more we were past i heard the roar
behind me
then i too fell senseless the next thing that i recollect is
feel a breath of air upon my face my ey open with great
difficulti i look up far far abov me there wa light
though around me wa great gloom then i rememb and look
the cano still float down the river and in the bottom of
it lai the nake form of my companion were thei dead i
wonder wa i left alon in thi aw place i knew not
next i becam consciou of a burn thirst i put my hand
over the edg of the boat into the water and drew it up again
with a cry no wonder nearli all the skin wa burnt off the
back of it the water howev wa cold or nearli so and
i drank pint and splash myself all over my bodi seem to
suck up the fluid as on mai see a brick wall suck up rain after
a drought but where i wa burnt the touch of it caus intens
pain then i bethought myself of the other and drag myself
toward them with difficulti i sprinkl them with water and
to my joi thei began to recov umslopogaa first then the
other next thei drank absorb water like so mani spong
then feel chilli a queer contrast to our recent sensat
we began as best we could to get into our cloth as we
did so good point to the port side of the cano it wa all
blister with heat and in place actual char had it
been built like our civil boat good said that the plank
would certainli have warp and let in enough water to sink us
but fortun it wa dug out of the soft willowi wood of a
singl great tree and had side nearli three inch and a bottom
four inch thick what that aw flame wa we never discov
but i suppos that there wa at thi spot a crack or hole in
the bed of the river through which a vast volum of ga forc
it wai from it volcan home in the bowel of the earth toward
the upper air how it first becam ignit is of cours imposs
to sai probabl i should think from some spontan explos
of mephit gase
as soon as we had got some thing togeth and shaken ourselv
togeth a littl we set to work to make out where we were now
i have said that there wa light abov and on examin we
found that it came from the sky our river that wa sir henri
said a liter realiz of the wild vision of the poet
endnot 10 wa no longer underground but wa run on it
darksom wai not now through cavern measureless to man but
between two fright cliff which cannot have been less than
two thousand feet high so high were thei inde that though
the sky wa abov us where we were wa dens gloom not dark
inde but the gloom of a room close shutter in the daytim
up on either side rose the great straight cliff grim and forbid
till the ey grew dizzi with try to measur their sheer height
the littl space of sky that mark where thei end lai like
a thread of blue upon their soar black which wa unreliev
by ani tree or creeper here and there howev grew ghostli
patch of a long grei lichen hang motionless to the rock
as the white beard to the chin of a dead man it seem as though
onli the dreg or heavier part of the light had sunk to the bottom
of thi aw place no brightwing sunbeam could fall so low
thei di far far abov our head
by the river edg wa a littl shore form of round fragment
of rock wash into thi shape by the constant action of water
and give the place the appear of be strewn with thousand
of fossil cannon ball evid when the water of the underground
river is high there is no beach at all or veri littl between
the border of the stream and the precipit cliff but now
there wa a space of seven or eight yard and here on thi
beach we determin to land in order to rest ourselv a littl
after all that we had gone through and to stretch our limb
it wa a dread place but it would give an hour respit
from the terror of the river and also allow of our repack
and arrang the cano accordingli we select what look
like a favour spot and with some littl difficulti manag
to beach the cano and scrambl out on to the round inhospit
pebbl
my word call out good who wa on shore the first what
an aw place it enough to give on a fit and he laugh
instantli a thunder voic took up hi word magnifi them
a hundr time give on a fit ho ho ho a fit
ho ho ho answer anoth voic in wild accent from far
up the cliff a fit a fit a fit chime in voic after voic
each fling the word to and fro with shout of aw laughter
to the invis lip of the other till the whole place echo
with the word and with shriek of fiendish merriment which
at last ceas as suddenli as thei had begun
oh mon dieu yell alphons startl quit out of such
selfcommand as he possess
mon dieu mon dieu mon dieu the titan echo thunder
shriek and wail in everi conceiv tone
ah said umslopogaa calmli i clearli perceiv that devil
live here well the place look like it
i tri to explain to him that the caus of all the hubbub wa
a veri remark and interest echo but he would not believ it
ah he said i know an echo when i hear on there wa on live
opposit my kraal in zululand and the intombi maiden us
to talk with it but if what we hear is a fullgrown echo mine
at home can onli have been a babi no no thei ar devil
up there but i dont think much of them though he ad
take a pinch of snuff thei can copi what on sai but thei
dont seem to be abl to talk on their own account and thei
dare not show their face and he relaps into silenc and
appar paid no further attent to such contempt fiend
after thi we found it necessari to keep our convers down
to a whisper for it wa realli unbear to have everi word
on utter toss to and fro like a tennisbal as precipic
call to precipic
but even our whisper ran up the rock in mysteri murmur
till at last thei di awai in longdrawn sigh of sound echo
ar delight and romant thing but we had more than enough
of them in that dread gulf
as soon as we had settl ourselv a littl on the round stone
we went on to wash and dress our burn as well as we could
as we had but a littl oil for the lantern we could not spare
ani for thi purpos so we skin on of the swan and us
the fat off it breast which prove an excel substitut
then we repack the cano and final began to take some food
of which i need scarc sai we were in need for our insens
had endur for mani hour and it wa as our watch show
middai accordingli we seat ourselv in a circl and were
soon engag in discuss our cold meat with such appetit as
we could muster which in my case at ani rate wa not much
as i felt sick and faint after my suffer of the previou
night and had besid a rack headach it wa a curiou
meal the gloom wa so intens that we could scarc see the
wai to cut our food and convei it to our mouth still we got
on pretti well till i happen to look behind me my attent
be attract by a nois of someth crawl over the stone
and perceiv sit upon a rock in my immedi rear a huge
speci of black freshwat crab onli it wa five time the
size of ani crab i ever saw thi hideou and loathsomelook
anim had project ey that seem to glare at on veri
long and flexibl antenna or feeler and gigant claw
nor wa i especi favour with it compani from everi quarter
dozen of these horrid brute were creep up drawn i suppos
by the smell of the food from between the round stone and out
of hole in the precipic some were alreadi quit close to
us i stare quit fascin by the unusu sight and as i
did so i saw on of the beast stretch out it huge claw and
give the unsuspect good such a nip behind that he jump up
with a howl and set the wild echo fly in sober earnest
just then too anoth a veri larg on got hold of alphons
leg and declin to part with it and as mai be imagin a
consider scene ensu umslopogaa took hi ax and crack
the shell of on with the flat of it whereon it set up a horrid
scream which the echo multipli a thousandfold and began
to foam at the mouth a proceed that drew hundr more of
it friend out of unsuspect hole and corner those on the
spot perceiv that the anim wa hurt fell upon it like creditor
on a bankrupt and liter rent it limb from limb with their
huge pincer and devour it us their claw to convei the
fragment to their mouth seiz whatev weapon were handi
such as stone or paddl we commenc a war upon the monster
whose number were increas by leap and bound and whose
stench wa overpow so fast as we crack their armour
other seiz the injur on and devour them foam at
the mouth and scream as thei did so nor did the brute
stop at that when thei could thei nip hold of us and
aw nip thei were or tri to steal the meat on enorm
fellow got hold of the swan we had skin and began to drag
it off instantli a score of other flung themselv upon the
prei and then began a ghastli and disgust scene how the
monster foam and scream and rent the flesh and each other
it wa a sicken and unnatur sight and on that will haunt
all who saw it till their dy dai enact as it wa in the
deep oppress gloom and set to the unceas music of the
manyton nerveshak echo strang as it mai seem to sai
so there wa someth so shockingli human about these fiendish
creatur it wa as though all the most evil passion and
desir of man had got into the shell of a magnifi crab and
gone mad thei were so dreadfulli courag and intellig
and thei look as if thei understood the whole scene might
have furnish materi for anoth canto of dant inferno
as curti said
i sai you fellow let get out of thi or we shall all go
off our head sung out good and we were not slow to take the
hint push the cano around which the anim were now crawl
by hundr and make vain attempt to climb off the rock
we bundl into it and got out into midstream leav behind
us the fragment of our meal and the scream foam stink
mass of monster in full possess of the ground
those ar the devil of the place said umslopogaa with the
air of on who ha solv a problem and upon my word i felt
almost inclin to agre with him
umslopogaa remark were like hi ax veri much to the point
what to be done next said sir henri blankli
drift i suppos i answer and we drift accordingli
all the afternoon and well into the even we float on in
the gloom beneath the faroff line of blue sky scarc know
when dai end and night began for down in that vast gulf the
differ wa not mark till at length good point out a
star hang right abov us which have noth better to
do we observ with great interest suddenli it vanish the
dark becam intens and a familiar murmur sound fill
the air underground again i said with a groan hold up
the lamp ye there wa no doubt about it i could just make
out the roof the chasm had come to an end and the tunnel had
recommenc and then there began anoth long long night of
danger and horror to describ all it incid would be too
wearisom so i will simpli sai that about midnight we struck
on a flat project rock in midstream and were as nearli as
possibl overturn and drown howev at last we got off
and went upon the uneven tenor of our wai and so the hour
pass till it wa nearli three oclock sir henri good and
alphons were asleep utterli worn out umslopogaa wa at the
bow with the pole and i wa steer when i perceiv that
the rate at which we were travel had percept increas
then suddenli i heard umslopogaa make an exclam and
next second came a sound as of part branch and i becam
awar that the cano wa be forc through hang bush
or creeper anoth minut and the breath of sweet open air
fan my face and i felt that we had emerg from the tunnel
and were float upon clear water i sai felt for i could
see noth the dark be absolut pitchi as it often
is just befor the dawn but even thi could scarc damp my
joi we were out of that dread river and wherev we might
have got to thi at least wa someth to be thank for
and so i sat down and inhal the sweet night air and wait
for the dawn with such patienc as i could command
chapter xi
the frown citi
for an hour or more i sat wait umslopogaa have meanwhil
gone to sleep also till at length the east turn grei and
huge misti shape move over the surfac of the water like ghost
of longforgotten dawn thei were the vapour rise from their
wateri bed to greet the sun then the grei turn to primros
and the primros grew to red next gloriou bar of light sprang
up across the eastern sky and through them the radiant messeng
of the dawn came speed upon their arrowi wai scatter the
ghostli vapour and awak the mountain with a kiss as thei
flew from rang to rang and longitud to longitud anoth
moment and the golden gate were open and the sun himself came
forth as a bridegroom from hi chamber with pomp and glori and
a flash as of ten million spear and embrac the night and
cover her with bright and it wa dai
but as yet i could see noth save the beauti blue sky abov
for over the water wa a thick layer of mist exactli as though
the whole surfac had been cover with billow of cotton wool
by degre howev the sun suck up the mist and then i
saw that we were afloat upon a gloriou sheet of blue water of
which i could not make out the shore some eight or ten mile
behind us howev there stretch as far as the ey could reach
a rang of precipit hill that form a retain wall of
the lake and i have no doubt but that it wa through some entranc
in these hill that the subterranean river found it wai into
the open water inde i afterward ascertain thi to be
the fact and it will be some indic of the extraordinari
strength and direct of the current of the mysteri river
that the cano even at thi distanc wa still answer to
it present too i or rather umslopogaa who woke up just
then discov anoth indic and a veri unpleas on
it wa perceiv some whitish object upon the water umslopogaa
call my attent to it and with a few stroke of the paddl
brought the cano to the spot whereupon we discov that the
object wa the bodi of a man float face downward thi wa
bad enough but imagin my horror when umslopogaa have turn
him on to hi back with the paddl we recogn in the sunken
featur the lineament of whom do you suppos none other
than our poor servant who had been suck down two dai befor
in the water of the subterranean river it quit frighten
me i thought that we had left him behind for ever and behold
born by the current he had made the aw journei with us
and with us had reach the end hi appear also wa dread
for he bore trace of have touch the pillar of fire on
arm be complet shrivel up and all hi hair be burnt
off the featur were as i have said sunken and yet thei
preserv upon them that aw look of despair that i had seen
upon hi live face as the poor fellow wa suck down realli
the sight unnerv me weari and shaken as i felt with all that
we had gone through and i wa heartili glad when suddenli and
without ani warn the bodi began to sink just as though it
had had a mission which have been accomplish it retir
the real reason no doubt be that turn it on it back allow
a free passag to the ga down it went to the transpar depth
fathom after fathom we could trace it cours till at last
a long line of bright airbubbl swiftli chase each other
to the surfac alon remain where it had pass at length
these too were gone and that wa an end of our poor servant
umslopogaa thoughtfulli watch the bodi vanish
what did he follow us for he ask ti an ill omen for
thee and me macumazahn and he laugh
i turn on him angrili for i dislik these unpleas suggest
if peopl have such idea thei ought in common decenc to keep
them to themselv i detest individu who make on the subject
of their disagre presenti or who when thei dream
that thei saw on hang as a common felon or some such horror
will insist upon tell on all about it at breakfast even
if thei have to get up earli to do it
just then howev the other woke up and began to rejoic exceedingli
at find that we were out of that dread river and onc more
beneath the blue sky then follow a babel of talk and suggest
as to what we were to do next the upshot of all of which wa
that as we were excess hungri and had noth whatsoev
left to eat except a few scrap of biltong dri gameflesh
have abandon all that remain of our provis to those
horribl freshwat crab we determin to make for the shore
but a new difficulti aros we did not know where the shore
wa and with the except of the cliff through which the
subterranean river made it entri could see noth but a wide
expans of sparkl blue water observ howev that the
long flight of aquat bird kept fly from our left we conclud
that thei were advanc from their feedingground on shore
to pass the dai in the lake and accordingli head the boat
toward the quarter whenc thei came and began to paddl befor
long howev a stiffish breez sprang up blow directli
in the direct we want so we improv a sail with a blanket
and the pole which took us along merrili thi done we devour
the remnant of our biltong wash down with the sweet lake
water and then lit our pipe and await whatev might turn up
when we had been sail for an hour good who wa search
the horizon with the spyglass suddenli announc joyfulli that
he saw land and point out that from the chang in the colour
of the water he thought we must be approach the mouth of
a river in anoth minut we perceiv a great golden dome
not unlik that of st paul pierc the morn mist and
while we were wonder what in the world it could be good report
anoth and still more import discoveri name that a small
sailingboat wa advanc toward us thi bit of new which
we were veri shortli abl to verifi with our own ey threw
us into a consider flutter that the nativ of thi unknown
lake should understand the art of sail seem to suggest that
thei possess some degre of civil in a few more minut
it becam evid that the occup or occup of the advanc
boat had made us out for a moment or two she hung in the wind
as though in doubt and then came tack toward us with great
swift in ten more minut she wa within a hundr yard
and we saw that she wa a neat littl boat not a cano dug
out but built more or less in the european fashion with plank
and carri a singularli larg sail for her size but our attent
wa soon divert from the boat to her crew which consist
of a man and a woman nearli as white as ourselv
we stare at each other in amaz think that we must be
mistaken but no there wa no doubt about it thei were not
fair but the two peopl in the boat were decidedli of a white
as distinguish from a black race as white for instanc as
spaniard or italian it wa a patent fact so it wa true
after all and mysteri led by a power beyond our own we
had discov thi wonder peopl i could have shout for
joi when i thought of the glori and the wonder of the thing
and as it wa we all shook hand and congratul each other
on the unexpect success of our wild search all my life had
i heard rumour of a white race that exist in the highland
of thi vast contin and long to put them to the proof
and now here i saw it with my own ey and wa dumbfound
truli as sir henri said the old roman wa right when he wrote
ex africa semper aliquid novi which he tell me mean that
out of africa there alwai come some new thing
the man in the boat wa of a good but not particularli fine physiqu
and possess straight black hair regular aquilin featur
and an intellig face he wa dress in a brown cloth garment
someth like a flannel shirt without the sleev and in an
unmistak kilt of the same materi the leg and feet were
bare round the right arm and left leg he wore thick ring of
yellow metal that i judg to be gold the woman had a sweet
face wild and shy with larg ey and curl brown hair
her dress wa made of the same materi as the man and consist
as we afterward discov first of a linen undergar that
hung down to her knee and then of a singl long strip of cloth
about four feet wide by fifteen long which wa wound round the
bodi in grace fold and final flung over the left shoulder
so that the end which wa dy blue or purpl or some other
colour accord to the social stand of the wearer hung
down in front the right arm and breast be howev left
quit bare a more becom dress especi when as in the
present case the wearer wa young and pretti it is quit imposs
to conceiv good who ha an ey for such thing wa greatli
struck with it and so inde wa i it wa so simpl and yet
so effect
meanwhil if we had been astonish at the appear of the
man and woman it wa clear that thei were far more astonish
at us as for the man he appear to be overcom with fear
and wonder and for a while hover round our cano but would
not approach at last howev he came within hail distanc
and call to us in a languag that sound soft and pleas
enough but of which we could not understand on word so we
hail back in english french latin greek german zulu dutch
sisutu kukuana and a few other nativ dialect that i am acquaint
with but our visitor did not understand ani of these tongu
inde thei appear to bewild him as for the ladi she wa
busili emploi in take stock of us and good wa return
the compliment by stare at her hard through hi eyeglass
a proceed that she seem rather to enjoi than otherwis
at length the man be unabl to make anyth of us suddenli
turn hi boat round and began to head off for the shore
hi littl boat skim awai befor the wind like a swallow
as she pass across our bow the man turn to attend to the
larg sail and good promptli took the opportun to kiss hi hand
to the young ladi i wa horrifi at thi proceed both on
gener ground and becaus i fear that she might take offenc
but to my delight she did not for first glanc round and
see that her husband or brother or whoever he wa wa engag
she promptli kiss her back
ah said i it seem that we have at last found a languag
that the peopl of thi countri understand
in which case said sir henri good will prove an invalu
interpret
i frown for i do not approv of good frivol and he
know it and i turn the convers to more seriou subject
it is veri clear to me i said that the man will be back
befor long with a host of hi fellow so we had best make up
our mind as to how we ar go to receiv them
the question is how will thei receiv us said sir henri
as for good he made no remark but began to extract a small squar
tin case that had accompani us in all our wander from under
a pile of baggag now we had often remonstr with good about
thi tin case inasmuch as it had been an awkward thing to carri
and he had never given ani veri explicit account as to it content
but he had insist on keep it sai mysteri that it
might come in veri us on dai
what on earth ar you go to do good ask sir henri
do why dress of cours you dont expect me to appear in
a new countri in these thing do you and he point to hi
soil and worn garment which were howev like all good
thing veri tidi and with everi tear neatli mend
we said no more but watch hi proceed with breathless
interest hi first step wa to get alphons who wa thoroughli
compet in such matter to trim hi hair and beard in the
most approv fashion i think that if he had had some hot water
and a cake of soap at hand he would have shave off the latter
but he had not thi done he suggest that we should lower
the sail of the cano and all take a bath which we did greatli
to the horror and astonish of alphons who lift hi hand
and ejacul that these english were inde a wonder peopl
umslopogaa who though he wa like most highbr zulu
scrupul cleanli in hi person did not see the fun of swim
about in a lake also regard the proceed with mild amus
we got back into the cano much refresh by the cold water
and sat to dry in the sun whilst good undid hi tin box and
produc first a beauti clean white shirt just as it had
left a london steam laundri and then some garment wrap first
in brown then in white and final in silver paper we watch
thi undo with the tenderest interest and much specul
on by on good remov the dull husk that hid their splendour
carefulli fold and replac each piec of paper as he did
so and there at last lai in all the majesti of it golden epaulett
lace and button a command of the royal navi fulldress
uniform dress sword cock hat shini patent leather boot
and all we liter gasp
what we said what ar you go to put those thing on
certainli he answer composedli you see so much depend
upon a first impress especi he ad as i observ
that there ar ladi about on at least of us ought to be
decent dress
we said no more we were simpli dumbfound especi when
we consid the art wai in which good had conceal the
content of that box for all these month onli on suggest
did we make name that he should wear hi mail shirt next
hi skin he repli that he fear it would spoil the set of
hi coat now carefulli spread in the sun to take the creas
out but final consent to thi precautionari measur the
most amus part of the affair howev wa to see old umslopogaass
astonish and alphons delight at good transform
when at last he stood up in all hi glori even down to the
medal on hi breast and contempl himself in the still water
of the lake after the fashion of the young gentleman in ancient
histori whose name i cannot rememb but who fell in love with
hi own shadow the old zulu could no longer restrain hi feel
oh bougwan he said oh bougwan i alwai thought thee
an ugli littl man and fat fat as the cow at calv time
and now thou art like a blue jai when he spread hi tail out
sure bougwan it hurt my ey to look at thee
good did not much like thi allus to hi fat which to tell
the truth wa not veri well deserv for hard exercis had
brought him down three inch but on the whole he wa pleas
at umslopogaass admir as for alphons he wa quit delight
ah but monsieur ha the beauti air the air of the warrior
it is the ladi who will sai so when we come to get ashor
monsieur is complet he put me in mind of my heroic grand
here we stop alphons
as we gaze upon the beauti thu reveal by good a spirit
of emul fill our breast and we set to work to get ourselv
up as well as we could the most howev that we were abl
to do wa to arrai ourselv in our spare suit of shoot cloth
of which we each had sever all the fine cloth in the world
could never make it otherwis than scrubbi and insignific
but sir henri look what he is a magnific man in hi nearli
new tweed suit gaiter and boot alphons also got himself
up to kill give an extra turn to hi enorm moustach
even old umslopogaa who wa not in a gener wai given to
the vain adorn of hi bodi took some oil out of the lantern
and a bit of tow and polish up hi headr with it till
it shone like good patent leather boot then he put on the
mail shirt sir henri had given him and hi moocha and have
clean up inkosikaa a littl stood forth complet
all thi while have hoist the sail again as soon as we had
finish bath we had been progress steadili for the land
or rather for the mouth of a great river present in
all about an hour and a half after the littl boat had left us
we saw emerg from the river or harbour a larg number of
boat rang up to ten or twelv ton burden on of these
wa propel by twentyfour oar and most of the rest sail
look through the glass we soon made out that the rowboat
wa an offici vessel her crew be all dress in a sort
of uniform whilst on the halfdeck forward stood an old man
of vener appear and with a flow white beard and
a sword strap to hi side who wa evid the command
of the craft the other boat were appar occupi by peopl
brought out by curios and were row or sail toward
us as quickli as thei could
now for it said i what is the bet ar thei go
to be friendli or to put an end to us
nobodi could answer thi question and not like the warlik
appear of the old gentleman and hi sword we felt a
littl anxiou
just then good spi a school of hippopotami on the water about
two hundr yard off us and suggest that it would not be
a bad plan to impress the nativ with a sens of our power by
shoot some of them if possibl thi unluckili enough struck
us as a good idea and accordingli we at onc got out our eightbor
rifl for which we still had a few cartridg left and prepar
for action there were four of the anim a big bull a cow
and two young on on three part grown we got up to them
without difficulti the great anim content themselv with
sink down into the water and rise again a few yard farther
on inde their excess tame struck me as be peculiar
when the advanc boat were about five hundr yard awai
sir henri open the ball by fire at the three part grown
young on the heavi bullet struck it fair between the ey
and crash through the skull kill it and it sank leav
a long train of blood behind it at the same moment i fire
at the cow and good at the old bull my shot took effect but
not fatal and down went the hippopotamu with a prodigi
splash onli to rise again present blow and grunt
furious dye all the water round her crimson when i kill
her with the left barrel good who is an execr shot miss
the head of the bull altogeth the bullet mere cut the
side of hi face as it pass on glanc up after i had fire
my second shot i perceiv that the peopl we had fallen among
were evid ignor of the natur of firearm for the constern
caus by our shot and their effect upon the anim wa prodigi
some of the parti in the boat began to cry out in fear other
turn and made off as hard as thei could and even the old gentleman
with the sword look greatli puzzl and alarm and halt
hi big rowboat we had howev but littl time for observ
for just then the old bull render furiou by the wound he
had receiv rose fair within forti yard of us glare savag
we all fire and hit him in variou place and down he went
badli wound curios now began to overcom the fear of the
onlook and some of them sail on up close to us amongst
these be the man and woman whom we had first seen a coupl
of hour or so befor who drew up almost alongsid just then
the great brute rose again within ten yard of their base and
instantli with a roar of furi made at it openmouth the woman
shriek and the man tri to give the boat wai but without
success in anoth second i saw the huge red jaw and gleam
ivori close with a crunch on the frail craft take an enorm
mouth out of it side and capsiz it down went the boat
leav it occup struggl in the water next moment
befor we could do anyth toward save them the huge and
furiou creatur wa up again and make openmouth at the
poor girl who wa struggl in the water lift my rifl
just as the grind jaw were about to close on her i fire
over her head right down the hippopotamuss throat over he
went and commenc turn round and round snort and blow
red stream of blood through hi nostril befor he could recov
himself howev i let him have the other barrel in the side
of the throat and that finish him he never move or struggl
again but instantli sank our next effort wa direct toward
save the girl the man have swum off toward anoth boat
and in thi we were fortun success pull her into
the cano amidst the shout of the spectat consider
exhaust and frighten but otherwis unhurt
meanwhil the boat had gather togeth at a distanc and
we could see that the occup who were evid much frighten
were consult what to do without give them time for further
consider which we thought might result unfavour to
ourselv we instantli took our paddl and advanc toward
them good stand in the bow and take off hi cock hat
polit in everi direct hi amiabl featur suffus by
a bland but intellig smile most of the craft retreat as
we advanc but a few held their ground while the big rowboat
came on to meet us present we were alongsid and i could
see that our appear and especi good and umslopogaass
fill the venerablelook command with astonish
not unmix with aw he wa dress after the same fashion
as the man we first met except that hi shirt wa not made of
brown cloth but of pure white linen hem with purpl the
kilt howev wa ident and so were the thick ring of
gold around the arm and beneath the left knee the rower wore
onli a kilt their bodi be nake to the waist good took
off hi hat to the old gentleman with an extra flourish and
inquir after hi health in the purest english to which he
repli by lai the first two finger of hi right hand horizont
across hi lip and hold them there for a moment which we
took as hi method of salut then he also address some
remark to us in the same soft accent that had distinguish
our first interview which we were forc to indic we did
not understand by shake our head and shrug our shoulder
thi last alphons be to the manner born did to perfect
and in so polit a wai that nobodi could take ani offenc then
we came a standstil till i be exceedingli hungri thought
i might as well call attent to the fact and did so first
by open my mouth and point down it and then rub my
stomach these signal the old gentleman clearli understood
for he nod hi head vigor and point toward the harbour
and at the same time on of the men on hi boat threw us a line
and motion to us to make it fast which we did the rowboat
then took us in tow and went with great rapid toward the
mouth of the river accompani by all the other boat in about
twenti minut more we reach the entranc to the harbour which
wa crowd with boat full of peopl who had come out to see
us we observ that all the occup were more or less of
the same type though some were fairer than other inde
we notic certain ladi whose skin wa of a most dazzl white
and the darkest shade of colour which we saw wa about that of
a rather swarthi spaniard present the wide river gave a sweep
and when it did so an exclam of astonish and delight
burst from our lip as we caught our first view of the place
that we afterward knew as milosi or the frown citi from
mi which mean citi and losi a frown
at a distanc of some five hundr yard from the river bank
rose a sheer precipic of granit two hundr feet or so in
height which had no doubt onc form the bank itself the
intermedi space of land now util as dock and roadwai
have been gain by drain and deepen and embank
the stream
on the brow of thi precipic stood a great build of the same
granit that form the cliff built on three side of a squar
the fourth side be open save for a kind of battlement pierc
at it base by a littl door thi impos place we afterward
discov wa the palac of the queen or rather of the queen
at the back of the palac the town slope gentli upward to
a flash build of white marbl crown by the golden dome
which we had alreadi observ the citi wa with the except
of thi on build entir built of red granit and laid
out in regular block with splendid roadwai between so far
as we could see also the hous were all onestori and detach
with garden round them which gave some relief to the ey weari
with the vista of red granit at the back of the palac a road
of extraordinari width stretch awai up the hill for a distanc
of a mile and a half or so and appear to termin at an open
space surround the gleam build that crown the hill
but right in front of us wa the wonder and glori of milosi
the great staircas of the palac the magnific of which
took our breath awai let the reader imagin if he can a splendid
stairwai sixtyf feet from balustrad to balustrad consist
of two vast flight each of on hundr and twentyf step
of eight inch in height by three feet broad connect by a
flat restingplac sixti feet in length and run from the
palac wall on the edg of the precipic down to meet a waterwai
or canal cut to it foot from the river thi marvel staircas
wa support upon a singl enorm granit arch of which the
restingplac between the two flight form the crown that
is the connect open space lai upon it from thi archwai
sprang a subsidiari fly arch or rather someth that resembl
a fly arch in shape such as none of us had seen in ani other
countri and of which the beauti and wonder surpass all that
we had ever imagin three hundr feet from point to point
and no less than five hundr and fifti round the curv that
halfarc soar touch the bridg it support for a space
of fifti feet onli on end rest on and built into the parent
archwai and the other embed in the solid granit of the side
of the precipic
thi staircas with it support wa inde a work of which
ani live man might have been proud both on account of it
magnitud and it surpass beauti four time as we afterward
learnt did the work which wa commenc in remot antiqu
fail and wa then abandon for three centuri when halffinish
till at last there rose a youth engin name radema who
said that he would complet it successfulli and stake hi life
upon it if he fail he wa to be hurl from the precipic
he had undertaken to scale if he succeed he wa to be reward
by the hand of the king daughter five year wa given to
him to complet the work and an unlimit suppli of labour and
materi three time did hi arch fall till at last see
failur to be inevit he determin to commit suicid on
the morrow of the third collaps that night howev a beauti
woman came to him in a dream and touch hi forehead and of
a sudden he saw a vision of the complet work and saw too through
the masonri and how the difficulti connect with the fly
arch that had hitherto baffl hi geniu were to be overcom
then he awok and onc more commenc the work but on a differ
plan and behold he achiev it and on the last dai of the
five year he led the princess hi bride up the stair and into
the palac and in due cours he becam king by right of hi
wife and found the present zuvendi dynasti which is to thi
dai call the hous of the stairwai thu prove onc more
how energi and talent ar the natur steppingston to grandeur
and to commemor hi triumph he fashion a statu of himself
dream and of the fair woman who touch him on the forehead
and place it in the great hall of the palac and there it stand
to thi dai
such wa the great stair of milosi and such the citi beyond
no wonder thei name it the frown citi for certainli those
mighti work in solid granit did seem to frown down upon our
littl in their sombr splendour thi wa so even in the
sunshin but when the stormcloud gather on her imperi
brow milosi look more like a supernatur dwellingplac
or some imagin of a poet brain than what she is
a mortal citi carven by the patient geniu of gener out

befor she went awai she kiss my hand i suppos as a token
of gratitud for have save her from the furi of the hippopotamu
and it seem to me that she had by thi time quit got over
ani fear she might have had of us and wa by no mean anxiou
to return in such a hurri to her law owner at ani rate
she wa go to kiss good hand as well as mine when the young
man interf and led her off as soon as we were on shore
a number of the men who had row the big boat took possess
of our few good and chattel and start with them up the splendid
staircas our guid indic to us by mean of motion that
the thing were perfectli safe thi done he turn to the
right and led the wai to a small hous which wa as i afterward
discov an inn enter into a goodsiz room we saw
that a wooden tabl wa alreadi furnish with food presum
in prepar for us here our guid motion us to be seat
on a bench that ran the length of the tabl we did not requir
a second invit but at onc fell to raven on the viand
befor us which were serv on wooden platter and consist
of cold goatsflesh wrap up in some kind of leaf that gave
it a delici flavour green veget resembl lettuc
brown bread and red wine pour from a skin into horn mug
thi wine wa peculiarli soft and good have someth of
the flavour of burgundi twenti minut after we sat down at
that hospit board we rose from it feel like new men
after all that we had gone through we need two thing food
and rest and the food of itself wa a great bless to us
two girl of the same charm cast of face as the first whom
we had seen wait on us while we at and veri nice thei did
it thei were also dress in the same fashion name in a
white linen petticoat come to the knee and with the togalik
garment of brown cloth leav bare the right arm and breast
i afterward found out that thi wa the nation dress and
regul by an iron custom though of cours subject to variat
thu if the petticoat wa pure white it signifi that the
wearer wa unmarri if white with a straight purpl stripe
round the edg that she wa marri and a first or legal wife
if with a black stripe that she wa a widow in the same wai
the toga or kaf as thei call it wa of differ shade
of colour from pure white to the deepest brown accord to
the rank of the wearer and embroid at the end in variou
wai thi also appli to the shirt or tunic worn by the
men which vari in materi and colour but the kilt were
alwai the same except as regard qualiti on thing howev
everi man and woman in the countri wore as the nation insignia
and that wa the thick band of gold round the right arm abov
the elbow and the left leg beneath the knee peopl of high
rank also wore a torqu of gold round the neck and i observ
that our guid had on on
so soon as we had finish our meal our vener conductor
who had been stand all the while regard us with inquir
ey and our gun with someth as like fear as hi pride would
allow him to show bow toward good whom he evid took
for the leader of the parti on account of the splendour of hi
apparel and onc more led the wai through the door and to the
foot of the great staircas here we paus for a moment to
admir two coloss lion each hewn from a singl block of pure
black marbl and stand rampant on the termin of the
wide balustrad of the staircas these lion ar magnific
execut and it is said were sculptur by radema the great
princ who design the staircas and who wa without doubt
to judg from the mani beauti exampl of hi art that we
saw afterward on of the finest sculptor who ever live either
in thi or ani other countri then we climb almost with a
feel of aw up that splendid stair a work execut for all
time and that will i do not doubt be admir thousand of year
henc by gener unborn unless an earthquak should throw
it down even umslopogaa who as a gener rule made it a point
of honour not to show astonish which he consid undignifi
wa fairli startl out of himself and ask if the bridg
had been built by men or devil which wa hi vagu wai of
allud to ani supernatur power but alphons did not care
about it it solid grandeur jar upon the frivol littl
frenchman who said that it wa all tre magnifiqu mai trist
ah trist and went on to suggest that it would be improv
if the balustrad were gilt
on we went up the first flight of on hundr and twenti step
across the broad platform join it to the second flight where
we paus to admir the gloriou view of on of the most beauti
stretch of countri that the world can show edg by the blue
water of the lake then we pass on up the stair till at last
we reach the top where we found a larg stand space to
which there were three entranc all of small size two of
these open on to rather narrow galleri or roadwai cut in
the face of the precipic that ran round the palac wall and
led to the princip thoroughfar of the citi and were us
by the inhabit pass up and down from the dock these
were defend by gate of bronz and also as we afterward
learnt it wa possibl to let down a portion of the roadwai
themselv by withdraw certain bolt and thu render it quit
impractic for an enemi to pass the third entranc consist
of a flight of ten curv black marbl step lead to a doorwai
cut in the palac wall thi wall wa in itself a work of art
be built of huge block of granit to the height of forti
feet and so fashion that it face wa concav wherebi it
wa render practic imposs for it to be scale to
thi doorwai our guid led us the door which wa massiv
and made of wood protect by an outer gate of bronz wa close
but on our approach it wa thrown wide and we were met by the
challeng of a sentri who wa arm with a heavi triangularblad
spear not unlik a bayonet in shape and a cut sword and
protect by breast and back plate of skilfulli prepar hippopotamu
hide and a small round shield fashion of the same tough materi
the sword instantli attract our attent it wa practic
ident with the on in the possess of mr mackenzi which
he had obtain from the illstar wander there wa no
mistak the goldlin fretwork cut in the thick of the
blade so the man had told the truth after all our guid instantli
gave a password which the soldier acknowledg by let the
iron shaft of hi spear fall with a ring sound upon the pavement
and we pass on through the massiv wall into the courtyard
of the palac thi wa about forti yard squar and laid out
in flowerb full of love shrub and plant mani of which
were quit new to me through the centr of thi garden ran
a broad walk form of powder shell brought from the lake
in the place of gravel follow thi we came to anoth doorwai
with a round heavi arch which is hung with thick curtain for
there ar no door in the palac itself then came anoth short
passag and we were in the great hall of the palac and onc
more stood astonish at the simpl and yet overpow grandeur
of the place
the hall is as we afterward learnt on hundr and fifti feet
long by eighti wide and ha a magnific arch roof of carv
wood down the entir length of the build there ar on either
side and at a distanc of twenti feet from the wall slender
shaft of black marbl spring sheer to the roof beautifulli
flute and with carv capit at on end of thi great place
which these pillar support is the group of which i have alreadi
spoken as execut by the king radema to commemor hi build
of the staircas and realli when we had time to admir it
it loveli almost struck us dumb the group of which the
figur ar in white and the rest is black marbl is about
half as larg again as life and repres a young man of nobl
counten and form sleep heavili upon a couch on arm
is carelessli thrown over the side of thi couch and hi head
repos upon the other it curl lock partial hide it
bend over him her hand rest on hi forehead is a drape
femal form of such white loveli as to make the behold
breath stand still and as for the calm glori that shine upon
her perfect face well i can never hope to describ it but
there it rest like the shadow of an angel smile and power
love and divin all have their part in it her ey ar fix
upon the sleep youth and perhap the most extraordinari thing
about thi beauti work is the success with which the artist
ha succeed in depict on the sleeper worn and weari face
the sudden rise of a new and spiritu thought as the spell
begin to work within hi mind you can see that an inspir
is break in upon the dark of the man soul as the dawn
break in upon the dark of night it is a gloriou piec
of statuari and none but a geniu could have conceiv it
between each of the black marbl column is some such group of
figur some allegor and some repres the person
and wive of deceas monarch or great men but none of them
in our opinion come up the on i have describ although sever
ar from the hand of the sculptor and engin king radema
in the exact centr of the hall wa a solid mass of black marbl
about the size of a babi armchair which it rather resembl
in appear thi as we afterward learnt wa the sacr
stone of thi remark peopl and on it their monarch laid
their hand after the ceremoni of coron and swore by the
sun to safeguard the interest of the empir and to maintain
it custom tradit and law thi stone wa evid
exceedingli ancient as inde all stone ar and wa score
down it side with long mark or line which sir henri said
prove it to have been a fragment that at some remot period
in it histori had been ground in the iron jaw of glacier
there wa a curiou propheci about thi block of marbl which
wa report among the peopl to have fallen from the sun to
the effect that when it wa shatter into fragment a king of
alien race should rule over the land as the stone howev
look remark solid the nativ princ seem to have a
fair chanc of keep their own for mani a long year
at the end of the hall is a dai spread with rich carpet on
which two throne ar set side by side these throne ar shape
like great chair and made of solid gold the seat ar richli
cushion but the back ar left bare and on each is carv
the emblem of the sun shoot out hi fieri rai in all direct
the footstool ar golden lion couchant with yellow topaz
set in them for ey there ar no other gem about them
the place is light by numer but narrow window place high
up cut on the principl of the loophol to be seen in ancient
castl but innoc of glass which wa evid unknown here
such is a brief descript of thi splendid hall in which we
now found ourselv compil of cours from our subsequ knowledg
of it on thi occas we had but littl time for observ
for when we enter we perceiv that a larg number of men were
gather togeth in front of the two throne which were unoccupi
the princip among them were seat on carv wooden chair
rang to the right and the left of the throne but not in front
of them and were dress in white tunic with variou embroideri
and differ colour edg and arm with the usual pierc
and goldinlaid sword to judg from the digniti of their appear
thei seem on and all to be individu of veri great import
behind each of these great men stood a small knot of follow
and attend
seat by themselv in a littl group to the left of the throne
were six men of a differ stamp instead of wear the ordinari
kilt thei were cloth in long robe of pure white linen with
the same symbol of the sun that is to be seen on the back of
the chair emblazon in gold thread upon the breast thi
garment wa girt up at the waist with a simpl golden curblik
chain from which hung long ellipt plate of the same metal
fashion in shini scale like those of a fish that as their
wearer move jingl and reflect the light thei were all
men of matur ag and of a sever and impress cast of featur
which wa render still more impos by the long beard thei wore
the person of on individu among them howev impress
us at onc he seem to stand out among hi fellow and refus
to be overlook he wa veri old eighti at least and
extrem tall with a long snowwhit beard that hung nearli
to hi waist hi featur were aquilin and deepli cut and
hi ey were grei and coldlook the head of the other
were bare but thi man wore a round cap entir cover with
gold embroideri from which we judg that he wa a person of
great import and inde we afterward discov that he
wa agon the high priest of the countri as we approach
all these men includ the priest rose and bow to us with
the greatest courtesi at the same time place the two finger
across the lip in salut then softfoot attend advanc
from between the pillar bear seat which were place in
a line in front of the throne we three sat down alphons
and umslopogaa stand behind us scarc had we done so
when there came a blare of trumpet from some passag to the
right and a similar blare from the left next a man with a
long white wand of ivori appear just in front of the righthand
throne and cri out someth in a loud voic end with
the word nyleptha repeat three time and anoth man similarli
attir call out a similar sentenc befor the other throne
but end with the word sorai also repeat thrice then
came the tramp of arm men from each side entranc and in file
about a score of pick and magnific accoutr guard who
form up on each side of the throne and let their heavi ironhandl
spear fall simultan with a clash upon the black marbl
floor anoth doubl blare of trumpet and in from either
side each attend by six maiden swept the two queen of zuvendi
everybodi in the hall rise to greet them as thei came
i have seen beauti women in my dai and am no longer thrown
into transport at the sight of a pretti face but languag fail
me when i try to give some idea of the blaze of loveli that
then broke upon us in the person of these sister queen both
were young perhap fiveandtwenti year of ag both were
tall and exquisit form but there the like stop
on nyleptha wa a woman of dazzl fair her right arm
and breast bare after the custom of her peopl show like
snow even against her white and goldembroid kaf or toga
and as for her sweet face all i can sai is that it wa on
that few men could look on and forget her hair a verit
crown of gold cluster in short ringlet over her shape head
half hide the ivori brow beneath which ey of deep and gloriou
grei flash out in tender majesti i cannot attempt to describ
her other featur onli the mouth wa most sweet and curv
like cupid bow and over the whole counten there shone
an indescrib look of lovingkind lit up by a shadow
of delic humour that lai upon her face like a touch of silver
on a rosi cloud
she wore no jewel but on her neck arm and knee were the usual
torqu of gold in thi instanc fashion like a snake and
her dress wa of pure white linen of excess fine plentifulli
embroid with gold and with the familiar symbol of the sun
her twin sister sorai wa of a differ and darker type of
beauti her hair wa wavi like nyleptha but coalblack and
fell in mass on her shoulder her complexion wa oliv her
ey larg dark and lustrou the lip were full and i thought
rather cruel somehow her face quiet and even cold as it is
gave an idea of passion in repos and caus on to wonder involuntarili
what it aspect would be if anyth occur to break the calm
it remind me of the deep sea that even on the bluest dai
never lose it visibl stamp of power and in it murmur
sleep is yet instinct with the spirit of the storm her figur
like her sister wa almost perfect in it curv and outlin
but a trifl more round and her dress wa absolut the same
as thi love pair swept onward to their respect throne
amid the deep attent silenc of the court i wa bound to
confess to myself that thei did inde fulfil my idea of royalti
royal thei were in everi wai in form in grace and queenli
digniti and in the barbar splendour of their attend pomp
but methought that thei need no guard or gold to proclaim
their power and bind the loyalti of wayward men a glanc from
those bright ey or a smile from those sweet lip and while
the red blood run in the vein of youth women such as these
will never lack subject readi to do their bid to the death
but after all thei were women first and queen afterward and
therefor not devoid of curios as thei pass to their seat
i saw both of them glanc swiftli in our direct i saw too
that their ey pass by me see noth to charm them in
the person of an insignific and grizzl old man then thei
look with evid astonish on the grim form of old umslopogaa
who rais hi ax in salut attract next by the splendour
of good apparel for a second their glanc rest on him like
a hum moth upon a flower then off it dart to where sir
henri curti stood the sunlight from a window plai upon hi
yellow hair and peak beard and mark the outlin of hi
massiv frame against the twilight of the somewhat gloomi hall
he rais hi ey and thei met the fair nyleptha full and
thu for the first time the goodliest man and woman that it ha
ever been my lot to see look on upon anoth and why it
wa i know not but i saw the swift blood run up nyleptha skin
as the pink light run up the morn sky red grew her fair
bosom and shape arm red the swanlik neck the round cheek
blush red as the petal of a rose and then the crimson flood
sank back to whenc it came and left her pale and trembl
i glanc at sir henri he too had colour up to the ey
oh my word thought i to myself the ladi have come on
the stage and now we mai look to the plot to develop itself
and i sigh and shook my head know that the beauti of a
woman is like the beauti of the lightn a destruct thing
and a caus of desol by the time that i had finish my
reflect both the queen were on the throne for all thi
had happen in about six second onc more the unseen trumpet
blare out and then the court seat itself and queen sorai
motion to us to do likewis
next from among the crowd whither he had withdrawn step forward
our guid the old gentleman who had tow us ashor hold
by the hand the girl whom we had seen first and afterward rescu
from the hippopotamu have made obeis he proceed to
address the queen evid describ to them the wai and
place where we had been found it wa most amus to watch
the astonish not unmix with fear reflect upon their
face as thei listen to hi tale clearli thei could not understand
how we had reach the lake and been found float on it and
were inclin to attribut our presenc to supernatur caus
then the narr proceed as i judg from the frequent
appeal that our guid made to the girl to the point where we
had shot the hippopotami and we at onc perceiv that there
wa someth veri wrong about those hippopotami for the histori
wa frequent interrupt by indign exclam from the
littl group of whiterob priest and even from the courtier
while the two queen listen with an amaz express especi
when our guid point to the rifl in our hand as be the
mean of destruct and here to make matter clear i mai
as well explain at onc that the inhabit of zuvendi ar
sunworshipp and that for some reason or anoth the hippopotamu
is sacr among them not that thei do not kill it becaus
at a certain season of the year thei slaughter thousand which
ar special preserv in larg lake up the countri and
us their hide for armour for soldier but thi doe not prevent
them from consid these anim as sacr to the sun endnot 11
now as ill luck would have it the particular hippopotami we
had shot were a famili of tame anim that were kept in the
mouth of the port and daili fed by priest whose special duti
it wa to attend to them when we shot them i thought that the
brute were suspici tame and thi wa as we afterward
ascertain the caus of it thu it came about that in attempt
to show off we had commit sacrileg of a most aggrav natur
when our guid had finish hi tale the old man with the long
beard and round cap whose appear i have alreadi describ
and who wa as i have said the high priest of the countri
and known by the name of agon rose and commenc an impass
harangu i did not like the look of hi cold grei ey as he
fix it on us i should have like it still less had i known
that in the name of the outrag majesti of hi god he wa demand
that the whole lot of us should be offer up as a sacrific
by mean of be burnt aliv
after he had finish speak the queen sorai address him
in a soft and music voic and appear to judg from hi
gestur of dissent to be put the other side of the question
befor him then nyleptha spoke in liquid accent littl did
we know that she wa plead for our live final she turn
and address a tall soldierlik man of middl ag with a black
beard and a long plain sword whose name as we afterward learnt
wa nasta and who wa the greatest lord in the countri appar
appeal to him for support now when sir henri had caught
her ey and she had blush so rosi red i had seen that the
incid had not escap thi man notic and what is more
that it wa emin disagre to him for he bit hi lip
and hi hand tighten on hi swordhilt afterward we learnt
that he wa an aspir for the hand of thi queen in marriag
which account for it thi be so nyleptha could not have
appeal to a wors person for speak in slow heavi tone
he appear to confirm all that the high priest agon had said
as he spoke sorai put her elbow on her knee and rest
her chin on her hand look at him with a suppress smile upon
her lip as though she saw through the man and wa determin
to be hi match but nyleptha grew veri angri her cheek flush
her ey flash and she did inde look love final she
turn to agon and seem to give some sort of qualifi assent
for he bow at her word and as she spoke she move her hand
as though to emphas what she said while all the time sorai
kept her chin on her hand and smile then suddenli nyleptha
made a sign the trumpet blew again and everybodi rose to leav
the hall save ourselv and the guard whom she motion to stai
when thei were all gone she bent forward and smile sweetli
partial by sign and partial by exclam made it clear
to us that she wa veri anxiou to know where we came from
the difficulti wa how to explain but at last an idea struck
me i had my larg pocketbook in my pocket and a pencil take
it out i made a littl sketch of a lake and then as best i
could i drew the underground river and the lake at the other
end when i had done thi i advanc to the step of the throne
and gave it to her she understood it at onc and clap her
hand with delight and then descend from the throne took
it to her sister sorai who also evid understood next
she took the pencil from me and after examin it with curios
proceed to make a seri of delight littl sketch the
first repres herself hold out both hand in welcom
and a man uncommonli like sir henri take them next she drew
a love littl pictur of a hippopotamu roll about dy
in the water and of an individu in whom we had no difficulti
in recogn agon the high priest hold up hi hand in
horror on the bank then follow a most alarm pictur of
a dread fieri furnac and of the same figur agon poke
us into it with a fork stick thi pictur perfectli horrifi
me but i wa a littl reassur when she nod sweetli and
proceed to make a fourth draw a man again uncommonli
like sir henri and of two women in whom i recogn sorai
and herself each with on arm around him and hold a sword
in protect over him to all of these sorai who i saw wa
emploi in carefulli take us all in especi curti
signifi her approv by nod
at last nyleptha drew a final sketch of a rise sun indic
that she must go and that we should meet on the follow morn
whereat sir henri look so disappoint that she saw it and
i suppos by wai of consol extend her hand to him to
kiss which he did with piou fervour at the same time sorai
off whom good had never taken hi eyeglass dure the whole indaba
interview reward him by give him her hand to kiss though
while she did so her ey were fix upon sir henri i am glad
to sai that i wa not implic in these proceed neither
of them gave me her hand to kiss
then nyleptha turn and address the man who appear to be
in command of the bodyguard appar from her manner and hi
frequent obeis give him veri stringent and care order
after which with a somewhat coquettish nod and smile she left
the hall follow by sorai and most of the guard
when the queen had gone the offic whom nyleptha had address
came forward and with mani token of deep respect led us from
the hall through variou passag to a sumptuou set of apart
open out of a larg central room light with brazen swing
lamp for it wa now dusk and richli carpet and strewn with
couch on a tabl in the centr of the room wa set a profus
of food and fruit and what is more flower there wa a delici
wine also in ancientlook seal earthenwar flagon and
beautifulli chase golden and ivori cup to drink it from servant
male and femal also were there to minist to us and whilst
we at from some recess outsid the apart
the silver lute did speak between
the trumpet lordli blow
and altogeth we found ourselv in a sort of earthli paradis
which wa onli disturb by the vision of that disgust high
priest who intend to commit us to the flame but so veri
weari were we with our labour that we could scarc keep ourselv
awak through the sumptuou meal and as soon as it wa over
we indic that we desir to sleep as a further precaut
against surpris we left umslopogaa with hi ax to sleep in
the main chamber near the curtain doorwai lead to the apart
which we occupi respect good and i in the on and sir
henri and alphons in the other then throw off our cloth
with the except of the mail shirt which we consid it
safer to keep on we flung ourselv down upon the low and luxuri
couch and drew the silkembroid coverlid over us
in two minut i wa just drop off when i wa arous by
good voic

if he continu to pass sorai beauti in mental review and
what is more i dont care
chapter xiii
about the zuvendi peopl
and now the curtain is down for a few hour and the actor in
thi novel drama ar plung in dewi sleep perhap we should
except nyleptha whom the reader mai if poetic inclin
imagin ly in her bed of state encompass by her maiden
tire women guard and all the other peopl and appurten
that surround a throne and yet not abl to slumber for think
of the stranger who had visit a countri where no such stranger
had ever come befor and wonder as she lai awak who thei
were and what their past ha been and if she wa ugli compar
to the women of their nativ place i howev not be poetic
inclin will take advantag of the lull to give some account
of the peopl among whom we found ourselv compil needless
to state from inform which we subsequ collect
the name of thi countri to begin at the begin is zuvendi
from zu yellow and vendi place or countri why it is
call the yellow countri i have never been abl to ascertain
accur nor do the inhabit themselv know three reason
ar howev given each of which would suffic to account for
it the first is that the name ow it origin to the great
quantiti of gold that is found in the land inde in thi
respect zuvendi is a verit eldorado the preciou metal
be extraordinarili plenti at present it is collect
from pure alluvi dig which we subsequ inspect
and which ar situat within a dai journei from milosi be
mostli found in pocket and in nugget weigh from an ounc
up to six or seven pound in weight but other dig of a
similar natur ar known to exist and i have besid seen great
vein of goldbear quartz in zuvendi gold is a much common
metal than silver and thu it ha curious enough come to pass
that silver is the legal tender of the countri
the second reason given is that at certain time of the year
the nativ grass of the countri which ar veri sweet and good
turn as yellow as ripe corn and the third aris from a tradit
that the peopl were origin yellow skin but grew white
after live for mani gener upon these high land zuvendi
is a countri about the size of franc is roughli speak
oval in shape and on everi side cut off from the surround
territori by illimit forest of impenetr thorn beyond
which ar said to be hundr of mile of morass desert
and great mountain it is in short a huge high tableland
rise up in the centr of the dark contin much as in southern
africa flattop mountain rise from the level of the surround
veldt milosi itself li accord to my aneroid at a level
of about nine thousand feet abov the sea but most of the land
is even higher the greatest elev of the open countri be
i believ about eleven thousand feet as a consequ the
climat is compar speak a cold on be veri similar
to that of southern england onli brighter and not so raini
the land is howev exceedingli fertil and grow all cereal
and temper fruit and timber to perfect and in the lowerli
part even produc a hardi varieti of sugarcan coal is found
in great abund and in mani place crop out from the surfac
and so is pure marbl both black and white the same mai be
said of almost everi metal except silver which is scarc and
onli to be obtain from a rang of mountain in the north
zuvendi compris in her boundari a great varieti of sceneri
includ two rang of snowclad mountain on on the western
boundari beyond the impenetr belt of thorn forest and the
other pierc the countri from north to south and pass at
a distanc of about eighti mile from milosi from which town
it higher peak ar distinctli visibl thi rang form the
chief watersh of the land there ar also three larg lake
the biggest name that whereon we emerg and which is
name milosi after the citi cover some two hundr squar
mile of countri and numer small on some of them salt
the popul of thi favour land is compar speak
dens number at a rough estim from ten to twelv million
it is almost pure agricultur in it habit and divid
into great class as in civil countri there is a territori
nobil a consider middl class form princip of
merchant offic of the armi etc but the great bulk of
the peopl ar welltodo peasant who live upon the land of
the lord from whom thei hold under a speci of feudal tenur
the best bred peopl in the countri ar as i think i have said
pure white with a somewhat southern cast of counten but
the common herd ar much darker though thei do not show ani
negro or other african characterist as to their descent
i can give no certain inform their written record which
extend back for about a thousand year give no hint of it
on veri ancient chronicl doe inde in allud to some
old tradit that exist in hi dai talk of it as have probabl
origin come down with the peopl from the coast but that
mai mean littl or noth in short the origin of the zuvendi
is lost in the mist of time whenc thei came or of what race
thei ar no man know their architectur and some of their
sculptur suggest an egyptian or possibl an assyrian origin
but it is well known that their present remark style of build
ha onli sprung up within the last eight hundr year and thei
certainli retain no trace of egyptian theologi or custom
again their appear and some of their habit ar rather jewish
but here again it seem hardli conceiv that thei should have
utterli lost all trace of the jewish religion still for aught
i know thei mai be on of the lost ten tribe whom peopl ar
so fond of discov all over the world or thei mai not
i do not know and so can onli describ them as i find them
and leav wiser head than mine to make what thei can out of
it if inde thi account should ever be read at all which
is exceedingli doubt
and now after i have said all thi i am after all go to
hazard a theori of my own though it is onli a veri littl on
as the young ladi said in mitig of her babi thi theori
is found on a legend which i have heard among the arab on
the east coast which is to the effect that more than two thousand
year ago there were troubl in the countri which wa known
as babylonia and that thereon a vast hord of persian came
down to bushir where thei took ship and were driven by the
northeast monsoon to the east coast of africa where accord
to the legend the sun and fire worshipp fell into conflict
with the belt of arab settler who even then were settl on
the east coast and final broke their wai through them and
vanish into the interior were no more seen now i ask
is it not at least possibl that the zuvendi peopl ar the
descend of these sun and fire worshipp who broke through
the arab and vanish as a matter of fact there is a good
deal in their charact and custom that talli with the somewhat
vagu idea that i have of persian of cours we have no book
of refer here but sir henri sai that if hi memori doe
not fail him there wa a tremend revolt in babylon about
500 bc whereon a vast multitud were expel from the citi
anyhow it is a wellestablish fact that there have been mani
separ emigr of persian from the persian gulf to the
east coast of africa up to as late as seven hundr year ago
there ar persian tomb at kilwa on the east coast still in
good repair which bear date show them to be just seven hundr
year old endnot 12
in addit to be an agricultur peopl the zuvendi ar
oddli enough excess warlik and as thei cannot from the
exig of their posit make war upon other nation thei
fight among each other like the fame kilkenni cat with the
happi result that the popul never outgrow the power of
the countri to support it thi habit of their is larg foster
by the polit condit of the countri the monarchi is nomin
an absolut on save in so far as it is temper by the power
of the priest and the inform council of the great lord but
as in mani other institut the king writ doe not run unquest
throughout the length and breadth of the land in short the
whole system is a pure feudal on though absolut serfdom
or slaveri is unknown all the great lord hold nomin
from the throne but a number of them be practic independ
have the power of life and death wage war against and make
peac with their neighbour as the whim or their interest lead
them and even on occas rise in open rebellion against their
royal master or mistress and safe shut up in their castl
and fenc citi as far from the seat of govern successfulli
defi them for year
zuvendi ha had it kingmak as well as england a fact
that will be well appreci when i state that eight differ
dynasti have sat upon the throne in the last on thousand year
everi on of which took it rise from some nobl famili that
succeed in grasp the purpl after a sanguinari struggl
at the date of our arriv in the countri thing were a littl
better than thei had been for some centuri the last king
the father of nyleptha and sorai have been an exception
abl and vigor ruler and as a consequ he kept down
the power of the priest and nobl on hi death two year
befor we reach zuvendi the twin sister hi children
were follow an ancient preced call to the throne sinc
an attempt to exclud either would instantli have provok a
sanguinari civil war but it wa gener felt in the countri
that thi measur wa a most unsatisfactori on and could hardli
be expect to be perman inde as it wa the variou
intrigu that were set on foot by ambiti nobl to obtain
the hand of on or other of the queen in marriag had disquiet
the countri and the gener opinion wa that there would be
bloodsh befor long
i will now pass on to the question of the zuvendi religion
which is noth more or less than sunworship of a pronounc
and highli develop charact around thi sunworship is group
the entir social system of the zuvendi it send it root
through everi institut and custom of the land from the cradl
to the grave the zuvendi follow the sun in everi sens of the
sai as an infant he is solemnli held up in it light and
dedic to the symbol of good the express of power and
the hope of etern the ceremoni answer to our baptism
whilst still a tini child hi parent point out the gloriou
orb as the presenc of a visibl and benefic god and he worship
it at it upris and downset then when still quit
small he goe hold fast to the pendent end of hi mother
kaf toga up to the templ of the sun of the nearest citi
and there when at middai the bright beam strike down upon the
golden central altar and beat back the fire that burn thereon
he hear the whiterob priest rais their solemn chant of
prais and see the peopl fall down to ador and then amidst
the blow of the golden trumpet watch the sacrific thrown
into the fieri furnac beneath the altar here he come again
to be declar a man by the priest and consecr to war
and to good work here befor the solemn altar he lead hi
bride and here too if differ shall unhappili aris he
divorc her
and so on down life long pathwai till the last mile is travel
and he come again arm inde and with digniti but no longer
a man here thei bear him dead and lai hi bier upon the fall
brazen door befor the eastern altar and when the last rai
from the set sun fall upon hi white face the bolt ar
drawn and he vanish into the rage furnac beneath and is end
the priest of the sun do not marri but ar recruit as young
men special devot to the work by their parent and support
by the state the nomin to the higher offic of the priesthood
li with the crown but onc appoint the nomine cannot be
dispossess and it is scarc too much to sai that thei realli
rule the land to begin with thei ar a unit bodi sworn to
obedi and secreci so that an order issu by the high priest
at milosi will be instantli and unhesitatingli act upon by
the resid priest of a littl countri town three or four hundr
mile off thei ar the judg of the land crimin and civil
an appeal ly onli to the lord paramount of the district and
from him to the king and thei have of cours practic unlimit
jurisdict over religi and moral offenc togeth with
a right of excommun which as in the faith of more highli
civil land is a veri effect weapon inde their right
and power ar almost unlimit but i mai as well state here
that the priest of the sun ar wise in their gener and
do not push thing too far it is but veri seldom that thei
go to extrem against anybodi be more inclin to exercis
the prerog of merci than run the risk of exasper the
power and vigorousmind peopl on whose neck thei have set
their yoke lest it should rise and break it off altogeth
anoth sourc of the power of the priest is their practic
monopoli of learn and their veri consider astronom
knowledg which enabl them to keep a hold on the popular mind
by predict eclips and even comet in zuvendi onli a
few of the upper class can read and write but nearli all the
priest have thi knowledg and ar therefor look upon as
learn men
the law of the countri is on the whole mild and just but differ
in sever respect from our civil law for instanc the
law of england is much more sever upon offenc against properti
than against the person as becom a peopl whose rule passion
is monei a man mai half kick hi wife to death or inflict horribl
suffer upon hi children at a much cheaper rate of punish
than he can compound for the theft of a pair of old boot
in zuvendi thi is not so for there thei rightli or wrongli look
upon the person as of more consequ than good and chattel
and not as in england as a sort of necessari appendag to the
latter for murder the punish is death for treason death
for defraud the orphan and the widow for sacrileg and for
attempt to quit the countri which is look on as a sacrileg
death in each case the method of execut is the same and
a rather aw on the culprit is thrown aliv into the fieri
furnac beneath on of the altar to the sun for all other
offenc includ the offenc of idl the punish is
forc labour upon the vast nation build which ar alwai
go on in some part of the countri with or without period
flog accord to the crime
the social system of the zuvendi allow consider liberti
to the individu provid he doe not offend against the law
and custom of the countri thei ar polygam in theori though
most of them have onli on wife on account of the expens by
law a man is bound to provid a separ establish for each
wife the first wife also is the legal wife and her children
ar said to be of the hous of the father the children of
the other wive ar of the hous of their respect mother
thi doe not howev impli ani slur upon either mother or
children again a first wife can on enter into the marri
state make a bargain that her husband shall marri no other wife
thi howev is veri rare done as the women ar the great
uphold of polygami which not onli provid for their surplu
number but give greater import to the first wife who is
thu practic the head of sever household marriag is
look upon as primarili a civil contract and subject to certain
condit and to a proper provis for children is dissolubl
at the will of both contract parti the divorc or unloos
be formal and ceremoni accomplish by go through
certain portion of the marriag ceremoni backward
the zuvendi ar on the whole a veri kindli pleasant and lightheart
peopl thei ar not great trader and care littl about monei
onli work to earn enough to support themselv in that class
of life in which thei were born thei ar exceedingli conserv
and look with disfavour upon chang their legal tender is
silver cut into littl squar of differ weight gold is
the baser coin and is about of the same valu as our silver
it is howev much prize for it beauti and larg us
for ornament and decor purpos most of the trade howev
is carri on by mean of sale and barter payment be made
in kind agricultur is the great busi of the countri and
is realli well understood and carri out most of the avail
acreag be under cultiv great attent is also given
to the breed of cattl and hors the latter be unsurpass
by ani i have ever seen either in europ or africa
the land belong theoret to the crown and under the crown
to the great lord who again divid it among smaller lord
and so on down to the littl peasant farmer who work hi forti
reestu acr on a system of halfprofit with hi immedi
lord in fact the whole system is as i have said distinctli
feudal and it interest us much to meet with such an old friend
far in the unknown heart of africa
the tax ar veri heavi the state take a third of a man
total earn and the priesthood about five per cent on the
remaind but on the other hand if a man through ani caus
fall into bona fide misfortun the state support him in the
posit of life to which he belong if he is idl howev
he is sent to work on the govern undertak and the state
look after hi wive and children the state also make all
the road and build all town hous about which great care
is shown let them out to famili at a small rent it also
keep up a stand armi of about twenti thousand men and provid
watchmen etc in return for their five per cent the priest
attend to the servic of the templ carri out all religi
ceremoni and keep school where thei teach whatev thei
think desir which is not veri much some of the templ
also possess privat properti but priest as individu cannot
hold properti
and now come a question which i find some difficulti in answer
ar the zuvendi a civil or barbar peopl sometim
i think the on sometim the other in some branch of art
thei have attain the veri highest profici take for instanc
their build and their statuari i do not think that the
latter can be equal either in beauti or imagin power
anywher in the world and as for the former it mai have been
rival in ancient egypt but i am sure that it ha never been
sinc but on the other hand thei ar total ignor of
mani other art till sir henri who happen to know someth
about it show them how to do it by mix silica and lime
thei could not make a piec of glass and their crockeri is rather
primit a waterclock is their nearest approach to a watch
inde our delight them exceedingli thei know noth about
steam electr or gunpowd and mercifulli for themselv
noth about print or the penni post thu thei ar spare
mani evil for of a truth our ag ha learnt the wisdom of the
oldworld sai he who increaseth knowledg increaseth sorrow
as regard their religion it is a natur on for imagin
peopl who know no better and might therefor be expect to
turn to the sun and worship him as the allfath but it cannot
justli be call elev or spiritu it is true that thei
do sometim speak of the sun as the garment of the spirit
but it is a vagu term and what thei realli ador is the fieri
orb himself thei also call him the hope of etern but
here again the mean is vagu and i doubt if the phrase convei
ani veri clear impress to their mind some of them do inde
believ in a futur life for the good i know nyleptha doe
firmli but it is a privat faith aris from the prompt
of the spirit not an essenti of their creed so on the whole
i cannot sai that i consid thi sunworship as a religion indic
of a civil peopl howev magnific and impos it ritual
or howev moral and highsound the maxim of it priest
mani of whom i am sure have their own opinion on the whole
subject though of cours thei have noth but prais for a
system which provid them with so mani of the good thing of
thi world
there ar now onli two more matter to which i need allud
name the languag and the system of calligraphi as for
the former it is softsound and veri rich and flexibl
sir henri sai that it sound someth like modern greek
but of cours it ha no connect with it it is easi to acquir
be simpl in it construct and a peculiar qualiti about it
is it euphoni and the wai in which the sound of the word
adapt itself to the mean to be express long befor
we master the languag we could frequent make out what
wa meant by the ring of the sentenc it is on thi account
that the languag lend itself so well to poetic declam
of which these remark peopl ar veri fond the zuvendi
alphabet seem sir henri sai to be deriv like everi other
known system of letter from a phoenician sourc and therefor
more remot still from the ancient egyptian hierat write
whether thi is a fact i cannot sai not be learn in such
matter all i know about it is that their alphabet consist
of twentytwo charact of which a few notabl b e and o
ar not veri unlik our own the whole affair is howev clumsi
and puzzl endnot 13 but as the peopl of zuvendi ar
not given to the write of novel or of anyth except busi
document and record of the briefest charact it answer their
purpos well enough
chapter xiv
the flower templ
it wa halfpast eight by my watch when i woke on the morn
follow our arriv at milosi have slept almost exactli
twelv hour and i must sai that i did inde feel better
ah what a bless thing is sleep and what a differ twelv
hour of it or so make to us after dai and night of toil and
danger it is like go to bed on man and get up anoth
i sat up upon my silken couch never had i slept upon such
a bed befor and the first thing that i saw wa good eyeglass
fix on me from the recess of hi silken couch there wa
noth els of him to be seen except hi eyeglass but i knew
from the look of it that he wa awak and wait till i woke
up to begin
i sai quatermain he commenc sure enough did you observ
her skin it is as smooth as the back of an ivori hairbrush
now look here good i remonstr when there came a sound
at the curtain which on be drawn admit a functionari
who signifi by sign that he wa there to lead us to the bath
we gladli consent and were conduct to a delight marbl
chamber with a pool of run crystal water in the centr of
it into which we gaili plung when we had bath we return
to our apart and dress and then went into the central
room where we had sup on the previou even to find a morn
meal alreadi prepar for us and a capit meal it wa though
i should be puzzl to describ the dish after breakfast
we loung round and admir the tapestri and carpet and some
piec of statuari that were place about wonder the while
what wa go to happen next inde by thi time our mind
were in such a state of complet bewilder that we were as
a matter of fact readi for anyth that might arriv as for
our sens of astonish it wa pretti well obliter whilst
we were still thu engag our friend the captain of the guard
present himself and with mani obeis signifi that we
were to follow him which we did not without doubt and heartsearch
for we guess that the time had come when we should have
to settl the bill for those confound hippopotami with our
coldei friend agon the high priest howev there wa no
help for it and person i took great comfort in the promis
of the protect of the sister queen know that if ladi
have a will thei can gener find a wai so off we start
as though we like it a minut walk through a passag and
an outer court brought us to the great doubl gate of the palac
that open on to the wide highwai which run uphil through the
heart of milosi to the templ of the sun a mile awai and thenc
down the slope on the farther side of the templ to the outer
wall of the citi
these gate ar veri larg and massiv and an extraordinarili
beauti work in metal between them for on set is place
at the entranc to an interior and on at that of the exterior
wall is a foss fortyf feet in width thi foss is
fill with water and span by a drawbridg which when lift
make the palac nearli impregn to anyth except sieg
gun as we came on half of the wide gate were flung open
and we pass over the drawbridg and present stood gaze
up on of the most impos if not the most impos roadwai
in the world it is a hundr feet from curb to curb and on
either side not cramp and crowd togeth as is our european
fashion but each stand in it own ground and built equidist
from and in similar style to the rest ar a seri of splendid
singlestori mansion all of red granit these ar the town
hous of the nobl of the court and stretch awai in unbroken
line for a mile or more till the ey is arrest by the gloriou
vision of the templ of the sun that crown the hill and head
the roadwai
as we stood gaze at thi splendid sight of which more anon
there suddenli dash up to the gatewai four chariot each drawn
by two white hors these chariot ar twowheel and made
of wood thei ar fit with a stout pole the weight of which
is support by leathern girth that form a portion of the har
the wheel ar made with four spoke onli ar tire with iron
and quit innoc of spring in the front of the chariot
and immedi over the pole is a small seat for the driver
rail round to prevent him from be jolt off insid the
machin itself ar three low seat on at each side and on
with the back to the hors opposit to which is the door
the whole vehicl is lightli and yet strongli made and ow
to the grace of the curv though primit not half so ugli
as might be expect
but if the chariot left someth to be desir the hors
did not thei were simpli splendid not veri larg but strongli
built and well rib up with small head remark larg
and round hoof and a great look of speed and blood i have
often wonder whenc thi breed which present mani
distinct characterist came but like that of it owner
it histori is obscur like the peopl the hors have alwai
been there the first and last of these chariot were occupi
by guard but the centr two were empti except for the driver
and to these we were conduct alphons and i got into the
first and sir henri good and umslopogaa into the on behind
and then suddenli off we went and we did go among the zuvendi
it is not usual to trot hors either ride or drive especi
when the journei to be made is a short on thei go at full
gallop as soon as we were seat the driver call out the
hors sprang forward and we were whirl awai at a speed suffici
to take on breath and which till i got accustom to it
kept me in momentari fear of an upset as for the wretch alphons
he clung with a despair face to the side of what he call
thi devil of a fiacr think that everi moment wa hi
last present it occur to him to ask where we were go
and i told him that as far as i could ascertain we were go
to be sacrif by burn you should have seen hi face as
he grasp the side of the vehicl and cri out in hi terror
but the wildlook chariot onli leant forward over hi fly
steed and shout and the air as it went sing past bore
awai the sound of alphons lament
and now befor us in all it marvel splendour and dazzl
loveli shone out the templ of the sun the peculiar pride
of the zuvendi to whom it wa what solomon or rather herod
templ wa to the jew the wealth and skill and labour of
gener had been given to the build of thi wonder
place which had been onli final complet within the last
fifti year noth wa spare that the countri could produc
and the result wa inde worthi of the effort not so much on
account of it size for there ar larger fane in the world
as becaus of it perfect proport the rich and beauti
of it materi and the wonder workmanship the build
that stand by itself on a space of some eight acr of garden
ground on the hilltop around which ar the dwellingplac of
the priest is built in the shape of a sunflow with a domecov
central hall from which radiat twelv petalshap court
each dedic to on of the twelv month and serv as the
repositori of statu rear in memori of the illustri dead
the width of the circl beneath the dome is three hundr feet
the height of the dome is four hundr feet and the length of
the rai is on hundr and fifti feet and the height of their
roof three hundr feet so that thei run into the central dome
exactli as the petal of the sunflow run into the great rais
heart thu the exact measur from the centr of the central
altar to the extrem point of ani on of the round rai would
be three hundr feet the width of the circl itself or a
total of six hundr feet from the round extrem of on rai
or petal to the extrem of the opposit on endnot 14
the build itself is of pure and polish white marbl which
show out in marvel contrast to the red granit of the frown
citi on whose brow it glisten inde like an imperi diadem
upon the forehead of a duski queen the outer surfac of the
dome and of the twelv petal court is cover entir with
thin sheet of beaten gold and from the extrem point of the
roof of each of these petal a gloriou golden form with a trumpet
in it hand and widespread wing is figur in the veri act of
soar into space i realli must leav whoever read thi to
imagin the surpass beauti of these golden roof flash
when the sun strike flash like a thousand fire aflam
on a mountain of polish marbl so fierc that the reflect
can be clearli seen from the great peak of the rang a hundr
mile awai
it is a marvel sight thi golden flower upborn upon the
cool white marbl wall and i doubt if the world can show such
anoth what make the whole effect even more gorgeou is that
a belt of a hundr and fifti feet around the marbl wall of
the templ is plant with an indigen speci of sunflow
which were at the time when we first saw them a sheet of golden
bloom
the main entranc to thi wonder place is between the two
northernmost of the rai or petal court and is protect first
by the usual bronz gate and then by door made of solid marbl
beautifulli carv with allegor subject and overlaid with
gold when these ar pass there is onli the thick of the
wall which is howev twentyf feet for the zuvendi build
for all time and anoth slight wall also of white marbl
introduc in order to avoid caus a visibl gap in the inner
skin of the wall and you stand in the circular hall under the
great dome advanc to the central altar you look upon as
beauti a sight as the imagin of man can conceiv you
ar in the middl of the holi place and abov you the great
white marbl dome for the inner skin like the outer is of
polish marbl throughout arch awai in grace curv someth
like that of st paul in london onli at a slighter angl and
from the funnellik open at the exact apex a bright beam
of light pour down upon the golden altar at the east and the
west ar other altar and other beam of light stab the sacr
twilight to the heart in everi direct white mystic wonder
open out the raylik court each pierc through by a singl
arrow of light that serv to illumin it lofti silenc and
dimli to reveal the monument of the dead endnot 15
overcom at so aweinspir a sight the vast loveli of
which thrill the nerv like a glanc from beauti ey you
turn to the central golden altar in the midst of which though
you cannot see it now there burn a pale but steadi flame crown
with curl of faint blue smoke it is of marbl overlaid with
pure gold in shape round like the sun four feet in height
and thirtysix in circumfer here also hing to the foundat
of the altar ar twelv petal of beaten gold all night and
except at on hour all dai also these petal ar close over
the altar itself exactli as the petal of a waterlili close
over the yellow crown in stormi weather but when the sun at
middai pierc through the funnel in the dome and light upon
the golden flower the petal open and reveal the hidden mysteri
onli to close again when the rai ha pass
nor is thi all stand in semicircl at equal distanc
from each other on the north and south of the sacr place ar
ten golden angel or femal wing form exquisit shape
and drape these figur which ar slightli larger than lifes
stand with bent head in an attitud of ador their face
shadow by their wing and ar most impos and of exceed
beauti
there is but on thing further which call for descript
in thi altar which is that to the east the floor in front
of it is not of pure white marbl as elsewher throughout the
build but of solid brass and thi is also the case in front
of the other two altar
the eastern and western altar which ar semicircular in shape
and place against the wall of the build ar much less impos
and ar not enfold in golden petal thei ar howev also
of gold the sacr fire burn on each and a goldenwing figur
stand on either side of them two great golden rai run up
the wall behind them but where the third or middl on should
be is an open in the wall wide on the outsid but narrow
within like a loophol turn inward through the eastern
loophol stream the first beam of the rise sun and strike
right across the circl touch the fold petal of the great
gold flower as thei pass till thei imping upon the western altar
in the same wai at night the last rai of the sink sun rest
for a while on the eastern altar befor thei die awai into dark
it is the promis of the dawn to the even and the even
to the dawn
with the except of those three altar and the wing figur
about them the whole space beneath the vast white dome is utterli
empti and devoid of ornament a circumst that to my
fanci add greatli to it splendour
such is a brief descript of thi wonder and love build
to the glori of which to my mind so much enhanc by their
complet simplic i onli wish i had the power to do justic
but i cannot so it is useless talk more about it but when
i compar thi great work of geniu to some of the tawdri build
and tinsel ornament produc in these latter dai by european
ecclesiast architect i feel that even highli civil
art might learn someth from the zuvendi masterpiec i
can onli sai that the exclam which sprang to my lip as
soon as my ey first becam accustom to the dim light of that
gloriou build and it white and curv beauti perfect
and thrill as those of a nake goddess grew upon me on by
on wa well a dog would feel religi here it is vulgarli
put but perhap it convei my mean more clearli than ani
polish utter
at the templ gate our parti wa receiv by a guard of soldier
who appear to be under the order of a priest and by them
we were conduct into on of the rai or petal court as the
priest call them and there left for at least halfanhour
here we confer togeth and realiz that we stood in great
danger of our live determin if ani attempt should be made
upon us to sell them as dearli as we could umslopogaa announc
hi fix intent of commit sacrileg on the person of
agon the high priest by split hi head with inkosikaa
from where we stood we could perceiv that an immens multitud
were pour into the templ evid in expect of some
unusu event and i could not help fear that we had to do
with it and here i mai explain that everi dai when the sunlight
fall upon the central altar and the trumpet sound a burnt
sacrific is offer to the sun consist gener of the
carcas of a sheep or ox or sometim of fruit or corn thi
event come off about middai of cours not alwai exactli at
that hour but as zuvendi is situat not far from the line
although be so high abov the sea it is veri temper
middai and the fall of the sunlight on the altar were gener
simultan todai the sacrific wa to take place at about
eight minut past twelv
just at twelv oclock a priest appear and made a sign and
the offic of the guard signifi to us that we were expect
to advanc which we did with the best grace that we could muster
all except alphons whose irrepress teeth instantli began
to chatter in a few second we were out of the court and look
at a vast sea of human face stretch awai to the farthest
limit of the great circl all strain to catch a glimps
of the mysteri stranger who had commit sacrileg the
first stranger mind you who to the knowledg of the multitud
had ever set foot in zuvendi sinc such time that the memori
of man runneth not to the contrari
as we appear there wa a murmur through the vast crowd that
went echo awai up the great dome and we saw a visibl blush
of excit grow on the thousand of face like a pink light
on a stretch of pale cloud and a veri curiou effect it wa
on we pass down a lane cut through the heart of the human
mass till present we stood upon the brazen patch of floor
to the east of the central altar and immedi face it
for some thirti feet around the goldenwing figur the space
wa rope off and the multitud stood outsid the rope within
were a circl of whiterob goldcinctur priest hold long
golden trumpet in their hand and immedi in front of us
wa our friend agon the high priest with hi curiou cap upon
hi head hi wa the onli cover head in that vast assemblag
we took our stand upon the brazen space littl know what
wa prepar for us beneath but i notic a curiou hiss
sound proceed appar from the floor for which i could
not account then came a paus and i look around to see if
there wa ani sign of the two queen nyleptha and sorai but
thei were not there to the right of us howev wa a bare
space that i guess wa reserv for them
we wait and present a faroff trumpet blew appar high
up in the dome then came anoth murmur from the multitud
and up a long lane lead to the open space to our right we
saw the two queen walk side by side behind them were some
nobl of the court among whom i recogn the great lord nasta
and behind them again a bodi of about fifti guard these last
i wa veri glad to see present thei had all arriv and taken
their stand the two queen in the front the nobl to the right
and left and the guard in a doubl semicircl behind them
then came anoth silenc and nyleptha look up and caught
my ey it seem to me that there wa mean in her glanc
and i watch it narrowli from my ey it travel down to
the brazen floor on the outer edg of which we stood then
follow a slight and almost impercept sidelong movement
of the head i did not understand it and it wa repeat
then i guess that she meant us to move back off the brazen
floor on more glanc and i wa sure of it there wa danger
in stand on the floor sir henri wa place on on side of
me umslopogaa on the other keep my ey fix straight
befor me i whisper to them first in zulu and then in english
to draw slowli back inch by inch till half their feet were rest
on the marbl floor where the brass ceas sir henri whisper
on to good and alphons and slowli veri veri slowli we shift
backward so slowli that nobodi except nyleptha and sorai
who saw everyth seem to notic the movement then i glanc
again at nyleptha and saw that by an almost impercept nod
she indic approv all the while agon ey were fix
upon the altar befor him appar in an ecstasi of contempl
and mine were fix upon the small of hi back in anoth sort
of ecstasi suddenli he flung up hi long arm and in a solemn
and resound voic commenc a chant of which for conveni
sake i append a rough a veri rough translat here though
of cours i did not then comprehend it mean it wa
an invoc to the sun and ran somewhat as follow
there is silenc upon the face of the earth and the water thereof
yea the silenc doth brood on the water like a nest bird
the silenc sleepeth also upon the bosom of the profound dark
onli high up in the great space star doth speak unto star
the earth is faint with long and wet with the tear of her desir
the stargirdl night doth embrac her but she is not comfort
she li enshroud in mist like a corps in the gravecloth
and stretch her pale hand to the east
lo awai in the farthest east there is the shadow of a light
the earth seeth and lift herself she look out from beneath
the hollow of her hand
then thy great angel fly forth from the holi place oh sun
thei shoot their fieri sword into the dark and shrivel it up
thei climb the heaven and cast down the pale star from their throne
yea thei hurl the chang star back into the womb of the night
thei caus the moon to becom wan as the face of a dy man
and behold thy glori come oh sun
oh thou beauti on thou drapest thyself in fire
the wide heaven ar thy pathwai thou rollest oer them as a chariot
the earth is thy bride thou dost embrac her and
she bring forth children
yea thou favourest her and she yield her increas
thou art the all father and the giver of life oh sun
the young children stretch out their hand and grow in thy bright
the old men creep forth and see rememb their strength
onli the dead forget thee oh sun
when thou art wroth then thou dost hide thy face
thou drawest around thee a thick curtain of shadow
then the earth grow cold and the heaven ar dismai
thei trembl and the sound thereof is the sound of thunder
thei weep and their tear ar outpour in the rain
thei sigh and the wild wind ar the voic of their sigh
the flower die the fruit field languish and turn pale
the old men and the littl children go unto their appoint place
when thou withdrawest thy light oh sun
sai what art thou oh thou matchless splendour
who set thee on high oh thou flame terror
when didst thou begin and when is the dai of thy end
thou art the raiment of the live spirit endnot 16
none did place thee on high for thou wa the begin
thou shalt not be end when thy children ar forgotten
nai thou shalt never end for thy hour ar etern
thou sittest on high within thy golden hous and
measurest out the centuri
oh father of life oh darkdispel sun
he ceas thi solemn chant which though it seem a poor enough
thing after go through my mill is realli beauti and impress
in the origin and then after a moment paus he glanc up
toward the funnelslop open in the dome and ad
oh sun descend upon thine altar
as he spoke a wonder and a beauti thing happen down
from on high flash a splendid live rai of light cleav
the twilight like a sword of fire full upon the close petal
it fell and ran shimmer down their golden side and then
the gloriou flower open as though beneath the bright influenc
slowli it open and as the great petal fell wide and reveal
the golden altar on which the fire ever burn the priest blew
a blast upon the trumpet and from all the peopl there rose
a shout of prais that beat against the dome roof and came echo
down the marbl wall and now the flower altar wa open and
the sunlight fell full upon the tongu of sacr flame and beat
it down so that it waver sank and vanish into the hollow
recess whenc it rose as it vanish the mellow note of
the trumpet roll out onc more again the old priest flung
up hi hand and call aloud
we sacrific to thee oh sun
onc more i caught nyleptha ey it wa fix upon the brazen floor
look out i said aloud and as i said it i saw agon bend
forward and touch someth on the altar as he did so the
great white sea of face around us turn red and then white
again and a deep breath went up like a univers sigh
nyleptha leant forward and with an involuntari movement cover
her ey with her hand sorai turn and whisper to the offic
of the royal bodyguard and then with a rend sound the whole
of the brazen floor slid from befor our feet and there in
it place wa suddenli reveal a smooth marbl shaft termin
in a most aw rage furnac beneath the altar big enough
and hot enough to heat the iron sternpost of a manofwar
with a cry of terror we sprang backward all except the wretch
alphons who wa paralys with fear and would have fallen
into the fieri furnac which had been prepar for us had not
sir henri caught him in hi strong hand as he wa vanish and
drag him back
instantli there aros the most fear hubbub and we four got
back to back alphons dodg frantic round our littl circl
in hi attempt to take shelter under our leg we all had our
revolv on for though we had been polit disarm of our
gun on leav the palac of cours these peopl did not know
what a revolv wa umslopogaa too had hi ax of which
no effort had been made to depriv him and now he whirl it
round hi head and sent hi pierc zulu warshout echo up
the marbl wall in fine defiant fashion next second the priest
baffl of their prei had drawn sword from beneath their white
robe and were leap on us like hound upon a stag at bai
i saw that danger as action might be we must act or be
lost so as the first man came bound along and a great
tall fellow he wa i sent a heavi revolv ball through him
and down he fell at the mouth of the shaft and slid shriek
frantic into the fieri gulf that had been prepar for us
whether it wa hi cri or the to them aw sound and effect
of the pistol shot or what i know not but the other priest
halt paralys and dismai and befor thei could come on
again sorai had call out someth and we togeth with
the two queen and most of the courtier were be surround
with a wall of arm men in a moment it wa done and still
the priest hesit and the peopl hung in the balanc like
a herd of startl buck as it were make no sign on wai or
the other
the last yell of the burn priest had di awai the fire had
finish him and a great silenc fell upon the place
then the high priest agon turn and hi face wa as the face
of a devil let the sacrific be sacrif he cri to the
queen ha not sacrileg enough been done by these stranger
and would ye as queen throw the cloak of your majesti over
evildo ar not the creatur sacr to the sun dead and
is not a priest of the sun also dead but now slain by the magic
of these stranger who come as the wind out of heaven whenc
we know not and who ar what we know not bewar oh queen
how ye tamper with the great majesti of the god even befor
hi high altar there is a power that is more than your power
there is a justic that is higher than your justic bewar
how ye lift an impiou hand against it let the sacrific be
sacrif oh queen
then sorai made answer in her deep quiet tone that alwai
seem to me to have a suspicion of mockeri about them howev
seriou the theme oh agon thou hast spoken accord to thy
desir and thou hast spoken truth but it is thou who wouldst
lift an impiou hand against the justic of thy god bethink
thee the middai sacrific is accomplish the sun hath claim
hi priest as a sacrific
thi wa a novel idea and the peopl applaud it
bethink thee what ar these men thei ar stranger found float
on the bosom of a lake who brought them here how came thei
here how know you that thei also ar not servant of the sun
is thi the hospit that ye would have our nation show to
those whom chanc bring to them to throw them to the flame
shame on you shame on you what is hospit to receiv
the stranger and show him favour to bind up hi wound and
find a pillow for hi head and food for him to eat but thy
pillow is the fieri furnac and thy food the hot savour of the
flame shame on thee i sai
she paus a littl to watch the effect of her speech upon the
multitud and see that it wa favour chang her tone
from on of remonstr to on of command
ho place there she cri place i sai make wai for the
queen and those whom the queen cover with their kaf mantl
and if i refus oh queen said agon between hi teeth
then will i cut a path with my guard wa the proud answer
ay even in the presenc of thy sanctuari and through the bodi
of thy priest
agon turn livid with baffl furi he glanc at the peopl
as though medit an appeal to them but saw clearli that
their sympathi were all the other wai the zuvendi ar a
veri curiou and sociabl peopl and great as wa their sens
of the enorm that we had commit in shoot the sacr
hippopotami thei did not like the idea of the onli real live
stranger thei had seen or heard of be consign to a fieri
furnac therebi put an end for ever to their chanc of extract
knowledg and inform from and gossip about us agon
saw thi and hesit and then for the first time nyleptha
spoke in her soft sweet voic
bethink thee agon she said as my sister queen ha said
these men mai also be servant of the sun for themselv thei
cannot speak for their tongu ar ti let the matter be
adjourn till such time as thei have learnt our languag who
can be condemn without a hear when these men can plead
for themselv then it will be time to put them to the proof
here wa a clever loophol of escap and the vindict old
priest took it littl as he like it
so be it oh queen he said let the men go in peac and
when thei have learnt our tongu then let them speak and i
even i will make humbl supplic at the altar lest pestil
fall on the land by caus of the sacrileg
these word were receiv with a murmur of applaus and in anoth
minut we were march out of the templ surround by the royal
guard
but it wa not till long afterward that we learnt the exact
substanc of what had pass and how hardli our live had been
wrung out of the cruel grip of the zuvendi priesthood in the
face of which even the queen were practic powerless had
it not been for their strenuou effort to protect us we should
have been slain even befor we set foot in the templ of the
sun the attempt to drop us bodili into the fieri pit as an
offer wa a last artific to attain thi end when sever
other quit unsuspect by us had alreadi fail
chapter xv
sorai song
after our escap from agon and hi piou crew we return to
our quarter in the palac and had a veri good time the two
queen the nobl and the peopl vi with each other in do
us honour and shower gift upon us as for that pain littl
incid of the hippopotami it sank into oblivion where we were
quit content to leav it everi dai deput and individu
wait on us to examin our gun and cloth our chain shirt
and our instrument especi our watch with which thei
were much delight in short we becam quit the rage so
much so that some of the fashion young swell among the zuvendi
began to copi the cut of some of our cloth notabl sir henri
shoot jacket on dai inde a deput wait on us
and as usual good don hi fulldress uniform for the occas
thi deput seem somehow to be a differ class to those
who gener came to visit us thei were littl insignific
men of an excess polit not to sai servil demeanour
and their attent appear to be chiefli taken up with observ
the detail of good fulldress uniform of which thei took
copiou note and measur good wa much flatter at the
time not suspect that he had to deal with the six lead
tailor of milosi a fortnight afterward howev when on
attend court as usual he had the pleasur of see some seven
or eight zuvendi masher arrai in all the glori of a veri
fair imit of hi fulldress uniform he chang hi mind
i shall never forget hi face of astonish and disgust
it wa after thi chiefli to avoid remark and also becaus
our cloth were wear out and had to be save up that we
resolv to adopt the nativ dress and a veri comfort on
we found it though i am bound to sai that i look suffici
ridicul in it and as for alphons onli umslopogaa would
have none of these thing when hi moocha wa worn out the fierc
old zulu made him a new on and went about unconcern as grim
and nake as hi own battleax
meanwhil we pursu our studi of the languag steadili and made
veri good progress on the morn follow our adventur in
the templ three grave and reverend signior present themselv
arm with manuscript book inkhorn and feather pen and
indic that thei had been sent to teach us so with the
except of umslopogaa we all buckl to with a will do
four hour a dai as for umslopogaa he would have none of
that either he did not wish to learn that woman talk not
he and when on of the teacher advanc on him with a book
and an inkhorn and wave them befor him in a mild persuas
wai much as a churchwarden invitingli shake the offertori bag
under the nose of a rich but niggardli parishion he sprang
up with a fierc oath and flash inkosikaa befor the ey
of our learn friend and there wa an end of the attempt to
teach him zuvendi
thu we spent our morn in us occup which grew more
and more interest as we proceed and the afternoon were
given up to recreat sometim we made trip notabl on
to the gold mine and anoth to the marbl quarri both of
which i wish i had space and time to describ and sometim
we went out hunt buck with dog train for that purpos
and a veri excit sport it is as the countri is full of agricultur
enclosur and our hors were magnific thi is not to be
wonder at see that the royal stabl were at our command
in addit to which we had four splendid saddl hors given
to us by nyleptha
sometim again we went hawk a pastim that is in great
favour among the zuvendi who gener fly their bird at a
speci of partridg which is remark for the swift and
strength of it flight when attack by the hawk thi bird
appear to lose it head and instead of seek cover fli
high into the sky thu offer wonder sport i have seen
on of these partridg soar up almost out of sight when follow
by the hawk still better sport is offer by a varieti of solitari
snipe as big as a small woodcock which is plenti in thi
countri and which is flown at with a veri small agil and
highlytrain hawk with an almost red tail the zigzag
of the great snipe and the lightn rapid of the flight and
movement of the redtail hawk make the pastim a delight
on anoth varieti of the same amus is the hunt of
a veri small speci of antelop with train eagl and it
certainli is a marvel sight to see the great bird soar and
soar till he is noth but a black speck in the sunlight and
then suddenli come dash down like a cannonbal upon some
cower buck that is hidden in a patch of grass from everyth
but that pierc ey still finer is the spectacl when the
eagl take the buck run
on other dai we would pai visit to the countri seat at some
of the great lord beauti fortifi place and the villag
cluster beneath their wall here we saw vineyard and cornfield
and wellkept parklik ground with such timber in them as
fill me with delight for i do love a good tree there it
stand so strong and sturdi and yet so beauti a veri type
of the best sort of man how proudli it lift it bare head
to the winter storm and with what a full heart it rejoic
when the spring ha come again how grand it voic is too
when it talk with the wind a thousand aeolian harp cannot
equal the beauti of the sigh of a great tree in leaf all
dai it point to the sunshin and all night to the star and
thu passionless and yet full of life it endur through the
centuri come storm come shine draw it susten from
the cool bosom of it mother earth and as the slow year roll
by learn the great mysteri of growth and of decai and
so on and on through gener outliv individu custom
dynasti all save the landscap it adorn and human natur
till the appoint dai when the wind win the long battl
and rejoic over a reclaim space or decai put the last stroke
to hi fungusfing work
ah on should alwai think twice befor on cut down a tree
in the even it wa customari for sir henri good and myself
to dine or rather sup with their majesti not everi night
inde but about three or four time a week whenev thei had
not much compani or the affair of state would allow of it
and i am bound to sai that those littl supper were quit the
most charm thing of their sort that i ever had to do with
how true is the sai that the veri highest in rank ar alwai
the most simpl and kindli it is from your halfandhalf sort
of peopl that you get pompos and vulgar the differ
between the two be veri much what on see everi dai in
england between the old outatelbow brokendown counti famili
and the overbear purseproud peopl who come and take the
place i realli think that nyleptha greatest charm is her
sweet simplic and her kindli genuin interest even in littl
thing she is the simplest woman i ever knew and where her
passion ar not involv on of the sweetest but she can look
queenli enough when she like and be as fierc as ani savag too
for instanc never shall i forget that scene when i for the
first time wa sure that she wa realli in love with curti
it came about in thi wai all through good weak for
ladi societi when we had been emploi for some three month
in learn zuvendi it struck master good that he wa get
rather tire of the old gentlemen who did us the honour to lead
us in the wai that we should go so he proceed without sai
a word to anybodi els to inform them that it wa a peculiar
fact but that we could not make ani real progress in the deeper
intricaci of a foreign languag unless we were taught by ladi
young ladi he wa care to explain in hi own countri
he point out it wa habitu to choos the veri bestlook
and most charm girl who could be found to instruct ani stranger
who happen to come that wai etc
all of thi the old gentlemen swallow openmouth there
wa thei admit reason in what he said sinc the contempl
of the beauti as their philosophi taught induc a certain
poros of mind similar to that produc upon the physic bodi
by the health influenc of sun and air consequ it
wa probabl that we might absorb the zuvendi tongu a littl
faster if suitabl teacher could be found anoth thing wa
that as the femal sex wa natur loquaci good practic
would be gain in the viva voce depart of our studi
to all of thi good grave assent and the learn gentlemen
depart assur him that their order were to fall in with
our wish in everi wai and that if possibl our view should
be met
imagin therefor the surpris and disgust of myself and i
trust and believ sir henri when on enter the room where
we were accustom to carri on our studi the follow morn
we found instead of our usual vener tutor three of the
bestlook young women whom milosi could produc and that
is sai a good deal who blush and smile and curtsei
and gave us to understand that thei were there to carri on our
instruct then good as we gaze at on anoth in bewilder
thought fit to explain sai that it had slip hi memori
befor but the old gentlemen had told him on the previou
even that it wa absolut necessari that our further educ
should be carri on by the other sex i wa overwhelm and
appeal to sir henri for advic in such a crisi
well he said you see the ladi ar here aint thei if
we sent them awai dont you think it might hurt their feel
eh on doesnt like to be rough you see and thei look regular
blue dont thei eh
by thi time good had alreadi begun hi lesson with the handsomest
of the three and so with a sigh i yield that dai everyth
went veri well the young ladi were certainli veri clever
and thei onli smile when we blunder i never saw good so
attent to hi book befor and even sir henri appear to
tackl zuvendi with a renew zest ah thought i will
it alwai be thu
next dai we were much more live our work wa pleasingli interspers
with question about our nativ countri what the ladi were
like there etc all of which we answer as best as we could
in zuvendi and i heard good assur hi teacher that her loveli
wa to the beauti of europ as the sun to the moon to which
she repli with a littl toss of the head that she wa a plain
teach woman and noth els and that it wa not kind to
deceiv a poor girl so then we had a littl sing that wa
realli charm so natur and unaffect the zuvendi lovesong
ar most touch on the third dai we were all quit intim
good narrat some of hi previou love affair to hi fair
teacher and so move wa she that her sigh mingl with hi
own i discours with mine a merri blueei girl upon zuvendian
art and never saw that she wa wait for an opportun to
drop a specimen of the cockroach tribe down my back whilst in
the corner sir henri and hi gover appear so far as i
could judg to be go through a lesson frame on the great
educ principl laid down by wackford squeer esq though
in a veri modifi or rather spiritu form the ladi softli
repeat the zuvendi word for hand and he took her ey
and he gaze deep into her brown orb lip and but just
at that moment my young ladi drop the cockroach down my back
and ran awai laugh now if there is on thing i loath more
than anoth it is cockroach and move quit beyond myself
and yet laugh at her impud i took up the cushion she
had been sit on and threw it after her imagin then my
shame my horror and my distress when the door open
and attend by two guard onli in walk nyleptha the cushion
could not be recal it miss the girl and hit on of the
guard on the head but i instantli and ineffectu tri
to look as though i had not thrown it good ceas hi sigh
and began to murder zuvendi at the top of hi voic and sir
henri whistl and look silli as for the poor girl thei
were utterli dumbfound
and nyleptha she drew herself up till her frame seem to tower
even abov that of the tall guard and her face went first red
and then pale as death
guard she said in a quiet choke voic and point at the fair
but unconsci discipl of wackford squeer slai me that woman
the men hesit as well thei might
will ye do my bid she said again in the same voic
or will ye not
then thei advanc upon the girl with uplift spear
by thi time sir henri had recov himself and saw that
the comedi wa like to turn into a tragedi
stand back he said in a voic of thunder at the same time
get in front of the terrifi girl shame on thee
nyleptha shame thou shalt not kill her
doubtless thou hast good reason to try to protect her
thou couldst hardli do less in honour answer the
infuri queen but she shall die she shall die
and she stamp her littl foot
it is well he answer then will i die with her i am thy
servant oh queen do with me even as thou wilt and he bow
toward her and fix hi clear ey contemptu on her face
i could wish to slai thee too she answer for thou dost
make a mock of me and then feel that she wa master and
i suppos not know what els to do she burst into such a
storm of tear and look so royal love in her passion
distress that old as i am i must sai i envi curti hi task
of support her it wa rather odd to see him hold her
in hi arm consid what had just pass a thought that
seem to occur to herself for present she wrench herself
free and went leav us all much disturb
present howev on of the guard return with a messag
to the girl that thei were on pain of death to leav the citi
and return to their home in the countri and that no further
harm would come to them and accordingli thei went on of them
remark philosoph that it could not be help and that
it wa a satisfact to know that thei had taught us a littl
servic zuvendi mine wa an exceedingli nice girl and
overlook the cockroach i made her a present of my favourit
lucki sixpenc with a hole in it when she went awai after that
our former master resum their cours of instruct needless
to sai to my great relief
that night when in fear and trembl we attend the royal
supper tabl we found that nyleptha wa laid up with a bad headach
that headach last for three whole dai but on the fourth
she wa present at supper as usual and with the most graciou
and sweet smile gave sir henri her hand to lead her to the tabl
no allus wa made to the littl affair describ abov beyond
her sai with a charm air of innoc that when she came
to see us at our studi the other dai she had been seiz with
a giddi from which she had onli now recov she suppos
she ad with a touch of the humour that wa common to her
that it wa the sight of peopl work so hard which had affect her
in repli sir henri said dryli that he had thought she did not
look quit herself on that dai whereat she flash on of those
quick glanc of her at him which if he had the feel of
a man must have gone through him like a knife and the subject
drop entir inde after supper wa over nyleptha condescend
to put us through an examin to see what we had learnt and
to express herself well satisfi with the result inde
she proceed to give us especi sir henri a lesson on her
own account and veri interest we found it
and all the while that we talk or rather tri to talk and
laugh sorai would sit there in her carven ivori chair and
look at us and read us all like a book onli from time to time
sai a few word and smile that quick omin smile of her
which wa more like a flash of summer lightn on a dark cloud
than anyth els and as near to her as he dare would sit
good worship through hi eyeglass for he realli wa get
serious devot to thi sombr beauti of whom speak person
i felt terribl afraid i watch her keenli and soon i found
out that for all her appar impass she wa at heart
bitterli jealou of nyleptha anoth thing i found out and
the discoveri fill me with dismai and that wa that she also
wa grow devot to sir henri curti of cours i could not
be sure it is not easi to read so cold and haughti a woman
but i notic on or two littl thing and as eleph hunter
know dri grass show which wai the wind ha set
and so anoth three month pass over us by which time we
had all attain to a veri consider masteri of the zuvendi
languag which is an easi on to learn and as the time went
on we becam great favourit with the peopl and even with
the courtier gain an enorm reput for clever
becaus as i think i have said sir henri wa abl to show them
how to make glass which wa a nation want and also by the
help of a twentyyear almanac that we had with us to predict
variou heavenli combin which were quit unsuspect by
the nativ astronom we even succeed in demonstr the
principl of the steamengin to a gather of the learn men
who were fill with amaz and sever other thing of the
same sort we did and so it came about that the peopl made
up their mind that we must on no account be allow to go out
of the countri which inde wa an appar imposs even
if we had wish it and we were advanc to great honour and
made offic to the bodyguard of the sister queen while perman
quarter were assign to us in the palac and our opinion wa
ask upon question of nation polici
but blue as the sky seem there wa a cloud and a big on
on the horizon we had inde heard no more of those confound
hippopotami but it is not on that account to be suppos that
our sacrileg wa forgotten or the enmiti of the great and power
priesthood head by agon appeas on the contrari it wa
burn the more fierc becaus it wa necessarili suppress
and what had perhap begun in bigotri wa end in downright
direct hatr born of jealousi hitherto the priest had been
the wise men of the land and were on thi account as well as
from superstiti caus look on with peculiar vener
but our arriv with our outlandish wisdom and our strang
invent and hint of unimagin thing dealt a seriou blow
to thi state of affair and among the educ zuvendi went
far toward destroi the priestli prestig a still wors
affront to them howev wa the favour with which we were regard
and the trust that wa repos in us all these thing tend
to make us excess obnoxi to the great sacerdot clan
the most power becaus the most unit faction in the kingdom
anoth sourc of immin danger to us wa the rise envi of
some of the great lord head by nasta whose antagon to
us had at best been but thinli veil and which now threaten
to break out into open flame nasta had for some year been
a candid for nyleptha hand in marriag and when we appear
on the scene i fanci from all i could gather that though there
were still mani obstacl in hi path success wa by no mean
out of hi reach but now all thi had chang the coi nyleptha
smile no more in hi direct and he wa not slow to guess
the caus infuri and alarm he turn hi attent to
sorai onli to find that he might as well try to woo a mountain
side with a bitter jest or two about hi fickl that door
wa close on him for ever so nasta bethought himself of the
thirti thousand wild swordsmen who would pour down at hi bid
through the northern mountain pass and no doubt vow to adorn
the gate of milosi with our head
but first he determin as i learn to make on more attempt
and to demand the hand of nyleptha in the open court after the
formal annual ceremoni of the sign of the law that had been
proclaim by the queen dure the year
of thi astound fact nyleptha heard with simul nonchal
and with a littl trembl of the voic herself inform us
of it as we sat at supper on the night preced the great ceremoni
of the lawgiv
sir henri bit hi lip and do what he could to prevent it plainli
show hi agit

shoulder nai i know not what is a poor woman to do when

tone
the time went on in anoth quarter of an hour i knew that
accord to their habit the queen would retir as yet sir
henri had had no chanc of sai a word in privat inde
though we saw much of the royal sister it wa by no mean easi
to see them alon i rack my brain and at last an idea came
to me

to us oh ladi of the night sorai favourit name among the
peopl
my song macumazahn ar not such as to lighten the heavi heart
yet will i sing if it pleas thee she answer and she rose
and went a few pace to a tabl whereon lai an instrument not
unlik a zither and struck a few wander chord
then suddenli like the note of some deepthroat bird her
round voic rang out in song so wildli sweet and yet with
so eeri and sad a refrain that it made the veri blood stand
still up up soar the golden note that seem to melt far
awai and then to grow again and travel on laden with all the
sorrow of the world and all the despair of the lost it wa
a marvel song but i had not time to listen to it properli
howev i got the word of it afterward and here is a translat
of it burden so far as it admit of be translat at all
sorai song
as a desol bird that through dark it lost wai is wing
as a hand that is helplessli rais when death sickl is swing
so is life ay the life that lend passion and breath to my sing
as the nightingal song that is full of a sweet unspoken
as a spirit unbar the gate of the ski for a token
so is love ay the love that shall fall when hi pinion is broken
as the tramp of the legion when trumpet their challeng ar send
as the shout of the stormgod when lightn the black sky ar rend
so is power ay the power that shall lie in the dust at it end
so short is our life yet with space for all thing to forsak us
a bitter delus a dream from which nought can awak us
till death dog footstep at morn or at ev shall oertak us
refrain
oh the world is fair at the dawn dawn dawn
but the red sun sink in blood the red sun sink in blood
i onli wish that i could write down the music too
now curti now i whisper when she began the second vers
and turn my back
nyleptha he said for my nerv were so much on the stretch

chapter xvi
befor the statu
it wa night dead night and the silenc lai on the
frown citi like a cloud
secretli as evildo sir henri curti umslopogaa and myself
thread our wai through the passag toward a byentranc to
the great throne chamber onc we were met by the fierc rattl
challeng of the sentri i gave the countersign and the man
ground hi spear and let us pass also we were offic of
the queen bodyguard and in that capac had a right to come
and go unquest
we gain the hall in safeti so empti and so still wa it
that even when we had pass the sound of our footstep yet echo
up the lofti wall vibrat faintli and still more faintli
against the carven roof like ghost of the footstep of dead
men haunt the place that onc thei trod
it wa an eeri spot and it oppress me the moon wa full
and threw great pencil and patch of light through the high
windowless open in the wall that lai pure and beauti
upon the black of the marbl floor like white flower on
a coffin on of these silver arrow fell upon the statu of
the sleep radema and of the angel form bent over him illumin
it and a small circl round it with a soft clear light remind
me of that with which cathol illumin the altar of their
cathedr
here by the statu we took our stand and wait sir henri
and i close togeth umslopogaa some pace off in the dark
so that i could onli just make out hi tower outlin lean
on the outlin of an ax
so long did we wait that i almost fell asleep rest against
the cold marbl but wa suddenli arous by hear curti give
a quick catch breath then from far awai there came a littl
sound as though the statu that line the wall were whisper
to each other some messag of the ag
it wa the faint sweep of a ladi dress nearer it grew and
nearer yet we could see a figur steal from patch to patch
of moonlight and even hear the soft fall of sandal feet
anoth second and i saw the black silhouett of the old zulu
rais it arm in mute salut and nyleptha wa befor us
oh how beauti she look as she paus a moment just within
the circl of the moonlight her hand wa press upon her heart
and her white bosom heav beneath it round her head a broider
scarf wa loos thrown partial shadow the perfect face
and thu render it even more love for beauti depend
as it is to a certain extent upon the imagin is never so
beauti as when it is half hid there she stood radiant but
half doubt state and yet so sweet it wa but a moment
but i then and there fell in love with her myself and have remain
so to thi hour for inde she look more like an angel out
of heaven than a love passion mortal woman low we bow
befor her and then she spoke
i have come she whisper but it wa at great risk ye
know not how i am watch the priest watch me sorai watch
me with those great ey of her my veri guard ar spi upon
me nasta watch me too oh let him be care and she
stamp her foot let him be care i am a woman and therefor
hard to drive ay and i am a queen too and can still aveng
let him be care i sai lest in place of give him my hand
i take hi head and she end the outburst with a littl sob
and then smile up at us bewitchingli and laugh
thou didst bid me come hither my lord incubu curti had taught
her to call him so doubtless it is about busi of the
state for i know that thou art ever full of great idea and
plan for my welfar and my peopl so even as a queen should
i have come though i greatli fear the dark alon and again
she laugh and gave him a glanc from her grei ey
at thi point i thought it wise to move a littl sinc secret
of the state should not be made public properti but she would
not let me go far peremptorili stop me within five yard
or so sai that she fear surpris so it came to pass that
howev unwillingli i heard all that pass
thou knowest nyleptha said sir henri that it wa for none
of these thing that i ask thee to meet me at thi lone place
nyleptha wast not the time in pleasantri but listen to me
for i love thee
as he said the word i saw her face break up as it were and
chang the coquetri went out of it and in it place there
shone a great light of love which seem to glorifi it and make
it like that of the marbl angel overhead i could not help
think that it must have been a touch of prophet instinct
which made the long dead radema limn in the featur of the
angel of hi inspir vision so strang a like of hi own
descend sir henri also must have observ and been struck
by the like for catch the look upon nyleptha face
he glanc quickli from it to the moonlit statu and then back
again at hi belov
thou sayest thou dost love me she said in a low voic and
thy voic ring true but how am i to know that thou dost speak
the truth
though she went on with proud humil and in the state
third person which is so larg us by the zuvendi i be
as noth in the ey of my lord and she curtsei toward
him who come from among a wonder peopl to whom my peopl
ar but children yet here am i a queen and a leader of men
and if i would go to battl a hundr thousand spear shall sparkl
in my train like star glimmer down the path of the bent moon
and although my beauti be a littl thing in the ey of my lord
and she lift her broider skirt and curtsei again yet
here among my own peopl am i held right fair and ever sinc
i wa a woman the great lord of my kingdom have made quarrel
concern me as though forsooth she ad with a flash of
passion i were a deer to be pull down by the hungriest wolf
or a hors to be sold to the highest bidder let my lord pardon
me if i weari my lord but it hath pleas my lord to sai that
he love me nyleptha a queen of the zuvendi and therefor
would i sai that though my love and my hand be not much to my
lord yet to me ar thei all
oh she cri with a sudden and thrill chang of voic
and modifi her dignifi mode of address oh how can i
know that thou lovest but me how can i know that thou wilt
not weari of me and seek thine own place again leav me desol
who is there to tell me but that thou lovest some other woman
some fair woman unknown to me but who yet draw breath beneath
thi same moon that shine on me tonight tell me how am i to
know and she clasp her hand and stretch them out toward
him and look appealingli into hi face
nyleptha answer sir henri adopt the zuvendi wai of
speech i have told thee that i love thee how am i to tell
thee how much i love thee is there then a measur for love
yet will i try i sai not that i have never look upon anoth
woman with favour but thi i sai that i love thee with all my
life and with all my strength that i love thee now and shall
love thee till i grow cold in death ay and as i believ beyond
my death and on and on for ever i sai that thy voic is music
to my ear and thy touch as water to a thirsti land that when
thou art there the world is beauti and when i see thee not
it is as though the light wa dead oh nyleptha i will never
leav thee here and now for thy dear sake i will forget my peopl
and my father hous yea i renounc them all by thy side
will i live nyleptha and at thy side will i die
he paus and gaze at her earnestli but she hung her head like
a lili and said never a word
look he went on point to the statu on which the moonlight
plai so brightli thou seest that angel woman who rest her
hand upon the forehead of the sleep man and thou seest how
at her touch hi soul flame up and shine out through hi flesh
even as a lamp at the touch of the fire so is it with me and
thee nyleptha thou hast awaken my soul and call it forth
and now nyleptha it is not mine not mine but thine and thine
onli there is no more for me to sai in thy hand is my life
and he lean back against the pedest of the statu look
veri pale and hi ey shine but proud and handsom as a god
slowli slowli she rais her head and fix her wonder ey
all alight with the great of her passion full upon hi face
as though to read hi veri soul then at last she spoke low
inde but clearli as a silver bell
of a truth weak woman that i am i do believ thee ill will
be the dai for thee and for me also if it be my fate to learn
that i have believ a lie and now hearken to me oh man who
hath wander here from far to steal my heart and make me all

lip have never kiss befor do kiss thee on the brow and
now by my hand and by that first and holi kiss ay by my peopl

etern majesti of the sun i swear that for thee will i live
and die and i swear that i will love thee and thee onli till

that thy will shall be my will and thy wai my wai
oh see see my lord thou knowest not how humbl is she who
love i who am a queen i kneel befor thee even at thy feet
i do my homag and the love impass creatur flung herself
down on her knee on the cold marbl befor him and after that
i realli do not know for i could stand it no longer and clear
off to refresh myself with a littl of old umslopogaa societi
leav them to settl it their own wai and a veri long time
thei were about it
i found the old warrior lean on inkosikaa as usual and
survei the scene in the patch of moonlight with a grim smile
of amus
ah macumazahn he said i suppos it is becaus i am get
old but i dont think that i shall ever learn to understand
the wai of you white peopl look there now i prai thee thei
ar a pretti pair of dove but what is all the fuss about macumazahn
he want a wife and she want a husband then why doe he not
pai hi cow down endnot 17 like a man and have done with
it it would save a deal of troubl and we should have had
our night sleep but there thei go talk talk talk and
kiss kiss kiss like mad thing eugh
some threequart of an hour afterward the pair of dove
came stroll toward us curti look slightli silli and
nyleptha remark calmli that the moonlight made veri pretti
effect on the marbl then for she wa in a most graciou
mood she took my hand and said that i wa her lord dear
friend and therefor most dear to her not a word for my own
sake you see next she lift umslopogaa ax and examin
it curious sai significantli as she did so that he might
soon have caus to us it in defenc of her
after that she nod prettili to us all and cast a
tender glanc at her lover glide off into the dark
like a beauti vision
when we got back to our quarter which we did without accid
curti ask me jocularli what i wa think about
i am wonder i answer on what principl it is arrang
that some peopl should find beauti queen to fall in love
with them while other find nobodi at all or wors than nobodi
and i am also wonder how mani brave men live thi night
work will cost it wa rather nasti of me perhap but somehow
all the feel do not evapor with ag and i could not help
be a littl jealou of my old friend luck vaniti my son
vaniti of vaniti
on the follow morn good wa inform of the happi occurr
and posit rippl with smile that origin somewher
about the mouth slowli travel up hi face like the ring
in a duckpond till thei flow over the brim of hi eyeglass
and went where sweet smile go the fact of the matter howev
wa that not onli wa good rejoic about the thing on it own
merit but also for person reason he ador sorai quit
as earnestli as sir henri ador nyleptha and hi ador
had not altogeth prosper inde it had seem to him and
to me also that the dark cleopatralik queen favour curti
in her own curiou inscrut wai much more than good therefor
it wa a relief to him to learn that hi unconsci rival wa
perman and satisfactorili attach in anoth direct
hi face fell a littl howev when he wa told that the whole
thing wa to be kept as secret as the dead abov all from sorai
for the present inasmuch as the polit convuls which would
follow such an announc at the moment would be altogeth
too great to face and would veri possibl if prematur made
shake nyleptha from her throne
that morn we again attend in the throne hall and i could
not help smile to myself when i compar the visit to our last
and reflect that if wall could speak thei would have strang
tale to tell
what actress women ar there high upon her golden throne
drape in her blazon kaf or robe of state sat the fair nyleptha
and when sir henri came in a littl late dress in the full
uniform of an offic of her guard and humbl bent himself befor
her she mere acknowledg hi salut with a careless nod and
turn her head coldli asid it wa a veri larg court for
not onli did the sign of the law attract mani outsid of
those whose duti it wa to attend but also the rumour that nasta
wa go to publicli ask the hand of nyleptha in marriag had
gone abroad with the result that the great hall wa crowd
to it utmost capac there were our friend the priest in
forc head by agon who regard us with a vindict ey
and a most impos band thei were with their long white embroid
robe girt with a golden chain from which hung the fishlik
scale there too were a number of the lord each with a
band of brilliantli attir attend and promin among them
wa nasta stroke hi black beard medit and look
unusu pleasant it wa a splendid and impress sight
especi when the offic after have read out each law hand
them to the queen to sign whereon the trumpet blare out and
the queen guard ground their spear with a crash in salut
thi read and sign of the law took a long time but at
length it came to an end the last on recit that wherea
distinguish stranger etc and proceed to confer on the
three of us the rank of lord togeth with certain militari
command and larg estat bestow by the queen when it wa
read the trumpet blare and the spear clash down as usual
but i saw some of the lord turn and whisper to each other while
nasta ground hi teeth thei did not like the favour that wa
shown to us which under all the circumst wa not perhap
unnatur
then there came a paus and nasta step forward and bow
humbl though with no humil in hi ey crave a boon at
the hand of the queen nyleptha
nyleptha turn a littl pale but bow gracious and prai
the wellbelov lord to speak on whereon in a few
straightforward soldierlik word he ask her hand in marriag
then befor she could find word to answer the high priest
agon took up the tale and in a speech of real eloqu and
power point out the mani advantag of the propos allianc
how it would consolid the kingdom for nasta dominion
of which he wa virtual king were to zuvendi much what scotland
us to be to england how it would gratifi the wild mountain
and be popular among the soldieri for nasta wa a famou gener
how it would set her dynasti firmli on the throne and would
gain the bless and approv of the sun ie of the offic
of the high priest and so on mani of hi argument were undoubtedli
valid and there wa look at it from a polit point of
view everyth to be said for the marriag but unfortun
it is difficult to plai the game of polit with the person
of young and love queen as though thei were ivori effigi
of themselv on a chessboard nyleptha face while agon spout
awai wa a perfect studi she smile inde but beneath the
smile it set like a stone and her ey began to flash omin
at last he stop and she prepar herself to answer befor
she did so howev sorai leant toward her and said in a voic
suffici loud for me to catch what she said bethink thee
well my sister er thou dost speak for methink that our throne
mai hang upon thy word
nyleptha made no answer and with a shrug and a smile sorai
leant back again and listen
of a truth a great honour ha been done to me she said that
my poor hand should not onli have been ask in marriag but
that agon here should be so swift to pronounc the bless of
the sun upon my union methink that in anoth minut he would
have wed us fast er the bride had said her sai nasta i thank
thee and i will bethink me of thy word but now as yet i have
no mind for marriag that is a cup of which none know the tast
until thei begin to drink it again i thank thee nasta and
she made as though she would rise
the great lord face turn almost as black as hi beard with
furi for he knew that the word amount to a final refus
of hi suit
thank be to the queen for her graciou word he said restrain
himself with difficulti and look anyth but grate my
heart shall sure treasur them and now i crave anoth boon
name the royal leav to withdraw myself to my own poor citi
in the north till such time as the queen shall sai my suit nai
or yea mayhap he ad with a sneer the queen will be
pleas to visit me there and to bring with her these stranger
lord and he scowl darkli toward us it is but a poor
countri and a rough but we ar a hardi race of mountain
and there shall be gather thirti thousand swordsmen to shout
a welcom to her
thi speech which wa almost a declar of rebellion wa
receiv in complet silenc but nyleptha flush up and answer
it with spirit
oh sure nasta i will come and the strang lord in my
train and for everi man of thy mountain who call thee princ
will i bring two from the lowland who call me queen and we
will see which is the staunchest breed till then farewel
the trumpet blare out the queen rose and the great assembl
broke up in murmur confus and for myself i went home with
a heavi heart forese civil war
after thi there wa quiet for a few week curti and the queen
did not often meet and exercis the utmost caution not to allow
the true relat in which thei stood to each other to leak out
but do what thei would rumour as hard to trace as a buzz
fly in a dark room and yet quit as audibl began to hum
round and round and at last to settl on her throne
chapter xvii
the storm break
and now it wa that the troubl which at first had been but a
cloud as larg as a man hand began to loom veri black and big
upon our horizon name sorai prefer for sir henri
i saw the storm draw nearer and nearer and so poor fellow
did he the affect of so love and highlyplac a woman
wa not a thing that could in a gener wai be consid a calam
by ani man but situat as curti wa it wa a grievou burden
to bear
to begin with nyleptha though altogeth charm wa it must
be admit of a rather jealou disposit and wa sometim
apt to visit on her lover head her indign at the mark
of what alphons would have call the distinguish consider
with which her royal sister favour him then the enforc
secreci of hi relat to nyleptha prevent curti from take
some opportun of put a stop or try to put a stop
to thi fals condit of affair by tell sorai in a casual
but confidenti wai that he wa go to marri her sister
a third sting in sir henri honei wa that he knew that good
wa honestli and sincer attach to the ominouslook but
most attract ladi of the night inde poor bougwan wa
wast himself to a shadow of hi fat and jolli self about her
hi face get so thin that hi eyeglass would scarc stick
in it while she with a sort of careless coquetri just gave
him encourag enough to keep him go think no doubt
that he might be us as a stalkinghors i tri to give
him a hint in as delic a wai as i could but he flew into
a huff and would not listen to me so i wa determin to let
ill along for fear of make it wors poor good he realli
wa veri ludicr in hi distress and went in for all sort
of absurd under the belief that he wa advanc hi suit
on of them wa the write with the assist of on of
the grave and rever signior who instruct us and who whatev
mai have been the measur of hi erudit did not understand
how to scan a line of a most intermin zuvendi lovesong
of which the continu recur refrain wa someth about
i will kiss thee oh ye i will kiss thee now among the
zuvendi it is a common and most harmless thing for young men
to serenad ladi at night as i believ thei do in the southern
countri of europ and sing all sort of nonsens song
to them the young men mai or mai not be seriou but no offenc
is meant and none is taken even by ladi of the highest rank
who accept the whole thing as an english girl would a
gracefullyturn compliment
avail himself of thi custom good bethought him that would
serenad sorai whose privat apart togeth with those
of her maiden were exactli opposit our own on the further
side of a narrow courtyard which divid on section of the great
palac from anoth accordingli have arm himself with
a nativ zither on which be an adept with the light guitar
he had easili learn to strum he proceed at midnight the
fashion hour for thi sort of caterwaul to make night
hideou with hi amor yell i wa fast asleep when thei
began but thei soon woke me up for good possess a tremend
voic and ha no notion of time and i ran to my windowplac
to see what wa the matter and there stand in the full
moonlight in the courtyard i perceiv good adorn with an
enorm ostrich feather headdress and a flow silken cloak
which it is the right thing to wear upon these occas and
shout out the abomin song which he and the old gentleman
had evolv to a jerki jingl accompani from the direct
of the quarter of the maid of honour came a success of faint
snigger but the apart of sorai herself whom i devoutli
piti if she happen to be there were silent as the grave
there wa absolut no end to that aw song with it etern
i will kiss thee and at last neither i nor sir henri whom
i had summon to enjoi the sight could stand it ani longer
so rememb the dear old stori i put my head to the window
open and shout for heaven sake good dont go on talk
about it but kiss her and let all go to sleep that choke
him off and we had no more serenad
the whole thing form a laughabl incid in a tragic busi
how deepli thank we ought to be that even the most seriou
matter have gener a silver line about them in the shape
of a joke if onli peopl could see it the sens of humour
is a veri valuabl possess in life and ought to be cultiv
in the board school especi in scotland
well the more sir henri held off the more sorai came on as
is not uncommon in such case till at last thing got veri queer
inde evid she wa by some strang pervers of mind
quit blind to the true state of the case and i for on
greatli dread the moment of her awaken sorai wa a danger
woman to be mix up with either with or without on consent
at last the evil moment came as i saw it must come on fine
dai good have gone out hawk sir henri and i were sit

a white flower in her black hair and i tri to keep my ey
on it and count the petal but it wa of no us at last whether
it wa her gaze or the perfum in her hair or what i do not

the man look startl but he mere said the queen word
be done and depart then nyleptha sent a messeng to sir
henri and present he arriv look uncommonli uncomfort
i thought that anoth outburst wa about to follow but wonder
ar the wai of woman she said not a word about sorai and hi
suppos inconst greet him with a friendli nod and state
simpli that she requir hi advic upon high matter all the
same there wa a look in her ey and a sort of suppress energi
in her manner toward him that make me think that she had not
forgotten the affair but wa keep it for a privat occas
just after curti arriv the offic return and report
that sorai wa gone the bird had flown to the templ state
that she wa go as wa sometim the custom among zuvendi
ladi of rank to spend the night in medit befor the altar
we look at each other significantli the blow had fallen
veri soon
then we set to work
gener who could be trust were summon from their quarter
and as much of the state affair as wa thought desir wa
told to each strict injunct be given to them to get all
their avail forc togeth the same wa done with such
of the more power lord as nyleptha knew she could reli on
sever of whom left that veri dai for distant part of the countri
to gather up their tribesmen and retain seal order were
dispatch to the ruler of faroff citi and some twenti messeng
were sent off befor nightfal with instruct to ride earli
and late till thei reach the distant chief to whom their letter
were address also mani spi were set to work all the afternoon
and even we labour assist by some confidenti scribe
nyleptha show an energi and resourc of mind that astonish
me and it wa eight oclock befor we got back to our quarter
here we heard from alphons who wa deepli aggriev becaus
our nonreturn had spoilt hi dinner for he had turn cook
again now that good had come back from hi hawk and gone
on duti as instruct had alreadi been given to the offic
of the outer guard to doubl the sentri at the gate and as
we had no reason to fear ani immedi danger we did not think
it worth while to hunt him up and tell him anyth of what had
pass which at best wa under the peculiar circumst of
the case on of those task that on prefer to postpon so
after swallow our food we turn in to get some muchneed
rest befor we did so howev it occur to curti to tell
old umslopogaa to keep a lookout in the neighbourhood of nyleptha
privat apart umslopogaa wa now well known about the
place and by the queen order allow to pass whither he would
by the guard a permiss of which he often avail himself
by roam about the palac dure the still hour in a nocturn
fashion that he favour and which is by no mean uncommon amongst
black men gener hi presenc in the corridor would not
therefor be like to excit remark without ani comment the
zulu took up hi ax and depart and we also depart to bed
i seem to have been asleep but a few minut when i wa awaken
by a peculiar sensat of uneasi i felt that somebodi
wa in the room and look at me and instantli sat up to see
to my surpris that it wa alreadi dawn and that there stand
at the foot of my couch and look peculiarli grim and gaunt
in the grei light wa umslopogaa himself
how long hast thou been there i ask testili for it is not
pleasant to be arous in such a fashion
mayhap the half of an hour macumazahn i have a word for thee
speak on i said now wide enough awak
as i wa bid i went last night to the place of the white queen
and hid myself behind a pillar in the second anteroom beyond
which is the sleepingplac of the queen bougwan good wa
in the first anteroom alon and outsid the curtain of that
room wa a sentri but i had a mind to see if i could pass in
unseen and i did glide behind them both there i wait
for mani hour when suddenli i perceiv a dark figur come
secretli toward me it wa the figur of a woman and in her
hand she held a dagger behind that figur crept anoth unseen
by the woman it wa bougwan follow in her track hi shoe
were off and for so fat a man he follow veri well the woman
pass me and the starlight shone upon her face
who wa it i ask impati
the face wa the face of the ladi of the night and of a truth
she is well name
i wait and bougwan pass me also then i follow
so we went slowli and without a sound up the long chamber
first the woman then bougwan and then i and the woman saw
not bougwan and bougwan saw not me at last the ladi of the
night came to the curtain that shut off the sleep place
of the white queen and put out her left hand to part them
she pass through and so did bougwan and so did i at the
far end of the room is the bed of the queen and on it she lai
veri fast asleep i could hear her breath and see on white
arm ly on the coverlid like a streak of snow on the dry grass
the ladi of the night doubl herself thu and with the long
knife lift crept toward the bed so straight did she gaze
thereat that she never thought to look behind her when she
wa quit close bougwan touch her on the arm and she caught
her breath and turn and i saw the knife flash and heard it
strike well wa it for bougwan that he had the skin of iron
on him or he had been pierc then for the first time he saw
who the woman wa and without a word he fell back astonish
and unabl to speak she too wa astonish and spoke not
but suddenli she laid her finger on her lip thu and walk
toward and through the curtain and with her went bougwan
so close did she pass to me that her dress touch me and i
wa nigh to slai her as she went in the first outer room
she spoke to bougwan in a whisper and clasp her hand thu
she plead with him but what she said i know not and so thei
pass on to the second outer room she plead and he shake
hi head and sai nai nai nai and it seem to me that
he wa about to call the guard when she stop talk and
look at him with great ey and i saw that he wa bewitch
by her beauti then she stretch out her hand and he kiss
it whereon i gather myself togeth to advanc and take her
see that now had bougwan becom a woman and no longer knew
the good from the evil when behold she wa gone
gone i ejacul
ay gone and there stood bougwan stare at the wall like on
asleep and present he went too and i wait a while and came
awai also
art thou sure umslopogaa said i that thou hast not been
a dreamer thi night
in repli he open hi left hand and produc about three inch
of a blade of a dagger of the finest steel if i be macumazahn
behold what the dream left with me the knife broke upon bougwan
bosom and as i pass i pick thi up in the sleepingplac
of the white queen
chapter xviii
war red war
tell umslopogaa to wait i tumbl into my cloth and went
off with him to sir henri room where the zulu repeat hi
stori word for word it wa a sight to watch curti face as
he heard it
great heaven he said here have i been sleep awai while
nyleptha wa nearli murder and all through me too what
a fiend that sorai must be it would have serv her well if
umslopogaa had cut her down in the act
ay said the zulu fear not i should have slain her er
she struck i wa but wait the moment
i said noth but i could not help think that mani a thousand
doom live would have been save if he had mete out to sorai
the fate she meant for her sister and as the issu prove
i wa right
after he had told hi tale umslopogaa went off unconcernedli
to get hi morn meal and sir henri and i fell to talk
at first he wa veri bitter against good who he said wa no
longer to be trust have designedli allow sorai to escap
by some secret stair when it wa hi duti to have hand her
over to justic inde he spoke in the most unmeasur term
on the matter i let him run on awhil reflect to myself
how easi we find it to be hard on the weak of other and
how tender we ar to our own
realli my dear fellow i said at length on would never
think to hear you talk that you were the man who had an interview
with thi same ladi yesterdai and found it rather difficult
to resist her fascin notwithstand your ti to on
of the loveliest and most love women in the world now suppos
it wa nyleptha who had tri to murder sorai and you had
caught her and she had plead with you would you have been
so veri eager to hand her over to an open shame and to death
by fire just look at the matter through good eyeglass for
a minut befor you denounc an old friend as a scoundrel
he listen to thi jobat submiss and then frankli
acknowledg that he had spoken hardli it is on of the
best point in sir henri charact that he is alwai readi
to admit it when he is in the wrong
but though i spoke up thu for good i wa not blind to the
fact that howev natur hi behaviour might be it wa obviou
that he wa be involv in a veri awkward and disgrac
complic a foul and wick murder had been attempt and
he had let the murderess escap and therebi among other thing
allow her to gain a complet ascend over himself in fact
he wa in a fair wai to becom her tool and no more dread
fate can befal a man than to becom the tool of an unscrupul
woman or inde of ani woman there is but on end to it when
he is broken or ha serv her purpos he is thrown awai
turn out on the world to hunt for hi lost selfrespect whilst
i wa ponder thu and wonder what wa to be done for
the whole subject wa a thorni on i suddenli heard a great
clamour in the courtyard outsid and distinguish the voic
of umslopogaa and alphons the former curs furious and
the latter yell in terror
hurri out to see what wa the matter i wa met by a ludicr
sight the littl frenchman wa run up the courtyard at
an extraordinari speed and after him sped umslopogaa like a
great greyhound just as i came out he caught him and lift
him right off hi leg carri him some pace to a beauti
but veri dens flower shrub which bore a flower not unlik
the gardenia but wa cover with short thorn next despit
hi howl and struggl he with on mighti thrust plung poor
alphons head first into the bush so that noth but the calv
of hi leg and heel remain in evid then satisfi
with what he had done the zulu fold hi arm and stood grimli
contempl the frenchman kick and listen to hi yell
which were aw
what art thou do i said run up wouldst thou kill
the man pull him out of the bush
with a savag grunt he obei seiz the wretch alphons
by the ankl and with a jerk that must have nearli disloc
it tear him out of the heart of the shrub never did i see
such a sight as he present hi cloth half torn off hi back
and bleed as he wa in everi direct from the sharp thorn
there he lai and yell and roll and there wa no get
anyth out of him
at last howev he got up and ensconc himself behind me
curs old umslopogaa by everi saint in the calendar vow
by the blood of hi heroic grandfath that he would poison him
and have hi reveng
at last i got to the truth of the matter it appear that alphons
habitu cook umslopogaass porridg which the latter at
for breakfast in the corner of the courtyard just as he would
have done at home in zululand from a gourd and with a wooden
spoon now umslopogaa had like mani zulu a great horror
of fish which he consid a speci of watersnak so alphons
who wa as fond of plai trick as a monkei and who wa also
a consumm cook determin to make him eat some accordingli
he grate up a quantiti of white fish veri fine and mix
it with the zulu porridg who swallow it nearli all down
in ignor of what he wa eat but unfortun for alphons
he could not restrain hi joi at thi sight and came caper
and peer round till at last umslopogaa who wa veri clever
in hi wai suspect someth and after a care examin
of the remain of hi porridg discov the buffalo heifer
trick and in reveng serv him as i have said inde
the littl man wa fortun not to get a broken neck for hi
pain for as on would have thought he might have learnt from
the episod of hi displai of axemanship that le monsieur noir
wa an ill person to plai practic joke upon
thi incid wa unimport enough in itself but i narrat
it becaus it led to seriou consequ as soon as he had
stanch the bleed from hi scratch and wash himself
alphons went off still curs to recov hi temper a process
which i knew from experi would take a veri long time when
he had gone i gave umslopogaa a jobat and told him that i
wa asham of hi behaviour
ah well macumazahn he said you must be gentl with me
for here is not my place i am weari of it weari to death of
eat and drink of sleep and give in marriag i love
not thi soft life in stone hous that take the heart out of
a man and turn hi strength to water and hi flesh to fat
i love not the white robe and the delic women the blow
of trumpet and the fly of hawk when we fought the masai
at the kraal yonder ah then life wa worth the live but
here is never a blow struck in anger and i begin to think i
shall go the wai of my father and lift inkosikaa no more
and he held up the ax and gaze at it in sorrow
ah i said that is thy complaint is it thou hast the
bloodsick hast thou and the woodpeck want a tree
and at thy ag too shame on thee umslopogaa
ay macumazahn mine is a red trade yet is it better and more
honest than some better is it to slai a man in fair fight than
to suck out hi heart blood in bui and sell and usuri
after your white fashion mani a man have i slain yet is there
never a on that i should fear to look in the face again ay
mani ar there who onc were friend and whom i should be right
glad to snuff with but there there thou hast thy wai and
i mine each to hi own peopl and hi own place the highveldt
ox will die in the fat bush countri and so is it with me macumazahn
i am rough i know it and when my blood is warm i know not
what to do but yet wilt thou be sorri when the night swallow
me and i am utterli lost in black for in thy heart thou
lovest me my father macumazahn the fox though i be nought
but a brokendown zulu wardog a chief for whom there is no
room in hi own kraal an outcast and a wander in strang place
ay i love thee macumazahn for we have grown grei togeth
and there is that between us that cannot be seen and yet is
too strong for break and he took hi snuffbox which wa
made of an old brass cartridg from the slit in hi ear where
he alwai carri it and hand it to me for me to help myself
i took the pinch of snuff with some emot it wa quit true
i wa much attach to the bloodthirsti old ruffian i do not
know what wa the charm of hi charact but it had a charm
perhap it wa it fierc honesti and direct perhap on
admir hi almost superhuman skill and strength or it mai have
been simpli that he wa so absolut uniqu frankli with
all my experi of savag i never knew a man quit like him
he wa so wise and yet such a child with it all and though it
seem laughabl to sai so like the hero of the yanke parodi
he had a tender heart anywai i wa veri fond of him though
i should never have thought of tell him so
ay old wolf i said thine is a strang love thou wouldst
split me to the chin if i stood in thy path tomorrow
thou speakest truth macumazahn that would i if it came in
the wai of duti but i should love thee all the same when the
blow had gone fairli home is there ani chanc of some fight
here macumazahn he went on in an insinu voic methought
that what i saw last night did show that the two great queen
were vex on with anoth els had the ladi of the night
not brought that dagger with her
i agre with him that it show that more or less piqu and
irrit exist between the ladi and told him how thing
stood and that thei were quarrel over incubu
ah is it so he exclaim spring up in delight then
will there be war as sure as the river rise in the rain
war to the end women love the last blow as well as the last
word and when thei fight for love thei ar pitiless as a wound
buffalo see thou macumazahn a woman will swim through blood
to her desir and think nought of it with these ey have
i seen it onc and twice also ah macumazahn we shall see
thi fine place of hous burn yet and hear the battl cri
come ring up the street after all i have not wander for
noth can thi folk fight think ye
just then sir henri join us and good arriv too from anoth
direct look veri pale and hollowei the moment umslopogaa
saw the latter he stop hi bloodthirsti talk and greet him
ah bougwan he cri greet to thee inkoo thou art
sure weari didst thou hunt too much yesterdai then without
wait for an answer he went on
listen bougwan and i will tell thee a stori it is about a
woman therefor wilt thou hear it is it not so
there wa a man and he had a brother and there wa a woman
who love the man brother and wa belov of the man but
the man brother had a favourit wife and love not the woman
and he made a mock of her then the woman be veri cun
and fierceheart for reveng took counsel with herself and
said to the man i love thee and if thou wilt make war upon
thy brother i will marri thee and he knew it wa a lie yet
becaus of hi great love of the woman who wa veri fair did
he listen to her word and made war and when mani peopl had
been kill hi brother sent to him sai why slayest thou
me what hurt have i done unto thee from my youth up have
i not love thee when thou wast littl did i not nurtur thee
and have we not gone down to war togeth and divid the cattl
girl by girl ox by ox and cow by cow why slayest thou me
my brother son of my own mother
then the man heart wa heavi and he knew that hi path wa
evil and he put asid the tempt of the woman and ceas to
make war on hi brother and live at peac in the same kraal
with him and after a time the woman came to him and said i
have lost the past i will be thy wife and in hi heart he
knew that it wa a lie and that she thought the evil thing
yet becaus of hi love did he take her to wife
and the veri night that thei were wed when the man wa plung
into a deep sleep did the woman aris and take hi ax from
hi hand and creep into the hut of hi brother and slai him in
hi rest then did she slink back like a gorg lioness and
place the thong of the red ax back upon hi wrist and go her wai
and at the dawn the peopl came shout lousta is slain
in the night and thei came unto the hut of the man and there
he lai asleep and by him wa the red ax then did thei rememb
the war and sai lo he hath of a sureti slain hi brother
and thei would have taken and kill him but he rose and fled
swiftli and as he fleet by he slew the woman
but death could not wipe out the evil she had done and on him
rest the weight of all her sin therefor is he an outcast
and hi name a scorn among hi own peopl for on him and him
onli resteth the burden of her who betrai and therefor
doe he wander afar without a kraal and without an ox or a wife
and therefor will he die afar like a stricken buck and hi name
be accurs from gener to gener in that the peopl
sai that he slew hi brother lousta by treacheri in the nighttim
the old zulu paus and i saw that he wa deepli agit by
hi own stori present he lift hi head which he had bow
to hi breast and went on
i wa the man bougwan ou i wa that man and now hark
thou even as i am so wilt thou be a tool a playth an
ox of burden to carri the evil deed of anoth listen when
thou didst creep after the ladi of the night i wa hard upon
thy track when she struck thee with the knife in the sleep
place of the white queen i wa there also when thou didst
let her slip awai like a snake in the stone i saw thee and
i knew that she had bewitch thee and that a true man had abandon
the truth and he who aforetim love a straight path had taken
a crook wai forgiv me my father if my word ar sharp
but out of a full heart ar thei spoken see her no more so
shalt thou go down with honour to the grave els becaus of
the beauti of a woman that weareth as a garment of fur shalt
thou be even as i am and perchanc with more caus i have
said
throughout thi long and eloqu address good had been perfectli
silent but when the tale began to shape itself so aptli to hi
own case he colour up and when he learnt that what had pass
between him and sorai had been overseen he wa evid much
distress and now when at last he spoke it wa in a tone
of humil quit foreign to him
i must sai he said with a bitter littl laugh that i scarc
thought that i should live to be taught my duti by a zulu but
it just show what we can come to i wonder if you fellow can
understand how humili i feel and the bitterest part of it
is that i deserv it all of cours i should have hand sorai
over to the guard but i could not and that is a fact i let
her go and i promis to sai noth more is the shame to me
she told me that if i would side with her she would marri me
and make me king of thi countri but thank good i did find
the heart to sai that even to marri her i could not desert my
friend and now you can do what you like i deserv it all
all i have to sai is that i hope that you mai never love a woman
with all your heart and then be so sore tempt of her and
he turn to go
look here old fellow said sir henri just stop a minut
i have a littl tale to tell you too and he went on to narrat
what had taken place on the previou dai between sorai and himself
thi wa a finish stroke to poor good it is not pleasant
to ani man to learn that he ha been made a tool of but when
the circumst ar as peculiarli atroci as in the present
case it is about as bitter a pill as anybodi can be call on
to swallow
do you know he said i think that between you you fellow
have about work a cure and he turn and walk awai and
i for on felt veri sorri for him ah if the moth would alwai
carefulli avoid the candl how few burnt wing there would be
that dai wa a court dai when the queen sat in the great hall
and receiv petit discuss law monei grant and so
forth and thither we adjourn shortli afterward on our wai
we were join by good who wa look exceedingli depress
when we got into the hall nyleptha wa alreadi on her throne
and proceed with busi as usual surround by councillor
courtier lawyer priest and an unusu strong guard
it wa howev easi to see from the air of excit and expect
on the face of everybodi present that nobodi wa pai much
attent to ordinari affair the fact be that the knowledg
that civil war wa immin had now got abroad we salut nyleptha
and took our accustom place and for a littl while thing
went on as usual when suddenli the trumpet began to call outsid
the palac and from the great crowd that wa gather there
in anticip of some unusu event there rose a roar of
sorai sorai
then came the roll of mani chariot wheel and present the
great curtain at the end of the hall were drawn wide and through
them enter the ladi of the night herself nor did she come
alon preced her wa agon the high priest arrai in hi
most gorgeou vestment and on either side were other priest
the reason for their presenc wa obviou come with them
it would have been sacrileg to attempt to detain her behind
her were a number of the great lord and behind them a small
bodi of pick guard a glanc at sorai herself wa enough
to show that her mission wa of no peac kind for in place
of her gold embroid kaf she wore a shine tunic form
of golden scale and on her head a littl golden helmet in
her hand too she bore a toi spear beautifulli made and fashion
of solid silver up the hall she came look like a lioness
in her consciou pride and beauti and as she came the spectat
fell back bow and made a path for her by the sacr stone
she halt and lai her hand on it she cri out with a loud
voic to nyleptha on the throne hail oh queen
all hail my royal sister answer nyleptha draw thou near
fear not i give thee safe conduct
sorai answer with a haughti look and swept on up the hall
till she stood right befor the throne
a boon oh queen she cri again
speak on my sister what is there that i can give thee who
hath half our kingdom
thou canst tell me a true word me and the peopl of zuvendi
art thou or art thou not about to take thi foreign wolf
and she point to sir henri with her toi spear to be a husband
to thee and share thy bed and throne
curti winc at thi and turn toward sorai said to her
in a low voic methink that yesterdai thou hadst other name
than wolf to call me by oh queen and i saw her bite her lip

effectu manner inspir thereto as i firmli believ by coquetri
and a desir to triumph over her rival
up she rose and descend from the throne swept in all the
glori of her royal grace on to where her lover stood there
she stop and untwin the golden snake that wa wound around
her arm then she bade him kneel and he drop on on knee
on the marbl befor her and next take the golden snake with
both her hand she bent the pure soft metal round hi neck
and when it wa fast deliber kiss him on the brow and
call him her dear lord

so beauti she look stand hand in hand there at her lover
side so sure of him and of herself and so readi to risk all

for her to make and it appeal to the imagin but human
natur in zuvendi as elsewher love that which is bold and
not afraid to break a rule and is moreov peculiarli suscept

and so the peopl cheer till the roof rang but sorai of the
night stood there with downcast ey for she could not bear
to see her sister triumph which rob her of the man whom
she had hope to win and in the aw of her jealou anger
she trembl and turn white like an aspen in the wind i think

a storm and a murmur partli of horror and partli of admir
ran through the hall then nyleptha answer calmli and with
digniti
ill would it becom my place and digniti oh sister so to speak

instantli the whole concours began to break up in indescrib
confus mani present hasten to throw in their lot with
the ladi of the night but some came from her follow to
us amongst the former wa an under offic of nyleptha own
guard who suddenli turn and made a run for the doorwai through
which sorai peopl were alreadi pass umslopogaa who
wa present and had taken the whole scene in see with admir
presenc of mind that if thi soldier got awai other would follow
hi exampl seiz the man who drew hi sword and struck at
him thereon the zulu sprang back with a wild shout and avoid
the sword cut began to peck at hi foe with hi terribl ax
till in a few second the man fate overtook him and he fell
with a clash heavili and quit dead upon the marbl floor
thi wa the first blood spilt in the war
shut the gate i shout think that we might perhap catch
sorai so and not be troubl with the idea of commit
sacrileg but the order came too late her guard were alreadi

chapter xix
a strang wed
on person howev did not succe in get out in time befor
the gate were shut and that wa the high priest agon who
as we had everi reason to believ wa sorai great alli and
the heart and soul of her parti thi cun and feroci
old man had not forgiven us for those hippopotami or rather
that wa what he said what he meant wa that he would never
brook the introduct of our wider wai of thought and foreign
learn and influenc while there wa a possibl of stamp
us out also he knew that we possess a differ system of
religion and no doubt wa in daili terror of our attempt
to introduc it into zuvendi on dai he ask me if we had
ani religion in our countri and i told him that so far as i
could rememb we had ninetyf differ on you might
have knock him down with a feather and realli it is difficult
not to piti a high priest of a wellestablish cult who is haunt
by the possibl approach of on or all of ninetyf new religion
when we knew that agon wa caught nyleptha sir henri and i
discuss what wa to be done with him i wa for close incarcer
him but nyleptha shook her head sai that it would produc
a disastr effect throughout the countri ah she ad
with a stamp of her foot if i win and am onc realli queen
i will break the power of those priest with their rite and
revel and dark secret wai i onli wish that old agon could
have heard her it would have frighten him
well said sir henri if we ar not to imprison him i suppos
that we mai as well let him go he is of no us here
nyleptha look at him in a curiou sort of wai and said in
a dry littl voic thinkest thou so my lord
eh said curti no i do not see what is the us of keep him
she said noth but continu look at him in a wai that
wa as shy as it wa sweet
then at last he understood
forgiv me nyleptha he said rather tremul dost thou
mean that thou wilt marri me even now
nai i know not let my lord sai wa her rapid answer but
if my lord will the priest is there and the altar is there
point to the entranc to a privat chapel and am i
not readi to do the will of my lord listen oh my lord in
eight dai or less thou must leav me and go down to war for
thou shalt lead my armi and in war men sometim fall
and so i would for a littl space have had thee all my own if
onli for memori sake and the tear overflow her love
ey and roll down her face like heavi drop of dew down the
red heart of a rose
mayhap too she went on i shall lose my crown and with
my crown my life and thine also sorai is veri strong and veri
bitter and if she prevail she will not spare who can read
the futur happi is the world white bird that alight
seldom and fli fast and far till on dai he is lost in the
cloud therefor should we hold him fast if by ani chanc he
rest for a littl space upon our hand it is not wise to neglect
the present for the futur for who know what the futur will
be incubu let us pluck our flower while the dew is on them
for when the sun is up thei wither and on the morrow will other
bloom that we shall never see and she lift her sweet face
to him and smile into hi ey and onc more i felt a curiou
pang of jealousi and turn and went awai thei never took much
notic of whether i wa there or not think i suppos that
i wa an old fool and that it did not matter on wai or the
other and realli i believ that thei were right
so i went back to our quarter and rumin over thing in gener
and watch old umslopogaa whet hi ax outsid the window
as a vultur whet hi beak besid a dy ox
and in about an hour time sir henri came tear over look
veri radiant and wildli excit and found good and myself and
even umslopogaa and ask us if we should like to assist at
a real wed of cours we said ye and off we went to the
chapel where we found agon look as sulki as ani high priest
possibl could and no wonder it appear that he and nyleptha
had a slight differ of opinion about the come ceremoni
he had flatli refus to celebr it or to allow ani of hi
priest to do so whereupon nyleptha becam veri angri and told
him that she as queen wa head of the church and meant to
be obei inde she plai the part of a zuvendi henri the
eighth to perfect and insist that if she want to be
marri she would be marri and that he should marri her
endnot 18
he still refus to go through the ceremoni so she clinch
her argument thu
well i cannot execut a high priest becaus there is an absurd
prejudic against it and i cannot imprison him becaus all hi
subordin would rais a cry that would bring the star
down on zuvendi and crush it but i can leav him to contempl
the altar of the sun without anyth to eat becaus that is
hi natur vocat and if thou wilt not marri me o agon
thou shalt be place befor the altar yonder with nought but
a littl water till such time as thou hast reconsid the matter
now as it happen agon had been hurri awai that morn
without hi breakfast and wa alreadi exceedingli hungri so
he present modifi hi view and consent to marri them
sai at the same time that he wash hi hand of all respons
in the matter
so it chanc that present attend onli by two of her favourit
maiden came the queen nyleptha with happi blush face and
downcast ey dress in pure white without embroideri of ani
sort as seem to be the fashion on these occas in most countri
of the world she did not wear a singl ornament even her gold
circlet were remov and i thought that if possibl she look
more love than ever without them as realli superbl beauti
women do
she came curtsei low to sir henri and then took hi hand
and led him up befor the altar and after a littl paus in
a slow clear voic utter the follow word which ar customari
in zuvendi if the bride desir and the man consent
thou dost swear by the sun that thou wilt take no other woman
to wife unless i lai my hand upon her and bid her come
i swear it answer sir henri ad in english on is
quit enough for me
then agon who had been sulk in a corner near the altar came
forward and gabbl off someth into hi beard at such a rate
that i could not follow it but it appear to be an invoc
to the sun to bless the union and make it fruit i observ
that nyleptha listen veri close to everi word and afterward
discov that she wa afraid lest agon should plai her a trick
and by go through the invoc backward divorc them instead
of marri them at the end of the invoc thei were ask
as in our servic if thei took each other for husband and wife
and on their assent thei kiss each other befor the altar
and the servic wa over so far as their rite were concern
but it seem to me that there wa yet someth want and
so i produc a prayerbook which ha togeth which the ingoldsbi
legend that i often read when i lie awak at night accompani
me in all my later wander i gave it to my poor boi harri
year ago and after hi death i found it among hi thing and
took it back again
curti i said i am not a clergyman and i do not know if
what i am go to propos is allow i know it is not legal
but if you and the queen have no object i should like to read
the english marriag servic over you it is a solemn step which
you ar take and i think that you ought so far as circumst
will allow to give it the sanction of your own religion
i have thought of that he said and i wish you would
i do not feel half marri yet
nyleptha rais no object fulli understand that her husband
wish to celebr the marriag accord to the rite prevail
in hi own countri and so i set to work and read the servic
from dearli belov to amaz as well as i could and
when i came to i henri take thee nyleptha i translat
and also i nyleptha take thee henri which she repeat
after me veri well then sir henri took a plain gold ring from
hi littl finger and place it on her and so on to the end
the ring had been curti mother weddingr and i could
not help think how astonish the dear old yorkshir ladi
would have been if she could have foreseen that her weddingr
wa to serv a similar purpos for nyleptha a queen of the zuvendi
as for agon he wa with difficulti kept calm while thi second
ceremoni wa go on for he at onc understood that it wa
religi in it natur and doubtless bethought him of the ninetyf
new faith which loom so omin in hi ey inde he
at onc set me down as a rival high priest and hate me accordingli
howev in the end off he went posit bristl with indign
and i knew that we might look out for danger from hi direct
and off went good and i and old umslopogaa also leav the
happi pair to themselv and veri low we all felt marriag
ar suppos to be cheer thing but my experi is that
thei ar veri much the revers to everybodi except perhap the
two peopl chiefli interest thei mean the breakingup of
so mani old ti as well as the undertak of so mani new on
and there is alwai someth sad about the pass awai of the
old order now to take thi case for instanc sir henri curti
is the best and kindest fellow and friend in the world but he
ha never been quit the same sinc that littl scene in the
chapel it is alwai nyleptha thi and nyleptha that nyleptha
in short from morn till night in on wai or anoth either
express or understood and as for the old friend well
of cours thei have taken the place that old friend ought to
take and which ladi ar as a rule veri care to see thei
do take when a man marri and that is the second place ye
he would be angri if anybodi said so but it is a fact for all
that he is not quit the same and nyleptha is veri sweet and
veri charm but i think that she like him to understand that
she ha marri him and not quatermain good and co but
there what is the us of grumbl it is all veri right and
proper as ani marri ladi would have no difficulti in explain
and i am a selfish jealou old man though i hope i never show
it
so good and i went and at in silenc and then indulg in an
extra fine flagon of old zuvendian to keep our spirit up and
present on of our attend came and told a stori that gave
us someth to think about
it mai perhap be rememb that after hi quarrel with
umslopogaa alphons had gone off in an exceedingli ill temper
to sulk over hi scratch well it appear that he walk
right past the templ to the sun down the wide road on the further
side of the slope it crown and thenc on into the beauti
park or pleasur garden which ar laid out just beyond the
outer wall after wander about there for a littl he start
to return but wa met near the outer gate by sorai train of
chariot which were gallop furious along the great northern
road when she caught sight of alphons sorai halt her train
and call to him on approach he wa instantli seiz and
drag into on of the chariot and carri off cry out
loudli as our inform said and as from my gener knowledg
of him i can well believ
at first i wa much puzzl to know what object sorai could
have had in carri off the poor littl frenchman she could
hardli stoop so low as to try to wreak her furi on on whom she
knew wa onli a servant at last howev an idea occur
to me we three were as i think i have said much rever by
the peopl of zuvendi at larg both becaus we were the first
stranger thei had ever seen and becaus we were suppos to
be the possessor of almost supernatur wisdom inde though
sorai cry against the foreign wolv or to translat
it more accur foreign hyena wa sure to go down veri
well with the nobl and the priest it wa not as we learnt
like to be particularli effectu amongst the bulk of the popul
the zuvendi peopl like the athenian of old ar ever seek
for some new thing and just becaus we were so new our presenc
wa on the whole accept to them again sir henri magnific
person appear made a deep impress upon a race who possess
a greater love of beauti than ani other i have ever been acquaint
with beauti mai be prize in other countri but in zuvendi
it is almost worship as inde the nation love of statuari
show the peopl said openli in the marketplac that there
wa not a man in the countri to touch curti in person appear
as with the except of sorai there wa no woman who could
compet with nyleptha and that therefor it wa meet that thei
should marri and that he had been sent by the sun as a husband
for their queen now from all thi it will be seen that the
outcri against us wa to a consider extent fictiti and
nobodi knew it better than sorai herself consequ it struck
me that it might have occur to her that down in the countri
and among the countri peopl it would be better to place the
reason of her conflict with her sister upon other and more gener
ground than nyleptha marriag with the stranger it would
be easi in a land where there had been so mani civil war to
rake out some old cry that would stir up the recollect of
buri feud and inde she soon found an effectu on
thi be so it wa of great import to her to have on
of the stranger with her whom she could show to the common peopl
as a great outland who had been so struck by the justic of
her caus that he had elect to leav hi companion and follow
her standard
thi no doubt wa the caus of her anxieti to get a hold of
good whom she would have us till he ceas to be of servic
and then cast off but good have drawn back she grasp at
the opportun of secur alphons who wa not unlik him
in person appear though smaller no doubt with the object
of show him off in the citi and countri as the great bougwan
himself i told good that i thought that that wa her plan
and hi face wa a sight to see he wa so horrifi at the
idea
what he said dress up that littl wretch to repres me
why i shall have to get out of the countri my reput
will be ruin for ever
i consol him as well as i could but it is not pleasant to
be person all over a strang countri by an arrant littl
coward and i can quit sympath with hi vexat
well that night good and i mess as i have said in solitari
grandeur feel veri much as though we had just return from
buri a friend instead of marri on and next morn the
work began in good earnest the messag and order which had
been despatch by nyleptha two dai befor now began to take
effect and multitud of arm men came pour into the citi
we saw as mai be imagin but veri littl of nyleptha and
not too much of curti dure those next few dai but good and
i sat daili with the council of gener and loyal lord draw
up plan of action arrang commissariat matter the distribut
of command and a hundr and on other thing men came in
freeli and all the dai long the great road lead to milosi
were spot with the banner of lord arriv from their distant
place to ralli round nyleptha
after the first few dai it becam clear that we should be abl
to take the field with about forti thousand infantri and twenti
thousand cavalri a veri respect forc consid how short
wa the time we had to collect it and that about half the regular
armi had elect to follow sorai
but if our forc wa larg sorai wa accord to the report
brought in dai by dai by our spi much larger she had taken
up her headquart at a veri strong town call marstuna situat
as i have said to the north of milosi and all the countrysid
wa flock to her standard nasta had pour down from hi
highland and wa on hi wai to join her with no less than twentyf
thousand of hi mountain the most terribl soldier to face
in all zuvendi anoth mighti lord name belusha who live
in the great horsebreed district had come in with twelv
thousand cavalri and so on inde what between on thing
and anoth it seem certain that she would gather a fulli
arm host of nearli on hundr thousand men
and then came new that sorai wa propos to break up her
camp and march on the frown citi itself desol the countri
as she came thereon aros the question whether it would be
best to meet her at milosi or to go out and give her battl
when our opinion wa ask upon the subject good and i unhesitatingli
gave it in favour of an advanc if we were to shut ourselv
up in the citi and wait to be attack it seem to us that
our inact would be set down to fear it is so import
especi on an occas of thi sort when a veri littl will
suffic to turn men opinion on wai or the other to be up
and do someth ardour for a caus will soon evapor
if the caus doe not move but sit down to conquer therefor
we cast our vote for move out and give battl in the open
instead of wait till we were drawn from our wall like a badger
from a hole
sir henri opinion coincid with our and so needless to
sai did that of nyleptha who like a flint wa alwai readi
to flash out fire a great map of the countri wa brought and
spread out befor her about thirti mile thi side of marstuna
where sorai lai and nineti odd mile from milosi the road
ran over a neck of land some two and a half mile in width and
flank on either side by forestclad hill which without be
lofti would if the road were block be quit impractic
for a great baggageladen armi to cross she look earnestli
at the map and then with a quick of percept that in
some women amount almost to an instinct she laid her finger
upon thi neck of rise ground and turn to her husband
said with a proud air of confid and a toss of the golden
head
here shalt thou meet sorai armi i know the spot here
shalt thou meet them and drive them befor thee like dust befor
the storm
but curti look grave and said noth
chapter xx
the battl of the pass
it wa on the third morn after thi incid of the map that
sir henri and i start with the except of a small guard
all the great host had move on the night befor leav the
frown citi veri silent and empti inde it wa found imposs
to leav ani garrison with the except of a person guard
for nyleptha and about a thousand men who from sick or on
caus or anoth were unabl to proce with the armi but as
milosi wa practic impregn and as our enemi wa in
front of and not behind us thi did not so much matter
good and umslopogaa had gone on with the armi but nyleptha
accompani sir henri and myself to the citi gate ride a
magnific white hors call daylight which wa suppos to
be the fleetest and most endur anim in zuvendi her face
bore trace of recent weep but there were no tear in her
ey now inde she wa bear up brave against what must
have been a bitter trial to her at the gate she rein in her
hors and bade us farewel on the previou dai she had review
and address the offic of the great armi speak to them
such high eloqu word and express so complet a confid
in their valour and in their ultim victori that she quit
carri their heart awai and as she rode from rank to rank
thei cheer her till the ground shook and now todai the same
mood seem to be on her
fare thee well macumazahn she said rememb i trust to
thy wit which ar as a needl to a spearhandl compar to
those of my peopl to save us from sorai i know that thou
wilt do thy duti
i bow and explain to her my horror of fight and my fear
lest i should lose my head at which she laugh gentli and turn
to curti
fare thee well my lord she said come back with victori
and as a king or on thy soldier spear endnot 19
sir henri said noth but turn hi hors to go perhap he
had a bit of a lump in hi throat on get over it afterward
but these sort of part ar try when on ha onli been
marri a week
here ad nyleptha will i greet thee when ye return in
triumph and now my lord onc more farewel
then we rode on but when we had gone a hundr and fifti yard
or so we turn and perceiv her still sit on her hors
at the same spot and look out after us beneath her hand
and that wa the last we saw of her about a mile farther on
howev we heard gallop behind us and look round saw
a mount soldier come toward us lead nyleptha matchless
steed daylight
the queen send the white stallion as a farewel gift to her
lord incubu and bid me tell my lord that he is the fleetest
and most endur hors in all the land said the soldier bend
to hi saddlebow befor us
at first sir henri did not want to take the hors sai that
he wa too good for such rough work but i persuad him to do
so think that nyleptha would be hurt if he did not littl
did i guess at the time what servic that nobl hors would render
in our sorest need it is curiou to look back and realiz upon
what trivial and appar coincident circumst great
event frequent turn as easili and natur as a door on it
hing
well we took the hors and a beauti he wa it wa a perfect
pleasur to see him move and curti have sent back hi greet
and thank we proceed on our journei
by middai we overtook the rearguard of the great armi of which
sir henri then formal took over the command it wa a heavi
respons and it oppress him veri much but the queen
injunct on the point were such as did not admit of be
trifl with he wa begin to find out that great ha
it respons as well as it glori
then we march on without meet with ani opposit almost
inde without see anybodi for the popul of the town
and villag along our rout had for the most part fled fear
lest thei should be caught between the two rival armi and ground
to powder like grain between the upper and the nether stone
on the even of the fourth dai for the progress of so great
a multitud wa necessarili slow we camp two mile thi side
of the neck or ridg i have spoken of and our outpost brought
us word that sorai with all her power wa roll down upon
us and had pitch her camp that night ten mile the farther
side of the neck
accordingli befor dawn we sent forward fifteen hundr cavalri
to seiz the posit scarc had thei occupi it howev
befor thei were attack by about as mani of sorai horsemen
and a veri smart littl cavalri fight ensu with a loss to
us of about thirti men kill on the advanc of our support
howev sorai forc drew off carri their dead and wound
with them
the main bodi of the armi reach the neck about dinnertim
and i must sai that nyleptha judgment had not fail her it
wa an admir place to give battl in especi to a superior
forc
the road ran down a mile or more through ground too broken to
admit of the handl of ani consider forc till it reach
the crest of a great green wave of land that roll down a gentl
slope to the bank of a littl stream and then roll awai again
up a still gentler slope to the plain beyond the distanc from
the crest of the landwav down to the stream be a littl
over half a mile and from the stream up to the plain beyond
a trifl less the length of thi wave of land at it highest
point which correspond exactli with the width of the neck
of the land between the wood hill wa about two mile and
a quarter and it wa protect on either side by dens rocki
bushclad ground that afford a most valuabl cover to the
flank of the armi and render it almost imposs for them
to be turn
it wa on the hither slope of thi neck of land that curti encamp
hi armi in the same format that he had after consult
with the variou gener good and myself determin that
thei should occupi in the great pitch battl which now appear
to be immin
our forc of sixti thousand men wa roughli speak divid
as follow in the centr wa a dens bodi of twenti thousand
footsoldi arm with spear sword and hippopotamushid
shield breast and back plate endnot 20 these form the
chest of the armi and were support by five thousand foot
and three thousand hors in reserv on either side of thi
chest were station seven thousand hors arrang in deep majest
squadron and beyond and on either side but slightli in front
of them again were two bodi each number about seven thousand
five hundr spearmen form the right and left wing of the
armi and each support by a conting of some fifteen hundr
cavalri thi make in all sixti thousand men
curti command in chief i wa in command of the seven thousand
hors between the chest and right wing which wa command by
good and the other battalion and squadron were entrust to
zuvendi gener
scarc had we taken up our posit befor sorai vast armi
began to swarm on the opposit slope about a mile in front of
us till the whole place seem aliv with the multitud of her
spearpoint and the ground shook with the tramp of her battalion
it wa evid that the spi had not exagger we were outnumb
by at least a third at first we expect that sorai wa go
to attack us at onc as the cloud of cavalri which hung upon
her flank execut some threaten demonstr but she
thought better of it and there wa no fight that dai as for
the format of her great forc i cannot now describ it with
accuraci and it would onli serv to bewild if i did but i
mai sai gener that in it lead featur it resembl
our own onli her reserv wa much greater
opposit our right wing and form sorai left wing wa a
great armi of dark wildlook men arm with sword and shield
onli which i wa inform wa compos of nasta twentyf
thousand savag hillsmen
my word good said i when i saw them you will catch it
tomorrow when those gentlemen charg whereat good not unnatur
look rather anxiou
all dai we watch and wait but noth happen and at last
night fell and a thousand watchfir twinkl brightli on the
slope to wane and die on by on like the star thei resembl
as the hour wore on the silenc gradual gather more deepli
over the oppos host
it wa a veri weari night for in addit to the endless
thing that had to be attend to there wa our gnaw suspens
to reckon with the frai which tomorrow would wit would
be so vast and the slaughter so aw that stout inde must
the heart have been that wa not overwhelm at the prospect
and when i thought of all that hung upon it i own i felt ill
and it made me veri sad to reflect that these mighti forc were
gather for destruct simpli to gratifi the jealou anger
of a woman thi wa the hidden power which wa to send those
dens mass of cavalri flash like human thunderbolt across
the plain and to roll togeth the fierc battalion as cloud
when hurrican meet hurrican it wa a dread thought and
set on wonder about the respons of the great on
of the earth deep into the night we sat with pale face and
heavi heart and took counsel whilst the sentri tramp up
and down down and up and the arm and plume gener came
and went grim and shadowlik
and so the time wore awai till everyth wa readi for the
come slaughter and i lai down and thought and tri to get
a littl rest but could not sleep for fear of the morrow
for who could sai what the morrow would bring forth miseri
and death thi wa certain beyond that we knew not and i confess
i wa veri much afraid but as i realiz then it is useless
to question that etern sphinx the futur from dai to dai
she read aloud the riddl of the yesterdai of which the puzzl
wordl of all ag have not answer on nor ever will guess
thei never so wildli or cry thei never so loud
and so at length i gave up wonder be forc humbl to
leav the issu in the balanc hand of provid and the
morrow
and at last up came the red sun and the huge camp awok with
a clash and a roar and gather themselv togeth for battl
it wa a beauti and aweinspir scene and old umslopogaa
lean on hi ax contempl it with grim delight
never have i seen the like macumazahn never he said the
battl of my peopl ar as the plai of children to what thi
will be thinkest thou that thei will fight it out
ay i answer sadli to the death content thyself woodpeck
for onc shalt thou peck thy fill
time went on and still there wa no sign of an attack a forc
of cavalri cross the brook inde and rode slowli along our
front evid take stock of our posit and number with
thi we did not attempt to interfer as our decis wa to
stand strictli on the defens and not to wast a singl man
the men breakfast and stood to their arm and the hour wore
on about middai when the men were eat their dinner for
we thought thei would fight better on full stomach a shout
of sorai sorai aros like thunder from the enemi extrem
right and take the glass i wa abl to clearli distinguish
the ladi of the night herself surround by a glitter staff
and ride slowli down the line of her battalion and as she
went that mighti thunder shout roll along befor her like
the roll of ten thousand chariot or the roar of the ocean
when the gale turn suddenli and carri the nois of it to the
listen ear till the earth shook and the air wa full of
the majesti of sound
guess that thi wa a prelud to the begin of the battl
we remain still and made readi
we had not long to wait suddenli like flame from a cannon
mouth out shot two great tonguelik forc of cavalri and
came charg down the slope toward the littl stream slowli
at first but gather speed as thei came befor thei got
to the stream order reach me from sir henri who evid
fear that the shock of such a charg if allow to fall unbroken
upon our infantri would be too much for them to send five thousand
sabr to meet the forc opposit to me at the moment when it
began to mount the stiffest of the rise about four hundr yard
from our line thi i did remain behind myself with the
rest of my men
off went the five thousand horsemen drawn up in a wedgelik
form and i must sai that the gener in command handl them
veri abli start at a hand gallop for the first three hundr
yard he rode straight at the tip of the tongueshap mass of
cavalri which number so far as i could judg about eight
thousand sabr wa advanc to charg us then he suddenli
swerv to the right and put on the pace and i saw the great
wedg curl round and befor the foe could check himself and
turn to meet it strike him about halfwai down hi length with
a crash rend sound like that of the breakingup of vast
sheet of ic in sank the great wedg into hi heart and
as it cut it wai hundr of horsemen were thrown up on either
side of it just as the earth is thrown up by a ploughshar
or more like still as the foam water curl over beneath the
bow of a rush ship in yet in vainli doe the tongu twist
it end round in agoni like an injur snake and strive to
protect it centr still farther in by heaven right through
and so amid cheer after cheer from our watch thousand back
again upon the sever end beat them down drive them
as a gale drive sprai till at last amidst the rush of hundr
of riderless hors the flash of sword and the victori
clamour of their pursuer the great forc crumpl up like an
empti glove then turn and gallop pellmel for safeti back
to it own line
i do not think it reach them more than twothird as strong
as it went out ten minut befor the line which were now
advanc to the attack open and swallow them up and my
forc return have onli suffer a loss of about five hundr
men not much i thought consid the fierc of the
struggl i could also see that the oppos bodi of cavalri
on our left wing were draw back but how the fight went with
them i do not quit know it is as much as i can do to describ
what took place immedi around me
by thi time the dens mass of the enemi left compos almost
entir of nasta swordsmen were across the littl stream
and with altern yell of nasta and sorai with danc
banner and gleam sword were swarm up toward us like
ant
again i receiv order to try and check thi movement and also
the main advanc against the chest of our armi by mean of cavalri
charg and thi i did to the best of my abil by continu
send squadron of about a thousand sabr out against them
these squadron did the enemi much damag and it wa a gloriou
sight to see them flash down the hillsid and buri themselv
like a live knife in the heart of the foe but also we lost
mani men for after the experi of a coupl of these charg
which had drawn a sort of bloodi st andrew cross of dead and
dy through the centr of nasta host our foe no longer
attempt to offer an unyield front to their irresist
weight but open out to let the rush go through throw themselv
on the ground and hamstring hundr of hors as thei pass
and so notwithstand all that we could do the enemi drew
nearer till at last he hurl himself upon good forc of seven
thousand five hundr regular who were drawn up to receiv
them in three strong squar about the same time too an aw
and heartshak roar told me that the main battl had close
in on the centr and extrem left i rais myself in my stirrup
and look down to my left so far as the ey could see there
wa a long dazzl shimmer of steel as the sun glanc upon
fall sword and thrust spear
to and fro swung the contend line in that dread struggl
now give wai now gain a littl in the mad yet order confus
of attack and defenc but it wa as much as i could do to keep
count of what wa happen to our own wing and as for the
moment the cavalri had fallen back under cover of good three
squar i had a fair view of thi
nasta wild swordsmen were now break in red wave against
the sullen rocklik squar time after time did thei yell
out their warcri and hurl themselv furious against the
long tripl ridg of spear point onli to be roll back as
billow ar when thei meet the cliff
and so for four long hour the battl rage almost without a
paus and at the end of that time if we had gain noth
we had lost noth two attempt to turn our left flank by
forc a wai through the wood by which it wa protect had
been defeat and as yet nasta swordsmen had notwithstand
their desper effort entir fail to break good three
squar though thei had thin their number by quit a third
as for the chest of the armi where sir henri wa with hi staff
and umslopogaa it had suffer dreadfulli but it had held
it own with honour and the same mai be said of our left battl
at last the attack slacken and sorai armi drew back have
i began to think had enough of it on thi point howev
i wa soon undeceiv for split up her cavalri into compar
small squadron she charg us furious with them all along
the line and then onc more sullenli roll her ten of thousand
of sword and spearmen down upon our weaken squar and squadron
sorai herself direct the movement as fearless as a lioness
head the main attack on thei came like an avalanch i saw
her golden helm gleam in the van our counter charg of cavalri
entir fail to check their forward sweep now thei had
struck us and our centr bent in like a bow beneath the weight
of their rush it part and had not the ten thousand men
in reserv charg down to it support it must have been utterli
destroi as for good three squar thei were swept backward
like boat upon an incom tide and the foremost on wa burst
into and lost half it remain men but the effort wa too
fierc and terribl to last suddenli the battl came as it
were to a turningpoint and for a minut or two stood still
then it began to move toward sorai camp just then too
nasta fierc and almost invinc highland either becaus
thei were dishearten by their loss or by wai of a ruse fell
back and the remain of good gallant squar leav the
posit thei had held for so mani hour cheer wildli and
rashli follow them down the slope whereon the swarm of swordsmen
turn to envelop them and onc more flung themselv upon them
with a yell taken thu on everi side what remain of the
first squar wa quickli destroi and i perceiv that the
second in which i could see good himself mount on a larg
hors wa on the point of annihil a few more minut
and it wa broken it stream colour sank and i lost sight
of good in the confus and hideou slaughter that ensu
present howev a creamcolour hors with a snowwhit
mane and tail burst from the ruin of the squar and came rush
past me riderless and with wide stream rein and in it i
recogn the charger that good had been ride then i hesit
no longer but take with me half my effect cavalri forc
which now amount to between four and five thousand men i commend
myself to god and without wait for order i charg straight
down upon nasta swordsmen see me come and be warn
by the thunder of my hors hoof the major of them face
round and gave us a right warm welcom not an inch would thei
yield in vain did we hack and trampl them down as we plough
a broad red furrow through their thousand thei seem to rearis
by hundr drive their terribl sharp sword into our hors
or sever their hamstr and then hack the trooper who
came to the ground with them almost into piec my hors wa
speedili kill under me but luckili i had a fresh on my own
favourit a coalblack mare nyleptha had given me be held
in reserv behind and on thi i afterward mount meanwhil
i had to get along as best i could for i wa pretti well lost
sight of by my men in the mad confus of the moment my voic
of cours could not be heard in the midst of the clang of
steel and the shriek of rage and agoni present i found myself
mix up with the remnant of the squar which had form round
it leader good and wa fight desper for exist
i stumbl against somebodi and glanc down caught sight
of good eyeglass he had been beaten to hi knee over him
wa a great fellow swing a heavi sword somehow i manag
to run the man through with the sime i had taken from the masai
whose hand i had cut off but as i did so he dealt me a fright
blow on the left side and breast with the sword and though my
chain shirt save my life i felt that i wa badli hurt for
a minut i fell on to my hand and knee among the dead and dy
and turn sick and faint when i came to again i saw that nasta
spearmen or rather those of them who remain were retreat
back across the stream and that good wa there by me smile sweetli
near go that he shout but all well that end well
i assent but i could not help feel that it had not end
well for me i wa sore hurt
just then we saw the smaller bodi of cavalri station on our
extrem right and left and which were now reinforc by the
three thousand sabr which we had held in reserv flash out
like arrow from their post and fall upon the disord flank
of sorai forc and that charg decid the issu of the battl
in anoth minut or two the enemi wa in slow and sullen retreat
across the littl stream where thei onc more reform then
came anoth lull dure which i manag to get a second hors
and receiv my order to advanc from sir henri and then with
on fierc deepthroat roar with a wave of banner and a
wide flash of steel the remain of our armi took the offens
and began to sweep down slowli inde but irresist from
the posit thei had so gallantli held all dai
at last it wa our turn to attack
on we move over the piledup mass of dead and dy and
were approach the stream when suddenli i perceiv an extraordinari
sight gallop wildli toward us hi arm tightli clasp
around hi hors neck against which hi blanch cheek wa
tightli press wa a man arrai in the full costum of a zuvendi
gener but in whom as he came nearer i recogn none other
than our lost alphons it wa imposs even then to mistak
those curl mustachio in a minut he wa tear through
our rank and narrowli escap be cut down till at last somebodi
caught hi hors bridl and he wa brought to me just as a
momentari halt occur in our advanc to allow what remain
of our shatter squar to form into line
ah monsieur he gasp out in a voic that wa nearli inarticul
with fright grace to the sky it is you ah what i have endur
but you win monsieur you win thei fly the lach but listen
monsieur i forget it is no good the queen is to be murder

come with me i said and shout to the staffoffic next
to me to take over the command i snatch hi bridl and gallop
as hard as i could for the spot between a quarter and half a
mile off where i saw the royal pennon fly and where i knew
that i should find curti if he were still aliv on we tore
our hors clear heap of dead and dy men and splash
through pool of blood on past the long broken line of spearmen
to where mount on the white stallion nyleptha had sent to him
as a part gift i saw sir henri form tower abov the
gener who surround him
just as we reach him the advanc began again a bloodi cloth
wa bound around hi head but i saw that hi ey wa as bright
and keen as ever besid him wa old umslopogaa hi ax red
with blood but look quit fresh and uninjur
what wrong quatermain he shout
everyth there is a plot to murder the queen tomorrow at

to leav now you would be seen and it would turn the fate
of the battl it is not half won yet the soldier would think

in a moment he wa down and at my bid umslopogaa sprang
into the empti saddl

he cast on glanc at us and accompani by hi staff gallop
off to join the advanc which by thi time wa ford the littl
brook that now ran red with the blood of the fallen
as for umslopogaa and myself we left that dread field as
arrow leav a bow and in a few minut had pass right out
of the sight of slaughter the smell of blood and the turmoil
and shout which onli came to our ear as a faint faroff
roar like the sound of distant breaker
chapter xxi
awai awai
at the top of the rise we halt for a second to breath our
hors and turn glanc at the battl beneath us which
illumin as it wa by the fierc rai of the sink sun stain
the whole scene red look from where we were more like some
wild titan pictur than an actual handtohand combat the
distinguish scenic effect from that distanc wa the countless
distinct flash of light reflect from the sword and spear
otherwis the panorama wa not so grand as might have been expect
the great green lap of sward in which the struggl wa be
fought out the bold round outlin of the hill behind and the
wide sweep of the plain beyond seem to dwarf it and what
wa tremend enough when on wa in it grew insignific
when view from the distanc but is it not thu with all the
affair and do of our race about which we blow the loud trumpet
and make such a fuss and worri how utterli antlik and moral
and physic insignific must thei seem to the calm ey
that watch them from the arch depth abov
we win the dai macumazahn said old umslopogaa take in
the whole situat with a glanc of hi practis ey look
the ladi of the night forc give on everi side there is no
stiff left in them thei bend like hot iron thei ar fight
with but half a heart but ala the battl will in a manner
be drawn for the dark gather and the regiment will not
be abl to follow and slai and he shook hi head sadli
but he ad i do not think that thei will fight again
we have fed them with too strong a meat ah it is well to
have live at last i have seen a fight worth see
by thi time we were on our wai again and as we went side by
side i told him what our mission wa and how that if it fail
all the live that had been lost that dai would have been lost
in vain
ah he said nigh on a hundr mile and no hors but these
and to be there befor the dawn well awai awai man can
but try macumazahn and mayhap we shall be there in time to
split that old witchfind agon skull for him onc
he want to burn us the old rainmak did he and now
he would set a snare for my mother nyleptha would he good
so sure as my name is the name of the woodpeck so sure
be my mother aliv or dead will i split him to the beard ay
by tchaka head i swear it and he shook inkosikaa as he
gallop by now the dark wa close in but fortun
there would be a moon later and the road wa good
on we sped through the twilight the two splendid hors we bestrod
had got their wind by thi and were sweep along with a wide
steadi stride that neither fail nor vari for mile upon mile
down the side of slope we gallop across wide vale that
stretch to the foot of faroff hill nearer and nearer grew
the blue hill now we were travel up their steep and now
we were over and pass toward other that sprang up like vision
in the far faint distanc beyond
on never paus or draw rein through the perfect quiet
of the night that wa set like a song to the fall music of
our hors hoof on past desert villag where onli some
forgotten starv dog howl a melancholi welcom on past
lone moat dwell on through the white patchi moonlight
that lai coldli upon the wide bosom of the earth as though there
wa no warmth in it on knee to knee for hour after hour
we spake not but bent us forward on the neck of those two gloriou
hors and listen to their deep longdrawn breath as thei
fill their great lung and to the regular unfalt ring
of their round hoof grim and black inde did old umslopogaa
look besid me mount upon the great white hors like death
in the revel of st john as now and again lift hi fierc
set face he gaze out along the road and point with hi ax
toward some distant rise or hous
and so on still on without break or paus for hour after hour
at last i felt that even the splendid anim that i rode wa
begin to give out i look at my watch it wa nearli midnight
and we were consider more than half wai on the top of a
rise wa a littl spring which i rememb becaus i had slept
by it a few night befor and here i motion to umslopogaa
to pull up have determin to give the hors and ourselv
ten minut to breath in he did so and we dismount that
is to sai umslopogaa did and then help me off for what
with fatigu stiff and the pain of my wound i could not
do so for myself and then the gallant hors stood pant there
rest first on leg and then anoth while the sweat fell
drip drip from them and the steam rose and hung in pale cloud
in the still night air
leav umslopogaa to hold the hors i hobbl to the spring
and drank deep of it sweet water i had had noth but a
singl mouth of wine sinc middai when the battl began
and i wa parch up though my fatigu wa too great to allow
me to feel hungri then have lave my fever head and hand
i return and the zulu went and drank next we allow the
hors to take a coupl of mouth each no more and oh
what a struggl we had to get the poor beast awai from the water
there were yet two minut and i emploi it in hobbl up
and down to try and reliev my stiff and in inspect the
condit of the hors my mare gallant anim though she
wa wa evid much distress she hung her head and her
ey look sick and dull but daylight nyleptha gloriou hors
who if he is serv aright should like the steed who save
great rames in hi need feed for the rest of hi dai out
of a golden manger wa still compar speak fresh
notwithstand the fact that he had had by far the heavier weight
to carri he wa tuck up inde and hi leg were weari
but hi ey wa bright and clear and he held hi shape head up
and gaze out into the dark round him in a wai that seem to
sai that whoever fail he wa good for those fiveandforti mile
that yet lai between us and milosi then umslopogaa help me
into the saddl and vigor old savag that he wa vault
into hi own without touch a stirrup and we were off onc more
slowli at first till the hors got into their stride and then
more swiftli so we pass over anoth ten mile and then came
a long weari rise of some six or seven mile and three time
did my poor black mare nearli come to the ground with me but on
the top she seem to gather herself togeth and rattl down
the slope with long convuls stride breath in gasp
we did that three or four mile more swiftli than ani sinc we
had start on our wild ride but i felt it to be a last effort
and i wa right suddenli my poor hors took the bit between her
teeth and bolt furious along a stretch of level ground for
some three or four hundr yard and then with two or three
jerki stride pull herself up and fell with a crash right on
to her head i roll myself free as she did so as i struggl
to my feet the brave beast rais her head and look at me with
piteou bloodshot ey and then her head drop with a groan
and she wa dead her heart wa broken
umslopogaa pull up besid the carcas and i look at him
in dismai there were still more than twenti mile to do by
dawn and how were we to do it with on hors it seem hopeless
but i had forgotten the old zulu extraordinari run power
without a singl word he sprang from the saddl and began to
hoist me into it
what wilt thou do i ask
run he answer seiz my stirrupleath
then off we went again almost as fast as befor and oh the
relief it wa to me to get that chang of hors anybodi who
ha ever ridden against time will know what it meant
daylight sped along at a long stretch handgallop give
the gaunt zulu a lift at everi stride it wa a wonder thing
to see old umslopogaa run mile after mile hi lip slightli
part and hi nostril agap like the hors everi five mile
or so we stop for a few minut to let him get hi breath
and then flew on again
canst thou go farther i said at the third of these stoppag
or shall i leav thee to follow me
he point with hi ax to a dim mass befor us it wa the
templ of the sun now not more than five mile awai
i reach it or i die he gasp
oh that last five mile the skin wa rub from the insid
of my leg and everi movement of my hors gave me anguish
nor wa that all i wa exhaust with toil want of food and
sleep and also suffer veri much from the blow i had receiv
on my left side it seem as though a piec of bone or someth
wa slowli pierc into my lung poor daylight too wa pretti
nearli finish and no wonder but there wa a smell of dawn
in the air and we might not stai better that all three of us
should die upon the road than that we should linger while there
wa life in us the air wa thick and heavi as it sometim
is befor the dawn break and anoth infal sign in
certain part of zuvendi that sunris is at hand hundr
of littl spider pendant on the end of long tough web were
float about in it these earlyris creatur or rather
their web caught upon the hors and our own form by score
and as we had neither the time nor the energi to brush them
off we rush along cover with hundr of long grei thread
that stream out a yard or more behind us and a veri strang
appear thei must have given us
and now befor us ar the huge brazen gate of the outer wall
of the frown citi and a new and horribl doubt strike me
what if thei will not let us in
open open i shout imperi at the same time give
the royal password open open a messeng a messeng
with tide of the war
what new cri the guard and who art thou that ridest
so madli and who is that whose tongu loll out and it actual
did and who run by thee like a dog by a chariot
it is the lord macumazahn and with him is hi dog hi black dog
open open i bring tide
the great gate ran back on their roller and the drawbridg
fell with a rattl crash and we dash on through the on
and over the other
what new my lord what new cri the guard
incubu roll sorai back as the wind a cloud i answer
and wa gone
on more effort gallant hors and yet more gallant man
so fall not now daylight and hold thy life in thee for fifteen
short minut more old zulu wardog and ye shall both live
for ever in the annal of the land
on clatter through the sleep street we ar pass
the flower templ now on mile more onli on littl mile
hold on keep your life in thee see the hous run past of
themselv up good hors up there but fifti yard now
ah you see your stabl and stagger on gallantli
thank god the palac at last and see the first arrow of
the dawn ar strike on the templ golden dome endnot 21
but shall i get in here or is the deed done and the wai bar
onc more i give the password and shout open open
no answer and my heart grow veri faint
again i call and thi time a singl voic repli and to my
joi i recogn it as belong to kara a fellowoffic of
nyleptha guard a man i know to be as honest as the light
inde the same whom nyleptha had sent to arrest sorai on
the dai she fled to the templ
is it thou kara i cry i am macumazahn bid the guard let

and she told me too that a rumour had spread through the town
that our armi had been utterli destroi and that sorai wa

chapter xxii
how umslopogaa held the stair
we look at on anoth
thou seest i said thei have taken awai the door is there
aught with which we mai fill the place speak quickli for thei
will be on us er the daylight i spoke thu becaus i knew
that we must hold thi place or none as there were no inner
door in the palac the room be separ on from anoth
by curtain i also knew that if we could by ani mean defend
thi doorwai the murder could get in nowher els for the
palac is absolut impregn that is sinc the secret door
by which sorai had enter on that memor night of attempt
murder had by nyleptha order been close up with masonri
i have it said nyleptha who as usual with her rose to the
emerg in a wonder wai on the farther side of the courtyard
ar block of cut marbl the workmen brought them there for
the bed of the new statu of incubu my lord let us block the
door with them
i jump at the idea and have despatch on of the remain
maiden down the great stair to see if she could obtain assist
from the dock below where her father who wa a great merchant
emploi mani men had hi dwellingplac and set anoth to
watch through the doorwai we made our wai back across the courtyard

block sure enough broad massiv lump some six inch thick
and weigh about eighti pound each and there too were a
coupl of implement like small stretcher that the workmen

i need my strength and without a word he went outsid and flung
himself down on the marbl and wa instantli asleep
at thi time i too wa overcom and wa forc to sit down
by the doorwai and content myself with direct oper
the girl brought the block while kara and nyleptha built them
up across the sixfootwid doorwai a tripl row of them for
less would be useless but the marbl had to be brought forti
yard and then there were forti yard to run back and though
the girl labour glorious even stagger along alon each
with a block in her arm it wa slow work dreadfulli slow
the light wa grow now and present in the silenc we
heard a commot at the farbottom of the stair and the faint
clink of arm men as yet the wall wa onli two feet high
and we had been eight minut at the build of it so thei
had come alphons had heard aright
the clank sound came nearer and in the ghostli grei of the

down the step as he drop hi round hippopotamushid shield
fell from hi hand on to the marbl and the zulu stoop down
and seiz it still chant as he did so
in anoth second the sturdi kara had also slain a man and then
began a scene the like of which ha not been known to me
up rush the assail on two three at a time and as fast
as thei came the ax crash and the sword swung and down thei

at last kara sword broke and he grappl with a foe and thei
roll down togeth and he wa cut to piec dy like the
brave man that he wa
umslopogaa wa alon now but he never blench or turn
shout out some wild zulu battlecri he beat down a foe ay
and anoth and anoth till at last thei drew back from the
slipperi bloodstain step and stare at him with amaz
think that he wa no mortal man
the wall of marbl block wa four feet six high now and hope
rose in my teeth as i lean there against it a miser helpless
log and ground my teeth and watch that gloriou struggl
i could do no more for i had lost my revolv in the battl
and old umslopogaa he lean too on hi good ax and faint

the grand old warrior stand there on against so mani
and for a breath space none would come against him notwithstand
nasta exhort till at last old agon who to do him justic
wa a brave man mad with baffl rage and see that the
wall would soon be built and hi plan defeat shook the great
spear he held and rush up the drip step
ah ah shout the zulu as he recogn the priest flow

thee white medicin man come on come on i have sworn to
slai thee and i ever keep my faith
on he came take him at hi word and drave the big spear with
such forc at umslopogaa that it sunk right through the tough
shield and pierc him in the neck the zulu cast down the transfix
shield and that moment wa agon last for befor he could
free hi spear and strike again with a shout of there for
thee rainmak umslopogaa grip inkosikaa with both
hand and whirl on high and drave her right on to hi vener
head so that agon roll down dead among the corps of hi
fellowmurder and there wa an end to him and hi plot altogeth
and even as he fell a great cry rose from the foot of the stair
and look out through the portion of the doorwai that wa yet
unclos we saw arm men rush up to the rescu and call
an answer to their shout then the wouldb murder who yet
remain on the stairwai and amongst whom i saw sever priest
turn to fly but have nowher to go were butcher as thei
fled onli on man stai and he wa the great lord nasta
nyleptha suitor and the father of the plot for a moment
the blackbeard nasta stood with bow face lean on hi
long sword as though in despair and then with a dread shout
he too rush up at the zulu and swing the glitter sword
around hi head dealt him such a mighti blow beneath hi guard
that the keen steel of the heavi blade bit right through the
chain armour and deep into umslopogaa side for a moment
paralys him and caus him to drop hi ax
rais the sword again nasta sprang forward to make an end
of him but littl he knew hi foe with a shake and a yell
of furi the zulu gather himself togeth and sprang straight
at nasta throat as i have sometim seen a wound lion spring
he struck him full as hi foot wa on the topmost stair and
hi long arm close round him like iron band down thei roll
togeth struggl furious nasta wa a strong man and a
desper but he could not match the strongest man in zululand
sore wound though he wa whose strength wa as the strength
of a bull in a minut the end came i saw old umslopogaa
stagger to hi feet ay and saw him by a singl gigant effort
swing up the struggl nasta and with a shout of triumph hurl
him straight over the parapet of the bridg to be crush to
powder on the rock two hundr feet below
the succour which had been summon by the girl who had pass
down the stair befor the assassin pass up wa at hand and
the loud shout which reach us from the outer gate told us
that the town wa also arous and the men awaken by the women
were call to be admit some of nyleptha brave ladi
who in their nightshift and with their long hair stream
down their back just as thei had been arous from rest went
off to admit them at the side entranc whilst other assist
by the rescu parti outsid push and pull down the marbl
block thei had place there with so much labour
soon the wall wa down again and through the doorwai follow
by a crowd of rescuer stagger old umslopogaa an aw and
in a wai a gloriou figur the man wa a mass of wound and
a glanc at hi wild ey told me that he wa dy the keshla
gumr upon hi head wa sever in two place by swordcut
on just over the curiou hole in hi skull and the blood pour
down hi face from the gash also on the right side of hi
neck wa a stab from a spear inflict by agon there wa a
deep cut on hi left arm just below where the mail shirtsleev
stop and on the right side of hi bodi the armour wa sever
by a gash six inch long where nasta mighti sword had bitten
through it and deep into it wearer vital
on ax in hand he stagger that dreadfullook splendid
savag and the ladi forgot to turn faint at the scene of blood
and cheer him as well thei might but he never stai or heed
with outstretch arm and totter gait he pursu hi wai
follow by us all along the broad shellstrewn walk that ran
through the courtyard past the spot where the block of marbl
lai through the round arch doorwai and the thick curtain
that hung within it down the short passag and into the great
hall which wa now fill with hastilyarm men who pour
through the side entranc straight up the hall he went leav
behind him a track of blood on the marbl pavement till at last
he reach the sacr stone which stood in the centr of it
and here hi strength seem to fail him for he stop and
lean upon hi ax then suddenli he lift up hi voic and
cri aloud
i die i die but it wa a kingli frai where ar thei who
came up the great stair i see them not art thou there macumazahn
or art thou gone befor to wait for me in the dark whither i
go the blood blind me the place turn round i hear the
voic of water
next as though a new thought had struck him he lift the red
ax and kiss the blade
farewel inkosikaa he cri nai nai we will go togeth
we cannot part thou and i we have live too long on with
anoth thou and i
on more stroke onli on a good stroke a straight stroke
a strong stroke and draw himself to hi full height with
a wild heartshak shout he with both hand began to whirl
the ax round hi head till it look like a circl of flame steel
then suddenli with aw forc he brought it down straight
on to the crown of the mass of sacr stone a shower of spark
flew up and such wa the almost superhuman strength of the blow
that the massiv marbl split with a rend sound into a score
of piec whilst of inkosikaa there remain but some fragment
of steel and a fibrou rope of shatter horn that had been the
handl down with a crash on to the pavement fell the fragment
of the holi stone and down with a crash on to them still grasp
the knob of inkosikaa fell the brave old zulu dead
and thu the hero di
a gasp of wonder and astonish rose from all those who wit
the extraordinari sight and then somebodi cri the propheci
the propheci he ha shatter the sacr stone and at onc
a murmur aros
ay said nyleptha with that quick wit which distinguish
her ay my peopl he ha shatter the stone and behold
the propheci is fulfil for a stranger king rule in zuvendi
incubu my lord hath beat sorai back and i fear her no more
and to him who hath save the crown it shall sure be and
thi man she said turn to me and lai her hand upon my
shoulder wot ye that though wound in the fight of yesterdai
he rode with that old warrior who li there on hundr mile
twixt sun set and rise to save me from the plot of cruel men
ay and he ha save me by a veri littl and therefor becaus
of the deed that thei have done deed of glori such as our
histori cannot show the like therefor i sai that the name
of macumazahn and the name of dead umslopogaa ay and the name
of kara my servant who aid him to hold the stair shall be
blazon in letter of gold abov my throne and shall be gloriou
for ever while the land endur i the queen have said it
thi spirit speech wa met with loud cheer and i said that
after all we had onli done our duti as it is the fashion of
both englishmen and zulu to do and there wa noth to make
an outcri about at which thei cheer still more and then i
wa support across the outer courtyard to my old quarter
in order that i might be put to bed as i went my ey lit
upon the brave hors daylight that lai there hi white head
outstretch on the pavement exactli as he had fallen on enter
the yard and i bade those who support me take me near him
that i might look on the good beast onc more befor he wa drag
awai and as i look to my astonish he open hi ey
and lift hi head a littl whinni faintli i could have
shout for joi to find that he wa not dead onli unfortun
i had not a shout left in me but as it wa groom were sent
for and he wa lift up and wine pour down hi throat and
in a fortnight he wa as well and strong as ever and is the
pride and joi of all the peopl of milosi who whenev thei
see him point him out to the littl children as the hors which
save the white queen life
then i went on and got off to bed and wa wash and had my
mail shirt remov thei hurt me a great deal in get it
off and no wonder for on my left breast and side wa a black
bruis the size of a saucer
the next thing that i rememb wa the tramp of horsemen outsid
the palac wall some ten hour later i rais myself and ask
what wa the new and thei told me that a larg bodi of cavalri
sent by curti to assist the queen had arriv from the scene
of the battl which thei had left two hour after sundown
when thei left the wreck of sorai armi wa in full retreat
upon marstuna follow by all our effect cavalri sir henri
wa encamp the remain of hi wornout forc on the site
such is the fortun of war that sorai had occupi the night
befor and propos march to marstuna on the morrow have
heard thi i felt that i could die with a light heart and then
everyth becam a blank
when next i awok the first thing i saw wa the round disc of
a sympathet eyeglass behind which wa good
how ar you get on old chap said a voic from the
neighbourhood of the eyeglass
what ar you do here i ask faintli you ought to be
at marstuna have you run awai or what
marstuna he repli cheerfulli ah marstuna fell last
week youv been unconsci for a fortnight you see with
all the honour of war you know trumpet blow flag fly
just as though thei had had the best of it but for all that
werent thei glad to go israel made for hi tent i can tell
you never saw such a sight in my life
and sorai i ask
sorai oh sorai is a prison thei gave her up the scoundrel
he ad with a chang of tone sacrif the queen to save
their skin you see she is be brought up here and i dont
know what will happen to her poor soul and he sigh
where is curti i ask
he is with nyleptha she rode out to meet us todai and there
wa a grand todo i can tell you he is come to see you tomorrow
the doctor for there is a medic faculti in zuvendi as
elsewher thought that he had better not come todai
i said noth but somehow i thought to myself that notwithstand
the doctor he might have given me a look but there when a
man is newli marri and ha just gain a great victori he
is apt to listen to the advic of doctor and quit right too
just then i heard a familiar voic inform me that monsieur
must now couch himself and look up perceiv alphons
enorm black mustachio curl awai in the distanc
so you ar here i said
mai oui monsieur the war is now finish my militari instinct
ar satisfi and i return to nurs monsieur
i laugh or rather tri to but whatev mai have been alphons
fail as a warrior and i fear that he did not come up to
the level of hi heroic grandfath in thi particular show
therebi how true is the sai that it is a bad thing to be
overshadow by some great ancestr name a better or kinder
nurs never live poor alphons i hope he will alwai think
of me as kindli as i think of him
on the morrow i saw curti and nyleptha with him and he told
me the whole histori of what had happen sinc umslopogaa and
i gallop wildli awai from the battl to save the life of the
queen it seem to me that he had manag the thing exceedingli
well and show great abil as a gener of cours howev
our loss had been dreadfulli heavi inde i am afraid to
sai how mani perish in the desper battl i have describ
but i know that the slaughter ha appreci affect the male
popul of the countri he wa veri pleas to see me dear
fellow that he is and thank me with tear in hi ey for
the littl that i had been abl to do i saw him howev start
violent when hi ey fell upon my face
as for nyleptha she wa posit radiant now that her dear
lord had come back with no other injuri than an ugli scar on
hi forehead i do not believ that she allow all the fear
slaughter that had taken place to weigh ever so littl in the
balanc against thi on fact or even to greatli diminish her
joi and i cannot blame her for it see that it is the natur
of love woman to look at all thing through the spectacl
of her love and littl doe she reck of the miseri of the mani
if the happi of the on be assur that is human natur
which the positivist tell us is just perfect so no doubt
it is all right
and what art thou go to do with sorai i ask her
instantli her bright brow darken to a frown
sorai she said with a littl stamp of the foot
ah but sorai
sir henri hasten to turn the subject
you will soon be about and all right again now old fellow
he said
i shook my head and laugh
dont deceiv yourselv i said i mai be about for a littl
but i shall never be all right again i am a dy man curti
i mai die slow but die i must do you know i have been spit
blood all the morn i tell you there is someth work
awai into my lung i can feel it there dont look distress
i have had my dai and am readi to go give me the mirror will you
i want to look at myself
he made some excus but i saw through it and insist and at
last he hand me on of the disc of polish silver set in a
wooden frame like a handscreen which serv as lookingglass
in zuvendi i look and put it down
ah i said quietli i thought so and you talk of my get
all right i did not like to let them see how shock i realli
wa at my own appear my grizzl stubbi hair wa turn
snowwhit and my yellow face wa shrunk like an ag woman
and had two deep purpl ring paint beneath the ey
here nyleptha began to cry and sir henri again turn the subject
tell me that the artist had taken a cast of the dead bodi
of old umslopogaa and that a great statu in black marbl wa
to be erect of him in the act of split the sacr stone
which wa to be match by anoth statu in white marbl of
myself and the hors daylight as he appear when at the termin
of that wild ride he sank beneath me in the courtyard of the
palac i have sinc seen these statu which at the time of
write thi six month after the battl ar nearli finish
and veri beauti thei ar especi that of umslopogaa
which is exactli like him as for that of myself it is good
but thei have ideal my ugli face a littl which is perhap
as well see that thousand of peopl will probabl look at
it in the centuri to come and it is not pleasant to look at
ugli thing
then thei told me that umslopogaa last wish had been carri
out and that instead of be cremat as i shall be after
the usual custom here he had been ti up zulu fashion with
hi knee beneath hi chin and have been wrap in a thin
sheet of beaten gold entomb in a hole hollow out of the
masonri of the semicircular space at the top of the stair he
defend so splendidli which face as far as we can judg
almost exactli toward zululand there he sit and will sit
for ever for thei embalm him with spice and put him in an
airtight stone coffer keep hi grim watch beneath the spot
he held alon against a multitud and the peopl sai that at
night hi ghost rise and stand shake the phantom of inkosikaa
at phantom foe certainli thei fear dure the dark hour to
pass the place where the hero is buri
oddli enough too a new legend or propheci ha arisen in the
land in that unaccount wai in which such thing to aris
among barbar and semicivil peopl blow like the
wind no man know whenc accord to thi sai so long
as the old zulu sit there look down the stairwai he defend
when aliv so long will the new hous of the stairwai spring
from the union of the englishman and nyleptha endur and flourish
but when he is taken from thenc or when ag after hi bone
at last crumbl into dust the hous will fall and the stairwai
shall fall and the nation of the zuvendi shall ceas to be
a nation
chapter xxiii
i have spoken
it wa a week after nyleptha visit when i had begun to get
about a littl in the middl of the dai that a messag came
to me from sir henri to sai that sorai would be brought befor
them in the queen first antechamb at middai and request
my attend if possibl accordingli greatli drawn by curios
to see thi unhappi woman onc more i made shift with the help
of that kind littl fellow alphons who is a perfect treasur
to me and that of anoth waitingman to reach the antechamb
i got there inde befor anybodi els except a few of the
great court offici who had been bidden to be present but
i had scarc seat myself befor sorai wa brought in by
a parti of guard look as beauti and defiant as ever
but with a worn express on her proud face she wa as usual
dress in her royal kaf emblazon with the emblem of the
sun and in her right hand she still held the toi spear of silver
a pang of admir and piti went through me as i look at
her and struggl to my feet i bow deepli at the same time
express my sorrow that i wa not abl ow to my condit
to remain stand befor her
she colour a littl and then laugh bitterli thou dost
forget macumazahn she said i am no more a queen save in
blood i am an outcast and a prison on whom all men should
scorn and none show defer to
at least i repli thou art still a ladi and therefor
on to whom defer is due also thou art in an evil case
and therefor it is doubli due
ah she answer with a littl laugh thou dost forget that
i would have wrap thee in a sheet of gold and hung thee to
the angel trumpet at the topmost pinnacl of the templ
no i answer i assur thee that i forgot it not inde
i often thought of it when it seem to me that the battl of
the pass wa turn against us but the trumpet is there and
i am still here though perchanc not for long so why talk of
it now
ah she went on the battl the battl oh would that i

methink my sister the queen hath forgotten the chief count
of the indict answer sorai in her slow music tone

incubu it is for thi crime that my sister will slai me not
becaus i levi war it is perchanc happi for thee nyleptha
that i fix my mind upon hi love too late

me even as thou wilt o queen and let my lord the king there
point to sir henri for now will he be king carri
out the sentenc as it is meet he should for as he is the begin
of the evil let him also be the end and she drew herself
up and shot on angri glanc at him from her deep fring ey
and then began to toi with her spear
sir henri bent toward nyleptha and whisper someth that
i could not catch and then the queen spoke
sorai ever have i been a good sister to thee when our father
di and there wa much talk in the land as to whether thou
shouldst sit upon the throne with me i be the elder i gave
my voic for thee and said nai let her sit she is twin with

befor the other and so ha it ever been twixt thee and me
my sister but now thou knowest in what sort thou hast repaid
me but i have prevail and thy life is forfeit sorai and
yet art thou my sister born at a birth with me and we plai
togeth when we were littl and love each other much and at
night we slept in the same cot with our arm each around the
other neck and therefor even now doe my heart go out to
thee sorai
but not for that would i spare thy life for thy offenc ha

even to the ground also while thou dost live the land will

beg thy life of me as a boon therefor as a boon and as a
marriag gift give i it to him to do with even as he will

for all thy beauti nai though thou art love as the night

sorai flush up to her ey and said noth and i do not
think that i ever saw a man look more miser than did sir
henri at that moment somehow nyleptha wai of put the
thing though true and forcibl enough wa not altogeth pleasant
i understand stammer curti look at good i understood
that he were attach eh attach to to the queen sorai
i am eh not awar what the in short the state of your
feel mai be just now but if thei happen to be that wai
inclin it ha struck me that in short it might put a satisfactori
end to an unpleas busi the ladi also ha ampl privat
estat where i am sure she would be at liberti to live unmolest
as far as we ar concern eh nyleptha of cours i onli
suggest
so far as i am concern said good colour up i am quit
will to forget the past and if the ladi of the night think
me worth the take i will marri her tomorrow or when she like
and try to make her a good husband
all ey were now turn to sorai who stood with that same
slow smile upon her beauti face which i had notic the first
time that i ever saw her she paus a littl while and clear
her throat and then thrice she curtsei low onc to nyleptha
onc to curti and onc to good and began to speak in measur tone
i thank thee most graciou queen and royal sister for the
lovingkind thou hast shown me from my youth up and especi
in that thou hast been pleas to give my person and my fate
as a gift to the lord incubu the king that is to be mai
prosper peac and plenti deck the lifepath of on so merci
and so tender even as flower do long mayst thou reign o
great and gloriou queen and hold thy husband love in both
thy hand and mani be the son and daughter of thy beauti
and i thank thee my lord incubu the king that is to be
i thank thee a thousand time in that thou hast been pleas
to accept that graciou gift and to pass it on to thy comrad
in arm and in adventur the lord bougwan sure the act is
worthi of thy great my lord incubu and now lastli i
thank thee also my lord bougwan who in thy turn hast deign
to accept me and my poor beauti i thank thee a thousand time
and i will add that thou art a good and honest man and i put
my hand upon my heart and swear that i would that i could sai
thee yea and now that i have render thank to all in turn
and again she smile i will add on short word
littl can you understand of me queen nyleptha and my lord
if ye know not that for me there is no middl path that i scorn
your piti and hate you for it that i cast off your forgiv
as though it were a serpent sting and that stand here
betrai desert insult and alon i yet triumph over you
mock you and defi you on and all and thu i answer you
and then of a sudden befor anybodi guess what she intend
to do she drove the littl silver spear she carri in her hand
into her side with such a strong and steadi aim that the keen
point project through her back and she fell prone upon the
pavement
nyleptha shriek and poor good almost faint at the sight
while the rest of us rush toward her but sorai of the night
lift herself upon her hand and for a moment fix her gloriou
ey intent on curti face as though there were some messag
in the glanc then drop her head and sigh and with a sob
her dark but splendid spirit pass
well thei gave her a royal funer and there wa an end of her
it wa a month after the last act of the sorai tragedi that
a great ceremoni wa held in the flower templ and curti wa
formal declar kingconsort of zuvendi i wa too ill to
go myself and inde i hate all that sort of thing with the
crowd and the trumpetblow and bannerwav but good who
wa there in hi fulldress uniform came back much impress
and told me that nyleptha had look love and curti had born
himself in a right royal fashion and had been receiv with
acclam that left no doubt as to hi popular also he
told me that when the hors daylight wa led along in the process
the populac had shout macumazahn macumazahn till thei
were hoars and would onli be appeas when he good rose in
hi chariot and told them that i wa too ill to be present
afterward too sir henri or rather the king came to see me
look veri tire and vow that he had never been so bore
in hi life but i dare sai that that wa a slight exagger
it is not in human natur that a man should be altogeth bore
on such an extraordinari occas and inde as i point
out to him it wa a marvel thing that a man who but littl
more than on short year befor had enter a great countri as
an unknown wander should todai be marri to it beauti
and belov queen and lift amidst public rejoic to it
throne i even went the length to exhort him in the futur not
to be carri awai by the pride and pomp of absolut power but
alwai to strive to rememb that he wa first a christian gentleman
and next a public servant call by provid to a great and
almost unpreced trust these remark which he might fairli
have resent he wa so good as to receiv with patienc and
even to thank me for make them
it wa immedi after thi ceremoni that i caus myself to
be move to the hous where i am now write it is a veri pleasant
countri seat situat about two mile from the frown citi
on to which it look that wa five month ago dure the whole
of which time i have be confin to a kind of couch emploi
my leisur in compil thi histori of our wander from my
journal and from our joint memori it is probabl that it
will never be read but it doe not much matter whether it is
or not at ani rate it ha serv to while awai mani hour of
suffer for i have suffer a deal of pain late thank god
howev there will not be much more of it
it is a week sinc i wrote the abov and now i take up my pen
for the last time for i know that the end is at hand my brain
is still clear and i can manag to write though with difficulti
the pain in my lung which ha been veri bad dure the last
week ha suddenli quit left me and been succeed by a feel
of numb of which i cannot mistak the mean and just
as the pain ha gone so with it all fear of that end ha depart
and i feel onli as though i were go to sink into the arm
of an unutter rest happili contentedli and with the same
sens of secur with which an infant lai itself to sleep in
it mother arm do i lai myself down in the arm of the angel
death all the tremor all the heartshak fear which have
haunt me through a life that seem long as i look back upon
it have left me now the storm have pass and the star of
our etern hope shine clear and steadi on the horizon that
seem so far from man and yet is so veri near to me tonight
and so thi is the end of it a brief space of troubl
a few restless fever anguish year and then the arm of
that great angel death mani time have i been near to them
and now it is my turn at last and it is well twentyfour hour
more and the world will be gone from me and with it all it
hope and all it fear the air will close in over the space
that my form fill and my place know me no more for the dull
breath of the world forget will first dim the bright
of my memori and then blot it out for ever and of a truth i
shall be dead so is it with us all how mani million have
lain as i lie and thought these thought and been forgotten
thousand upon thousand of year ago thei thought them those
dy men of the dim past and thousand on thousand of year
henc will their descend think them and be in their turn
forgotten as the breath of the oxen in winter as the quick
star that run along the sky as a littl shadow that lose itself
at sunset as i onc heard a zulu call ignosi put it such
is the order of our life the order that passeth awai
well it is not a good world nobodi can sai that it is save
those who wilfulli blind themselv to fact how can a world
be good in which monei is the move power and selfinterest
the guid star the wonder is not that it is so bad but that
there should be ani good left in it
still now that my life is over i am glad to have live glad
to have known the dear breath of woman love and that true
friendship which can even surpass the love of woman glad to
have heard the laughter of littl children to have seen the
sun and the moon and the star to have felt the kiss of the
salt sea on my face and watch the wild game trek down to the
water in the moonlight but i should not wish to live again
everyth is chang to me the dark draw near and the
light depart and yet it seem to me that through that dark
i can alreadi see the shine welcom of mani a longlost face
harri is there and other on abov all to my mind the sweetest
and most perfect woman that ever gladden thi grei earth
but of her i have alreadi written elsewher and at length so
why speak of her now why speak of her after thi long silenc
now that she is again so near to me now that i go where she
ha gone
the sink sun is turn the golden roof of the great templ
to a fieri flame and my finger tire
so to all who have known me or known of me to all who can think
on kindli thought of the old hunter i stretch out my hand from
the faroff shore and bid a long farewel
and now into the hand of almighti god who sent it do i commit
my spirit
i have spoken as the zulu sai
chapter xxiv
by anoth hand
a year ha elaps sinc our most dear friend allan quatermain
wrote the word i have spoken at the end of hi record of
our adventur nor should i have ventur to make ani addit
to the record had it not happen that by a most strang accid
a chanc ha arisen of it be convei to england the chanc
is but a faint on it is true but as it is not probabl that
anoth will aris in our lifetim good and myself think that
we mai as well avail ourselv of it such as it is dure the
last six month sever frontier commiss have been at work
on the variou boundari of zuvendi with a view of discov
whether there exist ani possibl mean of ingress or egress from
the countri with the result that a channel of commun
with the outer world hitherto overlook ha been discov
thi channel appar the onli on for i have discov that
it wa by it that the nativ who ultim reach mr mackenzi
mission station and whose arriv in the countri togeth with
the fact of hi expuls for he did arriv about three
year befor ourselv wa for reason of their own kept a
dead secret by the priest to whom he wa brought is about
to be effectu close but befor thi is done a messeng
is to be despatch bear with him thi manuscript and also
on or two letter from good to hi friend and from myself
to my brother georg whom it deepli griev me to think i shall
never see again inform them as our next heir that thei
ar welcom to our effect in england if the court of probat
will allow them to take them endnot 22 inasmucha we have
made up our mind never to return to europ inde it would
be imposs for us to leav zuvendi even if we wish to do so
the messeng who is to go and i wish him joi of hi journei
is alphons for a long while he ha been weari to death
of zuvendi and it inhabit oh oui cest beau he
sai with an express shrug mai je mennui ce nest pa
chic again he complain dreadfulli of the absenc of cafe
and theatr and moan continu for hi lost annett of
whom he sai he dream three time a week but i fanci hi secret
caus of disgust at the countri put asid the homesick
to which everi frenchman is subject is that the peopl here laugh
at him so dreadfulli about hi conduct on the occas of the
great battl of the pass about eighteen month ago when he hid
beneath a banner in soraiss tent in order to avoid be sent
forth to fight which he sai would have gone against hi conscienc
even the littl boi call out at him in the street therebi
offend hi pride and make hi life unbear at ani rate
he ha determin to brave the horror of a journei of almost
unpreced difficulti and danger and also to run the risk
of fall into the hand of the french polic to answer for
a certain littl indiscret of hi own some year old though
i do not consid that a veri seriou matter rather than remain
in ce trist pai poor alphons we shall be veri sorri to
part with him but i sincer trust for hi own sake and also
for the sake of thi histori which is i think worth give
to the world that he mai arriv in safeti if he doe and
can carri the treasur we have provid him with in the shape
of bar of solid gold he will be compar speak a
rich man for life and well abl to marri hi annett if she
is still in the land of the live and will to marri her alphons
anyhow on the chanc i mai as well add a word or two to
dear old quatermain narr
he di at dawn on the dai follow that on which he wrote the
last word of the last chapter nyleptha good and myself were
present and a most touch and yet in it wai beauti scene
it wa an hour befor the daybreak it becam appar to us
that he wa sink and our distress wa veri keen inde
good melt into tear at the idea a fact that call forth
a last gentl flicker of humour from our dy friend for even
at that hour he could be humor good emot had by loosen
the muscl natur caus hi eyeglass to fall from it accustom
place and quatermain who alwai observ everyth observ
thi also
at last he gasp with an attempt at a smile i have seen
good without hi eyeglass
after that he said no more till the dai broke when he ask
to be lift up to watch the rise of the sun for the last time
in a veri few minut he said after gaze earnestli at it
i shall have pass through those golden gate
ten minut afterward he rais himself and look us fixedli
in the face
i am go a stranger journei than ani we have ever taken togeth
think of me sometim he murmur god bless you all
i shall wait for you and with a sigh he fell back dead
and so pass awai a charact that i consid went as near perfect
as ani it ha ever been my lot to encount
tender constant humor and possess of mani of the qualiti
that go to make a poet he wa yet almost unrival as a man
of action and a citizen of the world i never knew ani on so
compet to form an accur judgment of men and their motiv
i have studi human natur all my life he would sai and
i ought to know someth about it and he certainli did
he had but two fault on wa hi excess modesti and the
other a slight tendenc which he had to be jealou of anybodi
on whom he concentr hi affect as regard the first
of these point anybodi who read what he ha written will be
abl to form hi own opinion but i will add on last instanc of it
as the reader will doubtless rememb it is a favourit trick
of hi to talk of himself as a timid man wherea realli though
veri cautiou he possess a most intrepid spirit and what
is more never lost hi head well in the great battl of the
pass where he got the wound that final kill him on would
imagin from the account which he give of the occurr that
it wa a chanc blow that fell on him in the scrimmag as a
matter of fact howev he wa wound in a most gallant and
success attempt to save good life at the risk and as it
ultim turn out at the cost of hi own good wa down
on the ground and on of nasta highland wa about to dispatch
him when quatermain threw himself on to hi prostrat form and
receiv the blow on hi own bodi and then rise kill the
soldier
as regard hi jealousi a singl instanc which i give in justic
to myself and nyleptha will suffic the reader will perhap
recollect that in on or two place he speak as though nyleptha
monopol me and he wa left by both of us rather out in the
cold now nyleptha is not perfect ani more than ani other woman
is and she mai be a littl exigeant at time but as regard
quatermain the whole thing is pure imagin thu when he
complain about my not come to see him when he is ill the
fact wa that in spite of my entreati the doctor posit
forbad it those littl remark of hi pain me veri much
when i read them for i love quatermain as dearli as though
he were my own father and should never have dream of allow
my marriag to interfer with that affect but let it pass
it is after all but on littl weak which make no great
show among so mani and such lovabl virtu
well he di and good read the burial servic over him in the
presenc of nyleptha and myself and then hi remain were in
defer to the popular clamour accord a great public funer
or rather cremat i could not help think howev as
i march in that long and splendid process up to the templ
how he would have hate the whole thing could he have been there
to see it for he had a horror of ostent
and so a few minut befor sunset on the third night after
hi death thei laid him on the brazen floor befor the altar
and wait for the last rai of the set sun to fall upon hi
face present it came and struck him like a golden arrow
crown the pale brow with glori and then the trumpet blew
and the floor revolv and all that remain of our belov
friend fell into the furnac below
we shall never see hi like again if we live a hundr year
he wa the ablest man the truest gentleman the firmest friend
the finest sportsman and i believ the best shot in all africa
and so end the veri remark and adventur life of
hunter quatermain
sinc then thing have gone veri well with us good ha been
and still is busili emploi in the construct of a navi on
lake milosi and anoth of the larg lake by mean of which
we hope to be abl to increas trade and commerc and also to
overcom some veri troublesom and warlik section of the popul
who live upon their border poor fellow he is begin to
get over the sad death of that misguid but most attract
woman sorai but it is a sad blow to him for he wa realli
deepli attach to her i hope howev that he will in time
make a suitabl marriag and get that unhappi busi out of
hi head nyleptha ha on or two young ladi in view especi
a daughter of nasta who wa a widow a veri fine imperiallook
girl but with too much of her father intrigu and yet haughti
spirit to suit my tast
as for myself i should scarc know where to begin if i set
to work to describ my do so i had best leav them undescrib
and content myself with sai that on the whole i am get
on veri well in my curiou posit of kingconsort better
inde than i had ani right to expect but of cours it is
not all plain sail and i find the respons veri heavi
still i hope to be abl to do some good in my time and i intend
to devot myself to two great end name to the consolid
of the variou clan which togeth make up the zuvendi peopl
under on strong central govern and to the sap of the
power of the priesthood the first of these reform will if
it can be carri out put an end to the disastr civil war
that have for centuri devast thi countri and the second
besid remov a sourc of polit danger will pave the
road for the introduct of true religion in the place of thi
senseless sun worship i yet hope to see the shadow of the cross
of christ ly on the golden dome of the flower templ or
if i do not that my successor mai
there is on more thing that i intend to devot myself to and
that is the total exclus of all foreign from zuvendi
not inde that ani more ar ever like to get here but
if thei do i warn them fairli that thei will be shown the shortest
wai out of the countri i do not sai thi from ani sens of
inhospit but becaus i am convinc of the sacr duti
that rest upon me of preserv to thi on the whole upright
and generousheart peopl the bless of compar barbar
where would all my brave armi be if some enterpris rascal
were to attack us with fieldgun and martinihenri i cannot
see that gunpowd telegraph steam daili newspap univers
suffrag etc etc have made mankind on whit the happier
than thei us to be and i am certain that thei have brought
mani evil in their train i have no fanci for hand over
thi beauti countri to be torn and fought for by specul
tourist politician and teacher whose voic is as the voic
of babel just as those horribl creatur in the vallei of the
underground river tore and fought for the bodi of the wild swan
nor will i endow it with the greed drunken new diseas
gunpowd and gener demor which chiefli mark the
progress of civil amongst unsophist peopl if
in due cours it pleas provid to throw zuvendi open to
the world that is anoth matter but of myself i will not take
the respons and i mai add that good entir approv

note by georg curti esq

my dear brother henri curti whom we had given up for dead
and bear the aden postmark reach me in safeti on decemb
20 18 or a littl more than two year after it left hi hand
in the far centr of africa and i hasten to give the astonish
stori it contain to the world speak for myself i have
read it with veri mix feel for though it is a great relief
to know that he and good ar aliv and strang prosper
i cannot but feel that for me and for all their friend thei
might as well be dead sinc we can never hope to see them more
thei have cut themselv off from old england and from their
home and their relat for ever and perhap under the
circumst thei were right and wise to do so
how the ms came to be post i have been quit unabl to discov
but i presum from the fact of it be post at all that
the littl frenchman alphons accomplish hi hazard journei
in safeti i have howev advertis for him and caus variou
inquiri to be made in marseil and elsewher with a view
of discov hi whereabout but so far without the slightest
success possibl he is dead and the packet wa post by anoth
hand or possibl he is now happili wed to hi annett but
still fear the vengeanc of the law and prefer to remain incognito
i cannot sai i have not yet abandon my hope of find him
but i am bound to sai that thei grow fainter dai by dai and
on great obstacl to my search is that nowher in the whole
histori doe mr quatermain mention hi surnam he is alwai
spoken of as alphons and there ar so mani alphons
the letter which my brother henri sai he is send with the
