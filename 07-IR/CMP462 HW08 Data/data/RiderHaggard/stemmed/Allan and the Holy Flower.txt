brother john
i do not suppos that anyon who know the name of allan quatermain
would be like to associ it with flower and especi with
orchid yet as it happen it wa onc my lot to take part in an orchid
hunt of so remark a charact that i think it detail should not
be lost at least i will set them down and if in the after dai anyon
care to publish them wellh is at liberti to do so
it wa in the yearoh never mind the year it wa a long while ago
when i wa much younger that i went on a hunt expedit to the
north of the limpopo river which border the transvaal my companion wa
a gentleman of the name of scroop charl scroop he had come out to
durban from england in search of sport at least that wa on of hi
reason the other wa a ladi whom i will call miss margaret manner
though that wa not her name
it seem that these two were engag to be marri and realli attach
to each other unfortun howev thei quarrel violent about
anoth gentlemen with whom miss manner danc four consecut danc
includ two that were promis to her fianc at a hunt ball in essex
where thei all live explan or rather argument follow mr
scroop said that he would not toler such conduct miss manner
repli that she would not be dictat to she wa her own mistress and
meant to remain so mr scroop exclaim that she might so far as he
wa concern she answer that she never wish to see hi face again
he declar with emphasi that she never should and that he wa go to
africa to shoot eleph
what is more he went start from hi essex home the next dai without
leav ani address as it transpir afterward long afterward had
he wait till the post came in he would have receiv a letter that
might have chang hi plan but thei were highspirit young peopl
both of them and plai the fool after the fashion of those in love
well charl scroop turn up in durban which wa but a poor place
then and there we met in the bar of the royal hotel
if you want to kill big game i heard some on sai who it wa
i realli forget there the man to show you how to do ithunt
quatermain the best shot in africa and on of the finest fellow too
i sat still smoke my pipe and pretend to hear noth it is
awkward to listen to oneself be prais and i wa alwai a shy man
then after a whisper colloqui mr scroop wa brought forward and
introduc to me i bow as nice as i could and ran my ey over him
he wa a tall young man with dark ey and a rather romant aspect
that wa due to hi love affair but i came to the conclus that i
like the cut of hi jib when he spoke that conclus wa affirm i
alwai think there is a great deal in a voic person i judg by it
almost as much as by the face thi voic wa particularli pleasant and
sympathet though there wa noth veri origin or strike in the
word by which it wa so to speak introduc to me these were
how do you do sir will you have a split
i answer that i never drank spirit in the daytim or at least not
often but that i should be pleas to take a small bottl of beer
when the beer wa consum we walk up togeth to my littl hous
on which is now call the berea the same in which amongst other i
receiv my friend curti and good in after dai and there we dine
inde charli scroop never left that hous until we start on our
shoot expedit
now i must cut all thi stori short sinc it is onli incident that
it ha to do with the tale i am go to tell mr scroop wa a rich
man and as he offer to pai all the expens of the expedit while i
wa to take all the profit in the shape of ivori or anyth els that
might accru of cours i did not declin hi propos
everyth went well with us on that trip until it unfortun end
we onli kill two eleph but of other game we found plenti it wa
when we were near delagoa bai on our return that the accid happen
we were out on even try to shoot someth for our dinner when
between the tree i caught sight of a small buck it vanish round a
littl promontori of rock which project from the side of the kloof
walk quietli not run in alarm we follow after it i wa the
first and had just wriggl round these rock and perceiv the buck
stand about ten pace awai it wa a bushbok when i heard a rustl
among the bush on the top of the rock not a dozen feet abov my head
and charli scroop voic call
look out quatermain he come
who come i answer in an irrit tone for the nois had made
the buck run awai
then it occur to me all in an instant of cours that a man would
not begin to shout like that for noth at ani rate when hi supper
wa concern so i glanc up abov and behind me to thi moment i can
rememb exactli what i saw there wa the granit waterworn boulder
or rather sever boulder with fern grow in their crack of the
maidenhair tribe most of them but some had a silver sheen on the
under side of their leav on on of these leav bend it down sat
a larg beetl with red wing and a black bodi engag in rub it
antenn with it front paw and abov just appear over the top of
the rock wa the head of an extrem fine leopard as i write to
seem to perceiv it squar jowl outlin against the arc of the quiet
even sky with the saliva drop from it lip
thi wa the last thing which i did perceiv for a littl while sinc
at that moment the leopardw call them tiger in south africadrop
upon my back and knock me flat as a pancak i presum that it also
had been stalk the buck and wa angri at my appear on the scene
down i went luckili for me into a patch of mossi soil
all up i said to myself for i felt the brute weight upon my back
press me down among the moss and what wa wors it hot breath upon
my neck as it drop it jaw to bite me in the head then i heard
the report of scroop rifl follow by furiou snarl from the
leopard which evid had been hit also it seem to think that i
had caus it injuri for it seiz me by the shoulder i felt it
teeth slip along my skin but happili thei onli fasten in the shoot
coat of tough corduroi that i wa wear it began to shake me then
let go to get a better grip now rememb that scroop onli carri
a light singlebarrel rifl and therefor could not fire again
i knew or thought i knew that my time had come i wa not exactli
afraid but the sens of some great impend chanc becam veri
vivid i rememberednot my whole life but on or two odd littl thing
connect with my infanc for instanc i seem to see myself seat
on my mother knee plai with a littl joint goldfish which she
wore upon her watchchain
after thi i mutter a word or two of supplic and i think lost
conscious if so it can onli have been for a few second then my
mind return to me and i saw a strang sight the leopard and scroop
were fight each other the leopard stand on on hind leg for
the other wa broken seem to be box scroop whilst scroop wa
drive hi big hunt knife into the brute carcas thei went down
scroop undermost the leopard tear at him i gave a wriggl and came
out of that mossi bedi recal the suck sound my bodi made as it
left the ooz
close by wa my rifl uninjur and at full cock as it had fallen from
my hand i seiz it and in anoth second had shot the leopard through
the head just as it wa about to seiz scroop throat
it fell stone dead on the top of him on quiver on contract of the
claw in poor scroop leg and all wa over there it lai as though
it were asleep and underneath wa scroop
the difficulti wa to get it off him for the beast wa veri heavi but
i manag thi at last with the help of a thorn bough i found which some
eleph had torn from a tree thi i us as a lever there beneath
lai scroop liter cover with blood though whether hi own or
the leopard i could not tell at first i thought that he wa dead
but after i had pour some water over him from the littl stream that
trickl down the rock he sat up and ask inconsequ
what am i now
a hero i answer i have alwai been proud of that reparte
then discourag further convers i set to work to get him back
to the camp which fortun wa close at hand
when we had proceed a coupl of hundr yard he still make
inconsequ remark hi right arm round my neck and my left arm round
hi middl suddenli he collaps in a dead faint and as hi weight wa
more than i could carri i had to leav him and fetch help
in the end i got him to the tent by aid of the kaffir and a blanket
and there made an examin he wa scratch all over but the onli
seriou wound were a bite through the muscl of the left upper arm and
three deep cut in the right thigh just where it join the bodi caus
by a stroke of the leopard claw i gave him a dose of laudanum to
send him to sleep and dress these hurt as best i could for three
dai he went on quit well inde the wound had begun to heal
healthili when suddenli some kind of fever took him caus i suppos
by the poison of the leopard fang or claw
oh what a terribl week wa that which follow he becam deliri
rave continu of all sort of thing and especi of miss
margaret manner i kept up hi strength as well as wa possibl with
soup made from the flesh of game mix with a littl brandi which i
had but he grew weaker and weaker also the wound in the thigh began
to suppur
the kaffir whom we had with us were of littl us in such a case so
that all the nurs fell on me luckili beyond a shake the leopard
had done me no hurt and i wa veri strong in those dai still the lack
of rest told on me sinc i dare not sleep for more than half an hour
or so at a time at length came a morn when i wa quit worn out
there lai poor scroop turn and mutter in the littl tent and
there i sat by hi side wonder whether he would live to see anoth
dawn or if he did for how long i should be abl to tend him i call
to a kaffir to bring me my coffe and just wa i wa lift the
pannikin to my lip with a shake hand help came
it arriv in a veri strang shape in front of our camp were two
thorn tree and from between these tree the rai from the rise
sun fall full on him i saw a curiou figur walk toward me in
a slow purpos fashion it wa that of a man of uncertain ag for
though the beard and long hair were white the face wa compar
youth save for the wrinkl round the mouth and the dark ey were
full of life and vigour tatter garment surmount by a torn kaross

of which wa fix a butterfli net behind him were some kaffir who
carri case on their head
i knew him at onc sinc we had met befor especi on a certain
occas in zululand when he calmli appear out of the rank of a
hostil nativ impi he wa on of the strangest charact in all
south africa evid a gentleman in the true sens of the word none

except that he wa an american by birth for in thi matter at time hi
speech betrai him also he wa a doctor by profess and to judg
from hi extraordinari skill on who must have seen much practic both
in medicin and in surgeri for the rest he had mean though where
thei came from wa a mysteri and for mani year past had wander about
south and eastern africa collect butterfli and flower
by the nativ and i might add by white peopl also he wa univers
suppos to be mad thi reput coupl with hi medic skill
enabl him to travel wherev he would without the slightest fear of
molest sinc the kaffir look upon the mad as inspir by god
their name for him wa dogeetah a ludicr corrupt of the english
word doctor wherea white folk call him indiffer brother

from hi extraordinari like when clean up and nice dress
to the figur by which the great american nation is typifi in comic
paper as england is typifi by john bull the first and third aros
in the wellknown good of hi charact and a tast he wa suppos
to possess for live on locust and wild honei or their local
equival person howev he prefer to be address as
brother john
oh who can tell the relief with which i saw him an angel from heaven
could scarc have been more welcom as he came i pour out a second
jorum of coffe and rememb that he like it sweet put in plenti
of sugar

greet brother allan he answeredin those dai he affect a kind
of old roman wai of speak as i imagin it then he took the coffe

sugar drank it off as though it were a dose of medicin and hand
back the tin to be refil
bughunt i queri
he nod that and flower and observ human natur and the
wonder work of god wander around gener

other man brother john understand

we made no further remark the thing wa too curiou that is unless
he li but nobodi had ever known him to lie he wa a truth person
painfulli truth at time and yet there ar peopl who do not believ
in prayer
what is it he ask

off them us up more soap than i could spare first he gave poor
charli a dose of someth that seem to kill him he said he had that
drug from the kaffir then he open up those wound upon hi thigh and
clean them out and bandag them with boil herb afterward when
scroop came to again he gave him a drink that threw him into a sweat
and took awai the fever the end of it wa that in two dai time hi
patient sat up and ask for a squar meal and in a week we were abl
to begin to carri him to the coast
guess that messag of your save brother scroop life said old
john as he watch him start
i made no answer here i mai state howev that through my own men i
inquir a littl as to brother john movement at the time of what he
call the messag it seem that he had arrang to march toward
the coast on the next morn but that about two hour after sunset
suddenli he order them to pack up everyth and follow him thi thei
did and to their intens disgust those kaffir were forc to trudg all
night at the heel of dogeetah as thei call him inde so weari
did thei becom that had thei not been afraid of be left alon in an
unknown countri in the dark thei said thei would have thrown down
their load and refus to go ani further
that is as far as i wa abl to take the matter which mai be explain
by telepathi inspir instinct or coincid it is on as to
which the reader must form hi own opinion
dure our week togeth in camp and our subsequ journei to delagoa
bai and thenc by ship to durban brother john and i grew veri intim
with limit of hi past as i have said he never talk or of
the real object of hi wander which i learn afterward but of hi
natur histori and ethnolog i believ that is the word studi he
spoke a good deal as in my humbl wai i also am an observ of such
matter and know someth about african nativ and their habit from
practic experi these subject interest me
amongst other thing he show me mani of the specimen that he had
collect dure hi recent journei insect and beauti butterfli
neatli pin into box also a quantiti of dri flower press
between sheet of blot paper amongst them some which he told me
were orchid observ that these attract me he ask me if i would
like to see the most wonder orchid in the whole world of cours i
said ye whereon he produc out of on of hi case a flat packag
about two feet six squar he undid the grass mat in which it wa
wrap stripe delic woven mat such as thei make in the
neighbourhood of zanzibar within these wa the lid of a packingcas
then came more mat and some copi of the cape journal spread out
flat then sheet of blot paper and last of all between two piec
of cardboard a flower and on leaf of the plant on which it grew
even in it dri state it wa a wondrou thing measur twentyfour
inch from the tip of on wing or petal to the tip of the other by
twenti inch from the top of the back sheath to the bottom of the
pouch the measur of the back sheath itself i forget but it must
have been quit a foot across in colour it wa or had been bright
golden but the back sheath wa white bar with line of black and
in the exact centr of the pouch wa a singl black spot shape like the
head of a great ap there were the overhang brow the deep recess
ey the surli mouth the massiv jawseveryth
although at that time i had never seen a gorilla in the flesh i had
seen a colour pictur of the brute and if that pictur had been
photograph on the flower the like could not have been more
perfect
what is it i ask amaz
sir said brother john sometim he us thi formal term when
excit it is the most marvel cypripedium in the whole earth and
sir i have discov it a healthi root of that plant will be worth
20000
that better than gold mine i said well have you got the root
brother john shook hi head sadli as he answer
no such luck
how that as you have the flower
ill tell you allan for a year past and more i have been collect
in the district back of kilwa and found some wonder thing ye
wonder at last about three hundr mile inland i came to a tribe
or rather a peopl that no white man had ever visit thei ar call
the mazitu a numer and warlik peopl of bastard zulu blood
i have heard of them i interrupt thei broke north befor the dai
of senzangakona two hundr year or more ago
well i could make myself understood among them becaus thei still
talk a corrupt zulu as do all the tribe in those part at first thei
want to kill me but let me go becaus thei thought that i wa mad
everyon think that i am mad allan it is a kind of public delus
wherea i think that i am sane and that most other peopl ar mad
a privat delus i suggest hurriedli as i did not wish to
discuss brother john saniti well go on about the mazitu
later thei discov that i had skill in medicin and their king
bausi came to me to be treat for a great extern tumour i risk
an oper and cure him it wa anxiou work for if he had di i
should have di too though that would not have troubl me veri much
and he sigh of cours from that moment i wa suppos to be a great
magician also bausi made a blood brotherhood with me transfus some
of hi blood into my vein and some of mine into hi i onli hope he ha
not inocul me with hi tumour which ar congenit so i becam
bausi and bausi becam me in other word i wa as much chief of the
mazitu as he wa and shall remain so all my life
that might be us i said reflect but go on
i learn that on the western boundari of the mazitu territori were
great swamp that beyond these swamp wa a lake call kirua and
beyond that a larg and fertil land suppos to be an island with
a mountain in it centr thi land is known as pongo and so ar the
peopl who live there
that is a nativ name for the gorilla isnt it i ask at least so
a fellow who had been on the west coast told me
inde then that strang as you will see now these pongo ar
suppos to be great magician and the god thei worship is said to be
a gorilla which if you ar right account for their name or rather
he went on thei have two god the other is that flower you see there
whether the flower with the monkei head on it wa the first god and
suggest the worship of the beast itself or vice versa i dont
know inde i know veri littl just what i wa told by the mazitu and
a man who call himself a pongo chief no more
what did thei sai
the mazitu said that the pongo peopl ar devil who came by the secret
channel through the reed in cano and stole their children and women
whom thei sacrif to their god sometim too thei made raid upon
them at night howl like hyena the men thei kill and the women
and children thei took awai the mazitu want to attack them but cannot
do so becaus thei ar not water peopl and have no cano and
therefor ar unabl to reach the island if it is an island also thei
told me about the wonder flower which grow in the place where the
apegod live and is worship like the god thei had the stori of it
from some of their peopl who had been enslav and escap
did you try to get to the island i ask
ye allan that is i went to the edg of the reed which lie at the
end of a long slope of plain where the lake begin here i stop for
some time catch butterfli and collect plant on night when i
wa camp there by myself for none of my men would remain so near the
pongo countri after sunset i woke up with a sens that i wa no longer
alon i crept out of my tent and by the light of the moon which wa
set for dawn drew near i saw a man who leant upon the handl of a
veri wideblad spear which wa taller than himself a big man over six
feet two high i should sai and broad in proport he wore a long
white cloak reach from hi shoulder almost to the ground on hi
head wa a tightfit cap with lappet also white in hi ear were
ring of copper or gold and on hi wrist bracelet of the same metal
hi skin wa intens black but the featur were not at all negroid
thei were promin and finelycut the nose be sharp and the lip
quit thin inde of an arab type hi left hand wa bandag and on
hi face wa an express of great anxieti lastli he appear to be
about fifti year of ag so still did he stand that i began to wonder
whether he were on of those ghost which the mazitu swore the pongo
wizard send out to haunt their countri
for a long while we stare at each other for i wa determin that i
would not speak first or show ani concern at last he spoke in a low
deep voic and in mazitu or a languag so similar that i found it easi
to understand
is not your name dogeetah o white lord and ar you not a master of
medicin
ye i answer but who ar you who dare to wake me from my sleep
lord i am the kalubi the chief of the pongo a great man in my own
land yonder
then why do you come here alon at night kalubi chief of the pongo
why do you come here alon white lord he answer evas
what do you want anywai i ask
o dogeetah i have been hurt i want you to cure me and he look
at hi bandag hand
lai down that spear and open your robe that i mai see you have no
knife
he obei throw the spear to some distanc
now unwrap the hand
he did so i lit a match the sight of which seem to frighten him
greatli although he ask no question about it and by it light
examin the hand the first joint of the second finger wa gone from
the appear of the stump which had been cauter and wa ti
tightli with a piec of flexibl grass i judg that it had been bitten
off
what did thi i ask
monkei he answer poison monkei cut off the finger o
dogeetah or tomorrow i die
why do you not tell your own doctor to cut off the finger you who
ar kalubi chief of the pongo
no no he repli shake hi head thei cannot do it it is not
law and i i cannot do it for if the flesh is black the hand must
come off too and if the flesh is black at the wrist then the arm must
be cut off
i sat down on my camp stool and reflect realli i wa wait for the
sun to rise sinc it wa useless to attempt an oper in that light
the man kalubi thought that i had refus hi petit and becam
terribl agit
be merci white lord he prai do not let me die i am afraid
to die life is bad but death is wors o if you refus me i will
kill myself here befor you and then my ghost will haunt you till you
die also of fear and come to join me what fee do you ask gold or ivori
or slave sai and i will give it
be silent i said for i saw that if he went on thu he would throw
himself into a fever which might caus the oper to prove fatal
for the same reason i did not question him about mani thing i should
have like to learn i lit my fire and boil the instrumentsh
thought i wa make magic by the time that everyth wa readi the
sun wa up
now i said let me see how brave you ar
well allan i perform that oper remov the finger at the
base where it join the hand as i thought there might be someth in
hi stori of the poison inde as i found afterward on dissect
and can show you for i have the thing in spirit there wa for the
black of which he spoke a kind of mortif i presum had
crept almost to the joint though the flesh beyond wa healthi enough
certainli that kalubi wa a plucki fellow he sat like a rock and never
even winc inde when he saw that the flesh wa sound he utter a
great sigh of relief after it wa all over he turn a littl faint so
i gave him some spirit of wine mix with water which reviv him
o lord dogeetah he said as i wa bandag hi hand while i live
i am your slave yet do me on more servic in my land there is a
terribl wild beast that which bit off my finger it is a devil it
kill us and we fear it i have heard that you white men have magic
weapon which slai with a nois come to my land and kill me that wild
beast with your magic weapon i sai come come for i am terribl
afraid and inde he look it
no i answer i shed no blood i kill noth except butterfli
and of these onli a few but if you fear thi brute why do you not
poison it you black peopl have mani drug
no us no us he repli in a kind of wail the beast know
poison some it swallow and thei do not harm it other it will not
touch moreov no black man can do it hurt it is white and it ha
been known from of old that if it di at all it must be by the hand of
on who is white
a veri strang anim i began suspici for i felt sure that he
wa ly to me but just at that moment i heard the sound of my men
voic thei were advanc toward me through the giant grass sing
as thei came but as yet a long wai off the kalubi heard it also and
sprang up
i must be gone he said none must see me here what fee o lord of
medicin what fee
i take no payment for my medicin i said yetstai a wonder
flower grow in your countri doe it not a flower with wing and a cup
beneath i would have that flower
who told you of the flower he ask the flower is holi still o
white lord still for you it shall be risk oh return and bring with
you on who can kill the beast and i will make you rich return and call
to the reed for the kalubi and the kalubi will hear and come to you
then he ran to hi spear snatch it from the ground and vanish
among the reed that wa the last i saw or am ever like to see of
him
but brother john you got the flower somehow
ye allan about a week later when i came out of my tent on morn
there it wa stand in a narrowmouth earthenwar pot fill with
water of cours i meant that he wa to send me the plant root and
all but i suppos he understood that i want a bloom or perhap he
dare not send the plant anyhow it is better than noth
why did you not go into the countri and get it for yourself
for sever reason allan of which the best is that it wa
imposs the mazitu swear that if anyon see that flower he is put
to death inde when thei found that i had a bloom of it thei forc
me to move to the other side of the countri seventi mile awai so i
thought that i would wait till i met with some companion who would
accompani me inde to be frank allan it occur to me that you
were the sort of man who would like to interview thi wonder beast
that bite off peopl finger and frighten them to death and
brother john stroke hi long white beard and smile ad odd that
we should have met so soon afterward isnt it
did you i repli now did you inde brother john peopl sai
all sort of thing about you but i have come to the conclus that
there noth the matter with your wit
again he smile and stroke hi long white beard
chapter ii
the auction room
i do not think that thi convers about the pongo savag who were
said to worship a gorilla and a golden flower wa renew until we
reach my hous at durban thither of cours i took mr charl
scroop and thither also came brother john who as bedroom
accommod wa lack pitch hi tent in the garden
on night we sat on the step smoke brother john onli concess to
human weak wa that he smoke he drank no wine or spirit he never
at meat unless he wa oblig but i rejoic to sai that he smoke
cigar like most american when he could get them
john said i i have been think over that yarn of your and have
come to on or two conclus
what mai thei be allan
the first is that you were a great donkei not to get more out of the
kalubi when you had the chanc
agre allan but amongst other thing i am a doctor and the
oper wa uppermost in my mind
the second is that i believ thi kalubi had charg of the gorillagod
as no doubt youv guess also that it wa the gorilla which bit off
hi finger
why so
becaus i have heard of great monkei call soko that live in
central east africa which ar said to bite off men toe and finger i
have heard too that thei ar veri like gorilla
now you mention it so have i allan inde onc i saw a soko
though some wai off a huge brown ap which stood on it hind leg and
drum upon it chest with it fist i didnt see it for long becaus
i ran awai
the third is that thi yellow orchid would be worth a great deal of
monei if on could dig it up and take it to england
i think i told you allan that i valu it at 20000 so that
conclus of your is not origin
the fourth is that i should like to dig up that orchid and get a share
of the 20000
brother john becam intens interest
ah he said now we ar get to the point i have been wonder
how long it would take you to see it allan but if you ar slow you
ar sure
the fifth is i went on that such an expedit to succe would
need a great deal of monei more than you or i could find partner
would be want activ or sleep but partner with cash
brother john look toward the window of the room in which charli
scroop wa in bed for be still weak he went to rest earli
no i said he had enough of africa and you told me yourself that
it will be two year befor he is realli strong again also there a
ladi in thi case now listen i have taken it on myself to write to

worldfam stylewould be abl to put me in touch with opul
orchidist who would not mind ventur a coupl of thousand on the
chanc of receiv a share in a flower that accord to brother john

to a larg room to on who had never seen anyth of the sort befor
thi room offer a curiou sight the first thing i observ wa a
notic on the wall to the effect that custom were not allow to
smoke pipe i thought to myself that orchid must be curiou flower

step into the room to my left wa a long tabl cover with pot of
the most beauti flower that i had ever seen all of them orchid
along the wall and opposit were other tabl close pack with
wither root which i conclud were also those of orchid to my
inexperienc ey the whole lot did not look worth five shill for
thei seem to be dead
at the head of the room stood the rostrum where sat a gentleman with an
extrem charm face he wa engag in sell by auction so rapidli
that the clerk at hi side must have had difficulti in keep a record
of the lot and their purchas in front of him wa a horsesho tabl
round which sat buyer the end of thi tabl wa left unoccupi so
that the porter might exhibit each lot befor it wa put up for sale
stand under the rostrum wa yet anoth tabl a small on upon

those on the larg tabl a notic state that these would be sold at
onethirti precis all about the room stood knot of men such ladi
as were present sat at the tabl mani of whom had love orchid

with a feroci bow sir alexand motion to me to enter which i did
take on of the back seat as it gave more room for my tin case then

feroc
as the boaconstrictor said to the rabbit in the cage i remark
i did not mean to sai it but i had grown nervou and the thought leapt
from my lip in word again mr stephen began to swell he turn hi
face to the window as though to contempl the wall beyond but i
could see hi shoulder shake a dim light of intellig shone in
woodden pale ey about three minut later the joke got home he
gurgl someth about boaconstrictor and rabbit and gave a short
loud laugh as for sir alexand he mere said
i did not catch your remark sir would you be so good as to repeat
it
as i appear unwil to accept the invit he went on
perhap then you would repeat what you told me in that saleroom

leisur now for a week or so at ani rate i have a roof over my head
and in short will you be my guest for a night or two i know noth
about you and of me you onli know that i am the disinherit son of a
father to whom i have fail to give satisfact still it is possibl
that we might pass a few pleasant hour togeth talk of flower and
other thing that is if you have no previou engag
i have none i answer i am onli a stranger from south africa
lodg at an hotel if you will give me time to call for my bag i will
pass the night at your hous with pleasur
by the aid of mr somer smart dogcart which wa wait at a citi
mew we reach twickenham while there wa still half an hour of
daylight the hous which wa call verbena lodg wa small a
squar redbrick build of the earli georgian period but the garden
cover quit an acr of ground and were veri beauti or must have
been so in summer into the greenhous we did not enter becaus it wa
too late to see the flower also just when we came to them woodden
arriv in hi fourwheel cab and depart with hi master to see to
the hous of o pavo
then came dinner a veri pleasant meal my host had that dai been turn
out upon the world but he did not allow thi circumst to interfer
with hi spirit in the least also he wa evid determin to
enjoi it good thing while thei last for hi champagn and port were
excel
you see mr quatermain he said it just as well we had the row
which ha been boil up for a long while my respect father ha made
so much monei that he think i should go and do likewis now i dont
see it i like flower especi orchid and i hate bullionbrok
to me the onli decent place in london ar that saleroom where we met
and the horticultur garden
ye i answer rather doubtfulli but the matter seem a littl
seriou your parent wa veri emphat as to hi intent and after
thi kind of thing and i point to the beauti silver and the port
how will you like rough it in a hard world
dont think i shall mind a bit it would be rather a pleasant chang
also even if my father doesnt alter hi mind as he mai for he like
me at bottom becaus i resembl my dear mother thing aint so veri
bad i have got some monei that she left me 6000 or 7000 and ill
sell that odontoglossum pavo for what it will fetch to sir joshua
tredgoldh wa the man with the long beard who you tell me ran up
woodden to over 2000or fail him to someon els ill write
about it tonight i dont think i have ani debt to speak of for the
governor ha been allow me 3000 a year at least that is my share
of the profit paid to me in return for my bullionbrok labour and
except flower i have no expens tast so the devil take the past
here to the futur and whatev it mai bring and he polish off the
glass of port he held and laugh in hi jolli fashion
realli he wa a most attract young man a littl reckless it is
true but then reckless and youth mix well like brandi and soda
i echo the toast and drank off my port for i like a good glass of
wine when i can get it as would anyon who ha had to live for month
on rotten water although i admit that agre with me better than the
port
now mr quatermain he went on if you have done light your pipe
and let go into the other room and studi that cypripedium of your i
shant sleep tonight unless i see it again first stop a bit though
well get hold of that old ass woodden befor he turn in
woodden said hi master when the garden had arriv thi
gentleman mr quatermain is go to show you an orchid that is ten
time finer than o pavo
beg pardon sir answer woodden but if mr quatermain sai that
he li it aint in natur it dont bloom nowher
i open the case and reveal the golden cypripedium woodden stare at
it and rock then he stare again and felt hi head as though to make
sure it wa on hi shoulder then he gasp
well if that there flower baint made up it a master on if i could
see that there flower ablow on the plant id die happi
woodden stop talk and sit down exclaim hi master ye
there where you can look at the flower now mr quatermain will
you tell us the stori of that orchid from begin to end of cours
omit it habitat if you like for it isnt fair to ask that secret
woodden can be trust to hold hi tongu and so can i
i remark that i wa sure thei could and for the next halfhour talk
almost without interrupt keep noth back and explain that
i wa anxiou to find someon who would financ an expedit to search
for thi particular plant as i believ the onli on of it sort that
exist in the world
how much will it cost ask mr somer
i lai it at 2000 i answer you see we must have plenti of men
and gun and store also trade good and present
i call that cheap but suppos mr quatermain that the expedit
prove success and the plant is secur what then
then i propos that brother john who found it and of whom i have told
you should take onethird of whatev it might sell for that i as
captain of the expedit should take onethird and that whoever find
the necessari monei should take the remain third
good that settl
what settl i ask
why that we should divid in the proport you name onli i bargain
to be allow to take my whack in kindi mean in plant and to have the
first option of purchas the rest of the plant at whatev valu mai
be agre upon
but mr somer do you mean that you wish to find 2000 and make thi
expedit in person
of cours i do i thought you understood that that is if you will
have me your old friend the lunat you and i will togeth seek for
and find thi golden flower i sai that settl
on the morrow accordingli it wa settl with the help of a document
sign in duplic by both of us
befor these arrang were final conclud howev i insist
that mr somer should meet my late companion charli scroop when
i wa not present in order that the latter might give him a full
and particular report concern myself appar the interview
wa satisfactori at least so i judg from the veri cordial and even
respect manner in which young somer met me after it wa over also i
thought it my duti to explain to him with much clear in the presenc
of scroop as a wit the great danger of such an enterpris as that
on which he propos to embark i told him straight out that he must be
prepar to find hi death in it from starvat fever wild beast or
at the hand of savag while success wa quit problemat and veri
like would not be attain
you ar take these risk he said
ye i answer but thei ar incid to the rough trade i follow
which is that of a hunter and explor moreov my youth is past
and i have gone through experi and bereav of which you know
noth that caus me to set a veri slight valu on life i care littl
whether i die or continu in the world for some few ad year lastli
the excit of adventur ha becom a kind of necess for me i
do not think that i could live in england for veri long also im a
fatalist i believ that when my time come i must go that thi hour is
foreordain and that noth i can do will either hasten or postpon it
by on moment your circumst ar differ you ar quit young
if you stai here and approach your father in a proper spirit i have
no doubt but that he will forget all the rough word he said to you the
other dai for which inde you know you gave him some provoc is
it worth while throw up such prospect and undertak such
danger for the chanc of find a rare flower i sai thi to my own
disadvantag sinc i might find it hard to discov anyon els who
would risk 2000 upon such a ventur but i do urg you to weigh my
word
young somer look at me for a littl while then he broke into on of
hi hearti laugh and exclaim whatev els you mai be mr allan
quatermain you ar a gentleman no bullionbrok in the citi could
have put the matter more fairli in the teeth of hi own interest
thank you i said
for the rest he went on i too am tire of england and want to
see the world it isnt the golden cypripedium that i seek although i
should like to win it well enough that onli a symbol what i seek ar
adventur and romanc also like you i am a fatalist god chose hi own
time to send us here and i presum that he will choos hi own time to
take us awai again so i leav the matter of risk to him
ye mr somer i repli rather solemnli you mai find adventur
and romanc there ar plenti of both in africa or you mai find a
nameless grave in some feverhaunt swamp well you have chosen and i
like your spirit
still i wa so littl satisfi about thi busi that a week or so
befor we sail after much consider i took it upon myself to
write a letter to sir alexand somer in which i set forth the whole
matter as clearli as i could not blink the danger natur of our
undertak in conclus i ask him whether he thought it wise to
allow hi onli son to accompani such an expedit mainli becaus of a
not veri seriou quarrel with himself
as no answer came to thi letter i went on with our prepar

chapter iv
mavovo and han
we arriv safe at durban at the begin of march and took up our
quarter at my hous on the berea where i expect that brother john
would be await us but no brother john wa to be found the old lame
griqua jack who look after the place for me and onc had been on of
my hunter said that shortli after i went awai in the ship dogeetah
as he call him had taken hi tin box and hi net and walk off
inland he knew not where leav as he declar no messag or letter
behind him the case full of butterfli and dri plant were also
gone but these i found he had ship to some port in america by a
sail vessel bound for the unit state which chanc to put in at
durban for food and water as to what had becom of the man himself i
could get no clue he had been seen at maritzburg and accord to some
kaffir whom i knew afterward on the border of zululand where so
far as i could learn he vanish into space
thi to sai the least of it wa disconcert and a question aros
as to what wa to be done brother john wa to have been our guid he
alon knew the mazitu peopl he alon had visit the border of the
mysteri pongoland i scarc felt inclin to attempt to reach that
countri without hi aid
when a fortnight had gone by and still there were no sign of him
stephen and i held a solemn confer i point out the difficulti
and danger of the situat to him and suggest that under the
circumst it might be wise to give up thi wild orchidchas and go
elephanthunt instead in a certain part of zululand where in those
dai these anim were still abund
he wa inclin to agre with me sinc the prospect of kill
eleph had attract for him
and yet i said after reflect it curiou but i never rememb
make a success trip after alter plan at the last moment that
is unless on wa driven to it
i vote we toss up said somer it give provid a chanc now
then head for the golden cyp and tail for the eleph
he spun a halfcrown into the air it fell and roll under a great
yellowwood chest full of curios that i had collect which
it took all our unit strength to move we drag it asid and not
without some excit for realli a good deal hung upon the chanc i
lit a match and peer into the shadow there in the dust lai the coin
what is it i ask of somer who wa stretch on hi stomach on the
chest
orchidi mean head he answer well that settl so we neednt
bother ani more
the next fortnight wa a busi time for me as it happen there wa a
schooner in the bai of about on hundr ton burden which belong to
a portugues trader name delgado who dealt in good that he carri
to the variou east african port and madagascar he wa a
villainouslook person whom i suspect of have deal with the
slave trader who were veri numer and a great power in those dai
if inde he were not on himself but as he wa go to kilwa whenc
we propos to start inland i arrang to make us of him to carri our
parti and the baggag the bargain wa not altogeth easi to strike for
two reason first he did not appear to be anxiou that we should hunt
in the district at the back of kilwa where he assur me there wa no
game and secondli he said that he want to sail at onc howev i
overcam hi object with an argument he could not resistnam
monei and in the end he agre to postpon hi departur for fourteen
dai
then i set about collect our men of whom i had made up my mind there
must not be less than twenti alreadi i had sent messeng summon
to durban from zululand and the upper district of natal variou hunter
who had accompani me on other expedit to the number of a dozen or
so thei arriv in due cours i have alwai had the good fortun to be
on the best of term with my kaffir and where i went thei were readi
to go without ask ani question the man whom i had select to be
their captain under me wa a zulu of the name of mavovo he wa a
short fellow past middl ag with an enorm chest hi strength wa
proverbi inde it wa said that he could throw an ox by the horn
and myself i have seen him hold down the head of a wound buffalo that
had fallen until i could come up and shoot it
when i first knew mavovo he wa a petti chief and witch doctor in
zululand like myself he had fought for the princ umbelazi in the
great battl of the tugela a crime which cetewayo never forgav him
about a year afterward he got warn that he had been smelt out as a
wizard and wa go to be kill he fled with two of hi wive and a
child the slayer overtook them befor he could reach the natal border
and stab the elder wife and the child of the second wife thei were
four men but made mad by the sight mavovo turn on them and kill
them all then with the remain wife cut to piec as he wa he
crept to the river and through it to natal not long after thi wife
di also it wa said from grief at the loss of her child mavovo did
not marri again perhap becaus he wa now a man without mean for
cetewayo had taken all hi cattl also he wa made ugli by an assegai
wound which had cut off hi right nostril shortli after the death of
hi second wife he sought me out and told me he wa a chief without a
kraal and wish to becom my hunter so i took him on a step which i
never had ani caus to regret sinc although moros and at time given
to the practic of uncanni art he wa a most faith servant and
brave as a lion or rather as a buffalo for a lion is not alwai brave
anoth man whom i did not send for but who came wa an old hottentot

night at durban a veri beauti night of full moon at the end of
march for the portuge delgado had announc hi intent of sail
on the follow afternoon stephen somer and i were seat on the
stoep smoke and talk thing over
it is a strang thing i said that brother john should never have
turn up i know that he wa set upon make thi expedit not onli
for the sake of the orchid but also for some other reason of which he
would not speak i think that the old fellow must be dead
veri like answer stephen we had becom intim and i call him
stephen now a man alon among savag might easili come to grief
and never be heard of again hark what that and he point to some
gardenia bush in the shadow of the hous near by whenc came a sound
of someth that move
a dog i expect or perhap it is han he curl up in all sort of
place near to where i mai be han ar you there
a figur aros from the gardenia bush
ja i am here baa
what ar you do han
i am do what the dog doe baaswatch my master
good i answer then an idea struck me han you have heard of the
white baa with the long beard whom the kaffir call dogeetah
i have heard of him and onc i saw him a few moon ago pass
through pinetown a kaffir with him told me that he wa go over the
drakensberg to hunt for thing that crawl and fly be quit mad
baa
well where is he now han he should have been here to travel with
us
am i a spirit that i can tell the baa whither a white man ha
wander yet stai mavovo mai be abl to tell he is a great doctor
he can see through distanc and even now thi veri night hi snake
of divin ha enter into him and he is look into the futur
yonder behind the hous i saw him form the circl
i translat what han said to stephen for he had been talk in
dutch then ask him if he would like to see some kaffir magic
of cours he answer but it all bosh isnt it
oh ye all bosh or so most peopl sai i answer evas
still sometim these inyanga tell on strang thing
then led by han we crept round the hous to where there wa a
fivefoot stone wall at the back of the stabl beyond thi wall within
the circl of some hut where my kaffir live wa an open space with
an antheap floor where thei did their cook here face us sat
mavovo while in a ring around him were all the hunter who were to
accompani us also jack the lame griqua and the two houseboi in
front of mavovo burn a number of littl wood fire i count them and
found that there were fourteen which i reflect wa the exact
number of our hunter plu ourselv on of the hunter wa engag
in feed these fire with littl bit of stick and hand of
dri grass so as to keep them burn brightli the other sat round
perfectli silent and watch with rapt attent mavovo himself look
like a man who is asleep he wa crouch on hi haunch with hi big
head rest almost upon hi knee about hi middl wa a snakeskin
and round hi neck an ornament that appear to be made of human teeth
on hi right side lai a pile of feather from the wing of vultur and
on hi left a littl heap of silver moneyi suppos the fee paid by
the hunter for whom he wa divin
after we had watch him for some while from our shelter behind the wall
he appear to wake out of hi sleep first he mutter then he look
up to the moon and seem to sai a prayer of which i could not catch
the word next he shudder three time convuls and exclaim in a
clear voic
my snake ha come it is within me now i can hear now i can see
three of the littl fire those immedi in front of him were
larger than the other he took up hi bundl of vultur feather
select on with care held it toward the sky then pass it through
the flame of the centr on of the three fire utter as he did so
my nativ name macumazana withdraw it from the flame he examin
the char edg of the feather veri carefulli a proceed that
caus a cold shiver to go down my back for i knew well that he wa
inquir of hi spirit what would be my fate upon thi expedit
how it answer i cannot tell for he laid the feather down and
took anoth with which he went through the same process thi time
howev the name he call out wa mwamwazela which in it shorten
form of wazela wa the kaffir appel that the nativ had given
to stephen somer it mean a smile and no doubt wa select for him
becaus of hi pleasant smile counten
have pass it through the righthand fire of the three he examin
it and laid it down
so it went on on after anoth he call out the name of the hunter
begin with hi own as captain pass the feather which repres
each of them through the particular fire of hi destini examin
and laid it down after thi he seem to go to sleep again for a few
minut then woke up as a man doe from a natur slumber yawn and
stretch himself
speak said hi audienc with great anxieti have you seen have you
heard what doe your snake tell you of me of me of me of me
i have seen i have heard he answer my snake tell me that thi
will be a veri danger journei of those who go on it six will die by
the bullet by the spear or by sick and other will be hurt
ow said on of them but which will die and which will come out
safe doe not your snake tell you that o doctor
ye of cours my snake tell me that but my snake tell me also
to hold my tongu on the matter lest some of us should be turn to
coward it tell me further that the first who should ask me more will
be on of those who must die now do you ask or you or you or you
ask if you will
strang to sai no on accept the invit never have i seen a bodi
of men so indiffer to the futur at least to everi appear on
and all thei seem to come to the conclus that so far as thei were
concern it might be left to look after itself
my snake told me someth els went on mavovo it is that if among
thi compani there is ani jackal of a man who think that he might be
on of the six to die dream to avoid hi fate by desert it will be
of no us for then my snake will point him out and show me how to deal
with him
now with on voic each man present there declar that desert from
the lord macumazana wa the last thing that could possibl occur to him
inde i believ that those brave fellow spoke truth no doubt thei
put faith in mavovo magic after the fashion of their race still the
death he promis wa some wai off and each hope he would be on of
the six to escap moreov the zulu of those dai wa too accustom
to death to fear it terror over much
on of them did howev ventur to advanc the argument which
mavovo treat with proper contempt that the shill paid for thi
divin should be return by him to the next heir of such of them
as happen to deceas why he ask should these pai a shill in
order to be told that thei must die it seem unreason
certainli the zulu kaffir have a queer wai of look at thing
han i whisper is your fire among those that burn yonder
not so baa he wheez back into my ear doe the baa think me a
fool if i must die i must die if i am to live i shall live why
then should i pai a shill to learn what time will declar moreov
yonder mavovo take the shill and frighten everybodi but tell
nobodi anyth i call it cheat but baa do you and the baa
wazela have no fear you did not pai shill and therefor mavovo
though without doubt he is a great inyanga cannot realli prophesi
concern you sinc hi snake will not work without a fee
the argument seem remark absurd yet it must be common for now
that i come to think of it no gipsi will tell a true fortun unless
her hand is cross with silver
i sai quatermain said stephen idli sinc our friend mavovo seem
to know so much ask him what ha becom of brother john as han
suggest tell me what he sai afterward for i want to see
someth
so i went through the littl gate in the wall in a natur kind of wai
as though i had seen noth and appear to be struck by the sight of
the littl fire
well mavovo i said ar you do doctor work i thought that it
had brought you into enough troubl in zululand
that is so baba repli mavovo who had a habit of call me
father though he wa older than i it cost me my chieftainship and
my cattl and my two wive and my son it made of me a wander who
is glad to accompani a certain macumazana to strang land where mani
thing mai befal me ye he ad with mean even the last of all
thing and yet a gift is a gift and must be us you baba have a
gift of shoot and do you ceas to shoot you have a gift of wander
and can you ceas to wander
he pick up on of the burnt feather from the littl pile by hi side
and look at it attent perhap baba you have been toldmi
ear ar veri sharp and i thought i heard some such word float
through the air just nowthat we poor kaffir inyanga can prophesi
noth true unless we ar paid and perhap that is a fact so far
as someth of the moment is concern and yet the snake in the
inyanga jump over the littl rock which hide the present from it
mai see the path that wind far and far awai through the vallei across
the stream up the mountain till it is lost in the heaven abov
thu on thi feather burnt in my magic fire i seem to see someth of
your futur o my father macumazana far and far your road run and he
drew hi finger along the feather here is a journei and he flick
awai a carbonis flake here is anoth and anoth and anoth
and he flick off flake after flake here is on that is veri
success it leav you rich and here is yet on more a wonder
journei thi in which you see strang thing and meet strang peopl
thenand he blew on the feather in such a fashion that all the char
filament brother john sai that lamina is the right word for them
fell awai from itthen there is noth left save such a pole as some
of my peopl stick upright on a grave the shaft of memori thei call it
o my father you will die in a distant land but you will leav a great
memori behind you that will live for hundr of year for see how
strong is thi quill over which the fire ha had no power with some of
these other it is quit differ he ad
i daresai i broke in but mavovo be so good as to leav me out of
your magic for i dont at all want to know what is go to happen to
me todai is enough for me without studi next month and next year
there is a sai in our holi book which run suffici to the dai is
it evil
quit so o macumazana also that is a veri good sai as some of
those hunter of your ar think now yet an hour ago thei were
forc their shill on me that i might tell them of the futur and
you too want to know someth you did not come through that gate
to quot to me the wisdom of your holi book what is it baba be
quick for my snake is get veri tire he wish to go back to hi
hole in the world beneath
well then i answer in rather a shamefac fashion for mavovo had
an uncanni wai of see into on secret motiv i should like to
know if you can tell me which you cant what ha becom of the white
man with the long beard whom you black peopl call dogeetah he should
have been here to go on thi journei with us inde he wa to be our
guid and we cannot find him where is he and why is he not here
have you anyth about you that belong to dogeetah macumazana
no i answer that is ye and from my pocket i produc the
stump of pencil that brother john had given me which be econom
i had save up ever sinc mavovo took it and after consid it
carefulli as he had done in the case of the feather swept up a pile
of ash with hi horni hand from the edg of the largest of the littl
fire that inde which had repres myself these ash he pat
flat then he drew on them with the point of the pencil trace what
seem to me to be the rough imag of a man such as children scratch
upon whitewash wall when he had finish he sat up and contempl
hi handiwork with all the satisfact of an artist a breez had risen
from the sea and wa blow in littl gust so that the fine ash
were disturb some of the line of the pictur be fill in and
other alter or enlarg
for a while mavovo sat with hi ey shut then he open them studi
the ash and what remain of the pictur and take a blanket that
lai near by threw it over hi own head and over the ash withdraw
it again present he cast it asid and point to the pictur which
wa now quit chang inde in the moonlight it look more like a
landscap than anyth els
all is clear my father he said in a matteroffact voic the white
wander dogeetah is not dead he live but he is sick someth is
the matter with on of hi leg so that he cannot walk perhap a bone
is broken or some beast ha bitten him he li in a hut such as kaffir
make onli thi hut ha a verandah round it like your stoep and there
ar draw on the wall the hut is a long wai off i dont know
where
is that all i ask for he paus
no not all dogeetah is recov he will join us in that countri
whither we journei at a time of troubl that is all and the fee is
halfacrown
you mean on shill i suggest
no my father macumazana on shill for simpl magic such as
foretel the fate of common black peopl halfacrown for veri
difficult magic that ha to do with white peopl magic of which onli
great doctor like me mavovo ar the master
i gave him the halfcrown and said
look here friend mavovo i believ in you as a fighter and a hunter
but as a magician i think you ar a humbug inde i am so sure of it
that if ever dogeetah turn up at a time of troubl in that land whither
we ar journei i will make you a present of that doublebarrel
rifl of mine which you admir so much
on of hi rare smile appear upon mavovo ugli face
then give it to me now baba he said for it is alreadi earn my
snake cannot lieespeci when the fee is halfacrown
i shook my head and declin polit but with firm
ah said mavovo you white men ar veri clever and think that you
know everyth but it is not so for in learn so much that is new
you have forgotten more that is old when the snake that is in you
macumazana dwelt in a black savag like me a thousand thousand year
ago you could have done and did what i do but now you can onli mock
and sai mavovo the brave in battl the great hunter the loyal man
becom a liar when he blow the burnt feather or read what the wind
write upon the charm ash
i do not sai that you ar a liar mavovo i sai that you ar deceiv
by your own imagin it is not possibl that man can know what is
hidden from man
is it inde so o macumazana watcher by night am i mavovo the
pupil of zikali the open of road the greatest of wizard inde
deceiv by my own imagin and ha man no other ey but those in
hi head that he cannot see what is hidden from man well you sai so
and all we black peopl know that you ar veri clever and why should i
a poor zulu be abl to see what you cannot see yet when tomorrow on
send you a messag from the ship in which we ar to sail beg you
to come fast becaus there is troubl on the ship then bethink you of
your word and my word and whether or no man can see what is hidden
from man in the black of the futur oh that rifl of your is mine
alreadi though you will not give it to me now you who think that i
am a cheat well my father macumazana becaus you think i am a cheat
never again will i blow the feather or read what the wind write upon
the ash for you or ani who eat your food
then he rose salut me with uplift right hand collect hi littl
pile of monei and bag of medicin and march off to the sleep hut
on our wai round the hous we met my old lame caretak jack
inkoosi he said the white chief wazela bade me sai that he and
the cook sam have gone to sleep on board the ship to look after the
good sam came up just now and fetch him awai he sai he will show
you why tomorrow
i nod and pass on wonder to myself why stephen had suddenli
determin to stai the night on the maria
chapter v
hassan
i suppos it must have been two hour after dawn on the follow
morn that i wa awaken by knock upon the door and the voic of
jack sai that sam the cook want to speak to me
wonder what he could be do there as i understood he wa sleep
on the ship i call out that he wa to come in now thi sam i should
sai hail from the cape and wa a person of mix blood the origin
stock i imagin wa malai which had been cross with indian cooli
also somewher or other there wa a dash of white and possibl but of
thi i am not sure a littl hottentot the result wa a person of
few vice and mani virtu sammi i mai sai at onc wa perhap the
biggest coward i ever met he could not help it it wa congenit
though curious enough thi cowardic of hi never prevent him from
rush into fresh danger thu he knew that the expedit upon which
i wa engag would be most hazard rememb hi weak i
explain thi to him veri clearli yet that knowledg did not deter him
from implor that he might be allow to accompani me perhap thi
wa becaus there wa some mutual attach between us as in the case
of han onc a good mani year befor i had rescu sammi from a
somewhat seriou scrape by declin to give evid against him i
need not enter into the detail but a certain sum of monei over which
he had control had disappear i will mere sai therefor that at
the time he wa engag to a colour ladi of veri expens tast
whom in the end he never marri
after thi as it chanc he nurs me through an ill henc the
attach of which i have spoken
sammi wa the son of a nativ christian preacher and brought up upon
what he call the word he had receiv an excel educ for a
person of hi class and in addit to mani nativ dialect with which
a vari career had made him acquaint spoke english perfectli though
in the most bombast style never would he us a short word if a long
on came to hi hand or rather to hi tongu for sever year of hi
life he wa i believ a teacher in a school at capetown where colour
person receiv their educ hi depart as he call it
be english languag and literatur
weari of or be dismiss from hi employ for some reason that
he never specifi he had drift up the coast to zanzibar where he
turn hi linguist abil to the studi of arab and becam the
manag or head cook of an hotel after a few year he lost thi billet
i know not how or why and appear at durban in what he call a
revers posit here it wa that we met again just befor my
expedit to pongoland
in manner he wa most polit in disposit most religi i believ
he wa a baptist by faith and in appear a small brown dandi of
a man of uncertain ag who wore hi hair part in the middl and
whatev the circumst wa alwai tidi in hi garment
i took him on becaus he wa in great distress an excel cook the
best of nurs and abov all for the reason that as i have said
we were in a wai attach to each other also he alwai amus me
intens which goe for someth on a long journei of the sort that i
contempl
such in brief wa sammi
as he enter the room i saw that hi cloth were veri wet and ask
him at onc if it were rain or whether he had got drunk and been
sleep in the damp grass
no mr quatermain he answer the morn is extrem fine and
like the poor hottentot han i have abjur the us of intoxic
though we differ on much els in thi matter we agre
then what the deuc is up i interrupt to cut short hi flow of
fine languag
sir there is troubl on the ship rememb mavovo i start at
these word where i pass the night in the compani of mr somer at
hi special request it wa the other wai about realli thi
morn befor the dawn when he thought that everybodi wa asleep the
portugues captain and some of hi arab began to weigh the anchor quit
quietli also to hoist the sail but mr somer and i be veri much
awak came out of the cabin and he sat upon the capstan with a revolv
in hi hand sayingwel sir i will not repeat what he said
no dont what happen then
then sir there follow much nois and confus the portuge and
the arab threaten mr somer but he sir continu to sit upon
the capstan with the stern courag of a rock in a rush stream and
remark that he would see them all somewher befor thei touch it
after thi sir i do not know what occur sinc while i watch from
the bulwark someon knock me head over heel into the sea and be
fortun a good swimmer i gain the shore and hurri here to
advis you
and did you advis anyon els you idiot i ask
ye sir as i sped along i commun to an offic of the port that
there wa the devil of a mess upon the maria which he would do well to
investig
by thi time i wa in my shirt and trouser and shout to mavovo and
the other soon thei arriv for as the costum of mavovo and hi
compani consist onli of a moocha and a blanket it did not take them
long to dress
mavovo i began there is troubl on the ship
o baba he interrupt with someth resembl a grin it is veri
strang but last night i dream that i told you
curs your dream i said gather the men and go downno that wont
work there would be murder done either it is all over now or it is
all right get the hunter readi i come with them the luggag can be
fetch afterward
within less than an hour we were at that wharf off which the maria
lai in what on dai will be the splendid port of durban though in
those time it ship arrang were exceedingli primit a
strangelook band we must have been i who wa complet dress
and i trust tidi march ahead next came han in the filthi wideawak
hat which he usual wore and greasi corduroi and after him the
oleagin sammi arrai in european reachmedown a billycock and a
bright blue tie stripe with red garment that would have look veri
smart had it not been for hi recent immers after him follow the
fiercelook mavovo and hi squad of hunter all of whom wore the
ring or isicoco as the zulu call it that is a circl of polish
black wax sewn into their short hair thei were a grim set of fellow
but as accord to a recent law it wa not allow for them to
appear arm in the town their gun had alreadi been ship while
their broad stab spear were roll up in their sleep mat the
blade wrap round with dri grass
each of them howev bore in hi hand a larg knobkerri of redwood
and thei march four by four in martial fashion it is true that when
we embark on the big boat to go to the ship much of their warlik
ardour evapor sinc these men who fear noth on the land were
terribl afraid of that unfamiliar element the water
we reach the maria an unimpos kind of tub and climb aboard
on look aft the first thing that i saw wa stephen seat on the
capstan with a pistol in hi hand as sammi had said near by lean
on the bulwark wa the villainouslook portuge delgado appar
in the worst of temper and surround by a number of equal
villainouslook arab sailor clad in dirti white in front wa the
captain of the port a wellknown and esteem gentleman of the name
of cato like myself a small man who had gone through mani adventur
accompani by some attend he wa seat on the afterskylight
smoke with hi ey fix upon stephen and the portuge
glad to see you quatermain he said there some row on here but
i have onli just arriv and dont understand portugues and the
gentleman on the capstan wont leav it to explain
what up stephen i ask after shake mr cato by the hand
what up repli somer thi man and he point to delgado
want to sneak out to sea with all our good that all to sai
noth of me and sammi whom no doubt hed have chuck overboard
as soon as he wa out of sight of land howev sammi who know
portugues overheard hi littl plan and as you see i object
well delgado wa ask for hi version of the affair and as i
expect explain that he onli intend to get a littl nearer to the
bar and there wait till we arriv of cours he li and knew that we
were awar of the fact and that hi intent had been to slip out to
sea with all our valuabl properti which he would sell after have
murder or maroon stephen and the poor cook but as noth could be
prove and we were now in strong enough forc to look after ourselv
and our belong i did not see the us of pursu the argument so i
accept the explan with a smile and ask everybodi to join in a
morn nip
afterward stephen told me that while i wa engag with mavovo on the
previou night a messag had reach him from sammi who wa on board
the ship in charg of our belong sai that he would be glad of
some compani know the cook nervou natur fortun enough
he made up hi mind at onc to go and sleep upon the maria in the
morn troubl aros as sammi had told me what he did not tell me wa
that he wa not knock overboard as he said but took to the water of
hi own accord when complic with delgado appear immin
i understand the posit i said and all well that end well but
it lucki you thought of come on board to sleep
after thi everyth went right i sent some of the men back in the
charg of stephen for our remain effect which thei brought safe
aboard and in the even we sail our voyag up to kilwa wa
beauti a gentl breez drive us forward over a sea so calm that
not even han who i think wa on of the worst sailor in the world
or the zulu hunter were realli sick though as sammi put it thei
declin their food
i think it wa on the fifth night of our voyag or it mai have been
the seventh that we anchor on afternoon off the island of kilwa not
veri far from the old portugues fort delgado with whom we had littl
to do dure the passag hoist some queer sort of signal in respons

aq you have been misinform nobl hassan she will not refit till
octob shall i read you the letter and i produc a piec of paper
from my pocket it mai be interest sinc my friend the captain
whom you rememb is name flower mention you in it he sai
hassan wave hi hand it is enough i see honour lord that you ar
a man of mettl not easili to be turn from your purpos in the name
of god the compassion land and go wheresoev you like
aq i think that i had almost rather wait until the crocodil come
in
h land land captain delgado get up the cargo and man your boat
mine too is at the servic of these lord you captain will like to
get awai by thi night tide there is still light lord quatermain
and such hospit as i can offer is at your servic
aq ah i knew bei hassan that you were onli joke with me when you
said that you wish us to go elsewher an excel jest truli from
on whose hospit is so famou well to fall in with your wish
we will come ashor thi even and if the captain delgado chanc to
sight the queen ship crocodil befor he sail perhap he will be
so good as to signal to us with a rocket
certainli certainli interrupt delgado who up to thi time had
pretend that he understood no english the tongu in which i wa
speak to the interpret sammi
then he turn and gave order to hi arab crew to bring up our
belong from the hold and to lower the maria boat
never did i see good transfer in quicker time within half an hour
everi on of our packag wa off that ship for stephen somer kept a
count of them our person baggag went into the maria boat and
the good togeth with the four donkei which were lower on to the
top of them were rumbl pellmel into the bargelik punt belong
to hassan here also i wa accommod with about half of our peopl
the rest take their seat in the smaller boat under the charg of
stephen
at length all wa readi and we cast off
farewel captain i cri to delgado if you should sight the
crocodil
at thi point delgado broke into such a torrent of bad languag in
portugues arab and english that i fear the rest of my remark never
reach him
as we row shoreward i observ that han who wa seat near to me
under the stomach of a jackass wa engag in snif at the side and
bottom of the barg as a dog might do and ask him what he wa about
veri odd smell in thi boat he whisper back in dutch it stink of
kaffir man just like the hold of the maria i think thi boat is us
to carri slave
be quiet i whisper back and stop nose at those plank but to
myself i thought han is right we ar in a nest of slavetrad and
thi hassan is their leader
we row past the island on which i observ the ruin of an old
portugues fort and some long grassroof hut where i reflect the
slave were probabl kept until thei could be ship awai observ my
glanc fix upon these hassan hasten to explain through sammi that
thei were storehous in which he dri fish and hide and kept good
how interest i answer further south we dry hide in the sun
cross a narrow channel we arriv at a rough jetti where we
disembark whenc we were led by hassan not to the villag which i now
saw upon our left but to a pleasantlook though dilapid
hous that stood a hundr yard from the shore someth about the
appear of thi hous impress me with the idea that it wa never
built by slaver the whole look of the place with it verandah and
garden suggest tast and civilis evid educ peopl had
design it and resid here i glanc about me and saw amidst a grove
of neglect orang tree that were surround with palm of some
ag the ruin of a church about thi there wa no doubt for there
surmount by a stone cross wa a littl penthous in which still hung
the bell that onc summon the worshipp to prayer
tell the english lord said hassan to sammi that these build
were a mission station of the christian who abandon them more than
twenti year ago when i came here i found them empti
inde i answer and what were the name of those who dwelt in
them
i never heard said hassan thei had been gone a long while when i
came
then we went up to the hous and for the next hour and more were
engag with our baggag which wa pile in a heap in what had been the
garden and in unpack and pitch two tent for the hunter which i
caus to be place immedi in front of the room that were assign
to us those room were remark in their wai mine had evid
been a sit chamber as i judg from some such broken articl of
furnitur that appear to be of american make that which stephen
occupi had onc serv as a sleepingplac for the bedstead of iron
still remain there also there were a hang bookcas now fallen
and some tatter remnant of book on of these that oddli enough wa
wellpreserv perhap becaus the white ant or other creatur did
not like the tast of it morocco bind wa a kebl christian
year on the titlepag of which wa written to my dearest elizabeth
on her birthdai from her husband i took the liberti to put it in my
pocket on the wall moreov still hung the small watercolour pictur
of a veri pretti young woman with fair hair and blue ey in the corner
of which pictur wa written in the same handwrit as that in the
book elizabeth ag twenti thi also i annex think that it
might come in us as a piec of evid
look as if the owner of thi place had left it in a hurri
quatermain said stephen
that it my boi or perhap thei didnt leav perhap thei stop
here
murder
i nod and said i dare sai friend hassan could tell us someth
about the matter meanwhil as supper isnt readi yet let us have a
look at that church while it is light
we walk through the palm and orang grove to where the build stood
fine place upon a mound it wa wellconstruct of a kind of coral
rock and a glanc show us that it had been gut by fire the
discolour wall told their own tale the interior wa now full of
shrub and creeper and an ugli yellowish snake glide from what had
been the stone altar without the graveyard wa enclos by a broken
wall onli we could see no trace of grave near the gatewai howev
wa a rough mound
if we could dig into that i said i expect we should find the bone
of the peopl who inhabit thi place doe that suggest anyth to
you stephen
noth except that thei were probabl kill
you should learn to draw infer it is a us art especi in
africa it suggest to me that if you ar right the deed wa not done
by nativ who would never take the troubl to buri the dead arab
on the contrari might do so especi if there were ani bastard
portugues among them who call themselv christian but whatev
happen must have been a long while ago and i point to a selfsown
hardwood tree grow from the mound which could scarc have been less
than twenti year old
we return to the hous to find that our meal wa readi hassan had
ask us to dine with him but for obviou reason i prefer that
sammi should cook our food and that he should dine with us he appear
full of compliment though i could see hate and suspicion in hi ey
and we fell to on the kid that we had bought from him for i did not
wish to accept ani gift from thi fellow our drink wa squarefac
gin mix with water that i sent han to fetch with hi own hand from
the stream that ran by the hous lest otherwis it should be drug
at first hassan like a good mohammedan refus to touch ani spirit
but as the meal went on he polit relent upon thi point and i
pour him out a liber tot the appetit come in eat as the
frenchman said and the same thing appli to drink so at least it
wa in hassan case who probabl thought that the quantiti swallow
made no differ to hi sin after the third dose of squarefac he
grew quit amiabl and talk think the opportun a good on
i sent for sammi and through him told our host that we were anxiou to
hire twenti porter to carri our packag he declar that there wa
not such a thing as a porter within a hundr mile whereon i gave him
some more gin the end of it wa that we struck a bargain i forget for
how much he promis to find us twenti good men who were to stai with
us for as long as we want them
then i ask him about the destruct of the mission station but
although he wa halfdrunk on thi point he remain veri close all he
would sai wa that he had heard that twenti year ago the peopl call
the mazitu who were veri fierc had raid right down to the coast and
kill those who dwelt there except a white man and hi wife who had
fled inland and never been seen again
how mani of them were buri in that mound by the church i ask
quickli
who told you thei were buri there he repli with a start but
see hi mistak went on i do not know what you mean i never heard
of anyon be buri sleep well honour lord i must go and see to
the load of my good upon the maria then rise he salaam and
walk or rather roll awai
so the maria hasnt sail after all i said and whistl in a
certain fashion instantli han crept into the room out of the dark
for thi wa my signal to him
han i said i hear sound upon that island slip down to the shore
and spy out what is happen no on will see you if you ar care
no baa he answer with a grin i do not think that anyon will
see han if he is care especi at night and he slid awai as
quietli as he had come
now i went out and spoke to mavovo tell him to keep a good watch
and to be sure that everi man had hi gun readi as i thought that these
peopl were slavetrad and might attack us in the night
in that event i said thei were to fall back upon the stoep but not to
fire until i gave the word
good my father he answer thi is a lucki journei i never
thought there would be hope of war so soon my snake forgot to mention
it the other night sleep safe macumazana noth that walk shall
reach you while we live
dont be so sure i answer and we lai down in the bedroom with our
cloth on and our rifl by our side
the next thing i rememb wa someon shake me by the shoulder i
thought it wa stephen who had agre to keep awak for the first part
of the night and to call me at on in the morn inde he wa awak
for i could see the glow from the pipe he smoke
baa whisper the voic of han i have found out everyth thei
ar load the maria with slave take them in big boat from the
island
so i answer but how did you get here ar the hunter asleep
without
he chuckl no thei ar not asleep thei look with all their ey and
listen with all their ear yet old han pass through them even the
baa somer did not hear him
that i didnt said stephen thought a rat wa move no more
i step through the place where the door had been on to the stoep
by the light of the fire which the hunter had lit without i could see
mavovo sit wide awak hi gun upon hi knee and beyond him two
sentri i call him and point to han
see i said what good watchmen you ar when on can step over your
head and enter my room without your know it
mavovo look at the hottentot and felt hi cloth and boot to see
whether thei were wet with the night dew
ow he exclaim in a surli voic i said that noth which walk
could reach you macumazana but thi yellow snake ha crawl between
us on hi belli look at the new mud that stain hi waistcoat
yet snake can bite and kill answer han with a snigger oh you
zulu think that you ar veri brave and shout and flourish spear and
battleax on poor hottentot dog is worth a whole impi of you after
all no dont try to strike me mavovo the warrior sinc we both serv
the same master in our separ wai when it come to fight i will
leav the matter to you but when it is a case of watch or spy
do you leav it to han look here mavovo and he open hi hand in
which wa a horn snuffbox such as zulu sometim carri in their ear
to whom doe thi belong
it is mine said mavovo and you have stolen it
ye jeer han it is your also i stole it from your ear as i
pass you in the dark dont you rememb that you thought a gnat had
tickl you and hit up at your face
it is true growl mavovo and you snake of a hottentot ar great
in your own low wai yet next time anyth tickl me i shall strike
not with my hand but with a spear
then i turn them both out remark to stephen that thi wa a good
exampl of the etern fight between courag and cun after thi as
i wa sure that hassan and hi friend were too busi to interfer with
us that night we went to bed and slept the sleep of the just
when i got up the next morn i found that stephen somer had alreadi
risen and gone out nor did he appear until i wa half through my
breakfast
where on earth have you been i ask note that hi cloth were
torn and cover with wet moss
up the tallest of those palm tree quatermain saw an arab climb
on of them with a rope and got anoth arab to teach me the trick it
isnt realli difficult though it look alarm
what in the name of good i began
oh he interrupt my rule passion look through the glass i
thought i caught sight of an orchid grow near the crown so went
up it wasnt an orchid after all onli a mass of yellow pollen but i
learn someth for my pain sit in the top of that palm i saw
the maria work out from under the lee of the island also far
awai i note a streak of smoke and watch it through the glass
made out what look to me uncommonli like a manofwar steam slowli
along the coast in fact i am sure it wa and english too then the
mist came up and i lost sight of them
my word i said that will be the crocodil what i told our host
hassan wa not altogeth bunkum mr cato the port offic at durban
mention to me that the crocodil wa expect to call there within
the next fortnight to take in store after a slavehunt cruis down
the coast now it would be odd if she chanc to meet the maria and
ask to have a look at her cargo wouldnt it
not at all quatermain for unless on or the other of them chang her
cours that is just what she must do within the next hour or so and i
jolli well hope she will i havent forgiven that beast delgado the
trick he tri to plai on us by slip awai with our good to sai
noth of those poor devil of slave pass the coffe will you
for the next ten minut we at in silenc for stephen had an excel
appetit and wa hungri after hi morn climb
just as we finish our meal hassan appear look even more
villain than he had done the previou dai i saw also that he wa
in a trucul mood induc perhap by the headach from which he wa
evid suffer as a result of hi potat or perhap the fact
that the maria had got safe awai with the slave as he imagin
unobserv by us wa the caus of the chang of hi demeanour a third
altern mai have been that he intend to murder us dure the
previou night and found no safe opportun of carri out hi amiabl
scheme
we salut him courteous but without salaam in repli he ask me
bluntli through sammi when we intend to be gone as such christian
dog defil hi hous which he want for himself
i answer as soon as the twenti bearer whom he had promis us
appear but not befor
you lie he said i never promis you bearer i have none here
do you mean that you ship them all awai in the maria with the
slave last night i ask sweetli
my reader have you ever taken note of the appear and proceed
of a tomcat of establish ag and moros disposit when a littl
dog suddenli disturb it on the prowl have you observ how it contort
itself into arch but unnatur shape how it swell visibl to almost
twice it normal size how it hair stand up and it ey flash and
the stream of unmention languag that proce from it open mouth
if so you will have a veri good idea of the effect produc upon hassan
by thi remark of mine the fellow look as though he were go to
burst with rage he roll about hi bloodshot ey seem to protrud
he curs us horribl he put hi hand upon the hilt of the great knife
he wore and final he did what the tomcat doe he spat
now stephen wa stand with me look as cool as a cucumb and
veri much amus and be as it chanc a littl nearer to hassan
than i wa receiv the full benefit of thi rude proceed my word
didnt it wake him up he said someth strong and the next second
flew at the halfbre like a tiger land him a beauti straight upon
the nose back stagger hassan draw hi knife as he did so but
stephen left in the ey caus him to drop it as he drop himself
i pounc upon the knife and sinc it wa too late to interfer for
the mischief had been done let thing take their cours and held back
the zulu who had rush up at the nois
hassan rose and to do him credit came on like a man head down hi
great skull caught stephen who wa the lighter of the two in the chest
and knock him over but befor the arab could follow up the advantag
he wa on hi feet again then ensu a realli gloriou mill hassan
fought with head and fist and feet stephen with fist alon dodg
hi oppon rush he gave it to him as he pass and soon hi
cool and silenc began to tell onc he wa knock over by a hook
on under the jaw but in the next round he sent the arab liter
fly head over heel oh how those zulu cheer and i too danc
with delight up hassan came again spit out sever teeth and
adopt new tactic grab stephen round the middl to and fro thei
swung the arab try to kick the englishman with hi knee and to bite
him also till the pain remind him of the absenc of hi front teeth
onc he nearli got him downnearli but not quit for the collar by
which he had grip him hi object wa to strangl burst and at that
junctur hassan turban fell over hi face blind him for a moment
then stephen grip him round the middl with hi left arm and with hi
right pommel him unmercifulli till he sank in a sit posit to
the ground and held up hi hand in token of surrend
the nobl english lord ha beaten me he gasp
apologis yell stephen pick up a hand of mud or i shove
thi down your dirti throat
he seem to understand at ani rate he bow till hi forehead touch
the ground and apologis veri thoroughli
now that is over i said cheerfulli to him so how about those
bearer
i have no bearer he answer
you dirti liar i exclaim on of my peopl ha been down to your
villag there and sai it is full of men
then go and take them for yourself he repli vicious for he knew
that the place wa stockad
now i wa in a fix it wa all veri well to give a slavedeal the
thrash he deserv but if he chose to attack us with hi arab we
should be in a poor wai watch me with the ey that wa not bung
up hassan guess my perplex
i have been beaten like a dog he said hi rage return to him with
hi breath but god is compassion and just he will aveng in due
time
the word had not left hi lip for on second when from somewher out
at sea there float the sullen boom of a great gun at thi moment
too an arab rush up from the shore cry
where is the bei hassan
here i said point at him
the arab stare until i thought hi ey would drop out for the bei
hassan wa inde a sight to see then he gabbl in a frighten voic
captain an english manofwar is chase the maria
boom went the great gun for the second time hassan said noth but
hi jaw drop and i saw that he had lost exactli three teeth
that is the crocodil i remark slowli caus sammi to
translat and as i spoke produc from my inner pocket a union jack
which i had place there after i heard that the ship wa sight
stephen i went on as i shook it out if you have got your wind
would you mind climb up that palm tree again and signal with thi
to the crocodil out at sea
by georg that a good idea said stephen whose jovial face
although swollen wa now again wreath in smile han bring me a
long stick and a bit of string
but hassan did not think it at all a good idea
english lord he gasp you shall have the bearer i will go to
fetch them
no you wont i said you will stop here as a hostag send that
man
hassan utter some rapid order and the messeng sped awai thi time
toward the stockad villag on the right
as he went anoth messeng arriv who also stare amazedli at the
condit of hi chief
beyif you ar the bei he said in a doubt voic for by now
the amiabl face of hassan had begun to swell and colour with the
telescop we have seen that the english manofwar ha sent a boat and
board the maria
god is great mutter the discomfit hassan and delgado who is a
thief and a traitor from hi mother breast will tell the truth the
english son of satan will land here all is finish noth is left
but flight bid the peopl fly into the bush and take the slavesi mean
their servant i will join them
no you wont i interrupt through sammi at ani rate not at
present you will come with us
the miser hassan reflect then he ask
lord quatermain i rememb the titl becaus it is the nearest i
ever got or am like to get to the peerag if i furnish you with
the twenti bearer and accompani you for some dai on your journei
inland will you promis not to signal to your countrymen on the ship
and bring them ashor
what do you think i ask of stephen
oh he answer i think id agre thi scoundrel ha had a pretti
good dust and if onc the crocodil peopl land therel be an
end of our expedit as sure as egg ar egg thei will carri us off
to zanzibar or somewher to give evid befor a slave court also
noth will be gain for by the time the sailor get here all these
rascal will have bolt except our friend hassan you see it isnt
as though we were sure he would be hung hed probabl escap after all
intern law subject of a foreign power no direct proofthat
kind of thing you know
give me a minut or two i said and began to reflect veri deepli
whilst i wa thu engag sever thing happen i saw twenti nativ
be escort toward us doubtless the bearer who had been promis
also i saw mani other accompani by other nativ fly from the
villag into the bush lastli a third messeng arriv who announc
that the maria wa sail awai appar in charg of a prizecrew
and that the manofwar wa put about as though to accompani her
evid she had no intent of effect a land upon what wa
nomin at ani rate portugues territori therefor if anyth wa
to be done we must act at onc
well the end of it wa that like a fool i accept stephen advic
and did noth alwai the easiest cours and gener that which
lead to most troubl ten minut afterward i chang my mind but
then it wa too late the crocodil wa out of signal distanc
thi wa subsequ to a convers with han
baa said that worthi in hi leeri fashion i think you have made a
mistak you forget that these yellow devil in white robe who have
run awai will come back again and that when you return from up countri
thei mai be wait for you now if the english manofwar had destroi
their town and their slavesh thei might have gone somewher els
howev he ad as an afterthought glanc at the disfigur
hassan we have their captain and of cours you mean to hang him
baa or if you dont like to leav it to me i can hang men veri well
onc when i wa young i help the execution at cape town
get out i said but nevertheless i knew that han wa right
chapter vi
the slave road
the twenti bearer have arriv in charg of five or six arab arm
with gun we went to inspect them take hassan with us also
the hunter thei were a like lot of men though rather thin and
scaredlook and evid as i could see from their physic
appear and vari method of dress the hair member of
differ tribe have deliv them the arab or rather on of
them enter into excit convers with hassan as sammi wa not
at hand i do not know what wa said although i gather that thei were
contempl hi rescu if so thei gave up the idea and began to run
awai as their companion had done on of them howev a bolder fellow
than the rest turn and fire at me he miss by some yard as i
could tell from the sing of the bullet for these arab ar execr
shot still hi attempt at murder irrit me so much that i
determin he should not go scotfre i wa carri the littl rifl
call intombi that with which as han had remind me i shot the
vultur at dingaan kraal mani year befor of cours i could have
kill the man but thi i did not wish to do or i could have shot him
through the leg but then we should have had to nurs him or leav him
to die so i select hi right arm which wa outstretch as he fled
and at about fifti pace put a bullet through it just abov the elbow
there i said to the zulu as i saw it doubl up that low fellow
will never shoot at anyon again
pretti macumazana veri pretti said mavovo but as you can aim so
well why not have chosen hi head that bullet is halfwast
next i set to work to get into commun with the bearer who
thought poor devil that thei had been but sold to a new master here
i mai explain that thei were slave not meant for export but men
kept to cultiv hassan garden fortun i found that two of them
belong to the mazitu peopl who it mai be rememb ar of the
same blood as the zulu although thei separ from the parent stock
gener ago these men talk a dialect that i could understand
though at first not veri easili the foundat of it wa zulu but it
had becom much mix with the languag of other tribe whose women the
mazitu had taken to wife
also there wa a man who could speak some bastard arab suffici
well for sammi to convers with him
i ask the mazitu if thei knew the wai back to their countri thei
answer ye but it wa far off a full month journei i told them
that if thei would guid us thither thei should receiv their freedom
and good pai ad that if the other men serv us well thei also
should be set free when we had done with them on receiv thi
inform the poor wretch smile in a sickli fashion and look at
hassanbenmoham who glower at them and us from the box on which
he wa seat in charg of mavovo
how can we be free while that man live their look seem to sai as
though to confirm their doubt hassan who understood or guess what
wa pass ask by what right we were promis freedom to hi
slave
by right of that i answer point to the union jack which stephen
still had in hi hand also we will pai you for them when we return
accord as thei have serv us
ye he mutter you will pai me for them when you return or
perhap befor that englishman
it wa three oclock in the afternoon befor we were abl to make a
start there wa so much to be arrang that it might have been wiser
to wait till the morrow had we not determin that if we could help it
noth would induc us to spend anoth night in that place blanket
were serv out to each of the bearer who poor nake creatur seem
quit touch at the gift of them the load were apport have
alreadi been pack at durban in case such as on man could carri the
pack saddl were put upon the four donkei which prove to be none the
wors for their journei and burden to a weight of about 100 lb each
fix on them in waterproof hide bag besid cook calabash and
sleep mat which han produc from somewher probabl he stole them
out of the desert villag but as thei were necessari to us i confess
i ask no question lastli six or eight goat which were wander
about were captur to take with us for food till we could find game
for these i offer to pai hassan but when i hand him the monei he
threw it down in a rage so i pick it up and put it in my pocket again
with a clear conscienc
at length everyth wa more or less readi and the question aros as
to what wa to be done with hassan the zulu like han wish to kill
him as sammi explain to him in hi best arab then thi murder
fellow show what a coward he wa at heart he flung himself upon hi
knee he wept he invok us in the name of the compassion allah
who he explain wa after all the same god that we worship till
mavovo grow impati of the nois threaten him with hi kerri
whereon he becam silent the easynatur stephen wa for let him
go a plan that seem to have advantag for then at least we should
be rid of hi abomin compani after reflect howev i decid
that we had better take him along with us at ani rate for a dai or so
to hold as a hostag in case the arab should follow and attack us at
first he refus to stir but the assegai of on of the zulu hunter
press gentli against what remain of hi robe furnish an argument
that he could not resist
at length we were off i with the two guid went ahead then came the
bearer then half of the hunter then the four donkei in charg of
han and sammi then hassan and the rest of the hunter except mavovo
who brought up the rear with stephen needless to sai all our rifl
were load and gener we were prepar for ani emerg the onli
path that which the guid said we must follow ran by the seashor
for a few hundr yard and then turn inland through hassan villag
where he live for it seem that the old mission hous wa not us by
him as we march along a littl rocki cliffit wa not more than ten
feet highwher a deepwat channel perhap fifti yard in breadth
separ the mainland from the island whenc the slave had been load
on to the maria some difficulti aros about the donkei on of these
slip it load and anoth began to buck and evinc an inclin to
leap into the sea with it preciou burden the rearguard of hunter ran
to get hold of it when suddenli there wa a splash
the brute in i thought to myself till a shout told me that not
the ass but hassan had depart over the cliff edg watch hi
opportun and be it wa clear a firstrat swimmer he had flung
himself backward in the midst of the confus and fall into deep
water promptli dive about twenti yard from the shore he came up for
a moment then dive again head for the island i dare sai i could
have pot him through the head with a snap shot but somehow i did
not like to kill a man swim for hi life as though he were a
hippopotamu or a crocodil moreov the bold of the manoeuvr
appeal to me so i refrain from fire and call to the other to
do likewis
as our late host approach the shore of the island i saw arab run
down the rock to help him out of the water either thei had not left
the place or had reoccupi it as soon as hm crocodil had
vanish with her prize as it wa clear that to recaptur hassan would
involv an attack upon the garrison of the island which we were in no
posit to carri out i gave order for the march to be resum these
the difficulti with the donkei have been overcom were obei at
onc
it wa fortun that we did not delai for scarc had the caravan got
into motion when the arab on the island began to fire at us luckili no
on wa hit and we were soon round a point and under cover also their
shoot wa as bad as usual on missil howev it wa a potleg
struck a donkeyload and smash a bottl of good brandi and a tin of
preserv butter thi made me angri so motion to the other to
proce i took shelter behind a tree and wait till a torn and dirti
turban which i recognis as that of hassan poke up abov a rock
well i put a bullet through that turban for i saw the thing fly but
unfortun not through the head beneath it have left thi ppc
card on our host i bolt from the rock and caught up the other
present we pass round the villag through it i would not go for
fear of an ambuscad it wa quit a big place enclos with a strong
fenc but hidden from the sea by a rise in the interven land in the
centr wa a larg easternlook hous where doubtless hassan
dwelt with hi harem after we had gone a littl wai further to my
astonish i saw flame break out from the palmleaf roof of thi
hous at the time i could not imagin how thi happen but when
a dai or two later i observ han wear a pair of larg and veri
handsom gold pendant in hi ear and a gold bracelet on hi wrist and
found that he and on of the hunter were extrem well set up in the
matter of british sovereignswel i had my doubt in due cours
the truth came out he and the hunter an adventur spirit slip
through a gate in the fenc without be observ ran across the
desert villag to the hous stole the ornament and monei from the
women apart and as thei depart fire the place in exchang
for the bottl of good brandi as han explain
i wa inclin to be angri but after all as we had been fire on
hanss exploit becam an act of war rather than a theft so i made him
and hi companion divid the gold equal with the rest of the hunter
who no doubt had kept their ey conveni shut not forget
sammi and said no more thei net 8 apiec which pleas them veri
much in addit to thi i gave 1 each or rather good to that valu
to the bearer as their share of the loot
hassan i remark wa evid a great agriculturist for the garden
which he work by slave labour were beauti and must have brought
him in a larg revenu
pass through these garden we came to slope land cover with bush
here the track wa not too good for the creeper hamper our progress
inde i wa veri glad when toward sunset we reach the crest of a
hill and emerg upon a tableland which wa almost clear of tree and
rose gradual till it met the horizon in that bush we might easili
have been attack but in thi open countri i wa not so much afraid
sinc the loss to the arab would have been great befor we were
overpow as a matter of fact although spi dog us for dai no
assault wa ever attempt
find a conveni place by a stream we camp for the night but as
it wa so fine did not pitch the tent afterward i wa sorri that
we had not gone further from the water sinc the mosquito bred by
million in the marsh border the stream gave us a dread time on
poor stephen fresh from england thei fell with peculiar feroc with
the result that in the morn what between the bruis left by hassan
and their bite he wa a spectacl for men and angel anoth thing
that broke our rest wa the necess of keep a strict watch in case
the slavetrad should elect to attack us in the hour of dark
also to guard against the possibl of our bearer run awai and
perhap steal the good it is true that befor thei went to sleep i
explain to them veri clearli that ani of them who attempt to give us
the slip would certainli be seen and shot wherea if thei remain with
us thei would be treat with everi kind thei answer through the
two mazitu that thei had nowher to go and did not wish to fall again
into the power of hassan of whom thei spoke liter with shudder
point the while to their scar back and the mark of the slave
yoke upon their neck their protest seem and inde prove to
be sincer but of thi of cours we could not then be sure
as i wa engag at sunris in make certain that the donkei had not
strai and gener that all wa well i note through the thin mist
a littl white object which at first i thought wa a small bird sit
on an upright stick about fifti yard from the camp i went toward it
and discov that it wa not a bird but a fold piec of paper stuck
in a cleft wand such as nativ often us for the carri of letter
i open the paper and with great difficulti for the write within wa
bad portugues read as follow
english devilsdo not think that you have escap me i know
where you ar go and if you live through the journei it will
be but to die at my hand after all i tell you that i have at my
command three hundr brave men arm with gun who worship allah
and thirst for the blood of christian dog with these i will
follow and if you fall into my hand aliv you shall learn what
it is to die by fire or pin over antheap in the sun let us
see if your english manofwar will help you then or your fals
god either misfortun go with you whiteskin robber of
honest men
thi pleas epistl wa unsign but it anonym author wa not
hard to identifi i show it to stephen who wa so infuri at it
content that he manag to dab some ammonia with which he wa treat
hi mosquito bite into hi ey when at length the pain wa sooth by
bath we concoct thi answer
murder known among men as hassanbenmohammedtruli we sin
in not hang you when you were in our power oh wolf who grow
fat upon the blood of the innoc thi is a fault that we shall
not commit again your death is near to you and we believ at our
hand come with all your villain whenev you will the more
there ar of them the better we shall be pleas who would rather
rid the world of mani fiend than of a few
till we meet again allan quatermain
stephen somer
neat if not christian i said when i had read the letter over
ye repli stephen but perhap just a littl bombast in tone if
that gentleman did arriv with three hundr arm meneh
then my boi i answer in thi wai or in that we shall thrash him
i dont often have an inspir but iv got on now and it is to
the effect that mr hassan ha not veri long to live and that we shall
be intim connect with hi end wait till you have seen a slave
caravan and you will understand my feel also i know these gentri
that littl propheci of our will get upon hi nerv and give him a
foretast of thing han go and set thi letter in that cleft stick
the postman will call for it befor long
as it happen within a few dai we did see a slave caravan some of
the merchandis of the estim hassan
we had been make good progress through a beauti and healthi
countri steer almost due west or rather a littl to the north of
west the land wa undul and rich wellwat and onli bushclad
in the neighbourhood of the stream the higher ground be open of
a parklik charact and dot here and there with tree it wa
evid that onc and not veri long ago the popul had been dens
for we came to the remain of mani villag or rather town with larg
marketplac now howev these were burn with fire or desert
or occupi onli by a few old bodi who got a live from the overgrown
garden these poor peopl who sat desol and croon in the sun or
perhap work feebli at the onc fertil field would fly scream
at our approach for to them men arm with gun must of necess be
slavetrad
still from time to time we contriv to catch some of them and through
on member of our parti or the other to get at their stori realli it
wa all on stori the slave arab on thi pretext or on that had
set tribe against tribe then thei side with the stronger and conquer
the weaker by aid of their terribl gun kill out the old folk and
take the young men women and children except the infant whom thei
butcher to be sold as slave it seem that the busi had begun
about twenti year befor when hassanbenmoham and hi companion
arriv at kilwa and drove awai the missionari who had built a station
there
at first thi trade wa extrem easi and profit sinc the
raw materi lai near at hand in plenti by degre howev the
neighbour commun had been work out countless number of them
were kill while the pick of the popul pass under the slave
yoke and those of them who surviv vanish in ship to unknown
land thu it came about that the slaver were oblig to go further
afield and even to conduct their raid upon the border of the territori
of the great mazitu peopl the inland race of zulu origin of whom i
have spoken accord to our inform it wa even rumour that thei
propos shortli to attack these mazitu in forc reli on their gun
to give them the victori and open to them a new and almost inexhaust
store of splendid human merchandis meanwhil thei were clean out
certain small tribe which hitherto had escap them ow to the fact
that thei had their resid in bush or among difficult hill
the track we follow wa the recognis slave road of thi we soon
becam awar by the number of skeleton which we found ly in the
tall grass at it side some of them with heavi slavestick still upon
their wrist these i suppos had di from exhaust but other as
their split skull show had been dispos of by their captor
on the eighth dai of our march we struck the track of a slave caravan
it had been travel toward the coast but for some reason or other
had turn back thi mai have been becaus it leader had been warn
of the approach of our parti or perhap thei had heard that anoth
caravan which wa at work in a differ district wa draw near
bring it slave with it and wish to wait for it arriv in order
that thei might join forc
the spoor of these peopl wa easi to follow first we found the bodi
of a boi of about ten then vultur reveal to us the remain of two
young men on of whom had been shot and the other kill by a blow from
an ax their corps were roughli hidden beneath some grass i know not
why a mile or two further on we heard a child wail and found it by
follow it cri it wa a littl girl of about four who had been
pretti though now she wa but a live skeleton when she saw us she
scrambl awai on all four like a monkei stephen follow her while
i sick at heart went to get a tin of preserv milk from our
store present i heard him call to me in a horrifi voic rather
reluctantli for i knew that he must have found someth dread
i push my wai through the bush to where he wa there bound to the
trunk of a tree sat a young woman evid the mother of the child
for it clung to her leg
thank god she wa still live though she must have di befor anoth
dai dawn we cut her loos and the zulu hunter who ar kind folk
enough when thei ar not at war carri her to camp in the end with
much troubl we save the live of that mother and child i sent for the
two mazitu with whom i could by now talk fairli well and ask them
why the slaver did these thing
thei shrug their shoulder and on of them answer with a rather
dread laugh
becaus chief these arab be blackheart kill those who can
walk no more or tie them up to die if thei let them go thei might
recov and escap and it make the arab sad that those who have been
their slave should live to be free and happi
doe it doe it inde exclaim stephen with a snort of rage that
remind me of hi father well if ever i get a chanc ill make them
sad with a vengeanc
stephen wa a tenderheart young man and for all hi soft and
indol wai an awkward custom when rous
within fortyeight hour he got hi chanc thu that dai we camp
earli for two reason the first wa that the woman and child we had
rescu wee so weak thei could not walk without rest and we had no men
to spare to carri them the second that we came to an ideal spot to
pass the night it wa as usual a desert villag through which ran a
beauti stream of water here we took possess of some outli hut
with a fenc round them and as mavovo had manag to shoot a fat eland
cow and her halfgrown calf we prepar to have a regular feast whilst
sammi wa make some broth for the rescu woman and stephen and i
smoke our pipe and watch him han slip through the broken gate
of the thorn fenc or boma and announc that arab were come two
lot of them with mani slave
we ran out to look and saw that as he had said two caravan were
approach or rather had reach the villag but at some distanc
from us and were now camp on what had onc been the marketplac
on of these wa that whose track we had follow although dure the
last few hour of our march we had struck awai from it chiefli becaus
we could not bear such sight as i have describ it seem to compris
about two hundr and fifti slave and over forti guard all black men
carri gun and most of them by their dress arab or bastard arab
in the second caravan which approach from anoth direct were not
more than on hundr slave and about twenti or thirti captor
now i said let us eat our dinner and then if you like we will
go to call upon those gentlemen just to show that we ar not afraid
of them han get the flag and tie it to the top of that tree it will
show them to what countri we belong
up went the union jack duli and present through our glass we saw
the slaver run about in a state of excit also we saw the poor
slave turn and stare at the bit of flap bunt and then begin to
talk to each other it struck me as possibl that someon among their
number had seen a union jack in the hand of an english travel or
had heard of it as fly upon ship or at point on the coast and what
it meant to slave or thei mai have understood some of the remark of
the arab which no doubt were point and explanatori at ani rate
thei turn and stare till the arab ran among them with sjambock
that is whip of hippopotamu hide and suppress their anim
convers with mani blow
at first i thought that thei would break camp and march awai inde
thei began to make prepar to do thi then abandon the idea
probabl becaus the slave were exhaust and there wa no other water
thei could reach befor nightfal in the end thei settl down and lit
cook fire also as i observ thei took precaut against attack
by station sentri and forc the slave to construct a boma of
thorn about their camp
well said stephen when we had finish our dinner ar you readi
for that call
no i answer i do not think that i am i have been consid
thing and conclud that we had better leav well alon by thi time
those arab will know all the stori of our deal with their worthi
master hassan for no doubt he ha sent messeng to them therefor
if we go to their camp thei mai shoot us at sight or if thei receiv
us well thei mai offer hospit and poison us or cut our throat
suddenli our posit might be better still it is on that i believ
thei would find difficult to take so in my opinion we had better stop
still and await develop
stephen grumbl someth about my be overcauti but i took no
heed of him on thing i did do howev send for han i told him
to take on of the mazitui dare not risk them both for thei were our
guidesand anoth of the nativ whom we had borrow from hassan
a bold fellow who knew all the local languag and creep down to the
slaver camp as soon as it wa quit dark there i order him to find
out what he could and if possibl to mix with the slave and explain
that we were their friend han nod for thi wa exactli the kind
of task that appeal to him and went off to make hi prepar
stephen and i also made some prepar in the wai of strengthen
our defenc build larg watchfir and set sentri
the night fell and han with hi companion depart stealthili as
snake the silenc wa intens save for the occasion wail of
the slave which now and again broke out in burst of melancholi sound
lalulalua and then di awai to be follow by horrid scream
as the arab laid their lash upon some poor wretch onc too a shot
wa fire
thei have seen han said stephen
i think not i answer for if so there would have been more than
on shot either it wa an accid or thei were murder a slave
after thi noth more happen for a long while till at length han
seem to rise out of the ground in front of me and behind him i saw
the figur of the mazitu and the other man
tell your stori i said
baa it is thi between us we have learn everyth the arab know
all about you and what men you have hassan ha sent them order to kill
you it is well that you did not go to visit them for certainli you
would have been murder we crept near and overheard their talk thei
purpos to attack us at dawn tomorrow morn unless we leav thi
place befor which thei will know of as we ar be watch
and if so what then i ask
then baa thei will attack as we ar make up the caravan or
immedi afterward as we begin to march
inde anyth more han
ye baa these two men crept among the slave and spoke with
them thei ar veri sad those slave and mani of them have di of
heartpain becaus thei have been taken from their home and do not know
where thei ar go i saw on die just now a young woman she
wa talk to anoth woman and seem quit well onli tire till
suddenli she said in a loud voic i am go to die that i mai come
back as a spirit and bewitch these devil till thei ar spirit too
then she call upon the fetish of her tribe put her hand to her
breast and fell down dead at least ad han spit reflect
she did not fall quit down becaus the slavestick held her head off
the ground the arab were veri angri both becaus she had curs them
and wa dead on of them came and kick her bodi and afterward shot
her littl boi who wa sick becaus the mother had curs them but
fortun he did not see us becaus we were in the dark far from the
fire
anyth more han
on thing baa these two men lent the knive you gave them to two
of the boldest among the slave that thei might cut the cord of the
slavestick and the other cord with which thei were ti and then
pass them down the line that their brother might do the same but
perhap the arab will find it out and then the mazitu and the other
must lose their knive that is all ha the baa a littl tobacco
now stephen i said when han had gone and i had explain
everyth there ar two cours open to us either we can try to give
these gentlemen the slip at onc in which case we must leav the woman
and child to their fate or we can stop where we ar and wait to be
attack
i wont run said stephen sullenli it would be cowardli to desert
that poor creatur also we should have a wors chanc march
rememb han said that thei ar watch us
then you would wait to be attack
isnt there a third altern quatermain to attack them
that the idea i said let us send for mavovo
present he came and sat down in front of us while i set out the case
to him
it is the fashion of my peopl to attack rather than to be attack
and yet my father in thi case my heart is against it han he
call him inblatu a zulu word which mean spot snake that wa
the hottentot kaffir name sai that there ar quit sixti of the
yellow dog all arm with gun wherea we have not more than fifteen
for we cannot trust the slave men also he sai that thei ar within a
strong fenc and awak with spi out so that it will be difficult to
surpris them but here father we ar in a strong fenc and cannot be
surpris also men who tortur and kill women and children except in
war must i think be coward and will come on faintli against good
shoot if inde thei come at all therefor i sai wait till
the buffalo shall either charg or run but the word is with you
macumazana wise watcherbynight not with me your hunter speak you
who ar old in war and i will obei
you argu well i answer also anoth reason come to my mind
those arab brute mai get behind the slave of whom we should butcher
a lot without hurt them stephen i think we had better see the thing
through here
all right quatermain onli i hope that mavovo is wrong in think
that those blackguard mai chang their mind and run awai
realli young man you ar becom veri bloodthirstyfor an orchid
grower i remark look at him now for my part i devoutli hope
that mavovo is right for let me tell you if he isnt it mai be a nasti
job
iv alwai been peac enough up to the present repli stephen
but the sight of those unhappi wretch of slave with their head cut
open and of the woman ti to a tree to starv
make you wish to usurp the function of god almighti i said well
it is a natur impuls and perhap in the circumst on that will
not displeas him and now as we have made up our mind what we ar
go to do let get to busi so that these arab gentlemen mai find
their breakfast readi when thei come to call
chapter vii
the rush of the slave
well we did all that we could in the wai of make readi after we had
strengthen the thorn fenc of our boma as much as possibl and lit
sever larg fire outsid of it to give us light i allot hi place
to each of the hunter and saw that their rifl were in order and that
thei had plenti of ammunit then i made stephen lie down to sleep
tell him that i would wake him to watch later on thi howev
i had no intent of do as i want him to rise fresh and with a
steadi nerv on the occas of hi first fight
as soon as i saw that hi ey were shut i sat down on a box to think
to tell the truth i wa not altogeth happi in my mind to begin with
i did not know how the twenti bearer would behav under fire thei
might be seiz with panic and rush about in which case i determin to
let them out of the boma to take their chanc for panic is a catch
thing
a wors matter wa our rather awkward posit there were a good mani
tree round the camp among which an attack forc could take cover
but what i fear much more than thi or even than the reedi bank of
the stream along which thei could creep out of reach of our bullet wa
a slope stretch of land behind us cover with thick grass and scrub
and rise to a crest about two hundr yard awai now if the arab got
round to thi crest thei would fire straight into our boma and make it
unten also if the wind were in their favour thei might burn us out
or attack under the cloud of smoke as a matter of fact by the special
merci of provid none of these thing happen for a reason which i
will explain present
in the case of a night or rather a dawn attack i have alwai found
that hour befor the sky begin to lighten veri try inde as a rule
everyth that can be done is done so that on must sit idl also
it is then that both the physic and the moral qualiti ar at their
lowest ebb as is the mercuri in the thermomet the night is dy
the dai is not yet born all natur feel the influenc of that hour
then bad dream come then infant wake and call then memori of
those who ar lost to us aris then the hesit soul often take it
plung into the depth of the unknown it is not wonder therefor
that on thi occas the wheel of time drave heavili for me i knew
that the morn wa at hand by mani sign the sleep bearer turn
and mutter in their sleep a distant lion ceas it roar and
depart to it own place an alertmind cock crew somewher and our
donkei rose and began to pull at their tetherrop as yet howev
it wa quit dark han crept up to me i saw hi wrinkl yellow face
in the light of the watchfir
i smell the dawn he said and vanish again
mavovo appear hi massiv frame silhouet against the black
watcherbynight the night is done he said if thei come at all
the enemi should soon be here
salut he too pass awai into the dark and present i heard the
sound of spearblad strike togeth and of rifl be cock
i went to stephen and woke him he sat up yawn mutter someth
about greenhous then rememb said
ar those arab come we ar in for a fight at last jolli old
fellow isnt it
you ar a jolli old fool i answer inconsequ and march off
in a rage
my mind wa uneasi about thi inexperienc young man if anyth
should happen to him what should i sai to hi father well in that
event it wa probabl that someth would happen to me too veri
possibl we should both be dead in an hour certainli i had no intent
of allow myself to be taken aliv by those slave devil hassan
remark about fire and antheap and the sun were too vividli impress
upon my memori
in anoth five minut everybodi wa up though it requir kick to
rous most of the bearer from their slumber thei poor men were
accustom to the presenc of death and did not suffer him to disturb
their sleep still i note that thei mutter togeth and seem
alarm
if thei show sign of treacheri you must kill them i said to mavovo
who nod in hi grave silent fashion
onli we left the rescu slavewoman and her child plung in the stupor
of exhaust in a corner of the camp what wa the us of disturb
her
sammi who seem far from comfort brought two pannikin of coffe
to stephen and myself
thi is a moment occas messr quatermain and somer he said
as he gave us the coffe and i note that hi hand shook and hi teeth
chatter the cold is extrem he went on in hi copybook english by
wai of explain these physic symptom which he saw i had observ
mr quatermain it is all veri well for you to paw the ground and smell
the battl from afar as is written in the book of job but i wa not
brought up to the trade and take it otherwis inde i wish i wa back
at the cape ye even within the whitewash wall of the place of
detent
so do i i mutter keep my right foot on the ground with
difficulti
but stephen laugh outright and ask
what will you do sammi when the fight begin
mr somer he answer i have emploi some wake hour in make
a hole behind that treetrunk through which i hope bullet will not
pass there be a man of peac i shall prai for our success
and if the arab get in sammi
then sir under heaven i shall trust to the fleet of my leg
i could stand it no longer my right foot flew up and caught sammi in
the place at which i had aim he vanish cast a reproach look
behind him
just then a terribl clamour aros in the slaver camp which hitherto
had been veri silent and just then also the first light of dawn glint
on the barrel of our gun
look out i cri as i gulp down the last of my coffe there
someth go on there
the clamour grew louder and louder till it seem to fill the ski with
a concentr nois of curs and shriek distinct from it as it
were i heard shout of alarm and rage and then came the sound of
gunshot yell of agoni and the thud of mani run feet by now
the light wa grow fast as it doe when onc it come in these
latitud three more minut and through the grei mist of the dawn
we saw dozen of black figur struggl up the slope toward us some
seem to have log of wood ti behind them other crawl along on
all four other drag children by the hand and all yell at the
top of their voic
the slave ar attack us said stephen lift hi rifl
dont shoot i cri i think thei have broken loos and ar take
refug with us
i wa right these unfortun had us the two knive which our men
smuggl to them to good purpos have cut their bond dure the
night thei were run to seek the protect of the englishmen and
their flag on thei surg a hideou mob the slavestick still fast
to the neck of mani of them for thei had not found time or opportun
to loos them all while behind came the arab fire the posit
wa clearli veri seriou for if thei burst into our camp we should
be overwhelm by their rush and fall victim to the bullet of their
captor
han i cri take the men who were with you last night and try
to lead those slave round behind us quick quick now befor we ar
stamp flat
han dart awai and present i saw him and the two other men run
toward the approach crowd han wave a shirt or some other white
object to attract their attent at the time the foremost of them had
halt and were scream merci english save us english have
caught sight of the muzzl of our gun
thi wa a fortun occurr inde for otherwis han and hi
companion could never have stop them the next thing i saw wa the
white shirt bear awai to the left on a line which led past the fenc
of our boma into the scrub and high grass behind the camp after it
struggl and scrambl the crowd of slave like a flock of sheep after
the bellweth to them hanss shirt wa a kind of white helmet of
navarr
so that danger pass by some of the slave had been struck by the arab
bullet or trodden down in the rush or collaps from weak and at
those of them who still live the pursuer were fire on woman who
had fallen under the weight of the great slavestick which wa fasten
about her throat wa crawl forward on her hand and knee an arab
fire at her and the bullet struck the ground under her stomach but
without hurt her for she wriggl forward more quickli i wa sure
that he would shoot again and watch present for by now the light
wa good i saw him a tall fellow in a white robe step from behind the
shelter of a bananatre about a hundr and fifti yard awai and take
a care aim at the woman but i too took aim andwel i am not bad
at thi kind of snapshoot when i try that arab gun never went
off onli he went up two feet or more into the air and fell backward
shot through the head which wa the part of hi person that i had
cover
the hunter utter a low ow of approv while stephen in a sort
of ecstasi exclaim
oh what a heavenli shot
not bad but i shouldnt have fire it i answer for thei havent
attack us yet it is a kind of declar of war and i ad as
stephen sunhelmet leapt from hi head there the answer down all
of you and fire through the loophol
then the fight began except for it grand final it wasnt realli
much of a fight when compar with on or two we had afterward on thi
expedit but on the other hand it charact wa extrem awkward
for us the arab made on rush at the begin shout on allah as
thei came but though thei were plucki villain thei did not repeat that
experi either by good luck or good manag stephen knock
over two of them with hi doublebarrel rifl and i also empti
my largebor breechloaderth first i ever ownedamong them not
without result while the hunter made a hit or two
after thi the arab took cover get behind tree and as i had
fear hide in the reed on the bank of the stream thenc thei
harass us a great deal for amongst them were some veri decent shot
inde had we not taken the precaut of line the thorn fenc with a
thick bank of earth and sod we should have fare badli as it wa on
of the hunter wa kill the bullet pass through the loophol
and strike him in the throat as he wa about to fire while the
unfortun bearer who were on rather higher ground suffer a good
deal two of them be dispatch outright and four wound after thi
i made the rest of them lie flat on the ground close against the fenc
in such a fashion that we could fire over their bodi
soon it becam evid that there were more of these arab than we had
thought for quit fifti of them were fire from differ place
moreov by slow degre thei were advanc with the evid object
of outflank us and gain the high ground behind some of them of
cours we stop as thei rush from cover to cover but thi kind of
shoot wa as difficult as that at bolt rabbit across a woodland
ride and to be honest i must sai that i alon wa much good at the
game for here my quick ey and long practic told
within an hour the posit had grown veri seriou inde so much so
that we found it necessari to consid what should be done i point
out that with our small number a charg against the scatter riflemen
who were gradual surround us would be wors than useless while
it wa almost hopeless to expect to hold the boma till nightfal
onc the arab got behind us thei could rake us from the higher ground
inde for the last halfhour we had direct all our effort to
prevent them from pass thi boma which fortun the stream
on the on side and a stretch of quit open land on the other made it
veri difficult for them to do without more loss than thei care to face
i fear there is onli on thing for it i said at length dure
a paus in the attack while the arab were either take counsel or
wait for more ammunit to abandon the camp and everyth and
bolt up the hill as those fellow must be tire and we ar all good
runner we mai save our live in that wai
how about the wound ask stephen and the slavewoman and child
i dont know i answer look down
of cours i did know veri well but here in an acut form aros the
ancient question were we to perish for the sake of certain individu
in whom we had no great interest and whom we could not save by remain
with them if we stai where we were our end seem fairli certain
wherea if we ran for it we had a good chanc of escap but thi
involv the desert of sever injur bearer and a woman and
child whom we had pick up starv all of whom would certainli be
massacr save perhap the woman and child
as these reflect flit through my brain i rememb that a
drunken frenchman name leblanc whom i had known in my youth and who
had been a friend of napoleon or so he said told me that the great
emperor when he wa besieg acr in the holi land wa forc to
retreat be unabl to carri off hi wound men he left them in
a monasteri on mount carmel each with a dose of poison by hi side
appar thei did not take the poison for accord to leblanc who
said he wa present there not as a wound man the turk came and
butcher them so napoleon chose to save hi own life and that of hi
armi at the expens of hi wound but after all i reflect he
wa no shine exampl to christian men and i hadnt time to find ani
poison in a few word i explain the situat to mavovo leav out
the stori of napoleon and ask hi advic
we must run he answer although i do not like run life is
more than store and he who live mai on dai pai hi debt
but the wound mavovo we cannot carri them
i will see to them macumazana it is the fortun of war or if thei
prefer it we can leav themto be nurs by the arab which of
cours wa just napoleon and hi poison over again
i confess that i wa about to assent not wish that i and stephen
especi stephen should be pot in an obscur engag with some
miser slavetrad when someth happen
it will be rememb that shortli after dawn han us a shirt for a
flag had led the fugit slave past the camp up to the hill behind
there he and thei had vanish and from that moment to thi we had seen
noth of him or them now of a sudden he reappear still wave the
shirt after him rush a great mob of nake men two hundr of them
perhap brandish slavestick stone and the bough of tree when
thei had almost reach the boma whenc we watch them amaz thei
split into two bodi half of them pass to our left appar
under the command of the mazitu who had accompani han to the
slavecamp and the other half to the right follow the old hottentot
himself i stare at mavovo for i wa too thunderstruck to speak
ah said mavovo that spot snake of your he refer to han
is great in hi own wai for he ha even been abl to put courag into
the heart of slave do you not understand my father that thei ar
about to attack those arab ye and to pull them down as wild dog do
a buffalo calf
it wa true thi wa the hottentot superb design moreov it
succeed up on the hillsid he had watch the progress of the fight
and seen how it must end then through the interpret who wa with
him he harangu those slave point out to them that we their
white friend were about to be overwhelm and that thei must either
strike for themselv or return to the yoke among them were some who
had been warrior in their own tribe and through these he stir the
other thei seiz the slavestick from which thei had been freed
piec of rock anyth that came to their hand and at a given signal
charg leav onli the women and children behind them
see them come the scatter arab began to fire at them kill
some but therebi reveal their own hidingplac at these the slave
rush thei hurl themselv upon the arab thei tore them thei
dash out their brain in such fashion that within anoth five minut
quit twothird of them were dead and the rest of whom we took some
toll with our rifl as thei bolt from cover were in full flight
it wa a terribl vengeanc never did i wit a more savag scene
than that of these outrag men wreak their wrong upon their
tormentor i rememb that when most of the arab had been kill and
a few were escap the slave found on i think it wa the captain of
the gang who had hidden himself in a littl patch of dead reed wash
up by the stream somehow thei manag to fire these i expect that
han who had remain discreetli in the background after the fight
began emerg when it wa over and gave them a match in due cours out
came the wretch arab then thei flung themselv on him as march
ant do upon a caterpillar and despit hi cri for merci tore him to
fragment liter to fragment be what thei were it wa hard
to blame them if we had seen our parent shot our infant pitilessli
butcher our home destroi and our women and children march off
in the slavestick to be sold into bondag should we not have done the
same i think so although we ar not ignor savag
thu our live were save by those whom we had tri to save and for
onc justic wa done even in those dark part of africa for in that
time thei were dark inde had it not been for han and the courag
which he manag to inspir into the heart of these crush black i
have littl doubt but that befor nightfal we should have been dead
for i do not think that ani attempt at retreat would have prove
success and if it had what would have happen to us in that wild
countri surround by enemi and with onli the few round of ammunit
that we could have carri in our flight
ah baa said the hottentot a littl while later squint at me
with hi beadlik ey after all you did well to listen to my prayer
and bring me with you old han is a drunkard ye or at least he us
to be and old han gambl ye and perhap old han will go to hell
but meanwhil old han can think as he thought on dai befor the
attack on maraisfontein as he thought on dai on the hill of slaughter
by dingaan kraal and as he thought thi morn up there among the
bush oh he knew how it must end he saw that those dog of arab
were cut down a tree to make a bridg across that deep stream and
get round to the high ground at the back of you whenc thei would
have shot you all in five minut and now baa my stomach feel veri
queer there wa no breakfast on the hillsid and the sun wa veri
hot i think that just on tot of brandyoh i know i promis not to
drink but if you give it me the sin is your not mine
well i gave him the tot a stiff on which he drank quit neat
although it wa against my principl and lock up the bottl
afterward also i shook the old fellow hand and thank him which
seem to pleas him veri much for he mutter someth to the effect
that it wa noth sinc if i had di he would have di too and
therefor he wa think of himself not of me also two big tear
trickl down hi snub nose but these mai have been produc by the
brandi
well we were the victor and elat as mai be imagin for we knew
that the few slaver who had escap would not attack us again our
first thought wa for food for it wa now past middai and we were
starv but dinner presuppos a cook which remind us of sammi
stephen who wa in such a state of jubil that he danc rather
than walk the helmet with a bullethol through it stuck ludicr
upon the back of hi head start to look for him and present call
to me in an alarm voic i went to the back of the camp and stare
into a hole like a small grave that had been hollow behind a solitari
thorn tree at the bottom of which lai a huddl heap i found him it
wa sammi to all appear we got hold of him and up he came limp
senseless but still hold in hi hand a larg thick bibl bound in
board moreov in the exact centr of thi bibl wa a bullethol
or rather a bullet which had pass through the stout cover and buri
itself in the paper behind i rememb that the point of it reach to
the first book of samuel
as for sammi himself he seem to be quit uninjur and inde after
we had pour some water on himh wa never fond of waterh reviv
quickli enough then we found out what had happen
gentlemen he said i wa seat in my place of refug be as i
have told you a man of peac enjoi the consol of religionh
wa veri piou in time of troubl at length the fire slacken and
i ventur to peep out think that perhap the foe had fled hold
the book in front of my face in case of accid after that i rememb
no more
no said stephen for the bullet hit the bibl and the bibl hit your
head and knock you silli
ah said sammi how true is what i wa taught that the book shall be
a shield of defenc to the righteou now i understand why i wa move
to bring the thick old bibl that belong to my mother in heaven
and not the littl thin on given to me by the sundai school teacher
through which the ball of the enemi would have pass
then he went off to cook the dinner
certainli it wa a wonder escap though whether thi wa a direct
reward of hi pieti as he thought is anoth matter
as soon as we had eaten we set to work to consid our posit of
which the crux wa what to do with the slave there thei sat in group
outsid the fenc mani of them show trace of the recent conflict
and stare at us stupidli then of a sudden as though with on voic
thei began to clamour for food
how ar we to feed sever hundr peopl ask stephen
the slaver must have done it somehow i answer let go and
search their camp
so we went follow by our hungri client and in addit to mani
more thing to our delight found a great store of rice meali and
other grain some of which wa ground into meal of thi we serv out
an ampl suppli togeth with salt and soon the cook pot were full
of porridg my word how those poor creatur did eat nor although
it wa necessari to be care could we find it in our heart to stint
them of the first full meal that had pass their lip after week
of starvat when at length thei were satisfi we address them
thank them for their braveri tell them that thei were free and
ask what thei meant to do
upon thi point thei seem to have but on idea thei said that thei
would come with us who were their protector then follow a great
indaba or consult which realli i have not time to set out
the end of it wa that we agre that so mani of them as wish should
accompani us till thei reach countri that thei knew when thei would
be at liberti to depart to their own home meanwhil we divid up the
blanket and other store of the arab such as trade good and bead
among them and then left them to their own devic after place a
guard over the foodstuff for my part i hope devoutli that in the
morn we should find them gone
after thi we return to our boma just in time to assist at a sad
ceremoni that of the burial of my hunter who had been shot through the
head hi companion had dug a deep hole outsid the fenc and within
a few yard of where he fell in thi thei place him in a sit
posit with hi face turn toward zululand set by hi side two
gourd that belong to him on fill with water and the other with
grain also thei gave him a blanket and hi two assegai tear the
blanket and break the handl of the spear to kill them as thei
said then quietli enough thei threw in the earth about him and fill
the top of the hole with larg stone to prevent the hyena from dig
him up thi done on by on thei walk past the grave each man
stop to bid him farewel by name mavovo who came last made a
littl speech tell the deceas to namba kachl that is go
comfort to the land of ghost as he ad no doubt he would do
who had di as a man should he request him moreov if he return
as a spirit to bring good and not illfortun on us sinc otherwis
when he mavovo becam a spirit in hi turn he would have word to sai
to him on the matter in conclus he remark that as hi mavovo
snake had foretold thi event at durban a fact with which the deceas
would now be acquaint he the said deceas could never complain of
not have receiv valu for the shill he had paid as a divin
fee
ye exclaim on of the hunter with a note of anxieti in hi voic
but your snake mention six of us to you o doctor
it did repli mavovo draw a pinch of snuff up hi uninjur
nostril and our brother there wa the first of the six be not afraid
the other five will certainli join him in due cours for my snake must
speak the truth still if anyon is in a hurri and he glare round
the littl circl let him stop and talk with me alon perhap i could
arrang that hi turn here he stop for thei were all gone
glad i didnt pai a shill to have my fortun told by mavovo said
stephen when we were back in the boma but why did thei buri hi
pot and spear with him
to be us by the spirit on it journei i answer although thei do
not quit know it these zulu believ like all the rest of the world
that man live on elsewher
chapter viii
the magic mirror
i did not sleep veri well that night for now that the danger wa over
i found that the long strain of it had told upon my nerv also there
were mani nois thu the bearer who were shot had been hand over
to their companion who dispos of them in a simpl fashion name by
throw them into the bush where thei attract the notic of hyena
then the four wound men who lai near to me groan a good deal or
when thei were not groan utter loud prayer to their local god
we had done the best we could for these unlucki fellow inde that
kindheart littl coward sammi who at some time in hi career serv
as a dresser in a hospit had tend their wound none of which were
mortal veri well inde and from time to time rose to minist to
them
but what disturb me most wa the fear hubbub which came from
the camp below mani of the tropic african tribe ar realli
seminocturn in their habit i suppos becaus there the night is
cooler than the dai and on ani great occas thi tendenc assert
itself
thu everi on of these freed slave seem to be howl hi loudest to
an accompani of clash iron pot or stone which lack their
nativ drum thei beat with stick
moreov thei had lit larg fire about which thei flit in an
omin and unpleas fashion that remind me of some mediaev
pictur of hell which i had seen in an old book
at last i could stand it no longer and kick han who curl up like
a dog slept at my feet ask him what wa go on hi answer caus
me to regret the question
plenti of those slave cannib men baa think thei eat the arab and
like them veri much he said with a yawn then went to sleep again
i did not continu the convers
when at length we made a start on the follow morn the sun wa high
over us inde there wa a great deal to do the gun and ammunit
of the dead arab had to be collect the ivori of which thei carri
a good store must be buri for to take it with us wa imposs and
the load apport also it wa necessari to make litter for the
wound and to stir up the slave from their debauch into the natur
of which i made no further inquiri wa no easi task on muster
them i found that a good number had vanish dure the night where
to i do not know still a mob of well over two hundr peopl a
consider portion of whom were women and children remain whose
on idea seem to be to accompani us wherev we might wander so with
thi miscellan follow at length we start
to my sorrow we never saw thi ivori againaq
to describ our adventur dure the next month would be too long if
not imposs for to tell the truth after the laps of so mani year
these have becom somewhat entangl in my mind our great difficulti
wa to feed such a multitud for the store of rice and grain upon
which we were quit unabl to keep a strict supervis thei soon
devour fortun the countri through which we pass at thi time
of the year the end of the wet season wa full of game of which
travel as we did veri slowli we were abl to shoot a great deal
but thi game kill delight as it mai be to the sportsman
soon pall on us as a busi to sai noth of the expenditur of
ammunit it meant incess work
against thi the zulu hunter soon began to murmur for as stephen and
i could rare leav the camp the burden of it fell on them ultim
i hit upon thi scheme pick out thirti or forti of the likeliest men
among the slave i serv out to each of them ammunit and on of the
arab gun in the us of which we drill them as best we could then
i told them that thei must provid themselv and their companion with
meat of cours accid happen on man wa accident shot and
three other were kill by a cow eleph and a wound buffalo but in
the end thei learn to handl their rifl suffici well to suppli
the camp moreov dai by dai littl parti of the slave disappear
i presum to seek their own home so that when at last we enter the
border of the mazitu countri there were not more than fifti of them
left includ seventeen of those whom we had taught to shoot
then it wa that our real adventur began
on even after three dai march through some difficult bush in
which lion carri off a slave woman kill on of the donkei and
maul anoth so badli that it had to be shot we found ourselv upon
the edg of a great grassi plateau that accord to my aneroid wa
1640 feet abov sea level
what place is thi i ask of the two mazitu guid those same men
whom we had borrow from hassan
the land of our peopl chief thei answer which is border on
on side by the bush and on the other by the great lake where live the
pongo wizard
i look about me at the bare upland that alreadi were begin to
turn brown on which noth wa visibl save vast herd of buck such as
were common further south a dreari prospect it wa for a slight rain
wa fall accompani by mist and a cold wind
i do not see your peopl or their kraal i said i onli see grass
and wild game
our peopl will come thei repli rather nervous no doubt even
now their spi watch us from among the tall grass or out of some hole
the deuc thei do i said or someth like it and thought no more
of the matter when on is in condit in which anyth mai happen
such as so far as i am concern have prevail through most of my
life on grow a littl careless as to what will happen for my part
i have long been a fatalist to a certain extent i mean i believ that
the individu or rather the ident which anim him came out from
the sourc of all life a long while perhap hundr of thousand or
million of year ago and when hi career is finish perhap hundr
of thousand or million of year henc or perhap tomorrow will
return perfect but still as an individu to dwell in or with that
sourc of life i believ also that hi variou exist here or
elsewher ar foreknown and foreordain although in a sens he mai
shape them by the action of hi free will and that noth which he can
do will lengthen or shorten on of them by a singl hour therefor so
far as i am concern i have alwai act up to the great injunct of
our master and taken no thought for the morrow
howev in thi instanc as in mani other of my experi the
morrow took plenti of thought for itself inde befor the dawn han
who never seem realli to sleep ani more than a dog doe woke me up
with the omin inform that he heard a sound which he thought wa
caus by the tramp of hundr of march men
where i ask after listen without availto look wa useless
for the night wa dark as pitch
he put hi ear to the ground and said
there
i put my ear to the ground but although my sens ar fairli acut
could hear noth
then i sent for the sentri but these too could hear noth after
thi i gave the busi up and went to sleep again
howev as it prove han wa quit right in such matter he
gener wa right for hi sens were as keen as those of ani wild
beast at dawn i wa onc more awaken thi time by mavovo who
report that we were be surround by a regiment or regiment i
rose and look out through the mist there sure enough in dim and
solemn outlin though still far off i perceiv rank upon rank of men
arm men for the light glimmer faintli upon their spear
what is to be done macumazana ask mavovo
have breakfast i think i answer if we ar go to be kill
it mai as well be after breakfast as befor and call the trembl
sammi i instruct him to make the coffe also i awok stephen and
explain the situat to him
capit he answer no doubt these ar the mazitu and we have
found them much more easili than we expect peopl gener take such
a lot of hunt for in thi confound great countri
that not such a bad wai of look at thing i answer but would
you be good enough to go round the camp and make it clear that not on
ani account is anyon to fire without order stai collect all the gun
from those slave for heaven know what thei will do with them if thei
ar frighten
stephen nod and saunter off with three or four of the hunter
while he wa gone in consult with mavovo i made certain littl
arrang of my own which need not be detail thei were design
to enabl us to sell our live as dearli as possibl should thing come
to the worst on should alwai try to make an impress upon the enemi
in africa for the sake of futur travel if for no other reason
in due cours stephen and the hunter return with the gun or most of
them and report that the slave peopl were in great state of terror
and show a disposit to bolt
let them bolt i answer thei would be of no us to us in a row
and might even complic matter call in the zulu who ar watch at
onc
he nod and a few minut later i heardfor the mist which hung
about the bush to the east of the camp wa still too dens to allow
of my see anythinga clamour of voic follow by the sound of
scuttl feet the slave peopl includ our bearer had gone everi
on of them thei even carri awai the wound just as the soldier
who surround us were complet their circl thei bolt between the
two end of it and vanish into the bush out of which we had march
on the previou even often sinc then i have wonder what becam
of them doubtless some perish and the rest work their wai back
to their home or found new on among other tribe the experi of
those who escap must be interest to them if thei still live i can
well imagin the legend in which these will be embodi two or three
gener henc
deduct the slave peopl and the bearer whom we had wrung out of
hassan we were now a parti of seventeen name eleven zulu hunter
includ mavovo two white men han and sammi and the two mazitu
who had elect to remain with us while round us wa a great circl of
savag which close in slowli
as the light grewit wa long in come on that dull morningand
the mist lift i examin these peopl without seem to take ani
particular notic of them thei were tall much taller than the averag
zulu and slighter in their build also lighter in colour like the
zulu thei carri larg hide shield and on veri broadblad spear
throw assegai seem to be want but in place of them i saw
that thei were arm with short bow which togeth with a quiver
of arrow were slung upon their back the offic wore a short
skin cloak or kaross and the men also had cloak which i found out
afterward were made from the inner bark of tree
thei advanc in the most perfect silenc and veri slowli nobodi said
anyth and if order were given thi must have been done by sign i
could not see that ani of them had firearm
now i said to stephen perhap if we shot and kill some of those
fellow thei might be frighten and run awai or thei might not or if
thei did thei might return
whatev happen he remark sage we should scarc be welcom
in their countri afterward so i think we had better do noth unless
we ar oblig
i nod for it wa obviou that we could not fight hundr of
men and told sammi who wa perfectli livid with fear to bring the
breakfast no wonder he wa afraid poor fellow for we were in great
danger these mazitu had a bad name and if thei chose to attack us we
should all be dead in a few minut
the coffe and some cold buck flesh were put upon our littl
camptabl in front of the tent which we had pitch becaus of the
rain and we began to eat the zulu hunter also at from a bowl of
meali porridg which thei had cook on the previou night each of
them with hi load rifl upon hi knee our proceed appear
to puzzl the mazitu veri much inde thei drew quit near to us to
within about forti yard and halt there in a dead circl stare at
us with their great round ey it wa like a scene in a dream i shall
never forget it
everyth about us appear to astonish them our indiffer the
colour of stephen and myself as a matter of fact at that date brother
john wa the onli white man thei had ever seen our tent and our two
remain donkei inde when on of these beast broke into a brai
thei show sign of fright look at each other and even retreat a
few pace
at length the posit got upon my nerv especi as i saw that
some of them were begin to fiddl with their bow and that their
gener a tall oneei old fellow wa make up hi mind to do
someth i call to on of the two mazitu whom i forgot to sai we
had name tom and jerri and gave him a pannikin of coffe
take that to the captain there with my good wish jerri and ask him
if he will drink with us i said
jerri who wa a plucki fellow obei advanc with the steam
coffe he held it under the captain nose evid he knew the man
name for i heard him sai

of the fold varieti stuck the irontip end of hi great spear in
the ground between hi knee and took hold of the pannikin or rather

coffe that in the confus of the moment sammi gave to old babemba

as to tell me the truth now or i shall read it in the magic shield
which portrai the insid as well as the out and lift the cloth i
stare at the glass
if you can read my thought white lord why troubl me to tell them
ask babemba sensibl enough hi mouth full of biscuit still as
that bright thing mai lie i will set them out bausi king of our
peopl ha sent me to kill you becaus new ha reach him that you
ar great slave dealer who come hither with gun to captur the mazitu
and take them awai to the black water to be sold and sent across it
in big cano that move of themselv of thi he ha been warn by
messeng from the arab men moreov we know that it is true for
last night you had with you mani slave who see our spear ran awai
not an hour ago
now i stare hard at the lookingglass and answer coolli
thi magic shield tell a somewhat differ stori it sai that your
king bausi for whom by the wai we have mani thing as present told
you to lead us to him with honour that we might talk over matter with
him
the shot wa a good on babemba grew confus
it is true he stammer thati mean the king left it to my
judgment i will consult the witchdoctor
if he left it to your judgment the matter is settl i said sinc
certainli be so great a nobl you would never try to murder those
of whose holi drink you have just partaken inde if you did so i
ad in a cold voic you would not live long yourself on secret
word and that drink will turn to mwavi of the worst sort insid of
you
oh ye white lord it is settl exclaim babemba it is settl
do not troubl the secret word i will lead you to the king and you
shall talk with him by my head and my father spirit you ar safe from
me still with your leav i will call the great doctor imbozwi
and ratifi the agreement in hi presenc and also show him the magic
shield
so imbozwi wa sent for jerri take the messag present he arriv
he wa a villainouslook person of uncertain ag humpback like
the pictur of punch wizen and squintei hi costum wa of
the ordinari witchdoctor type be set off with snake skin fish
bladder baboon teeth and littl bag of medicin to add to hi
charm a broad strip of pigment red ochr probabl ran down hi
forehead and the nose beneath across the lip and chin end in a red
mark the size of a penni where the throat join the chest hi woolli
hair also in which wa twist a small ring of black gum wa soak
with greas and powder blue it wa arrang in a kind of horn
come to a sharp point about five inch abov the top of the skull
altogeth he look extrem like the devil what wa more he wa a
devil in a bad temper for the first word he said embodi a reproach
to us for not have ask him to partak of our holi drink with
babemba
we offer to make him some more but he refus sai that we should
poison him
then babemba set the matter out rather nervous i thought for
evid he wa afraid of thi old wizard who listen in complet
silenc when babemba explain that without the king direct order it
would be foolish and unjustifi to put to death such magician as
we were imbozwi spoke for the first time ask why he call us
magician
babemba instanc the wonder of the shine shield that show
pictur
pooh said imbozwi doe not calm water or polish iron show
pictur
but thi shield will make fire said babemba the white lord sai it
can burn a man up
then let it burn me up repli imbozwi with ineff contempt and
i will believ that these white men ar magician worthi to be kept
aliv and not common slavetrad such as we have often heard of
burn him white lord and show him that i am right exclaim the
exasper babemba after which thei fell to wrangl evid thei
were rival and by thi time both of them had lost their temper
the sun wa now veri hot quit suffici so to enabl us to give
mr imbozwi a tast of our magic which i determin he should have
not be certain whether an ordinari mirror would realli reflect enough
heat to scorch i drew from my pocket a veri power burningglass
which i sometim us for the light of fire in order to save
match and hold the mirror in on hand and the burningglass in
the other i work myself into a suitabl posit for the experi
babemba and the witchdoctor were argu so fierc that neither
of them seem to notic what i wa do get the focu right
i direct the concentr spark straight on to imbozwi greas
topknot where i knew he would feel noth my plan be to char
a hole in it but as it happen thi topknot wa built up round
someth of a highli inflamm natur reed or camphorwood i
expect at ani rate about thirti second later the topknot wa burn
like a beauti torch
ow said the kaffir who were watch my aunt exclaim
stephen look look shout babemba in tone of delight now will
you believ o blownout bladder of a man that there ar greater
magician than yourself in the world
what is the matter son of a dog that you make a mock of me
screech the unfuri imbozwi who alon wa unawar of anyth
unusu
as he spoke some suspicion rose in hi mind which caus him to put hi
hand to hi topknot and withdraw it with a howl then he sprang up and
began to danc about which of cours onli fan the fire that had now
got hold of the greas and gum the zulu applaud babemba clap hi
hand stephen burst into on of hi idiot fit of laughter for my
part i grew frighten near at hand stood a larg wooden pot such as
the kaffir make from which the coffe kettl had been fill that
fortun wa still halfful of water i seiz it and ran to him
save me white lord he howl you ar the greatest of magician and
i am your slave
here i cut him short by clap the pot bottom upward on hi burn
head into which it vanish as a candl doe into an extinguish
smoke and a bad smell issu from beneath the pot the water from which
ran all over imbozwi who stood quit still when i wa sure the fire
wa out i lift the pot and reveal the discomfit wizard but
without hi elabor headdress beyond a littl scorch he wa not
in the least hurt for i had act in time onli he wa bald for when
touch the char hair fell off at the root
it is gone he said in an amaz voic after feel at hi scalp
ye i answer quit the magic shield work veri well did it
not
can you put it back again white lord he ask
that will depend upon how you behav i repli
then without anoth word he turn and walk back to the soldier
who receiv him with shout of laughter evid imbozwi wa not a
popular charact and hi discomfitur delight them
babemba also wa delight inde he could not prais our magic
enough and at onc began to make arrang to escort us to the king
at hi head town which wa call beza vow that we need fear no
harm at hi hand or those of hi soldier in fact the onli person who
did not appreci our black art wa imbozwi himself i caught a look
in hi ey as he march off which told me that he hate us bitterli
and reflect to myself that perhap i had been foolish to us that
burningglass although in truth i had not intend to set hi head on
fire
my father said mavovo to me afterward it would have been better to
let that snake burn to death for then you would have kill hi poison
i am someth of a doctor myself and i tell you there is noth our
brotherhood hate so much as be laugh at you have made a fool of
him befor all hi peopl and he will not forget it macumazana
chapter ix
bausi the king
about middai we made a start for beza town where king bausi live which
we understood we ought to reach on the follow even for some hour
the regiment march in front or rather round us but as we complain
to babemba of the nois and dust with a confid that wa quit
touch he sent it on ahead first howev he ask us to pass our
word by our mother which wa the most sacr of oath among mani
african peopl that we would not attempt to escap i confess that i
hesit befor give an answer not be entir enamour of the
mazitu and of our prospect among them especi as i had discov
through jerri that the discomfit imbozwi had depart from the
soldier on some busi of hi own had the matter been left to me
inde i should have tri to slip back into the bush over the border
and there put in a few month shoot dure the dry season while
work my wai southward thi too wa the wish of the zulu hunter
of han and i need not add of sammi but when i mention the matter to
stephen he implor me to abandon the idea
look here quatermain he said i have come to thi godforsaken
countri to get that great cypripedium and get it i will or die in the
attempt still he ad after survei our rather blank face i
have no right to plai with your live so if you think the thing
too danger i will go on alon with thi old boi babemba put
everyth els asid i think that on of us ought to visit bausi
kraal in case the gentleman who you call brother john should turn up
there in short i have made up my mind so it is no us talk
i lit my pipe and for quit a time contempl thi obstin young
man while consid the matter from everi point of view final i
came to the conclus that he wa right and i wa wrong it wa true
that by bribe babemba or otherwis there wa still an excel
prospect of effect a masterli retreat and of avoid mani peril on
the other hand we had not come to thi wild place in order to retreat
further at whose expens had we come here at that of stephen somer
who wish to proce lastli to sai noth of the chanc of meet
brother john to whom i felt no oblig sinc he had given us the
slip at durban i did not like the idea of be beaten we had start
out to visit some mysteri savag who worship a monkei and a
flower and we might as well go on till circumst were too much for
us after all danger ar everywher those who turn back becaus of
danger will never succe in ani life that we can imagin
mavovo i said present point to stephen with my pipe the
inkoosi wazela doe not wish to try to escap he wish to go on
to the countri of the pongo peopl if we can get there and mavovo
rememb that he ha paid for everyth we ar hi hire servant
also that he sai that if we run back he will walk forward alon with
these mazitu still if ani of you hunter desir to slip off he will
not look your wai nor shall i what sai you
i sai macumazana that though young wazela is a chief with a great
heart and that where you and he go i shall go also as i think will
the rest of us i do not like these mazitu for if their father were
zulu their mother were low peopl thei ar bastard and of the pongo
i hear noth but what is evil still no good ox ever turn in the
yoke becaus of a mudhol let us go on for if we sink in the swamp
what doe it matter moreov my snake tell me that we shall not sink
at least not all of us
so it wa arrang that no effort should be made to return sammi it is
true wish to do so but when it came to the point and he wa offer
on of the remain donkei and as much food and ammunit as he could
carri he chang hi mind
i think it better mr quatermain he said to meet my end in the
compani of highborn lofti soul than to pursu a lone career toward
the inevit in unknown circumst
veri well put sammi i answer so while wait for the
inevit pleas go and cook the dinner
have laid asid our doubt we proceed on the journei comfort
enough be well provid with bearer to take the place of those who
had run awai babemba accompani by a singl orderli travel with
us and from him we collect much inform it seem that the
mazitu were a larg peopl who could muster from five to seven thousand
spear their tradit wa that thei came from the south and were of
the same stock as the zulu of whom thei had heard vagu inde
mani of their custom to sai noth of their languag resembl
those of that countri their militari organis howev wa not
so thorough and in other wai thei struck me as a lower race in on
particular it is true that of their hous thei were more advanc
for these as we saw in the mani kraal that we pass were better
built with doorwai through which on could walk upright instead of
the kaffir beehol
we slept in on of these hous on our march and should have found
it veri comfort had it not been for the innumer flea which at
length drove us out into the courtyard for the rest these mazitu much
resembl the zulu thei had kraal and were breeder of cattl thei
were rule by headmen under the command of a suprem chief or king thei
believ in witchcraft and offer sacrific to the spirit of their
ancestor also in some kind of a vagu and mighti god who domin the
affair of the world and declar hi will through the doctor lastli
thei were and i dare sai still ar a race of fight men who love
war and raid the neighbour peopl upon ani and everi pretext
kill their men and steal their women and cattl thei had their
virtu too be kindli and hospit by natur though cruel enough
to their enemi moreov thei detest deal in slave and those
who practis it sai that it wa better to kill a man than to
depriv him of hi freedom also thei had a horror of the cannib
which is so common in the dark region of africa and for thi reason
more than ani other loath the pongo folk who were suppos to be
eater of men
on the even of the second dai of our march dure which we had
pass through a beauti and fertil upland countri veri well
water and except in the vallei free from bush we arriv at beza
thi town wa situat on a wide plain surround by low hill and
encircl by a belt of cultiv land made beauti by the crop
of maiz and other cereal which were then ripe to harvest it wa
fortifi in a wai that is a tall unclimb palisad of timber
surround the entir town which fenc wa strengthen by prickli
pear and cacti plant on it either side
within thi palisad the town wa divid into quarter more or
less devot to variou trade thu on part of it wa call the
ironsmith quarter anoth the soldier quarter anoth the quarter
of the landtil anoth that of the skindress and so on the
king dwell and those of hi women and depend were near the
north gate and in front of these surround by semicircl of hut
wa a wide space into which cattl could be driven if necessari thi
howev at the time of our visit wa us as a market and a drill
ground
we enter the town that must in all have contain a great number of
inhabit by the south gate a strong log structur face a wood
slope through which ran a road just as the sun wa set we march
to the guesthut up a central street line with the popul of the
place who had gather to stare at us these hut were situat in the
soldier quarter not far from the king hous and surround by an
inner fenc to keep them privat
none of the peopl spoke as we pass them for the mazitu ar polit by
natur also it seem to me that thei regard us with aw temper
by curios thei onli stare and occasion those of them who were
soldier salut us by lift their spear the hut into which we were
introduc by babemba with whom we had grown veri friendli were good
and clean
here all our belong includ the gun which we had collect just
befor the slave ran awai were place in on of the hut over which
a mazitu mount guard the donkei be ti to the fenc at a littl
distanc outsid thi fenc stood anoth arm mazitu also on guard
ar we prison here i ask of babemba
the king watch over hi guest he answer enigmat have
the white lord ani messag for the king whom i am summon to see thi
night
ye i answer tell the king that we ar the brethren of him who
more than a year ago cut a swell from hi bodi whom we have arrang
to meet here i mean the white lord with a long beard who among you
black peopl is call dogeetah
babemba start you ar the brethren of dogeetah how come it then
that you never mention hi name befor and when is he go to meet
you here know that dogeetah is a great man among us for with him alon
of all men the king ha made bloodbrotherhood as the king is so is
dogeetah among the mazitu
we never mention him becaus we do not talk about everyth at onc
babemba as to when dogeetah will meet us i am not sure i am onli sure
that he is come
ye lord macumazana but when when that is what the king will want
to know and that is what you must tell him lord he ad drop
hi voic you ar in danger here where you have mani enemi sinc it
is not law for white men to enter thi land if you would save your
live be advis by me and be readi to tell the king tomorrow when
dogeetah whom he love will appear here to vouch for you and see that
he doe appear veri soon and by the dai you name sinc otherwis when
he come if come he doe he mai not find you abl to talk to him now
i your friend have spoken and the rest is with you
then without anoth word he rose slip through the door of the hut
and out by the gatewai of the fenc from which the sentri move asid
to let him pass i too rose from the stool on which i sat and danc
about the hut in a perfect furi
do you understand what that infern i am afraid i us a stronger
word old fool told me i exclaim to stephen he sai that we must
be prepar to state exactli when that other infern old fool brother
john will turn up at beza town and that if we dont we shall have our
throat cut as inde ha alreadi been arrang
rather awkward repli stephen there ar no express train to beza
and if there were we couldnt be sure that brother john would take on
of them i suppos there is a brother john he ad reflect
to me he seem to beintim connect with mr harri
oh there is or there wa i explain why couldnt the confound
ass wait quietli for us at durban instead of fool off butterfli
hunt to the north of zululand and break hi leg or hi neck there
if he ha done anyth of the sort
dont know i am sure it hard enough to understand on own
motiv let alon brother john
then we sat down on our stool again and stare at each other at thi
moment han crept into the hut and squat down in front of us he
might have walk in as there wa a doorwai but he prefer to creep
on hi hand and knee i dont know why
what is it you ugli littl toad i ask vicious for that wa just
what he look like even the skin under hi jaw move like a toad
the baa is in troubl remark han
i should think he wa i answer and so will you be present when
you ar wriggl on the point of a mazitu spear
thei ar broad spear that would make a big hole remark han
again whereupon i rose to kick him out for hi idea were as usual
unpleas
baa he went on i have been listeningther is a veri good hole in
thi hut for listen if on li against the wall and pretend to
be asleep i have heard all and understood most of your talk with that
oneei savag and the baa stephen
well you littl sneak what of it
onli baa that if we do not want to be kill in thi place from
which there is no escap it is necessari that you should find out
exactli on what dai and at what hour dogeetah is go to arriv
look here you yellow idiot i exclaim if you ar begin
that game too ill then i stop reflect that my temper wa
get the better of me and that i had better hear what han had to sai
befor i vent it on him
baa mavovo is a great doctor it is said that hi snake is the
straightest and the strongest in all zululand save that of hi master
zikali the old slave he told you that dogeetah wa laid up somewher
with a hurt leg and that he wa come to meet you here no doubt
therefor he can tell you also when he is come i would ask him but
he wont set hi snake to work for me so you must ask him baa and
perhap he will forget that you laugh at hi magic and that he swore
you would never see it again
oh blind on i answer how do i know that mavovo stori about
dogeetah wa not all nonsens
han stare at me amaz
mavovo stori nonsens mavovo snake a liar oh baa that is what
come of be too much a christian now thank to your father the
predik i am a christian too but not so much that i have forgotten
how to know good magic from bad mavovo snake a liar and after he
whom we buri yonder wa the first of the hunter whom the feather
name to him at durban and he began to chuckl in intens amus
then ad well baa there it is you must either ask mavovo and
veri nice or we shall all be kill i dont mind much for i
should rather like to begin again a littl younger somewher els but
just think what a nois sammi will make and turn he crept out as he
had crept in
here a nice posit i groan to stephen when he had gone i
a white man who in spite of some coincid with which i am
acquaint know that all thi kaffir magic is bosh am to beg a savag
to tell me someth of which he must be ignor that is unless we
educ peopl have got hold of the wrong end of the stick altogeth
it is humili it isnt christian and im hang if ill do it
i dare sai you will behang i meanwheth you do it or whether you
dont repli stephen with hi sweet smile but i sai old fellow
how do you know it is all bosh we ar told about lot of miracl which
werent bosh and if miracl ever exist why cant thei exist now
but there i know what you mean and it is no us argu still if
your proud i aint ill try to soften the stoni heart of mavovow
ar rather pal you knowand get him to unrol the book of hi occult
wisdom and he went
a few minut later i wa call out to receiv a sheep which with
milk nativ beer some corn and other thing includ green forag
for the donkei bausi had sent for us to eat here i mai remark that
while we were among the mazitu we live like fight cock there wa
none of that starvat which is or wa so common in east africa where
the travel often cannot get food for love or moneygener becaus
there is none
when thi busi wa settl by my send a messag of thank to the
king with an intim that we hope to wait upon him on the morrow
with a few present i went to seek sammi in order to tell him to kill
and cook the sheep after some search i found or rather heard him
beyond a reed fenc which divid two of the hut he wa act as
interpret between stephen somer and mavovo
thi zulu man declar mr somer he said that he quit
understand everyth you have been explain and that it is probabl
that we shall all be butcher by thi savag bausi if we cannot tell
him when the white man dogeetah whom he love will arriv here he
sai also that he think that by hi magic he could learn when thi will
happenif it is to happen at allwhich of cours mr somer for
your privat inform onli is a mighti lie of the ignor heathen
he add howev that he doe not care on brass farthinghi actual
express mr somer is on grain of corn on a mealiecobabout
hi or anybodi els life which from all i have heard of hi
proceed i can well believ to be true he sai in hi vulgar
languag that there is no differ between the belli of a mazituland
hyena and that of ani other hyena and that the earth of mazituland
is as welcom to hi bone as ani other earth sinc the earth is the
wickedest of all hyena in that he ha observ that soon or late it
devour everlastingli everyth which onc it bore you must forgiv me
for reproduc hi empti and childish talk mr somer but you bade me
to render the word of thi savag with exactitud in fact mr somer

is not acquaintedh call it the strength that make the sun to
shine and broider the blanket of the night with star forgiv me for
repeat hi silli word caus him to be born into thi world and
at an hour alreadi appoint will draw him from thi world back into
it dark etern bosom there to be rock in sleep or nurs to life
again accord to it unknown willi translat exactli mr somer
although i do not know what it all meansand that he doe not care a
curs when thi happen still he sai that wherea he is grow old
and ha known mani sorrowsh allud here i gather to some nigger
wive of hi whom anoth savag knock on the head also to a child to
whom he appear to have been attachedy ar young with all your dai

child ye mr somer although i blush to repeat it thi black
fellow sai he look upon you as hi child he add inde that if the
opportun aris he will gladli give hi life to save your life
and that it cut hi heart in two to refus you anyth still he must
refus thi request of your that he will ask the creatur he call hi
snakewhat he mean by that i dont know mr somersto declar
when the white man name dogeetah will arriv in thi place for thi
reason that he told mr quatermain when he laugh at him about hi

that he will die rather than break hi word that all mr somer and
i dare sai you will thinkquit enough too
i understand repli stephen tell the chief mavovo i observ he
laid an emphasi on the word chief that i quit understand and
that i thank him veri much for explain thing to me so fulli then
ask him whether as the matter is so import there is no wai out of
thi troubl
sammi translat into zulu which he spoke perfectli as i note without
interpol or addit
onli on wai answer mavovo in the interv of take snuff it is
that macumazana himself shall ask me to do thi thing macumazana is my
old chief and friend and for hi sake i will forget what in the case
of other i should alwai rememb if he will come and ask me without
mockeri to exercis my skill on behalf of all of us i will try to
exercis it although i know veri well that he believ it to be but as
an idl littl whirlwind that stir the dust that rais the dust and
let it fall again without purpos or mean forget as the wise
white men forget that even the wind which blow the dust is the same
that breath in our nostril and that to it we also ar as is the
dust
now i the listen thought for a moment or two the word of thi
fight savag mavovo even those of them of which i had heard onli
the translat garbl and beslav by the mean comment of the
unutter sammi stir my imagin who wa i that i should dare
to judg of him and hi wild unknown gift who wa i that i should
mock at him and by my mockeri intim that i believ him to be a
fraud
step through the gatewai of the fenc i confront him
mavovo i said i have overheard your talk i am sorri if i laugh
at you in durban i do not understand what you call your magic it is
beyond me and mai be true or mai be fals still i shall be grate to

next morn earli we unpack our box and made a handsom select
of gift for the king bausi hope thu to soften hi royal heart
it includ a bale of calico sever knive a music box a cheap
american revolv and a bundl of toothpick also sever pound
of the best and most fashion bead for hi wive thi truli nobl
present we sent to the king by our two mazitu servant tom and jerri
who were march off in the charg of sever sentri for i hope
that these men would talk to their compatriot and tell them what good
fellow we were inde i instruct them to do so
imagin our horror therefor when about an hour later just as we were
tidi ourselv up after breakfast there appear through the gate
not tom and jerri for thei had vanish but a long line of mazitu
soldier each of whom carri on of the articl that we had sent
inde the last of them held the bundl of toothpick on hi fuzzi head
as though it were a huge faggot of wood on by on thei set them down
upon the lime floor of the verandah of the largest hut then their
captain said solemnli
bausi the great black on ha no need of the white men gift
inde i repli for my dander wa up then he wont get anoth
chanc at them
the men turn awai without more word and present babemba turn up
with a compani of about fifti soldier
the king is wait to see you white lord he said in a voic of
veri forc jolliti and i have come to conduct you to him
why would he not accept our present i ask point to the row of
them
oh that is becaus of imbozwi stori of the magic shield he said he
want no gift to burn hi hair off but come come he will explain
for himself if the eleph is kept wait he grow angri and
trumpet
doe he i said and how mani of us ar to come
all all white lord he wish to see everi on of you
not me i suppos said sammi who wa stand close by i must stop
to make readi the food

the holi drink
well there wa no wai out of it so off we march all well arm as i
need not sai and were instantli surround by the soldier to give an
unusu note to the proceed i made han walk first carri on hi
head the reject music box from which flow the touch melodi of
home sweet home then came stephen bear the union jack on a pole
then i in the midst of the hunter and accompani by babemba then the
reluct sammi and last of all the two donkei led by mazitu for it
seem that the king had especi order that these should be brought
also
it wa a truli strike cavalcad the sight of which under ani other
circumst would have made me laugh nor did it fail in it effect
for even the silent mazitu peopl through whom we wend our wai were
move to someth like enthusiasm home sweet home thei evid
thought heavenli though perhap the two donkei attract them most
especi when these brai
where ar tom and jerri i ask of babemba
i dont know he answer i think thei have been given leav to go
to see their friend
imbozwi is suppress evid in our favour i thought to myself and
said no more
present we reach the gate of the royal enclosur here to my dismai
the soldier insist on disarm us take awai our rifl our
revolv and even our sheath knive in vain did i remonstr sai
that we were not accustom to part with these weapon the answer wa
that it wa not law for ani man to appear befor the king arm even
with so much as a dancingstick mavovo and the zulu show sign of
resist and for a minut i thought there wa go to be a row which
of cours would have end in our massacr for although the mazitu
fear gun veri much what could we have done against hundr of
them i order him to give wai but for onc he wa on the point of
disobei me then by a happi thought i remind him that accord to
hi snake dogeetah wa come and that therefor all would be well so
he submit with an ill grace and we saw our preciou gun born off
we knew not where
then the mazitu soldier pile their spear and bow at the gate of the
kraal and we proceed with onli the union jack and the music box
which wa now discours britannia rule the wave

a number of silent councillor at some signal or on reach a given
spot all the soldier includ old babemba fell upon their hand and
knee and began to crawl thei want us to do the same but here i drew
the line feel that if onc we crawl we must alwai crawl

not much matter what i said dogeetah will arriv here on the second
dai from now within half an hour after sunset
someth i know not what prompt me to allow that extra halfhour
which in the event save all our live now bausi consult a while
with the execr imbozwi and also with the old oneei gener
babemba while we watch know that our fate hung upon the issu
at length he spoke
white men he said imbozwi the head of the witchfind here
whose hair you burnt off by your evil magic sai that it would be
better to kill you at onc as your heart ar bad and you ar plan
mischief against my peopl so i think also but babemba my gener
with whom i am angri becaus he did not obei my order and put you
to death on the border of my countri when he met you there with your
caravan of slave think otherwis he prai me to hold my hand first
becaus you have bewitch him into like you and secondli becaus if

dogeetah would be pain if he arriv and found you dead nor could
even he bring you to life again thi be so sinc it matter littl
whether you die now or later my command is that you be kept prison
till sunset of the second dai from thi and that then you will be
led out and ti to stake in the marketplac there to wait till

he arriv and own you as hi brethren well and good if he doe not
arriv or disown youbett still for then you shall be shot to
death with arrow as a warn to all other stealer of men not to cross
the border of the mazitu
i listen to thi atroci sentenc with horror then gasp out
we ar not stealer of men o king we ar freer of men as tom and
jerri of your own peopl could tell you
who ar tom and jerri he ask indiffer well it doe not
matter for doubtless thei ar liar like the rest of you i have
spoken take them awai feed them well and keep them safe till within an
hour of sunset on the second dai from thi
then without give us ani further opportun of speak bausi rose
and follow by imbozwi and hi councillor march off into hi big
hut we too were march off thi time under a doubl guard command
by someon whom i had not seen befor at the gate of the kraal we
halt and ask for the arm that had been taken from us no answer wa
given onli the soldier put their hand upon our shoulder and thrust
us along
thi is a nice busi i whisper to stephen
oh it doesnt matter he answer there ar lot more gun in the
hut i am told that these mazitu ar dreadfulli afraid of bullet so
all we have to do is just to break out and shoot our wai through them
for of cours thei will run when we begin to fire
i look at him but did not answer for to tell the truth i felt in no
mood for argument
present we arriv at our quarter where the soldier left us to
camp outsid full of hi warlik plan stephen went at onc to the hut
in which the slaver gun had been store with our own spare rifl and
all the ammunit i saw him emerg look veri blank inde and ask
him what wa the matter
matter he answer in a voic that for onc realli wa full of
dismai the matter is that those mazitu have stolen all the gun
and all the ammunit there not enough powder left to make a blue
devil
well i repli with the kind of joke on perpetr under such
circumst we shall have plenti of blue devil without make ani
more
truli our wa a dread situat let the reader imagin it within
a littl more than fortyeight hour we were to be shot to death with
arrow if an errat old gentleman who for aught i knew might be
dead did not turn up at what wa then on of the remotest and most
inaccess spot in central africa moreov our onli hope that such
a thing would happen if hope it could be call wa the propheci of a
kaffir witchdoctor
to reli on thi in ani wai wa so absurd that i gave up think of
it and set my mind to consid if there were ani possibl mean of
escap after hour of reflect i could find none even han with
all hi experi and nearli superhuman cun could suggest none
we were unarm and surround by thousand of savag all of whom
save perhap babemba believ us to be slavetrad a race that veri
properli thei held in abhorr who had visit the countri with the
object of steal their women and children the king bausi a veri
prejud fellow wa dead against us also by a piec of foolish
which i now bitterli regret as inde i regret the whole
expedit or at ani rate enter on it in the absenc of brother
john we had made an implac enemi of the head medicineman who to
these folk wa a sort of archbishop of canterburi short of a miracl
there wa no hope for us all that we could do wa to sai our prayer
and prepar for the end
mavovo it is true remain cheer hi faith in hi snake wa
realli touch he offer to go through that divin process again
in our presenc and demonstr that there wa no mistak i declin
becaus i had no faith in divin and stephen also declin for
anoth reason name that the result might prove to be differ
which he held would be depress the other zulu oscil between
belief and sceptic as do the unstabl who set to work to studi the
evid of christian but sammi did not oscil he liter
howl and prepar the food which pour in upon us so badli that i
had to turn on han to do the cook for howev littl appetit we
might have it wa necessari that we should keep up our strength by
eat
what mr quatermain ask sammi between hi tear is the us of
dress viand that our system will never have time to thoroughli
assimil
the first night pass somehow and so did the next dai and the next
night which herald our last morn i got up quit earli and watch
the sunris never i think had i realis befor what a beauti
thing the sunris is at least not to the extent i did now when i wa
sai goodby to it for ever unless inde there should prove to be
still loveli sunris beyond the dark of death then i went into
our hut and as stephen who had the nerv of a rhinocero wa still
sleep like a tortois in winter i said my prayer earnestli enough
mourn over my sin which prove to be so mani that at last i gave up
the job in despair and then tri to occupi myself by read the old
testament a book to which i have alwai been extrem attach
as a passag that i lit on describ how the prophet samuel for whom i
could not help read imbozwi hew agag in piec after bausii
mean saulhad relent and spare hi life i cannot sai that it
consol me veri much doubtless i reflect these peopl believ that
i like agag had made women childless by my sword so there remain
noth save to follow the exampl of that unhappi king and walk
delic to doom
then as stephen wa still sleepinghow could he do it i wonderedi
set to work to make up the account of the expedit to date it had
alreadi cost 1423 just fanci expend 1423 in order to be ti to
a post and shot to death with arrow and all to get a rare orchid oh
i reflect to myself if by some marvel i should escap or if i should
live again in ani land where these particular flower flourish i would
never even look at them and as a matter of fact i never have
at length stephen did wake up and as crimin ar report to do in
the paper befor execut made an excel breakfast
what the good of worri he said present i shouldnt if it
werent for my poor old father it must have come to thi on dai and
the sooner it is over the sooner to sleep as the song sai when on
come to think of it there ar enorm advantag in sleep for that
the onli time on is quit happi still i should have like to see that
cypripedium first
oh drat the cypripedium i exclaim and blunder from the hut to
tell sammi that if he didnt stop hi groan i would punch hi head
jump regular jump whod have thought it of quatermain i heard
stephen mutter in the interv of light hi pipe
the morn went like lightn that is greas as sammi remark
three oclock came and mavovo and hi follow sacrif a kid to
the spirit of their ancestor which as sammi remark again wa a
horribl heathen ceremoni much calcul to prejudic our caus with
power abov
when it wa over to my delight babemba appear he look so pleasant
that i jump to the conclus that he brought the best of new
with him perhap that the king had pardon us or perhapsbless
thoughtthat brother john had realli arriv befor hi time
but not a bit of it all he had to sai wa that he had caus inquiri
to be made along the rout that ran to the coast and that certainli
for a hundr mile there wa at present no sign of dogeetah so as the
black eleph wa grow more and more enrag under the stir
up of imbozwi it wa obviou that that even ceremoni must be
perform inde as it wa part of hi duti to superintend the
erect of the post to which we were to be ti and the dig of
our grave at their base he had just come to count us again to be sure
that he had not made ani mistak as to the number also if there were
ani articl that we would like buri with us would we be so kind as
to point them out and he would be sure to see to the matter it would be
soon over and not pain he ad as he had select the veri best
archer in beza town who rare miss and could most of them send an
arrow up to the feather into a buffalo
then he chat a littl about other matter as to where he should
find the magic shield i had given him which he would alwai valu as a
souvenir etc took a pinch of snuff with mavovo and depart sai
that he would be sure to return again at the proper time
it wa now four oclock and as sammi wa quit beyond it stephen made
himself some tea it wa veri good tea especi as we had milk to put
in it although i did not rememb what it tast like till afterward
now have abandon hope i went into a hut alon to compos myself
to meet my end like a gentleman and seat there in silenc and
semidark my spirit grew much calmer after all i reflect why
should i cling to life in the countri whither i travel as the
reader who ha follow my adventur will know were some whom i
clearli long to see again notabl my father and my mother and two
nobl women who were even more to me my boi it is true remain he
wa aliv then but i knew that he would find friend and as i wa not
so badli off at that time i had been abl to make a proper provis
for him perhap it wa better that i should go see that if i live
on it would onli mean more troubl and more part
what wa about to befal me of cours i could not tell but i knew then
as i know now that it wa not extinct or even that sleep of which
stephen had spoken perhap i wa pass to some place where at length
the cloud would roll awai and i should understand whenc too i
should see all the landscap of the past and futur as an eagl doe
watch from the ski and be no longer like on struggl through
dens bush wildbeast and serpent haunt beat upon by the storm of
heaven and terrifi with it lightn nor know whither i hew
my path perhap in that place there would be no longer what st paul
describ as anoth law in my member war against the law of my
mind and bring me into captiv to the law of sin perhap there
the past would be forgiven by the power which know whereof we ar made
and i should becom what i have alwai long to begood in everi sens
and even find open to me new and better road of servic i take these
thought from a note that i made in my pocketbook at the time
thu i reflect and then wrote a few line of farewel in the fond
and foolish hope that somehow thei might find those to whom thei were
address i have those letter still and veri oddli thei read todai
thi done i tri to throw out my mind toward brother john if he still
live as inde i had done for dai past so that i might inform him of
our plight and i am afraid reproach him for have brought us to such
an end by hi insan careless or want of faith
whilst i wa still engag thu babemba arriv with hi soldier to
lead us off to execut it wa han who came to tell me that he wa
there the poor old hottentot shook me by the hand and wipe hi ey
with hi rag coatsleev
oh baa thi is our last journei he said and you ar go to
be kill baa and it is all my fault baa becaus i ought to have
found a wai out of the troubl which is what i wa hire to do but
i cant my head grow so stupid oh if onli i could come even with
imbozwi i shouldnt mind and i will i will if i have to return as a
ghost to do it well baa you know the predik your father told
us that we dont go out like a fire but burn again for alwai
elsewher
i hope not i thought to myself
and that quit easili without anyth to pai for the wood so i hope
that we shall alwai burn togeth baa and meanwhil i have brought
you a littl someth and he produc what look like a peculiarli
obnoxi horsebal you swallow thi now and you will never feel
anyth it is a veri good medicin that my grandfath grandfath
got from the spirit of hi tribe you will just go to sleep as nice
as though you were veri drunk and wake up in the beauti fire which
burn without ani wood and never goe out for ever and ever amen
no han i said i prefer to die with my ey open
and so would i baa if i thought there wa ani good in keep them
open but i dont for i cant believ ani more in the snake of that
black fool mavovo if it had been a good snake it would have told him
to keep clear of beza town so i will swallow on of these pill and
give the other to the baa stephen and he cram the filthi mess into
hi mouth and with an effort got it down as a young turkei doe a ball
of meal that is too big for it throat
then as i heard stephen call me i left him invok a most
comprehens and polyglot curs upon the head of imbozwi to whom he
rightli attribut all our woe
our friend here sai it is time to start said stephen rather
shakili for the situat seem to have got a hold of him at last
and nod toward old babemba who stood there with a cheer smile
look as though he were go to conduct us to a wed
ye white lord said babemba it is time and i have hurri so as
not to keep you wait it will be a veri fine show for the black
eleph himself is go to do you the honour to be present as will
all the peopl of beza town and those for mani mile round
hold your tongu you old idiot i said and stop your grin if
you had been a man and not a fals friend you would have got us out of
thi troubl know as you do veri well that we ar no seller of men
but rather the enemi of those who do such thing
oh white lord said babemba in a chang voic believ me i onli
smile to make you happi up to the end my lip smile but i am cry
insid i know that you ar good and have told bausi so but he will
not believ me who think that i have been bribe by you what can i
do against that evilheart imbozwi the head of the witchdoctor who
hate you becaus he think you have better magic than he ha and who
whisper dai and night into the king ear tell him that if he doe
not kill you all our peopl will be slain or sold for slave as
you ar onli the scout or a big armi that is come onli last night
imbozwi held a great divin indaba and read thi and a great
deal more in the enchant water make the king think he saw it in
pictur wherea i look over hi shoulder could see noth at
all except the ugli face of imbozwi reflect in the water also he
swore that hi spirit told me that dogeetah the king bloodbroth
be dead would never come to beza town again i have done my best
keep your heart white toward me o macumazana and do not haunt me
for i tell you i have done my best and if ever i should get a chanc
against imbozwi which i am afraid i shant as he will poison me first
i will pai him back oh he shall not die quickli as you will
i wish i could get a chanc at him i mutter for even in thi
solemn moment i could cultiv no christian spirit toward imbozwi
feel that he wa honest after all i shook old babemba hand and
gave him the letter i had written ask him to try and get them to
the coast then we start on our last walk
the zulu hunter were alreadi outsid the fenc seat on the ground
chat and take snuff i wonder if thi wa becaus thei realli
believ in mavovo confound snake or from bravado inspir by the
innat courag of their race when thei saw me thei sprang to their
feet and lift their right hand gave me a loud and hearti salut
of inkoosi baba inkoosi macumazana then at a signal from mavovo
thei broke into some zulu warchant which thei kept up till we reach
the stake sammi too broke into a chant but on of quit a differ
natur
be quiet i said to him cant you die like a man
no inde i cannot mr quatermain he answer and went on howl
for piti in about twenti differ languag
stephen and i walk togeth he still carri the union jack of
which no on tri to depriv him i think the mazitu believ it wa
hi fetish we didnt talk much though onc he said
well the love of orchid ha brought mani a man to a bad end i wonder
whether the governor will keep my collect or sell it
after thi he relaps into silenc and not know and inde not
care what would happen to hi collect i made no answer
we had not far to go person i could have prefer a longer walk
pass with our guard down a kind of bystreet we emerg suddenli at
the head of the marketplac to find that it wa pack with thousand
of peopl gather there to see our execut i notic that thei were
arrang in orderli compani and that a broad open roadwai wa left
between them run to the southern gate of the market i suppos to
facilit the movement of so larg a crowd
all thi multitud receiv us in respect silenc though sammi
howl caus some of them to smile while the zulu warchant appear to
excit their wonder or admir at the head of the marketplac not
far from the king enclosur fifteen stout post had been plant on
as mani mound these mound were provid so that everyon might see
the show and in part at ani rate were made of soil hollow from
fifteen deep grave dug almost at the foot of the mound or rather
there were seventeen post an extra larg on be set at each end of
the line in order to accommod the two donkei which it appear were
also to be shot to death a great number of soldier kept a space
clear in front of the post on thi space were gather bausi hi
councillor some of hi head wive imbozwi more hideous paint than
usual and perhap fifti or sixti pick archer with strung bow and an
ampl suppli of arrow whose part in the ceremoni it wa not difficult
for us to guess
king bausi i said as i wa led past that potent you ar a
murder and heaven abov will be aveng upon you for thi crime if
our blood is shed soon you shall die and come to meet us where we
have power and your peopl shall be destroi
my word seem to frighten the man for he answer
i am no murder i kill you becaus you ar robber of men moreov
it is not i who have pass sentenc on you it is imbozwi here the
chief of the doctor who ha told me all about you and whose spirit
sai you must die unless my brother dogeetah appear to save you if
dogeetah come which he cannot do becaus he is dead and vouch for
you then i shall know that imbozwi is a wick liar and as you were to
die so he shall die
ye ye screech imbozwi if dogeetah come as that fals wizard
prophesi and he point to mavovo then i shall be readi to die in
your place white slavedeal ye ye then you mai shoot me with
arrow
king take note of those word and peopl take note of those word
that thei mai be fulfil if dogeetah come said mavovo in a great
deep voic
i take note of them answer bausi and i swear by my mother on
behalf of all the peopl that thei shall be fulfilledif dogeetah

good exclaim mavovo and stalk on to the stake which had been
point out to him
as he went he whisper someth into imbozwi ear that seem to
frighten that limb of satan for i saw him start and shiver howev he
soon recov for in anoth minut he wa engag in superintend
those whose busi it wa to lash us to the post
thi wa done simpli and effect by ty our wrist with a grass
rope behind these post each of which wa fit with two project
piec of wood that pass under our arm and practic prevent
us from move stephen and i were given the place of honour in the
middl the union jack be fix by hi own request to the top of
stephen stake mavovo wa on my right and the other zulu were rang
on either side of us han and sammi occupi the end post respect
except those to which the poor jackass were bound i note that han
wa alreadi veri sleepi and that shortli after he wa fix up hi head
drop forward on hi breast evid hi medicin wa work and
almost i regret that i had not taken some while i had the chanc
when we were all fasten imbozwi came round to inspect moreov with
a piec of white chalk he made a round mark on the breast of each of us
a kind of bull ey for the archer to aim at
ah white man he said to me as he chalk awai at my shoot coat
you will never burn anyon hair again with your magic shield never
never for present i shall be tread down the earth upon you in that
hole and your good will belong to me
i did not answer for what wa the us of talk to thi vile brute
when my time wa so short so he pass on to stephen and began to chalk
him stephen howev in whom the natur man still prevail shout
take your filthi hand off me and lift hi leg which wa
unfett gave the paint witchdoctor such an aw kick in the
stomach that he vanish backward into the grave beneath him
ow well done wazela said the zulu we hope that you have kill
him
i hope so too said stephen and the multitud of spectat gasp to
see the sacr person of the head witchdoctor of whom thei evid
went in much fear treat in such a wai onli babemba grin and even
the king bausi did not seem displeas
but imbozwi wa not to be dispos of so easili for present with the
help of sundri myrmidon minor witchdoctor he scrambl out of the
grave curs and cover with mud for it wa wet down there after
that i took no more heed of him or of much els see that i had onli
half an hour to live as mai be imagin i wa otherwis engag
chapter xi
the come of dogeetah
the sunset that dai wa like the sunris particularli fine although
as in the case of the tea i rememb littl of it till afterward
in fact thunder wa about which alwai produc grand cloud effect in
africa
the sun went down like a great red ey over which there drop
suddenli a black eyelid of cloud with a fring of purpl lash
there the last i shall see of you my old friend thought i to myself
unless i catch you up present
the gloom began to gather the king look about him also at the sky
overhead as though he fear rain then whisper someth to babemba
who nod and stroll up to my post
white lord he said the eleph wish to know if you ar readi as
present the light will be veri bad for shoot
no i answer with decis not till half an hour after sundown as
wa agre
babemba went to the king and return to me
white lord the king sai that a bargain is a bargain and he will keep
to hi word onli you must not then blame him if the shoot is bad
sinc of cours he did not know that the night would be so cloudi which
is not usual at thi time of year
it grew darker and darker till at length we might have been lost in a
london fog the dens mass of the peopl look like bank and the
archer flit to and fro as thei made readi might have been shadow
in hade onc or twice lightn flash and wa follow after a paus
by the distant growl of thunder the air too grew veri oppress
dens silenc reign in all those multitud no on spoke or stir
even sammi ceas hi howl i suppos becaus he had becom exhaust
and faint awai as peopl often do just befor thei ar hang it wa
a most solemn time natur seem to be adapt herself to the mood of
sacrific and make readi for us a mighti pall
at length i heard the sound of arrow be drawn from their quiver
and then the squeaki voic of imbozwi sai
wait a littl the cloud will lift there is light behind it and it
will be nicer if thei can see the arrow come
the cloud did begin to lift veri slowli and from beneath it flow a
green light like that in a cat ey
shall we shoot imbozwi ask the voic of the captain of the
archer
not yet not yet not till the peopl can watch them die
the edg of cloud lift a littl more the green light turn to a
fieri red thrown by the sunk sun and reflect back upon the earth from
the dens black cloud abov it wa as though all the landscap had
burst into flame while the heaven over us remain of the hue of ink
again the lightn flash show the face and stare ey of the
thousand who watch and even the white teeth of a great bat that
flitter past that flash seem to burn off an edg of the lower
cloud and the light grew stronger and stronger and redder and redder
imbozwi utter a hiss like a snake i heard a bowstr twang and
almost at the same moment the thud of an arrow strike my post just
abov my head inde by lift myself i could touch it i shut my
ey and began to see all sort of queer thing that i had forgotten
for year and year my brain swam and seem to melt into a kind of
confus through the intens silenc i thought i heard the sound of
some anim run heavili much as a fat bull eland doe when it is
suddenli disturb someon utter a startl exclam which caus
me to open my ey again the first thing i saw wa the squad of savag
archer lift their bowsevid that first arrow had been a kind
of trial shot the next look absolut unearthli in that terribl
and omin light wa a tall figur seat on a white ox shambl
rapidli toward us along the open roadwai that ran from the southern
gate of the marketplac
of cours i knew that i dream for thi figur exactli resembl
brother john there wa hi long snowi beard there in hi hand wa hi

a moment paus dure which i heard arrow fall to the ground
then from all those thousand of throat a roar that shape itself to
the word
dogeetah dogeetah is come to save the white lord
i must confess that after thi my nerv which is gener pretti good
gave out to such an extent that i think i faint for a few minut
dure that faint i seem to be carri on a convers with mavovo
though whether it ever took place or i onli imagin it i am not sure
sinc i alwai forgot to ask him
he said or i thought he said to me
and now macumazana my father what have you to sai doe my snake
stand upon it tail or doe it not answer i am listen
to which i repli or seem to repli
mavovo my child certainli it appear as though your snake doe
stand upon it tail still i hold that all thi is a phantasi that
we live in a land of dream in which noth is real except those thing
which we cannot see or touch or hear that there is no me and no you
and no snake at all noth but a power in which we move that show us
pictur and laugh when we think them real
whereon mavovo said or seem to sai
ah at last you touch the truth o macumazana my father all thing
ar a shadow and we ar shadow in a shadow but what throw the shadow
o macumazana my father why doe dogeetah appear to come hither ride
on a white ox and why do all these thousand think that my snake stand
so veri stiff upon it tail
im hang if i know i repli and woke up
there without doubt wa old brother john with a wreath of flowersi
note in disgust that thei were orchidshang in a bacchanalian
fashion from hi dint sunhelmet over hi left ey he wa in a
furiou rage and revil bausi who liter crouch befor him and
i wa in a furiou rage and revil him what i said i do not rememb
but he said hi white beard bristl with indign while he
threaten bausi with the handl of the butterfli net
you dog you savag whom i save from death and call brother what
were you do to these white men who ar in truth my brother and to
their follow were you about to kill them oh if so i will forget
my vow i will forget the bond that bind us and
dont prai dont said bausi it is all a horribl mistak i am
not to be blame at all it is that witchdoctor imbozwi whom by the
ancient law of the land i must obei in such matter he consult hi
spirit and declar that you were dead also that these white lord
were the most wick of men slavetrad with spot heart who came
hither to spy out the mazitu peopl and to destroi them with magic and
bullet
then he li thunder brother john and he knew that he li
ye ye it is evid that he li answer bausi bring him here
and with him those who serv him
now by the light of the moon which wa shine brightli in the heaven
for the thundercloud had depart with the last glow of sunset
soldier began an activ search for imbozwi and hi confeder of
these thei caught eight or ten all wickedlook fellow hideous
paint and adorn like their master but imbozwi himself thei could
not find
i began to think that in the confus he had given us the slip when
present from the far end of the line for we were still all ti to
our stake i heard the voic of sammi hoars it is true but quit
cheer now sai
mr quatermain in the interest of justic will you inform hi
majesti that the treacher wizard for whom he is seek is now
peep and mutter at the bottom of the grave which wa dug to
receiv my mortal remain
i did inform hi majesti and in doublequick time our friend imbozwi
wa onc more fish out of a grave by the strong arm of babemba and
hi soldier and drag into the presenc of the irat bausi
loos the white lord and their follow said bausi and let them
come here
so our bond were undon and we walk to where the king and brother
john stood the miser imbozwi and hi attend doctor huddl in a
heap befor them
who is thi said bausi to him point at brother john is it not
he whom you vow wa dead
imbozwi did not seem to think that the question requir an answer so
bausi continu
what wa the song that you sang in our ear just nowthat if dogeetah
came you would be readi to be shot to death with arrow in the place of
these white lord whose live you swore awai wa it not
again imbozwi made no answer although babemba call hi attent to
the king queri with a vigor kick then bausi shout
by your own mouth ar you condemn o liar and that shall be done
to you which you have yourself decre ad almost in the word of
elijah after he had triumph over the priest of baal take awai these
fals prophet let none of them escap sai you not so o peopl
ay roar the multitud fierc take them awai
not a popular charact imbozwi stephen remark to me in a
reflect voic well he is go to be serv hot on hi own toast
now and serv the brute right
who is the fals doctor now mock mavovo in the silenc
that follow who is about to sup on arrowhead o
painterofwhitespot and he point to the mark that imbozwi had
so gleefulli chalk over hi heart as a guid to the arrow of the
archer
now see that all wa lost the littl humpback villain with a
sudden twist caught me by the leg and began to plead for merci so
piteous did he plead that be alreadi soften by the fact of our
wonder escap from those black grave my heart wa melt in me i
turn to ask the king to spare hi life though with littl hope that
the prayer would be grant for i saw that bausi fear and hate the
man and wa onli too glad of the opportun to be rid of him imbozwi
howev interpret my movement differ sinc among savag the
turn of the back alwai mean that a petit is refus then in
hi rage and despair the venom of hi wick heart boil over he
leapt to hi feet and draw a big carv knife from among hi
witchdoctor trap sprang at me like a wild cat shout
at least you shall come too white dog
most mercifulli mavovo wa watch him for that is a good zulu sai
which declar that wizard is wizard fate with on bound he wa on
him just as the knife touch meit actual prick my skin
though without draw blood which wa fortun as probabl it wa
poisonedh grip imbozwi arm in hi grasp of iron and hurl him
to the ground as though he were but a child
after thi of cours all wa over
come awai i said to stephen and brother john thi is no place for
us
so we went and gain our hut without molest and inde quit
unobserv for the attent of everyon in beza town wa fulli
occupi elsewher from the marketplac behind us rose so hideou a
clamour that we rush into my hut and shut the door to escap or lessen
the sound it wa dark in the hut for which i wa realli thank for
the dark seem to sooth my nerv especi wa thi so when
brother john said
friend allan quatermain and you young gentleman whose name i dont
know i will tell you what i think i never mention to you befor
that in addit to be a doctor i am a clergyman of the american
episcopalian church well as a clergyman i will ask your leav to
return thank for your veri remark deliver from a cruel death
by all mean i mutter for both of us and he did so in a most
earnest and beauti prayer brother john mai or mai not have been
a littl touch in the head at thi time of hi life but he wa
certainli an abl and a good man
afterward as the shriek and shout had now di down to a confus
murmur of mani voic we went and sat outsid under the project
eav of the hut where i introduc stephen somer to brother john
and now i said in the name of good where do you come from ti
up in flower like a roman priest at sacrific and ride on a bull
like the ladi call europa and what on earth do you mean by plai

after you had agre to guid us to thi hellish hole
brother john stroke hi long beard and look at me reproachfulli
i guess allan he said in hi american fashion there is a mistak
somewher to answer the last part of your question first i did not
leav you without a word i gave a letter to that lame old griqua
garden of your jack to be hand to you when you arriv
then the idiot either lost it and li to me as griqua will or he
forgot all about it

well in that letter i said that i would meet you here where i should
have been six week ago await you also i sent a messag to bausi to
warn him of your come in case i should be delai but i suppos that

subject is on of which i do not care to speak i knew that you were
go to journei by kilwa inde it wa your onli rout with a lot
of peopl and so much baggag and i did not wish to visit kilwa he

built a mission station and a church there and we were happi and fairli
success in our work then on on evil dai the swahili and other arab
came in dhow to establish a slaved station i resist them and
the end of it wa that thei attack us kill most of my peopl and
enslav the rest in that attack i receiv a cut from a sword on the
headlook here is the mark of it and draw hi white hair apart he
show us a long scar that wa plainli visibl in the moonlight
the blow knock me senseless just about sunset on even when
i came to myself again it wa broad daylight and everybodi wa gone
except on old woman who wa tend me she wa halfcraz with grief
becaus her husband and two son had been kill and anoth son a
boi and a daughter had been taken awai i ask her where my young wife
wa she answer that she too had been taken awai eight or ten hour
befor becaus the arab had seen the light of a ship out at sea and
thought thei might be those of a british manofwar that wa known to be
cruis on the coast on see these thei had fled inland in a hurri
leav me for dead but kill the wound befor thei went the old
woman herself had escap by hide among some rock on the seashor
and after the arab had gone had crept back to the hous and found me

i ask her where my wife had been taken she said she did not know
but some other of our peopl told her that thei had heard the arab
sai thei were go to some place a hundr mile inland to join their
leader a halfbr villain name hassanbenmoham to whom thei were
carri my wife as a present
now we knew thi wretch for after the arab land at kilwa but
befor actual hostil broke out between us he had fallen sick of
smallpox and my wife had help to nurs him had it not been for her
inde he would have di howev although the leader of the band
he wa not present at the attack be engag in some slaveraid
busi in the interior
when i learn thi terribl new the shock of it or the loss of
blood brought on a return of insens from which i onli awok
two dai later to find myself on board a dutch trade vessel that wa
sail for zanzibar it wa the light of thi ship that the arab had
seen and mistaken for those of an english manofwar she had put into

abl to help them out of the bottl of tear into the fire that burn
for ever and ever oh it is too much and i swear baa that howev
often i have to die henceforward it shall alwai be with my ey open

chapter xii
brother john stori
although i went to bed late i wa up befor sunris chiefli becaus i
wish to have some privat convers with brother john whom i knew
to be a veri earli riser inde he slept less than ani man i ever met
as i expect i found him astir in hi hut he wa engag in press
flower by candlelight
john i said i have brought you some properti which i think you
have lost and i hand him the moroccobound christian year and the
watercolour draw which we had found in the sack mission hous at
kilwa
he look first at the pictur and then at the book at least i suppos
he did for i went outsid the hut for a whileto observ the sunris
in a few minut he call me and when the door wa shut said in an
unsteadi voic
how did you come by these relic allan
i told him the stori from begin to end he listen without a word
and when i had finish said
i mai as well tell what perhap you have guess that the pictur is
that of my wife and the book is her book
is i exclaim
ye allan i sai is becaus i do not believ that she is dead i
cannot explain why ani more than i could explain last night how that
great zulu savag wa abl to prophesi my come but sometim we can
wring secret from the unknown and i believ that i have won thi truth
in answer to my prayer that my wife still live
after twenti year john
ye after twenti year why do you suppos he ask almost fierc
that for twothird of a gener i have wander about among african
savag pretend to be crazi becaus these wild peopl rever the mad
and alwai let them pass unharm
i thought it wa to collect butterfli and botan specimen
butterfli and botan specimen these were the pretext i have
been and am search for my wife you mai think it a folli especi
consid what wa her condit when we separatedsh wa expect
a child allanbut i do not i believ that she is hidden awai among
some of these wild peopl
then perhap it would be as well not to find her i answer
bethink me of the fate which had overtaken sundri white women in the
old dai who had escap from shipwreck on the coast and becom the
wive of kaffir
not so allan on that point i fear noth if god ha preserv my
wife he ha also protect her from everi harm and now he went on
you will understand why i wish to visit these pongoth pongo who
worship a white goddess
i understand i said and left him for have learn all there wa to
know i thought it best not to prolong a pain convers to me
it seem incred that thi ladi should still live and i fear
the effect upon him of the discoveri that she wa no more how full
of romanc is thi poor littl world of our think of brother john
everslei wa hi real name as i discov afterward and what hi
life had been a highmind educ man try to serv hi faith in
the dark place of the earth and take hi young wife with him
which for my part i have never consid a right thing to do neither
tradit nor holi writ record that the apostl drag their wive and
famili into the heathen land where thei went to preach although i
believ that some of them were marri but thi is by the wai
then fall the blow the mission hous is sack the husband escap by
a miracl and the poor young ladi is torn awai to be the prei of a vile
slavetrad lastli accord to the quit unreli evid of
some savag alreadi in the shadow of death she is seen in the charg of
other unknown savag on the strength of thi the husband plai the
part of a mad botanist hunt for her for a score of year endur
incred hardship and yet buoi up by a high and holi trust to my
mind it wa a beauti and pathet stori still for reason which i
have suggest i confess that i hope that long ago she had return
into the hand of the power which made her for what would be the state
of a young white ladi who for two decad had been at the merci of these
black brute
and yet and yet after my experi of mavovo and hi snake i did not
feel inclin to dogmatis about anyth who and what wa i that i
should ventur not onli to form opinion but to thrust them down the
throat of other after all how narrow ar the limit of the knowledg
upon which we base our judgment perhap the great sea of intuit
that surround us is safer to float on than ar these littl islet of
individu experi whereon we ar so wont to take our stand
meanwhil my duti wa not to specul on the dream and mental
attitud of other but like a practic hunter and trader to carri to
a success issu an expedit that i wa well paid to manag and to
dig up a certain rare flower root if i could find it in the market
valu of which i had an interest i have alwai pride myself upon my
entir lack of imagin and all such mental phantasi and upon an
aptitud for hard busi and an appreci of the fact of life
that after all ar the thing with which we have to do thi is the
truth at least i hope it is for if i were to be quit honest which
no on ever ha been except a gentleman name mr pepi who i think
live in the reign of charl ii and who to judg from hi memoir
which i have read late did not write for public i should have
to admit that there is anoth side to my natur i sternli suppress it
howev at ani rate for the present
while we were at breakfast han who still suffer from headach and
remors wa lurk outsid the gatewai far from the mad crowd
of critic crept in like a beaten dog and announc that babemba wa
approach follow by a number of laden soldier i wa about to
advanc to receiv him then i rememb that ow to a queer nativ
custom such as that which caus sir theophilu shepston whom i us
to know veri well to be recognis as the holder of the spirit of the
great chaka and therefor as the equal of the zulu monarch brother
john wa the realli import man in our compani so i gave wai and
ask him to be good enough to take my place and to live up to that
station in savag life to which it had pleas god to call him
i am bound to sai he rose to the occas veri well be by natur
and appear a dignifi old man swallow hi coffe in a hurri
he took hi place at a littl distanc from us and stood there in a
statuesqu pose to him enter babemba crawl on hi hand and knee
and other nativ gentlemen likewis crawl also the burden soldier
in as obsequi an attitud as their load would allow
o king dogeetah said babemba your brother king bausi return the
gun and firegood of the white men your children and send certain
gift
glad to hear it gener babemba said brother john although it
would be better if he had never taken them awai put them down and get
on to your feet i do not like to see men wriggl on their stomach
like monkei
the order wa obei and we check the gun and ammunit also
our revolv and the other articl that had been taken awai from us
noth wa miss or damag and in addit there were four fine
eleph tusk an offer to stephen and myself which as a
busi man i promptli accept some kaross and mazitu weapon
present to mavovo and the hunter a beauti nativ bedstead with
ivori leg and mat of finelywoven grass a gift to han in testimoni
to hi power of sleep under try circumst the zulu roar when
thei heard thi and han vanish curs behind the hut and for
sammi a weird music instrument with a request that in futur he would
us it in public instead of hi voic
sammi i mai add did not see the joke ani more than han had done but
the rest of us appreci the mazitu sens of humour veri much
it is veri well mr quatermain he said for these black babe and
suckl to sit in the seat of the scorn on such an occas silent
prayer would have been of littl us but i am certain that my loud
cry to heaven deliv you all from the bite of the heathen
arrow
o dogeetah and white lord said babemba the king invit your
presenc that he mai ask your forgiv for what ha happen
and thi time there will be no need for you to bring arm sinc
henceforward no hurt can come to you from the mazitu peopl
so present we set out onc more take with us the gift that had
been refus our march to the royal quarter wa a verit triumphal
progress the peopl prostrat themselv and clap their hand
slowli in salut as we pass while the girl and children pelt
us with flower as though we were bride go to be marri our road
ran by the place of execut where the stake at which i confess i
look with a shiver were still stand though the grave had been
fill in
on our arriv bausi and hi councillor rose and bow to us inde
the king did more for come forward he seiz brother john by the
hand and insist upon rub hi ugli black nose against that of thi
rever guest thi it appear wa the mazitu method of embrac
an honour which brother john did not seem at all to appreci then
follow long speech wash down with draught of thick nativ beer
bausi explain that hi evil proceed were entir due to the
wicked of the deceas imbozwi and hi discipl under whose
tyranni the land had groan for long sinc the peopl believ them to
speak with the voic of heaven abov
brother john on our behalf accept the apolog and then read a
lectur or rather preach a sermon that took exactli twentyf
minut to deliv he is rather long in the wind in which he
demonstr the evil of superstit and point to a higher and a
better path bausi repli that he would like to hear more of that path
anoth time which as he presum that we were go to spend the rest
of our live in hi compani could easili be foundsai dure the next
spring when the crop had been sown and the peopl had leisur on their
hand
after thi we present our gift which now were eagerli accept then
i took up my parabl and explain to bausi that so far from stop in
beza town for the rest of our live we were anxiou to press forward
at onc to pongoland the king face fell as did those of hi
councillor
listen o lord macumazana and all of you he said these pongo ar
horribl wizard a great and power peopl who live by themselv
amidst the swamp and mix with none if the pongo catch mazitu or folk
of ani other tribe either thei kill them or take them as prison to
their own land where thei enslav them or sometim sacrific them to
the devil thei worship
that is so broke in babemba for when i wa a lad i wa a slave
to the pongo and doom to be sacrif to the white devil it wa in
escap from them that i lost thi ey
needless to sai i made a note of thi remark though i did not think
the moment opportun to follow the matter up if babemba ha onc been
to pongoland i reflect to myself babemba can go again or show us
the wai there
and if we catch ani of the pongo went on bausi as sometim we do
when thei come to hunt for slave we kill them ever sinc the mazitu
have been in thi place there ha been hate and war between them and
the pongo and if i could wipe out those evil on then i should die
happili
that you will never do o king while the white devil live said
babemba have you not heard the pongo propheci that while the white
devil live and the holi flower bloom thei will live but when the
white devil di and the holi flower ceas to bloom then their women
will becom barren and their end will be upon them
well i suppos that thi white devil will die some dai i said
not so macumazana it will never die of itself like it wick
priest it ha been there from the begin and will alwai be there
unless it is kill but who is there that can kill the white devil
i thought to myself that i would not mind try but again i did not
pursu the point
my brother dogeetah and lord exclaim bausi it is not possibl
that you should visit these wizard except at the head of an armi
but how can i send an armi with you see that the mazitu ar a land
peopl and have no cano in which to cross the great lake and no tree
whereof to make them
we answer that we did not know but would think the matter over as we
had come from our own place for thi purpos and meant to carri it out
then the audienc came to an end and we return to our hut leav
dogeetah to convers with hi brother bausi on matter connect with
the latter health as i pass babemba i told him that i should like
to see him alon and he said that he would visit me that even after
supper the rest of the dai pass quietli for we had ask that peopl

have spoken i call mavovo and hand it to him sai

the word struck me but i did not care to ask their mean somehow i
want to hear no more of mavovo propheci
then we dine and for the rest of that afternoon slept for all of us
includ brother john need rest badli in the even babemba came
and we three white men saw him alon
tell us about the pongo and thi white devil thei worship i said
macumazana he answer fifti year have gone by sinc i wa in that
land and i see thing that happen to me there as through a mist i
went to fish amongst the reed when i wa a boi of twelv and tall
men robe in white came in a cano and seiz me thei led me to a town
where there were mani other such men and treat me veri well give
me sweet thing to eat till i grew fat and my skin shone then in the
even i wa taken awai and we march all night to the mouth of a
great cave in thi cave sat a horribl old man about whom danc robe
peopl perform the rite of the white devil
the old man told me that on the follow morn i wa to be cook
and eaten for which reason i had been made so fat there wa a cano at
the mouth of the cave beyond which lai water while all were asleep i
crept to the cano as i loos the rope on of the priest woke up and
ran at me but i hit him on the head with the paddl for though onli a
boi i wa bold and strong and he fell into the water he came up again
and grip the edg of the cano but i struck hi finger with the
paddl till he let go a great wind wa blow that night tear off
bough from the tree which grew upon the other shore of the water it
whirl the cano round and round and on of the bough struck me in the
ey i scarc felt it at the time but afterward the ey wither
or perhap it wa a spear or a knife that struck me in the ey i do
not know i paddl till i lost my sens and alwai that wind blew the
last thing that i rememb wa the sound of the cano be driven
by the gale through reed when i woke up again i found myself near a
shore to which i wade through the mud scare great crocodil but
thi must have been some dai later for now i wa quit thin i fell
down upon the shore and there some of our peopl found me and nurs me
till i recov that is all
and quit enough too i said now answer me how far wa the town
from the place where you were captur in mazituland
a whole dai journei in the cano macumazana i wa captur in the
morn earli and we reach the harbour in the even at a place where
mani cano were ti up perhap fifti of them some of which would
hold forti men
and how far wa the town from thi harbour
quit close macumazana
now brother john ask a question
did you hear anyth about the land beyond the water by the cave
ye dogeetah i heard then or afterwardsfor from time to time
rumour reach us concern these pongothat it is an island where
grow the holi flower of which you know for when last you were here
you had on of it bloom i heard too that thi holi flower wa
tend by a priestess name mother of the flower and her servant all
of whom were virgin
who wa the priestess
i do not know but i heav heard that she wa on of those peopl
who although their parent ar black ar born white and that if ani
femal among the pongo ar born white or with pink ey or deaf and
dumb thei ar set apart to be the servant of the priestess but thi
priestess must now be dead see that when i wa a boi she wa alreadi
old veri veri old and the pongo were much concern becaus there wa
no on of white skin who could be appoint to succe her inde she
is dead sinc mani year ago there wa a great feast in pongoland
and number of slave were eaten becaus the priest had found
a beauti new princess who wa white with yellow hair and had
fingernail of the right shape
now i bethought me that thi find of the priestess name mother
of the flower who must be distinguish by certain person
peculiar resembl not a littl that of the find of the api
bullgod which also must have certain prescrib and holi mark
by the old egyptian as narrat by herodotu howev i said noth
about it at the time becaus brother john ask sharpli
and is thi priestess also dead
i do not know dogeetah but i think not if she were dead i think that
we should have heard some rumour of the feast of the eat of the dead
mother
eat the dead mother i exclaim
ye macumazana it is the law among the pongo that for a certain
sacr reason the bodi of the mother of the flower when she di must
be partaken of by those who ar privileg to the holi food
but the white devil neither di nor is eaten i said
no as i have told you he never di it is he who caus other to
die as if you go to pongoland doubtless you will find out babemba
ad grimli
upon my word thought i to myself as the meet broke up becaus
babemba had noth more to sai if i had my wai i would leav
pongoland and it white devil alon then i rememb how brother john
stood in refer to thi matter and with a sigh resign myself to
fate as it prove it i mean fate wa quit equal to the occas the
veri next morn earli babemba turn up again
lord lord he said a wonder thing ha happen last night we
spoke of the pongo and now behold an embassi from the pongo is here it
arriv at sunris
what for i ask
to propos peac between their peopl and the mazitu ye thei ask
that bausi should send envoi to their town to arrang a last peac
as if anyon would go he ad
perhap some might dare to i answer for an idea occur to me
but let us go to see bausi
half an hour later we were seat in the king enclosur that is
stephen and i were for brother john wa alreadi in the royal hut
talk to bausi as we went a few word had pass between us
ha it occur to you john i ask that if you realli wish to
visit pongoland here is perhap what you would call a providenti
opportun certainli none of these mazitu will go sinc thei fear
lest thei should find a perman peaceinsid of the pongo well you
ar a bloodbroth to bausi and can offer to plai the part of envoi
extraordinari with us as the member of your staff
i have alreadi thought of it allan he repli stroke hi long
beard
we sat down among a few of the lead councillor and present bausi
came out of hi hut accompani by brother john and have greet us
order the pongo envoi to be admit thei were led in at onc tall
lightcolour men with regular and semit featur who were cloth
in white linen like arab and wore circl of gold or copper upon their
neck and wrist
in short thei were impos person quit differ from ordinari
central african nativ though there wa someth about their
appear which chill and repel me i should add that their spear
had been left outsid and that thei salut the king by fold their
arm upon their breast and bow in a dignifi fashion
who ar you ask bausi and what do you want
i am komba answer their spokesman quit a young man with flash
ey the acceptedofthegod who in a dai to come that perhap is
near will be the kalubi of the pongo peopl and these ar my servant
i have come here bear gift of friendship which ar without by the
desir of the holi motombo the high priest of the god
i thought that the kalubi wa the priest of your god interrupt
bausi
not so the kalubi is the king of the pongo as you ar the king of the
mazitu the motombo who is seldom seen is king of the spirit and the
mouth of the god
bausi nod in the african fashion that is by rais the chin not
depress it and komba went on
i have place myself in your power trust to your honour you can
kill me if you wish though that will avail noth sinc there ar
other wait to becom kalubi in my place
am i a pongo that i should wish to kill messeng and eat them ask
bausi with sarcasm a speech at which i notic the pongo envoi winc
a littl
king you ar mistaken the pongo onli eat those whom the white god
ha chosen it is a religi rite why should thei who have cattl in
plenti desir to devour men
i dont know grunt bausi but there is on here who can tell a
differ stori and he look at babemba who wriggl uncomfort
komba also look at him with hi fierc ey
it is not conceiv he said that anybodi should wish to eat on
so old and boni but let that pass i thank you king for your promis
of safeti i have come here to ask that you should send envoi to confer
with the kalubi and the motombo that a last peac mai be arrang
between our peopl
why do not the kalubi and the motombo come here to confer ask
bausi
becaus it is not law that thei should leav their land o king
therefor thei have sent me who am the kalubitocom hearken there
ha been war between us for gener it began so long ago that onli
the motombo know of it begin which he ha from the god onc the
pongo peopl own all thi land and onli had their sacr place beyond
the water then your forefath came and fell on them kill mani
enslav mani and take their women to wife now sai the motombo and
the kalubi in the place of war let there be peac where there is but
barren sand there let corn and flower grow let the dark wherein
men lose their wai and die be chang to pleasant light in which thei
can sit in the sun hold each other hand
hear hear i mutter quit move by thi eloqu but bausi wa
not at all move inde he seem to view these poetic propos with
the darkest suspicion
give up kill our peopl or captur them to be sacrif to your
white devil and then in a year or two we mai listen to your word that
ar smear with honei he said as it is we think that thei ar
but a trap to catch fli still if there ar ani of our councillor
will to visit your motombo and your kalubi and hear what thei have to
propos take the risk of whatev mai happen to them there i do not
forbid it now o my councillor speak not altogeth but on by
on and be swift sinc to the first that speak shall be given thi
honour
i think i never heard a denser silenc than that which follow thi
invit each of the induna look at hi neighbour but not on
of them utter a singl word
what exclaim bausi in affect surpris do none speak well
well you ar lawyer and men of peac what sai the great gener
babemba
i sai o king that i went onc to pongoland when i wa young taken
by the hair of my head to leav an ey there and that i do not wish to
visit it again walk on the sole of my feet
it seem o komba that sinc none of my peopl ar will to act as
envoi if there is to be talk of peac between us the motombo and the
kalubi must come here under safe conduct
i have said that cannot be o king
if so all is finish o komba rest eat of our food and return to
your own land
then brother john rose and said
we ar bloodbrethren bausi and therefor i can speak for you if you
and your councillor ar will and these pongo ar will i and
my friend do not fear to visit the motombo and the kalubi to talk with
them of peac on behalf of your peopl sinc we love to see new land
and new race of mankind sai komba if the king allow will you
accept us as ambassador
it is for the king to name hi own ambassador answer komba yet
the kalubi ha heard of the presenc of you white lord in mazituland
and bade me sai that if it should be your pleasur to accompani the
embassi and visit him he would give you welcom onli when the matter
wa laid befor the motombo the oracl spoke thu
let the white men come if come thei will or let them stai awai but
if thei come let them bring with them none of those iron tube great
or small whereof the land ha heard that vomit smoke with a nois and
caus death from afar thei will not need them to kill meat for meat
shall be given to them in plenti moreov among the pongo thei will be
safe unless thei offer insult to the god
these word komba spoke veri slowli and with much emphasi hi pierc
ey fix upon my face as though to read the thought it hid as i
heard them my courag sank into my boot well i knew that the kalubi
wa ask us to pongoland that we might kill thi great white devil
that threaten hi life which i took it wa a monstrou ap and how
could we face that or some other fright brute without firearm my
mind wa made up in a minut
o komba i said my gun is my father my mother my wife and all my
other rel i do not stir from here without it
then white lord answer komba you will do well to stop in thi
place in the midst of your famili sinc if you try to bring it with
you to pongoland you will be kill as you set foot upon the shore
befor i could find an answer brother john spoke sai
it is natur that the great hunter macumazana should not wish to be
part from what which to him is as a stick to a lame man but with me
it is differ for year i have us no gun who kill noth that
god made except a few brightwing insect i am readi to visit
your countri with naught save thi in my hand and he point to the
butterfli net that lean against the fenc behind him
good you ar welcom said komba and i thought that i saw hi ey
gleam with unholi joi there follow a paus dure which i explain
everyth to stephen show that the thing wa mad but here to
my horror that young man mulish obstinaci came in
i sai you know quatermain he said we cant let the old boi go
alon or at least i cant it anoth matter for you who have a son
depend on you but put asid the fact that i mean to get
he wa about to add the orchid when i nudg him of cours it wa
ridicul but an uneasi fear took me lest thi komba should in some
mysteri wai understand what he wa sai what up oh i see
but the beggar cant understand english well put asid everyth
els it isnt the game and there you ar you know if mr brother
john goe ill go too and inde if he doesnt go ill go alon
you unutter young ass i mutter in a stage asid
what is it the young white lord sai he wish in our countri ask
the cold komba who with diabol acut had read some of stephen
mean in hi face
he sai that he is a harmless travel who would like to studi the
sceneri and to find out if you have ani gold there i answer
inde well he shall studi the sceneri and we have gold and he
touch the bracelet on hi arm of which he shall be given as much
as he can carri awai but perchanc white lord you would wish to talk
thi matter over alon have we your leav to withdraw a while o king
five minut later we were seat in the king great hous with bausi
himself and babemba here there wa a mighti argument bausi implor
brother john not to go and so did i babemba said that to go would be
mad as he smelt witchcraft and murder in the air he who knew the
pongo
brother john repli sweetli that he certainli intend to avail himself
of thi heavens opportun to visit on of the few remain
district in thi part of africa through which he had not yet wander
stephen yawn and fan himself with a pockethandkerchief for the
hut wa hot and remark that have come so far after a certain rare
flower he did not mean to return emptyhand
i perceiv dogeetah said bausi at last that you have some reason
for thi journei which you ar hide from me still i am mind to
hold you here by forc
if you do it will break our brotherhood answer brother john seek
not to know what i would hide bausi but wait till the futur shall
declar it
bausi groan and gave in babemba said that dogeetah and wazela were
bewitch and that i macumazana alon retain my sens
then that settl exclaim stephen john and i ar to go as
envoi to the pongo and you quatermain will stop here to look after
the hunter and the store
young man i repli do you wish to insult me after your father
put you in my charg too if you two ar go i shall come also if i
have to do so mothernak but let me tell you onc and for all in the
most emphat languag i can command that i consid you a brace of
confound lunat and that if the pongo dont eat you it will be
more than you deserv to think that at my ag i should be drag among
a lot of cannib savag without even a pistol to fight some unknown
brute with my bare hand well we can onli die oncethat is so far as
we know at present
how true remark stephen how strang and profoundli true
oh i could have box hi ear
we went into the courtyard again whither komba wa summon with hi
attend thi time thei came bear gift or have them born
for them these consist i rememb of two fine tusk of ivori which
suggest to me that their countri could not be entir surround by
water sinc eleph would scarc live upon an island gold dust
in a gourd and copper bracelet which show that it wa miner
white nativ linen veri well woven and some realli beauti decor
pot indic that the peopl had artist tast where did thei
get them from i wonder and what wa the origin of their race i cannot
answer the question for i never found out with ani certainti nor do i
think thei knew themselv
the indaba wa resum bausi announc that we three white men with
a servant apiec i stipul for thi would visit pongoland as hi
envoi take no firearm with us there to discuss term of peac
between the two peopl and especi the question of trade and
intermarriag komba wa veri insist that thi should be includ
at the time i wonder why he komba on behalf of the motombo and the
kalubi the spiritu and tempor ruler of hi land guarante
us safe conduct on the understand that we attempt no insult or
violenc to the god a stipul from which there wa no escap
though i like it littl he swore also that we should be deliv safe
and sound in the mazitu countri within six dai of our have left it
shore
bausi said that it wa good ad that he would send five hundr
arm men to escort us to the place where we were to embark and to
receiv us on our return also that if ani hurt came to us he would wage
war upon the pongo peopl for ever until he found mean to destroi them
so we part it be agre that we were to start upon our journei on
the follow morn
chapter xiii
rica town
as a matter of fact we did not leav beza town till twentyfour hour
later than had been arrang sinc it took some time for old babemba
who wa to be in charg of it to collect and provis our escort of
five hundr men
here i mai mention that when we got back to our hut we found the two
mazitu bearer tom and jerri eat a hearti meal but look
rather tire it appear that in order to get rid of their favour
evid the ceas witchdoctor imbozwi who for some reason or other
had fear to kill them caus them to be march off to a distant part
of the land where thei were imprison on the arriv of the new of
the fall and death of imbozwi and hi subordin thei were set at
liberti and at onc return to us at beza town
of cours it becam necessari to explain to our servant what we were
about to do when thei understood the natur of our propos expedit
thei shook their head and when thei learn that we had promis to
leav our gun behind us thei were speechless with amaz
kransick kransick which mean ill in the skull or mad
exclaim han to the other as he tap hi forehead significantli
thei have caught it from dogeetah on who live on insect which he
entangl in a net and carri no gun to kill game well i knew thei
would
the hunter nod in assent and sammi lift hi arm to heaven as
though in prayer onli mavovo seem indiffer then came the question
of which of them wa to accompani us
so far as i am concern that is soon settl said mavovo i go with
my father macumazana see that even without a gun i am still strong
and can fight as my male ancestor fought with a spear
and i too go with the baa quatermain grunt han see that
even without a gun i am cun as my femal ancestor were befor
me
except when you take medicin spot snake and lose yourself in the
mist of sleep mock on of the zulu doe that fine bedstead which
the king sent you go with you
no son of a fool answer han ill lend it to you who do not
understand that there is more wisdom within me when i am asleep than
there is in you when you ar awak
it remain to be decid who the third man should be as neither
of brother john two servant who had accompani him on hi
crosscountri journei wa suitabl on be ill and the other afraid
stephen suggest sammi as the man chiefli becaus he could cook
no mr somer no said sammi with earnest at thi propos
i draw the thick rope to ask on who can cook to visit a land where he
will be cook is to seeth the offspr in it parent milk
so we gave him up and after some discuss fix upon jerri a smart
and plucki fellow who wa quit will to accompani us the rest of
that dai we spent in make our prepar which if simpl requir
a good deal of thought to my annoy at the time i want to find
han to help me he wa not forthcom when at length he appear i
ask him where he had been he answer to cut himself a stick in
the forest as he understood we should have to walk a long wai also he
show me the stick a long thick staff of a hard and beauti kind of
bamboo which grow in mazituland
what do you want that clumsi thing for i said when there ar plenti
of stick about
new journei new stick baa also thi kind of wood is full of air and
might help me to float if we ar upset into the water
what an idea i exclaim and dismiss the matter from my mind
at dawn on the follow dai we start stephen and i ride on the
two donkei which were now fat and lusti and brother john upon hi
white ox a most docil beast that wa quit attach to him all the
hunter fulli arm came with us to the border of the mazitu countri
where thei were to await our return in compani with the mazitu regiment
the king himself went with us to the west gate of the town where he
bade us all and especi brother john an affection farewel
moreov he sent for komba and hi attend and again swore to him
that if ani harm happen to us he would not rest till he had found a
wai to destroi the pongo root and branch
have no fear answer the cold komba in our holi town of rica we do
not tie innoc guest to stake to be shot to death with arrow
the reparte which wa undoubtedli neat irrit bausi who wa not
fond of allus to thi subject
if the white men ar so safe why do you not let them take their gun
with them he ask somewhat illog
if we meant evil king would their gun help them thei be but few
among so mani for instanc could we not steal them as you did when
you plot the murder of these white lord it is a law among the pongo
that no such magic weapon shall be allow to enter their land
why i ask to chang the convers for i saw that bausi wa
grow veri wrath and fear complic
becaus my lord macumazana there is a propheci among us that when a
gun is fire in pongoland it god will desert us and the motombo
who is their priest will die that sai is veri old but until a
littl while ago none knew what it meant sinc it spoke of a hollow
spear that smoke and such a weapon wa not known to us
inde i said mourn within myself that we should not be in a
posit to bring about the fulfil of that propheci which as han
said shake hi head sadli wa a great piti a veri great piti
three dai march over countri that gradual slope downward from the
high tableland on which stood beza town brought us to the lake call
kirua a word which i believ mean the place of the island of the
lake itself we could see noth becaus of the dens brake of tall
reed which grew out into the shallow water for quit a mile from
the shore and wa onli pierc here and there with path made by the
hippopotami when thei came to the mainland at night to feed from a high
mound which look exactli like a tumulu and for aught i know mai
have been on howev the blue water beyond were visibl and in the
far distanc what look at through glass appear to be a treeclad
mountain top i ask komba what it might be and he answer that it
wa the home of the god in pongoland
what god i ask again whereon he repli like a black herodotu
that of these it wa not law to speak
i have rare met anyon more difficult to pump than that frigid and
unafrican komba
on the top of thi mound we plant the union jack fix to the tallest
pole that we could find komba ask suspici why we did so and
as i wa determin to show thi unsympathet person that there were
other as unpump as himself i repli that it wa the god of our
tribe which we set up there to be worship and that anyon who
tri to insult or injur it would certainli die as the witchdoctor
imbozwi and hi children had found out for onc komba seem a littl
impress and even bow to the bunt as he pass by
what i did not inform him wa that we had set the flag there to be a
sign and a beacon to us in case we should ever be forc to find our wai
back to thi place unguid and in a hurri as a matter of fact thi
piec of forethought which oddli enough origin with the most
reckless of our parti stephen prove our salvat as i shall tell
later on at the foot of the mound we set our camp for the night the
mazitu soldier under babemba who did not mind mosquito make
their nearer to the lake just opposit to where a wide hippopotamu
lane pierc the reed leav a littl canal of clear water
i ask komba when and how we were to cross the lake he said that we
must start at dawn on the follow morn when at thi time of the
year the wind gener blew off shore and that if the weather were
favour we should reach the pongo town of rica by nightfal as to
how we were to do thi he would show me if i care to follow him i
nod and he led me four or five hundr yard along the edg of the
reed in a southerli direct
as we went two thing happen the first of these wa that a veri
larg black rhinocero which wa sleep in some bush suddenli got
our wind and after the fashion of these beast charg down on us from
about fifti yard awai now i wa carri a heavi singlebarrel
rifl for as yet we and our weapon were not part on came the
rhinocero and komba small blame to him for he onli had a spear
start to run i cock the rifl and wait my chanc
when it wa not more than fifteen pace awai the rhinocero threw up it
head at which of cours it wa useless to fire becaus of the horn
and i let drive at the throat the bullet hit it fair and i suppos
penetr to the heart at ani rate it roll over and over like a
shot rabbit and with a singl stretch of it limb expir almost at
my feet
komba wa much impress he return he stare at the dead rhinocero
and at the hole in it throat he stare at me he stare at the still
smoke rifl
the great beast of the plain kill with a nois he mutter
kill in an instant by thi littl monkei of a white man i thank
him for that and made a note of it and hi magic oh the motombo wa
wise when he command and with an effort he stop
well friend what is the matter i ask you see there wa no need
for you to run if you had step behind me you would have been as safe
as you ar nowaft run
it is so lord macumazana but the thing is strang to me forgiv me
if i do not understand
oh i forgiv you my lord kalubithat isto be it is clear that you
have a good deal to learn in pongoland
ye my lord macumazana and so perhap have you he repli dryli
have by thi time recov hi nerv and sarcast power
then after tell mavovo who appear mysteri at the sound of the
shoti think he wa stalk us in case of accidentsto fetch men to
cut up the rhinocero komba and i proceed on our walk
a littl further on just by the edg of the reed i caught sight of
a narrow oblong trench dug in a patch of stoni soil and of a rust
mustard tin halfhidden by some scanti veget
what is that i ask in seem astonish though i knew well
what it must be
oh repli komba who evid wa not yet quit himself that is
where the white lord dogeetah bausi bloodbroth set hi littl
canva hous when he wa here over twelv moon ago
realli i exclaim he never told me he wa here thi wa a lie
but somehow i wa not afraid of ly to komba how do you know that
he wa here
on of our peopl who wa fish in the reed saw him
oh that explain it komba but what an odd place for him to fish in
so far from home and i wonder what he wa fish for when you have
time komba you must explain to me what it is that you catch amidst the
root of thick reed in such shallow water
komba repli that he would do so with pleasurewhen he had time then
as though to avoid further convers he ran forward and thrust
the reed apart show me a great cano big enough to hold thirti or
forti men which with infinit labour had been hollow out of the trunk
of a singl huge tree thi cano differ from the major of those
that person i have seen us on african lake and river in that it
wa fit for a mast now unship i look at it and said it wa a
fine boat whereon komba repli that there were a hundr such at rica
town though not all of them were so larg
ah thought i to myself as we walk back to the camp then allow an
averag of twenti to a cano the pongo tribe number about two
thousand male old enough to paddl an estim which turn out to be
singularli correct
next morn at dawn we start with some difficulti to begin with
in the middl of the night old babemba came to the canva shelter under
which i wa sleep woke me up and in a long speech implor me not to
go he said he wa convinc that the pongo intend foul plai of some
sort and that all thi talk of peac wa a mere trick to entrap us white
men into the countri probabl in order to sacrific us to it god for
a religi reason
i answer that i quit agre with him but that as my companion
insist upon make thi journei i could not desert them all that
i could do wa to beg him to keep a sharp lookout so that he might be
abl to help us in case we got into troubl
here i will stai and watch for you lord macumazana he answer but
if you fall into a snare am i abl to swim through the water like a
fish or to fly through the air like a bird to free you
after he had gone on of the zulu hunter arriv a man name ganza
a sort of lieuten to mavovo and sang the same song he said that
it wa not right that i should go without gun to die among devil and
leav him and hi companion wander alon in a strang land
i answer that i wa much of the same opinion but that dogeetah
insist upon go and that i had no choic
then let us kill dogeetah or at ani rate tie him up so that he can
do no more mischief in hi mad ganza suggest blandli whereon i
turn him out
lastli sammi arriv and said

the morn came at last and the six of us march down to the cano
which had been brought round to the open waterwai here we had to
undergo a kind of customshous examin at the hand of komba
and hi companion who seem terrifi lest we should be smuggl
firearm
you know what rifl ar like i said indignantli can you see ani in
our hand moreov i give you my word that we have none
komba bow polit but suggest that perhap some littl gun by
which he meant pistol remain in our baggagebi accid komba wa
a most suspici person
undo all the load i said to han who obei with an enthusiasm
which i confess struck me as suspici
know hi secret and tortuou natur thi sudden zeal for open
seem almost unnatur he began by unrol hi own blanket insid
of which appear a miscellan collect of articl i rememb
among them a spare pair of veri dirti trouser a batter tin cup a
wooden spoon such as kaffir us to eat their scoff with a bottl
full of some doubt compound sundri root and other nativ medicin
an old pipe i had given him and last but not least a huge head of
yellow tobacco in the leaf of a kind that the mazitu like the pongo
cultiv to some extent
what on earth do you want so much tobacco for han i ask
for us three black peopl to smoke baa or to take as snuff or to
chew perhap where we ar go we mai find littl to eat and then
tobacco is a food on which on can live for dai also it bring sleep
at night
oh that will do i said fear lest han like a second walter
raleigh wa about to deliv a long lectur upon the virtu of tobacco
there is no need for the yellow man to take thi weed to our land
interrupt komba for there we have plenti why doe he cumber himself
with the stuff and he stretch out hi hand idli as though to take
hold of and examin it close
at thi moment howev mavovo call attent to hi bundl which
he had undon whether on purpos or by accid i do not know and
forget the tobacco komba turn to attend to him with a marvel
celer han roll up hi blanket again in less than a minut the
lash were fast and it wa hang on hi back again suspicion took
me but an argument which had sprung up between brother john and komba
about the former butterfli net which komba suspect of be a
new kind of gun or at least a magic instrument of a danger sort
attract my notic after thi disput anoth aros over a common
garden trowel that stephen had thought fit to bring with him komba
ask what it wa for stephen repli through brother john that it wa
to dig up flower
flower said komba on of our god is a flower doe the white lord
wish to dig up our god
of cours thi wa exactli what stephen did desir to do but not
unnatur he kept the fact to himself the squabbl grew so hot that
final i announc that if our littl belong were treat with so
much suspicion it might be better that we should give up the journei
altogeth
we have pass our word that we have no firearm i said in the most
dignifi manner that i could command and that should be enough for
you o komba
then komba after consult with hi companion gave wai evid
he wa anxiou that we should visit pongoland
so at last we start we three white men and our servant seat
ourselv in the stern of the cano on grass cushion that had been
provid komba went to the bow and hi peopl take the broad
paddl row and push the boat along the waterwai made by the
hippopotami through the tall and mat reed from which duck and
other fowl rose in multitud with a sound like thunder a quarter of an
hour or so of paddl through these weedencumb shallow brought
us to the deep and open lake here on the edg of the reed a tall
pole that serv as a mast wa ship and a squar sail made of
closelywoven mat run up it fill with the morn offland breez
and present we were bowl along at a rate of quit eight mile
the hour the shore grew dim behind us but for a long while abov the
cling mist i could see the flag that we had plant on the mound by
degre it dwindl till it becam a mere speck and vanish as it grew
smaller my spirit sank and when it wa quit gone i felt veri low
inde
anoth of your fool errand allan my boi i said to myself i wonder
how mani more you ar destin to surviv
the other too did not seem in the best of spirit brother john
stare at the horizon hi lip move as though he were engag in
prayer and even stephen wa temporarili depress jerri had fallen
asleep as a nativ gener doe when it is warm and he ha noth
to do mavovo look veri thought i wonder whether he had been
consult hi snake again but did not ask him sinc the episod of
our escap from execut by bow and arrow i had grown somewhat afraid
of that unholi reptil next time it might foretel our immedi doom
and if it did i knew that i should believ
as for han he look much disturb and wa engag in wildli hunt
for someth in the flap pocket of an antiqu corduroi waistcoat
which from it gener appear must i imagin year ago have
adorn the person of a british gamekeep
three i heard him mutter by my great grandfath spirit onli
three left
three what i ask in dutch
three charm baa and there ought to have been quit twentyfour the
rest have fallen out through a hole that the devil himself made in thi
rotten stuff now we shall not die of hunger and we shall not be shot
and we shall not be drown at least none of those thing will happen
to me but there ar twentyon other thing that mai finish us as i
have lost the charm to ward them off thu
oh stop your rubbish i said and fell again into the depth of my
uncomfort reflect after thi i too went to sleep when i woke
it wa past middai and the wind wa fall howev it held while
we at some food we had brought with us after which it di awai
altogeth and the pongo peopl took to their paddl at my suggest
we offer to help them for it occur to me that we might just as
well learn how to manag these paddl so six were given to us and
komba who now i note wa begin to speak in a somewhat imperi
tone instruct us in their us at first we made but a poor hand at
the busi but three or four hour steadi practic taught us a good
deal inde befor our journei end i felt that we should be quit
capabl of manag a cano if ever it becam necessari for us to do
so
by three in the afternoon the shore of the island we were
approachingif it realli wa an island a point that i never clear
upwer well in sight the mountain top that stood some mile inland
have been visibl for hour in fact through my glass i had been
abl to make out it configur almost from the begin of the
voyag about five we enter the mouth of a deep bai fring on
either side with forest in which were cultiv clear with small
villag of the ordinari african stamp i observ from the smaller size
of the tree adjac to these clear that much more land had onc
been under cultiv here probabl within the last centuri and ask
komba why thi wa so
he answer in an enigmat sentenc which impress me so much that i
find i enter it verbatim in my notebook
when man di corn di man is corn and corn is man
under thi entri i see that i wrote compar the sai bread is the
staff of life
i could not get ani more out of him evid he refer howev to
a condit of shrink in the popul a circumst which he did
not care to discuss
after the first few mile the bai narrow sharpli and at it end came
to a point where a stream of no great breadth fell into it on either
side of thi stream that wa roughli bridg in mani place stood the
town of rica it consist of a great number of larg hut roof with
palm leav and construct appar of whitewash clai or rather
as we discov afterward of lake mud mix with chop straw or
grass
reach a kind of wharf which wa protect from eros by pile
form of small tree driven into the mud to which were ti a fleet
of cano we land just as the sun wa begin to sink our approach
had doubtless been observ for as we drew near the wharf a horn wa
blown by someon on the shore whereon a consider number of men
appear i suppos out of the hut and assist to make the cano
fast i note that these all resembl komba and hi companion in
build and featur thei were so like each other that except for the
differ of their ag it wa difficult to tell them apart thei
might all have been member of on famili inde thi wa practic
the case ow to constant intermarriag carri on for gener
there wa someth in the appear of these tall cold
sharpfeatur whiterob men that chill my blood someth
unnatur and almost inhuman here wa noth of the usual african
jolliti no on shout no on laugh or chatter no on crowd on
us try to handl our person or cloth no on appear afraid
or even astonish except for a word or two thei were silent mere
contempl us in a chill and distant fashion as though the
arriv of three white men in a countri where befor no white man had
ever set foot were an everydai occurr
moreov our person appear did not seem to impress them for
thei smile faintli at brother john long beard and at my stubbl hair
point these out to each other with their slender finger or with the
handl of their big spear i remark that thei never us the blade
of the spear for thi purpos perhap becaus thei thought that we
might take thi for a hostil or even a warlik demonstr it is
humili to have to add that the onli on of our compani who seem
to move them to wonder or interest wa han hi extrem ugli and
wrinkl counten it wa clear did appeal to them to some extent
perhap becaus thei had never seen anyth in the least like it
befor or perhap for anoth reason which the reader mai guess in due
cours
at ani rate i heard on of them point to han ask komba whether
the apeman wa our god or onli our captain the compliment seem to
pleas han who hitherto had never been look on either as a god or
a captain but the rest of us were not flatter inde mavovo wa
indign and told han outright that if he heard ani more such talk he
would beat him befor these peopl to show them that he wa neither a
captain nor a god
wait till i claim to be either o butcher of a zulu befor you
threaten to treat me thu ejacul han indignantli then he ad
with hi peculiar hottentot snigger still it is true that befor all
the meat is eaten ie befor all is done you mai think me both a
dark sai which at the time we did not understand
when we had land and collect our belong komba told us to follow
him and led us up a wide street that wa veri tidili kept and border
on either side by the larg hut whereof i have spoken each of these
hut stood in a fenc garden of it own a thing i have rare seen
elsewher in africa the result of thi arrang wa that although as
a matter of fact it had but a compar small popul the area
cover by rica wa veri great the town by the wai wa not surround
with ani wall or other fortif which show that the inhabit
fear no attack the water of the lake were their defenc
for the rest the chief characterist of thi place wa the silenc
that brood there appar thei kept no dog for none bark and
no poultri for i never heard a cock crow in pongoland cattl and
nativ sheep thei had in abund but as thei did not fear ani enemi
these were pastur outsid the town their milk and meat be brought
in as requir a consider number of peopl were gather to
observ us not in a crowd but in littl famili group which collect
separ at the gate of the garden
for the most part these consist of a man and on or more wive fine
form and handsom women sometim thei had children with them but
these were veri few the most i saw with ani on famili wa three and
mani seem to possess none at all both the women and the children
like the men were decent cloth in long white garment anoth
peculiar which show that these nativ were no ordinari african
savag
oh i can see rica town now after all these mani year the wide street
swept and garnish the brownroof whitewal hut in their
fertil irrig garden the tall silent folk the smoke from the
cook fire rise straight as a line in the still air the grace
palm and other tropic tree and at the head of the street far awai
to the north the round tower shape of the forestclad mountain
that wa call hous of the god often that vision come back to me in
my sleep or at time in my wake hour when some heavi odour remind
me of the overpow scent of the great trumpetlik bloom which hung
in profus upon broadleav bush that were plant in almost everi
garden
on we march till at last we reach a tall live fenc that wa
cover with brilliant scarlet flower arriv at it gate just as the
last red glow of dai fade from the sky and night began to fall komba
push open the gate reveal a scene that none of us ar like to
forget the fenc enclos about an acr of ground of which the back
part wa occupi by two larg hut stand in the usual garden
in front of these not more than fifteen pace from the gate stood
anoth build of a total differ charact it wa about fifti
feet in length by thirti broad and consist onli of a roof support
upon carv pillar of wood the space between the pillar be fill
with grass mat or blind most of these blind were pull down but
four exactli opposit the gate were open insid the shed forti or fifti
men who wore white robe and peculiar cap and who were engag in
chant a dread melancholi song were gather on three side of a
huge fire that burn in a pit in the ground on the fourth side that
face the gate a man stood alon with hi arm outstretch and hi
back toward us
of a sudden he heard our footstep and turn round spring to the
left so that the light might fall on us now we saw by the glow of the
great fire that over it wa an iron grid not unlik a small bedstead
and that on thi grid lai some fear object stephen who wa a littl
ahead stare then exclaim in a horrifi voic
my god it is a woman
in anoth second the blind fell down hide everyth and the
sing ceas
chapter xiv
the kalubi oath
be silent i whisper and all understood my tone if thei did not
catch the word then steadi myself with an effort for thi hideou
vision which might have been a pictur from hell made me feel faint i
glanc at komba who wa a pace or two in front of us evid he wa
much disturbedth motion of hi back told me thisbi the sens of
some terribl mistak that he had made for a moment he stood still
then wheel round and ask me if we had seen anyth
ye i answer indiffer we saw a number of men gather round
a fire noth more
he tri to search our face but luckili the great moon now almost
at her full wa hidden behind a thick cloud so that he could not read
them well i heard him sigh in relief as he said
the kalubi and the head men ar cook a sheep it is their custom to
feast togeth on those night when the moon is about to chang follow
me white lord
then he led us round the end of the long shed at which we did not even
look and through the garden on it farther side to the two fine hut i
have mention here he clap hi hand and a woman appear i know
not whenc to her he whisper someth she went awai and present
return with four or five other women who carri clai lamp fill
with oil in which float a wick of palm fibr these lamp were set
down in the hut that prove to be veri clean and comfort place
furnish after a fashion with wooden stool and a kind of low tabl of
which the leg were carv to the shape of antelop feet also there
wa a wooden platform at the end of the hut whereon lai bed cover
with mat and stuf with some soft fibr
here you mai rest safe he said for white lord ar you not the
honour guest of the pongo peopl present food i shudder at the
word will be brought to you and after you have eaten well if it is
your pleasur the kalubi and hi councillor will receiv you in yonder
feasthous and you can talk with them befor you sleep if you need
aught strike upon that jar with a stick and he point to what look
like a copper cauldron that stood in the garden of the hut near the
place where the women were alreadi light a fire and some will wait
on you look here ar your good none ar miss and here come
water in which you mai wash now i must go to make report to the
kalubi and with a courteou bow he depart
so after a while did the silent handsom womento fetch our meal i
understood on of them to sai and at length we were alon
my aunt said stephen fan himself with hi pockethandkerchief
did you see that ladi toast i have often heard of cannib those
slave for instanc but the actual busi oh my aunt
it is no us address your absent auntif you have got on what did
you expect if you would insist on come to a hell like thi i ask
gloomili
cant sai old fellow dont troubl myself much with expect as
a rule that why i and my poor old father never could get on i alwai
quot the text suffici to the dai is the evil thereof to him
until at length he sent for the famili bibl and rule it out with red
ink in a rage but i sai do you think that we shall be call upon to
understudi st lawrenc on that grid
certainli i do i repli and as old babemba warn you you cant
complain
oh but i will and i can and so will you wont you brother john
brother john woke up from a reveri and stroke hi long beard
sinc you ask me mr somer he said reflect if it were a
case of martyrdom for the faith like that of the saint to whom you have
allud i should not objectat ani rate in theori but i confess that
speak from a secular point of view i have the strongest dislik to
be cook and eaten by these veri disagre savag still i
see no reason to suppos that we shall fall victim to their domest
custom
i be in a depress mood wa about to argu to the contrari when
han poke hi head into the hut and said
dinner come baa veri fine dinner
so we went out into the garden where the tall impass ladi were
arrang mani wooden dish on the ground now the moon wa clear of
cloud and by it brilliant light we examin their content some
were cook meat cover with a kind of sauc that made it natur
indistinguish as a matter of fact i believ it wa mutton
butwho could sai other were evid of a veget natur for
instanc there wa a whole platter full of roast meali cob and
a great boil pumpkin to sai noth of some bowl of curdl milk
regard thi feast i becam awar of a sudden and complet convers
to those principl of vegetarian which brother john wa alwai
preach to me
i am sure you ar quit right i said to him nervous in hold
that veget ar the best diet in a hot climat at ani rate i have
made up my mind to try the experi for a few dai and throw
manner to the wind i grab four of the upper meali cob and the
top of the pumpkin which i cut off with a knife somehow i did not seem
to fanci that portion of it which touch the platter for who knew what
those dish might have contain and how often thei were wash
stephen also appear to have found salvat on thi point for he
too patron the meali cob and the pumpkin so did mavovo and so
did even that inveter meateat han onli the simpl jerri tackl
the fleshpot of egypt or rather of pongoland with appetit and
declar that thei were good i think that he be the last of us
through the gatewai had not realiz what it wa which lai upon the
grid
at length we finish our simpl mealwhen you ar veri hungri it take
a long time to fill oneself with squashi pumpkin which is why i suppos
rumin and other graze anim alwai seem to be eatingand wash
it down with water in prefer to the stickylook milk which we
left to the nativ
allan said brother john to me in a low voic as we lit our pipe
that man who stood with hi back to us in front of the gridiron wa the
kalubi against the firelight i saw the gap in hi hand where i cut awai
the finger
well if we want to get ani further you must cultiv him i
answer but the question is shall we get further thanthat grid i
believ we have been trap here to be eaten
befor brother john could repli komba arriv and after inquir
whether our appetit had been good intim that the kalubi and
head men were readi to receiv us so off we went with the except of
jerri whom we left to watch our thing take with us the present we
had prepar
komba led us to the feasthous where the fire in the pit wa out
or had been cover over and the grid and it horribl burden had
disappear also now all the mat were roll up so that the clear
moonlight flow into and illumin the place seat in a semicircl
on wooden stool with their face toward the gatewai were the kalubi
who occupi the centr and eight councillor all of them greyhair
men thi kalubi wa a tall thin individu of middl ag with i
think the most nervou counten that i ever saw hi featur
twitch continu and hi hand were never still the ey too as
far as i could see them in that light were full of terror
he rose and bow but the councillor remain seat greet us with
a longcontinu and soft clap of the hand which it seem wa
the pongo method of salut
we bow in answer then seat ourselv on three stool that had been
place for us brother john occupi the middl stool mavovo and han
stood behind us the latter support himself with hi larg bamboo
stick as soon as these preliminari were over the kalubi
call upon komba whom he address in formal languag as
youwhohavepassedthegod and youthekalubitob i thought i
saw him winc as he said these word to give an account of hi mission
and of how it came about that thei had the honour of see the white
lord there
komba obei after address the kalubi with everi possibl titl
of honour such as absolut monarch master whose feet i kiss
he whose ey ar fire and whose tongu is a sword he at whose nod
peopl die lord of the sacrific first taster of the sacr meat
belov of the god here the kalubi shrank as though he had been
prick with a spear second to none on earth save the motombo the
most holi the most ancient who come from heaven and speak with the
voic of heaven etc etc he gave a clear but brief account of all
that had happen in the cours of hi mission to beza town
especi did he narrat how in obedi to a messag which he had
receiv from the motombo he had invit the white lord to pongoland
and even accept them as envoi from the mazitu when none would respond
to king bausi invit to fill that offic onli he had stipul
that thei should bring with them none of their magic weapon which
vomit out smoke and death as the motombo had command at thi
inform the express counten of the kalubi onc more betrai
mental disturb that i think komba note as much as we did howev
he said noth and after a paus komba went on to explain that no
such weapon had been brought sinc not satisfi with our word that
thi wa so he and hi companion had search our baggag befor we
left mazituland
therefor he ad there wa no caus to fear that we should bring
about the fulfil of the old propheci that when a gun wa fire among
the pongo the god would desert the land and the peopl ceas to be a
peopl
have finish hi speech he sat down in a humbl place behind us
then the kalubi after formal accept us as ambassador from bausi
king of the mazitu discours at length upon the advantag which would
result to both peopl from a last peac between them final he
propound the articl of such a peac these it wa clear had been
carefulli prepar but to set them out would be useless sinc thei
never came to anyth and i doubt whether it wa intend that thei
should suffic it to sai that thei provid for intermarriag free
trade between the countri bloodbrotherhood and other thing that
i have forgotten all of which wa to be ratifi by bausi take a
daughter of the kalubi to wife and the kalubi take a daughter of
bausi
we listen in silenc and when he had finish after a pretend
consult between us i spoke as the mouth of brother john who
i explain wa too grand a person to talk himself sai that the
propos seem fair and reason and that we should be happi to
submit them to bausi and hi council on our return
the kalubi express great satisfact at thi statement but remark
incident that first of all the whole matter must be laid befor the
motombo for hi opinion without which no state transact had legal
weight among the pongo he ad that with our approv he propos that
we should visit hi holi on the morrow start when the sun wa
three hour old as he live at a distanc of a dai journei from rica
after further consult we repli that although we had littl time
to spare as we understood that the motombo wa old and could not
visit us we the white lord would stretch a point and call on him
meanwhil we were tire and wish to go to bed then we present our
gift which were gracefulli accept with an intim that return
present would be made to us befor we left pongoland
after thi the kalubi took a littl stick and broke it to intim that
the confer wa at an end and have bade him and hi councillor
good night we retir to our hut
i should add becaus it ha a bear on subsequ event that
on thi occas we were escort not by komba but by two of the
councillor komba as i note for the first time when we rose to sai
goodby wa no longer present at the council when he left it i cannot
sai sinc it will be rememb that hi seat wa behind us in the
shadow and none of us saw him go
what do you make of all that i ask the other when the door wa
shut
brother john mere shook hi head and said noth for in those dai
he seem to be live in a kind of dreamland
stephen answer bosh tommi rot all my ey and my elbow those
maneat johnni have some game up their wide sleev and whatev
it mai be it isnt peac with the mazitu
i agre i said if the real object were peac thei would have
haggl more stood out for better term or hostag or someth
also thei would have got the consent of thi motombo beforehand clearli
he is the master of the situat not the kalubi who is onli hi tool
if busi were meant he should have spoken first alwai suppos
that he exist and isnt a myth howev if we live we shall learn and
if we dont it doesnt matter though person i think we should be
wise to leav motombo alon and to clear out to mazituland by the first
cano tomorrow morn
i intend to visit thi motombo broke in brother john with decis
ditto ditto exclaim stephen but it no us argu that all
over again
no i repli with irrit it is as you remark of no us
argu with lunat so let go to bed and as it will probabl be
our last have a good night sleep
hear hear said stephen take off hi coat and place it doubl
up on the bed to serv as a pillow i sai he ad stand clear a
minut while i shake thi blanket it cover with bit of someth
and he suit the action to the word
bit of someth i said suspici why didnt you wait a minut
to let me see them i didnt notic ani bit befor
rat run about the roof i expect said stephen carelessli
not be satisfi i began to examin thi roof and the clai wall
which i forgot to mention were paint over in a kind of pattern with
whorl in it by the feebl light of the primit lamp while i wa
thu engag there wa a knock on the door forget all about the
dust i open it and han appear
on of these maneat devil want to speak to you baa mavovo
keep him without
let him in i said sinc in thi place fearless seem our best
game but watch well while he is with us
han whisper a word over hi shoulder and next moment a tall man
wrap from head to foot in white cloth so that he look like a
ghost came or rather shot into the hut and close the door behind him
who ar you i ask
by wai of answer he lift or unwrap the cloth from about hi face
and i saw that the kalubi himself stood befor us
i wish to speak alon with the white lord dogeetah he said in
a hoars voic and it must be now sinc afterward it will be
imposs
brother john rose and look at him
how ar you kalubi my friend he ask i see that your wound ha
heal well
ye ye but i would speak with you alon
not so repli brother john if you have anyth to sai you must
sai it to all of us or leav it unsaid sinc these lord and i ar
on and that which i hear thei hear
can i trust them mutter the kalubi
as you can trust me therefor speak or go yet first can we be
overheard in thi hut
no dogeetah the wall ar thick there is no on on the roof for i
have look all round and if ani strove to climb there we should hear
also your men who watch the door would see him none can hear us save
perhap the god
then we will risk the god kalubi go on my brother know your
stori
my lord he began roll hi ey about him like a hunt creatur
i am in a terribl pass onc sinc i saw you dogeetah i should have
visit the white god that dwell in the forest on the mountain yonder
to scatter the sacr seed but i feign to be sick and komba the
kalubitob who ha pass the god went in my place and return
unharm now tomorrow the night of the full moon as kalubi i must
visit the god again and onc more scatter the seed anddogeetah he
will kill me whom he ha onc bitten he will certainli kill me unless
i can kill him then komba will rule as kalubi in my stead and he will
kill you in a wai you can guess by the hot death as a sacrific to
the god that the women of the pongo mai onc more becom the mother
of mani children ye ye unless we can kill the god who dwell in
the forest we all must die and he paus trembl while the sweat
drop from him to the floor
that pleasant said brother john but suppos that we kill the
god how would that help us or you to escap from the motombo and these
murder peopl of your sure thei would slai us for the sacrileg
not so dogeetah if the god di the motombo di it is known from
of old and therefor the motombo watch over the god as a mother over
her child then until a new god is found the mother of the holi flower
rule she who is merci and will harm none and i rule under her and
will certainli put my enemi to death especi that wizard komba
here i thought i heard a faint sound in the air like the hiss of a
snake but as it wa not repeat and i could see noth conclud
that i wa mistaken
moreov he went on i will load you with gold dust and ani gift
you mai desir and set you safe across the water among your friend
the mazitu

not which he is twice as big as ani man and stronger than twenti men
whom he can break in hi hand as i break a reed or whose head he can
bite off in hi mouth as he bit off my finger for a warn for that
is how he treat the kalubi when he weari of them first he bite off
a finger and let them go and next he break them like a reed as also

your race now of middl ag when she di she will be succeed by her
daughter who also is a white woman and veri beauti after she di
anoth who is white will be found perhap on who is of black parent

intent voic and who is her father

of the flower wa captur and brought here she sai that the father
wa a white man to whom she wa marri but who is dead
brother john head drop upon hi chest and hi ey shut as though
he had gone to sleep
as for where the mother live went on the kalubi it is on the
island in the lake at the top of the mountain that is surround by
water she ha noth to do with the white god but those women who
serv her go across the lake at time to tend the field where grow the
seed that the kalubi sow of which the corn is the white god food
good i said now we understandnot much but a littl tell us next
what is your plan how ar we to come into the place where thi great
ap live and if we come there how ar we to kill the beast see
that your successor komba wa care to prevent us from bring our
firearm to your land
ay lord macumazana mai the teeth of the god meet in hi brain for
that trick ye mai he die as i know how to make him die that propheci
of which he told you is no propheci from of old it aros in the land
within the last moon onli though whether it came from komba or from
the motombo i know not none save myself or at least veri few here had
heard of the iron tube that throw out death so how should there be a
propheci concern them
i am sure i dont know kalubi but answer the rest of the question
as to your come into the forestfor the white god live in a forest
on the slope of the mountain lordsthat will be easi sinc the
motombo and the peopl will believ that i am trap you there to be a
sacrific such as thei desir for sundri reason and he look at the
plump stephen in a veri suggest wai as to how you ar to kill the
god without your tube of iron that i do not know but you ar veri
brave and great magician sure you can find a wai
here brother john seem to wake up again
ye he said we shall find a wai have no fear of that o kalubi we
ar not afraid of the big ap whom you call a god yet it must be at a
price we will not kill thi beast and try to save your life save at a
price
what price ask the kalubi nervous there ar wive and
cattleno you do not want the wive and the cattl cannot be taken
across the lake there ar gold dust and ivori i have alreadi promis
these and there is noth more that i can give
the price is o kalubi that you hand over to us to be taken awai
the white woman who is call mother of the holi flower with her
daughter
and interrupt stephen to whom i had been interpret the holi
flower itself all of it dug up by the root
when he heard these modest request the poor kalubi becam like on upon
the verg of mad
do you understand he gasp do you understand that you ar ask
for the god of my countri
quit repli brother john with calm for the god of your
countrynoth more nor less
the kalubi made as though he would fly from the hut but i caught him by
the arm and said
see friend thing ar thu you ask us at great danger to ourselv
to kill on of the god of your countri the highest of them in order
to save your life well in payment we ask you to make a present of the
remain god of your countri and to see us and them safe across the
lake do you accept or refus
i refus answer the kalubi sullenli to accept would mean the last
curs upon my spirit that is too horribl to tell
and to refus mean the first curs upon your bodi name that in a
few hour it must be broken and chew by a great monkei which you call
a god ye broken and chew and afterward i think cook and eaten
as a sacrific is it not so
the kalubi nod hi head and groan
yet i went on for our part we ar glad that you have refus sinc
now we shall be rid of a troublesom and danger busi and return
in safeti to mazitu land
how will you return in safeti o lord macumazana you who ar doom to
the hot death if you escap the fang of the god
veri easili o kalubi by tell komba the kalubitob of your
plot against thi god of your and how we have refus to listen to
your wicked in fact i think thi mai be done at onc while you ar
here with us o kalubi where perhap you do not expect to be found
i will go strike upon the pot without the door doubtless though it is
late some will hear nai man stand you still we have knive and our
servant have spear and i made as though to pass him
lord he said i will give you the mother of the holi flower and her
daughter ay and the holi flower itself dug up by the root and i
swear that if i can i will set you and them safe across the lake onli
ask that i mai come with you sinc here i dare not stai yet the
curs will come too but if so it is better to die of a curs in a dai
to be than tomorrow at the fang of the god oh why wa i born why
wa i born and he began to weep
that is a question mani have ask and none have been abl to answer o
friend kalubi though mayhap there is an answer somewher i repli in
a kind voic
for my heart wa stir with piti of thi poor wretch maze and lost in
hi hell of superstit thi potent who could not escap from the
trap of a hate power save by the door of a death too horribl
to contempl thi priest whose doom it wa to be slain by the veri
hand of hi god as those who went befor him had been slain and as
those who came after him would be slain
yet i went on i think you have chosen wise and we hold you to
your word while you ar faith to us we will sai noth but
of thi be surethat if you attempt to betrai us we who ar not so
helpless as we seem will betrai you and it shall be you who die not
us is it a bargain
it is a bargain white lord although blame me not if thing go wrong
sinc the god know all and thei ar devil who delight in human woe
and mock at bargain and torment those who would injur them yet come
what will i swear to keep faith with you thu by the oath that mai not
be broken and draw a knife from hi girdl he thrust out the tip
of hi tongu and prick it from the punctur a drop of blood fell to
the floor
if i break my oath he said mai my flesh grow cold as that blood
grow cold and mai it rot as that blood rot ay and mai my spirit
wast and be lost in the world of ghost as that blood wast into the
air and is lost in the dust of the world
it wa a horribl scene and on that impress me veri much especi
as even then there fell upon me a convict that thi unfortun man
wa doom that a fate which he could not escap wa upon him
we said noth and in anoth moment he had thrown hi white wrap
over hi face and slip through the door
i am afraid we ar plai it rather low down on that jumpi old boi
said stephen remorsefulli
the white woman the white woman and her daughter mutter brother
john
ye reflect stephen aloud on is justifi in do anyth to
get two white women out of thi hell if thei exist so on mai as well
have the orchid also for theyd be lone without it poor thing
wouldnt thei glad i thought of that it sooth to the conscienc
i hope youll find it so when we ar all on that iron grid which i
notic is wide enough for three i remark sarcast now be
quiet i want to go to sleep
i am sorri to have to add that for the most of that night want remain
my master but if i couldnt sleep i could or rather wa oblig to
think and i thought veri hard inde
first i reflect on the pongo and their god what were these and why
did thei worship them soon i gave it up rememb that the problem
wa on which appli equal to dozen of the dark religion of thi
vast african contin to which none could give an answer and least
of all their votari that answer inde must be sought in the horribl
fear of the unenlighten human heart which see death and terror
and evil around it everywher and in thi grotesqu form or in that
personifi them in god or rather in devil who must be propiti
for alwai the fetish or the beast or whatev it mai be is not
the real object of worship it is onli the thing or creatur which is
inhabit by the spirit of the god or devil the templ as it were
that furnish it with a home which templ is therefor holi and these
spirit ar divers repres sundri attribut or qualiti
thu the great ap might be satan a princ of evil and blood the holi
flower might symbolis fertil and the growth of the food of man from
the bosom of the earth the mother of the flower might repres merci
and good for which reason it wa necessari that she should be
white in colour and dwell not in the shadow forest but on a soar
mountain a figur of light in short as oppos to dark or she
might be a kind of african cere a goddess of the corn and harvest
which were symbolis in the beauteou bloom she tend who could tell
not i either then or afterward for i never found out
as for the pongo themselv their case wa obviou thei were a dy
tribe the last descend of some higher race grown barren from
intermarriag probabl too thei were at first onli cannib
occasion and from religi reason then in some time of dearth
thei becam veri religi in that respect and the habit overpow
them among cannib at ani rate in africa as i knew thi dread
food is much prefer to ani other meat i had not the slightest doubt
that although the kalubi himself had brought us here in the wild
hope that we might save him from a terribl death at the hand of the
beelzebub he serv komba and the councillor inspir thereto by the
prophet call motombo design that we should be murder and eaten as
an offer to the god how we were to escap thi fate be unarm
i could not imagin unless some special protect were vouchsaf to
us meanwhil we must go on to the end whatev it might be
brother john or to give him hi right name the reverend john everslei
wa convinc that the white woman imprison in the mountain wa none
other than the lost wife for whom he had search for twenti weari
year and that the second white woman of whom we had heard that night
wa strang as it might seem her daughter and hi own perhap he
wa right and perhap he wa wrong but even in the latter case if two
white person were realli languish in thi dread land our path
wa clear we must go on in faith until we save them or until we di
our life is grant not in pleasur round
or even love sweet dream to laps content
duti and faith ar word of solemn sound
and to their echo must the soul be bent
as some on or other onc wrote veri nobli i think well there wa but
littl of pleasur round about the present entertain and ani
hope of love sweet dream seem to be limit to brother john here
i wa quit mistaken as i so often am probabl the echo would be
my share inde alreadi i seem to hear their omin thunder
at last i did go to sleep and dream a veri curiou dream it seem to
me that i wa disembodi although i retain all my power of thought
and observ in fact dead and yet aliv in thi state i hover
over the peopl of the pongo who were gather togeth on a great plain
under an inki sky thei were go about their busi as usual and
veri unpleas busi it often wa some of them were worship a
dim form that i knew wa the devil some were commit murder some
were feastingat that on which thei feast i would not look some were
labour or engag in barter some were think but i who had
the power of look into them saw within the breast of each a tini
like of the man or woman or child as it might be humbl bent
upon it knee with hand togeth in an attitud of prayer and with
implor tearstain face look upward to the black heaven
then in that heaven there appear a singl star of light and from thi
star flow line of gentl fire that spread and widen till all the
immens arc wa on flame of glori and now from the puls heart of
the glori which somehow remind me of move lip fell countless
flake of snow each of which follow an appoint path till it lit
upon the forehead of on of the tini implor figur hidden within
those savag breast and made it white and clean
then the glori shrank and fade till there remain of it onli
the similitud of two transpar hand stretch out as though in
blessingand i woke up wonder how on earth i found the fanci to
invent such a vision and whether it meant anyth or noth
afterward i repeat it to brother john who wa a veri spiritu
mind as well as a good manth two thing ar often quit
differentand ask him to be kind enough to explain at the time he
shook hi head but some dai later he said to me
i think i have read your riddl allan the answer came to me quit of
a sudden in all those sinstain heart there is a seed of good and
an aspir toward the right for everi on of them also there is at
last merci and forgiv sinc how could thei learn who never had a
teacher your dream allan wa on of the ultim redempt of even
the most evil of mankind by gift of the grace that shall on dai glow
through the black of the night in which thei wander
that is what he said and i onli hope that he wa right sinc at
present there is someth veri wrong with the world especi in
africa
also we blame the blind savag for mani thing but on the balanc ar
we so much better consid our light and opportun oh
the truth is that the devila veri conveni word thati a good
fisherman he ha a larg book full of fli of differ size and
colour and well he know how to suit them to each particular fish but
white or black everi fish take on fly or the other and then come
the questioni the fish that ha swallow the big gaudi lure so much
wors or more foolish than that which ha fallen to the delic white
moth with the same sharp barb in it tail
in short ar we not all miser sinner as the prayer book sai and
in the ey of ani judg who can averag up the element differ of
those water wherein we were bred and ar call upon to swim is there
so much to choos between us do we not all need those outstretch
hand of merci which i saw in my dream
but there there what right ha a poor old hunter to discuss thing
that ar too high for him
chapter xv
the motombo
after my dream i went to sleep again till i wa final arous by a
strong rai of light hit me straight in the ey
where the dicken doe that come from thought i to myself for these
hut had no window
then i follow the rai to it sourc which i perceiv wa a small
hole in the mud wall some five feet abov the floor i rose and examin
the said hole and note that it appear to have been freshli made for
the clai at the side of it wa in no wai discolour i reflect that
if anyon want to eavesdrop such an apertur would be conveni and
went outsid the hut to pursu my investig it wall i found wa
situat about four feet from the eastern part of the encircl reed
fenc which show no sign of disturb although there in the
outer face of the wall wa the hole and beneath it on the lime
floor lai some broken fragment of plaster i call han and ask
him if he had kept watch round the hut when the wrappedup man visit
us dure the night he answer ye and that he could swear that no
on had come near it sinc sever time he had walk to the back and
look
somewhat comfort though not satisfi i went in to wake up the
other to whom i said noth of thi matter sinc it seem foolish
to alarm them for no good purpos a few minut later the tall silent
women arriv with our hot water it seem curiou to have hot water
brought to us in such a place by these veri queer kind of housemaid
but so it wa the pongo i mai add were like the zulu veri clean in
their person though whether thei all us hot water i cannot sai at
ani rate it wa provid for us
half an hour later thei return with breakfast consist chiefli of
a roast kid of which as it wa whole and therefor unmistak
we partook thankfulli a littl later the majest komba appear
after mani compliment and inquiri as to our gener health he ask
whether we were readi to start on our visit to the motombo who he
ad wa expect us with much eager i inquir how he knew
that sinc we had onli arrang to call on him late on the previou
night and i understood that he live a dai journei awai but komba
put the matter by with a smile and a wave of hi hand
so in due cours off we went take with us all our baggag which now
that it had been lighten by the deliveri of the present wa of no
great weight
five minut walk along the wide main street led us to the northern
gate of rica town here we found the kalubi himself with an escort of
thirti men arm with spear i note that unlik the mazitu thei had no
bow and arrow he announc in a loud voic that he propos to do us
the special honour of conduct us to the sanctuari of the holi on by
which we understood him to mean the motombo when we polit beg him
not to troubl be in an irrit mood or assum it he told us
rude to mind our own busi inde i think thi irrit wa
real enough which in the circumst known to the reader wa not
strang at ani rate an hour or so later it declar itself in an act
of great cruelti which show us how absolut wa thi man power in
all tempor matter
pass through a littl clump of bush we came to some garden
surround by a light fenc through which a number of cattl of a small
and delic breedthei were not unlik jersei in appearancehad
broken to enjoi themselv by devour the crop thi garden it
appear belong to the kalubi for the time be who wa furiou at
the destruct of it produc by the cattl which also belong to him
where is the herd he shout
a hunt beganand present the poor fellowh wa no more than a lad
wa discov asleep behind a bush when he wa drag befor him the
kalubi point first to the cattl then to the broken fenc and the
devast garden the lad began to mutter excus and prai for merci
kill him said the kalubi whereon the herd flung himself to the
ground and clutch him by the ankl began to kiss hi feet cry
out that he wa afraid to die the kalubi tri to kick himself free
and fail in thi lift hi big spear and made an end of the poor
boi prayer and life at a singl stroke
the escort clap their hand in salut or approv after which four
of them at a sign took up the bodi and start with it at a trot for
rica town where probabl that night it appear upon the grid brother
john saw and hi big white beard bristl with indign like the
hair on the back of an angri cat while stephen splutter someth
begin with you brute and lift hi fist as though to knock the
kalubi down thi had i not caught hold of him i have no doubt he
would have done
o kalubi gasp brother john do you not know that blood call for
blood in the hour of your own death rememb thi death
would you bewitch me white man said the kalubi glare at him
angrili if so and onc more he lift the spear but as john
never stir held it pois irresolut komba thrust himself between
them cry
back dogeetah who dare to meddl with our custom is not the kalubi
lord of life and death
brother john wa about to answer but i call to him in english
for heaven sake be silent unless you want to follow the boi we ar
in these men power
then he rememb and walk awai and present we march forward as
though noth had happen onli from that moment i do not think that
ani of us worri ourselv about the kalubi and what might befal him
still look back on the thing i think that there wa thi excus to
be made for the man he wa mad with the fear of death and knew not what
he did
all that dai we travel on through a rich flat countri that as we
could tell from variou indic had onc been wide cultiv
now the field were few and far between and bush for the most part a
kind of bamboo scrub wa reoccupi the land about middai we halt
by a waterpool to eat and rest for the sun wa hot and here the four
men who had carri off the boi bodi rejoin us and made some report
then we went forward onc more toward what seem to be a curiou
and precipit wall of black cliff beyond which the volcaniclook
mountain tower in state grandeur by three oclock we were near
enough to thi cliff which ran east and west as far as the ey could
reach to see a hole in it appar where the road termin that
appear to be the mouth of a cave
the kalubi came up to us and in a shy kind of wai tri to make
convers i think that the sight of thi mountain draw ever
nearer vividli recal hi terror and caus him to desir to effac
the bad impress he knew he had made on us to whom he look for
safeti among other thing he told us that the hole we saw wa the door
of the hous of the motombo
i nod my head but did not answer for the presenc of thi murder
king made me feel sick so he went awai again look at us in a humbl
and deprecatori manner
noth further happen until we reach the remark wall of rock
that i have mention which i suppos is compos of some veri
hard stone that remain when the softer rock in which it lai wa
disintegr by million of year of weather or wash by the water
of the lake or perhap it substanc wa thrown out of the bowel of
the volcano when thi wa activ i am no geologist and cannot sai
especi as i lack time to examin the place at ani rate there it
wa and there in it appear the mouth of a great cave that i presum
wa natur have onc form a kind of drain through which the lake
overflow when pongoland wa under water
we halt stare dubious at thi darksom hole which no doubt wa
the same that babemba had explor in hi youth then the kalubi gave
an order and some of the soldier went to hut that were built near the
mouth of the cave where i suppos guardian or attend live
though of these we saw noth present thei return with a number of
light torch that were distribut among us thi done we plung
shiver at least i shiver into the gloomi recess of that great
cavern the kalubi go befor us with half of our escort and komba
follow behind us with the remaind
the floor of the place wa made quit smooth doubtless by the action of
water as were the wall and roof so far as we could see them for it
wa veri wide and lofti it did not run straight but curv about in
the thick of the cliff at the first turn the pongo soldier set up
a low and eeri chant which thei continu dure it whole length that
accord to my pace wa someth over three hundr yard on we
wound the torch make star of light in the intens black till
at length we round a last corner where a great curtain of woven grass
now drawn wa stretch across the cave here we saw a veri strang
sight
on either side of it near to the wall burn a larg wood fire that
gave light to the place also more light flow into it from it further
mouth that wa not more than twenti pace from the fire beyond the
mouth wa water which seem to be about two hundr yard wide and
beyond the water rose the slope of the mountain that wa cover with
huge tree moreov a littl bai penetr into the cavern the point
of which bai end between the two fire here the water which wa not
more than six or eight feet wide and shallow form the berth place
of a goodsiz cano that lai there the wall of the cavern from
the turn to the point of the tongu of water were pierc with four
doorwai two on either side which led i presum to chamber hewn in
the rock at each of these doorwai stood a tall woman cloth in
white who held in her hand a burn torch i conclud that these were
attend set there to guid and welcom us for after we had pass
thei vanish into the chamber
but thi wa not all set across the littl bai of water just abov the
cano that float there wa a wooden platform eight feet or so squar
on either side of which stood an enorm eleph tusk bigger inde
than ani i have seen in all my experi which tusk seem to be
black with ag between the tusk squat upon rug of some kind of
rich fur wa what from it shape and attitud i at first took to be a
huge toad in truth it had all the appear of a veri bloat toad
there wa the rough corrug skin there the promin backbon for
it back wa toward us and there were the thin splayedout leg
we stare at thi strang object for quit a long while unabl to make
it out in that uncertain light for so long inde that i grew nervou
and wa about to ask the kalubi what it might be as my lip open
howev it stir and with a slow grope circular movement turn
itself toward us veri slowli at length it wa round and as the head
came in view all the pongo from the kalubi down ceas their low weird
chant and flung themselv upon their face those who had torch still
hold them up in their right hand
oh what a thing appear it wa not a toad but a man that move upon
all four the larg bald head wa sunk deep between the shoulder
either through deform or from ag for thi creatur wa undoubtedli
veri old look at it i wonder how old but could form no answer in
my mind the great broad face wa sunken and wither like to leather
dri in the sun the lower lip hung pendul upon the promin and
boni jaw two yellow tusklik teeth project on at each corner of
the great mouth all the rest were gone and from time to time it lick
the white gum with a redpoint tongu as a snake might do but the
chief wonder of the thing lai in it ey that were larg and round
perhap becaus the flesh had shrunk awai from them which gave them
the appear of be set in the hollow orbit of a skull these ey
liter shone like fire inde at time thei seem posit to
blaze as i have seen a lion ey do in the dark i confess that the
aspect of the creatur terrifi and for a while paralys me to think
that it wa human wa aw
i glanc at the other and saw that thei too were frighten stephen
turn veri white i thought that he wa go to be sick again as
he wa after he drank the coffe out of the wrong bowl on the dai we
enter mazituland brother john stroke hi white beard and mutter
some invoc to heaven to protect him han exclaim in hi
abomin dutch
oh keek baa da is je lelich oud deel oh look baa there
is the ugli old devil himself
jerri went flat on hi face among the pongo mutter that he saw death
befor him onli mavovo stood firm perhap becaus as a witchdoctor of
reput he felt that it did not becom him to show the white feather in
the presenc of an evil spirit
the toadlik creatur on the platform swai it great head slowli as
a tortois doe and contempl us with it flame ey at length
it spoke in a thick guttur voic us the tongu that seem to
be common to thi part of africa and inde to that branch of the bantu
peopl to which the zulu belong but as i thought with a foreign
accent
so you ar the white men come back it said slowli let me count
and lift on skinni hand from the ground it point with the
forefing and count on tall with a white beard ye that is
right two short nimbl like a monkei with hair that want no comb
clever too like a father of monkei ye that is right three
smoothfac young and stupid like a fat babi that laugh at the sky
becaus he is full of milk and think that the sky is laugh at him
ye that is right all three of you ar just the same as you us to
be do you rememb white beard how while we kill you you said
prayer to on who sit abov the world and held up a cross of bone to
which a man wa ti who wore a cap of thorn do you rememb how you
kiss the man with the cap of thorn as the spear went into you you
shake your headoh you ar a clever liar but i will show you that you
ar a liar for i have the thing yet and snatch up a horn which lai
on the kaross beneath him he blew
as the peculiar wail note that the horn made di awai a woman
dash out of on of the doorwai that i have describ and flung
herself on her knee befor him he mutter someth to her and she
dash back again to reappear in an instant hold in her hand a
yellow ivori crucifix
here it is here it is he said take it white beard and kiss it
onc more perhap for the last time and he threw the crucifix
to brother john who caught it and stare at it amaz and do you
rememb fat babi how we caught you you fought well veri well
but we kill you at last and you were good veri good we got much
strength from you
and do you rememb father of monkei how you escap from us by your
clever i wonder where you went to and how you di i shall not
forget you for you gave me thi and he point to a big white scar
upon hi shoulder you would have kill me but the stuff in that iron
tube of your burn slowli when you held the fire to it so that i had
time to jump asid and the iron ball did not strike me in the heart as
you meant that it should yet it is still here oh ye i carri it
with me to thi dai and now that i have grown thin i can feel it with
my finger
i listen astonish to thi harangu which if it meant anyth
meant that we had all met befor in africa at some time when men us
matchlock that were fire with a fusethat is to sai about the year
1700 or earlier reflect howev show me the interpret of
thi nonsens obvious thi old priest forefath or if on put
him at a hundr and twenti year of ag and i am sure that he wa not
a dai less perhap hi father as a young man wa mix up with
some of the first european who penetr to the interior of africa
probabl these were portugues of whom on mai have been a priest
and the other two an elderli man and hi son or young brother or
companion the manner of the death of these peopl and of what happen
to them gener would of cours be rememb by the descend of
the chief or head medicineman of the tribe
where did we meet and when o motombo i ask
not in thi land not in thi land father of monkei he repli in
hi low rumbl voic but far far awai toward the west where the
sun sink in the water and not in thi dai but long long ago twenti
kalubi have rule the pongo sinc that dai some have rule for mani
year and some have rule for a few yearsthat depend upon the will
of my brother the god yonder and he chuckl horribl and jerk hi
thumb backward over hi shoulder toward the forest on the mountain
ye twenti have rule some for thirti year and none for less than
four
well you ar a larg old liar i thought to myself for take the
averag rule of the kalubi at ten year thi would mean that we met
him two centuri ago at least
you were cloth otherwis then he went on and two of you wore
hat of iron on the head but that of white beard wa shaven i caus a
pictur of you to be beaten by the mastersmith upon a plate of copper
i have it yet
again he blew upon hi horn again a woman dart out to whom he
whisper again she went to on of the chamber and return bear an
object which he cast to us
we look at it it wa a copper or bronz plaqu black appar
with ag which onc had been nail on someth for there were the
hole it repres a tall man with a long beard and a tonsur head
who held a cross in hi hand and two other men both short who wore
round metal cap and were dress in queerlook garment and boot
with squar toe these man carri big and heavi matchlock and in the
hand of on of them wa a smoke fuse that wa all we could make out
of the thing
why did you leav the far countri and come to thi land o motombo i
ask
becaus we were afraid that other white men would follow on your step
and aveng you the kalubi of that dai order it though i said no
who knew that none can escap by flight from what must come when it must
come so we travel and travel till we found thi place and here
we have dwelt from gener to gener the god came with us also
my brother that dwell in the forest came though we never saw him on
the journei yet he wa here befor us the holi flower came too and
the white mother of the flowersh wa the wife of on of you i know
not which
your brother the god i said if the god is an ap as we have heard
how can he be the brother of a man
oh you white men do not understand but we black peopl understand in
the begin the ap kill my brother who wa kalubi and hi spirit
enter into the ap make him as a god and so he kill everi other
kalubi and their spirit enter also into him is it not so o kalubi of
todai you without a finger and he laugh mockingli
the kalubi who wa ly on hi stomach groan and trembl but made
no other answer
so all ha come about as i foresaw went on the toadlik creatur
you have return as i knew you would and now we shall learn whether
white beard yonder spoke true word when he said that hi god would be
aveng upon our god you shall go to be aveng on him if you can
and then we shall learn but thi time you have none of your iron tube
which alon we fear for did not the god declar to us through me that
when the white men came back with an iron tube then he the god would
die and i the motombo the god mouth would die and the holi flower
would be torn up and the mother of the flower would pass awai and the
peopl of the pongo would be dispers and becom wander and slave
and did he not declar that if the white men came again without their
iron tube then certain secret thing would happenoh ask them not
in time thei shall be known to you and the peopl of the pongo who were
dwindl would again becom fruit and veri great and that is why we
welcom you white men who aris again from the land of ghost becaus
through you we the pongo shall becom fruit and veri great
of a sudden he ceas hi rumbl talk hi head sank back between hi
shoulder and he sat silent for a long while hi fierc sparkl
ey plai on us as though he would read our veri thought if he
succeed i hope that mine pleas him to tell the truth i wa fill
with mix fear furi and loath although of cours i did not
believ a word of all the rubbish he had been sai which wa akin to
much that is evolv by these blackheart african wizard i hate the
creatur whom i felt to be onli halfhuman my whole natur sicken at
hi aspect and talk and yet i wa dreadfulli afraid of him i felt as
a man might who wake up to find himself alon with some peculiarli
disgust christmasstori kind of ghost moreov i wa quit sure that
he meant us ill fear and immin ill suddenli he spoke again
who is that littl yellow on he said that old on with a face like
a skull and he point to han who had kept as much out of sight as
possibl behind mavovo that wizen snubnos on who might be a
child of my brother the god if ever he had a child and why be so
small doe he need so larg a staff here he point again to hanss
big bamboo stick i think he is as full of guil as a newfil gourd
with water the big black on and he look at mavovo i do not fear
for hi magic is less than my magic he seem to recognis a brother
doctor in mavovo but the littl yellow on with the big stick and the
pack upon hi back i fear him i think he should be kill
he paus and we trembl for if he chose to kill the poor hottentot
how could we prevent him but han who saw the great danger call hi
cun to hi aid
o motombo he squeak you must not kill me for i am the servant of
an ambassador you know well that all the god of everi land hate and
will be reveng upon those who touch ambassador or their servant
whom thei the god alon mai harm if you kill me i shall haunt you
ye i shall sit on your shoulder at night and jibber into your ear so
that you cannot sleep until you die for though you ar old you must
die at last motombo
it is true said the motombo did i not tell you that he wa full of
cun all the god will be aveng upon those who kill ambassador
or their servant thather he laugh again in hi dread wayi
the right of the god alon let the god of the pongo settl it
i utter a sigh of relief and he went on in a new voic a dull
businesslik voic if i mai so describ it
sai o kalubi on what matter have you brought these white men to speak
with me the mouth of the god did i dream that it wa a matter of a
treati with the king of the mazitu rise and speak
so the kalubi rose and with a humbl air set out briefli and clearli the
reason of our visit to pongoland as the envoi of bausi and the head
of the treati that had been arrang subject to the approv of the
motombo and bausi we note that the affair did not seem to interest the
motombo at all inde he appear to go to sleep while the speech wa
be deliv perhap becaus he wa exhaust with the invent
of hi outrag falsehood or perhap for other reason when it wa
finish he open hi ey and point to komba sai
aris kalubithatistob
so komba rose and in hi cold precis voic narrat hi share in the
transact tell how he had visit bausi and all that had happen
in connect with the embassi again the motombo appear to go to
sleep onli open hi ey onc as komba describ how we had been
search for firearm whereon he nod hi great head in approv and
lick hi lip with hi thin red tongu when komba had done he said
the god tell me that the plan is wise and good sinc without new
blood the peopl of the pongo will die but of the end of the matter the
god know alon if even he can read the futur
he paus then ask sharpli
have you anyth more to sai o kalubithatistob now of a sudden
the god put it into my mouth to ask if you have anyth more to sai
someth o motombo mani moon ago the god bit off the finger of
our high lord the kalubi the kalubi have heard that a white man
skill in medicin who could cut off limb with knive wa in the
countri of the mazitu and camp on the border of the great lake took
a cano and row to where the white man wa camp he with the beard
who is name dogeetah and who stand befor you i follow him in
anoth cano becaus i wish to know what he wa do also to see
a white man i hid my cano and those who went with me in the reed far
from the kalubi cano i wade through the shallow water and conceal
myself in some thick reed quit near to the white man linen hous
i saw the white man cut off the kalubi finger and i heard the kalubi
prai the white man to come to our countri with the iron tube that
smoke and to kill the god of whom he wa afraid
now from all the compani went up a great gasp and the kalubi fell down
upon hi face again and lai still onli the motombo seem to show no
surpris perhap becaus he alreadi knew the stori
is that all he ask
no o mouth of the god last night after the council of which you have
heard the kalubi wrap himself up like a corps and visit the white
men in their hut i thought that he would do so and had made readi
with a sharp spear i bore a hole in the wall of the hut work from
outsid the fenc then i thrust a reed through from the fenc across
the passag between the fenc and the wall and through the hole in the
hut and set my ear to the end of the reed i listen
oh clever clever mutter han in involuntari admir and
to think that i look and look too low beneath the reed oh han
though you ar old you have much to learn
among much els i heard thi went on komba in sentenc so clear and
cold that thei remind me of the tinkl of fall ic which i
think is enough though i can tell you the rest if you wish o mouth
i heard he said in the midst of a silenc that wa posit aw
our lord the kalubi whose name is child of the god agre with the
white men that thei should kill the godhow i do not know for it wa
not saidand that in return thei should receiv the person of the
mother of the holi flower and of her daughter the motherthatistob
and should dig up the holi flower itself by the root and take it awai
across the water togeth with the mother and the motherthatistob
that is all o motombo
still in the midst of an intens silenc the motombo glare at the
prostrat figur of the kalubi for a long while he glare then the
silenc wa broken for the wretch kalubi sprang from the floor
seiz a spear and tri to kill himself befor the blade touch
him it wa snatch from hi hand so that he remain stand but
weaponless
again there wa silenc and again it wa broken thi time by the
motombo who rose from hi seat befor which he stood a huge bloat
object and roar aloud in hi rage ye he roar like a wound
buffalo never would i have believ that such a vast volum of sound
could have proceed from the lung of a singl ag man for fulli a
minut hi furiou bellow echo down that great cave while all
the pongo soldier rise from their recumb posit point their
hand in some of which torch still burn at the miser kalubi
on whom their wrath seem to be concentr rather than on us and
hiss like snake
realli it might have been a scene in hell with the motombo plai the
part of satan inde hi swollen diabol figur support on the
thin toadlik leg the great fire burn on either side the lurid
light of even reflect from the still water beyond and glower
among the tree top of the mountain the whiterob form of the tall
pongo bend everi on of them toward the wretch culprit and
hiss like so mani fierc serpent all suggest some uttermost deep
in the infern region as on might conceiv them in a nightmar
it went on for some time i dont know how long till at length the
motombo pick up hi fantast shape horn and blew thereon the
women dart from the variou doorwai but see that thei were not
want check themselv in their stride and remain stand so in
the veri attitud of runner about to start upon a race as the blast
of the horn di awai the turmoil wa suddenli succeed by an utter
still broken onli by the crackl of the fire whose flame
of all the live thing in that place alon seem heedless of the
tragedi which wa be plai
all up now old fellow whisper stephen to me in a shaki voic
ye i answer all up high as heaven where i hope we ar go
now back to back and let make the best fight we can weve got the
spear
while we were close in the motombo began to speak
so you plot to kill the god kalubiwhowa he scream with
these white on whom you would pai with the holi flower and her who
guard it good you shall go all of you and talk with the god and i
watch here will learn who diesyou or the god awai with them
chapter xvi
the god
with a roar the pongo soldier leapt on us i think that mavovo manag
to get hi spear up and kill a man for i saw on of them fall backward
and lie still but thei were too quick for the rest of us in half a
minut we were seiz the spear were wrench from our hand and we
were thrown headlong into the cano all six of us or rather seven
includ the kalubi a number of the soldier includ komba who
act as steersman also sprang into the cano that wa instantli push
out from beneath the bridg or platform on which the motombo sat and
down the littl creek into the still water of the canal or estuari
or whatev it mai be that separ the wall of rock which the cave
pierc from the base of the mountain
as we float out of the mouth of the cave the toadlik motombo who
had wheel round upon hi stool shout an order to komba
o kalubi he said set the kalubiwhowa and the three white men
and their three servant on the border of the forest that is name
houseofthegod and leav them there then return and depart for here
i would watch alon when all is finish i will summon you
komba bow hi handsom head and at a sign two of the men got out
paddl for more were not need and with slow and gentl stroke
row us across the water the first thing i note about thi water at
the time wa that it black wa inki ow i suppos to it depth
and the shadow of the tower cliff on on side and of the tall tree
on the other also i observedfor in thi emerg or perhap becaus
of it i manag to keep my wit about methat it bank on either side
were the home of great number of crocodil which lai there like log
i saw further that a littl lower down where the water seem to
narrow jag bough project from it surfac as though great tree
had fallen or been thrown into it i recal in a numb sort of wai
that old babemba had told us that when he wa a boi he had escap in a
cano down thi estuari and reflect that it would not be possibl for
him to do so now becaus of those snag unless inde he had float
over them in a time of great flood
a coupl of minut or so of paddl brought us to the further shore
which as i think i have said wa onli about two hundr yard from the
mouth of the cave the bow of the cano grate on the bank disturb a
huge crocodil that vanish into the depth with an angri plung
land white lord land said komba with the utmost polit and
go visit the god who doubtless is wait for you and now as we shall
meet no morefarewel you ar wise and i am foolish yet hearken to my
counsel if ever you should return to the earth again be advis by me
cling to your own god if you have on and do not meddl with those of
other peopl again farewel
the advic wa excel but at that moment i felt a hate for komba
which wa realli superhuman to me even the motombo seem an angel of
light as compar with him if wish could have kill our farewel
would inde have been complet
then admonish by the spear point of the pongo we land in the
slimi mud brother john went first with a smile upon hi handsom
counten that i thought idiot under the circumst though
doubtless he knew best when he ought to smile and the wretch kalubi
came last inde so great wa hi shrink from that omin
shore that i believ he wa ultim propel from the boat by hi
successor in power komba onc he had trodden it howev a spark of
spirit return to him for he wheel round and said to komba
rememb o kalubi that my fate todai will be your also in a dai to
come the god weari of hi priest thi year next year or the year
after he alwai weari of hi priest
then o kalubithatwa answer komba in a mock voic as the
cano wa push off prai to the god for me that it mai be the year
after prai it as your bone break in hi embrac
while we watch that craft depart there came into my mind the memori
of a pictur in an old latin book of my father which repres the
soul of the dead be paddl by a person name charon across a river
call the styx the scene befor us bore a great resembl to that
pictur there wa charon boat float on the dread styx yonder
glow the light of the world here wa the gloomi unknown shore and
we we were the soul of the dead await the last destruct at the
teeth and claw of some unknown monster such as that which haunt the
recess of the egyptian hell oh the parallel wa painfulli exact and
yet what do you think wa the remark of that irrepress young man
stephen
here we ar at last allan my boi he said and after all without
ani troubl on our own part i call it downright providenti oh isnt
it jolli hip hip hoorai
ye he danc about in that filthi mud threw up hi cap and cheer
i wither or rather tri to wither him with a look mutter the
singl word lunat
providenti jolli well it fortun that some peopl mad
take a cheer turn then i ask the kalubi where the god wa
everywher he repli wave hi trembl hand at the illimit
forest perhap behind thi tree perhap behind that perhap a long
wai off befor morn we shall know
what ar you go to do i inquir savag

but we dont mean to take us to some place where we shall be safe from
thi god

he shook hi silli head and went on how can we be safe when there is
nowher to go and even the tree ar too big to climb
i look at them it wa true thei were huge and ran up for fifti
or sixti feet without a bough moreov it wa probabl that the god
climb better than we could the kalubi began to move inland in an
indetermin fashion and i ask him where he wa go
to the buryingplac he answer there ar spear yonder with the
bone
i prick up my ear at thisfor when on ha noth but some clasp
knive spear ar not to be despisedand order him to lead on in
anoth minut we were walk uphil through the aw wood where the
gloom at thi hour of approach night wa that of an english fog
three or four hundr pace brought us to a kind of clear where
i suppos some of the monster tree had fallen down in past year and
never been allow to grow up again here place upon the ground were
a number of box made of imperish ironwood and on the top of each
box sat or rather lai a moulder and broken skull
kalubithatwer murmur our guid in explan look komba ha
made my box readi and he point to a new case with the lid off
how thought of him i said but show us the spear befor it get
quit dark he went to on of the newer coffin and intim that we
should lift off the lid as he wa afraid to do so
i shove it asid there within lai the bone each of them separ
and wrap up in someth except of cours the skull with these were
some pot fill appar with gold dust and alongsid of the pot
two good spear that be made of copper had not rust much we went
on to other coffin and extract from them more of these weapon that
were laid there for the dead man to us upon hi journei through the
shade until we had enough the shaft of most of them were somewhat
rotten from the damp but luckili thei were furnish with copper
socket from two and a half to three feet long into which the wood of
the shaft fit so that thei were still servic

own and komba interest on the shore of the lake thi head he tore
apart and produc the stock of the rifl nice clean a cap set
readi on the nippl on to which the hammer wa let down with a littl
piec of wad between to prevent the cap from be fire by ani sudden

thank you baa thank you though just now id rather have a drop of
brandi andi dont see ani wood
he wa right outsid of the graveyard clear lai it is true some
huge fallen bough but these were too big for us to move or cut
moreov thei were so soak with damp like everyth in thi forest
that it would be imposs to fire them
the dark close in it wa not absolut black becaus present
the moon rose but the sky wa raini and obscur it moreov the huge
tree all about seem to suck up whatev light there wa we crouch
ourselv upon the ground back to back as near as possibl to the centr
of the place unrol such blanket as we had to protect us from the
damp and cold and at some biltong or dri game flesh and parch
corn of which fortun the boi jerri carri a bag that had
remain upon hi shoulder when he wa thrown into the cano luckili i
had thought of bring thi food with us also a flask of spirit
then it wa that the first thing happen far awai in the forest
resound a most aw roar follow by a drum nois such a roar
as none of us had ever heard befor for it wa quit unlik that of a
lion or ani other beast
what is that i ask
the god groan the kalubi the god prai to the moon with which
he alwai rise
i said noth for i wa reflect that four shot which wa all
we had wa not mani and that noth should tempt me to wast on of
them oh why had han put on that rotten old waistcoat instead of the
new on i gave him in durban
sinc we heard no more roar brother john began to question the kalubi
as to where the mother of the flower live
lord answer the man in a distract wai there toward the east
you walk for a quarter of the sun journei up the hill follow
a path that is mark by notch cut upon the tree till beyond
the garden of the god at the top of the mountain more water is found
surround an island there on the bank of the water a cano is hidden
in the bush by which the water mai be cross to the island where
dwell the mother of the holi flower
brother john did not seem to be quit satisfi with the inform
and remark that he the kalubi would be abl to show us the road on
the morrow
i do not think that i shall ever show you the road groan the
shiver wretch
at that moment the god roar again much nearer now the kalubi nerv
gave out altogeth and quicken by some presenti he began to
question brother john whom he had learn wa a priest of an unknown
sort as to the possibl of anoth life after death
brother john who be it rememb wa a veri earnest missionari by
call proceed to administ some compress religi consol
when quit near to us the god began to beat upon some kind of veri
larg and deep drum he didnt roar thi time he onli work awai at
a massedband militari drum at least that is what it sound like and
veri unpleas it wa to hear in that aw forest with skull arrang
on box all round us i can assur you my reader
the drum ceas and pull himself togeth brother john
continu hi piou demonstr also just at that time a thick
raincloud quit obscur the moon so that the dark grew dens i
heard john explain to the kalubi that he wa not realli a kalubi
but an immort soul i wonder whether he understood him then i becam
awar of a horribl shadowi cannot describ it in ani other
waythat wa blacker than the black which advanc toward us at
extraordinari speed from the edg of the clear
next second there wa a kind of scuffl a few feet from me follow by
a stifl yell and i saw the shadow retreat in the direct from
which it had come
what the matter i ask
strike a match answer brother john i think someth ha
happen
i struck a match which burnt up veri well for the air wa quit still
in the light of it i saw first the anxiou face of our partyhow
ghastli thei lookedand next the kalubi who had risen and wa wave
hi right arm in the air a right arm that wa bloodi and lack the
hand
the god ha visit me and taken awai my hand he moan in a wail
voic
i dont think anybodi spoke the thing wa beyond word but we tri to
bind the poor fellow arm up by the light of match then we sat down
again and watch
the dark grew still denser as the thick of the cloud pass over the
moon and for a while the silenc that utter silenc of the tropic
forest at night wa broken onli by the sound of our breath the buzz
of a few mosquito the distant splash of a plung crocodil and the
stifl groan of the mutil man
again i saw or thought i sawthi mai have been half an hour
laterthat black shadow dart toward us as a pike dart at a fish in
a pond there wa anoth scuffl just to my lefthan sat between me
and the kalubifollow by a singl prolong wail
the kingman ha gone whisper han i felt him go as though a wind
had blown him awai where he wa there is noth but a hole
of a sudden the moon shone out from behind the cloud in it sickli
light about halfwai between us and the edg of the clear sai thirti
yard off i sawoh what did i see the devil destroi a lost soul
at least that is what it look like a huge greyblack creatur
grotesqu human in it shape had the thin kalubi in it grip the
kalubi head had vanish in it maw and it vast black arm seem to
be emploi in break him to piec
appar he wa alreadi dead though hi feet that were lift off
the ground still move feebli
i sprang up and cover the beast with the rifl which wa cock
get full on to it head which show the clearest though thi wa
rather guesswork sinc i could not see distinctli the foresight i
pull but either the cap or the powder had got a littl damp on
the journei and hung fire for the fraction of a second in that
infinitesim time the devilit is the best name i can give the
thingsaw me or perhap it onli saw the light gleam on the barrel
at ani rate it drop the kalubi and as though some intellig
warn it what to expect threw up it massiv right armi rememb how
extraordinarili long the limb seem and that it look thick as a man
thighin such a fashion as to cover it head
then the rifl explod and i heard the bullet strike by the light of
the flash i saw the great arm tumbl down in a dead helpless kind of
wai and next instant the whole forest began to echo with peal upon peal
of those aw roar that i have describ each of which end with
a doglik yowp of pain
you have hit him baa said han and he isnt a ghost for he
doesnt like it but he still veri live
close up i answer and hold out the spear while i reload
my fear wa that the brute would rush on us but it did not for all
that dread night we saw or heard it no more inde i began to hope
that after all the bullet had reach some mortal part and that the
great ap wa dead
at length it seem to be week afterward the dawn broke and reveal
us sit white and shiver in the grei mist that is all except
stephen who had gone comfort to sleep with hi head rest on
mavovo shoulder he is a man so equabl mind and so devoid of
nerv that i feel sure he will be on of the last to be disturb by
the trump of the archangel at least so i told him indignantli when at
length we rous him from hi indec slumber
you should judg thing by result allan he said with a yawn im
as fresh as a pippin while you all look as though you had been to a ball
with twelv extra have you retriev the kalubi yet
shortli afterward when the mist lift a littl we went out in a
line to retriev the kalubi and foundwel i wont describ what we
found he wa a cruel wretch as the incid of the herdboi had told
us but i felt sorri for him still hi terror were over or at least
i hope so
we deposit him in the box that komba had kindli provid in
prepar for thi inevit event and brother john said a prayer
over hi miscellan remain then after consult and in the veri
worst of spirit we set out to seek the wai to the home of the mother
of the flower the start wa easi enough for a distinct though veri
faint path led from the clear up the slope of the hill afterward it
becam more difficult for the denser forest began fortun veri
few creeper grew in thi forest but the flat top of the huge tree
meet high abov entir shut out the sky so that the gloom wa
great in place almost that of night
oh it wa a melancholi journei as fill with fear we stole a
pallid throng from trunk to trunk search them for the notch that
indic our road and speak onli in whisper lest the sound of our
voic should attract the notic of the dread god after a mile or
two of thi we becam awar that it notic wa attract despit our
precaut for at time we caught glimps of some huge grei thing
slip along parallel to us between the bole of the tree han
want me to try a shot but i would not know that the chanc of
hit it were small inde with onli three charg or rather three
cap left it wa necessari to be save
we halt and held a consult as a result of which we decid
that there wa no more danger in go on than in stand still or
attempt to return so we went on keep close togeth to me as
i wa the onli on with a rifl wa accord what i did not at all
appreci the honour of head the process
anoth halfmil and again we heard that strang roll sound which
wa produc i believ by the great brute beat upon it breast but
note that it wa not so continu as on the previou night
ha said han he can onli strike hi drum with on stick now your
bullet broke the other baa
a littl farther and the god roar quit close so loudli that the air
seem to trembl
the drum is all right whatev mai have happen to the stick i
said
a hundr yard or so more and the catastroph occur we had reach
a spot in the forest where on of the great tree had fallen down
let in a littl light i can see it to thi hour there lai the
enorm tree it bark cover with grei moss and clump of a giant
speci of maidenhair fern on our side of it wa the open space
which mai have measur forti feet across where the light fell in a
perpendicular rai as it doe through the smokehol of a hut look
at thi prostrat trunk i saw first two lurid and fieri ey that
glow red in the shadow and then almost in the same instant made
out what look like the head of a fiend enclos in a wreath of the
delic green fern i cant describ it i can onli repeat that it
look like the head of a veri larg fiend with a pallid face huge
overhang eyebrow and great yellow tush on either side of the
mouth
befor i had even time to get the rifl up with on terrif roar the
brute wa on us i saw it enorm grei shape on the top of the trunk
i saw it pass me like a flash run upright as a man doe but with
the head held forward and note that the arm nearest to me wa swing
as though broken then as i turn i heard a scream of terror and
perceiv that it had grip the poor mazitu jerri who walk last
but on of our line which wa end by mavovo ye it had grip him
and wa carri him off clasp to it breast with it sound arm
when i sai that jerri although a fullgrown man and rather inclin to
stout look like a child in that fell embrac it will give some
idea of the creatur size
mavovo who had the courag of a buffalo charg at it and drove the
copper spear he carri into it side thei all charg like berserk
except myself for even then thank heaven i knew a trick worth two of
that in three second there wa a struggl mass in the centr of the
clear brother john stephen mavovo and han were all stab at
the enorm gorilla for it wa a gorilla although their blow seem
to do it no more harm than pinprick fortun for them for it
part the beast would not let go of jerri and have onli on sound
arm could but snap at it assail for if it had lift a foot to
rend them it topheavi bulk would have caus it to tumbl over
at length it seem to realis thi and hurl jerri awai knock
down brother john and han with hi bodi then it leapt on mavovo who
see it come place the copper socket of the spear against hi own
breast with the result that when the gorilla tri to crush him the
point of the spear wa driven into it carcas feel the pain
it unwound it arm from about mavovo knock stephen over with the
backward sweep then it rais it great hand to crush mavovo with a
blow as i believ gorilla ar wont to do
thi wa the chanc for which i wa wait up till that moment i had
not dare to fire fear lest i should kill on of my companion now
for an instant it wa clear of them all and steadi myself i aim
at the huge head and let drive the smoke thin and through it i
saw the gigant ap stand quit still like a creatur lost in
medit
then it threw up it sound arm turn it fierc ey to the sky and
utter on piti and hideou howl sank down dead the bullet had
enter just behind the ear and buri itself in the brain
the great silenc of the forest flow in over us as it were for quit
a while no on did or said anyth then from somewher down amidst the
moss i heard a thin voic the sound of which remind me of air be
squeez out of an indiarubb cushion
veri good shot baa it pipe up as good as that which kill the
kingvultur at dingaan kraal and more difficult but if the baa
could pull the god off me i should saythank you
the thank you wa almost inaud and no wonder for poor han had
faint there he lai under the huge bulk of the gorilla just hi nose
and mouth appear between the brute bodi and it arm had it not
been for the soft cushion of wet moss in which he reclin i think that
he would have been crush flat
we roll the creatur off him somehow and pour a littl brandi down
hi throat which had a wonder effect for in less than a minut he
sat up grasp like a dy fish and ask for more
leav brother john to examin han to see if he wa realli injur
i bethought me of poor jerri and went to look at him on glanc wa
enough he wa quit dead inde he seem to be crush out of shape
like a buck that ha been envelop in the coil of a boaconstrictor
brother john told me afterward that both hi arm and nearli all
hi rib had been broken in that terribl embrac even hi spine wa
disloc
i have often wonder why the gorilla ran down the line without touch
me or the other to vent hi rage upon jerri i can onli suggest that
it wa becaus the unlucki mazitu had sat next to the kalubi on the
previou night which mai have caus the brute to identifi him by smell
with the priest whom he had learn to hate and kill it is true that
han had sat on the other side of the kalubi but perhap the odour of
the pongo had not clung to him so much or perhap it meant to deal with
him after it had done with jerri
when we knew that the mazitu wa past human help and had discov
to our joi that save for a few bruis no on els wa realli
hurt although stephen cloth were halftorn off him we made an
examin of the dead god truli it wa a fear creatur
what it exact weight or size mai have been we had no mean of
ascertain but i never saw or heard of such an enorm ap if a
gorilla is realli an ap it need the unit strength of the five of
us to lift the carcas with a great effort off the faint han and
even to roll it from side to side when subsequ we remov the skin
i would never have believ that so ancient an anim of it statur
which could not have been more than seven feet when it stood erect
could have been so heavi for ancient undoubtedli it wa the long
yellow canin tusk were worn halfawai with us the ey were sunken
far into the skull the hair of the head which i am told is gener
red or brown wa quit white and even the bare breast which should
be black wa grei in hue of cours it wa imposs to sai but on
might easili have imagin that thi creatur wa two hundr year or
more old as the motombo had declar it to be
stephen suggest that it should be skin and although i saw littl
prospect of our be abl to carri awai the hide i assent and help
in the oper on the mere chanc of save so great a curios
also although brother john wa restless and murmur someth about
wast time i thought it necessari that we should have a rest after
our fear anxieti and still more fear encount with thi
consecr monster so we set to work and as a result of more than an
hour toil drag off the hide which wa so tough and thick that
as we found the copper spear had scarc penetr to the flesh
the bullet that i had put into it on the previou night struck
we discov upon the bone of the upper arm which it shatter
suffici to render that limb useless if it did not break it
altogeth thi inde wa fortun for us for had the creatur
retain both it arm uninjur it would certainli have kill more
of us in it attack we were save onli by the fact that when it wa
hug jerri it had no limb left with which it could strike and
luckili did not succe in it attempt to get hold with it tremend
jaw that had nip off the kalubi hand as easili as a pair of
scissor sever the stalk of a flower
when the skin wa remov except that of the hand which we did not
attempt to touch we peg it out raw side uppermost to dry in the
centr of the open place where the sun struck then have buri poor
jerri in the hollow trunk of the great fallen tree we wash ourselv
with the wet moss and at some of the food that remain to us
after thi we start forward again in much better spirit jerri it
wa true wa dead but so wa the god leav us happili still aliv
and practic untouch never more would the kalubi of pongoland
shiver out their live at the feet of thi dread divin who soon or
late must becom their execution for i believ with the except of
two who commit suicid through fear that no kalubi wa ever known to
have di except by the handor teethof the god
what would i not give to know that brute histori could it possibl
as the motombo said have accompani the pongo peopl from their home
in western or central africa or perhap have been brought here by them
in a state of captiv i am unabl to answer the question but it
should be note that none of the mazitu or other nativ had ever heard
of the exist of more true gorilla in thi part of africa the
creatur if it had it origin in the local must either have been
solitari in it habit or driven awai from it fellow as sometim
happen to old eleph which then like thi gorilla becom
fearfulli feroci
that is all i can sai about the brute though of cours the pongo had
their own stori accord to them it wa an evil spirit in the shape
of an ap which evil spirit had onc inhabit the bodi of an earli
kalubi and had been annex by the ap when it kill the said kalubi
also thei declar that the reason the creatur put all the kalubi to
death as well as a number of other peopl who were offer up to it
wa that it need to refresh itself with the spirit of men by which
mean it wa enabl to avoid the effect of ag it will be rememb
that the motombo refer to thi belief of which afterward i heard
in more detail from babemba but if thi god had anyth supernatur
about it at least it magic wa no shield against a bullet from a
purdei rifl
onli a littl wai from the fallen tree we came suddenli upon a larg
clear which we guess at onc must be that garden of the god
where twice a year the unfortun kalubi were doom to scatter the
sacr seed it wa a larg garden sever acr of it ly on a
shelf as it were of the mountain and water by a stream maiz grew
in it also other sort of corn while all round wa a thick belt of
plantain tree of cours these crop had form the food of the god
who whenev it wa hungri came to thi place and help itself as we
could see by mani sign the garden wa well kept and compar free
from weed at first we wonder how thi could be till i rememb
that the kalubi or someon had told me that it wa tend by the
servant of the mother of the flower who were gener albino or
mute
we cross it and push on rapidli up the mountain onc more follow
an easi and wellbeaten path for now we saw that we were approach
what we thought must be the edg of a crater inde our excit wa
so extrem that we did not speak onli scrambl forward brother john
notwithstand hi lame leg lead at a greater pace than we could
equal he wa the first to reach our goal close follow by stephen
watch i saw him sink down as though in a swoon stephen also
appear astonish for he threw up hi hand
i rush to them and thi wa what i saw beneath us wa a steep slope
quit bare of forest which ceas at it crest thi slope stretch
downward for half a mile or more to the lip of a beauti lake of
which the area wa perhap two hundr acr set in the centr of
the deep blue water of thi lake which we discov afterward to
be unfathom wa an island not more than five and twenti or thirti
acr in extent that seem to be cultiv for on it we could see
field palm and other fruitbear tree in the middl of the island
stood a small near hous thatch after the fashion of the countri but
civil in it appear for it wa oblong not round and encircl
by a verandah and a reed fenc at a distanc from thi hous were a
number of nativ hut and in front of it a small enclosur surround
by a high wall on the top of which mat were fix on pole as though
to screen someth from wind or sun
the holi flower live there you bet gasp stephen excitedlyh
could think of noth but that confound orchid look the mat
ar up on the sunni side to prevent it scorch and those palm ar
plant round to give it shade
the mother of the flower live there whisper brother john point
to the hous who is she who is she suppos i should be mistaken
after all god let me not be mistaken for it would be more than i can
bear
we had better try to find out i remark practic though i am
sure i sympathis with hi suspens and start down the slope at a
run
in five minut or less we reach the foot of it and breathless and
perspir though we were began to search amongst the reed and bush
grow at the edg of the lake for the cano of which we had been told
by the kalubi what if there were none how could we cross that
wide stretch of deep water present han who follow certain
indic which caught hi practis ey had cast awai to the left
held up hi hand and whistl we ran to him
here it is baa he said and point to someth in a tini
bushfring inlet that at first sight look like a heap of dead
reed we tore awai at the reed and there sure enough wa a cano of
suffici size to hold twelv or fourteen peopl and in it a number of
paddl
anoth two minut and we were row across that lake
we came safe to the other side where we found a littl landingstag
made of pole sunk into the lake we ti up the cano or rather i did
for nobodi els rememb to take that precaut and present were
on a path which led through the cultiv field to the hous here i
insist upon go first with the rifl in case we should be suddenli
attack the silenc and the absenc of ani human be suggest to
me that thi might veri well happen sinc it would be strang if we had
not been seen cross the lake
afterward i discov why the place seem so desert it wa ow
to two reason first it wa now noontim an hour at which these poor
slave retir to their hut to eat and sleep through the heat of the
dai secondli although the watcher as she wa call had seen
the cano on the water she conclud that the kalubi wa visit the
mother of the flower and accord to practic on these occas
withdrew herself and everybodi els sinc the rare meet of the
kalubi and the mother of the flower partook of the natur of a religi
ceremoni and must be held in privat
first we came to the littl enclosur that wa plant about with palm
and as i have describ screen with mat stephen ran at it and
scrambl up the wall peep over the top
next instant he wa sit on the ground have descend from the
wall with the rapid of on shot through the head
oh by jingo he ejacul oh by jingo and that wa all i could
get out of him though it is true i did not try veri hard at the time
not five pace from thi enclosur stood a tall reed fenc that
surround the hous it had a gate also of reed which wa a littl
ajar creep up to it veri cautious for i thought i heard a voic
within i peep through the halfopen gate four or five feet awai
wa the verandah from which a doorwai led into on of the room of the
hous where stood a tabl on which wa food
kneel on mat upon thi verandah weretwo white womencloth in
garment of the purest white adorn with a purpl fring and wear
bracelet and other ornament of red nativ gold on of these appear
to be about forti year of ag she wa rather stout fair in colour
with blue ey and golden hair that hung down her back the other might
have been about twenti she also wa fair but her ey were grei and
her long hair wa of a chestnut hue i saw at onc that she wa tall and
veri beauti the elder woman wa prai while the other who knelt
by her side listen and look up vacantli at the sky
o god prai the woman for christ sake look in piti upon us two
poor captiv and if it be possibl send us deliver from thi
savag land we thank thee who hast protect us unharm and in health
for so mani year and we put our trust in thy merci for thou alon
canst help us grant o god that our dear husband and father mai still
live and that in thy good time we mai be reunit to him or if he be
dead and there is no hope for us upon the earth grant that we too mai
die and find him in thy heaven
thu she prai in a clear deliber voic and i notic that as she
did so the tear ran down her cheek amen she said at last and
the girl by her side speak with a strang littl accent echo the
amen
i look round at brother john he had heard someth and wa utterli
overcom fortun enough he could not move or even speak
hold him i whisper to stephen and mavovo while i go in and talk
to these ladi
then hand the rifl to han i took off my hat push the gate
a littl wider open slip through it and call attent to my
presenc by cough
the two women who had risen from their knee stare at me as though
thei saw a ghost
ladi i said bow prai do not be alarm you see god almighti

thank and for strength and wit to overcom the mani danger that
yet await us
chapter xvii
the home of the holi flower
half an hour or so pass dure which i wa engag altern in
think over our posit and in listen to stephen rhapsodi
first he dilat on the loveli of the holi flower that he had caught
a glimps of when he climb the wall and secondli on the beauti of
the ey of the young ladi in white onli by tell him that he might
offend her did i persuad him not to attempt to break into the sacr
enclosur where the orchid grew as we were discuss the point the
gate open and she appear
sir she said with a reverenti bow speak slowli and in
the drollest halt english the mother and the fathery the
fatherask will you feed
we intim that we would feed with much pleasur and she led the
wai to the hous sai
be not astonish at them for thei ar veri happi too and pleas
forgiv our unleaven bread
then in the politest wai possibl she took me by the hand and follow
by stephen we enter the hous leav mavovo and han to watch
outsid
it consist of but two room on for live and on for sleep in
the former we found brother john and hi wife seat on a kind of couch
gaze at each other in a rapt wai i note that thei both look as
though thei had been cryingwith happi i suppos
elizabeth said john as we enter thi is mr allan quatermain
through whose resourc and courag we have come togeth again and thi
young gentleman is hi companion mr stephen somer
she bow for she seem unabl to speak and held out her hand which
we shook
what be resourc and courag i heard her daughter whisper to
stephen and why have you none o stephen somer
it would take a long time to explain he said with hi jolli laugh
after which i listen to no more of their nonsens
then we sat down to the meal which consist of veget and a larg
bowl of hardboil duck egg of which eatabl an ampl suppli wa
carri out to han and mavovo by stephen and hope thi it seem wa
the name that her mother had given to the girl when she wa born in the
hour of her black despair
it wa an extraordinari stori that mr everslei had to tell and yet a
short on
she had escap from hassanbenmoham and the slavetrad as the
rescu slave told her husband at zanzibar befor he di and after
dai of wander been captur by some of the pongo who were scour
the countri upon dark busi of their own probabl in search of
captiv thei brought her across the lake to pongoland and the former
mother of the flower an albino have di at a great ag instal
her in the offic on thi island which from that dai she had never
left hither she wa led by the kalubi of the time and some other who
had pass the god thi brute howev she had never seen although
onc she heard him roar for it did not molest them or even appear upon
their journei
shortli after her arriv on the island her daughter wa born on which
occas some of the women servant of the flower nurs her from
that moment both she and the child were treat with the utmost care and
vener sinc the mother of the flower and the flower itself be
in some strang wai look upon as embodi of the natur forc of
fertil thi birth wa held to be the best of omen for the dwindl
pongo race also it wa hope that in due cours the child of the
flower would succe the mother in her offic so here thei dwelt
absolut helpless and alon occupi themselv with superintend
the agricultur of the island most fortun also when she wa
captur mr everslei had a small bibl in her possess which she
had never lost from thi she wa abl to teach her child to read and
all that is to be learn in the page of holi writ
often i have thought that if i were doom to solitari confin
for life and allow but on book i would choos the bibl sinc
in addit to all it histori and the splendour of it languag
it contain the record of the hope of man and therefor should be
suffici for him so at least it had prove to be in thi case
oddli enough as she told us like her husband mr everslei dure all
those endless year had never lost some kind of belief that she would
on dai be save otherwis than by death
i alwai thought that you still live and that we should meet again
john i heard her sai to him
also her own and her daughter spirit were mysteri support
for after the first shock and disturb of our arriv we found them
cheer peopl inde miss hope wa quit a merri soul but then
she had never known ani other life and human natur is veri adapt
further if i mai sai so she had grown up a ladi in the true sens of
the word after all why should she not see that her mother
the bibl and natur had been her onli associ and sourc of
inform if we except the poor slave who wait on them most of
whom were mute
when mr everslei stori wa done we told our in a compress form
it wa strang to see the wonder with which these two ladi listen to
it outlin but on that i need not dwell when it wa finish i heard
miss hope sai
so it would seem o stephen somer that it is you who ar saviour to
us
certainli answer stephen but why
becaus you see the dry holi flower far awai in england and you sai
i must be holi father to that flower then you pai down shekel here
her bibl read came in for the cost of journei and hire brave hunter
to kill devilgod and bring my old whitehead parent with you oh ye
you ar saviour and she nod her head at him veri prettili
of cours repli stephen with enthusiasm that is not exactli
but it is all the same thing as i will explain later but miss hope
meanwhil could you show us the flower
oh holi mother must do that if you look thereon without her you
die
realli said stephen without allud to hi littl feat of wall
climb
well the end of it wa that after a good deal of hesit the holi
mother oblig sai that as the god wa dead she suppos noth
els matter first howev she went to the back of the hous and
clap her hand whereon an old woman a mute and a veri perfect
specimen of an albino nativ appear and stare at us wonderingli
to her mr everslei talk upon her finger so rapidli that i could
scarc follow her movement the woman bow till her forehead nearli
touch the ground then rose and ran toward the water
i have sent her to fetch the paddl from the cano said mr
everslei and to put my mark upon it now none will dare to us it to
cross the lake
that is veri wise i repli as we dont want new of our
whereabout to get to the motombo
next we went to the enclosur where mr everslei with a nativ knife
cut a string of palm fibr that wa seal with clai on to the door
and on of it upright in such a fashion that none could enter without
break the string the impress wa made with a rude seal that she
wore round her neck as a badg of offic it wa a veri curiou object
fashion of gold and have deepli cut upon it face a rough imag of
an ap hold a flower in it right paw as it wa also ancient thi
seem to show that the monkei god and the orchid had been from the
begin jointli worship by the pongo
when she had open the door there appear grow in the centr of
the enclosur the most love plant i should imagin that man ever
saw it measur some eight feet across and the leav were dark green
long and narrow from it variou crown rose the scape of bloom and
oh those bloom of which there were about twelv expand now in the
flower season the measur made from the dri specimen i have
given alreadi so i need not repeat them i mai sai here howev that
the pongo augur the fertil or otherwis of each succeed year
from the number of the bloom on the holi flower if these were mani
the season would prove veri fruit if few less so while if as
sometim happen the plant fail to flower draught and famin were
alwai said to follow truli those were gloriou blossom stand as
high as a man with their back sheath of vivid white bar with black
their great pouch of burnish gold and their wide wing also of gold
then in the centr of each pouch appear the inkmark that did inde
exactli resembl the head of a monkei but if thi orchid astonish me
it effect upon stephen with whom thi class of flower wa a mania mai
be imagin realli he went almost mad for a long while he glare at
the plant and final flung himself upon hi knee caus miss hope
to exclaim
what o stephen somer do you also make sacrific to the holi flower
rather he answer ididdi for it
you ar like to befor all is done i remark with energi for i
hate to see a grown man make a fool of himself there onli on thing
in the world which justifi that and it isnt a flower
mavovo and han had follow us into the enclosur and i overheard a
convers between them which amus me the gist of it wa that han
explain to mavovo that the white peopl admir thi weedh call
it a weedbecaus it wa like gold which wa the god thei realli
worship although that god wa known among them by mani name
mavovo who wa not at all interest in the affair repli with a
shrug that it might be so though for hi part he believ the true
reason to be that the plant produc some medicin which gave courag or
strength zulu i mai sai do not care for flower unless thei bear a
fruit that is good to eat
when i had satisfi myself with the splendour of these magnific
bloom i ask mr everslei what certain littl mound might be that
were dot about the enclosur beyond the circl of cultiv peati
soil which surround the orchid root
thei ar the grave of the mother of the holi flower she answer
there ar twelv of them and here is the spot chosen for the
thirteenth which wa to have been mine
to chang the subject i ask anoth question name if there were
more such orchid grow in the countri
no she repli or at least i never heard of ani inde i have
alwai been told that thi on wa brought from far awai gener
ago also under an ancient law it is never allow to increas ani
shoot it send up beyond thi ring must be cut off by me and destroi
with certain ceremoni you see that seedpod which ha been left to
grow on the stalk of on of last year bloom it is now ripe and on
the night of the next new moon when the kalubi come to visit me
i must with much ritual burn it in hi presenc unless it ha burst
befor he arriv in which case i must burn ani seedl that mai
spring up with almost the same ritual
i dont think the kalubi will come ani more at least not while you
ar here inde i am sure of it i said
as we were leav the place act on my gener principl of make
sure of anyth of valu when i get the chanc i broke off that ripe
seedpod which wa of the size of an orang no on wa look at the
time and as it went straight into my pocket no on miss it
then leav stephen and the young ladi to admir thi cypripediumor
each otherin the enclosur we three elder return to the hous to
discuss matter
john and mr everslei i said by heaven merci you ar reunit
after a terribl separ of over twenti year but what is to be
done now the god it is true is dead and therefor the passag of the
forest will be easi but beyond it is the water which we have no mean
of cross and beyond the water that old wizard the motombo sit in
the mouth of hi cave watch like a spider in it web and beyond
the motombo and hi cave ar komba the new kalubi and hi tribe of
cannib
cannib interrupt mr everslei i never knew that thei were
cannib inde i know littl about the pongo whom i scarc ever
see
then madam you must take my word for it that thei ar also as i
believ that thei have everi expect of eat us now as i
presum that you do not wish to spend the rest of your live which
would probabl be short upon thi island i want to ask how you propos
to escap safe out of the pongo countri
thei shook their head which were evid empti of idea onli john
stroke hi white beard and inquir mildli
what have you arrang allan my dear wife and i ar quit will to
leav the matter to you who ar so resourc
arrang i stutter realli john under ani other
circumst then after a moment reflect i call to han and
mavovo who came and squat down upon the verandah
now i said after i had put the case to them what have you
arrang be devoid of ani feasibl suggest i wish to pass on
that intoler respons
my father make a mock of us said mavovo solemnli can a rat in a
pit arrang how it is to get out with the dog that is wait at the
top so far we have come in safeti as the rat doe into the pit now i
see noth but death
that cheer i said your turn han
oh baa repli the hottentot for a while i grew clever again when
i thought of put the gun intombi into the bamboo but now my head
is like a rotten egg and when i try to shake wisdom out of it my brain
melt and wash from side to side like the stuff in the rotten egg
yet yet i have a thoughtlet us ask the missi her brain is young
and not tire it mai hit on someth to ask the baa stephen is no
good for alreadi he is lost in other thing and han grin feebli
more to give myself time than for ani other reason i call to miss
hope who had just emerg from the sacr enclosur with stephen and
put the riddl to her speak veri slowli and clearli so that she
might understand me to my surpris she answer at onc
what is a god o mr allen is it not more than man can a god be bound
in a pit for a thousand year like satan in bibl if a god want to
move see new countri and so on who can sai no
i dont quit understand i said to draw her out further although
in fact i had more than a glimmer of what she meant
o allan holi flower there a god and my mother priestess if holi
flower tire of thi land and want to grow somewher els why
priestess not carri it and go too
capit idea i said but you see miss hope there ar or were two
god on of which cannot travel
oh that veri easi too put skin of god of the wood on to thi man
and she point to han and who know differ thei like as two
brother alreadi onli he smaller
she got it by jingo she got it exclaim stephen in admir
what missi sai ask han suspici
i told him
oh baa exclaim han think of the smell insid of that god
skin when the sun shine on it also the god wa a veri big god and i
am small
then he turn and made a propos to mavovo explain that hi
statur wa much better suit to the job
first will i die answer the great zulu am i who have high blood
in my vein and who am a warrior to defil myself by wrap the skin
of a dead brute about me and appear as an ap befor men propos it to
me again spot snake and we shall quarrel
see here han i said mavovo is right he is a soldier and veri
strong in battl you also ar veri strong in your wit and by do
thi you will make fool of all the pongo also han it is better that
you should wear the skin of a gorilla for a few hour than that i your
master and all these should be kill
ye baa it is true baa though for myself i almost think that
like mavovo i would rather die yet it would be sweet to deceiv those
pongo onc again and baa i wont see you kill just to save myself
anoth bad smell or two so if you wish it i will becom a god
thu through the selfsacrific of that good fellow han who is the
real hero of thi histori that matter wa settl if anyth could
be look on as settl in our circumst then we arrang that
we would start upon our desper adventur at dawn on the follow
morn
meanwhil much remain to be done first mr everslei summon her
attend who to the number of twelv soon appear in front of
the verandah it wa veri sad to see these poor women all of whom were
albino and unpleas to look on while quit half appear to be deaf
and dumb to these speak as a priestess she explain that the god
who dwelt in the wood wa dead and that therefor she must take the
holi flower which wa call wife of the god and make report to the
motombo of thi dread catastroph meanwhil thei must remain on the
island and continu to cultiv the field
thi order threw the poor creatur who were evid much attach
to their mistress and her daughter into a great state of constern
the eldest of them all a tall thin old ladi with white wool and pink
ey who look as stephen said like an angora rabbit prostrat
herself and kiss the mother foot ask when she would return
sinc she and the daughter of the flower were all thei had to love
and without them thei would die of grief
suppress her evid emot as best she could the mother repli
that she did not know it depend on the will of heaven and the
motombo then to prevent further argument she bade them bring their
pick with which thei work the land also pole mat and
palmstr and help to dig up the holi flower thi wa done under
the superintend of stephen who here wa thoroughli in hi element
although the job prove far from easi also it wa sad for all these
women wept as thei work while some of them who were not dumb wail
aloud
even miss hope cri and i could see that her mother wa affect with
a kind of aw for twenti year she had been guardian of thi plant
which i think she had at last not unnatur come to look upon with
some of the same vener that wa felt for it by the whole pongo
peopl
i fear she said lest thi sacrileg should bring misfortun upon
us
but brother john who held veri definit view upon african
superstit quot the second command to her and she becam
silent
we got the thing up at last or most of it with a suffici of
earth to keep it aliv injur the root as littl as possibl in the
process underneath it at a depth of about three feet we found sever
thing on of these wa an ancient stone fetish that wa rude shape
to the like of a monkei and wore a gold crown thi object which
wa small i still have anoth wa a bed of charcoal and amongst the
charcoal were some partial burnt bone includ a skull that wa
veri littl injur thi mai have belong to a woman of a low type
perhap the first mother of the flower but it gener appear
remind me of that of a gorilla i regret that there wa neither time
nor light to enabl me to make a proper examin of these remain
which we found it imposs to bring awai
mr everslei told me afterward howev that the kalubi had a
tradit that the god onc possess a wife which di befor the pongo
migrat to their present home if so these mai have been the bone of
that wife when it wa final clear of the ground on which it had grown
for so mani gener the great plant wa lift on to a larg mat
and after it had been pack with wet moss by stephen in a most skil
wai for he wa a perfect artist at thi kind of work the mat wa
bound round the root in such a fashion that none of the content could
escap also each flower scape wa lash to a thin bamboo so as to
prevent it from break on the journei then the whole bundl wa
lift on to a kind of bamboo stretcher that we made and firmli secur
to it with palmfibr rope
by thi time it wa grow dark and all of us were tire
baa said han to me as we were return to the hous would it
not be well that mavovo and i should take some food and go sleep in the
cano these women will not hurt us there but if we do not i who have
been watch them fear lest in the night thei should make paddl of
stick and row across the lake to warn the pongo
although i did not like separ our small parti i thought the idea
so good that i consent to it and present han and mavovo arm
with spear and carri an ampl suppli of food depart to the lake
side
on more incid ha impress itself upon my memori in connect with
that night it wa the formal baptism of hope by her father i never saw
a more touch ceremoni but it is on that i need not describ
stephen and i slept in the enclosur by the pack flower which he
would not leav out of hi sight it wa as well that we did so sinc
about twelv oclock by the light of the moon i saw the door in the wall
open gentli and the head of some of the albino women appear through
the apertur doubtless thei had come to steal awai the holi plant thei
worship i sat up cough and lift the rifl whereon thei fled
and return no more
long befor dawn brother john hi wife and daughter were up and make
prepar for the march pack a suppli of food and so forth
inde we breakfast by moonlight and at the first break of dai
after brother john had first offer up a prayer for protect
depart on our journei
it wa a strang outset and i note that both mr everslei and
her daughter seem sad at bid goodby to the spot where thei had
dwelt in utter solitud and peac for so mani year where on of them
inde had been born and grown up to womanhood howev i kept on
talk to distract their thought and at last we were off
i arrang that although it wa heavi for them the two ladi whose
white robe were cover with curiou cloak made of soft prepar bark
should carri the plant as far as the cano think it wa better that
the holi flower should appear to depart in charg of it consecr
guardian i went ahead with the rifl then came the stretcher and the
flower while brother john and stephen carri the paddl brought up
the rear we reach the cano without accid and to our great relief
found mavovo and han await us i learn howev that it wa
fortun thei had slept in the boat sinc dure the night the albino
women arriv with the evid object of possess themselv of it
and onli ran awai when thei saw that it wa guard as we were make
readi the cano those unhappi slave appear in a bodi and throw
themselv upon their face with piteou word or those of them who
could not speak by sign implor the mother not to desert them till
both she and hope began to cry but there wa no help for it so we
push off as quickli as we could leav the albino weep and
wail upon the bank
i confess that i too felt compunct at abandon them thu but
what could we do i onli trust that no harm came to them but of cours
we never heard anyth as to their fate
on the further side of the lake we hid awai the cano in the bush
where we had found it and began our march stephen and mavovo be
the two strongest among us now carri the plant and although stephen
never murmur at it weight how the zulu did swear after the first few
hour i could fill a page with hi objurg at what he consid
an act of insan and if i had space should like to do so for realli
some of them were most amus had it not been for hi friendship for
stephen i think that he would have thrown it down
we cross the garden of the god where mr everslei told me the kalubi
must scatter the sacr seed twice a year thu confirm the stori
that we had heard it seem that it wa then as he made hi long
journei through the forest that the treacher and horrid brute which
we had kill would attack the priest of whom it had grown weari but
and thi show the anim cun the onslaught alwai took place
after he had sown the seed which would in due season produc the food
it at our kalubi it is true wa kill befor we had reach the
garden which seem an except to the rule perhap howev the
gorilla knew that hi object in visit it wa not to provid for it
need or perhap our presenc excit it to immedi action
who can analys the motiv of a gorilla
these attack were gener spread over a year and a half on the first
occas the god which alwai accompani the priest to the garden and
back again would show animos by roar at him on the second he
would seiz hi hand and bite off on of the finger as happen to our
kalubi a wound that gener caus death from blood poison if
howev the priest surviv on the third visit it kill him for the
most part by crush hi head in it mighti jaw when make these
visit the kalubi wa accompani by certain dedic youth some of
whom the god alwai put to death those who had made the journei six
time without molest were select for further special trial
until at last onli two remain who were declar to have pass or
been accept by the god these youth were treat with great honour
as in the instanc of komba and on the destruct of the kalubi on of
them took hi offic which he gener fill without much accid
for a minimum of ten year and perhap much longer
mr everslei knew noth of the sacrament eat of the remain of
the kalubi or of the final burial of hi bone in the wooden coffin
that we had seen for such thing although thei undoubtedli happen
were kept from her she ad that each of the three kalubi whom she
had known ultim went almost mad through terror at hi approach
end especi after the preliminari roar and the bite off of the
finger in truth uneasi lai the head that wore a crown in pongoland
a crown that mind you might not be refus upon pain of death by
tortur person i can imagin noth more terribl than the
haunt exist of these poor king whose pomp and power must
termin in such a fashion
i ask her whether the motombo ever visit the god she answer ye
onc in everi five year then after mani mystic ceremoni he spent a
week in the forest at a time of full moon on of the kalubi had told
her that on thi occas he had seen the motombo and the god sit
togeth under a tree each with hi arm round the other neck and
appar talk like brother with the except of certain tale
of it almost supernatur cun thi wa all that i could learn
about the god of the pongo which i have sometim been tempt to
believ wa realli a devil hid in the bodi of a huge and ancient ap
no there wa on more thing which i quot becaus it bear out
babemba stori it seem that captiv from other tribe were sometim
turn into the forest that the god might amus itself by kill them
thi inde wa the fate to which we ourselv had been doom in
accord with the hate pongo custom
certainli thought i to myself when she had done i did a good deed in
send that monster to whatev dim region it wa destin to inhabit
where i sincer trust it found all the dead kalubi and it other
victim readi to give it an appropri welcom
after cross the god garden we came to the clear of the fallen
tree and found the brute skin peg out as we had left it though
shrunken in size onli it had evid been visit by a hord of the
forest ant which fortun for han had eaten awai everi particl
of flesh while leav the hide itself absolut untouch i suppos
becaus it wa too tough for them i never saw a neater job moreov
these industri littl creatur had devour the beast itself
noth remain of it except the clean white bone ly in the exact
posit in which we had left the carcas atom by atom that march
myriad armi had eaten all and depart on it wai into the depth of the
forest leav thi sign of their passag
how i wish that we could carri off the huge skeleton to add to my
collect of trophi but thi wa imposs as brother john said
ani museum would have been glad to purchas it for hundr of pound
for i do not suppos that it like exist in the world but it wa too
heavi all i could do wa to impress it peculiar upon my mind by
a close studi of the mighti bone also i pick out of the upper right
arm and kept the bullet i had fire when it carri off the kalubi
thi i found had sunk into and shatter the bone but without
absolut break it
on we went again bear with us the god skin have first stuf
the head hand and feet these i mean the hand and feet had been
clean out by the ant with wet moss in order to preserv their shape
it wa no light burden at least so declar brother john and han who
bore it between them upon a dead bough from the fallen tree
of the rest of our journei to the water edg there is noth to tell
except that notwithstand our load we found it easier to walk down
that steep mountain side than it had been to ascend the same still our
progress wa but slow and when at length we reach the buryingplac
onli about an hour remain to sunset there we sat down to rest and
eat also to discuss the situat
what wa to be done the arm of stagnant water lai near to us but we
had no boat with which to cross to the further shore and what wa that
shore a cave where a creatur who seem to be but halfhuman sat
watch like a spider in it web do not let it be suppos that thi
question of escap had been absent from our mind on the contrari we
had even thought of try to drag the cano in which we cross to
and from the island of the flower through the forest the idea wa
abandon howev becaus we found that be hollow from a singl
log with a bottom four or five inch thick it wa imposs for us to
carri it so much as fifti yard what then could we do without a boat
swim seem to be out of the question becaus of the crocodil
also on inquiri i discov that of the whole parti stephen and i alon
could swim further there wa no wood of which to make a raft
i call to han and leav the rest in the graveyard where we knew
that thei were safe we went down to the edg of the water to studi the
situat be care to keep ourselv hidden behind the reed and
bush of the mangrov tribe with which it wa fring not that there
wa much fear of our be seen for the dai which had been veri hot
wa close in and a great storm herald by black and belli
cloud wa gather fast condit which must render us practic
invis at a distanc
we look at the dark slimi wateralso at the crocodil which
sat upon it edg in dozen wait etern wait for what i
wonder we look at the sheer oppos cliff but save where a black
hole mark the cave mouth far as the ey could see the water came
up against it as that of a moat doe against the wall of a castl
obvious therefor the onli line of escap ran through thi cave
for as i have explain the channel by which i presum babemba reach
the open lake wa now impractic lastli we search to see if
there wa ani fallen log upon which we could possibl propel ourselv
to the other side and foundnoth that could be made to serv no
nor as i have said ani dry reed or brushwood out of which we might
fashion a raft
unless we can get a boat here we must stai i remark to han who
wa seat with me behind a screen of rush at the water edg
he made no answer and as i thought in a sort of subconsci wai
i engag myself in watch a certain tragedi of the insect world
between two stout reed a forest spider of the veri largest sort had
spun a web as big as a ladi open parasol there in the midst of thi
web of which the bottom strand almost touch the water sat the spider
wait for it prei as the crocodil were wait on the bank as
the great ap had wait for the kalubi as death wait for life as
the motombo wa wait for god know what
it rather resembl the motombo in hi cave did that huge black
spider with just a littl patch of white upon it head or so i thought
fancifulli enough then came the tragedi a great white moth of the
hawk speci began to dart to and fro between the reed and present
struck the web on it lower side some three inch abov the water like
a flash that spider wa upon it it embrac the victim with it long
leg to still it tremend battl next descend below it began
to make the bodi fast when someth happen from the still surfac
of the water beneath poke up the mouth of a veri larg fish which quit
quietli close upon the spider and sank again into the depth take
with it a portion of the web and therebi set the big moth free
with a struggl it loos itself fell on to a piec of wood and float
awai appar littl the wors for the encount
did you see that baa said han point to the broken and empti
web while you were think i wa prai to your reverend father the
predik who taught me how to do it and he ha sent us a sign from
the place of fire
even then i could not help laugh to myself as i pictur what my
dear father face would be like if he were abl to hear hi convert
remark an analysi of hanss religi view would be realli
interest and i onli regret that i never made on but stick to
busi i mere ask
what sign
baa thi sign that web is the motombo cave the big spider is the
motombo the white moth is us baa who ar caught in the web and go
to be eaten
veri pretti han i said but what is the fish that came up and
swallow the spider so that the moth fell on the wood and float
awai
baa you ar the fish who come up softli softli out of the water
in the dark and shoot the motombo with the littl rifl and then the
rest of us who ar the moth fall into the cano and float awai there
is a storm about to break baa and who will see you swim the stream in
the storm and the night
the crocodil i suggest
baa i didnt see a crocodil eat the fish i think the fish is
laugh down there with the fat spider in it stomach also when
there is a storm crocodil go to bed becaus thei ar afraid lest the
lightn should kill them for their sin
now i rememb that i had often heard and inde to some extent
note that these great reptil do vanish in disturb weather
probabl becaus their food hide awai howev that might be in an
instant i made up my mind
as soon as it wa quit dark i would swim the water hold the littl
rifl intombi abov my head and try to steal the cano if the old
wizard wa watch which i hope might not be the case well i
must deal with him as best i could i knew the desper natur of the
expedi but there wa no other wai if we could not get a boat we
must remain in that foodless forest until we starv or if we return
to the island of the flower there er long we should certainli be
attack and destroi by komba and the pongo when thei came to look
for our bodi
ill try it han i said
ye baa i thought you would id come too onli i cant swim and
when i wa drown i might make a nois becaus on forget oneself
then baa but it will be all right for if it were otherwis i am sure
that your reverend father would have shown us so in the sign the moth
float off quit comfort on the wood and just now i saw it spread
it wing and fly awai and the fish ah how he laugh with that fat
old spider in hi stomach
chapter xviii
fate stab
we went back to the other whom we found crouch on the ground among
the coffin look distinctli depress no wonder night wa close
in the thunder wa begin to growl and echo through the forest and
rain to fall in big drop in short although stephen remark that
everi cloud ha a silver line a proverb which as i told him i
seem to have heard befor in no sens could the outlook be consid
bright
well allan what have you arrang ask brother john with a faint
attempt at cheer as he let go of hi wife hand in those dai
he alwai seem to be hold hi wife hand
oh i answer i am go to get the cano so that we can all row
over comfort
thei stare at me and miss hope who wa seat by stephen ask in
her usual biblic languag
have you the wing of a dove that you can fly o mr allan
no i answer but i have the fin of a fish or someth like
them and i can swim
now there aros a choru of expostul
you shant risk it said stephen i can swim as well as you and im
younger ill go i want a bath
that you will have o stephen interrupt miss hope as i thought in
some alarm the latter rain from heaven will make you clean by now
it wa pour
ye stephen you can swim i said but you will forgiv me for
sai that you ar not particularli deadli with a rifl and clean
shoot mai be the essenc of thi busi now listen to me all of
you i am go i hope that i shall succe but if i fail it doe not
so veri much matter for you will be no wors off than you were befor
there ar three pair of you john and hi wife stephen and miss hope
mavovo and han if the odd man of the parti come to grief you will
have to choos a new captain that is all but while i lead i mean to be
obei
then mavovo to whom han had been talk spoke
my father macumazana is a brave man if he live he will have done hi
duti if he di he will have done hi duti still better and on the
earth or in the underworld among the spirit of our father hi name
shall be great for ever ye hi name shall be a song
when brother john had translat these word which i thought fine
there wa silenc
now i said come with me to the water edg all of you you will
be in less danger from the lightn there where ar no tall tree
and while i am gone do you ladi dress up han in that gorillaskin
as best you can lace it on to him with some of that palmfibr string
which we brought with us and fill out the hollow and the head with
leav or reed i want him to be readi when i come back with the cano
han groan audibl but made no object and we start with our
impedimenta down to the edg of the estuari where we hid behind a clump
of mangrov bush and tall featheri reed then i took off some of my
cloth strip in fact to my flannel shirt and the cotton pant i
wore both of which were grei in colour and therefor almost invis
at night
now i wa readi and han hand me the littl rifl
it is at full cock baa with the catch on he said and carefulli
load also i have wrap the line of my hat which is veri full of
greas for the hair make greas especi in hot weather baa round
the lock to keep awai the wet from the cap and powder it is not ti
baa onli twist give the rifl a shake and it will fall off
i understand i said and grip the gun with my left hand by the
tongu just forward of the hammer in such a fashion that the horrid
greas rag from hanss hat wa held tight over the lock and cap then
i shook hand with the other and when i came to miss hope i am proud to
add that she spontan and of her own accord imprint a kiss upon
my mediaev brow i felt inclin to return it but did not
it is the kiss of peac o allan she said mai you go and return in
peac
thank you i said but get on with dress han in hi new cloth
stephen mutter someth about feel asham of himself brother
john put up a vigor and welldirect prayer mavovo salut with the
copper assegai and began to give me sibonga or zulu titl of prais
beneath hi breath and mr everslei said
oh i thank god that i have live to see a brave english gentleman
again which i thought a great compliment to my nation and myself
though when i afterward discov that she herself wa english by
birth it took off some of the polish
next just after a vivid flash of lightn for the storm had broken in
earnest now i ran swiftli to the water edg accompani by han who
wa determin to see the last of me
get back han befor the lightn show you i said as i slid
gentli from a mangroveroot into that filthi stream and tell them to
keep my coat and trouser dry if thei can
goodby baa he murmur and i heard that he wa sob keep a
good heart o baa of baas after all thi is noth to the vultur
of the hill of slaughter intombi pull us through then and so she
will again for she know who can hold her straight
that wa the last i heard of han for if he said ani more the hiss of
the torrenti rain smother hi word
oh i had tri to keep a good heart befor the other but it is
beyond my power to describ the deadli fright i felt perhap the worst
of all my life which is sai a great deal here i wa start on on
of the maddest ventur that wa ever undertaken by man i neednt put
it point again but that which appeal to me most at the moment
wa the crocodil i have alwai hate crocodil sincewel never
mindand the place wa as full of them as the pond at ascens ar of
turtl
still i swam on the estuari wa perhap two hundr yard wide not
more no great distanc for a good swimmer as i wa in those dai but
then i had to hold the rifl abov the water with my left hand at
all cost for if onc it went beneath it would be useless also i wa
desper afraid of be seen in the lightn flash although to
minimis thi risk i had kept my darkcolour cloth hat upon my head
lastli there wa the lightn itself to fear for it wa fear and
continu and seem to be strike along the water it wa a fact that
a firebal or someth of the sort hit the surfac within a few yard
of me as though it had aim at the riflebarrel and just miss or so
i thought though it mai have been a crocodil rise at the moment
in on wai or rather in two howev i wa lucki the first wa the
complet absenc of wind which must have rais wave that might have
swamp me and would at ani rate have wet the rifl the second wa
that there wa no fear of my lose my path for in the mouth of the cave
i could see the glow of the fire which burn on either side of the
motombo seat thei serv the same purpos to me as did the lamp of
the ladi call hero to her lover leander when he swam the hellespont
to pai her clandestin visit at night but he had someth pleasant to
look forward to wherea i still there wa anoth point in common
between us hero if i rememb right wa a priestess of the greek
goddess of love wherea the parti who wait me wa also in a religi
line of busi onli as i firmli believ he wa a priest of the
devil
i suppos that swim took me about a quarterofanhour for i went
slowli to save my strength although the crocodil suggest hast but
thank heaven thei never appear to complic matter now i wa quit
near the cave and now i wa beneath the overhang roof and in the
shallow water of the littl bai that form a harbour for the cano i
stood upon my feet on the rock bottom the water come up to my breast
and peer about me while i rest and work my left arm stiff with
the uphold of the gun to and fro the fire had burnt somewhat low
and until my ey were freed from the raindrop and grew accustom to
the light of the place i could not see clearli
i took the rag from round the lock of the rifl wipe the wet off the
barrel with it and let it fall then i loos the catch and by touch
a certain mechan made the rifl hairtrigg now i look again
and began to make out thing there wa the platform and there ala on
it sat the toadlik motombo but hi back wa to me he wa gaze
not toward the water but down the cave i hesit for on fate
moment perhap the priest wa asleep perhap i could get the cano
awai without shoot i did not like the job moreov hi head wa
held forward and invis and how wa i to make certain of kill him
with a shot in the back lastli if possibl i wish to avoid fire
becaus of the report
at that instant the motombo wheel round some instinct must have
warn him of my presenc for the silenc wa gravelik save for the
soft splash of the rain without as he turn the lightn blaze and
he saw me
it is the white man he mutter to himself in hi hiss whisper
while i wait through the follow dark with the rifl at my
shoulder the white man who shot me long long ago and again he ha a
gun oh fate stab doubtless the god is dead and i too must die
then as if some doubt struck him he lift the horn to summon help
again the lightn flash and wa accompani by a fear crack of
thunder with a prayer for skill i cover hi head and fire by the
glare of it just as the trumpet touch hi lip it fell from hi hand
he seem to shrink togeth and move no more
oh thank god thank god in thi suprem moment of trial the art of
which i am a master had not fail me if my hand had shaken ever so
littl if my nerv strain to break point had plai me fals
in the least degre if the rag from hanss hat had not suffic to keep
awai the damp from the cap and powder well thi histori would never
have been written and there would have been some more bone in the
graveyard of the kalubi that is all
for a moment i wait expect to see the women attend dart from
the doorwai in the side of the cave and to hear them sound a shrill
alarm none appear and i guess that the rattl of the thunder had
swallow up the crack of the rifl a nois be it rememb that
none of them had ever heard for an unknown number of year thi ancient
creatur i suppos had squat dai and night upon that platform
whenc i daresai it wa difficult for him to move so after thei had
wrap hi fur round him at sunset and made up the fire to keep him
warm why should hi women come to disturb him unless he call them
with hi horn probabl it wa not even law that thei should do so
somewhat reassur i wade forward a few pace and loos the cano
which wa ti by the prow then i scrambl into it and lai down
the rifl took on of the paddl and began to push out of the creek
just then the lightn flare onc more and by it i caught sight of
the motombo face that wa now within a few feet of my own it seem
to be rest almost on hi knee and it appear wa dread in
the centr of the forehead wa a blue mark where the bullet had enter
for i had made no mistak in that matter the deepset round ey were
open and all their fire gone seem to stare at me from beneath the
overhang brow the massiv jaw had fallen and the red tongu hung
out upon the pendul lip the leatherlik skin of the bloat cheek
had assum an ashen hue still streak and mottl with brown
oh the thing wa horribl and sometim when i am out of sort it
haunt me to thi dai yet that creatur blood doe not lie heavi on
my mind of it my conscienc is not afraid hi end wa necessari to
save the innoc and i am sure that it wa well deserv for he wa a
devil akin to the great god ap i had slain in the forest to whom by
the wai he bore a most remark resembl in death inde if their
head had been laid side by side at a littl distanc it would not have
been too easi to tell them apart with their project brow beardless
retreat chin and yellow tush at the corner of the mouth
present i wa clear of the cave still for a while i lai to at on
side of it against the tower cliff both to listen in case what i
had done should be discov and for fear lest the lightn which wa
still bright although the storm centr wa rapidli pass awai should
reveal me to ani watcher
for quit ten minut i hid thu and then determin to risk it
paddl softli toward the opposit bank keep howev a littl
to the west of the cave and take my line by a certain veri tall tree
which as i had note tower up against the sky at the back of the
graveyard
as it happen my calcul were accur and in the end i direct
the bow of the cano into the rush behind which i had left my
companion just then the moon began to struggl out through the
thin raincloud and by it light thei saw me and i saw what for
a moment i took to be the gorillagod himself waddl forward to seiz
the boat there wa the dread brute exactli as he had appear in the
forest except that it seem a littl smaller
then i rememb and laugh and that laugh did me a world of good
is that you baa said a muffl voic speak appar from the
middl of the gorilla ar you safe baa
of cours i answer or how should i be here ad cheerfulli
ar you comfort in that nice warm skin on thi wet night han
oh baa answer the voic tell me what happen even in thi
stink i burn to know
death happen to the motombo han here stephen give me your hand
and my cloth and mavovo hold the rifl and the cano while i put
them on
then i land and step into the reed pull off my wet shirt and
pant which i stuf awai into the big pocket of my shoot coat
for i did not want to lose them and put on the dry thing that
although scratchi were quit good enough cloth in that warm climat
after thi i treat myself to a good sup of brandi from the flask and
at some food which i seem to requir then i told them the stori and
cut short their demonstr of wonder and admir bade them
place the holi flower in the cano and get in themselv next with the
help of han who poke out hi finger through the skin of the gorilla
arm i carefulli reload the rifl set the last cap on the
nippl thi done i join them in the cano take my seat in the
prow and bid brother john and stephen paddl
make a circuit to avoid observ as befor in a veri short time
we reach the mouth of the cave i leant forward and peep round the
western wall of rock nobodi seem to be stir there the fire
burn dimli there the huddl shape of the motombo still crouch
upon the platform silent silent we disembark and i form our
process while the other look askanc at the horribl face of the
dead motombo
i head it then came the mother of the flower follow by han
plai hi part of the god of the forest then brother john and stephen
carri the holi flower after it walk hope while mavovo brought up
the rear near to on of the fire as i had note on our first passag
of the cave lai a pile of the torch which i have alreadi mention
we lit some of them and at a sign from me mavovo drag the cano
back into it littl dock and ti the cord to it post it appear
there appar undisturb might i thought make our cross of
the water seem even more mysteri all thi while i watch the door
in the side of the cave expect everi moment to see the women rush
out but none came perhap thei slept or perhap thei were absent i
do not know to thi dai
we start and in solemn silenc thread our wai down the wind
of the cave extinguish our torch as soon as we saw light at it
inland outlet at a few pace from it mouth stood a sentri hi
back wa toward the cave and in the uncertain gleam of the moon
struggl with the cloud for a thin rain still fell he never note
us till we were right on to him then he turn and saw and at the
aw sight of thi process of the god of hi land threw up hi
arm and without a word fell senseless although i never ask i think
that mavovo took measur to prevent hi awaken at ani rate when i
look back later on i observ that he wa carri a big pongo spear
with a long shaft instead of the copper weapon which he had taken from
on of the coffin
on we march toward rica town follow the easi path by which we had
come as i have said the countri wa veri desert and the inhabit
of such hut as we pass were evid fast asleep also there were no
dog in thi land to awak them with their bark between the cave and
rica we were not i think seen by a singl soul
through that long night we push on as fast wa we could travel onli
stop now and again for a few minut to rest the bearer of the holi
flower inde at time mr everslei reliev her husband at thi
task but stephen be veri strong carri hi end of the stretcher
throughout the whole journei
han of cours wa much oppress by the great weight of the gorilla
skin which although it had shrunk a good deal remain as heavi as
ever but he wa a tough old fellow and on the whole got on better than
might have been expect though by the time we reach the town he
wa sometim oblig to follow the exampl of the god itself and
help himself forward with hi hand go on all four as a gorilla
gener doe
we reach the broad long street of rica about half an hour befor
dawn and proceed down it till we were past the feasthous still
quit unobserv for as yet none were stir on that wet morn
inde it wa not until we were within a hundr yard of the harbour
that a woman possess of the virtu or vice of earli rise who
had come from a hut to work in her garden saw us and rais an aw
pierc scream
the god she scream the god ar leav the land and take the
white men with them
instantli there aros a hubbub in the hous head were thrust out of
the door and peopl ran into the garden everi on of whom began to
yell till on might have thought that a massacr wa in progress but as
yet no on came near us for thei were afraid
push on i cri or all is lost
thei answer nobli han struggl forward on all four for he wa
nearli done and hi hideou garment wa choke him while stephen and
brother john exhaust though thei were with the weight of the great
plant actual broke into a feebl trot we came to the harbour and
there ti to the wharf wa the same cano in which we had cross
to pongoland we sprang into it and cut the fasten with my knife
have no time to unti them and push off from the wharf
by now hundr of peopl among them mani soldier were hard upon and
inde around us but still thei seem too frighten to do anyth
so far the inspir of han disguis had save us in the midst of
them by the light of the rise sun i recognis komba who ran up a
great spear in hi hand and for a moment halt amaz
then it wa that the catastroph happen which nearli cost us all our
live
han who wa in the stern of the cano began to faint from exhaust
and in hi effort to obtain air for the heat and stench of the skin
were overpow him thrust hi head out through the lace of the
hide beneath the reedstuf mask of the gorilla which fell over
languidli upon hi shoulder komba saw hi ugli littl face and knew it
again
it is a trick he roar these white devil have kill the god and
stolen the holi flower and it priestess the yellow man is wrap in
the skin of the god to the boat to the boat
paddl i shout to brother john and stephen paddl for your live
mavovo help me get up the sail
as it chanc on that stormi morn the wind wa blow strongli
toward the mainland
we labour at the mast ship it and haul up the mat sail but
slowli for we were awkward at the busi by the time that it began
to draw the paddl had propel us about four hundr yard from the
wharf whenc mani cano with their sail alreadi set were start
in pursuit stand in the prow of the first of these and roar
curs and vengeanc at us wa komba the new kalubi who shook a great
spear abov hi head
an idea occur to me who knew that unless someth were done we
must be overtaken and kill by these skill boatmen leav mavovo
to attend to the sail i scrambl aft and thrust asid the faint
han knelt down in the stern of the cano there wa still on charg
or rather on cap left and i meant to us it i put up the largest
flapsight lift the littl rifl and cover komba aim at the
point of hi chin intombi wa not sight for or meant to us at thi
great distanc and onli by thi mean of allow for the drop of the
bullet could i hope to hit the man in the bodi
the sail wa draw well now and steadi the boat also be still
under the shelter of the land the water wa smooth as that of a pond
so realli i had a veri good fire platform moreov weari though i
wa my vital forc rose to the emerg and i felt myself grow rigid
as a statu lastli the light wa good for the sun rose behind me it
level rai shine full on to my mark i held my breath and touch the
trigger the charg explod sweetli and almost at the instant as
the smoke drift to on side i saw komba throw up hi arm and fall
backward into the cano then quit a long while afterward or so it
seem the breez brought the faint sound of the thud of that fate
bullet to our ear
though perhap i ought not to sai so it wa realli a wonder shot
in all the circumst for as i learn afterward the ball struck
just where i hope that it might in the centr of the breast pierc
the heart inde take everyth into consider i think that
those four shot which i fire in pongoland ar the real record of my
career as a marksman the first at night broke the arm of the gorilla
god and would have kill him had not the charg hung fire and given
him time to protect hi head the second did kill him in the midst of
a great scrimmag when everyth wa move the third fire by the
glare of lightn after a long swim slew the motombo and the fourth
loos at thi great distanc from a move boat wa the bane of that
coldblood and treacher man komba who thought that he had trap
us to pongoland to be murder and eaten as a sacrific lastli there
wa alwai the conscious that no mistak must be made sinc with
but four percuss cap it could not be retriev
i am sure that i could not have done so well with ani other rifl
howev modern and accur it might be but to thi littl purdei
weapon i had been accustom from my youth and that as ani marksman
will know mean a great deal i seem to know it and it seem to know
me it hang on my wall to thi dai although of cours i never us it
now in our breechload era unfortun howev a local gunsmith
to whom i sent it to have the lock clean rebrown it and scrape
and varnish the stock etc without author make it look almost
new again i prefer it in it worn and scratch condit
to return the sound of the shot like that of john peel horn arous
han from hi sleep he thrust hi head between my leg and saw komba
fall
oh beauti baa beauti he said faintli i am sure that the
ghost of your reverend father cannot kill hi enemi more nice down
there among the fire beauti and the silli old fellow fell to
kiss my boot or what remain of them after which i gave him the
last of the brandi
thi quit brought him to himself again especi when he wa free
from that filthi skin and had wash hi head and hand
the effect of the death of komba upon the pongo wa veri strang all
the other cano cluster round that in which he lai then after a
hurri consult thei haul down their sail and paddl back to
the wharf why thei did thi i cannot tell perhap thei thought that
he wa bewitch or onli wound and requir the attent of a
medicineman perhap it wa not law for them to proce except under
the guidanc of some reserv kalubi who had pass the god and who wa
on shore perhap it wa necessari accord to their rite that the
bodi of their chief should be land with certain ceremoni i do not
know it is imposs to be sure as to the mysteri motiv that
actuat mani of these remot african tribe
at ani rate the result wa that it gave us a great start and a chanc
of life who must otherwis have di upon the spot outsid the bai the
breez blew merrili take us across the lake at a spank pace until
about middai when it began to fall fortun howev it did
not altogeth drop till three oclock by which time the coast of
mazituland wa compar near we could even distinguish a speck
against the skylin which we knew wa the union jack that stephen had
set upon the crest of a littl hill
dure those hour of peac we at the food that remain to us wash
ourselv as thoroughli as we could and rest well wa it in view of
what follow that we had thi time of repos for just as the breez
wa fail i look aft and there come up behind us still hold
the wind wa the whole fleet of pongo cano thirti or forti of them
perhap each carri an averag of about twenti men we sail on
for as long as we could for though our progress wa but slow it wa
quicker than what we could have made by paddl also it wa necessari
that we should save our strength for the last trial
i rememb that hour veri well for in the nervou excit of it
everi littl thing impress itself upon my mind i rememb even the
shape of the cloud that float over us remnant of the storm of the
previou night on wa like a castl with a brokendown turret show
a staircas within anoth had a fantast resembl to a wreck
ship with a hole in her starboard bow two of her mast broken and on
stand with some fragment of sail flap from it and so forth
then there wa the gener aspect of the great lake especi at a
spot where two current met caus littl wave which seem to fight
with each other and fall backward in curiou curv also there were
shoal of small fish someth like chub in shape with round mouth
and veri white stomach which suddenli appear upon the surfac
jump at invis fli these attract a number of bird that
resembl gull of a light build thei had coalblack head white
back greyish wing and slightli web feet pink as coral with
which thei seiz the small fish utter as thei did so a peculiar
and plaintiv cry that end in a longdrawn ee the father of the
flock whose head seem to be white like hi back perhap from ag
hung abov them not troubl to fish himself but from time to
time forc on of the compani to drop what he had caught which he
retriev befor it reach the water such ar some of the small thing
that come back to me though there were other too numer and trivial
to mention
when the breez fail us at last we were perhap someth over three
mile from the shore or rather from the great bed of reed which at
thi spot grow in the shallow off the mazitu coast to a breadth of
seven or eight hundr yard where the water becom too deep for them
the pongo were then about a mile and a half behind but as the wind
favour them for a few minut more and have plenti of hand thei
could help themselv on by paddl when at last it di to a complet
calm the distanc between us wa not more than on mile thi meant
that thei must cover four mile of water while we cover three
let down our now useless sail and throw it and the mast overboard
to lighten the cano sinc the sky show us that there wa no more
hope of wind we began to paddl as hard as we could fortun the
two ladi were abl to take their share in thi exercis sinc thei
had learn it upon the lake of the flower where it seem thei kept
a privat cano upon the other side of the island which wa us for
fish han who wa still weak we set to steer with a paddl aft
which he did in a somewhat errat fashion
a stern chase is proverbi a long chase but still the enemi with
their skill rower came up fast when we were a mile from the reed
thei were within half a mile of us and as we tire the proport of
distanc lessen when we were two hundr yard from the reed thei
were not more than fifti or sixti yard behind and then the real
struggl began
it wa short but terribl we threw everyth we could overboard
includ the ballast stone at the bottom of the cano and the heavi
hide of the gorilla thi as it prove wa fortun sinc the thing
sank but slowli and the foremost pongo boat halt a minut to recov
so preciou a relic check the other behind them a circumst
that help us by twenti or thirti yard
over with the plant i said
but stephen look quit old from exhaust and with the sweat
stream from him as he labour at hi unaccustom paddl gasp
for heaven sake no after all we have gone through to get it
so i didnt insist inde there wa neither time nor breath for
argument
now we were in the reed for thank to the flag which guid us we had
struck the big hippopotamu lane exactli and the pongo paddl
like demon were about thirti yard behind thank wa i that those
interest peopl had never learn the us of bow and arrow and
that their spear were too heavi to throw by now or rather some time
befor old babemba and the mazitu had seen us as had our zulu hunter
crowd of them were wade through the shallow toward us yell
encourag as thei came the zulu too open a rather wild fire
with the result that on of the bullet struck our cano and anoth
touch the brim of my hat a third howev kill a pongo which
caus some confus in the rank of tusculum
but we were done and thei came on remorselessli when their lead boat
wa not more than ten yard from us and we were perhap two hundr from
the shore i drove my paddl downward and find that the water wa
less than four feet deep shout
overboard all and wade it our last chanc
we scrambl out of that cano the prow of which as i left it the last
i push round across the waterlan to obstruct those of the pongo now
i think all would have gone well had it not been for stephen who after
he had flounder forward a few pace in the mud bethought him of hi
belov orchid not onli did he return to try to rescu it he also
actual persuad hi friend mavovo to accompani him thei got back to
the boat and began to lift the plant out when the pongo fell upon them
strike at them with their spear over the width of our cano mavovo
struck back with the weapon he had taken from the pongo sentri at the
cave mouth and kill or wound on of them then some on hurl
a ballast stone at him which caught him on the side of the head and
knock him down into the water whenc he rose and reel back almost
senseless till some of our peopl got hold of him and drag him to
the shore
so stephen wa left alon drag at the great orchid till a pongo
reach over the cano drove a spear through hi shoulder he let go of
the orchid becaus he must and tri to retreat too late half a dozen
or more of the pongo push themselv between the stern or bow of our
cano and the reed and wade forward to kill him i could not help
for to tell the truth at the moment i wa stuck in a mudhol made by
the hoof of a hippopotamu while the zulu hunter and the mazitu were
as yet too far off sure he must have di had it not been for the
courag of the girl hope who while wade shoreward a littl in front
of me had turn and seen hi plight back she came liter bound
through the water like a leopard whose cub ar in danger
reach stephen befor the pongo she thrust herself between him and
them and proceed to address them with the utmost vigour in their own
languag which of cours she had learn from those of the albino who
were not mute
what she said i could not exactli catch becaus of the shout of the
advanc mazitu i gather howev that she wa anathemat them
in the word of some old and potent curs that wa onli us by the
guardian of the holi flower which consign them bodi and spirit
to a dread doom the effect of thi maledict which by the wai
neither the young ladi nor her mother would repeat to me afterward wa
certainli remark those men who heard it among them the wouldb
slayer of stephen stai their hand and even inclin their head
toward the young priestess as though in rever or deprec and
thu remain for suffici time for her to lead the wound stephen
out of danger thi she did wade backward by hi side and keep her
ey fix full upon the pongo it wa perhap the most curiou rescu
that i ever saw
the holi flower i should add thei recaptur and carri off for i
saw it depart in on of their cano that wa the end of my orchid
hunt and of the monei which i hope to make by the sale of thi floral
treasur i wonder what becam of it i have good reason to believ that
it wa never replant on the island of the flower so perhap it wa
born back to the dim and unknown land in the depth of africa whenc
the pongo ar suppos to have brought it when thei migrat
after thi incid of the wound and the rescu of stephen by the
intrepid miss hope whose interest in him wa alreadi strong enough
to induc her to risk her life upon hi behalf all we fugit were
drag ashor somehow by our friend here han i and the ladi
collaps exhaust though brother john still found suffici strength
to do what he could for the injur stephen and mavovo
then the battl of the reed began and a fierc frai it wa the pongo
who were about equal in number to our peopl came on furious for
thei were mad at the death of their god with hi priest the motombo
of which i think new had reach them and at the carri off of the
mother of the flower spring from their cano becaus the waterwai
wa too narrow for more than on of these to travel at a time thei
plung into the reed with the intent of wade ashor here their
hereditari enemi the mazitu attack them under the command of old
babemba the struggl that ensu partook more of the natur of a seri
of handtohand fight than of a set battl it wa extraordinari to see
the head of the combat move among the reed as thei stab at
each other with the great spear till on went down there were few
wound in that frai for those who fell sank in the mud and water and
were drown
on the whole the pongo who were oper in what wa almost their
nativ element were get the best of it and drive the mazitu
back but what decid the dai against them were the gun of our zulu
hunter although i could not lift a rifl myself i manag to collect
these men round me and to direct their fire which prove so terrifi
to the pongo that after ten or a dozen of them had been knock over
thei began to give back sullenli and were help into their cano by
those men who were left in charg of them
then at length at a signal thei got out their paddl and still
shout curs and defianc at us row awai till thei becam but
speck upon the bosom of the great lake and vanish
two of the cano we captur howev and with them six or seven
pongo these the mazitu wish to put to death but at the bid
of brother john whose order it will be rememb had the same
author in mazituland as those of the king thei bound their arm and
made them prison instead
in about half an hour it wa all over but of the rest of that dai i
cannot write as i think i faint from utter exhaust which wa not
perhap wonder consid all that we had undergon in the four
and a half dai that had elaps sinc we first embark upon the great
lake for constant strain physic and mental i recal no such four
dai dure the whole of my adventur life it wa inde wonder
that we came through them aliv
the last thing i rememb wa the appear of sammi look veri
smart in hi blue cotton smock who now that the fight wa over
emerg like a butterfli when the sun shine after rain
oh mr quatermain he said i welcom you home again after arduou
exert and look into the ey of bloodi war all the dai of
absenc and a good part of the night too while the mosquito hunt
slumber i prai for your safeti like on oclock and perhap mr
quatermain that help to do the trick for what sai poet those who
serv and wait ar almost as good as those who cook dinner
such were the word which reach and oddli enough impress
themselv upon my darken brain or rather thei were part of the
word excerpt from a long speech that there is no doubt sammi had
carefulli prepar dure our absenc
chapter xix
the true holi flower
when i came to myself again it wa to find that i had slept fifteen or
sixteen hour for the sun of a new dai wa high in the heaven i wa
ly in a littl shelter of bough at the foot of that mound on which
we flew the flag that guid us back over the water of the lake kirua
near by wa han consum a gigant meal of meat which he had cook
over a neighbour fire with him to my delight i saw mavovo hi
head bound up though otherwis but littl the wors the stone which
probabl would have kill a thinskul white man had done no more
than knock him stupid and break the skin of hi scalp perhap becaus
the forc of it wa lessen by the gum mansr which like most
zulu of a certain ag or digniti he wore woven in hi hair
the two tent we had brought with us to the lake were pitch not far
awai and look quit pretti and peac there in the sunlight
han who wa watch me out of the corner of hi ey ran to me with
a larg pannikin of hot coffe which sammi had made readi against my
awaken for thei knew that my sleep wa or had becom of a natur
order i drank it to the last drop and in all my life never did i enjoi
anyth more then while i began upon some piec of the toast meat
i ask him what had happen
not much baa he answer except that we ar aliv who should be
dead the maam and the missi ar still asleep in that tent or at least
the maam is for the missi is help dogeetah her father to nurs
baa stephen who ha an ugli wound the pongo have gone and i think
will not return for thei have had enough of the white man gun the
mazitu have buri those of their dead whom thei could recov and have
sent their wound of whom there were onli six back to beza town on
litter that is all baa
then while i wash and never did i need a bath more and put on my
undercloth in which i had swum on the night of the kill of the
motombo that han had wrung out and dri in the sun i ask that
worthi how he wa after hi adventur
oh well enough baa he answer now that my stomach is full
except that my hand and wrist ar sore with crawl along the ground
like a babyan baboon and that i cannot get the stink of that god
skin out of my nose oh you dont know what it wa if i had been a
white man it would have kill me but baa perhap you did well to
take drunken old han with you on thi journei after all for i wa
clever about the littl gun wasnt i also about your swim of the
crocodil water though it is true that the sign of the spider and the
moth which your reverend father sent taught me that and now we have
got back safe except for the mazitu jerri who doesnt matter
for there ar plenti more like him and the wound in baa stephen
shoulder and that heavi flower which he thought better than brandi
ye han i said i did well to take you and you ar clever for had
it not been for you we should now be cook and eaten in pongoland i
thank you for your help old friend but han anoth time pleas sew
up the hole in your waistcoat pocket four cap wasnt much han
no baa but it wa enough as thei were all good on if there had
been forti you could not have done much more oh your reverend father
knew all that my depart parent had becom a kind of patron saint to
han and did not wish thi poor old hottentot to have more to carri
than wa need he knew you wouldnt miss baa and that there were
onli on god on devil and on man wait to be kill
i laugh for hanss wai of put thing wa certainli origin and
have got on my coat went to see stephen at the door of the tent i
met brother john whose shoulder wa dreadfulli sore from the rub of
the orchid stretcher as were hi hand with paddl but who otherwis
wa well enough and of cours suprem happi
he told me that he had cleans and sewn up stephen wound which
appear to be do well although the spear had pierc right through
the shoulder luckili without cut ani arteri so i went in to see
the patient and found him cheer enough though weak from weari
and loss of blood with miss hope feed him with broth from a wooden
nativ spoon i didnt stop veri long especi after he got on to
the subject of the lost orchid about which he began to show sign of
excit thi i allai as well as i could by tell him that i had
preserv a pod of the seed new at which he wa delight
there he said to think that you allan should have rememb to
take that precaut when i an orchidist forgot all about it
ah my boi i answer i have live long enough to learn never to
leav anyth behind that i can possibl carri awai also although not
an orchidist it occur to me that there ar more wai of propag
a plant than from the origin root which gener wont go into on
pocket
then he began to give me elabor instruct as to the preserv
of the seedpod in a perfectli dry and airtight tin box etc at which
point miss hope unceremoni bundl me out of the tent
that afternoon we held a confer at which it wa agre that we
should begin our return journei to beza town at onc as the place where
we were camp wa veri malari and there wa alwai a risk of the
pongo pai us anoth visit
so a litter wa made with a mat stretch over it in which stephen could
be carri sinc fortun there were plenti of bearer and our
other simpl prepar were quickli complet mr everslei and hope
were mount on the two donkei brother john whose hurt leg show
sign of renew weak rode hi white ox which wa now quit fat
again the wound hero stephen as i have said wa carri and i
walk compar note with old babemba on the pongo their manner
which i am bound to sai were good and their custom that as the
sai goe were simpli beastli
how delight that ancient warrior wa to hear again about the sacr
cave the crocodil water the mountain forest and it terribl god
of the death of which and of the motombo he made me tell him the
stori three time over at the conclus of the third recit he said
quietli
my lord macumazana you ar a great man and i am glad to have live if
onli to know you no on els could have done these deed
of cours i wa compliment but felt bound to point out hanss share
in our joint achiev
ye ye he answer the spot snake inhlatu ha the cun to
scheme but you have the power to do and what is the us of a brain to
plot without the arm to strike the two do not go togeth becaus the
plotter is not a striker hi mind is differ if the snake had
the strength and brain of the eleph and the fierc courag of the
buffalo soon there would be but on creatur left in the world but
the maker of all thing knew thi and kept them separ my lord
macumazana
i thought and still think that there wa a great deal of wisdom in
thi remark simpl as it seem oh sure mani of these savag whom
we white men despis ar no fool
after about an hour march we camp till the moon rose which it did
at ten oclock when we went on again till near dawn as it wa thought
better that stephen should travel in the cool of the night i rememb
that our cavalcad escort befor behind and on either flank by
the mazitu troop with their tall spear look picturesqu and even
impos as it wound over those wide down in the love and peac
light of the moon
there is no need for me to set out the detail of the rest of our
journei which wa not mark by ani incid of import
stephen bore it veri well and brother john who wa on of the best
doctor i ever met gave good report of him but i note that he did
not seem to get ani stronger although he at plenti of food also miss
hope who nurs him for her mother seem to have no tast that wai
inform me that he slept but littl as inde i found out for myself
o allan she said just befor we reach beza town stephen your
son she us to call him my son i dont know why is sick the
father sai it is onli the spearhurt but i tell you it is more than
the spearhurt he is sick in himself and the tear that fill her
grei ey show me that she spoke what she believ as a matter of
fact she wa right for on the night after we reach the town stephen
wa seiz with an attack of some bad form of african fever which in
hi weak state nearli cost him hi life contract no doubt at that
unhealthi crocodil water
our recept at beza wa most impos for the whole popul
head by old bausi himself came out to meet us with loud shout of
welcom from which we had to ask them to desist for stephen sake
so in the end we got back to our hut with gratitud of heart inde
we should have been veri happi there for a while had it not been for
our anxieti about stephen but it is alwai thu in the world who wa
ever allow to eat hi pot of honei without find a fly or perhap a
cockroach in hi mouth
in all stephen wa realli ill for about a month on the tenth dai after
our arriv at beza accord to my diari which have littl els
to do i enter up fulli at thi time we thought that he would sure
die even brother john who attend him with the most constant skill
and who had ampl quinin and other drug at hi command for these we
had brought with us from durban in plenti gave up the case dai and
night the poor fellow rave and alwai about that confound orchid the
loss of which seem to weigh upon hi mind as though it were a whole
sack of unrep crime
i realli think that he ow hi life to a subterfug or rather to a
bold invent of hope on even when he wa at hi veri worst and
go on like a mad creatur about the lost planti wa present in the
hut at the time alon with him and hersh took hi hand and point
to a perfectli open space on the floor said
look o stephen the flower ha been brought back
he stare and stare and then to my amaz answer
by jove so it ha but those beggar have broken off all the bloom
except on
ye she echo but on remain and it is the finest of them all
after thi he went quietli to sleep and slept for twelv hour then
took some food and slept again and what is more hi temperatur went
down to or a littl below normal when he final woke up as it
chanc i wa again present in the hut with hope who wa stand
on the spot which she had persuad him wa occupi by the orchid he
stare at thi spot and he stare at herm he could not see for i wa
behind himthen said in a weak voic
didnt you tell me miss hope that the plant wa where you ar and
that the most beauti of the flower wa left
i wonder what on earth her answer would be howev she rose to the
occas
o stephen she repli in her soft voic and speak in a wai so
natur that it freed her word from ani bold it is here for am
i not it childher nativ appel it will be rememb wa
child of the flower and the fairest of the flower is here too for
i am that flower which you found in the island of the lake o stephen i
prai you to troubl no more about a lost plant of which you have seed
in plenti but make thank that you still live and that through you
my mother and i still live who if you had di would weep our ey
awai
through me he answer you mean through allan and han also it wa
you who save my life there in the water oh i rememb it all now you
ar right hope although i didnt know it you ar the true holi flower
that i saw
she ran to him and kneel by hi side gave him her hand which he
press to hi pale lip
then i sneak out of that hut and left them to discuss the lost flower
that wa found again it wa a pretti scene and on that to my mind
gave a sort of spiritu mean to the whole of an otherwis rather
insan quest he sought an ideal flower he foundth love of hi life
after thi stephen recov rapidli for such love is the best of
medicinesif it be return
i dont know what pass between the pair and brother john and hi wife
for i never ask but i note that from thi dai forward thei began to
treat him as a son the new relationship between stephen and hope seem
to be tacitli accept without discuss even the nativ accept it
for old mavovo ask me when thei were go to be marri and how mani
cow stephen had promis to pai brother john for such a beauti wife
it ought to be a larg herd he said and of a big breed of cattl
sammi too allud to the young ladi in convers with me as mr
somerss affianc spous onli han said noth such a trivial
matter as marri and give in marriag did not interest him
or perhap he look upon the affair as a foregon conclus and
therefor unworthi of comment
we stai at bausi kraal for a full month longer whilst stephen
recov hi strength i grew thoroughli bore with the place and so
did mavovo and the zulu but brother john and hi wife did not seem to
mind mr everslei wa a passiv creatur quit content to take thing
as thei came and after so long an absenc from civil to bide a
littl longer among savag also she had her belov john at whom she
would sit and gaze by the hour like a cat sometim doe at a person to
whom it is attach inde when she spoke to him her voic seem
to me to resembl a kind of bliss purr i think it made the old boi
rather fidgeti sometim for after an hour or two of it he would rise
and go to hunt for butterfli
to tell the truth the situat got a littl on my nerv at last for
wherev i look i seem to see there stephen and hope make love
to each other or brother john and hi wife admir each other which
didnt leav me much spare convers evid thei thought that
mavovo han sammi bausi babemba and co were enough for methat is
if thei reflect on the matter at all so thei were in a sens for
the zulu hunter began to get out of hand in the midst of thi idl
and plenti eat too much drink too much nativ beer smoke too
much of the intox dakka a mischiev kind of help and make
too much love to the mazitu women which of cours result in the usual
row that i had to settl
at last i struck and said that we must move on as stephen wa now fit to
travel
quit so said brother john mildli what have you arrang allan
with some irrit for i hate that sentenc of brother john i
repli that i had arrang noth but that as none of them seem to
have ani suggest to make i would go out and talk the matter over
with han and mavovo which i did
i need not chronicl the result of our confer sinc other
arrang were be made for us at which i littl guess
it all came veri suddenli as great thing in the live of men and
nation sometim do although the mazitu were of the zulu famili their
militari organ had none of the zulu thorough for instanc
when i remonstr with bausi and old babemba as to their not keep
up a proper system of outpost and intellig thei laugh at me and
answer that thei never had been attack and now that the pongo had
learnt a lesson were never like to be
by the wai i see that i have not yet mention that at brother john
request those pongo who had been taken prison at the battl of
the reed were conduct to the shore of the lake given on of the
captur cano and told that thei might return to their own happi land
to our astonish about three week later thei reappear at beza town
with thi stori
thei said that thei had cross the lake and found rica still stand
but utterli desert thei then wander through the countri and even
explor the motombo cave there thei discov the remain of the
motombo still crouch upon hi platform but noth more in on hut
of a distant villag howev thei came across an old and dy woman
who inform them with her last breath that the pongo frighten by
the iron tube that vomit death and in obedi to some propheci
had all gone back whenc thei came in the begin take with them
the recaptur holi flower she had been left with a suppli of food
becaus she wa too weak to travel so perhap that flower grow
again in some unknown place in africa but it worshipp will have to
provid themselv with anoth god of the forest anoth mother of the
flower and anoth highpriest to fill the offic of the late motombo
these pongo prison have now no home and not know where their
peopl had gone except that it wa toward the north ask for
leav to settl among the mazitu which wa grant them their stori
confirm me in my opinion that pongoland is not realli an island but
is connect on the further side with the contin by some ridg or
swamp if we had been oblig to stop much longer among the mazitu i
would have satisfi myself as to thi matter by go to look but
that chanc never came to me until some year later when under curiou
circumst i wa again destin to visit thi part of africa
to return to my stori on the dai follow thi discuss as to our
departur we all breakfast veri earli as there wa a great deal to
be done there wa a dens mist that morn such as in these mazitu
upland often preced high hot wind from the north at thi season of
the year so dens inde that it wa imposs to see for more than
a few yard i suppos that thi mist come up from the great lake in
certain condit of the weather we had just finish our breakfast
and rather languidli for the thick sultri air left me unenerget i
told on of the zulu to see that the two donkei and the white ox which
i had caus to be brought into the town in view of our near departur
and ti up by our hut were properli fed then i went to inspect all
the rifl and ammunit which han had got out to be check
and overhaul it wa at thi moment that i heard a farawai and
unaccustom sound and ask han what he thought it wa
a gun baa he answer anxious
well might he be anxiou for as we both knew no on in the
neighbourhood had gun except ourselv and all our were account
for it is true that we had promis to give the major of those we
had taken from the slaver to bausi when we went awai and that i had
been instruct some of hi best soldier in the us of them but not
on of these had as yet been left in their possess
i step to a gate in the fenc and order the sentri there to run to
bausi and babemba and make report and inquiri also to prai them to
summon all the soldier of whom as it happen there were at the time
not more than three hundr in the town as perfect peac prevail
the rest accord to their custom had been allow to go to their
villag and attend to their crop then possess by a rather
undefin nervous at which the other were inclin to laugh i
caus the zulu to arm and gener make a few arrang to meet
ani unforeseen crisi thi done i sat down to reflect what would be the
best cours to take if we should happen to be attack by a larg forc
in that straggl nativ town of which i had often studi all the
strateg possibl when i had come to my own conclus i ask
han and mavovo what thei thought and found that thei agre with me
that the onli defens place wa outsid the town where the road to
the south gate ran down to a rocki wood ridg with somewhat steep
flank it mai be rememb that it wa by thi road and over thi
ridg that brother john had appear on hi white ox when we were about
to be shot to death with arrow at the post in the marketplac
whilst we were still talk two of the mazitu captain appear
run hard and drag between them a wound herdsman who had
evid been hit in the arm by a bullet
thi wa hi stori that he and two other boi were out herd the
king cattl about half a mile to the north of the town when suddenli
there appear a great number of men dress in white robe all of whom
were arm with gun these men of whom he thought there must be three
or four hundr began to take the cattl and see the three herd
fire on them wound him and kill hi two companion he then
ran for hi life and brought the new he ad that on of the men had
call after him to tell the white peopl that thei had come to kill
them and the mazitu who were their friend and to take awai the white
women
hassanbenmoham and hi slaver i said as babemba appear at
the head of a number of soldier cry out
the slaved arab ar here lord macumazana thei have crept
on us through the mist a herald of their ha come to the north gate
demand that we should give up you white peopl and your servant
and with you a hundr young men and a hundr young women to be sold as
slave if we do not do thi thei sai that thei will kill all of us save
the unmarri boi and girl and that you white peopl thei will take
and put to death by burn keep onli the two women aliv on
hassan send thi messag
inde i answer quietli for in thi fix i grew quit cool as wa
usual with me and doe bausi mean to give us up
how can bausi give up dogeetah who is hi blood brother and you hi
friend exclaim the old gener indignantli bausi send me to
hi brother dogeetah that he mai receiv the order of the white man
wisdom spoken through your mouth lord macumazana
then there a good spirit in bausi i repli and these ar
dogeetah order spoken through my mouth go to hassan messeng and
ask him whether he rememb a certain letter which two white men left
for him outsid their camp in a cleft stick tell him that the time ha
now come for those white men to fulfil the promis thei made in that
letter and that befor tomorrow he will be hang on a tree then
babemba gather your soldier and hold the north gate of the town for as
long as you can defend it with bow and arrow afterward retreat
through the town join us among the tree on the rocki slope that is
opposit the south gate bid some of your men clear the town of all the
ag and women and children and let them pass though the south gate and
take refug in the wood countri beyond the slope let them not tarri
let them go at onc do you understand
i understand everyth lord macumazana the word of dogeetah shall
be obei oh would that we had listen to you and kept a better
watch
he rush off run like a young man and shout order as he went
now i said we must be move
we collect all the rifl and ammunit with some other thing i
am sure i forget what thei were and with the help of a few guard whom
babemba had left outsid our gate start through the town lead
with us the two donkei and the white ox i rememb by an afterthought
tell sammi who wa look veri uncomfort to return to the hut
and fetch some blanket and a coupl of iron cookingpot which might
becom necess to us
oh mr quatermain he answer i will obei you though with fear
and trembl
he went and when a few hour afterward i note that he had never
reappear i came to the conclus with a sigh for i wa veri fond
of sammi in a wai that he had fallen into troubl and been kill
probabl i thought hi fear and trembl had overcom hi reason
and caus him to run in the wrong direct with the cookingpot
the first part of our march through the town wa easi enough but after
we had cross the marketplac and emerg into the narrow wai that ran
between mani line of hut to the south gate it becam more difficult
sinc thi path wa alreadi crowd with hundr of terrifi
fugit old peopl sick be carri littl boi girl and women
with infant at the breast it wa imposs to control these poor
folk all we could do wa to fight our wai through them howev we got
out at last and climb the slope took up the best posit we could
on and just beneath it crest where the tree and scatter boulder
gave us veri fair cover which we improv upon in everi wai feasibl in
the time at our dispos by build littl breastwork of stone and so
forth the fugit who had accompani us and those who follow a
multitud in all did not stop here but flow on along the road and
vanish into the wood countri behind
i suggest to brother john that he should take hi wife and daughter
and the three beast and go with them he seem inclin to accept the
idea needless to sai for their sake not for hi own for he wa a
veri fearless old fellow but the two ladi utterli refus to budg
hope said that she would stop with stephen and her mother declar that
she had everi confid in me and prefer to remain where she wa
then i suggest that stephen should go too but at thi he grew so
angri that i drop the subject
so in the end we establish them in a pleasant littl hollow by a
spring just over the crest of the rise where unless our flank were
turn or we were rush thei would be out of the reach of bullet
moreov without sai anyth more we gave to each of them a
doublebarrel and load pistol
chapter xx
the battl of the gate
by now heavi fire had begun at the north gate of the town accompani
by much shout the mist wa still too thick to enabl us to see
anyth at first but shortli after the commenc of the fire
a strong hot wind which alwai follow these mist got up and
gradual gather to a gale blow awai the vapour then from the
top of the crest han who had climb a tree there report that the
arab were advanc on the north gate fire as thei came and that
the mazitu were repli with their bow and arrow from behind the
palisad that surround the town thi palisad i should state
consist of an earthen bank on the top of which tree trunk were set
close togeth mani of these had struck in that fertil soil so that
in gener appear thi protect work resembl a huge live fenc
on the outer and inner side of which grew great mass of prickli pear
and tall fingerlik cacti a while afterward han report that the
mazitu were retreat and a few minut later thei began to arriv
through the south gate bring sever wound with them their
captain said that thei could not stand against the fire of the gun and
had determin to abandon the town and make the best fight thei could
upon the ridg
a littl later the rest of the mazitu came drive befor them all the
noncombat who remain in the town with these wa king bausi in a
terribl state of excit
wa i not wise macumazana he shout to fear the slavetrad and
their gun now thei have come to kill those who ar old and to take the
young awai in their gang to sell them
ye king i could not help answer you were wise but if you had
done what i said and kept a better lookout hassan could not have crept
on you like a leopard on a goat
it is true he groan but who know the tast of a fruit till he
ha bitten it
then he went to see to the dispos of hi soldier along the ridg
place by my advic the most of them at each end of the line
to frustrat ani attempt to outflank us we for our part busi
ourselv in serv out those gun which we had taken in the first
fight with the slaver to the thirti or forti pick men whom i had been
instruct in the us of firearm if thei did not do much damag at
least i thought thei could make a nois and impress the enemi with the
idea that we were well arm
ten minut or so later babemba arriv with about fifti men all the
mazitu soldier who were left in the town he report that he had held
the north gate as long as he could in order to gain time and that the
arab were break it in i beg him to order the soldier to pile
up stone as a defenc against the bullet and to lie down behind them
thi he went to do
then after a paus we saw a larg bodi of the arab who had effect
an entri advanc down the central street toward us some of them
had spear as well as gun on which thei carri a dozen or so of human
head cut from the mazitu who had been kill wave them aloft and
shout in triumph it wa a sicken sight and on that made me
grind my teeth with rage also i could not help reflect that er long
our head might be upon those spear well if the worst came to the
worst i wa determin that i would not be taken aliv to be burn in
a slow fire or pin over an antheap a point upon which the other
agre with me though poor brother john had scrupl as to suicid
even in despair
it wa just then that i miss han and ask where he had gone
somebodi said that he thought he had seen him run awai whereon
mavovo who wa grow excit call out
ah spot snake ha sought hi hole snake hiss but thei do not
charg
no but sometim thei bite i answer for i could not believ that
han had show the white feather howev he wa gone and clearli we
were in no state to send to look for him
now our hope wa that the slaver flush with victori would advanc
across the open ground of the marketplac which we could sweep with
our fire from our posit on the ridg thi inde thei began to do
whereon without order the mazitu to whom we had given the gun to
my furi and dismai commenc to blaze awai at a rang of about four
hundr yard and after a good deal of fire manag to kill or wound
two or three men then the arab see their danger retreat and
after a paus renew their advanc in two bodi thi time howev
thei follow the street of hut that were built thickli between the
outer palisad of the town and the marketplac which as it had been
design to hold cattl in time of need wa also surround with a
wooden fenc strong enough to resist the rush of horn beast on that
dai i should add as the mazitu never dream of be attack all
their stock were graze on some distant veldt in thi space between
the two fenc were mani hundr of hut wattl and grass built but
for the most part roof with palm leav for here in their separ
quarter dwelt the great major of the inhabit of beza town of
which the northern part wa occupi by the king the nobl and the
captain thi ring of hut which entir surround the marketplac
except at the two gatewai mai have been about a hundr and twenti
yard in width
down the path between these hut both on the eastern and the western
side advanc the arab and halfbre of whom there appear to
be about four hundr all arm with gun and doubtless train to
fight it wa a terribl forc for us to face see that although
we mai have had nearli as mani men our gun did not total more
than fifti and most of those who held them were quit unus to the
manag of firearm
soon the arab began to open fire on us from behind the hut and a veri
accur fire it wa as our casualti quickli show notwithstand
the stone schanz we had construct the worst featur of the thing
also wa that we could not repli with ani effect as our assail who
gradual work nearer were effect screen by the hut and we
had not enough gun to attempt organis vollei fire although i tri
to keep a cheer counten i confess that i began to fear the worst
and even to wonder if we could possibl attempt to retreat thi idea
wa abandon howev sinc the arab would certainli overtak and
shoot us down
on thing i did i persuad babemba to send about fifti men to build
up the southern gate which wa made of trunk of tree and open
outward with earth and the big stone that lai about in plenti while
thi wa be done quickli for the mazitu soldier work at the task
like demon and be shelter by the palisad could not be shot all
of a sudden i caught sight of four or five wisp of smoke that aros
in quick success at the north end of the town and were instantli
follow by as mani burst of flame which leapt toward us in the strong
wind
someon wa fire beza town in less than an hour the flame driven by
the gale through hundr of hut made dry as tinder by the heat would
reduc beza to a heap of ash it wa inevit noth could save
the place for an instant i thought that the arab must have done
thi thing then see that new fire continu aros in differ
place i understood that no arab but a friend or friend were at
work who had conceiv the idea of destroi the arab with fire
my mind flew to sammi without doubt sammi had stai behind to carri
out thi terribl and masterli scheme of which i am sure none of the
mazitu would have thought sinc it involv the absolut destruct
of their home and properti sammi at whom we had alwai mock wa
after all a great man prepar to perish in the flame in order to
save hi friend
babemba rush up point with a spear to the rise fire now my
inspir came
take all your men i said except those who ar arm with gun
divid them encircl the town guard the north gate though i think
none can win back through the flame and if ani of the arab succe in
break through the palisad kill them
it shall be done shout babemba but oh for the town of beza where
i wa born oh for the town of beza
drat the town of beza i holloa after him or rather it nativ
equival it is of all our live that im think
three minut later the mazitu divid into two bodi were run
like hare to encircl the town and though a few were shot as thei
descend the slope the most of them gain the shelter of the palisad
in safeti and there at interv halt by section for babemba
manag the matter veri well
now onli we white peopl with the zulu hunter under mavovo of whom
there were twelv in all and the mazitu arm with gun number
about thirti were left upon the slope
for a littl while the arab did not seem to realis what had happen
but engag themselv in pepper at the mazitu who i think thei
conclud were in full flight present howev thei either heard or
saw
oh what a hubbub ensu all the four hundr of them began to shout
at onc some of them ran to the palisad and began to climb it but as
thei reach the top of the fenc were pin by the mazitu arrow and
fell backward while a few who got over becam entangl in the prickli
pear on the further side and were promptli spear give up thi
attempt thei rush back along the lane with the intent of escap
at the northgat but befor ever thei reach the head of the
marketplac the roar windswept flame leap from hut to hut
had bar their path thei could not face that aw furnac
now thei took anoth counsel and in a great confus bodi charg down
the marketplac to break out at the south gate and our turn came how
we rake them as thei sped across the open an easi mark i know that
i fire as fast as i could us two rifl swear the while at han
becaus he wa not there to load for me stephen wa better off in thi
respect for look round to my astonish i saw hope who had
left her mother on the other side of the hill in the act of cap hi
second gun i should explain that dure our stai in beza town we had
taught her how to us a rifl
i call to him to send her awai but again she would not go even after
a bullet had pierc her dress
still all our shoot could not stop that rush of men made desper
by the fear of a fieri death leav mani stretch out behind them
the first of the arab drew near to the south gate
my father said mavovo in my ear now the real fight is go to
begin the gate will soon be down we must be the gate
i nod for if the arab onc got through there were enough of them
left to wipe us out five time over inde i do not suppos that up
to thi time thei had actual lost more than forti men a few word
explain the situat to stephen and brother john whom i told to
take hi daughter to her mother and wait there with them the mazitu i
order to throw down their gun for if thei kept these i wa sure thei
would shoot some of us and to accompani us bring their spear onli
then we rush down the slope and took up our posit in a littl open
space in front of the gate that now wa totter to it fall beneath
the blow and drag of the arab at thi time the sight wa
terribl and magnific for the flame had got hold of the two
halfcircl of hut that embrac the marketplac and fan by
the blast were rush toward us like a thing aliv abov us swept
a great pall of smoke in which float flake of fire so thick that it
hid the sky though fortun the wind did not suffer it to sink
and choke us the sound also were almost inconceiv for to the
crackl roar of the conflagr as it devour hut after hut were
ad the coars yell voic of the halfbr arab as in mingl
rage and terror thei tore at the gatewai or each other and the report
of the gun which mani of them were still fire half at hazard
we form up befor the gate the zulu with stephen and myself in front
and the thirti pick mazitu command by no less a person than bausi
the king behind we had not long to wait for present down the thing
came and over it and the mound of earth and stone we had built beyond
began to pour a mob of whiterob and turban men whose mix and
tumultu exit somehow remind me of the pip and pulp be squeez
out of a grenadilla fruit
i gave the word and we fire into that pack mass with terribl
effect realli i think that each bullet must have brought down two or
three of them then at a command from mavovo the zulu threw down
their gun and charg with their broad spear stephen who had got
hold of an assegai somehow went with them fire a colt revolv as
he ran while at their back came bausi and hi thirti tall mazitu
i will confess at onc that i did not join in thi terrif onslaught i
felt that i had not weight enough for a scrimmag of the sort also that
i should perhap be better emploi us my wit outsid and watch
for a chanc to be of servic like a halfback in a footbal field
than in get my brain knock out in a gener row or mayhap my
heart fail me and i wa afraid i dare sai for i have never pretend
to great courag at ani rate i stop outsid and shot whenev i got
the chanc not without effect fill a humbl but perhap a us
part
it wa realli magnific that frai how those zulu did go in for
quit a long while thei held the narrow gatewai and the mound against
all the howl thrust mob much as the roman call horatiu and
hi two friend held the entranc to some bridg or other long ago at
rome against a great forc of i forget whom thei shout their zulu
battlecri of laba laba that of their regiment i suppos for
most of them were men of about the same ag and stab and fought and
struggl and went down on by on
back the rest of them were swept then led by mavovo stephen and
bausi charg again reinforc with the thirti mazitu now the tongu
of flame met almost over them the grow fenc of prickli pear and
cacti wither and crackl and still thei fought on beneath that arch
of fire
back thei were driven again by the mere weight of number i saw mavovo
stab a man and go down he rose and stab anoth then fell again for
he wa hard hit
two arab rush to kill him i shot them both with a right and left
for fortun my rifl wa just reload he rose onc more and kill
a third man stephen came to hi support and grappl with an arab
dash hi head against the gatepost so that he fell old bausi
pant like a grampu plung in with hi remain mazitu and the
combat becam so confus in the dark gloom of the overhang smoke
that i could scarc tell on from the other yet the madden arab
were win as thei must for how could our small and everlessen
compani stand against their rush
we were in a littl circl now of which somehow i found myself the
centr and thei were attack us on all side stephen got a knock
on the head from the butt end of a gun and tumbl against me nearli
upset me as i recov myself i look round in despair
now it wa that i saw a veri welcom sight name han ye the lost
han himself with hi filthi hat whereof i notic even then the frai
ostrich feather were smoulder hang by a leather strap at the
back of hi head he wa shambl along in a sly and silent sort
of wai but at a great rate with hi mouth open beckon over hi
shoulder and behind him came about on hundr and fifti mazitu
those mazitu soon put anoth complexion upon the affair for charg
with a roar thei drove back the arab who had no space to develop
their line straight into the jaw of that burn hell a littl later
the rest of the mazitu return with babemba and finish the job onli
quit a few of the arab got out and were captur after thei had thrown
down their gun the rest retreat into the centr of the marketplac
whither our peopl follow them in thi crisi the blood of these
mazitu told and thei stuck to the enemi as zulu themselv would
certainli have done
it wa over great heaven it wa over and we began to count
our loss four of the zulu were dead and two other were badli
woundedno three includ mavovo thei brought him to me lean on
the shoulder of babemba and anoth mazitu captain he wa a shock
sight for he wa shot in three place and badli cut and batter as
well he look at me a littl while breath heavili then spoke
it wa a veri good fight my father he said of all that i have
fought i can rememb none better although i have been in far greater
battl which is well as it is my last i foreknew it my father for
though i never told it you the first death lot that i drew down yonder
in durban wa my own take back the gun you gave me my father you did
but lend it me for a littl while as i said to you now i go to the
underworld to join the spirit of my ancestor and of those who have
fallen at my side in mani war and of those women who bore my children
i shall have a tale to tell them there my father and togeth we will
wait for youtil you too die in war
then he lift up hi arm from the neck of babemba and salut me with
a loud cry of baba inkosi give me certain great titl which i
will not set down and have done so sank to the earth
i sent on of the mazitu to fetch brother john who arriv present
with hi wife and daughter he examin mavovo and told him straight out
that noth could help him except prayer
make no prayer for me dogeetah said the old heathen i have
follow my star ie live accord to my light and am readi to
eat the fruit that i have plant or if the tree prove barren then to
drink of it sap and sleep
wave brother john asid he beckon to stephen
o wazela he said you fought veri well in that fight if you go on
as you have begun in time you will make a warrior of whom the daughter
of the flower and her children will sing song after you have come to
join me your friend meanwhil farewel take thi assegai of mine and
clean it not that the red rust thereon mai put you in mind of mavovo
the old zulu doctor and captain with whom you stood side by side in the
battl of the gate when as though thei were winter grass the fire
burnt up the whiterob thiev of men who could not pass our spear
then he wave hi hand again and stephen step asid mutter
someth for he and mavovo had been veri intim and hi voic choke
in hi throat with grief now the old zulu glaze ey fell upon han
who wa sneak about i think with a view of find an opportun of
bid him a last goodby
ah spot snake he cri so you have come out of your hole now
that the fire ha pass it to eat the burnt frog in the cinder it
is a piti that you who ar so clever should be a coward sinc our lord
macumazana need on to load for him on the hill and would have kill
more of the hyena had you been there
ye spot snake it is so echo an indign choru of the other
zulu while stephen and i and even the mild brother john look at him
reproachfulli
now han who gener wa as patient under affront as a jew for onc
lost hi temper he dash hi hat upon the ground and danc on it he
spat toward the surviv zulu hunter he even vituper the dy
mavovo
o son of a fool he said you pretend that you can see what is hid
from other men but i tell you that there is a ly spirit in your
lip you call me a coward becaus i am not big and strong as you
were and cannot hold an ox by the horn but at least there is more
brain in my stomach than in all your head where would all of you be now
had it not been for poor spot snake the coward who twice thi dai
ha save everi on of you except those whom the baass father the
reverend predik ha mark upon the forehead to come and join him in
a place that is even hotter and brighter than that burn town
now we look at han wonder what he meant about save us twice
and mavovo said
speak on quickli o spot snake for i would hear the end of your
stori how did you help us in your hole
han began to grub about in hi pocket from which final he produc
a matchbox wherein there remain but on match
with thi he said oh could none of you see that the men of
hassan had all walk into a trap did none of you know that fire burn
thatch hous and that a strong wind drive it fast and far while
you sat there upon the hill with your head togeth like sheep wait
to be kill i crept awai among the bush and went about my busi
i said noth to ani of you not even to the baa lest he should
answer me no han there mai be an old woman sick in on of those
hut and therefor you must not fire them in such matter who doe
not know that white peopl ar fool even the best of them and in fact
there were sever old women for i saw them run for the gatewai
well i crept up by the green fenc which i knew would not burn and i
came to the north gate there wa an arab sentri left there to watch
he fire at me look well for han hi mother bore him short and he
point to a hole in the filthi hat then befor that arab could load
again poor coward han got hi knife into him from behind look and
he produc a big blade which wa such as butcher us from hi belt
and show it to us after that it wa easi sinc fire is a wonder
thing you make it small and it grow big of itself like a child and
never get tire and is alwai hungri and run fast as a hors i lit
six of them where thei would burn quickest then i save the last match
sinc we have few left and came through the gate befor the fire at me
up me it father me the sower of the red seed
we stare at the old hottentot in admir even mavovo lift hi
dy head and stare but han whose annoy had now evapor
went on in a jogtrot mechan voic
as i wa return to find the baa if he still live the heat of the
fire forc me to the high ground to the west of the fenc so that i
saw what wa happen at the south gate and that the arab men must
break through there becaus you who held it were so few so i ran down
to babemba and the other captain veri quickli tell them there wa
no need to guard the fenc ani more and that thei must get to the south
gate and help you sinc otherwis you would all be kill and thei
too would be kill afterward babemba listen to me and start
send out messeng to collect the other and we got here just in
time such is the hole i hid in dure the battl of the gate o mavovo
that is all the stori which i prai that you will tell to the baass
reverend father the predik present for i am sure that it will
pleas him to learn that he did not teach me to be wise and help all
men and alwai to look after the baa allan to no purpos still i am
sorri that i wast so mani match for where shall we get ani more now
that the camp is burnt and he gaze ruefulli at the all but empti box
mavovo spoke onc more in a slow gasp voic
never again he said address han shall you be call spot
snake o littl yellow man who ar so great and white of heart behold
i give you a new name by which you shall be known with honour from
gener to gener it is light in dark it is lord of the
fire
then he close hi ey and fell back insens within a few minut
he wa dead but those high name with which he christen han with hi
dy breath clung to the old hottentot for all hi dai inde from
that dai forward no nativ would ever have ventur to call him by ani
other among them far and wide thei becam hi titl of honour
the roar of the flame grew less and the tumult within their fieri
circl di awai for now the mazitu were return from the last fight
in the marketplac if fight it could be call bear in their arm
great bundl of the gun which thei had collect from the dead arab
most of whom had thrown down their weapon in a last wild effort to
escap but between the spear of the infuri savag on the on hand
and the devour fire on the other what escap wa there for them
the bloodstain wretch who remain in the camp and town of the
slavetrad along the eastern coast of africa or in the isl of
madagascar alon could tell how mani were lost sinc of those who went
out from them to make war upon the mazitu and their white friend none
return again with the long line of expect captiv thei had gone
to their own place of which sometim that flame african citi ha
seem to me a symbol thei were wick men inde devil stalk the
earth in human form without piti without shame yet i could not help
feel sorri for them at the last for truli their end wa aw
thei brought the prison up to us and among them hi white
robe halfburnt off him i recognis the hideou pockmark
hassanbenmoham
i receiv your letter written a while ago in which you promis
to make us die by fire and thi morn i receiv your messag
hassan i said brought by the wound lad who escap from you when
you murder hi companion and to both i sent you an answer if none
reach you look around for there is on written larg in a tongu
that all can read

for merci inde see mr everslei he crawl to her and catch
hold of her white robe beg her to interced for him
you made a slave of me after i had nurs you in the spot sick
she answer and tri to kill my husband for no fault through you
hassan i have spent all the best year of my life among savag alon
and in despair still for my part i forgiv you but oh mai i never

then she wrench herself free from hi grasp and went awai with her
daughter
i too forgiv you although you murder my peopl and for twenti
year made my time a torment said brother john who wa on of the
truest christian i have ever known mai god forgiv you also and he
follow hi wife and daughter
then the old king bausi who had come through that battl with a slight
wound spoke sai
i am glad red thief that these white peopl have grant you what
you askednam their forgivenesssinc the deed is greatli to their
honour and caus me and my peopl to think them even nobler than we did
befor but o murder of men and woman and traffick in children i
am judg here not the white peopl look on your work and he point
first to the line of zulu and mazitu dead and then to hi burn
town look and rememb the fate you promis to us who have never
harm you look look look o hyena of a man
at thi point i too went awai nor did i ever ask what becam of hassan
and hi fellowcapt moreov whenev ani of the nativ or han
tri to inform me i bade them hold their tongu
epilogu
i have littl more to add to thi record which i fear ha grown into
quit a long book or at ani rate although the set of it down ha
amus me dure the afternoon and even of thi endless english
winter now that the spring is come again i seem to have grown weari of
write therefor i shall leav what remain untold to the imagin
of anyon who chanc to read these page
we were victori and had inde much caus for gratitud who still
live to look upon the sun yet the night that follow the battl of
the gate wa a sad on at least for me who felt the death of my friend
the foresight hero mavovo of the bombast but faith sammi and
of my brave hunter more than i can sai also the old zulu propheci
concern me that i too should die in battl weigh upon me who
seem to have seen enough of such end in recent dai and to desir on
more tranquil
live here in peac england as i do now with no present prospect
of leav it it doe not appear like that it will be fulfil yet
after my experi of the divin power of mavovo snakewel
those word of hi make me feel uncomfort for when all is said
and done who can know the futur moreov it is the improb that
gener happen
as the reader of allan quatermain will be awar thi propheci
of the dy zulu wa fulfil mr quatermain di at zuvendi as a
result of the wound he receiv in the battl between the armi of the
rival queenseditor
further the climat condit were not conduc to cheer for
shortli after sunset it began to rain and pour for most of the night
which as we had littl shelter wa inconveni both to us and to all
the hundr of the homeless mazitu
howev the rain ceas in due time and on the follow morn
the welcom sun shone out of a clear sky when we had dri and warm
ourselv a littl in it rai someon suggest that we should visit
the burnedout town where except for some smoulder heap that
had been hut the fire wa extinguish by the heavi rain more from
curios than for ani other reason i consent and accompani by
bausi babemba and mani of the mazitu all of us except brother john
who remain behind to attend to the wound climb over the debri
of the south gate and walk through the black ruin of the hut across
the marketplac that wa strewn with dead to what had been our own
quarter
these were a melancholi sight a mere heap of sodden and still smoke
ash i could have wept when i look at them think of all the
trade good and store that were consum beneath necess for the
most part the destruct of which must make our return journei on of
great hardship
well there wa noth to be said or done so after a few minut of
contempl we turn to continu our walk through what had been the
royal quarter to the north gate han who i note had been ferret
about in hi furtiv wai as though he were look for someth and i
were the last to leav suddenli he laid hi hand upon my arm and said
baa listen i hear a ghost i think it is the ghost of sammi ask
us to buri him
bosh i answer and then listen as hard as i could
now i also seem to hear someth come from i knew not where word
which were frequent repeat and which seem to be
o mr quatermain i beg you to be so good as to open the door of thi
oven
for a while i thought i must be crack howev i call back the
other and we all listen of a sudden han made a pounc like a
terrier doe at the run of a mole that he hear work underground and
began to drag or rather to shovel at a heap of ash in front of us
us a bit of wood as thei were still too hot for hi hand then we
listen again and thi time heard the voic quit clearli come from
the ground
baa said han it is sammi in the cornpit
now i rememb that such a pit exist in front of the hut which
although empti at the time wa as is common among the bantu nativ
us to preserv corn that would not immedi be need onc i
myself went through a veri tragic experi in on of these pit
as ani who mai read the histori of my first wife that i have call
mari can see for themselv
soon we clear the place and had lift the stone with ventil
hole in itwel wa it for sammi that those ventil hole exist
also that the stone did not fit tight beneath wa a bottleshap and
cement structur about ten feet deep by sai eight wide instantli
through the mouth of thi structur appear the head of sammi with hi
mouth wide open like that of a fish gasp for air we pull him out
a process that caus him to howl for the heat had made hi skin
veri tender and gave him water which on of the mazitu fetch from
a spring then i ask him indignantli what he wa do in that hole
while we wast our tear think that he wa dead
oh mr quatermain he said i am a victim of too faith servic
to abandon all these valuabl possess of your to a rapaci enemi
wa more than i could bear so i put everi on of them in the pit and
then as i thought i heard someon come got in myself and pull down
the stone but mr quatermain soon afterward the enemi ad arson to
murder and pillag and the whole place began to blaze i could hear the
fire roar abov and a littl later the ash cover the exit so that
i could no longer lift the stone which inde grew too hot to touch
here then i sat all night in the most suffoc heat veri much
afraid mr quatermain lest the two keg of gunpowd that were with me
should explod till at last just as i had abandon hope and prepar
to die like a tortois bake aliv by a bushman i heard your welcom
voic and mr quatermain if there is ani sooth ointment to spare i
shall be much oblig for i am scorch all over
ah sammi sammi i said you see what come of cowardic on the
hill with us you would not have been scorch and it is onli by the
merest chanc of ow to hanss quick hear that you were not left to
perish miser in that hole
that is so mr quatermain i plead guilti to the hot impeach but
on the hill i might have been shot which is wors than be scorch
also you gave me charg of your good and i determin to preserv them
even at the risk of person comfort lastli the angel who watch me
brought you here in time befor i wa quit cook through so all
well that end well mr quatermain though it is true that for my
part i have had enough of bloodi war and if i live to regain civil
region i propos henceforth to follow the art of fooddress in the
safe kitchen of an hotel that is if i cannot obtain a berth as an
instructor in the english tongu
ye i answer all well that end well sammi my boi and at ani
rate you have save the store for which we should be thank to you
so go along with mr stephen and get doctor while we haul them out of
that grainpit
three dai later we bid farewel to old bausi who almost wept at
part with us and the mazitu who were alreadi engag in the
rebuild of their town mavovo and the other zulu who di in the
battl of the gate we buri on the ridg opposit to it rais
a mound of earth over them that therebi thei might be rememb in
gener to come and lai around them the mazitu who had fallen
in the fight as we pass that mound on our homeward journei the
zulu who remain aliv includ two wound men who were carri
in litter stop and salut solemnli prais the dead with loud
song we white peopl too salut but in silenc by rais our hat
by the wai i should add that in thi matter also mavovo snake did
not lie he had said that six of hi compani would be kill upon our
expedit and six were kill neither more nor less
after much consult we determin to take the overland rout back
to natal first becaus it wa alwai possibl that the slavetrad
fratern hear of their terribl loss might try to attack us
again on the coast and secondli for the reason that even if thei did
not month or perhap year might pass befor we found a ship at kilwa
then a port of ill reput to carri us to ani civil place moreov
brother john who had travel it knew the inland road well and had
establish friendli relat with the tribe through whose countri we
must pass till we reach the brother of zululand where i wa alwai
welcom so as the mazitu furnish us with an escort and plenti
of bearer for the first part of the road and thank to sammi
stewardship in the cornpit we had ampl trade good left to hire
other later on we made up our mind to risk the longer journei
as it turn out thi wa a wise conclus sinc although it took
four weari month in the end we accomplish it without ani accid
whatsoev if i except a slight attack of fever from which both miss
hope and i suffer for a while also we got some good shoot on the
road my onli regret wa that thi chang of plan oblig us to abandon
the tusk of ivori we had captur from the slaver and buri where we
alon could find them
still it wa a dull time for me who for obviou reason of which i
have alreadi spoken wa liter a fifth wheel to the coach han wa
an excel fellow and as the reader know quit a geniu in hi
own wai but night after night in hanss societi began to pall on me at
last while even hi convers about my reverend father who seem
posit to haunt him acquir a certain same of cours we
had other subject in common especi those connect with retief
massacr whereof we were the onli two survivor but of these i seldom
care to speak thei were and still remain too pain
therefor for my part i wa thank when at last in zululand we fell
in with some trader whom i knew who hire us on of their wagon in
thi vehicl abandon the wornout donkei and the white ox which
we present to a chief of my acquaint brother john and the ladi
proceed to durban stephen attend them on a hors that we had
bought while i with han attach myself to the trader
at durban a surpris await us sinc as we trek into the town
which at that time wa still a small place whom should we meet but sir
alexand somer who hear that wagon were come from zululand
had ridden out in the hope of obtain new of us it seem that the
choler old gentleman anxieti concern hi son had so weigh on
hi mind that at length he made up hi mind to proce to africa to hunt
for him so there he wa the meet between the two wa affection
but peculiar
hullo dad said stephen whoever would have thought of see you
here
hullo stephen said hi father whoever would have expect to find
you aliv and look welly veri well it is more than you deserv
you young ass and i hope you wont do it again
have deliv himself thu the old boi seiz stephen by the hair
and solemnli kiss him on the brow
no dad answer hi son i dont mean to do it again but thank
to allan there weve come through all right and by the wai let me
introduc you to the ladi i am go to marri also to her father and
mother
well all the rest mai be imagin thei were marri a fortnight later
in durban and a veri pleasant affair it wa sinc sir alexand who
by the wai treat me most handsom from a busi point of
view liter entertain the whole town on that festiv occas
immedi afterward stephen accompani by mr and mr everslei
and hi father took hi wife home to be educ though what that
process consist of i never heard han and i saw them off at the point
and our part wa rather sad although han went back the richer
by the 500 which stephen had promis him he bought a farm with the
monei and on the strength of hi exploit establish himself as a
kind of littl chief of whom more latera thei sai in the pedigre
book
sammi too wa set up as the proprietor of a small hotel where
he spent most of hi time in the bar dilat to the custom in
magnific sentenc that remind me of the style of a poem call
the essai on man which i onc tri to read and couldnt about
hi feat as a warrior among the wild mazitu and the maneat
devilworship pongo tribe
two year or less afterward i receiv a letter from which i must
quot a passag
as i told you my father ha given a live which he own to mr
everslei a pretti littl place where there isnt much for a
parson to do i think it rather bore my respect parentsinlaw
at ani rate dogeetah spend a lot of hi time wander about
the new forest which is near by with a butterflynet and try
to imagin that he is back in africa the mother of the flower
who after a long cours of bootkiss mute doesnt get on
with english servant ha anoth amus there is a small
lake in the rectori ground in which is a littl island here she
ha put up a reed fenc round a laurustinu bush which flower at
the same time of year as did the holi flower and within thi reed
fenc she sit whenev the weather will allow as i believ go
through the rite of the flower at least when i call upon her
there on dai in a boat i found her wear a white robe and
sing some mystic nativ song
mani year have gone by sinc then both brother john and hi wife have
depart to their rest and their strang stori the strangest almost of
all stori is practic forgotten stephen whose father ha also
depart is a prosper baronet and rather heavi member of parliament
and magistr the father of mani fine children for the miss hope
of old dai ha prove as fruit as a daughter of the goddess of
fertil for that wa the mother real offic ought to be
sometim she said to me on dai with a laugh as she survei a
larg and noisi select of her numer offspr sometim o
allansh still retain that trick of speechi wish that i were back
in the peac of the home of the flower ah she ad with someth of
a thrill in her voic never can i forget the blue of the sacr lake
or the sight of those ski at dawn do you think that i shall see them
again when i die o allan
at the time i thought it rather ungrat of her to speak thu but
after all human natur is a queer thing and we ar all of us attach to
the scene of our childhood and long at time again to breath our natal
air
i went to see sir stephen the other dai and in hi splendid greenhous
the head garden woodden an old man now show me three nobl
longleav plant which sprang from the seed of the holi flower that i
had save in my pocket
but thei have not yet bloom
somehow i wonder what will happen when thei do it seem to me as though
when onc more the glori of that golden bloom is seen of the ey of
men the ghost of the terribl god of the forest of the hellish and
mysteri motombo and perhap of the mother of the flower herself
will be there to do it rever if so what gift will thei bring to
those who stole and rear the sacr seed
psi shall know er long for just as i laid down my pen a triumphant
epistl from stephen wa hand to me in which he write excitedli that
at length two of the three plant ar show for flower
