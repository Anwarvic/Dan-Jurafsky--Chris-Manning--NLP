my dear clark
over twenti year have pass sinc we found some uniqu opportun
of observ boer and kaffir charact in compani therefor it is not
perhap out of place that i should ask you to allow me to put your name
upon a book which deal more or less with the peculiar of those
racesa tale of the great trek of 1836
you as i know entertain both for dutchman and bantu that regard
temper by a sens of respect superior which we ar apt to feel
for those who on sundri occas have but just fail in bring our
earthli career to an end the latter of these admir i share to the
full and in the case of the first of them as i hope that the dour but
not unkindli charact of vrouw botmar will prove to you time soften
a man judgment nor have i ever question as the worthi vrouw tell
us that in the begin of the troubl the boer met with much
of which to complain at the hand of english govern their
maltreat wa not intent inde but rather a result of
systemat neglectto us a mild wordof coloni and their
inhabit which ha culmin within our own experi onli
thank to a merci chang in public opinion to pass awai for ever
sympathi with the voortrekk of 1836 is easi whether it remain so in
the case of their descend the present master of the transvaal is
a matter that admit of mani opinion at the least allow should
alwai be made for the suscept of a race that find it
individu and nation life sink slowli but without hope of
resurrect beneath an invad flood of anglosaxon
but these ar issu of todai with which thi stori ha littl to do
without further explan then i hope that you will accept these
page in memori of past time and friendship and more especi of the
providenti event connect with a nightlong ride which onc we took

chapter i
why vrouw botmar tell her tale
it is a strang thing that i an old boer vrouw should even think
of begin to write a book when there ar such number alreadi in
the world most of them worthless and mani of the rest a scandal and
offenc in the face of the lord notabl is thi so in the case of those
call novel which ar stiff as mealiepap with li that fill the
head of silli girl with vain imagin caus them to neglect their
household duti and to look out of the corner of their ey at young
men of whom their elder do not approv in truth my mother and those
whom i knew in my youth fifti year ago when women were good and
worthi and never had a thought beyond their husband and their children
would laugh aloud could ani whisper in their dead ear that suzann
naud wa about to write a book well might thei laugh inde see
that to thi hour the most that i can do with men and ink is to sign
my own name veri larg in thi matter alon not be the equal of my
husband jan who befor he becam paralys had so much learn
that he could read aloud from the bibl leav out the name and long
word
no no i am not go to write it is my greatgranddaught who is
name suzann after me who write and who that had not seen her at the
work could even guess how she doe it i tell you that she ha brought
up from durban a machin about the size of a pumpkin which goe
taptaplik a woodpeck and print as it tap now my husband jan
wa alwai veri fond of music in hi youth and when first the girl
began to tap upon thi strang instrument he be almost blind and
not abl to see it thought that she wa plai on a spinet such
as stood in my grandfath hous awai in the old coloni the nois
pleas him and send him to sleep remind him of the dai when
he court me and i us to strum upon that spinet with on finger
therefor i am dictat thi histori that he mai have plenti of it and
that suzann mai be kept out of mischief
there that is my joke still there is truth in it for jan botmar my
husband he who wa the strongest man among the father of the great
trek of 1836 when like the israelit of old we escap from the
english our master into the wilder crouch in the corner yonder
a crippl giant with but on sens left to him hi hear and a
littl power of wander speech it is strang to look at him hi
white hair hang upon hi shoulder hi ey glaze hi chin sunk
upon hi breast hi great hand knot and helpless and to rememb
that at the battl of vechtkop when moselikats sent hi regiment to
crush us i saw those same hand of hi seiz the onli two zulu who
broke a wai into our laager and shake and dash them togeth till thei
were dead
well well who am i that i should talk for ha not the dropsi got hold
of my leg and did not that doctor who though an englishman is no
fool tell me but yesterdai that it wa creep up toward my heart
we ar old and soon must die for such is the will of god let us then
thank god that it is our lot to pass thu easili and in ag and not
to have perish in our youth as did so mani of our companion the
voortrekk thei and their children togeth by the spear of the
savag or by starvat and fever and wild beast in the wilder
ah i think of them often and in my sleep which ha grown light of
late i see them often and hear those voic that none but i would know
todai i think of them and i see them and sinc suzann ha the skill
to set down my word a desir come upon me to tell of them and
their deed befor god take me by the hand and i am born through the
dark by the wing of god
also there is anoth reason the girl suzann kenzi my
greatgranddaught who write thi alon is left of my blood sinc
her father and grandfath who wa our adopt son and the husband of
our onli child fell in the zulu war fight with the english against
cetywayo now mani have heard the strang stori of ralph kenzi the
english castawai and of how he wa found by our daughter suzann mani
have heard also the still stranger stori of how thi child of our
suzann in her need wa shelter by savag and for more than two
year live with sihamba the littl witch doctoress and ruler of the
tribe of the mountain till ralph her husband who love her sought
her out and rescu her that by the merci of the lord dure all thi
time had suffer neither harm nor violenc ye mani have heard of
these thing for in bygon year there wa much talk of them as of
event out of natur and marvel but few have heard them right
therefor befor i go i who rememb and know them all would set them
down that thei mai be a record for ever among my descend and the
descend of ralph kenzi my fosterson who have been brought up
amongst us boer wa the best and bravest englishman that ever live in
africa
and now i will tell of the find of ralph kenzi mani year ago
to begin at the begin my husband jan botmar is on of the
wellknown boer famili of that name the most of whom live in the
graafreinet district in the old coloni till some of them trek into
the transkei when i wa still a young girl to be as far as thei could
from the heart of the british power nor did thei trek for a littl
reason listen and judg
on of the bezuidenhout frederick wa accus of treat some
black slave of hi cruelli and a bodi of the accurs pandour
the hottentot whom the english had made into a regiment were sent to
arrest him he would not suffer that these black creatur should lai
hand upon a boer so he fled to a cave and fought there till he wa
shot dead over hi open grave hi brethren and friend swore to take
vengeanc for hi murder and fifti of them rais an insurrect thei
were pursu by the pandour and by burgher more law abid or more
cautiou till jan bezuidenhout the brother of frederick wa shot
also fight to the last while hi wife and littl son load the
rifl then the rest were captur and put upon their trial and to the
rage and horror of all their countrymen the brutal british governor of
that dai who wa name somerset order five of them to be hang
among them my husband father and uncl petit for merci avail
noth and these five were ti to a beam like kaffir dog yonder at
slagter nek thei who had shed the blood of no man ye ye it is
true for jan my man saw it he saw hi father and hi uncl hang
like dog when thei push them from the beam four of the rope
brokeperhap thei had been tamper with i know notbut still the
devil who murder them would show no merci jan ran to hi father and
cast hi arm about him but thei tore him awai
do not forget my son he gasp as he lai there on the ground with
the broken rope about hi neck nor did jan ever forget
it wa after thi that the botmar trek into the transkei and with
them some other famili amongst whom were the naud my parent here
in the transkei the widow botmar and my father were near neighbour
their stead be at a distanc from each other of about three hour
upon horseback or someth over twenti mile in those dai i mai sai
it without shame now i wa the prettiest girl in the transkei a great
deal prettier than my granddaught suzann there although some think
well of her look but not so well as she think of them herself for
that would be imposs i have been told that i have nobl french
blood in my vein though i care littl for thi be quit content to
be on of the boer who ar all of nobl blood at least i believ
that my greatgrandfath wa a french huguenot count who fled from hi
countri to escap massacr becaus of hi religion from him and hi
wife suzann so it is said we women of the naud get our beauti for
we have alwai been beauti but the loveliest of the race by far wa
my daughter suzann who marri the englishman ralph kenzi from which
time our good look have begun to fall off though it is true that he
wa no illfavour man
whatev the caus in my youth i wa not like the other boer girl
who for the most part ar stout heavi and slow of speech even befor
thei ar marri nor did i need to wear a kapj to keep a pink and
white face from burn in the sun i wa not tall but my figur wa
round and my movement were as quick as my tongu also i had brown
hair that curl and brown ey beneath it and full red lip which all
the young men of that districtand there were six of them who can be
countedwould have given their best hors to kiss with the saddl and
bridl thrown in but rememb thi suzann i never suffer them to
do so for in my time girl knew better what wa right
well among all these suitor i favour jan botmar the old crippl who
sit yonder though in those dai he wa no crippl but the properest
man a girl could wish to see my father wa against such a match for
he had the old french pride of race in him and thought littl of the
botmar famili as though we were not all the children of on godexcept
the black kaffir who ar the children of the devil but in the end he
gave wai for jan wa welltodo so after we had opsit togeth
sever time accord to our custom and burnt mani veri long
candl we were marri and went to live on a farm of our own at a
distanc for my part i have never regret it although doubtless i
might have done much better for myself and if jan did he ha been wise
enough not to sai so to me in thi countri most of us women must choos
a man to look afterit is a burden that heaven lai upon usso on
mai as well choos him on fanci and jan wa my fanci though why he
should have been i am sure i do not know well if he had ani wit left
he would speak up and tell what a bless i have been to him and how
often my good sens ha suppli the lack of hi and how i forgav him
ye and help him out of the scrape when he made a fool of himself
withbut i will not write of that for it make me angri and as like
as not i should throw someth at him befor i had finish which he
would not understand
it is customari among the boer for the suitor to sit up
alon at night with the object of hi choic should the
ladi favour him she light long candl but if he doe not
pleas her she produc end signifi therebi that she
prefer hi room to hi companyauthor
no no i do not regret it and what is more when my man di i shall
not be long behind him ah thei mai talk all these wise young peopl
but after all what is there better for a woman than to love some man
the good and the bad of him togeth to bear hi children and to share
hi sorrow and to try to make him a littl better and a littl less
selfish and unfortun than he would have been alon poor men without
us women their lot would be hard inde and how thei will get on in
heaven where thei ar not allow to marri is more than i can guess
so we marri and within a year our daughter wa born and christen by
the famili name of suzann after me though almost from her cradl
the kaffir call her swallow i am not sure why she wa a veri
beauti child from the first and she wa the onli on for i wa ill
at her birth and never had ani more children the other women with their
covei of eight and ten and twelv us to condol with me about thi
and get a sharp answer for their pain i had on which alwai shut
their mouth but i wont ask the girl here to set it down an onli
daughter wa enough for me i said and if it wasnt i shouldnt have
told them so for the truth is that it is best to take these thing as
we find them and whether it be on or ten to declar that that is just
as we would wish it i know that when we were on the great trek and i
saw the kinderchi of other dy of starvat or massacr in
dozen by the kaffir devil ah then i wa glad that we had no more
children heartach enough my ew lamb suzann gave me dure those
bitter year when she wa lost and when she di have live out her
life just befor her husband ralph kenzi went on commando with hi
son to the zulu war whither her death drove him ah then it ach for
the last time when next my heart ach it shall be with joi to find
them both in heaven
chapter ii
how suzann found ralph kenzi
our farm where we live in the transkei wa not veri far from the ocean
inde ani on seat in the kopj or littl hill at the back of the
hous from the veri top of which bubbl a spring of fresh water can
see the great roller strike the straight cliff of the shore and
spout into the air in cloud of white foam even in warm weather thei
spout thu but when the southeasterli gale blow then the sight and
the sound of them ar terribl as thei rush in from the black water
on after anoth for dai and night togeth then the cliff shiver
beneath their blow and the sprai fli up as though it were driven
from the nostril of a thousand whale and is swept inland in cloud
turn the grass and the leav of the tree black in it breath woe
to the ship that is caught in those breaker and ground against those
rock for soon noth is left of it save scatter timber shiver as
though by lightn
on winterit wa when suzann wa seven year oldsuch a southeast
gale as thi blew for four dai and on a certain even after the wind
had fallen have finish my household work i went to the top of the
kopj to rest and look at the sea which wa still rage terribl
take with me suzann i had been sit there ten minut or more
when jan my husband join me and i wonder why he had come for he
as brave a man as ever live in all other thing wa greatli afraid
of the sea and inde of ani water so afraid wa he that he did not
like the sight of it in it anger and would wake at night at the sound
of a stormy he whom i have seen sleep through the trumpet of
frighten eleph and the shout of a zulu impi
you think that sight fine wife he said point to the spout
foam but i call it the ugliest in the world almighti it turn my
blood cold to look at it and to think that christian men ay and women
and children too mai be pound to pulp in those breaker
without doubt the death is as good as anoth i answer not that i
would choos it for i wish to die in my bed with the predic sai
prayer over me and my husband weepingor pretend toat the foot
of it
choos it he said i had sooner be spear by savag or hang by
the english govern as my father wa
what make you think of death in the sea jan i ask
noth wife noth but there is that fool of a pondo
witchdoctoress down by the cattl kraal and i heard her tell a
stori as i went by to look at the ox that the snake bit yesterdai
what wa the stori
oh a short on she said she had it from the coast kaffirsthat far
awai up toward the mouth of the umzimbubu when the moon wa young
great gun had been heard fire on after the other minut by minut
and that then a ship wa seen a tall ship with three mast and mani
ey in iti suppos she meant porthol with the light shine
through themdrift on to the coast befor the wind for a storm wa
rage while streak of fire like red and blue lightn rush up
from her deck
well and then
and then noth almighti that is all the tale those wave which
you love to watch can tell the rest
most like it is some kaffir lie husband
mai be but amongst these peopl new travel faster than a good hors
and befor now there have been wreck upon thi coast child put down
that gun do you want to shoot your mother have i not told you that you
must never touch a gun and he point to suzann who had pick up
her father roerfor in those dai when we live among so mani
kaffir everi man went armedand wa plai at soldier with it
i wa shoot buck and kaffir papa she said obei him with a
pout
shoot kaffir were you well there will be a good deal of that to
do befor all is finish in thi land littl on but it is not work
for girl you should have been a boi suzann
i cant i am a girl she answer and i havent ani brother like
other girl why havent i ani brother
jan shrug hi shoulder and look at me
wont the sea bring me a brother went on the child for she had been
told that littl children came out of the sea
perhap if you look for on veri hard i answer with a sigh littl
know what fruit would spring from thi seed of a child talk
on the morrow there wa a great to do about the place for the black
girl whose busi it wa to look after suzann came in at breakfast
time and said that she had lost the child it seem that thei had gone
down to the shore in the earli morn to gather big shell such as ar
wash up there after a heavi storm and that suzann had taken with her
a bag made of springbuck hide in which to carri them well the black
girl sat down under the shadow of a rock leav suzann to wander to
and fro look for the shell and not for an hour or more did she get
up to find her then she search in vain for the spoor of the child
feet led from the sand between the rock to the pebbl shore abov
which wa cover with tough sea grass and there wa lost now at the
girl stori i wa frighten and jan wa both frighten and so angri
that he would have ti her up and flog her if he had found time but
of thi there wa none to lose so take with him such kaffir as he
could find he set off for the seashor to hunt for suzann it wa near
sunset when he return and i who wa watch from the stoep saw
with a shiver of fear that he wa alon
wife he said in a hollow voic the child is lost we have search
far and wide and can find no trace of her make food readi to put in my
saddlebag for should we discov her tonight or tomorrow she will
be starv
be comfort i said at least she will not starv for the cook girl
tell me that befor suzann set out thi morn she beg of her a
bottl of milk and with it some biltong and meal cake and put them in
her bag
it is strang he answer what could the littl maid want with
these unless she wa mind to make a journei
at time it come into the thought of children to plai truant
husband
ye ye that is so but prai god that we mai find her befor the moon
set
then while i fill the saddlebag jan swallow some meat and a fresh
hors have been brought he kiss me and rode awai in the twilight
oh what hour were those that follow all night long i sat there
on the stoep though the wind chill me and the dew wet my cloth
watch and prai as i think i never prai befor thi i knew
wellthat our suzann our onli child the light and joi of our home
wa in danger so great that the lord alon could save her the countri
where we live wa lone savag still roam about it who hate the
white man and might steal or kill her also it wa full of leopard
hyena and other beast of prei which would devour her worst of all
the tide on the coast were swift and treacher and it well might
happen that if she wa wander among the great rock the sea would
come in and drown her inde again and again it seem to me that i
could hear her deathcri in the sob of the wind
at length the dawn broke and with it came jan on glanc at hi face
wa enough for me she is not dead i gasp
i know not he answer we have found noth of her give me brandi
and anoth hors for the sun rise and i return to the search the
tide is down perhap we shall discov her among the rock and he
groan and enter the hous with me
kneel down and let us prai husband i said and we knelt down weep
and prai aloud to our god who seat in the heaven yet see and
know the need and grief of hi servant upon the earth prai that
he would piti our agoni and give us back our onli child nor bless
be hi name did we prai vainli for present while we still knelt
we heard the voic of that girl who had lost suzann and who all night
long had lain sob in the garden ground call to us in wild
accent to come forth and see then we rush out hope burn up
suddenli in our heart like a fire in dry grass
in front of the hous and not more than thirti pace from it wa the
crest of a littl wave of land upon which at thi moment the rai of the
rise sun struck brightli there ye there full in the glow of them
stood the child suzann wet disarrai her hair hang about her
face but unharm and smile and lean on her shoulder anoth
child a white boi somewhat taller and older than herself with a cry
of joi we rush toward her and reach her the first for my feet
were the swiftest i snatch her to my breast and kiss her whereon
the boi fell down for it seem that hi foot wa hurt and he could not
stand alon
in the name of heaven what is the mean of thi gasp jan
what should it mean answer the littl maid proudli save that i
went to look for the brother whom you said i might find by the sea if
i search hard enough and i found him though i do not understand hi
word or he mine come brother let me help you up for thi is our
home and here ar our father and mother
then fill with wonder we carri the children into the hous and
took their wet cloth off them it wa i who undress the boi and
note that though hi garment were in rag and foul yet thei were of a
finer stuff than ani that i had seen and that hi linen which wa soft
as silk wa mark with the letter r m also i note other thing
name that so swollen were hi littl feet that the boot must be cut
off them and that he wa wellnigh dead of starvat for hi bone
almost pierc hi milkwhit skin
well we clean him and have wrap him in blanket and softtan
hide i fed him with broth a spoon at a time for had i let him
eat all he would he wa so famish that i fear lest he should kill
himself after he wa somewhat satisfi sad memori seem to come
back to him for he cri and spoke in england repeat the word
mother which i knew again and again till present he drop
off to sleep and for mani hour slept without wake then littl by
littl i drew all the tale from suzann
it would seem that the child who wa veri venturesom and full of
imagin had dream a dream in her bed on the night of the dai when
she plai with the gun and jan and i had spoken togeth of the sea
she dream that in a certain kloof an hour ride and more awai from
the stead she heard the voic of a child prai and that although he
prai in a tongu unknown to her she understood the word which
were o father my mother is dead send some on to help me for i am
starv moreov look round her in her dream though she could
not see the child from whom the voic came yet she knew the kloof for
as it chanc she had been there twice onc with me to gather white
lili for the burial of a neighbour who had di and onc with her
father who wa search for a lost ox now suzann have live so
much with her elder wa veri quick and she wa sure when she woke in
the morn that if she said anyth about her dream we should laugh at
her and should not allow her to go to the place of which she had dreamt
therefor it wa that she made the plan of seek for the shell upon
the seashor and of slip awai from the woman who wa with her and
therefor also she beg the milk and the biltong
now befor i go further i would ask what wa thi dream of suzann
did she invent it after the thing to which it point had come to pass
or wa it verili a vision sent by god to the pure heart of a littl
child as aforetim he sent a vision to the heart of the infant samuel
let each solv the riddl as he will onli if it were noth but an
imagin why did she take the milk and food becaus we had been
talk on that even of her find a brother by the sea you mai
answer well perhap so let each solv the riddl as he will
when suzann escap from her nurs she struck inland and thu it
happen that her feet left no spoor upon the hard dry veldt soon she
found that the kloof she sought wa further off than she thought for
or perhap she lost her wai to it for the hillsid ar scar with
such kloof and it might well chanc that a child would mistak on for
the other still she went on though she grew frighten in the lone
wilder where great buck sprang up at her feet and baboon bark
at her as thei clamber from rock to rock on she went stop onli
onc or twice to drink a littl of the milk and eat some food till
toward sunset she found the kloof of which she had dream for a
while she wander about in it follow the bank of a stream till
at length as she pass a dens clump of mimosa bush she heard the
faint sound of a child voiceth veri voic of her dream now she
stop and turn to the right push her wai through the mimosa
and there beyond them wa a dell and in the centr of the dell a larg
flat rock and on the rock a boi prai the rai of the set sun
shine in hi golden tangl hair she went to the child and spoke to
him but he could not understand our tongu nor could she understand
hi then she drew out what wa left of the bottl of milk and some meal
cake and gave them to him and he at and drank greedili
by thi time the sun wa down and as thei did not dare to move in the
dark the children sat togeth on the rock clasp in each other
arm for warmth and as thei sat thei saw yellow ey stare at them
through the gloom and heard strang snore sound and were afraid at
length the moon rose and in it first rai thei perceiv stand and
walk within a few pace of them three tiger as we call leopard
two of them big and on halfgrown but the tiger did them no harm
for god forbad them thei onli look at them a littl and then slip
awai pur as thei went
now suzann rose and take the boi by the hand she began to lead him
homeward veri slowli sinc he wa footsor and exhaust and for the
last half of the wai could onli walk rest upon her shoulder still
through the long night thei crawl forward for the kopj at the back
of our stead wa a guid to suzann stop from time to time to rest
a while till at the break of the dawn with their last strength thei
came to the hous as ha been told
well it wa that thei did so for it seem that the searcher had
alreadi sought them in the veri kloof where thei were hidden without
see anyth of them behind the thick screen of the mimosa and
have onc sought doubtless thei would have return there no more for
the hill ar wide and the kloof in them mani
chapter iii
the stori of the shipwreck
what shall we do with thi boi whom suzann ha brought to us wife
ask jan of me that dai while both the children lai asleep
do with him husband i answer we shall keep him he is the lord
gift
he is english and i hate the english said jan look down
english or dutch husband he is of nobl blood and the lord gift
and to turn him awai would be to turn awai our luck
but how if hi peopl come to seek him
when thei come we will talk of it but i do not think that thei will
come i think that the sea ha swallow them all
after that jan said no more of thi matter for mani year inde i
believ that from the first he desir to keep the child he who wa
sonless
now while the boi lai asleep jan mount hi hors and rode for two
hour to the stead of our neighbour the heer van vooren thi van
vooren wa a veri rich man by far the richest of us outli boer and
he had come to live in these wild becaus of some bad act that he had
done i think that it wa the shoot of a colour person when he wa
angri he wa a strang man and much fear sullen in counten and
silent by natur it wa said that hi grandmoth wa a chieftai
among the red kaffir but if so the blood show more in hi son and
onli child than in himself of thi son who in after year wa name
swart piet and hi evil do i shall have to tell later in my stori
but even then hi dark face and savag temper had earn for him the
name of the littl kaffir
now the wife of the heer van vooren wa dead and he had a tutor for hi
boi piet a poor holland bodi who could speak english that man knew
figur also for onc when think that i should be too clever for
him i ask him how often the wheel of our big waggon would turn round
travel between our farm and capetown castl he took a rule and
measur the wheel then have set down some figur on a bit of paper
and work at them for a while he told me the answer whether it wa
right or wrong i did not know and said so whereon the poor creatur
grew angri and li in hi anger for he swore that he could tell how
often the wheel would turn in travel from the earth to the sun or
moon and also how far we were from those great lamp a thing that is
known to god onli who made them for our comfort it is littl wonder
therefor that with such unholi teach swart piet grew up so bad
well jan went to beg the loan of thi tutor think that he would
be abl to understand what the english boi said and in due cours the
creatur came in a pair of blue spectacl and ride on a mule for he
dare not trust himself to a hors afterward when the child woke up
from hi long sleep and had been fed and dress the tutor spoke with
him in that ugli english tongu of which i could never even bear the
sound and thi wa the stori that he drew from him
it seem that the boi who gave hi name as ralph kenzi though i
believ that realli it wa ralph mackenzi wa travel with hi
father and mother and mani other from a countri call india which is
on of those place that the english have stolen in differ part
of the world as thei stole the cape and natal and all the rest thei
travel for a long while in a big ship for india is a long wai off
till when thei were near thi coast a storm sprang up and after the
wind had blown for two dai thei were driven on rock a hundr mile or
more awai from our stead so fierc wa the sea and so quickli did the
ship break to piec that onli on boat wa got out which except for
a crew of six men wa fill with women and children in thi boat
the boi ralph and hi mother were given a place but hi father did
not come although the captain beg him for he wa a man of some
import whose life wa of more valu than those of common peopl
but he refus for he said that he would stop and share the fate of
the other men which show that thi english lord for i think he wa
a lord had a high spirit so he kiss hi wife and child and bless
them and the boat wa lower to the sea but befor anoth could be
got readi the great ship slip back from the rock upon which she hung
and sank for thi we heard afterward from some kaffir who saw it
and all aboard of her were drown mai god have merci upon them
when it wa near to the shore the boat wa overturn and some of those
in it were drown but ralph and hi mother were cast safe on the
beach and with them other then on of the men look at a compass and
thei began to walk southward hope doubtless to reach countri where
white peopl live all that befel afterward i cannot tell for the
poor child wa too frighten and bewild to rememb but it seem
that the men were kill in a fight with nativ who howev did not
touch the women and children after that the women and the littl on
di on by on of hunger and weari or were taken by wild beast
till at last none were left save ralph and hi mother when thei were
alon thei met a kaffir woman who gave them as much food as thei could
carri and by the help of thi food thei struggl on southward for
anoth five or six dai till at length on morn after their food
wa gone ralph woke to find hi mother cold and dead besid him
when he wa sure that she wa dead he wa much frighten and ran awai
as fast as he could all that dai he stagger forward till in the
even he came to the kloof and be quit exhaust knelt upon the
flat stone to prai as he had been taught to do and there suzann found
him such wa the stori and so piteou it seem to us that we wept as
we listen ye even jan wept and the tutor snivel and wipe hi
weak ey
that it wa true in the main we learn afterward from the kaffir a
bit here and a bit there inde on of our own peopl while search
for suzann found the bodi of ralph mother and buri it he said
that she wa a tall and noblelook ladi not much more than thirti
year of ag we did not dig her up again to look at her as perhap we
should have done for the kaffir declar that she had noth on
her except some rag and two ring a plain gold on and anoth of
emerald with a devic carv upon it and in the pocket of her gown a
littl book bound in red that prove to be a testament on the fly leaf
of which wa written in english flora gordon the gift of her mother
agn janei gordon on her confirm and with it a date
all these thing the kaffir brought home faithfulli also a lock of the
ladi fair hair which he had cut off with hi assegai that lock of
hair label in writingrememb it suzann when i am gonei in
the waggon box which stand beneath my bed the other articl suzann
here ha as is her right for her grandfath settl them on her
by will and with them on thing which i forgot to mention when we
undress the boi ralph we found hang by a gold chain to hi neck
where he said hi mother place it the night befor she di a larg
locket also of gold thi locket contain three littl pictur
paint on ivori on in each half of it and on with the plain gold
back on a hing between them that to the right wa of a handsom man in
uniform who ralph told me wa hi father and inde he left all thi
in write togeth with hi will that to the left of a love
ladi in a low dress who he said wa hi mother that in the middl a
portrait of the boi himself as anyon could see which must have been
paint not more than a year befor we found him thi locket and the
pictur my greatgranddaught suzann ha also
now as i have said we let that unhappi ladi lie in her rude grave
yonder by the sea but my husband took men and built a cairn of stone
over it and a strong wall about it and there it stand to thi dai for
not long ago i met on of the folk from the old coloni who had seen it
and who told me that the peopl that live in those part now rever
the spot know it stori also when some month afterward a
minist came to visit us we led him to the place and he read the
burial servic over the ladi bone so that she did not lack for
christian burial
well thi wreck made a great stir for mani were drown in it and
the english govern sent a ship of war to visit the place where it
happen but none came to ask us what we knew of the matter inde we
never learn that the frigat had been till she wa gone again so
it came about that the stori di awai as such stori do in thi sad
world and for mani year we heard no more of it
for a while the boi ralph wa like a haunt child at night and now
and again even in the daytim he would be seiz with terror and sob
and cry in a wai that wa piteou to behold though not to be wonder
at by ani who knew hi histori when these fit took him strang as
it mai seem there wa but on who could calm hi heart and that on
suzann i can see them now as i have seen them thrice that i rememb
the boi sit up in hi bed a stare of agoni in hi ey and the
sweat run down hi face damp hi yellow hair and talk
rapidli half in english half in dutch with a voic that at time
would rise to a scream and at time would sink to a whisper of the
shipwreck of hi lost parent of the black indian woman who nurs
him of the wilder the tiger and the kaffir who fell on them
and mani other thing by him sit suzann a soft kaross of jackal
skin wrap over her nightgown the dew of sleep still show upon
her childish face and in her larg dark ey by him she sit talk
in some word which for us have littl mean and in a voic now
shrill and now sink to a croon while with on hand she clasp hi
wrist and with the other stroke hi brow till the shadow pass from
hi soul and cling close to her he sink back to sleep
but as the year went by these fit grew rarer till at last thei ceas
altogeth sinc thank be to god childhood can forget it grief
what did not ceas howev wa the lad love for suzann or her love
for him which if possibl wa yet deeper brother mai love sister
but that affect howev true yet lack someth sinc natur
teach that it can never be complet but from the beginningy even
while thei were childrenthes twain were brother and sister friend
and friend lover and lover and so thei remain till life left them
and so thei will remain for ay in whatev life thei live their
thought wa on thought their heart wa on heart in them wa neither
variabl nor shadow of turn thei were each of each to each and
for each as on soul in their separ spirit as on flesh in their
separ bodi i who write thi am a veri old woman and though in
mani thing i am most ignor i have seen much of the world and of
the men who live in it yet i sai that never have i known ani marvel to
compar with the marvel and the beauti of the love between ralph kenzi
the castawai and my sweet daughter suzann it wa of heaven not of
earth or rather like everyth that is perfect it partook both of
earth and heaven ye ye it wander up the mountain path of earth
to the pure height of heaven where now it dwell for ever
the boi ralph grew up fair and brave and strong with keen grei ey and
a steadi mouth nor did i know ani lad of hi year who could equal him
in strength and swift of foot for though in youth he wa not over
tall he wa broad in the breast and had muscl that never seem to
tire now we boer think littl of book learn hold as we do
that if a man can read the holi word it is enough still jan and i
thought as ralph wa not of our blood though otherwis in all wai a
son to us that it wa our duti to educ him as much in the fashion of
hi own peopl as our circumst would allow therefor after he had
been with us some two year when on dai the holland tutor man with
the blue spectacl of whom i have spoken rode up to our hous upon
hi mule tell us that he had fled from the van vooren becaus he
could no longer bear wit to the thing that were practis at their
stead we engag him to teach ralph and suzann he remain with us
six year by which time both the children had got much learn from
him though how much it is not for me who have none to judg thei
learnt histori and read and write and someth of the english
tongu but i need scarc sai that i would not suffer him to teach
them to pry into the mysteri of god star as he wish to do for i
hold that such lore is impiou and akin to witchcraft of which i have
seen enough from sihamba and other
i ask thi holland more particularli why he had fled from the van
vooren but he would tell me littl more than that it wa becaus of
the wizardri practis there if i might believ him the heer
van vooren made a custom of entertain kaffir witch doctor and
doctoress at hi hous and of celebr with them secret and
devilish rite to which hi son swart piet wa initi in hi
presenc that thi last stori wa true i have no doubt inde see
that the event of after year prove it to have been so
well at last the holland left us to marri a rich old vrouw twenti
year hi senior and that is all i have to sai about him except that
if possibl i dislik him more when he walk out of the hous than
when he walk in though why i should have done so i do not know for
he wa a harmless bodi perhap it wa becaus he plai the flute
which i have alwai thought contempt in a man
chapter iv
the shadow of the englishmen
now i will pass on to the time when ralph wa nineteen or thereabout
and save for the lack of hair upon hi face a man grown sinc in our
climat young peopl ripen quickli in bodi if not in mind i tell
of that year with shame and sorrow for it wa then that jan and i
commit a great sin for which afterward we were punish heavili
enough
at the begin of winter jan trek to the nearest dorp some fifti
mile awai with a waggon load of meali and of buckskin which he and
ralph had shot purpos to sell them and to attend the nachtmahl or
feast of the lord supper i wa somewhat ail just then and did not
accompani him nor did suzann who stai to nurs me or ralph who
wa left to look after us both
fourteen dai later jan return and from hi face i saw at onc that
someth had gone wrong
what is it husband i ask did not the meali sell well
ye ye thei sold well he answer for that fool of an english
storekeep bought them and the hide togeth for more than their
valu
ar the kaffir go to rise again then
no thei ar quiet for the present though the accurs missionari of
the london societi ar do their best to stir them up and he made a
sign to me to ceas from ask question nor did i sai ani more till
we had gone to bed and everybodi els in the hous wa asleep
now i said tell me your bad new for bad new you have had
wife he answer it is thi in the dorp yonder i met a man who
had come from port elizabeth he told me that there at the port were two
englishmen who had recent arriv a scotch lord and a lawyer with
red hair when the englishmen heard that he wa from thi part of the
countri thei fell into talk with him sai that thei came upon a
strang errand it seem that when the great ship wa wreck upon thi
coast ten year ago there wa lost in her a certain littl boi who
if he had live would todai have been a veri rich nobl in scotland
wife you mai know who that littl boi wa without my tell you hi
name
i nod and turn cold all over my bodi for i could guess what wa
come
now for a long while those who were interest in him suppos that
thi lad wa certainli dead with all the other on board that ship but
a year or more ago how i know not a rumour reach them that on male
child who answer to hi descript had been save aliv and adopt
by some boer live in the transkei by thi time the properti and the
titl that should be hi had descend to a cousin of the child but
thi relat be a just man determin befor he took them to come
to africa and find out the truth for himself and there he is at port
elizabeth or rather by thi time he is on hi road to our place
therefor it would seem that the dai is at hand when we shall see the
last of ralph
never i said he is a son to us and more than a son and i will not
give him up
then thei will take him wife ye even if he doe not wish it for he
is a minor and thei ar arm with author
oh i cri it would break my heart and jan there is anoth
heart that would break also and i point toward the chamber where
suzann slept
he nod for none could live with them and not know that thi youth
and maiden love each other dearli
it would break your heart he answer and her heart ye and my
own would be none the better for the wrench yet how can we turn thi
evil from our door
jan i said the winter is at hand it is time that you and ralph
should take the cattl to the bushveldt yonder where thei will lie
warm and grow fat for so larg a herd cannot be trust to the kaffir
had you not better start tomorrow if these english meddler should
come here i will talk with them did suzann save the boi for them did
we rear him for them although he wa english think how you will feel
when he ha cross the ridg yonder for the last time you who ar
sonless and you must go about your task alon must ride alon and
hunt alon and if need be fight alon except for hi memori think
jan think
do not tempt me woman he whisper back in a hoars voic for
ralph and he were more to each other than ani father and son that i have
known sinc thei were also the dearest of friend do not tempt me
he went on the lad must himself be told of thi and he must judg
he is young but among us at nineteen a youth is a burgher grown with a
right to take up land and marri he must be told i sai and at onc
it is good i said let him judg but in the wicked of my heart
i made up my mind that i would find mean to help hi judgment for the
thought of lose him fill me with blind terror and all that night i
lai awak think out the matter
earli in the morn i rose and went to the stoep where i found
suzann drink coffe and sing a littl song that ralph had taught
her i can see her now as she stood in her pretti tightfit dress
a flower wet with dew in her girdl swing her kapj by it string
while the first rai of the sun glisten on the wave of her brown and
silklik hair she wa near eighteen then and so beauti that my
heart beat with pride at her loveli for never in my long life have
i seen a girl of ani nation who could compar with my daughter suzann
in look mani women ar sweet to behold in thi wai or in that but
suzann wa beauti everi wai ye and at all ag of her life as a
child as a maiden as a matron and as a woman draw near to eld she
wa alwai beauti if like that of the differ season her beauti
vari in shape she wa straight and tall and round lightfoot as
a buck delic in limb widebreast and slenderneck her face wa
rich in hue as a kloof lili and her eyesah no antelop ever had
ey darker tender or more appeal than were the ey of suzann
moreov she wa sweet of natur readi of wit and goodheartedy
even for the kaffir she had a smile
you ar up betim suzann i said when i had look at her a littl
ye mother i rose to make ralph hi coffe he doe not like that the
kaffir women should boil it for him
you mean that you do not like it i answer for i knew that ralph
thought littl of who made the coffe that he drank or if he did it wa
mine that he held to be the best and not suzann who in those dai
wa a careless girl think less of household matter than she should
have done
did swart piet come here yesterdai i ask i thought that i saw hi
hors as i walk back from the sea
ye he came
what for
she shrug her shoulder oh mother why do you ask me you know
well that he is alwai troubl me bring me present of flower
and ask me to opsit with him and what not
then you dont want to opsit with him
the candl would be short that i should burn with swart piet answer
suzann stamp her foot he is an evil man full of dark word and
wai and i fear him for i think that sinc hi father death he ha
becom wors and the most of the compani he keep is with those kaffir
witchdoctor
ah like father like son the mantl of elijah ha fallen upon elisha
but insid out well it is what i expect for sin and wizardri were
born in hi blood had you ani word with him
ye some i would not listen to hi sweet talk so he grew angri and
began to threaten but just then ralph came back and he went awai for
he is afraid of ralph
where ha ralph gone so earli i ask chang the subject
to the far cattlekra to look after the oxen which the kaffir
bargain to break into the yoke thei ar choos them thi morn
so he make a good boer for on of english blood doe he not and yet
i suppos that when he becom english again he will soon forget that he
wa ever a boer
when he becom english again mother what do you mean by that
sai she ask quickli
i mean that like will to like and blood to blood also that there mai
be a nest far awai which thi bird that we have cage should fill
a nest far awai mother then there is on here which would be left
empti in your heart and father i mean and drop her sunbonnet
she turn pale and press her hand upon her own ad oh speak
straight word to me what do you mean by these hint
i mean suzann that it is not well for ani of us to let our love wrap
itself too close about a stranger ralph is an englishman not a boer
he name me mother and your father father and you he name sister but
to us he is neither son nor brother well a dai mai come when he learn
to understand thi when he learn to understand also that he ha other
kindr true kindr far awai across the sea and if those bird call
who will keep him in the strang nest
ah she echo all dismai who will keep him then
i do not know i answer not a foster father or mother but i
forgot sai did he take hi rifl with him to the kraal
sure i saw it in hi hand
then daughter if you will get on a hors and if you can find ralph
tell him that i shall be veri glad if he can shoot a small buck and
bring it back with him as i need fresh meat
mai i stai with him while he shoot the buck mother
ye if you ar not in hi wai and do not stop too long
then without more word suzann left me and present i saw her
canter across the veldt upon her grei mare that ralph had broken for
her and wonder if she would find him and what luck he would have with
the hunt that dai
now it seem that suzann found ralph and gave him my messag and that
thei start togeth to look for buck on the strip of land which li
between the seashor and the foot of the hill where sometim the
blesbok and springbok us to feed in thousand but on thi dai there
were none to be seen for the dry grass had alreadi been burnt off so
that there wa noth for them to eat
if mother is to get her meat todai said ralph at length i think
that we must try the hill side for a duiker or a bushbuck
so thei turn inland and rode toward that veri kloof where year
befor suzann had discov the shipwreck boi at the mouth of thi
kloof wa a patch of marshi ground where the reed still stood thick
sinc be full of sap thei had resist the fire
that is a good place for a rietbuck said ralph if onli on could
beat him out of it for the reed ar too tall to see to shoot in them
it can be manag answer suzann do you go and stand in the neck
of the kloof while i ride through the reed toward you
you might get bog he said doubtfulli
no no brother after all thi drought the pan is noth more than
spongi and if i should get into a soft spot i will call out
to thi plan ralph at length agre and have ridden round the pan
which wa not more than fifti yard across he dismount from hi hors
and hid himself behind a bush in the neck of the kloof then suzann
rode in among the reed shout and sing and beat them with her
sjambock in order to disturb anyth that might be hidden there nor
wa her troubl in vain for suddenli with a shrill whistl of alarm by
the sound of which thi kind of antelop mai be known even in the dark
up sprang two rietbuck and dash awai toward the neck of the kloof
look larg as donkei and red as lion as thei vanish into the
thick cover so close were thei to suzann that her mare took fright and
rear but the girl wa the best horsewoman in those part and
kept her seat call the while to ralph to make readi for the buck
present she heard a shot and have quiet the mare rode out of the
reed and gallop round the dry pan to find ralph look foolish with
no rietbuck in sight
have you miss them she ask
no not so bad as that for thei pass within ten yard of me but
the old gun hung fire i suppos that the powder in the pan wa a littl
damp and instead of hit the buck in front i caught him somewher
behind he fell down but ha gone on again so we must follow him for
i dont think that he will get veri far
accordingli when ralph had reload hi gun which took some timefor
in those dai we had scarc anyth but flintlocksy it wa with
weapon like these that a hand of us beat the host of dingaan and
moselikatsethei start to follow the blood spoor up the kloof which
wa not difficult as the anim had bled much near to the top of the
kloof the trail led them through a thick clump of mimosa and there in
the dell beyond thei found the rietbuck ly dead ride to it thei
dismount and examin it
poor beast said suzann look how the tear have run down it face
well i am glad that it is dead and done with and she sigh and
turn awai for suzann wa a silli and tenderheart girl who
never could understand that the animalsy and the heathen kaffir
toower given to us by the lord for our us and comfort
present she start and said ralph do you rememb thi place
he glanc round and shook hi head for he wa wonder whether he
would be abl to lift the buck on to the hors without ask suzann to
help him
look again she said look at that flat stone and the mimosa tree
ly on it side near it
ralph drop the leg of the buck and obei her for he would alwai do
as suzann bade him and thi time it wa hi turn to start
almighti he said i rememb now it wa here that you found me
suzann after i wa shipwreck and the tiger stare at us through
the bough of that fallen tree and he shiver a littl for the sight
of the spot brought back to hi heart some of the old terror which had
haunt hi childhood
ye ralph it wa here that i found you i heard the sound of your
voic as you knelt prai on thi stone and i follow it god heard
that prayer ralph
and sent an angel to save me in the shape of a littl maid he
answer ad dont blush so red dear for it is true that ever
sinc that dai whenev i think of angel i think of you and whenev
i think of you i think of angel which show that you and the angel
must be close togeth
which show that you ar a wick and silli lad to talk thu to a boer
girl she answer turn awai with a smile on her lip and tear in
her ey for hi word had pleas her mind and touch her heart
he look at her and she seem so sweet and beauti as she stood
thu smile and weep togeth as the sun shine through summer
rain that so he told me afterward someth stir in hi breast
someth soft and strong and new which caus him to feel as though of
a sudden he had left hi boyhood behind him and becom a man ay and
as though thi freshfac manhood sought but on thing more from heaven
to make it perfect the live love of the fair maiden who until thi
hour had been hi sister in heart though not in blood
suzann he said in a chang voic the hors ar tire let them
rest and let us sit upon thi stone and talk a littl for though we
have never visit it for mani year the place is lucki for you and me
sinc it wa here that our live first came togeth
now although suzann knew that the hors were not tire she did not
think it need to sai him nai
chapter v
a love scene and a quarrel
present thei were seat side by side upon a stone suzann look
straight befor her for natur warn her that thi talk of their wa
not to be as other talk and ralph look at suzann
suzann he said at length
ye she answer what is it but he made no answer for though
mani word were bubbl in hi brain thei choke in hi throat and
would not come out of it
suzann he stammer again present and again she ask him what it
wa and again he made no answer now she laugh a littl and said
ralph you remind me of the bluejai in the cage upon the stoep which
know but on word and repeat it all dai long
ye he repli it is true i am like that jai for the word i
taught it is suzann and the word my heart teach me is suzann
andsuzann i love you
now she turn her head awai and look down and answer
i know ralph that you have alwai love me sinc we were children
togeth for ar we not brother and sister

then that is bad new for me she said who till todai have thought
otherwis
it is not true he went on and now hi word came fast enough that
i am your brother or that i love you as a brother we ar no kin and
if i love you as a brother that is onli on littl grain of my love for
youy onli as on littl grain is to the whole seashor of sand
suzann i love you asa a man love a maidand if you will it dear
all my hope is that on dai you will be my wife and he ceas suddenli
and stood befor her trembl for he had risen from the stone
for a few moment suzann cover her face with her hand and when she
let them fall again he saw that her beauti ey shone like the larg
star at night and that although she wa troubl her troubl made
her happi
oh ralph she said at length speak in a voic that wa differ
from ani he had ever heard her us a voic veri rich and low and full
oh ralph thi is new to me and yet to speak the truth it seem
as old asa that night when first i found you a desol starv
child prai upon thi stone ralph i do will it with all my heart
and soul and bodi and i suppos that i have will it ever sinc i
wa a woman though until thi hour i did not quit know what it wa i
will nai dear do not touch me or at the least not yet first hear
what i have to sai and then if you desir it you mai kiss meif onli
in farewel
if you will it and i will it what more can you have to sai he ask
in a quick whisper and look at her with frighten ey
thi ralph that our will who ar young and unlearn ar not all
the world that there ar other will to be thought of the will of our
parent or of mine rather and the will of god
for the first he answer i do not think that thei stand in our
path for thei love you and wish you to be happi although it is true
that i who am but a wander pick up upon the veldt have no fortun
to offer youstil fortun can be won he ad doggedli
thei love you also ralph nor do thei care over much for wealth
either of them and i am sure that thei would not wish you to leav us
to go in search of it
as for the will of god he continu it wa the will of god that i
should be wreck here and that you should save me here and that the
life you save should be given to you will it not therefor be the
will of god also that we who can never be happi apart should be happi
togeth and thank him for our happi everi dai till we die
i trust so ralph yet although i have read and seen littl i know
that veri often it ha been hi will that those who love each other
should be separ by death or otherwis
do not speak of it he said with a groan
no i will not speak of it but there is on more thing of which i must
speak strang enough onli thi morn my mother wa talk of you
she said that you ar english and that soon or late blood will call to
blood and you will leav us she said that your nest is not here but
there far awai across the sea among those english that you ar a
swallow that ha been fledg with sparrow and that on dai you will
find the wing of a swallow what put it in her mind to speak thu i do
not know but i do know ralph that her word fill me with fear and
now i understand why i wa so much afraid
he laugh aloud veri scornfulli then suzann he said you mai
banish your fear for thi i swear to you befor the almighti that
whoever mai be my true kin were a kingdom to be offer to me among
them unless you could share it it would be refus thi i swear
befor the almighti and mai he reject me if i forget the oath
you ar veri young to make such promis ralph she answer
doubtfulli nor do i hold them bind on you at nineteen so i am
told a lad will swear anyth to the girl who take hi fanci
i am young in year suzann but i grew old while i wa yet a child
for sorrow ag me you have heard my oath let it be put to the test
and you shall learn whether or no i speak the truth do i look like on
who doe not know hi mind
she glanc up at the steadi grei ey and the stern set mouth and
answer ralph you look like on who know hi mind and i believ
you prai god i mai not be deceiv for though we ar but lad and girl
if it prove so i tell you that i shall live my life out with a broken
heart
do not fear suzann and now i have heard what you had to sai and i
claim your promis if it be your will i will kiss you suzann but not
in farewel
nai she answer kiss me rather in greet of the full and
beauti life that stretch befor our feet whether the path be short
or long it will be good for us and ever better but ralph i think
that the end will be best of all
so he took her in hi arm and thei kiss each other upon the lip
and as thei told me afterward in that embrac thei found some joi
why should thei not inde for if anywher upon the earth if it be
given and receiv in youth befor the heart ha been sear and taint
with bitter and disillus sure in such a pledg as their true
joi can be found ye and thei did more than thi for kneel there
upon that rock where onc the starv child had knelt in bygon year
thei prai to him who had brought them togeth to him who had given
them heart to love with and bodi to be love and the immort
of heaven wherein to garner thi seed of love thu sown upon the earth
that he would guid them bless them and protect them through all
trial terror sorrow and separ as shall be seen thi inde
he did
then thei rose and have not without difficulti lift the rietbuck
ram upon ralph hors and made it fast there as our hunter know how
to do thei start homeward walk the most part of the wai for the
load wa heavi and thei were in no hast so that thei onli reach the
farm about noon
now i watch them as we sat at our middai meal grew sure that
someth out of the common had pass between them suzann wa veri
silent and from time to time glanc at ralph shyli whereon feel

would colour also as though with the knowledg of some secret that made
her both happi and asham

look at jan and saw that he wa make up hi mind to sai someth
for hi honest face wa troubl and now he took up hi pipe and now

coffe over the tabl

englishmen who have come to seek for ralph well i think that he mai
safe tell it now
then i look at ralph and saw that he also wa veri ill at eas
struggl with word which he did not know how to utter i note
moreov that suzann touch hi hand with her beneath the shelter of
the tabl as though to comfort and encourag him now watch these two
men at last i broke out laugh and said address them

that he could not hide as is to be expect of an ignor boi now i
am a man who ha seen the world and i know better and i tell you that
although thei ar an accurs race still it is a fine thing to be a
lord among the english ye ye i know the english lord i saw on
onc when i went to capetown he wa the governor there and drive
through the street in state dress as brave as a bluejai in hi
spring plumag while everybodi took off their hat to him except i
jan botmar who would not humbl myself thu yet to have such cloth
as that to wear everi dai while all the peopl salut you and make a
path for you is not a thing to be laugh at see boi it just come to
thi here you ar poor and littl there you mai be rich and much and
it is our duti not to stand in your road though it mai break our heart
to lose you so you had best make up your mind to go awai with the
damn scotchmen when thei come though i hope that you will think
kindli of us when you get to your own countri ye ye you shall

thoroughbr schimmel and my new black felt hat that i bought in the
dorp there that is done with prais be to god and i am go out
for thi place is so thick with smoke that i cant see my own hand and
he rose to go ad that if the two scotchmen did not want a bullet
through them it would be as well if thei kept out of hi wai when thei
came upon the farm
now in sai that the room wa thick with smoke jan li for both the
men pipe went out when thei began to talk but as i knew why he li
i did not think so much of it to tell the truth at that moment i could
see littl better than he could sinc although i would have poison
those two scotchmen befor i suffer them to take ralph awai the veri
thought of hi go wa enough to fill my ey with tear and to caus
suzann to weep aloud shamelessli
wait a bit fatheri beg your pardon jan botmar said ralph in a
clear and angri voic it is my turn now for you mai rememb that
when we began to talk i had someth to sai but you stop me now
with your leav as you have got off the hors i will get on

chapter vi

duti toward ralph whom god gave me out of the sea therefor if you
send awai ralph without a caus if he desir it i shall follow him as
soon as i am of ag and marri him or if you keep me from him by forc
then i think that i shall die that is all i have to sai
and quit enough too i answer though in my heart i like the
girl spirit and guess that she wa plai a part to prevent her
father from send awai ralph against hi will
all thi is pretti hear said jan stare from on to the other
why now that i think of it i never heard that you two were more than
brother and sister to each other sai you shameless girl when did all
thi come about and why do you dare to promis yourself in marriag
without my consent
becaus there wa no time to ask it father said suzann look
down for ralph and i onli spoke togeth thi morn
he spoke to you thi morn and now it seem that you ar readi to
forsak your father and your mother and to follow him across the world
you wick and ungrat child
i am not wick and i am not ungrat answer suzann it is you
who ar wick who want to send ralph awai and break all our heart
it is fals miss shout her father in answer for you know well
that i do not want to send him awai
then why did you tell him that he must go and take your roan hors and
new hat

him and be lost across the sea and choke she burst into tear while
her father mutter
why the girl ha becom like a tiger she who wa milder than a
sheep
hush suzann broke in ralph and you who have been father and
mother to me listen i prai you it is true that suzann and i love each
other veri dearli as we have alwai love each other though how much
we did not know till thi morn now i am a waif and a castawai whom
you have nurtur and have neither land nor good of my own therefor
you mai well think that i am no match for your daughter who is so
beauti and who if she outliv you will inherit all that you have
if you decid thu it is just howev hard it mai be but you tell me
though i have heard noth of it till now and i think that it mai be
but idl talk that i have both land and good far awai in england
and you bid me begon to them well if you turn me out i must go for
i cannot stai alon in the veldt without a hous or a friend or a
hoof of cattl but then i tell you that when suzann is of ag i shall
return and marri her and take her awai with me as i have a right to
do if she desir it for i will not lose everyth that i love in
the world at on stroke inde noth but death shall part me from
suzann therefor it come to thi either you must let me stai here
and poor as i am be marri to suzann when it shall pleas you or
if you dismiss me you must be readi to see me come back and take awai
suzann
suzann suzann i interrupt angrili for i grew jealou of the
girl have you no thought or word ralph for ani save suzann
i have thought for all he answer but suzann alon ha thought
for me sinc it seem that your husband would send me awai and you
mother sit still and sai not a word to stop him
learn to judg speech and not silenc lad i answer look you all
have been talk and i have sham dead like a stinkcat when dog
ar about now i am go to begin first of all you jan ar a fool
for in your thick head you think that rank and wealth ar everyth to
a man and therefor you would send ralph awai to seek rank and wealth
that mai or mai not belong to him although he doe not wish to go as
for you ralph you ar a bigger fool for you think that jan botmar
your fosterfath here desir to be rid of you when in truth he onli
seek your good to hi own sore loss as for you suzann you ar the
biggest fool of all for you wish to fly in everybodi face like a cat
with her first litter of kitten but there what is the us of argu
with a girl in love now listen and i will ask you some question all
of you jan do you wish to send ralph awai with these stranger
almighti vrouw he answer you know well that i would as soon send
awai my right hand i wish him to stop here for ever and whatev i
have is hi ye even my daughter but i seek what is best for him
and i would not have it said in after year that jan botmar had kept an
english lad not old enough to judg for himself from hi rank and wealth
becaus he took pleasur in hi compani and wish to marri him to hi
girl
good i said and now for you suzann what have you to sai
i have noth to add to my word she repli you know all my
heart
good again and you ralph
i sai mother that i will not budg from thi place unless i am
order to go and if i do go i will come back for suzann i love you
all and with you i wish to live and nowher els
nai ralph i answer sigh if onc you go you will never come
back for out yonder you will find a new home new interest and
perchanc new love well though nobodi ha thought of me in thi
matter i have a voic in it and i will speak for myself that lad
yonder ha been a son to me for mani year and i who have none love him
as such he is a man as we reckon in thi countri and he doe not wish
to leav us ani more than we wish him to go moreov he love suzann
and suzann love him and i believ that the god who brought them
togeth at first mean them to be husband and wife and that such love
as thei bear to each other will give them more togeth than ani wealth
or rank can bring to them apart therefor i sai husband let our son
ralph sai here with us and marri our daughter suzann decent and in
due season and let their children be our children and their love our
love
and how about the scotchmen who ar come with power to take him
awai
do you and ralph go to the bushveldt with the cattl tomorrow i
answer and leav me to deal with the scotchmen
well said jan i consent for who can stand up against so mani
word and the lord know that to lose ralph would have broken my heart
as it would have broken that girl perhap more so sinc girl chang
their fanci but i am too old to chang come here my children
thei came and he laid on of hi big hand upon the head of each of
them sai
mai the god in heaven bless you both who to me ar on as dear as the
other make you happi with each other for mani long year and mai he
turn asid from you and from us the punish that is due to all of us
becaus on account of our great love we ar hold you back ralph
from the home the kin and the fortun to which you were born then he
kiss each of them on the forehead and let them go
if there be ani punish for that which is no sin on my head be it
said ralph sinc never would i have gone from here by my own will
ay ay answer jan but who can take account of the talk of a lad
in love well we have commit the sin and we must bear the sorrow
now i go out to see to the kraal of the cattl which we will drive
off to the bushveldt tomorrow at dawn for i will have naught to do
with these scotchmen your mother must settl with them as she will
onli i beg of her that she will tell me noth of the bargain nai do
not come with me ralph stop you with your dear for tomorrow you will
be part for a while
so he went and did not return again till late and we three sat
togeth and made pretens to be veri happi but somehow were a littl
sad for jan word about sin and sorrow stuck in our heart as the
honest word of a stupid upright man ar apt to do
now on the morrow at dawn as had been arrang jan and ralph rode awai
to the warm veldt with the cattl leav me and suzann to look after
the farm three dai later the scotchmen came and then it wa that for
love of ralph and for the sake of the happi of my daughter i sin
the greatest sin of all my lifeth sin that wa destin to shape the
fate of other yet unborn
i wa seat on the stoep in the afternoon when i saw three white men
and some cape boi their servant ride up to the hous
here come those who would steal my boi from me i thought to myself
and like pharaoh i harden my heart
now in those dai my sight wa veri good and while the men were yet
some wai off i studi them all and made up my mind about them first
there wa a larg young man of fiveandtwenti or thereabout and i
note with a sort of fear that he wa not unlik to ralph the ey were
the same and the shape of the forehead onli thi gentleman had a weak
uncertain mouth and i judg that he wa veri goodhumour but of an
indol mind by hi side rode anoth man of quit a differ stamp
and middleag the lawyer i said to myself as i look at hi
weasellik face bushi eyebrow and red hair inde that wa an
easi guess for who can mistak a lawyer whatev hi race mai be that
trade is stronger than ani blood and leav the same seal on all who
follow it doubtless if those lawyer of whom the lord speak hard
thing in the testament were set side by side with the lawyer who draw
mortgag bond and practis usuri here in south africa thei would prove
to be as like to each other as ar the grain of corn upon on meali
cob ye when all dress the same thei stand togeth among the
goat on the last dai few inde will know them apart
a fool and a knave said i to myself well perhap i can deal with
the knave and then the fool will not troubl me
as for the third man i took no pain to studi him for i saw at onc
that he wa noth but an interpret
well up thei rode to the stoep the two englishmen take off their
hat to me after their foolish fashion while the interpret who
call me aunt although i wa younger than he wa ask for leav to
offsaddl accord to our custom i nod my head and have given
the hors to the cape boi thei came up onto the stoep and shook
hand with me as i sat i wa not go to rise to greet two englishmen
whom i alreadi hate in my heart first becaus thei were englishmen
and secondli becaus thei were about to tempt me into sin for such
sooner or later we alwai learn to hate
sit i said point to the yellowwood bench which wa seat with
strip of rimpi and the three of them squeez themselv into the
bench and sat there like whitebreast crow on a bough the young man
stare at me with a silli smile the lawyer peer thi wai and
that and turn up hi sharp nose at the place and all in it and the
interpret do noth at all for he wa a sensibl man who knew
the habit of wellbr peopl and how to behav in their presenc
after five minut or so the lawyer grew impati and said someth
in a sharp voic to which the interpret answer wait
so thei wait till just as the young man wa begin to go to sleep
befor my veri ey suzann came onto the verandah whereupon he woke
up in a hurri and jump off the bench began to bow and scrape and
to offer her hi seat for there wa no other
suzann i said take no notic of hi bad manner get coffe
and she went look less displeas at hi grimac than i would have
had her do
in time the coffe came and thei drank it or pretend to after
which the lawyer began to grow impati onc more and spoke to the
interpret who said to me that thei had come to visit us on a matter
of busi
then tell him that it can wait till after we have eaten i answer
it is not my habit to talk busi in the afternoon why is the lawyer
man so impati see that doubtless he is paid by the dai
thi wa translat and the lawyer ask how i knew hi trade
in the same wai that i know a weasel by it face and a stinkcat by it
smell i repli for everi minut i hate that advoc more
at thi answer the lawyer grew white with anger and the young lord
burst into a roar of laughter for as i have said these english peopl
have no manner howev thei settl themselv down again on the
yellowwood bench and look at me while i fold my hand sat
opposit and look at them for somewher about anoth hour as the
interpret told them that if thei move i should be offend and
for my part i wa determin that i would not speak to them of their
busi until suzann had gone to bed
at last when i saw that thei would bear it no longer for thei were
becom veri wrath and sai word that sound like oath i
call for supper and we went in and at it here again i notic the
resembl between the young man and ralph for he had the same trick
of eat and drink and i saw that when he had done hi meat he
turn himself a littl sidewai from the tabl cross hi leg in a
peculiar fashion just as it alwai had been ralph habit to do
the two had on grandfath or on grandmoth i said to myself and
grew afraid at the thought
chapter vii
the sin of vrouw botmar
when the meat wa clear awai i bade suzann go to bed which she did
most unwillingli for know the errand of these men she wish to hear
our talk as soon as she wa gone i took a seat so that the light of
the candl left my face in shadow and fell full on those of the three
mena wise thing to do if on is wick enough to intend to tell li
about ani matterand said
now here i am at your servic be pleas to set out the busi that
you have in hand
then thei began the lawyer speak through the interpret ask
ar you the vrouw botmar
that is my name
where is your husband jan botmar
somewher on the veldt i do not know where
will he be back tomorrow
no
when will he be back
perhap in two month perhap in three i cannot tell
at thi thei consult togeth and then went on
have you live with you a young englishman name ralph mackenzi
on name ralph kenzi live with us
where is he
with my husband on the veldt i do not know where
can you find him
no the veldt is veri wide if you wish to see him you must wait till
he come back
when will that be
i am not hi nurs and cannot tell perhap in three month perhap
six
now again thei consult and onc more went on
wa the boi ralph mackenzi or kenzi shipwreck in the india in
the year 1824
dear lord i cri affect to lose my patienc am i an old
kaffir wife up befor the landdrost for steal hen that i should be
crossquest in thi fashion set out all your tale at onc man
and i will answer it
thereon shrug hi shoulder the lawyer produc a paper which the
interpret translat to me in it were written down the name of the
passeng who were upon the vessel india when she sail from a place
call bombai and among the name those of lord and ladi glenthirsk and
of their son the honour ralph mackenzi ag nine then follow
the evid of on or two survivor of the shipwreck which state that
ladi glenthirsk and her son were seen to reach the shore in safeti in
the boat that wa launch from the sink ship after thi came a
paragraph from an english newspap publish in capetown date not
two year befor and head strang tale of the sea which paragraph
with some few error told the stori of the find of ralphthough how
the write man knew it i know not unless it wa through the tutor with
the blue spectacl of whom i have spokenand said that he wa still
live on the farm of jan botmar in the transkei thi wa all that wa
in the paper i ask to look at it and kept it sai in the morn
that the kaffir girl see it ly about the kitchen had us it
to light the fire but to thi dai it is with the other thing in the
waggon chest under my bed
when the paper wa done with the lawyer took up the tale and told me
that it wa believ in england that lord glenthirsk had been drown in
the sea as inde he wa and that ladi glenthirsk and her son perish
on the shore with the other women and children for so those sent by the
english govern to search out the fact had report thu it came
about that after a while lord glenthirsk younger brother wa admit
by law to hi titl and estat which he enjoi for some eight year
that is until hi death about a year befor he di howev someon
sent him the paragraph head strang tale of the sea and he wa much
disturb by it though to himself he argu that it wa noth but an
idl stori such as it seem ar often put into newspap the end of
the matter wa that he took no step to discov whether the tale were
true or fals and none knew of it save himself and he wa not mind
to go fish in that ugli water so it came about that he kept silent
as the grave till at length when the grave yawn at hi feet and
when the rank and the land and the wealth were of no more us to him
he open hi mouth to hi son and to hi lawyer the two men who sat
befor me and to them onli bid them seek out the begin of the
tale and if it were true to make restitut to hi nephew
nowfor all thi listen with my ear wide open and sometim
fill in what wa not told me in word i gather from the men befor
thei left the housea it chanc the dy lord could not have chosen
two wors peopl for such an errand see that although the son wa
honest both of them were interest in prove the tale to be fals
sinc that time howev often i have thought that he knew thi
himself and trust by the choic both to cheat hi own conscienc
and to preserv the wealth and digniti for hi son god to whom he ha
gone alon know the truth of it but with such a man it mai veri well
have been as i think i sai that both were interest for it seem as
he told me afterward that the lawyer wa to receiv a great sumten
thousand poundsund the will of the dead lord for whom he had done
much dure hi lifetim but if ralph were prove to be the heir thi
sum would have been hi and not the lawyer for the monei wa part
of hi father inherit therefor it wa worth just ten thousand
pound to that lawyer to convinc himself and the fals lord that ralph
wa not the man and therefor it wa that i found him so easi to deal
with
now after hi father wa dead the lawyer tri to persuad the son to
take no notic of hi dy word and to let the matter rest where it
wa see that he had noth to gain and much to lose but thi he
would not consent to for as i have said he wa honest declar that
he could not be easi in hi mind till he knew the truth and that if he
did not go to find it out himself he would send other to do so for him
as the lawyer desir thi least of anyth he gave wai and thei set
out upon their journeywhich in those dai wa a veri great journei
indeedarriv at last in safeti at our stead in the transkei for
whether he like it or not hi companionwho now wa call lord
glenthirskwould not be turn asid from the search or suffer him to
prosecut it alon
at length when all the tale wa told the lawyer look at me with hi
sharp ey and said through the interpret
vrouw botmar you have heard the stori tell us what you know is the
young man who live with you he whom we seek
now i thought for a second though that second seem like a year all
doubt had left me there wa no room for it ralph and no other wa the
man and on my answer might hang hi futur but i had argu the thing
out befor and made up my mind to lie though so far as i know it is
the onli lie i ever told and i am not a woman who often chang her
mind therefor i li
it is not he i said though for hi sake i might wish that it were
and thi i can prove to you
now when i had told thi great falsehood prompt to it by my love for
the lad and my love for suzann hi affianc wife my mind grew as it
were empti for a moment and i rememb that in the empti i seem
to hear a sound of laughter echo in the air somewher abov the roof
of the hous veri swiftli i recov myself and look at the men
i saw that my word rejoic them except the interpret inde who
be a paid servant come from far awai from the neighbourhood of
capetown i believ had no interest in the matter on wai or the other
beyond that of earn hi monei with as littl troubl as possibl
ye thei smile at each other look as though a great weight had
been lift off their mind till present the lawyer check himself
and said
be so good as to set out the proof of which you speak vrouw botmar
i will i answer but tell me first the ship india wa wreck
in the year 1824 wa she not
undoubtedli answer the lawyer
well have you heard that anoth ship call the flora travel
from the cape i know not whither wa lost on thi coast in the same
month of the follow year and that a few of her passeng escap
i have heard of it he said
good now look here and go to a chest that stood beneath the
window i lift from it the old bibl that belong to my grandfath
and father on the white page at the begin of which ar written the
record of mani birth marriag death and other notabl event that
had happen in the famili open it i search and point to a
certain entri inscrib in the big write of my husband jan and in ink
which wa somewhat faint for the ink that the trader sold us in those
dai had littl virtu in it beneath thi entri were other made by jan
in later year tell of thing that had happen to us such as the
death of hi greataunt who left him monei the outbreak of smallpox
on the farm and the number of peopl who di from it the attack of a
band of the red kaffir upon our hous when by the merci of god we beat
them off leav twelv of their dead behind them but take as mani
of our best oxen and so forth
read i said and the interpret read as follow
on the twelfth dai of septemb in the year 1825 the date be
written in letter our littl daughter suzann found a starv english
boi in a kloof who had been shipwreck on the coast we have taken him
in as a gift of the lord he sai that hi name is rolf kenzi
you see the date i said
ye answer the lawyer and it ha not been alter

chapter viii
the wisdom of suzann
now although suzann heard not a word of our talk still she grasp
it purport well enough for she knew that i propos to throw dust into
the ey of the englishmen thi troubl her conscienc sore for
the more she thought of it the more did it seem to her to be wick
that just becaus we love him and did not wish to part with him
ralph should be cheat of hi birthright all night long she lai awak
brood and befor ever the dawn broke she had settl in her mind
that she herself would speak to the englishmen tell them the truth
come what might of her word for suzann my daughter wa a determin
girl with an upright heart now feel happier becaus of her decis
at length she fell asleep and slept late and as it happen thi
accid of fate wa the caus of the miscarriag of her scheme
it came about in thi wai quit earli in the morningat sunup
indeedth englishmen rose and come out of the littl guestchamb
drank the coffe that i had made readi for them and talk togeth
for a while then the young lordralph cousinsaid that as thei
journei yesterdai at a distanc of about an hour on horseback from the
farm he had notic a larg vlei or pan where were mani duck and
also some antelop to thi vlei he propos to ride forward with on
servant onli and to stai there till the other overtook him shoot
the wild thing which live in the place for to be happi these
englishmen must alwai be kill someth so he bade me farewel
make me a present of the gold chain which he took off hi watch which
chain i still have then he rode awai smile after hi fashion and
as i watch him go i wa glad to think that he wa no knave but onli an
easi tool in the hand of other we never met again but i believ that
death finish hi stori mani year ago inde all those of whom i
tell ar dead onli jan and i surviv and our cours is wellnigh run
when suzann awok at length have heard from a kaffir girl that the
stranger had order their hors but not that the young lord had
ridden forward she slip from the hous silent fear lest i
should stai her and hid herself in a littl patch of bush at the corner
of the big meali field by which she knew the englishmen must pass on
their return journei present she heard them come and when she
saw that the young lord wa not with them she went to the lawyer who
pull up hi hors and wait for her the rest of the parti ride on
and ask where hi master wa sai that she wish to talk with him
and here i must sai if i have not said it befor that suzann could
speak english though not well the holland tutor had instruct her
in that tongu in which ralph also would convers with her at time
when he did not wish other to understand what thei were sai for he
never forgot hi mother languag though he mix mani dutch word with
it
he ha ridden forward an hour or more ago can i take ani messag to
him for you said the lawyer or if you wish to talk of busi to
speak to me is to speak to him
that mai be so answer suzann still i like to draw my water at
the fountain itself yet as he ha gone i beg you to listen to me for
when you have heard what i have to sai i think that you will bring him
back you came here about ralph kenzi did you not and my mother told
you that he is not the man whom you seek did she not
the lawyer nod
well i tell you that all thi tale is fals for he is the veri man
and she pour out the true stori of ralph and of the plot that had been
made to deceiv them about him
now as i have said suzann english wa none of the best and it is
possibl that the lawyer did not understand for my part howev i
think that he understood well enough for she told me afterward that is
face grew grei and anxiou as he listen and that at length he said
all thi you tell me is veri strang and weighti so much so that i
must bring my friend back to look more close into the matter return
now to the farm and sai noth of have met me for by thi even
or tomorrow at the latest we will come there again and sift out the
truth of thi question
to thi she agre be guileless and the lawyer rode awai after the
other all that dai and all the next suzann scarc spoke to me but
i saw that she wa expect someth to happen and that she glanc
continu toward the path by which the englishmen had journei
think to see them ride back to the farm but thei rode back no
more and i am sure that the cun lawyer never breath on word of
hi meet with suzann and of what took place at it to the young lord
that book wa shut and it did not pleas him to reopen it sinc to do
so might have cost him ten thousand pound on the third morn i found
suzann still look down the path and my patienc be exhaust by
her silenc i spoke to her sharpli
what ar you do girl i ask have we not had enough visitor of
late that you must stand here all dai await more
i seek no new visitor suzann said but those who have been here
onli and i see now that i seek in vain
what do you mean suzann
now of a sudden she seem to make up her mind to speak for she turn
and face me boldli sai
i mean mother that i told the englishman with the red hair the
agent that all the fine tale you spun to him about ralph wa fals and
that he wa the man thei came to find
you dare to do that girl i said then check myself and ad
well what did the man sai
he said that he would ride on and bring the young lord back that i
might talk with him but thei have not come
no nor will thei suzann for if thei sought thei did not wish to
find or at least the lawyer did not wish it for he had too much at
stake well thing have gone fine with you see that your hand
ar clean from sin and that ralph still stai at your side
the sin of the parent is the sin of the child she answer and then
of a sudden she took fire as it were and fell upon me and beat me with
her tongu nor could i hold my own befor thi girl of eighteen the
truth be that she had right on her side and i knew it she told me
that we were wick plotter who to pleasur ourselv had stolen from
ralph everyth except hi life and mani other such hard sai she
threw at me till at last i could bear it no more but gave her back word
for word inde it would be difficult to sai which had the best of
that quarrel for if suzann tongu wa the nimbler and her word were
wing with truth i had the weight of experi on my side and the
custom of author at last as she paus breathless i cri out
and for whose sake wa all thi done you ungrat chit if it wa
not for your own
if that wa so which is not altogeth true she answer it would
have pleas me better if rather than make me a partner in thi crime
and set me as bait to snare ralph you had left me to look after my own
welfar
what i exclaim ar you then so shallow heart that you were
readi to bid farewel to him who for mani year ha been as your
brother and is now your affianc husband you know well whatev he
might promis now that if onc he had gone across the sea to england
you would have seen him no more
no she answer grow calm of a sudden i wa not so prepar
for sooner would i die than lose ralph
how then do you squar thi with all your fine talk i ask
think that at length i had trap her if he had gone you must have
lost him
not so she answer innoc for i should have marri him
befor he went and then i could have been certain that he would return
here whenev i wish it
now when i heard thi i gasp partli becaus the girl clever
took the breath from me and partli with mortif that i should
have live to learn wisdom from the mouth of a babe and a suckl for
there wa no doubt of it thi plan of which i had not even thought
wa the answer to the riddl sinc by mean of it ralph might have kept
hi own and we i doubt not should have kept ralph onc marri to
suzann he would have return to her or if she had gone with him for
a littl while which might have been better she would certainli have
brought him back see that she love us and her home too well to
forsak them
ye i gasp and the onli answer that i could make when i reflect
how littl need there had been for the sin which we had sin wa to
burst into weep whereon suzann ran to me and kiss me and we made
friend again but all the same i do not think that she ever thought
quit so well of me afterward and if i thought the more of her still
i made up my mind that the sooner she wa marri and had a husband of
her own to preach to the better it would be for all of us
thu end the stori of the come of the englishmen and of how ralph
lost hi wealth and rank we never heard or saw more of them see
that in those dai befor the great trek we did not write letter
and if we had we should not have known where to send them nor did the
postcart pass the door twice a week as it doe in thi overcrowd land
of natal
now i must go on to tell of the do of that devil upon earth swart
piet and of how the littl kaffir witchdoctoress sihamba ngenyanga
which mean shewhowalksbythemoonlight becam the slave and saviour
of suzann
at thi time the heer van vooren swart piet father had been dead for
two year and there were strang stori as to the manner of hi death
which i do not think it necessari to set out here whether or no swart
piet did or did not murder hi father i cannot sai nor doe it matter
for at the least he work other crime as bad after the death of the
heer van vooren howev he mai have chanc to die thi is certain
that swart piet inherit great rich as we us to reckon rich in
those dai that is he had vast herd of cattl and goat and sleep
some of which were kept for him by nativ chief far awai as much land
as he want and it wa said a good sum in english gold but he wa
a strang man not like to other men for he marri no wife and court
no miss that is until he took to court suzann and hi onli
pleasur wa to keep the compani of kaffir chief and women and to mix
himself up with the devil of the witchdoctor still as everi man
ha hi fate at last he fell in love with suzann and in love with her
he remain dure all hi wick life if that can be love which seek
to persecut and bring miseri upon it object it wa just befor the
come of the englishmen that thi passion of hi manifest itself for
whenev he met the girloutsid the hous for the most part sinc
jan did not like to have him in ith made sweet speech and pass
foolish pleasantri which to be just i am sure suzann never
encourag sinc all her heart wa elsewher
now swart piet had inform of everyth for hi kaffir spi
brought it to him therefor he veri soon learn that jan and ralph had
gone awai with the cattl to the warm veldt and that we two women
were alon in the hous thi wa hi opportun and on of which he
avail himself for now two or three time a week he would ride
over from hi place take supper and ask leav to sleep which it wa
difficult to refus all thi time weari the poor girl with hi
attent at last i spoke my mind to him about it though not without
hesit for to tell truth swart piet wa on of the few men of whom
i have ever been afraid he listen to me polit and answer
all thi is veri true aunt but if you desir a fruit and it will not
fall then you must shake the tree
what if it stick to the bough i ask
then aunt you must climb the tree and pluck it
and what if by that time it is in anoth man pouch
then aunt he answer with on of those dark smile that turn my
blood cold then aunt the best thing which you can do is to kill the
other man and take it out for after that the fruit will tast all the
sweeter
get you gone swart piet i said in anger for no man who talk thu
shall stai in my hous and it is veri well for you that neither my
husband nor ralph kenzi ar here to put you out of it
well he answer thei ar not here ar thei and as for your
hous it is a pretti place but i onli seek on thing in it and that
is not built into the wall i thank you for your hospit aunt and
now gooddai to you
suzann i call suzann for i thought that she wa in her
chamber but the girl know that piet van vooren wa here had
slip out and of thi he wa awar he knew moreov where she had
gone for i think that on of hi kaffir servant wa watch outsid
and told him and thither he follow her and made love to her
in the endfor he would not be put offh ask her for a kiss
whereat she grew angri then for he wa no shy wooer he tri to take
it by forc but she wa strong and activ and slip from him instead
of be asham he onli laugh after hi uncanni fashion and said
well missi you have the best of me now but i shall win that kiss
yet oh i know all about it you love the english castawai dont you
but there a woman can love mani men in her life and when on is dead
anoth will serv her turn
what do you mean myn heer van vooren ask suzann afraid
mean noth but i shall win that kiss yet ye and befor veri
long
chapter ix
how suzann save sihamba
now in a vallei of the hill someth over an hour ride from the
farm and not far from the road that ran to swart piet place live
the littl kaffir witchdoctoress sihamba ngenyanga thi woman did not
belong to ani of the transkei or neighbour tribe but had drift
down from the north inde she wa of swazi or some such blood though
why she left her own peopl we did not know at that time in appear
sihamba wa veri strang for although healthi perfectli shape and
coppercolour rather than black she wa no taller than a child of
twelv year olda thing that made mani peopl believ that she wa a
bush woman which she most certainli wa not for a kaffir also she wa
pretti have fine small featur beauti white teeth and a fring
of wavi black hair that stood out stiffli round her head someth after
the fashion of the gold plate which the saint wear in the pictur in
our old bibl
thi woman sihamba who might have been a littl over thirti year of
ag had been live in our neighbourhood for some three or four year
and practis as a doctoress not that she wa a black doctoress for
she never took part in the smellingout of human be for witchcraft
or in the more evil sort of rite her trade wa to sell charm and
medicin to the sick also to cure anim of their ailment at which
inde she wa veri clever though there wa some who said that when
she chose she could throw the bone and tell the futur better than
most and thi without dress herself up in bladder and snake skin
or fall into fit or tranc and such mummeri lastli amongst the
nativ about and some of the boer too i am sorri to sai she had the
reput of be the best of rainmak and mani were the head of
cattl that she earn by prophesi the breakup of a drought or the
end of continu rain inde it is certain that no on whom i ever
knew had so great a gift of insight into the omen of the weather at all
season of the year as thi strang sihamba ngenyanga a name that
she got by the wai becaus of her habit of wander about in the
moonlight to gather the herb and the medicin root which she us in
her trade
on sever occas jan had sent anim to be doctor by thi
sihamba for she would not come out to attend to them whatev fee wa
offer to her at first i did not approv of it but as she alwai
cure the anim whatev their ailment might be i gave in on the
matter
now it happen that a few month befor some travel who had guest
at our hous gave suzann a littl roughhair dog bred of parent
which had been brought from england of thi dog suzann grew veri fond
and when it fell sick of the distemp she wa in much distress so
it came about that on afternoon suzann put the dog in a basket and
take with her an old hottentot to carri it set out upon her grei mare
for the vallei where sihamba live now sihamba had her hut and the hut
of the few peopl in her servic in a recess at the end of the vallei
so place that until you were quit on to them you would never have
guess that thei were there down thi vallei suzann rode the
hottentot with the basket on hi head trot by her side till turn
the corner she came upon a scene which she had veri littl expect in
on part of the open space beyond her herd by some kaffir were a
number of cattl sheep and goat opposit to them in the shadow under
the hillsid stood the hut of sihamba and in front of these grew a
larg tree beneath thi tree wa sihamba herself with scarc ani
cloth on her for she had been strip her tini wrist bound
togeth behind her back and a rope about her neck of which on end
wa thrown over a bough of the tree in front of her laugh brutal
stood none other than swart piet and with him a small crowd of men
mostli halfbre wander of the sort that trek from place to place
claim hospit on the ground of cousinship or poverti until thei
ar turn off as a nuisanc also there were present a few kaffir
either headmen in swart piet pai or some of hi dark associ in
witchcraft
at first suzann wa inclin to turn her hors and fly but she wa a
brave girl and the peril state of the littl doctoress move her to
piti for where swart piet wa there she suspect cruelti and wick
motiv so she rode on ye straight up to swart piet himself
in the name of heaven what pass here myn heer she ask
ah miss suzann is it you he answer well you have not chosen
a nice time for your visit for we ar about tohangthi thief and
witch who ha been duli convict after a fair trial
a fair trial said suzann glanc scornfulli at the rabbl about
her and were these friend of your the juri what is her offenc
her offenc is that she who live here on my land ha stolen my cattl
and hid them awai in a secret kloof it ha been prove against her by
ampl evid there ar the cattl yonder mix up with her own i as
veldcornet of the district have tri the case accord to law and
the woman have been found guilti must die accord to law
inde myn heer said suzann then if i understand you right you
ar both accus and judg and the law which permit thi is on that
i never heard of oh she went on angrili no wonder that the english
sing a loud song about us boer and our cruelti to the nativ when such
a thing as thi can happen it is not justic myn heer it is a
crime for which if you escap the hand of man god will bring you to
account
then for the first time sihamba spoke in a veri quiet voic which
show no sign of fear
you ar right ladi she said it is not justic it is a crime born
of reveng and my life must pai forfeit for hi wicked i am a free
woman and i have harm none and have bewitch none i have cure sick
peopl and sick creatur that is all the heer sai that i live upon
hi land but i am not hi slave i pai him rent to live here i never
stole hi cattl thei were mix up with mine by hi servant in a
faroff kloof in order to trump up a charg against me and he know it
for he gave order that the thing should be done so that afterward he
might have the joi of hang me to thi tree becaus he wish to be
aveng upon me for other matter privat matter between me and him
but ladi do not troubl yourself about the fate of such a poor
black creatur as i am go awai and tell the stori if you will but go
quickli for these sight of death ar not fit for young ey like your
to see
i will not go exclaim suzann or if i go it shall be to bring
down upon you swart piet the weight of the law which you have broken
ah would that my father were at home he doe not love kaffir but he
doe love justic
now when thei heard suzann speak such bold word and saw the fire
in her ey swart piet and those with him began to grow afraid the
hang of a witchdoctoress after a formal trial upon the charg of
theft of cattl wa no great matter in those dai for such theft
were common and a caus of much troubl to outli farmer nor would
anyon in these halfsettl region be like to look too close into
the right and wrong of an execut on account of them but if a white
person who wa present went awai to proclaim to the author perhap
even to the governor of the cape whose ear could alwai be won through
the missionari of the london societi that thi pretend execut
wa noth but a murder then the thing becam seriou from the moment
that suzann began to speak on behalf of sihamba swart piet had seen
that it would be imposs to hang her unless he wish to risk hi
own neck but he guess also that the girl could not know thi and
therefor he determin to make term by work on her piti such term
as should put her to shame befor all those gather there ye and
leav someth of a stain upon her heart for so long as she should
live
i do not argu law with young ladi he said with a littl laugh
but i am alwai readi to oblig young ladi especi thi young
ladi now yonder witch and cattlethief ha richli earn her doom
yet becaus you ask it suzann botmar i am readi to withdraw the
prosecut against her and to destroi the written record of it in my
hand on two condit of which the first is that she pai over to me
by wai of compens for what she ha stolen all her cattl and other
belong do you consent to that witch
how can i refus said sihamba with a bitter laugh see that if i
do you will take both life and good but what is the second condit
i am come to that witch but it ha noth to do with you suzann
it is thi that here befor all these peopl as the price of thi
thief life you give me the kiss which you refus to me the other
dai
now befor suzann could answer sihamba broke in eagerli nai ladi
let not your lip be stain and your heart be shame for the sake
of such as i better that i should die than that you should suffer
defil at the hand of swart piet who born of white blood and
black is fals to both and a disgrac to both
i cannot do it gasp suzann turn pale and not heed her
outburst and heer van vooren you ar a coward to ask it of me
cant you he sneer well you need not unless you pleas and
it is true that young women like best to be kiss alon here you
kaffir pull that littl devil up slowli now that she mai learn what
a tight string feel like about her throat befor it choke her
in obedi to hi command three of the evil fellow with him caught
hold of the end of the rope which hung over the bough and began to
pull drag the light form of sihamba upward till onli the tip of
her big toe touch the ground
doesnt she danc prettili said swart piet with a brutal laugh at
the same time motion to the men to keep her thu a while
now suzann look at the blacken lip and the littl form convuls
in it death struggl and could bear the sight no more
let her down she cri and spring from the saddl for all thi
while she had been seat upon her hors she walk up to piet sai
take what you seek but oh for your sake i wish to god that my lip
were poison
no no gasp sihamba who now wa ly half choke upon the ground
that is not our bargain dear said piet it is that you should kiss
me not i you
again suzann shrank back and again at hi signal the men began to
pull upon the rope then see it with her face as pale as death she
learn forward and touch hi lip with her whereon he seiz her
round the middl and draw her to him cover her with kiss till
even the brute with him call to him not to push hi jest too far and
to let the girl go thi he did utter word which i will not repeat
and so weak wa suzann with shame that when hi arm were taken from
her she fell to the ground and lai there till the old hottentot her
servant ran to her curs and weep with rage and help her to
her feet for a while she stood sai noth onli wipe her face as
though filth had bespatt it with the sun kapj which had fallen
from her head and her face wa whiter than the white cap at last she
spoke in a hoars voic
loos that woman she said who ha cost me my honour
thei obei her and snatch up her skin rug sihamba turn and fled
swiftli down the vallei then suzann went to her hors but befor she
mount it she look swart piet straight in the ey at the time
he wa follow her beg her not to be angri at a joke for hi
mad wa satisfi for a while and had left him but she onli look
in answer and there wa someth so terribl to him in the dark ey
of thi young unfriend girl that he shrank back see in them
perhap the shadow of fate to come then suzann rode awai and swart
piet have command hi ruffian to fire the hut of sihamba and to
collect her peopl good and cattl went awai also
just at the mouth of the vallei someth stir in a bush caus
the hors to start so that suzann who wa think of other thing
slip from it to the ground next moment she saw that it wa sihamba
who knelt befor her kiss her feet and the hem of her robe
rise she said kindli what ha been cannot be help and at least
it wa no fault of your
nai swallow said sihamba for i think i have said that wa the
name which the nativ had given to suzann from childhood i believ
becaus of the grace of her movement and her habit of run swiftli
hither and thithernai swallow in a wai it wa my fault
what do you mean sihamba
i mean swallow that although i am so small some have thought me
pretti and the real reason of black piet hate for me isbut why
should i defil your ear with the tale
thei would onli match my face if you did answer suzann grimli
but there is no need i can guess well enough
you can guess swallow then you will see why it wa my fault ye
ye you will see that what i a black woman who am less than dirt in
the ey of your peopl would not do to save my own life you a white
chieftai and the fairest whom we know have done of your own will
to keep it in me
if the act wa good answer suzann mai it go to my credit in the
book of the great on who made us
it will go to your credit swallow answer sihamba with passion
both in that book and in the heart of all who hear thi stori but
most of all in thi heart of mine oh listen ladi sometim a cloud
come over me and in that cloud i who wa born a doctoress see vision
of thing that ar to happen true vision among them i see thi that
mani moon henc and far awai i shall live to save you as you have save
me but between that dai and thi the cloud of the futur is black to my
ey black but live
it mai be so answer suzann for i have heard that you have the
sight and now farewel you had best seek out some friend among your
peopl and hide yourself
my peopl said sihamba then i must seek long for thei ar veri
veri far awai nor do thei desir to see me
why not
becaus as it chanc i am by blood their ruler for i am the onli
child of my father headwif but thei would not have me set over them
as chieftai unless i marri a man and toward marriag i have no
wish for i am differ from other women both in bodi and heart so
have quarrel with them on thi and anoth matter of polici i set
out to seek my fortun and left them to their
your fortun wa not a good on sihamba for it led you to swart piet
and the rope
nai ladi it led me to the swallow and freedom no not to freedom but
to slaveri for i am your slave whose life you have bought at a great
price now i have noth left in the world swart piet ha taken my
cattl which i earn cow by cow and bred up heifer by heifer and save
for the wit within my brain and thi kaross upon my shoulder i have
noth
what then will you do sihamba
what you do swallow that i shall do for am i not your slave bought
at a great price i will go home with you and serv you ye to my
life end
that would pleas me well enough sihamba but i do not know how it
would pleas my father
what pleas you pleas him swallow moreov i can save my food
twice over by cure hi cattl and hors in sick for in such
need i have skill
well she said come and when my father return we will settl how

the oath of sihamba
suzann came home and told me her stori and when i heard it i wa like
a mad woman inde it would have gone ill with swart piet ey and
hair if i could have fallen in with him that night
wait till your father return girl i said
ye mother she answer i wait for himand ralph
what is to be done with the littl doctoress sihamba i ask
ad i do not like such peopl about the place
let her bide also till the men come back mother she answer and
then thei will see to it meanwhil there is an empti hut down by the
cattl kraal where she can live
so sihamba stop on and becam a bodi servant to suzann the best i
ever saw though she would do no other work save that of attend to
sick anim
ten dai afterward jan and ralph return safe and sound leav some
kaffir in charg of the cattl in the bushveldt veri glad we were to
see them sinc put everyth els asid it wa lone work for
two women upon the place with no neighbour at hand and in those dai to
be lone meant to be in danger
when we were togeth jan first question to me wa
have those englishmen been here
thei have been here i answer and thei have gone awai
jan ask me noth more of the matter for he did not wish to know
what had pass between us onli he look at me queerli and as i
think thought the wors of me afterward for he found out that
suzann and i had quarrel about the song i sang in the ear of the
englishmen and what that song wa he could guess veri well ye ye
although he had been a parti to the fraud in hi heart jan put all the
blame of it upon me for that is the wai of men who ar mean and alwai
love to sai the woman tempt me a vile habit which ha come down to
them with their blood
meanwhil anoth talk wa pass between ralph and suzann thei had
rush to meet each other like two separ colt bred in the same
meadow but when thei came togeth it wa differ ralph put out hi
arm to embrac her but she push him back and said no not until we
have spoken togeth
thi is a cold greet said ralph amaz and trembl for he
fear lest suzann should have chang her mind as to their marriag
what is it that you have to tell me speak on quickli
two thing ralph she answer and take the least of them first
she plung straightwai into a full account of the come of the
englishmen of all that had pass then and of her quarrel with me upon
the matter
and now ralph she end you will understand that you have been
cheat of your birthright and thi i think it just that you should
know so that if you will you mai chang your mind about stai here
for there is yet time and follow these englishmen to wherev it is
thei have gone to claim from them your heritag
ralph laugh and answer why sweet i thought that we had settl
all thi long ago that your mother did not tell the men quit the truth
is possibl but if she plai with it it wa for the sake of all of us
and with my leav let them go and the fortun with them for even if i
could come to england and find it there i should be but as a wild
buck in a sheep kraal out of place and unhappi moreov we should be
separ dear for even if you would all consent i could never take
you from your own peopl and the land where you were born so now that
there is an end to thi onc and for ever let me kiss you in greet
suzann
but she shook her head and deni him sai no for i have anoth
tale to tell you and an uglierso ugli inde that after the hear
of it i doubt much whether you will wish to kiss me ani more
be swift with it then he answer for you torment me and she
began her stori
she told how that after he had gone awai swart piet began to persecut
her how he had wish to kiss her and she had refus them so that he
left her with threat then she paus suddenli and said
and now befor i finish the stori you shall swear an oath to me you
shall swear that you will not attempt to kill swart piet becaus of it
at first he would swear noth for alreadi he wa wild with anger
against the man whereupon she answer that she would tell him noth
at last when thei had wrangl for a while he ask her in a hoars
voic sai now suzann have you come to ani harm at the hand of thi
fellow
no she answer turn her head awai god be thank i have come
to no harm of my bodi but of my mind i have come to great harm
now he breath more freeli and said
veri well then on with your stori for i swear to you that i will not
try to kill swart piet becaus of thi offenc whatev it mai be
so she went on set out everyth exactli as it had happen
and befor she had finish ralph wa as on who is brain sick for he
ground hi teeth and stamp upon the earth like an angri bull at last
when suzann had told him all she said
now ralph you will understand why i would not let you kiss me befor
you had heard my stori it wa becaus i fear that after hear it
you would not wish to kiss me ani more
you talk like a foolish girl he answer take her into hi arm
and embrac her and though the insult can onli be paid back in
blood i think no more of it than if some beast had splash mud into
your face which you had wash awai at the next stream
ah she cri you swore that you would not try to kill him for thi
offenc
ye sweet i swore and i will keep my oath thi time i will not try
to kill swart piet
then thei went into the hous and ralph spoke to jan about thi matter
of which inde i had alreadi told him someth jan also wa veri
angri and said that if he could meet piet van vooren it would go
hard with him afterward he ad howev that thi piet wa a veri
danger man and on whom it might be well to leav alon especi
as suzann had taken no real hurt from him
nowadai and here in natal such a villain could be made to answer
to the law either for attempt the life of the kaffir or for the
assault upon the girl or for both but in those time it wa differ
then the transkei had but few white peopl in it live far apart nor
wa there ani law to speak of inde each man did what wa right in
hi own ey accord to the good or evil that wa in hi heart
therefor as jan said it wa not well to make a deadli enemi of on
who wa restrain by the fear of neither god nor man and who had great
wealth and power sinc it might come about that he would work murder in
reveng or rais the kaffir on us as he who had author among them
could do veri easili inde as will be seen he did both these thing
or tri to do them
when hi anger had cool a littl jan spoke to us in thi sens and we
women agre with him but ralph who wa young fearless and full of
rage set hi mouth and said noth
as for sihamba jan wish to send her awai but suzann who had grown
fond of her beg him that he would not do so at least until he
had spoken with her so he order on of the slave to fetch her and
present the littl woman came and have salut him sat herself
down on the floor of the sit room after the kaffir fashion she wa
a strang littl creatur to see in her fur kaross and bead broider
girdl but for a nativ she wa veri clean and pretti with her wise
woman face set upon a bodi that had it been less round might almost
have been that of a child also she had adorn herself with great care
not in the castoff cloth of white peopl but after her own manner
for her wavi hair which stood out from her head wa powder over with
that sparkl blue dust which the kaffir women us and round her neck
she wore a singl string of larg blue bead
at first jan spoke to her crossli sai
you have brought troubl and disgrac upon my hous sihamba and i
wish you to begon from it
it is true she answer but not of my own will did i bring the
troubl o father of swallow for so she alwai call jan inde for
sihamba suzann wa the centr of all thing and thu in her mouth the
three of us ha no other name than father or mother or lover of
swallow
that mai be so answer jan but doubtless black piet who hate
you will follow you here and then we shall be call upon to defend
you and there will be more troubl
it is not i whom black piet will follow she repli for he ha
stolen all i have and as my life is safe there is noth more to get
from me and she look at suzann
what do you mean sihamba speak plain word said jan
i mean she answer that it is not i who am now in danger but my
mistress the swallow for he who ha kiss her onc will wish to kiss
her again
now at thi ralph curs the name of swart piet aloud and jan answer
it is a bullet from my roer that he shall kiss if he tri it that i
swear
i hope it mai be so said sihamba yet father of swallow i prai you
send me not awai from her who bought me at a great price and to whom my
life belong look i cost you but littl to keep and that littl i
can earn by doctor your hors and cattl in which art i have some
skill as you know well moreov i have mani ey and ear that can see
and hear thing to which your ar deaf and blind and i tell you that i
think a time will come when i shall be abl to do servic to all of you
who ar of the nest of the swallow now if she bid me to go i will
gofor am i not her servant to obeyyet i beseech you do not so
command her
sihamba had risen as she spoke and now she stood befor jan her head
thrown back look up into hi ey with such strang power that
though he wa great and strong and had no will to it yet he found
himself forc to look down into her more as he told me afterward
he saw mani thing in the ey of sihamba or it mai be that he thought
that he saw them for jan wa alwai somewhat superstiti at least
thi is true that more than onc dure the terribl after year when
some great event had happen to us he would cry out i have seen thi
place or thing befor i know not where then if i bade him think he
would answer now i rememb it wa in the ey of sihamba that i saw
it yonder in the transkei befor ralph and suzann were marri
present she freed hi ey and turn her head whereon jan grew pale
and swai as though he were about to fall recov himself howev
he said shortli
stai if you will sihamba you ar welcom for so long as it shall
pleas you
she lift her littl hand and salut him and i notic that it wa
after anoth fashion to that of the kaffir who live thereabout
after the zulu fashion inde
i hear your word chief she said and i stai though i be but a
lizard in the thatch yet the nest of the swallow shall be my nest and
in the fang of the lizard sihamba there is poison and woe to the hawk
of the air or the snake of the grass that would rob thi nest wherein
you dwell listen now to my oathyou whom she love cold shall thi
heart be and stiff thi hand empti shall thi head be of thought and
these ey of sight befor shame or death shall touch the swift wing
of yonder swallow who stain her breast for me rememb thi alwai
you whom she love that while i live i sihamba ngenyanga sihamba the
walker by moonlight she shall live and if she di i will die also
then onc more she salut and went leav us wonder for we saw
that thi woman wa not altogeth as other kaffir ar and it came
into our mind that in the time of need she would be as is a sharp spear
in the hand of on who is beset with foe
that night as we lai ab i talk with jan sai
husband i think there ar cloud upon our sky which for mani year
ha been so blue troubl gather round us becaus of the beauti of
suzann and i fear swart piet for he is not a man to be stop by a
trifl now ralph love suzann and suzann love ralph and though
thei ar young thei ar man and woman full grown abl to keep a hous
and bear it burden why then should thei not marri with as littl
delai as mai be for when onc thei ar wed van vooren will ceas from
troubl them know hi suit to be hopeless
as you will wife as you will jan answer somewhat sharpli but i
doubt if we shall get rid of our danger thu for with you i think that
the tide of our live ha turn and that it set toward sorrow ay
he went on sit up in the bed and i will tell you when it turn
it turn upon the dai that you li to the englishmen
chapter xi
a fight and a shot
earli the next morn i sought for ralph to speak to him on the
matter of hi marriag which to tell truth i long to see safe
accomplish but i could not find him anywher or learn where he had
gone though on of the slave told me that thei had seen him mount hi
hors at the stabl
i went down to the cattl kraal to look if he were there and as i
return i saw sihamba seat by the door of her hut engag in comb
her hair and powder it with the shine blue dust
greet mother of swallow she said whom do you seek
you know well i answer
ye i know well at the break of dawn he rode over yonder rise
why i ask
how can i tell why but swart piet live out yonder
had he hi gun with him i ask again and anxious
no there wa noth but a sjambock a veri thick sjambock in hi
hand
then i went back to the hous with a heavi heart for i wa sure that
ralph had gone to seek piet van vooren though i said noth of it
to the other so it prove inde ralph had sworn to suzann that he
would not try to kill piet but here hi oath end and therefor
he felt himself free to beat him if he could find him for he wa
altogeth mad with hate of the man now he knew that when he wa at
home it wa swart piet habit to ride of a morn accompani by on
kaffir onli to visit a certain vallei where he kept a larg number of
sheep thither ralph made hi wai and when he reach the place he saw
that although it wa time for them to be feed the sheep were still
in their kraal baa stamp and try to climb the gate for
thei were hungri to get at the green grass
so thought ralph swart piet mean to count the flock out himself
thi morn he will be here present
half an hour afterward he came sure enough and with him the on kaffir
as wa usual then the bar of the gate were let down and the sheep
suffer to escap through them swart piet stand upon on side and
the kaffir upon the other to take tale of their number when all the
sheep were out and on of the herd had been brought befor him and
beaten by the kaffir becaus some lamb were miss swart piet turn
to ride homeward and in a littl gorg near by came face to face with
ralph who wa wait for him now he start and look to see if he
could escap but there wa no wai of do it without shame so he rode
forward and bid ralph gooddai boldli ask him if he had ever seen a
finer flock of sheep
i did not come here to talk of sheep answer ralph ey him
is it of a lamb then that you come to talk heer kenzi a ew lamb
the onli on of your flock sneer piet for he had a gun in hi hand
and he saw that ralph had none
ay said ralph it is of a white ew lamb whose fleec ha been
soil by a bastard thief who would have stolen her and he look at
him
i understand said piet coldli for he wa a bold man and now heer
kenzi you had best let me ride by
why should i let you ride by when i have come out to seek you
for a veri good reason heer kenzi becaus i have a gun in my hand
and you have none and if you do not clear the road present it mai go
off
a good reason inde said ralph and on of which i admit the
weight and he drew to on side of the path as though to let piet pass
which he began to do hold the muzzl of the gun in a line with the
other head ralph sat upon hi hors stare moodili at the ground as
though he wa try to make up hi mind to sai someth or other but
all the time he wa watch out of the corner of hi quick ey just as
swart piet drew past him and wa shake the rein to put hi hors to
a canter ralph slid from the saddl and spring upon him like light
he slip hi strong arm round him and drag him backward to the
ground over the crupper of the hors as piet fell he stretch out
hi hand to grip the saddl and save himself so that the gun which he
carri rest on hi knee drop upon the grass ralph seiz it
and fire it into the air then he turn to face hi enemi who by thi
time had found hi feet
now we ar more equal match myn heer van vooren he said and
can talk further about that ew lamb the onli on of the flock nai
you need not look for the kaffir to help you for he ha run after your
hors and at the best he will hardli dare to thrust himself between two
angri white men come let us talk myn heer
black piet made no answer so for a while the two stood face each
other and thei were a strang pair as differ as the light from the
dark ralph fairhair greyei sternfac with thin
nostril that quiver like those of a wellbr hors narrowflank
broadchest though somewhat slight of limb and bodi for he wa but
young and had scarc come to a man weight but lith and wiri as a
tiger piet taller and more massiv for he had the ag of him by five
year with round kaffir ey black and cruel coars black hair that
grew low upon hi brow full red lip the lower droop so that the
larg white teeth and a line of gum could be seen within greatlimb
he wa also firmfoot and bullstrength show hi face the
cruelti and the cun of a black race mingl with the mind and
masteri of the white an evil and a terribl man know no lord
save hi own passion and no religion but black witchcraft and vile
superstit a foe to be fear inde but on who love better to
stab in the dark than to strike in the open dai
well myn heer van vooren mock ralph you could fling your arm
about a helpless girl and put her to shame befor the ey of men now
do the same by me if you can and he took on step toward him
what is thi monkei chatter ask piet in hi slow voic is it
becaus i gave the girl a kiss that you would fix a quarrel upon me
have you not done as much yourself mani time and for a less stake than
the life of on who ha been doom to die
if i have kiss her answer ralph it is with her consent and
becaus she will be my wife but you work upon her piti to put her to
shame and now you shall pai the price of it do you see that whip and
he nod toward the sjambock that wa ly on the grass let him who
prove the best man us it upon the other
will be your wife sneer piet the wife of the english castawai
she might have been but now she never shall unless she care to wed
a carcas cut into rimpi you want a flog and you shall have it
ye to the death but suzann shall benot your wife but
he got no further for at that moment ralph sprang at him like a wild
cat stop hi foul mouth with a fear blow upon the lip then
there follow a dread struggl between these two black piet rush
again and again strive to clasp hi antagonist in hi great arm and
crush him wherea ralph who like all englishmen love to us hi
fist and knew that he wa no match for piet in strength sought
to avoid him and plant blow after blow upon hi face and bodi thi
inde he did with such success that soon the boer wa cover with
blood and bruis again and again he charg at him roar with pain
and rage and again and again ralph first struck and then slip to on
side
at length piet turn came for ralph in leap back caught hi foot
against a stone and stumbl and befor he could recov himself
the iron arm were round hi middl and thei were wrestl for the
masteri
still at the first it wa ralph who had the best of it for he wa
skil at the game and befor swart piet could put out hi full
strength he trip him so that he fell heavili upon hi back ralph
still lock in hi arm but he could not keep him there for the boer
wa the stronger moreov as thei fought thei had work their wai up
the steep side of the kloof so that the ground wa against him thu it
came about that soon thei began to roll down hill fix to each other as
though by rope and gather speed at everi turn doubtless the end
of thi would have been ralph defeat and perhap hi death for i
think that furiou as he wa black piet would certainli have kill
him had he found himself the master but it chanc that hi hand wa
stai and thu near the bottom of the slope lai a sharp stone and
as thei roll in their fierc struggl piet head struck against thi
stone so that for a few moment he wa render helpless feel
the grip of hi arm loosen ralph freed himself and run to the
sjambock snatch it from the ground now piet sat up and stare at
him stupidli but he made no effort to renew the fight whereon ralph
gasp
i promis you a flog but sinc it is chanc that ha conquer
you more than i i will take no advantag of it save thi and he
struck him onc or twice across the face with the whip but not so as to
draw blood and ad now at least i am free from a certain promis
that i madethat i would not kill youand should you attempt further
harm or insult toward suzann botmar kill you i will piet van
vooren
at first swart piet did not seem to feel the blow but present he
awok as it were and touch hi cheek where the sjambock had struck
him as though to assur himself that he wa not dream some evil
dream then he spoke in a hollow unnatur voic you have won for
thi time ralph kenzi he said or rather fate fight for you
ha won but it would have been better for you and your dear also if
you had never struck those blow for i tell you ralph kenzi that as
your whip touch me someth broke in my brain and now i think that i
am mad
mad or bad it is all on to me repli ralph you have had your
warn and you had best keep sane enough to rememb it then turn
he went to hi hors which wa stand close by mount and rode
awai the other answer him noth
still ralph did not get home without anoth adventur for when he had
gone a littl wai he came to a stream that ran from a hillsid which wa
thick with tree and here he stop to doctor hi hurt and bruis
sinc he did not wish to appear at the hous cover with blood now
thi wa a foolish enough thing to do see the sort of man with
whom he had to deal and that there wa bush where anyon could hide
to within a hundr and twenti yard of hi wash place so it prove
inde for just as ralph had mount hi hors and wa about to ride
on he felt a sharp sting pain across hi shoulder as though
someon had hit him on the back with a stick and heard the sound of
a gunshot fire from the cover of the bush for there abov the green
leav hung a cloud of smoke
that is swart piet who ha crept round to cut me off ralph thought to
himself and for a moment wa mind to ride to the smoke to seek him
then he rememb that he had no gun and that that of hi enemi might
be load again befor he found him and judg it wisest to canter into
the open plain and so homeward of the hurt which he had taken from the
bullet he thought littl yet when he reach the hous it wa seen that
hi escap had been narrow inde for the great ball had cut through
hi cloth beneath hi shoulder so that thei hung down leav hi
back nake also it had furrow the skin caus the blood to flow
copious and make so horribl a sight of him that suzann nearli
faint when she saw it for my part i made certain that the lad wa
shot through the bodi although as it turn out in a week except for
some sore he wa as well as ever
now thi matter caus no littl stir among us and jan wa so angri
that without sai a word to anyon he mount hi hors and take
some arm servant with him set out to seek black piet but not to
find him for the man had gone nobodi knew whither inde thi wa as
well or so we thought at the time for though jan is slow to move when
onc he is move he is a veri angri man and i am sure that if he had
met piet van vooren that dai the grass would have been richer by the
blood of on or both of them but he did not meet him and so the thing
pass over for afterward we rememb that ralph had been the
aggressor sinc no on would take count of thi stori of the kiss of
a girl and also that there wa no proof at all that it wa piet who had
attempt hi life as that shot might have been fire by anyon
now from thi dai forward suzann went in terror of swart piet and
whenev ralph rode he rode arm for though it wa said that he had
gone on on of hi long journei trade among the kaffir both of them
guess that thei had not seen the last of van vooren jan and i were
afraid also for we knew the terribl natur of the man and of hi
father befor him and that thei came of a famili which never forgot a
quarrel or left a desir ungratifi
about fourteen dai after ralph had been shot at and wound a kaffir
brought a letter for jan which on be open prove to have been
written by swart piet or on hi behalf sinc hi name wa set at the
bottom of it it read thu
to the heer jan botmar
wellbelov heer thi is to tell you that your daughter suzann
hold my heart and that i desir to make her my wife as it is not
conveni for me to come to see you at present i write to ask you that
you will consent to our betroth i will make a rich woman of her as i
can easili satisfi you and you will find it better to have me as a dear
soninlaw and friend than as a stranger and an enemi for i am a good
friend and a bad enemi i know there ha been some talk of love between
suzann and the english foundl at your place but i can overlook
that although you mai tell the lad that if he is impertin to me
again as he wa the other dai he will not for the second time get off
with a whip onli be so good as to give your answer to the bearer
who will pass it on to those that can find me for i am travel about
on busi and do not know where i shall be from dai to dai give also
my love to suzann your daughter and tell her that i think often of
the time when she shall be my wife
i am wellbelov heer your friend
piet van vooren
now when ralph had finish read thi letter aloud for it had been
given to him as the best scholar among us you might have thought there
were four crazi peopl in the room so great wa our rage jan and ralph
said littl inde although thei look white and strang with anger
and suzann not over much for it wa i who talk for all of them
what is your answer girl ask her father present with an angri
laugh
tell the heer piet van vooren she repli smile faintli that if
ever hi lip should touch my face again it will be onli when that face
is cold in death oh ralph she cri turn to him suddenli and
lai her hand upon hi breast it mai be that thi man will bring
troubl and separ on us inde my heart warn me of it but
whatev chanc rememb my word dead i mai be but faith i shall
bey to death and through death
son take pen and write said jan befor ralph could answer so ralph
wrote down these word as jan told them to him
piet van vooren
sooner would i lai my onli child out for burial in the grave than lead
her to the hous of a colour man a consort with witchdoctor and
black women and a wouldb murder that is my answer and i add
thi to it set no foot within a mile of my hous for here we shoot
straighter than you do and if we find you on thi place by the help of
god we will put a bullet through your carcas
at the foot of thi write which he would not suffer to be alter
jan print hi name in big letter then he went out to seek the
messeng whom he found talk to sihamba and have given him the
paper bade him begon swiftli to wherev it wa he came from the man
who wa a strong redcolour savag mark with a white scar across
the left cheek and nake except for hi moocha and the kaross roll up
upon hi shoulder took the letter hid it in hi bundl and went
jan also turn to go but i who had follow him and wa watch him
although he did not know it saw him hesit and stop
sihamba he said why were you talk to that man
becaus it is my busi to know of thing father of swallow and i
wish to learn whenc he came
did you tell you then
not altogeth for someon whom he fear ha laid a weight upon
hi tongu but i learn that he live at a kraal far awai in the
mountain and that thi kraal is own by a white man who keep wive
and cattl at it although he is not there himself just now the rest i
hope to hear when swart piet send him back again for i have given the
man a medicin to cure hi child who is sick and he will be grate
to me
how do you know that swart piet sent the man ask jan
she laugh and said sure that wa easi to guess it is my busi
to twine littl thread into a rope

sihamba he said i have seen you talk to that man befor i
rememb the scar upon hi face
the scar upon hi face you mai rememb she answer but you have
not seen us talk togeth for until thi hour we never met

who ha vision mai see them in the glass of my ey
chapter xii
what the cow show zinti
twelv dai pass and on morn when i went out to feed the
chicken i saw the red kaffir with the scar on hi face seat beyond
the stoep take snuff
what is it i ask
a letter he answer give me a paper
i took it into the hous where the other were gather for breakfast
and as befor ralph read it it wa to thi effect
wellbelov heer botmari have receiv your honour letter and i
think that the unchristian spirit which it show cannot be pleas to
our lord still as i seek peac and not war i take no offenc nor
shall i come near your place to provok the shed of the blood of
men i love your daughter but if she reject me for anoth i have
noth more to sai except that i hope she mai be happi in the life she
ha chosen for me i am leav thi part of the countri and if you
heer botmar like to bui my farm i shall be happi to sell it to you at
a fair price or perhap the heer kenzi will bui it to live on after he
is marri if so he can write to me by thi messeng farewel
now when thei heard thi letter the other look more happi but for
my part i shook my head see guil in it sinc the tone of it wa
too humbl for swart piet there wa no answer to it and the messeng
went awai but not as i learn befor he had seen sihamba it seem
that the medicin which she gave him had cure hi child for which he
wa so grate that he drove her down a cow in payment a fine beast
but veri wild for handl wa strang to it moreov it had been
but just separ from it calf still although she question him
close the man would tell sihamba but littl of the place where he
live and noth of the road to it
here i will stop to show how great wa the cun of thi woman and
yet how simpl the mean wherebi she obtain the most of her knowledg
she desir to learn about thi hidingplac sinc she wa sure that it
wa on of the secret haunt of swartpiet but when she ask him the
messeng grew deaf and blind and she could find no on els who knew
anyth of the matter still she wa certain that the cow which had
been brought to her would show the wai to it home if there were
anybodi to follow it thither and make report of the path
now when sihamba had been rob and sentenc to death by swart piet
the most of her servant and peopl who live with her had been taken
by him as slave still two or three had escap either then or
afterward and settl about in the neighbourhood of the farm where
thei knew that their mistress dwelt from among these peopl who still
did her servic she chose a young man name zinti who although he
wa suppos to be stupid wa still veri clever about mani thing
especi the rememb of ani path that he had onc trodden and of
everi kopj stream or pan by which it could trace thi youth she
bade to herd the cow which had been given her tell him to follow it
whithersoev it should wander even if it led him a ten dai journei
and when he saw that it had reach home to return himself without
be seen and to give to her an exact report of the road which it had
travel
now all happen as sihamba expect for on the first dai that the cow
wa turn out watch by the lad who wa provid with food and a
blanket so soon as it had fill itself it start straight over the
hill run at time and at time stop to graze till night came
on then it lai down for a while and it herd besid it for he had
ti hi wrist to it tail with a rimpi lest it should escap in the
dark
at the first break of the light the cow rose fill itself with
grass and start forward on it homeward path follow by zinti for
three dai thei travel thu the herd milk the cow from time to
time when it udder wa full on the even of the third dai howev
the beast would not lie down but walk forward all night low now
and again by which zinti who found it difficult to keep it in sight
becaus of the dark guess that it must be near it home so it
prove inde for when the sun rose zinti saw a kraal befor him
hidden awai in a secret vallei of the mountain over which thei had been
travel still follow the cow though at a distanc he move
down toward the kraal and hid himself in a patch of bush present the
cattl were let out to graze and the cow rush to them low loudli
till a certain calf came to it which it made much of and suckl for
it wa it own calf
now zinti errand wa done but still he lai hid in the bush a while
think that he might learn some more and ly thu he fell asleep
for he wa weari with travel when he woke the sun wa high and he
heard women talk to each other close by him as thei labour at
their task of cut wand such as ar us for the make of hut
he rose to run awai then thought better of it and sat down again
rememb that should he be found it would be easi to tell them that
he wa a wander who had lost hi path present on of the women
ask
for whom doe bullhead build thi fine new hut in the secret krantz
yonder
now zinti open hi ear wide for he knew that thi wa the name which
the nativ had given to swart piet take it from hi round head and
fierc ey accord to their custom when thei note ani peculiar in
a man
i do not know answer a second woman who wa young and veri pretti
unless he mean to bring anoth wife here if so she must be a
chief daughter sinc men do not build such hut for girl of common
blood
perhap said the other but then i think that he ha stolen her from
her father without payment els he would not wish to hide her awai in
the secret krantz well let her come for we women must work hard here
where there ar so few men and mani hoe clean a field quickli
for my part i think there ar enough of us alreadi said the young
girl look troubl for she wa swart piet last kaffir wife and
did not desir to be supplant by a new favourit but be silent i
hear bullhead come on hi hors and she began to work veri hard at
cut the wand
a few minut later zinti saw swart piet himself ride up to the women
who salut him call him chief and husband
you ar idl he said ey them angrili
these wand ar tough to cut husband murmur the young woman in
excus
still you must cut them quicker girl he answer if you would not
learn how on of them feel upon your back it will go hard with all of
you if the big hut is not finish in seven dai from now
we will do our best said the girl but who is to dwell in the hut
when it is done
not you be sure of that he answer roughli nor ani black woman
for i am weari of you on and all listen i go tomorrow with my
servant to fetch a chieftai a white ladi to rule over you but if
ani of you speak a word of her presenc here you will pai for it for i
shall turn you awai to starv do you understand
we hear you husband thei repli somewhat sullenli for now thei
understood that thi new wife would be a mistress and not a sister to
them
then be care that you do not forget my word andhearkenso soon
as you have cut a full load of hutpol let two of you carri them up
to the krantz yonder where thei ar want but be care that no on
see you go in or come out
we hear you husband thei said again whereon swart piet turn and
rode awai
now although zinti wa said to be foolish chiefli as i think becaus
he could not or would not work yet in mani wai he wa clever than
most kaffir and especi alwai did he desir to see new place the
more so if thei chanc to be secret place therefor when he heard
swart piet command the women to carri the rod for the hidden krantz he
determin that he would follow them and thi he did so skilfulli that
thei neither heard nor saw him at first he wonder whither thei could
be go for thei walk straight to the foot of what seem to be an
unclimb wall of rock more than a hundr feet high on the face of
thi rock howev shrub grew here and there like the bristl on the
back of a hog and have first glanc round to see that no on wa
watch them the women climb to on of these shrub which wa
root in the cliff about the height of a man abov the level of the
ground and vanish so quickli that zinti who as watch rub hi
ey in wonder after wait a while howev he follow in their
step to find that behind the shrub wa a narrow cleft or crack such as
ar often to be seen in cliff and that down thi cleft ran a pathwai
which twist and turn in the rock grow broader as it went till
at last it end in the hidden krantz thi krantz wa a veri beauti
spot about three morgen or six english acr in extent and wall all
round with impass cliff down the face of on of these cliff fell
a waterfal form a deep pool out of which a stream ran and on the
bank of thi stream the new hut wa be built in such a posit that
the heat of the sun could strike it but littl
while he wa take note of these and other thing zinti saw some of
those who were work at the hut leav it and start to walk toward the
cleft so have learnt everyth that he could he thought it wa time
to go and slip awai back to the bush and thenc homeward by the
road which the cow had shown him
now it chanc that as he went zinti pierc hi foot with a larg
thorn so that he wa onli abl to travel slowli on the fifth night of
hi journei he limp into a wood to sleep which wood grew not much
more than two hour on horseback from our farm when he had been asleep
for some hour he woke up for all hi food wa done and he could not
rest well becaus of hi hunger and wa astonish to see the light of
a fire among the tree at some distanc from him toward thi fire he
crept think that there were herd or travel who would give him
food but when he came to it he did not ask for ani sinc the first
thing he saw wa swart piet himself walk up and down in front of the
fire while at some distanc from it lai a number of hi men asleep in
their kaross present anoth man appear slip through the tree
trunk and come to swart piet salut him
tell me what you have found out he said
thi baa answer the man i went down to heer botmar place and
beg a bowl of meal there pretend that i wa a stranger on a
journei to court a girl at a distant kraal the slave gave me meal
and some flesh with it and i learn in talk with them that the heer
botmar hi vrouw hi daughter suzann and the young englishman
heer kenzi all rode awai yesterdai to the christen parti of the
firstborn of the heer roozen who live about five hour on horseback
to the north yonder i learn also that it is arrang for them to
leav the heer roozen tomorrow at dawn and to travel homeward by
the tiger nek in which thei will offsaddl about two hour befor
middai for i forgot to sai that thei have two servant with them to
see to their hors
that make six in all said swart piet of whom two ar women
wherea we ar twenti ye it is veri good noth could be better
for i know the offsaddl place by the stream in tiger nek and it
is a nice place for men to hide behind the rock and tree listen
now for the plan and be sure you understand it when these peopl ar
offsaddl and eat their food you kaffir will fall on themwith
the spear and the kerri alon mindand thei will come to their end
doe the master mean that we ar to kill them ask the man
doubtfulli
ye answer swart piet with some hesit i do not want to
kill them inde but i see no other wai except as regard the girl of
cours who must be save these peopl ar to be attack and rob
by kaffir for it must never be known that i had a hand in it and
you brute of kaffir alwai kill therefor thei must die ala
especi the englishman though so far as i am concern i should
be glad to spare the other if i could but it cannot be done without
throw suspicion upon me as for the girl if she is harm the live
of all of you pai for it you will throw a kaross over her head and
bring her to the place which i will tell you of tomorrow where i shall
come upon you with some men and seem to rescu her do you understand
and do you think the plan good
i understand and i think the plan goodfor youand yet baa there
is on thing that i have not told you which mai mar it
what is it
thi when i wa down there at the heer botmar place i saw the
witchdoctoress sihamba who ha a hut upon the farm i wa some wai
off but i think that she recognis me as she might well do see
that it wa i who set the rope about her neck when you wish to hang
her now if she did know me all your plan mai be in vain for that
woman ha the sight and she will guess them even when the cord wa
round her she laugh at me and told me that i should die soon but
that she would live for year and therefor i fear her more than anyon
live
she laugh at you did she said swart piet well i laugh at her
for neither she nor anyon who breath shall stand between me and thi
girl who ha prefer the suit of anoth man to mine
ah master said the kaffir with admir you ar a great on
for when a fruit pleas you you do not wait for it to drop into your
lap you pluck it
ye said swart piet strike hi breast with pride if i desir a
fruit i pluck it as my father did befor me but now go you and sleep
for tomorrow you will need all your wit and strength
when the herd zinti had heard thi talk he crept awai head straight
for the farm but hi foot wa so bad and he wa so weak from want of
food that he could onli travel at the pace of a lame ox now hop
upon on leg and now crawl upon hi knee in thi fashion it wa
that at length about halfpast eight in the morn he reach the
hous or rather the hut of sihamba for she had sent him out and
therefor to her after the kaffir fashion he went to make report now
when he came to sihamba he greet her and ask for a littl food
which she gave him then he began to tell hi stori begin as
nativ do at the first of it which in hi case were all the wander
of the cow which he had follow so that although she hurri him much
mani minut went by befor he came to that part of the tale which told
of what he had heard in the wood some eight hour befor
so soon as he began to speak of thi sihamba stop him and call
to a man who linger near she bade him bring to her jan famou young
hors the roan schimmel bridl but not saddl now thi hors wa
the finest in the whole district for hi sire wa the famou stallion
which the govern import from england where it won all the race
and hi dam the swiftest and most endur mare in the breed herd at
the paarl what jan gave for him as a yearl i never learn becaus
he wa afraid to tell me but i know that we were short of monei for
two year after he bought him yet in the end that schimmel prove the
cheapest thing for which ever a man paid gold
well the kaffir hesit for as might be guess jan wa veri proud
of thi hors and none rode it save himself but sihamba sprang up and
spoke to him so fierc that at last he obei her sinc although she
wa small in statur all fear the magic of sihamba and would do her
bid nor had he far to go for the schimmel did not run wild upon
the veldt but wa fed and kept in a stabl where a slave groom him
everi morn thu it came about that befor zinti had finish hi
tale the hors wa stand befor sihamba bridl but not saddl
arch hi neck and strike the ground with hi hoof for he wa proud
and full of corn and eager to be awai
oh fool said sihamba to zinti why did not you begin with thi
part of your stori now to save five from death and on from dishonour
there is but a short hour left and twenti long mile to cover in it ho
man help me to mount thi hors
the slave put down hi hand and set her foot in it the littl
woman sprang on to the back of the great stallion which knew and love
her as a dog might do for she had tend it dai and night when it wa
ill from the sick we call thick head and without doubt had save
it life by her skill then grip it shoulder with her knee
sihamba shook the rein and call aloud to the schimmel wave
the black rod she alwai carri in her hand so that the fieri beast
have plung onc leapt awai like an antelop and in anoth minut
wa noth but a speck race toward the mountain
chapter xiii
the schimmel first race
so hard did sihamba ride and so swift and untir prove the hors
to whose strength her light weight wa as noth that the veldt
over which thei travel be flat and free from stone or hole she
reach the mouth of tiger nek twenti mile awai in veri few minut
over the hour of time but the nek itself wa a mile or more in length
and for aught she knew we might alreadi be taken in black piet trap
and she but ride to share our fate still she did not stai but
though it pant like a blacksmith bellow and it feet stumbl with
weari among the stone of the nek she urg on the schimmel at a
gallop now she turn the corner and the offsaddl place wa befor
her swiftli and fearfulli sihamba glanc around but see no sign
of us she utter a cry of joi and shook the rein for she knew that
she had not ridden in vain then a voic from the rock call out
it is the witchdoctoress sihamba who ride to warn them kill her
swiftli with the voic came a sound of gun and of bullet scream
past her on of which shatter the wand she carri in her hand
numb her arm nor wa that all for men sprang up across the further
end of the offsaddl place where the path wa narrow to bar her
wai and thei held spear in their hand but sihamba never heed the
men or the spear for she rode straight at them and through them and
so soon wa she gone that although six or seven assegai were hurl
at her onli on of them struck the hors wound it slightli in the
shoulder
a few minut later three perhap or five just as the four of us with
our kaffir servant were ride quietli up to the mouth of the nek we
saw a great hors thunder toward us black with sweat and fleck
with foam it shoulder bloodi it ey stare it red nostril
agap and perch upon it bare back a littl woman who swai from
side to side as though with weari hold in her hand a shatter
wand
allemacht cri jan it is sihamba and the witch ride my roan
schimmel
by thi time sihamba herself wa upon us back she scream as she
came death wait you in the pass whereon compel to it as it were
by the weight of the word and the face of she who spoke them we turn
our hors head and gallop after the schimmel for the half of a
mile or more till we were safe in the open veldt
then of a sudden the hors stop whether of it own accord or becaus
it rider pull upon the rein i know not at the least it stood there
trembl like a reed and sihamba lai upon it back cling to the
mane and as she lai i saw blood run down her leg for her skin wa
chafe to the flesh beneath ralph sprang to her and lift her to the
ground and suzann made her take a draught of peach brandi from jan
flask which brought the life to her face again
now she said if you have it to spare give the schimmel yonder
a drink of that stuff for he ha save all your live and i think he
need it
that is a wise word said jan and he bade ralph and the kaffir pour
the rest of the spirit down the hors throat which thei did therebi
as i believ save it life for until it had swallow it the beast
look as though it heart were about to burst
now said jan why do you ride my best hors to death in thi
fashion
have i not told you father of swallow she answer that it wa
to save you from death but a few minut over an hour ago fifteen
perhap a word wa spoken to me at your stead yonder and now i am here
seven leagu awai have ridden faster than i wish to ride again
or than ani other hors in thi countri can travel with a man upon it
back
to save us from death what death ask jan astound
death at the hand of swart piet and hi kaffir tribesmen for the three
of you and the two slave and for the fourth the ladi swallow there
a love which she doe not seek the love of the murder of her father
her mother and her chosen
now we stare at each other onli suzann ran to sihamba and put
her arm about her she kiss her
nai said the littl woman smile nai swallow i do but repai to
you onehundredth part of my debt and all the rest is ow still
then she told her stori in few word and when it wa done have
first look to see that swart piet and hi men were not come at the
bid of jan we all knelt down upon the veldt and thank the almighti
for our deliver onli sihamba did not kneel for she wa a heathen
and worship no on unless it were suzann
you should prai to the hors too she said for had it not been for
hi leg i could never have reach you in time
peac sihamba i answer it is god who made the hors leg as
god put it into your mind to us them but i said no more though at
ani other time i should have rate her well for her heathen folli
then we consult togeth as to what wa to be done and decid to make
our wai to the hous by a longer path which ran through the open veldt
sinc we were sure that there where is no cover swart piet would not
attack us ralph it is true wa for go into the nek and attack
him but as jan show him such an act would be mad for thei
were mani and we were few moreov thei could have pick us off from
behind the shelter of the rock so we settl to leav him alon and
that night came home safe though not without troubl for we carri
sihamba the most of the wai and after he grew stiff the schimmel
could onli travel at a walk pace veri soon that hors recov
howev for he wa a good feeder and live to do still greater
servic although for a while hi leg were somewhat puf and had to
be poultic with cabbag leav
now jan and ralph were mad against swart piet and would have brought
him to justic but thi road of justic wa full of stone and
mudhol sinc the nearest landdrost as we call a magistr live
a hundr mile off and it would not have been easi to persuad piet
to appear and argu the case befor him moreov here again we had no
evid against the man except that of a simpl black fellow who would
never have been believ for in fact no attack wa made upon us
while that upon sihamba might veri well have been the work of some of
the low kaffir that haunt the kloof runawai slave and other rascal
who desir to steal the fine hors upon which she rode also we learn
that our enemi act through some agent had sold hi farm to a
stranger for a small sum of monei give it out that he had no need of
the land as he wa leav thi part of the countri
but if we saw piet face no more we could still feel the weight of
hi hand sinc from that time forward we began to suffer from theft of
cattl and other troubl with the nativ whichso sihamba learn
in her underground fashionwer instig by him work through hi
savag tool while he himself lai hidden far awai and in safeti also
he did us anoth ill turnfor it wa prove that hi monei wa at
the bottom of itbi caus ralph to be command to serv on some
distant kaffir expedit out of which troubl we were oblig to bui
him and at no small cost
all these matter weigh upon us much so much inde that i wish
jan to trek from the transkei and found a new home but he would not
for he love the place which he had built up brick by brick and plant
tree by tree nor would he consent to be driven out of it through fear
of the wick practic of swart piet to on thing he did consent
howev and it wa that ralph and suzann should be marri as soon as
possibl for he saw that until thei were man and wife there would be
littl peac for ani of us when thei were spoken to on the matter
neither of them had anyth to sai against thi plan inde i believ
that in their heart for the first and last time in their live thei
bless the name of black piet whose evildo as thei thought wa
hurri on their happi
now it wa settl that the matter of thi marriag should be kept
secret for fear it should come to the ear of van vooren through hi
spi and stir him up to make a last attempt to steal awai suzann
and inde it did come to hi ear though how to thi hour i do
not know unless in spite of our warn the predic who wa to
perform the ceremoni a good and easi man but on who love gossip
blab of it on hi journei to the farm for he had a two dai ride to
reach it
it wa the wish of all of us that we should continu to live togeth
after the marriag of ralph and suzann though not beneath the same
roof inde there would have been no room for anoth marri pair in
that hous especi if children came to them nor did i wish to
share the rule of a dwell with my own daughter after she had taken
a husband for such arrang often end in bitter and quarrel
therefor jan determin to build them a new hous in a conveni spot
not far awai and it wa agre that dure the two or three month
while thi hous wa build ralph and hi wife should pai a visit to a
cousin of mine who own a veri fine farm on the outskirt of the dorp
which we us to visit from time to time to partak of nachtmahl
thi seem wise to us for sever reason beyond that of the build
of the new hous it is alwai best that young peopl should begin their
marri life alon as by natur thei wish to do and not under the ey
of those who have bred and nurtur them for thu face to face with
none to turn to thei grow more quickli accustom to each other
fault and weak which perhap thei have not learn or taken
count of befor
that is holi communion
moreov in the case of ralph and suzann we thought it safer that
thei should be absent for a while from their own district and the
neighbourhood of swart piet live in a peopl place where thei could
not be molest although not know the wicked of hi heart we
did not believ it possibl that he would molest them when onc thei
were marri inde there wa some talk of their go to the dorp
for the wed and i wish that thei had done so for then much troubl
might have been spare to us but their mind were set against thi
plan for thei desir to be marri where thei had met and live so
long so we did not gainsai them
at length came the ev of the wed dai and with it the predic
who arriv hungri and thirsti but run over with smile and
bless that night we all sup togeth and were full of joi nor
were ralph and suzann the least joyou of us though thei said littl
but sat gaze at each other across the tabl as though the moon had
struck them
befor i went to bed i had occas to go out of the hous for i
rememb that some linen which suzann wa to take with her had been
left dry upon bush after the wash and i fear that if it remain
there the kaffir women might steal it thi linen wa spread at a littl
distanc from the hous near the hut where sihamba live but i took
no lantern with me for the moon wa bright
as i drew near the spot i thought that i heard a sound of chant which
seem to come from a littl circl of mimosa tree that grew a spear
throw to my left of chant veri low and sweet wonder who it wa
that sung thu and why she sangfor the voic wa that of a womani
crept to the nearest of the tree keep in it shadow and peep
through the branch into the grassi space beyond to perceiv sihamba
crouch in the centr of the circl she wa seat upon a low stone
in such fashion that her head and face shone strang in the moonlight
while her bodi wa hidden in the shadow befor her place upon anoth
stone stood a larg wooden bowl such as the kaffir cut out of the
trunk of a tree spend a month of labour or more upon the task
and into thi bowl which i could see wa fill with water for it
reflect the moonrai she wa gaze earnestli and as she gaze
chant that low melancholi song whereof i could not understand the
mean
present sihamba ceas her sing and turn from the bowl as
though she had seen in it someth that frighten her she cover her
ey with her hand and groan aloud mutter word in which the name
of suzann wa mix up or of swallow as she call her now i guess
that sihamba wa practis that magic of which she wa said to be so
great a mistress although she deni alwai that she knew anyth of
the art at first i made up my mind to call to her to ceas from such
wicked which as the holi book tell us is a sin in the ey of
the lord and a caus of damnat to those who practis it but i wa
curiou and long greatli in my heart to know what it wa that sihamba
saw in the bowl and what it had to do with my daughter suzann so i
chang my mind therebi make myself a partak of the sin and come
forward said instead
what is it that you do here by night in thi solitari place sihamba
now although as i suppos she had neither seen nor heard me for i
came up from behind her sihamba did not start or cry out as ani other
woman would have done she did not even turn to look at me as she
answer in a clear and steadi voic
now while she is still a girl i read the fate of swallow and of those
who love her accord to my lore o mother of swallow look i read it
there
i look and saw that the larg bowl wa fill to the brim with pure
water at the bottom of it lai some white sand and on the sand were
place five piec of broken lookingglass all of which had been file
carefulli to a round shape the largest of these piec wa of the size
of a crown of english monei thi lai in the exact centr of the bowl
abov it and almost touch it edg wa anoth piec the size of a
halfcrown then to the right and left at a littl distanc two more
piec of the size of a shill and below but some wai off where the
bowl began to curv a veri small piec not larger than a sixpenni bit
swallow said sihamba point to the two largest of the fragment
and husband of swallow there to the right and left father and mother
of swallow and here at her feet a long wai off and veri small
sihamba servant of swallow made all of them from the broken glass that
show back the face which she gave me and set as thei must be set
like the star in the cross of the ski
now i shiver a littl for in myself i wa afraid of thi woman
magic but to her i laugh and said roughli
what fool playth made of bit of broken glass is thi that you
have here sihamba
it is a playth that will tell a stori to those who can read it she
answer without anger but like on who know she speak the truth
make it tell it stori to me and i will believ you i said laugh
again
she shook her head and answer ladi i cannot for you have not the
sight but bring your husband here and perhap he will be abl to read
the stori or some of it
now at thi i grew angri for it is not pleasant to a woman to hear that
a man whom all know to be but a child compar to her can see thing in
water which she is not abl to see even though the thing ar born
onli of the fals magic of a witchdoctoress still as at that moment
i chanc to hear jan seek me for he wonder where i had gone i
call to him and set out the matter expect that he would be veri
angri and dismiss sihamba break up her magic bowl but all the while
that i talk to him the littl woman sat her chin rest upon her
hand look into hi face and i think that she had some power over
him at the least he wa not at all angri although he said that i must
not mention the busi to the predic who wa well known to be
a prejud man then he ask sihamba to show him the wonder of the
bowl repli that she would if she might and alwai keep her ey
fix upon hi face she bade him kneel down and look into the water in
such fashion that he did not shut the moonlight off from it and to tell
us what he saw
so he knelt and look whisper present that on the midmost
piec of glass there appear the imag of suzann and on the other
respect those of ralph jan himself me hi wife and sihamba i
ask him what thei were do but he could give me no clear answer so
i suppos that thei were print there like the head on postag stamp
if inde thei exist anywher except in jan brain into which
sihamba had conjur them
what do you see more ask sihamba
i see a shadow in the water he answer a dark shadow andit is
like the head of swart piet cut out of black paperit spread till it
almost hide all the face on the bit of glass almost i sai but
not quit for thing ar pass beneath the shadow which i cannot
distinguish now it shrink quit small and li onli over your
like sihamba which show through it redy and all the water
round it is red and now there is noth left and jan rose pale
with fright and wipe hi brow with a colour pockethandkerchief
mutter allemacht thi is magic inde
let me look i said and i look for a long while and saw noth
except the five bit of glass so i told jan outright that he wa a fool
whom ani conjur could plai with but he wait until i had done and
then ask sihamba what the vision meant
father of swallow she answer what i saw in the water mirror you
have seen onli i saw more than you did becaus my sight is keener you
ask me what it mean but i cannot tell you altogeth for such vision
ar uncertain thei sum up the futur but thei do not show it all thi
howev is sure that troubl wait us everi on becaus of swart piet
for hi shadow lai thick upon the imag of each of us onli note
thi that while it clear awai from the rest it remain upon mine
stain it bloodr which mean that while in the end you will escap
him i shall die at hi hand or through him well so be it but
meanwhil thi is my counselbecaus of other thing that i saw in the
water which i cannot describ for in truth i know not rightli what thei
werethat the marriag of the swallow and her husband should be put
off and that when thei ar marri it should be at the dorp yonder not
here
now when i heard thi my anger overflow like water in a boil pot
what i cri when all is settl and the predic ha ridden for
two dai to do the thing is the marriag to be put off becaus forsooth
thi littl black idiot declar that she see thing on bit of glass
in a bowl and becaus you jan who ought to know better take the lie
from her lip and make it your own i sai that i am mistress here and
that i will not allow it if we ar to be made fool of in thi fashion
by the peep and mutter of kaffir witchdoctor we had better
give up and die at onc to go and live among the dead whose busi it
is to peep and mutter our busi is to dwell in the world and to face
it troubl and danger until such time as it pleas god to call us
out of the world pai no heed to omen and magic and such like sin
and folli let that come which will come and let us meet it like men
and women give glori to the almighti for the ill as well as for the
good sinc both ill and good come from hi hand and ar part of hi
plan for my part i trust to him who made us and who watch us and i
fear not swart piet and therefor chanc what mai the marriag shall go
on
good word said jan such as my heart approv of but he still
mop hi head with the colour pockethandkerchief and look
troubl as he ad i prai you wife sai noth of thi to anybodi
and abov all to the predic or he will put me out of the church as a
wizard
ye ye said sihamba good word but the sight is still the sight
for those who have the power to see not that i wish you to see
inde i did not wish it nor did i think that you would be turn from
your purpos by that which you have seen father and mother of swallow
you ar right and now i will tell you the truth what you beheld in the
water wa noth but a trick a clever trick of the littl doctoress
sihamba by the help of which and other like it she earn her live
and impos on the foolish though she cannot impos upon you who ar
wise and have the lord of the ski for a friend so think no more of
it and do not be angri with the littl black monkei whose natur it
is to plai trick and with a motion of her foot she upset the bowl
of water and collect the piec of mirror hid them awai in her skin
pouch
then we went but as i pass through the thorn tree i turn and
look at sihamba and lo she wa stand in the moonlight her face
lift toward the sky weep softli and wring her hand then for
the first time i felt a littl afraid
chapter xiv
the wed
the marriag morn of ralph and suzann broke brightli never have i
seen a fairer it wa spring time and the veldt wa cloth with the
fresh green grass and star everywher with the lili bloom that
sprang among it the wind blew softli shake down the dewdrop from
the grow corn while from everi bush and tree came the coo
of unnumb dove beneath the eav of the stoep the pair of
redbreast swallow which had built there for so mani year were
finish their nest and i watch them idli for to me thei were old
friend and would wheel about my head touch my cheek with their
wing just then thei paus from their task or perhap it wa at
length complet and fly to a bough of the peach tree a few yard
awai perch there togeth amidst the bright bloom and nestl
against each other twitter forth their song of joi and love
it wa at thi moment that sihamba walk up to the stoep as though to
speak to me
the swallow and the swallow mate she said follow my ey to
where the littl creatur swung togeth on the beauti bough
ye i answer for her fanci seem to me of good omen thei have
built their nest and now thei ar thank god befor thei begin to
live togeth and rear their young in love
as the word left my lip a quick shadow swept across the path of sunlit
ground befor the hous two strong wing beat and a brown hawk small
but veri fierc be of a sort that prei upon small bird swoop
downward upon the swallow on of them saw it and slid from the
bough but the other the hawk caught in it talon and mount with
it high into the air in vain did it mate circl round it swiftli
utter shrill note of distress up it went steadili as pitiless as
death
oh my swallow i cri aloud in grief the accurs hawk ha carri
awai my swallow
nai look said sihamba point upward
i look and behold a black crow that appear from behind the hous
wa wheel about the hawk strike at it with it beak until that
it might have it talon free to defend itself it let go the swallow
which follow by it mate came flutter to the earth while the
crow and the falcon pass awai fight till thei were lost in the
blue depth of air
spring from the stoep i ran to where the swallow lai but sihamba
wa there befor me and had it in her hand
the hawk beak ha wound it she said point to a blood stain
among the red feather of the breast but none of it bone ar broken
and i think that it will live let us put it in the nest and leav it to
it mate and natur
thi we did and there in the nest it stai for some dai it mate
feed it with fli as though it were still unfledg after that thei
vanish both of them togeth seek some new home nor did thei
ever build again beneath our eav
would you speak with me sihamba i ask when thi matter of the
swallow wa done with
i would speak with the baa or with you it is the same thing she
answer and for thi reason i go upon a journei for myself i have
the good black hors which the baa gave me after i had ridden to warn
you in tiger kloof yonder the on that i cure of sick but i
need anoth beast to carri pot and food and my servant zinti who
accompani me there is the brown mule which you us littl becaus he
is viciou but he is veri strong and zinti doe not fear him will you
sell him to me for the two cow i earn from the kaffir whose wife i
save when the snake bit her he is worth three but i have no more to
offer
whither do you wish to journei sihamba i ask
i follow my mistress to the dorp she answer
did she bid you follow her sihamba
no is it like that she would think of me at such a time or care
whether i come or go fear not i shall not troubl her or put her to
cost i shall follow but i shall not be seen until i am want
now i had made up my mind to gainsai sihamba not that i could find ani
fault with her plan but becaus if such arrang ar to be made i
like to make them myself as is the busi of the head of the hous i
think sihamba guess thi at ani rate she answer me befor i spoke
and that in an odd wai name by look first at the swallow nest
then at the bloom bough of the peach tree and lastli into the far
distanc of air
it wa the black crow that drove the hawk awai she said
reflect as though she were think of someth els though i
think for my ey ar better than your that the hawk kill the crow
or perhap thei kill each other at the least i saw them fall to
the earth beyond the crest of the mountain
at thi i wa about to break in angrili for if there wa on thing in
the world i hate it wa sihamba nonsens about bird and omen and
such thing whereof inde i had had enough on the previou night
when she made that lump jan believ that he saw vision in a bowl of
water and yet i did notfor the black crow sake the cruel hawk had
seiz the swallow which i love and born it awai to devour it in it
eyri and it wa the crow that save it well the thing that happen
among bird might happen among men who also prei upon each other
andbut i could not bear the thought
take the mule sihamba i said i will answer for it to the baa as
for the two cow thei can run with the other cattl till your return
i thank you mother of swallow she answer and turn to go when i
stop her and ask
have you heard anyth that make you afraid sihamba
i have heard noth she repli still i am afraid
then you ar a fool for your pain to be afraid of noth i
answer roughli but watch well sihamba
fear not i will watch till my knee ar loosen and my ey grow
hollow then she went awai and that wa the last i saw of her for mani
a weari month ah suzann child had it not been for the watch of
littl sihamba the walkerbymoonlight you had not been sit there
todai look much as she us to look the suzann of fifti year
ago
the marriag wa to take place at noon and though i had much to see
to never have i known a longer morn why it wa i cannot sai but it
seem to me as though twelv oclock would never come then wherev
i went there wa ralph in my wai wander about in a senseless fashion
with hi best cloth on while after him wander jan hold hi new
hat in hi hand
in the name of heaven i cri at length as i blunder into both of
them in the kitchen be off out of thi why ar you here
allemacht said jan becaus we have nowher els to go thei ar
make the sittingroom readi for the servic and the dinner after it
the predic is in ralph room write suzann is in your try
on her cloth and the stoep and even the stabl ar full of
kaffir where then shall we go
cannot you see to the waggon i ask
we have seen to it mother said ralph it is pack and the oxen
ar alreadi ti to the yoke for fear lest thei should strai
then be off and sit in it and smoke till i come to call you i
repli and awai thei walk shamefacedli enough ralph first and jan
follow him
at twelv oclock i went for them and found them both seat on the
waggonchest smoke like chimnei and sai noth
come ralph i said it is quit time for you to be marri and he
came look veri pale and walk unsteadili as though he had been
drink while after him as usual march jan still pull at the
pipe which he had forgotten to take out of hi mouth
somehow i do not recollect much of the detail of that wed thei
seem to have slip my mind or perhap thei ar buri beneath the
memori of all that follow hard upon it i rememb suzann stand
befor the littl tabl behind which wa the predic with hi book
she wore a white dress that fit her veri well but had no veil
upon her head after the english fashion which even boer girl follow
nowadai onli in her hand she carri a bunch of rare white flower
that sihamba had gather for her in a hidden kloof where thei grew
her face wa somewhat pale or look so in the dim room but her lip
show red like coral and her dark ey glow and shone as she turn
them upon the lover at her side the fairhair greyei handsom
english lad whose nobl blood told it tale in everi featur and
movement ye and even in hi voic the man whom she had save from
death to be her lifem
a few whisper word the chang of a ring and on long kiss and
these two ralph kenzi and suzann botmar were husband and wife in the
ey of god and man ah me i am glad to think of it for in the end
of all the mani marriag that i have known thi prove the veri best
and happiest
now i thought that it wa done with for thei had knelt down and the
predic had bless them but not so for the good man must have hi
word and a long word it wa on and on he preach about the duti of
husband and wive and mani other matter till at last as i expect
he came to the children now i could bear it no longer
that is enough reverend sir i said for sure it is scarc
need to talk of children to peopl who have not been marri five
minut
that prick the bladder of hi discours which soon came to an end
whereon i call to the kaffir to bring in dinner
the food wa good and plenti and so wa the holland or squarefac
as thei call it now to sai noth of the constantia and peachbrandi
which had been sent to me mani year befor by a cousin who live at
stellenbosch and yet that meal wa not as cheer as it might have
been to begin with the predic wa sulki becaus i had cut him
short in hi address and a holi man in the sulk is a bad kind of
anim to deal with then jan tri to propos the health of the new
marri pair and could not do it the word seem to stick in hi
throat for at the best jan wa never a speaker in short he made a
fool of himself as usual and i had to fill up the gap in hi head
well i talk nice enough till in an evil moment i overdid it a
littl by speak of ralph as on whom heaven had sent to us and of
whose birth and parent we knew noth then jan found hi tongu
and said wife that a lie and you know it for doubtless the
holland and the peachbrandi had got the better of hi reason and
hi manner i did not answer him at the time for i hate wrangl in
public but afterward i spoke to him on the subject onc and for all
luckili the predic took no notic of thi incid for he wa
think about himself as he wa too prone to do
then to make matter wors suzann must need throw her arm round her
father neck and begin to crythank be to my bring up of her she
knew better than to throw them round mine good lord i said lose
my temper what is the girl at now she ha got the husband for whom
she ha been crave and the first thing she doe is to snivel well
if i had done that to my husband i should have expect him to box my
ear though heaven know that i should have had excus for it
here the predic woke up see hi chanc
vrouw botmar he said blink at me like an owl it is my duti to
reprov your irrever languag even at thi festiv board for a
word must be spoken both in and out of season and without respect
of person vrouw botmar i fear that you do not rememb the third
command therefor i will repeat it to you and he did so speak
veri slowli
what i answer i cannot recollect but even now i seem to see that
predic fly out of the door of the room hold hi hand abov
hi head well for onc he met hi match and i know that afterward he
alwai spoke of me with great respect
after thi again i rememb littl more till the pair start upon their
journei suzann ask for sihamba to sai goodby to her and when she
wa told that she wa not to be found she seem vex which show that
the littl doctoress did her injustic in suppos that just becaus
she wa marri she thought no more of her then she kiss us all in
farewellah we littl knew for how long that farewel wa to beand
went down to the waggon to which the sixteen black oxen a beauti
team were inspan and stand there readi to start but ralph and
suzann were not go to ride in the waggon for thei had hors
to carri them at the last moment inde jan whose head wa still
buzz with the peachbrandi insist upon give ralph the great
schimmel that same stallion which sihamba had ridden when she warn
us of the ambush in the pass gallop twenti mile in the hour thi
show me that provid can turn even a man vice to account for
afterward the schimmel wa veri us
so there wa much kiss and mani goodby ralph and suzann sai
that thei would soon be back which inde wa the case with on of
them till at last thei were off jan ride with them a littl wai
toward their first outspan by the sea fourteen mile distant where
thei were to sleep that night
when thei had gone i went into my bedroom and sit down i cri
for i wa sorri to lose suzann even for a littl and for her own good
and my heart wa heavi also my quarrel with the predic had put
me out of temper when i had got over thi fit i set to work to tidi
suzann littl sleep place and that i found a sad task then jan

hour trek awai and hi head be clear by now we talk over the

sleep till at length about on in the morn we were awaken by the
shout of the messeng who came bear the terribl new
chapter xv
ralph return into the sea
ralph and suzann reach their outspan place in safeti a littl befor
sunset i us to know the spot well it is where on of the numer
wooden kloof that scar the mountain slope end on a grassi plain
of turf short but veri sweet thi plain is not much more than five
hundr pace wide for it is border by the cliff that just here is
not veri high against which the sea beat at full tide
when the oxen had been turn loos to graze and the voorloop set to
watch them the driver of the waggon undid the cook vessel and built
a fire with dry wood collect from the kloof then suzann cook their
simpl even meal of which thei partook thankfulli after it wa
done the pair left the waggon and follow the bank of the littl
kloof stream which wander across the plain till it reach the cliff
whenc it fell in a trickl waterfal into the sea here thei sat down
upon the edg of the cliff and lock in each other arm watch the
moon rise over the silver ocean their young heart fill with a joi
that cannot be told
the sea is beauti is it not husband whisper suzann into hi
ear
tonight it is beauti he answer as our live seem to be yet i
have seen it otherwis and he shudder a littl
she nod for she knew of what he wa think and did not wish to
speak of it neither life nor ocean can be alwai calm she said but
oh i love that great water for it brought you to me
i prai that it mai never separ us answer ralph
why do you sai that husband she ask noth can separ us now
for even if you journei far awai to seek your own peopl as sometim i
think you should i shall accompani you noth can separ us except
death and death shall bind us more close each to each for ever and
for ever
i do not know why i said it sweet he answer uneasili and just
then a littl cloud float over the face of the moon darken the
world and a cold wind blew down the kloof caus it tree to rustl
and chill the pair so that thei clung closer to each other for
comfort
the cloud and the wind pass awai leav the night as beauti as
befor and thei sat on for a while to watch it listen to the music
of the waterfal that splash into the deep sea pool below and to the
soft surg of the wave as thei lap gentli against the narrow beach
at length ralph spoke in a low voic sweet it is time to sleep he
said and kiss her
it is time she whisper back but husband first let us kneel
togeth here and prai to the almighti to bless our marri life and
make us happi
that is a good thought he answer for in those dai young men who
had been brought up as christian were not asham to sai their prayer
even in the presenc of other
so thei knelt down side by side upon the edg of the cliff with their
face set toward the open sea
prai for us both aloud ralph said suzann for though my heart is
full enough i have no word
so ralph prai veri simpli sai oh god who madest us hear us
thy son and daughter and bless us thi night our marri life begin
be thou with us ever in it and if it should pleas thee that we should
have children let thy bless go with them all their dai oh god i
thank thee that thou didst save me aliv from the sea and lead the feet
of the child who is now my wife to the place where i wa starv and
suzann thank thee that through the whisper of a dream her feet
were led thu oh god as i believ that thou didst hear my prayer when
as a lost child i knelt dy on the rock so i believ that thou dost
hear thi the first prayer of our wed life we know that all life is
not made up of such joi as thou hast given us thi dai but that it ha
mani danger and troubl and loss therefor we prai thee to comfort
us in the troubl to protect us in the danger and to give us
consol in the loss and most of all we prai thee that we who love
each other and whom thou hast join togeth mai be allow to live
out our live togeth fear noth howev great our peril sinc
dai and night we walk in the shadow of thy strength until we pass into
it presenc
thi wa ralph prayer for he told it to me word by word afterward
when he lai sick at the time the answer to it seem to be a strang
on an answer to shake the faith out of a man heart and yet it wa
not lost or mock at for the true respons came in it season nai it
came week by week and hour by hour see that everi dai through those
aw year the sword of the strength thei had implor protect those
who prai hold them harmless in mani a desper peril to reunit
them at the last the devil is veri strong in thi world of our or so
it seem to me who have known much of hi wai so strong that perhap
god must give place to him at time for if he rule in heaven i think
that satan share hi rule on earth but in the end it is god who win
and never never need thei fear who acknowledg him and put their faith
in him try the while to live uprightli and conquer the evil of their
heart well thi is onli an old woman wisdom though it should not
be laugh at sinc it ha been taught to her by the experi of a
long and event life such as it is i hope that it mai be of servic
to those who trust in themselv and not in their maker
as the last word of hi prayer left ralph lip he heard a man laugh
behind him the two of them sprang to their feet at the sound and face
about to see swart piet stand within five pace of them and with him
eight or ten of hi black ruffian who look upon him as their chief
and did hi need without question howev wick thei might be
now suzann utter a low cry of fear and the blood froze about ralph
heart for he wa unarm and their case wa hopeless black piet saw
their fear and laugh again sinc like a cat that ha caught a mous
for which it ha watch long he could not resist the joi of tortur
befor he dealt the death blow

such piou peopl sinc it enabl us to creep on you unawar also
i much prefer to have found you engag in prayer friend englishman
rather than in take the bloom off my peach with kiss as i fear

wheel of the waggon
someth ha frighten the schimmel said the driver wake up
it is noth answer the other boi drowsili he is not us to
the veldt he who alwai sleep in a hous like a man or perhap he
smell a hyena in the kloof
i thought i heard a sound like that of a gun a while ago down yonder by
the sea said the driver again sai brother shall we go and find out
what made it
by no mean answer the voorloop who did not like walk about
at night fear lest he should meet spook i have been wide awak
and listen all thi time and i heard no gun nor inde do peopl
go out shoot at night also it is our busi to watch here by the
waggon till our master and mistress return
where can thei have gone said the driver who felt frighten he
knew not why it is strang that thei should be so long awai when it is
time for them to sleep
who can account for the wai of white peopl answer the other
shrug hi shoulder veri often thei sit up all night doubtless
these two will return when thei ar tire or perhap thei desir to
sleep in the veldt at ani rate it is not our duti to interfer with
them see that thei can come to no harm here where there ar neither
men nor tiger
so be it said the driver and thei both doze off again till the
messeng of ill came to rous them
now black piet and hi men crept up the kloof carri suzann with
them till thei came to a littl patch of rocki ground at the head of it
where thei had left their hors
that wa veri well manag said piet as thei loos them and
tighten their girth and none can ever know that we have made thi
journei tomorrow the bride and bridegroom will be miss but the sea
ha on and i have the other and hunt as thei mai thei will never find
her nor guess where she ha gone no it will be rememb that thei
walk down to the sea and folk will think that by chanc thei fell
from the cliff into the deep water and vanish there ye it wa well
manag and none can guess the truth
now the man to whom he spoke that same man with whom the boi zinti had
heard him plot our murder in the tiger kloof shrug hi shoulder and
answer
i think there is on who will guess
who is that fool
she about whose neck i onc set a rope at your bid bullhead
and whose life wa bought by those lip and he point to suzann
sihamba ngenyanga
why should she guess ask piet angrili
ha she not done so befor think of the great schimmel and it rider
in tiger kloof moreov what doe her name mean doe it not mean
wandererbymoonlight and wa not thi great deed of your a deed at
the tell of which all who hear of it shall grow sick and silent done
in the moonlight bullhead
now as we learn afterward from a man whom jan took prison and who
told us everyth which pass that night hope to bui hi life
piet made no answer to thi sai but turn to busi himself with hi
saddl for after hi ill deal with her he wa alwai afraid of
sihamba and would never mention her name unless he wa oblig soon
the hors most of which were small and of the basuto breed were readi
to start on on of the best of them there wa a soft pad of sheepskin
such as girl us to ride on when i wa young befor we knew anyth
about these newfangl english saddl with leather hook to hold the
rider in her place on thi pad which had been prepar for her thei
set suzann have first ti her feet togeth loos with a riem so
that she might not slip to the ground and attempt to escap by run
moreov as she wa still in a swoon thei support her black piet
walk upon on side and a kaffir upon the other in thi fashion thei
travel for the half of an hour or more until thei were deep in among
the mountain inde when suddenli with a littl sigh suzann awok
and glanc about her with wide frighten ey then memori came
back to her and she understood and open her lip she utter on
shriek so pierc and dread that the rock of the hill multipli
and echo it and the blood went cold even in the heart of those
savag men
suzann said swart piet in a low hoars voic i have dare much to
win you and i wish to treat you kindli but if you cry out again for
my own safeti sake and that of those with me we must gag you
she made no answer to him nor did she speak at all except on word and
that word murder then she close her ey as though to shut out
the sight of hi face and sat silent sai noth and do noth
even when piet and the other man who support her had mount and
push their hors to a gallop lead that on which she rode by a
riem
it might be thought after receiv a pistol bullet fire into him at a
distanc of four pace and be cast down through fifti feet of space
into a pool of the sea that there wa an end of ralph kenzi for ever
on thi earth but thank to the merci of god thi wa not so for the
ball had but shatter hi left shoulder touch no vital part and
the water into which he fell wa deep so that strike against no
rock he rose present to the surfac and the pool be but narrow
wa abl to swim to on side of it where the beach shelv up that
beach ralph could not climb howev for he wa faint with loss of
blood and shock inde hi sens left him while he wa in the water
but it chanc that he fell forward and not backward so that hi head
rest upon the shelv edg of the pool all the rest of hi bodi
be beneath it surfac ly thu had the tide been rise he
would speedili have drown but it had turn and so the water be
warm he took no further harm
now sihamba did not leav the stead till some hour after ralph and hi
bride had trek awai she knew where thei would outspan and as she
did not wish that thei should see her yet or until thei were too far
upon their journei to send her back it wa her plan to reach the spot
or rather a hidingplac in the kloof within a stone throw of it
after thei had gone to rest so it came about that at the time when
ralph and suzann were surpris by swart piet sihamba wa ride along
quietli upon the hors which jan had given her accompani by the lad
zinti perch on the strong brown mule in the midst of cook pot
bag of meal biltong and roll of blanket alreadi half a mile
off or more she could see the cap of the waggon gleam white in the
moonlight when suddenli awai to the left thei heard the sound of a
pistol shot
now who shoot in thi lone place at night said sihamba to zinti
had the sound come from the waggon yonder i should think that someon
had fire to scare a hungri jackal but all is quiet at the waggon and
the servant of swallow ar there for look the fire burn
i know not ladi answer zinti for sihamba wa given the titl of
chieftai among the nativ who knew someth of her birth but i
am sure that the sound wa made by powder
let us go and see said sihamba turn her hors
for a while thei rode on toward the place whenc thei had heard the
shot till suddenli when thei were near the cliff and in a littl fold
of ground beyond the ridg of which ran the stream sihamba stop and
whisper be silent i hear voic then she slip from her hors
and crept like a snake up the slope of the rise until she reach it
crest where at thi spot stood two tuft of last season grass for
no fire had swept the veldt from between these tuft so well hidden
herself that unless thei had step upon her bodi none could have
discov her she saw a strang sight
there beneath her within a few pace inde for the ground slope
steepli to the stream men were pass the first of these wa white
and he carri a white woman in hi arm the rest were kaffir some of
whom wore kaross or cotton blanket and some tatter soldier coat
and trouser while all were well arm with roer or other gun
and had powder flask hung about their neck sihamba knew at onc that
the white man wa swart piet and the woman in hi arm her mistress
suzann she could have told it from her shape alon but as it
happen her head hung down and the moonlight shone upon her face so
brightli that she could see it everi featur her blood boil in her
as she look for now she understood that her fear were just and that
the swallow whom she love abov everyth in the world had fallen
into the power of the man she hate at first she wa mind to follow
and if might be to rescu her then she rememb the pistolshot and
rememb also that thi newmad wife would have been with her husband
and no other where then wa he now without doubt murder by
bullhead if so it wa littl us to look for him and yet someth
in her heart told her to look
at that moment she might not help suzann for what could on woman and
a kaffir youth do against so mani men moreov she knew whither van
vooren would take her and could follow there but first she must learn
for certain what had been the fate of the baa ralph her husband so
sihamba lai still beneath the two tuft of grass until the last of the
men had pass in silenc glanc about them sullenli as though thei
fear vengeanc for a crime then have note that thei were head
for the kloof she went back to where zinti stood in the hollow hold
the hors with on hand and the mule with the other and beckon him to
follow her
veri soon trace the spoor backward thei reach the edg of the
cliff just where the waterfal fell over it into the sea pool here she
search about note thi thing and that till at last all grew clear
to her yonder suzann had lain for the impress of her shape could
still be seen upon the grass and there a man had been stretch out
for hi blood stain the ground more he had been drag to the edg
of the cliff for thi wa the track of hi bodi and the spoor of hi
murder feet look how hi heel had sunk into the turf as he took
the weight of the corps in hi arm to hurl it over the edg
tie the hors and the mule togeth zinti she said and let us find
a path down thi precipic
the lad obei wonder though he too guess much of what had
happen and after a littl search thei found a place by which thei
could descend now sihamba ran to the pool and stood upon it brink
scan the surfac with her ey till at length she glanc
downward and there almost at her feet three part of hi bodi yet
hidden in the water lai the man she sought
swiftli she sprang to him and aid by zinti drag him to dry
ground
ala ladi moan the kaffir it is of no us the baa is dead
look he ha been shot
take no heed of the word sihamba open ralph garment place
first her hand then her ear upon hi heart present she lift her
head a light of hope shine in her ey and said
nai he live and we have found him in time moreov hi wound
is not to death now help me for between us we must bear him up the
cliff
so zinti took him on hi back as a man take a sack of flour while
sihamba support hi leg and thu between them with great toil for
the wai wa veri steep thei carri him by a slope buck path to the
top of the precipic and laid him upon the mule
which wai now gasp zinti for be strong he had born the weight
to the waggon if thei have not yet stolen it said sihamba and
thither thei went
when thei were near she crept forward search for swart piet and hi
gang but there were no sign of them onli she saw the driver and hi
companion nod by the fire she walk up to them
do you then sleep servant of kenzi she said while the swallow is
born awai to the hawk nest and the husband of swallow your master
is cast by bullhead back into the sea whenc he came
now the men woke up and knew her look it is sihamba stammer

waggon to watch the baa kenzi and to comfort him should he wake out of
hi swoon sai to the father and mother of swallow that i have taken the

let them not believ that we ar dead until thei have certain knowledg
of it for it mai chanc that we cannot return to the stead but must
lie hid in the mountain or among the kaffir now hear what zinti ha

ran out to learn all the dread tide and to find ralph bleed

been kind to him and plung him back into stupor in thi he lai long
until well on into the morrow inde or rather the dai for by now it
wa three oclock when the doctor came to take out the pistol ball and
set hi shatter bone for as it chanc a doctor and a clever on
had been sent for from the dorp to visit the wife of a neighbour who lai
sick not more than twenti mile awai and we were abl to summon him

quiet hi mind and abov all a certain special merci which shall be
told of in it place i think that ralph would have di as it wa
seven long week went by befor he could sit upon a hors
chapter xvii
the hidden krantz
befor the waggon left her sihamba took from it ralph gun a veri
good roer togeth with powder and bullet also she took tinder a
bottl of peachbrandi a blanket meali in a small bag wherewith to
bait the hors in case of need and some other thing which she thought
might be necessari these she lade among her own good upon the mule
that with her hors had been fetch by zinti and hastili fed with corn
now at her bid zinti set suzann saddl upon the back of the
schimmel and ralph on that of suzann grei mare which he mount
that the mule might travel lighter then sihamba got upon her own hors
a good and quiet beast which she rode with a sheepskin for a saddl and
thei start sihamba lead the schimmel and zinti the mule that as
it chanc although bad temper would follow well on a riem
ride up the kloof thei soon reach the spot where van vooren band
had tether their hors and track the spoor of them with eas for
so long as the ground wa soft afterward when thei reach the open
countri where the grass had been burnt off and had onli just begun to
spring again thi becam more difficult and at length in that light
imposs here thei wast a long time search for the hoofmark
by the rai of the wane moon onli to lose them again so soon as thei
were found
at thi pace we shall take as long to reach bullhead kraal as did
the cow you follow said sihamba present sai now can you find
the wai to it
without a doubt ladi zinti never forget a road or a landmark
then lead me there as fast as mai be
ye ladi but bullhead mai have taken the swallow somewher els
and if we do not follow hi spoor how shall we know where he ha hidden
her
fool i have thought of that she answer angrili els should i
have spent all thi time look for hoofmark in the dark we must
risk it i sai to hi hous he ha not taken her for other white folk
ar live in it and it is not like he would have a second or a
better hidingplac than that you saw i sai that we must be bold and
risk it sinc we have no time to lose
as you will mistress answer zinti who am i that i should
question your wisdom and turn hi hors head he rode forward
across the gloomi veldt as certainli as a home rockdov wing it
flight
so thei travel till the sun rose behind a rang of distant hill
then zinti halt and point to them
look ladi he said do you see that peak among the mountain which
ha a point like a spear the on that seem as though it were on fire
well behind it li bullhead kraal
it is far zinti but we must be there by night
that mai be done ladi but if so we must spare our hors
good she answer here is a spring let us offsaddl a while
so thei offsaddl and at of the food which thei had brought while
the hors fill themselv with the sweet green grass the schimmel
be ti to the grei mare for he would not bear a kneehalt
all that dai thei rode not so veri fast but steadili till toward
sunset thei offsaddl again beneath the shadow of the spearpoint
peak there wa no water at thi spot but see a green place upon
the slope of a hill close by zinti walk to it lead the thirsti
beast present he threw up hi hand and whistl whereon sihamba set
out to join him know that he had found a spring so it prove to be
and now thei learn that sihamba had been wise in head straight for
swart piet hidingplac sinc round about thi spring wa the spoor
of mani hors and of men among these wa the print of a foot that she
knew well the littl foot of suzann
how long is it sinc thei left here ask sihamba not as on who
doe not know but rather as though she desir to be certifi in her
judgment
when the sun stood there answer zinti point to a certain height
in the heaven
ye she answer three hour bullhead ha travel quicker than
i thought
no said zinti but i think that he knew a path through the big
vlei wherea we rode round it two hour ride fear lest we
should be bog here by thi spring thei stai till sunset for it
wa need that the hors should feed and rest sinc thei would save
their strength in them
ladi went on zinti present beyond the neck of the hill yonder
li the secret kraal of bullhead sai now what is your plan when you
reach it
i do not know she answer but tell me again of the hidden krantz
where the women built the new hut and of the wai to it
he told her and she listen sai noth
good she said when he had done now lead me to thi place and then
perhap i will tell my plan if i have on
so thei start on again but just as thei reach the crest of the
nek a heavi thunderstorm came up togeth with cloud and rain hide
everyth from them
now i suppos that we must stai here till the light come said
sihamba
not so ladi answer zinti i have been the path onc and i can go
it again in storm or shine and he press forward with the lightn
flash for a candl
well wa that storm for them inde sinc otherwis thei would have
been seen for alreadi swart piet had set hi scout about the kraal
at length sihamba felt that thei were ride among tree for water
drip from them upon her and their branch brush her face
here is the wood where the women cut pole for the new hut whisper
zinti in her ear
then let us halt she answer and dismount thei ti the three
hors and the mule to as mani small tree close togeth but not near
enough for them to kick each other
now sihamba took a piec of biltong from a saddlebag and began to eat
it for she knew that she would need all her clever and strength
take the bag of meali she said and divid it among the hors and
the mule give a doubl share to the schimmel
zinti obei her and present all four of the beast were eat well
for though thei had travel far their load were light nor had the
pace been press
sihamba turn and hold out her hand toward the hors mutter
someth rapidli
what ar you do mistress ask zinti
perhap i am throw a charm upon these anim that thei mai neither
neigh nor whinni till we come again for if thei do so we ar lost
now let us go andstai bring the gun with you for you know how to
shoot
so thei start slip through the wet wood like shadow for ten
minut or more thei crept on thu toward the dark line of cliff zinti
go first and feel the wai with hi finger till present he
halt
hist he whisper i smell peopl
as he spoke thei heard a sound like to that of someon slide down
rock then a man challeng sai who pass from the krantz and
a woman voic answer it is i asika the wife of bullhead i
hear you answer the man now tell me asika what happen yonder
what happen how do i know what happen she answer crossli about
sunset bullhead brought home hi new wife a white chieftai for
whom we built the hut yonder but the fashion of marriag among these
white peopl must be strang inde for thi on came to her husband
her feet bound and with a face like to the face of a dead woman the
ey set wide and the lip part ye and thei blindfold her in the
wood there and carri her through thi hole in the rock down to the hut
where she is shut in
i know someth of thi matter answer the man the white ladi is
no will wife to bullhead for he kill her husband and took her by
forc ye ye i know for my uncl wa on of those with him when the
deed wa done and he told me someth of it just now
an evil deed said asika and on that will bring bad luck upon all
of us but then bullhead our chief is an evil man oh i know it who
am of the number of hi kaffir wive sai friend she went on will
you walk a littl wai with me as far as the first hut of the kraal
for there ar ghost in the wood and i fear to pass it alon at night
i dare not asika he answer for i am set here on guard
have no fear friend the chief is within see to the comfort of hi
new wife
well i will come with you a littl wai if you wish it but i must
be back immedi he said and the listen heard them walk off
togeth
now zinti whisper sihamba lead me through the hole in the rock
so he took her by the hand and felt along the face of the cliff till he
found the bush which cover the entranc to thi he climb drag
her after him and present thei were in the secret krantz
we have found our wai into the spider nest mutter zinti who grew
afraid but sai ladi how shall we find our wai out of it
lead on and leav that to me she answer where i a woman can go
sure you who ar a man can go also
i trust to your magic to protect ustherefor i come said zinti
though if we ar seen our death is sure
on thei crept across the glen till present thei heard the sound of
the small waterfal and saw it glimmer faintli through the gloom and
drizzl rain to their left ran the stream and on the bank of it
stood someth larg and round
there stand the new hut where swallow is whisper zinti
now sihamba thought for a moment and said
zinti i must find out what pass in that hut listen do you lie hid
among the rock under the bank of the stream and if you hear me hoot
like an owl then come to me but not befor
i obei answer zinti and crept down among the reed where he
crouch for a long time up to hi knee in water shiver with cold
and fear
chapter xviii
what pass in the hut
go on to her hand and knee sihamba crawl toward the hut now she
wa within ten pace of it and could see that a man stood on guard at
it doorwai i must creep round to the back she thought and began to
do so head for some shrub which grew to the right alreadi she had
almost reach them when of a sudden and for an instant onli the moon
shone out between two thick cloud reveal her though indistinctli
to the ey of the guard now sihamba wa wear a fur cape made of
wild dog hide and crouch as she wa upon her hand and knee
halfhidden moreov by a tuft of dry grass the man took her to be
a wild dog or a jackal and the hair which stood out round her head for
the ruff upon the anim neck
take that you fourleg night thief he said aloud and hurl the
assegai in hi hand straight at her the aim wa good inde had she
been a dog it would have transfix her as it wa the spear pass
just beneath her bodi pin the hang edg of the cape and
remain fix in the tough leather now if sihamba wit had left her
as would have happen with most she wa lost but not for noth had
she been a witchdoctoress from her childhood skill in everi artific
and accustom to face death from hi word she guess that the sentri
had mistaken her for a wild beast so instead of spring to her feet
she plai the part of on and utter a howl of pain scrambl
awai among the bush she heard the man start to follow her then the
moonlight went out and he return to hi post grumbl over hi lost
assegai and sai that he would find it in the jackal bodi on the
morrow sihamba listen not far awai knew hi voic it wa that of
the fellow who had set the noos about her neck at swart piet bid
and who wa to have done the murder in the pass
now friend you ar unarm she thought to herself for you have no
gun with you and perhap we shall settl our account befor you go to
seek that dead jackal by tomorrow light then draw the assegai
from the cloak and keep it in her hand she crept on till she came to
the back of the hut in safeti still she wa not much nearer to her end
for the hut wa new and veri well built and she could find no crack
to look through though when she place her ear against it side
she thought that she could hear the sound of a man voic in her
perplex sihamba cast her ey upward and saw that a fine line of
light shone from the smokehol at the veri top of the hut which wa
hiveshap and a thought came into her head
if i climb up there she said to herself i can look down through
the smokehol and see and hear what pass in the hut onli then if
the moon come out again i mai be seen ly on the thatch well that i
must chanc with the rest
so veri slowli and silent by the help of the rimpi which bound the
straw she climb the dome of the hut laugh to herself to think
that thi wa the worst of omen for it owner till at length she
reach the smokehol at the top and look down
thi wa what she saw half seat half ly upon a rough bedstead
spread with blanket wa suzann her hair had come undon and hung
about her her feet were still loos bound togeth and as the
kaffir asika had said her face wa like that of a dead woman and her
ey were set in a fix unnatur stare befor her wa a tabl cut

have you still no answer well i will not hurri you see i must
godo you know what for to set scout lest by ani chanc your father
or other fool should have found my hidingplac though i think that
thei can never find it except it be through the wisdom of sihamba which
thei will not seek still i go and in an hour i will return for your
answer which you must make then suzann sinc whether you desir it
or desir it not fortun ha given you to me have you no word for me
befor i go
now dure all thi long halfinsan harangu suzann had sat quit
silent make no repli at all not even seem to hear the demon for
such he wa whose wick talk defil her ear but when he ask her
whether she had noth to sai to him befor he went still look not
at him but beyond him she gave him hi answer in on word the same
that she had us when she awok from her swoon
murder
someth in the tone in which she spoke or perhap in the substanc
of that short speech seem to cow him at the least he turn and left
the hut and present sihamba heard him talk to the sentri without
bid him to keep close watch till he came back within an hour
when piet went out he left the doorboard of the hut open so that
sihamba dare neither act nor speak fear lest the guard should hear
or see her through it therefor she still lai upon the top of the hut
and watch through the smokehol for a while suzann sat quiet upon
the bed then of a sudden she rose from it and shuffl across the hut
as well as her bound feet would allow her she close the open with
the doorboard and secur it by it wooden bar next she return
to the bed and seat upon it clasp her hand and began to prai
mutter aloud and mix with her prayer the name of her husband
ralph ceas present she thrust her hand into her bosom and drew
from it a knife not larg but strong and veri sharp open thi
knife she cut the thong that bound her ankl and made it into a noos
then she look earnestli first at the noos next at the knife and
thirdli at the candl and sihamba understood that she meant to do
herself to death and wa choos between steel and rope and fire
now all thi while although she dare not so much as whisper sihamba
had not been idl for with the blade of the assegai she wa work
gentli at the thatch of the smokehol and cut the rimpi that
bound it till at last and not too soon she thought that it wa wide
enough to allow of the passag of her small bodi then watch until
the guard lean against the hut so that the bulg of it would cut
her off from hi sight dure the instant that her figur wa outlin
against the sky she stood up and thrust her feet through the hole
forc her bodi to follow them and then drop lightli as a cat to the
floor beneath but now there wa anoth danger to be face and a great
on name that suzann might cry out in fear which doubtless she
would have done had not the sudden sight of some live creatur in the
hut where she thought herself alon so startl her that for a
moment she lost her breath befor she could find it again sihamba wa
whisper in her ear sai
keep silenc for your life sake swallow it is i sihamba who am
come to save you
suzann stare at her and light came back into the empti ey then
thei grew dark again as she answer below her breath
of what us is my life ralph is dead and i wa about to take it that
i mai save myself from shame and go to seek him for sure god will
forgiv the sin
sihamba look at her and said
swallow prepar yourself for great joi and abov all do not cry
out your husband is not dead he wa but wound and i drew him live
from the sea he li safe at the stead in your mother care
suzann heard her and notwithstand the caution still she would
have cri aloud in the mad of her joi had not sihamba see her
lip open thrust her hand upon her mouth and held them there till
the danger wa past
you do not lie to me she gasp at length
nai i speak truth i swear it but thi is no time to talk yonder
stand food and milk eat while i think
as sihamba guess noth but a littl water had pass suzann
lip sinc that meal which she and her husband took togeth besid the
waggon nor on minut befor she could have swallow anyth had her
life been the price of it but now it wa differ for despair had
left her and hope shone in her heart again and behold of a sudden she
wa hungri and at and drank with glad while sihamba thought
present the littl woman look up and whisper
a plan come into my head it is a strang on but i can find no
other and it mai serv our turn for i think that good luck goe with
us swallow give me the noos of hide which you made from the riem that
bound your feet
suzann obei her wonder whereon sihamba place the noos about her
own neck then bade suzann stand upon the bed and thrust the end of the
riem loos into the thatch of the hut as high up as she could reach
so that it look as though it were made fast there next sihamba
slip off her fur cloak leav herself nake except for the moocha
round her middl and clasp her hand behind her back with the
assegai between them she drew the riem taut and lean against the
wall of the hut after the fashion of on who is about to be pull from
the ground and strangl
now mistress listen to me she said earnestli you have seen me
like thi befor have you not when i wa about to be hang and you
bought my life at a price well as it chanc that man who guard the
hut is he who took me at bullhead bid and set the rope round my
neck whereon i said some word to him which made him afraid now if
he see me again thu in a hut where he know you to be alon he will
think that i am a ghost and hi heart will turn to ic and the strength
of hi hand to water and then befor he can find hi strength again
i shall make an end of him with the spear as i know well how to do
although i am so small and we will fly
is there no other wai murmur suzann aghast
none swallow for you the choic li between wit thi deed
andswart piet ordeath nai you need not wit it even if you
will do as i tell you present when i give the word loosen the bar
of the doorboard then crouch by the hole and utter a low cry of fear
call to the man on guard for help he will enter and see me whereon
you can creep through the doorhol and wait without leav me to deal
with him if i succe i will be with you at onc if i fail run to the
stream and hoot like an owl when zinti who is hidden there will join
you then you must get out of the krantz as best you can onli on man
watch the entranc and if need zinti can shoot him the schimmel
and other hors ar hidden in the wood and he will lead you to them
mount and ride for home or anywher awai from thi accurs place and
at time when you talk of the matter of your escap with your husband
think kindli of sihamba ngenyanga nai do not answer for there is
littl time to lose quick now to the doorhol and do as i bade
you
so like on in a dream suzann loosen the bar and crouch by
the entranc to the hut utter a low wail of terror sai help me
soldier help me swiftli in the kaffir tongu the man without heard
and push down the board crept in at onc sai who harm you
ladi as he rose to hi feet then suddenli in thi hut where there
wa but on woman a white woman whom he himself had carri into it
he beheld anoth womansihamba and hi hair stood up upon hi head
and hi ey grew round with terror ye it wa sihamba herself for
the light of the candl shone full upon her or rather her ghost
and she wa hang to the roof the tip of her toe just touch the
ground as onc he had seen her hang befor
for some second the man stare in hi terror and while he stare
suzann slip from the hut then mutter it is the spirit of the
witch sihamba who prophesi my deathher spirit that haunt me he
drop to hi knee and trembl like a leaf turn to creep from
the hut next second he wa dead dead without a sound for sihamba
wa a doctoress and knew well where to thrust with the spear
of all thi suzann heard noth and saw noth till present
sihamba stood by her side hold the skin cape in on hand and the
spear in the other
now on danger is done with she said quietli as she put on the cape
but mani still remain follow me swallow and go to the edg
of the stream she hoot like an owl whereupon zinti came out of the
reed look veri cold and frighten
be swift whisper sihamba and thei start along the krantz at a
run befor thei were half wai across it the stormcloud which had
been thin gradual broke up altogeth and the moon shone out
with a bright light show them as plainli as though it were dai but
as it chanc thei met nobodi and were seen of none
at length thei reach the cleft in the rock that led to the plain
below stai here said sihamba while i look and she crept to the
entranc present she return and said
a man watch there and it is not possibl to slip past him becaus
of the moonlight now i know of onli on thing that we can do and you
zinti must do it slip down the rock and cover the man with your gun
sai to him that if he stir a hand or speak a word you will shoot
him dead hold him thu till we ar past you on our wai to the wood
then follow us as best you can but do not fire except to save your life
or our
now the gift of zinti lai rather in track and rememb path and
direct than in fight men so that when he heard thi order he wa
afraid and hesit but when she saw it sihamba turn upon him so
fierc that he fear her more than the watchman and went at onc
so that thi man who wa half asleep suddenli saw the muzzl of a roer
within three pace of hi head and heard a voic command him to stand
still and silent or die thu he stood inde until he perceiv that
the new wife of hi chief wa escap then rememb what would be
hi fate at the hand of bullhead he determin to take hi chanc of
be shot and turn suddenli sped toward the kraal shout as he
ran whereon zinti fire at him but the ball went wide a cannon could
scarc have made more nois than did the great roer in the silenc
of the night as the report of it echo to and fro among the hill
oh fool to fire and yet greater fool to miss said sihamba to the
hors swift swift
thei ran as the wind run and now thei were in the wood and now thei
had found the beast
prais to the snake of my hous said sihamba thei ar safe all
four of them and veri quickli thei unti the riem by which thei had
fasten the hors to the tree
mount swallow said sihamba seiz the head of the great
schimmel
suzann set her foot upon the shoulder of zinti who knelt to receiv
it and sprang into the saddl then have lift sihamba on the
grei mare zinti mount the other hors himself hold the mule by a
lead riem
which wai mistress he ask
homeward she answer and thei canter forward through the wood
on the further side of thi wood wa a littl slope plain not more
than three hundr pace wide and beyond it lai the seaward nek through
which thei must pass on their journei to the stead alreadi thei were
out of the wood and upon the plain when from their right a bodi of
horsemen swoop toward them seven in all of whom on the leader
wa swart piet himself cut them off from the nek thei halt their
hors as though to a word of command and speak rapidli sihamba
ask of zinti is there ani other pass through yonder rang for thi
on is bar to us
none that i know of he answer but i have seen that the ground
behind us is flat and open as far as the great peak which you saw rise
on the plain awai beyond the skylin
good said sihamba let us head for the peak sinc we have nowher
els to go and if we ar separ let us agre to meet upon it
southern slope now zinti loos the mule for we have our live to
save and ride on rememb that death is behind you
chapter xix
how the schimmel cross the red water
when thei turn their hors head swart piet and hi men were not
much more than a hundr pace from them but in the wood thei gain
much ground for he did not think that thei would dare to leav it and
hunt for them there while thei were race over the open plain more
than a mile awai at last he caught sight of them cross a distant
ridg and the long chase began for hour after hour thei gallop on
through the moonlight across the wide and roll veldt until the moon
sank and thei must pick their wai as best thei could in the dark
then came the dawn and still thei rode forward though now the hors
were begin to grow weari except the schimmel who pull upon
hi bit as though he were fresh from the stabl in front of them some
twenti mile awai rose the lofti peak for which thei were head and
behind lai the great expans of plain which thei had pass suzann
look back over her shoulder but there wa no on in sight
let us halt she said and rest ourselv and the hors so thei
pull up by a stream and suffer the beast to drink some water
though not much while thei themselv devour biltong of which thei
had a littl in the saddlebag
why do we ride for the peak ask suzann
becaus there ar place where we mai lie hid sihamba answer and
thenc we can make our wai down to the seashor and so back homeward
wherea here upon the plain we can be seen from mile awai
do ani peopl live on the peak
ye swallow it is the home of the great chief sigw the
chiefparamount of the red kaffir who count hi spear by thousand
but i have heard that he is awai to the north upon a war which he make
against some of the swazi tribe with whom he ha a quarrel
will the peopl of sigw protect us sihamba
perhap we shall see at least you ar safer with them than in the
hand of swart piet
at thi moment zinti who wa watch the plain over which thei had
travel utter a cry of warn look back thei saw the reason
of it for there cross the crest of a wave of ground not more than
a mile awai were five horsemen ride hard upon their spoor
swart piet and four of hi men said sihamba and by my spirit
thei have fresh hors thei must have taken them from the kraal of the
halfbre which we pass at daybreak and that is why we lost sight of
them for a while
now even as zinti help her to mount the schimmel suzann turn so
faint with terror that she almost fell to the ground again
have no fear swallow said sihamba he ha not caught us yet and a
voic in me sai that we shall escap him
but though she spoke thu brave in her heart sihamba wa much afraid
for except the schimmel their hors were almost spent wherea van
vooren wa fresh mount and not a mile behind still thei gallop
forward till thei reach a more broken stretch of veldt where tree
grew singli and here and there were kloof with bush in them
mistress cri zinti my hors can go no more and bullhead is hard
upon us of your wisdom tell me what i should do or present i must be
kill
ride into that kloof and hide yourself answer sihamba for
bullhead will never seek you there he hunt the white swallow not the
black finch afterward you can follow on our spoor and if you cannot
find us make your wai back to the baa botmar and tell him all you
know quick into the kloof for here thei cannot see you
i hear you ladi said zinti and the next minut thei saw him lead
hi weari hors into the shelter of the thick bush for the poor beast
could carri him no more
for the next three mile the ground trend downward to the bank of a
great river beyond which were the gentl rise slope that surround
the foot of the high peak on thei gallop the schimmel never
falter in hi swing stride although hi flank grew thin and hi
ey larg but with the grei mare it wa otherwis for though she wa
a gallant nag her strength wa gone inde with ani heavier rider
upon her back er thi she would have fallen but still she answer to
sihamba voic and plung on roll and stumbl in her gait
she will last till the river she said see suzann look at the
mare
and then gasp suzann glanc behind her to where not five
hundr yard awai swart piet and hi kaffir hunt them sullenli and
in silenc as strong dog hunt down a wound buck
and thenwho know answer sihamba and thei went on without more
word for thei had no breath to spare
now not half a mile awai thei came in sight of the river which had
been hidden from them befor by the lie of the ground and a groan of
despair broke from their lip for it wa in flood ye the storm in
the mountain had swollen it and it roll toward the sea a red flood
of foamfleck water wellnigh two hundr yard from bank to bank
still thei rode on for thei dare not stop and present behind them
thei heard a shout of triumph and knew that their pursuer had also
seen the red water and rejoic becaus now thei had them in a trap
within ten yard of the lip of the river the grei mare stop
suddenli shiver like a leaf in the wind and sank to the ground
now swallow said sihamba as she slip from the saddl you must
choos between that rage torrent and swart piet if you choos the
torrent the great hors is still strong and he mai swim through i can
sai no more
and you ask suzann
i i bide here and oh i would that zinti had left the gun with me
never cri suzann togeth we will live or die mount i
saymount nai if you refus i will throw myself into the water befor
your ey
then see that she would inde do no less sihamba took her
outstretch hand and place her foot upon the foot of suzann
scrambl up upon the pad in front of her whereat the pursuer who
now were littl over two hundr yard awai laugh out loud and
swart piet shout to suzann to yield but thei did not laugh long
for sihamba have first bent her head and kiss suzann on the hand
lean forward and began to stroke the schimmel neck and to whisper
into hi ear till inde it seem as though the great brute that love
her understood at the least he prick hi ear and toss hi head
then look first round at the hors that drew near and next at the
foam flood in front
sit fast swallow said sihamba and then she cri a word aloud to
the hors and struck it lightli with her hand at the sound of that
word the stallion drew himself togeth sprang forward with two bound
over the ten pace of level bank and leapt far out into the flood that
foam beneath down sank the hors and hi rider till the red water
close over their head then thei rose again and heard the shout of
wonder of their enemi who by now had almost reach the bank with
a yell of rage black piet rode hi hors at the river for to do him
justic he wa a brave man but do what he might it would not face it
so with the other he sat still and watch
now the schimmel struck out brave head for the other bank but
in the fierc current it wa not possibl that ani hors should reach it
swim in a straight line for the weight of the stream wa too great
sihamba had note howev that from the further shore but two
or three hundr pace lower down the river a littl point of land
project into it and thi the hors had seen also or perhap she told
him of it at least for that point he swam steadili in five minut
thei were in the centr of the torrent and here it ran with a roar
and mighti forc so that it wave began to break over the schimmel
head and thei fear that he would drown so much did sihamba fear it
inde that she slip from hi back and leav suzann to cling
to the saddl caught hold of hi mane float alongsid of him
and protect by hi neck from the whirl of the water ly thu she
continu to call to the hors and to urg him forward and ever he
answer to her word so that although twice he nearli sank in the
end he set hi feet upon a sandbank and have rest there a while
plung forward half wade and half swim to the project point
of land up which he scrambl still carri suzann and drag
sihamba with him until onc more thei found themselv safe upon the
solid earth where he stood shake himself and snort
suzann slip from the saddl and lai flat upon the ground look at
the aw water thei had pass and by her lai sihamba present the
littl doctoress spoke
it is well to have live she said if onli to have dare that deed
for no other have ever made the passag across the red water in flood
two of them on on tire hors and she caught in her arm the muzzl
of the schimmel that hung abov her press it to her breast as
though it had been a child whereon the brute whinni faintli know
well that she wa thank him for hi toil and courag
i prai god that i mai never be call upon to make it again answer
suzann stagger to her feet the water run from her drip
dress as she turn to look across the river
now when van vooren hors refus to face the stream he had ridden
up and down shout like a madman onc even he lift hi gun and
point it then let it fall again rememb that he could not make
sure of hit the hors and that if he did so suzann must certainli
be drown when thei were quit beyond hi reach in the middl of the
stream he stood still and watch until he saw them come to the further
shore in safeti then he call hi men about him and consult with
them and the end of it wa that thei rode off in a bodi up the bank of
the river
thei go to seek a ford said suzann
ye swallow but now we shall have the start of them come let us
mount
so thei climb upon the back of the schimmel and onc more he went
on with them not fast for now he could not even canter but ambl
or walk accord to the natur of the ground at a rate perhap of
seven mile the hour soon thei had left the river and were toil
up the slope of the peak until present thei struck a wellworn
footpath
i think that thi must lead to the town of sigw said sihamba
i prai that it doe answer suzann and that it is not far for i
feel as though death were near to me
keep a great heart said sihamba for we have met death face to face
and conquer him
so still thei toil on till at length the path took a turn and there
in a fold of the hill thei beheld the great kraal of sigw a veri
larg kaffir town befor the kraal wa a wide open space and on that
space arm men were assembl sever full regiment of them in front
of thi impi wa gather a compani of chief
now we have no choic said sihamba and turn the schimmel toward
them while all that armi stare at thi strang sight of two women
on tall and fair on black and littl ride toward them mount
togeth upon a great blood hors which wa so weari that he could
scarc set on foot befor the other
when thei reach the captain sihamba slip to the ground but
suzann remain seat upon the schimmel
who ar you ask a broad man in a leopardskin cloak of sihamba
but although she wa small and dishevel her hair and garment be
wet with water he did not laugh at her for he saw that thi stranger
had the air of on who is of the blood of chief
i am sihamba ngenyanga the doctoress of whom you mai have heard she
answer and some of the peopl said we have heard of her she is a
great doctoress
to what peopl do you belong sihamba ask the captain again
i belong to the peopl of zwide whom chaka drove from zululand and
by birth i am a chieftai of the umpondwana who live in the mountain
umpondwana and who were the children of zwide but ar now the children
of chaka
why then do you wander so far from home sihamba
for thi reason when zwide and hi peopl the endwandw were driven
back my peopl the umpondwana who were subject to zwide made peac
with chaka against my will therefor becaus i would not live as a
zulu dog i left them
although your bodi is small you have a larg heart said the captain
and on of hi peopl cri out the stori of sihamba is true for
when you sent me as messeng to the endwandw i heard itit is a tale
there
then the captain ask and who is the beauti white woman who sit
upon the great hors
she is my mother and my sister and my mistress whom i serv till
death for she save me from death and her name is swallow
now at thi word swallow most of those present start and some
utter exclam of wonder especi a littl band of peopl men
and women who stood to the left and who from their dress and other
token it wa easi to see were witchdoctor and divin sihamba note
the movement and word of wonder but pretend to see noth she
went on
the ladi swallow and i have fled hither from far hope to find the
chief sigw for we need hi counsel and protect but he is awai
make war to the north is it not so
nai answer the captain i am the chief sigw and i have not yet
begun my war
i am glad said sihamba chief listen to my tale and suffer us to
creep into the shadow of your strength and in a few word she told
them the stori of the captur of suzann by swart piet and of their
flight from him now when she spoke of van vooren or of bullhead
rather for she call him by hi nativ name she saw that sigw and
the captain look at each other and when she told how thei had swum
the red water in flood the two of them upon on hors she wa sure
that thei did not believ her for such a deed thei thought to be
imposs but still sihamba went on and endedchief we seek thi
from you protect from bullhead who doubtless will be here er
long and an escort of spear to lead us down the coast to the home
of the swallow a hundr mile awai where thei and you will be well
reward for the servic answer us quick chief i prai you for our
need is great and we ar weari
chapter xx
the omen of the white swallow
now sigw and two of hi captain walk to where the divin stood and
took counsel with them speak low and earnestli then he return and
said
sihamba walkerbymoonlight and you ladi swallow listen to me a
wonder thing ha come to pass in the kraal of sigw thi dai such
a thing as our father have not known you see that my host is gather
yonder well tomorrow thei start to make war upon these veri endwandw
of whom you have spoken becaus of a deadli insult which thei have put
upon me and my hous therefor accord to custom thi morn the
soldier were assembl at dawn to be doctor and that the divin
might search out the omen of the war so the divin search and she
who wa chosen among them at the medicin and sank into the witch sleep
here befor us all ye thi on and he point to a tall woman with
dreami ey who wa bedizen with bone and snakeskin
now in her sleep she spoke and we hung upon her word for we knew
that thei would be the word of omen sihamba these were the word as
all can testifi
thu sai the spirit of your father and thu speak the snake of
your tribe unless a white swallow guid your footstep in the war
with the men of the mountain you shall perish and your impi shall be
scatter but if a white swallow fli befor your spear than but
littl of your blood shall be shed and you shall return with honour and
with on whom you seek onli the swallow shall not return with you for
if she set her face southward then sigw woe to you and your armi
sihamba these were the word of the dreamer scarc wa she awak
again while we wonder at their strang and ask her question
of their mean which she could not answer for here the wisdom of
the wisest wa at fault lo you rode over the hill and with you a
beauti white woman whose name you sai is swallow ye thi is the
white swallow who shall fly in front of my regiment bring me honour
and good fortun in the war and therefor sihamba your prayer is
grant though not all of it for you shall go northward and not
southward and among your own peopl i will leav you and the swallow
with you and for her sake i will spare your peopl the peopl of
umpondwana although thei ar subject to my foe the endwandw and of
the same blood moreov while you ar among us all honour shall be
done to you and the swallow and of the cattl we captur a tenth part
shall be the swallow still i tell you thi that had it not been for
the omen of the divin i would have refus your prayer and deliv
you and the swallow over to bullhead for with him i have sworn
friendship long ago but now the face of thing is chang and should
he come with a hundr men arm with gun yet i will protect you from
him and the swallow also ye though oath must be broken to do it
when thei heard thi sai suzann and sihamba look at each other in
dismai
ala said suzann it seem that we do but chang on prison for
anoth for now we must be born awai to the far north to do battl
with thi kaffir chief and there be left among your peopl so that
none will know what ha becom of us and the heart of ralph will break
with doubt and sorrow ye and those of my parent also
it is bad answer sihamba but had not yonder divin dream that
dream of a swallow it would have been wors better is it to travel in
all honour with the impi of sigw than to be drag back by bullhead
to hi secret kraali to be done to death there and you to the choic
of which you know for the rest we must take our chanc and escap when
the time come and meanwhil we will send a messag to the stead
now suzann heard her and sat upon the hors think for her troubl
wa sore still she could see no wai out of the net which had mesh
her as she thought a man who wa herd cattl on the mountain
ran up to the chief and salut him sai that five men on of them
white rode toward hi kraal when suzann heard thi she hesit no
more but cri out to the chief sigw speak in the kaffir tongu
which she knew well
chief sigw swear to me that you will not suffer bullhead so much as
to touch me or my sister sihamba and that while we dwell with you you
will treat us with all honour and i who am name swallow ye i
the white swallow of the divin dream will lead your armi to the
northern land bring you the good fortun which is mine to give to
other though myself i know it not
i swear by the spirit of my father ladi answer sigw and these
my counsellor and headmen swear it also
ye echo the counsellor we swear it all of it and while on
of us is left aliv the oath shall be fulfil o white bird of good
omen
then sigw gave an order and at hi bid five hundr soldier
the half of a regiment ran up and form a circl about sihamba and
suzann who still sat upon the schimmel white face and weari her
hair hang down her back scarc wa the circl made when from
round the shoulder of the hill appear swart piet and with him hi four

at their chief bid the soldier of the guard sprang forward
and fall upon van vooren and those with him thei flog them with
stick and the shaft of their spear until from head to foot thei were
noth but blood and bruis and thu thei drove them out of the town
of sigw back to the ford of the red river
when thei were gone suzann who through it all had sat upon the hors
watch in silenc now urg him forward to where sigw stood and
said
chief i thank you for that deed and now i prai you give us food
and a hut to rest in for we ar wet and hungri and worn out with long
travel
so the guest master led them into the fenc of the town and gave them
the guest hut the largest in the kraal and the best food that thei
hadmilk and meal and beef and egg as much as thei would of it the
schimmel also wa fasten to a post in the littl courtyard of the
hut and a kaffir who onc had serv as groom to a white man wash
him all over with warm water afterward he wa given a mash of meal to
eat and later when he wa a littl rest hi fill of good forag
which he at gladli for though he wa veri tire and hi leg were
somewhat swollen otherwis he wa none the wors for that great ride
in the shelter of the hut suzann took off her cloth rememb with
a sort of wonder how she had put them on on the morn of her marriag
which now seem year ago and bath herself with water then sihamba
have given the garment to a wait woman to wash wrap her in a
soft kaross of fur and after drink some milk and eat a littl
suzann laid herself down upon a mattress made of the husk of meali
cob and even as she thank god who had brought her safe through so
mani danger past and prai him to protect her in those that were
to come and to comfort the heart of her husband in hi sick and
afflict she fell asleep when she saw her sleep but not befor
sihamba crept to her feet for now that all wa over she could scarc
walk and lai herself down there slept also
all the rest of the dai thei slept and all the night that follow
nor did thei wake till sunris of the next morn when women of the
household of the chief knock upon the doorboard to ask if thei need
aught then thei rose feel well and strong again except for the
stiff of their limb and suzann cloth herself in the garment
that the woman had wash comb her dark hair with a kaffir comb
afterward thei at heartili of the good food that wa brought to
them and left the hut to visit the schimmel that thei found almost
recov and devour kaffir sugarcan though like themselv he wa
somewhat stiff
present while thei stroke and fondl him a messeng came sai
that if it pleas the ladi swallow the chief sigw would take counsel
with her in the place of audienc so after a littl while thei went
and as thei pass out of the kraal fenc suzann wa receiv with a
chief salut by the escort that wa wait for her then surround
her and sihamba thei led them to the place of audienc a circl of
ground enclos by a high doubl fenc and as suzann enter it onc
more all present there includ sigw himself gave her the salut of
chief
but though it wa strang enough that such a thing should happen to a
white woman at the time suzann took littl notic of the salut or
aught els for there stand befor her look much bewild and
veri weari wa none other than zinti and with him sihamba hors and
also that mule laden with good which thei had abandon in the wood
nearli a hundr mile awai when thei came face to face with van
vooren and hi rider and turn to begin their long flight for life and
liberti
chapter xxi
the vision of ralph and suzann
sihamba said the chief sigw thi man who wa found wander upon
the outskirt of the town declar that he is your servant and that he
come to seek you is it so
it is so inde chief she answer though i scarc expect to
see him again and she told how thei two and zinti had part
then zinti wa command to tell hi tale and from it it seem that
after he had rest some hour in the kloof he crept to the mouth of it
and hidden behind a stone saw swart piet and hi servant pass quit
close to him on their homeward wai a sorri sight thei were for three
of their hors were lame so that the rider were oblig to walk
and lead them and the men themselv had been so bruis with the
spearshaft that thei seem more dead than aliv swart piet rode last
of all and just then he turn and look toward the peak shook hi
fist as though threaten it and curs aloud in dutch and kaffir
inde zinti said that hi head and face were so swollen with blow
that had it not been for hi larg round ey he could not have known
him and sihamba thought that veri good tide
well when thei had gone zinti took heart for it wa plain that thei
had been roughli handl and had fail to catch hi mistress or the
swallow so he went back to where he had left hi hors eat a littl
grass and sinc it wa too weak to carri him he led it follow van
vooren spoor backward till in the even he came to the ford of the
red river here he halt for the night kneehalt the hors and
leav it loos to graze though he himself had noth to eat at the
first grei of dawn he awok and wa astonish to see a second anim
feed with the hors which prove to be none other than the mule
that as these creatur sometim will had follow the spoor of
hi companion sihamba hors till it found it again after thi he
cross the drift ride slowli and lead the mule till shortli
after sunris he came to the outskirt of the town where sigw
watchmen found him and brought him to the chief
thi man is a servant worth have said sigw when he had heard the
stori let food be given to him and to the beast
when zinti had gone sigw spoke to suzann
ladi swallow he said as you have heard by the command of the
spirit of my ancestor speak through the mouth of the divin while
you ar with us you and not i ar the captain of my armi and must
lead it in thi great war which i make against the endwandw now the
regiment ar readi to march and i ask if it be your pleasur that
we should set out tomorrow at the dawn for time press and the
endwandw live veri far awai
your will is my will chief she answer for she could see no wai
of escap from thi strang journei but i desir to learn the caus
of thi war which i must lead by the decre of the spirit of your
ancestor
now sigw gave an order to some attend wait upon him who went
awai to return present lead with them a woman thi woman wa about
fifti year of ag veri fat in person sourfac yellowtooth and
with on ey onli
there is the caus exclaim the chief at the same time turn hi
back upon the woman and spit upon the ground as though in disgust
i do not understand said suzann
then listen ladi swallow sikonyana the chief of the endwandw ha a
sister name batwa whose beauti is famou throughout all the world
and for her by my envoi i made an offer of marriag intend that
she should be my head wife for i desir to be the husband of the most
beauti woman in the world
i saw batwa when she wa still a child broke in sihamba inde she
is my cousin and it is true that she is most beauti
the chief sikonyana went on sigw answer me that he wa much
honour by my offer sinc he knew me to be the greatest man of all thi
countri but that at the same time hi sister wa not to be won with a
small price yet if i would send a thousand head of cattl half of
them black and half white she should be mine then with much pain
i collect these cattl two year did it take me to gather them
togeth for here oxen and cow pure white and pure black ar not
common and i sent them with an impi to guard them for noth less
would suffic to the kraal of the chief of the endwandw
four moon wa that impi gone while i await it return eat out
my heart with impati at length it did return bring with it my
bride at nightfal it march into the town hungri and tire for it
had suffer much upon the journei and twice had been forc to give
battl to the armi of other chief but although i wa eager to
see her i did not look upon my new wife that night no i sent out
messeng and gather togeth all my armi and all the peopl young
and old yonder in the plain of assembl then when thei were muster
from far and near i command that batwa the sister of sikonyana
should be produc in the face of the peopl that her loveli might
shine upon me and upon them as the sun shine equal upon us all
ladi swallow the moment came and thi old woman wa brought out
ye she strut befor us proudli thi oneei hag thi cat of the
mountain for her i had sent an impi for her i had paid a thousand
head of cattl half of them pure black and half pure white and
sigw ceas gasp with rage
now at thi stori suzann who had not smile for dai laugh aloud
while even sihamba the wise look down studi the earth but there
wa on who did not laugh and it wa the oneei woman no she sprang
up and scream aloud
dog of a red kaffir who ar you that dare to talk thu of a princess
of the blood of the endwandw a princess whom chaka the great king
wish to take to wife you ask for batwa in marriag batwa the
sister to sikonyana and i am batwa the sister of sikonyana
then hag there must be two batwa shout sigw in answer
two batwa she scream fool and beast there ar four in our
race all the women of the royal blood ar name batwa and i am the
eldest and the wisest and the best of them for i am older than my
brother sikonyana by twenti year i who have had three husband and
outliv them all wherea the chit of whom you talk a thing with a
waist like a reed and an ey like a sick buck is hi junior by ten
year be a child of our father last wife
it mai be so answer sigw for aught i know everi woman of your
accurs tribe is name batwa but thi i sai that everi soon there
will be few batwa left to look upon the sun for tomorrow i march
against them and i will stamp the hous of batwa flat and you i will
hang to the rooftre of the hut of the chief your brother ye i keep
you aliv that i mai hang you there so until then you have noth to
fear from me
is it is is it so inde shriek the virago then i am safe for
littl red kaffir i shall live to see you and your coward beaten out
of the countri of the endwandw with whip of hide
take her awai groan sigw befor i break my word and hang her at
onc which i do not wish to do and batwa the eldest wa led off still
scream curs
when she had gone after consult apart for a while with sihamba
suzann spoke
now chief she said i understand the caus of thi war and in truth
it is a strang on still as i must lead your armi and as i do not
love to see men kill for such a quarrel here and befor we start i
will lai down the term of peac if it should pleas sikonyana and the
peopl of the endwandw to accept them subject to your wisdom thei
shall be these if sikonyana will give to you that batwa whom you desir
in the place of the batwa whom you do not desir pai back to you the
thousand head of cattl and by wai of fine for hi deceit if inde he
meant to deceiv you for you do not seem to have told him which of the
mani batwa you sought two thousand other head of cattl then no blood
shall be shed and you and your impi shall return in peac and honour
if he will not do thi then the war must go as it is fate sai do you
consent as i counsel you to do for otherwis although i go with you my
goodwil will not go sinc i am the swallow of peac and not the hawk
of war
now there follow a great indaba or debat between sigw and hi
counsellor and captain some of them take on view of the matter
and some of them the other but the end of it wa that the parti of
peac prevail it be agre between them that if the endwandw
would grant these term and in addit an ox for everi man who might
die or be kill upon the journei the impi should return without
put the matter to the chanc of war and thi the chief and hi
counsellor swore solemnli to suzann inde sigw wa glad to swear
it for he sought that batwa for whom he long rather than the danger
of battl and the risk of defeat in a far land while those who were for
fight at all cost thought that the oath meant littl sinc thei did
not believ that the great sikonyana would make peac upon such term
when thi matter wa settl suzann prai the chief that he would
allow her to send zinti as a messeng to her husband and father to tell
them that she live and wa well but on thi matter and thi onli
sigw would not listen to her and though he gave mani reason for hi
refus the true on wa that he fear lest the white men on learn
her whereabout should gather a commando and send it to take her from
him as doubtless we should have done had it been in ani wai possibl
inde the foolish dream of the divin as to the lead of hi armi
by a white swallow follow as it chanc to be by the arriv at
hi town of a woman who wa name swallow had taken such a hold of
sigwewho like all savag wa veri superstitiousthat for noth
which could have been offer to him would he have consent to let
suzann go until the war with the endwandw wa finish rather than
do so he would have fought till the last and he issu an order that
if ani man woman or child spoke of suzann presenc in hi town to
stranger thei should be put to death without merci moreov in hi
terror lest she should escap he set a guard over her and sihamba dai
and night and other guard over the hors and the lad zinti so that
thei soon learn that all hope of flight must be abandon and that it
wa not possibl even to send a messeng or a letter
as mai be guess thi wa a sore grief to suzann so great a grief
that when thei were back in the guesthut she wept long and bitterli
for her heart ach with her own sorrow and she knew well how deep
would be the torment of mind of ralph if he still live and of us her
father and mother when we learn that she had vanish quit awai
and that none could tell what her fate had been at first she thought of
bid zinti slip awai under cover of the night but sihamba show her
that even if he could do so which wa not like the end of it must
be that he would be follow and put to death and that then hi blood
would be upon their hand and no good done afterward she tri to
bribe and to command sever men of her guard to take the messag but
in thi matter alon the peopl of sigw would not obei her for thei
knew the doom which await them if thei listen to her plead so
when she spoke thei look into the air over her head and did not seem
to hear although afterward thei report her word to sigw whereupon
that chief doubl the guard set a second to watch the first
and now i have to tell you on of the strangest thing in the strang
stori of the love of ralph kenzi and my daughter suzann it will
be rememb that it wa by mean of a dreamor so the child
declaredthat suzann wa led to where the boi ralph lai alon and
starv in the kloof so now in thi second great crisi of their
live it wa by mean of a dream that comfort wa brought to the heart
of both of them enabl them as i believ to bear the terror of
those long year of tidingless terror and separ that otherwis
would have broken down their mind and perhap have kill them
it seem as suzann told me in after dai that befor she slept that
night there in the guesthut of sigw she prai long and earnestli
as those who have faith do prai when thei lie under the shadow of an
overwhelm grief she prai that god would bring about what she wa
unabl to bring about name that her husband should learn that she
wa unharm and well and that she might learn how it went with him
see that for aught she knew by now he might be dead of hi wound
well that prayer wa heard for i myself can testifi to it as
the prayer of faith is so often heard ye that which seem to be
imposs wa done for in the watch of the night these two who lai a
hundr mile apart on of them a prison in the town of a savag
and the other helpless upon a bed of pain had sight and speech of each
other
still prai suzann fell asleep then of a sudden it seem as though
space had no bar for her for she awok or thought that she awok in
the guesthut of sigw sinc she could hear the breath of sihamba at
her side and stretch out her hand she touch her face but in the
twinkl of an ey there came a chang for still wide awak now
she wa stand in the stead at home just within the door of her
own sleepingroom there upon the bed lai her husband fever and
unconsci but mutter to himself while bend over him were i
her mother and a strang man whom she did not know but who as
she guess must have been rous from hi sleep for hi hair wa
dishevel and he wa halfcloth
to thi man she heard meher mothertalk the fever run so high
doctor i said that i made bold to wake you from your rest for i
fear lest it should burn hi life awai thereupon she saw the man look
at ralph feel hi puls and heard him answer as he examin the
bandag of the wound hi hurt doe well and i do not think that the
fever come from it it come from hi mind and it is there that the
danger li for who can doctor a broken heart
heaven onli i repli
ye he said heaven onli and now vrouw botmar go and rest awhil
hope for the best for you will hear him if he wake up but he will
not wake sinc the sleepdraught that i gave him hold him fast
then she saw us both goth doctor back to hi bed and me to a settl
with mattress on it which wa place just outsid hi door
here i would stop my tale to sai that thi thing happen and that
those word which suzann heard while her bodi lai in sigw guesthut
pass between the doctor who wa sleep at the stead and myself
at on oclock of the morn on the third night after the night of
the take of suzann and moreov that i never spoke of them to ani
live creatur until suzann repeat them to me in later year nor
could the doctor have told them to her for he went awai to the provinc
of graff reinet where shortli afterward he wa kill by a fall from
hi hors
then it seem to suzann that she move to the bedsid of her husband
and bend down kiss him upon the forehead which wa hot to her
lip sai awak dear love instantli in her vision he awok
with a cry of joi and said suzann how came you here to which she
answer i am not here i have escap unharm from swart piet but
i am a prison in the hand of red kaffir and tomorrow i lead their
armi to the north yet it ha been permit me to visit you husband
and to tell you to be of good comfort and to fear no evil tide for
you will recov and we shall meet again unharm in ani wai though
not till mani dai ar pass
where shall we meet he ask i do not know she answer ye i
see now look befor you
then thei look both of them and there paint in the air thei saw
the pictur of a great mountain stand by itself upon a plain but
with other mountain visibl to the north and south of it thi mountain
wa flattop with precipic of red rock and down it eastern slope
ran five ridg shape like the thumb and finger of a mighti hand
while between the thumb and the first finger as it were a stream
gush out upon the bank of which grew flattop tree with thick
green leav and white bloom
you have seen and you will rememb fear noth she said in her
vision
i have seen and i shall rememb fear noth ralph answer and
with the sound of hi voic still echo in her ear suzann awok
in the guesthut of sigw and onc more heard sihamba breath at her
side and felt the hand which she had outstretch to find her press
against her cheek but now there wa a new sens of comfort in her
heart for she believ that without ani doubt she had seen her husband
and that although thei were separ still the dai would come when
thei should meet again not in the spirit but in the flesh
now i suzann botmar who tell thi tale had scarc left ralph
room upon that veri night and laid myself down upon the settl when he
call to me i ran back to the bed to find him sit up in it wide
awak and calmei
mother he said for so he still name me did you see suzann
hush ralph i answer you ar talk foolishli wherev suzann
mai be ala she is not here
she wa here just now he said smile for we have been talk
togeth she ha escap from swart piet and is unharm but a
prison among the kaffir and mother she and i will meet again upon
a great mountain like a fortress which ha ridg on it eastern side
resembl the thumb and finger of a man and a stream of water gush
out between the thumb and first finger
doubtless doubtless i said for i saw that he wa wander in hi
mind
ah ralph answer you do not believ me but it is true i tell you
that i saw suzann just now wear a fine kaross of tiger skin upon
her shoulder and that she kiss me on the forehead and even as
he spoke he sank into a deep and quiet sleep and when he awok in the
morn we found that the fever had left him and that he wa out of
danger of hi life
chapter xxii
the war of the clean spear
when sihamba aros next dai suzann ask her if the home of her
peopl the umpondwana wa a great mountain face round with slabsid
precipic and have ridg on it eastern face like to the thumb and
finger of a hand with a stream of water gush from between the thumb
and first finger upon the bank of which grew flattop tree with
thick green leav and white flower
sihamba stare at her sai
such is the place inde and there ar no tree like to those you
speak of to be found anywher els the maiden us the flower of them
to adorn their hair and from the leav is made a salv that is veri
good for wound but sai swallow who told you about the mountain
umpondwana that is so far awai sinc i never describ it to you
nobodi told me she answer and she repeat the vision to her or
as much of it as she wish
sihamba listen and when the tale wa done she nod her littl head
sai
so even you white peopl have someth of the power which ha been
given to us kaffir witchdoctor from the begin without a doubt
your spirit spoke to the spirit of your husband last night and i am glad
of it for now although you ar apart from each other the heart of
both of you will be rest now also i am sure that we must go to my
peopl and live among them for so long as mai be appoint see
that there and nowher els you and the baa kenzi will come togeth
again
i had sooner go back to the stead sigh suzann
that cannot be swallow for it is not fate and for the rest if you
meet what doe it matter where you meet
that morn suzann mount upon the great schimmel which by now
had almost recov from hi weari although he wa still somewhat
stiff and follow by sihamba and zinti ride the hors and the
mule pass up and down befor sigw regiment that salut her as
chieftai then amongst much wail of women and children the impi
start northward suzann preced onli by scout and a guard to feel
the wai ride in front of it that she might escap the dust rais by
so mani feet and the hoof of the great herd of oxen that were driven
along to serv as food for the soldier
for fourteen dai journei thei travel thu and dure that time
noth of note happen to them except that twelv men and sihamba
brown mule were lost in cross a flood river whereof there were
mani in their path the countri through which thei pass wa popul
by kaffir but these tribe were too small and scatter to attempt to
oppos so larg an armi nor did the men of sigw do them ani mischief
beyond take such grain and meal as thei requir for food
on the fourteenth dai howev thei reach the boundari of the
territori of a veri power tribe of pondo blood and here thei
halt while messeng were sent forward to the pondo chief sai
that with him sigw had no quarrel and ask for a safeconduct
for the armi while pass through hi land on the third dai these
messeng return accompani by an embassi from the pondo chief
that after much talk though to all appear unwillingli gave sigw
the promis of safeconduct upon condit that he made a present of
ceremoni of on ox to their ruler now sihamba notic that while the
envoi were talk their ey wander all about take note of everi
thing and especi of the number of the soldier and of suzann who
sat besid sigw dure the indaba or council
these ar no true men she thought to herself and made a plan in the
even she visit the camp of the envoi who had heard alreadi that
she wa a famou doctoress and offer her servic to them for payment
should ani of them chanc to need the boon of her magic art thei
laugh answer that thei want neither charm nor divin but
that she should see a certain young man a servant in their train who
wa veri sick with love and had bought philtr from everi doctor in
their countri without avail wherewith to soften the heart of a girl
who would have noth to do with him when sihamba without seem to
speak much of it had drawn from them all that she wish to know of the
stori of thi man and girl and with it other inform though thei
won littl enough from her she took her leav and so set her trap that
at night when all were asleep the young man came to consult her in a
place apart
now she look at him and said at onc without suffer him to speak
let me see your name is soandso and you ar in love with such a
girl who turn awai from you and she went on to tell him thing which
he thought were known onli to himself
wonder he said wonder but sai ladi doctoress can you help
me for my heart is water becaus of thi girl
it is difficult she answer do you know that when you come to
consult a wise woman you should keep your mind fix upon the matter
about which you would take counsel with her from the first moment that
you set out to visit her until you stand in her presenc now thi you
have not done for as you came you were think of other thing ye
you were think about the ambush which is to be set for these peopl
in the pass yonder and therefor i cannot see the girl heart clear
and do not quit know what medicin i should give you to soften it
it is true ladi answer the stupid fellow that i wa think
about the ambush of which i have heard some talk though i do not know
who told you of it
who told me why to my sight your thought ar written on your face
ye thei ran befor you and reach me as i heard your footstep but
now think no more of that matter which ha noth to do with you or
me think onli of the girl and go on think of her and of her onli
until you get back home and give her the medicinethat is if you wish
it to work
i am think ladi he mutter turn hi stupid face up to the
ski
fool be quiet do i not know that ah now i see her heart and i tell
you that you ar lucki for when you have done as i bid you she will
love you more than if you were the greatest chief in all the land then
sihamba gave him a certain harmless powder to sprinkl in the hut where
the girl slept and bade him wait for her on six differ dai when she
came up from bath give her on each dai a garland of fresh flower
a new flower for everi dai
the man thank her and ask what he must pai her for a fee to which
she repli that she took no fee in matter of love sinc her reward
wa to know that she had made two peopl happi but she ad
rememb what i tell you or instead of earn love you will earn
hate sai noth of your visit to me and if you can avoid it do not
speak at all until you have sprinkl the powder in the hut especi
put all thing which do not concern you and her out of your mind and
think onli of her face and how happi you will be when you have marri
her which if you follow my instruct you will shortli do
now the young man went awai as though he were walk upon air and
inde so close did he obei her that he wa dismiss by hi master
as a dumb fool befor he reach home again but whether or no sihamba
medicin soften the heart of the maid i have not heard
so soon as he wa gone sihamba sent zinti to bring sigw and two of hi
gener to the place where she and suzann were encamp in a booth
made of branch and long grass when thei were come she told them of
what she had learn from the lovestricken lad ad that thi plan
of make sure of what alreadi she had suspect had been born in the
brain of the swallow although she had carri it out for when she
deem that she could serv her mistress or win her honour sihamba
thought less of the truth than she should have done
on learn thi tide sigw and hi captain were full of wrath and
spoke of make war upon the pondo chief at onc but sihamba said
listen the swallow ha whisper a better wai into my ear it is
thi the embassi of the pondo leav at dawn and you must bid them
farewel tell them that you will follow and camp tomorrow night
at the mouth of the pass which you will enter at the next daybreak
meanwhil now at onc we will send out my servant zinti dress like a
pondo lad to search the countri and find if there is not anoth
path by which the pass can be turn for if such a wai exist he will
discov it and report to us tomorrow at nightfal sinc he who is
stupid in mani thing wa born with the gift of seek out road and
rememb them also he know how to be silent if question
the chief and hi captain thought thi plan good and thank the
swallow for it prais her wisdom and within an hour have been
instruct what he must do and where he should meet them zinti wa
despatch upon hi errand
next morn the envoi depart suspect noth and take with
them gift and the ox of ceremoni and that night the armi of sigw
encamp within a mile of the pass to the right and left of which
stretch tall and difficult cliff
about an hour after sunset zinti crept into the camp and ask for food
to eat for he had travel far and wa hungri moreov he had been
chase by some pondo soldier to whom feign the fool he wa commonli
suppos to be he would make no answer when thei question him when
he had eaten he made hi report to sigw suzann and sihamba and the
gist of it wa that he had found a good road by which men might safe
ascend the cliff though not so easili as thei could travel through the
gorg follow thi road he ad thei could pass round the pondo
town avoid it fortif and come out at the cattl kraal
at the back of the town for he had climb a high tree and map out
the rout with hi ey then follow a council of war and the upshot
of it wa that under the leadership of zinti the armi march off in
silenc an hour befor midnight leav it cook fire burn to
deceiv the pondo
thei climb the cliff by the path he show them and travel all
night at dawn found themselv befor the cattl kraal which as
no enemi wa expect were unguard except by the herd these thei
clear of the cattl some thousand of them and march on at speed
send a messag back to the town by the herd that thi wa the luck
which those must expect who attempt to trap the swallow in a snare set
for a rockrabbit
the pondo were veri angri at their loss and gather their strength
follow them for some dai but befor thei could come up with them
sigw and hi armi had reach countri so difficult and so far awai that
the pondo chief thought it wisest to leav them alon so thei march
on take the captur cattl with them and after thi bloodless
victori suzann and sihamba were greatli honour by the soldier and
even the lad zinti wa treat like a chief
now onc more thei reach wild land inhabit onli by scatter
tribe and pass through them at their leisur for thei had plenti of
food to eat although from time to time thei were oblig to encamp upon
the bank of flood river or to hunt for a road over a mountain it
wa on the thirtyfirst dai of their journei that at length thei enter
the territori of the endwandw against whom thei had come to make
war where at onc thei were met by messeng sent by sikonyana the
chief of the endwandw desir to know why thei came upon him with so
great a forc to these men the case wa set out by sigw speak in
hi own name and in that of the swallow as he had promis suzann for
thi wa a savag who kept hi word he offer to refrain from attack
if the young batwa wa exchang for her oneei sister and sent to
him togeth with the thousand head of cattl which he had paid and
two thousand more by wai of fine at first these term were refus but
afterward an embassi came of whom the captain wa the brother of the
king who said that he wa charg to discuss the matter with the white
chieftai name swallow herself and with none other
so suzann accompani onli by sihamba and mount upon the great
schimmel that had come safe and well through all the journei though
the black hors had di of sick rode out a hundr pace in front
of the armi and met the man there she spoke to him well and wise
point out to him that without doubt a trick had been plai upon
sigw which he wa mad to aveng the captain answer that thei were
well abl to fight she repli that thi might be so that thei might
even conquer sigw and drive him back but it could not be done without
great loss to themselv and that if hi tribe were at all weaken
the zulu who hate them would hear of it and take the opportun to
stamp them out
well the end of it wa that the endwandw yield and upon the promis
of suzannefor thei would take no otherthat no spear should be lift
against them thei sent the true batwa a beauti but sullen girl to
sigw take back the old batwa who depart curs him and all hi
race with her thei return also the thousand head of cattl which he
had paid and twelv hundr more by wai of fine for the balanc wa
remit by agreement
and so came to an end the war of sigw with the endwandw which among
the kaffir is still spoken of as the war of the white swallow or
sometim as the war of the clean spear becaus no blood at all wa
shed in it and not a man wa kill by violenc although when sigw
pass through that countri on hi journei home by mean of a clever
trick the pondo chief recaptur most of the cattl that had been taken
from him
chapter xxiii
how suzann becam a chieftai
so the cattl were hand over and the girl batwa wa given to sigw
whom by the wai she made unhappi for the rest of hi dai inde she
brought about hi ruin for be ambiti she persuad him to make
war upon the white peopl in the transkei of which the end wa that
from a great chief he becam a veri small on when all wa accomplish
sigw wait upon suzann
ladi swallow he said in three dai i begin my homeward march and
now i have come to ask whither you wish to go sinc you cannot stop
here in the veldt alon
i would return with you to the transkei she answer and seek out
my own home
ladi he said shamefacedli ala that mai not be you rememb the
dream of the divin and you know how that all which she foretold and
more ha come to pass for you the white swallow appear and flew
in front of my impi and from that hour we have had the best of luck
by your wisdom we outwit the pondo and seiz their cattl by your
wisdom we have conquer the endwandw without lift a singl spear
and that batwa whom i desir is mine while of the great forc which
came out with me to war but twentyon ar dead twelv by drown
eight by sick and on by snakebit all thing have gone well
and she who dream the dream of the white swallow is the greatest of
divin
but ladi thi wa not all the dream for it said that if you the
swallow should set your face southward with us then the best of luck
would turn to the worst for then utter misfortun should overwhelm me
and my regiment now ladi i cannot doubt that as the first part of
the propheci ha come true so the last part would come true also did
i tempt the spirit of my ancestor by disregard it and therefor
white swallow though all i have is your yet you cannot fly home with
us
now suzann plead with him long and earnestli as did sihamba but
without avail for he could not be move inde had he consent the
captain and the armi would have disobei hi order in thi matter
for thei believ everi man of them that to take the swallow with them
homeward would be to run to their own death nor wa it safe that she
should attempt to follow in the path of the impi sinc then in their
superstiti fear thei might send back and kill her to avert the evil
fate
now swallow said sihamba there is but on thing for us to do and
it is to seek refug among my peopl the umpondwana whose mountain
stronghold li at a distanc of four dai journei from thi place but
to speak truth i am not sure how thei will receiv me see that i
part from them in anger twelv year ago have quarrel with them
first about a matter of polici and secondli about a matter of marriag
and that my halfbroth the son of my father by a slave wa promot
to rule in my place still to them we must go and with them we must
stai if thei will suffer it until we find an opportun of travel
south in safeti
if it must be so answer suzann sigh perhap sigw will
escort us to the hous of the umpondwana befor he turn homeward for
thei will think the more of us if thei see us at the head of a great
armi
to thi plan sigw and hi captain assent with glad for thei
love and honour the swallow and were sore at heart becaus their
fear forc them to leav her alon in the wilder but first thei
made sure that the mountain umpondwana lai to the west and not to the
south for not on step to the southward would thei allow suzann to
travel with them
on the morrow then thei march and the even of the third dai
thei set their camp in a mountain pass which led to a wide plain befor
sunris next morn sihamba woke suzann
dress yourself swallow she said and come to see the light break on
the hous of my peopl
so thei went out in the grei dawn and climb a koppi in the mouth of
the pass look befor them at first thei could distinguish noth
for all the plain beneath wa a sea of mist through which in the
distanc loom someth like a mountain till present the rai
of the rise sun struck upon it and the veil of vapour part
like curtain that ar drawn back and there befor them wa the
mountainfortress of umpondwana separ from the pass by a great space
of mistclad plain suzann look and knew it
sihamba she said it is the place of my vision and none other see
the straight side of red rock the five ridg upon the eastern slope
fashion like the thumb and finger of the hand of a man ye and
there between the thumb and first finger a river run
i told you that it wa so from the begin swallow for in all the
countri there is no other such hill as thi and becaus of the aspect
of those ridg when seen from a distanc it is name the mountain of
the great hand
befor the word had left her lip anoth voic spoke at the sound of
which suzann nearli fell to the earth
good dai to you suzann it said in dutch and wa silent
sihamba did you hear sihamba she gasp do i dream or did piet
van vooren speak to me
you did not dream answer sihamba for that voic wa the voic of
swart piet and no other and he is hidden somewher among the rock
of yonder cliff wall quick swallow kneel behind thi stone lest he
should shoot
she obei and at that moment the voic spoke again out of the shadow
of the cliff that border the pass twenti or thirti pace from them
what suzann it said is that littl witchdoctoress tell you
that i shall fire on you had i wish i could have shot you three time
over while you were stand upon that rock but why should i desir to
kill on who will be my lover sihamba i wish to shoot inde but her
familiar set her so that the bullet must pass through you to reach her
heart suzann you ar go to hide yourself among the peopl of the
umpondwana oh ye i know your plan well when onc you ar behind
the wall of that mountain it mai be difficult to speak to you for a
while so listen to me you thought that you had left me far awai did
you not but i have follow you step by step and twice i have been
veri near to you although i could never find a chanc to carri you off
safe well i wish to tell you that sooner or later i shall find that
chanc sooner or later you will come out of the mountain or i shall get
into it and then it will be my turn so love till that hour fare you
well stai i forgot i have new for you your husband the english
castawai is dead
at thi tide a low moan of pain broke from suzann lip
be silent and take no heed whisper sihamba who wa kneel at her
side behind the shelter of the stone he doe but lie to torment you
the bullet and the water togeth were too much for him went on swart
piet and he di on the second night after he reach the stead your
father came to seek me in the place you know and wa carri home badli
wound for hi pain but whether he live or di i cannot tell you
but i heard that your mother the good vrouw botmar is veri sick for
thing have so fallen out late that her mind is troubl and she
fli to drink to comfort it
now when she heard thi sihamba could keep silenc no longer but cri
in a mock voic
get you gone bullhead and take lesson in ly from your friend
of my trade the kaffir witchdoctor for never befor did i hear a man
bear fals wit so clumsili on the third night of hi ill the
husband of swallow wa aliv and do well the heer jan botmar wa not
wound at all and as for the vrouw botmar never in her life did she
drink anyth stronger than coffe for the white man firewat is
poison to her get you gone you silli halfbre who seek to deceiv
the ear of sihamba and i counsel you hold fast to your busi of
theft and murder and give up that of ly in which you will never
succe now be off you stinkcat of the rock lest i send some to
hunt you from your hole who thi time will us the point and not the
shaft of their assegai come swallow let us be go
so thei went keep under cover all the wai to the camp which
inde wa quit close to them and if swart piet made ani answer thei
did not hear it so soon as thei reach it sihamba told sigw what had
pass and he sent men to scour the cliff and the bush behind it but of
van vooren thei could find no trace no not even the spot where he had
been hidden so that sigw came to believ that thei had been fool by
echo and had never heard him at all
but both suzann and sihamba knew that thi wa not so inde thi
hear of the voic of swart piet fill suzann with fear sinc where
the voic wa there wa the man her hate enemi who had given hi
life to her ruin and to that of those she love whatev li he might
have spokenand her heart told her that all hi ill tide were but a
cruel falsehoodthi at least wa true that he had dog her step by
step through the vast wilder and so craftili that none guess hi
presenc what might not be fear from such a foe as thi half mad and
all wick arm with terribl cun and untir patienc if the
umpondwana would not receiv her she must fall into hi hand at onc
and if thei did receiv her she would never dare to leav their kraal
for alwai alwai he would be watch and wait for her littl
wonder then that she felt afraid though just as the sun shine ever
behind the blackest cloud still in her heart shone the sure comfort of
her hope and more than hope that in the end god would give her back
her husband and her to him unharm yet which ever wai she look the
cloud wa veri black and through it she could see no rai of light
when the mist had vanish and the air wa warm with the sun the armi
of sigw march from the pass head for the great mountain as thei
drew near thei saw that the umpondwana were much terrifi at the sight
of them for from all the kraal of which there were mani on the slope
of the mountain thei ran hither and thither like ant about a broken
nest carri their good and children upon their shoulder and
drive herd of cattl in toward the central stronghold note thi
sigw halt and sent herald forward to sai that he came in peac and
not in war and he desir to speak with their chief in less than two
hour the herald return bring with them some of the headmen of
the umpondwana who stare round with frighten ey for thei did not
believ that ani gener would come upon a messag of peac with so mani
regiment when the indaba wa set sigw told them hi name and
tribe of both of which thei had heard and then befor speak of hi
busi ask which of them wa the chief of the umpondwana
ala answer an old man we ar in sore troubl here and wander in
the dark for our chief who wa name koraanu di two dai ago
of the smallpox which ha rage among us for mani month leav no
children behind him for the sick kill them also moreov we ar
suffer from a great drought for as you mai see the veldt is still
brown and there is no green upon the cornfield and if rain doe not
fall soon famin will follow the sick and then it will onli need
that the zulu should follow the famin to make an end of us onc and
for all
it seem that your tribe must have sin deepli and brought down upon
itself the curs of the spirit of it ancestor said sigw when
thei had done their melancholi tale that so mani misfortun should
overtak you tell me now who by right is ruler of the umpondwana
we do not know chief thei answer or rather we cannot tell if
our ruler is aliv or dead and if she is dead then none ar left of the
true blood she wa a small woman but veri pretti and full of wisdom as
a mealiecob with grain of corn for in all thi countri there wa no
doctoress or divin like to her her name wa sihamba ngenyanga the
wandererbymoonlight which name wa given her when she wa littl
becaus of her habit of walk in the dark alon and she wa the onli
child of our late chief inkosikaa a princess of the swazi the
father of that lord koraanu who li dead of the smallpox but when
thi chief di and sihamba wa call upon to rule our tribe quarrel
aros between her and the induna of the tribe for she wa a veri
headstrong woman
we the induna wish her to marri but for her own reason she
would not marri also we wish to swear allegi to chaka but she
wa against it sai that as well might a lamb swear allegi to a
wolf as the umpondwana to the zulu the end of it wa that in a temper
she took a bowl of water and befor us all wash her hand of us and
that same night she vanish awai we know not where though rumour have
reach us that she went south from the dai of her departur howev
thing have gone ill with us the zulu with whom we made peac threaten
us continu her halfbroth koraanu the slaveborn wa not a
good chief and now he is dead of the sick so our heart is heavi
and our head is in the dust and when we saw your impi we thought that
dingaan who now rule over the zulu had sent it to eat us up and to
take the cattl that still remain to us
but you sai that you come in peac so tell us chief what it is you
desir and i trust that it mai be littl for here we have noth to
give unless he ad with mean it be the smallpox although we
ar readi to fight to the death for what is left to us our liberti and
our cattl and chief even a larger armi than your might fail to take
that stronghold which ha but on gate
when the councillor had finish speak sigw call aloud
ladi sihamba i prai you come hither and with you the ladi swallow
your companion
then sihamba who wa prepar for thi event for her hair wa freshli
dress and powder with blue mica wear her littl cape of fur and
the necklac of larg blue bead step from the screen of bush behind
which she had hidden with her and hold her hand came suzann
who cover the ragged of her cloth beneath a splendid kaross
of leopard skin that sigw had given her down which her dark hair
flow almost to her knee a strang pair thei made the tall suzann in
the first bloom of her white beauti which had suffer noth in their
journei and the small quickei delicatefeatur kaffir woman
who ar these ask sigw of the council
the old man look at them and answer
of the white ladi we can sai noth except that she is veri beauti
but unless our ey deceiv us she whom she hold by the hand is
sihamba ngenyanga who wa our chieftai and who left us becaus she
wa angri
she is sihamba and no on els said sigw sihamba come back to rule
you in the hour of need and with her own tongu she shall tell you her
stori and the stori of the white swallow who hold her by the hand
so sihamba began and for an hour or more she spoke to them for when
she chose thi littl woman had the gift of word tell them all
about herself and tell them also the stori of the swallow and of
how she had brought good luck to the armi of sigw and how she wa
destin to bring good luck wherev she made her home at the end of
her speech she said
now my peopl although i have wander from you yet my ey which
ar farse have not been blind to your grief and in the hour of
your need i return to you bring with me the white swallow to sojourn
among you for a while receiv us if you will and be prosper or
reject us and be destroi to us it matter noth it is for you to
choos but if we come we come not as servant but as princ whose
word cannot be question and should you accept us and deal ill with us
in ani wai then your fate is sure ask the chief sigw here whether or
no the flight of the swallow is fortun and whether or no there is
wisdom in the mouth of sihamba who is not asham to serv her
then sigw told them of all the good fortun that had come to him
through suzann and of how wise had been the word of sihamba and told
them moreov that if thei dealt ill by either of them he would return
from hi own countri and stamp them flat
thu it came about that the induna of the umpondwana took back
sihamba to be their chieftai with all power and with her suzann
as her equal in rule and thi their act wa confirm that same dai by
a great council of the tribe so that even suzann mount on the
schimmel rode down the rank of the red kaffir while thei shout
their farewel to her then have part with sigw who almost wept
at her go she pass with sihamba the lad zinti and a great herd
of cattleh tith of the spoilto the mountain umpondwana where all
the tribe were wait to receiv them thei rode up to the flank of
the mountain and through the narrow pass and the red wall of rock
to the tableland upon it top where stood the chief hut and the
cattlekra and here thei found the peopl gather
give us a bless these cri grant to us that rain mai fall
sihamba spoke with suzann and answer
my peopl i have entreat of the white swallow and for your sake she
will prai that rain mai fall er long
now sihamba knew the sign of the water and as it happen rain began
to fall that night in torrent and fell for three dai almost without
ceas wash the sick awai with it so the umpondwana bless
the name of sihamba and the white swallow and these two rule over them
without question life and death hang upon their word
and there a chieftai among savag suzann wa fate to dwell for
more than two long year
chapter xxiv
the mad of ralph kenzi
now my stori goe back to that night at the stead when i suzann botmar
and my husband jan botmar were awaken from our sleep to learn that
our daughter had been carri off by that mad villain piet van vooren
and that her husband ralph lai senseless and wound in the waggon
at the door we carri him in groan in our bitter grief and
despatch messeng to arous all the kaffir on and about the place
whom we could trust and to a parti of boer six men in all who chanc
to have outspan that night upon the border of our farm to shoot
vildebeest and blesbok also we sent anoth messeng mount on a
good hors to the hous of that neighbour who wa be attend by the
doctor from the dorp prai that he would come with all speed to visit
ralph which inde he did for he wa with us by halfpast eight in the
morn
within an hour of the despatch of the messeng the boer rode up from
their waggon and to them as well as to ourselv and to the kaffir
who had gather the driver and voorloop told all thei knew of the
terribl crime that had been done upon the person of ralph kenzi and
hi wife by piet van vooren and hi band also thei repeat all that
zinti had taught them of the road to the secret krantz whither it wa
believ that he had carri off suzann then jan ask those present
if thei would help him in thi troubl and be true men on and
all thei answer ye so by seven in the morn the littl commando
number twentyon gunseight white men and thirteen kaffirsstart
to seek for swart piet hidingplac and to rescu suzann if thei
might
ala i said to jan as he bade me farewel at the best i fear that
you will be too late
we must trust in god he answer heavili
never had we more need of trust husband but i think that god turn
hi face from us becaus of the li we told to the englishmen for now
the punish which you foresaw ha fallen
then wife it were more just that it should have fallen on us who were
guilti and not on those two who ar innoc but still i sai i trust
in godand in sihambah ad by an afterthought for she is brave
and clever and can run upon a path which other cannot even see
then thei went and were awai five dai or it mai have been six thei
start earli on tuesdai and upon the thursdai morn after much
troubl by the help of a nativ whom thei captur thei found swart
piet kraal but of swart piet or suzann or the hidden krantz thei
could see noth inde it wa not until thei had gather togeth
everi man thei could find in the kraal and ti them to tree sai
that thei would shoot them that a woman the wife of on of the men
led them to a rock wall and show the secret of the kloof thei enter
and found the big hut with the bodi of the man whom sihamba had kill
still ly in it and also the knife with which suzann had intend to
destroi herself and which her father knew again
then by degre thei discov the whole stori for the woman point
out to them the man who had guard the entranc to the kloof at whom
zinti had fire and under fear of death thi man confess all he knew
which wa that suzann sihamba and zinti had escap northward upon
their hors follow by swart piet and hi band
accordingli northward thei rode but thei never found ani trace of
them for rain had fallen wash out their spoor and as might be
expect in that vast veldt thei head in the wrong direct so
at last worn out thei return to the stead hope that suzann and
sihamba would have found their wai back there but hope in vain
after that for dai and week thei search and hunt but quit
without result for as it chanc the kaffir who live between the
territori of sigw and the stead rose in arm just then and began to
raid the boer farm steal the cattl includ some of our own so
that it wa imposs to travel in their countri and therefor nobodi
ever reach the town of sigw to make inquiri there
the end of it wa that exhaust by search and sorrow jan sat down at
home and abandon hope nor could the prayer and urg of ralph who
all thi while wa unabl even to mount a hors persuad him to go out
again upon so fruitless an errand
no son he answer long befor thi the girl is either dead or
she is safe far awai and in either event it is useless to look for her
about here sinc van vooren kraal is watch and we know that she is
not in it to which ralph would answer
she is not dead i know that she is not dead and we understood that
he spoke of the vision which had come to him for i had told the tale of
it to jan but in hi heart jan put no faith in the vision and believ
that suzann our belov child had been dead for mani dai for he wa
certain that she would die rather than fall again into the hand of van
vooren as i wa also and inde of thi we were glad to be sure
to ralph howev that we might comfort him in hi sorrow which wa
even more terribl than our own we made pretenc that we believ
suzann to be hide far awai but unabl to commun with us as in
fact she wa
oh our live were sad dure those bitter month ye the light
had gone out of our live and often we wish the three of us that
alreadi we were rest in the grave as he recov from hi wound
and the strength of hi bodi came back to him a kind of gentl
mad took hold of ralph which it wrung our heart to see for hour
sometim for dai inde he would sit about the place brood and
sai no word at other time he would mount hi hors and ride awai
none knew whither perhap not to return that night or the next or the
next till we were terrifi by the thought that he too might never
come back again it wa useless to be angri with him for he would onli
answer with a littl smile
you forget i must be seek my wife who is wait for me upon the
mountain of the hand and then we learn that he had ridden to a far
off hill to examin it or to see some travel or nativ and ask of
them if thei knew or had heard of such a mountain with ridg upon it
eastern slope fashion like the thumb and finger of a man hand
inde in all that countrysid among both boer and nativ ralph
won the bynam of the man of the mountain becaus he rare spoke
of aught els but still folk black and white knew the reason of hi
mad and bore with him piti hi grief
it wa i rememb in the season after suzann had vanish that the
kaffir becam so angri and danger for my part i believ that those
in our neighbourhood were stir up by the emissari of swart piet
for though he had gone none knew where hi tool and agent remain
behind him howev thi mai have been all over the countri the black
men began to raid the stock and in our case thei end by attack the
stead also a great number of them arm with gun fortun we had a
littl warn and thei were veri sad kaffir that went awai next dai
moreov forti of them never went awai at all just at dawn when thei
had been besieg the hous for some hour shout bang off their
gun and try to fire the roof by mean of assegai with tuft of
blaze grass ti on to them jan ralph and about twenti of our
peopl crept down under cover of the orchard wall and salli out upon
them
almighti how those men fought especi jan and ralph it wa a
pleasur to see them for i watch the whole thing from the stoep
though i admit that i wa anxiou sinc it wa evid that neither of
them seem to care whether he live or di howev as it turn out
it wa not thei who di but the kaffir who went off with some few
cattl and afterward left us in peac
and now come the strang part of the affair though i scarc like to
tell it lest after all these year it should not be believ someon
connect with the london missionari societi report us to the
govern at the cape for shoot poor innoc black men and it wa
threaten that jan and ralph would be put upon their trial for murder
by the british govern inde i believ that thi would have been
done had not we and other of our neighbourhood let it be clearli known
that befor thei were drag to the common gaol there would be kill
not onli of black but of white men
our case wa onli on of mani sinc in those time there wa no
secur for us boersw were rob we were slander we were
desert our good were taken and we were not compens the kaffir
stole our herd and if we resist them we were tri as murder our
slave were freed and we were cheat of their valu and the word of a
black man wa accept befor our solemn oath upon the bibl
no wonder that we grew tire of it and trek seek to shake the
dust of british rule from off our feet and to find a new home
for ourselv out of the reach of the hand of the accurs british
govern oh i know that there ar two side to the stori and i
daresai that the british govern meant well but at the least it wa
a fool and it alwai will be a fool with it secretari of state who
know noth sit far awai there in london and it governor whose
onli busi is to pleas the secretari of state that when the
countri thei ar sent to rule grow sick of them thei mai win anoth
post with larger pai
well thi tale is of peopl and not of polit so i will sai no more
of the caus that brought about the great trek of the boer from the
old coloni and sent them forth into the wilder there to make war
with the savag man and found new countri for themselv i know those
caus for jan and ralph and i were of the number of the voortrekk
still had it not been for the loss of suzann i do not think that we
should have trek for we love the home we had made upon the face of
the wild veldt
but now that she wa gone it wa no home for us everi room of the
hous everi tree in the garden everi ox and hors and sheep remind
us of her ye even the distant roar of the ocean and the sigh
of the wind among the grass seem to speak of her these were the
flower she love that wa the stone she sat on yonder wa the path
which dai by dai she trod the veri air wa thick with memori of her
and the tone of her lost voic seem to linger in the echo of the
hill at night
it wa upon the anniversari of the marriag of ralph and suzann ye
on the veri dai year of her take by piet van vooren that we made up
our mind to go we had dine and ralph sat quit silent hi head bow
a littl upon hi breast as wa hi custom while jan spoke loudli of
the wrong of the boer at the hand of the british govern i do
not think that he wa much troubl with those wrong just then but he
talk becaus he wish to interest ralph and turn hi mind from sad
thought
what think you of it son said jan at length for it is hard work
talk all by oneself even when on ha the british govern to
abus which wa the onli subject that made jan a wordi man
i father answer ralph with a start which show me that hi mind
wa far awai i do not quit know what i think i should like to hear
what the english govern sai about the matter for i think that thei
mean to be fair onli thei do not understand the want and troubl of
us boer who live so far awai also without doubt the missionari mean
well but thei believ that a black man ha a bigger soul than a white
man wherea we who know the black man see that there is a differ
allemacht son said jan look at him out of the corner of hi
ey cannot you show some spirit i hope that be an englishman
you would have stood up for your own peopl and then we might have
quarrel about it which would have done us both good but you onli
sit and talk like a magistr in hi chair look at both side of
the case at onc which is an evil habit for men who have to make their
wai in the world well i tell you that if you had seen the curs
british govern hang your father and uncl at slagter nek and not
satisfi with that hang them a second time when the rope broke just
becaus thei tri to shoot a few hottentot policemen you would not
think much of it fair and as for the missionari of the london
societi well i should like to hang them as would be right and
proper see that thei blacken the name of honest boer
ralph onli smile at thi onslaught for he wa not to be stir from
hi lethargi by talk about slagter nek and the missionari for a
while there wa silenc which present wa broken by jan roar at me
in a loud voic as though i were deaf
vrouw let on trek and to give weight to hi word he brought
hi great fist down with a bang upon the tabl knock off a plate and
break it
i stoop to pick up the piec rate him for hi careless as i
gather them for i wish to have time to think although for a long
while i had expect thi when i had found them all i place them upon
the tabl sai
thei cannot be mend andheart or plateswhat cannot be mend had
best be hidden awai heart and plate ar brittl thing but the last
can be bought in iron as i wish the first could be also ye husband
we will trek if you desir it
what sai you son ask jan
ralph answer hi question by anoth in which direct will the
emigr trek
north i believ to the vaal river
then father i sai let us go he repli with more spirit than he had
shown for a long while for i have search and inquir to the south
and the east and the west and in them i can hear of no mountain that
ha ridg upon it eastern slope shape like the thumb and finger of
a man hand with a stream of water issu from between the thumb and
first finger
now onc more we were silent for we saw that hi mad had again
taken hold of ralph mind and that wa a sad silenc
chapter xxv
the great trek
on the morrow we began to make readi and a month later we trek from
our much love home jan tri to sell the farm which wa a veri good
on of over six thousand morgen or twelv thousand english acr well
water and have on it a dwell hous built of stone with larg
kraal and outbuild an orchard of fruittre and twenti morgen
of crop land that could be irrig in the dry season well fenc in
with wall built of loos stone but no on would make a bid for it
for there were few english about and most of the farmer were trek
so at last he part with it to a cowardli fellow a boer by birth but
as i believ a spy of the british govern who gave him fifti pound
and an old waggon in exchang for the place and everyth upon it
except the stock which we took with us
some year ago i heard that thi man grandson sold that same farm for
twenti thousand pound in cash and that now it is a place where thei
breed hors angora goat and ostrich in great number it make me
mad to think that the descend of that low spy should have profit
so larg out of the land which wa our but so it often chanc that
those whose heart ar small and mean reap the reward of the courag and
misfortun of braver men nor should we grumbl inde see that the
lord ha bless us greatli in land and good
ah it wa a sad home leav the dai befor we trek ralph rode
to visit hi mother grave for the last time and then follow the
track which he had taken as a child he went to the kloof where suzann
had found him and sat down upon that stone on which as a child he had
knelt in prayer and where in after year he and hi lost wife had told
their love jan accompani him upon thi dismal journei for to speak
truth we did not like to leav him more alon than we could help sinc
hi manner remain strang and when he set out on hi solitari ride
we could not be certain that we should ever see him come back again
next morn we trek awai and my ey were so full of tear as i sat
beneath the tent of the first waggon that the familiar landscap and the
home where i live for twenti year and more were blot from my sight
but i could still hear the longnos spy who had bought the farm and
who as wait to enter into possess talk to jan
goodby heer botmar he said and good fortun to you upon your
journei for my part i cannot understand you emigr the english
govern is an accurs govern no doubt still i would not sell
a farm and a hous like thi for fifti pound and an old waggon in order
to wander in the wilder to escap from it there to be eaten by
lion or murder by kaffir still goodby and good luck to you and
i hope that you ar as content with your bargain as i am with mine
the lord will be our guid as he wa to the israelit of old
answer jan in a somewhat troubl voic
ye ye thei all sai that heer botmar and i trust that thei ar
right for you will need noth less than a cloud by dai and a pillar
of fire in the dark to protect you from all the danger in your
path also i hope that the host of pharaoh in the shape of english
soldier will not fetch you back befor you cross the border for then
when you have sold your birthright in egypt and ar cut off from the
promis land your lot will be hard heer botmar
the lord will guid and protect us repeat jan and gave the word to
trek
in my heart at the time i wa inclin to agre with that cheat
sneer word and yet jan wa right and not i for of the truth the
lord did guid and protect us ha anyth more wonder happen in
the world than thi journei of a few farmer cumber with women and
children and arm onli with oldfashion muzzleload gun into a
vast unknown land peopl by savag and wild beast yet look what
thei did thei conquer moselikats thei broke the strength of dingaan
and all hi zulu impi thei peopl the free state the transvaal and
natal that wa the work of those few farmer and i sai that of their
own strength thei could never have done it the strength wa given to
them from abov the sword of god wa in their hand and he guid that
hand and bless it
our first outspan wa at the spot where van vooren had tri to murder
ralph and carri off suzann upon her weddingdai we did not stop
there long for the place wa bad for ralph who sat upon the box of the
waggon stare moodili at some blacken stone which as on of the
driver told meth same man who accompani them upon their wed
journeyhad been brought from the kloof and us by suzann to set the
kettl on when thei took their meal togeth led by thi same driver
i walk to the edg of the clifffor i had never visit the place
beforeand look at the deep seapool forti feet below me into which
swart piet had thrown ralph after he had shot him also i went down to
the edg of the pool and climb up again by the path along which zinti
and sihamba had stagger with hi senseless bodi afterward i return
to the waggon with a heart full of thank and wonder that he
should still be aliv among us todai although ala there wa much for
which i could not feel thank at least not then
now it is of littl us that i should set down the histori of thi
trek of our dai by dai for if i did my stori would have no end it
is enough to tell that in compani with other emigr we cross the
orang river head for thaba nchu which had been the chief town
of maroko befor moselikats drove him out of the marico countri here
sever band of emigr were to meet and here thei did meet but not
until a year or more had pass sinc we left the coloni and wander
out into the veldt
ah i tell you my child the veldt in those dai wa differ inde
from what it is now the land itself remain the same except where white
men have built town upon it but all els is chang then it wa black
with game when the grass wa green ye at time i have seen it so
black for mile that we could scarc see the grass there were
all sort of them springbuck in myriad blesbok and quagga and
wildebeest in thousand sabl antelop sassabi and hartebeest in
herd eland giraff and koodoo in troop while the forest were
full of eleph and the stream of seacow thei ar all gone now the
beauti wild creatur the gun of the white men have kill them
out or driven them awai and i suppos that it is as well that thei ar
gone for while the game is in such plenti the men will not work still
i for on am sorri to lose the sight of them and had it not been for
their number we boer should never have last through that long trek
for often and often we live upon buck flesh and littl els for week
togeth
at thaba nchu we camp wait for other band of emigr but
after four or five month some of our number grew so impati that thei
start off by themselv among these were the compani under the heer
triegaart and the heer rensenburg who wish us to accompani him but
jan would not i do not know why it wa as well for the knobnos
kaffir kill him and everybodi with him triegaart who had separ
from him trek to delagoa bai and reach it where nearli all hi
peopl di of fever
after that we move northward in detach instead of keep
togeth as we should have done with the result that sever of our
parti were fallen upon and murder by the warrior of moselikats
our line of march wa between where bloemfontein and winburg now stand
in the orang free state and it wa south of the vaal not far from the
rhenost river that moselikats attack us
i cannot tell the tale of all thi wai i can onli tell of what i saw
myself we were of the parti under the leadership of carl cellier
afterward an elder of the church at kronnstadt cellier went on a
commiss to zoutpansberg to spy out the land and it wa while he wa
awai that so mani famili were cut off by moselikats the remaind
of them with such of their women and children as were left aliv
retreat to our laager then cellier return from hi commiss
and we retir to a place call vechtkop near the rhenost river
altogeth we number not more than fifti or sixti soul includ
women and children
here we heard that moselikats wa advanc to make an end of us so
we made our laager as strong as we could lash the disselboom of each
waggon beneath the framework of that befor it and fill the space
beneath and between with the crown and bough of sharpthorn mimosa
tree which we ti to the trek tow and brake chain so that thei
could not be torn awai also in the middl of the laager we made an
inner defenc of seven waggon in which were place the women and
children with the spare food and gunpowd but the cattl we were
oblig to leav outsid earli on the morn when we had finish the
laager we heard that the impi of moselikats wa close to us and the
men to the number of over thirti rode out to look for it leav but a
few to defend the camp
about an hour ride awai thei found the kaffir thousand of them and
a hottentot who could speak their tongu wa instruct to call to them
and ask them why thei attack us by wai of answer thei shout out the
name of their chief and began to charg whereupon our men dismount
from their hors and open fire upon them mount again befor thei
could come near so the fight went on until the laager wa reach and
mani kaffir were kill without ani loss to the boer for luckili in
those dai the nativ had no firearm
i rememb that we women were mould bullet when the men rode in
and veri thank we were to find that not on of them wa even wound
while thei at someth we wash out their gun and at interv near
the place where each man must stand behind the waggon we pile littl
heap of powder and bullet upon buckskin and piec of canva laid on
the ground also we did all we could to strengthen our defenc still
further by bind oxhid over the waggon wheel and thrust in more
thorn between them
then as the enemi wa still prepar to attack us the heer cellier
call us togeth and there in the laager while all knelt around him
even to the smallest child he put up a prayer to god ask that we
might be forgiven our sin and that he would look upon us and protect
us in our great need
it wa a strang sight there we all knelt in the quiet sunshin while
he prai in an earnest voic and we follow hi word with our
heart everi on of us men and women hold gun or ax in our
hand never had human be more need for prayer for through the
crack between the waggon we could see moselikats zulu six or
seven thousand of them form themselv into three bodi to rush
upon us and murder us and that wa a dread sight for fifti or sixti
peopl of whom some were littl children
when we had finish prai husband and wive and parent and
children kiss each other and then the littl on and some of the
women who were sick or ag were put behind the seven waggon in the
centr of the laager round which were ti the hors while the rest
of us went to our station men and women togeth i stood behind jan
and ralph who fought side by side and assist by a girl of fourteen
year of ag load their spare gun now there wa a great silenc in
the camp and suddenli in the silenc jan who wa look through hi
loophol whisper
allemacht here thei come
and come thei did with a rush and a roar from three side at onc
while men drew in their breath and set their face for the struggl
still no on fire for the order wa that we were to save our powder
until cellier let off hi gun alreadi the savag were within thirti
pace of us a countless mass of men pack like sheep in a kraal their
fierc ey shew white as ivori in the sunlight their cruel spear
quiver in their hand when the signal wa given and everi gun some
load with slug and some with bullet wa discharg pointblank into
the thick of them
over thei roll by dozen but that did not stop the rest who in
spite of our pitiless fire rush up to the waggon and grip them
with their hand strive to drag them apart till the whole line of
them rock and surg and creak like boat upon the sea while
the air grew thick with smoke rise straight up toward the sky and
through the smoke assegai flash as thick as rain
but although some of the heavi laden waggon were drag a foot or
more outward thei held togeth and the storm of spear fly over
our head did littl harm heaven what a fight wa that the fight of
fifti against six thousand
not more than seven feet of space divid us from that shriek sea of
foe into which we pour bullet at hazard for there wa no need to
aim as fast as the gun could be load suddenli i heard the girl call
out
kek tant da is een swartzel look aunt there is a black man
i look and just at my side i saw a great savag who had forc hi
wai through the thorn and crawl beneath the waggon into the laager
the gun in my hand wa empti but by me lai an ax which i snatch up
and as he rose to hi knee i struck him with all my strength upon the
neck and kill him at a blow ye my child that wa the kind of work
to which we wive of the voortrekk had to put a needl
jan had just fire hi gun and see the man he sprang to help me
whereon three more kaffir follow on the dead soldier path crawl
out from under the waggon two of them gain their feet and ran at him
lift their assegai i thought that all wa lost for on hole in our
defenc wa like a pin prick to a bladder but with a shout jan drop
the empti gun and rush to meet them he caught them by the throat the
two of them on in each of hi great hand and befor thei could spear
him dash their head togeth with such desper strength that thei
fell down and never stir again thi wa alwai thought someth of
a feat for as everybodi know the skull of kaffir ar thick
by thi time the girl had hand ralph hi second gun load and with
it he shot the third kaffir then he also did a brave thing for see
that more zulu were begin to creep through the hole he snatch
the assegai from a dead man hand and stop the gap with hi own
bodi ly flat upon hi stomach and thrust at their head with the
spear soon we drag him out with onli on slight wound push the
bodi of the kaffir into hi place and over them spare branch of
thorn so that the breach wa made good
thi wa the turn point of the fight for though after it on other
kaffir manag to get into the laager where he wa cut down and two
boer nichola potgiet and pieter botha were kill by assegai
thrown from without from that moment the attack began to slacken in
thirti minut from the time that cellier had fire the first shot
moselikats gener whose name wa kalipi had given the order to
retir and hi host drew off sullenli for we had beaten them
thirti minut onli thirti minutesth shadow had shift but a few
inch on the grass and yet now that it wa done with it seem like
half a lifetim pant and begrim with smoke and powder we stood
look at each other and around us the tent of the waggon were
rip to piec in our own i count more than sixti spear cut
and the trampl turf insid the laager wa like the back of an angri
porcupin for from it we gather nearli fourteen hundr heavi
assegai for the rest the two men lai dead where thei had fallen
their face turn toward the sky each of them pierc through by a
spear and out of our littl number twelv other were wound though
none of them di of their wound not a woman or a child wa touch
outsid the laager there wa a sight to see for there on the red
grass some ly singli and some in heap were over four hundr zulu
soldier most of them dead and how mani wound thei carri awai with
them i cannot tell
now we saw that the kaffir were collect our cattl and about twenti
men under potgiet saddl up and rode out to try and recaptur them
sinc without oxen to draw the waggon we were helpless till sunset
thei follow them kill mani but be so few thei could not
recaptur the cattl and in the end were oblig to return empti
hand ralph went with hi parti and becaus of an act of merci which
he did then it came about in the end that suzann wa found and mani
live were save so plenteous do our good deed bear fruit even in
thi world
ye you mai have thought that thi tale of the battl of vetchkop wa
onli put in here becaus it is on of the great experi of an old
woman life but it is not so it ha all to do with the stori of ralph
and of my daughter suzann
chapter xxvi
how gaasha brought good luck
when ralph return from pursu the zulu as he drew near to the
laager he linger a littl behind the other for he wa veri weari of
all thi work of kill also the fleshwound that he had got from
the kaffir spear have stiffen pain him when hi hors canter
there wa no more danger now for the savag were gone leav their
path mark by the corps of those who had been shot down by the boer
or of men who had limp awai wound either to die upon the road or to
be kill by their comrad becaus their case wa hopeless follow
thi black trail of death backward ralph rode on and when he wa
within a hundr yard of the waggon halt hi hors to studi the
scene he thought that he would never see such anoth although in
fact that at the blood river when we conquer the zulu king dingaan
wa even more strang and terribl
the last crimson rai of the set sun were flood the plain with
light bloodr thei shone upon the speartorn canva of the waggon
and upon the stain and trampl veldt even the bodi of the kaffir
look red as thei lai in everi shape and attitud some as though thei
slept some with outstretch arm and spear grip tight some with
open mouth as thei had di shout their waycri ralph look at
them and wa thank that it wa not we white peopl who lai thu
as it might well have been then just as he wa turn toward the
laager he thought that he saw someth move in a tussock of thick
grass and rode toward it behind the tussock lai the bodi of a young
kaffir not an uncommon sight just there but ralph wa so sure that he
had seen it move that stir by an idl curios he dismount from
hi hors to examin it thi he did carefulli but the onli hurt that
he could see wa a flesh wound caus by a slug upon the foot not
seriou in ani wai but such as might veri well prevent a man from
run
thi fellow is sham dead he thought to himself and lift hi
gun for in those time we could not afford to nurs sick kaffir
then of a sudden the young man who had seem to be a corps rose to
hi knee and clasp hi hand began to beg for merci instead
of shoot him at onc as most boer would have done ralph who
wa tenderheart hesit and listen while the kaffir a
pleasantfac lad and young besought him for hi life
why should i spare you ask ralph who understood hi talk well
see that like all the rest of these you set upon my peopl to
murder them
nai chief answer the young man it is not so i am no zulu i
belong to anoth tribe and wa but a slave and a carrier in the armi
of kalipi for i wa taken prison and forc to carri mat and food
and water and he point to a bundl and some gourd that lai besid
him
it mai be so answer ralph but the dog share hi master fate
chief plead the man spare me although it prevent me from
run awai with the other my wound is veri slight and will be heal
in a dai or two and then i will serv you as your slave and be faith
to you all my life spare me and i shall bring you good luck
i need that enough said ralph and i am sure that you ar no zulu
for a zulu would not stoop to beg for hi life thu and he stood
think
while he thought jan who had seen him from the laager came up behind
what ar you do son he ask in an angri voic talk to thi
black devil here alon among the dead stand asid and let me settl him
if you have not the heart and he lift hi gun
no father said ralph push it asid thi man is not a zulu he
is but a slavecarri and he ha prai me to spare hi life swear
that he will serv me faithfulli also he sai that he bring good
luck
certainli he brought good luck to these answer jan point to the
scatter dead with hi hand and laugh grimli allemacht son
you must be mad to plai the fool thu for doubtless the sneak
villain will murder you the first time your back is turn come stand
asid and i will finish it
now the young man whose name wa gaasha see that he wa about to be
shot threw himself upon the ground and clasp ralph round the knee
implor for merci
save me baa he prai save me and you will alwai be glad of it
for i tell you i bring you good luck i tell you i bring you good luck
father said ralph set hi mouth if you kill thi kaffir it
will be a caus of quarrel between us and we never quarrel yet
quarrel or no quarrel he shall die said jan in a rage for he
thought it the strangest folli that ralph should wish to spare a black
man
at that moment howev someth seem to strike hi mind for hi
face grew puzzl and he look about him almost anxious
where have i seen it befor he said as though he were speak to
himself the veldt all red with blood and sunset the laager behind
and the kaffir with the wound foot hold ralph by the knee
allemacht i know it wa that dai in the sitkamm at the stead
yonder when the littl doctoress sihamba made me look into her ey
ye ye i have seen it all in the ey of sihamba well let the lad
live for without a doubt sihamba did not show me thi pictur that
should be for noth moreov although i am stupid as your mother
sai i have learn that there ar mani thing in the world which we
cannot understand but which plai a part in our live nevertheless
sit room
so the lad gaasha wa brought to the laager and upon the prayer of jan
and ralph the command gave him hi life order howev that he
should sleep outsid the waggon
well i said when i heard the tale on thing is that you will never
see him again for he will be off dure the night back to hi friend
the zulu but i wa wrong for next morn there wa gaasha and
there he remain even after hi foot wa quit well make the best
kaffir servant that ever i had to do with
after that dai we saw no more of the zulu at vetchkop although later
with the help of other boer we attack them twice kill more than
four thousand of them and captur six thousand head of cattl so
that thei fled north for good and all and found the nation of the
matabel far awai
but oh our fate wa hard there at vetchkop never have i known wors
dai the zulu had taken awai all our cattl so that we could not
even shift the waggon from the scene of the fight but must camp there
amidst the vultur and the moulder skeleton for the dead were
so mani that it wa imposs to buri them all we sent messeng to
other parti of boer for help and while thei were gone we starv
for there wa no food to eat and game wa veri scarc ye it wa
a piteou sight to see the children cry for food and gnaw old bit of
leather or strip of hide cut from kaffir shield to stai the crave
of their stomach some of them di of that hunger and i grew so thin
that when i chanc to see myself in a pool of water where i went to
wash i start back frighten
at length when we were all nearli dead some oxen came and with them we
drag a few of the waggon to moroko where an english clergyman
and hi wife take piti on us gave us corn for which reason i have
alwai held that among the british the clergymen must be a great deal
better than the rest of that proud and worthless race for it is true
that we judg of peopl as thei deal by us ye and i will go so far
as to sai that i do not believ that the reverend mr owen the english
missionari at the kraal of the zulu king dingaan did in truth advis
him to massacr retief and hi seventi boer as wa gener report
among my countrymen
well after moselikats zulu were final defeat the question aros
whether we should proce to zoutpansberg and settl there or follow
our brethren who in larg number had alreadi cross the quathlamba
mountain into natal under the leadership of retief in the end we
decid for natal becaus it wa nearer the sea for in those dai we
never dream that the treacher british govern would steal that
land also so trek slowli we head for van reenen pass our
parti then number thirti waggon and about sixti white peopl
it wa when we were about four dai trek or sixti mile from the
pass that on even as we sat eat our food jan ralph and ii
rememb it wa the fri steak of an eland that ralph had shotth
lad gaasha who had now serv us for some six month came up to the
fire and have salut ralph squat down befor him kaffir fashion
sai that he had a favour to ask
speak on said ralph what is it
baa repli gaasha it is thi i want a week or ten dai leav of
absenc to visit my peopl
you mean that you want to desert i put in

chapter xxvii
swart piet set a snare
it wa a strang life that suzann led among the umpondwana dure the
two year or more that togeth with sihamba she rule over them as
chieftai upon the top of the mountain wa a space of grass land
measur about five hundr morgen or a thousand acr in extent
where were place the chief hut and those of the head men and
soldier surround a larg cattl kraal which howev wa onli
us in time of danger the rest of the peopl dwelt upon the slope of
the mountain and even on the rich plain at the foot of it but if need
were thei could all retreat to the tableland upon it crest here thei
might have defi attack for ever for beneath the cattl kraal grain
wa store in pit onli there wa but on spring which in dry season
wa apt to fail therefor it wa that the umpondwana had built stone
schanz or fortif about the mouth of the river which gush
from the mountain between the thumb and finger like ridg on the
eastern slope although it lai below their impregn wall of rock
see that to thi river thei must look for their main suppli of water
the tabletop of the hill which could onli be approach by on path
that wound upward through a ravin cut by water be swept by everi
wind of heaven and so high in the air wa veri cold and nake inde
in the winter season rain fell there twice or thrice a week and there
were mani dai when it wa wrapt in a dens white mist still dure
the two year and more that she dwelt with the umpondwana suzann
scarc left thi plain not becaus she did not desir to do so but
becaus she did not dare for word wa brought that the foot and even
the slope of the mountain were patrol by men in the emploi of swart
piet moreov soon it becam clear that he had knowledg of all
her movement doubtless from spi in hi pai who dwelt among the
umpondwana themselv dure the first few month of her sojourn on the
mountain it is true that now and again suzann rode out on the veldt
mount on the schimmel but thi pastim she wa forc to abandon
becaus on dai swart piet and hi men saw her and gave chase so that
she wa onli save from him by the fleet of the great hors
after thi both she and the schimmel stai upon the tableland where
daili thei took exercis togeth gallop round a prepar path which
wa laid about the fenc of the cattl kraal and thu kept themselv
in good health
swart piet had kaffir blood in hi vein as i have said and from
boyhood it had been hi custom to live two live on as a white man
with white men and on as a kaffir with kaffir about three mile
distant from the umpondwana mountain wa a strong koppi with fertil
vallei to the back of it and here be rich and have a great name
as a white man he found it no troubl to establish himself as a nativ
chief for refuge of all sort gather themselv about him so
that within a year he rule over a littl tribe of about a hundr men
togeth with women
with these men van vooren began to harass the umpondwana cut off
their cattl if thei strai and from time to time kill or enslav
small parti of them whom he caught wander on the plain out of
reach of help from the mountain whenev he captur such a parti
he would spare on of them send him back with a messag to the
umpondwana thei were all to on effect name that if the tribe would
deliv over to him the ladi swallow who dwelt among them he would ceas
from troubl it but if thi were not done then he would wage war
on it dai and night until in thi wai or in that he compass it
destruct
to these messag sihamba would repli as occas offer that if he
want anyth from the umpondwana he had better come and take it
so thing went on for a long while swart piet men did them no great
harm inde but thei harass them continu until the peopl of
the umpondwana began to murmur for thei could scarc stir beyond the
slope of the mountain without be set upon happili for them these
slope were wide for otherwis thei could not have found pasturag for
their cattl or land upon which to grow their corn so close a watch wa
kept upon them inde that thei could neither travel to visit other
tribe nor could these come to them and thu it came about that
suzann wa as utterli cut off from the rest of the world as though she
had been dead she had but on hope to keep her heart aliv and it wa
that ralph and jan would learn of her fate through nativ rumour and be
abl to find her out still as she knew that thi could not be count
on she tri to let us have tide of her for when she had been onli
a week on the mountain umpondwana she despatch zinti and two men to
bear him compani with order to travel back over all the hundr of
mile of veldt to the faroff stead in the transkei
as she had neither pen nor ink nor anyth with which she could write
suzann wa oblig to trust a long messag to zinti memori make
him repeat it to her until she wa sure that he had it by heart in thi
messag she told all that had befallen her and prai us to take zinti
for a guid and to come to her rescu sinc she did not dare to set
foot outsid the wall of rock for fear that she should be captur by
van vooren who watch for her continu
zinti be brave and faith start upon hi errand though it wa
on from which mani would have shrunk but as illluck would have it
on night when thei were camp near the kraal of a small basuto tribe
hi companion becom hungri stole a goat and kill it zinti at of
the goat for thei told him that thei had bought it for some bead and
while thei were still eat the basuto came upon them and caught them
redhand next dai thei were tri by the councillor of the tribe and
condemn to die as thiev but the chief who want servant spare
their live and set them to labour in hi garden where thei were
watch dai and night
zinti wa a prison among these basuto for nearli a year but at
length he made hi escap leav hi two companion behind for thei
were afraid lest if thei ran awai with him thei should be recaptur and
kill as soon as he wa free zinti continu hi journei for he wa
a man not easili turn from hi purpos nor becaus it wa now over a
year old did he ceas from hi attempt to deliv the messag that had
been set in hi mouth
well after mani danger footsor and wornout with travel at
length he reach the stead to find that we had all gone none knew
whither and that the longnos cheat to whom we had sold the farm
rule in our place zinti sought out some kaffir who live upon the
land and abod with them awhil till he wa rest and strong again
then onc more he turn hi face northward toward the mountain
umpondwana for though he greatli fear the journei he knew that the
heart of suzann would be sick for new war rage in the countri that
he must pass and food wa scarc still at length he won through
although at the last he wa nearli captur by black piet thiev and
on year and nine month after he had left it a worn and weari figur
he limp up the red rock path of umpondwana
suzann had been watch for him it seem strang to sai it but after
six month had gone by which time at the best must be given to hi
journei she watch for him everi dai on the top of the highest and
most precipit cliff of the mountain fortress of umpondwana wa a
littl knoll of rock curious hollow out to the shape of a chair
difficult to gain and dizzi to sit in for beneath it wa a sheer fall
of five hundr feet which chairrock command the plain southward
and the pass where van vooren had spoken to suzann from hi
hidingplac among the stone by thi pass and across thi plain help
must reach her if it came at all or so she thought therefor in that
eagl eyri of a seat suzann sat dai by dai watch ever for those
who did not come a strang sight she must have been for now long ago
such garment as she had were worn to rag so that she wa forc to
cloth herself in beauti skin fashion to her fanci and to go
sandalfoot her love rippl hair hang about her
at length on dai from her lone point of outlook she saw a solitari
man limp across the plain a mere black speck drag itself forward
like a wound fly upon a wall descend from her seat she sought out
sihamba
swallow said the littl woman there is tide in your ey what
is it
zinti return she answer i have seen him from far awai
now sihamba smile for she thought zinti lost also she did not believ
it possibl that sihamba could have recogn him from such a distanc
still befor two hour were over zinti came gaunt and footsor but
healthi and unharm and sit down befor suzann in her privat
enclosur began at the veri begin of hi long stori after the
nativ fashion tell of those thing which had befallen him upon the
dai when he left the mountain nearli two year befor
your new your new said suzann
ladi i am tell it he answer
fool exclaim sihamba sai now did you find the baa kenzi and
the baa botmar
no inde he repli for thei were gone
gone where were thei aliv and well
ye ye thei were aliv and well but all the boer in those part
have trek and thei trek also believ the ladi swallow to be
dead
thi is a bitter cup to drink murmur suzann yet there is some
sweet in it for at least my husband live
then zinti set out all hi stori and suzann listen to it in silenc
prais him much and thank him when he had done but after that
dai her heart fail her and she seem to give up hope ralph had
vanish and we her parent had vanish and she wa left alon a
prison among a littl kaffir tribe at the foot of whose stronghold
her bitter enemi wait to destroi her never wa white woman in a
more dread or more solitari state and had it not been for sihamba
tender friendship she felt that she must have di
now also swart piet grew bolder appear even on the slope of the
mountain where hi men harri and stole he did more than thi even
for on morn just befor dawn he attack the pass lead to the
stronghold so secretli and with such skill that hi forc wa halfwai
up it befor the sentri discov them then thei were seen and the
warhorn blew and there follow a great fight inde had it not
been for a lucki chanc it is doubt how that fight would have end
for hi onslaught wa fierc and the umpondwana who at the best were
not the bravest of warrior were taken by surpris
it will be rememb that zinti had brought ralph gun with him when
first thei fled north and thi gun he still had togeth with a littl
powder and ball for fear lest it should be stolen from him he had
not taken it on hi great journei to the transkei and back now hear
the tumult he ran out with it and fire point blank at the stormer
who were push their wai up the narrow path drive the umpondwana
befor them the roar wa load with slug which scatter kill
three men moreov by good fortun on of the slug struck van vooren
himself through the fleshi part of the thigh caus him to fall
whereon think him mortal wound in spite of hi curs and
command hi follow lost heart and fled bear him with them
sihamba call upon her peopl to follow but thei would not for thei
fear to meet swart piet in the open
in truth thei began to weari of thi constant war which wa brought
upon them through no fault or quarrel of their own and to ask where
wa that good luck which the white swallow had promis them had it
not been that thei love suzann for her beauti and her gentl wai and
that sihamba by her clever and good rule had master their mind
there is littl doubt inde but that thei would have ask suzann to
depart from among them
on the dai follow the attack sihamba learn that swart piet lai
veri sick have lost much blood and sought to persuad her peopl
to attack him in turn and make an end of him and hi robber but
thei would not and so the council broke up but not befor sihamba had
spoken bitter word tell them that thei were coward and would meet
the end of coward whereat thei went awai sullenli afterward thei
learn through their spi that van vooren had gone to zululand to
visit the king dingaan which sihamba thought evil tide for she
scent fresh danger in thi journei and not without reason but to
suzann she said noth
two more month went by peacefulli when on morn a herd who wa
tend the cattl that belong to suzann and sihamba sought audienc
of the chieftai
what is it ask sihamba for she saw by the man face that
someth strang had happen
thi ladi he answer when i went down to the kloof at dawn where
your cattl and those of the ladi swallow ar kraal i found among
them strang oxen to the number of more than a hundr thei ar
beauti oxen such as i have never seen for everi on of them is pure
whitewhit from the muzzl to the tail and i cannot understand how
thei came among your cattl for the mouth of the kraal wa close as
usual last night moreov i found it close thi morn
when sihamba heard thi she turn cold to the heart for she knew
well that these spotless white cattl must come from the royal herd of
dingaan king of the zulu sinc none other were known like them in all
the land also she wa sure that swart piet had stolen them and place
them among her cattl so as to bring down upon her and her tribe the
terribl wrath of dingaan for she rememb that thi mingl of
cattl wa a trick which he had plai befor but to the herd she said
onli that doubtless thei were cattl which had strai and that she
would make enquiri as to their owner then she dismiss him bid
him to keep a better watch in futur
scarc had he gone when anoth man appear sai that he had met a
kaffir from beyond the mountain who told him that a parti of white men
with women and children had cross the quathlamba rang by what is now
known as bezuidenhout pass and were camp near the tugela river
thi wa strang new to sihamba who had heard noth of the
whereabout of the trek boer so strang that she would not speak of
it to suzann fear lest it should fill her with fals hope but she
sent for zinti and bade him cross the quathlamba by a littleus pass
that wa known to her near the place where the tugela take it rise
and which todai is call mont aux sourc and follow the river
down to find out whether or no it wa true that white men were encamp
upon it bank when he had done thi he wa to return as swiftli as
possibl with whatev inform he could gather
thi task zinti undertook gladli for he love follow a spoor which
wa a gift that natur had given him also he wa weari of be coop
up like a fat fowl upon the mountain umpondwana
when zinti had gone sihamba summon other messeng and command
them to travel swiftli to the kraal umgungundlhovo bear her homag
to dingaan king of the amazulu and ask whether he had lost ani of
the cattl from hi royal herd sinc certain white oxen had been found
among her beast though how thei came there she could not tell these
men went also though in fear and trembl sinc in those dai none
love to approach the lion of the zulu with tale of cattl of hi that
had strai among their herd still thei went and with doubt in her
heart sihamba sat await their return
chapter xxviii
the come of the impi
sihamba had not veri long to wait for on the even of the fifth
dai from the start of the messeng thei came back at great speed
have run so fast that thei could scarc speak for want of breath
and tell her that a zulu impi number more than three thousand
spear wa advanc upon the umpondwana to destroi them it seem
that long befor the king oxen had been found mix with her herd it
had been report to dingaan that sihamba had stolen them which wa not
altogeth strang see that swart piet travel with the impi as
she suspect he had caus the oxen to be stolen and now he had fix
the deed upon her know well that dingaan onli sought a pretext to
destroi her tribe with which the zulu had an ancient quarrel
now there wa but on thing to be doneto make readi their defenc so
without more ado sihamba summon her council and told them that a zulu
impi wa at hand to eat them up becaus of the white cattl that had
been place among the herd then the councillor wrung their hand and
some of them shed tear even although thei were ag men for the name
of the zulu struck terror to their heart and thei expect noth
less than death for themselv their wive and their children
it is best that we should fly while there is yet time said the
captain of the council
there is no time answer sihamba the impi will be here by dawn and
will cut you up upon the plain
what then shall we do thei ask we who ar alreadi dead
do she cri you shall fight as your father fought befor you and
beat back these dog of dingaan if you will but be brave what have you
to fear from them you have water you have food you have spear and
even the zulu have not wing like eagl with which to fly over your
wall of cliff let them come and if you will but obei me i promis
you that thei shall return again to make report to the eleph mani
fewer than thei left hi kraal
so the umpondwana made readi to fight not becaus thei love it but
becaus thei must for thei knew that no humbl would help them in
face of the spear of dingaan the cattl were driven into the centr
kraal and great suppli of grass and green corn were cut to feed them
except for on manhol the pass lead to the top of the mountain wa
close and the schanz or wall which protect the mouth of the
river that well from the hillsid between the eastern ridg were
strengthen and garrison here as sihamba knew wa their weak
place for thi river flow out beneath the impregn precipic of
rock and to it thei must look for their main suppli of water sinc
although the spring upon the tableland if husband would suffic for
a suppli to the tribe it wa not suffici for the cattl it wa for
thi reason that sihamba wish to turn the kine loos and let the zulu
captur them if thei would for she knew that then thei could never take
the mountain or harm a hair of the head of on of it inhabit but
the umpondwana were greedi and would not consent to the loss of their
cattl forget that cattl ar of no valu to dead men thei said
that thei could veri well defend the schanz which surround the
sourc of the river and that from it suffici water could be carri
to keep the beast aliv even if the sieg were long
as you will answer sihamba shortli but see that you do defend
them when the zulu warrior leap upon the wall for if you fail then
you will lose cattl and life togeth
all thi time accord to her daili custom suzann had been seat
in her chair of rock upon the highest point of the precipic look for
that help which never came present as she watch with sad ey far
awai upon the plain she saw a cloud of dust in which move and shone
the sheen of spear now she climb down from her seat and ran to seek
sihamba whom she found surround by her councillor
what is it swallow ask the littl chieftai look up though
alreadi she had guess the answer
suzann told her ad who can it be that travel toward the
mountain with so great a forc
ladi swallow said sihamba grave it is an armi of the zulu sent
by dingaan to destroi us and with them march bullhead and she told
her of the trick of the cattl and of what the messeng had seen
suzann heard and her face grew white as the goatskin cloak she wore
then at last the long stori is at an end she falter for she knew
the terribl prowess of the zulu and how none could stand befor their
onslaught
ye of that impi there is an end answer sihamba proudli if these
children of mine will but take heart and fight as their father fought
fear not ladi swallow noth that ha not wing can storm the
mountain of umpondwana
but for all that she could sai suzann still felt much afraid which wa
not strang for she knew that the heart wa out of these soldier
of sihamba and knew moreov that a zulu armi did not dare to be
defeat for which reason it must either take the mountain or fight
till it wa destroi
now all wa confus the horn blew and women wail while the
captain of the umpondwana issu their command and the men pile up
stone upon the brink of the precipic to roll down upon the foe and
drove the herd of cattl into the great kraal upon the tableland
march quickli the impi drew near and the defend could see that
it number about four thousand spear and wa compos of two separ
regiment at a distanc of a mile it halt and throw out horn or
wing surround the mountain up the slope of which it advanc in a
thin circl much as beater do who ar drive game to a certain point
as the circl drew nearer to the cliff it thicken have less
ground to cover though still there wa a gap here and there
present those who were watch saw a man dart through on of these
gap and run up hill at great speed follow by zulu soldier who
tri to kill him but he wa the swifter of foot moreov he knew the
path so that befor thei could come up with him he reach the great
stone wall which were built about the sourc of the river and wa
drag over them by the defend
a while later thi man appear upon the top of the mountain and prove
to be none other than zinti who had return from hi errand and
have new to tell risk hi life to pass through the impi befor
the stronghold wa altogeth surround sihamba receiv him at onc
suzann stand at her side and bade him be brief for she had littl
time to listen to long stori
i will be brief zinti answer ladi as you bade me i cross the
mountain by the road of which you told me it is a good road for men on
foot or horseback but waggon could not travel it have reach
the plain on the further side i follow the bank of the river till
suddenli i came in sight of thirti waggon drawn up in a laager upon a
knoll of ground and among the waggon i saw boer with their wive and
children i tri to go up to speak to them but a young boer see
me shot at me with hi gun so i thought it safer to lie hid at
nightfal howev i met the driver of on of the waggon a kaffir
man at some distanc from the laager where he wa watch by a pit
made to catch buck and fell into talk with him he told me that thi
wa a parti of the boer who had trek from cape coloni and were
take possess of natal and that there were other such parti
scatter about the countri he said that in thi parti there were
fiveandtwenti men with women and children but he did not know the
name of ani of them also he told me that he meant to run awai as he
heard that dingaan wa go to attack the white peopl and wa sure
that if he did so thei would be eaten up for these boer think
themselv quit safe had grown veri careless and neither made their
laager as strong as it should be nor set ani watch at night have
learn thi i return at onc to make report to you nor did i come
too quickli for the zulu nearli caught me as i pass their rank
i saw bullhead as i ran he is ride a brown hors and seem quit
recov from hi wound
how far is the boer laager from thi place ask sihamba befor
suzann could speak
ladi a man on a good hors could reach it in seven hour nor is it
possibl to mistak the wai after cross the plain you enter the
gorg by the sawedg rock yonder and follow it wind across the
mountain till you come out the other side where the river run down to
the flat countri then you can keep along the bank of the river as i did
when i went or if you wish to go more quickli you must head for a larg
whitetop hill or koppi which can be seen from the mountain and
when you come to it you will find the boer laager upon the knoll at it
foot but near to the bank of the river which wind round it
oh let us go let us go quickli said suzann spring to her feet
for the thought even of see a white man again made her drunk with
hope
ala sister answer sihamba sadli an hour ago we might have gone
or rather you might have gone mount on the great schimmel but
nowlook and she point to where the zulu cluster like bee along
the bank of the river by which the path ran see she ad there
is but on road out of thi stronghold for nowher els can the
surestfoot climber in the world descend it cliff no not with a
rope to help him and that road is thick with zulu spear moreov a
certain man whom you do not wish to see wait for you upon it
suzann look too late she moan oh sure my god ha forsaken
me within six hour of safeti and doom to perish here oh sure my
god ha forsaken me and she burst out weep in the bitter of her
disappoint hope
sai not so answer sihamba gentli for i think that the great on
whom you worship will save you yet
as she spoke a messeng arriv sai that the zulu had sent forward
herald who desir to speak with her and that these herald wait
within earshot of the first wall
i will come said sihamba and she pass down the cleft and through
the man hole into the fortif which were built about the sourc
of the river but she would not allow suzann to accompani her
when she reach the outer wall she climb it and stood upon it for
sihamba wa a woman who knew no fear and there about forti pace awai
she saw three great zulu stand and with them him whom she dread
more than all the zulu on the earthpiet van vooren himself when the
zulu captain caught sight of her upon the wall thei jeer aloud and
ask whether thi wa inde sihamba ngenyanga or if a shemonkei had
been sent to talk with them
i am sihamba she answer quietli or i am a monkei as it mai
pleas you though the white man with you can tell you what i am
i can said piet with a laugh you ar a witch and a thief and the
fate that i promis you long ago is with you at last
murder mock sihamba in answer i see death stand behind you
and with him shadow of the fear to come but i would speak with these
chief and not with an outcast halfbre tell me chief why do you

chapter xxix
thirst
when sihamba finish her talk with the captain of dingaan the sun
wa alreadi sink still the umpondwana thought that the zulu would
attack at onc but these shout to the defend that thei might rest
easili till the dawn sinc thei wish to have daylight by which to
divid the spoil and at daylight the attack came drive the men of
bullhead in front of them much against their will for thei knew these
to be coward and wish to make mock of them compani by compani the
zulu rush at the stone wall though mani of them were kill and
often thei were driven back but alwai thei came on laugh and
shout their warcri till the arm of the umpondwana grew weari with
stab at them as their plume head appear abov the level of the
wall still fight under the ey of sihamba whose bitter tongu
thei fear her peopl held their own for inde the place wa almost
impregn to the attack of men arm onli with spear howev brave
thei might be and had it been defend by warrior of true zulu blood
it could never have been taken
when the fight had rage for an hour or more the zulu captain withdrew
their men and went apart to consult with van vooren for their loss wa
heavi and thei saw that if thei were to captur the head water of the
river thei must seek some other plan veri soon thei found it the river
issu from the side of the mountain not as a littl stream but as a
broad fierc water so deep and rapid wa it that the tripl line of
defenc work of the umpondwana were built onli to it edg for the
water ran through a rocki gorg although thorn tree fasten by their
trunk were thrust out for ten or twelv feet over the bank of the
gorg from either side of the stream now in the centr of thi river
which mai have been thirti pace wide wa a long ridg or saddl of
rock over which the water boil furious although here it wa not
more than three feet deep thi ridg began at a point within the last
line of wall and ran down to some fiveandtwenti pace below the first
wall swart piet had note the ridg
there is a saddl on which you mai ride to victori he said
how so bullhead ask the captain
thu yonder stand tree with tall stem and green top cut them down
and make a bridg from the bank to the saddl then wade up the saddl
where the water is not more than waist deep till you ar past the third
wall and reach the bank insid it as best you can
now although he wa a brave man as were all the zulu in those dai
the captain look long and doubtfulli at the white water which foam
upon the ridg
there is death in that water he said
death for some and victori for other answer van vooren but if
you fear it go back to dingaan and tell him so for in no other wai can
thi mountain be taken see that it is impregn and that thirst
alon can conquer it
i fear noth white man answer the zulu but if you ar so
brave why show us black peopl the wai along yonder ridg
piet shrug hi shoulder i wish to keep aliv for reason of my
own besid i am not a soldier of dingaan he answer
then the captain turn and command such men as had battl ax to cut
down three of the longest tree which thei did although the task wa
difficult for the wood wa hard and their ax were light when at
length the tree were down thei roll them uphil to a spot where the
ridg of rock end which wa not more than thirti pace from the face
of the outer wall now it wa that sihamba guess their purpos for the
first time for until then she had believ that thei were cut the
tree to us them as batter ram against the wall
thei ar come on us by the path of the river she said and call
for men to salli out and prevent them make the bridg from the bank to
the saddl but none answer her for thei dare not face the zulu in
the open
the water will sweep them awai thei said moreov when thei try to
land we can spear them
coward she moan on your own head be your doom
so the umpondwana content themselv with stand behind the first
wall and cast vollei of spear at those who thrust out the tree
within thirti pace of them while zinti shot at them with hi gun
kill sever but come between the zulu made a shield hedg to
protect their comrad so that the light throw assegai did littl
hurt and of the few that the gun kill thei thought noth
present the end of the tree lai beneath the water on the ridg
of rock and the captain command a certain induna to lead hi men
across now all nativ fear a wet death and though he wa a brave man
who would gladli have rush the fortif alon had he been so
command thi soldier to whom the captain spoke look askanc at the
furiou torrent and hesit but that captain had serv under chaka
and knew how to deal with those who show doubt or fear lift hi
heavi assegai he drove it through the man so that he fell dead and as
he smote cri coward take thi gift from the king
then call to the soldier he himself ran out upon the bridg of
treetrunk and leap into the water that rose to hi middl in an
instant he would have been swept awai for the current wa veri fierc
had not those who follow sprang down at hi side and behind him for
a moment thei manag to keep their feet till other came give them
support and be themselv protect by a breakwat built of the men
who had gone first then form in a doubl line each man link
hi arm round the middl of hi comrad in front as kaffir girl
link themselv in a danc and veri slowli thi human chain began to
struggl forward along the back of the ridg at time inde the
weight of the stream wa almost too much for them and swept some of
them off into the deep water which ran on either side but the strong
rope of human muscl held and thei were drag back again now thei
were between the lip of the first wall and the umpondwana soldier
hurl spear at them from the bank kill mani but if a man wa
slain or even badli wound hi companion who held him let go and
if need thrust him into the water who could no longer serv the
king then he grip the soldier who stood in front of the lost on
and the chain drag on
oh men of the umpondwana cri sihamba had you but half the heart
of these who ar brave we need fear noth from dingaan and the
zulu in the stream who heard her call in answer
you ar right littl chieftai we ar brave
slowli the black snakelik line press forward through the white foam
never heed the storm of spear that slew continu till the point
of it wa well within the third line of wall then the captain who by
some chanc had escap call an order to those behind him and the
head of the doubl line leapt off the ridg of rock into deep water and
swim with their feet but still grip with their hand suffer
themselv to be swung round by the current toward the bank twenti
yard awai here some rock jut out and these after a great
struggl thei were abl to grasp and hold
then follow what suzann who wa watch from abov afterward
declar to be the strangest sight she had ever seen for these men who
swung to and fro in the current anchor as it were to the ridg and
the bank made of their live bodi a bridg for their fellow ye
their companion ran and crawl over them spring from shoulder to
shoulder and drive their head beneath the water with the push of
their cling feet halfdrown and almost torn in two as thei were
still thei held on till enough men were safe on shore to finish the
frai for when the umpondwana saw that the zulu had won the bank thei
did not stai to kill them while thei land as might easili have been
done no drag sihamba with them thei ran into the gorg lead to
the flat top of the mountain and block it with great stone that were
readi and so it came about that the zulu won thi fight though with
great loss to themselv and cut off the umpondwana from their main
suppli of water
but though thei had won the fight thei had not won the mountain after
rest a while thei began the work of storm the narrow gorg that
led upward to the tableland for thi gorg wa it onli gate and
at first were suffer to pull down or climb over the wall which were
built across it with but littl resist soon howev thei found
out the reason of thi for when a number of them were in the gorg
stone began to roll upon them from the edg of the cliff abov
crush the life out of mani so that present thei were driven back
to the head of the river afterward thei search long and earnestli
but could find no other path by which to attack for there wa none
well said the zulu captain it seem that we must fight the fight of
sitdown and sinc these rockrabbit will not let us come to them we
must wait till thei come to us to ask for water
so thei wait for seven whole dai set guard about the mountain
in case there should be secret wai of egress of which thei knew
noth
when thei reach the tableland sihamba spoke word so bitter to her
councillor and captain that some of them stop their ear that thei
might hear no more while other answer that thei could do noth
against men who walk upon the boil water
now inde you can do noth against them sihamba cri for
thirst will fight for them and he is the best of friend becaus of
your cowardic we must perish everyon of us and for my part i should
be glad of it were it not that you have given the ladi swallow to death
also
then she buri her face in the ground and would sai no more even when
thei told her that the zulu had been beaten back by the rock that were
roll down upon them
for some dai the littl spring gave enough water for the thousand of
peopl who were crowd upon the mountain top though there wa none
to spare for the cattl but on the third night the poor beast be
madden by thirst broke out of the kraal and rush to the spring
so trampl it with their hoof that it water were seal up and onli
veri littl could be obtain even by dig for here the rock came
near to the surfac of the soil and it would seem as though the cours
of the spring wa turn or choke beneath it
then all those upon that mountain began to suffer the horror of thirst
soon the cattl were altogeth mad and rush to and fro in herd
bellow furious and gore everyon thei met or trampl them to
the earth now the umpondwana strove to be rid of them by drive them
down the gorg but the zulu guess the troubl that the presenc
of these beast wa bring upon the besieg would not suffer them to
pass next thei attempt to forc them over the edg of the precipic
but when thei were driven to it the oxen turn and charg through
them kill sever men after thi thei content themselv with
stab the most danger of the anim and leav the rest to rush
to and fro as thei would for thei did not care to kill them all lest
their carcass should breed a pestil
the sixth dai came and oh the great kraal of the umpondwana wa but
as a hell wherein lost soul wander in torment for the sun beat down
upon it fierc and everywher roam or lai men women and children
overcom with the tortur of thirst inde of the last some were
alreadi dead especi those who were at the breast for their
mother milk wa dry here three men had drag an old wife from her
hut and were beat her to make her reveal the store of water which
she wa believ to have hidden there other were cut the throat
of an ox that thei might drink it blood and yonder a littl girl
wa turn stone to lick the damp side of them with her poor parch
tongu
in the midst of these scene which pass outsid her hut sat sihamba
brood as chieftai she still had about a pint of water store
in a jar but though she had made suzann drink herself she drank but
littl for she would not consent to suffer less than those about her
now sihamba ey fell upon the child who wa lick stone and her
heart wa wrung with piti go into the hut she fetch most of the
water in a gourd and call to the child who stagger toward her
for she could scarc walk she gave it to her bid her drink
slowli
in a moment it wa gone everi drop of it and behold the dim ey
brighten and the shrunken limb seem to grow round again while the
young voic no longer high and crack prais and bless her name
sihamba motion the child awai then she went into the hut to weep
onli weep she could not sinc her ey were too dry for tear
three more dai she thought to herself and thei will all be
dead unless rain should fall ye the coward and those whom their
cowardic ha betrai will all be dead togeth
as she thought thu suzann enter the hut and there wa tide in
her ey
what is it sister ask sihamba and whenc do you come
i come from the high seat upon the edg of the cliff she answer
where i have sat all dai for i can no longer bear these sight and i
have thi to tell that the zulu ar march across the plain but not
toward zululand sinc thei head for the quathlamba mountain
chapter xxx
sihamba prevail
now a fire of hope shot up in sihamba ey but soon it di out
again
it is a trick it must be a trick she said for who ever heard of a
zulu loos the prei that wa in hi hand never dare he do it save
by the command of the king and she left the hut to be met by other
run with the same tide of these she sent some down the gorg
to bring her report of what had happen and with them zinti for she
could not altogeth trust the word of her own peopl
within an hour the messeng return and on their face wa a strang
look which clever as she wa sihamba did not understand
is the path clear she ask
no chieftai thei repli it is still block for though
the zulu have gone we know not where by order receiv from dingaan
bullhead hold it with such of hi own men as ar left aliv
had you speech with the white man she ask
ye ladi
sai on
now thei look about them like peopl who ar asham but at last the
oldest of them spoke
chieftai he said bullhead made us thi offer and in these
word you peopl of the umpondwana you ar dy of thirst and i know
it ye though the zulu have gone and but few of us ar left here yet
you cannot forc the narrow wai against us so that i have onli to sit
here for a few dai longer and you will be dead of thirst everyon of
you you and your cattl togeth but i do not wish that you should
die for with you i have no quarrel also if you die on will perish
among you whom i desir to keep aliv therefor i make you thi offer
hand over to me your ruler sihamba ngenyanga and with her the white
woman name swallow and you yourselv shall go free everyon of you
more although i will take thi stronghold of your to live in myself i
will give back to you the half of the cattl now answer
ladi when he had finish speak we consult togeth and answer
bullhead thu we cannot give over to you our chieftai and her
white sister for it is better to die than that such dishonour should
lie upon our name but if you will let us go you can take them from
among our number as we pass befor you for that will be no fault of
our or if thei do not choos to accompani us after we have gone by
you can ascend the mountain and take them
to thi bullhead assent sai set the ladi swallow in her chair
upon the cliff edg and sihamba at her side so that my ey see them
mai know that thei ar safe and you shall go so it wa agre between
us that tomorrow at the dawn he will open the wall and let us down to
the river to drink after which we mai pass whither we will
now when sihamba heard these shame word her rage wa so great that
for a while she could not even speak at length she found her tongu and
gasp out
oh father of coward do you dare to sing such a song in my ear why
do not you who ar mani storm the pass and take the water
ladi answer the old man coldli we dare becaus we must for
honour cannot live befor the assegai of thirst you talk to us of
storm the pass we cannot storm it for ten men can hold that place
against a hundr also our arm ar weak and we ar weari of war
listen on the on hand ar the live of thousand with them your
own and that of the white swallow and on the other thi dishonour we
choos the dishonour sinc if you and the swallow do not desir to fall
into the hand of bullhead you can still do what you must have done
had we chosen honour ladi you can die know that by your death you
have save the live of the multitud over whom you rule
listen again ladi we did not seek you it wa you who came back to us
after the death of the chief your brother we accept you and you
have rule us justli for these two year but you wish to make of us
a fight peopl who ar and who desir to remain a peopl of peac
moreov you promis that the white chieftai your companion
would bring us prosper and good wherea to us she ha been a bird of
illomen for sinc she came here on her account there ha been war
and noth but war ye becaus of her we have been coop up on
thi mountain and kill whenev we ventur on to the plain beyond
therefor we will have no more of her she must find her own fortun
for we have our live and those of our wive and children to save
further i sai thi the new of the offer of bullhead ha gone abroad
among the peopl and had we refus thei would have torn us limb from
limb ye and you and the white swallow also our heart ar sad but
ladi who can fight against fate
i can answer sihamba but have no fear tomorrow at the dawn you
shall see us sit out upon the cliff point and now father of coward
begon and let me see your face no more betrai us if you will you who
were not men enough to hold the water you who ar not men enough to cut
a path to it as you might and therefor must complet your cowardic
with treacheri betrai us if you will but i tell you that you shall not
go free from thi disgrac the curs of chaka shall fall upon you and
the blade of the spear shall be the inherit of you who ar afraid to
grasp it shaft begon and wither by her word and the fire of her
ey the spokesmen of the umpondwana crept like beaten hound from the
presenc of their desert chieftai
here i will stop the tale to sai that thi propheci of sihamba came
true as did all the propheci of that strang woman who with other
gift without doubt had that of foresight a few year later when
panda wa king and their war with us boer were end the zulu who
never forgot a quarrel swoop down upon the umpondwana unawar and
storm the mountain by night put all the men on it to the spear and
carri awai the women and children to zululand so that of thi tribe
there remain noth but some crumbl wall and a name of shame
now the sun had set upon that home of thirst and all wa silent in it
save for the sound of the hoof of the gallop cattl as thei rush
hither and thither and the groan of the women and children who
wander about seek grass to chew for the sake of the night damp
that gather on it sihamba went into the great hut where she alwai
slept with suzann whom she found seat upon a stool wanfac and
her ey set wide with miseri of mind and bodi
what pass now ask suzann
the littl woman came to her and throw her arm about her neck she
kiss her answer
ala sister all thing pass and with them our live and she told
her of the surrend of the umpondwana and it term
suzann listen in silenc for grief and despair had done their worst
with her and her heart could hold no more pain
so it is finish at last she said when sihamba had spoken and
thi is the end of all our toil and strive and of our long fight
against fate ye thi is the end that we must die or at the least i
must die for i will choos death rather than that van vooren should
lai a finger upon me well i should care littl were it not that now
i believ my husband to be still aliv and it is hard to go befor him
into yonder dark though i believ also that the dark which we
fear will prove such a happi light as doe not shine upon thi earth
and she laid her head upon sihamba breast and thei wept togeth
present sihamba said my mind that wa wont to be so clear is
darken prai to your god you who ar of hi peopl that he mai send
light upon it so that i can think onc more while there is yet time
now we wander in the forest of despair but never yet wa there a forest
so thick that it cannot be pass prai then that i mai be given light
for your life hang upon it
so suzann prai and present as she prai her weari overcam
her and she slept and sihamba slept also when sihamba awok it wa
within an hour of midnight a littl lamp of oil burnt in the hut and
by the light of it she could see the white face of suzann ly at her
side and groan in her bitter to think that befor the sun set
again that face must be whiter still for she knew that the swallow wa
not of the mind of the umpondwana who prefer dishonour to death
oh that my wisdom might come back to me she murmur oh
greatgreat god of my sister give me back my wisdom and i will pai my
life for it oh lighter of the star for myself i ask noth who am
not of thy children let etern death be my portion but give me back
my wisdom that i mai save my sister who serv thee
thu prai sihamba out of the depth of her untutor heart not for
herself but for anoth and it would seem that her prayer wa heard
though mani among our peopl think that god doe not listen to the black
creatur at the least as her ey wander around the hut thei fell
upon certain jar of earthenwar now dure the year that she dwelt
among the umpondwana suzann had but two pastim on of them wa to
carv wood with a knife and the other to paint pictur upon jar for
which art she alwai had a tast these jar be afterward burnt in
the fire for pigment she us certain clai or ochr red and black
and white and yellow which were found in abund on the slope of
the mountain and also a kind of ink that she made by boil down the
kernel of the fruit of the greenleav tree which grew by the bank of
the river
now it wa as she gaze at these jar of pigment and the brush of
goat hair that the wisdom which she sought came to sihamba ye in a
moment it came to her in a moment her plan wa made and she knew that
it would not fail tomorrow at the dawn the umpondwana to the number
of sever thousand would pour through the pass on to the plain
beyond well suzann should go with them she should go as a black
woman alreadi her hair and ey were dark and with those pigment her
snowwhit flesh could be darken also and then in the crowd who would
know her from a kaffir girl she who could talk the languag as though
she had been born a kaffir stai bullhead wa art and clever and
perhap he might be readi for such a trick how could she deceiv him
again she look at the jar and again wisdom came to her it wa
the habit of suzann to sit in her dizzi chair of rock and watch the
sunris hope ever that in the light of it she might see white men
ride to rescu her and thi van vooren knew for she could be seen
from the mouth of the pass below where from hour to hour he would stand
gaze at her five hundr feet abov hi head
well tomorrow at the dawn anoth white woman should be seat yonder
to satisfi hi ey or at least a woman who seem to be white on the
cliff edg not far from thi veri rock lai the bodi of a poor girl who
that dai had di of thirst if it face and arm and feet were paint
white and suzann cloak of white goat hair were set upon it
shoulder and the corps itself place upright in the chair who
look at it from hundr of feet beneath could guess that it wa not
suzann and who see it set aloft would seek for suzann among the
crowd of escap kaffir the plan wa good it could scarc fail
onli time press
sister awak whisper sihamba suzann sat up at onc for the
sleep of the doom is light listen sister went on sihamba that
wisdom for which you prai ha come to me and she told her all the
plan
it is veri clever and it mai serv answer suzann for i
understand these paint and can stain myself so that if my hair is cut
none would know me from a kaffir but sihamba there is on thing which
i do not understand what will you do for if you attempt to escap your
statur will betrai you
i hesit the littl woman nai i do not know i have never
thought of it doubtless i shall win through in thi wai or in that
you ar deceiv me sihamba well there is an end i will not go
without you
can you think of death and sai that you will not go without me
i can sihamba
can you think of your father and your mother and sai that you will not
go without me
i can sihamba
can you think of your husband and sai that you will not go without me
i can falter suzann
truli you ar brave laugh the littl woman there is more courag
in that white heart of your than in those of all the umpondwana well
sister i also am brave or at the least for these mani moon i have set
myself a task nor will i shrink from it at the end and that is to save
you from piet van vooren as onc at a dearer price you save me now
hearken for myself i have no fear as i have said doubtless in thi
wai or in that i shall win through but it cannot be at your side i
must rejoin you afterward what you refus to go then ladi swallow
you send me down to death and your hand ar red with my blood i am
weari i will not live to see more troubl life is hard and death is
easi finish your own battl swallow and fly out your flight alon
and draw a knife from her girdl sihamba laid it upon her knee
do you mean that you will kill yourself if i refus your prayer
noth less sister and at onc for i thirst and would seek some
land where there is water or where we need none it come to thi
then if you consent i mai live if you refus i must die
i cannot do it moan suzann let us die togeth
now sihamba crept to her and whisper in her ear
think of ralph kenzi and of what hi life must be if you should die
think of those children who will come and of that first kiss of love
found again which you must miss in death whatev els it mai have to
give think of the knife point that you would chang for it or the
last sick rush down a mountain height of space think of your husband
hark i hear him call you
then suzann yield
o woman with a nobl heart she murmur i listen to your tempt
mai god forgiv me and god reward you o woman with the nobl heart
chapter xxxi
sihamba farewel
then thei began the work for much must be done befor the daylight
came first sihamba took a sharp knife and with it cut off suzann
beauti hair close to the head over which what wa left of it curl
natur to disguis it further for though it wa dark it wa too
fine for the hair of a nativ she put greas upon it and powder
it with the blue dust that kaffir women us thi done the poor girl
strip herself and with the help of sihamba smear all her bodi
everi inch of it down to the sole of her feet with the inklik juic
mix with the black earth and greas which when it wa dry made her
the colour of a kaffir next sihamba dress her in a nativ woman
moocha made of skin and bead and gave her an old skin blanket to wear
upon her shoulder and hide sandal for her feet togeth with anklet
of bead and copper wire then have examin her all over to see that
no sign of her white skin could be seen through the pigment and burn
the long tress of her hair sihamba went to the door of the hut
where ar you go ask suzann

nativ await the return of sihamba present she came follow by
zinti who wa in good case though somewhat thin for zinti wa clever
and provid and forese what would come he had hidden water for
himself among the rock
zinti said sihamba i would speak with you of secret matter

small heed of either but stood stare

must lead her as fast as you can travel to that camp of the boer which
is near the tugela river where she will be safe do you understand
i understand ladi but what of yourself
it is my plan to hide on the mountain sihamba answer quickli in
a secret place i know of see that it is imposs that i should
escap becaus my statur would betrai me i will join you at the boer
camp later or fail that you can return in a whilesai on the
first night of the new moonto search for me but talk no more for we
have still much to do ye we who have made a white woman black must
make a black woman white follow me both of you and give zinti a
jar of pigment and the long goatskin cloak which suzann wore for an
outer garment she left the hut carri in her hand strip of oxhid
tan white
avoid the group of thirsttor peopl who sat or wander about
in the cool of the night thei pass through the gate of the
kraal unheed and walk quickli across the wide stretch of tableland
reach the eastern edg of the cliff now upon the veri verg of thi
cliff rose a sharp pinnacl of rock fifti feet or more into the air and
upon the top of thi pinnacl wa that stone shape like a great chair
in which suzann sat dai by dai pois like an eagl over the dizzi
gulf of space for the slope of the mountain swell five hundr feet
beneath watch for the help that never came not far from the base of
thi point sihamba began to search in the starlight till she found
what she want the bodi of a young woman who had crept here to die of
thirst and whose death and the place of it had been report to her
now she took the jar of white clai and aid by zinti set about her
ghastli task daub the stuff thickli upon the cold featur and the
neck and arm and feet soon it wa done for such work need littl
care but then began their true toil sinc the corps must be carri up
the sharp point of rock and that by no easi path had not zinti been so
strong it could never have been done still with the aid of suzann and
sihamba herself at last it wa finish
up that steep place thei toil the three of them drag the dead
bodi from knob to knob of rock well know that on fals step in the
gloom would send them to be broken to piec hundr of feet beneath
at length thei reach the littl platform where there wa scarc room
for all of them to stand with their burden and climb on to the stone
which wa call the chair zinti drew the dead woman into the seat of
it
then as sihamba bade him he wrap her in suzann long white cape of
goatskin put the hood of it upon her head after which he made the
corps fast in a sit postur lash it round the neck and middl
to the back of the stone with the white tan rimpi in such fashion
that it could not fall or even slip
so said sihamba grimli there sit the bridg upon whom swart piet
can feast hi ey while you seek safeti across the mountain now back
to the town for from thi height i can alreadi see light glimmer in
the east
accordingli thei return to the hut and enter it leav zinti
without none note them sinc by now the multitud were throng
the narrow wai here sihamba lit the lamp and by it light onc more
examin suzann carefulli retouch the dye in thi place and in
that till she wa sure that no gleam of white show through it
it is good she said at length unless you betrai yourself your skin
will not betrai you and now ladi swallow the hour ha come for us
to part and i rejoic to think that some of the debt i ow you i have

light i see mani new thing ye ye i see that thi life of our is

swallowsist swallow fare you well and throw herself upon
her breast sihamba kiss her again and again then with a strang
strength she thrust her from the hut call to zinti to take charg
of her and do as she had bidden him ad that if he fail in thi
task she would blast hi bodi and haunt hi spirit
thu part sihamba the kaffir witchdoctoress and my daughter
suzann whom she kept safe for nearli three year and save at last at
the cost of her own life ye thu thei part and for alwai in the
flesh sinc it wa not fate that thei should meet again in thi world
and whether it ha been permit to sihambab a kaffir and no
christianto enter a better on is more than i can sai in her case
howev i hope that she ha found some hole to creep through for
although she wa a black witchdoctoress accord to her knowledg she
wa a good woman and a brave on as the reader will sai also befor he
come to the end of thi stori
outsid the hut zinti took suzann by the arm and led her through the
maze of the town to the open ground that lai between it and the mouth
of the steep cleft which ran down to the slope of the mountain
all thi space wa crowd with peopl for as yet thei could not enter
the cleft which nowher wa more than ten feet wide becaus it wa
fill with cattl some aliv and some dead that drawn by the smell
of water beneath had gather as near to it as the stone wall which
block the pass would allow
suzann and zinti mingl with thi crowd of fugit take a
posit almost in the midst of it for thei did not wish to pass out
either among the first or the last there thei wait a while
none note them for in their great agoni of thirst all thought of
themselv and not of their neighbour inde husband desert their
sick wive and mother their children which were too heavi to carri
ye thei desert them to be trampl by the feet of men and the hoof
of cattl
now the eastern sky grew grei and though the sun had not yet risen the
light wa such that a man could see the vein upon the back of hi hand
and the white moon on hi fingernail present as though move by
on impuls thousand of voic utter a hoars cry of it is dawn
open open
but it would seem that the wall still stood for the cattl remain
pack in so dens a mass that a man could have walk upon their back
as inde some tri to do
at last the sun rose or rather it rai shot upward across the eastern
ski like a fan of fire suzann turn her head and watch till
present the arrow of light struck upon the tall chair rock which wa
the highest point of all the mountain ye there in the chair sat the
white figur and by it side stood what seem to be a black child it
wa sihamba far below other ey were watch also the ey of swart
piet for he would not let the peopl go until he knew that suzann and
sihamba stai behind but now he saw them suzann in her accustom
place and at her side sihamba
pull down the wall he shout to hi men for he wa eager to clear
the pass of cattl and kaffir that he might go up it and thei obei
him befor thei were more than half down the oxen push and leap
forward madli clear what wa left of them and openmouth their
loll tongu hang from their dry jaw rush downward to the
water gore or trampl to death some of those who work at the
wall
the schanz ar down scream the peopl see the long line of
cattl move and immedi thei began to press forward also
at suzann side wa a young woman so weak with thirst that she could
scarc walk and on her back a yearold boi insens but live
for a red froth bubbl from hi lip a man thrust thi woman to on
side and she fell it wa that ag councillor who on the yesterdai had
brought new of the surrend to sihamba she tri to struggl to her
feet but other trampl upon her
sister sister she cri catch suzann by the hide blanket which
she wore i am dead but oh save my child
let it be whisper zinti but suzann could not deni those piteou
ey and as she pass she snatch up the boi and the sling in which
he wa carri by the dy woman set the band of it beneath her
own breast so she went forward bear him upon her hip nor did that
act of merci lack it reward for as shall be seen it wa her salvat
also the child live and to thi dai is a faith servant in our
hous though now hi beard is white
down the narrow wai surg the crowd scrambl over rock and dead
cattl and crush women and children till at the last suzann
drew near it open where stood swart piet and some twenti of hi
follow watch the multitud pass out
ladi whisper zinti into her ear now i fall behind for bullhead
mai know me if i win through i will rejoin you on the plain or by the
sawedg rock if i do not throw awai that child and follow the road
of which i have told you you can scarc mistak it go on show
no fear andstai let that blanket hang open in front it is not the
custom of these women to wear their garment wrap so close
suzann groan but she obei
chapter xxxii
the pass of the quathlamba
like wild beast escap from a pen that redei gasp mob rush
and stagger to the edg of the water and plung their head into
it with hoars grunt and cri drank and drank and drank inde
sever lost their live there for some fill themselv so full that
their vital were ruptur and some were thrust into the river by the
cattl or those press behind them to be carri awai by the swift
stream
just at the mouth of the pass suzann laden with the child wa push
down by those who follow and doubtless would have been trampl to
death had not on of swart piet men desir to clear the wai or
perhap move to piti at her plight drag her to her feet again but
when he had done thi he did not let her go but held her stare at
her beauti with greedi ey
here is a rockrabbit whom i shall keep for a wife he cri i would
rather take her than twenti fat oxen
now suzann heart nearli stood still with terror
water water she moan let me drink i prai you
do not fear i will take you to drink my pretti went on the man
still stare at her
then lose command of herself suzann scream and struggl and
the sound of her cri reach the ear of swart piet who wa stand
close at hand
what is thi he ask of the man
noth bullhead except that i have taken a woman whom i wish for a
wife becaus she is so fair
van vooren let hi ey rest upon her but dreamili for all hi
thought were given to her who sat aloft five hundr feet abov hi
head and feel their glanc suzann blood froze in her vein
ye she is fair he answer but she is a marri woman and i will
have no umpondwana brat among my peopl let her go and take a girl
if you will for van vooren did not wish that the few men who remain
with him should cumber themselv just then with women and children
sinc thei were need to look after the cattl
maid or wife i choos thi on and no other said the man sulkili
then black piet whose sullen temper could not brook to be cross
broke into a blaze of rage
do you dare to disobei me he shout with an aw kaffir oath let
her go dog or i will kill you
at thi the man who knew hi master loos hold of suzann who ran
awai though it wa not until she reach the water that she notic a
white ring round her arm where hi grip had rub the paint off the
skin beneath strang enough van vooren saw the ring and at that
distanc mistook it for an ivori ornament such as kaffir women often
wear abov the elbow still more strang it white colour made him
think again of the white woman who sat aloft yonder and he turn hi
face upward forget all about the black girl with the child
thrust herself through the crowd suzann ran on for a while till she
wa clear of the worst of it then terrifi though she wa she could
resist the temptat of the water no longer for her mouth and throat
felt dry and rough climb down to the edg of the river she drank
greedili under the shelter of a rock and when she had satisfi some
of her thirst she pour water into the mouth of the child dip
it shrunken littl bodi into the stream whereon it seem to increas
befor her ey like a dry spong that is left out in the rain
while she tend the child thu and just as it began to find it sens
and to wail feebli she chanc to look up and to her terror saw that
man from whom she had escap walk along the bank look for her
happi wa it for suzann that the rock under which she wa crouch hid
her for the man stood for thirti second or more within two pace so
that she wa oblig to plung the bodi of the boi under water to stifl
it cry
then as it happen the kaffir caught sight of anoth woman and
infant more than a hundr yard awai and ran off toward them
thereon suzann replac the halfchok child upon her back climb
the bank hide the white mark upon her arm beneath the blanket and
take such shelter as she could behind stone or cattl or knot of
peopl who their thirst appeas were hasten to escap she slip
across the shoulder of the slope
now she wa out of sight of swart piet and hi men and for the first
time for mani a dai began to breath freeli for a while she crept
on round the flank of the mountain then at the best of her speed she
struck across the plain straight for the sawedg rock ten mile awai
which mark the entranc to the pass over the quathlamba rang
from time to time suzann look behind her but none follow her nor
search as she would could she discov ani trace of zinti who she
began to fear must have come to some harm on thing she could see
howeverth whiten corps set on high in the chair of rock and by
the side of it a black dot that she knew to be sihamba twice she turn
round and gaze at it but the second time the dot had becom almost
impercept although it still wa there long and earnestli she
look send her farewel through space to that true friend and
deliver whose ey as she knew well watch her flight and whose
heart went with her
then she travel on sadli wonder what wa that plan of escap of
which sihamba had spoken and why it wa that she stood there by the
corps and did not put it into practic wonder also when thei should
meet again and where a third time she turn and now the dead woman
on the rock wa but as a tini point of white and now it had altogeth
vanish awai
after thi suzann halt no more but press on steadili toward the
sawedg spur which she reach about twelv oclock for the grass
wa so tall the untrodden veldt so rough and the sun so hot that weak
as she felt with grief and the effect of thirst and laden with a heavi
child her progress wa veri slow at length howev she stood gasp
in it shadow gaze dismai at the huge rang of mountain befor her
and the steep rough cliff up which she must climb
never shall i cross them without foot and weight with thi child so
the end of it will be that i must die after all thought suzann as she
sank down by the bank of a littl rivulet rest her swollen feet in
it cool stream for then and inde for week after it seem to
her that she could never have enough of the tast and smell and feel of
water
as she sat thu strive to still the wail of the hungri boi
suddenli the shadow of a man fell upon her with a cry she sprang to her
feet to find herself face to face with zinti
oh i thought that thei had taken you she exclaim
no ladi i escap but i cross the plain far to your left for it
seem better that we should not be seen travel togeth from the
mountain now let us eat who have eaten littl for so mani dai lack
water to wash down the food and from the larg skin wallet which he
bore zinti drew out dri flesh and roast corn
suzann look at the food with long but befor she touch ani
she took some corn and have pound it into a pulp with a stone she
mix it with water and fed the child who devour the stuff greedili
and present fell asleep then thei at as much as thei want sinc
zinti carri enough for three such meal and never did suzann take
meat with a greater relish afterward though she yearn to sleep
thei press on again for zinti said it wa not safe to stai sinc
long befor thi van vooren would be seek her far and wide and if he
chanc to discov the secret of her flight he would travel further
in on hour on horseback than thei could in four on foot so thei went
forward up the pass much refresh zinti carri the child
all dai long thei walk thu rest at interv till by sunset
thei reach the crest of the pass and saw the wide plain of natal
stretch out like a map beneath them and on them not so veri far
awai and near to the bank of the river that wound at their feet a
whitetop koppi beneath which said zinti wa the boer camp
suzann sat down and look and there ye there the cap of the
waggon gleam in the fade light and oh her heart leapt at the
sight of them for in those waggon were white men and women such as she
had not seen for year and with whom at length she would be safe but
even as her breast heav at the thought of it an ici unnatur wind
seem to stir her hair and of a sudden she felt or seem to feel
the presenc of sihamba for a moment and on onli it wa with her
then it wa gone nor dure all her life did it ever come back again
oh sihamba is dead she cri
zinti look at her in question
it mai well be so he said sadli but i prai that it is not so for
she is the best of chieftai at least we have our own live to
save so let us go on and again thei press forward through the
gather gloom
soon it grew dark and had her guid been ani other man than zinti
suzann must have stop where she wa till the moon rose at midnight
but zinti could find ani path that hi feet had trod even in the dark
ye although it ran through piledup rock on the mountain side and
wa cut with the cours of stream which must be ford
in wade through on of these rivulet suzann struck her bare ankl
against a stone and lame herself so that from thi time forward
shiver and wet with water for her hurt wa so sharp and sudden that
she had fallen in the stream she wa forc to walk lean on zinti
shoulder and inde over some rough place he wa oblig to carri her
now again zinti wish to abandon that heavi child for strong though he
wa the weight of the two of them prove almost more than he could bear
but suzann would not listen to him
nai she said thi child that wa sent to me by heaven ha save me
from shame and death and shame and death be my portion if i will leav
it while i live go on alon if you will zinti and i will stai here
with the child
truli white peopl ar strang answer zinti that thei should wish
to burden themselv with the child of anoth when their own live ar
at stake but be it as you will ladi and he struggl forward as best
he could carri the on and support the other
thu for hour after hour slowli thei crept onward with onli the star
to light and guid them till at length about midnight the moon rose and
thei saw that thei were near the foot of the mountain now thei rest
awhil but not long enough to grow stiff then hasten down the slope
thei reach the plain and head for the whitetop koppi which
shone in the moonlight some six mile awai on thei crept suzann now
limp painfulli for her ankl had begun to swell and now crawl
upon her hand and knee for zinti had no longer the strength to carri
her and the child thu thei cover three mile in perhap as mani
hour at last with someth like a sob suzann sank to the earth
zinti i can walk no more she said either i must rest or die
he look at her and saw that she spoke truth for she wa quit
outworn
is it so he said then we must stai here till the morn nor do i
think that you will take hurt for bullhead will scarc care to cross
that pass by night
suzann shook her head and answer
he will have begun to climb it at the rise of the moon hear me
zinti the boer camp is close and you still have some strength left
take the child and go to it and have gain an entranc in thi wai
or in that tell them my plight and thei will ride out and save me
that is a good thought he said but ladi i do not like to leav
you alon sinc here there is no place for you to hide
you could not help me if you stai zinti therefor go for the
sooner you ar gone the sooner i shall be rescu
i hear your command ladi he answer and have given her most of
the food that wa left he fasten the sleep child upon hi shoulder
and walk forward up the rise
in someth less than an hour zinti came to the camp which wa form
of unlaag waggon and tent pitch at the foot of a koppi along
on base of which ran the river about fifti yard in front of the camp
stood a singl buckwaggon and near to it sill glow the ember of a
cookingfir
now if i try to pass that waggon those who watch by it will shoot at
me thought zinti though inde he need have had no fear for thei
were but campkaffir who slept soundli
not know thi howev he stood at a distanc and call aloud till
at last a hottentot crept out with a gun and throw back the blanket
from hi head ask who he wa and what he want
i want to see the baa of the camp he answer for my mistress a
white woman li exhaust upon the veldt not far awai and seek hi
help
if you want to see the baa yawn the man you must wait till
daylight when he wake up
i cannot wait answer zinti and he made as though to pass toward
the camp whereupon the man rais hi gun and cover him sai
if you go on i will shoot you for strai kaffir dog ar not allow to
prowl about the camp at night
what then must i do ask zinti
you can go awai or if you will you mai sit by the waggon here till it
is light and then when the boer my master wake up you can tell your
stori of which i believ noth
so have no choic zinti sat down by the waggon and wait while the
man with the gun watch him pretend to be asleep all the while
now suzann wa left alon upon the great veldt and fear took hold
of her for she wa broken in bodi and mind and the place wa veri
desol also she dread lest lion should take her for she could
hear them roar in the distanc or swart piet who wa wors than ani
lion still she wa so weari that after wash her face and hand in a
spring close by present she fell asleep when she awok the east wa
ting with the first grei light of the come dawn and it seem to
her as though some cold hand of fear had grip her heart of a sudden
and arous her from heavi sleep a sound caus her to look up and
there on the crest of the rise befor her some three hundr yard
awai she saw dark form move and caught sight of spear that
glimmer in the moonlight
now there is an end thought suzann to herself for without doubt
yonder stand a zulu impi the same that attack the umpondwana for
i can see the crane feather in their headdress and she crouch
upon the ground in an extrem of dread
chapter xxxiii
ralph find the dream mountain
now i must go back to that even when we learn the great tide
from the lip of the lad gaasha whose life ralph had save after the
attack by the kaffir upon the laager there sat gaasha on the ground
stare and there not far awai ralph wa ly in hi swoon while
jan and i look at each other like peopl who have suddenli beheld a
sign from heaven
what evil magic is there in my word said gaasha present that
thei should strike the baa yonder dead like a spear
he is not dead i answer but for long he ha sought that mountain
umpondwana of which you speak tell us now did you hear of ani white
woman dwell with the chieftai sihamba
no ladi i heard of none
thi answer of gaasha sadden me for i made sure that if so strang
a thing had happen as that a white woman had come to live among hi
tribe the man who told him of the return of sihamba would have told him
of thi also therefor so i argu either suzann wa dead or she
wa in the power of piet van vooren or sihamba had desert her though
thi last i did not believ as it turn out afterward had not gaasha
been the stupidest of kaffir we should have been save those long
dai of doubt and troubl for though he had not heard that sihamba wa
accompani by a white woman he had heard that she brought with her
a white bird to the mountain umpondwana of cours if he had told us
thi we should have guess that the white bird could be none other than
suzann whose nativ name wa swallow
well we set about reviv ralph which wa done by throw water
on to hi face when he had found hi sens again i prai him not to
suffer himself to be carri awai with hope sinc although gaasha had
heard of sihamba he had heard noth of suzann
to thi he answer that now when god had point out to him the
mountain of hi vision and in so strang a manner he had no fear but
that he would find hi wife upon it sinc god wa merci and did not
desir to mock or torment hi servant
i repli that i trust it might be so but the wai of the almighti
were beyond our understand nor did it becom us to pass judgment
upon them ralph scarc heed my word but spring to hi feet
said
come let us be go to the mountain umpondwana
first we must consult with the command and get aid from him said
jan for it would not be safe that we should wander into these wild
place alon where there ar mani kaffir who doubtless would murder
us
in hi eager ralph would not listen to thi for he desir to start
at onc but i point out to him that we had no hors all our be
dead of the sick moreov that the night wa dark and we could
not trek till the moon rose so at length he consent then we went
into the laager and jan call the older men togeth in a quiet place
what is it heer botmar ask the command when thei were
assembl
it is thi cousin said jan i desir to ask you to go a three dai
trek out of your march to a mountain call umpondwana whither thi
servant of mine gaasha can guid you
for what reason ask the command astonish
friend said jan you have all of you heard the stori of how that
outcast devil piet van vooren stole awai my onli child suzann the
wife of ralph kenzi the englishman here
that is an old tale said the command and doubtless the poor
girl is dead long ago why then do you speak of it now and what ha it
to do with your request that we should trek to the mountain umpondwana
onli thi cousin we think that my daughter suzann is live there
among the kaffir and we seek to rescu her at least thi is certain
for onli now we have learnt it from the lip of gaasha that sihamba her
friend and servant whom we believ wa with her rule over thi tribe
as chieftai
that mai be so said the command but did gaasha tell you that
your daughter wa there also
no answer jan
then how do you know it
now jan hesit and turn red as he repli
we know it becaus ralph kenzi here saw thi veri mountain in a vision
more than two year ago and in that vision wa told that there he would
find the wife who wa taken from him on hi marriag dai
now on hear thi most of the boer broke out laugh for
though veri religi we ar not a peopl who place faith in vision
thereupon i grew angri and spoke to them more strongli perhap than i
should have done reduc them to silenc for thei were all of them a
littl afraid of my tongu also i told them the stori of that dream of
ralph and of what had just pass with gaasha show them that there
wa more in it than thei imagin after i had done ralph spoke also
sai
friend doubtless thi tale sound foolish in your ear but i
ask what ha been my nicknam among you ha it not been man of the
mountain becaus i have alwai spoken and inquir for a certain
mountain which had ridg on it shape like the finger of a man hand
and have you not thought me mad for thi reason now i have heard of
such a mountain and i have heard also that sihamba who wa with my
wife rule there as chieftai is it strang therefor that i
believ now as ever in that vision should wish to visit thi mountain
where as i am sure i shall find the wife that is lost to me
after thi the boer laugh no more but consult apart till at last
the elder heer cellier spoke
heeren botmar and kenzi he said of all thi stori of a vision we
can sai littl for aught we know it mai be true but if true then it
is the work of magic and we will have noth to do with it should you
wish to go to seek thi mountain umpondwana you must go alon for we
cannot alter our plan to trek there with you but we counsel you not to
go sinc no good can come of vision and magic
when i heard thi i answer him back but jan and ralph went awai and
present i found them talk togeth outsid the laager
let me go alon ralph wa sai
nai jan answer i will accompani you for two ar better than
on also i shall not sleep till i find out the truth and know whether
suzann live or is dead
inde and what is to becom of me i ask
you vrouw can stop with the neighbour here and we will join you in
natal
you will do no such thing jan botmar i answer for where you two
go there i can go what am i not sick also with love for my daughter
and anxiou to learn her fate
as you will wife answer jan perhap it is well that we three
should not separ who have been togeth alwai and he went to see
about the waggon
as soon as the moon rose which wa about eleven oclock the oxen
were inspan befor we start howev sever of our friend
came prai us not to ventur on so peril a journei inde thei
threaten even to us forc to prevent us and i think would have done
so had not jan told them outright that we were our own master and free
to go where we wish so thei depart griev over our obstinaci
and littl guess that their danger wa far greater than our own
sinc as it chanc just as thei had trek through the van reenen
pass a few dai later a zulu impi return from the weenen massacr
fell upon them unawar and kill more than half their number befor
thei were beaten off
so we trek with the moon gaasha guid us and did not outspan
till dawn as i have said we had no hors but never until i made that
journei did it come home to me how slow ar oxen for never befor then
wa i in a hurri nor inde have i been sinc that time it is the
englishmen who ar alwai in a hurri and that is on of the reason why
we boer ar so superior to them and when we choos can master them in
everyth except shopkeep and especi in fight well at the
best the cattl could not drag the waggon over the roadless veldt at a
greater rate than two mile an hour or cover more than twenti mile a
dai in all it wa piti to see ralph impati again and again he
walk on and return inde had we allow it i think that he would
have press forward on foot leav us to follow in the waggon
at daylight on the third dai we inspan as usual and trek through
the morn mist until the sun suck them up then gaasha who wa
sit on the waggonbox besid ralph touch hi shoulder and
point befor him ralph look and far awai upon the plain saw what
seem to be a white cloud abov which tower the flat cliff of a
mountain of red rock
see baa he said yonder is umpondwana my home and now by
nightfal i shall know whether my parent ar still aliv or if thei
ar dead whether thei have left ani cattl that i can claim by law
and he began to whistl cheerfulli
and i said ralph aloud shall know whether my life is to be a heaven
or a hell and all dai long neither eat nor drink he sat upon
the waggonbox and stare at the mountain not lift hi ey from it
it wa about on oclock in the afternoon when we seem to be quit
close to the green flank of umpondwana that of a sudden we cut a wide
spoor trampl by thousand of nake feet jan and gaasha got off the
waggon to examin it but ralph did not move
an impi ha pass here said jan present
ye and a zulu impi as i think baa but more than on whole dai
ago and gaasha began to hunt about amongst some low bush which grew
near the trail present he held up hi hand and shout and jan ran
to him
look baa he said point to a bush
jan look and there beneath the bush lai a man a zulu soldier for
hi tall grei plume wa still fix upon hi head and near him wa hi
broad assegai at that moment the man who wa still aliv although he
wa veri near hi death from dysentri seem to hear for he sat up
and open hi ey sai manzi umlungho manzi water white
man water
bring a pannikin of water here li a sick kaffir shout jan to
ralph who wa still seat on the waggonbox stare at the mountain
ralph brought the water and the soldier drank it greedili
who ar you and how come you here ask jan
i am a soldier of dingaan answer the man but when we were
attack the littl peopl on that mountain i fell sick still i came
awai with the impi but here my strength fail me and here i have lain
for a round of the sun and a round of the moon i beg them to kill
me but my brother would not for thei said that i might recov and
join them
where have thei gone ask jan
thei have gone to eat up the boer in natal the zulu answer in
a hollow voic hi empti ey wander toward the mountain of the
quathlamba rang ye thei have gone to do the king bid on the
white men for hi word came to us while we besieg yonder stronghold
tomorrow at the dawn thei attack the littl laager beneath the white
koppi by the bank of the tugela and i must reach them by theny
ye now i am strong again and i shall attack with them tomorrow at
the dawn farewel white men i will not kill you becaus you gave me
the water which ha made me strong again and rise from the ground
he grasp hi spear and start forward at a run
stai cri ralph i would question you as to what ha happen on
that mountain but the man did not seem to hear him for thirti pace
or so he ran on then suddenli he halt and salut with hi spear
cry in a loud voic
chief i report myself i am present
next he stretch hi arm wide and fell forward upon hi face when
thei reach him he wa quit dead
thi is a strang stori that we have heard about the zulu and the folk
in natal said jan rub hi forehead
i think that the man wa wander in hi mind answer ralph still
there mai be truth in it but father he ad with a gasp of
fear and catch jan by the arm what ha happen on the mountain
umpondwana the zulu have been there andwhat ha happen on the
mountain
jan shook hi head but did not answer for he knew too well what
happen where the zulu impi pass
notwithstand that ralph wa mad with impati we halt the waggon
for a few minut to take counsel and in the end decid to send the
voorloop back to the camp which we had left to warn our friend of
what we had learn as to the onslaught on our brethren in natal though
we had small faith in the stori but either the lad ran awai or some
accid befel him or he fail to find the boer who had alreadi
trek at the least our messag never reach them nor did we see him
again then we went on gaasha lead the oxen as quickli as thei could
walk all that afternoon we travel almost in silenc follow the
spoor of the impi backward for our heart were full of fear we met no
man but onc or twice we saw group of cattl wander unherd
and thi astonish us give us hope for it wa not the custom of a
victori impi to leav the cattl of it enemi behind it though
if the peopl of the umpondwana had conquer it wa strang that we
should see no herd with the beast
at length within two hour of sunset we pass round the shoulder of
the mountain and beheld it eastern slope
it is the veri place of my vision cri ralph and certainli there
befor us were the stone ridg shape like the thumb and finger of a
man while between the thumb and first finger gush the river upon the
bank of which grew flattop greenleav tree
onward onward he cri again and take the long waggon whip he
thrash the oxen till thei bellow in the yoke but i who wa seat
beneath the tent of the waggon turn to look behind me and in the
far distanc saw that men were drive herd of cattl toward the
mountain
we ar too late i thought in my heart for without doubt whether
it be the zulu or other the place ha been taken sinc yonder go the
victor with the cattl now thei will fall upon us and kill us well
should god will it so let it be for if suzann is dead inde i care
littl if we die also and to ralph at least death will be welcom for
i think that then death alon can save him from mad
now we had reach the bank of the river and were trek up
them toward the spot where it issu from the side of the mountain
everywher wa spoor but we saw no peopl although here and there
the vultur were hiss and quarrel over the bone of a man or a
beast
there ha been war in thi place whisper jan and now the peac of
death ha fallen upon it but ralph onli flog the weari oxen sai
noth
at length thei could drag the waggon no further for the path grew too
steep for them whereupon ralph seiz the first weapon that came to
hand which as it chanc wa the broad assegai that gaasha had
taken that dai from the side of the dead zulu ran forward up the trail
follow by jan and myself anoth two hundr yard and the path took
a turn which led to the entranc of the first scherm the same that the
zulu had captur by forc the passag of the river the gatewai wa
open now and ralph enter
at first he could see no on but present he heard a voic sai
will you not tell for death is veri near you drink witch tell and
drink
fool answer anoth voic a grate broken voic i sai that
death is near to both of us and sinc she is save i die gladli take
my secret with me
then witch i will try steel said the first voic
now ralph look over the rock from behind which the sound of voic
came and saw the bodi of a littl woman ti to a stone by the edg of
the water while over her leant a man a white man hold a knife in
on hand and in the other a gourd of water which he now place close
to her lip and now withdrew from them he knew that woman it wa
sihamba just at thi moment the man look up and their ey met and
ralph knew him also
it wa piet van vooren
chapter xxxiv
the aveng of blood
for a moment the two men stood look at each other ye the shedder
of blood and the aveng of blood stood quit still and silent and
look each other in the ey as though a spell had fallen upon them
strike them into stone it wa the voic of sihamba that broke the
spell and it issu from her parch throat with a sound like the sound
of a deathrattl
ah devil and tortur it said did i not tell you that doom wa at
hand welcom ralph kenzi husband of swallow
then with a roar like that of a wound beast ralph sprang forward in
hi hand the uplift spear for on instant swart piet hesit but
at the word of sihamba a sudden terror had taken hold of him and he
dare not wait like a startl buck he turn and fled up the mountain
but as he pass her he struck downward with the knife he held
stab sihamba in the bodi
onc also he look round for help but there wa none for dure
the long torment of sihamba all the black villain who serv him had
slip awai fear lest other should secur their share of the
stolen cattl then he sped on up the pass and never did a man run
more swiftli but after him came on who wa swifter than he the
lightfoot longlimb englishman with rage in hi heart and an
aw fire of vengeanc blaze in hi ey
up the pass thei ran leap over stone and dead cattl till at length
thei reach the tableland at the top here onc again van vooren paus
for an instant for he bethought him that perhap he might hold the
mouth of the cleft against hi pursuer but hi wick heart wa too
full of fear to let him stai so at full speed he set forward across the
plain head for that chair rock where still sat the whiten corps
for there he thought he could defend himself ralph follow him
somewhat more slowli for of a sudden he had grown cold and cun
and know that hi foe could not escap him he desir to save hi
breath for the last struggl
for six hundr yard or more thei ran thu and when van vooren
began to climb the pedest of rock ralph wa fifti pace behind him
present he also reach the pedest and paus to look alreadi swart
piet wa stand by the stone chair but it wa not at him that he
look but rather at the figur which wa ti in the chair that he now
saw for the first time that figur no longer sat upright drape in it
white fur cloak for it had been disturb as i shall tell present
and the cloak wa half torn from it now it hung over the arm of the
chair the ghastli white face look down toward ralph and beneath it
the bare black breast
ralph stare wonder what thi might mean then the answer to the
riddl flash into hi mind and he laugh aloud for here he saw
the handiwork of sihamba ye that grisli shape told him that hi love
still live and that it wa to win the secret of her whereabout that
the devil abov him had practis torment upon the littl doctoress
ralph laugh aloud and began to climb the pinnacl he might have
wait till jan who wa struggl up the pass after them arriv with
hi gun but he would not wait he had no fear of the man abov and he
wa certain of the issu of the frai for he knew that god is just as
for that man abov he grin and gibber in hi disappoint rage and
the agoni of hi dread ye he stood there by the paint corps and
gibber like an ap
your evil do ha not prosper over much piet van vooren call
ralph and present when you ar dead you will tast the fruit of it
suzann shall be mine till the end as she wa mine from the begin
but look upon the deathwif that your wicked ha won and he
point at the bodi with hi spear
black piet made no answer nor did ralph speak ani more for he must set
himself to finish hi task the boer took a heavi stone and threw it
at him but it miss him and he could find no more then grip the
wrist of the corps in hi left hand to steadi himself upon that giddi
place he leant forward and prepar to stab ralph with the knife as
he set foot upon the platform ralph saw hi plan and stop in hi
climb he took off hi coat and wound it round hi left arm as a shield
then he came on slowli hold the broad spear in front of him at the
last he made a rush and reach the flat space of rock piet stab
at him but the strength of the thrust lost itself in the fold of the
coat
now who can sai what happen round and round the rock chair thei
swung van vooren still hold fast to the arm of the dead woman who
wa lash in it ye even from where i stood five hundr feet below i
could see the flash of spear and knife as thei struck and struck again
at length a blow went home the zulu assegai sank deep into van vooren
chest and he hung backward over the edg of the abyss support onli
by hi grip of the dead armfrom below it look as though he were
draw the corps to him against it will ye he hung back and
groan aloud ralph look at him and laugh again sinc though he
wa gentleheart for thi man he had no piti he laugh and cry
that curs of god you mock at fall at last with a sudden stroke he
drew the sharp edg of the spear across the lash that held the bodi
to the seat
the rimpi part and with a swift and aw rush like that of a
swoop bird the dead woman and the live man plung headlong into
space on dread yell echo down the pitiless precipic follow
present by a soft thud sound and there lodg upon a flat rock
hundr of feet beneath lai what had been piet van vooren though
inde none could have told that it wa he
thu end the life of thi man thi servant of the devil upon earth
and even now after all these year i can find but on excus for him
that the excess of hi own wicked had made him drunk and mad ye
i believ that he who wa alwai near to it went quit mad when ralph
struck him with the whip after the fight by the sheep kraal mad with
hate of ralph and love of suzann also hi father wa wick befor
him and he had kaffir blood in hi vein ah for how much must our
blood be call upon to answer and how good is that man who can conquer
the natur prompt of hi blood
jan and i were follow ralph when he enter the river scherm and
reach it just in time to see pursu and pursuer vanish up the
narrow cleft i caught sight of van vooren back onli but although i
had not seen him for year i knew it at onc
we have found the tiger at home i said yonder goe swart piet
allemacht it is so answer jan look there li the tiger
prei and point to sihamba he follow them up the mountain side as
fast as hi weight would allow for in those dai jan wa a veri heavi
man
meanwhil i made my wai to the littl figur that wa stretch upon
the rock at the edg of the river she had faint but even befor i
reach her i saw from her small size and the strang hoop of stiff
hair that she wore about her head that it wa none other than sihamba
sihamba whom i had last seen upon the ev of that unlucki marriag dai
but oh she wa sadli chang on of her leg i forget which had been
broken by a gunshot the blood trickl from the wound where van vooren
had stab her in the back her littl bodi wa wast by the want of
water and her face had shrunk to the size of that of a small child
although strang enough it still wa pretti i knelt down by her
and place my hand upon her heart felt that it still beat though veri
slowli then i took water and sprinkl it upon her and at the touch of
it she open her ey at onc
give me to drink she moan and i did so pour the water down her
throat which wa ridg and black like a dog palat her ey open
and she knew me
greet mother of swallow she said you come in a good hour for
now i shall be abl to tell you all befor i die and i am glad that i
wa strong enough to endur the torment of thirst for so mani hour
tell me on thing sihamba i said doe suzann live and is she
safe
ye she live and i hope that thi night she will be safe with your
own peopl the boer for she ha cross the mountain to seek shelter
in that laager which is by the whitetop koppi near the bank of the
tugela in natal
the laager by the whitetop koppi i gasp oh my god that
must be the camp which the zulu attack tomorrow at the dawn
what do you sai sihamba ask
in a few word i told her the tale that we had heard from the dy
soldier and she listen eagerli
i fear it must be true she said when i had finish for while he
wa torment me bullhead let it fall that dingaan regiment had
gone henc by order of the king to make war upon the boer in natal but
i took littl heed think that he li

orstai in the glade yonder is the great schimmel hors bullhead
peopl brought him down for him and i know that hour ago he ha been
well fed and water if her husband mount him at sunset he can be
with the swallow in the laager well befor the dawn in time to warn
them all present when he return from kill bullhead i will show
him the road for i shall live till sunset give me more water i prai
you
now i saw that noth could be done till ralph and jan return if
thei ever should return so i prai of sihamba to tell me what had
pass for i saw that she could not live long and desir to know the
truth befor she di and she told me with mani rest and at no great
length inde but veri clearli and as i listen i marvel more and
more at thi kaffir woman love faith and courag at last she
came to the tale of how she had disguis suzann and set up the corps
in her place in the chair of rock
step but a few pace there to the right she said and you will see
it
i did as she bade me and then it wa that on look upward i saw
ralph and swart piet struggl togeth thei were so high abov me
that their shape seem small but i could see the light flash from
the stab steel and i call out to sihamba what i saw
have no fear ladi she answer it will onli end on wai so
inde it did as ha been told for present van vooren and the corps
rush downward to vanish in the abyss while ralph remain stand
by the empti chair of stone
it is finish i said return to sihamba
i know it ladi she answer bullhead last cry reach my ear
and do you give thank to the spirit you worship that he is dead you
wish to know what happen after the swallow and i part well i
went and stood by the bodi on the pinnacl of rock and there as i
expect came bullhead to seek hi captiv he command us to come
down but i refus tell him that if he attempt to take the
swallowfor he thought that the bodi wrap in the white cloak wa
shesh would certainli escap him by hurl herself from the cliff
thu i gain much time for now from my height i could see her whom
i knew to be the ladi swallow travel across the plain toward the
sawedg rock although i wa puzzl becaus she seem to carri a
child upon her back but perhap it wa a bundl
at last he grew impati and without warn lift hi gun and
fire at me aim low for he fear lest the ball should pierc my
mistress the shot struck my leg where you see and be unabl to stop
myself although i broke my fall by clutch with my hand i roll
down the rock to the ground beneath but not over the edg of the
precipic as i could have wish to do for at the last i had intend
to escap him by throw myself from it
leav me unabl to move he began to ascend the pinnacl call
your daughter swallow by sweet name as a man call a shy hors which
he fear will escap him i watch from below and even in my pain
i laugh for now i knew what must come sinc the swallow did not
answer bullhead wish to be cun crept behind her in silenc
and of a sudden seiz the cloak and the arm beneath it for he fear
lest she should choos death and cheat him
then it wa that the bodi roll over toward him then it wa that he
saw the whiten face and the black breast beneath ah ladi you should
have heard hi oath and hi yell of rage as he scrambl down the rock
toward me
what think you of your bride i ask him as he came for i knew that
i must die and did not care how soon
thi is your trick witch he gasp and now i will kill you

slowli then he call some of hi men and thei carri me in a kaross
to thi place here by the river he lash me to the stone and know
that alreadi from loss of blood and lack of drink i wa in the agoni
of thirst he torment me by hold water to my lip and snatch it
awai
all dai long ly in the burn sun have i suffer thu wait
for death to heal my pain but in vain did he tortur and question for
not on word could he wring from my lip as to where he should seek
for the ladi swallow he thought that she wa hidden somewher on the
mountain and sent men to search for her till thei grew tire and ran
awai to steal the cattl he never guess that disguis as a black
woman she had pass beneath hi veri ey
yet thi wa so for i sihamba know it from the talk i overheard
between bullhead and on of hi servant who had held her awhil
wish to take her for a wife ye she pass beneath hi ey and
escap him and ii have won the game
in after dai when there wa talk far and wide of the
wonder escap of my daughter suzann disguis as a
kaffir woman the man who had sought to take her captiv
told the stori of the white mark which hi grip left upon
her arm he said inde that both he and bullhead saw the
mark when she wa at a littl distanc from them but
believ it to be an ivori ring thei took no heed
now the effect of the water which for a littl while had given new
life to sihamba began to pass off and she grew weak and silent
present i saw ralph return down the steep cleft and with him jan
and went to meet them
it is finish ralph said look at me with quiet ey
i know it i answer but son there is still work to do if you
want to save your wife and i told him what i had learn

schimmel and he turn to seek him
no no i said let jan fetch the hors come you to sihamba that

now jan went to the glade that i point out to find the schimmel
while i led ralph to sihamba she heard him come and open her ey
welcom husband of swallow she said you have done well and
brave yet it wa the hand of fate and not your that smote yonder
on the rock point now hearken and she told the road which he must
follow across the quathlamba if he would hope to reach the white koppi
camp by dawn
befor she had done for the dy sihamba spoke slowli and with pain
jan came lead the schimmel saddl and bridl for swart piet
saddl had been put upon it the mare he wa ride have been taken by
on of hi men whom he had sent to drive in the captur cattl
the great roan hors which i rejoic to see onc more wa somewhat
thin for he had lack water like the rest but throughout the sieg he
had been well tend by sihamba and zinti and fed with green corn and
sinc that morn he had drunk all he would so that now he wa strong
again and fit to run

brute which love her now as alwai had wind her and come to where
she lai put down hi head and fondl her with hi black lip catch

prophesi to them life and joi then he leapt into the saddl and
with a snort and a quick shake of it head the schimmel plung

with these word upon her lip sihamba ngenyanga di ye she and the

chapter xxxv
the schimmel last race
ralph clear the mountain slope but befor he had cover a mile of
wai the dark began to fall till present the night wa black now
he must ride slowli steer hi path by the star and search the
dim outlin of the mountain with hi ey
but search as he would ralph could not see the sawedg rock he
reach the rang inde and for hour after hour roam up and down it
hi heart torn with helpless hast and fear but it wa of no us so
at last he dismount and hold the schimmel by the bridl allow
him to eat a littl grass while he wait for the moon to rise oh
never wa the moon so long in come but at length it came and with
it clear soft light he look and there not half a mile awai just
show in the shadow wa the sawedg rock he sought
there is littl time to lose ralph mutter to himself as the
stallion swept across the plain toward the rock in three hour it
will be dawn and these mountain ar sheer and wide
now he wa in the pass and gallop up it rocki steep as fast as the
hors dare travel and not fall up he went through the moonlit silenc
that wa broken onli by the distant roar of lion up for on hour
and for two now he wa at the crest of the mountain and beneath
him mile awai lai the dim veldt and therey there in the far
distanceth moonbeam sparkl upon a whitetop koppi and the
water of a river that wash it base mile and mile awai and but
on hour left to cover them on short hour and if it wa not enough
then death by the zulu assegai would be the portion of suzann and of
those among whom she shelter for a moment ralph breath the hors
then he shook the rein and with a snort of pride the schimmel
start upon hi last gallop
ah what a ride wa that had ever man the like of it rush down
an untrodden mountain wai swifter than other dare travel on a plain
bound from rock to rock like a buck dash through stream and
leap dim gulli at a stride on on went the schimmel with never
a slip and never a stumbl on swifter than a sassabi and surerfoot
than a fox now the worst of the road wa pass and a long smooth
slope almost free from stone led them to the grassi plain beneath
the schimmel swept down it at a fear pace and reach the level
land in safeti but the strain of that mad gallop told it tale upon
him for he wa drench with sweat hi ey wa red with blood and the
breath whistl in hi throat
ralph rais himself in hi stirrup and scan the sky which began to
brighten with the come dawn
there is time he mutter for the koppi is near and the zulu
will not attack till thei can see the white moon upon their finger
nail
now he wa speed up a long rise for here the land li in wave
like a frozen sea he top it and in an instantalmost befor he saw
themh had swept through a zulu impi march stealthili in a tripl
line with compani thrown forward to the right and left thei shout
in astonish but befor thei could harm him or the hors he wa out
of reach of their spear and gallop forward with a glad heart for
now he thought the danger done with
down the slope he thunder and the sound of hi hors hoof came to
the ear of suzann who frozen with terror crouch in the grass near
the spring at the foot of it turn her ey from the ridg where
she had seen the zulu she look behind her at first she could
see noth except a great hors with a man upon it back but as she
stare present she recognis the horseit wa the schimmel and
none other
and the man whose shape wa that no thi on had a golden beard ah
he lift hi head from which the hat had fallen anddid she dream
nai by heaven it wa her husband grown older and beard but still
her husband in the pierc agoni of that happi she sank back
halffaint nor wa it till he wa almost upon her that she could
gain her feet he saw her and in the dim light mistak her for
a zulu soldier who waylaid him lift the gun in hi hand to fire
alreadi he wa press the trigger whenwhen she found her voic and
cri out
ralph ralph i am suzann your wife
as the word left her lip it seem to her as though some giant had
thrown the big hors back upon it haunch for he slip past
her hi flank almost touch the ground which he plough with
outstretch hoof then he stop dead
have i found you at last wife cri ralph in a voic of joi so
strang that it sound scarc human mount swiftli for the zulu
ar behind
thu then these two met again not on the mountain of the man hand
inde as the vision had foretold but veri near to it
nai suzann answer as she sprang on to the saddl befor him
thei ar in front for i saw them
ralph look ye there thei were in front and to the side and behind
all round them the zulu impi gather and thicken cry bulala
umlungu kill the white man as thei close in upon them at a run
oh ralph what can we do murmur suzann
charg them and trust to god he answer
so be it husband and turn herself upon the pommel of the
saddl she threw her arm round hi neck and kiss him on the lip
whisper at least we have met again and if we die it shall be
togeth
hold fast said ralph and call aloud to the hors he set hi teeth
and charg
by now the zulu in front were run down the oppos slope in
cluster not much more than a hundr yard awai inde the space
between them wa so narrow that the schimmel gallop up hill under
hi doubl load could scarc gather speed befor thei were among
them when thei were within ten yard ralph held out the gun in on
hand and fire it kill a man then he cast it awai as useless and
place hi right arm about the waist of suzann he bent hi bodi over
her to protect her if he might urg on the hors with feet and voic
now thei were in them and plough through their everthicken rank
throw their black bodi to thi side and to that as a ship throw
the water from it bow here there everywher spear flash and
stab but as yet thei were unhurt for the veri press save them
although an assegai wa quiver in the flank of the schimmel ah
a pang as of the touch of redhot iron and a spear had pierc ralph
left shoulder remain fast in the wound still lower he bent hi bodi
till hi head wa almost hidden in the flow mane of the schimmel
but now black clutch hand caught feet and bridl rein and slowli
the great hors lost wai and stop a tall zulu stab it in the
chest and ralph gasp it is over
but it wa not over for feel the pain of thi new wound of a
sudden the stallion went mad he shriek aloud as onli a hors can
shriek and lai back hi ear till hi face wa like the face of
a wolf he rear up on hi hind leg and struck out with hi hoof
crush the skull and bodi of hi tormentor down he came again
and with anoth scream rush openmouth at the man who had stab
him hi long white teeth grip him across the bodi where the rib
end and then the aw sight wa seen of a hors hold in hi mouth a
man who yell in agoni and plung forward with great bound while he
shook him to and fro as a dog will shake a rat
the reader mai think thi incid scarc credibl
but for an authent instanc of such behaviour on the
part of a hors he mai be refer to the memoir of
gener marbot
ye he shook and shook till the flesh gave and the man fell dy
on the veldt again the furiou beast open hi jaw from which gore
drip and rush upon anoth but thi on did not wait for himnon
wait to the zulu in those dai a hors wa a terribl wild beast
and thi wa a beast inde that brave as thei were thei dare not
face
it is a devil and wizard ride it thei cri as thei open a path
befor it rush
thei were through and behind them like the voic of hound that hunt
swell the cry of the wardog of dingaan thei were through and
live yet though on broad bangwan wa fast in ralph shoulder and
anoth stood in the schimmel chest
not two mile awai rose the koppi the hors will die thought ralph
as he drew suzann closer to him and grip the saddl with hi knee
inde he wa dy yet never sinc he wa a colt did the schimmel
cover two mile of plain so fast as those that lai between the impi and
the camp slowli and sure the spear work it wai into hi vital
but stretch out hi head and heedless of hi burden he rush on
with the speed of a racer
the boer in the laager were awak at last the sound of the gun and the
warcri of the zulu had reach them faintli halfclad men and women
togeth thei stood upon their waggonbox look toward the west
behind them the pencil of daylight were creep across the sky and
present in their low rai thei saw such a sight as thei would never
see again fast fast toward them thunder a great roan hors
blood drip from hi chest and jaw and flank and on it back a
yellowbeard man in whose shoulder stood a spear and who held in
front of him a faint woman
soon he will fall suddenli and we shall be crush thought ralph
and had the hors di while travel at that speed it must have been
so but he did not when within fifti yard of the laager suddenli
he began to lurch and roll in hi stride then with three bound he
stop and stand still look round with piteou bloodshot ey
and whinni faintli as though he heard some voic that he knew and
love
ralph slip from hi back drag suzann after him and watch
for a moment the schimmel stood hi head touch the ground till
present a bloodi foam came upon hi mouth and blood pour from hi
ey and ear now for the last time he arch hi neck and shook hi
mane then roar straight up on hi hind leg as he had done when he
beat down the zulu he paw the air with hi fore feet and fell over
upon hi back to move no more
suzann had faint and ralph carri her to the camp there thei drew
out the spear from hi shoulder and tend them both though beyond
gasp the word prepar for the zulu ar upon you it wa long
befor either of them could speak
ye ye thei beat off the impi with the loss of onli on man but
ralph took no part in that fight inde when we join them four dai
later for after buri sihamba jan and i trek round through the
waggon pass by the merci of heaven escap the zulu thei still lai
prostrat on a cartel clasp each other hand and smile but
speak littl the boer be warn and awak beat off the zulu
with great loss to dingaan for thei had the waggon in front the
koppi behind and the river to on side
but there were mani on that dread night whom no schimmel gallop
to warn ah god six hundr of them men and women maid and
children and littl babi at the breast went down beneath the zulu
assegai in that red dawn six hundr of them slaughter
is not the name of the land weenenth land of weepingto thi dai
we aveng them at the battl of the blood river inde but could
vengeanc give us back their live which it had pleas the lord to take
thu fearfulli
so so that is the end of my stori of the forgotten bygon year as i
old suzann botmar tell it the shadow of that whitetop koppi fall
upon thi hous and beneath my feet is the veri spot where the brave
schimmel di ralph and jan would not leav itno not even when the
british hoist their flag in natal make us english again after all
that we had undergon to escap their usurp rule we suffer much at
that event jan and i but though he said noth for inde he did
not dare to in my presenc i believ that ralph did not suffer at all
well he wa of english blood and it wa natur that he should like
hi own flag best though to thi dai i am veri angri with my daughter
suzann who for some reason or other would never sai a hard word of
the accurs british governmentor listen to on if she could help it
yet to be just that same govern ha rule us well and fairli
though i never could agre with their manner of deal with the
nativ and our famili ha grown rich under it shadow ye we were
rich from the begin for ralph and some boer fetch back the
cattl of suzann and sihamba which swart piet thiev had stolen and
thei were a veri great herd
for mani long and happi year after all these event that i have told
of did ralph and suzann live togeth till at last god took my child
suzann as she began to grow old from that dai life had no joi for
ralph or inde for ani of us and he fought with the english against
cetywayo at isandlhwana and fell there brave he and hi son
togeth for hi son wife an englishwoman of good blood wa dead
also in childbirth
then all the world grew dark for jan and me but now in my extrem ag
onc more it lighten like the dawn
o god who am i that i should complain nai nai to thee almighti god
be prais and thank and glori quit soon i must fall asleep and how
rich and plenti is that store which await me beyond my sleep that
store of friend and kindr who have pass me in the race and won the
immort crown of peac which even now their dear hand prepar for me
therefor to thee maker of the world be prais and thank and glori
ye let all thing prais thee as do my ag lip
note by the baro glenthirsk formerli known as suzann kenzi
it is someth over three year sinc my greatgrandmoth the vrouw
suzann botmar finish dictat to me thi histori of her earli dai
and of my grandpar ralph kenzi the english castawai and suzann
botmar her daughter now if it be onli as an instanc of the wonder
work of fate or as i prefer to call it of provid i add thi
note to her narr as i write there stretch befor me not the
bushi veldt of weenen in natal cut by the silver line of the tugela
but a vast prospect of heatherclad mountain about whose feet brawl
a salmon river for thi is scotland and i sit in the castl of
glenthirsk while on the terrac beneath my window pass my littl son
who if he live will on dai be lord of it but i will tell the stori
which is inde a strang on
as i think my greatgrandmoth ha said i wa educ at a school in
durban for although she wa in mani wai so prejud and narrow she
wish that i should be abl to hold my own with other girl in learn
as in all thing also she knew well that thi would have been the
desir of my dear father who wa kill in the zulu war with hi
father the ralph kenzi of the stori whom by the wai i can rememb
as a handsom greyhead man for my father wa a thorough englishman
with noth of the boer about him moreov he marri an english
ladi the daughter of a natal colonist and for these reason he and hi
grandmoth did not get on veri well
after i had finish my school i us to stai with friend in durban
the parent of on of my schoolfellow and it wa at their hous that
i met my husband mr ralph mackenzi who then wa call lord
glenthirsk hi father have di about six month previou to our
acquaint
ralph my husband wa then quit young onli threeandtwenti inde
and a subaltern in a scotch regiment which wa quarter at durban
whither it had come from india as the term of thi regiment foreign
servic wa shortli to expir and as at the time there wa a prospect
of further troubl in south africa my husband did not resign hi
commiss on succeed to the peerag as hi mother wish him to
do for he said that thi wa a step which he could consid when the
regiment return home as it would do shortli
well we met and sinc we ar now quit old marri peopl i mai as
well admit at onc that we fell in love with each other though to me it
seem a marvel thing that thi handsom and brilliant young lord
with hi great wealth and all the world befor him should come to care
for a simpl dutch girl who had littl to recommend her except her
look of which my greatgrandmoth thought or pretend to think so
littl and some small inherit of south african farm and cattl
inde when at last he propos to me beg me to be hi wife as
though i were the most preciou thing on the whole earth i told him
so plainli have inherit some sens with my strain of huguenot and
dutch blood and though i trembl at the risk i ran when everyth
lai in my own hand i refus to becom engag to him until he had
obtain the consent of hi mother and relat or at the least
until he had taken a year to think the matter over
the truth is that although i wa still so young i had seen and heard
enough of the misfortun of unsuit marriag nor could i bear that
it should ever be said of me that i had taken advantag of some pass
fanci to entangl a man so far abov me in wealth and station therefor
i would permit him to sai noth of our engag nor did i speak a
singl word of it to my greatgrandmoth or my friend still ralph and
i saw a great deal of each other dure the month which i remain in
durban for it is a gai town and almost everi dai there were parti
and when there were none we rode out togeth
it wa dure on of these ride on the berea that i told him what i
knew of the strang histori of my grandfath and grandmoth not all
of it inde for it wa not until the book wa dictat to me that i
learn the exact fact the matter be on of which our famili spoke
littl ralph listen veri attent and when i had done ask if i
had the ring and locket of which i spoke
here thei ar i answer for sinc my father death i had alwai
made a practic of wear both of them
he examin the ring with it worn devic and proud motto of honour
first and as he deciph it i saw him start but when he came to
look at the miniatur in the locket he turn quit pale
do you know suzann he said present i believ that we must be
distant cousin at the least i am sure that i have seen the pictur
from which on of these miniatur wa origin copi and the crest
and motto ar those of my famili
now i becam veri curiou and pli him with question but he would
sai no more onli he led me on to talk of my grandfath ralph kenzi
the castawai and from time to time made a note in hi pocketbook also
afterward i show him the write in the testament which wa found on
the bodi of the shipwreck ladi my greatgrandmoth and he ask me
for an impress of the ring and to allow the ivori miniatur and the
write to be photograph which i did
within three dai of that ride we separ for a while not without
heartach on both our part and some tear on mine for i fear that
onc he had lost sight of me he would put me from hi mind and as i
love him truli that thought wa sore but he speak veri quietli
said that outsid death onli on thing should divid us from each other
name my own decre
then ralph we shall be on for ever i answer for at the moment i
wa too sad for ani artific of maiden coy
you think so now dear he said but time will show suppos that i
were not and he stop nor would he complet the sentenc inde
those word of hi torment me dai and night for week for i finish
them in a hundr wai each more fatal than the last
well i return to the farm and immedi afterward my
greatgrandmoth took the fanci of dictat her histori the end
of which seem to affect her much for when it wa done she told me
sharpli to put the type sheet awai and let her hear or see no more of
them then she rose with difficulti for the dropsi in her limb made
her inact and walk with the help of a stick to the stoep
where she sat down look across the plain at the solemn rang of the
drakensberg and think without doubt of that night of fear when my
grandfath had rush down it steep upon the great schimmel to save
her daughter and hi wife from an aw death
the stead where we live in natal wa built under the lea of a
project spur of the whitetop koppi and over that spur run a
footpath lead to the township suddenli the old ladi look up and
not twenti yard awai from her saw stand on the ridg of it as
though in doubt which wai to turn a gentleman dress in the kilt
uniform of an offic of a highland regiment the like of which she had
never seen befor
dear lord i heard her exclaim here is a white man wear the
moocha of a kaffir suzann suzann come and send awai thi
halfclad fellow
put down my paper i ran from the room and at a singl glanc saw
that the halfclad fellow wa none other than ralph himself in
my delight i lost my head and forget everyth except that my
betroth wa there befor me i sprang from the stoep and fly up
the littl slope i fell into hi open arm for a few second there wa
silenc then from behind me rose a dread shriek follow by cri
for help free myself from ralph embrac i look round to see my
greatgrandmoth hobbl toward us with uplift stick ralph put hi
eyeglass in hi ey and look at her
who is thi old ladi suzann he ask
befor i could answer there came from her lip such a torrent of
indign as i had never heard befor
what is she sai ask ralph again who could not understand on
word of dutch she seem put out
it is my greatgrandmoth the vrouw botmar i falter and she
doe not understandi have never told her
ah i see well perhap it would be as well to explain he answer
which i accordingli began to do as best i could feel more foolish
than ever i did befor as i stammer out my excus i saw her face
chang and guess that she wa no longer listen to me
who doe the man remind me of she said speak aloud but to
herself allemacht hi face is the face of that english lord who
visit us with the lawyer more than fifti year ago ye hi face is
the face of ralph cousin girl she ad turn on me fierc
tell me that man name
hi name is lord glenthirsk
lord glenthirsk the same face and the same name and you in hi arm
is god then make a sequel to the stori which i finish thi dai
come and she hobbl back to the stoep be seat she said when
we had reach it now speak no suzann give me that kaross
i hand her the rug wonder what she meant to do with it and
disturb as i wa nearli burst into hyster when i saw her solemnli
place it upon ralph knee sai the man ha lost hi garment and
will catch a chill
would you kindli explain said ralph blandli what the old ladi is at
now realli i do not feel cold
your kilt surpris her i stammer whereat he began to laugh
silenc she exclaim in so vigor a voic that he stop at onc
now tell your stori no i forgot the man is not educ do you
interpret for him suzann
first i have someth to sai for myself grandmoth i answer and
in a few word i told that ralph and i were affianc though i had said
noth of it becaus i wish to give him opportun to chang hi
mind if he should desir to do so
chang hi mind said the old ladi with a glare of indign i
should like to see him dare to chang hi mind thi englishman whom
you seem to have honour thu opsit with him without my leav a
lord inde what do i care for lord the question is whether i should
not order the english creatur off the place ye and i would do it
were not hi face the face of ralph cousin and hi name the name
glenthirsk
when i had interpret as much of thi speech as i thought necessari
there wa a littl silenc after which ralph began to speak veri
solemnli
listen suzann he said and repeat my word to your
greatgrandmoth she sai that my name is lord glenthirsk but within
the last few dai i have come to believ that it is noth of the sort
but onli plain ralph mackenzi
what do you mean i ask astonish
i mean suzann that if your legitim descent from that ralph
mackenzi who wa cast awai about sixti year ago on the coast of the
transkei can be proveda i believ it can for i have made inquiri
and find that hi marriag to your grandmoth to which her mother who
still live can bear wit wa duli registeredthen you ar the
baro glenthirsk of glenthirsk and i the descend of a younger
son am onli lieuten ralph mackenzi of her majestyshighland
oh ralph how can thi be i gasp i thought that in england men
took rank not the women
so thei do gener he answer but as it happen in our famili
the titl descend in the femal line and with it the entail estat
so that you would succe to your father right although he never
enjoi them suzann i am not speak lightli all thi while that i
have kept awai from you i have been inquir in scotland and the cape
for i sent home photograph of those miniatur and a statement of the
fact and upon my word i believ it to be true that you and no other
ar the heiress of our hous
almost mechan for i wa lost in amaz i translat hi
word my greatgrandmoth thought a while and said
wonder ar the wai of the lord who thu in my old ag answer my
prayer and roll from my back the load of my sin suzann ask that
scotchman if he still mean to marri you and see me hesit as
well i might she struck her stick upon the floor and ad obei
girl and ask
so with great shame i ask explain that i wa forc to it
do i still mean to marri you suzann he said astonish why
sure you must understand that the question is do you still intend
to marri me when i beg you to take me some month ago i had much to
offer todai if thing be as i am sure thei ar i am but a penniless
scottish gentleman while you ar on of the richest and most nobl
ladi in great britain
by wai of answer i look at him in a fashion which i trust he
understood but befor i could speak vrouw botmar broke in for as
usual i had translat
tell the man to stop talk about monei and rank after hi godless
english manner i wish to inquir of hi charact and religion and so
she did clearli and at length but i do not think that i need set down
her question or hi answer
at last when we were both overwhelm and gasp for breath i refus
flatli to ask anyth more whereon she ceas her examin
sai
well if he speak the truth which is doubt he doe not seem to
be ani wors than other men though that is sai littl enough is he
sound in wind and limb and what ill ha he had
you must ask him yourself i repli lose patienc whereon she
call me a mealymouth littl fool and laugh then of a sudden
she said kneel both of you and strang as it mai seem we obei
her for we and especi ralph were afraid of the old ladi ye
there we knelt on the stoep befor her while a kaffir girl stood
outsid and stare with her mouth open
ralph kenzi she said whatev els you mai be at least you ar
an honest man like your grandfath befor you for were it not so
you would never have come to tell thi child that your fortun is her
fortun and your titl her titl though whether thi be the case or
not i neither know nor care sinc at least you ar of the blood of my
longdead adopt son and that is more to me than ani wealth or rank
as for you suzann you ar pert and deceit for you have kept
secret from me that which i had a right to learn also you have too good
an opinion of your own look which as i tell you now for the last
time ar noth compar to mine at your ag or even to those of my
daughter suzann your grandmoth but thi i will sai you have a good
heart and some of the spirit of your forbear thereforeand she
laid on of her heavi hand on the head of each of usi old suzann

and hobbl back to the sitkamm turn at the open door to call
out
girl where ar your manner make that scotchman some of your coffe
so we were marri and within the week for all my protest
notwithstand the vrouw botmar would suffer no delai moreov
by mean of some other interpret ralph plai traitor secretli
brought my argument to noth and inde there wa a caus for hurri
for just then hi regiment wa order to return to england
it wa a strang sight that marriag for my greatgrandmoth attend

oxen the descend of dingaan royal cattl that swart piet stole to
bring destruct upon the umpondwana by her side wa her husband old
jan botmar whom she caus to be carri to the waggon and ti in it
in hi chair he poor old man knew noth of what wa pass but
from some word he let fall we gather that he believ that he wa
onc more start on the great trek from the transkei my ralph
he thought wa hi adopt child perhap becaus of some inherit
similar of voic for he call him son but my own presenc
puzzl him for he said onc or twice so suzann ha escap from

thu we went to the littl church where the chaplain of the regiment

by a guard of honour form of everi avail soldier in the compani
outsid the open door of the church the waggon wa halt and from
it the vrouw botmar wit the ceremoni caus the regist to be
brought to her to sign thi she did rest the book upon the head of
the kaffir driver down whose back she manag to upset the ink
never mind she said not the least disturb it cannot make the
poor creatur ani blacker than he is

countri it wa prove that the rank and estat were mine by law for
the evid of my descent wa too strong to be disput i did not wish
to take either but ralph insist on it and i wa overrul inde

have result in the futur perhap after i am dead
