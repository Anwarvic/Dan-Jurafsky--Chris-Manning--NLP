author note
the author feel that he ow some apolog to hi reader for hi
bold in offer to them a modest stori which is in no sens a
romanc of the charact that perhap thei expect from him which ha
moreov few excit incid and no climax of the accustom order
sinc the end of it onli indic it real begin
hi excus must be that in the first instanc he wrote it pure to
pleas himself and now publish it in the hope that it mai pleas some
other the problem of such a conflict common enough mayhap did we
but know it between a depart and a present person of which
the battleground is a bereav human heart and the prize it complet
possess between earthli duti and spiritu desir also wa on that
had long attract him find at length a few month of leisur he
treat the difficult theme not inde as he would have wish to do
but as best he could
he mai explain further that when he draft thi book now some five
year ago instrument of the natur of the aerophon were not so much
talk of as thei ar todai in fact thi aerophon ha littl to
do with hi charact or their histori and the main motiv of it
introduct to hi page wa to suggest how powerless ar all such
materi mean to bring within mortal reach the transcendent and
unearthli end which with their aid were attempt by morri monk

chapter i
morri mari and the aerophon
abov the sky seem on vast arc of solemn blue set here and there
with point of tremul fire below to the shadowi horizon stretch
the plain of the soft grei sea while from the fragranc of night and
earth float a breath of sleep and flower
a man lean on the low wall that border the cliff edg and look
at sea beneath and sky abov then he contempl the horizon and
murmur some line heard or learnt in childhood end where earth and
heaven meet
but thei onli seem to meet he reflect to himself idli if i
sail to that spot thei would be as wide apart as ever ye the star
would be as silent and as far awai and the sea quit as restless and
as salt yet there must be a place where thei do meet no morri my
friend there is no such place in thi world materi or moral so
stick to fact and leav fanci alon
but that night thi specul man felt in the mood for fanci for
present he wa stare at on of the constel and sai to
himself why not well why not grant forc can travel through
etherwhatev ether iswhi should it stop travel give it time
enough a few second or a few minut or a few year and why should
it not reach that star veri like it doe onli there it wast
itself what would be need to make it servic simpli thisthat
on the star there should dwell an intellig arm with on of my
instrument when i have perfect them or the secret of them then
who know what might happen and he laugh a littl to himself at the
vagari
from all of which wander specul it mai be gather that morri
monk wa that rather common yet problemat person an inventor who
dream dream
an inventor in truth he wa although as yet he had never realli
invent anyth brought up as an electr engin after a veri
brief experi of hi profess he had fallen victim to an idea and
becom a physicist thi wa hi idea or the main point of itfor
it detail do not in the least concern our histori that by mean of
a certain machin which he had conceiv but not as yet perfect
it would be possibl to complet all exist system of aerial
commun and enorm to simplifi their action and enlarg their
scope hi instrument which were wireless telephonesaerophon he
call themwer to be made in pair twin that should talk onli
to each other thei requir no high pole or balloon or ani other
cumbrou and expens applianc inde their size wa no larger than
that of a rather thick despatch box and he had triumph the thing wa
donein all but on or two detail
for two long year he had struggl with these and still thei elud
him onc he had succeededthat wa the dread thing onc for a
while the instrument had work and with a space of sever mile
between them butthi wa the madden part of ith had never been
abl to repeat the exact condit or rather to discov precis
what thei were on that occas he had entrust on of hi machin to
hi first cousin mari porson a big girl with her hair still down her
back rather idl in disposit but veri intellig when she chose
mari for the most part had been brought up at her father hous
close by often too she stai with her uncl for week at a stretch
so at that time morri wa as intim with her as a man of eight and
twenti usual is with a rel in her teen
the arrang on thi particular occas wa that she should take the
machineor aerophon as it inventor had name itto her home the
next morn at the appoint hour as morri had often done befor he
tri to effect commun but without result on the follow dai
at the same hour he tri again when to hi astonish instantli
the answer came back ye as distinctli as though she were stand by
hi side he heard hi cousin mari voic
ar you there he said quit hopelessli mere as a matter of
formof veri common formand wellnigh fell to the ground when he
receiv the repli
ye ye but i have just been telegraph for to go to beaulieu my
mother is veri ill
what is the matter with her he ask and she repli
inflamm of the lungsbut i must stop i cant speak ani more
then came some sob and silenc
that same afternoon by mari direct the aerophon wa brought back
to him in a dogcart and three dai later he heard that her mother
mr porson wa dead
some month pass and when thei met again on her return from the
riviera morri found hi cousin chang she had part from him a
child and now beneath the shadow of the wing of grief suddenli
she had becom a woman moreov the best and frankest part of their
intimaci seem to have vanish there wa a veil between them mari
thought of littl and at thi time seem to care for no on except
her mother who wa dead and morri who had love the child recoil
somewhat from the newborn woman it mai be explain that he wa afraid
of women still with an ey to busi he spoke to her about the
aerophon and so far as her memori serv her she confirm all the
detail of their short convers across the gulf of empti space
you see he said trembl with excit i have got it at last
it look like it she answer wearili her thought alreadi far
awai why shouldnt you there ar so mani odd thing of the sort but
on can never be sure it mightnt work next time
will you try again he ask
if you like she answer but i dont believ i shall hear anyth
now somehowsinc that last businesseveryth seem differ to
me
dont be foolish he said you have noth to do with the hear
it is my new receiv
i daresai she repli but then why couldnt you make it work with
other peopl
morri answer noth he too wonder why
next morn thei made the experi it fail other experi
follow at interv most of which were fiasco although some were
partial success thu at time mari could hear what he said but
except for a word or two and now and then a sentenc he could not hear
her whom when she wa still a child and hi playmat onc he had heard
so clearli
why is it he said a year or two later dash hi fist upon the
tabl in impot rage it ha been why cant it be
mari turn her larg blue ey up to the ceil and reflect
rub her dimpl chin with a veri pretti finger
isnt that the kind of question thei us to ask oracl she ask
lazilyoh no it wa the oracl themselv that were so vagu well
i suppos becaus wa is as differ from is as as is from shall
be we ar chang cousin that all
he point to hi patent receiv and grew angri
oh it isnt the receiv she said smooth her curl hair it
us you dont understand me a bitnot nowand that why you cant
hear me take my advic morrisand she look at him sharplywhen
you find a woman whom you can hear on your patent receiv you had
better marri her it will be a good excus for keep her at a distanc
afterward
then he lost hi temper inde he rave and storm and nearli
smash the patent receiv in hi furi to a scientif man let it
be admit it wa noth short of madden to be told that the
success work of hi instrument to the manufactur of which he
had given eight year of toil and studi depend upon some preexist
sympathi between the oper of it divid halv if that were so
what wa the us of hi wonder discoveri for who could ensur a
sympathet correspond and yet the fact remain that when in
their playmat dai he understood hi cousin mari and when her quiet
indol natur had been deepli move by the shock of the new of her
mother peril the aerophon had work wherea now when she had
becom a grownup young ladi he did not understand her ani longerh
whose heart wa wrap up in hi experi and who by natur fear
the adult member of her sex and shrank from them when too her
placid calm wa no longer stir work it would not
she laugh at hi temper then grew seriou and said
dont get angri morri after all there ar lot of thing that you
and i cant understand and it isnt odd that you should have tumbl
across on of them if you think of it nobodi understand anyth
thei know that certain thing happen and how to make them happen but
thei dont know why thei happen or why as in your case when thei
ought to happen thei wont
it is all veri well for you to be philosoph he answer turn
upon her but cant you see mari that the thing there is my life
work it is what i have given all my strength and all my brain to make
and if it fail in the endwhi then i fail too onc and forev and
i have made it talk it talk perfectli between thi place and seaview
and now you stand there and tell me that it wont work ani more becaus
i dont understand you then what am i to do
try to understand me if you think it worth while which i dont or
go on experi she answer try to find some substanc which is
less exquisit sensit someth a littl grosser more in kei with
the materi world or to discov someon whom you do understand dont
lose heart dont be beaten after all these year
no he answer i dont unless i die and he turn to go
morri she said in a softer voic i am lazi i know perhap
that is why i ador peopl who can work so although you dont think
anyth of me i will do my honest best to get into sympathi with you

chapter ii
the colonel and some reflect
present morri heard a step upon the lawn and turn to see hi
father saunter toward him colonel monk cb wa an elderli man
over sixti inde but still of an upright and soldierli bear hi
record wa rather distinguish in hi youth he had serv in the
crimea and in due cours wa promot to the command of a regiment of
guard after thi certain diplomat abil caus him to be sent
to on of the foreign capit as militari attach and in reward of
thi servic on retir he wa creat a companion of the bath in
appear he wa handsom also in fact much better look than hi
son with hi irongrei hair hi clearcut featur somewhat mar
in effect by a certain shifti of the mouth and hi larg dark ey
morri had those dark ey alsothei redeem hi face from plain
for otherwis it show no beauti the featur be too irregular the
brow too promin and the mouth too larg yet it could boast what in
the case of a man at ani rate is better than beautyspiritu
and a certain sympathet charm it wa not the face which wa so
attract but rather the intellig the person that shone
through it as the light shine through the horn pane of some home
massiv lantern specul ey of the sort that seem to search
horizon and gather knowledg there but shrink from the face of women
a head of brown hair short cut but untidi an athlet manlik form to
which bizarr enough a slight stoop the stoop of a student seem
to give distinct and hand slender and shape as those of an
easternsuch were the characterist of morri monk or at least those
of them that the observ wa apt to notic
hullo morri ar you stargaz there said colonel monk with a
yawn i suppos that i must have fallen asleep after dinnerthat come
of stop too long at onc in the countri and drink port i notic
you never touch it and a good thing too there my cigar is out now
the time for that new electr lighter of your which i can never make
work
morri fumbl in hi pocket and produc the lighter then he said
i am sorri father but i believ i forgot to charg it
ah that just like you if you will forgiv my sai so you take
ani amount of troubl to invent and perfect a thing but when it come
to make us of it then you forget and with a littl gestur of
impati the colonel turn asid to light a match from a box which he
had found in the pocket of hi cape
i am sorri said morri with a sigh but i am afraid it is true
when on mind is veri fulli occupi with on thing and he broke
off
ah that it morri that it said the colonel seat himself
upon a garden chair thi hobbyhors of your is carri youto the
devil and your famili with you i dont want to be rough but it is
time that i spoke plain let see how long is it sinc you left the
london firm
nine year thi autumn answer morri set hi mouth a littl
for he knew what wa come the port drunk after claret had upset
hi father digest and ruffl hi temper thi meant that to
himmorrisf had appoint a lectur
nine year nine wast year idl and dreamt awai in a villag upon
the eastern coast it is a larg slice out of a man life my boi by
the time that i wa your ag i had done a good deal said hi father
medit when he meant to be disagre it wa the colonel
custom to becom reflect
i cant admit that answer morri in hi light quick voicei
mean i cant admit that my time ha either been idl awai or wast on
the contrari father i have work veri hard as i did at colleg
and as i have alwai done with result which without boast i mai
fairli call gloriousy gloriousfor when thei ar perfect thei
will chang the method of commun throughout the whole world
as he spoke forget the sharp vexat of the moment hi face wa
irradi with lightlik some even cloud on which the sun strike
suddenli
watch him out of the corner of hi ey even in that low moonlight
hi father saw those fire of enthusiasm shine and die upon hi son
face and the sight vex him enthusiasm as he conceiv perhap with
justic had been the ruin of morri ceas to be reflect hi tone
becam cruel
do you realli think morri that the world wish to have it method
of commun revolutionis arent there enough telephon and
phonogram and aerial telegraph alreadi it seem to me that you mere
wish to add a new terror to exist howev there is no need to
pursu an academ discuss sinc thi wretch machin of your
on which you have wast so much time appear to be a miser
failur
now to throw the nonsuccess of hi invent into the teeth of the
inventor especi when that inventor know that it is success
realli although just at present it doe not happen to work is a veri
deadli insult few inde could be deadlier except perhap that of
the cruelti which can suggest to a woman that no man will ever look at
her becaus of her plain and lack of attract or the coars
taunt which by shameless implic unjustli accus the soldier of
cowardic the diplomat of have betrai the secret of hi countri
or the lawyer of have sold hi brief all the more therefor wa it
to morriss credit that he felt the lash sting without a show of temper
i have tri to explain to you father he began struggl to free
hi clear voic from the note of indign
of cours you have morri dont troubl yourself to repeat that long
stori but even if you were successfulwhich you ar noteri cannot
see the commerci us of thi invent as a scientif toi it mai be
veri well though person i should prefer to leav it alon sinc
if you go fire off your thought and word into space how do you know
who will answer them or who will hear them
well father as you understand all about it it is no us my
explain ani further it is pretti late i think i will be turn
in
i had hope repli the colonel in an aggriev voic that you
might have been abl to spare me a few minut convers for some
week i have been seek an opportun to talk to you but somehow
your arduou occup never seem to leav you free for ordinari
social intercours
certainli repli morri though i dont quit know why you should
sai that i am alwai about the place if you want me but in hi heart
he groan guess what wa come
ye but you ar ever work at your chemic and machineri in the
old chapel or read those etern book or wander about rapt
in contempl of the heaven so that in short i seldom like to
troubl you with my mundan but necessari affair
morri made no answer he wa a veri duti son and humblespirit
those who pit their intellig against the forc of natur and
try to search out her secret becom humbl he could not altogeth
respect hi father the gulf between them wa too wide and deep but
even at hi present ag of three and thirti he consid it a duti to
submit himself to him and hi vagari outsid of other reason hi
mother had prai him to do so almost with her last breath and live
or dead morri love hi mother
perhap you ar not awar went on colonel monk after a solemn paus
that the affair of thi properti ar approach a crisi
i know someth but no detail answer morri i have not like
to interfer he ad apologet
and i have not not like to troubl you with such sordid matter
rejoin hi parent with sarcasm i presum howev that you ar
acquaint with the main fact i succeed to thi estat encumb
with a mortgag creat by your grandfath an extravag and
unbusinesslik man that mortgag i look to your mother fortun
to pai off but other call made thi imposs for instanc the
seawal here had to be built if the abbei wa to be save and half a
mile of seawal cost someth also veri extens repair to the
hous were necessari and i wa forc to take three farm in hand when
i retir from the armi fifteen year ago thi ha involv a net loss
of about ten thousand pound while all the time the interest had to be
paid and the place kept up in a humbl fashion
i thought that my uncl porson took over the mortgag after my mother
death interrupt morri
that is so answer hi father winc a littl but a creditor
remain a creditor even if he happen to be a rel by marriag i
have noth to sai against your uncl john who is an excel
person in hi wai and wellmean of cours he ha been justifi
perfectli justifi in us hi busi abilitiesor perhap i
should sai instinct for thei ar hereditaryto hi own advantag
in fact howev directli or indirectli he ha done well out of thi
properti and hi connect with our familyexceedingli well both
financi and social in a time of stress i wa forc to sell him
the two mile of seafrontag buildingland between here and northwold
for a mere song dure the last ten year as you know he ha cut thi
up into over five hundr villa site which he ha sold upon long leas
at groundrent that todai bring in annual as much as he paid for the
whole properti
ye father but you might have done the same he advis you to befor
he bought the land
perhap i might but i am not a tradesman i do not understand these
affair and morri i must remind you that in such matter i have had
no assist i do not blame you ani more than i blame myselfit is
not in your line eitherbut i repeat that i have had no assist
morri did not argu the point well father he ask what is the
upshot ar we ruin
ruin that is a larg word and an ugli on no we ar no more
ruin than we have been for the last halfdozen year for thank
heaven i still have resourc andfriend but of cours thi place
is in a wai expens and you yourself would be the last to pretend
that our burden have been lessen byyour have abandon the
veri strang profess which you select and devot yourself to
research which if interest must be call abstract
forgiv me father interrupt morri with a ring of indign
in hi voic but you must rememb that i put you to no expens in
addit to what i inherit from my mother which of cours under
the circumst i do not ask for i have my fellowship out of which
i contribut someth toward the cost of my live and experi
that by the wai i keep as low as possibl
of cours of cours said the colonel who did not wish to pursu
thi branch of the subject but hi son went on
you know also that it wa at your express wish that i came to live here
at monksland as for the purpos of my work it would have suit me
much better to take room in london or some other scientif centr
realli my dear boi you should control yourself broke in hi father
that is alwai the wai with reclus thei cannot bear the slightest
critic of cours as you were go to devot yourself to thi line
of research it wa right and proper that we should live togeth sure
you would not wish at my ag that i should be depriv of the comfort of
the societi of an onli child especi now that your mother ha left
us
certainli not father answer morri soften as wa hi fashion
at the thought of hi dead mother
then came a paus and he hope that the convers wa at end a vain
hope as it prove
my real object in troubl you morri continu hi father
present wa veri differ to the unnecessari discuss into which
we have drift
hi son look up but said noth again he knew what wa come and
it wa wors than anyth that had gone befor
thi place seem veri solitari with the two of us live in it
great room i who am get an old fellow and you a student and a
recluseno dont deni it for nowadai i can bare persuad you to
attend even the bench or a lawntenni parti well fortun we
have power to add to our number or at least you have i wish you would
marri morri
hi son turn sharpli and answer
thank you father but i have no fanci that wai
now there jane rose or that handsom eliza layard went on the
colonel take no notic i have reason to know that you might have
either of them for the ask and thei ar both good women without
a breath against them and what in the state of thi properti is not
without import veri well to do jane get fifti thousand pound
down on the dai of her marriag and as much more togeth with the
place upon old ladi rose death while miss layardif she is not
quit to the manner bornha the interest in that great collieri and a
rather sickli brother lastlyand thi is strang enough consid
how you treat themthei admir you or at least eliza doe for she
told me she thought you the most interest man she had ever met
did she inde ejacul morri why i have onli spoken three
time to her dure the last year
no doubt my dear boi that is why she think you interest to her
you ar a mine of splendid possibl but i understand that you
dont like either of them
no not particularlyespeci eliza layard who isnt a ladi and
ha a viciou tempernor ani young woman whom i have ever met
do you mean to tell me candidli morri that at your ag you detest
women
i dont sai that i onli sai that i never met on to whom i felt much
attract and that i have met a great mani by whom i wa repel
decidedli morri in you the strain of the ancestr fish is too
predomin it isnt natur it realli isnt you ought to have been
born three centuri ago when the old monk live here you would have
made a firstclass abbot and might have been canonis by now am i to
understand then that you absolut declin to marri
no father i dont want you to understand anyth of the sort if i
could meet a ladi whom i like and who wouldnt expect too much and
who wa foolish enough to wish to take me of cours i should marri her
as you ar so bent upon it
well morri and what sort of a woman would fulfil the condit to
your notion
hi son look about him vagu as though he expect to find hi
ideal in some nook of the dim garden
what sort of a woman well somebodi like my cousin mari i supposean
easygo person of that kind who alwai look pleasant and cool
morri did not see him for he had turn hi head awai but at the
mention of mari porson name hi father start as though someon had
prick him with a pin but colonel monk had not command a regiment
with some success and been a militari attach for noth have fill
diplomat posit public and privat in hi time he could keep
hi counten and plai hi part when he chose inde did hi
simplermind son but know it all that even he had been plai a
part
oh that your style is it he said well at your ag i should
have prefer someth a littl differ but there is no account
for tast and after all mari is a beauti woman and clever in
her own wai by jove there on oclock strike and i promis old
charter that i would alwai be in bed by halfpast eleven good night
my boi by the wai you rememb that your uncl porson is come to
seaview tomorrow from london and that we ar engag to dine with him
at eight fanci a man who could build that pretenti monstros and
call it seaview well it will condemn him to the seventh gener
but in thi world on must take peopl as on find them and their
hous too mind you lock the garden door when you come in good
night
realli thought colonel monk to himself as he took off hi dresssho
and with militari precis set them side by side beneath a chair it
doe seem a littl hard on me that i should be respons for a son who
is in love with a damn unwork electr machin and with hi
chanceswith hi chanc why he might have been a second secretari in
the diplomat servic by now or anyth els to which interest could
help him and there he sit hour after hour gabbl down a littl
trumpet and listen for an answer which never comeshour after hour
and month after month and year after year is he a geniu or is he an
idiot or a moral curios or simpli useless im hang if i know
but that a good idea about mari though of cours there ar thing
against it curiou that i should never have consid the matter
serious beforebecaus of the cousinship i suppos would she have
him it doesnt seem like but you can never know what a woman will or
will not do and as a child she wa veri fond of morri at ani rate the
situat is desper and if i can i mean to save the old place for
hi sake and our famili as well as my own
he went to the window and lift a corner of the blind look out
there he is still stare at the sea and the sky and there i daresai
he will be till dawn i bet he ha forgotten all about mari now and is
think of hi electr machin what a curios good heaven what
a curios ah i wonder what thei would have made of him in my old
mess five and thirti year ago and quit overcom by thi reflect
the colonel shook hi grizzl head put out the candl and retir to
rest
hi father wa right the beauti septemb dawn wa break over the
placid sea befor morri brush the night dew from hi hair and cloak
and went in by the abbot door
what wa he think of all the time he scarc knew on by on
like littl cloud in the summer sky fanci aros in hi mind to sail
slowli across it depth and vanish upon an inconclus and shadowi
horizon of cours he thought about hi instrument these were never
absent from hi heart hi instinct flew back to them as an oasi as an
island of rest in the wilder of thi father thorni and depress
convers the instrument were disappoint it is true at
present but at ani rate thei did not dwell gloomili upon impend
ruin or suggest that it wa hi duti to get marri thei remain
silent distressingli silent inde
well as the question of marriag had been start he might as well
face it out that is argu it in hi mind reduc it to it principl
follow it to it issu in a reason and scientif manner what were
the fact hi famili which by tradit wa report to be danish
in it origin had own thi properti for sever hundr year though
how thei came to own it remain a matter of disput some said the
abbei and it land were grant to a man of the name of monk by henri
viii of cours for a consider other held and evid exist
in favour of thi view that on the dissolut of the monasteri the
abbot of the dai a shrewd man of easi principl manag to possess
himself of the chapter hous and further extens heredita of
cours with the conniv of the commission and provid himself
with a wife to exchang a spiritu for a tempor digniti at least
thi remain certain that from the time of elizabeth onward morriss
forefath had been settl in the old abbei hous at monksland that
the first of them about whom thei realli knew anyth wa name monk
and that monk wa still the famili name
now thei were all dead and gone and their histori which wa
undistinguish doe not matter to come to the present dai hi father
succeed to a diminish and encumb estat inde had it not been
for the fortun of hi mother a miss porson and on of a middl class
and busi but rather wealthi famili the properti must have been
sold year befor that fortun howev had long ago been absorbedor
so he gatheredfor hi father a brilliant and fashion armi
offic wa not the man to stint himself or to nurs a crippl
properti inde it wa wonder to morri how without ani particular
chang in their style of live which if unpretenti wa not cheap
in these bad time thei had manag to keep afloat at all
unworldli as morri might be he could easili guess why hi father
wish that he should marri and marri well it wa that he might
bolster up the fortun of a shatter famili alsoand thi touch
him thi command hi sympathyh wa the last of hi race if
he di without issu the ancient name of monk becam extinct a
consumm from which hi father shrank with someth like horror
the colonel wa a selfish manmorri could not conceal it even from
himselfon who had alwai thought of hi own comfort and conveni
first yet either from idl or pride to advanc these he had
never stoop to scheme where the welfar of hi famili wa concern
howev as hi son knew he wa a schemer that desir wa the on
real and substanti thing in a somewhat superfici egotist and
finess charact
morri saw it all as he lean there upon the rail stare at the
mistdrap sea more clearli inde than he had ever seen it befor
he understood moreov what an unsatisfactori son he must be to a man
like hi fatherif it had tri provid could hardli have furnish
him with offspr more unsuit the colonel had wish him to enter
the diplomat servic or the armi or at least to get himself call
to the bar but although a realli brilliant univers career and
hi famili influenc would have given him advantag in ani of these
profess he had declin them all so follow hi natur bent
he becam an electrician and now abandon the practic side of
that modest call he wa an experiment physicist full of deep but

well marri he must as a matter of duti if for no other reason after
all the thing wa not press for it it came to the point what woman
wa like to accept him all he had done tonight wa to settl
the gener principl in hi own mind when it becam necessaryif
everh could deal with the detail
and yet thi sort of marriag which wa propos to him wa it not an
unholi busi he care littl for women have no weak that wai
probabl becaus of the energi which other young men gave to the pursuit
of them wa in hi case absorb by intens and brainexhaust studi
therefor he wa not a man who if left to himself would marri as so
mani do mere in order to be marri inde the idea to him wa
almost repuls had he been a womanhat he might have accept it
more easili for then to him on would have been as the other but the
troubl wa that he knew and felt that a time might come when in hi
ey on woman would be differ from all other a be who spoke not

what did the sight suggest to him that it wa worth while perhap
to be a mere drift of cloud stormdriven and rainladen in the bitter

seasid gabl roof of red tile and stucco wall decor with sham
woodwork with the differ that the hous wa exceedingli well built

alpaca coat a straw hat and a pair of spectacl who wa engag in
sad contempl of a bed of dy evergreen
at the sound of that wellknown voic the littl man jump as though he
had trodden on a pin and turn round slowli mutter to himself
graciou it him an ungrammat sentenc which indic
suffici how wide a nich in the templ of hi mind wa fill with
the imag of hi brotherinlaw colonel monk
john porson wa a man of about six or eight and fifti roundfac
bald with larg blue ey not unlik those of a china doll and
cleanshaven except for a pair of sandycolour muttonchop whisker
in express he wa gentl even timid and in figur short and stout
at thi veri moment behind a hundr counter stand a hundr replica
of that goodheart man and worthi citizen john porson can he be
describ better or more briefli
how ar you colonel he said hurri forward he had never yet dare
to call hi brotherinlaw monk and much less by hi christian name
so he compromis on colonel
pretti well thank you consid my year and bother and how
ar you john
not veri grand not veri grand said the littl man my heart ha
been troubl me and it wa so dreadfulli hot in london
then why didnt you come awai
realli i dont know i understood that it had someth to do with a
parti but i think the fact is that mari wa too lazi to look after the
servant while thei pack up
perhap she had some attract there suggest the colonel with an
anxieti which might have been obviou to a more skill observ
attract what do you mean ask porson
mean you old goos why what should i mean a young man of cours
oh i see no i am sure it wa noth of that sort mari wont be
bother with young men she is too lazi she just look over their
head till thei get tire and go awai i am sure it wa the pack
or perhap the parti but what ar you stare at colonel is there
anyth wrong
no no onli that wonder window of yoursth on fill with
bottleglasswhich alwai remind me of a bullsey lantern stand
on a preservedbeef tin or the top of a toi lighthous
porson peer at the offend window through hi spectacl
certainli now you mention it it doe look a littl odd from here he
said nake rather you said so befor you rememb and i told them
to plant the shrub but while i wa awai thei let everi on of the poor
thing die i will ask my architect jenkin if he cant do anyth
it might be pull down perhap
better leav it alon said the colonel with a sniff if i know
anyth of jenkin hed onli put up someth wors i tell you john
that where brick and mortar ar concern that man a moral monster
i know you dont like hi style murmur porson but wont you come
in it is so hot out here in the sun
thank you ye but let us go to that place you call your den not to
the drawingroom if you can spare it i want halfanhour with you
that why i came over in the afternoon befor dinner
certainli certainli murmur porson again as he led the wai to
the den but to himself he ad it those mortgag ill bet oh
dear oh dear when shall i see the last of them
present thei were establish in the den the colonel veri cool and
comfort in mr porson armchair and porson himself perch
upon the edg of a newlook leather sofa in an attitud of pain
expect
now i am at your servic colonel he said
oh ye well it is just thi i want you if you will to look
through these figur for me and he produc and hand to him a
portent document head list of oblig
mr porson glanc at it and instantli hi round simpl face becam
clever and alert here he wa on hi own ground in five minut he had
master the thing
ye he said in a quick voic thi is quit clear but there is
some mistak in the addit make a differ of 87 pound 3s 10d
in your favour well where is the schedul of asset
the schedul of asset my dear john i wish i knew i have my pension
and there ar the abbei and estat which as thing ar seem to
be mortgag to their full valu that about all i think
unlessunlessand he laugh we throw in morriss patent electr
machin which wont work
it ought to be reckon perhap repli mr porson grave ad
in a kind of burst with an air of complet convict i believ in
morriss machin or at least i believ in morri he ha the make
of a great manno of a great inventor about him
do you realli repli the colonel much interest that is
curiousand encourag for my dear john where busi matter ar
concern i trust your judgment
but i doubt whether he will make ani monei out of it went on porson
on dai the world will benefit probabl he will not benefit
the colonel interest fade possibl john but if so perhap
for present purpos we mai leav thi mysteri discoveri out of the
question
i think so i think so but what is the point
the point is that i seem to be about at the end of my tether although
as yet i am glad to sai nobodi ha actual press me and i have
come to you as a friend and a rel for advic what is to be done
i have sold you all the valuabl land and i am glad to think that you
have made a veri good thing of it some year ago also you took over
the two heaviest mortgag on the abbei estat and i am sorri to sai
that the interest is consider in arrear there remain the float
debt and other charg amount in all to about 7000 pound which
i have no mean of meet and meanwhil of cours the place must be
kept up under these circumst john i ask you as a busi man
what is to be done
and as a busi man i sai im hang if i know said porson with
unwont energi all debt no assetsth posit is imposs
unless inde someth happen
quit so that it my onli comfort isthat someth might happen
and he paus
porson fidget about on the edg of the leather sofa and turn red in
hi heart he wa wonder whether he dare offer to pai off the debt
thi he wa quit abl to do more he wa will to do sinc to him
good simpl man the welfar of the ancient hous of monk of which hi
onli sister had marri the head wa a far more import thing than
part with a certain number of thousand of pound for birth and
station in hi plebeian humil john porson had a rever which
wa almost superstiti moreov he had love hi dead sister
dearli and in hi wai he love her son also also he rever hi
brotherinlaw the polish and splendidlook colonel although it
wa true that sometim he writh beneath hi militari and aristocrat
heel particularli inde did he resent in hi secret heart those
continu sarcasm about hi tast in architectur
now although the monetari transact between them had been mani as
luck would have itentir without hi own designthei chanc in the
main to have turn to hi porson advantag thu ow chiefli
to hi intellig develop of it possibl the land which he
bought from the monk estat had increas enorm in valu so much
so inde that even if he lost all the other sum advanc upon
mortgag he would still be consider to the good therefor as it
happen the colonel wa realli under no oblig to him in these
circumst mr porson did not quit know how a coldblood offer
of an advanc of cash without securityin practic a giftwould be
receiv
have you anyth definit in your mind he hesit timidli
the colonel reflect on hi part he wa wonder how porson would
receiv the suggest of a substanti loan it seem too much
to risk he wa proud and did not like to lai himself open to the
possibl of rebuff
i think not john unless morri should chanc to make a good marriag
which is unlik for as you know he is an odd fish i can see
noth befor us except ruin inde at my ag it doe not greatli
matter but it seem a piti that the old hous should come to an end in
such a melancholi and discredit fashion
a piti it is more than a piti jerk out porson with a sudden
wriggl which caus him to rock up and down upon the stiff spring of
the new sofa
as he spoke there came a knock at the door and from the further side of
it a slow rich voic wa heard sai mai i come in
that mari said mr porson ye come in dear it onli your
uncl
the door open mari came in and in some curiou quiet wai at onc
her person seem to take possess of and domin that shade
room to begin with her statur gave an idea of dominion for without
be at all coars she wa tall and full in frame the face also wa
somewhat massiv with a round chin and larg blue ey that had a
trick of look half asleep and abov a low broad forehead grew her
wave golden hair part simpli in the middl after the old greek
fashion she wore a white dress with a silver girdl that set off the
beauti outlin of her figur to great advantag and with her a
perfum seem to pass perhap from the rose on her bosom
a beauti woman thought the colonel to himself as she came in and
he wa no mean or inexperienc judg a beauti woman but a regular
lotuseat
how do you do uncl richard said mari paus about six feet awai
and hold out her hand i heard you scold my poor dad about hi
bowwindow in fact you woke me up and do you know you us exactli
the same word as you did at your visit after we came down from london
last year
bless me my dear said the colonel struggl to hi feet and
kiss hi niec upon the forehead what a memori you have got it
will get you into troubl some dai
i daresaym or somebodi els but histori repeat itself uncl
that is all the same sleepi me in a loungechair the same hot dai
the same bluebottl and the same you scold the same daddi about
the same window though what on earth dad window can matter to anyon
except himself i cant understand
i daresai not my dear i daresai not we can none of us know
everythingnot even latter dai young ladiesbut i suggest that a few
hour with fergussen handbook of architectur might enlighten you on
the point
mari reflect but the onli reparte that she could conjur at
the moment wa someth about ancient light which did not seem
appropri therefor as she thought that she had done enough for
honour and to remind her aweinspir rel that he could not
suppress her suddenli she chang the subject
you ar look veri well uncl she said survei him calmli
and younger than you did last year how is my cousin morri will the
aerophon talk yet
be care said the colonel gallantli if even my grei hair can
provok a compliment what homag is suffici for a sleep beauti
as for morri he is i believ much as usual at least he stood thi
morn till daybreak stare at the sea i understand howeverif he
doesnt forget to comethat you ar to have the pleasur of see him
thi even when you will be abl to judg for yourself
now dont be sarcast about morri uncl id rather you went on
abus dad window
certainli not my dear if it displeas you but mai i ask why he is
to be consid sacr
why she answer and a genuin note crept into her banter voic
becaus he is on of the few men worth anyth whom i ever chanc to
meetexcept dad there and
spare me cut in the colonel with admir skill for well he knew
that hi name wa not upon the ladi lip but would it be impertin
to inquir what it is that constitut morriss preemin excel in
your ey
of cours not onli it is three thing not on first he work harder
than ani man i know and i think men who work ador becaus i am so
lazi myself secondli he think a great deal and veri few peopl do
that to ani purpos thirdli i never feel inclin to go to sleep when
he take me in to dinner oh you mai laugh if you like but ask dad
what happen to me last month with that wretch old member of the
govern and befor the sweet too
pleas pleas put in mr porson turn pink under pressur of some
pain recollect if you have finish spar with your uncl
isnt there ani tea mari
i believ so she said relaps into a state of bland indiffer
ill go and see if i dont come back youll know it is there and
mari pass through the door with that indol grace walk which no
on could mistak who onc had seen her
both her father and her uncl look after her with admir mr
porson admir her becaus the man or woman who dare to meet that
domest tyrant hi brotherinlaw in singl combat and could issu
unconqu from the doubt frai wa inde worthi to be honour
colonel monk for hi part hasten to do homag to a veri pretti and
charm young ladi on moreov who wa not in the least afraid of
him
mari had gone and the air from the offend window which wa so
construct as to let in a maximum of draught bang the door behind
her the two men look at each other a thought wa in the mind of
each but the colonel train by long experi and wise in hi
gener wait for mr porson to speak mani and mani a time in the
after dai did he find reason to congratul himself upon thi superb
reticencefor there ar occas when discret can amount almost to
the height of geniu under their rel circumst if it had
been he who first suggest thi allianc he and hi famili must have
remain at the gravest disadvantag and as for stipul well he
could have made none but as it chanc it wa from poor porson lip
that the suggest came
mr porson clear thi throatonc twice thrice at the third rasp
the colonel becam veri attent he rememb that hi brotherinlaw
had done exactli the same thing at the veri apex of a longdepart
crisi inde just befor he offer spontan to take over the
mortgag on the abbei estat
you were talk colonel he began when mari came in and he
paus
i daresai repli the colonel indiffer fix a contemptu
glanc upon some stone mullion of atroci design
about morri marri
oh ye so i wa well
wellsh seem to like him i know she doe inde she never talk of
ani other young man
she who
my daughter mari andsowhi shouldnt theyyou know
realli john i must ask you to be a littl more explicit it no good
your address me in your busi cipher
welli meanwhi shouldnt he marri her morri marri mari is that
plain enough he ask in desper
for a moment a mist gather befor the colonel ey here wa
salvat inde if onli it could be brought about oh if onli it
could be brought about
but the dark ey never chang nor did a muscl move upon that pale
command counten
morri marri mari he repeat dwell on the allit word
as though to convinc himself that he had heard them aright that is a
veri strang proposit my dear john and sudden too why thei ar
first cousin and for that reason i suppos the thing never occur
to metil last night he ad to himself
ye i know colonel but i am not certain that thi first cousin
busi isnt a bit exagger the return of the asylum seem to
show it and i know my doctor sir henri andrew sai it nonsens
youll admit that he is an author also it happen in my own
famili my father and mother were cousin and we ar none the wors
on anoth occas the colonel might have been inclin to comment on
thi statementof cours most polit now howev he let it pass
well john he said put asid the cousinship let me hear what
your idea is of the advantag of such a union should the parti
concern chang to consid it suitabl
quit so quit so that busi said mr porson brighten up
at onc from my point of view these would be the advantag as you
know colonel so far as i am concern my origin for the time i have
been abl to trace itthat four gener from old john porson
the quaker sugar merchant who came from nobodi know wherealthough
honest is humbl and until my father dai all in the line of retail
trade but then my dear wife came in she wa a gover when i marri
her as you mai have heard and of a veri good scotch famili on of
the cameron so mari isnt all of our cutani more he ad with a
smile than morri is all of your still for her to marri a monk would
be a lift upa consider lift up and look at from a busi
point of view worth a deal of monei
also i like my nephew morri and i am sure that mari like him and
id wish the two of them to inherit what i have got thei wouldnt have
veri long to wait for it colonel for those doctor mai sai what thei
will but i tell you he ad pathet tap himself over the
heartthough you dont mention it to maryi know better oh ye i
know better that about all except of cours that i should wish to
see her settl befor im gone a man di happier you understand if
he is certain whom hi onli child is go to marri for when he is
dead i suppos that he will know noth of what happen to her or
perhap he ad as though by an afterthought he mai know too much
and not be abl to help which would be pain veri pain
dont get into those specul john said the colonel wave hi
hand thei ar unpleas and lead nowheresuffici to the dai is
the evil thereof
quit so quit so life is a queer game of blindman buff isnt it
plai in a mist on a mountain top and the player keep drop over
the precipic but nobodi heed becaus there ar alwai plenti more
and the game goe on forev well that my side of the case do you
wish me to put your
i should like to hear your view of it
veri good it is thi here a nice girl no on can deni that and a
nice man although he oddyou will admit as much he got name and
he will have fame or i am much mistaken but as it chanc through no
fault of hi he want monei or will want it for without monei the
old place cant go on and without a wife the old race cant go on now
mari will have lot of monei for to tell the truth it keep pile up
until i am sick of it iv been lucki in that wai colonel becaus i
dont care much about it i suppos i dont think that i ever yet made
a realli bad invest just look two year ago to oblig an old
friend who wa in the shop with me when i wa young i put 5000 pound
into an australian mine never think to see it again yesterdai i
sold that stock for 50000 pound
fifti thousand pound ejacul the colonel astonish into
admir
ye or to be accur 49375 pound 3s 10d andthat where the
jar come ini dont care i never thought of it again sinc i got the
broker note till thi minut i have been think all dai about my
heart which is uneasi and about what will happen to mari when i am
gone what the good of thi dirti monei to a dy man id give it
all to have my wife and the boi i lost back for a year or two ye i
would go into a shop again and sell sugar like my grandfath and live
on the profit from the till and the counter there mari call we
must tell a fib we must sai that we thought she wa to come to fetch
us dont you forget well there it is perhap youll think it over at
your leisur
ye john repli the colonel solemnli certainli i will think it
over of cours there ar pro and con but on the whole speak
offhand i dont see why the young peopl should not make a match also
you have alwai been a good rel and what is better a good friend
to me so of cours if possibl i should like to fall in with your
wish
mr porson who wa advanc toward the door wheel round quickli
thank you colonel he said i appreci your sentiment but dont
you make ani mistak it isnt my wish that have to be fallen in
withor your wish it the wish of your son morri and my
daughter mari if thei ar agreeabl id like it well if not all the
monei in the world nor all the famili in the world wouldnt make me
have anyth to do with the job or you either whatev our fail
we ar honest menboth of us who would not sell our flesh and blood
for such trash as that

to be brief will you marri her
will she marri me ask morri isnt she too sensibl
hi father ey twinkl but he restrain himself thi he felt wa
not an occas upon which to indulg hi power of sarcasm
upon my word if you want my opinion i believ she will but you have
to ask her first look here my boi be advis by me and do it as soon
as possibl the notion is rather new to me i admit but take her
all round where would you find a better woman you and i dont alwai
agre about thing we ar of a differ gener and look at the

right had he to resist thi appeal he wa heartwhol without ani
kind of complic and for hi cousin mari he had true affect and
respect moreov thei had been brought up togeth she understood
him and in the midst of so much that wa uncertain and bewild
she seem someth genuin and solid someth to which a man could
cling it mai not have been a right spirit in which to approach thi
question of marriag but in the case of a young man like morri
who wa driven forward by no passion by no scheme even of person
advanc thi substitut of reason for impuls and instinct wa
perhap natur
veri well i will he answer but if she is wise she wont
hi father turn hi head awai and sigh softli and that sigh seem
to lift a ton weight off hi heart
i am glad to hear it he answer simpli the rest must settl

could find a chanc to propos to mari that night the thing wa to be
done so the sooner he did it the better
then it would be over on wai or the other besid and thi wa
strang and opportun enough never had he felt so deepli and truli
attract to mari whether it wa becaus her soft indol beauti
show at it best thi even in that gown and set or becaus
her convers with it subacid ting of kindli humour amus him

hi dresssho here wa the opportun for which he had wish but
as he could not be call a forward or even a push lover he wa
alarm at it veri prompt arriv thi answer to hi prayer wa
somewhat too swift and thorough there is a stori of an enorm fat
old boer who wa seat on the veld with hi hors at hi side when
suddenli a band of arm nativ rush to attack him oh god help

bright halfmoon across whose face the littl whiteedg cloud
drift in quick success throw their gigant shadow to the
world beneath all silver wa the sleep sea where the moonlight fell
upon it and when thi wa eclips then it wa all jet to the right
and left up to the veri border of the cliff lai the soft wreath
of roke or landfog cover the earth as with a cloak of down but
pierc here and there by the dim and tower shape of tree yet
although these curl wreath of mist hung on the edg of the cliff
like white water about to fall thei never fell sinc clear to the
sight though separ from them by a gulf of transluc black
lai the yellow belt of sand up which inch by inch the tide wa
creep
and the airno wind stir it though the wind wa at work aloftit

for the first autumn frost wa fall
thei stood for a few moment look at all these wonder beauti
of the mysteri nightwhich dweller in the countri so rare
appreci becaus to them thei ar common daili thingsand listen
to the soft longdrawn murmur of the sea upon the shingl then thei
went forward to the edg of the cliff but although morri threw the fur
rug over it mari did not seat herself in the comfortablelook deck
chair her desir for repos had depart she prefer to lean upon
the low grei wall in whose cranni grew lichen tini fern and in
their season harebel and wallflow morri came and leant at her

morri note all these thing in hi quiet observ wai and from
them drew certain conclus of hi own but he shrank from make
inquiri nor did the colonel offer ani confid after all why
should he who had never meddl with hi father busi choos thi
moment to explor it especi as he knew from previou experi
that such investig would not be well receiv it wa on of the
colonel peculiar to keep hi affair to himself until thei grew
so bad that circumst forc him to seek the counsel or the aid
of other still morri could well guess from what mine the monei wa
dig that caus so comfort a chang in their circumst and
the solut of thi mysteri gave him littl joi cash in consider
of an unconclud marriag that wa how it read to hi sensit

of search and unfruit labour that at last he discov a clue which
in the end result in the perfect of the instrument that wa the
parent of the aerophon of commerc and gave him a name among the

kiss all of her own accord sai morri i am afraidi am afraid
i feel as if our good time wa done
after thi the servant came to sai that she might go up to her father
room and that scene of our drama wa at an end
mr porson own a villa at beaulieu in the south of franc which he
had built mani year befor as a winter hous for hi wife whose chest
wa weak here he wa in the habit of spend the spring month more
perhap becaus of the associ which the place possess for him
than of ani affect for foreign land now howev after thi last
attack three doctor in consult announc that it would be well
for him to escap from the fog and damp of england so to beaulieu he
wa order
thi decre caus constern in variou quarter mr porson did
not wish to go mari and morri were cast down for simpl and elementari
reason and colonel monk found thi chang of planit had been
arrang that the porson should stop at seaview till the new year
which wa to be the dai of the marriageinconveni and inde
disturb onc those young peopl were part reflect the colonel
in hi wisdom who could tell what might or might not happen
in thi difficulti he found an inspir why should not the wed
take place at onc veri diplomat he sound hi brotherinlaw
to find that he had no opposit to fear in thi quarter provid that
mari and her husband would join him at beaulieu after a week or two of
honeymoon then he spoke to morri who wa delight with the idea
for morri had come to the conclus that the marriag state would be
better and more satisfactori than on of prolong engag
it onli remain therefor to obtain the consent of mari which would
perhap have been given without much difficulti had her uncl been
content to leav hi son or mr porson to ask it of her as it chanc
thi he wa not will to do porson he wa sure would at onc give
wai should hi daughter rais ani object and in morriss tact and
persuas power the colonel had no faith
in the issu confid in hi own diplomat abil he determin
to manag the affair himself and to speak to hi niec the mistak wa
grave for wherea she wa as wax to her father or her lover someth
in her uncl manner or it mai have been hi veri person alwai
arous in mari a spirit of opposit on thi occas too that
manner wa not fortun for he put the propos befor her as a thing
alreadi agre upon by all concern and on to which her consent wa
ask as a mere matter of form
instantli mari becam antagonist she pretend not to understand
she ask for reason and explan final she announc in idl
word beneath which ran a current of determin that neither her
father nor morri could realli wish thi hurri marriag sinc had
thei done so on or other of them would have spoken to her on the
subject when press she intim veri polit but in languag
whereof the mean could hardli be mistaken that she held thi fix
of the date to be peculiarli her own privileg and when still further
press said plainli that she consid her father too ill for her to
think of be marri at present
but thei both desir it expostul the colonel
thei have not told me so mari answer set her red lip
if that is all thei will tell you so soon enough my dear girl
perhap uncl after thei have been direct to do so but that is not
quit the same thing
the colonel saw that he had made a mistak and too late chang hi
tactic
you see mari your father state of health is precari he might
grow wors
she tap her foot upon the ground of these allus to the possibl
and inde the certain end of her belov father ill she had a
kind of horror
in that event that dread event she answer he will need me my
whole time and care to nurs him these i might not be abl to give if i
were alreadi marri i love morri veri dearli i am hi for whatev i
mai be worth but i wa my father befor morri came into my life and
he ha the first claim upon me
what then do you propos ask the colonel curtli for opposit
and argument bred no meek in hi somewhat arbitrari breast
to be marri on new year dai wherev we ar if morri wish it
and the state of my father health make it conveni if not uncl
richard to wait till a more fit season then she rosefor thi
convers took place at seaviewsai that it wa time she should
give her father hi medicin
thu the project of an earli marriag fell through for have
onc been driven into announc her decis in term so open and
unmistak mari would not go back on her word
morri who wa much disappoint plead with her her father also
spoke upon the subject but though the voic wa the voic of mr
porson the argument she perceiv were the argument of colonel
monk therefor she harden her heart and put the matter by refus
inde to discuss it at ani length yetand it is not the first time
that a woman ha allow her whim to prevail over her secret wishesin
truth she desir noth more than to be marri to morri so soon as
it wa hi will to take her
final a compromis wa arrang there wa to be no wed at
present but the whole parti were to go togeth to beaulieu there
to await the develop of event it wa arrang moreov by all
concern that unless someth unforeseen occur to prevent it the
marriag should be celebr upon or about new year dai
chapter vii
beaulieu
beauti as it might be and fashion as it might be morri did
not find beaulieu veri entertain inde in an unguard moment he
confess to mari that he hate the hole even the steam launch in
which thei went for picnic did not consol him fond though he wa of
the sea while as for mont carlo after hi third visit he wa heard
to declar that if thei want to take him there again it must be in hi
coffin
the colonel did not share these view he wa out for a holidai and he
meant to enjoi himself to begin with there wa the club at nice where
he fell in with sever old comrad and friend then whom should he
meet but ladi rawlin onc for a littl while in the distant past
thei had been engag until suddenli the young ladi a beauti in her
dai jilt him in favour of a wealthi banker of hebraic origin now
mani year after the banker wa ag violent and uncom habitu
exceed in hi cup and abus hi wife befor the servant so it
came about that to the poor woman the colonel courteou if somewhat
sarcast consol were realli veri welcom it pleas him also to
offer them the jilt he had long ago forgiven inde he bless her
nightli for have taken that view of her oblig see that jane
millet as she wa then howev pretti her face mai onc have been had
neither fortun nor connect
ye my dear jane he said to her confidenti on afternoon i
assur you i often admir your foresight now if you had done the other
thing where should we have been todai in the workhous i imagin
i suppos so answer ladi rawlin meekli and suppress a
sigh sinc for the courtli and distinguish colonel she cherish
a sentiment admir which actual increas with ag but you
didnt alwai think like that richard then she glanc out of the
window and ad oh there is jonah come home and he look so
cross and the poor ladi shiver
the colonel put up hi eyeglass and contempl jonah through the
window he wa not a pleas spectacl a rather lowclass hebrew who
call himself a christian of unpleas appear and sinist temper
suffer from the effect of lunch is not an object to be love
ah i see said the colonel ye sir jonah ag doesnt he
as inde we do all of us and he glanc at the ladi spread
proport then he went on you realli should persuad him to be
tidier in hi costum jane hi ancestr namesak could scarc have
look more dishevel after hi sojourn with the whale well it is
a small fail on cant have everyth and on the whole with your
wealth and the rest you have been a veri fortun woman
oh richard how can you sai so murmur the wretch ladi rawlin
as she took the hand outstretch in farewel for jonah in larg dose
wa more than the colonel could stomach
inde as the door close behind him she wipe awai a tear whisper
to herself and to think that i threw over dear richard in order to
marri thatthaty i will sai itthat horror
meanwhil as he stroll down the street beautifulli dress and
still look veri upright and handsomefor he had never lost hi
figureth colonel wa sai to himself
silli old woman well i hope that by now she know the differ
between a gentleman and a halfchristianis moneyhunt
winebib jew howev she got the fortun which wa what she
want although she forget it now and he got a lachrymos stout
old parti but how beauti she us to be my word how beauti she
us to be to go to see her now is better than ani sermon it is an
admir moral exercis
to ladi rawlin also the colonel visit prove excel moral
exercis ting with chasten whenev he went awai he left behind
him some aphor or reflect fill with a wholesom bitter but
still she sought hi societi and in secret ador him
in addit to the club and ladi rawlin there were the tabl at mont
carlo with their motlei compani which to a man of the world could not
fail to be amus besid the colonel had on weaknesssometim he
did a littl gambl and when he plai he like to plai fairli
high morri accompani him onc to the sall de jeu andthat wa
enough what pass there exactli could never be got out of him even
by mari whose sens of humour wa more than satisfi with the littl
comedi in progress about her no singl point of which did she ever
miss
onli funni as she might be in her gener feebl and badli as
she might have behav in some distant past for ladi rawlin she felt
sorri her kind heart told mari that thi unhappi person also possess
a heart although she wa now stout and on the wrong side of middl ag
she wa awar too that the colonel knew as much and hi scientif
pinprick and sear of that guileless and unprotect organ struck
her as littl short of cruel none the less so inde becaus the
victim at the stake imagin that thei were inflict in kind by the
hand of a still tender and devot friend
i hope that i shant quarrel with my fatherinlaw reflect mari
to herself after on of the best of these exhibit he got an
uncommonli long memori and like to come even howev i never shall
becaus he afraid of me and know that i see through him
mari wa right a veri sincer respect for her martial power when
rous ensur perfect peac between her and the colonel with hi
son howev it wa otherwis even in thi ag of the triumph of the
offspr parent do exist who take advantag of their son strict
observ of the fifth command it is easi to turn a man into a
moral bolster and sit upon him if you know that an exagger sens of
filial duti will prevent him from stuf himself with pin so it came
about that morri wa sometim sat upon especi when the colonel
wa suffer from a bad even at the tabl well out of sight and
hear of mari be it understood who on such occas wa apt to
develop a quit formid temper
it is over thi question of the tabl that on of these domest
differ aros which in it result brought about the return of the
monk to monksland upon a certain afternoon the colonel ask hi son
to accompani him to mont carlo morri refus rather curtli perhap
veri well repli the colonel in hi grandest manner i am sure i
do not wish for an unwil companion and doubtless your attent is
claim by affair more import than the accord of your compani to
a father
no repli morri with hi accustom truth i am go out
seafish that is all
quit so allow me then to wish good luck to your fish doe mari
accompani you
no i think not she sai the boat make her sick and she cant bear
eel
so much the better as i can ask for the pleasur of her societi thi
afternoon
ye you can ask said morri suddenli turn angri
do you impli morri that the request will be refus
certainli father if i have anyth to do with it
and might i inquir why
becaus i wont have mari taken to that place to mix with the peopl
who frequent it
i see thi is exclus with a vengeanc perhap you consid
that those unholi door should be shut to me also
i have no right to express an opinion as to where my father should
or should not go but if you ask me i think that under all the
circumst you would do best to keep awai
the circumst what circumst
those of our poverti which leav us no monei to risk in gambl
then the colonel lost all control of hi temper as sometim happen
to him and becam exceedingli violent and unpleas what he said doe
not matter let it suffic that the remark were of a charact which
even headstrong men ar accustom to reserv for the benefit of their
womenfolk and other intim relat
attract by the nois which wa consider mari came in to find her
uncl march up and down the room vituper morri who with quit
a new express upon hi facea quiet dog kind of expressionwa
lean upon the mantelpiec and watch him
uncl began mari would you mind be a littl quieter my father
is asleep upstair and i am afraid that you will wake him
i am sorri my dear veri sorri but there ar some insult that no man
with selfrespect can submit to even from a son

who am i to obei if not morri
oh well well said the colonel diplomat begin to cool
for he could control hi temper when he like everyon to their tast
but some matter ar so delic that i prefer not to discuss them and
he look round for hi hat
by thi time howev the cyclon condit of thing had affect
mari also and she determin that he should not escap so easili
befor you go she went on in her slow voic i should like to sai
uncl that i quit agre with morri i dont think those tabl ar
quit the place to take young ladi to especi if the gentleman
with them is much engag in plai
inde inde then you ar both of a mind which is quit as it
should be of cours too upon such matter of conduct and etiquett we
must all bow to the tast and the experi of the youngeven those of
us who have mix with the world for forti year might i ask my dear

so thing went on until the event occur which wa destin profoundli
and mysteri to affect the live of morri and hi affianc wife
that event wa the shipwreck of the steam tramp trondhjem upon the

went to the window to listen present he caught the sound of voic
shout in a tongu with which he wa unacquaint follow by anoth
sound that of a boat be beach upon the shingl immedi below
the abbei now guess that someth unusu must have happen
morri took hi hat and coat and unlock the abbot door lit a
lantern and descend the cement step to the beach here he found
himself in the midst of ten or twelv men most of them tall and
beard who were gather about a ship boat which thei had drag up
high and dry on of these men who from hi uniform he judg to be
the captain approach and address him in a languag that he did not
understand but imagin must be danish or norwegian
morri shook hi head to convei the blank of hi ignor
whereupon other men address him also in northern tongu then as he
still shook hi head a lad of about nineteen came forward and spoke in
broken and barbar french
naufrag la ba he said bateau a vapeur naufrag sur le
rochersbrouillard nous echapp

injuri were obviou the right thigh wa broken and badli bruis
and he bled from a contus upon the forehead thi wound upon hi head
seem also to have affect hi brain at ani rate he wa unabl to

have fallen on him i think if it had been an inch or two higher hed
have lost hi leg or hi life or both as perhap he will now at the
best it mean a coupl of month or so on hi back no i think the
cut on hi head isnt seriou although it ha knock him silli for a
while
at length the horrid work wa done and the doctor who had to return
to a confin case in the villag depart befor he went he told
morri that he hope to be back by five oclock he promis also that
befor hi return he would call in at the sailor home to see that the
crew were comfort and discov what he could of the detail of the
catastroph meanwhil for hi part morri undertook to watch in the
sickroom
for nearli three hour while the drug retain hi grip of him the
patient remain comatos all thi while morri sat at hi bedsid
wonder who he might be and what curiou circumst could have
brought him into the compani of these rough northmen sailor to hi
profess he had a clue although no sure on for round hi neck the
man wore a silver cross suspend by a chain thi suggest that he
might be a clergyman and went far to confirm the broken talk of the
frenchspeak sailor clearli also he wa a person of some breed
and posit the refin of hi face and the delicaci of hi hand
show as much while morri wa watch and wonder suddenli the
man awok and began to talk in a confus fashion
where am i he ask
at monksland answer morri
that all right that where i should be but the ship the
shipthen a paus and a cry stella stella
morri prick hi ear where is stella he ask
on the rock she struck then dark all dark stella come
here stella
a memori awok in the mind of morri and he leant over the patient who
again had sunk into delirium
do you mean stella fregeliu he ask
the man turn hi flush face and open hi dark ey
of cours stella fregeliuswho els there is onli on stella and
again he becam incoher
for a while morri pli him with further question but as he could
obtain no coher answer he gave him hi medicin and left him quiet
then for anoth halfhour or so he sat and watch while a certain
theori took shape in hi mind thi gentleman must be the new rector
it seem as though probabl accompani by hi daughter he had taken
passag in a danish tramp boat bound for northwold which had touch
at some northumbrian port morri knew that the incom clergyman had
a daughter for now that he thought of it he had heard mr tomlei
mention the fact at the dinnerparti on the night when he becam
engag ye and certainli she wa name stella but there wa no woman
among those who had come to land and he understood the injur man to
suggest that hi daughter had been left upon the steamer which wa said
to have gone ashor upon some rock or perhap upon the sunk rock
themselv
now the onli rock within twenti mile of them were these famou sunk
rock about six knot awai even within hi own lifetim four vessel
had been lost there either becaus thei had miss or mistaken the
lightship signal further out to sea as sometim happen in a fog such
as prevail thi night or through fals reckon the fate of
all these vessel had been ident thei had struck upon the reef
rebound or slid off and founder in deep water probabl in thi
case the same thing had happen at least the fact so far as he knew
them point to that conclus evid the escap of the crew had
been veri hurri for thei had save noth he judg also that the
clergyman mr fregeliu have rush on deck had been injur by the
fall of some spar or block consequ upon the violenc of the impact
of the vessel upon the reef and in thi hurt condit had been thrown
into the boat by the sailor
then where wa the daughter stella wa she kill in the same fashion
or drown probabl on or the other but there wa a third bare
possibl which did no credit to the crew that she had been
forgotten in the panic and hurri and left behind on the sink ship
at first morri thought of rous the captain of the lifeboat on
reflect howev he abandon thi idea for realli what had he to
go on beyond the scanti and disjoint rave of a deliri man veri
possibl the girl stella wa not upon the ship at all probabl also
hour ago that vessel had vanish from the ey of men for ever to
send out the lifeboat upon such a wildgoos chase would be to turn
himself into a laughingstock
still someth drew hi thought to that hidden line of reef and the
ship which might still be hang on it and the woman who might still
be live in the ship
it wa a pain vision from which he could not free hi mind
then there came to him an idea why should he not go to the sunk rock
and look there wa a light breez off land and with the help of the
pageboi who wa sit up as the tide wa near it full he could
manag to launch hi small sailingboat which by good fortun wa still
berth near the beach step it wa a curiou chanc that thi should
be so see that in most season she would have been by now remov
to the shed a mile awai to be out of reach of possibl damag from the
furiou winter gale as it happen howev the weather remain so
open thi had not been done further the codl have begun to run
in unusu number as is common upon thi coast in late autumn morri
that veri morn had taken the boat out to fish for them an amus
which he propos to resum on the morrow in the hope of better sport
therefor the boat had her sail on board and wa in everi wai readi
for sea
why should he not go for on reason onli that he could suggest there
wa a certain amount of risk in sail about the sunk rock in a fog
even for a tini craft like hi for here the current were veri sharp
also in mani place the point of the rock were onli just beneath the
surfac of the water but he knew the danger place well enough if he
could see them as he ought to be abl to do for the dawn should break
befor he arriv and after all what wa a risk more or less in life
he would go he felt impelledstrang impelledto go though of
cours it wa all nonsens and probabl he would be back by nine
oclock have seen noth at all
by thi time the injur mr fregeliu had sunk into sleep or stupor
doubtless beneath the influenc of the second draught which he had
administ to him in obedi to the doctor order on hi account
therefor morri had no anxieti sinc the cook a steadi middleag
woman could watch by him for the present
he call her and gave her instruct bid her tell the doctor
when he came that he had gone to see if he could make out anyth more
about the wreck and that he would be back soon then order the
pageboi a stout lad to accompani him he descend the step and
togeth with some difficulti thei succeed in launch the boat
now for a moment morri hesit wonder whether he should take the
young man with him but rememb that thi journei wa not without
it danger final he decid to go alon
i am just go to have a sail round thoma to look if i can make out
anyth about that ship
ye sir remark thoma doubtfulli but it is rather a queer time
to hunt for her and in thi seahaz too especi round the sunk
rock shall i leav the lunch basket in the locker sir or take it up
to the hous
leav it it wasnt touch todai and i might be glad of some
breakfast morri answer then have hoist hi sail he sat
himself in the stern with the tiller in on hand and the sheet in the
other instantli the water began to lap gentli against the bow and in
anoth minut he glide awai from the sight of the doubt thoma
vanish like some seaghost into the haze and that chill dark
which preced the dawn
it wa veri dark and the mist wa veri damp and the wind what there
wa of it veri cold especi as in hi hurri he had forgotten to
bring a thick ulster and had noth but a covert coat and a thin
oilskin to wear moreov he could not see in the least where he wa
go or do more than lai hi cours for the sunk rock by mean of the
boat compass which he consult from time to time by the help of a
bullsey lantern
thi went on for nearli an hour by the end of which morri began
to wonder why he had start upon such a fool errand also he wa
grow alarm he knew that by now he should be in the neighbourhood
of the reef and fanci inde that he could hear the water lap
against it rock accordingli as thi reef wa ill compani in the
dark morri haul down hi sail and in case he should have reach
the shallow threw out hi littl anchor which wa attach to six
fathom of chain at first it swung loos but four or five minut
later the boat have been carri onward into fleeter water by the
swift current that wa on of the terror of the sunk rock it touch
bottom drag a littl and held fast
morri gave a sigh of relief for that blind journei among unknown
danger wa neither safe nor pleasant now at least in thi quiet
weather he could lie where he wa till light came prai that a wind
might not come first alreadi the cold novemb dawn wa break in
the east he wa abl to see the reflect of it upon the fog and the
surfac of the water black and oilylook becam visibl as it swept
past the side of hi boat now too he wa sure that the rock must
be close at hand for he could hear the run tide distinctli as it
wash against them and through the dens growth of seawe that clung
to their crest and ridg
present too he heard someth els which at first caus him to
rub hi ey in the belief that he must have fallen asleep and dreamt
noth less inde than the sound of a woman voic he began to
reason with himself what wa there strang in thi he wa told or
had infer that a woman had been left upon a ship doubtless thi
wa she upon some rock or raft perhap onli then she would have been
cry for help and thi voic wa sing and in a strang tongu
more sweetli than he had heard woman sing befor
it wa incred it wa imposs what woman would sing in a winter
daybreak upon the sunk rockss like the siren of old fabl yet
there quit close to him over the quiet sea rose the song strong
clear and thrill onc it ceas then began again in a deeper
more triumphant note such as a valkyri might have sung as she led some
norndoom host to their last battl
morri sat and listen with part lip and ey stare at the fleeci
mist he did not move or call out becaus he wa certain that he must
be the victim of some hallucin bred of fog or of fatigu or of
cold and as it wa veri strang and move he had no desir to break
in upon it charm
so there he sat while the triumphant splendid song roll and thrill
abov him and by degre the grei light of morn grew to right and
left to right and left it grew but strang enough although he
never note it at the time he and hi boat lai steep in shadow then
of a sudden there wa a chang
a puff of wind from the north seem to catch the fog and roll it up
like a curtain so that instantli all the sea becam visibl broken
here and there by roundhead weeddrap rock out of the east also
pour a flood of light from the huge ball of the rise sun and now it
wa that morri learn why the gloom had been so thick about him for
hi boat lai anchor full in the shadow of the lost ship trondhjem
there not thirti yard awai rose her great prow the cutwat which
stood up almost clear show that she had forc herself on to a
ridg of rock there too pois at the extrem point of the slope
forecastl and support herself with on hand by a wire rope that ran
thenc to the foremast wa the woman to whose sirenlik song he had
been listen
at that distanc he could see littl of her face but the newwaken
wind blew the long dark hair about her head while round her fall
almost to her nake feet wa wrap a full red cloak had morri
wish to draw the pictur of a vike daughter guid her father
ship into the frai there down to the red cloak bare feet and fly
tress stood it perfect model
the wild scene grip hi heart whoever saw the like of it thi girl
who sang in the teeth of death the desol grei face of ocean the
brown and hungri rock the huge abandon ship and over all the angri
rai of a winter sunris
thu out of the dark of the winter night out of the bewild
white mist of the morn did thi woman aris upon hi sight thi
strang new star begin to shine upon hi life and direct hi destini
at the moment that he saw her she seem to see him at ani rate she
ceas her ring defiant song and lean over the net rail
stare downward
morri began to haul at hi anchor but though he wa a strong man
at first he could not lift it just as he wa think of slip the
cabl howev the littl fluke came loos from the sand or weed in
which thei were embed and with toil and troubl he got it ship
then he took a pair of scull and row until he wa nearli under the
prow of the trondhjem it wa he too who spoke first
you must come to me he call
ye the woman answer lean over the rail i will come but how
shall i jump into the water
no he said it is too danger you might strike against a rock or
be taken by the current the companion ladder seem to be down on the
starboard side go aft to it i will row round the ship and meet you
there
she nod her head and morri start on hi journei it prove
peril to begin with there were rock all about also here the tide
or the current or both ran with the speed of a millrac so that
in place the sea bubbl and swirl like a boil kettl howev
skill and strong he might be it wa hard for on man to deal with
such difficulti and escap disast still follow the port side
of the ship sinc ow to the presenc of certain rock he dare not
attempt the direct starboard passag he came at last to her stern then
he saw how immin wa the danger for the poop of the vessel
which seem to be of about a thousand ton burden wa awash and
waterlog but roll and lift beneath the pressur of the tide
as it drew on to flood
to morri who had live all hi life by the sea and understood such
matter it wa plain that present she would float or be torn off
the point of the rock on which she hung brokenback and sink in the
hundredfathomdeep water which lai beyond the reef there wa no time
to spare and he labour at hi oar fierc till at length partli
by skill and partli by good fortun he reach the companion ladder and
fasten to it with a boathook
now no woman wa to be seen she had vanish morri call and call
but could get no answer while the great dead carcass of the ship roll
and labour abov it tower mass of iron threaten to fall and
crush him and hi tini craft to nothing he shout and shout
again then in despair lash hi boat to the companion and ran up the
ladder
where could she have gone he hurri forward along the heav jerk
deck to the main hatchwai here he hesit for a moment then know
that if anywher she must be below set hi teeth and descend the
saloon wa a foot deep in water which wash from side to side with a
heavi sicken splash and there carri a bag in on hand hold
up her garment with the other and wade toward him from the dry
upper part of the cabin at last he found the ladi whom he sought
be quick he shout for god sake be quick the ship is come
off the rock
she splash toward him now he had her by the hand now thei were
on the deck and now he wa drag her after him down the companion
ladder thei reach the boat and just as the ship gave a great roll
toward them morri seiz the oar and row like a madman
help me he gasp the current is against us and sit opposit
to him she place her hand upon hi hand press forward as he
pull her slight strength made a differ and the boat forg
aheadthirti forti seventi yardstil thei reach a rock to which
exhaust he grappl with a hook bid her hold on to the float
seawe thu thei rest for thirti second perhap when she spoke
for the first time
look she said
as she spoke the steamer slid and lift off the reef for a few moment
she wallow then suddenli her stern settl her prow rose slowli in
the air till it stood up straight fifti or sixti feet of it then with
a majest but hideou rush down went the trondhjem and vanish for
ever
all round about her the sea boil and foam while in the great
hollow which she made on the face of the water black lump of wreckag
appear and disappear
tight hold tight he cri or she will suck us after her
suck she did till the water pour over the gunwal then the worst
pass and the boat rose again the foam bubbl burst or float awai
in littl snowi heap the sea resum it level and save for the
float debri becam as it had been for thousand of year befor the
lost trondhjem rush downward to it depth
now for the first time know the immedi peril past morri look
at the face of hi companion it wa a fine face and beauti in it
wai dark ey veri larg and perfect whereof the pupil seem to
expand and contract in answer to everi impuls of the thought within

round the lip full rich and sensit the complexion of a clear
and beauti pallor the ear tini the hand delic the figur
slim of medium height and aliv with grace the gener effect most
uncommon and without be love breath a curiou power and
person

chapter ix
miss fregeliu
while miss fregeliu wa speak morri had been stare at the sail
which after draw for a time in an indiffer fashion had begun to
flap aimlessli
what is the matter ask hi companion ha the wind veer again
he nod dead from the west now and rise fast i hope that your
spirit of propheci still speak smooth thing for upon my word i
believ we ar both of us in a wors mess than ever
cant we row ashor it is onli a few mile is it
we can try but i am afraid we ar in for a regular tearer we get them
sometim on thi coast after a spell of calm weather
pleas give me an oar she said i am us to rowingof a sort
so he let down the sail and thei began to row for ten minut or so
thei struggl against the everris gale then morri call to her
to ship oar
it is no us exhaust ourselv miss fregeliu he said for now
the tide is on the ebb and dead against us as well as the wind
what ar you go to do she ask
morri glanc back to where a mile behind them the sea wa begin to
foam omin over the sunk rock here and there throw up isol
jet of sprai like those caus by the blow of a whale
i am go to try to clear them he said and then run befor it
perhap we might make the far lightship five and twenti mile awai help
me to pull up the sail so that enough she cant stand too much now
hold the sheet and if i bid you let go that instant ill steer
a few second later the boat head had come round and she wa rush
through the water at great speed parallel with the line of the sunk
rock but be momentarili driven nearer to them the girl stella
fregeliu stare at the farthest point of foam which mark the end of
the reef
you must hold her up if you want to clear it she said quietli
i cant do ani more in thi wind he answer you seem to know about
boat you will understand
she nod and on thei rush the everfreshen gale on their beam
thi boat sail well said stella as a littl water trickl over the
gunwal
morri made no answer hi ey were fix upon the point of rock onli
bid hi companion hold the tiller he did someth to the sail now
thei were not more than five hundr yard awai
it will be a veri near thing she said
veri he answer and i dont want to be offici but i suggest
that you might do well to sai your prayer
she look at him and bow her head for a minut or so then suddenli
she lift it again and stare at the terror ahead of them with wide
unflinch ey
on sped the boat while more and more did tide and gale turn her prow
into the reef at the end of it a larg humpback rock show now and
again through the surf like the fin of a black whale that wa the rock
which thei must clear if thei would live morri took the boathook and
laid it by hi side thei were veri near now thei would clear it no
the wash suck them in like a magnet
goodby said morri instinct but stella answer noth
the wave that lift them broke upon the rock in a cloud of sprai
wherein for some few instant their boat seem to vanish thei were
against it the boat touch and stella felt a long ribbon of seawe
cut her like a whip across the face kneel down morri thrust madli
with the boathook and thu for an instantjust oneheld her off hi
arm doubl beneath the strain and then came the backwash
oh heaven it had swept them clear the rock wa behind the sail drew
and swiftli thei fled awai from the death that had seem certain
stella sigh aloud while morri wipe the water from hi face
ar we clear she ask present
of the sunk rock ye we ar round them but the north sea is in
front of us and what look like the worst gale that ha blown thi
autumn is rise behind
thi is a good seaboat and on the open water i think perhap that we
ought to weather it she said try to speak cheerfulli as morri
stow the sail for in that wind thei want no canva
i wish we had someth to eat she ad present i am so hungri
by good luck i can help you there he answer yesterdai i wa out
fish and took lunch for myself and the boatman but the fish wouldnt
bite so we came back without eat it and it is still in the locker
shift a littl pleas i will get the basket
she obei and there wa the food sure enough plenti of it a thick
packet of sandwich and two boil egg a loaf and a larg lump of
chees for the boatman a flask of whiskei a bottl of beer anoth of
water and two of soda thei at up the sandwich and the egg morri
drink the beer and stella the soda water for whiskei as yet she
would not touch
now she said we ar still provis for twentyfour hour with
the bread and chees the water and the soda which is left
ye he answer if we dont sink or die of cold we shall not
starv i never thought that sandwich were so good befor and he
look hungrili at the loaf
you had better put it awai you mai want it later she suggest and
he put it awai
tell me if you dont mind he ask for the food and the lighten
of the strain upon hi nerv had made him convers what is that
song which you sang upon the ship and why did you sing it
she colour a littl and smile a sweet smile that seem to begin in
her ey
it is an old nors chant which my mother taught me she wa a dane as
my father is also by descent it ha come down in her famili for mani
mani gener and the legend is that the women of her race alwai
sang it or repeat it while the men were fight and if thei had the
strength in the hour of their own death i believ that is true for
she di whisper it herself ye it grew fainter and fainter until
it ceas with her breath so when i thought that my hour had come i
sang it also for the first time for i tri to be brave and wish
to go as my forefath went it is a foolish old custom but i like old
custom i am asham that you should have heard it i thought myself
alon that is all
you ar a veri strang young ladi said morri stare at her
strang she answer laugh not at all onli i want to show
those score of dead peopl that their tradit and spirit still live
on in me their poor modern child think how glad thei must have been
to hear the old chant as thei swept by in the wind just now wait to
give me welcom
morri stare still harder wa thi beauti girl mad he knew
someth of the old nors literatur and myth a fantast vision rose
up in hi mind of her forebear score and hundr of them gather
at some ghostli walhalla feast listen to the familiar paean as it
pour from her fearless heart and wait to rise and greet her the
last newcom of their blood with skoll daughter skoll
she watch him as though she read hi thought
you see thei would have been pleas it is onli natur she said
and i have a great respect for the opinion of my ancestor
then you ar sure thei still exist in some shape or form and ar
consciou
she laugh again of cours i am sure the world of spirit as i
think is the real world the rest is a nightmar at least it seem
like a nightmar becaus we dont know the begin or the end of the
dream
the old egyptian thought someth like that said morri
reflect thei onli live to die
but we she answer should onli die to live and that is why i try
not to be afraid i daresai howev i mean the same as thei did onli
you do not seem to have put their thought quit clearli
you ar right i meant that for them death wa but a door
that is better i think she said that wa their thought and
that is my thought and she ad search hi face perhap your
thought also
ye he answer though somehow you concentr it i have never
seen thing or rather thi thing quit so sharpli
becaus you have never been in a posit to see them thei have not
been brought home to you or your mind mai have want an interpret
perhap i am that interpreterfor the moment then she ad were
you afraid just now dont tell me if you had rather not onli i should
like to compar sensat i wasmor than on the ship i admit it
no he answer i suppos that i wa too excit
what were you think of when we bump against the rock she ask
again
well now that you mention it he repli rub hi forehead with
hi left hand like a man newli awaken i could think of noth but
that song of your which you sang upon the vessel everyth grew dark
for an instant and through the dark i rememb the song
ar you marri she ask as though speak to herself
no i am engag
then why and she stop confus
morri guess what had been in her mind and of a sudden felt terribl
asham
becaus of that witchsong of your he answer with a flash of
anger which made me forget everyth
she smile and answer it wasnt the song it wa the excit and
struggl which blot out the rest on doe not realli think at all
at such moment or so i believ i know that i didnt not just when we
bump against the rock but it is odd that you should believ that you
rememb my song for accord to tradit that is just what the
chant should do and what it alwai did it ancient name mean the
overlord becaus those who sang it and those who heard it were said
to rememb noth els and to fear noth not even death our lord
it is the welcom that thei give to death
what egregi nonsens he blurt out
i daresai but then why do you understand my nonsens so well tell
me if you will of what blood ar you
danish i believ in the begin
oh she said laugh no doubt that account for it some
forefath of your mai have heard the song of the overlord perhap
from the lip of some foremoth of mine so of cours you rememb
and understood
such a thing will scarc bear argument will it
of cours it wont i have onli been joke all the time though i do
half believ in thi old song as my ancestor did befor me i mean
that as i thought i had to die i like to keep up the ancient custom
and sing it first it encourag my spirit but where ar we go
to where our spirit will need no more encourag he answer
grimli or at least i fear it mai be so miss fregeliu to drop
jest it is blow veri hard off land the sea is get up and thi
is but a small boat we ar do pretti well now but sooner or later
i fear and i think it right to tell you that a wave mai poop us and
then
there will be an end said stella is there anyth to be done have
you ani plan
none except to make the far lightship as i told you but even if we
succe i dont know whether it will be possibl to get aboard of her
unless the sea moder
wont the lifeboat come out to look for you she ask
he shook hi head how could thei find on tini sail upon the great
ocean moreov it will be suppos either that i have founder or
made some port along the coast there is the worst of it i fear that it
mai be telegraph everywher and he sigh deepli
why she ask ar you a veri import person that thei should
bother to do that you see she ad in explan i dont even

distinguish elderli gentleman of veri good birth and manner too
when he chose who intens dislik grow old he said that he
thought of himself more than of anybodi els in the world and next of
the welfar of hi famili and that if we wish to get on with him
we must be care not to offend hi digniti as then he would be
quarrelsom

my father weak side and what wa hi definit of myself
he said that you were in hi opinion on of the most interest peopl
that he had ever met that you were a dreamer and a mystic that you
care for few of the thing which usual attract young men and that

why do you pretend not to understand miss fregeliu you must know
perfectli well that i came to look for you
inde she answer candidli i knew noth of the sort how did
you find out that i wa still on the ship or that the ship wa still
abov water and even if you knew both why should you risk your life
just on the faint chanc of rescu a girl whom you never saw
i cant quit tell you but your father in hi delirium mutter some
word which made me suspect the truth and a sailor who could speak
a littl bad french said that the trondhjem wa lost upon some rock
well these ar the onli rock about here and as the whole stori wa
too vagu to carri to the lifeboat peopl i thought that i would come to
look so you see it is perfectli simpl
so simpl mr monk that i do not understand it in the least you must
have known the risk for you ask no on to share themth risk that
ar so near and real and shiver visibl she look at the grei
comber seeth past them and the windtorn horizon beyond yet
youyou who have ti face all thi on the chanc of save a
stranger

chapter x
dawn and the land
a dai a whole dai spent upon that sullen sunless wast of water
with the great wave bear them onward in on etern monoton
process till at length thei grew dizzi with look at them and
the ceaseless gale pipe in their ear long ago thei had lost sight of
land even the tall church tower built by our ancestor as beacon
on thi stormi coast had vanish utterli twice thei sight ship
scud along under their few rag of canva and onc a steamer
pass the smoke from her funnel blow out like long black pennon
but all of these were too far off or too much engag with their
own affair to see the littl craft toss hither and thither like a
usedup her basket upon the endless area of ocean
fortun from hi youth morri had been accustom to the manag
of boat in all sort of weather the occup of sail alon
upon the water be on well suit to hi solitari and reflect
disposit thu it came about that thei surviv when other
less skil might have drown sometim thei ran befor the sea
sometim thei got up a few squar feet of sail and take advantag
of a veer in the wind tri to tack and onc when it blew it
hardest fear lest thei should be poop for over an hour thei
contriv to keep head on to the wave
thu diversifi by some necessari bail pass the short novemb
dai long enough for them till onc more the dark began to gather
thei had still some food and drink left inde had it not been for
these thei would have perish most happili also with the sun the
wind drop although for hour the sea remain danger high
now wet and cold were their enemi wors than ani that thei had been
call upon to face long ago the drive sprai had soak them to the
skin and there upon the sea the winter night wa veri chill
while the wind fortun for them by comparison a warm on still
blew from the west and the sea remain tempestu thei found
some shelter by wrap themselv in a corner of the sail toward
midnight howev it got round to the northeast enough of it to
moder the sea consider and to enabl them to put the boat about
and go befor it with a close reef sail now inde thei were
bitterli cold and long even for the shelter of the wet canva
still morri felt and stella wa of the same mind that befor utter
exhaust overtook them their best chanc for life lai in try to
make the shore which wa thei knew not how far awai
there then for hour thei cower in the stern of the boat huddl
togeth to protect themselv as best thei might from the weather and
plung forward beneath their littl stretch of sail sleep thei could
not for that ici breath bit into their marrow and of thi morri wa
glad sinc he did not dare relax hi watch for an instant so sometim
thei sat silent and sometim by fit and start thei talk their
lip close to each other face as though thei were whisper to on
anoth
to while awai the weari time morri told hi companion about hi
invent the aerophon then she in turn told him someth of her
previou lifestella wa now a woman of four and twenti it seem
that her mother had di when she wa fourteen at the rectori in
northumberland where she wa born after that with short interv
she had spent five year in denmark whither her father came to
visit her everi summer most of thi time she pass at a school in
copenhagen go for her holidai to stai with her grandmoth who wa
the widow of a small landown of nobl famili and live in an ancient
dilapid hous in some remot villag at length the grandmoth
di leav to stella the trifl she possess after which her
educ be complet she return to northumberland to keep hous
for her father here too it would seem that her life wa veri lone
for the place wa but an unvisit coast villag and thei were not
rich enough to mix much with the few counti famili who live anywher
within reach
have you no brother or sister ask morri
even then numb as wa her flesh with cold he felt her winc at the
question
no no she answer none nowat least none here i havei mean
i hada sister my twin but she di when we were seventeen thi wa
the most dread thing that ever happen to me the thing which made
me what i am
i dont quit understand what ar you then
oh someth veri unsatisfactori i am afraid quit differ from
other peopl what mr tomlei said you were mr monk a mystic and
a dreamer of dream a lover of the dead on who dwell in the past
andin the futur
morri did not pursu the subject even under their strang
circumst favour as thei were to intimaci and confid it
seem impertin to him to pry into the mysteri of hi companion
life onli he ask at hazard almost
how did you spend your time up there in northumberland
in draw a littl in collect egg moth and flower a great
deal in practis with my violin plai and sing and dure the
long winter in make translat in my spare time of nors saga
which no on will publish
i should like to read them i am fond of the saga he said and after
thi under pressur of their physic miseri the convers di
awai
hour succeed to hour and the weather moder so much that now thei
were in littl danger of be swamp thi inde wa fortun
sinc in the event of a squall or other emerg in their numb
condit it wa doubt whether thei could have found enough strength
to do what might be necessari to save themselv thei drank what
remain of the whiskei which put life into their vein for a while
but soon it effect pass off leav them if possibl more frozen
than befor
what is the time ask stella after a long silenc
it should be daybreak in about two hour he said in a voic that
attempt cheer
then a squall of sleet burst upon them and after thi new miseri a
torpor overcam stella at least her shiver grew less violent and
her head sank upon hi shoulder morri put on arm round her waist to
save her from slip into the water at the bottom of the boat
make shift to steer with the other thu for a while thei plough
forwardwhith he knew not across the inki sea for there wa no
moon and the star were hidden driven on slowli by the bite breath
of the winter wind
present she awok lift her head and spoke sai
we cant last much longer in thi cold and wet you ar not afraid ar
you
no not exactli afraid onli sorri it is hard to go with so much to be
done andto leav behind
you shouldnt think like that she answer for what we leav must
follow she will suffer but soon she will be with you again where
everyth is understood onli you ought to have di with her and not
with me a stranger
fate settl these thing he mutter and if it come to that
mayb god will give her strength but the dawn is near and by it we mai
see land
ye yesnow her voic had sunk to a whisperth dawn is alwai
near and by it we shall see land
then again stella head sank upon hi shoulder and she slept heavili
nor although he knew that such slumber ar danger did he think it
worth while to disturb her
the invis sea hiss past the sharp wind bit hi bone and over
him too that fatal slumber began to creep but although he seldom
exercis it morri wa a man of strong will and while ani strength
wa left he refus to give wai would thi dread dark never end
for the fiftieth time he glanc back over hi shoulder and now he wa
sure of it the east grew ashen he wait awhil for the novemb dawn
is slow in break then look again heaven be thank the cold wind
had driven awai the cloud and there upon the edg of the horizon
peep up the fieri circl of the sun throw long rai of sickli
yellow across the grei troubl surfac of the water in front of him
lai a dens bank of fog which from it charact as morri knew well
must eman from the reek face of earth thei were near shore it
could not be doubt still he did not wake hi companion perhap he
might be in error and sleep even a deathsleep is better than the
cheat of disappoint hope
what wa that dim object in front of him sure it must be the ruin
a mile or so to the north of monksland that wa known as the death
church onc a villag stood here but the sea had taken most of it
inde all that remain todai wa thi old desert fane which
have been built upon a breast of rise ground still remain
await it destruct by the slow sap of the advanc ocean even
now at time of veri high tide the sea close in behind cut the
fabric off from the mainland where it look like a forsaken lighthous
rather than the tower and chancel of a church but there not much more
than a mile awai ye there it wa and morri felt proud to think how
straight he had steer homeward through that stormi dark
the sea wa still wild and high but he wa familiar with everi inch of
the coast and knew well that there wa a spot to the south of the dead
church just where the last rood of graveyard met the sand upon which
he could beach the boat safe even in wors weather for thi nook
morri head with a new energi the fire of life and hope burnt up in
him give him back hi strength and judgment
at last thei were opposit to the place and watch hi chanc he
put the helm down and ran in upon the crest of a wave till the boat
ground in the soft sand and began to wallow there like a dy thing
fear lest the backwash should suck them off into the surf again he
roll himself into the water for jump he could not inde it wa
as much as he could do to stand with a last effort of hi strength he
seiz stella in hi arm and struggl with her to the sandi shore
where he sank down exhaust then she woke oh i dream i dream
she said stare round her wildli
what he ask
that it wa all over and afterward that i and she broke off
suddenli ad but it wa all a dream for we ar safe on shore ar
we not
ye thank heaven said morri sit still and i will make the boat
secur she ha serv us a good turn and i do not want to lose her
after all
she nod and wade into the water with numb hand he manag to
lift the littl anchor and carri it ashor in hi arm
there he said the tide is eb and shell hold fast enough until
i can send to fetch her or if not it cant be help come on miss
fregeliu befor you grow too stiff to walk and bend down he
help her to her feet
their road ran past the nave of the church which wa ruin and
unroof at some time dure the last two gener howev
although the parishion saw that it wa useless to go to the cost of
repair the nave thei had brick in the chancel and to within the
last twenti year continu to us it as a place of worship inde
the old oak door taken from the porch still swung on rusti hing in the
partit wall of red brick stella look up and saw it
i want to look in there she said
wouldnt it do anoth time the moment did not strike morri as
appropri for the examin of ruin church
no if you dont mind i should like to look now while i rememb just
for on instant
so he shrug hi shoulder and thei limp forward up the roofless
nave and through the door she stare at the plain stone altar at the
eastern window of which part wa fill with ancient colour glass
and part with cheap glaze pane at the oak choir bench mouldi and
broken at the few wallslab and decai monument and at the roof
still strong and massiv
i dream of a place veri like thi she said nod her head i
thought that i wa stand in such a spot in a fear gale and that
the sea got under the foundat and wash the dead out of their
grave
realli miss fregeliu he said with some irrit for the
surround of the scene and hi companion talk were uncanni do you
think thi an occas to explor ruin and relat nightmar then
he ad i beg your pardon but i think that the cold and wet have
affect your nerv for my part i have none left
perhap at least forgiv me i did so want to look she answer
humbl as arminarm for she need support thei pass from the
altar to the door
a grotesqu imagin enter the numb mind of morri their slow
and miser march turn itself to a vision of a bridal process
from the altar wet dishevel halffrozen thei two were the
bridegroom and the bride and the bride wa a seer of vision and the
bridegroom wa a dreamer of dream ye and thei came up togeth out
of the bitter sea and the dark and thei journei togeth to a
vault of the dead
thank heaven thei were out of the place and abov wa the sun shine
and to the right and left the grei ocean and the purpl ploughland
coldlook suggest danger and labour but wholesom all of them
and good to the ey of man onli why did thi woman see vision and why
did he dream dream and what wa the mean of their strang meet
upon the sea and what
where ar we go ask stella after a while and veri faintli
home to the abbei i mean where your father li now it is not much
more than a mile awai
she sigh her strength wa fail her
you had better try to walk it will warm you he urg and she
struggl on
it wa a miser journei but thei reach the hous at length
pass first through a street of the villag in which no on seem to
be awak a wretchedlook coupl thei stumbl up the step into
the porch where morri rang the bell for the door wa lock the time
seem an ag but at last step were heard the door wa unbar
and there appear a vision of the lad thoma yawn and clad in a
nightshirt and a pair of trouser with brace attach which dangl to
the floor
oh lord he said when he saw them and hi jaw drop
get out of the wai you young idiot said morri and call the cook
it wa halfpast seven in the even that is dinner time and morri
stood in the studi wait for stella who had announc through the
housemaid that she wa come down
after tell the servant to send for the doctor and attend to hi
companion who had insist upon be led straight to her father
room morriss first act that morn on reach home wa to take a
bath as hot as he could bear then he drank sever cup of coffe with
brandi in it and as the offic would soon be open wrote a telegram to
mari which ran thu
if you hear that i have been drown dont believ it have arriv
safe home after a night at sea
thi done for he guess that all sort of rumour would be abroad he
inquir after mr fregeliu and stella have learn that thei were
both go on well and sent off hi telegram morri went to bed and
slept for ten hour
morri look round the comfort sittingroom with it recess tudor
window it tall bookcas and open hearth where burn a bright fire
of old ship timber support on steel dog and thought to himself
that he wa fortun to be there then the door open he heard the
housemaid voic sai thi wai pleas miss and stella came in she
wore a plain white dress that seem to fit her veri well though where
she got it from he never discov and her luxuri hair wa twist
up into a simpl knot on the bosom of her dress wa fix a sprai of
brilliant ampelopsi leav it wa her onli ornament but none could
have been more strike for the rest although she limp and still
look dark and weari about the ey to all appear she wa not
much the wors for their terribl adventur
morri glanc at her could thi dignifi and love young ladi be
that redcloak loosehair valkyri whom he had seen sing at
daybreak upon the prow of the sink ship or the piteou bedraggl
person whom he had support from the altar in the dead church
she guess hi thoughtfrom the begin stella had thi curiou
power of discov hi mindand said with a smile
fine feather make fine bird and even cleopatra would have look
dread after a novemb night in an open boat
have you recov he ask
ye mr monk that is i dont think i am go to have inflamm
of the lung or anyth horrid of the sort the remedi and that walk
stop it but my feet ar peel from be soak so long in salt
water and my hand ar not much better see and she held them toward
him
then dinner wa announc and for the second time that dai thei walk
arminarm
it seem a littl strang doesnt it suggest morri as he survei
the great refectori in which thei two seat at the central tabl
look so lone and small
ye she answer but so it should anyth quit usual would have
been out of place todai
then he ask her how her father wa go on and heard what he had
alreadi learn from the doctor that he wa do as well as could be
expect
by the wai mr monk she ad if you can spare a few minut after
dinner and ar not too tire he would so much like to see you
of cours answer morri a littl nervous for he scent a
displai of fervent gratitud
after thi thei drop into desultori convers curious differ
from the intim talk which pass between them in the boat then
thei had been in danger and at time in the veri shadow of death a
condit that favour confid sinc those who stand beneath hi
wing no longer care to hide their heart the reserv which so larg
direct our live ar lift their necess is past and in the face of
the last act of natur natur assert herself who care to continu to
plai a part when the audienc ha dispers the curtain is fall and
the paybox ha put up it shutter now veri unexpectedli these two
were on the stage again and each assum the allot role
stella admir the room whereon morri set to work to explain it
characterist to find to hi astonish that miss fregeliu
had more knowledg of architectur than he could boast he point out
certain detail alleg them to be elizabethan work to which ag thei
had been credit for gener whereon she suggest and inde
prove that some of them date from the earlier year of henri viii
and that some were late jacobean while morri wa wonder how he
could combat thi revolutionari opinion the servant brought in a
telegram it wa from mari at beaulieu and ran
had not heard that you were drown but am deepli thank that you
ar save why did you pass a night at sea in thi weather is it a
riddl griev to sai my father not so well best love and pleas keep
on shore mari
at first morri wa angri with thi rather flippant messag then he
laugh as he had alreadi discov in fact hi anxieti had been
quit groundless the pageboi thoma it appear when question
had given the inquir to understand that hi master had gone out to
fish take hi breakfast with him later on hi nonappear
he amend thi statement suggest out of the depth of a fertil
imagin that he had sail down to northwold where he meant to
pass the night therefor although the cook a farse woman who
knew her thoma and hate him had experienc pang of doubt nobodi
els troubl the least and even the small commun of monksland
remain profoundli undisturb as to the fate of on of it princip
inhabit
so littl is an unsympathet world concern in our greatest and most
particular adventur a birth a marriag an inquest a scandalthes
move it superfici for the rest it ha no enthusiasm to spare thi
cold neglect of event which had seem to him so import react upon
morri who now that he had got over hi chill and fatigu saw them
in their proper proport a littl adventur in an open boat at sea
which had end without ani mishap wa not remark and might even
be made to appear ridicul so the less said about it especi to
mari whose wit he fear the better
when dinner wa finish stella left the room pass down it shadow
recess with a peculiar grace of which even her limp could not rob her
ten minut later while morri sat sip a glass of claret the nurs
came down to tell him that mr fregeliu would like to see him if he
were disengag reflect that he might as well get the interview
over morri follow her at onc to the abbot chamber where the sick
man lai
except for a singl lamp near the bed the place wa unlight but by
the fire it glow fall on her whitedrap form and pale uncommon
face sat stella as he enter she rose and come forward
accompani him to the bedsid sai in an earnest voic
father here is our host mr monk the gentleman who save my life at
the risk of hi own
the patient rais hi bandag head and stretch out a long thin hand
he could stir noth els for hi right thigh wa in splint beneath a
cofferlik erect design to keep the pressur of the blanket from
hi injur limb
sir i thank you he said in a dry staccato voic all the human
that is lack from the heart of those rude wretch the crew of the
trondhjem must have found it home in you
morri look at the dark quiet ey that seem to express much which
the thin and impass face refus to reveal at the grei point beard
and the yellowish skin of the outstretch arm here befor him he
felt lai a man whose person it wa not easi to defin on who
might be foolish or might be abl but of whose charact the lead
note wa retic inher or acquir then he took the hand and
said simpli
prai sai no more about it i act on an impuls and some wander
word of your with result for which i could not hope there is
noth to thank me for
then sir i thank god who inspir you with that impuls and mai
everi bless reward your braveri
stella look up as though to speak but chang her mind and return
to her seat by the fire
what is there to reward said morri impati that your daughter
is still aliv is my reward how ar you tonight mr fregeliu
chapter xi
a morn servic
mr fregeliu repli he wa as well as could be expect that the
doctor said no complic were like to ensu but that here upon
thi veri bed he must lie for at least two month that he ad is
a sad thing to have to sai to a man into whose hous you have drift
like a log into a pool of the rock
it is not my hous but my father who is at present in franc
answer morri but i can onli sai on hi behalf that both you and
your daughter ar most welcom until you ar well enough to move to the
rectori
why should i not go there at onc interrupt stella i could come
each dai and see my father
no no certainli not said morri how could you live alon in that
great empti hous
i am not afraid of be alon she answer smile but let it
be as you like mr monkat ani rate until you grow tire of us and
chang your mind
then mr fregeliu told morri what he had not yet heardthat when it
becam known that thei had desert stella leav her to drown in
the sink ship the attent of the inhabit of monksland to the
cowardli foreign sailor becam so mark that their consul at northwold
had thought it wise to get them out of the place as quickli as possibl
while thi stori wa in progress stella left the room to speak to the
nurs who had been engag to look after her father at night
afterward at the request of mr fregeliu morri told the tale of
hi daughter rescu in the cours of it he mention how he found her
stand on the deck of the sink ship and sing a nors song which
she had inform him wa an ancient deathdirg
the old clergyman turn hi head and sigh
what is the matter ask morri
noth mr monk onli that song is unlucki in my famili and i hope
that she had forgotten it
morri look at him blankli
you dont understandhow should you but mr monk there ar strang
thing and strang peopl in thi world and i think that my daughter
stella is on of the strangest of them fei like the restonli a fei
nors woman would sing in such a moment
again morri look at him
oh it is an old northern term and mean forese and foredoom
to my knowledg her grandmoth her mother and her sister all three
of them sang or repeat that song when in some immin danger to
their live and all three of them were dead within the year the
coincid is unpleas
sure said morri with a smile you who ar a clergyman can
scarc believ in such superstit
no i am not superstiti and i dont believ in it but the thing
recal unhappi memori thei have been deathlov all of them i
never heard of a case of on of that famili who show the slightest
fear at the approach of death and some have greet it with eager
well said morri would not that mean onli that their spiritu
sight is a littl clearer than our and their faith a littl stronger
theoret we should all of us wish to die
quit so yet we ar human and dont but she is safe thank to
you who but for you would now be gone my head is still weak from
that blowyou must pai no attent to me i think that i hear stella
come you will sai noth to herabout that song i meanwil you
we never talk of it in my famili
when still stiff and sore from hi adventur in the open boat morri
went to bed it wa clear to hi mind after care consider that
fortun had made him the host of an exceedingli strang coupl of
mr fregeliu he wa soon abl to form an estim distinct enough
although for aught he knew it might be erron the clergyman
struck him as a person of some abil who had been doom to much
disappoint and suffer from mani sorrow doubtless hi talent
had not prove to be of a natur to advanc him in the world probabl
indeedand here morriss hazard wa correcth wa a scholar and
a bookworm without individu to whom fate had assign minor
posit in a profess which howev sincer hi faith he wa
scarc fit to adorn
the work of a clergyman in a countri parish if it is to succe should
be essenti practic and thi man wa not practic clearli
thought morri he wa on of those who beat their wing against the
bar with the common result it wa the wing that suffer the bar
onli grew a trifl brighter then it seem that he had lost a wife to
whom he wa attach and the child who remain to him although he
love her and clung to her he did not altogeth understand so it came
about perhap that he had fallen under the curs of loneli and
continu apprehens and in thi shadow where he wa doom to walk
flourish forebod and regret draw their strength from hi
starv natur like fungi from a tree outgrown and fallen in the forest
mr fregeliu so thought morri wa timid and retic becaus he
dare not discov hi heart that had been so sore trampl by fate
and fortun yet he had a heart which if he could find a confessor whom
he could trust he long to eas in confid for the rest the man
physic frame not too robust at ani time wa shatter and with it
hi nervesudden shipwreck pain accid the fierc altern
of hope and fear then at last a delirium of joi at the recoveri of on
whom he thought dead had done their work with him and in thi broken
state some ancient secret superstit becam domin and strive as
he would to suppress it even in the presenc of a stranger had burst
from hi lip in hint of unsubstanti folli
such wa the father or such he appear to morri but of the daughter
what could be said without doubt she wa a woman of strang and
impress power at thi veri moment her sweet voic touch with that
continu note of plead still echo in hi brain and the dark
quiet ey that now slept and now shone larg as her thought fled
through them like some mysteri sky at night in which the summer
lightn puls intermitt who might forget those ey that onc
had seen them alreadi he wish to be rid of their haunt and could
not then her beautyhow unusu it wa yet how rich and satisfi to
the ey and sens in some wai almost eastern notwithstand her nors
blood
often morri had read or heard of the bewild power of women which
for hi part hitherto he had been inclin to attribut to shallow and
veri common caus such as underli all anim natur yet that of
stellafor undoubtedli she had powersuggest anoth interpret
to hi mind or wa it after all noth but a variant on of the
protean shape of the ancient lifecompel mysteri and her strang
chant the song of which her father made light but fear so much her
quick insight into the work of hi own thought her courag in the
face of danger and sharp physic miseri her charm her masteri what
wa he to make of them lastli why did he think so much about her
it wa not hi habit where stranger were concern and why had she
awaken in hi somewhat solitari and seclud mind a sympathi so
unusu that it seem to him that he had known her for year and not
for hour
ponder these thing and the fact that perhap within the come week
he would find out their mean morri went to sleep when he awok
next morn hi mood had chang somewhat vagu he rememb hi
perturb of the previou night inde but now thei onli move him
to a smile their reason were so obviou such exagger estim
and thought follow strang adventuresand in all it detail
thi adventur wa veri strangea natur as nightmar follow
indigest
present thoma came to call him and brought up hi letter among
them on from mari contain noth in particular for of cours
it had been despatch befor her telegram but written in her usual
humor style which made him laugh aloud
there wa a postscript to the letter screw into the unoccupi space
between the date line and the dearest morri at it commenc it
ran
how would you like to spend our honeymoon in a yacht in the
mediterranean i think that would do there is noth like solitud in
a wretch littl boat to promot mutual understand if your
devot could stand the strain of a dishevel and seasick spous our
matrimoni futur ha no terror for your love mari
as morri read he ceas to laugh ye he thought to himself
solitud in a wretch littl boat doe promot mutual understand
i am not certain that it doe not promot it too much then with an
access of irrit bother the peopl i wish i could be rid of them
the whole thing seem like to becom a worri
next he took up a letter from hi father which when perus did not
entertain him in the least there wa noth about ladi rawlin in it
of whom he long to hear or thought that he did noth about that
entranc person the bibul and violent sir jonah now so meek
and lamblik but plenti whole page inde as to detail connect
with the estat also it contain a goodli sprinkl of sarcasm and
grumbl at hi morriss bad manag of variou littl matter
which the colonel consid import most of all howev wa hi
parent indign at hi neglect to furnish him with detail suffici
ampl of the progress of the new build lastli he desir by
return of post a verbatim report of the quarrel that as he wa
inform had occur on the school board when a promin roman
cathol threaten to throw an inkstand at a dissent minist who
coram populo call him the son of a babylonian woman
by the time that morri had finish thi epistl and two other
which accompani it he wa in no mood for further reflect of an
unpract or dreami natur who can wonder when it is state that
thei contain respect a summari demand for the amount of a
consider bill which he imagin he had paid and a request that he
would read a paper befor a scienc institut upon the possibl
of aerial telephon made by a veri unpleas ladi whom he had onc
met at a lawntenni parti inde it would not be too much to sai that
if anyon had given him the opportun he would have welcom a chanc
to quarrel especi with the ladi of the local institut thu cure
of all moral distemp and everi tendenc to specul on feminin
charm hidden or overt did he descend to the sabbath breakfast
that morn morri accompani stella to church where the servic
were still be perform by a stopgap left by mr tomlei here
again stella wa a surpris to him for now her demeanour and at a
littl distanc her appear also were just such as mark ninetyeight
out of everi hundr clergyman daughter in the countri so quiet
and reserv wa she that anyon meet her that morn might have
imagin that she wa hurri from the accustom bibleclass to sit
among her pupil in the church thi impress inde wa as it were
certif by an oldfashion silk fichu that she had been oblig to
borrow which in bygon year had been worn by morriss mother
onc in church howev matter chang to begin with find it
warm stella threw off the fichu greatli to the gain of her person
appear next it becam evid that the beauti of the ancient
build appeal to her which wa not wonder for these old
seasid eastern counti church relic of long past wealth and
pieti ar some of them among the most beauti in the world then came
the venit of which here and there she sang a line or so just on
or two rich note like those that a thrush utter befor he burst into
full song rare as thei might be howev thei caus those about her
in the church to look at the strang singer wonderingli
after thi in the absenc of hi father morri read the lesson and
although be bless with a good voic thi wa a duti which he
perform credit enough that dai he went through it with a certain
sens of nervous why he wa nervou at first he did not guess
till chanc to glanc up he becam awar that miss fregeliu wa
look at him out of her halfclos ey what is more she wa
listen critic and with much intens whereupon instantli
he made a mistak and put a fals accent on a name
in due cours the lesson done with thei reach the first hymn which
wa on that scarc seem to pleas hi companion at ani rate
she shut the book and would not sing in the case of the second hymn
howev matter were differ thi time she did not even open the
book it wa evid that she knew the word perhap among the most
beauti in the whole collect by heart the reader will probabl be
acquaint with them thei begin
and now o father mind of the love
that bought us onc for all on calvari tree
at first stella sang quit low as though she wish to repress her
power now as it happen at monksland the choir wa feebl but
inoffens wherea the organ wa a good if a worn and neglect
instrument suit to the great but spars peopl church and the
organist a man who had music in hi soul low as she wa sing he
caught the sound of stella voic and knew at onc that befor him wa
a woman who in a suprem degre possess the divinest gift perhap
with which natur can crown her sex the power and gift of song
forget hi wretch choir he began to plai to her she seem to
note the invit and at onc answer to it
look father look on hi anoint face
swell from her throat in deep contralto note rich as those the organ
echo
but the full glori of the thing that surpass music which set
monksland talk for a week wa not reach till she came to the third
vers perhap the pure passion and abound human of it spirit
move her perhap by thi time she wa the thrall of her own song
perhap she had caught the look of wonder and admir on the face
of morri and wa determin to show him that she had other music at
command besid that of pagan deathchant at least she sang up and
out till her note domin those of the choir which seem to be but
an accompani to them till thei beat against the ancient roof and
down the depth of the long nave to be echo back as though from the
golden trumpet of the angel that stood abov the tower screen till
even the villag children ceas from whisper and plai to listen
openmouth
and then for those our dearest and best
by thi prevail presenc we appeal
o fold them closer to thy merci breast
o do thine utmost for their soul true weal
from taint mischief keep them white and clear
and crown thy gift with strength to persever
it wa as her voic linger upon the deep tone of these last word
that suddenli stella seem to becom awar that practic she wa
sing a solo that at ani rate no on els in the congreg wa
contribut a note then she wa vex or perhap a panic took her
at least not anoth word of that hymn pass her lip in vain the
organist paus and look round indignantli the littl boi the
clerk and the stout coachbuild were left to finish it by themselv
with result that by contrast were pain
when stella came out of church redrap in the antiqu and unbecom
fichu she found herself the object of consider attent inde
upon on pretext and anoth nearli all the congreg seem to
be linger about the porch and pathwai to stare at the new parson
shipwreck daughter when she appear among them wa miss layard
and with her the delic brother thei were stai to lunch with the
stopgap meek littl wife inde thi selfsatisfi and somewhat
acrimoni ladi miss layard engag morri in convers and
pointedli ask him to introduc her to miss fregeliu
we ar to be neighbour you know she explain for we live at the
hall in the next parish not more than a mile awai
inde answer stella who did not seem much impress
my brother and i hope to call upon mr fregeliu and yourself as
soon as possibl but i thought i would not wait for that to have the
pleasur of make your acquaint
you ar veri kind inde said stella simpli at present i am
afraid it is not much us call upon my father as he is in bed with
a broken thigh also we ar not at the rectori until he can be move
we ar onli guest at the abbei and she look at morri who ad
rather grumpili by wai of explan
of cours miss layard you have heard about the wreck of the
trondhjem and how those foreign sailor saw the light in my workshop
and brought mr fregeliu to the abbei
oh ye mr monk and how thei left miss fregeliu behind and you
went to fetch her and all sort of strang thing happen to you we
think it quit wonder and romant i am write to dear miss porson
to tell her about it becaus i am sure that you ar too modest to sing
your own prais
morri grew angri at the best of time he dislik miss layard now
he began to detest her and to long for the presenc of mari who
understood how to deal with that not too wellbr young person
you realli neednt have troubl he answer i have alreadi
written
then my epistl will prove a us commentari if i were engag to a
modern hero i am sure i could not hear too much about him and fix
her ey upon the black silk fichu the heroin of the adventur
meanwhil stella wa be engag by the brother who survei her
with pale admir ey which did not confin their attent to the
fichu
monk is alwai an awfulli lucki fellow he said just fanci hi
get the chanc of do all that and find you wait on the
ship at the end of it he ad with desper and emphat gallantri
there to be a whole column about it in the northwold time
tomorrow i wish the thing had come my wai that all
unless you understand how to manag a boat in a heavi sea and the
wind and tide of thi coast thoroughli i dont think that you should
wish that mr layard said stella
why not he ask sharpli as a matter of fact the littl man wa a
miser sailor and suspect her of poke fun at him
becaus you would have been drown mr layard and ly at the
bottom of the north sea among the dogfish and congereel thi morn
instead of sit comfort in church
mr layard start and stare at her evid thi ladi imagin
wa as vivid as it wa suggest
i sai miss fregeliu he said you dont put thing veri
pleasantli
no i am afraid not but then drown isnt pleasant i have been near
it veri late and i thought a great deal about those congereel
and sudden death isnt pleasant and perhapsunless you ar veri
veri good as i daresai you arewhat come after it mai not be quit
pleasant all of which ha to be thought of befor on goe to sea in
an open boat in winter on the remotest chanc of save a stranger
lifehasnt it
somehow mr layard felt distinctli smaller
i daresai on wouldnt mind it at a pinch he mutter monk isnt
the onli plucki fellow in the world
i am sure you would not mr layard repli stella in a gentler
voic still these thing must be consid upon such occas and a
good mani other
a brave man doesnt think he act persist mr layard
no repli stella a foolish man doesnt think a brave man think
and see and still actsat least that is how it strike me although
perhap i have no right to an opinion but mr monk is go on so i
must sai goodmorn
ar mani of the ladi about here so inquisit and the young
gentlemen sodecid she wa go to sai but chang the word to
kindask stella of morri as thei walk homeward
ladi snap morri miss layard isnt a ladi and never will be
she ha neither birth nor breed onli good look of a sort and monei
i should like he ad viciouslyi should like to shut her into her
own coal mine
stella laugh which wa a rare thing with herusu she onli
smileda she answer
i had no idea you were so vindict mr monk and what would you like
to do with mr layard
oh inev thought much about him he is an ignor uneduc
littl fellow but worth two of hi sister all the same after all
he got a heart i have known him do kind thing but she ha noth
but a temper
meanwhil at the luncheon tabl of the stopgap the new and mysteri
arriv miss fregeliu wa the subject of fierc debat
pretti i dont call her pretti said miss layard she ha fine ey
that is all and thei do not look quit right what an extraordinari
garment she had on too it might have come out of noah ark
i fanci suggest the hostess a mild littl woman that it came out
of the wardrob of the late mr monk you know miss fregeliu lost all
her thing in that ship
then if i were she i should have stop at home until i got some new
on snap miss layard
perhap everybodi doesnt think so much about cloth as you do
eliza suggest her brother stephen see an opportun which he
wa loth to lose eliza in the privaci of domest life wa not a
person to be assail with a light heart but in compani when to some
extent she must keep her temper under control more might be dare
she shift her chair a littl with her a familiar sign of war and
while search for a reparte which would be suffici crush
cast on stephen a glanc that might have turn wine into vinegar
somewhat tremul for unless the fire could be damp befor it got
full hold she knew what thei might expect the littl hostess broke in
with
what a beauti sing voic she ha hasnt she
who ask eliza pretend not to understand
why miss fregeliu of cours
oh well that is a matter of opinion
hang it all eliza said her brother there cant be two opinion
about it she sing like an angel
do you think so stephen i should have said she sing like an opera
dancer
alwai understood that their gift lai in their leg and not in
their throat but perhap you mean a prima donna remark stephen
reflect
no i dont prima donna ar not in the habit of screech at the
top of their voic and then stop suddenli to make an effect and
attract attent
certainli she ha attract my attent and i onli wish i could
hear such screech everi dai it would be a great chang it mai
be explain that the layard were music and that each detest the
music of the other
realli stephen rejoin eliza with sarcasm as awkward as it wa
meant to be crush i shall have to tell jane rose that she is
dethron poor dearbeaten out of the field by a hymntun a pair of
brown ey anda black silk fichu
thi wa a venom stab sinc for a distanc of ten mile round
everyon with ear to hear knew that stephen admir of miss rose
had not end prosper for stephen the poison knife sank deep
and it smart drove the littl paleei man to furi
you can tell her what you like eliza he repli for hi
selfcontrol wa utterli gone but it wont be much us for shell
know what you mean shell know that you ar jealou of miss fregeliu
becaus she so good look just as you ar jealou of her and
of mari porson and of anybodi els who dare to be pretti and with
crush mean to look at morri monk
eliza gasp then said in a tragic whisper stephen you insult me
oh if onli we were at home i would tell you
i have no doubt you wouldyou often do but im not go home at
present i am go to the northwold hotel
realli broke in their hostess almost wring her hand thi is
sundai mr layard rememb thi is sundai
i am not like to forget it repli the madden stephen but over
the rest of thi edifi scene we will drop a veil
thu did the advent of stella bring with it surpris rumour and
famili dissens what els it brought remain to be told
chapter xii
mr layard woo
the dai went by with an unev swift at the abbei and after he
had onc accustom himself to the strang of what wa in effect
solitud in the hous with an unmarri guest of the other sex it mai
be admit veri pleasantli to morri at first that rather remark
young ladi stella had alarm him somewhat so that he convinc
himself that the duti of thi novel hospit would prove irksom
as a matter of fact howev in fortyeight hour the irksom wa
all gone to be replac within twice that period by an atmospher of
complet understand which wa comfort to hi fear soul
the young ladi wa never in the wai now that she had procur some
suitabl cloth the young ladi wa distinctli good look she wa
remark intellig and wellread she sang as stephen layard
had said like an angel she took a most enlighten interest in
aerophon and their possibl she prove a veri us assist
in variou experi and made on or two valuabl suggest while
mari and the rest of them were awai the place would realli be dull
without her and somehow he could not be as sorri as he ought when
dr charter told him that old mr fregeliuss bone were unit with
exceed slow
such were the conclus which on by on took shape in the mind of
that illstar man morri monk as yet howev let the student
of hi histori understand thei were not ting with the slightest
arrierepense he did not guess even that such relat as alreadi
exist between stella and himself might lead to grievou troubl that
at least thei were scarc wise in the case of a man engag
all he felt all he knew wa that he had found a charm companion a
woman whose thought if deeper or at ani rate differ to hi and not
altogeth to be follow wa in tune with hi he could not alwai
catch her mean and yet that unrealis mean would appeal to
him himself a veri spiritu man and a humbl seeker after truth
hi natur did intuit rever to on who appear to be still more
spiritu who as he conjectur at time at ani rate had discov
some portion of the truth he believ it although she had never told
him so inde that semimyst side of stella whereof at first she
had shown him glimps seem to be quit in abey she dream no
more dream she saw no more vision or if she did she kept them to
herself yet to him thi woman seem to be in touch with that unseen
which he found it so difficult to weigh and appreci instinct he
felt that her best thought her most nobl and perman desir were
there and not here
as he had said to her in the boat the old egyptian live to die in
life a clai hut wa for them a suffici lodg in death thei sought
a costli sculptur tomb hewn from the live rock with them these
thing were symbol sinc that great peopl believ with a
wonder certainti that the true life lai beyond thei believ too
that on the earth thei did but linger in it gatewai pass their time
with such joi as thei could summon bare their head undismai to the
rain of sorrow becaus thei knew that veri soon thei would be crown
with etern joi whereof each of these sorrow wa but an earthli
root
stella fregeliu remind morri of these old egyptian inde had
he wish to carri the comparison from her spiritu to her physic
attribut it still might have been consid apt for in face she wa
somewhat eastern let the reader examin the portrait bust of the great
queen taia cloth with it mysteri smile which adorn the museum
in cairo and given fair instead of duski skin with certain other
minor differ he will behold no mean like to stella fregeliu
howev thi mai be for if morri saw the resembl there were other
who could not agre with him doubtless although not an eastern ancient
or modern she wa ting with the fatal of the east mingl with a
certain contempt of death inherit perhap from her northern ancestor
and an activ pervad spiritu that wa all her own yet her
manner were not gloomi nor her air tragic for he found her an
excel companion fond of children and flower and at time merri in
her own fashion but thi gaieti of her alwai remind morri of that
which is said to have prevail in the dai of the terror among those
destin to the guillotin never for on hour did she seem to forget
the end vaniti of vaniti saith the preacher and that lesson wa
her watchword
on even thei were walk togeth upon the cliff in the west the
sun had sunk leav a pale lemoncolour glow upon the sky then far
awai over the quiet sea show bright and larg in that frosti air
sprang out a singl star stella halt in her walk and look first
at the sunset heaven next at the solemn sea and last at that bright
particular star set like a diadem of power upon the brow of advanc
night morri watch her saw the blood mantl to her pale face
while the dark ey grew larg and lumin proud too and full of
secret strength at length hi curios got the better of him
what ar you think of he ask
do you wish me to tell you
ye if you will
you will laugh at me
yesa i laugh at that sky and sea and star
well then i wa think of the old etern differ between the
present and the futur
you mean between life and death queri morri and she nod
answer
between life and death and how littl peopl see or think of it thei
just live and forget that beneath them lie their father bone thei
forget that in some few daysperhap more perhap lessoth unknown
creatur will be stand abov their forgotten bone as blind
as selfseek as puf up with the pride of the brief moment and
fill with the despair of their failur the glori of their success as
thei ar tonight
perhap suggest morri thei sai that while thei ar in the world
it is well to be of the world that when thei belong to the next it will
be time to consid it i am not sure that thei ar not right i have
heard that view he ad rememb a certain convers with
mari
oh dont think that she answer almost imploringli for it is not
true realli it is not true of cours the next world belong to all
but our lot in it doe not come to us by right that must be earn
the old doctrin of our faith suggest morri
ye but as i believ there is more behind more which we ar not
told that we must find out for ourselv with groan which cannot
be utter by hope we ar save did not st paul hint at it
what do you mean
i mean that as our spirit sow so shall it reap as it imagin and
desir so shall it inherit it is here that the soul must grow not
there as the child come into the world with a natur alreadi form
and it blood fill with gift of strength or weak so shall the
spirit come into it world wear the garment that it ha woven and
which it cannot chang
the garment which it ha woven said morri that mean free will
and how doe free will chime in with your fatal miss fregeliu
perfectli the materi given us to weav with that is fate the time
which is allot for the task that is fate again but the pattern is
our own here ar brush here is pigment so much of it of such and
such colour and here is light to work by now paint your pictur
sai the master paint swiftli with such skill as you can not know
how long is allot for the task and so we weav and so we paint
everi on of useveri on of us
what is your pictur miss fregeliu tell me if you will
she laugh and drew herself up mine oh it is larg it is to reign
like that star it is to labour forward from ag to ag at the great
task that god shall set me to return and bow befor hi throne cry
it is done behold is the work good for the hour that thei endur
it is still to be with those whom i have love on earth although thei
cannot see me to sooth their sorrow to support their weak to
lull their fear it is that the empti long and daili prayer mai be
fill and fill and fill again like a cup from a stream which
never ceas
and what is that daili prayer ask morri look at her
o god touch me with thy light and give me understandingy
understandingth word enclos all i seek she repli then
check herself ad in a chang voic come let us go home it is
foolish to talk long of such thing
shortli after thi curiou convers which wa never renew between
them or at least but onc a new element enter into the drama the
necessari semicom element without which everyth would be so dull
thi fresh factor wa the infatu which possibl the reader mai
have foreseen of the suscept impuls littl man stephen layard
for stella fregeliu the ladi whose sing he had admir and who
had been a caus of war between him and hi sister like mani weak men
stephen layard wa obstin also from boyhood up he had suffer
much at the hand of eliza who wa not in fact quit so young as
she look henc there aros in hi breast a veri natur desir for
retali eliza had taken a violent dislik to miss fregeliu whom
he thought charm thi circumst in their strain relat wa
reason enough to induc stephen to pai court to her even if hi natur
inclin had not made the adventur veri congeni
therefor on the first opportun he call at the abbei to ask after
the rector to be as he had hope receiv by stella find hi
visit exceedingli agreeabl after a dai or two he repeat it and
thi time wa conduct to the old clergyman bedroom upon whom hi
civil made a good impress
now as it happen although he did not live in monksland mr layard
wa on of the largest properti owner in the parish a circumst
which he did not fail to impress upon the new rector be by natur
and train a hardwork man who wish to do hi best for hi cure
even while he lai helpless mr fregeliu welcom the advanc of thi
wealthi young gentleman with enthusiasm especi when he found that
he wa no niggard a piec of land wa want for the cemeteri mr
layard offer to present an acr monei wa lack to pai off a debt
upon the readingroom mr layard head the subscript list with a
handsom sum and so forth
now the detail of these variou arrang could not conveni be
settl without mani interview and thu veri soon it came about that
scarc a dai went by upon which mr layard dogcart did not pass
through the abbei gate gener he came in the morn and stop to
lunch or he came in the afternoon and stop to tea in fact or thu
it seem to morri he alwai stop to someth so much so that
although not lack in hospit at time morri found hi presenc
wearisom for in truth the two men had noth in common
he must have turn over a new leaf with a vengeanc for he never
would give a sixpenc to anyth dure old tomlei time remark
morri to stella i suppos that he ha taken a great fanci to your
father which is a good thing for the parish as those layard ar
richer than croesu
ye answer stella with a curiou littl smile
but to herself she did not smile for if morri found hi visitor a
bore to stella he wa noth short of an inflict increas rather
than mitig by numer present of hothous fruit and flower
offer to herself and entail each of them an express of thank
verbal or written at first she treat the thing as a joke till it
grew evid that her admir wa as much in earnest as hi natur would
permit thereon forese eventu she becam alarm
unless some mean could be found to stop him it wa now clear to
stella that mr layard meant to propos to her and as she had not the
slightest intent of accept him thi wa an honour which she did
not seek but she could find no suffici mean hint and even snub
onli seem to add fuel to the fire and of a perpetu game of hide and
seek she grew weari
so it came about that at last she shrug her shoulder and left thing
to take their chanc find some consol for her discomfort in
the knowledg that miss layard convinc that the rector daughter wa
lure her inexperienc brother into an evil matrimoni net could
in no wise restrain her rage and indign so openli did thi ladi
express her view inde that at length a report of them reach even
morriss inattent ear whereon he wa at first veri angri and then
burst out laugh that a man like stephen layard should hope to marri
a woman like stella fregeliu seem to him so absurd as to be almost
unnatur yet when he came to think it over quietli he wa constrain
to admit to himself that the match would have mani advantag for the
young ladi whereof the first and foremost were that stephen wa veri
rich and although slangi and without educ in it better sens at
heart by no mean a bad littl fellow so morri shrug hi shoulder
shut hi ey continu to dispens luncheon and afternoon tea and
though with an uneasi mind like stella herself allow thing to take
their chanc
all thi while howev hi own friendship with stella grew apac
enhanc as it wa in no small degre by the fact that now her help in
hi scientif oper had becom most valuabl inde it appear
that he wa destin to ow the final success of hi instrument to the
assist of women who at the begin at ani rate knew littl of
it principl mari it mai be rememb by some fortun chanc
made the suggest as to the substanc of the receiv which turn
the aerophon from a great idea into a practic realiti now to
complet the work it wa stella not by accid but after care
studi of it problem who gave the thought that led to the remov of the
on remain obstacl to it gener and success establish
to test thi new develop of the famou sound deflector and perfect
it detail score of experi were need most of which he and she
carri out togeth thi wa their plan on of them establish him
or herself in the ruin build known as the dead church while the
other took up a posit in the abbei workshop from these respect
point a distanc of about two mile thei test the machin with
result that dai by dai grew better and clearer till at length under
these condit thei were almost perfect
strang wa the experi and great the triumph when at last morri
seat in the abbei with hi apparatu befor him unconnect with it
twin by ani visibl medium wa abl without interrupt for a whole
morn to convers with stella establish in the dead church
it is done he cri in unusu exult now if i die tomorrow
it doe not matter
instantli came the answer in stella voic
i am veri happi if i do noth els i have help a man to fame
then a hitch aros the inevit hitch it wa found that in certain
state of the atmospher and sometim at fix hour of the dai the
sound come from the receiv were almost inaud at other time
again the motiv forc seem to be so extraordinarili activ that the
sound deflector notwithstand the instrument captur and transmit
a thousand nois which ar not to be heard by the unobserv listen
or in some case by ani human ear
weird enough these nois were at time like great sigh thei came
like the moan of the breez brought from an infinit distanc like
mutter and groan arisen from the veri bowel of the earth then
there were the splash or boom of the wave the pipe of the seawind
the cry of curlew or blackback gull all mingl in on great and
tangl skein of sound that choke the voic of the speaker and in
their aggreg bewild him who hearken
these and other which need not be detail were problem that had
to be met necessit mani more experi thu it came about that
through most of the short hour of winter daylight morri and stella
found themselv at their respect posit correspond or try
to correspond through the aerophon if the weather wa veri bad
or veri cold morri went to the dead church otherwis that post wa
allot to stella both becaus it wa more conveni that morri
should stai in hi laboratori and by her own choic
two princip reason caus her to prefer to pass as much of her time
as wa possibl in thi desol and unvisit spot first becaus mr
layard wa less like to find her when he call and secondli that
for her it had a strang fascin inde she love the place
cloth as it wa with a thousand memori of those who had been human
like herself but nowwer not she would read the inscript upon
the chancel stone and studi the coatsofarm and name of those
depart try to give to each lost man and woman a shape and
charact till at length she knew all the monument by appear as
well as by the name inscrib upon them
on of these dead oddli enough had been name stella ethel smyth
daughter of sir thoma smyth whose famili live at the old hall now
in the possess of the layard thi stella had di at the ag of
twentyf in the year 1741 and her tombston record that in mind
she wa clean and sweet and in bodi beauti also at the foot of it
wa a doggerel couplet written probabl by her bereav father which
ran
though here my star seem set
i know twill light me yet
stella the live stella thought these simpl word veri touch and
point them out to morri he agre with her and tri in the record
of the parish and elsewher to discov some detail about the dead
girl life but quit without avail
that all that left he said on dai nod hi head at the
tombston the star is quit set
i know twill light me yet murmur hi companion as she turn
awai to the work in hand sometim she went on as i sit here at
dusk listen to all the strang sound which come from that receiv
i fanci that i can hear stella and her poor father talk while thei
watch me onli i cannot understand their languag
ah said morri if that were right we should have found a mean of
commun from the dead and with the unseen world at larg
why not ask stella
i dont know i have thought of it he answer and the subject
drop
on afternoon stella wrap in thick cloak wa seat in the chancel
of the dead church attend to the instrument which stood upon the
stone altar morri had not wish her to go that morn for the
weather wa veri coars and snow threaten but anticip a visit
from mr layard she insist sai that she should enjoi the walk
now the experi were in progress and go beautifulli in order to
test the aerophon fulli in thi rough weather morri and stella had
agre to read to each other altern vers from the book of job
begin at the thirtyeighth chapter
canst thou bind the sweet influenc of pleiad or loos the band
of orion read stella present in her rich clear voic
instantli from two mile awai came the next vers the sound of those
splendid word roll down the old church like echo of some lesson
read gener sinc
canst thou bring forth mazzaroth in hi season or canst thou guid
arcturu with hi son
so it went on for a few more vers till just as the instrument wa
sai who hath put wisdom in the inward part or who hath given
understand to the heart the rude door in the brick partit
open admit a rush of wind andstephen layard
the littl man sidl up nervous to where stella wa sit on a
campstool by the altar
how do you do said stella hold out her hand and look
surpris
how do you do miss fregeliu whatwhat ar you do in thi
dreadfulli cold place on such a bitter dai
befor she could answer the voic of morri anxiou and irrit for
as the next vers did not follow he conclud that someth had gone
wrong with the apparatu rang through the church ask
who hath put wisdom in the inward part or who hath given
understand to the heart
good graciou said mr layard i had no idea that monk wa here i
left him at the abbei where is he
at the abbei answer stella as for the second time the voic of
morri roll out the question from the book
i dont understand said stephen begin to look frighten ha
it anyth to do with hi electr experi
stella nod then address the instrument said
pleas stop read for a while mr layard is call here
confound him came the swift answer let me know when he is gone he
said he wa go home whereon stella switch off befor wors thing
happen
mr layard who had heard these word began a confus explan till
stella broke in
pleas dont apologis you chang your mind and we all do that but
i am afraid thi is a cold place to come to
you ar right there why on earth do you sit here so long
to work mr layard
why should you work i thought women hate it and abov all why for
monk doe he pai you
i work becaus i like work and shall go on work till i die and
afterward i hope also these experi interest me veri much mr
monk doe not pai me i have never ask him to do so inde it is i
who am in hi debt for all the kind he ha shown to my father and
myself to ani littl assist that i can give him he is welcom
i see said mr layard but i should have thought that wa mari
porson job you know he is engag to her dont you
ye but miss porson is not here and if she were perhap she would
not care for thi particular work
then came a paus which not know what thi awkward silenc might
breed stella broke
i suppos you saw my father she said how did you find him look
oh better i thought but that leg of hi still seem veri bad then
with a gasp and a great effort he went on i have been speak to him
about you
inde said stella look at him with wonder ey
ye and he sai that ifit suit us both he is quit will that
in fact he would be veri pleas to see you so well provid for
stella could not sai that she did not understand the falsehood wa too
obviou so she mere went on look a circumst from which mr
layard drew fals auguri
you know what i mean dont you he jerk out
she shook her head
i meani mean that i love you that you have given me what thi horrid
thing wa talk about just nowunderstand to the heart ye
that it understand to the heart will you marri me stella i will
make you a good husband and it isnt a bad place and all that and
though your father sai he ha littl to leav you you will be treat
as liber as though you were a ladi in your own right
stella smile a littl
will you marri me he ask again
i am afraid that i must answer no mr layard
then the poor man broke out into a rhapsodi of bitter disappoint
genuin emot and passion entreati
it is no us mr layard said stella at last inde i am much
oblig to you you have paid me a great compliment but it is not
possibl that i should becom your wife and the sooner that is clear
the better for us both
ar you engag he ask
no mr layard and probabl i never shall be i have my own idea
about matrimoni and the condit under which i would undertak it ar
not at all like ever to be within my reach
again he imploredfor at the time thi woman realli held hi
heartwring hi hand and inde weep in the agoni of a
repuls which wa the more dread becaus it wa quit unexpect
he had scarc imagin that thi poor clergyman daughter who had
littl but her look and a sweet voic would realli refus the best
match for twenti mile round nor had hi convers with her father
suggest to hi mind ani such idea
it wa true that mr fregeliu had given him no absolut encourag
he had said that person the marriag would be veri pleas to
himself but that it wa a matter of which stella must judg and
when ask whether he would speak to hi daughter he had emphat
declin still stephen layard had taken thi to be all a part of the
patern formula and rejoic think the matter as good as settl
dread inde then wa it to him when he found that he wa call
upon to contempl the dull obvers of hi shield of faith and not
it bright and shine face in which he had seen mirror so clear a
pictur of perfect happi
so he beg on piteous enough till at last stella wa forc to stop
him by sai as gentli as she could
pleas spare us both mr layard i have given my answer and i am
sorri to sai that it is imposs for me to go back upon my word
then a sudden furi seiz him
you ar in love with somebodi els he said you ar in love with
morri monk and he is a villain when he is engag to go take you
too i know it
then mr layard said stella strive to keep her temper you know
more than i know myself
veri like he answer i never said you knew it but it true
for all that i feel it herewher you will feel it on dai to your
sorrowand he place hi hand upon hi heart
a sudden terror took hold of her but with difficulti she found her
mental balanc
i hope mr layard she said that we might have part friend but
how can we when you bring such accus
i retract them broke in the distract man you mustnt think
anyth of what i said it is onli the pain that ha made me mad for
god sake at least let us part friend for then perhap some dai we
mai come togeth again
stella shook her head sadli and gave him her hand which he cover
with kiss then reel in hi gait like on drunken the unhappi
suitor depart into the fall snow
mechan stella switch on the instrument and at onc morriss
voic wa heard ask
i sai hasnt he gone
ye she said
thank good why on earth did you keep him gossip all that time
now thenwho can number the cloud in wisdom
not mr layard or i thought stella sadli to herself as she call
back the answer vers
chapter xiii
two question and the answer
at length the light began to fade and for that dai their experi
were over in token of their conclus twice stella rang the electr
warn bell which wa attach to the aerophon and in some mysteri
manner caus the bell of it twin instrument to ring also then she
pack the apparatu in it box for with it batteri it wa too
heavi and too delic to be carri conveni lock it up and
left the church which she also lock behind her outsid it wa still
snow fast but softli for the wind had drop and a sharp frost
wa set in caus the fallen snow to scrunch beneath her feet
about halfwai along the bleak line of desert cliff which stretch
from the dead church to the first hous of monksland she saw the
figur of a man walk swiftli toward her and knew from the bent
head and broad slightli stoop shoulder that it wa morri come to
escort her home present thei met
why did you not wait for me he ask in an irrit voic i told
you i wa come and you know that i do not like you to be tramp
about these lone cliff at thi hour
it is veri kind of you she answer smile that slow soft smile
which wa characterist of her when she wa pleas a smile that
seem to be born in her beauti ey and thenc to irradi her
whole face but it wa grow dreari and cold there so i thought that
i would start
ye he answer i forgot and what is more it is veri selfish of
me to keep you coop up in such a place upon a winter dai enthusiasm
make on forget everyth
at least without it we should do noth besid pleas do not piti
me for i have never been happier in my life
i am most grate he said earnestli i dont know what i should
have done without you through thi critic time or what i shall
and he stop
it went beautifulli todai didnt it she broke in as though she had
not heard hi word
ye he answer beyond all expect we must experi over a
greater distanc and then if the thing still work i shall be abl to
speak with my critic in the gate you know i have kept everyth as
dark as possibl up to the present for it is foolish to talk first and
fail afterward i prefer to succe first and talk afterward
what a triumph it will be said stella all those clever scientist
will arriv prepar to mock then think thei ar taken in and at last
go awai astonish to write column upon column in the paper
and after that queri morri
oh after that honour and glori and wealth and power andth happi
end doesnt it sound nice
yee in a wai but he ad with energi it wont come off no
not the aerophon thei ar right enough i believ but all the rest of
it
why not
becaus it is too much happi end dont come off the happi
li in the struggl you knowan old sai but quit true
afterward someth interven
to have struggl happili and successfulli is happi in itself
whatev come afterward noth can take that awai i have done
someth it is good it cannot be chang it is a stone built for
ever in the pyramid of beauti or knowledg or advanc what can
man hope to sai more at the last and how few live to sai it to sai it
truli you will leav a great name behind you mr monk
i shall leav my work that is enough for me he answer
for a while thei walk in silenc then some thought struck him and he
stop to ask
why did layard come to the dead church todai he said that he wa
go home and it isnt on hi road
stella turn her head but even in that faint light not quickli
enough to prevent him see a sudden flush chang the pallor of her
face to the rich colour of her lip
to call i suppos or correct herself perhap from curios
and what did he talk about
oh the aerophon i think i dont rememb
that must be a stori he said laugh i alwai rememb layard
convers for longer than i want it ha a knack of impress itself
upon me what wa it cemeteri land church debt the new drainag
scheme or someth equal entranc and confidenti
under thi crossexamin stella grew desper unnecessarili
perhap and said in a voic that wa almost cross
i cannot tell you pleas let talk of someth els
then of a sudden morri understood and like a foolish man at onc
jump to a conclus far other than the truth doubtless layard had
gone to the church to propos to stella and she had accept him or
half accept him the confus of her manner told it own tale a new
and strang sensat took possess of morri he felt unwel he felt
angri if the aerophon refus to work at all tomorrow he would care
noth he could not see quit clearli and wa not altogeth sure
where he wa walk
i beg your pardon he said in a cold voic as he recov himself
it wa most impertin of me he wa go to add prai accept my
congratul but fortun or unfortun stop himself in
time
stella divin someth of what wa pass in hi mind not all
inde for to her the full measur of hi folli would have been
incomprehens for a moment she contempl an explan then
abandon the idea becaus she could find no word becaus also thi
wa anoth person secret and she had no right to involv an honest
man who had paid her a great compliment in her confid so she
said noth to morri for the moment at ani rate a conclus proof
of hi worst suspicion
the rest of that walk wa mark by unbroken silenc both of them were
veri glad when it wa finish
it wa five oclock when thei reach the abbei so that there were two
hour to be spent befor it wa time to dress for dinner when she had
taken off her thing stella went straight to her father room to give
him hi tea by now mr fregeliu wa much better although the natur
of hi injuri made it imper that he should still stai in bed
is that you stella he said in hi high nervou voic and
although she could not see them in the shadow of the curtain she knew
that hi quick ey were watch her face eagerli
ye father i have brought you your tea ar you readi for it
thank you my dear have you been at that placewhat do you call
itth dead church all dai

voic the fate of the experi did not move him isnt it veri
lone up there in that old church
i prefer to be alonegener
i know i know forgiv me but you ar a veri odd woman my dear
perhap father but not more so than those befor me am i most of
them were a littl differ from other peopl i have been told
quit right stella thei were all odd women but i think that you
ar quit the oddest of the famili then as though the subject were
disagre to him he ad suddenli mr layard came to see me
todai
so he told me answer stella
oh you have met him i rememb he said he should call in at the dead
church as he had someth to sai to you
stella determin to get the convers over so she forc the pace
she wa a person who like to have disagre thing behind her
draw herself up she answer steadili
he did call in andh said it
what my dear what ask mr fregeliu innoc

consent
mr fregeliu augur the veri best from thi open answer in
tone which he could not prevent from betrai an unseemli joi
quit true stella i told him to go on and prosper and realli i hope
he ha prosper
ye said stella reflect
then my dear love am i to understand that you ar engag to him
engag to him certainli not she answer
then snap out her justli indign parent how in the name of
heaven ha he prosper
by my refus him of cours we should never have suit each other
at all he would have been miser if i had marri him
mr fregeliu groan in bitter of spirit
oh stella stella he cri what a disappoint
why should you be disappoint father dear she ask gentli
why you stand there and ask why when i hear that my daughter who
will scarc have a sixpenceor at least veri few of themha refus
a young man with between seventeen and eighteen thousand pound a
yearthat hi exact incom for he told me himself a most estim
churchman who would have been a pillar of strength to me a man whom
i should have chosen out of ten thousand as a soninlaw and he
ceas overwhelm
father i am sorri that you ar sorri but it is strang you should
understand me so littl after all these year that you could for on
moment think that i should marri mr layard
and why not prai ar you better born
ye interrupt stella whose on pride wa that of her ancient
lineag
i didnt mean that i meant better bred and gener superior to him
you talk as though you were of a differ clai
perhap the clai is the same said stella but the mind is not
oh there it is again spiritu and intellectu pride which caus
you to set yourself abov your fellow and in the end will be your
ruin it ha made a lone woman of you for year and it will do wors
than that it will turn you into an old maidif you live he ad as
though shaken by some sudden memori
perhap said stella i am not frighten at the prospect i daresai
that i shall have a littl monei and at the worst i can alwai earn
a live my voic would help me to it if noth els doe father
dear you mustnt be vex with me and prayprai do understand that
no earthli thing would make me marri a man whom i dislik rather than
otherwis who at least is not a mate for me mere becaus he could
give me a fine hous to live in and treat me luxuri what would be
the good of such thing to me if i knew that i had tarnish myself and
violat my instinct
you talk like a bookyou talk like a book mutter the old
gentleman but i know that the end of it will be wretched for
everybodi peopl who go on as you do about instinct and fine
feel and all that stuff ar just the on who get into some
dread mess at last i tell you that such idea ar some of the
devil best bait
stella began to grow indign
do you think father that you ought to talk to me quit like that
she ask dont you know me well enough to be sure that i should never
get into what you call a messat least not in the wai i suppos you
mean my heart and thought ar my own and i shall be prepar to render
account of them for the rest you need not be afraid
i didnt mean thati didnt mean anyth of the sort
i am glad to hear it broke in stella it would scarc have been
kind especi as i am no longer a child who need to be warn
against the danger of the world
what i did mean is that you ar an enigma that i am frighten about
you that you ar no companion becaus your thoughtsy and at time
your face tooseem unnatur unearthli and separ you from other
as thei have separ you from thi poor young man
i am what i wa made answer stella with a littl smile and i seek
compani where i can find it some love the natur some the spiritu
and each receiv from them their good why should thei blame on
anoth
mad mutter her father to himself as she left the room mad as she
is charm and beauti or if not mad at least quit impractic
and unfit for the world what a disappoint to mewhat a bitter
disappoint well i should be us to them by now
meanwhil morri wa in hi workshop in the old chapel enter up hi
record of the dai experi which done he drew hi chair to the
stove and fell into thought somehow the idea of the engag of miss
fregeliu to stephen layard wa not agreeabl to him probabl becaus
he did not care about the young man yet now that he came to think
of it quietli in all her circumst it would be an admir
arrang and the offer undoubtedli wa on which she had been wise
to accept on the whole such a marriag would be as happi as marriag
gener ar the man wa honest the man wa young and rich and veri
soon the man would be complet at the dispos of hi brilliant and
beauti wife
person he morri would lose a friend sinc a woman cannot marri
and remain the friend of anoth man that howev would probabl have
happen in ani case and to object on thi account even in hi secret
heart would be abomin selfish inde what right had he even
to consid the matter the young ladi had come into hi life veri
strang and made a curiou impress upon him she wa now go out
of it by ordinari channel and soon noth but the impress would
remain it wa proper natur and the wai of the world there wa
noth more to be said
somehow he wa in a dreari mood and everyth bore him he fetch
mari last letter there wa noth in it but some chitchat except
the postscript which wa rather longer than the letter and ran
i am glad to hear the young ladi whom you fish up out of the sea
is such an assist to you in your experi i gather from what i
hearalthough you havent mention the factthat she is as beauti
as she is charm and that she sing wonderfulli she must be
someth remark i am sure becaus eliza layard evid detest
her and sai that she is try to ensnar the affect of that
squir of dame her brother stephen now temporarili homeless after
a visit to jane rose what will you do when you have to get on without
her i am afraid you must accustom yourself to the idea unless she
would like to make a third in the honeymoon parti joke apart i am
exceedingli grate to her for all the help she ha given you and
dear dear morri more delight than i can tell you to learn that
after all your year of patient labour you believ success to be
absolut within sight
my father i am sorri to sai is no better inde although the
doctor deni it i believ he is wors and i see no prospect of our
get awai from here at present howev dont let that bother you
and abov all dont think of come out to thi place which make you
miser and where you cant work what a queer menag you must be at
the abbei now you and the star who ha risen from the oceansh ought
to have been call venusteteatet and the i gather rather feebl
and uninterest old gentleman in bed upstair i should like to see
you when you didnt know why dont you invent a machin to enabl
peopl at a distanc to see as well as to hear each other it would
be veri popular and bring societi to utter wreck doe the northern
starsh is danish isnt shemak good coffe and how oh how doe
she get on with the cook
morri put down the letter and laugh aloud mari wa as amus as
ever and he long to see her again especi as he wa convinc
that she wa realli bore out there at beaulieu with mr porson sick
and hi father veri much occupi with hi own affair in a moment he
made up hi mind he would go out and see her of cours he could ill
spare the time but for the present the more press of hi experi
were complet and he could write up hi data there anywai he would
put in a fortnight at beaulieu and what is more start tomorrow if it
could be arrang
he went to the tabl and began a letter to mari announc that she
might expect to see him sometim on the dai that it reach her when he
had got so far as thi he rememb that the dress bell had alreadi
rung some minut and ran upstair to chang hi cloth as he
fasten hi tie he thought to himself sadli that thi would be hi last
dinner with stella fregeliu and as he brush hi hair he determin
that unless she had other wish it should be as happi as it could be
made he would like thi final meal to be the pleasantest of all their
meal and although of cours he had no right to form an opinion on
the matter he thought that perhap she might like it too thei were
go to part to enter on differ walk of lifefor now be it
said he had quit convinc himself that she wa engagedso let their
part memori of each other be as agreeabl as possibl
meanwhil stella also had her reflect her convers with her
father had troubl her more perhap than her remark might have
suggest there wa littl between thi pair except the bond of blood
which sometim seem to be so curious accident so absolut
devoid of influenc in promot mutual sympathi or in open the
door to ani deep and real affect still notwithstand thi lack
of true intimaci stella love her father as she felt that he love her
and it gave her pain to be forc to cross hi wish she knew with
what a fierc desir although he wa asham to express all it
intens he desir that she should accept thi the first chanc of
wealthi and success marriag that had come her wai and the anguish
which her absolut refus must have entail upon hi heart
of cours it wa veri worldli of him and therefor reprehens
yet to a great extent she could sympathis with hi disappoint at
bottom he wa a proud man although he repress hi pride and kept it
secret he wa an ambiti man also and hi lot had been confin
to humbl task absolut unrecognis beyond hi parish of a
remotelyplac countri parson moreov hi famili had been rich he
had been brought up to believ that he himself would be rich and
then ow to certain circumst wa doom to pass hi dai in
compar poverti
even death had laid a heavi hand on him she wa the last of her
race and she knew he earnestli desir that she should marri and bear
children so that it might not becom extinct and now thi chanc thi
princ chanc which from hi point of view seem to fill everi
possibl condit had come unawar like a messeng from heaven and
she refus it entertain look at through hi ey the posit
wa inde cruel
yet deepli as she sympathis with him in hi disappoint stella
never for on moment waver in her determin marri mr layard her
blood shrank back to her heart at the veri thought and then rush to
her neck and bosom in a flood of shame no she wa sorri but that wa
imposs a thing which no woman should be ask to do against her
will
the subject weari her but as brood on it could not mend matter
she dismiss it from her mind and turn her thought to morri why
she did not know but someth had come between them he wa vex with
her and what wa more disappoint she could feel it well enough
andsh found hi displeasur pain what had she done wrong how had
she offend him sure it could not beand onc again that red blush
spread itself over face and bosom he could not believ that she had
accept the man he could never have so grossli misunderstood her her
natur her idea everyth about her and yet who knew what he would
or would not believ in some wai as she had alreadi discov mr
monk wa curious simpl how could she tell him the truth without
us word which she did not desir to speak here instinct came to her
aid it might be done by make herself as agreeabl to him as possibl
for sure he must know that no girl would do her best to pleas on
man when she had just promis herself to anoth so it came about that
quit innoc stella determin to allai her host misgiv by
thi doubt and danger expedi
to begin with she put on her best dressa low bodic of black silk
reliev with white and a singl scarlet rose from the hothous round
her neck also fasten by a thin chain she wore a larg bloodr
carbuncl shape like a heart and about her slender waist a quaint
girdl of ancient danish silver two of the ornament which she had
save from the shipwreck her dark and wave hair she part in the
middl after a new fashion ty it mass in a heavi knot at the back
of her head and thu adorn descend to the librari where morri wa
await her
he stood lean over the fire with hi back toward her but hear
the sweep of a skirt turn round and as hi ey fell upon her
start a littl never till he saw her thu had he known how beauti
stella wa at time quit without design hi ey betrai hi thought
but with hi lip he said mere as he offer her hi arm
what a pretti dress did it come out of northwold
the materi did i made it up and i am glad that you think it nice
thi wa a propiti begin and the dinner that follow did not
beli it promis the convers turn upon on of the nors saga
that stella had translat for which morri had promis to try to find
a publish then abandon the silenc and reserv which were habitu
to him he began to talk ask her about her work and her past she
answer him freeli enough tell him of her school dai in denmark
of her long holidai visit to the old danish grandmoth whose memori
stretch back through three gener and whose mind wa store with
tradit of men and dai now long forgotten thi particular saga

took it down from the old dame lip much as in the fifteenth centuri

among them till at length it wa time to leav the tabl thi thei did
togeth for even then morri drank veri littl wine
mai i get you the violin and will you sing he ask eagerli when

that is a veri good instrument said stella her ey shine you
dont know what you have brought upon yourself plai the violin is
my pet insan and onc or twice sinc i have been here when i want
it i have cri over the loss of mine especi as i cant afford
to bui anoth oh what a love night it is look at the full moon
shine on the sea and snow i never rememb her so bright and the
star too thei glitter like great diamond
it is the frost answer morri ye everyth is beauti
tonight
stella took the violin plai a note or two then screw up the
string to her like
do you realli wish me to sing mr monk she ask
of cours more than i can tell you
then will you think me veri odd if i ask you to turn out the electr
lamp i can sing best so you stand by the fire so that i can see
my audienc the moon through thi window will give me all the light i
want
he obei and now she wa but an ether figur with a patch of red
at her heart and a line of glimmer white from the silver girdl
beneath her breast on whose pale face the moonbeam pour sweetli
for a while she stood thu and the silenc wa heavi in that beauti
dismantl place of prayer then she lift the violin and from the
first touch of the bow morri knew that he wa in the presenc of a
mistress of on of the most entranc of the art slow and sweet came
the plaintiv penetr sound that seem to pass into hi heart
and thrill hi everi nerv now thei swell louder now thei almost
di awai and now onli touch the string from time to time she
began to sing in her rich contralto voic he could not understand the
word but their burden wa clear enough thei were a lament the
lament of some sorrow woman the sweet embodi of an ancient and
forgotten grief thu embalm in heavenli music
it wa done the echo of the follow note of the violin faint and
di among the carven angel of the roof it wa done and morri sigh
aloud
how can i thank you he said i knew that you were a musician but
not that you had such geniu to listen to you make a man feel veri
humbl
she laugh the voic is a mere gift for which no on deserv
credit although of cours it can be improv
if so what of the accompani
that is differ that come from the heart and hard work do you know
that when i wa under my old master out in denmark who in hi time wa
on of the finest of violinist in the north of europ i often plai
for five and sang for two hour a dai also i have never let the thing
drop it ha been the consol and amus of a somewhat lone
life so by thi time i ought to understand my art although there
remain much to be learnt
understand it why you could make a fortun on the stage
a live perhap if my voic will bear the continu strain i
daresai that some time i shall drift therefor the livingnot becaus
i like the trade or have ani wish for popular success it is a fact that
i had far rather sing alon to you here tonight and know that you ar
pleas than be cheer by a whole opera hous full of strang peopl
and ioh i cannot explain sing on sing all you can for tomorrow i
must go awai
go awai she falter
ye i will explain to you afterward but pleas sing while i am here
to listen
the word struck heavi on her heart numb itwhi she knew not for
a moment she felt helpless as though she could neither sing nor plai
she did not wish him to go she did not wish him to go her intellect
came to her aid why should he go heaven had given her power and thi
man could feel it weight would it not suffic to keep him from go
she would try she would plai and sing as she had never done befor
sing till hi heart wa soft plai till hi feet had no strength to
wander beyond the sound of the sweet note her art could summon from
thi instrument of string and wood
so again she began and plai on and on and on from time to time
let the bow fall to sing in a flood of heavenli melodi that seem
by natur to fall from her lip note after note as dew or honei fall
drop by drop from the calyx of some perfect flower now long did she
plai and sing those sad mysteri siren song thei never knew the
moon travel on it appoint cours and as it beam pass awai
gradual that divin musician grew dimmer to hi sight now onli the
star threw their faint light about her but still she plai on and
on and on the music swell it told of dead and ancient war where
all dai long the nois of battl roll it rose shrill and high and
in it rang the scream of the valkyri prepar the feast of odin
it wa low and sad and tender the voic of women mourn for their
dead it chang it grew unearthli spiritualis such music as those
might us who welcom soul to their long home lastli it becam rich
and soft and far as the echo of a dream and through it could be heard
sigh and the broken word of love that slowli fell awai and melt as
into the nothing of some happi sleep
the singer wa weari her finger could no longer guid the bow her
voic grew faint for a moment she stood still look in the flicker
of the fire and the pale beam of the star like some searcher return
from heaven to earth then half faint down she sank upon a chair
morri turn on the lamp and look at thi fair be thi chosen
home of music who lai befor him like a broken lili then back into hi
heart with a chill shock came the thought that thi woman to him
at least the most beauti and gift hi ey had seen had promis
herself in marriag to stephen layard that she her bodi her mind
her musical that made her the stella fregeliu whom he knewwer the
actual properti of stephen layard could it be true wa it not possibl
that he had made some mistak that he had misunderstood a burn
desir came upon him to know to know befor he went and upon the
forc impuls of that moment he did what at ani other time would have
fill him with horror he ask her the word broke from hi lip he
could not help them
is it true he said with someth like a groan can it be true that
youyou ar realli go to marri that man
stella sat up and look at him so she had guess aright she made no
pretenc of fenc with him or of pretend that she did not know to
whom he refer
ar you mad to ask me such a thing she ask with a strang break in
her voic
i am sorri he began
she stamp her foot upon the ground
oh she said it hurt me it hurtsfrom my father i understood but
that you should think it possibl that i would sell myselfi tell you
that it hurt and as she spoke two larg tear began to roll from her
love plead ey
then you mean that you refus him
what els
thank you of cours i have no right to interfer but forgiv me if
i sai that i cannot help feel glad even if it is taken on the ground
of wealth you can easili make as much monei as you want without him
and he glanc at the violin which lai besid her
she made no repli the subject seem to have pass from her mind but
present she lift her head again and in her turn ask a question
did you not sai that you ar go awai tomorrow
then someth happen to the heart and brain and tongu of morri monk
so that he could not speak the thing he wish he meant to answer a
monosyl ye but in it place he repli with a whole sentenc
i wa think of do so but after all i do not know that it will be
necessari especi in the middl of our experi
stella said noth not a singl word onli she found her handkerchief
and without in the least attempt to hide them there befor hi ey
wipe the two tear off her face first on and then the other
thi done she held out her hand to him and left the room

it wa useless to alarm you and wast monei on telegram how like a
woman to think of monei at such a moment when it wa quit imposs
that you could arriv here in time for the funer for he wouldnt be
brought home which under these queer foreign regul must take
place tomorrow also she announc to my surpris and i must admit
somewhat to my pain that she intend to immur herself for a month in

your come as men ar not admit into these place it never seem
to have occur to her that under thi blow i should have like the
consol of her presenc or that i might wish to see you my son
still you must not think too much of all thi although i have felt
bound to bring it to your notic sinc women under such circumst
ar natur emot rebelli against the decre of provid

thi is left to mari with the fullest possibl power of dispos you
and i ar appoint executor with a complimentari legaci of 500

daughter mari remit all debt and oblig that mai be due to hi
estat by the said richard monk lieutenantcolonel companion of the
bath and an executor of thi will thi amount to someth of
cours but i will not troubl you with detail at the moment
after all now that i come to think of it it is as well that you
should not leav home at present as there will be plenti of executor
busi to keep you on the spot no doubt you will hear from your late
uncl lawyer thoma and thoma and as soon as you do so you had
better go over to seaview and take formal possess of it and it
content as an executor of the will i have no time to write more
at present as the undertak is wait to see me about the last
arrang for the inter which take place at the english
cemeteri here the poor man ha gone but at least we mai reflect that
he can be no more troubl by sick etc and it is a consol
to know that he ha made arrang so emin proper under the

richard monk
ps i shall remain here for a littl while so as to be near mari in
case she wish to see me and afterward work homeward via pari i
expect to turn up at the abbei in a fortnight time or so

debt and oblig that mai be due to hi estat by the said richard
monk i should be surpris if thei dont amount to a good lot no
wonder my father is go to return via pari he must feel quit rich
again
then he sat down to write to mari
under the pressur of thi sudden blowfor the fact that mr porson had
been for some time in fail health and the knowledg that hi life
might termin at ani time did not seem to make it less suddena
cloud of depress settl on the abbei household befor dinner morri
visit mr fregeliu and told him of what had happen whereon that
piou and kindli but somewhat ineffici man bestow upon him a
wellmeant lectur of consol appreci hi motiv morri
thank him sincer and wa rise to depart when the clergyman
ad
it is most grievou to me mr monk that in these sad hour of
mourn you should be forc to occupi your mind with the detail of
an hospit which ha been forc upon you by circumst for the
present i fear thi cannot be alter
i do not wish it alter interrupt morri
it is inde kind of you to sai so but i am happi to state the doctor
tell me if i continu to progress as well as at present i shall be
abl to leav your roof
my father roof broke in morri again
i beg pardonyour father roofin about a fortnight
i am sorri to hear it sir and pleas clear your mind of the idea that
you have ceas to be welcom your presenc and that of miss fregeliu
will lessen not increas my troubl i should be lone in thi great
place with no compani but that of my own thought
i am glad to hear you sai so whether you feel it or not you ar kind
veri kind
and so for the while thei part when she came in that afternoon mr
fregeliu told stella the new but as it happen she did not see
morri until she met him at dinner time
you have heard he ask
oh ye she answer and i am sorri so sorri i do not know what
more to sai
there is noth to be said answer morri my poor uncl had live
out hi lifeh wa sixtyeight you know and there is an end
were you fond of him forgiv me for ask but peopl ar not alwai
fondreal fondof those who happen to be their relat
ye i wa veri fond of him he wa a good man though simpl and
selfmad veri kind to everybodi especi to myself
then do not griev for him hi pain ar over and some dai you will
meet him again will you not
i suppos so but in the presenc of death faith falter
i know but i think that is when it should be strongest and clearest
that is when we should feel that whatev els is unreal and fals thi
is certain and true
morri bow hi head in assent and there wa silenc for a while
i am afraid that miss porson must feel thi veri much stella said
present
ye she seem quit crush she wa hi onli live child you know
ar you not go to join her
no i cannot she ha gone into a convent for a month near beaulieu
and i am afraid the sister would not let me through their gate
is she a cathol
not at all but an old friend of her hold some high posit in the
place and she ha taken a fanci to be quiet there for a while
it is veri natur answer stella and noth more wa said upon
the subject
stella neither plai the violin nor sang that night nor inde again
while she remain alon with morri at the abbei both of them felt
that under the circumst thi form of pleasur would be out of
place if not unfeel and it wa never suggest for the rest
howev their life went on as usual on two or three occas when the
weather wa suitabl some further experi were carri out with the
aerophon but on most dai stella wa engag in prepar the rectori
a squar redbrick hous date from the time of georg iii to
receiv them as soon as her father could be move veri fortun as
ha been said their journei in the steamer trondhjem had been decid
upon so hurriedli that there wa no time to allow them to ship their
heavi baggag and furnitur which were left to follow and thu escap
destruct now at length these had arriv and the unpack and
arrang gave her constant thought and occup in which morri
occasion assist
on even inde he stai in the rectori with her help to hang
some pictur till about halfpast six oclock when thei start for
the abbei as it chanc a heavi gale wa blow that night on of
the furiou winter storm which ar common on thi coast and it worst
gust beat upon stella so fierc that she could scarc stand and
wa glad to accept the support of morriss arm as thei struggl
along the high road thu a particularli savag blast tore the hood of
stella ulster from her head whereupon lean over her in such a
posit that hi face wa necessarili quit close to her own with some
difficulti he manag to replac the hood
it wa while morri wa so engag that a dogcart which becaus of the
roar of the wind he did not hear and becaus of hi posit he could
not see until it wa almost pass them came slowli down the road
then catch the gleam of the lamp he look up and start back
think that thei were be run into to perceiv that the occup
of the dogcart were stephen and eliza layard
at the same moment stephen recognis them as inde he could scarc
help do with the light of the power lamp shine full upon their
face he shout someth to hi sister who also stare coldli at the
pair then a kind of furi seem to seiz the littl man at ani rate
he shook hi clench fist in a menac fashion and brought down the
whip with a savag cut upon the hors as the anim sprang forward
moreov morri could almost have sworn that he heard the word
kiss her spoken in stephen voic follow by a laugh from
eliza
then the dogcart vanish into the dark and the incid wa
close
for a moment morri stood angri and astonish but reflect that
in thi wind hi ear might have deceiv him and that at ani rate
stella had heard noth through her thick friez hood he onc more
offer hi arm and walk forward
the next dai wa sundai when as usual he escort stella to
church the layard were there also but he notic that somewhat
ostentati thei hurri from the build immedi on the
conclus of the servic and it struck him that thi demonstr
might have some mean eliza whom he afterward observ engag
appar in eager convers with a knot of peopl on the roadwai
wa as he knew well no friend to him for reason which he could
guess nor as he had heard from variou quarter wa she ani friend of
stella fregeliu ani more than she had been to jane rose it struck him
that even now she might be emploi in sow scandal about them both
and for stella sake the thought made him furiou but even if it were
so he did not see what he could do therefor he tri to think he wa
mistaken and to dismiss the matter from hi mind
colonel monk had written to sai that he wa come home on the
wednesdai but he did not in fact put in an appear till the
halfpast six train on the follow saturdai even when he arriv
beautifulli dress in the most irreproach black and in a veri good
temper
ah morri old fellow he said i am veri pleas to see you again
after all there is no place like home and at my time of life noth
to equal quiet i cant tell you how sick i got of that french hole if
it hadnt been for mari and my old friend ladi rawlin who as usual
wa in troubl with that wretch husband of hersh is an imbecil
now you knowi should have been back long befor well how ar you
get on
oh pretti well thank you father morri answer in that rather
restrain voic which wa natur to him when convers with hi
parent i think i realli think i have nearli perfect my aerophon
have you well then i hope you will make someth out of it after
all these year not that it much matter now howev he ad
contentedli by the wai that remind me how ar our two guest the
new parson and hi daughter that wa a queer stori about your find
her on the wreck ar thei still here
ye but the old gentleman is out of bed now and he expect to be abl
to move into the rectori on mondai
doe he well thei must have given you some compani while you were
alon there is no time like the present i will go up and see him
befor i dress for dinner
accordingli morri conduct hi father to the abbot chamber and
introduc him to the clergyman mr fregeliu wa seat in hi
armchair with a crutch by hi side and on learn who hi visitor
wa made a futil effort to rise
prai prai sir said the colonel keep seat or you will certainli
hurt your leg again
when i should be oblig to inflict myself upon you for anoth five or
six week repli mr fregeliu
in that case sir said the colonel with hi most courteou bow and
for that reason onli i should consid the accid fortun by these
happi word make of hi guest a devot friend for ever
i dont know how to thank you i realli dont know how to thank you
then prai mr fregeliu leav the thank unspoken what would you
have had usor rather my sondo turn a senseless shatter man
from hi door and that man hi futur spiritu pastor and master
but there wa more he mr monk i mean save my daughter stella
life you know a block or a spar fell on me immedi after the ship
struck then those cowardli dog of sailor think that she must
founder instantli threw me into the boat and row awai leav her
to her fate in the cabin whereon your son act on some word which i
spoke in my delirium sail out alon at night and rescu her
ye i heard someth but morri is not too commun the odd
thing about the whole affair so far as i can gather is that he should
have discov that there wa anybodi left on board but he is a
curiou fellow morri those thing which on would expect him to know
he never doe know and the thing that nobodi els ha ever heard of
he seem to have at hi finger end by instinct or second sight or
someth well it ha all turn out for the best hasnt it
oh ye i suppos so answer mr fregeliu glanc at hi injur
leg at ani rate we ar both aliv and have not lost mani of our
belong
quit so and under the circumst you should be uncommonli
thank but i need not tell a parson that well i can onli sai that
i am delight to have such a good opportun of make your
acquaint which i am sure will lead to our pull togeth in
parish affair like a pair of match hors now i must go and dress
but i tell you what ill come and smoke a cigar with you afterward
and put you au fait with all our variou concern youll find them a
nice lot in thi parish i can tell you a nice lot old tomlei just
gave them up as a bad job
i hope i shant do that repli mr fregeliu after hi retreat
form
the colonel wa down to dinner first and stand warm himself at
the librari fire when stella onc more in honour of hi arriv arrai
in her best dress enter the room the colonel put up hi eyeglass and
look at her as she came down it length
by jove he thought to himself i didnt know that the clergyman
daughter wa like thi nobodi ever said so after all that fellow
morri cant be half such a fool as he look for he kept it dark then
he step forward with outstretch hand
you must allow me to introduc myself miss fregeliu he said with an
oldfashion and courtli bow and to explain that i have the honour to
be my son father
she bow and answer ye i think i should have known that from the
like
hum said the colonel even at my ag i am not certain that i am
altogeth flatter morri is an excel fellow and veri clever
at electr machin but i have never consid him remark for
person beautynot exactli an adoni or an apollo or a narcissu
you know
i should doubt whether ani of them had such a nice face repli
stella with a smile
my word now that is what i call a compliment worth have but i hear
the gentleman himself come shall i repeat it to him
no pleas dont colonel monk i did not mean it for compliment onli
for an answer
your wish is a command but mai i make an except in favour of miss
porson who prospect own the nice face in question she would be
delight to know it so highli rate and he glanc at her sharpli
the look of a man of the world who is try to read a woman heart
by all mean answer stella in an indiffer voic but
recognis in the colonel on who as friend or foe must be taken into
account then morri came in and thei went to dinner
here also colonel monk wa veri pleasant he made stella tell the stori
of the shipwreck and of her rescu and gener tri to draw her out
in everi possibl wai but all the while he wa watch and take
note of mani thing befor thei had been togeth for five minut he
observ that thi coupl hi son and their visitor were on term of
extrem intimacyintimaci so extrem and genuin that in two instanc
at least each anticip what the other wa go to sai without
wait for ani word to be spoken thu stella deliber answer
a question that morri had not put and he accept the answer and
continu the argument quit as a matter of cours also thei seem
mysteri to understand each other want and worst of all
he note that when speak thei never address each other by name
evid just then each of them had but on you in the world
now the colonel had not pass through veri vari experi and
studi mani side and condit of life for noth inde he would
himself explain that he wa abl to see as far into a brick wall as
other folk
the upshot of all thi wa that first he thought morri a veri lucki
fellow to be an object of undoubt admir to those beauti
ey it mai be explain that the colonel throughout life had been
an advoc of take such good as the god provid someth of a
worshipp too at the shrine of love thai hi second reflect
wa that under all the circumst it seem quit time that he
return home to look after him
now miss fregeliu he said as she rose to leav the tabl when
morri and i have had a glass of wine and ten minut to chat over
matter connect with hi poor uncl death i am go to ask you to
do me a favour befor i go up to smoke a cigar with your father it is
that you will plai me a tune on the violin and sing me a song
did mr monk tell you that i plai and sang she ask
no he did not inde mr monk ha told me noth whatsoev about
you hi as you mai have observ is not a veri commun natur
the inform came from a much less interest though for aught
i know from a more imparti sourceth fat pageboi thoma who
is first tenor in the wesleyan chapel and therefor imagin that he
understand music
but how could thoma began morri when hi father cut him short
and answer
oh ill tell you quit simpli i had it from the interest youth
own lip as he unpack my cloth it seem that the dai befor the
new of your uncl death reach thi place thoma wa arous from
hi slumber by hear what he wa pleas to call hangel aarp
and sing as soon as he convinc himself that he still linger on
the earth drawn by the sweet of the sound just in hi jacket and
breech he follow them until he wa sure that thei proceed from
your workshop the chapel
now as you know on the upstair passag there still is that queer slit
through which the old abbot us to watch the monk at their devot
find the shutter unlock the astut thoma follow their exampl
as well as he could for he sai there wa no light in the chapel except
that of the fire by which present he made out your figur miss
fregeliu sometim plai the violin and sometim sing and that
of morrisagain i must quoteasit in a chair by the fire with
hi and at the back of is ead astar at the floor and rock
imself as though he felt right down bad no dont interrupt me
morri i must tell my stori it veri amus
well miss fregeliu he saysand mind you thi is a great
complimentthat you sang and plai till he felt as though he would cry
when at last you sank down quit exhaust in a chair then suddenli
realis that he wa veri cold and hear the stabl clock strike
two he went back to bed and that the end of the tale now you will
understand why i have ask you thi favour i dont see why morri and
thoma should keep it all to themselv
i shall be delight answer stella who although her cheek were
burn and she knew that the merciless colonel wa take note of the
fact on the whole had gone through the ordeal remark well then she
left the room
as soon as the door close morri turn upon hi father angrili
oh my dear boi the colonel said pleas do not begin to explain
i know it all perfectli right and there is noth to explain why
shouldnt you get an uncommonli pretti girl with a good voic to sing
to youwhil you ar still in a posit to listen but if you care
to take my advic next time you will see that the shutter of that
hagioscop or whatev thei call it is lock as such elev
delight a deux ar apt to be misinterpret by the vulgar and now
there enough of thi chaff and nonsens i want to speak to you about
the executorship and matter connect with the properti gener
half an hour later when the colonel appear in the drawingroom
the violin wa fetch and stella plai it and sang afterward to a
pianofort accompani the perform wa not of the same standard
by ani mean as that which had delight thoma for stella did not
feel the surround quit propiti still with her voic and touch
she could not fail and the result wa that befor she had done the
colonel grew truli enthusiast
i know a littl of music he said and i have heard most of the best
singer and violinist dure the last forti year but in the face of
all those memori i hope you will allow me to congratul you miss
fregeliu there ar some note in your voic which realli reduc me
to the condit of peep thoma and harden old fellow that i am
almost make me feel inclin to cry
chapter xv
three interview
the next dai wa a sundai and the colonel went to church wear a
hatband four inch deep morri howev declin to accompani him
sai that he had a letter to write to mari whereon hi father who
at first wa inclin to be vex repli that he could not be better
emploi and that he wa to give her hi love then he ask if miss
fregeliu wa come but somewhat to hi disappoint wa inform
that she wish to stai with her father
i wonder thought the colonel to himself as he stroll to the church
now and again acknowledg greet or stop to chat with on of
the villagersi wonder if thei ar go to have a littl sacr music
togeth in the chapel if so upon my soul i should like to make
the congreg and that piou fellow morri tooth blameless
morristo go philand about in thi fashion i hope it wont come
to mari ear but if it doe luckili with all her temper she is a
sensibl woman and know that even jove nod at time
after the servic the colonel spoke to variou friend accept their
condol upon the death of mr porson and final walk down the
road with eliza layard
you must have found that all sort of strang thing have happen at
the abbei sinc you have been awai colonel monk she said present in
a sprightli voic
well ye at least i dont know i understand that morri ha improv
that bless apparatu of hi and the new parson and hi daughter have
float to our door like driftwood by the wai have you seen miss
fregeliu
seen her ye i have seen her
she is a wonderfulli captiv girl isnt she so unusu with
those great ey of her that seem to vari with the light
like a cat snap eliza
the light withini wa go to sai
oh i thought you meant the light without well she mai be
fascinatingto men but as i am onli a woman i cannot be expect to
appreci that you see we look more to other thing
ah well so far as i am a judg she seem to me to be pretti well set
up in them also she ha a marvel voic is certainli a firstclass
violinist and i should sai extrem wellread especi in nors
literatur
oh i daresai she is a geniu as well as a beauti
i gather said the colonel with a smile that you do not like miss
fregeliu as my acquaint with her is limit would you think me
rude if i ask why
how can i be expect to like her see and she paus
see what miss layard
what havent you heard i thought it wa common properti
he shook hi head i have heard noth go on prai thi is quit
interest
that she led on that silli brother of mine until he propos to
hery propos to herand then refus him stephen ha been like
a crazi creatur ever sinc moan and groan and mope till
i think that he will go off hi head instead of return thank to
provid for a merci escap
the colonel set hi lip as though to whistl then check himself
under the circumst presum them to be accur state i
am not prepar to sai who is to be congratul or who should thank
provid these thing ar so individu ar thei not but if on
thing is clear whatev els she is or is not miss fregeliu cannot be
a fortunehunt although she must want monei
she mai want other thing more
perhap but i am veri stupid i am afraid i do not understand
men for instanc suggest eliza
dear me that sound almost carnivor i am afraid that there ar
not mani about here to satisfi her appetit your brother morri
the curat at morton and myself if at my ag i mai creep into that
honour compani ar the onli singl creatur within four mile and
from these stephen and morri must appar be elimin
why should morri be elimin
a reason mai occur to you
do you mean becaus he is engag what on earth doe that matter
nothingin the eastbut rightli or wrongli we have decid upon a
monogam system a man cant marri two wive miss layard
but he can throw over on girl to marri anoth
do you suggest that morri is contempl thi experi
i i suggest noth all i know is
well now what do you know
if you wish me to tell you as perhap i ought i know thi colonel
monk that the other night when i wa drive along the rectori road
i saw your son mr monk kiss thi wonder miss fregeliu that is
all and stephen saw it also you ask him
thank you i think i would rather not but what an odd place for him to
choos for thi interchang of earli christian courtesi alsoif you
ar not mistakenhow well it illustr that line in the hymn thi
morn
how mani a spot defil the robe that wrap an earthli saint
such adventur seem scarc in morriss line and i should have
thought that even an inexperienc saint would have been more discreet
men alwai jest at seriou thing said eliza sever
which do you meanth saint or the kiss both ar seriou enough
but the two in combin
dont you believ me ask eliza
of cours but could you give me a few detail
eliza could and didwith amplif
now what do you sai colonel monk she ask triumphantli
i sai that i think you have made an awkward mistak miss layard it
seem to me that all you saw is quit consist with the theori that he
wa button or arrang the young ladi hood i understand that the
wind wa veri high that night
eliza start thi wa a new and unpleas interpret which she
hasten to repudi arrang her hood inde
when he might have been kiss her you cannot understand such
moder still it is possibl and he ought to have the benefit of
the doubt wit to charact would be valuabl in such a case and
hisnot to mention the ladysi curious immacul
of cours you ar entitl to your own opinion but i have mine
suddenli the colonel chang hi banter satir tone and becam
stern and wither
miss layard he said doe it occur to you that on evid which
would not suffic to convict a bicyclist of ride on a footpath you
ar circul a scandal of which the issu might be veri grave to both
the parti concern
i am not circul anyth i wa tell you privat repli
eliza still try to be bold
i am glad to hear it i understand that neither you nor your brother
have spoken of thi extraordinari tale and i am quit certain that you
will not speak of it in the futur
i cannot answer for my brother she said sulkili
no but in hi own interest and in your i trust that you will make him
understand that if i hear a word of thi i shall hold him to account
also that hi propag of such a slander will react upon you who
were with him
how ask eliza now thoroughli frighten for when he chose the
colonel could be veri crush
thu your brother evid is that of an interest person which no
on will accept and of your miss layard it might be infer that
it wa actuat by jealousi of a charm and quit innoc girl or
perhap by other motiv even wors which i would rather you did not
ask me to suggest
eliza did not ask him she wa too wise as she knew well when rous
the colonel wa a man with a bitter tongu and a good memori
i am sure i am the last person who would wish to do mischief she said
in a humbl voic
of cours i know that i know that well now we understand each
other so i must be turn home thank you so much for have been
quit candid with me good morn miss layard rememb me to
stephen
phew reflect the colonel to himself that battl is wonaft a
fashionbut just about fortyeight hour too late by thi time that
vixen of a woman ha put the stori all over the place oh morri you
egregi ass if you want to take to kiss like a schoolboi why
the deuc did you select the high road for the purpos thi must be put
a stop to i must take step and at onc thei mustnt be seen togeth
again or there will be troubl with mari but how to do it how to do
it that is the question and on to which i must find an answer within
the next two hour what a kettl of fish what a pretti kettl of
fish
in due cours and after dilig search he found the answer to thi
question
at lunch time the colonel remark casual that he had walk a littl
wai with miss layard who mention that she had seen themi hi
son and miss fregeliusstruggl through the gale the other night
then he watch the effect of thi shot morri move hi chair and
look uncomfort clearli he wa a most transpar sinner but on
stella it took no effect
as usual reflect the colonel the ladi ha the most control
or perhap he tri to kiss her and she wouldnt let him and a
conscious of virtu give her strength
after luncheon the colonel paid a visit to mr fregeliu ostens to
talk to him about the propos restor of the chancel for which
he as holder of the great tith wa jointli liabl with the rector a
respons that in the alter circumst of the famili he now
felt himself abl to face when thi subject wa exhaust which did
not take long as mr fregeliu refus to express ani posit
opinion until he had inspect the church the colonel manner grew
portent solemn
my dear sir he said there is anoth matter a somewhat grave
on upon which for both our sake and the sake of those immedi
concern i feel bound to sai a few word
mr fregeliu who wa a timid man look veri much alarm a
convict that the grave matter had someth to do with stella
flash into hi mind but all he said wa
i am afraid i dont understand colonel monk
no inde how should you well to come to the point it ha to do
with that veri charm daughter of your and my son morri
i fear as much groan the clergyman
inde i thought you said you did not understand
no but i guess wherev stella goe thing seem to happen
exactli well thing have happen here to be brief i mean that a
lot of silli women have got up a scandal about themno scandal is too
strong a wordgossip
what is alleg ask mr fregeliu faintli
well that your daughter threw over that young ass stephen layard
becauseth stori seem to me incred i admitsh had fallen
violent in love with morri further that she and the said morri were
seen embrac at night on the rectori road which i dont believ as
the wit ar layard who is prejud and hi sister who is the
most illbr bitter and disappoint woman in the counti lastli
and thi is no doubt true that thei ar gener on term of great
intimaci and we all know where that lead to between a man and
womanplato thy confound fantasi etc you see when peopl sit
up sing to each other alon till two in the morningi dont mean
that morri sing he ha no more voic than a crow he doe the
appreci audiencewel other peopl will talk wont thei
i suppos so the world be what it is sigh mr fregeliu
exactli the world be what it is and men and women what thei ar a
most unregener lot and au fond veri primit as i daresai you mai
have observ
what is to be done
well under other circumst i should have said noth at all
except congratul them most heartili more especi my son but in
thi case there ar reason which make such a cours imposs as you
know morri is engag to be marri to my niec miss porson and it
is a contract which even if he wish it honour would forbid him to
break for famili as well as for person reason
quit so quit so it is not to be thought of but again i askwhat
is to be done
is that not rather a question for you to consid i suggest that you
had better speak to your daughter just a hint you know just a hint
upon my word id rather not stella can be sodecidedat time and
we never seem quit to understand each other i did speak to her the
other dai when mr layard wish to marri her a match i wa natur
anxiou for but the result were not satisfactori
still i think you might try
veri well i will try and colonel monk i cannot tell you how griev
i am to have brought all thi troubl on you
not a bit answer the colonel cheerfulli i am an old student of
human natur and i rather enjoi it it like watch the puppet on a
stage onli we mustnt let the comedi grow into a tragedi
ah that what i am afraid of some tragedi stella is a woman who
take thing hard and if ani affect realli ha sprung up
it will no doubt evapor with the usual hyster and morn
headach bless me i have known dozen of them and felt some myself in
my timeth headach i mean not the other thing dont be alarm
if she get angri mr fregeliu but just appeal to her reason she
will see the forc of it afterward
an hour or so later the colonel start for a walk on the beach to
look at some damag which a high tide had done to the cliff as he
wa near the abbei step on hi return he saw the figur of a woman
stand quit still upon the sand an inspect through hi eyeglass
reveal that it wa stella and instinct told him her errand
thi is rather awkward he thought as he brace himself to battl
especi as i like that girl and dont want to hurt her feel
hullo miss fregeliu ar you take the air you should walk or you
will catch cold
no colonel monk i wa wait for you
wait for me me thi is inde an honour and on which ag
appreci
she wave asid hi twoedg badinag you have been speak to my
father she said
instantli the colonel assum a seriou manner not the most seriou
such as he wore at funer but still on suit to a grave occas
ye i have
you rememb all that you said
certainli miss fregeliu and i assum that for the purpos of thi
convers it need not be repeat
she bow her head and repli i have come to explain and to tell you
three thing first that all these stori ar fals except that about
the sing secondli that whoever is respons for them ha made it
imposs that i should live in monksland so i am go to london to
earn my own live there and thirdli that i hope you will excus my
absenc from dinner as i think the more i keep to myself until we go
tomorrow the better though i reserv to myself the right to speak to
mr monk on thi subject and to sai goodby to him
she is take it hard and she is fond of himdeuc fond of
him poor girl thought the colonel but aloud he said my dear miss
fregeliu i never believ the stori as for the princip on
common sens rebel against it all i said to your father wa that
there appear to be a lot of talk about the place and under the
circumst of my son engag that he might perhap give you a
friendli hint
oh inde he did not put it quit like that he gave me to understand
that you had told himthat i wassoso much in love with mr monk
that on thi account i hadreject mr layard
pleas keep walk said the colonel or you realli will catch
cold then suddenli he stop look her sharpli in the face much
as he had done to eliza and said well and ar you not in love with
him
for a moment stella stare at him indignantli then suddenli he saw a
blush spread upon her face to be follow by an intens pallor while
the pupil of the love ey enlarg themselv and grew soft next
instant she put her hand to her heart totter on her feet and had he
not caught her would perhap have fallen
i do not think i need troubl you to answer my question which inde
now that i think of it wa on i had no right to put he said as she
recov herself
oh my god moan stella wring her hand i never knew it till
thi moment you have brought it home to me you ye you and she
burst out weep
here ar the hyster thought the colonel and i am afraid that the
headach will be bad tomorrow morn
to her howev he said veri tenderli my dear girl my dear girl
prai do not distress yourself these littl accid will happen in the
best regul heart and believ me you will get over it in a month
or two
accid she said it is no accid it is fatei see it all
nowand i shall never get over it howev that is my own affair and
i have no right to troubl you with my misfortun
oh but you will inde and though you mai think the advic hard i
will tell you the best wai
she look up in inquiri
chang your mind and marri stephen layard he is not at all a bad
fellow andther ar obviou advantag
thi wa the colonel first realli fals move as he himself felt
befor the last word had left hi lip
colonel monk she said becaus i am unfortun is it ani reason
that you should insult me
miss fregeliu to my knowledg i have never insult ani woman and
certainli i should not wish to begin with on who ha just honour me
with her confid
is it not an insult she answer with a sort of sob when a woman
to her shame and sorrow ha confessedwhat i haveto bid her consol
herself by marriag with anoth man
now that you put it thu i confess that perhap some mind might so
interpret an intent which did not exist it seem to me that after
a while in marriag you would most easili forget a troubl which my son
so unworthili ha brought on you
dont blame him for he doe not deserv it if anybodi is to blame it
is i but in truth all those stori ar fals we have neither of us
done anyth
do not press the point miss fregeliu i believ you
we have neither of us done anyth she repeat and what is more
if you had not interf i do not think that i should have found out
the truth or at least not yettil i saw him marri perhap when
it would have been no matter
when you see a man walk in hi sleep you do your best to stop him
said the colonel
and so caus him to fall over the precipic and be dash to bit oh
you should have let me finish my journei then i should have come back
to the bed that i have made to lie on and wake to find myself alon
and nobodi would have been hurt except myself who caus the evil
the colonel could not continu thi branch of the convers even to
him a harden vessel as he had defin himself it wa too pain
you said you mean to earn a live in london how
by my voic and violin if on can sing and plai with a sore heart i
have an old aunt a sister of my father who is a music mistress with
whom i daresai i can arrang to live and who mai be abl to get me some
introduct
i hope that i can help you there and i will to the best of my abil
inde if necessari i will go to town and see about thing allow me
to add thi miss fregeliu that i think you ar do a veri brave
thing and what is more a veri wise on and i believ that befor
long we shall hear of you as the great new contralto
she shrug her shoulder it mai be i dont care goodby by the
wai i wish to see mr monk onc more befor i go it would be better
for us all i suppos that you dont object to that do you
miss fregeliu my son is a man advanc toward middl ag it is
entir a point for you and him to decid and i will onli sai that i
have everi confid in you
thank you she answer and turn walk rapidli down the lone
beach till her figur melt into the gather gloom of the winter
night onc howev when she thought that she wa out of eyeshot he
saw her stop with her face toward the vast and bitter sea and saw also
that she wa wring her hand in an agoni of the uttermost despair
she look like a ghost said the colonel aloud with a littl shiver
like a helpless homeless ghost with the world behind her and the
infinit in front and noth to stand on but a patch of shift sand
wet with her own tear
when the colonel grew thu figur and poetic it mai be surmis by
anyon who ha taken the troubl to studi hi mix and somewhat worldli
charact that he wa deepli move and he wa move more so inde
than he had been sinc the death of hi wife why he would have found
it hard to explain on the face of it the stori wa of a trivial order
and in some of it aspect rather absurd two young peopl who happen
to be congeni but on of whom wa engag chanc to be thrown
togeth for a coupl of month in a countri hous although there
is some gossip noth at all occur between them beyond a littl
perfectli natur flirtat the young man father hear the
gossip speak to the young ladi in order that she mai take step to
protect herself and hi son against surmis and misinterpret
thereupon a sudden flood of light break upon her soul by which she
see that she is realli attach to the young man and be a woman of
unusu charact or perhap absurdli avers to ly even upon such
a subject in answer to a question admit that thi is so and that she
veri properli intend to go awai
could anyth be more commonplac more in the natur order of event
why then wa he move oh it wa that woman face and ey old as
he might be he felt jealou of hi son jealou to think that for him
such a woman could wear thi counten of wonder and thrill woe
what wa there in morri that it should have call forth thi depth of
passion undefil now if there were no marybut there wa a mari it
wa folli to pursu such a line of thought
from sympathi for stella which wa deep and genuin to anger with
hi son prove to the colonel an easi step morri wa that worst of
sinner a hypocrit morri be engag to on woman had taken
advantag of her absenc deliber to involv the affect of
anoth or at ani rate caus her consider inconveni he wa
wroth with morri and what wa more befor he grew an hour older he
would let him have a piec of hi mind
he found the sinner in hi workshop the chapel make mathemat
calcul the veri sight of which ad to hi father indign
the man he reflect to himself who under these circumst could
indulg an abnorm talent for mathemat especi on sundai must
be a coldblood brute he enter the place slam the door behind
him and morri look up note with alarm for he hate row that
there wa war in hi ey
wont you take a chair father he said
no thank you i would rather sai what i have to sai stand
what is the matter
the matter is sir that i find that by your attent you have made
that poor girl miss fregeliu while she wa a guest in my hous the
object of slander and scandal to everi illnatur gossip in the three
parish
morriss quiet thought ey flash in an omin and unusu
manner
if you were not my father he said i should ask you to chang your
tone in speak to me on such a subject but as thing ar i suppos
that i must submit to it unless you choos otherwis
the fact morri answer hi father justifi ani languag that i
can us
did you get these fact from stephen layard and miss layard ah i
guess as much well the stori is a lie i wa mere arrang her
hood which she could not do herself as the wind forc her to us her
hand to hold her dress down
the thought of hi own ingenu in hit on the right solut of the
stori mollifi the colonel not a littl
pshaw he said i knew that do you suppos that i believ you fool
enough to kiss a girl on the open road when you had everi opportun of
kiss her at home i know too that you have never kiss her at all
or ostens at ani rate done anyth that you shouldnt do
what is my offenc then ask morri
your offenc is that you have got her talk about that you have made
her in love with youdont deni it i have it from her own lip that
you have driven her out of thi place to earn a live in london as best
she mai and that be yourself an engag manher onc more the
colonel drew a bow at a venturey ar what is call in love with
her yourself
these two were easi victim to the skill of so experienc an archer
the shaft went home between the joint of hi son har and morri
sank back in hi chair and turn white generos or perhap the fear
of excit more unpleas consequ prevent the colonel from
follow up thi head of hi advantag
there is more a great deal more behind he went on for instanc
all thi will probabl come to mari ear
certainli it will i shall tell her of it myself
which will be tantamount to break your engag mai i ask if that
is your intent
no but suppos that all you sai were true and that it wa my
intent what then
then sir to my oldfashion idea you would be a dishonour
fellow to cast awai the woman who ha onli you to look to in the world
that you mai put anoth woman who ha taken your fanci in her place
morri bit hi lip
still speak on that supposit he repli would it not be more
dishonour to marri her would it not be kinder shame as it mai
be to tell her all the truth and let her seek some worthier man
the colonel shrug hi shoulder i cant split hair he said
or enter on an argument of sentiment casuistri but i tell you thi
morri although you ar my onli son and the last of our name that
rather than do such a thing under all the circumst it would be
better that you should take a pistol and blow your brain out
veri probabl answer morri but would you mind tell me
also what ar the exact circumst which would in your opinion so
aggrav thi particular case
you have a copi of your uncl porson will in that drawer give it
me
morri obei and hi father search for and read the follow
sentenc in consider of the forthcom marriag between hi
son morri and my daughter mari the said testat remit all debt
and oblig that mai be due to hi estat by the said richard monk
lieuten colonel companion of the bath and an executor of thi
will
well said morri
well repli the colonel coolli those debt in all amount
to 19543 pound no wonder you seem astonish but thei have been
accumul for a score of year there the fact ani wai so
discuss is no us now do you understand in consider of the
forthcom marriag rememb
i shall be rich some dai that machin you laugh at will make me rich
alreadi i have been approach i might repai thi monei
ye and you might not such hope and expect have a wai of
come to noth besid hang it all morri you know that there is
more than monei in the question
morri hid hi face in hi hand for a moment when he remov them it
wa ashen ye he said thing ar unfortun you rememb that
you were veri anxiou that i should engag myself and mari wa so good
as to accept me perhap i cannot sai i should have done better to
have wait till i felt some real impuls toward marriag howev
that is all gone by and father you need not be in the least afraid
there is not the slightest fear that i shall attempt to do anyth of
which you would disapprov
i wa sure you wouldnt old fellow answer the colonel in a
friendli tone not when you came to think matter seem to have got
into a bit of a tangl dont thei most unfortun that charm young
ladi be brought to thi hous in such a fashion realli it look
like a spite of what she call fate howev i have no doubt that it
will all straighten itself somehow by the wai she told me that she
should wish to see you onc to sai goodby befor she went dont be
vex with me if should she do so i suggest to you to be veri care
your posit will be exceedingli pain and exceedingli danger and
in a moment all your fine resolut mai come to noth though i am
sure that she doe not wish ani such thing poor dear unless she realli
seek thi interview i think inde it would be best avoid
morri made no answer and the colonel went awai somewhat weari and
sorrow for onc he had seen too much of hi puppetshow
chapter xvi

stella did not appear at dinner that night or at breakfast next dai in
the cours of the morn grow impati for he had explan to

abbei farm nor inde were the name of the depart guest so much
as mention at dinner that night the incid of their long stai at
the abbei with all it curiou complic wa close and both
father and son by tacit agreement determin to avoid all refer to
it at ani rate for the present
the christma ev of that year will long be rememb in monksland and
all that stretch of coast as the dai of the great gale which wrought
so much damag on it shore the winter dawn wa of extraordinari
beauti for all the eastern sky might have been compar to on vast
flower with a heart of burnish gold and sepal and petal of mani
colour fire slowli from a central point it open slowli it
splendour spread across the heaven then suddenli it seem to wither
and die till where it had been wa noth but mass of grei vapour
that aros gather and coalesc into an ashen pall hang low
abov the surfac of the ashen sea the coastguard watch the glass
hoist their warn cone although as yet there wa no breath of wind
and old sailormen hang about in knot on the cliff and beach went
to haul up their boat as high as thei could drag them know that it
would blow hard by night
about middai the sea began to be troubl as though it wave were
be push on by some forc as yet unseen and befor two oclock
gust of cold air from the noreast travel landward off the ocean
with a low moan sound which wa veri strang to hear
as morri trudg along toward the dead church he notic as we do
notic such thing when our mind ar much preoccupi and oppress
that these gust were come quicker and quicker although still
separ from each other by period of aerial calm then he rememb
that a great gale had been prophesi in the weather report and
thought to himself that thei portend it arriv
he reach the church by the narrow spit of sand and shingl which still
connect it with the shore pass through the door in the rough brick
wall close it behind him and paus to look alreadi under that
heavi sky the light which struggl through the brineencrust eastern
window wa dim and grei present howev he discov the figur

so be it to both of us for ever and for ever he answer
thi then wa their marriag and as thei walk hand in hand awai
from the ancient altar which sure had never seen so strang a rite
there return to morri an idl fantasi which had enter hi mind at
thi veri spot when thei land on morn halffrozen after that night
in the open boat but he said noth of it for with the memori came
a recollect of certain wander word which that same dai fell from
stella lip word at the thought of which hi spirit thrill and hi
flesh shudder what if she were near it or he were near it or both
of them what if thi solemn ceremoni of marriag mock yet made
divin had taken place upon the veri threshold of it immort
consumm she read hi thought and answer
rememb alwai far and near it is the same thing time is noth
thi oath of our cannot be touch by time or earthli chang
i will rememb he answer
what more did thei sai he never could be sure nor doe it matter for
what is written bear it gist
go awai first she said present i promis your father that i
would bring no further troubl on you so we must not be seen togeth
go now for the gale is rise fast and the dark grow
thi is hard to bear he mutter set hi teeth ar you sure
that we shall not meet again in after year
sure you look your last upon me on the earthli stella whom you know
and love
it must be done he said
it must be done she echo goodby husband till that appoint
hour of meet when i mai call you so without shame and she held out
her hand
he took and press it speak he could not then like a man stricken in
year he pass down the church with bent head and shambl feet at
the door he turn to look at her she wa stand erect and proud as a
conqueror her hand rest upon the altar even at that distanc their
ey met and in her lit with a wild and sudden rai from the sink
sun he could see a strang light shine then he went out of the door
and drag it to behind him to battl hi wai homeward through the
roar gale that stung and buffet him like all the gather spite
and hammer of destini
thi then wa their part a part pure and stern and high
unsolac by on soft word unsweeten by a singl kiss yet it seem
fit that those who hope to meet in the light of the spirit should
make their last farewel on earth beneath such solemn shadow
and stella after all she wa but a woman a woman with a veri human
heart she knew the truth inde to whom it wa given to see befor
the due determin time of vision but still she wa troubl with that
human heart and weigh down by the flesh over which she triumph now
that he wa gone pride and strength seem both to leav her and with
a low cry like the cry of a wound seabird she cast herself down
there upon the cold stone befor the altar and wept till her sens
left her
a great gale roar and howl the water driven onward by it
furiou breath beat upon the eastern cliff till these melt like snow
beneath them take awai field and church town and protect wall
and in return cast up the wreck of ship and the bodi of dead men
morri could not sleep who could sleep in such an aw tempest who
could sleep that had pass through such a part oh hi heart
ach and he wa as on sick to death and with him continu wa the
thought of stella and befor him came the vision of her ey he could
not sleep so rise he dress himself and went to the window high
in the heaven swept clean of cloud by the furiou blast float a
wander moon throw her ghastli light upon the swirl furiou
sea shoreward rush the great roller in unend line there to
break in thunder and seeth across the shingl till the seawal stop
them and sent the sprai fly upward in thin white cloud
god help those in the power of the sea tonight thought morri for
mani of them will not keep christma here
then it seem to hi mind excit by storm and sorrow as though some
power were draw him as though some voic were tell him that there
wa that which he must hear aimlessli halfunconsci he wander
to hi workshop in the old chapel turn on on of the lamp and stood
at the window watch the majest progress of the storm and think
think think
while he remain thu suddenli thrill hi nerv as though with a
quick shock of pain sharp and clear even in that roar and turmoil rang
out the sound of an electr bell he start round and look ye
as he thought in all the laboratori there wa onli on bell that could
ring none other had it batteri charg and that bell wa attach
to the aerophon whereof the twin stood upon the altar in the dead
church the instrument wa on of the pair with which he had carri out
hi experi of the last two month
hi heart stood still great god what could have caus that bell
to ring it could not ring it wa a physic imposs unless
somebodi were handl the sister instrument and at four oclock in the
morn who could be there and except on who would know it work
with a bound he wa by the aerophon and had given the answer signal
then instantli as though she were stand at hi side in the room
for thi machin doe not blur the voic or heighten it tone he heard
stella speak
is it you who answer me she ask
ye ye he said but where ar you at thi hour of the night
where you left me in the dead church float back the quick repli
through the rave breadth of storm listen after you went my
strength gave out and i suppos that i faint at least a littl while
ago i woke up from a deep sleep to find myself ly befor the alter
here i wa frighten for i knew that it must be far into the night
and an aw gale is blow which shake the whole church i went to
the door and open it and by the light of the moon i saw that between
me and the shore li a rage sea hundr of yard wide then i came
back and threw out my mind to you and tri to wake you if you slept
tri to make you understand that i wish you to go to the aerophon
and hear me
i will get help at onc broke in morri
i beg you came back the voic i beg you do not stir the time
is veri short alreadi the wave ar dash against the wall of the
chancel and i hear the water rumbl in the vault beneath my feet
listen her voic ceas and in place of it there swell the shriek
of the storm which beat about the dead church the rush too of the
water in the hollow vault and the crash of old coffin as thei were
wash from their nich anoth instant and stella had cut off these
sound and wa speak again
it is useless to think of help no boat noth could live upon that
fear sea moreov within five minut thi church must fall and
vanish
my god my god wail morri
do not griev it is a wast of preciou time and do not stir till the
end i want you to know that i did not seek thi death i never dream
of such a thing you must tell my father so and bid him not to mourn
for me it wa my intent to leav the church within ten minut of
yourself thi cup is given to me by the hand of fate i did not fill
it do you hear and understand
i hear and understand answer morri
now you see she went on that our talk todai wa almost inspir
my web is woven my pictur is paint and to me heaven sai hold
the thought that it might be so wa in your mind wa it not

that i love you now and for ever and for ever that i will rememb
everyth and that i know beyond a doubt that you have seen and speak
the truth
thank you for those bless word and for thi life fare you well
for a moment there wa silenc or at least stella voic wa silent
while morri stood over the aerophon the sweat run from hi face
rock like a drunken man in hi agoni and wait for the end then
suddenli loud clear and triumphant broke upon hi ear the sound of
that song which he had heard her sing upon the sink ship when her
death seem near the ancient song of the overlord onc more at
the last mortal ebb while the water rose about her breast stella
instinct and blood had assert themselv and forget aught els
she wa dy as her pagan forefath had di with the secret ancient
chant upon her lip ye she sang as skarphedinn the hero sang while
the flame at out hi life
the song swell on and the great water boom an accompani then
came a sound of crash wall and for a moment it ceas onli to
rise again still clearer and more triumphant again a crasha seeth
hissand the instrument wa silent for it twin wa shatter
shatter also wa the fair shape that held the spirit of stella
again and again morri spoke eagerli entreatingli but the aerophon
wa dumb so he ceas at length and even then well nigh laugh when
he thought that in thi useless piec of mechan he saw a symbol of
hi own soul which also had lost it mate and could hold true convers
with no other
then he start up and just as he wa ran out into the rave night
three hour later when the sun rose upon christma dai if ani had been
there to note him thei might have seen a dishevel man stand alon
upon the lone shore there he stood the backwash of the mighti
comber hiss about hi knee as he look seaward beneath the hollow
of hi hand at a spot some two hundr yard awai where on by on
their long line were broken into a churn yeast of foam
morri knew well what broke themth fallen ruin of the church that
wa now stella sepulchr and oh in that dark hour he would have
been glad to seek her where she lai
chapter xvii
the return of mari
curious enough indirectli but in fact it wa the circumst of
stella sudden and mysteri death that made morri a rich and famou
man and caus hi invent of the aerophon to come into common us
veri earli on the follow morn but not befor she wa miss from
the rectori and sought far and wide on of the first place visit
by those who search wa the abbei whither thei met morri return
through the gale wildei flyinghair and altogeth strang to
see thei ask him if he knew what had becom of miss fregeliu
ye he repli she ha been crush or drown in the ruin of the
dead church which wa swept awai by the gale last night
then thei stare and ask how he knew thi he answer that be
unabl to sleep that night on account of the storm he had gone into hi
workshop when hi attent wa suddenli attract by the bell of the
aerophon by mean of which he learn that miss fregeliu had been
cut off from the shore in the church he ad that he ran as hard as he
could to the spot onli to find at dawn that the build had entir
vanish in the gale and that the sea had encroach upon the land by
at least two hundr pace
of cours these statement concern the aerophon and it capabl
were report all over the world and much criticisedveri roughli in
some quarter thereupon morri offer to demonstr the truth of what
he had said the controversi prove sharp but of thi he wa glad
it wa a solac to him perhap even it prevent him from plung
headlong into mad at first he wa stun he did not feel
veri much then the first effect of the blow pass a sens of the
swift and inevit of thi aw consumm seem to sink
down into hi heart and crush him the complet of the tragedi it
greekplai qualiti were overwhelm question and answer seed
and fruitther wa no space for thought or growth between them the
curtain wa down upon the tempor and lo almost befor it fold had
shaken to their place it had risen upon the etern hi natur
reel beneath thi knowledg and hi loss had it not been for those
suspicion and attack it might have fallen
the detail of the struggl need not be enter into as thei have
littl to do with the lifestori of morri monk it is enough to sai
that in the end he more than carri out hi promis under the severest
condit and in the presenc of variou scientif bodi and other
expert
afterward came the natur result the great aerophon compani wa
float in which morri as vendor receiv half the sharesh would
take no cashwhich share by the wai soon stood at five and a
quarter also he found himself a note man wa ask to deliv an
address befor the british associ wa nomin on the council
of a lead scientif societi and in due cours after a year or
two receiv on of the greatest compliment that can be paid to an
englishman that of be elect to it fellowship as a distinguish
person by the committe of a famou club thu did morri prosper
greatlyveri greatli and in mani differ wai but with all thi
part of hi life we ar scarc concern
on the dai of hi daughter death morri visit mr fregeliu for
whom he had a messag he found the old man utterli crush and broken
the last of the blood mr monk he moan when morri hoarsevo
and slowword had convinc him of the detail of the dread fact
the last of the blood and i left childless at least you will feel for
me and with me you will understand
it will be seen that although outsid of some loos talk in the villag
which indirectli had produc result so terribl no on had ever
suggest such a thing curious enough by some intuit process mr
fregeliu who to a certain extent at ani rate guess hi daughter
mind took it for grant that she had been in love with morri he
seem to know also by the same deduct process that he wa attach
to her
i do inde said morri with a sad smile think that if onli
the clergyman could look into hi heart he would perhap be somewhat
astonish at the depth of that understand sympathi
i told you went on mr fregeliu and you laugh at me that it wa
most unlucki her have sung that hate nors song the greet to
death when you found her upon the steamer trondhjem
everyth ha been unlucki mr fregeliusor lucki he ad beneath
hi breath but you will like to know that she di sing it the
aerophon told me that
mr monk the old man said catch hi arm my daughter wa a
strang woman a veri strang woman and sinc i heard thi dread
new i have been afraid that perhap she wasunhappi she wa leav
her home on your accounty on your account it no us pretend
otherwis although no on ever told me soandthat she knew the
church wa go to be wash awai
she thought you might think so answer morri and he gave
him stella last messag moreov he told him more of the real
circumst than he reveal to anybodi els he told him what nobodi
els ever knew for on that lone coast none had seen him enter or
leav the place how he had met her in the churchabout the remov of
the instrument as he left it to be inferredand at her wish had come
home alon becaus of the gossip which had arisen he explain also
that accord to her own stori from some unexplain caus she had
fallen asleep in the church after hi departur and awaken to find
herself surround by the water with all hope gone
and now she is dead now she is dead groan mr fregeliu and i am
alon in the world
i am sorri for you said morri simpli but there it is it is no us
look backward we must look forward
ye look forward both of us sinc she is hidden from both you see
almost from the first i knew you were fond of her ad the clergyman
simpli
ye he answer i am fond of her though of that the less said the
better and becaus our case is the same i hope that we shall alwai be
friend
you ar veri kind i shall need a friend now i am alon now quit
alon and my heart is broken
here it mai be ad that morri wa even better than hi word out of
the wealth that came to him in such plenti for instanc he wa care
to augment the old man resourc without offend hi feel by
ad perman and larg to the endow of the live also he
attend to hi want in mani other wai which need not be enumer
and not least by constantli visit him mani were the odd hour and
the even that shall be told of later which thei spent togeth
smoke their pipe in the rectori studi and talk of her who had
gone and whose lost life wa the strongest link between them otherwis
and elsewher except upon a few extraordinari occas her name
rare pass the lip of morri
yet within himself he mourn and mourn although even in the first
bitter not as on without hope he knew that she had spoken truth
that she wa not dead but onli for a while out of hi sight and
hear
ten dai had pass and for morri ten weari almost sleepless night
the tragedi of the destruct of the new rector daughter in the ruin
of the dead church no longer occupi the tongu of men and paragraph
in paper on dai the sea gave up the hood of her brown ulster the
same that morri had been seen arrang by stephen and eliza layard it
wa found upon the beach after thi even the local polic admit that
the conjectur as to her end must be true and sinc for the lack
of anyth to hold it on there could be no inquest the excit
dwindl and di nor inde as her father announc that he wa
quit satisfi as to the circumst of hi daughter death wa
ani formal inquiri held concern them a few peopl howev still
believ that she wa not realli drown but had gone awai secretli for
unknown privat reason the world rememb few peopl even if thei
be distinguish for ten whole dai it ha not time for such
longcontinu recollect of the dead thi world of the live who
hurri on to join them
if thi is the case with the illustri the wealthi and the power
how much more must it be so in the instanc of an almost unknown girl a
stranger in the land morri and her father rememb her for she
wa part of their live and live on with their live stephen layard
mourn for the woman whom he had wish to marryfierc at first
with the sharp pain of disappoint passion then intermitt and at
last after he wa comfort wed to somebodi els with a mild and
sentiment regret three or four time a year eliza too when onc
convinc that she wa realli dead wa much shock and talk
vagu of the judgment and dispens of provid as though thi
victim were preemin deserv of it most stern decre it wa
rumour howev among the observ that her christian sorrow wa
perhap temper by a secret relief at the absenc of a rival who as
she now admit sang extrem well and had beauti ey
the colonel also thought of the guest whom the sea had given and taken
awai and with a real regret for thi girl forc talent and
loveli had touch and impress him who had suffici intellect
and experi to know that she wa a person cast in a rare and nobl
mould but to morri he never mention her name no further confid
had pass between them on the matter yet he knew that to hi son thi
name wa holi therefor be in some wai a wise man he thought it
well to keep hi lip shut and to let the dead buri their dead
by all the rest stella fregeliu wa soon as much forgotten as though
she had never walk the world or breath it air that gale had done
much damag and taken awai mani livesal down the coast wa heard the
voic of mourn her chanc to be on of them and there wa noth
to be said
on the morn of the eleventh dai came a telegram from mari address
to morri and date from london it wa brief and to the point come
to dinner with me at seaview and bring your fathermari
when morri drove to seaview that even he wa as a man is in a dream
sorrow had done it work on him agonis hi nerv till at length
thei seem to be blunt as with a veri excess of pain much as the
nerv of the victim of the inquisit were sometim blunt till
at length thei could scarc feel the pincer bite or the iron burn
alwai abstemi also for thi last twelv dai he had scarc
swallow enough food to support him with the result that hi bodi
weaken and suffer with hi mind
then there wa a third troubl to contend withth dull and gnaw
sens of shame which seem to eat into hi heart in actual fact he
had been faith enough to mari but in mind he wa most unfaith
how could he come to her the woman who wa to be hi wife the woman
who had dealt so well by him with the memori of that spiritu marriag
at the altar of the dead church still burn in hi brainthat
marriag which now wa consecr and immortalis by death what had
he to give her that wa worth her take he who if the truth were
known shrank from all idea of union with ani earthli woman who long
onli to be allow to live out hi time in a solitud as complet as he
could find or fashion it wa monstrou it wa shame and then and
there he determin that befor ever he stood in monksland church by the
side of mari porson at least he would tell her the truth and give
her leav to choos to hi other sin against her deceit should not be
ad
might i suggest morri said the colonel who as thei drove had
been watch hi son face furtiv by the light of the brougham
lampmight i suggest that under all the circumst mari would

can guess the rest
perfectli said mari in a quiet voic if eliza wa concern in it
but pleas go on with the stori
well the gossip came to my ear
through eliza queri mari
through elizawho said and he told her about the incid of
the ulster and the dogcart ad that he believ it to be entir
untru
as mari made no comment he went on i forgot to sai that miss fregeliu
seem to have refus to marri stephen layard who fell violent in
love with her which to my mind account for some of thi gossip
still i thought it my duti and the best thing i could do to give
a friendli hint to the old clergyman stella father a funni
witheredup old boi by the wai he seem to have spoken to hi daughter
rather indiscreetli whereon she waylaid me as i wa walk on the
sand and inform me that she had made up her mind to leav thi place
for london where she intend to earn her own live by sing and
plai on the violin i must tell you that she plai splendidli and
in my opinion had on of the most gloriou contralto voic that i ever
heard
she seem to have been a veri attract young woman said mari in
the same quiet contempl voic
i think went on the colonel take her all in all she wa about the
most attract young woman that ever i saw poor thing upon my word
dear old as i am i fell half in love with her myself and so would you
if you had seen those ey of her
i rememb broke in mari that old mr tomlei after he return
from inspect the northumberland live spoke about miss fregeliuss
wonder eyesat the dinnerparti you know on the night when morri
propos to me and she shiver a littl as though she had turn
suddenli cold
well let me go on with my stori after she had told me thi and i
had promis to help her with introductionsexactli why or how i
forgetbut i ask her flat out if she wa in love with morri
thereoni assur you my dear mari it wa the most pain scene in
all my long experienceth poor thing turn white as a sheet and
would have fallen if i had not caught hold of her when she came to
herself a littl she admit frankli that thi wa her case but
addedof which of cours on mai believ as much as on like that
she had never known it until i ask the question
i think that quit possibl said mari and realli uncl to me your
crossexamin seem to have been slightli indiscreet
possibl my dear veri possibl even solomon might be excus for
occasion make a mistak where the mysteri articl which young
ladi call their heart ar concern i tell what happen that is
all shall i go on
if you pleas
well after thi she announc that she meant to see morri onc to sai
goodby to him befor she went to london and left me practic the
next thing i heard about her wa that she wa dead
did she commit suicid ask mari
it is said not it is suggest that after morriss interview with her
in the dead churchfor i gather there wa an interview though nobodi
know about it and that where thei metsh fell asleep which
sound an odd thing to do in the midst of such a gale as wa rage on
christma ev and so wa overwhelm but who can sai impression
and unhappi women have done such deed befor now especi if thei
imagin themselv to have becom the object of gossip of cours also
the mere possibl of such a thing have happen on hi account
would be and inde ha been enough to drive a man like morri crazi
with grief and remors
what had he to be remors for ask mari if a young woman
chanc to fall in love with him why should he be blame or blame
himself for that after all peopl affect ar in their own
keep
i imagineveri littl if anyth at least i know thi that when
i spoke to him about the matter after my talk with her i gather from
what he said that there wa absolut noth between them to be quit
frank howev as i have tri to be with you my dear throughout
thi convers i also gather that thi young ladi had produc a
certain effect upon hi mind or at least that the knowledg that she
had avow herself to be attach to himwhich i am afraid i let out
for i wa in a great rageproduc some such effect well afterward
i believ although i have ask no question and am not sure of it he
went and said goodby to her in thi church at her request then thi
dread tragedi happen and there is an end of her and her stori
have you ani object in tell it to me uncl
ye my dear i have i wish you to know the real fact befor thei
reach you in whatev distort version morriss fanci or imagin
or exagger candour mai induc him to present them to you also
my dear even if you find or think you find that you have caus of
complaint against him i hope that you will see your wai to be
lenient and shut your ey a littl
sever wa never my strong point interrupt mari
for thi reason went on the colonel the young woman concern wa a
veri remark person if you could have heard her sing for instanc
you would have said so yourself it is a humili confess but
i doubt whether on young man out of a hundr singl engag or
marri could have resist be attract by her to just such an
extent as she pleas especi if he were flatter by the knowledg
that she wa genuin attract by himself
mari made no answer
didnt you sai you had some document you want me to sign she ask
present
oh ye here is the thing and he pull a paper out of hi pocket
the lawyer write that it need not be wit
mari glanc at it couldnt morri have brought thish is your
coexecutor isnt heand save you the troubl
undoubtedli he could but
but what
well if you want to know my dear said the colonel with a grave
counten just now morri is in a state in which i do not care to
leav more of thi import busi in hi hand than is necessari
what am i to understand by that uncl she said look at him
shrewdli do you mean that he isnot quit well
ye mari i mean thath is not quit well that is if my
observ goe for anyth i mean he went on with quiet vehem
i mean thatjust at present of cours he ha been so upset by thi
miser affair that for my part i wouldnt put ani confid in what
he sai about it or about anyth els the thing ha got upon hi
nerv and render him temporarili unfit for the busi of ordinari
life you know that at the best of time he is a veri peculiar man and
not quit like other peopl
well have you sign that thank you my dear by jove i must be off
i shall be late as it is i mai reli upon your discret as to what we
have been talk about mai i not but i thought it as well to let you
know how the land lai
ye uncl and thank you for take so much troubl
when the door had close behind him mari reflect awhil then she said
to herself
he think morri is a littl off hi head and ha come here to warn
me i should not be surpris and i daresai that he is right ani wai
a new troubl ha risen up between us the shadow of anoth woman poor
thing well shadow melt and the dead do not come back she seem to
have been veri charm and clever and i daresai that she fascin
him for a while but with kind and patienc it will all come
right onli i do hope that he will not insist upon make me too mani
confid
so thought mari who by natur wa forgiv gentl and an optimist
not guess how sore her patienc as an affianc wife and her
chariti as a woman of the world would be tri within the hour
from all of which it will be seen that for onc the diplomaci of the
colonel had prosper somewhat beyond it desert the depart cannot
explain or defend themselv and morriss possibl indiscret
alreadi stood discount in the onli quarter where thei might do harm
half an hour later mari sit besid the fire with her toe upon the
grate and her face to the window perceiv morri on the gravel drive
wear a preoccupi and rather wretch air she note moreov
that befor he rang the bell he paus for a moment as though to shake
himself togeth
here you ar at last she said cheerfulli as he bent down to kiss
her seven whole minut befor your time which is veri nice of you
now sit down there and get warm and we will have a good long talk
morri obei my father ha been lunch with you ha he not he
said somewhat nervous
ye dear and tell me all the new and a sad budget it seem to
be about the dread disast of the great gale and the death of that
poor girl who wa stai with you miss fregeliu
at the mention of thi name morriss face contort itself as the
face of a man might do who wa seiz with a sudden pang of sharp and
unexpect agoni
mari he said in a hoars and broken voic i have a confess to
make to you and i must make itabout thi dead woman i mean i will
not sail under fals colour you must know all the truth and then
judg
dear me she answer thi sound dreadfulli tragic but i mai as
well tell you at onc that i have alreadi heard some gossip
i daresai but you cannot have heard all the truth for it wa known
onli to me and her
now do what she would to prevent it her alarm show itself in mari
ey
what am i to understand she said in a low voiceand she look a
question
oh no he answer with a faint smile noth at all
not that you have been embrac her for instanc that i understand
is eliza layard stori
no no i never did such a thing in my life
a littl sigh of relief broke from mari lip at the worst thi wa
but an affair of sentiment
i think dear she said in her ordinari slow voic that you had
better set out the troubl in your own word with as few detail
as possibl or none at all such thing ar pain ar thei
notespeci where the dead ar concern
morri bow hi head and began you know i found her on the ship
sing as she onli could sing and she wa a veri strang and beauti
womanperhap beauti is not the word
it will do interrupt mari at ani rate you thought her
beauti
then afterward we grew intim veri intim without know it
almostinde i am not sure that we should ever have known it had it
not been for the mischiefmak of eliza layard
mai she be reward ejacul mari
well and after shethat is eliza layardhad spoken to my father he
attack mr fregeliu hi daughter and myself and it seem that she
confess to my father that she waswa
in love with younot altogeth unnatur perhap from my point of
view though of cours she oughtnt to have been so
ye and said that she wa go awai andon christma ev we met
there in the dead church then somehowfor i had no intent of such
a thingal the truth came out and i found that i wa no longer master
of myself andgod forgiv me and you mari forgiv me toothat i
love her also
and afterward said mari move her skirt a littl
and afterwardsoh it will sound strang to youw made some kind of
compact for the next world a sort of spiritu marriag i can call it
noth els then i shook hand with her and went awai and in a
few hour she wa deaddead but the compact stand mari ye that
compact stand for ever
a compact of a spiritu marriag in a place where there is no
marriag do you mean morri that you wish thi strang proceed to
destroi your physic and earthli engag to myself
no no nor did she wish it she said so but you must judg i feel
that i have done you a dread wrong and i wa determin that you
should know the worst
that wa veri good of you mari said reflect for realli there
is no reason why you should have told me thi peculiar stori morri
you have been work pretti hard late have you not
ye he repli absent i suppos i have
wa thi young ladi what is call a mystic
perhap danish peopl often ar at ani rate she saw thing more
clearli than most i mean that the futur wa nearer to her mind and in
a sens the past also
inde you must have found her a congeni companion i suppos that
you talk a good deal of these thing
sometim we did
and discov that your view were curious alik for when on
mystic meet anoth mystic and the other mystic ha beauti ey and
sing divin the spiritu marriag will follow almost as a matter
of cours what els is to be expect but i am glad that you were
faith to your principl both of you and clung fast to the ether
side of thing
morri writh beneath thi satir but find no conveni answer to
it made none
do you rememb my dear went on mari the convers we had on
dai in your workshop befor we were engagedthat year ago isnt
itabout stargaz consid as a fine art
i rememb someth he said
that i told you for instanc that it might be better if you paid a
littl more attent to matter physic lest otherwis you should go
on prai for vision till you could see and for power until you could
creat
morri nod
well and i think i saiddidnt i that if you insist upon follow
these spiritu exercis the result might be that thei would return
upon you in some concret shape and take possess of you and lead
you into compani and surround which most of us think it wholesom to
avoid
ye you said someth like that
it wasnt a bad bit of propheci wa it went on mari rub her
chin reflect and you see hi satan majesti knew veri well
how to bring about it fulfil mystic love and a wonder
mistress of music which you ador realli on would think that the
bait must have been special select
crush though he wa morriss temper began to rise beneath the lash
of mari sarcasm he knew howev that it wa her method of show
jealousi and displeasur both of them perfectli natur and did hi
best to restrain himself
i do not quit understand you he said also you ar unjust to her
not at all i daresai that in herself she wa what you think her a
perfect angel inde the descript that i have heard from your
father and yourself leav no doubt of it in my mind but even angel
have been put to bad purpos perhap their innoc make it possibl
to take advantag of them
he open hi lip to speak but she held up her hand and went on
you mustnt think me unsympathet becaus i put thing as thei appear
to my veri mundan mind look here morri it just come to thi if
thi exceedingli attract young ladi had made love to you or had
induc you to make love to her so that you ran awai with her or
anyth els of cours you would have behav badli and cruelli to me
but at least your conduct would be natur and to be explain we all
know that men do thi kind of thing and women too for the matter of
that under the influenc of passionand ar often veri sorri for it
afterward but she didnt do thi she took you on your weak side
which she understood thoroughlyprob becaus it wa her own weak
sideand outherod herod or rather outmysticis the mystic
finish up with some spiritu marriag which if it is anyth at
all is impiou what right have we to make bargain for the beyond
about which we know noth
she did know someth said morri with a sullen convict
you think she did becaus you were reduc to a state of mind in which
if she had told you that the sun goe round the earth you would quit
readili have believ her my dearest morri that wai mad li
perhap you understand now what i have been drive at and the best
proof of the absurd of the whole thing is that i stupid as i am
from my intim knowledg of your charact sinc childhood wa abl
to predict that someth of thi sort would certainli happen to you
you will admit that is a littl odd wont you
ye it odd or perhap it show that you have more of the inner
sight than you know but there were circumst about the stori which
you would find difficult to explain
not in the least in your own answer li the explanationyour
tendenc to twist thing i prophesi certain develop from my
knowledg of your charact whereupon you at onc credit me with second
sight which is absurd
i dont see the analog said morri
dont you i do all thi soul busi is just a love affair gone
wrong if circumst had been a littl differentif for instanc
there had been no mari porsoni doubt whether anybodi would have heard
much about spiritu marriag somehow i think that thing would have
settl down into a more usual groov
morri did not attempt to answer he felt that mari held all the card
and not unnatur wa in a mood to plai them moreov it wa
desecr to him to discuss stella most secret belief with ani
other woman and especi with mari their point of view were
absolut and radic differ the conflict wa a conflict between
the natur and the spiritu law or in other word between hard
brutal fact and theori as impalp as the perfum of a flower
or the sound wave that stir hi aerophon moreov he could see
clearli that mari interpret of thi stori wa simpl name
that he had fallen into temptat and that the shock of hi part
from the ladi concern follow by her sudden and violent death
had bred illus in hi mind in short that he wa slightli crazi
therefor to be well scold piti and look after rather than
sincer blame the posit wa scarc heroic or on that ani man
would choos to fill still he felt that it had it conveni that
at ani rate it must be accept
all these question ar veri much a matter of opinion he said then
ad unconsci reflect on of stella sai and i daresai
that the truth is for each of us exactli what each of us imagin it to
be
i wa alwai taught that the truth is the truth quit irrespect of
our vagu and often silli imagin the difficulti be to find out
exactli what it is
perhap answer morri declin argument which is alwai useless
between peopl ar ar determin not to sympathis with each other
view i knew that you would think my stori foolish i should never
have troubl you with it had i not felt it to be my duti for
natur the tell of such a tale put a man in a ridicul light
i dont think you ridicul morri i think that you ar suffer
slightli from shock that is all what i sai is that i detest all thi
spiritu hocuspocu to which you have alwai had a lean i fear and
hate it instinct as some peopl hate cat becaus i know that it
breed mischief and that as i said befor peopl who go on try to
see do see or fanci that thei do while we ar in the world let the
world and it limit be enough for us when we go out of the world
then the supernatur mai becom the natur and ceas to be hurt
and alarm
ye said morri those ar veri good rule well mari i have told
you the histori of thi sad adventur of which the book is now close by
death and i can onli sai that i am humili if anybodi had said
to me six month ago that i should have to come to you with such a
confess i should have answer that he wa a liar but now you
see
ye repeat mari i see
then will you give me your answer for you must judg i have told you
that you must judg
judg not that ye be not judg answer mari who am i that i
should pass sentenc on your fail good know that i have plenti
of my own if you dont believ me go and ask the nun at that convent
whatev were the right and wrong of it the thing is finish and
done with and nobodi can be more sorri for that unfortun girl than
i am also i think that you have behav veri well in come to tell me
about your troubl but then that is like you morri for you couldnt
be deceit howev hard you might try
so dear with your leav we will sai no more about stella fregeliu
and her spiritu view when i engag myself to you as i told you
at the time i did so with my ey open for better or for wors and
unless you tell me right out that you dont want me i have no intent
of chang my mind especi as you need look after and ar not
like to come across anoth stella
there i havent talk so much for month i am quit tire and
wish to forget about all these disagre i am afraid i have spoken
sharpli but if so you must make allow for such stori ar apt
to sour the sweetesttemp womenfor half an hour if i have
seem bitter and cross dear it is becaus i love you better than ani
creatur in the world and cant bear to thinkso you must forgiv
me do you morri
forgiv i forgiv he stammer overwhelm
there she said again veri softli stretch out her arm come and
give me a kiss and let us chang the subject onc and for ever i
want to tell you about my poor father he left some messag for you

chapter xix
morri the marri man
more than three year had gone by within twelv week of the date
of the convers record in the last chapter morri and mari were
marri in monksland church although the wed wa what is call
quiet on account of the recent death of the bride father the
colonel who gave her awai wa care that it should be distinguish
by a certain stamp of modest digniti which he consid to be fit
to the station and fortun of the parti to him inde thi union
wa the caus of heartfelt and earnest rejoic which is not strang
see that it meant noth less than a new leas of life to an ancient
famili that wa on the verg of disappear had morri not marri
the race would have becom extinct at ani rate in the direct line
and had he marri where there wa no monei it might as hi father
thought becom bankrupt which in hi view wa almost wors
the on terror which had haunt the colonel for year like a persist
nightmar wa that a dai seem to be at hand when the monk would be
driven from monksland where from sire to son thei had sat for so mani
gener that dai had nearli come when he wa a young man inde
it wa onli avert by hi marriag with the somewhat humbl born miss
porson who brought with her suffici dowri to enabl him to pai off
the major portion of the mortgag which then crippl the estat but
at that time agricultur flourish and the rent from the properti
were consider moreov the colonel wa never of a frugal turn of
mind so it came about that everi farth wa spent
afterward follow a period of fall revenu and unlet farm but
still the expens went on with the result as the reader know that
at the open of thi histori thing were wors than thei had ever
been and inde without the help receiv from mr porson must er
that have reach their natur end now the marriag of hi son with a
wealthi heiress set a period to all such anxieti and unless the coupl
should be disappoint of issu made it as certain as anyth can be
in thi mutabl world that for some gener to come at ani rate
the name of monk of monksland would still appear in the handbook of
counti famili
in the event these fear prove to be groundless sinc by an unexpect
turn of the wheel of chanc morri becam a rich man in reward of hi
own exert and wa thu made quit independ of hi wife larg
fortun thi howev wa a circumst which the colonel could not
be expect to forese for how could he believ that an electr
invent which he look upon as a mere scientif toi would ultim
bring it author not onli fame but an incom of mani thousand per
annum yet thi happen
other thing happen also which under the circumst were quit
as satisfactori see that within two year of hi marriag morri wa
the father of a son and daughter so that the old abbei where by the
especi request of the colonel thei had establish themselv onc
more echo to the voic of littl children
in those dai if anyon among hi acquaint had been ask to point
out an individu as prosper and happi as under the most favour
circumst it is given to a mortal to be he would unhesitatingli
have name morri monk
what wa there lack to thi man he had lineag that in hi own
neighbourhood gave him stand better than that of mani an upstart
baronet or knight and with it health and wealth he had a wife who wa
acknowledg univers to be on of the most beauti charm and
witti women in the counti whose devot to himself wa so mark and
open that it becam a public jest who had moreov present him with
healthi and promis offspr in addit to all these good thing
he had suddenli becom in hi own line on of the most famou person
in the world so that wherev civil man wa to be found there
hi name wa known as monk who invent that marvel machin the
aerophon lastli there wa no more need for him as for most of
us to stagger down hi road beneath a never lessen burden of daili
labour hi work wa done a great concept complet after half a
score of year of toil and experi had crown it with unquestion
success now he could sit at eas and watch the struggl of other less
fortun
there ar howev few men on the right side of sixti whose soul grow
healthier in idl although natur often recoil from it man wa
made to work and he who will not work call down upon himself some
curs visibl or invis as he who work although the toil seem
wast wake up on dai to find the arid wilder where he wander
strown with a manna of bless thi should be the prayer of all of
understand that whatev els it mai pleas heaven to take awai
there mai be left to them the power and the will to work through
disappoint through rebuff through utter failur even still to
work mani thing for which thei ar or ar not wholli respons ar
count to men as sin sure howev few will press more heavili
upon the beam of the balanc when at length we ar command to unfold
the talent which we have been given and earn than those fate
word lord mine li buri in it napkin or wors still lord i
have spent mine on the idl pleasur which my bodi love
therefor it wa not to the true welfar of morri when through lack of
further ambit or rather of the sting of that spur of necess which
drive most men on he rest upon hi oar and in practic abandon
hi labour drift down the tide no man of high intellig and
acquisit brain can toil arduous for a period of year and suddenli
ceas from troubl to find himself as he expect at rest for then
into the swept and garnish chamber of that empti mind enter seven
or more blue devil depress mark him for it own melancholi
forebod haunt him remors for past misde long repent of is
hi daili companion with these erinny more felt perhap than ani of
them come the devast sens that he is thwart the best instinct
of hi own natur and the divin command to labour while there is still
light becaus the night draw on apac in which no man can labour
mari wa fond of societi in which she like to be accompani by her
husband so morri whose on great anxieti wa to pleas hi wife
and fall in with her everi wish went to a great mani parti which he
hate mari like chang also so it came about that three month in the
season were spent in london where thei had purchas a hous in green
street that wa much frequent by the colonel and anoth two or
sometim three month at the villa on the riviera which mari wa veri
fond of on account of it associ with her parent
also in the summer and shoot season when thei were at home the old
abbei wa kept full of guest for we mai be sure that peopl so rich
and distinguish did not lack for friend and mari made the veri best
of hostess
thu it happen that except at the season when hi wife retir under
the pressur of domest occurr morri found that he had but
littl time left in which to be quiet that hi life in short wa no
longer the life of a worker but that of a commonplac countri gentleman
of wealth and fashion
now it wa mari who had brought these thing about and by design for
she wa not a woman to act without reason and an object it is true
that she like a gai and pleasant life for gaieti and pleasur were
agreeabl to her easi and somewhat indol mind also thei gave her
opportun of exercis her faculti of observ which were
consider
but mari wa far fonder of her husband than of those and other vaniti
inde her affect for him shone the guid star of her exist
from her childhood she had been devot to thi cousin who sinc her
earliest dai had been her playmat and at heart had wish to marri
him and no on els then he began hi experi and drift quit
awai from her afterward thing chang and thei becam engag again
the experi were carri on with the aid of anoth woman and
again he drift awai from her also the drift in thi instanc wa
attend by seriou and pain complic
now the complic had ceas to exist thei threaten her happi
no more inde had thei been much wors than thei were she would have
overlook them be altogeth convinc of the truth of the old
adag which point out the folli of cut off on nose to spite
on face whatev hi fail or shortcom morri wa her joi
the human be in whose compani she delight without whom inde
her life would be flat stale and unprofit the stronger then wa
her determin that he should not slip back into hi former cours
those cours which in the end had alwai brought about estrang
from herself
invent the detail of which she could not understand meant as
she knew well long dai and week of solitari brood therefor
invent and inde all unnecessari work were in hi case to be
discourag such solitari brood also drew from the mind of morri
a vagu mist of thought about matter esoter which to mari belief
had the properti of a miasma that crept like poison through hi be
she wish for no more stargaz no more mystic and abov all
no more memori of the interlop woman who in hi compani had
studi it doubt and danger delight
although sinc the dai of morriss confess mari had never even
mention the name of stella to him she by no mean forgot that such
a person onc exist inde carelessli and without seem to be
anxiou on the subject she inform herself about her down to the
last possibl detail so that within a few month of the death of miss
fregeliu she knew as she thought everyth that could be known of
her life at monksland moreov she saw three differ pictur of
her on a somewhat prim photograph which mr fregeliu her father
possess taken when she wa about twenti anoth a colour draw
made by morriswho wa rather clever at catch likenessesof her as
she appear sing in the chapel on the night when she had drawn the
pageboi thoma from hi slumber and the third also a photograph
taken by some local amateur of her and morri stand togeth on the
beach and engag evid in eager discuss
from these three pictur and especi from morriss sketch which
show the spiritu light shine in her ey and her face rapt as
it were in a veri ecstasi of music mari wa abl to fashion with some
certainti the like of the live woman the more she studi thi
the more she found it formid and the more she understood how it
came about that her husband had fallen into folli also she learn
to understand that there might be greater weight and mean in hi
confess than she had been inclin to allow to it at the time that
at ani rate it extravag ought not to be set down entir as
her fatherinlaw had suggest with such extrem clever to the
vagari of a mind suffer from sudden shock and alarm
all these conclus made mari anxiou by wrap her husband round
with common domest care and a web of daili social incid to
buri the memori of thi stella beneath everthicken strata of
forget not that in themselv these reminisc howev
hallow could do her ani further actual harm but becaus the train of
thought evok therebi wa as she conceiv morbid and danger to
the balanc of hi mind
the plan seem wise and good and in the case of most men probabl
would have succeed yet in morriss instanc from the commenc
it wa a failur she had begun by make hi stori and idea absurd
enough on the face of them an object of somewhat acut sarcasm if
not of ridicul thi wa a mistak sinc therebi she caus him to
suppress everi outward evid of them to lock them awai in the most
secret recess of hi heart if the lid of a caldron full of fluid is
screw down while a fire continu to burn beneath it the steam which
otherwis would have pass awai harmlessli gather and struggl till
the moment of inevit catastroph the fact that for a while the
caldron remain inert and the steam invis is no indic of
safeti to attain safeti in such a case either the fire must be rake
out or the fluid tap mari had screw down the lid of her domest
caldron but the flame still burn beneath and the water still boil
within
thi wa her first error and the second prove almost as mischiev
she thought to divert morri from a central idea by a multitud of
petti counterattract she believ that by stop him from the
scientif labour and esoter specul connect with thi idea
that it would be deaden and in time obliter
as a matter of fact by thu empti hi mind of it seriou and
accustom occup mari made room for the veri develop she
dread to flourish like an upa tree for although he breath no word
of it although he show no sign of it to morri the memori of the
dead wa a constant companion time heal all thing that is the common
sai but would it be possibl to formul ani fallaci more complet
there ar mani wound that time doe not heal and often enough against
the dead it ha no power at allfor how can time compet against the
etern of which thei have becom a part the love of them where thei
have been truli love remain quit unalt in some instanc
inde it is emdu with a power of terribl and amaz growth
on earth veri probabl that deep affect would have becom subject
to the natur influenc of weaken and decai and in the instanc
of a man and woman the soulpossess passion might have pass to
be replac by a more moder customworn affect but the dead ar
beyond the reach of those moulder finger there thei stand perfect
and unalter with arm which never ceas from beckon with a
smile that never grow less sweet come storm come shine noth can
tarnish the pure and gleam robe in which our vision cloth them we
know the worst of them their fault and fail cannot vex us afresh
their error ar all forgiven it is their best part onli that remain
unrealis and unread their purest aspir which we follow with
leaden wing their deepest thought that we still strive to plumb with
the short line of our imagin or experi and to weigh in our
imperfect balanc
ye there thei stand and smile and beckon while ever more radiant
grow their brow and more to be desir the knowledg of their perfect
majesti there is no human passion like thi passion for the dead
none so aw none so holi none so changeless for thei have becom
etern and our desir for them is seal with the stamp of their
etern and strengthen in the shadow of it wing till the shadow
flee awai and we pass to greet them in the dawn of the immort morn
ye within the secret breast of morri the flame of memori still
burn and still seeth those bitter water of desir for the dead
there wa noth carnal about thi desir sinc the passion of the
flesh perish with the flesh nor wa there anyth of what a man mai
feel when he see the woman whom he love and who love him forc to
anoth fate for to those he rob death ha thi advantag over the
case of other success rival hi embrac purifi and of it we ar
not jealou the long wa spiritu and for thi reason it did not
weaken but inde becam a part of him to grow with the spirit from
which it took it birth still had it not been for a chanc occurr
there in the spirit it might have remain buri in due cours to
pass awai with it and seek it express in unknown condit and
region unexplor
in a certain fashion morri wa happi enough he wa veri fond of hi
wife and he ador hi littl children as men of tender natur do ador
those that ar helpless and for whose exist thei ar respons
he appreci hi public reput hi wealth and the luxuri that
lap him round and abov all he wa glad to have been the mean of
restor and inde of advanc the fortun of hi famili
moreov as ha been said abov all thing he desir to pleas mari
the love amiabl woman who had compliment him with her unvari
affect andwhen he went astraywho with scarc a reproach had
led him back into it gentl fold least of all therefor wa it hi
will to flaunt befor her ey the spectr from a past which she wish
to forget or even to let her guess that such a past still permeat
hi present therefor on thi subject settl the silenc of the dead
till at length mari observ as she wa becam wellnigh convinc
that stella fregeliu wa forgotten and that her fantast promis
were disprov yet no mistak could have been more profound
it wa morriss habit whenev he could secur an even to himself
which wa not veri often to walk to the rectori and smoke hi pipe in
the compani of mr fregeliu had mari chanc to be invis present
or to perus a stenograph report of what pass at on of these
even callswhereof for reason which she suppress she did not
entir approvesh might have found suffici caus to vari her
opinion on these occas ostens morri went to talk about parish
affair and inde to a certain extent he did talk about them for
instanc stella who had been so fond of music onc describ to him
the organ which she would like to have in the fine old parish church
of monksland now that renov instrument stood there and wa the
admir of the countrysid as it well might be in view of the fact
that it had cost over four thousand pound
again mr fregeliu wish to erect a monument to hi daughter which
as her bodi never had been found could properli be place in the
chancel of the church morri enter heartili into the idea and
undertook to spend the hundr pound which the old gentleman had save
for thi purpos on hi account and to the best advantag in affect he
did spend it to excel advantag as mr fregeliu admit when the
monument arriv
it wa a love thing execut by on of the first sculptor of the
dai in white marbl upon a black stone bed and repres the mortal
shape of stella there she lai to the veri life wrap in a white
robe portrai as a sleeper awaken from the last sleep of death her
ey wide and wonder and on her face that rapt look which morri had
caught in hi sketch of her sing in the chapel at the edg of the
base of thi remark effigi set flush on the black marbl in letter
of plain copper wa her namestella fregeliuswith the date of her
death on on side appear the text that she had quot o death
where is thy sting and on the other it continu o grave where
is thy victori and at the foot part of a vers from the fortysecond
psalm deep calleth unto deep all thy wave and storm have gone
over me
like the organ thi monument which stood in the chancel wa much
admir by everybodi except mari who found it rather theatric
and inde when nobodi wa look survei it with a gloomi and a
doubt ey
that morri had someth to do with the thing she wa quit certain
sinc she knew well that mr fregeliu would never have invent ani
memori so beauti and full of symbol also she doubt hi
abil to pai for a piec of statuari which must have cost mani
hundr of pound a third reason which seem to her conclus
wa that the face on the statu wa the veri face of morriss draw
although of cours it wa possibl that mr fregeliu might have
borrow the sketch for the us of the sculptor but of all thi
although it disturb her occur as it did just when she hope that
stella wa begin to be forgotten she spoke not a word to morri
least said soonest mend is a good if a home motto or so thought
mari
the monument had been in place a year but whenev he wa at home
morriss visit to mr fregeliu did not grow fewer inde hi wife
notic that if anyth thei increas in number which as the organ
wa now finish down to the last allegor carv of it case
seem remark and unnecessari of cours the fact wa that on these
occas the convers invari centr on on subject and that
subject stella consid in certain aspect it must have been a
piteou thing to see and hear these two men each of them bereav
of on who to them abov all other had been the nearest and dearest
try to assuag their grief by mutual consol morri had never
told mr fregeliu all the depth of hi attach to hi daughter at
least not in actual unmistak word although as ha been said
from the first her father took it for grant and morri tacitli at
ani rate had accept the conclus inde veri soon he found that
no other subject had such charm for hi guest that of stella he might
talk for ever without the least fear that morri would be weari
so the poor childless unfriend old man put asid the reserv and
timid which cloth him like a garment and talk on into those
sympathet ear know well howeverfor the freemasonri of their
common love taught it to himthat in the presenc of a third person
her name no allus to her even must pass hi lip in short these
convers grew at length into a kind of seanc or solemn rite a
joint offer to the dead of the best that thei had to give their
tenderest thought and memori made in solemn secreci and with
uplift heart and mind
mr fregeliu wa an historian and possess some interest record
upon which it wa hi habit to descant amongst other thing he
instruct morri in the annal of stella ancestri upon both side
which as it happen could be trace back for mani gener in
these discours it grew plain to hi listen whenc had sprung certain
of her qualiti such as her fearless attitud toward death and her
tendenc toward mystic here in these musti chronicl far back in
the time when those of whom thei kept record were half if not wholli
heathen these same qualiti could be discov among her forbear
inde there wa on woman of whom the saga told a certain ancestress
name saevuna whereof it is written that she wa of all women the veri
fairest and that she drew the heart of men with her wonder ey as
the moon draw mist from a marsh who in some wai might have been
stella herself stella unchristian and savag
thi saevuna husband rebel against the king of hi countri and
be captur wa doom to a shame death by hang as a traitor
thereon under pretenc of bid him farewel she administ poison
to him partak of the same herself and continu the saga thei
both of them until their pain overcam them di sing a certain
ancient song which had descend in the famili of on of them and is
call the song of the overlord or the offer to death thi song
while strength and voic remain to them it is the duti of thi famili
to sai or sing or so thei hold it in the hour of their death but if
thei sing it except by wai of learn it word and music from their
mother and escap death it will not be for veri long see that
when onc the offer is laid upon hi altar the overlord consid
it hi own and after the fashion of god and men take it as soon as
he can so sweet and strang wa the sing of thi saevuna until she
choke that the king and hi nobl came out to hear it and all men
thought it a great marvel that a woman should sing thu in the veri
pain of death moreov thei declar mani of them that while the
song went on thei could think of noth els and that strang and
wonder vision pass befor their ey but of thi nobodi can know
the truth for certain as the woman and her husband di long ago
you see said mr fregeliu when he had finish translat the
passag aloud it is not wonder that i thought it unlucki when i
heard that you had found stella sing thi same song upon the ship
much as centuri ago her ancestress saevuna sang it while she and her
husband di
at ani rate the omen fulfil itself answer morri with a sigh
and she too di with the song upon her lip though i do not think
that it had anyth to do with these thing which were fate to
befal
well said the clergyman the fate is fulfil now and the song
will never be sung again she wa the last of her race and it wa a law
among them that neither word nor music should ever be written down
when such old tale and legend were exhaust and outsid the
immedi object of their search some of them were of great interest
to a man who like morri had knowledg of nors literatur and wa
delight to discov in mr fregeliu a scholar acquaint with the
origin tongu in which thei were written these companion fell back
upon other matter but all of them had to do with stella on night the
clergyman read some letter written by her as a child from denmark
on anoth he produc certain doll which she had dress at the same
period of her life in the costum of the peasant of that countri on a
third he repeat a piec of rather indiffer poetri compos by her
when she wa a girl of sixteen it strang titl wa the resurrect
of dead rose it told how in it author fanci the flower which
were cut and cast awai on earth bloom again in heaven never to wither
more a pretti allegori but treat in a childish fashion
thu then from time to time as occas offer did thi strang
pair celebr the rite thei thought so harmless and upon the altar of
memori make offer to their dead
chapter xx
stella diari
it seem to be a law of life that noth can stand complet still and
changeless all must vari must progress or retrograd the veri rock
in the bowel of the earth undergo organ alter while the
etern hill that cover them increas or ar worn awai much more is
thi obviou in the case of ephemer man of hi thought hi work
and everyth wherewith he ha to do he who within the period of a few
short year is doom to appear wax wane and vanish
even the convers of mr fregeliu and morri were subject to
the work of thi univers rule and in obedi to it must travel
toward a climax either of fruition howev unexpect or their
purpos serv whatev it mai have been to decai and death for lack
of food upon which to live and flourish the tiniest group of impuls
or incid have their goal as sure and as appoint as that of the
cluster of vast globe which form a constel between them the
princip distinct seem to be on of size and at present we ar not
in a posit to sai which mai be the most import the issu of the
smallest of unrecord caus or of the travel of the great world
the destini of a singl human soul shape or direct by the on for
aught we know mai be of more weight and valu than that of a multitud
of hoari univers nake of life and spirit or perhap to the ey that
see and judg the differ is noth
thu even these semisecret interview when two men met to talk over
the detail of a lost life with which howev profoundli it mai have
influenc them in the past thei appear so far as thi world is
concern to have noth more to do were destin to affect the
futur of on of them in a fashion that could scarc have been
foreseen thi becam appar or put itself in the wai of becom
appar when on a certain even morri found mr fregeliu seat
in the rectori diningroom and by hi side a littl pile of manuscript
volum bound in shabbi cloth
what ar those ask morri her translat of the saga of the cave
outlaw
no morri answer mr fregeliush call him morri when thei
were aloneof cours not dont you rememb that thei were bound in
red he ad reproachfulli and that we did them up to send to the
publish last week
ye ye of cours he wrote to me yesterdai to sai that he would be
glad to bring out the bookmorri did not add at my riskbut
what ar thei
thei ar repli mr fregeliu her journal which she appear to
have kept ever sinc she wa fourteen year of ag you rememb she
wa go to london on the dai that she wa drownedthat christma dai
well befor she went out to the old church she pack her belong
into two box and there those box have lain for three year and
more becaus i could never find the heart to meddl with them but a
few night ago i wasnt abl to sleepi rest veri badli nowso i
went and undid them lift out all the thing which her hand had put
there at the bottom of on of the box i found these volum except
the last of them in which she wa write till the dai of her death
that wa at the top i wa awar that she kept a diari for i have seen
her make the entri but of it content i knew noth in fact
until last night i had forgotten it exist
have you read it now ask morri
i have look into it it seem to be a histori of her thought and
theori fact ar veri briefli note it occur to me that you might
like to read it why not
ye ye veri much answer morri eagerli that is if you think
she will not mind you see it is privat
mr fregeliu took no notic of the tens of which morri made us for
the reason that it seem natur to him that he should emploi it their
strang habit wa to talk of stella not as we speak of on dead but as
a live individu with whom thei chanc for a while to be unabl
to commun
i do not think that she will mind he answer slowli quit the
revers inde it is a record of a phase and period of her exist
which i believ she might wish those who areinterest in herto
studi especi as she had no secret that she could desir to
conceal from first to last i believ her life to have been as clear as
the sky and as pure as run water
veri well answer morri if i come across ani passag that i think
i ought not to read i will skip
i can find noth of the sort or i would not give it to you said
mr fregeliu but of cours i have not read the volum through
as yet there ha been no time for that i have sampl them here and
there that is all
that night morri took those shabbi notebook home with him mari
who accord to her custom went to bed earli be by thi time fast
asleep he retir to hi laboratori in the old chapel where it wa hi
habit to sit especi when as at the present time hi father wa
awai from home here without wast a moment he began hi studi of
them
it wa with veri strang sensat such as he had never befor
experienc that he open the first of the volum written some
thirteen year earlier that is about ten year befor stella death
their actual acquaint had been but brief now he wa about to
complet hi knowledg of her to learn mani thing which he had found
no time or had forgotten to inquir into to discov the explan
of variou phase of her charact hitherto but halfrev perhap
to trace to it sourc the energi of that real but mystic faith with
which it wa inform thi diari that had comeor perhap been sent
to himin so unexpect a fashion wa the kei wherebi he hope to open
the most hidden chamber of the heart of the woman whom he love and
who love him with all her strength and soul
littl wonder then that he trembl upon the threshold of such a
search he wa like the neophyt of some veil religion who after
long year of arduou labour and pain prepar is at length
conduct to the door of it holi of holi and left to enter there
alon what will he find beyond them the secret he long to learn
the seal and confirm of hi hardwon faith or empti baulk
nothing would the goddess herself the unveil isi wait to bless
her votari within those door or would that hall be tenant but by a
paint and bedizen idol a thing fine with ivori and gold but dead
and soulless
might it not be better inde to turn back while there wa yet time
to be content to dwell on in the wide outer court of the imagin
where faith is alwai possibl rather than to hazard all no it would
morri felt be best to learn the whole truth especi as he wa sure
that it could not prove other than satisfi and beauti blind must
he have been inde and utterli without intuit if with everi veil
that wa withdrawn from it the soul of stella did not shine more bright
anoth question remain wa it well that he should read these
diari wa not hi mind alreadi full enough of stella if onc he
began to read might it not be overladen in short mari had dealt well
by him when those book were open in hi hand would he be deal well
by mari answersexcel answersto these queri sprang up in hi
mind by dozen
stella wa dead but you ar sworn to her in death comment the
voic of conscienc would you rob the live of your allegi befor
the time
there wa no possibl harm in read the record of the life and
thought of a friend or even of a love depart yet suggest the
voic of conscienc ar you so sure that thi life is depart have
you not at while felt it presenc that mysteri presenc of the
dead so sweet so heavi and so unmistak with which at some time
or other in their live mani have made acquaint will not the studi
of thi life caus that life to draw near the absorpt of those
thought bring about the visit of other and greater thought whereof
thei mai have been as it were the seed
anyon who knew it author would be interest to read thi human
document the product of an intellig singularli bright and clear
of a vision whose point of outlook wa on of the highest and most
spiritu peak in the rang of our human imagin quit so agre
the voic of conscienc for instanc mari would be delight why not
begin with her in fact why not perus these page togetherit would
lead to some interest argument why pore over them in thi selfish
manner all alon and at the dead of night when no on can possibl
disturb you or sinc you have block the hagioscop even see you
and why doe the door of that safe stand open becaus of the risk of
fire if anyon should chanc to come in with a candl i suppos no
of cours it would not be right to leav such book about especi as
thei do not belong to you
then enrag or at least serious irrit by these impertin
comment of hi inner self upon himself morri bade conscienc to be
gone to it own place next after contempl it for a while as ev
might have contempl the appl unmind of a certain petit in
the lord prayer he took up the volum mark i and began to read
the wellrememb handwrit with it quaint mediaevallook
contract even at the ag when it author had open her diari
he note that thi write wa so tini and neat that mani of the
page might have been taken from a monkish missal also there were few
correct what she set down wa alreadi determin in her mind
from that time forward morri sat up even later than usual nor did
he wast those preciou solitari hour but the diari cover ten full
year of a woman life dure all of which time certainli never a week
pass without her make entri in it some of them of consider
length thu it came aboutfor he skip no wordthat a full month
had gone by befor morri close the last volum and slip it awai
into it hidingplac in the safe
as mr fregeliu had said the histori wa a histori of thought and
theori rather than of fact but notwithstand thi perhap on
account of it inde it wa certainli a work which would have struck
the severest and least interest critic as veri remark the
prevail note wa that of vivid what the writer had felt what
she had imagin what she had desir wa all set out frequent in
but few word with such crystal clear such incis point that it
came home to the reader thought as a flash of sudden light might come
home to hi ey in a preemin degre stella possess the gift of
express even her most abstrus selfcommun and specul were
portrai so sharpli that their mean could not possibl be mistaken
thi it wa that gave the book much of it valu her thought were not
vagu she could defin them in her own conscious and what is more
rare on paper
so much for the form of the journal it matter is not so easi to
describ at first as might be expect from her year it wa somewhat
childish in charact but not on that account the less sweet and
fragrant of a child poor heart here with stern accuraci were record
her littl fault of omiss and commissionhow she had answer
crossli how she had not done her duti vari occasion with short
poem some copi some of her own composit and prayer also of
her make on or two of them veri touch and beauti from time
to time tooinde thi habit clung to her to the lastsh introduc
into her diari descript of sceneri gener short and detach
but set there evid becaus she wish to preserv a sketch in word
of some sight that had move her mind
here is a brief exampl describ a scene in norwai where she wa
visit as it appear to her upon some even in late autumn thi
afternoon i went out to gather cranberri on the edg of the firbelt
below the stead beneath me stretch the great mossswamp so wide that
i could not discern it border and grei as the sea in winter the wind
blew and in the west the sun wa set a big red sun which glow
like the coppercov cathedr dome that we saw last week all about
in the moss stood pool of black stagnant water with littl straggl
bush grow round them under the cloud thei were ink but in the
path of the red light there thei were blood a man with a larg basket
on hi back and a long staff in hi hand wa walk across the moss
from west to east the wind toss hi cloak and bent hi grei beard as
he thread hi wai among the pool the red light fell upon him also
and he look as though he were on fire befor him gather thicker
as the sun sank were shadow and black he seem to walk into the
black like a man wade into the sea it swallow him up he must
have felt veri lone with no on near him in that immens grei place
now he wa all gone except hi head that wore a halo of the red light
he look like a saint struggl across the world into the black gate
for a minut he stood still as though he were frighten then a sudden
gust seem to sweep him on again right into the gate and i lost
sight of that man whom i shall never see ani more i wonder whether
he wa a saint or a sinner and what he will find beyond the gate a
curlew flew past me born out of the dark and it cry made me feel
sad and shiver it might have been the man soul which wish to look
upon the light again then the sun sank and there wa no light onli
the wind moan and far far awai the sad cry of the curlew
thi descript wa simpl and unpolish as it wa short yet it
impress the mind of morri and it curiou allegor note appeal
to hi imagin the grei moss broken by stagnant pool lonesom
and primev the dreari pipe of the wildfowl the red and angri
sun front the gloom of advanc oblivi night the solitari
travel windbuffet wayworn ag heavyladen fulfil the
last stage of hi appoint journei to a realm of sleep and shadow all
these sprang into vision as he read till the landscap concentr
and express itself in it tini central point of human interest grew
more real in memori and mean than mani with which he wa himself
familiar
yet that descript wa written by an untrain girl not yet seventeen
year of ag but with such from first to last and thi wa by no mean
the best of them he found her page stud
then jot down from dai to dai came the account of the ill
and death of her twin sister gudrun a piti tale to read hope
prayer agoni of despair all were here record the last scene also
wa set out with a plain and nobl digniti written by the bed of death
in the presenc of death now under the hand of suffer the child
had becom a woman and as wa fit her full soul found relief in
deeper note goodby gudrun she end my heart is broken but i
will mourn for you no more god ha call you and we give you back
to god wait for me my sister for i am come also and i will not
linger i will walk quickli
it wa from thi sad dai of her onli sister death that the first real
develop of the mystic side of stella charact must be date
the sudden vanish in gudrun in the bloom of youth and beauti brought
home to her the lesson which all must learn in such a fashion that
henceforth her whole soul wa ting to it sad hue
now i understand it all she wrote after return from the funer
we do not live to die we die to live as a grain of sand to the whole
shore as a drop of water to the whole sea so is what we call our life
to the real life of cours on ha alwai been taught that in church
but i never realli comprehend it befor henceforth thi thought shall
be a part of me everi morn when i wake i will rememb that i am on
night nearer to the great dawn everi night when i lie down to sleep i
will thank god that anoth dai of wait ha end with the sunset
ye and i will try to live so that after my last sunset i mai meet the
end as did gudrun without a singl doubt or fear for if i have noth
to reproach myself with why should i be reproach if i have long
for light and live toward the light howev imperfect i mai be why
should i be allot to the dark
almost on the next page appear a prayer for the welfar and greater
glori of her who wa dead and for the mourner who wa left aliv with
thi quaint note append my father would not approv of thi as it
is against the rubric but all the same i mean to go on prai for the
dead why should i not if my poor petit cannot help them who
ar abov the need for help at least thei mai show that thei ar not
forgotten oh that must be the bitter part to live on full of love and
memori and watch forget creep into the heart of the love and
the rememb the priest never thought of it but there li the real
purgatori
the diari show it to be a littl more than a year after thi that
spiritu doubt began to possess the soul of stella after all wa she
not mistaken wa there ani world beyond the physic were we not mere
accid born of the will or the chanc of the flesh and shape
by the pressur of centuri of circumst were not all religion
differ form of a gigant fraud plai by hi own imagin upon
blind believ man and so on to the end of the long list of those
question which ar as old as thought
i look she wrote under the influenc of thi mood but everywher
is black black without a singl star i cry aloud but the onli
answer is the echo of my own voic beat back upon me from the deaf
heaven i prai for faith yet faith fade and leav me i ask for
sign and there is no sign the argument so far as i have read and
heard it seem the other wai and yet i do not believ their proof i
do not believ that so mani gener of good men would have fed
full upon a husk of li and have lain down to sleep at last as though
satisfi with meat my heart rise at the thought i am immort i
know that i am immort i am a spirit in dai to come unchain by
matter time or space i shall stand befor the throne of the father
of all spirit receiv of hi wisdom and fulfil hi command
yet o god help thou my unbelief o god draw and deliv me from thi
abyss
from thi time forward here and there in the diari were to be found
passag or rather sentenc that morri did not understand thei
allud to some secret and persist effort which the writer had been
make and after on of them came these word i have fail again
but she wa near me i am sure that she wa veri near me
then at last came thi entri which as the write show wa written
with a shake hand i have seen her beyond the possibl of a doubt
she appear and wa with me quit a while and oh the raptur it
ha left me weak and faint after all that long long prepar it is
of the cast forth of spirit that it is said thi kind goeth not
out but by prayer and fast but it is also true of the draw of
them down to see a spirit on must grow akin to spirit which is not
good for us who ar still in the flesh i am satisfi i have seen and
i know now i shall call her back no more lest the thing should get
the masteri of me and i becom unfit for my work on earth thi
morn i could scarc hold the bow of the violin and it sweetest
note sound harsh to me i heard discord among their harmoni also
i had no voic to sing and after all the monei and time that have been
spent upon them i must keep up my plai and sing sinc perhap
in the futur if my father health should fail as it often threaten
to do thei mai be our onli mean of livelihood no i shall try no
more i will stop while there is yet time while i am still my own
mistress and have the strength to deni me thi aw joi but i have
seen i have seen and i am thank who shall never doubt again yet
the world and those who tread it can never more be quit the same to
me and that is not wholesom thi is the price which must be paid for
vision of that which we were not meant to touch to tast to handl
after thi for some yearsuntil it wa decid inde that thei
should move to monkslandther wa littl of startl interest in the
diari it record descript of the wild moorland sceneri of bird
and fern and flower also there were sketch of the peasantri and
of the gentlefolk with whom the writer came in contact veri shrewd
and clever some of them but with thi peculiaritythat thei were
absolut free from unkind of thought or word though sometim
their author allow herself the licens of a mitig satir such
thing with note of domest and parish matter and of the progress
made in her arduou and continu studi of vocal and instrument music
made up the sum of these year of the diari then at length at the
begin of the last volum came thi entri

rector of a villag call monksland upon the east coast of england i
will sum up the histori of the thing for some year i have been get
tire of thi place although in a wai i love it too it is so lone
here andi confess my weaknessplai and sing as i do now i
should like occasion to have a better audienc than a few old
halfdeaf clergymen their preoccupi and commonplac wive some
yeomen farmer and a curat or two
it wa last year though i find that i didnt put it down at the time
that at the concert in aid of the rebuild of pankford church i plai
tartini il trillo del diavolo to me on of the weirdest and most
wonder bit of violin music in the world i know that i wa almost
cry when i finish it but next dai i saw in the report in the local
paper written by our music man that miss fregeliu then reliev
the proceed with a comic interlud on the violin which wa much
appreci by the audienc it wa that i confess ity the
idiot remark of our music man which made me determin if it wa
in ani wai possibl that i would shake the dust of thi villag off my
feet then so far as my father is concern the stipend is wretch
and decreas also he ha never realli got on here he is too shy
too reserv perhap in a wai too well read and educ for these
roughandreadi peopl even hi foreign name goe against him the
curat about here call him frigid fregeliu it is the local idea of
a joke
so i persuad him to advertis for an exchang although he said it
wa a mere wast of monei as nobodi in hi sens would look at
thi parish then came the wonder thing after the veri first
advertisementy the veri firstarriv a letter from mr tomlei
rector of monksland where the stipend is 100 pound a year better
than thi sai that he would wish to inquir into the matter he ha
inquir he ha been a pompou old gentleman with a slow voic and
a singl lock of white hair abov hi forehead he sai that it is
satisfactori and that subject to the consent of the bishop etc he
think that he will be glad to effect the exchang afterward i found
him in front of the hous stare at the moorland behind the sea in
front and the church in the middl and look veri wretch i ask
him why he want to do itth word pop out of my mouth i couldnt
help them it wa all so odd
then i found out the reason mr tomlei ha a wife who is or think
she isi am not sure whichan invalid and who i gather speak to
mr tomlei with no uncertain sound mr tomlei wife wa the niec of
a longdepart rector who wa induct in 1815 and reign here for
fortyf year he wa rich a bachelor and rebuilt the church is
it not all written in the flyleaf of the last regist mr tomlei
inherit her uncl land properti in thi neighbourhood and sai
that she is onli well in the air of northumberland so mr tomlei ha to
come up here which he doesnt at all like although i gather that he is
glad to escap from hi present squir who seem to be a distinguish
but arbitrari old gentleman an excolonel of the guard rather
quarrelsom too with a habit of make fun of mr tomlei there the
explan
so just becaus of the silli critic of our music man we ar
go to move sever hundr mile but is that realli the caus ar
these thing done of our own desir or do we do them becaus we must
as our forefath believ beneath our shout and chatter thei have
alwai heard the slow thunder of the wave of fate through the flare of
our straw fire and the dust of our hurri feet thei could alwai see
the shadow of hi black banner and the sheen of hi advanc spear
and for them everi waysid signpost wa paint with hi finger
i think like that too perhap becaus i am all nearli all nors
and we do not shake off the strong and ancient shackl of our blood in
the space of a few gener of christian freedom and enlighten
ye i see the finger of fate upon thi signpost of an advertis in
a church paper hi flag is repres to me by mr tomlei white
and cherish lock assuredli our migrat is decre of the norn
therefor i accept it without question but i should like to know what
kind of a web of destini thei ar weav for us yonder in the place
call monksland
chapter xxi
the end of stella diari
a month or two later in the diari came the account of the shipwreck of
the trondhjem and of the writer rescu from immin death my first
great adventur the page were head thei told how her father with
whom readymonei wa a scarc commod and who had a passion for small
and uncomfort economi suddenli determin to save two or three
pound by take a passag in a norwegian tramp steamboat name the
trondhjem thi vessel laden with a miscellan cargo had put in
at a northumbrian port and carri freight consist of readymad
window doorfram and other wooden housefit suit to the
requir of the builder of seasid villa to be deliv at
the rise wateringplac of northwold upon her wai to london
then follow a descript of the voyag the dirt of the ship the
surpass nasti of the food and the rough of the crew whose
sailorlik qualiti inspir the writer with no confid
next the diari which now had been written up by stella in the abbei
where morri read it went on to tell of how she had gone to her berth
on night in the cabin next to that occupi by her father and be
tire by a long dai in the strong sea air had fallen instantli into a
heavi sleep which wa disturb by a nightmarelik dream of shock
and nois thi imagin pandemonium it said wa follow by a great
quiet in the midst of which she awok to miss the sound of the thump
screw and of the captain shout hi order from the bridg
for a while the write told she lai still till a sens that
someth wa wrong awok her thoroughli when she lit the candl which
she kept by her berth and rise peep out into the saloon to see
that water wa wash along it floor present she made anoth
discoveri that she wa alon utterli alon even her father cabin
be unten
the rest need not be repeat in detail throw on some garment and
a red cloak of northcountri friez she made her wai to the deck to
find that the ship wa abandon by everi live soul includ her
own father why or under what circumst remain a mysteri she
retreat into the captain cabin which wa on deck be afraid
to go below again in the dark and shelter there until the light
came then she went out and though the dim mistladen dawn crept
forward to the forecastl and stare over the side discov that the
prow of the ship wa fix upon a rock while her stern and waist which
float clear heav and roll with everi sea as she stood thu the
vessel slip back along the reef three feet or more throw her to
the deck and thrill her from head to foot with the most sicken
sensat she had ever experienc then the trondhjem caught and hung
again but stella so she wrote knew that the end must be near as the
ship would lift off with the full tide and founder and for the first
time felt afraid
i did not fear what might come after death went on the diari but i
did fear the act of death i wa so lone and the dim water look
so cold the brown shoulder of the rock which show now and again
through the surg so cruel to be dash by those cold water upon
those iron rock till the life wa slowli ground out of my bodi and
my fatherth thought of him torment my mind wa he dead or had
he desert me the last seem quit imposs for it would have
suppos him a coward and i wa sure that he would rather die than
leav me therefor as i fear the first must be true i wa afraid
and i wa wretch and i said my prayer and cri a littl while the
cold struck me through the red cloak and the damp mist made me shiver
then suddenli i rememb that it had not been the custom of my
ancestor and countrywomen of the old time to die weep and with the
thought some of my courag came back i rose from the deck and stood
upon the prow of the ship support myself by a rope as mani a dead
woman of my race ha done befor me in the hour of battl and shipwreck
as i stood thu believ that i wa about to die there float into
my mind a memori of the old nors song that my mother had taught me as
she learn it from her mother it is call the song of the overlord
and for gener without count on their deathb ha been sung
or if thei were too weak to sing whisper by the women of my famili
even my mother murmur it upon the dai she di although to all
appear she had becom an englishwoman and the first line of it
hail to thee sky king hail to thee earth king
were the last word that the gentlest creatur whom i ever knew my
sister gudrun mutter befor she becam unconsci thi song it
ha alwai been held unlucki to sing except upon the actual approach
of death sinc otherwis so goe the old sai it draw the arrow
whose flight wa wide and death be invok come soon still
for me i believ there wa no escap for i wa quit sure from her
movement that the steamer would soon come off the rock and i had
made my confess and said my prayer so i began to sing and sang my
loudest pleas myself with the empti foolish thought that in some
such circumst as thi mani a danish seak daughter had sung
that song befor me
then as i sang a wind began to blow and suddenli the mist wa driven
befor it like puff of smoke and in the east behind me rose the red
ball of the sun it light fell upon the rock and upon the water
beyond them and there to my amaz appear and disappear
upon the ridg and hollow of the swell i saw a man alon in a
sailingboat which rode at anchor within thirti yard of me at first i
thought that it must be my father then the man caught sight of me and
i saw hi face as he look up for the sun shone upon hi dark ey
and knew that he wa a stranger
he lift hi anchor and call to me to come to the companion ladder
and hi voic told me that he wa a gentleman i could not meet him as i
wa with my hair loos and barefoot like some nors vike girl so
i took the risk for now although i cannot tell why i felt sure that
no harm would come to him or me and ran to the cabin where also wa
thi volum of my diari and my mother jewel that i did not wish to
lose when at last i wa readi after a fashion i came out with my bag
and there splash through the water of the saloon ran the stranger
shout angrili to me to be quick as the ship wa lift off the
rock which made me think how brave it wa of him to come aboard to look
for me in an instant he caught me by the hand and wa drag me up
the stair and down the companion so that in anoth minut we
were togeth in the boat and he had told me that my father wa on
shorethank godthough with a broken thigh
then some page of the diari were taken up with the descript of the
twentyfour hour which she had spent on the open sea with himself of
their land daze and exhaust at the dead church and her strang
desir to explor it their arriv at the abbei and her meet with
her father after these came a passag that mai be quot
he is not handsomei call him plainwith hi project brow larg
mouth and untidi brown hair but notwithstand hi stoop and hi
thin hand he look a fine man and when thei light up hi ey ar
beauti it wa brave of him too veri brave although he think
noth of it to come out alon to look for me like that i wonder what
brought him i wonder if anyth told hi mind that i a girl whom he
had never seen wa realli on the ship and in danger perhapsat ani
rate he came and the odd thing is that from the moment i saw him and
especi from the moment i heard hi voic i felt as though i had
known him all my life probabl he would think me mad if i were to
sai so inde i am by no mean sure that he doe not pai me that
compliment alreadi with some excus perhap in view of the song of
the overlord and all my wild talk well after such a night as i had
spent anyon might be excus for talk foolishli it is the reaction
from never expect to talk again at all the chief advantag of a
diari is that on mai indulg in the luxuri of tell the actual truth
so i will sai that i feel as though i had known him alwai alwaysand
as though i understood him as on understand a person on ha watch
for year what is more i think that he understand me more than most
peopl do not that thi is wonder see how few i know at ani
rate he guess more or less what i am think about and can see
that there is someth in the idea which other consid foolish as
perhap thei ar
it is veri odd that i who had made sure that i wa gone should
be still aliv in thi pleasant hous and save from death by thi
pleasant companion to find my father whom i fear wa dead also
live and all thi after i had sung the song of the overlord so
much for it illluck but all the same my father wa rather
upset when he heard that i had been found sing it he is veri
superstiti my dear old father that is on of the few nors
characterist which he ha left in him i told him that there wa no
us in be disturb sinc in the end thing must go as thei ar
fate
mr monk is engag to a miss porson he told me that in the boat i
ask him what he wa think of when we nearli overset against that
dread rock he answer that he could onli think of the song he had
heard me sing on the ship which i consid a great compliment
to my voic quit the nicest i ever had but he ought to have been
think about the ladi to whom he is engag and he understood that
i thought so which i daresai i should not have allow him to do
howev when peopl believ that thei ar go to be drown thei grow
confidenti and expos their mind freeli he expos hi when he told
me that he thought i wa talk egregi nonsens and i am afraid
that i laugh at him i dont think that he realli can love herthat
is as engag peopl ar suppos to love each other if he did he
would not have grown so angrywith himselfand then turn upon me
becaus the recollect of my old death song had interf with the
reflect which he ought to have offer upon her altar that is what
struck me as odd not hi neglect to rememb her in a moment of
danger sinc then we often forget everyth except some trivial
of the hour but of cours thi is all nonsens which i oughtnt to
write here even as most peopl have their own wai of be fond of
each other also it is no affair of mine
i have seen miss porson photograph a larg on of her in court
dress which stand in mr monk laboratori such a love place
it wa an old chapel she is a beauti woman larg and soft and
regallook a veri woman it would be difficult to imagin a better
specimen of the etern feminin also thei sai that is the nurs
who is look after my father sai that she is veri rich and devot
to mr morri so mr morri is a lucki man i wonder why he didnt
save her from a shipwreck instead of me it would have given an
appropri touch of romanc to the affair which is now entir wast
upon a young person if i mai still call myself so with whom it ha no
concern
what interest me more than our host matrimoni engag
howev ar hi experi with aerophon that is a wonder
invent if onli it can be made to work without fail upon all
occas i do wish that i could help him there it would be some
return for hi great kind for it must be a dread nuisanc to
have an old clergyman with a broken leg and hi inconveni daughter
suddenli quarter upon you for an unlimit period of time
the record of the follow week wa veri full but almost entir
concernedbrief mention of other thing such as her father health
exceptedwith full and accur note and descript of the aerophon
experi to morri read them it wa wonder especi as
stella had receiv no train in the scienc of electr that
she could have grasp the subject thu thoroughli in so short a time
evid she must have had a consider aptitud for it theori and
practic as might be seen by the studi that she gave to the literatur
which he lent her includ some manuscript volum of hi own note
also there were other entri thu
todai mr stephen layard propos to me in the dead church i had seen
it come for the last three week and wish to avoid it but he would
not take a hint i am most sorri as i realli think he care about
mefor the whilewhich is veri kind of him but it is out of the
question and i had to sai no inde he repel me i do not even
like be in the same room with him although no doubt thi is veri
fastidi and wrong of me i hope that he will get over it soon in
fact although he seem distress i am not vain enough to suppos
that it will be otherwis
of cours my father is angri for reason which i need not set down
thi i expect but he said some thing which i wish he had left
unsaid for thei made me answer him as i ought not to have done father
and daughter look at marriag from such differ standpoint what is
excel in their ey mai be as bad as death or in some case wors
to the woman who of cours must pai the price
i sang and plai my best last night my veri veri best inde i
dont think i ever did so well befor and perhap never shall again he
wa movedmor move than i meant him to be and i wa move myself
i suppos that it wa the surround that old chapelhow well those
monk understood acoust propertiesth moonlight the upset to my
nerv thi afternoon my fear that he believ that i had accept mr
l imagin hi believ that i thought better of him and he did
believ iteveryth put togeth
while i wa sing he told me that he wa go awayto see miss
porson at beaulieu i suppos when i had finishedoh how tire i wa
after the effort wa overh ask me straight out if i intend to
marri mr layard and i ask him if he wa mad then i put anoth
question i dont know why i never meant to do it but it came up from
my heartwheth he had not said that he wa go awai in answer he
explain that he wa think of so do but had chang hi mind
oh i wa pleas when i heard that i wa never so pleas in my life
befor after all the gift of music is of some us
but why should i have been pleas mr monk come or go ar
noth to me i have no right to interfer with them even indirectli
or to concern myself about them yet i cri when i heard those
word but i suppos it wa the music that made me cry it ha that
inconveni effect sometim well i have no doubt that he will see
plenti of miss porson and it would have been a great piti to break off
the experi just now
on more extract from the veri last entri in the seri of book it wa
written at the rectori on christma ev just befor stella start out
to meet morri at the dead church
hecolonel mask me and i told him the truth straight out i could
not help myself it burst from my lip although the strang thing is
that until he put it into my mind with the question i knew noth
then of a sudden in an instant in a flash i understood and i knew
that my whole be belong to thi man hi son morri what is love
onc i rememb hear a clever cynic argu that between men and women
no such thing exist he call their affect by other name and said
that for true love to be present the influenc of sex must be absent
thi he prove by declar that thi marvel passion of love about
which peopl talk and write is never heard of where it object is old or
deform or even veri ugli although such accid of chanc and time
ar no bar to the true love oflet us sayth child and the parent or
the friend and the friend
well the argument seem difficult to answer although at the time
i knew that it must be wrong but how could i who wa utterli without
experi talk of such a hard matter now i understand that love the
real love between a man and a woman if it be real embrac all the
other sort of love morewheth the kei be physic or spiritu it
unlock a window in our heart through which we see a differ world
from the world that we have known also with thi new vision come
memori and foresight thi man whom i lovethre month ago i had
never seen hi faceand now i feel as though i had known him not onli
all my life but from the begin of timea though we never could be
part ani more
and i talk thu about on who ha never said a tender word to me why
becaus my thought is hi thought and my mind hi mind how am i sure
of that becaus it came upon me at the moment when i learn the truth
about myself he and i ar on therefor i learn the truth about him
also
i wa like ev when she left the tree knowledg wa mine onli i had
eaten of the fruit of life yet the tast of it must be bitter in my
mouth what have i done i have given my spirit into the keep of a
man who is pledg to anoth woman and as i think have taken hi
from her keep to my own what then is thi other woman who is so
good and kind to be rob of all that is left to her in the world am
i to take from her him who is almost her husband never if hi heart
ha come to me i cannot help itfor the rest no so what is left to
me hi spirit and all the futur when the flesh is done with that is
heritag enough how the philosoph who argu about the love of men
and women would laugh and mock if he could see these word suppos
that he could sai stella fregeliu i am in a posit to offer you
a choic will you have thi man for your husband and live out your
natur live upon the strict stipul that your relationship end
absolut and forev with your last breath or will you let him go
to the other woman for their natur live with the prospect of that
heritag which your imagin ha fashion that dim etern of
doubl joi where hand in hand twain and yet on you will fulfil the
secret purpos of your destini
what should i answer then
befor heaven i would answer that i would not sell myself to the devil
of the flesh and of thi present world what barter my birthright of
immort for the mess of pottag of a few brief year of union pai
out my high hope to their last bright coin for thi dinner of mingl
herb drain the well of faith dug with so mani prayer and labour
that it water mai suffic to nourish a rose plant in the sand whose
bloom must die at the first touch of creep earthli frost
the philosoph would sai that i wa mad that the linnet in the hand
is better than all the bird of paradis which ever flew in fabl
tropic sea
i repli that i am content to wait till upon some gloriou morn
my ship break into the silenc of those sea and watch from her
batter bulwark i behold the island of the blest and catch the
scent of heavenli flower and see the jewel bird whereof i dream
float from palm to palm
but if there ar no such isl he would answer if with their
magic bird and flower thei ar inde but the baseless fabric of a
dream if your ship amidst the rave of the storm and the dark of
the tortur night should founder onc and for ever in the dark strait
which lead to the gatewai of that dawnthos gatewai through which
no travel return to lai hi fellow cours for the harbour of your
perfect sea what then
then i would sai let me forswear god who ha suffer me to be
deceiv with fals spirit and sink to depth where no light break
where no memori stir where no hope torment ye then let me deni
him and die who am of all women the most miser but it is not
so for to me a messeng ha come at my prayer onc the gate were
open and now i know quit sure that it wa permit to me to see
within them that i might find strength in thi the bitter hour of my
trial
yet how can i choke the truth and tread down the human heart within me
oh the road which my nake feet must tread is full of thorn and heavi
the cross that i must bear i go now in a few minut time to bid
him farewel if i can help it i shall never see him again no not
even after mani year sinc it is better not also perhap thi is
weak but i should wish him to rememb me wear such beauti as
i have and still young befor time and grief and labour have mark
me with their ugli scar it is the stella whom he found sing at the
daybreak on the ship which brought her to him for whom i desir that he
should seek in the hour of a differ dawn
i go present to my marriag as it were a cold and piti feast
mani would think itthes nuptial of lifelong renunci the
philosoph would sai why renounc you have some advantag some
power us them the man love you plai upon hi natur weak
help yourself to the thing that chanc to be desir in your ey
three year henc who will blame you who will even rememb hi
father well he like you alreadi and in time a man of the world
accept accomplish fact especi if thing go well as thei will
do for that invent must succe no on els ye three other he
would rememb howev much he love me for i should have brought him
to do a shame act and she would rememb whom i had rob of her
husband come into hi life after he had promis himself to her last
of allmost of all perhapsi myself should rememb dai by dai and
hour by hour that i wa noth more than on of the famili of thiev
no i will have none of such philosophi at least i stella fregeliu
will live and die among the upright so i go to my cold marriag such
as it is so i bend my back to the burden so i bow my head to the
storm and throughout it all i thank god for what he ha been pleas to
send me i mai seem poor but how rich i am who have been dower with a
love that i know to be etern as my etern soul i go and my husband
shall receiv me not with a lover kiss and tender but with word
few and sad with greet that almost befor their echo die must
fade into farewel i wrap no veil about my head he will set no ring
upon my hand perchanc we shall plight no troth so be it our hour of
harvest is not yet
yesterdai wa veri sharp and bleak with scud of sleet and snow driven
by the wind but as i drove here with my father i saw a man and a woman
in the midst of an empti lifeless field plant some winter seed
who look at them who that did not know could foretel the fruit
of their miser unhop labour yet the summer will come and the
sweet smell of the flower bean and the song of the nest bird
and the plenti reward of the year crown with fat it is a
symbol of thi marriag of mine todai we sow the seed next after a
space of rave rain and wind will follow the long white winter
of death then some dim sweet spring of awaken and beyond it the
ful of all joi
what is there about me that it would make me asham that he should
know thi husband to whom i must tell noth i cannot think no other
man ha been anyth to me i can rememb no great sin i have work
make the best of such gift as i possess i have tri to do my duti
and i will do it to the end sure my heart is whole and my hand ar
clean perhap it is a sin that i should have learn to love him that
i should look to a far futur where i mai be with him if so am i to
blame who ask noth here can i conquer destini who am it child can
i read or shape the purpos of my maker
and so i go o god i prai thee of thy merci give me strength to bear
my temptat and my trial and to him also give everi strength and
bless o father i prai thee of thy merci shorten these the dai
of my tribul upon earth accept and sanctifi thi my sacrific of
denial grant me pardon here and hereaft through all the abyss of
time in thy knowledg and presenc that perfect peac which i desir
with him to whom i am appoint amen
chapter xxii
the evil gate
such wa the end of the diari of stella
morri shut the book with someth like a sob then he rose and
began to tramp up and down the length of the long lone room while
thought crowd confus and overwhelm press in upon hi mind
what a woman wa thi whom he had lost who had known anoth so pure
so spiritu sure she did not belong to thi world and therefor
her last prayer wa so quickli answer therefor heaven took her
mani read those final page might have said with the philosoph she
imagin that the shock of love and the sorrow of separ had turn
her brain and that she wa mad for who so such might argu would
think that person otherwis than mad who dare to translat into action
and on earth to set up as a rule star that faith which dai by dai
their lip profess
yet it would seem after that thi dreamer and mystic stella believ
in noth which our religion accept by million without cavil doe
not promis to it votari it revel and reward mark the
extremest limit of her fantasi immort of the person soul it
foundat stone wa the rock on which she built a heaven where there
is no earthli marriag but where each mai consort with the soul most
love and most desir where all sorrow ar forgotten all tear
ar wipe awai all purpos made clear reserv for those who deni
themselv do their duti and seek forgiv of their sinsthi
heaven conceiv by stella is it not vow to us in the page of the
gospel is it not vow again and again sometim with more detail
sometim with less sometim in open simpl word sometim wrap
in the mystic allegori of the vision of st john but everywher and
continu held befor us as our crown and great reward and the rest
such thing as her belief in guardian angel and that it had been given
to her mortal ey to behold and commun with a belov ghost is there
not ampl warrant for them in those inspir write were not the dead
seen of mani in jerusalem on the night of fear and ar we not told of
minist spirit sent forth to do servic for the sake of them
that shall inherit salvat and of the guardian angel who look
continu upon the father
now it all grew clear to morri in stella he beheld an exampl of
the doctrin of christian realli inspir the daili life of the
believ if her strong faith anim all those who serv under that
banner then in like circumst thei would act as she had act
thei would have no doubt their fear would vanish their grief be
comfort and to a great extent even the prompt and passion of
their mortal would be trodden under foot with stella thei would be
readi to neglect the temporari in their certainti of the etern and
even to welcom death to them in truth and not in mere convent the
gate of life
mani thing ar promis to those who can achiev faith stella achiev
it and becam endu with some portion of the promis spiritu faith
not inherit nor accept but hardwon by person struggl and
experi that wa the keynot to her charact and the explan
of her action yet that faith when examin into wa noth exot
no combin of mystic and mummeri but on found upon the daili
creed of the english and it fellow church and understood and appli
to the circumst of a life which wa as brief as it seem to be
unfortun thi wa morriss discoveri open and obviou enough and
yet at first until he grew accustom to it a thing marvel in
hi ey on moreov in which he found comfort sinc sure that
straight but simpl path wa such as hi feet might follow
and she love him oh how she had love him there could be no doubt
there were her word written in that book not hastili spoken beneath
the pressur of some sudden wind of feel but set down in black and
white thought over reason out and record and then their purport
thei were a paean of passion but the dirg of it denial thei dwelt
upon the natur hope of woman onli to put them by
yet how can i choke the truth and tread down the human heart within me
oh the road that my nake feet must tread is full of thorn and heavi
the cross that i must bear so i go to my marriag such as it
is so i bend my back to the burden so i bow my head to the storm and
through it all i thank god for what he ha been pleas to send me i
mai seem poor but how rich i am who have been dower with a love that
i know to be etern as my etern soul
that wa her creed those were the teach of her philosophi and thi
wa the woman who had love him who di love him her veri word
came back spoken but a few second befor the endrememb everi
word which i have said to you rememb that we ar wedtruli wed that
i go to wait for you and that even if you do not see me i will if i
mai be near you alwai
i go to wait for you i will be near you alwai here wa anoth
inspir for three year or more he had been think of her as
dead or rather he had thought of her in that nebul undefin
fashion in which we consid the dead the slumber peopl who forget
everyth who see noth who if thei exist at all ar like stone
upon the beach roll to and fro blind and senseless not of their own
desir but by the wave of a fear fate that itself is driven on
with the strength of a secret storm of will and thi fate some call the
breath of god and some the work of a soulless forc that compel the
univers past present and to be
but wa thi view as real as it is common if stella were right if our
religion were right it must be most wrong that religion told us that
the master of mankind descend into hade to preach to the soul of
men did he preach to dumb oceandriven stone to frozen form and
fossil who had onc been men or to spirit chang but activ and
exist
stella too had walk in the vallei of doubt by the path which all
who think must tread it wa written larg in the book of her life but
she had not faint there she had live through it thunderrain
it arid blast of wither dust it quiver quicksand and it
miragelik meadow gai with deceit poison flower at last she
had reach the mountain slope of truth to travel up them higherev
higher till she won their topmost peak where the sun shone undim
and the pure air blew whenc the world seem far awai and heaven veri
near ye and from that heaven she had call down the spirit of her
lost sister and thenceforward wa content and sure
she had call down the spirit of her sister wa it not written in the
page which she thought that no ey but her would see
well if such spirit were hersstellasmust be also and if thei
could be made appar why should not her share their qualiti
morri paus in hi swift walk and trembl i will be near you
alwai for aught he knew she wa near him nowpres perhap in
thi veri room while she wa still in life what were her aspir
thi wa on of them he rememb as it fell from her lip still to
be with those whom i have love on earth although thei cannot see
me to sooth their sorrow to support their weak to lull their
fear and if thi were so if ani power were given her to fulfil her
will whom would she sooner visit than himself
stai that wa her wish on earth while she wa a woman but would she
still wish it afterward the spirit wa not the flesh the spirit could
see and be sure while the flesh must be content with deduct and
hazard if she could see she would know him as he wa everi
fail everi secret infirm everi infidel of heart might be
an open write to her ey and then would she not close that book in
horror
a great writer ha said in effect that no man would dare to affront the
ear of hi fellowsmen much wors than himself perhapswith the true
detail of hi hidden histori know all the truth thei would shrink
from him how much more then at such sight and sound would a pure
spirit wash clean of everi taint of earth fly from hi soil
presenc wail and aghast nai men ar hypocrit who in greater
or less degre themselv practic the veri sin that shock them but
spirit know all would forgiv all thei ar abov hypocrisi if
the lord of spirit can weigh the dust whereof we ar made and still
be merci shall hi bright messeng trampl it in scorn and
hate will thei not also consid the long of the heart and it
upright and be piti toward the fail of the flesh would
stella hate him becaus he remain as he wa madea herself she might
onc have been becaus have no wing with which to rule the air he
must still tramp onward through the foetid cling mud of earth
oh how he long to see her that he might win her faith win it beyond
all doubt by the evid of hi earthli ey and sens if i die
search and you shall see she had onc said to him and then ad
no do not search but wait wait how could he wait at your death
i will be with you why he might live anoth fifti year that book of
her record thought had arous in him such a desir for the sight or
at least the actual knowledg of her continu be that hi blood wa
aflam as with a mad and yet how should he search
stella he whisper come to me stella but no stella came no
wing rustl no breath stir the empti room wa as the room had
been it silenc seem to mock him those who slept beneath it marbl
floor were not more silent
wa he mad that he should claim the power to work thi miracleto charm
the dead back through the gate of death as orpheu charm eurydic
yet stella did thi thingbut how he turn to the volum and page
of her diari which dealt with the draw down of gudrun ye here
she spoke of continu effort and of that long long preparationof
prayer and fast also here too wa the whole secret sum up in a
dozen word to see a spirit on must grow akin to spirit well it
could be done and he would do it but look further on where she said
i shall call her back no more lest the thing should get the masteri of
me and i becom unfit for my work on earth i will stop while
there is yet time while i am still mistress of my mind and have the
strength to deni myself thi aw joi
wa there not a warn in these word and in those other word no
do not search but wait sure thei told of risk to him who be yet
on earth dare to lift a corner of the veil which separ flesh and
spirit should get the masteri of me if he saw her onc would he be
abl to do as stella did and by an effort of hi will separ himself
from a communion so fear yet so sweet unfit for my work
suppos that it did get the masteri of him would he not also be
unfit for hi work on earth
hi work what work had he now it seem to be done for attend
scientif meet receiv dividend plai the countri squir
onli son and the wealthi host whilst await the titl which mari
wish forthes thing ar not work and somehow hi dai were so
arrang that he wa never allow to go beyond them all further
research and experi were discourag what did it matter if
he were unfit for that which he could no longer do hi work wa
finish there it stood befor him in that box stamp monk
aerophon the twin no 3412
no he had but on ambit left to pierc the curtain of thick night
and behold her who wa lost to him her who love him as man had been
seldom love
the fierc temptat struck him as a sudden squall strike a ship with
all her canva spread for a moment mast and rig stood the strain
then thei went by the board he would do it if it kill him but the
task must be undertaken properli deliber and abov all in secret
tomorrow he would begin when he had satisfi himself when he had
seen then he could alwai stop
a few minut later morri stood besid hi wife bed there she
lai in the first perfect of young motherhood and beauti a love
whitewrap vision with strai golden hair her sweet round face
pink with the flush of sleep and the long lash ly like littl
shadow on her cheek
morri look at her and hi doubt return what would stella sai
he thought to himself it almost seem to him that he could hear her
voic bid him forbear bid him render unto hi wife those
thing which were hi wife all honour loyalti and devot if he
enter on thi cours could he still render them wa there not such
a thing as moral infidel and did not such exercis as he propos
partak of it natur perhap perhap on the whole it might be well
to put all thi behind him
it wa three oclock he wa tire out and must sleep the morn
would be a more fit time to ponder such weighti question of the
unwritten matrimoni law
in due cours the morn cameinde it wa not far offand with
it wiser counsel mari woke earli and talk about the babi which wa
teeth inde so soon as the nurs wa up she sent for it that the
three of them might hold a consult over a swollen gum also she
discuss the date of their departur to beaulieu for again christma
wa near at hand ad howev somewhat to morriss relief that
unless the babi teeth went on better she realli did not think that
thei could go as it would be most unwis to take her out of the care
of dr charter and trust her to the tender merci of foreign leech
morri agre that it might be riski and mention that in a letter
which he had receiv from the concierg at beaulieu a few dai befor
that functionari said that the place wa overrun with measl and
scarlatina
morri ejacul mari sit bolt upright in bed and you never
told me what is more had it not been for babi teeth which brought
it to your mind i believ you never would have told me and i might
have taken those unprotect littl angel andoh good i cant
bear to think of it
morri mutter some apolog whereon mari look at him
suspici through her fall hair ask
why did you forget to show me the letter did you suppress it becaus
you want to go to beaulieu
no answer morri with energi i hate beaulieu i forgot that is
all becaus i have so much to think about i suppos
so much i thought that thing were arrang now so that you had
noth at all to think about except how to spend your monei and be
happi with me and ador the dear angelsy i think that perhap the
nurs had better take her awai touch the bell will you there she
gone keep her well wrap up and mind the draught nurs
no dont get up yet morri i want to talk to you you have been veri
gloomi of late just like you us to be befor you marri moon
about and stare at noth and what on earth do you do sit up to
all hour of the morn in that ghosti old chapel where i wouldnt be
alon at twelv oclock for a hundr pound
i read said morri
read read what novel
sometim answer morri
oh how can you tell such fib why that last book by ladi
whatshernam which came in the mudi boxth on thei sai is so
improperha been ly on your tabl for over two month and you
cant tell me yet what it wa the heroin did wrong morri you ar not
invent anyth more ar you
here wa an inspir i admit that i am think of a littl thing
he said with diffid as though he were a bud poet with a sonnet
on hi mind
a littl thing what littl thing
well a new kind of aerophon design to work uninfluenc by it
twin
well and why shouldnt it everyth cant have a twinonli i
suppos there would be noth to hear
that just the point repli morri in hi old profession manner
i think there would be plenti to hear if onli i could make the machin
sensit to the sound and capabl of reproduc them
what sound ask mari
well if for instanc on could successfulli insul it from the
earth nois the sound which permeat space and even those that have
their origin upon the surfac of the planet and perhap of the more
distant star
great heaven exclaim mari imagin a man who can want to let
loos upon our poor littl world everi horribl nois that happen in
the star why what under heaven would be the us of it
well on might commun with them conceiv even on might hear
the speech of their inhabit if thei have ani alwai presum
that such an instrument could be made and that it can be successfulli
insul
hear the speech of their inhabit that is your old idea but you
will never succe that on bless morri i suspect you you want
to stop at home here to work at thi horribl new machin to work for
year and year and year without the slightest result i suppos that
you didnt invent that about the measl and the scarlatina did you
the two of them togeth sound rather clumsi as though you might have
done so
not a bit upon my honour answer morri i will go and get the
letter and not sorri to escap from further examin he went
whether the caus were mari doubt and reproach or the infant
gum or the work of hi own conscienceh felt that a man with
a teeth babi ha no right to cultiv the occult for quit a long
period a whole fortnight inde morri steadili refrain from ani
attempt to fulfil hi danger ambit to pierc the curtain of
thick night onli he read and reread stella diarythat secret
fascin work which in effect wa build a wall between him and the
healthi common instinct of the worldtil he knew whole page of it
by heart also he began a seri of experi whereof the object wa
to produc an improv and more sensit aerophon
that ani instrument which the intellect of man could produc would
realli succe in convei sound which if thei exist at all ar born
in the vast cosmic area that envelop our earth and it atmospher he
believ to be most improb still such a thing wa possibl for
what is not moreov the world itself as it rush on it fear
journei across the depth of space ha doubtless mani voic that have
not yet been heard by the ear of men some of which he might be abl to
discov and record at the least he stood upon the threshold of a new
knowledg and now a great desir aros in him to pass it door if so
he might for who could tell what he would learn or see behind them and
by degre as he work alwai with on ulterior object in hi mind
hi scrupl vanish or were master by the growth of hi long
till thi becam hi rule passionto behold the spirit of stella
now he no longer reason with himself but openli nakedli in hi
own heart gave hi will over to the achiev of thi monstrou and
unnatur end
how wa it to be done that wa now the sole dilemma which torment
hima the possibl method of obtain the drink he crave or the
drug that give him peac and radiant vision torment the dipsomaniac
or the morphia victim in hi guard prison he thought of hi
instrument those magic machin with the work of which stella had
been familiar in her life he even pour petit into them in the
hope that these might be deliv far beyond the ken of man onli to
learn that he wa travel a road which led to a wall impass the
wall that for the lack of a better name we call death which bar the
natur from the spiritu
wonder as were hi electr applianc innumer as might be
their impalp eman insolubl as seem the mysteri of their
power of catch and transmit sound by the agenc of ether thei
were still physic applianc produc physic effect in obedi
to the law of natur but what he sought lai beyond natur and wa
subject to some rule of which he did not even know the element and
much less the axiom herein hi instrument or inde ani that man
could make were as futil and as useless as would be the prayer of an
archbishop address to a mumbojumbo in a fetish hous the link wa
want there wa and could be no commun between the two
the invis ether which he had subdu to hi purpos wa still a
constitu part of the world of matter he must discov the spiritu
ether and discov also the anim forc by which it might be
influenc
now he form a new planto reach the dead by hi petit by the
invoc of hi own spirit seek me and you shall find me she had
said so he sought and call in bitter and concentr of heart
but still he did not find stella did not come
he wa in despair she had promis and her promis seem to be
broken then it wa that in turn the page of her diari he came
across a passag that had escap him or which he had forgotten it ran
thu
in the result i have learn thi that we cannot compel the depart
to appear even if thei hear us thei will not or ar not suffer to
obei if we would behold them we must creat the power of vision in our
own natur thei ar about us alwai onli we cannot see or feel their
presenc our sens ar too gross to succe we must refin our sens
until thei acquir an aptitud beyond the natur then without ani will
or ani intervent on their part we mai triumph perhap even when
thei do not know that we have triumph
chapter xxiii
stella come
now by such art as ar known to those who have studi mystic in
ani of it protean form morri set himself to attempt commun
with the unseen in their practic these art ar as superl
unwholesom as in their result success or not thei ar unnatur
also thei ar veri ancient the chaldean knew them and the magician
who stood befor pharaoh knew them to the earli christian anchorit

classic interpret of oracl indian fakir savag witchdoctor
and medicin men all submit or submit themselv to the yoke of the

thi is the rule to beat down the flesh and it instinct and nurtur
the spirit it aspir and power and thi is the endto escap
befor the time if onli partial and at interv into an atmospher
of vision true or fals where human feet were meant to find no road
and the trammel mind of men no point of outlook that such an
atmospher exist even materialist would hesit to deni for it is
prove by the whole histori of the moral world and especi by that
of the religion of the world their founder their prophet and their
expon mani of whom have breath it ether and pronounc it the
veri breath of life their feet have walk the difficult path stand
on those forbidden peak thei have scan the dim plain and vallei
of the unseen and made report of the dream and shape that haunt them
then the busi hord of men beneath for a moment paus to listen and ar
satisfi
lo here is truth thei cry now we mai ceas from troubl so for
a while thei rest till other answer nai thi is truth our teacher
told it us from yonder mountain the onli holi hill and yet other
fall upon them and slai them shout neither of these is truth she
dwell not among the precipic but in the vallei there we have heard
her accent
and still from cliff to cliff and along the secret vale echo the
voic of truth and still upon the snowwreath peak and across the
space of roll ocean and even among the popul street of men
veil mysteri and chang her shape is seen by those who have
train themselv or been inspir to watch and hear but no two see
the same shape and no two hear the same voic sinc to each she wear
a differ counten and speak with anoth tongu for truth is
as the sand of the shore for number and as the infinit hue of the
rainbow for varieti yet the sand is ground out of on mother rock and
all the colour of earth and air ar born of a singl sun
so practis the ancient rite and mysteri and bow himself to
the ancient law whose primev principl everi man and woman mai find
graven upon the tablet of their solitari heart morri set himself to
find that truth which for him wa hid in the invis soul of stella
the soul which he desir to behold and handl even if the touch and
sight should slai him
dai by dai he work for as mani hour as he could make hi own at the
detail of hi new experi these in themselv were interest
and promis even to be fruit but that wa not hi object or
at ani rate hi princip object in pursu them with such an eager
passion of research the talk and hazard which had pass between
himself and stella notwithstand both reason and experi had
taught him alreadi that all instrument made by the hand of man were
useless to break a wai into the dwell of the depart a dai might
come when thei would enabl the inhabit of the earth to convers
with the live denizen of the most distant star but never never
with the dead he labour becaus of the frame of thought hi toil
brought with it but still more that he might be alon that he might be
abl to point to hi soil hand the shabbi cloth which he wore when
work with chemic or at the forg the sheet of paper cover with
halffinish and madden calcul as an excus why he should not
be taken out or wors still drag from hi home to stai for night
or perhap whole week in other place even hi wife he felt would
relent at the sight of those figur and would fly from the odour of
chemic
in fact mari did both for she hate what she call smell and
a place strewn with hot iron and bottl of acid which as she
discov if disturb burnt both dress and finger the sight also
of algebra charact pursu each other across quir of paper like
the grotesqu forc of some broken impish armi fill her indol
mind with a wonder admir that wa akin to fear the man she
reflect who could forc those cabalist symbol to reveal anyth
worth know must inde be a geniu and on who deserv not to be
disturb even for a tea parti
although she disapprov deepli of these renew studi such wa
mari secret thought whether it would have suffic alon to persuad
her to permit them is anoth matter sinc her instinct keen and
subtl as ani of morriss applianc warn her that in them lai danger
to her home and happi but just then as it happen there were
other matter to occupi her mind the babi becam serious ill over it
teeth and other infantil complic follow for some week
it wa doubt whether she would surviv
now mari belong to the class of woman which is gener known as
motherli and ador her offspr almost to excess consequ for
those week she found plenti to think about without troubl herself
overmuch as to morri and hi experi for these same reason
perhap she scarc notic seat as she wa some distanc awai
at the further end of the long tabl how veri ether her husband
appetit had becom or that although he took wine as usual it wa
a mere pretenc sinc he never empti hi glass the most love of
women can scarc be expect to consid a man appetit when that of
a babi is in question or while the child wast to take note whether
or no it father is lose flesh lastli as regard the hour at which
he came to bed be herself a sound sleeper mari had long sinc ceas
to interest herself about them on the wise principl that so long as
she wa not expect to sit up it wa no affair of her
thu it happen that morri work and medit by dai and by
nightah who that ha not tri to climb thi difficult and endless
jacob ladder rest upon the earth and lose itself far far awai in
the blue of heaven abov can understand what he did by night but those
who have stood even on it lowest rung will guess andfor the rest it
doe not matter
he advanc he knew that he advanc that the gross wall of sens wa
wear thin beneath the attack of hi outthrown soul that even if
thei were not drawn from time to time the black curtain swung asid in
the swift pure breath of hi continu prayer moreov the dead drew
near to him at moment or he drew near the dead even in hi earthli
brain he could feel their aw presenc as wave by wave soft sweet
puls of impress beat upon him and pass through him through and
through him thei pass till hi brow ach and everi nerv of hi bodi
tingl as though it had becom the receiv of some mysteri current
that stir hi blood with what wa not akin to it and summon to hi
mind strang memori and foresight vision came also that he could
not defin to slip from hi frantic grasp like wet sand through the
finger of a drown man more and more frequent and with an ever
increas complet did thi unearthli air blow from a shore no
human foot ha trod breath through hi be and possess him much
as some faint wind which we cannot feel mai be seen to possess an aspen
tree so that it turn white and shiver when everi other natur thing
is still and as that aspen turn white and shiver in thi thin
impalp air so did hi spirit blanch and quiver with joi and dread
mingl mysteri in the cup of hi expect soul
again and again those sweet yet sicken wave flow over him to
leav him shaken and unnerv at first thei were rare visitor singl
cloud float across hi calm come he knew not whenc and vanish
he knew not whither now thei drove in upon him like some scud ampl
yet broken befor the wind till at while as it were he could not
see the face of the friendli human sun then he wa like a travel
lost in the mist upon a mountain top sure of noth feel
precipic about him hear voic call him see white arm
stretch out to lead him yet run forward gladli becaus amid so
mani peril a fate wa in hi feet
now too thei came with an actual sens of wind he would wake up
at night even by hi wife side and feel thi unholi breath blow
icecold on hi brow and upon the back of hi outstretch hand yet
if he lit a candl it had no power to stir it flame ye while it
still blew sharp upon him the flame of the candl did not move then
the wind would ceas and within him the intang imponder power
would aris and the voic would speak like the far far murmur of
a stream and the thought which he could not weigh or interpret would
soak into hi be like some strang dew and soft soft as fall
snow invis feet would tread the air about him till of a sudden a
door in hi brain seem to shut and he woke to the world again
everi forc is subject to law even if thei were but the eman of
an incipi mad which like all els have their origin destini
and form these possess vapour were a forc which in time morri
whose mind from a lifelong train wa scientif and method
accustom moreov to struggl for dominion over element unknown or
imperfectli appreci learn to regul if not entir to control
their visit were pleasant to him a delight even but to experi
thi joi to the utmost he discov that their power must be
concentr that if the full effect wa to be produc thi moral
morphia must be taken in strong dose and at state interv
suffici space be allow between them to give hi mental be
time to recuper scienc ha prove that even the molecul of a wire
can grow fatigu by the constant passag of electr or the edg of
a razor by too frequent strop both of them to be effect to do
their utmost servic must have period of rest
here then hi will came to hi aid for he found that by it strong
concentr exert he wa enabl both to shut off the sensat or
to excit them anoth thing he found alsothat after a while it wa
imposs to do without them for a period the anticip of their
next visit would buoi him up but if it were baulk too long then
reaction set in and with it the horror of the pit
thi wa the first stage of hi insanityor of hi vision
dear as such manifest might be to him in time he weari of them
these hint which but awaken hi imagin these fantast spice
meat which without stai it onli sharpen hi spiritu appetit
more than ever he long to see and to know to make acquaint with
the actual presenc whereof thei were but the forerunn the cold
blast that go befor the storm the vagu mystic draperi which
veil the unearthli goddess at whose shrine he wa a worshipp he
desir the full fierc furi of the tempest the blind flash of the
lightn the heavi hiss of the rain the rush of the wind burst on
him from the four horizon he desir the nake face of hi goddess
and she cameor he acquir the power to see her whichev it might
be she came suddenli unexpectedli complet as a goddess should
it wa on christma ev at night the anniversari of stella death
four year befor morri and hi wife were alon at the abbei as the
colonel had gone for a fortnight or so to beaulieu just to keep the
hous air as he explain also ladi rawlin wa there with her
husband the eviltemp man who by a singl stroke of sick had
been convert into a babbl imbecil harmless as a babe and amus
for the most part with such toi as ar given to babe she so morri
understood had intim that sir jonah wa fail realli fail
quickli and that in her friendless at a foreign place especi
at christma time she would be thank to have the comfort of an old
friend presenc thi the old friend who have been back from town
for a whole month wa get rather bore with monksland and the
sick babi determin to vouchsaf explain that he knew that young
marri peopl like to be left to each other now and again especi
when thei were worri with domest troubl ladi rawlin wa foolish
and fat but as the colonel rememb she wa fond where inde
could anoth woman be found who would endur so much scientif
disciplin and yet be thank also within a few week after the
expect demis of jonah she would be wondrou wealthythat he knew
therefor it seem that the matter wa worth considerationand a
journei to beaulieu
so the colonel went and morri more and more possess by hi
monomania wa glad that he had gone hi absenc gave him greater
opportun of loneli it wa now no longer necessari that he
should sit at night smoke with hi father or rather watch him
smoke at the expens of so mani preciou hour when he should be up and
do
morri and mari dine teteatet that even but almost immedi
after dinner she had gone to the nurseri the babi wa now threaten
with convuls and a train nurs had been instal but as mari
did not in the least trust the nurs who accord to her account
wa quit unaccustom to children she insist upon dog that
functionari footstep therefor morri saw littl of her
it wa on oclock on christma morn or more hour ago morri had
gone though hi rite the ritual that he had invent or discoveredin
it essenc simpl and pathet enoughwherebi he strove to bring
himself to the notic of the dead and to fit himself to see or hear the
dead such tent mystic as serv hi turn need not be written
down but it substanc can be imagin by mani then through an
exercis of hi will he had invok the strang trancelik state
which ha been describ the soft wave flow from an unknown sourc
had beat upon hi brain and with them came the accustom phenomena
the sens of some presenc near impend yet impot suggest
by analog and effect the misdirect effort of a blind person seek
someth in a room or the pain attempt of on almost deaf strive
to sift out word from a confus murmur of sound the person
of stella seem to pervad him yet he could see noth could hear
noth the impress might be from within not from without perhap
after all it wa noth but a dream a miasma a mirag drawn by hi
own burn thought from the wast and marsh of hi mind peopl
with illus hope and waterlog by memori or it might be true and
real as yet he could not be certain of it origin
the fit pass delight in it overpow empti but
unsatisfi as all that had gone befor it and left him weak for a
while morri crouch by the fire for he had grown cold and could
not think accur then hi vital human strength return and as
seem to him to be fit upon thi night of all night he began on
by on to recal the event of that dai four year ago when stella wa
still a live woman
the scene in the dead church the agoni of farewel he summon
them detail by detail word by word her look the chang of her
express the movement of her hand and ey and lip he count and
pictur each preciou souvenir the sound of her last sentenc also
as the blind senseless aerophon had render them just befor the
end on by on thei were repeat in hi brain there stood the veri
instrument but ala it wa silent now it twin lai buri in the sea
with her who had work it
morri grew weari the effort of memori wa exhaust and after it he
wa glad to think of noth the fire flicker the clear light of
the electr lamp shone upon the hard sixteenthcenturi face of
the paint angel in the ancient roof without the wind sough and
through it rose the constant sullen roar of the sea
tire disappoint unhappi and full of selfreproach for when the
mad wa not on him he knew hi sin morri sank into a doze now
music crept softli into hi sleep sweet thrill music caus him
to open hi ey and smile it wa christma ev and doubtless he heard
the villag waif
morri look up arous himself to listen and lo there befor him
unexpect and ineff wa stella stella as she appear that night
on which she had sung to him just as she finish sing inde when
he stood for a while in the faint moonlight the flame of inspir
still flicker in those dark ey and the sweet lip drawn down a
littl as though she were about to weep
the sight did not astonish him at the moment he never imagin even
then that thi could be her spirit that hi long labour in a soil no
man wa meant to till had issu into harvest sure it wa a dream
noth but a dream he felt no tremor no cold wind stir hi hair
hi heart did not stand still nor hi breath come short why should a
man fear so beauti a dream yet vagu enough he wish that it
might last forev for it wa sweet to see her soa she had been
as she had beenyet wa she ever thu sure some wand of chang had
touch her she wa beauti but had she worn that beauti and those
ey could ani such have shone in the face of woman
stella he whisper and from roof and wall crept back the echo of
hi voic he rose and went toward her she had vanish he return
and there she wa
speak he mutter speak but no word came onli the love
changeless ey shone on and watch him
listen music seem to float about the room such music as he had never
heardeven stella could not make the like the air wa full of it the
night without wa full of it million of voic took up the chant and
from far awai note by note mighti organ and silver trumpet told it
melodi
hi brain reel in the ocean of those unimagin harmoni it wa
toss like a straw upon a swirl river toss and overwhelm
slowli veri slowli as the straw might be suck into the heart of a
whirlpool hi soul wa drawn down into black it shudder it wa
afraid thi vision of a whirlpool haunt him he could see the narrow
funnel of it water smooth shine like jet unspeck by foam solid
to all appear but as he wa awar aliv everi atom of them
instinct with some fright energi the veri face of forceand in the
teeth of it less than a dead leaf himself
down he went down and still abov him shone the beauti piti
changeless ey and still round him echo that strang search
music the ey reced the music becam faint and thenblack

dream and the sleep
the christma dai which follow thi strang night prove the happiest
that morri could ever rememb to have spent sinc hi childhood in
hi worldli circumst of cours he wa oppress by none of the
everydai worri which at thi season ar the lot of mostno dun came
to troubl him nor through lack of mean wa he forc to turn ani
beggar from hi door also the babi wa much better and mari spirit
were consequ radiant never inde had she been more love and
charm than when that morn she present him with a splendid gold
chronomet to take the place of the old silver watch which wa hi
mother as a girl and that he had worn all hi life secretli he
sorrow over part with that familiar companion in favour of it
new eightyguinea rival although it wa true that it alwai lost ten
minut a dai and sometim stop altogeth but there wa no help
for it so he kiss mari and wa grate
moreov the dai wa beauti in the morn thei walk to church
through the abbei plantat which run for nearli half a mile along
the edg of the cliff the rime lai thick upon the pine and firseveri
littl needl had it separ coat of white whereon the sun rai
glisten the quiet sea too shone like some gigant emerald and in
the sweet still the song of a robin perch upon the bend bough
of a young poplar sound pure and clear
yet it wa not thi calm and plenti thi glitter ocean fleck with
white sail and bar by delic line of smoke thi blue and
happi sky nor all the other good thing that were given to him in such
abund which steep hi heart in sabbath rest although he sought
no inspir from such drug and inde wa a stranger to them
rather wa hi joi the joi of the opiumeat while the poison work
the joi of him who after suffer long night of pain ha found their
antidot and perhap for the first time appreci the worth of peac
howev empti hi troubl heart had ceas it strive hi wreck
nerv were still hi question had been answer hi end were
attain he had drunk of the divin cup which he desir and it wine
flow through him the dead had visit him and he had tast of the
delight which li hid in death on that dai he felt as though noth
could hurt him ani more noth could even move him the angri voic

mankind what did thei matter he had forc the lock and broken the
bar if onli for a littl while the door had open and he had seen
that which he desir to see and sought with all hi soul and with the
wondrou harvest of thi pure inhuman passion that ow noth to
sex or time or earth he wa satisfi at last
why did you look so strang in church ask mari as thei walk home
and her voic echo in the space of hi void mind as word echo in an
empti hall

as bird ti by the foot ar drawn back and still flutter to be
free brought home to the familiar cage

and talk themselv into silenc about noth in particular
after which morri began to wander round the room and contempl the
furnitur as though he had never seen it befor

your thought and your instrument and the ghost of the old abbot but
pleas come into my room quietli i dont like be woke up after three
in the morn as i wa yesterdai and she went slam the door
behind her
morri went also with hang head and guilti step to hi accustom
haunt in the old chapel he knew that he wa do wrong he could
sympathis with mari indign yet he wa unabl to resist he must
see again must drink onc more of that heavenli cup
and he fail wa it the champagn wa it mari sharp word which had
ruffl him wa it that he had not allow enough time for the energi
which came from him enabl her to appear befor hi mortal ey to
gather afresh in the lifespr of hi own natur or wa she also
angri with him
at least he fail the wave came inde and the cold wind blew but
there wa no sound of music and no vision again and again he strove
to call it upto fanci that he saw it wa useless and at last weari
broken but fill with a mad irrit such as might be felt by a
hungri man who see food which he cannot touch or by a jealou lover
who behold her that should have been hi bride take anoth husband
befor hi ey he crept awai to such rest as he could win
he awok ill wretch and unsatisfi but wisdom had come to him
with sleep he must not fail again it wa too wear he must prepar
himself accord to the rule which he had laid down also he must
concili hi wife so that she did not speak angrili to him and thu
disturb hi calm of mind broken water mirror noth if hi soul wa
to be the glass in which that belov spirit might appear it must be
still and undisturb if then wa she built up in hi imagin or
did he realli see her with hi ey he could not tell and after all it
matter littl so long as he did see her
he grew cunningin such circumst a common symptomaffect a
bonhomi a jovial of demeanour inde which wa rather overdon
he suggest that mari should ask some peopl to tea and twice he
went out shoot a sport which he had almost abandon onli when
she want to invit certain guest to stai he demur a littl on
account of the babi but so cleverli that she never suspect him of
be insincer in short as he could attain hi unholi end in no other
wai morri enter on a career of mild decept design to prevent
hi wife from suspect him of she knew not what hi conduct wa that
of a man engag in an intrigu in hi case howev the possibl end
of hi illdo wa not the divorcecourt but an asylum or so some
observ would have anticip yet did man ever ador a mistress so
fatal and destroi as thi poor shadow of the dead which he desir
it wa not until new year ev that stella came again onc more
enerv and exhaust by the wave morri sank into a doze whenc as
befor he wa awaken by the sound of heavenli music to which on
thi night wa ad the scent of perfum then he open hi eyesto
behold stella as she had been at first so she wa now onli more
lovelya hundr time loveli than the imagin can paint or the
pen can tell here wa noth pale or deathlik no sheet melancholi
spectr but a radiant be whose garment wa the light and whose ey
glow like the heart of some deep jewel about her roll a vision of
mani colour such hue as the rainbow ha fell upon her face and about
her hair and yet it wa the same stella that he had known made perfect
and spiritu and beyond all imagin divin
onc more he addressedimplor her and onc more no answer came nor
did her face chang or that wondrou smile pass from her lip into the
graviti of her ey thi at least wa sure either that she no longer
had ani understand knowledg of hi earthli tongu or that it
demonstr wa to her a thing forbidden what wa she then that
doubl of the bodi which the egyptian call the ka or the soul
itself the preuma no eidolon but the immort ego cloth in
human semblanc made divin
why wa there no answer becaus hi speech wa too gross for her to
hearken to why did she not speak becaus hi ear were deaf wa thi
an illus no a thousand time when he approach she vanish but
what of it he wa mortal she a spirit thei might not mix
yet in her own method she did speak spoke to hi soul bid the
scale fall from it ey so that it might see and it saw what human
imagin could not fashion behold those garden those grove that
hang upon the measureless mountain face and the white flower which
droop in tress from the dark bough of yonder tower poplar tree and
the jewel serpent nestl at it root
oh thei ar gone and when the flameei figur smote the vast
bar precipic fall apart and the road is smooth and open
how far a million mile no twenti thousand million look yonder
shine the destin star now come so it is reach nai do not stop
to stare look again out through utter space to where the low light
glow so come onc more the sun float past like windblown golden
dustlik the countless lamp of boat upon the bosom of a summer sea
there beneath li the veri home of power those spring spark of
light thei ar the ineff decre pass outward through infin
that sound it is the voic of world which worship
look now out yonder see the flame gase gather and coher thei burn
out and the great globe blacken cool mist wrap it rain fall
sea collect contin aris there is life behold it variou and
infinit and hearken to the whisper of thi great univers on tini
note in that song of prais you heard but now ye the life di the
ball grow black again it is the carcas of a world how long have
you watch it for an hour a breath but as you judg time some
ten thousand million year sleep now you ar weari later you shall
understand
thu the wraith of stella spoke to hi soul in vision present
with drum ear and ey befor which strang light seem to plai
morri stagger from the place so weak inde that he could scarc
thrust on foot befor the other yet hi heart wa fill with a mad
joi and hi brain wa drunken with the deep cup of a delight and a
knowledg that have seldom been given to man
on other night the vision were differ thu he saw the spirit of
men go out and return and among them hi own slumber spirit
that a vast and shadowi stella bore in her arm as a mother bear a
babe
he saw also the vision of number all the infinit inhabit of all
the infinit world pass befor him march through the ag to
some end unknown onc too hi mind wa open and he understood
the explan of evil and the reason of thing he shout at their
gloriou simplicityshout for joi but lo befor he rose from hi
chair thei were forgotten
other vision there were without count also thei would mix and fall
into new pattern like the bit of glass in a kaleidoscop there wa
no end to them and each wa loveli or grander or fraught with a
more sweet entranc than the last and still she who brought them
she who open hi ey who caus hi ear to hear and hi soul to
see she whom he worship hi heart twin she who had sworn
herself to him on earth and wa there wait to fulfil the oath to all
etern the woman who had becom a spirit that spirit that had taken
the shape of a womanther she stood and smile and chang and yet
wa changeless and oh what did it matter if hi life wa drain from
him and oh to die at those glitter feet with that perfum breath
stir in hi hair what did he seek more when death would be the
great immort wake when from twilight he pass out to light what
more when in that dawn aw yet smile she should be hi and he
her and thei twain would be on with thought that answer thought
sinc it wa the same thought
there is much that might be toldenough to fill mani page it would be
easi for instanc to set out long list of the entranc dream which
were the soul speech of the spirit of stella and to some extent to
pictur them also the progress of the possess of morri might be
describ and the student of hi histori shown step by step how the
consumm that in her life dai stella had fear overtook him how
the thing got the masteri of him and he becam unfit for hi work
on earth how too hi bodi wast and hi spiritu part develop
till everi physic sight and deed becam a caus of irrit to hi
new natur and at time even a sourc of activ suffer
thu an evil odour the spectacl of pain the cry of grief the sight
of the carcas of dead anim to take a few exampl out of veri
mani were agoni to hi abnorm exasper nerv nor did it stop
there sinc the misfortun which threaten stella when at length
she had succeed in becom bodili consciou of the presenc of the
eidolon of her sister and heard discord among the harmoni of the
rich music of her violin overtook him also
thu for instanc in the scent of the sweetest rose at time morri
would discov someth fright even the guis of tender childhood
ceas to be love in hi ey for now he could see and feel the
bud human brute beneath wors still hi beauti companion mari
fair and graciou as she wa becam almost repuls to him so that
he shrank from her as in common life some delicatenurtur man might
shrink from a fullbodi coarsetongu young fishwif even her daili
need of food which wa healthi though not excess disgust him to
witnessh who wa out of touch with all wholesom appetit of earth
whose distort natur sought an alien rest and solac
of mari herself also it might be narrat how after first mock
at the thought and next thrust it awai by degre she grew to
appreci the realiti of the mysteri foreign influenc which reign
in her home it might be told how in that spiritu atmospher shed
it sleepi indol her own spirit awok and grew consciou and
farse till impress and hint which in the old dai she would
have set asid as idl becam for her pregnant with light and mean
then at last her ey were open and understand much and guess
more she began to watch the attitud of the colonel also could be
studi and how he grew first suspici then sarcast and at last
thoroughli alarm even to hi ultim evacu of the abbei hous
detail at length
but to the chronicl of these do and of their unusu issu at ani
rate it appear best to resist a natur temptat to deni the desir
to paint such close scene in petto much more doe thi certainti
hold of their explan enough ha been said to enabl those in whom
the spark of understand mai burn to discov by it light how much
is left unsaid enough ha been hint at to teach how much there
is still to guess at least few will deni that some thing ar best
abandon to the imagin to attempt to drag the last veil from the
face of truth in ani of her thousand shape is sure a folli predoom
to failur from the begin she ha been a veil divin and
veil howev thinli she must and will remain also even were it
possibl thu to rob her would not her bare ey frighten us
it wa late veri late and there pale and haggard in the low light of
the fire onc again morri stood plead with the radiant imag which
hi heart reveal
oh speak speak he moan aloud i weari of those pictur thei
ar too vast thei crush me i grow weak i have no strength left to
fight against the power of thi fear life that is discov i
cannot bear thi calm everlast life it suck out my mortal as
mist ar suck up by the sun becom human speak let me touch your
hand or be angri onli ceas smile that aw smile and take those
solemn ey out of my heart oh my darl my darl rememb that i
am still a man in piti answer me befor i die
then a low and aw cry and morri turn to behold mari hi wife at
last she had seen and heard and read hi nake heart at last she knew
himmad and in hi mad most unfaithfula man who love on dead
and drag her down to earth for compani
look there in hi charm and secret sight stood the spirit and there
over against her the mortal woman and hewaveringh lost between
the two
certainli he had been sick a long while sinc the sunrai touch the
face of the old abbot carv in that corner of the room to support
the hammer beam thi as he had known from a child onli chanc at
midsumm mari wa bend over him but he wa astonish to find
that he could sit up and move sure then hi mind must have been
more ill than hi bodi
hush she said drink thi dear and go to sleep
it wa a week after and morri had told her all the kind and gentl
wife who wa so good to him who understood and could even smile as he
explain in falter shameheavi word and he had sworn for her
sake and hi children sake that he would put awai thi aw traffic
and seek such fellowship no more
nor for six month did he seek it not till the winter return then
when hi bodi wa strong again the raven hunger of hi soul overcam
him and lest he should go mad or die of long morri broke hi
oatha she wa sure he would
on night mari miss her husband from her side and creep down
in the grei of the morn she found him sit in hi chair in the
chapel workshop smile strang but cold and dead then her heart
seem to break for she love him yet rememb her promis
and the dust whereof he wa made and the fate to which he had been
appoint she forgav him all
the search renew or the fruit of some fresh discoverywhat he sought
or what he saw who knowshad kill him
or perhap stella had seem to speak at last and the word he heard her
sai wa come
thi then is the end of the stori of stella fregeliu upon earth and
thi the write on a leaf torn from the book of three human destini
