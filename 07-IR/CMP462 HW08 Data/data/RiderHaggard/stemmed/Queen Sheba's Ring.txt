chapter i
the come of the ring
everi on ha read the monograph i believ that is the right word
of my dear friend professor higgsptolemi higg to give him hi full
namedescript of the tableland of mur in north central africa of
the ancient underground citi in the mountain which surround it
and of the strang tribe of abyssinian jew or rather their mix
descend by whom it is or wa inhabit i sai everi on
advisedli for although the public which studi such work is usual
select that which will take an interest in them if the charact of a
learn and pugnaci personag is concern is veri wide inde not
to minc matter i mai as well explain what i mean at onc
professor higgss rival and enemi of whom either the brillianc
of hi achiev or hi somewhat abrupt and point method of
controversi seem to have made him a great mani have risen up or rather
seat themselv and written him downwel an individu who strain
the truth inde onli thi morn on of these inquir in a letter
to the press allud to some adventur travel who i am told
lectur to the british associ sever year ago whether professor
higg did not in fact ride across the desert to mur not upon a camel
as he alleg but upon a land tortois of extraordinari size
the innuendo contain in thi epistl ha made the professor who as
i have alreadi hint is not by natur of a meek disposit extrem
angri inde notwithstand all that i could do he left hi london
hous under an hour ago with a whip of hippopotamu hide such as the
egyptian call a koorbash purpos to aveng himself upon the person
of hi defam in order to prevent a public scandal howev i have
taken the liberti of telephon to that gentleman who bold and
viciou as he mai be in print is physic small and i should sai
of a timid charact to get out of the wai at onc to judg from the
abrupt fashion in which our convers came to an end i imagin that
the hint ha been taken at ani rate i hope for the best and as
an extra precaut have commun with the lawyer of my justli
indign friend
the reader will now probabl understand that i am write thi book not
to bring myself or other befor the public or to make monei of which i
have no present need or for ani purpos whatsoev except to set down
the bare and actual truth in fact so mani rumour ar fly about
as to where we have been and what befel us that thi ha becom
almost necessari as soon as i laid down that cruel column of gibe and
insinu to which i have alludedy thi veri morn befor
breakfast thi convict took hold of me so strongli that i cabl
to oliv captain oliv orm the hero of my histori if it ha
ani particular hero who is at present engag upon what must be an
extrem agreeabl journei round the worldask hi consent ten
minut sinc the answer arriv from tokyo here it is
do what you like and think necessari but pleas alter all name et
cetera as propos return via america and fear interview japan
jolli place then follow some privat matter which i need not insert
oliv is alwai extravag where cablegram ar concern
i suppos that befor enter on thi narrat for the reader
benefit i had better give some short descript of myself
my name is richard adam and i am the son of a cumberland yeoman who
marri a welshwoman therefor i have celtic blood in my vein which
perhap account for my love of rove and other thing i am now an old
man near the end of my cours i suppos at ani rate i wa sixtyf
last birthdai thi is my appear as i see it in the glass befor
me tall spare i dont weigh more than a hundr and forti poundsth
desert ha ani superflu flesh that i ever own my lot have been
like falstaff to lard the lean earth but in a hot climat my ey
ar brown my face is long and i wear a point white beard which
match the white hair abov
truth compel me to add that my gener appear as seen in that
glass which will not lie remind me of that of a rather ag goat
inde to be frank by the nativ among whom i have sojourn and
especi among the khalifa peopl when i wa a prison there i
have often been call the white goat
of my veri commonplac outward self let thi suffic as for my record
i am a doctor of the old school think of it when i wa a student at
bart the antisept treatment wa quit a new thing and administ
when at all by help of a kind of engin on wheel out of which
disinfect were dispens with a pump much as the advanc garden
sprai a greenhous todai
i succeed abov the averag as a student and in my earli time as
a doctor but in everi man life there happen thing which whatev
excus mai be found for them would not look particularli well in cold
print nobodi record as understood by convent and the pharise
could realli stand cold print also someth in my blood made me it
servant in short have no strict ti at home and desir to see
the world i wander far and wide for mani year earn my live
as i went never in my experi a difficult thing to do for i wa
alwai a master of my trade
my fortieth birthdai found me practis at cairo which i mention onli
becaus it wa here that first i met ptolemi higg who even then in
hi youth wa note for hi extraordinari antiquarian and linguist
abil i rememb that in those dai the joke about him wa that he
could swear in fifteen languag like a nativ and in thirtytwo with
common profici and could read hieroglyph as easili as a bishop
read the time
well i doctor him through a bad attack of typhoid but as he had
spent everi farth he own on scarab or someth of the sort made
him no charg thi littl kind i am bound to sai he never forgot
for whatev hi fail mai be person i would not trust him alon
with ani object that wa more than a thousand year old ptolemi is a
good and faith friend
in cairo i marri a copt she wa a ladi of high descent the tradit
in her famili be that thei were sprung from on of the ptolema
pharaoh which is possibl and even probabl enough also she wa a
christian and well educ in her wai but of cours she remain an
orient and for a european to marri an orient is as i have tri to
explain to other a veri danger thing especi if he continu
to live in the east where it cut him off from social recognit and
intimaci with hi own race still although thi step of mine forc me
to leav cairo and go to assouan then a littleknown place to practis
chiefli among the nativ god know we were happi enough togeth till
the plagu took her and with it my joi in life
i pass over all that busi sinc there ar some thing too dread
and too sacr to write about she left me on child a son who to
fill up my cup of sorrow when he wa twelv year of ag wa kidnap
by the mardi peopl
thi bring me to the real stori there is nobodi els to write
it oliv will not higg cannot outsid of anyth learn and
antiquarian he is hopeless so i must at ani rate if it is not
interest the fault will be mine not that of the stori which in all
conscienc is strang enough
we ar now in the middl of june and it wa a year ago last decemb
that on the even of the dai of my arriv in london after an absenc
of half a lifetim i found myself knock at the door of professor
higgss room in guildford street wc it wa open by hi
housekeep mr reid a thin and saturnin old woman who remind and
still remind me of a reanim mummi she told me that the professor
wa in but had a gentleman to dinner and suggest sourli that i
should call again the next morn with difficulti i persuad her at
last to inform her master that an old egyptian friend had brought him
someth which he certainli would like to see
five minut later i grope my wai into higgss sittingroom which mr
reid had content herself with indic from a lower floor it is a
larg room run the whole width of the hous divid into two by
an arch where onc in the georgian dai there had been fold door
the place wa in shadow except for the firelight which shone upon a
tabl laid readi for dinner and upon an extraordinari collect of
antiqu includ a coupl of mummi with gold face arrang in
their coffin against the wall at the far end of the room howev an
electr lamp wa alight in the bowwindow hang over anoth tabl
cover with book and by it i saw my host whom i had not met for
twenti year although until i vanish into the desert we frequent
correspond and with him the friend who had come to dinner
first i will describ higg who i mai state is admit even by hi
enemi to be on of the most learn antiquarian and greatest master
of dead languag in europ though thi no on would guess from hi
appear at the ag of about fortyf in build short and stout
face round and highcolour hair and beard of a fieri red ey
when thei can be seenfor gener he wear a pair of larg blue
spectaclessmal and of an indefinit hue but sharp as needl dress
so untidi peculiar and worn that it is said the polic invari
request him to move on should he loiter in the street at night such
wa and is the outward seem of my dearest friend professor ptolemi
higg and i onli hope that he wont be offend when he see it set
down in black and white
that of hi companion who wa seat at the tabl hi chin rest on
hi hand listen to some erudit discours with a rather distract
air wa extraordinarili differ especi by contrast a tall
wellmad young man rather thin but broadshould and appar
five or six and twenti year of ag face cleancutso much so inde
that the dark ey alon reliev it from a suspicion of hard hair
short and straight like the ey brown express that of a man of
thought and abil and when he smile singularli pleasant such wa
and is captain oliv orm who by the wai i should explain is onli
a captain of some volunt engin although in fact a veri abl
soldier as wa prove in the south african war whenc he had then but
late return
i ought to add also that he gave me the impress of a man not in
love with fortun or rather of on with whom fortun wa not in love
inde hi young face seem distinctli sad perhap it wa thi that
attract me to him so much from the first moment that my ey fell on
himm with whom fortun had also been out of love for mani year
while i stood contempl thi pair higg look up from the
papyru or whatev it might be that he wa read i gather later
that he had spent the afternoon in unrol a mummi and wa studi

i drew the ring he had notic off my hand a thick band of rather
lightcolour gold of a size such as an ordinari woman might wear upon
her first or second finger in which wa set a splendid slab of
sapphir engrav with curiou and archaic charact point to these
charact i ask higg if he could read them
read them of cours he answer produc a magnifi glass
cant you no i rememb you never were good at anyth more than
fifti year old hullo thi is earli hebrew ah iv got it and he
read
the gift of solomon the rulerno the great oneof israel belov
of jah to maqueda of shebaland queen daughter of king child of
wisdom beauti

solomon chuck in splendid quit splendidand he touch the gold
with hi tongu and test it with hi teeth humwher did you get
thi intellig fraud from adam
oh i answer laugh the usual thing of cours i bought it
from a donkeyboi in cairo for about thirti shill
inde he repli suspici i should have thought the stone in
it wa worth more than that although of cours it mai be noth
but glass the engrav too is firstrat adam he ad with
sever you ar try to hoax us but let me tell you what i thought
you knew by thi timethat you cant take in ptolemi higg thi
ring is a shameless swindl but who did the hebrew on it he a good
scholar anywai

tell you the truth i thought it wa old egyptian all i do know is
that it wa given or rather lent to me by a ladi whose titl is walda
nagasta and who is suppos to be a descend of solomon and the queen
of sheba
higg took up the ring and look at it again then as though in a fit
of abstract slip it into hi waistcoat pocket
i dont want to be rude therefor i will not contradict you he
answer with a kind of groan or inde sai anyth except that
if ani on els had spun me that yarn i should have told him he wa
a common liar but of cours as everi schoolboi know walda
nagastathat is child of king in ethiopici much the same as
bathmelachimthat is daughter of king in hebrew
here captain orm burst out laugh and remark it is easi to see
why you ar not altogeth popular in the antiquarian world higg your
method of controversi ar those of a savag with a stone ax
if you onli open your mouth to show your ignor oliv you had
better keep it shut the men who carri stone ax had advanc far
beyond the state of savageri but i suggest that you had better
give doctor adam a chanc of tell hi stori after which you can
critic
perhap captain orm doe not wish to be bore with it i said
whereon he answer at onc
on the contrari i should like to hear it veri muchthat is if you
ar will to confid in me as well as in higg
i reflect a moment sinc to tell the truth for sundri reason my
intent had been to trust no on except the professor whom i knew to
be as faith as he is rough yet some instinct prompt me to make
an except in favour of thi captain orm i like the man there wa
someth about those brown ey of hi that appeal to me also it
struck me as odd that he should happen to be present on thi occas
for i have alwai held that there is noth casual or accident in the
world that even the most trivial circumst ar either ordain
or the result of the work of some inexor law whereof the end
is known by whatev power mai direct our step though it be not yet
declar
certainli i am will i answer your face and your friendship
with the professor ar passport enough for me onli i must ask you
to give me your word of honour that without my leav you will repeat
noth of what i am about to tell you
of cours he answer whereon higg broke in
there that will do you dont want us both to kiss the book do you
who sold you that ring and where have you been for the last dozen
year and whenc do you come now
i have been a prison of the khalifa among other thing i had five
year of that entertain of which my back would give some evid
if i were to strip i think i am about the onli man who never embrac
islam whom thei allow to live and that wa becaus i am a doctor
and therefor a us person the rest of the time i have spent
wander about the north african desert look for my son roderick
you rememb the boi or should for you ar hi godfath and i us
to send you photograph of him as a littl chap
of cours of cours said the professor in a new tone i came across
a christma letter from him the other dai but my dear adam what
happen i never heard
he went up the river to shoot crocodil against my order when he wa
about twelv year oldnot veri long after hi mother death and some
wander mahdi tribesmen kidnap him and sold him as a slave i have
been look for him ever sinc for the poor boi wa pass on from
tribe to tribe among which hi skill as a musician enabl me to follow
him the arab call him the singer of egypt becaus of hi wonder
voic and it seem that he ha learn to plai upon their nativ
instrument
and now where is he ask higg as on who fear the answer
he is or wa a favourit slave among a barbar halfnegroid peopl
call the fung who dwell in the far interior of north central africa
after the fall of the khalifa i follow him there it took me sever
year some bedouin were make an expedit to trade with these fung
and i disguis myself as on of them
on a certain night we camp at the foot of a vallei outsid a great
wall which enclos the holi place where their idol is i rode up to
thi wall and through the open gatewai heard some on with a beauti
tenor voic sing in english what he sang wa a hymn that i had
taught my son it begin
abid with me fast fall the eventid
i knew the voic again i dismount and slip through the gatewai
and present came to an open space where a young man sat sing upon
a sort of rais bench with lamp on either side of him and a larg
audienc in front i saw hi face and notwithstand the turban which
he wore and hi eastern robey and the passag of all those yearsi
knew it for that of my son some spirit of mad enter into me and
i call aloud roderick roderick and he start up stare about
him wildli the audienc start up also and on of them caught sight
of me lurk in the shadow
with a howl of rage for i had desecr their sanctuari thei sprang
at me to save my life coward that i wa i fled back through the
gate ye after all those year of seek still i fled rather than
die and though i wa wound with a spear and stone manag to reach
and spring upon my hors then as i wa head off from our camp
i gallop awai anywher still to save my miser life from those
savag so strongli is the instinct of selfpreserv implant
in us from a distanc i look back and saw by the light of the fire
tent that the fung were attack the arab with whom i had travel
i suppos becaus thei thought them parti to the sacrileg afterward
i heard that thei kill them everi on poor men but i escap who
unwittingli had brought their fate upon them
on and on i gallop up a steep road i rememb hear lion roar
round me in the dark i rememb on of them spring upon my
hors and the poor beast scream then i rememb no more till i found
myselfi believ it wa a week or so laterli on the verandah of
a nice hous and be attend by some goodlook women of an
abyssinian cast of counten
sound rather like on of the lost tribe of israel remark higg
sarcast puf at hi big meerschaum
ye someth of that sort the detail i will give you later the
main fact ar that these peopl who pick me up outsid their gate
ar call abati live in a town call mur and alleg themselv to
be descend from a tribe of abyssinian jew who were driven out and
migrat to thi place four or five centuri ago briefli thei
look someth like jew practis a veri debas form of the jewish
religion ar civil and clever after a fashion but in the last
stage of decad from interbreedingabout nine thousand men is their
total fight forc although three or four gener ago thei had
twenti thousandand live in hourli terror of extermin by the
surround fung who hold them in hereditari hate as the possessor
of the wonder mountain fortress that onc belong to their
forefath
gibraltar and spain over again suggest orm
ye with thi differencethat the posit is revers the abati of
thi central african gibraltar ar decai and the fung who answer to
the spaniard ar vigor and increas
well what happen ask the professor
noth particular i tri to persuad these abati to organ an
expedit to rescu my son but thei laugh in my face by degre
i found out that there wa onli on person among them who wa worth
anyth at all and she happen to be their hereditari ruler who bore
the highsound titl of walda nagasta or child of king and takla
warda or bud of the rose a veri handsom and spirit young woman
whose person name is maqueda
on of the name of the first known queen of sheba mutter higg
the other wa belchi
under pretenc of attend her medic i went on for otherwis
their wretch etiquett would scarc have allow me access to on so
exalt i talk thing over with her she told me that the idol of
the fung is fashion like a huge sphinx or so i gather from her
descript of the thing for i have never seen it
what exclaim higg jump up a sphinx in north central africa
well after all why not some of the earlier pharaoh ar said to have
had deal with that part of the world or even to have migrat from
it i think that the makreezi repeat the legend i suppos that it is
ramhead
she told me also i continu that thei have a tradit or rather
a belief which amount to an articl of faith that if thi sphinx
or god which by the wai is lion not ramhead and is call
harmac
harmac interrupt higg again that is on of the name of the
sphinxharmachi god of dawn
if thi god i repeat should be destroi the nation of the fung
whose forefath fashion it as thei sai must move awai from that
countri across the great river which li to the south i have forgotten
it name at the moment but i think it must be a branch of the nile
i suggest to her that in the circumst her peopl had better
try to destroi the idol maqueda laugh and said it wa imposs
sinc the thing wa the size of a small mountain ad that the abati
had long ago lost all courag and enterpris and were content to sit in
their fertil and mountainring land feed themselv with tale of
depart grandeur and struggl for rank and highsound titl till
the dai of doom overtook them
i inquir whether she were also content and she repli certainli
not but what could she do to regener her peopl she who wa
noth but a woman and the last of an endless line of ruler
rid me of the fung she ad passion and i will give you
such a reward as you never dream the old cavec yonder is full of
treasur that wa buri with it ancient king long befor we came to
mur to us it is useless sinc we have none to trade with but i have
heard that the peopl of the outsid world worship gold
i do not want gold i answer i want to rescu my son who is a
prison yonder
then said the child of king you must begin by help us to
destroi the idol of the fung ar there no mean by which thi can be
done
there ar mean i repli and i tri to explain to her the
properti of dynamit and of other more power explos
go to your own land she exclaim eagerli and return with that
stuff and two or three who can manag it and i swear to them all the
wealth of mur thu onli can you win my help to save your son
well what wa the end ask captain orm
thi thei gave me some gold and an escort with camel which were
liter lower down a secret path in the mountain so as to avoid the
fung who ring them in and of whom thei ar terribl afraid with these
peopl i cross the desert to assouan in safeti a journei of mani
week where i left them encamp about sixteen dai ago bid them
await my return i arriv in england thi morn and as soon as i
could ascertain that you still live and your address from a book of
refer call who who which thei gave me in the hotel i came on
here
why did you come to me what do you want me to do ask the
professor
i came to you higg becaus i know how deepli you ar interest
in anyth antiquarian and becaus i wish to give you the first
opportun not onli of win wealth but also of becom famou as
the discover of the most wonder relic of antiqu that ar left
in the world
with a veri good chanc of get my throat cut thrown in grumbl
higg
as to what i want you to do i went on i want you to find someon
who understand explos and will undertak the busi of blow
up the fung idol
well that easi enough anyhow said the professor point to
captain orm with the bowl of hi pipe and ad he is an engin
by educ a soldier and a veri fair chemist also he know arab
and wa brought up in egypt as a boyjust the man for the job if he
will go
i reflect a moment then obei some sort of instinct look up and
ask
will you captain orm if term can be arrang
yesterdai he repli colour a littl i should have answer
certainli not todai i answer that i am prepar to consid the
matterthat is if higg will go too and you can enlighten me on
certain point but i warn you that i am onli an amateur in the three
trade that the professor ha mention though it is true on with
some experi
would it be rude to inquir captain orm why twentyfour hour have
made such a differ in your view and plan
not rude onli awkward he repli colour again thi time more
deepli still as it is best to be frank i will tell you yesterdai
i believ myself to be the inheritor of a veri larg fortun from an
uncl whose fatal ill brought me back from south africa befor i
meant to come and as whose heir i have been brought up todai i have
learn for the first time that he marri secretli last year a woman
much below him in rank and ha left a child who of cours will take
all hi properti as he di intest but that is not all yesterdai i
believ myself to be engag to be marri todai i am undeceiv
upon that point also the ladi he ad with some bitter who
wa will to marri anthoni orm heir is no longer will to marri
oliv orm whose total possess amount to under 10000 well
small blame to her or to her relat whichev it mai be especi
as i understand that she ha a better allianc in view certainli her
decis ha simplifi matter and he rose and walk to the other
end of the room
shock busi whisper higg been infam treat and
he proceed to express hi opinion of the ladi concern of her
rel and of the late anthoni orm shipown in languag that
if print would render thi histori unfit for famili read the
outspoken of professor higg is well known in the antiquarian world
so there is no need for me to enlarg upon it
what i do not exactli understand adam he ad in a loud voic
see that orm had turn again and what i think we should both like
to know is your exact object in make these propos
i am afraid i have explain myself badli i thought i had made it
clear that i have onli on objectto attempt the rescu of my son

posit imagin yourself with noth and no on left to care for
except a singl child and that child stolen awai from you by savag

i nod judg from the episod of the mummi and the policeman that

noth beyond my pai if we get noth captain but if we get
someth would five per cent be too much
it might be ten i suggest sergeant quick ha a life to lose like
the rest of us
thank you kindli sir he answer but that in my opinion would be
too much five per cent wa what i suggest
so it wa written down that sergeant samuel quick wa to receiv five
per cent of the total profit if ani provid that he behav himself
and obei order then he also sign the agreement and wa furnish
with a glass of whiski and water to drink to it good health
now gentlemen he said declin the chair which higg offer
to him appar becaus from long custom he prefer hi
woodensoldi attitud against the wall as a humbl fiveperc
privat in thi veri adventur compani ill ask permiss to sai a
word
permiss wa given accordingli and the sergeant proceed to inquir
what weight of rock it wa wish to remov
i told him that i did not know as i had never seen the fung idol but
i understood that it size wa enorm probabl as larg as st paul
cathedr
which if solid would take some stir remark the sergeant
dynamit might do it but it is too bulki to be carri across the
desert on camel in that quantiti captain how about them picrat you
rememb those new boer shell that blew a lot of us to kingdom come
and poison the rest
ye answer orm i rememb but now thei have stronger
stuffsazoimid i think thei call themterrif new compound of
nitrogen we will inquir tomorrow sergeant
ye captain he answer but the point is wholl pai you cant
bui hellfir in bulk for noth i calcul that allow for
the purchas of the explos and sai fifti militari rifl with
ammunit and all other necessari not includ camel the outfit
of thi expedit cant come to less than 1500
i think i have that amount in gold i answer of which the ladi of
the abati gave me as much as i could carri in comfort
if not said orm although i am a poor man now i could find 500
or so in a pinch so dont let us bother about the monei the question
isar we all agre that we will undertak thi expedit and see it
through to the end whatev that mai be
we answer that we were
then ha anybodi anyth more to sai
ye i repli i forgot to tell you that if we should ever get to
mur none of you must make love to the walda nagasta she is a kind of
holi person who can onli marri into her own famili and to do so might
mean that our throat would be cut
do you hear that oliv said the professor i suppos that the
doctor warn is meant for you as the rest of us ar rather past
that kind of thing
inde repli the captain colour again after hi fashion well
to tell you the truth i feel a bit past it myself and so far as i
am concern i dont think we need take the fascin of thi black
ladi into account
dont brag captain pleas dont brag said sergeant quick in a
hollow whisper woman is just the on thing about which you can never
be sure todai she poison and tomorrow honeygod and the climat
alon know why pleas dont brag or we mai live to see you crawl
after thi on on your knee with the gent in the spec behind and
samuel quick who hate the whole tribe of them bring up the rear
tempt provid if you like captain but dont tempt woman lest she
should turn round and tempt you as she ha done befor todai
will you be so good as to stop talk nonsens and call a cab said
captain orm coldli but higg began to laugh in hi rude fashion and
i rememb the appear of bud of the rose when she lift
her veil of ceremoni and the soft earnest of her voic fell into
reflect black ladi inde what i wonder would thi young
gentleman think if ever he should live to set hi ey upon her sweet
and come face
it seem to me that sergeant quick wa not so foolish as hi master
chose to imagin captain orm undoubtedli wa in everi wai qualifi to
be a partner in our ventur still i could have wish either that
he had been an older man or that the ladi to whom he wa recent
affianc had not chosen thi occas to break her engag in
deal with difficult and danger combin my experi ha
been that it is alwai well to elimin the possibl of a love
affair especi in the east
chapter iii
the professor goe out shoot
of all our tremend journei across the desert until we had pass the
forest and reach the plain which surround the mountain of mur
there ar i think but few incid with which the reader need be
troubl the first of these wa at assouan where a letter and variou
telegram overtook captain orm which as by thi time we had becom
intim he show to me thei inform him that the clandestin infant
whom hi uncl left behind him had suddenli sicken and di of some
childish ailment so that he wa onc again heir to the larg properti
which he thought he had lost sinc the widow onli took a life interest
in some of the personalti i congratul him and said i suppos thi
meant that we should not have the pleasur of hi compani to mur
why not he ask i said i wa go and i mean to go inde i
sign a document to that effect
i daresai i answer but circumst alter case if i might sai
so an adventur that perhap wa good enough for a young and wellborn
man of spirit and enterpris without ani particular resourc is no
longer good enough for on who ha the ball at hi feet think what a
ball it is to a man of your birth intellig record and now
great fortun come to you in youth why with these advantag there
is absolut noth that you cannot do in england you can go into
parliament and rule the countri if you like you can becom a peer
you can marri ani on who isnt of the blood royal in short with
uncommonli littl effort of your own your career is made for you dont
throw awai a silver spoon like that in order perhap to die of thirst
in the desert or be kill in a fight among unknown tribe
oh i dont know he answer i never set heart much on spoon
silver or other when i lost thi on i didnt cry and now that i have
found it again i shant sing anywai i am go on with you and you
cant prevent me under the agreement onli as i have got such a lot to
leav i suppos i had better make a will first and post it home which
is a bore
just then the professor came in follow by an arab thief of a dealer
with whom he wa try to bargain for some object of antiqu when
the dealer had been eject and the posit explain to him higg
who whatev mai be hi fail in small matter is unselfish enough
in big on said that he agre with me and thought that under the
circumst in hi own interest orm ought to leav us and return
home
you mai save your breath old fellow answer the captain for thi
reason if for no other and he threw him a letter across the tabl
which letter i saw afterward to be brief it wa from the young
ladi to whom he had been engag to be marri and who on hi loss of
fortun had jilt him now she seem to have chang her mind
again and although she did not mention the matter it is perhap not
uncharit to suppos that the new of the death of the inconveni
child had someth to do with her decis
have you answer thi ask higg
no answer orm set hi mouth i have not answer and i
am not go to answer it either in write or in person i intend to
start tomorrow for mur and to travel as far on that road as it pleas
fate to allow and now i am go to look at the rock sculptur by the
cataract
well that flat said higg after he had depart and for my part
i am glad of it for somehow i think he will be a us man among those
fung also if he went i expect that the sergeant would go too and
where should we be without quick i should like to know
afterward i convers with the said quick about thi same matter
repeat to him my opinion to which the sergeant listen with the
defer which he wa alwai kind enough to show to me
beg your pardon sir he said when i had finish but i think
you ar both right and wrong everyth ha two end hasnt it you
sai that it would be wick for the captain to get himself kill there
be now so much monei for him to live for see that life is common
as dirt while monei is preciou rare and hard to come by it aint
the king we admir it their crown it aint the millionair
it their million but after all the millionair dont take their
million with them for provid that like natur hate wast
know that if thei did theyd melt so on man dead give anoth bread
as the sai goe or prap i should sai gingerbread in such case
still on the whole sir i admit you ar right as to the sin of
wast luck but now come the other end i know thi young ladi what
the captain wa engag to which he never would have been if he had
taken my advic sinc of all the fishblood littl serpent that ever
i set ey on she the serpentest though pretti i allow solomon said
in hi hast that an honest woman he had not found but if he had met
the honour misswel never mind her nameh have said it at
hi leisur and gone on sai it now no on should never take back
a servant what ha given notic and then sai he sorri for if he doe
the sorrow will be on the other side befor it all done and much less
should he take back a fianc quick said a financ on the whole
hed better drown himselfi tri it onc and i know so that the
tail of the busi
but he went on it ha a coupl of fin as well like that eel beast
i caught in the nile on of them is that the captain promis and vow
to go through with thi expedit and if a man got to die hed
better die honest without break hi word and the other is what
i said to you in london when i sign on that he wont die a minut
befor hi time and noth wont happen to him but what bound
to happen and therefor it aint a haporth of us bother about
anyth and that where the east well ahead of the west
and now sir ill go and look after the camel and those halfbr
jew boi what you call abati but i call rotten sneak for if thei get
their thiev finger into those canist of picric salt think
theyr jam as i found them try to do yesterdai someth mai
happen in egypt thatll make the pharaoh turn in their grave and the
ten plagu look silli
so have finish hi orat quick went and in due cours we
start for mur
the second incid that is perhap worth record wa an adventur
that happen to us when we had complet about two of our four month
journei
after week of weari desert travelif i rememb right it wa exactli
a fortnight after the dog pharaoh of which i shall soon have plenti to
sai had come into orm possessionw reach an oasi call zeu
where i had halt upon my road down to egypt in thi oasi which
although not larg in extent possess spring of beauti water and
grove of datetre we were as it chanc veri welcom sinc when
i wa there befor i had been fortun enough to cure it sheik of
an attack of ophthalmia and to doctor sever of hi peopl for variou
ailment with good result so although i wa burn to get forward i
agre with the other that it would be wise to acced to the request
of the leader of our caravan a clever and resourc but to my mind
untrustworthi abati of the name of shadrach and camp in zeu for a week
or so to rest and feed our camel which had wast almost to noth on
the scant herbag of the desert
thi shadrach i mai add here whom hi companion for some reason
unknown to me at that time call the cat wa remark for a tripl
line of scar upon hi face which he inform me had been set there
by the claw of a lion now the great enemi of thi peopl of zeu were
lion which at certain season of the year i suppos when food grew
scarc descend from the slope of a rang of hill that stretch
east and west at a distanc of about fifti mile north of the oasi
and cross the interven desert kill mani of the zeu sheep
camel and other cattl and often enough ani of the tribe whom thei
could catch as these poor zeu practic possess no firearm thei
were at the merci of the lion which grew correspondingli bold inde
their onli resourc wa to kraal their anim within stone wall at
night and take refug in their hut which thei seldom left between
sunset and dawn except to replenish the fire that thei lit to scare
ani beast of prei which might be prowl through the town
though the lion season wa now in full swing as it happen for the
first five dai of our stai at zeu we saw none of these great cat
although in the dark we heard them roar in the distanc on the
sixth night howev we were awaken by a sound of wail which came
from the villag about a quarter of a mile awai and when we went out
at dawn to see what wa the matter were met by a melancholi process
advanc from it wall at the head of it march the greyhair old
chief follow by a number of scream women who in their excit
or perhap as a sign of mourn had omit to make their toilett
and by four men who carri someth horrid on a wickerwork door
soon we learn what had happen it seem that hungri lion two or
three of them had broken through the palmleaf roof of the hut of on
of the sheik wive she whose remain were stretch upon the door
and in addit to kill her had actual carri off hi son
now he came to implor us white men who had gun to reveng him on the
lion which otherwis have onc tast human flesh would destroi
mani more of hi peopl
through an interpret who knew arab for not even higg could
understand the peculiar zeu dialect he explain in excit and
incoher word that the beast lai up among the sandhil not veri
far awai where some thick reed grew around a littl spring of water
would we not come out and kill them and earn the bless of the zeu
now i said noth for the simpl reason that have such big matter
on hand although i wa alwai fond of sport i did not wish ani of us
to be led off after these lion there is a time to hunt and a time
to ceas from hunt and it seem to me except for the purpos of
food that thi journei of our wa the latter howev as i expect
oliv orm liter leap at the idea so did higg who of late
had been practis with a rifl and began to fanci himself a shot
he exclaim loudli that noth would give him greater pleasur
especi as he wa sure that lion were in fact cowardli and overr
beast
from that moment i forebod disast in my heart still i said i would
come too partli becaus i had not shot a lion for mani a dai and had
a score to settl with those beast which it mai be rememb nearli
kill me on the mountain of mur and partli becaus know the desert
and also the zeu peopl much better than either the professor or orm i
thought that i might possibl be of servic
so we fetch our rifl and cartridg to which by an afterthought we
ad two larg waterbottl and at a hearti breakfast as we were
prepar to start shadrach the leader of the abati cameldriv
that man with the scar face who wa nicknam the cat came up to me
and ask me whither we were go i told him whereon he said
what have you to do with these savag and their troubl lord if
a few of them ar kill it is no matter but as you should know o
doctor if you wish to hunt lion there ar plenti in that land whither
you travel see that the lion is the fetish of the fung and therefor
never kill but the desert about zeu is danger and harm mai come to
you
then accompani us broke in the professor between whom and shadrach
there wa no love lost for of cours with you we should be quit
safe
not so he repli i and my peopl rest onli madmen would go to
hunt worthless wild beast when thei might rest have we not enough of
the desert and it danger as it is if you knew all that i do of lion
you would leav them alon
of the desert we have plenti also but of shoot veri littl
remark the captain who talk arab well lie in your bed we go
to kill the beast that harass the poor peopl who have treat us so
kindli
so be it said shadrach with a smile that struck me as malici a
lion made thispoint to the dread threefold scar upon hi face
mai the god of israel protect you from lion rememb lord that
the camel be fresh again we march the dai after tomorrow should
the weather hold for if the wind blow on yonder sandhil no man mai
live among them and put up hi hand he studi the sky carefulli
from beneath it shadow then with a grunt turn and vanish behind
a hut
all thi while sergeant quick wa engag at a littl distanc in
wash up the tin breakfast thing to all appear quit unconsci
of what wa go on orm call him whereupon he advanc and
stood to attent i rememb think how curiou he look in those
surroundingshi tall boni frame cloth in semimilitari garment
hi wooden face perfectli shave hi irongrei hair neatli part and
plaster down upon hi head with pomad or some equival after the
old privat soldier fashion and hi sharp ferretlik grei ey take
in everyth
ar you come with us sergeant ask orm
not unless order so to do captain i like a bit of hunt well
enough but with all three offic awai some on should mount guard
over the store and transport so i think the dog pharaoh and i had best
stop behind
perhap you ar right sergeant onli tie pharaoh up or hell follow
me well what do you want to sai out with it
onli thi captain although i have serv in three campaign among
these here arabian to quick all african nativ north of the equat
were arabian and all south of it nigger i cant sai i talk their
lingo well still i made out that the fellow thei call cat dont like
thi trip of your and beg your pardon captain whatev els cat
mai be he aint no fool
cant help it sergeant for on thing it would never do to give in to
hi fanci now
that true captain when onc it hoist right or wrong keep the
flag fly and no doubt youll come back safe and sound if your
meant to
then have reliev hi mind the sergeant ran hi ey over our
equip to see that noth had been forgotten rapidli assur
himself that the rifl were in work order report all well
and return to hi dish littl did ani of us guess under what
circumst we should next meet with him
after leav the town and march for a mile or so along the oasi
accompani by a mob of the zeu arm with spear and bow we were
led by the bereav chief who also act as tracker out into the
surround sand the desert here although i rememb it well
enough wa differ from ani that we had yet encount upon thi
journei be compos of huge and abrupt sandhil some of which
were quit three hundr feet high separ from each other by deep
windcut vallei
for a distanc while thei were within reach of the moist air of the
oasi these sandmountain produc veget of variou sort
present howev we pass out into the wilder proper and for
a while climb up and down the steep shift slope till from the
crest of on of them the chief point out what in south africa is
call a pan or vlei cover with green reed and explain by
sign that in these lai the lion descend a steep decliv we
post ourselv i at the top and higg and orm a littl wai down
either side of thi vlei thi done we dispatch the zeu to beat
it out toward us for although the reed grew thick along the cours
of the underground water it wa but a narrow place and not more than a
quarter of a mile in length
scarc had the beater enter the tall reed evid with
trepid for a good mani of them held back from the adventur
when a sound of loud wail inform us that someth had happen a
minut or two later we saw two of them bear awai what appear to be
the mangl remain of the chief son who had been carri off on the
previou night
just then too we saw someth els for halfwai down the marsh
a great male lion broke cover and began to steal off toward the
sandhil it wa about two hundr yard from higg who chanc to
be nearest to it and therefor as ani biggam hunter will know for
practic purpos far out of shot but the professor who wa quit
unaccustom to thi or inde ani kind of sport and like all
beginn wildli anxiou for blood lift hi rifl and fire as he
might have done at a rabbit by some marvel accid the aim wa
good and the bullet from the express strike the lion fair behind the
shoulder pass through it heart and knock it over dead as a stone
by jingo did you see that scream higg in hi delight then
without even stop to reload the empti barrel he set off at the top
of hi speed toward the prostrat beast follow by myself and by orm
as fast as our astonish would allow
run along the edg of the marsh higg had cover about a hundr
yard of the distanc when suddenli charg straight at him out of
the tall reed appear a second lion or rather lioness higg wheel
round and wildli fire the left barrel of hi rifl without touch
the infuri brute next instant to our horror we saw him upon
hi back with the lioness stand over him lash her tail and
growl
we shout as we ran and so did the zeu although thei made no attempt
at rescu with the result that the lioness instead of tear higg
to piec turn her head confusedli first to on side and then to
the other by now i who had a long start of orm wa quit close
sai within thirti yard though fire i dare not as yet fear lest
should i do so i might kill my friend at thi moment the lioness
recov her nerv squat down on the prostrat higg and though
he hit at her with hi fist drop her muzzl evid with the
intent of bite him through the head
now i felt that if i hesit ani more all would be finish the
lioness wa much longer than higgsa short stout manand her hind
quarter project beyond hi feet at these i aim rapidli and
press the trigger next second heard the bullet clap upon the great
beast hide up she sprang with a roar on hind leg dangl and
after a moment hesit fled toward the sandhil
now orm who wa behind me fire also knock up the dust beneath
the lionesss belli but although he had more cartridg in hi rifl
which wa a repeat befor either he or i could get anoth chanc
it vanish behind a mound leav it to go where it would we ran on
toward higg expect to find him either dead or badli maul
but to our amaz and delight up jump the professor hi blue
spectacl still on hi nose and load hi rifl as he went charg
awai after the wound lioness
come back shout the captain as he follow
not for joe yell higg in hi high voic if you fellow think
that im go to let a great cat sit on my stomach for noth you ar
jolli well mistaken
at the top of the first rise the longleg orm caught him but
persuad him to return wa more than he or i when i arriv could do
beyond a scratch on hi nose which had stung him and cover him
with blood we found that he wa quit uninjur except in temper and
digniti but in vain did we beg him to be content with hi luck and the
honour he had won
why he answer adam wound the beast and id rather kill two
lion than on also i have a score to squar but if you fellow ar
afraid you go home
well i confess i felt inclin to accept the invit but orm who
wa nettl repli
come come that settl the question doesnt it you must be shaken
by your fall or you would not talk like that higg look here run
the spoorse the blood well let go steadi and keep our wind
we mai come on her anywher but dont you try ani more long distanc
shot you wont kill anoth lion at two hundr and fifti yard
all right said higg dont be offend i didnt mean anyth
except that i am go to teach that beast the differ between a
white man and a zeu
then we began our march follow the blood track up and down the
steep sandslop when we had been at it for about halfanhour our
spirit were cheer by catch sight of the lioness on a ridg five
hundr yard awai just then too some of the zeu overtook us and
join the hunt though without zeal
meanwhil as the dai grew the heat increas until it wa so intens
that the hot air danc abov the sand slope like billion of midg
and thi although the sun wa not visibl be hidden by a sort of
mist a strang silenc unusu even in the desert pervad the earth
and sky we could hear the grain of sand trickl from the ridg
the zeu who accompani us grew uneasi and point upward with their
spear then behind toward the oasi of which we had long lost sight
final when we were not look thei disappear
now i would have follow them guess that thei had some good reason
for thi sudden departur but higg refus to come and orm in whom
hi foolish taunt seem still to rankl onli shrug hi shoulder
and said noth
let the black cur go exclaim the professor as he polish hi blue
spectacl and mop hi face thei ar a whiteliv lot of sneak
look there she is creep off to the left if we run round that
sandhil we shall meet her
so we ran round the sandhil but we did not meet her although after
long hunt we struck the blood spoor afresh and follow it for
sever mile first in thi direct and then in that until orm and
i wonder at higgss obstinaci and endur at length when even he
wa begin to despair we put up the lioness in a hollow and fire
sever shot at her as she hobbl over the oppos slope on of
which hit her for she roll over then pick herself up again
roar as a matter of fact it came from the captain rifl but
higg who like mani an inexperienc person wa a jealou sportsman
declar that it wa hi and we did not think it worth while to
contradict him
on we toil and just beyond the ridg walk straight into the
lioness sit up like a great dog so injur that she could do
noth but snarl hideous and paw at the air
now it is my turn old ladi ejacul higg and straightwai
miss her clean from a distanc of five yard a second shot wa more
success and she roll over dead
come on said the exult professor and well skin her she sat on
me and i mean to sit on her for mani a dai
so we began the job although i who had larg experi of thi
desert and did not like the appear of the weather wish to leav
the beast where it lai and get back to the oasi it prove long for
i wa the onli on of us who had ani practic knowledg of flai
anim and in that heat extrem unpleas
at length it wa done and have doubl the hide over a rifl for two
of us to carri in turn we refresh ourselv from the waterbottl
i even caught the professor wash the blood off hi face and hand
with some of the preciou fluid then we start for the oasi onli to
discov though we were all sure that we knew the wai that not on
of us had a slightest idea of it real direct in the hurri of our
departur we had forgotten to bring a compass and the sun that would
have been our guid in ordinari circumst and to which we alwai
trust in the open desert wa hidden by the curiou haze that ha been
describ
so sensibl enough we determin to return to the sand crest where we
had kill the lioness and then trace our own footprint backward thi
seem simpl enough for there within halfamil rose the ident
ridg
we reach it grumbl for the lionskin wa heavi onli to discov
that it wa a total differ ridg now after reflect and
argument we saw our exact mistak and made for what wa obvious the
real ridgewith the same result
we were lost in the desert
chapter iv
the death wind
the fact is said higg present speak with the air of an oracl
the fact is that all these accurs sandhil ar as like each other
as mummi bead on the same necklac and therefor it is veri difficult
to know them apart give me that waterbottl adam i am as dry as a
limekiln
no i said shortli you mai be drier befor the end
what do you mean oh i see but that nonsens those zeu will hunt
us up or at the worst we have onli to wait till the sun get out
as he spoke suddenli the air becam fill with a curiou sing sound
imposs to describ caus as i knew who had often heard it befor
by million and million of particl of sand be rub togeth we
turn to see whenc it came and perceiv far awai rush toward
us with extraordinari swift a huge and dens cloud preced by
isol column and funnel of similar cloud
a sandstorm said higg hi florid face pale a littl bad luck
for us that what come of get out of bed the wrong side first
thi morn no it your fault adam you help me to salt last
night in spite of my remonstr the professor ha sundri littl
superstit of thi sort particularli absurd in so learn a man
well what shall we do get under the lee of the hill until it blow
over
dont suppos it will blow over cant see anyth to do except sai
our prayer remark orm with sweet resign oliv is i think
the coolest hand in an emerg of ani on i ever met except perhap
sergeant quick a man of cours nearli old enough to be hi father
the game seem to be pretti well up he ad well you have kill
two lion higg and that is someth
oh hang it you can die if you like oliv the world wont miss you
but think of it loss if anyth happen to me i dont intend to be
wipe out by a beastli sandstorm i intend to live to write a book on
mur and higg shook hi fist at the advanc cloud with an air that
wa realli nobl it remind me of ajax defi the lightn
meanwhil i had been reflect
listen i said our onli chanc is to stop where we ar for if we
move we shall certainli be buri aliv look there is someth
solid to lie on and i point to a ridg of rock a kind of core of
congeal sand from which the surfac had been swept by gale down
with you quick i went on and let draw that lionskin over our
head it mai help to keep the dust from choke us hurri men it
come
come it wa inde with a mighti wail roar scarc had we got
ourselv into posit our back to the blast and our mouth and
nose buri after the fashion of camel in a similar predica the
lionskin cover our head and bodi to the middl with the paw
tuck secur beneath us to prevent it from be blown awai when the
storm leap upon us furious bring dark in it train there
we lai for hour after hour unabl to see unabl to talk becaus of the
roar nois about us and onli from time to time lift ourselv
a littl upon our hand and knee to disturb the weight of sand that
accumul on our bodi lest it should encas us in a live tomb
dread were the miseri we sufferedth miseri of the heat beneath
the stink pelt of the lion the miseri of the dustladen air that
choke us almost to suffoc the miseri of thirst for we could not
get at our scanti suppli of water to drink but worst of all perhap
wa the pain caus by the continu friction of the sharp sand driven
along at hurrican speed which incred as it mai seem final wore
hole in our thin cloth and file our skin to raw
no wonder the egyptian monument get such a beauti shine on them i
heard poor higg mutter in my ear again and again for he wa grow
lighthead no wonder no wonder my shinbon will be veri us
to polish quick tall ridingboot oh curs the lion why did you
help me to salt you old ass why did you help me to salt it pickl
me behind
then he becam quit incoher and onli groan from time to time
perhap howev thi suffer did us a servic sinc otherwis
exhaust thirst and dust might have overwhelm our sens and
caus us to fall into a sleep from which we never should have awaken
yet at the time we were not grate to it for at last the agoni becam
almost unbear inde orm told me afterward that the last thing
he could rememb wa a quaint fanci that he had made a coloss fortun
by sell the secret of a new tortur to the chinesethat of hot sand
driven on to the victim by a continu blast of hot air
after a while we lost count of time nor wa it until later that we
learn that the storm endur for full twenti hour dure the latter
part of which notwithstand our manifold suffer we must have
becom more or less insens at ani rate at on moment i rememb
the aw roar and the sting of the sand whip follow by a kind
of vision of the face of my sonthat belov longlost son whom i had
sought for so mani year and for whose sake i endur all these thing
then without ani interv as it were i felt my limb be scorch
as though by hot iron or through a burningglass and with a fear
effort stagger up to find that the storm had pass and that the
furiou sun wa blister my excori skin rub the cake dirt
from my ey i look down to see two mound like those of grave out
of which project leg that had been white just then on pair of leg
the longer pair stir the sand heav up convuls and utter
wander word in a choki voic there aros the figur of oliv orm
for a moment we stood and stare at each other and strang spectacl
we were
is he dead mutter orm point to the still buri higg
fear so i answer but well look and painfulli we began to
disint him
when we came to it beneath the lionskin the professor face wa black
and hideou to see but to our relief we perceiv that he wa not
dead for he move hi hand and moan orm look at me
water would save him i said
then came the anxiou moment on of our waterbottl wa empti
befor the storm began but the other a larg patent flask cover
with felt and have a screw vulcanit top should still contain a good
quantiti perhap three quartsthat is if the fluid had not evapor
in the dread heat if thi had happen it meant that higg
would die and unless help came that soon we should follow him orm
unscrew the flask for my hand refus that offic and us hi
teeth to draw the cork which providenti enough the thought
quick had set in the neck beneath the screw some of the water which
although it wa quit hot had not evapor thank god flew against
hi parch lip and i saw him bite them till the blood came in the
fierc of the temptat to assuag hi rage thirst but he
resist it like the man he is and without drink a drop hand me
the bottl sai simpli
you ar the oldest take care of thi adam
now it wa my turn to be tempt but i too overcam and sit
down laid higgss head upon my knee then drop by drop let a littl
of the water trickl between hi swollen lip
the effect wa magic for in less than a minut the professor sat up
grasp at the flask with both hand and strove to tear it awai
you cruel brute you cruel selfish brute he moan as i wrench it
from him
look here higg i answer thickli orm and i want water badli
enough and we have had none but you might take it all if it would save
you onli it wouldnt we ar lost in the desert and must be spare
if you drank everyth now in a few hour you would be thirsti again
and die
he thought awhil then look up and said
beg pardoni understand im the selfish brute but there a good lot
of water there let each have a drink we cant move unless we do
so we drank measur out the water in a littl indiarubb cup which
we had with us it held about as much as a port wine glass and each of
us drank or rather slowli sip three cup we who felt as though
we could have swallow a gallon apiec and ask for more small as
wa the allow it work wonder in us we were men again
we stood up and look about us but the great storm had chang
everyth where there had been sandhil a hundr feet high
now were plain and vallei where there had been vallei appear
sandhil onli the high ridg upon which we had lain wa as befor
becaus it stood abov the other and had a core of rock we tri to
discov the direct of the oasi by the posit of the sun onli to
be baffl sinc our two watch had run down and we did not know the
time of dai or where the sun ought to be in the heaven also in
that howl wilder there wa noth to show us the point of the
compass
higg whose obstinaci remain unimpair whatev mai have happen
to the rest of hi vital forc had on view of the matter and orm
anoth diametr oppos to it thei even argu as to whether
the oasi lai to our right or to our left for their poor head were
so confus that thei were scarc capabl of accur thought or
observ meanwhil i sat down upon the sand and consid through
the haze i could see the point of what i thought must be the hill
whenc the zeu declar that the lion came although of cours for
aught i knew thei might be other hill
listen i said if lion live upon those hill there must be water
there let us try to reach them perhap we shall see the oasi as we
go
then began our dread march the lionskin that had save our live
and wa now bake hard as a board we left behind but the rifl we
took all dai long we drag ourselv up and down steep sandslop
paus now again to drink a sip of water and hope alwai that from
the top of the next slope we should see a rescu parti head by quick
or perhap the oasi itself inde onc we did see it green and
shine not more than three mile awai but when we got to the head of
the hill beyond which it should lie we found that the vision wa onli
a mirag and our heart nearli broke with disappoint oh to men
dy of thirst that mirag wa inde a cruel mockeri
at length night approach and the mountain were yet a long wai off
we could march no more and sank down exhaust ly on our face
becaus our back were so cut by the drive sand and blister by
the sun that we could not sit by now almost all our water wa gone
suddenli higg nudg us and point upward follow the line of hi
hand we saw not thirti yard awai and show clear against the sky
a file of antelop trek along the sandridg doubtless on a night
journei from on pasturag to anoth
you fellow shoot he mutter i might miss and frighten them awai
for in hi distress poor higg wa grow modest
slowli orm and i drew ourselv to our knee cock our rifl by
thi time all the buck save on had pass there were but six of them
and thi on march along about twenti yard behind the other orm
pull the trigger but hi rifl would not go off becaus as he
discov afterward some sand had work into the mechan of the
lock
meanwhil i had also cover the buck but the sunset dazzl my
weaken ey and my arm were feebl also my terribl anxieti for
success sinc i knew that on thi shot hung our live unnerv me but
it must be now or never in three more pace the beast would be down the
dip
i fire and know that i had miss turn sick and faint the
antelop bound forward a few yard right to the edg of the dip then
never have heard such a sound befor and be overcom by some fatal
curios stop and turn around stare at the direct whenc it
had come
despairingli i fire again almost without take aim and thi time the
bullet went in beneath the throat and rake the anim drop it
dead as a stone we scrambl to it and present were engag in an
aw meal of which we never afterward like to think happili for us
that antelop must have drunk water not long befor
our hunger and thirst assuag after thi horribl fashion we slept
awhil by the carcas then aros extraordinarili refresh and have
cut off some hunk of meat to carri with us start on again by the
posit of the star we now knew that the oasi must lie somewher to
the east of us but as between us and it there appear to be noth
but these etern sandhil stretch awai for mani mile and as in
front of us toward the rang the charact of the desert seem to be
chang we thought it safer if the word safeti can be us in such
a connect to continu to head for that rang all the remaind of
thi night we march and as we had no fuel wherewith to cook it at
dawn at some of the raw meat which we wash down with the last drop
of our water
now we were out of the sandhil and had enter on a great pebbl
plain that lai between us and the foot of the mountain these look
quiet close but in fact were still far off feebli and ever more feebli
we stagger on meet no on and find no water though here and
there we came across littl bush of which we chew the stringi and
aromat leav that contain some moistur but drew up our mouth and
throat like alum
higg who wa the softest of us gave out the first though to the
last he struggl forward with surpris pluck even after he had been
oblig to throw awai hi rifl becaus he could no longer carri it
though thi we did not notic at the time when he could not support
himself upon hi feet orm took him by on arm and i by the other
and help him on much as i have seen two eleph do by a wound
companion of the herd
halfanhour or so later my strength fail me also although advanc
in year i am tough and accustom to the desert and hardship who
would not be who had been a slave to the khalifa but now i could do no
more and halt beg the other to go on and leav me orm onli
answer wa to proffer me hi left arm i took it for life is sweet
to us all especi when on ha someth to live fora desir
to fulfil as i had though to tell the truth even at the time i felt
asham of myself
thu then we proceed awhil resembl a sober man attempt to
lead two drunken friend out of reach of that stern policeman death
orm strength must be wonder or wa it hi great spirit and hi
tender piti for our helpless which enabl him to endur beneath
thi doubl burden
suddenli he fell down as though he had been shot and lai there
senseless the professor howev retain some portion of hi mind
although it wander he becam lighthead and rambl on about our
mad in have undertaken such a journei just to pot a coupl of
beastli lion and although i did not answer them i agre heartili
with hi remark then he seem to imagin that i wa a clergyman and
kneel on the sand he made a lengthi confess of hi sin which
so far as i gather though i did not pai much attent to them for
i wa think of my own appear chiefli to consist of the unlaw
acquisit of certain object of antiqu or of have overmatch
other in the purchas of such object
to pacifi him for i fear lest he should go rave mad i pronounc
some religi absolut whereon poor higg roll over and lai still
by orm ye he the friend whom i had alwai love for hi veri
fail were endear wa dead or at the point of death like the
gallant young man at hi side and i myself wa dy tremor shook
my limb horribl wave of black seem to well up from my vital
through my breast to my brain and thenc to evapor in queer jag
line and patch which i realiz but could not actual see gai
memori of my faroff childhood aros in me particularli those of a
christma parti where i had met a littl girl dress like an elf
a littl girl with blue ey whom i had love dearli for quit a
fortnight to be beaten down stamp out swallow by that vision
of the immin shadow which await all mankind the black womb of a
rebirth if rebirth there be
what could i do i thought of light a fire at ani rate it would
serv to scare the lion and other wild beast which els might prei
upon us befor we were quit dead it would be dread to lie helpless
but sentient and feel their rend fang but i had no strength to
collect the materi to do so at best must have meant a long walk for
even here it wa not plenti i had a few cartridg leftthre to
be accuratein my repeat rifl the rest i had thrown awai to be rid
of their weight i determin to fire them sinc in my state i thought
thei could no longer serv either to win food or for the purpos of
defenc although as it happen in thi i wa wrong it wa possibl
that even in that endless desert some on might hear the shot and if
notwel goodnight
so i sat up and fire the first cartridg wonder in a childish
fashion where the bullet would fall then i went to sleep for awhil
the howl of a hyena woke me up and on glanc around i saw the
beast flame ey quit close to me i aim and shot at it and
heard a yell of pain that hyena i reflect would want no more food
at present
the silenc of the desert overwhelm me it wa so terribl that i
almost wish the hyena back for compani hold the rifl abov my
head i fire the third cartridg then i took the hand of higg in my
own for after all it wa a linkth last link with human and the
worldand lai down in the compani of death that seem to fall upon me
in black and smother veil
i woke up and becam awar that some on wa pour water down my
throat heaven i thought to myself for at that time heaven and water
were synonym in my mind i drank a good deal of it not all i want
by ani mean but as much as the pourer would allow then rais myself
upon my hand and look the starlight wa extraordinarili clear in
that pure desert atmospher and by it i saw the face of sergeant
quick bend over me also i saw orm sit up stare about him
stupidli while a great yellow dog with a head like a mastiff lick
hi hand i knew the dog at onc it wa that which orm had bought
from some wander nativ and name pharaoh becaus he rule over all
other dog moreov i knew the two camel that stood near by so i wa
still on earthunless inde we had all move on a step
how did you find us sergeant i ask feebli
didnt find you doctor answer quick dog pharaoh found you in a
busi like thi a dog is more us than man for he can smell
what on cant see now if you feel better doctor pleas look at mr
higg for i fear he gone
i look and although i did not sai so wa of the same opinion hi
jaw had fallen and he lai limp and senseless hi ey i could not see
becaus of the black spectacl
water i said and quick pour some into hi mouth where it
vanish
still he did not stir so i open hi garment and felt hi heart
at first i could detect noth then there wa the slightest possibl
flutter
there hope i said in answer to the question look you dont
happen to have ani brandi do you i ad
never travel without it yet doctor repli quick indignantli
produc a metal flask
give him some i said and the sergeant obei with liber and
almost instantan effect for higg sat up gasp and cough
brandi filthi stuff teetotal curs trick never forgiv you
water water he splutter in a thick low voic
we gave it to him and he drank copious until we would let him have
no more inde then by degre hi sens came back to him he thrust
up hi black spectacl which he had worn all thi while and stare at
the sergeant with hi sharp ey
i understand he said so we ar not dead after all which perhap
is a piti after get through the beastli preliminari what ha
happen
dont quit know answer orm ask quick
but the sergeant wa alreadi engag in light a littl fire and
set a campkettl to boil into which he pour a tin of beef
extract that he had brought with other eatabl from our store on the
chanc that he might find us in fifteen minut we were drink soup
for i forbad anyth more solid as yet and oh what a bless meal
wa that when it wa finish quick fetch some blanket from the
camel which he threw over us
lie down and sleep gentlemen he said pharaoh and i will watch
the last thing i rememb wa see the sergeant in hi own fashion an
extrem religi man and not asham of it kneel upon the
sand and appar sai hi prayer as he explain afterward
of cours as a fatalist he knew well that whatev must happen would
happen but still he consid it right and proper to return thank to
the power which had arrang that on thi occas the happen should
be good and not ill a sentiment with which everi on of us agre
opposit to him with on of hi faith ey fix on orm sat
pharaoh in grave contempl doubtless be an eastern dog he
understood the mean of public prayer or perhap he thought that he
should receiv some share of gratitud and thank
when we awok the sun wa alreadi high and to show us that we had
dream no dream there wa quick fry tin bacon over the fire
while pharaoh sat still and watch himor the bacon
look said orm to me point to the mountain thei ar still
mile awai it wa mad to think that we could reach them
i nod then turn to stare at higg who wa just wake up for
inde he wa a sight to see hi fieri red hair wa full of sand hi
nether garment were gone appar at some stage in our march he had
dispens with the remain of them becaus thei chafe hi sore limb
and hi fair skin not exclud that of hi face wa a mass of
blister rais by the sun in fact he wa so disfigur that hi worst
enemi would not have known him he yawn stretch himself alwai a
good sign in man or beast and ask for a bath
i am afraid you will have to wash yourself in sand here sir like them
filthi arabian said quick salut no water to spare for bath in
thi dry countri but iv got a tube of hazelin also a hairbrush and
a lookingglass he ad produc these articl
quit so sergeant said higg as he took them it sacrileg to
think of us water to wash i intend never to wast it in that wai
again then he look at himself in the glass and let it fall upon the
sand ejacul oh good lord is that me
pleas be care sir said the sergeant sternli you told me the
other dai that it unlucki to break a lookingglass also i have no
other
take it awai said the professor i dont want it ani more and
doctor come and oil my face there a good fellow ye and the rest
of me also if there is enough hazelin
so we treat each other with the ointment which at first made us smart
fearfulli and then veri gingerli sat down to breakfast
now sergeant said orm as he finish hi fifth pannikin of tea
tell us your stori
there isnt much of a stori captain those zeu fellow came back
without you and not know the lingo i could make noth of their
tale well i soon made shadrach and co understand that deathwind or
no deathwindthat what thei call itthei must come with me to look
for you and at last we start although thei said that i wa mad
as you were dead alreadi inde it wasnt until i ask that fellow
shadrach if he want to be dead tooand the sergeant tap hi
revolv grimlythat he would let ani on go
as it prove he wa right for we couldnt find you and after awhil
the camel refus to face the storm ani longer also on of the abati
driver wa lost and hasnt been heard of sinc it wa all the rest
of us could do to get back to the oasi aliv nor would shadrach go out
again even after the storm had blown itself awai it wa no us argu
with the pig so as i did not want hi blood upon my hand i took two
camel and start with the dog pharaoh for compani
now thi wa my thought although i could not explain it to the abati
crowd that if you live at all you would almost certainli head for
the hill as i knew you had no compass and you would not be abl to
see anyth els so i rode along the plain which stretch between the
desert and the mountain keep on the edg of the sandhil i rode
all dai but when night came i halt sinc i could see no more there
i sat in that great place think and after an hour or two i observ
pharaoh prick hi ear and look toward the west so i also start
toward the west and present i thought that i saw on faint streak
of light which seem to go upward and therefor couldnt come from a
fall star but might have come from a rifl fire toward the sky
i listen but no sound reach me onli present some second
afterward the dog again prick hi ear as though he heard
someth that settl me and i mount and rode forward through the
night toward the place where i thought i had seen the flash for two
hour i rode fire my revolv from time to time then as no answer
came gave it up as a bad job and stop but pharaoh there wouldnt
stop he began to whine and sniff and run forward and at last bolt
into the dark out of which present i heard him bark some
hundr of yard awai to call me i suppos so i follow and found
you three gentlemen dead as i thought at first that all the stori
captain
on with a good end anywai sergeant we ow our live to you
beg your pardon captain answer quick modestli not to me at all
but to provid first that arrang everyth befor we were born
perhap and next to pharaoh he a wise dog pharaoh though fierc
with some and you did a good deal when you bought him for a bottl of
whiski and a sixpenni pocketknif
it wa dawn on the follow morn befor we sight the oasi
whither we could travel but slowli sinc ow to the lack of camel
two of us must walk of these two as mai be guess the sergeant wa
alwai on and hi master the other for of all the men i ever knew i
think that in such matter orm is the most unselfish noth would
induc him to mount on of the camel even for halfanhour so that
when i walk the brute went riderless on the other hand onc he wa
on notwithstand the agoni he suffer from hi sore noth
would induc higg to get off
here i am and here i stop he said sever time in english french
and sundri orient languag iv tramp it enough to last me the
rest of my life
both of us were doze upon our saddl when suddenli i heard the
sergeant call to the camel to halt and ask what wa the matter
look like arabian doctor he said point to a cloud of dust
advanc toward us
well if so i answer our best chanc is to show no fear and go
on i dont think thei will harm us
so have made readi such weapon as we had we advanc orm and the
sergeant walk between the two camel until present we encount
the other caravan and to our astonish saw none other than
shadrach ride at the head of it mount on my dromedari which hi
own mistress the ladi of the abati had given to me we came face to
face and halt stare at each other
by the beard of aaron is it you lord he ask we thought you
were dead
by the hair of mose so i gather i answer angrili see that
you ar go off with all our belong and i point to the baggag
camel laden with good
then follow explan and volubl apolog which higg for on
accept with a veri bad grace inde as he can talk arab and it
dialect perfectli he made us of that tongu to pour upon the head of
shadrach and hi companion a stream of eastern invect that must have
astonish them abli second as it wa by sergeant quick in english
orm listen for some time then said
thatll do old fellow if you go on you will get up a row and
sergeant be good enough to hold your tongu we have met them so there
is no harm done now friend shadrach turn back with us to the oasi
we ar go to rest there for some dai
shadrach look sulki and said someth about our turn and go on
with them whereon i produc the ancient ring sheba ring which i
had brought as a token from mur thi i held befor hi ey sai
disobei and there will be an account to settl when you come into the
presenc of her who sent you forth for even if we four should dieand
i look at him meaninglythink not that you will be abl to hide thi
matter there ar too mani wit
then without more word he salut the sacr ring and we all went
back to zeu
chapter v
pharaoh make troubl
anoth six week or so had gone by and at length the charact of
the countri began to chang at last we were pass out of the endless
desert over which we had travel for so mani hundr of mile at
least a thousand accord to our observ and reckon which i
check by those that i had taken upon my eastward journei our march
after the great adventur at the oasi wa singularli devoid of
startl event inde it had been aw in it monotoni and yet
oddli enough not without a certain charmat ani rate for higg and
orm to whom the experi wa new
dai by dai to travel on across an endless sea of sand so remot so
unvisit that for whole week no man not even a wander bedouin of
the desert cross our path dai by dai to see the great red sun rise
out of the eastern sand and it journei finish sink into the
western sand night by night to watch the moon the same moon on which
were fix the million ey of citi turn those sand to a silver
sea or in that pure air to observ the constel by which we
steer our path make their majest march through space and yet to
know that thi vast region now so utterli lonesom and desol had
onc been familiar to the feet of longforgotten men who had trod the
sand we walk and dug the well at which we drank
armi had march across these desert also and perish there for
onc we came to a place where a recent fear gale had almost denud
the underli rock and there found the skeleton of thousand upon
thousand of soldier with those of their beast of burden and among
them head of arrow swordblad fragment of armour and of paint
wooden shield
here a whole host had di perhap alexand sent it forth or perhap
some far earlier monarch whose name ha ceas to echo on the earth
at least thei had di for there we saw the memori of that buri
enterpris there lai the king the captain the soldier and the
concubin for i found the femal bone heap apart some with the
long hair still upon the skull show where the poor affright
women had hive togeth in the last catastroph of slaughter or of
famin thirst and driven sand oh if onli those bone could speak
what a tale wa their to tell
there had been citi in thi desert too where onc were oas now
overwhelm except perhap for a sandchok spring twice we came
upon the foundat of such place old wall of clai or stone stark
skeleton of ancient home that the shift sand had disint
which onc had been the theatr of human hope and fear where onc men
had been born love and di where onc maiden had been fair and
good and evil wrestl and littl children plai some job mai have
dwelt here and written hi immort plaint or some king of sodom and
suffer the uttermost calam the world is veri old all we western
learn from the contempl of these wreck of men and of their work
wa just that the world is veri old
on even against the clear sky there appear the dim outlin of
tower cliff shape like a horsesho thei were the mountain of mur
mani mile awai but still the mountain of mur sight at last next
morn we began to descend through wood land toward a wide river that
is i believ a tributari of the nile though upon thi point i have
no certain inform three dai later we reach the bank of thi
river follow some old road and fare sumptuous all the wai
sinc here there wa much game and grass in plenti for the camel that
after their long abstin at until we thought that thei would burst
evid we had not arriv an hour too soon for now the mountain of
mur were hid by cloud and we could see that it wa rain upon the
plain which lai between us and them the wet season wa set in
and had we been a singl week later it might have been imposs for
us to cross the river which would then have been in flood as it wa
we pass it without difficulti by the ancient ford the water never
rise abov the knee of our camel
upon it further bank we took counsel for now we had enter the
territori of the fung and were face to face with the real danger of
our journei fifti mile or so awai rose the fortress of mur but as
i explain to my companion the question wa how to pass those fifti
mile in safeti shadrach wa call to our confer and at my
request set out the fact
yonder he said rose the impregn mountain home of the abati but
all the vast plain includ in the loop of the river which he call
ebur wa the home of the savag fung race whose warrior could be
count by the ten thousand and whose princip citi harmac wa
built opposit to the stone effigi of their idol that wa also call
harmac
harmacthat is harmachi god of dawn your fung had someth to
do with the old egyptian or both of them came from a common stock
interrupt higg triumphantli
i daresai old fellow answer orm i think you told us that befor
in london but we will go into the archolog afterward if we surviv
to do so let shadrach get on with hi tale
thi citi which had quit fifti thousand inhabit continu
shadrach command the mouth of the pass or cleft by which we must
approach mur have probabl been first built there for that veri
purpos
orm ask if there wa no other wai into the stronghold which he
understood the embassi had left by be let down a precipic shadrach
answer that thi wa true but that although the camel and their
load had been let down that precipit place ow to the format
of it overhang rock it would be perfectli imposs to haul them
up it with ani tackl that the abati possess
he ask again if there wa not a wai round if that circl of mountain
had no back door shadrach repli that there wa such a back door
face to the north some eight dai journei awai onli at thi season
of the year it could not be reach sinc beyond the mountain of mur
in that direct wa a great lake out of which flow the river ebur
in two arm that enclos the whole plain of fung by now thi lake
would be full swollen with rain that fell on the hill of northern
africa and the space between it and the mur rang noth but an
impass swamp
be still unsatisfi orm inquir whether if we abandon the
camel we could not then climb the precipic down which the embassi
had descend to thi the answer which i corrobor wa that if
our approach were known and help given to us from abov it might be
possibl provid that we threw awai the load
see what these load ar and the purpos for which we have brought
them so far that is out of the question said orm therefor tell
us at onc shadrach how we ar to win through the fung to mur
in on wai onli o son of orm should it be the will of god that we do
so at all by keep ourselv hidden dure the daytim and march
at night accord to their custom at thi season tomorrow after
sunset the fung hold their great spring feast in the citi of harmac
and at dawn go up to make sacrific to their idol but after sunset
thei eat and drink and ar merri and then it is their habit to withdraw
their guard that thei mai take part in the festiv for thi reason
i have time our march that we should arriv on the night of thi feast
which i know by the ag of the moon when in the dark with god
help perchanc we mai slip past harmac and at the first light find
ourselv in the mouth of the road that run up to mur moreov i will
give warn to my peopl the abati that we ar come so that thei
mai be at hand to help us if there is need
how ask orm
by fire the reedsand he point to the dens mass of dead
veget abouta i arrang that i would do befor we left mur mani
month ago the fung if thei see it will think onli that it is the
work of some wander fisherman
orm shrug hi shoulder sai
well friend shadrach you know the place and these peopl and i do
not so we must do what you tell us but i sai at onc that if as i
understand yonder fung will kill us if thei can to me your plan seem
veri danger
it is danger he answer ad with a sneer but i thought that
you men of england were not coward
coward you son of a dog broke in higg in hi high voic how
dare you talk to us like that you see thi man hereand he point to
sergeant quick who tall and upright stood watch thi scene grimli
and understand most of what passedwel he is the lowest among
usa servant onli here the sergeant salut but i tell you that
there is more courag in hi littl finger than in your whole bodi or
in that of all the abati peopl so far as i can make out
here the sergeant salut again murmur beneath hi breath i
hope so sir be a christian i hope so but till it come to the
stickingpoint on can never be sure
you speak big word o higg answer shadrach insol for as i
think i have said he hate the professor who smelt the rogu in him
and scourg him continu with hi sharp tongu but if the fung get
hold of you then we shall learn the truth
shall i punch hi head sir queri quick in a medit voic
be quiet pleas interrupt orm we have troubl enough befor
us without make more it will be time to settl our quarrel when we
have got through the fung
then he turn to shadrach and said
friend thi is no time for angri word you ar the guid of thi
parti lead us as you will rememb onli that if it come to war i
by the wish of my companion am captain also there is anoth thing
which you should not forgetnam that in the end you must make
answer to your own ruler she who i understand from the doctor here is
call walda nagasta the child of king now no more word we march
as you wish and where you wish on your head be it
the abati heard and bow sullenli then with a look of hate at higg
he turn and went about hi busi
much better to have let me punch hi head soliloqu quick it
would have done him a world of good and perhap save mani troubl
for to tell the truth i dont trust that quarterbr hebrew
then he depart to see to the camel and the gun while the rest of us
went to our tent to get such sleep as the mosquito would allow in
my own case it wa not much sinc the fear of evil to come weigh upon
me although i knew the enorm difficulti of enter the mountain
stronghold of mur by ani other wai such as that by which i had quit
it burden as we were with our long train of camel laden with rifl
ammunit and explos i dread the result of an attempt to pass
through the fung savag
moreov it occur to me that shadrach had insist upon thi
rout from a kind of jealou obstinaci and to be in opposit to us
englishmen whom he hate in hi heart or perhap for some dark and
secret reason still the fact remain that we were in hi power sinc
ow to the circumst in which i had enter and left the place it
wa imposs for me to act as guid to the parti if i attempt to do
so no doubt he and the abati with him would desert leav the camel
and their load upon our hand why should thei not see that
thei would be quit safe in conclud that we should never have an
opportun of lai our side of the case befor their ruler
just as the sun wa set quick came to call me sai that the
camel were be load up
i dont much like the look of thing doctor he said as he help me
to pack my few belong for the fact is i cant trust that shadrach
man hi pal call him cat a good name for him i think also he is
show hi claw just now the truth be that he hate the lot of us
and would like to get back into purr or mur or whatev the name of the
place is have lost us on the road you should have seen the wai he
look at the professor just now oh i wish the captain had let me
punch hi head im sure it would have clear the air a lot
as it chanc shadrach wa destin to get hi head punch after
all but by anoth hand it happen thu the reed were fire as
shadrach had declar it wa necessari to do in order that the abati
watchmen on the distant mountain might see and report the signal
although in the light of subsequ event i am by no mean certain that
thi warn wa not meant for other ey as well then as arrang we
start out leav them burn in a great sheet of flame behind
us and all that night march by the shine of the star along some
brokendown and undoubtedli ancient road
at the first sign of dawn we left thi road and camp amid the
overgrown ruin of a desert town that had been built almost beneath
the precipit cliff of mur fortun without have met ani on or
be challeng i took the first watch while the other turn in to
sleep after we had all breakfast off cold meat for here we dare not
light a fire as the sun grew high dispel the mist i saw that we
were enter upon a thicklypopul countri which wa no stranger to
civil of a sort below us not more than fifteen or sixteen mile
awai and clearli visibl through my fieldglass lai the great town
of harmac which dure my previou visit to thi land i had never
seen as i pass it in the night
it wa a citi of the west central african type with open marketplac
and wide street contain thousand of white flatroof hous the
most import of which were surround by garden round it ran a high
and thick wall built appar of sunburnt brick and in front of
the gatewai of which i could see two stood squar tower whenc these
might be protect all about thi citi the flat and fertil land wa
under cultiv for the season be that of earli spring alreadi
the maiz and other crop show green upon the ground
beyond thi belt of ploughland with the aid of the fieldglass i
could make out great herd of graze cattl and hors mix with wild
game a fact that assur me of the truth of what i had heard dure
my brief visit to mur that the fung had few or no firearm sinc
otherwis the buck and quagga would have kept at a distanc far off
too and even on the horizon i saw what appear to be other town and
villag evid thi wa a veri numer peopl and on which could
not justli be describ as savag no wonder that the littl abati tribe
fear them so intens notwithstand the mighti precipic by which
thei were protect from their hate
about eleven oclock orm came on watch and i turn in have noth
to report soon i wa fast asleep notwithstand the anxieti that
had i been less weari might well have kept me wake for these were
mani on the come night we must slip through the fung and befor
middai on the morrow we should either have enter mur or fail to
have enter mur which meantdeath or what wa wors captiv
among barbarian and subsequ execut preced probabl by tortur
of on sort or anoth
of cours howev we might come thither without accid travel
with good guid on a dark night for after all the place wa big and
the road lone and littl us so that unless we met a watch which
we were told would not be there our littl caravan had a good chanc
to pass unobserv shadrach seem to think that we should do so but
the worst of it wa that like quick i did not trust shadrach even
maqueda the ladi of the abati she whom thei call child of king had
her doubt about him or so it had seem to me
at ani rate she had told me befor i left mur that she chose him for
thi mission becaus he wa bold and cun on of the veri few of her
peopl also who in hi youth had cross the desert and therefor
knew the road yet physician she ad meaningli watch him for
is he not name cat ye watch him for did i not hold hi wife and
children hostag and were i not sure that he desir to win the great
reward in land which i have promis to him i would not trust you to
thi man keep
well after mani experi in hi compani my opinion coincid with
maqueda and so did that of quick no mean judg of men
look at him doctor he said when he came to tell me that i could turn
in for whether it were hi watch or not the sergeant never seem to
be off duti look at him and he point to shadrach who wa seat
under the shade of a tree talk earnestli in whisper with two of hi
subordin with a veri curiou and unpleas smile upon hi face if
god almighti ever made a scamp he squat yonder my belief is that
he want to be rid of us all at zeu so that he might steal our good
and i hope he wont plai the same trick again tonight even the dog
cant abid him
befor i could answer i had proof of thi last statement for the great
yellow hound pharaoh that had found us in the desert hear our
voic emerg from some corner where it wa hidden and advanc
toward us wag it tail as it pass shadrach it stop and
growl the hair rise on it back whereon he hurl a stone at it
and hit it leg next instant pharaoh a beast of enorm power wa on
the top of him and realli i thought about to tear out hi throat
well we got him off befor ani harm wa done but shadrach face
line with it livid scar wa a thing to rememb between rage and
fear it look like that of a devil
to return after thi busi i went to sleep wonder if it were my
last rest upon the earth and whether have endur so much for hi
sake it would or would not be my fortun to see the face of my son
again if inde he still live yonder not a score of mile awayor
anywher
toward even i wa awaken by a fear hubbub in which i
distinguish the shrill voic of higg ejacul languag which i
will not repeat the bai of pharaoh and the smother groan and
curs of an abati run from the littl tent i saw a curiou
sight that of the professor with shadrach head under hi left arm
in chanceri as we us to call it at school while with hi right he
punch the said shadrach nose and counten gener with all hi
strength which i mai add is consider close by hold pharaoh
by the collar which we had manufactur for him out of the skin of a
camel that had di stood sergeant quick a look of grim amus
on hi wooden face while around gesticul after their eastern
fashion and utter guttur sound of wrath were sever of the
abati driver orm wa absent be in fact asleep at the time
what ar you do higg i shout
cantyouse he splutter accompani each word with a blow on
the unfortun shadrach promin nose i am punch thi fellow
beastli head ah youd bite would you then take that and that
andthat lord how hard hi teeth ar well i think he ha had
enough and suddenli he releas the abati who a gori and most
unpleas spectacl fell to the ground and lai there pant hi
companion see their chief melancholi plight advanc upon the
professor in a threaten fashion inde on of them drew a knife
put up that thing sonni said the sergeant or by heaven ill loos
the dog upon you got your revolv handi doctor
evid if the man did not understand quick word their purport
wa clear to him for he sheath hi knife and fell back with the
other shadrach too rose from the ground and went with them at a
distanc of a few yard howev he turn and glare at higg out
of hi swollen ey said
be sure accurs gentil that i will rememb and repai
at thi moment too orm arriv upon the scene yawn
what the deuc is the matter he ask
id give five bob for a pint of ic stone ginger repli higg
inconsequ then he drank off a pannikin of warmish muddycolour
water which quick gave to him and hand it back sai
thank sergeant that better than noth and cold drink is alwai
danger if you ar hot what the matter oh not much shadrach
tri to poison pharaoh that all i wa watch him out of the
corner of my ey and saw him go to the strychnin tin roll a bit of
meat in it which he had first wet and throw it to the poor beast
i got hold of it in time and chuck it over that wall where you will
find it if you care to look i ask shadrach why he had done such a
thing he answer to keep the dog quiet while we ar pass through
the fung ad that anyhow it wa a savag beast and best out of the
wai as it had tri to bite him that morn then i lost my temper and
went for the blackguard and although i gave up box twenti year ago
veri soon had the best of it for as you mai have observ no orient
can fight with hi fist that all give me anoth cup of water
sergeant
i hope it mai be answer orm shrug hi shoulder to tell the
truth old fellow it would have been wiser to defer black shadrach
ey till we were safe in mur but it no us talk now and i
daresai i should have done the same myself if i had seen him try to
poison pharaoh and he pat the head of the great dog of which we
were all exceedingli fond although in realiti it onli care for orm
mere toler the rest of us
doctor he ad perhap you would try to patch up our guid nose
and sooth hi feel you know him better than we do give him a
rifl no dont do that or he might shoot some on in the backbi
accid done on purpos promis him a rifl when we get into mur i
know he want on badli becaus i caught him try to steal a carbin
from the case promis him anyth so long as you can squar it up
so i went take a bottl of arnica and some court plaster with me to
find shadrach surround by sympath and weep with rage over
the insult which he said had been offer to hi ancient and
distinguish race in hi own unworthi person i did my best for him
physic and mental point out as i dab the arnica on
hi sadli disfigur counten that he had brought the troubl on
himself see that he had realli no busi to poison pharaoh becaus
he had tri to bite him he answer that hi reason for wish to
kill the dog wa quit differ and repeat at great length what he
had told the professornam that it might betrai us while we were
pass through the fung also he went on so venom about reveng
that i thought it time to put a stop to the thing
see here shadrach i said unless you unsai those word and make
peac at onc you shall be bound and tri perhap we shall have a
better chanc of pass safe through the fung if we leav you dead
behind us than if you accompani us as a live enemi
on hear thi he chang hi note altogeth sai that he saw
he had been wrong moreov so soon as hi injuri were dress he
sought out higg whose hand he kiss with mani apolog vow that
he had forgotten everyth and that hi heart toward him wa like that
of a twin brother
veri good friend answer higg who never bore malic onli dont
try to poison pharaoh again and for my part ill promis not to
rememb thi matter when we get to mur
quit a convert charact aint he doctor sarcast remark
quick who had been watch thi edifi scene nasti eastern temper
all gone no hebrew talk of ey for ey or tooth for tooth but kiss
the fist that smote him in the best christian spirit all the same i
wouldnt trust the swine further than i could kick him especi in
the dark which he ad meaningli is what it will be tonight
i made no answer to the sergeant for although i agre with him there
wa noth to be done and talk about a bad busi would onli make
it wors
by now the afternoon drew toward nighta veri stormi night to judg
from the gather cloud and rise wind we were to start a littl
after sundown that is within an hour and have made readi my own
baggag and assist higg with hi we went to look for orm and quick
whom we found veri busi in on of the room of an unroof hous to all
appear thei were engag quick in sort pound tin of tobacco
or bakingpowd and orm in test an electr batteri and carefulli
examin coil of insul wire
what your game ask the professor
better than your old boi when satan taught your idl hand to punch
shadrach head but perhap you had better put that pipe out these
azoimid compound ar said to burn rather more safe than coal
still on never know the climat or the journei mai have chang
their constitut
higg retreat hurriedli to a distanc of fifti yard inde whenc
he return have knock out hi pipe and even left hi match on a
stone
dont wast time in ask question said orm as the professor
approach with caution ill explain we ar go on a queer journei
tonightfour white men with about a dozen halfbr mongrel scamp of
doubt loyalti so you see quick and i thought it as well to have some
of thi stuff handi probabl it will never be want and if want we
shall have no time to us it still who know there that will do ten
canist enough to blow up half the fung if thei will kindli sit on
them you take five quick a batteri and three hundr yard of wire
and ill take five a batteri and three hundr yard of wire your
deton ar all fix arent thei well so ar mine and without
more word he proceed to stow awai hi share of the apparatu in the
poacher pocket of hi coat and elsewher while quick did likewis with
what remain then the case that thei had open wa fasten up again
and remov to be laden on a camel
chapter vi
how we escap from harmac
as final arrang thi wa the order of our march first went an abati
guid who wa said to be convers with everi inch of the wai then
came orm and sergeant quick conduct the camel that were load
with the explos i follow in order to keep an ey upon these
preciou beast and those in charg of them next march some more
camel carri our baggag provis and sundri and final in
the rear were the professor and shadrach with two abati
shadrach i should explain had select thi situat for the reason
as he said that if he went first after what had pass ani mistak or
untoward occurr might be set down to hi malic wherea if he were
behind he could not be thu slander on hear thi higg who is
a gener soul insist upon show hi confid in the virtu of
shadrach by accompani him as a rearguard so violent did he insist
and so flatter did shadrach seem to be by thi mark of faith that
orm who i should sai if i have not alreadi done so wa in sole
command of the parti now that hostil were in the air consent to
the plan if with evid reluct
as i know hi own view wa that it would be best for us four englishmen
to remain togeth although if we did so whatev posit we chose
it would be imposs for us in that dark to keep touch with the
line of camel and their load which were almost as import to us as
our live at least have made up our mind to deliv them in mur we
thought that thei were import perhap becaus it is the fashion
of the anglosaxon race to put even a selfcreat idea of duti befor
person safeti or conveni
rightli or wrongli so thing were settl for in such troublou
condit on can onli do what seem best at the moment critic
subsequ to the event is alwai easi as mani an unlucki command ha
found out when the issu went awri but in emerg on must decid on
someth
the sun set the dark fell and it began to rain and blow we
start quit unobserv so far as we could tell and travel
downward from the overgrown ruin town gain the old road and in
complet silenc for the feet of camel make no nois pass along it
toward the light of harmac which now and again when the stormcloud
lift we saw glimmer in front of us and somewhat to our left
in all my long wander i cannot rememb a more excit or a more
disagre journei the black reliev onli from time to time by
distant lightn wa that of the plagu of egypt the drive rain
work through the open of our camelhair cloak and the waterproof
we wore underneath them and wet us through the cold damp wind chill
us to the bone enerv as we were with the heat of the desert
but these discomfort and thei were seriou enough we forgot in the
tremend issu of the enterpris should we win through to mur or as
a crown to our mani labour and suffer should we perish present
on the road that wa the question as i can assur the reader on that
we found veri urgent and interest
three hour had gone by now we were opposit to the light of harmac
also to other light that shone up a vallei in the mountain to our
right as yet everyth wa well for thi we knew by the word
whisper up and down the line
then of a sudden in front of us a light flash although as yet it
wa a long wai off next came anoth whisper messag of halt so we
halt and present on of the front guid crept back inform us
that a bodi of fung cavalri had appear upon the road ahead we took
counsel shadrach arriv from the rear and said that if we wait
awhil thei might go awai as he thought that their presenc must be
accident and connect with the great festiv he implor us to be
quit silent accordingli not know what to do we wait
now i think i have forgotten to sai that the dog pharaoh to prevent
accid occupi a big basket thi basket in which he often rode
when tire be fix upon on side of orm camel here he lai
peaceabl enough until in an unlucki moment shadrach left me to go
forward to talk to the captain whereon smell hi enemi pharaoh
burst out into furiou bai after that everyth wa confus
shadrach dart back toward the rear the light ahead began to move
quickli advanc toward us the front camel left the road as i
presum follow their leader accord to the custom of these beast
when march in line
present i know not how orm quick and myself found ourselv
togeth in the dark at the time we thought higg wa with us also
but in thi we were mistaken we heard shout and strang voic
speak a languag that we could not understand by the sudden glare of
a flash of lightn for the thunderstorm wa now travel over
us we saw sever thing on of these wa the professor
ridingdromedari which could not be mistaken becaus of it pure white
colour and queer method of hold it head to on side pass within
ten yard between us and the road have a man upon it back who
evid wa not the professor then it wa that we discov hi
absenc and fear the worst
a fung ha got hi camel i said
no answer quick shadrach ha got it i saw hi ugli mug against
the light
anoth vision wa that of what appear to be our baggag camel move
swiftli awai from us but off the road which wa occupi by a bodi of
horsemen in white robe orm issu a brief order to the effect that we
were to follow the camel with which the professor might be we start
to obei but befor we had cover twenti yard of the cornfield or
whatev it wa in which we were stand heard voic ahead that were
not those of abati evid the flash which show the fung to us had
done them a like servic and thei were now advanc to kill or captur
us
there wa onli on thing to doturn and flyand thi we did head
whither we knew not but manag to keep touch of each other
about a quarter of an hour later just as we were enter a grove of
palm or other tree which hid everyth in front of us the lightn
blaze again though much more faintli for by thi time the storm had
pass over the mountain of mur leav heavi rain behind it by the
flash i who wa ride last and as it chanc look back over my
shoulder saw that the fung horsemen were not fifti yard behind and
hunt for us everywher their line be extend over a long front
i wa howev sure that thei had not yet caught sight of us in the
dens shadow of the tree
get on i said to the other thei will be here present and heard
quick add
give your camel hi head captain he can see in the dark and perhap
will take us back to the road
orm act on thi suggest which as the black round us wa
pitchi seem a good on at ani rate it answer for off we went at a
fair pace the three camel march in line first over soft ground
and afterward on a road present i thought that the rain had stop
sinc for a few second none fell on us but conclud from the echo of
the camel feet and it recommenc that we had pass under some
archwai on we went and at length even through the gloom and rain i saw
object that look like hous though if so there were no light in
them perhap becaus the night drew toward morn a dread idea
struck me we might be in harmac i pass it up for what it wa worth
veri like whisper orm back perhap these camel were bred
here and ar look for their stabl well there is onli on thing
to dogo on
so we went on for a long while onli interf with by the occasion
attent of some bark dog luckili of these pharaoh in hi basket
took no heed probabl becaus it wa hi habit if anoth dog bark at
him to pretend complet indiffer until it came so near that he
could spring and fight or kill it at length we appear to pass under
anoth archwai after which a hundr and fifti yard or so further
on the camel came to a sudden stop quick dismount and present i
heard him sai
door can feel the brasswork on them tower abov i think and wall
on either side seem to be in a trap best stop here till light come
noth els to be done
accordingli we stop and have ti the camel to each other to
prevent their strai took shelter from the rain under the tower or
whatev it might be to pass awai the time and keep life in us for we
were almost frozen with the wet and cold we at some tin food and
biscuit that we carri in our saddlebag and drank a dram of brandi
from quick flask thi warm us a littl though i do not think that
a bottl would have rais our spirit higg whom we all love wa
gone dead probabl by that time the abati had lost or desert
us and we three white men appear to have wander into a savag
stronghold where as soon as we were seen we should be trap like
bird in a net and butcher at our captor will certainli the
posit wa not cheer
overwhelm with physic and mental miseri i began to doze orm grew
silent and the sergeant have remark that there wa no need to
bother sinc what must be must be consol himself in a corner by
hum over and over again the vers of the hymn which begin
there is a bless home beyond thi land of woe
where trial never come nor tear of sorrow flow
fortun for us shortli befor dawn the tear of sorrow as
repres by the rain ceas to flow the sky clear show the
star suddenli the vault of heaven wa suffus with a wonder and
pearli light although on the earth the mist remain so thick that we
could see noth then abov thi sea of mist rose the great ball of
the sun but still we could see noth that wa more than a few yard
awai from us
there is a bless home beyond thi land of woe
drone quick beneath hi breath for about the fiftieth time sinc
appar he knew no other hymn which he consid suitabl to our
circumst then ejacul suddenli
hullo here a stair with your leav ill go up it captain and he
did
a minut later we heard hi voic call us softli
come here gentlemen he said and see someth worth look at
so we scrambl up the step and as i rather expect found ourselv
upon the top of on of two tower set abov an archwai which tower
were part of a great protect work outsid the southern gate of a
citi that could be none other than harmac soar abov the mist rose
the mighti cliff of mur that almost exactli opposit to us were
pierc by a deep vallei
into thi vallei the sunlight pour reveal a wondrou and
aweinspir object of which the base wa surround by billowi
vapour a huge couchant anim fashion of black stone with a head
carv to the like of that of a lion and crown with the uraeu
the aspcrest symbol of majesti in old egypt how big the creatur
might be it wa imposs to sai at that distanc for we were quit a
mile awai from it but it wa evid that no other monolith
monument that we had ever seen or heard of could approach it coloss
dimens
compar to thi tremend effigi inde the boast sphinx of gizeh
seem but a toi it wa no less than a small mountain of rock shape by
the geniu and patient labour of some depart race of men to the form
of a lionhead monster it majesti and aw set thu abov the
roll mist in the red light of the morn reflect on it from the
tower precipic beyond were liter indescrib even in our
miser state thei oppress and overcam us so that for awhil we
were silent then we spoke each after hi own manner
the idol of the fung said i no wonder that savag should take it
for a god
the greatest monolith in all the world mutter orm and higg is
dead oh if onli he had live to see it he would have gone happi i
wish it had been i who wa taken i wish it had been i and he wrung
hi hand for it is the natur of oliv orm alwai to think of other
befor himself
that what we have come to blow up soliloqu quick well
those azur stingingbe or whatev thei call the stuff he meant
azoimid ar pretti activ but it will take a lot of stir if
ever we get there seem a piti too for the old pussi is handsom in
hi wai
come down said orm we must find out where we ar perhap we can
escap in the mist
on moment i answer do you see that and i point to a
needlelik rock that pierc the fog about a mile to the south of the
idol vallei and sai two mile from where we were that the white
rock it isnt white realli but the vultur roost on it and make it
look so i have never seen it befor for i pass it in the night but
i know that it mark the begin of the cleft which run up to mur
you rememb shadrach told us so well if we can get to that white
rock we have a chanc of life
orm studi it hurriedli and repeat come down we mai be seen up
here
we descend and began our investig in feverish hast thi wa
the sum of them in the arch under the tower were set two great door
cover with plate of copper or bronz beaten into curiou shape to
repres anim and men and appar veri ancient these huge door
had grill in them through which their defend could peep out or
shoot arrow what seem more import to us howev wa that thei
lack lock be secur onli by thick bronz bolt and bar such as
we could undo
let clear out befor the mist lift said orm with luck we mai
get to the pass
we assent and i ran to the camel that lai rest just outsid the
arch befor i reach them howev quick call me back
look through there doctor he said point to on of the
peephol
i did so and in the dens mist saw a bodi of horsemen advanc toward
the door
thei must have seen us on the top of the wall fool that we were to go
there exclaim orm
next instant he start back not a second too soon for through the
hole where hi face had been flash a spear which struck the ground
beyond the archwai also we heard other spear rattl upon the bronz
plate of the door
no luck said orm that all up thei mean to break in now i think
we had better plai a bold game got your rifl sergeant and doctor
ye then choos your loophol aim and empti the magazin into
them dont wast a shot for heaven sake dont wast a shot
nowonetwothre fire
fire we did into the dens mass of men who had dismount and were
run up to the door to burst them open at that distanc we could
scarc miss and the magazin of the repeat rifl held five shot
apiec as the smoke clear awai i count quit halfadozen fung
down while some other were stagger off wound also sever of
the men and hors beyond were struck by the bullet which had pass
through the bodi of the fallen
the effect of thi murder discharg wa instantan and remark
brave though the fung might be thei were quit unaccustom to magazin
rifl live as thei did perfectli isol and surround by a great
river even if thei had heard of such thing and occasion seen an
old gaspip musket that reach them in the cours of trade of modern
gun and their terribl power thei knew noth small blame to them
therefor if their courag evapor in face of a form of sudden
death which to them must have been almost magic at ani rate thei fled
incontin leav their dead and wound on the ground
now again we thought of flight which perhap would have prove our
wisest cours but hesit becaus we could not believ that the fung
had left the road clear or done more than retreat a littl to wait
for us while we lost time thu the mist thin a great deal so much
inde that we could see our exact posit in front of us toward the
citi side lai a wide open space whereof the wall end against
those of harmac itself to which thei form a kind of vestibul or
antechamb set there to protect thi gatewai of the town through which
we had ridden in the dark not know whither we went
those inner door ar open said orm nod hi head toward the
great portal upon the farther side of the squar let go see if we
can shut them otherwis we shant hold thi place long
so we ran across to the further door that were similar to those through
which we had just fire onli larger and as we met nobodi to interfer
with our effort found that the unit strength of the three of us wa
just onli just suffici to turn first on and then the other of
them upon it hing and work the variou bolt and bar into their
respect place two men could never have done the job but be
three and fairli desper we manag it then we retreat to our
archwai and as noth happen took the opportun to eat and drink
a few mouth quick remark sage that we might as well die upon
full as upon empti stomach
when we had cross the squar the fog wa thin rapidli but as the
sun rose suck the vapour from the rainsoak earth it thicken
again for awhil
sergeant said orm present these black men ar bound to attack
us soon now is the time to lai a mine while thei cant see what we ar
after
i wa just think the same thing captain the sooner the better
repli quick perhap the doctor will keep a watch here over the
camel and if he see ani on stick up hi head abov the wall he
might bid him goodmorn we know he is a nice shot is the doctor
and he tap my rifl
i nod and the two of them set out laden with wire and the packag
that look like tobacco tin head for a stone erect in the
centr of the squar which resembl an altar but wa i believ a
rostrum whenc the nativ auction sold slave and other merchandis
what thei did there exactli i am sure i do not know inde i wa too
much occupi in keep a watch upon the wall whereof i could
clearli see the crest abov the mist to pai much attent to their
proceed
present my vigil wa reward for over the great gatewai
opposit at a distanc of about a hundr and fifti pace from me
appear some kind of a chieftain clad in white robe and wear a veri
fine turban or colour headdress who parad up and down wave a
spear defiantli and utter loud shout
thi man i cover veri carefulli ly down to do so as quick had
said i am a good rifl shot have practis that art for mani year
still on mai alwai miss which although i bore no person grudg
against the poor fellow in the fine headdress on thi occas i did
not wish to do the sudden and mysteri death of that savag would i
felt sure produc a great effect among hi peopl
at length he stop exactli over the door and began to execut a kind
of wardanc turn hi head from time to time to yell out someth
to other on the farther side of the wall thi wa my opportun i
cover him with as much care as though i were shoot at a target
with on bull ey to win aim a littl low in case the rifl should
throw high veri gentli i press the trigger the cartridg explod
the bullet went on it wai and the man on the wall stop danc and
shout and stood quit still clearli he had heard the shot or felt
the wind of the ball but wa untouch
i work the lever jerk out the empti case preparatori to fire
again but on look up saw that there wa no need for the fung
captain wa spin round on hi heel like a top three or four time
he whirl thu with incred rapid then suddenli threw hi arm
wide and dive headlong from the wall like a bather from a plank but
backward and wa soon no more onli from the farther side of those
gate aros a wail of wrath and constern
after thi no other fung appear upon the wall so i turn my
attent to the spyhol in the door behind me and see some
horsemen move about at a distanc of four or five hundr yard on a
rocki ridg where the mist did not lie i open fire on them and at the
second shot wa fortun enough to knock a man out of the saddl on
of those with him who must have been a brave fellow instantli jump
down threw him dead or live over the hors leap up behind him
and gallop awai accompani by the other pursu by some probabl
ineffect bullet that i sent after them
now the road to the pass of mur seem to be clear and i regret that
orm and quick were not with me to attempt escap inde i medit
fetch or call them when suddenli i saw them return buri
a wire or wire in the sand as thei came and at the same time heard
a nois of thunder blow of which i could not mistak the mean
evid the fung were break down the farther bronz door with some
kind of batteringram i ran out to meet them and told my new
well done said orm in a quiet voic now sergeant just join up
those wire to the batteri and be care to screw them in tight you
have test it havent you doctor be good enough to unbar the gate
no you cant do that alon ill help you present look to the camel
and tighten the girth these fung will have the door down in a minut
and then there will be no time to lose
what ar you go to do i ask as i obei
show them some firework i hope bring the camel into the archwai
so that thei cant foul the wire with their feet sostand still you
grumbl brute now for these bolt heaven how stiff thei ar i
wonder why the fung dont greas them on door will donev mind the
other
labour furious we got it undon and ajar so far as we could see
there wa no on in sight beyond scare by our bullet or for other
reason of their own the guard there appear to have move awai
shall we take the risk and ride for it i suggest
no answer orm if we do even suppos there ar no fung wait
beyond the rise those insid the town will soon catch us on their swift
hors we must scare them befor we bolt and then those that ar left
of them mai let us alon now listen to me when i give the word you
two take the camel outsid and make them kneel about fifti yard
awai not nearer for i dont know the effect rang of these new
explos it mai be greater than i think i shall wait until the fung
ar well over the mine and then fire it after which i hope to join you
if i dont ride as hard as you can go to that white rock and if you
reach mur give my compliment to the child of king or whatev she is
call and sai that although i have been prevent from wait upon
her sergeant quick understand as much about picrat as i do also
get shadrach tri and hang if he is guilti of higgss death poor old
higg how he would have enjoi thi
beg your pardon captain said quick but ill stai with you the
doctor can see to the baggag anim
will you be good enough to obei order and fall to the rear when you
ar told sergeant now no word it is necessari for the purpos of
thi expedit that on of us two should try to keep a whole skin
then sir plead quick maynt i take charg of the batteri
no he answer sternli ah the door ar down at last and he
point to a hord of fung mount and on foot who pour through the
gatewai where thei had stood shout after their fashion and went on
now then pick out the captain and pepper awai i want to keep them
back a bit so that thei come on in a crowd not scatter
we took up our repeat rifl and did as orm told us and so dens
wa the mass of human opposit that if we miss on man we hit
anoth kill or wound a number of them the result of the loss of
sever of their leader to sai noth of meaner folk wa just
what orm had foreseen the fung soldier instead of rush on
independ spread to right and left until the whole farther side of
the squar fill up with thousand of them a verit sea of men at
which we pelt bullet as boi hurl stone at a wave
at length the pressur of those behind thrust onward those in front
and the whole fierc tumultu mob began to flow forward across the
squar a multitud bent on the destruct of three white men arm
with these new and terribl weapon it wa a veri strang and thrill
sight never have i seen it like
now said orm stop fire and do as i bid you kneel the camel
fifti yard outsid the wall not less and wait till you know the end
if we shouldnt meet again well goodby and good luck
so we went quick liter weep with shame and rage
good lord he exclaim good lord to think that after four
campaign samuel quick sergeant of engin with five medal should
live to be sent off with the baggag like a potbelli bandmast
leav hi captain to fight about three thousand nigger singlehand
doctor if he dont come out you do the best you can for yourself for
im go back to stop with him that all there that fifti pace
down you go you ugli beast and he bump hi camel vicious on the
head with the butt of hi rifl
from where we had halt we could onli see through the archwai into the
space beyond by now the squar look like a great sundai meet in
hyde park be fill up with men of whom the first row were alreadi
past the altarlik rostrum in it centr
why dont he loos off them stingingbe mutter quick oh i see
hi littl game look and he point to the figur of orm who had
crept behind the unopen half of the door on our side of it and wa
look intent round it edg hold the batteri in hi right hand
he want to let them get nearer so as to make a bigger bag he
i heard no more of quick remark for suddenli someth like an
earthquak took place and the whole sky seem to turn to on great
flame i saw a length of the wall of the squar rush outward and upward
i saw the shut half of the bronzepl door skip and hop
playfulli toward us and in front of it the figur of a man then it
began to rain all sort of thing
for instanc stone none of which hit us luckili and other more
unpleas object it is a strang experi to be knock backward
by a dead fist separ from it parent bodi yet on thi occas thi
actual happen to me and what is more the fist had a spear in it
the camel tri to rise and bolt but thei ar phlegmat brute and
as our were tire as well we succeed in quiet them
whilst we were thu occupi somewhat automat for the shock had
daze us the figur that had been propel befor the danc door
arriv reel in a drunken fashion and through the dust and fall
dbri we knew it for that of oliv orm hi face wa blacken hi
cloth were torn half off him and blood from a scalp wound ran down
hi brown hair but in hi right hand he still held the littl electr
batteri and i knew at onc that he had no limb broken
veri success mine he said thickli boer melinit shell arent
in it with thi new compound come on befor the enemi recov from the
shock and he flung himself upon hi camel
in anoth minut we had start at a trot toward the white rock whilst
from the citi of harmac behind us rose a wail of fear and miseri we
gain the top of the rise on which i had shot the horseman and as
i expect found that the fung had post a strong guard in the dip
beyond out of reach of our bullet in order to cut us off should
we attempt to escap now terrifi by what had happen to them
a supernatur catastroph thei were escap themselv for we
perceiv them gallop off to the left and right as fast as their
hors would carri them
so for awhil we went on unmolest though not veri quickli becaus of
orm condit when we had cover about half the distanc between us
and the white rock i look round and becam awar that we were be
pursu by a bodi of cavalri about a hundr strong which i suppos
had emerg from some other gate of the citi
flog the anim i shout to quick or thei will catch us after
all
he did so and we advanc at a shambl gallop the horsemen gain
on us everi moment now i thought that all wa over especi when of
a sudden from behind the white rock emerg a second squad of horsemen
cut off i exclaim
suppos so sir answer quick but these seem a differ crowd
i scan them and saw that he wa right thei were a veri differ
crowd for in front of them float the abati banner which i could not
mistak have studi it when i wa a guest of the tribe a
curiou triangular green flag cover with golden hebrew charact
surround the figur of solomon seat on a throne moreov
immedi behind the banner in the midst of a bodyguard rode a
delic shape woman cloth in pure white it wa the child of king
herself
two more minut and we were among them i halt my camel and look
round to see that the fung cavalri were retreat after the event
of that morn clearli thei had no stomach left for a fight with a
superior forc
the ladi in white rode up to us

tomb of our old king and in the rock of the mountain
who told you that o tongu of barung ask maqueda in a low

admit that the first battl ha gone against harmac thank to the
magic of the white men yet yonder he sit in hi glori as the spirit
hi servant fashion him in the begin and he point with hi
spear toward the vallei of the idol you know our prophecythat until
harmac rise from hi seat and fli awai for where he goe the fung
must followtil then i sai we shall hold the plain and the citi of
hi namethat is for ever

and ad slowli did not certain of the gate of harmac fly far
thi morn now what if your god should follow hi gate and those
worshipp who went with them and be seen no more or what if the
earth should open and swallow him so that he goe down to hell whither
you cannot follow or what if the mountain should fall togeth and
buri him from your sight etern or what if the lightn should
leap out and shatter him to dust
at these omin word the envoi shiver and it seem to me that
their face for a moment turn grei
then o child of king answer the spokesman solemnli the fung

and he wonder how it would end
thi wont do said orm when he understood the thing higg would
never forgiv us if we at dirt just on the offchanc of save him
from sacrific he too straightmind on big thing but of cours
doctor he ad jerkili you have interest of your own and must
decid for yourself i think i can speak for the sergeant

so i told him although to speak the truth i felt like a man with a
knife in hi heart for it wa bitter to come so near to the desir of
year to the love of life and then to lose all hope just becaus of
duti to the head woman of a pack of effet cur to whom on had chanc
to make a promis in order to gain thi veri end if we could have
surrend with honour at least i should have seen my son whom now i
might never see again
on thing howev i ad on the spur of the momentnam a request
that the sultan would tell the professor everi word that had pass in
order that whatev happen to him he might know the exact situat
my harmac said barung when he had heard how disappoint should i
have been with you if you had answer otherwis when a woman show you

it be my lot to cross sword with on of you befor all is done that
shall not be yet for you need rest especi yonder tall son of a god
who is wound and he point to orm child of king with a heart of
king permit me to kiss your hand and to lead you back to your peopl
that i would were more worthi of you ah ye i would that we were
your peopl
maqueda stretch out her hand and take it the sultan bare
touch her finger with hi lip then still hold them he rode
with her toward the pass
as we approach it mouth where the abati were crowd togeth
watch our confer i heard them murmur the sultan the sultan
himself and saw the princ joshua mutter some eager word to the
offic about him
look out doctor said quick into my ear unless im mistook that
porpois is go to plai some game
hardli were the word out of hi mouth when utter the most valiant
shout and with sword drawn joshua and a bodi of hi companion
gallop up and surround our littl group
now yield barung bellow joshua yield or die
the sultan stare at him in astonish then answer
if i had ani weapon he had thrown down hi lanc when he took maqueda
by the hand certainli on of us should die o hog in man cloth
then he turn to maqueda and ad child of king i knew these
peopl of your to be cowardli and treacher but is it thu that you
suffer them to deal with envoi under a flag of peac
not so not so she cri my uncl joshua you disgrac me you
make our peopl a shame a hiss and a reproach stand back let the
sultan of the fung go free
but thei would not the prize wa too great to be readili disgorg
we look at each other not at all the game said orm if thei
collar him we shall be tar with their extrem dirti brush shove
your camel in front sergeant and if that beggar joshua tri ani
trick put a bullet through him
quick did not need to be told twice bang hi dromedari rib with
the butt end of hi rifl he drove it straight on to joshua shout
out of the light porpois with the result that the princ hors
took fright and rear up so high that it rider slid off over it tail
to find himself seat on the ground a sorri spectacl in hi gorgeou
robe and armour
take advantag of the confus which ensu we surround the sultan
and escort him out of the throng back to hi two companion who
see that there wa someth amiss were gallop toward us
i am your debtor said barung but o white men make me more so
return i prai you to that hog in armour and sai that barung sultan
of the fung understand from hi conduct that he desir to challeng
him to singl combat and that see he is fulli arm the sultan
although he wear no mail await him here and now
so i went at onc with the messag but joshua wa far too clever to be
drawn into ani such danger adventur
noth he said would have given him greater joi than to hack the head
from the shoulder of thi dog of a gentil sheik but unhappili ow
to the conduct of on of us foreign he had been thrown from hi
hors and hurt hi back so that he could scarc stand much less
fight a duel
so i return with my answer whereat barung smile and said noth
onli take from hi neck a gold chain which he wore he proffer it
to quick who as he said had induc the princ joshua to show hi
horsemanship if not hi courag then he bow to us on by on and
befor the abati could make up their mind whether to follow him or not
gallop off swiftli with hi companion toward harmac
such wa our introduct to barung sultan of the fung a barbarian
with mani good point among them courag generos and appreci
of those qualiti even in a foe characterist that mai have been
intensifi by the blood of hi mother who i am told wa an arab
of high lineag captur by the fung in war and given as a wife to the
father of barung
chapter viii
the shadow of fate
our ride from the plain up the pass that led to the high tableland of
mur wa long and in it wai wonder enough i doubt whether in the
whole world there exist anoth home of men more marvel defend
by natur appar the road by which we climb wa cut in the first
instanc not by human hand but by the action of primval flood
pour perhap from the huge lake which doubtless onc cover the
whole area within the circl of the mountain although todai it is
but a moderates sheet of water about twenti mile long by ten in
breadth howev thi mai be the old inhabit had work on it the
mark of their tool mai still be seen upon the rock
for the first mile or two the road is broad and the ascent so gentl
that my hors wa abl to gallop up it on that dread night when
after see my son face accid or rather provid enabl me
to escap the fung but from the spot where the lion pull the poor
beast down it charact chang in place it is so narrow that
travel must advanc in singl file between wall of rock hundr
of feet high where the sky abov look like a blue ribbon and even at
middai the path below is plung in gloom at other spot the slope is
so precipit that beast of burden can scarc keep their foothold
inde we were soon oblig to transfer ourselv from the camel to
hors accustom to the rock at other again it follow the brink
of a yawn precipic an ugli place to ride or turn rectangular
corner which halfadozen men could hold against an armi and twice it
pass through tunnel though whether these ar natur i do not know
besid all these obstacl to an invad there were strong gate at
interv with tower near by where guard were station night and
dai and foss or dry moat in front of them which could onli be
cross by mean of drawbridg so the reader will easili understand
how it came about that whatev the cowardic of the abati though thei
strove for gener the fung had as yet never been abl to recaptur
the ancient stronghold which or so it is said in the begin these
abati won from them by mean of an orient trick
here i should add that although there ar two other road to the
plainsthat by which in order to outflank the fung the camel were
let down when i start on my embassi to egypt and that to the north
where the great swamp liethes ar both of them equal if not more
impass at ani rate to an enemi attack from below
a strang cavalcad we must have seem as we crawl up thi terrif
approach first went a bodi of the abati notabl on horseback form
a long line of colour and glitter steel who chatter as thei rode
for thei seem to have no idea of disciplin next came a compani of
horsemen arm with spear or rather two compani in the centr of
which rode the child of king some of her courtier and chief offic
and ourselv perhap as quick suggest becaus infantri in the
event of surpris would find it less easi to run awai than those who
were mount upon hors last of all rode more cavalri the duti
of whose rear file it wa to turn from time to time and after
inspect to shout out that we were not pursu
it cannot be said that we who occupi the centr of the advanc were a
cheer band orm although so far he had born up wa evid veri
ill from the shock of the explos so much so that men had to be set
on each side of him to see that he did not fall from the saddl also
he wa deepli depress by the fact that honour had forc us to abandon
higg to what seem a certain and probabl a cruel death and if he
felt thu what wa my own case who left not onli my friend but also
my son in the hand of savag heathen
maqueda face wa not visibl becaus of the thin spangl veil that
she wore but there wa someth about her attitud suggest of shame
and of despair the droop of the head and even her back show thi as
i who rode a littl behind and on side of her could see i think too
that she wa anxiou about orm for she turn toward him sever time
as though studi hi condit also i am sure that she wa indign
with joshua and other of her offic for when thei spoke to her
she would not answer or take the slightest notic of them beyond
straighten herself in the saddl as for the princ himself hi
temper seem to be much ruffl although appar he had overcom
the hurt to hi back which prevent him from accept the sultan
challeng for at a difficult spot in the road he dismount and ran
along activ enough at ani rate when hi subordin address him
he onli answer them with mutter oath and hi attitud toward us
englishmen especi quick wa not amiabl inde if look could
have kill us i am sure that we should all have been dead befor ever
we reach the gate of mur
thi socal gate wa the upper mouth of the pass whenc first we
saw ly beneath us the vast mountainring plain beyond it wa
a beauti sight in the sunshin almost at our feet halfhidden
in palm and other tree lai the flatroof town itself a place of
consider extent as everi hous of ani consequ seem to be
set in a garden sinc here there wa no need for cramp wall and
defens work beyond it to the northward farther than the ey could
reach stretch down a gentl slope to the faroff shore of the
great lake of glisten water were cultiv field and amongst them
villa and here and there hamlet
whatev might be the fault of the abati evid thei were skill
husbandsmen such as their reput forefath the old inhabit of
juda must have been befor them for of that strain presum some
trace wa still present in their vein howev far he mai have drift
from such pursuit origin the jew wa a tiller of the soil and
here where mani of hi other characterist had evapor under
pressur of circumstancesnot the fierc courag that titu
knewthi tast remain to him if onli by tradit
inde have no other outlet for their energi and none with whom to
trade the interest of the abati were centr in the land for and
by the land thei live and di and sinc the amount avail wa
limit by the mountain wall he who had most land wa great amongst
them he who had littl land wa small he who had no land wa
practic a slave their law wa in it essenti a law of the
land their ambit their crime everyth to do with them were
concern with the land upon the produc of which thei exist and grew
rich some of them by mean of a system of barter thei had no coinag
their monei be measur of corn or other produc hors camel
acr of their equival of soil and so forth
and yet oddli enough their countri is the richest in gold and other
metal that i have ever heard of even in africaso rich that accord
to higg the old egyptian drew bullion from it to the valu of
million of pound everi year thi inde i can well believ for i
have seen the ancient mine which were work for the most part as
open quarri still show plenti of visibl gold on the face of the
slope yet to these alleg jew thi gold wa of no account imagin
it as quick said such a topsyturvi state of thing wa enough to make
a mere christian feel cold down the back and go to bed think that the
world must be come to an end
to return the princ joshua who appear to be generalissimo of the
armi in what wa evid a set phrase exhort the guard at the
last gate to be brave and if need were deal with the heathen as some
on or other dealt with og king of bashan and other unlucki person
of a differ faith in repli he receiv their earnest congratul
upon hi escap from the fright danger of our journei
these formal conclud cast off the iron disciplin of war
we descend a joyou mob or rather the abati did to partak of the
delight of peac realli conqueror return from some desper
adventur could not have been more warmli greet as we enter the
suburb of the town women some of them veri handsom ran out and
embrac their lord or lover hold up babi for them to kiss and
a littl farther on children appear throw rose and pomegran
flower befor their triumphant feet and all thi becaus these gallant
men had ridden to the bottom of a pass and back again
heaven doctor exclaim the sardon quick after take note of
these demonstr heaven what a hero i feel myself to be and
to think that when i got back from the war with them boer after be
left for dead on spion kop with a bullet through my lung and mention
in a dispatchy i sergeant quick mention in a dispatch by the
biggest ass of a gener as ever i clap ey on for a job that
i wont detail no on in my nativ villag ever took no note of
me although i had written to the parish clerk who happen to be my
brotherinlaw and told him the train i wa come by i tell you
doctor no on so much as stood me a pint of beer let alon wine and
he point to a ladi who wa proffer that beverag to some on whom

he indic anoth episod all my old mother saidsh wa aliv
thenwa that she hope id done fool about furrin part as i
call soldier and come home to live respect better late than
never well doctor circumst alter case or blood and climat
do which is the same thing and i didnt miss what i never expect
why should i when other like the captain there who had done so much
more fare wors but lord these abati ar a sicken lot and i
wish we were clear of them old barung the boi for me
pass down the main street of thi charm town of mur accompani
by these joyou demonstr we came at last to it central squar a
larg open space where in the moist and genial climat for the high
surround mountain attract plenti shower of rain tree and
flower grew luxuriantli at the head of thi squar stood a long
low build with whitewash wall and gild dome back by the
tower cliff but at a littl distanc from it and surround by
doubl wall with a moat of water between them dug for purpos of
defenc
thi wa the palac which on my previou visit i had onli enter onc
or twice when i wa receiv by the child of king in formal audienc
round the rest of thi squar each place in it own garden were the
hous of the great nobl and offici and at it western end among
other public build a synagogu or templ which look like a model
of that built by solomon in jerusalem from the descript of which it
had inde been copi though of cours upon a small scale
at the gate of the palac we halt and joshua ride up ask
maqueda sulkili whether he should conduct the gentil for that wa
hi polit descript of us to the lodg for pilgrim in the western

at thi polit mockeri joshua turn perfectli pale with rage like the
turkei cock when hi wattl fade from scarlet into white befor he
could make ani answer howev maqueda had vanish under the archwai
so hi onli resourc wa to curs us and especi quick who had
caus him to fall from hi hors unfortun the sergeant understood
quit enough arab to be awar of the tenor of hi remark which he
resent and return
shut it porpois he said and keep your ey where natur put em

what sai the gentil splutter joshua whereon orm wake up from
on of hi fit of lethargi repli in arab
he sai that he prai you o princ of princ to close your nobl
mouth and to keep your highbr ey within their socket lest you
should lose them at which word those who were listen broke into
a fit of laughter for on redeem characterist among the abati wa
that thei had a sens of humour
after thi i do not quit know what happen for orm show sign of
faint and i had to attend to him when i look round again the
gate were shut and we were be conduct toward the guestw of the
palac by a number of gaili dress attend
thei took us to our roomscool lofti chamber ornament with glaze
tile of quaint colour and beauti design and furnish somewhat
scantili with articl made of richhu wood thi guestw of the
palac where these room were situat form we note a separ
hous have it own gatewai but so far as we could see no passag
or other connect join it to the main build in front of it wa
a small garden and at it back a courtyard with build in which we
were inform our camel had been stabl at the time we note no more
for night wa fall and even if it had not been we were too worn
out to make research
moreov orm wa now desper illso ill that he could scarc
walk lean even on our shoulder still he would not be satisfi
till he wa sure that our store were safe and befor he could be
persuad to lie down insist upon be support to a vault with
copperbound door which the offic open reveal the packag
that had been taken from the camel
count them sergeant he said and quick obei by the light of a lamp
that the offic held at the open door all correct sir he said so
far as i can make out
veri good sergeant lock the door and take the kei
again he obei and when the offic demur to their surrend
turn on him so fierc that the man thought better of it and depart
with a shrug of hi shoulder as i suppos to make report to hi
superior
then at length we got orm to bed and as he complain of intoler
pain in hi head and would take noth but some milk and water have
first ascertain that he had no seriou physic injuri that i could
discov i administ to him a strong sleepingdraught from my littl
travel medicin case to our great relief thi took effect upon him
in about twenti minut caus him to sink into a stupor from which he
did not awak for mani hour
quick and i wash ourselv at some food that wa brought to us and
then took turn to watch orm throughout the night when i wa at my
post about six oclock on the follow morn he woke up and ask for
drink which i gave to him after swallow it he began to wander in
hi mind and on take hi temperatur i found that he had over five
degre of fever the end of it wa that he went off to sleep again
onli wake up from time to time and ask for more drink
twice dure the night and earli morn maqueda sent to inquir as to
hi condit and appar not satisfi with the repli about ten
in the forenoon arriv herself accompani by two waitingladi and a
longbeard old gentleman who i understood wa the court physician
mai i see him she ask anxious
i answer ye if she and those with her were quit quiet then i led
them into the darken room where quick stood like a statu at the head
of the bed onli acknowledg her presenc with a silent salut she
gaze at oliv flush face and the forehead blacken where the
gase from the explos had struck him and as she gaze i saw her
beauti violet ey fill with tear then abruptli she turn and
left the sickchamb outsid it door she wave back her attend
imperi and ask me in a whisper
will he live
i do not know i answer for i thought it best that she should learn
the truth if he is onli suffer from shock fatigu and fever i
think so but if the explos or the blow on hi head where it cut ha
fractur the skull then
save him she mutter i will give you all inai pardon me what
need is there to tempt you hi friend with reward onli save him save
him
i will do what i can ladi but the issu is in other hand than mine
i answer and just then her attend came up and put an end to the
convers
to thi dai the memori of that old rabbi the court physician affect
me like a nightmar for of all the medic fool that ever i met he
wa by far the most preemin all about the place he follow me
suggest remedi that would have been absurd even in the middl ag
the least harm of them i rememb wa that poor orm head should
be plaster with a compound of butter and the bone of a stillborn
child and that he should be given some filthi compound to drink which
had been special bless by the priest other there were also that
would certainli have kill him in halfanhour
well i got rid of him at last for the time and return to my vigil
it wa melancholi work sinc no skill that i had could tell me whether
my patient would live or die nowadai the young men might know or
sai that thei did but it must be rememb that as a doctor i am
entir superannu how could it be otherwis see that i have
pass the best of my life in the desert without ani opportun of
keep up with the time
three dai went by in thi fashion and veri anxiou dai thei were for
my part although i said noth of it to ani on i believ that there
wa some injuri to the patient skull and that he would die or at best
be paralyz quick howev had a differ opinion he said that he
had seen two men in thi state befor from the concuss caus by
the burst of larg shell near to them and that thei both recov
although on of them becam an idiot
but it wa maqueda who first gave me ani definit hope on the third
even she came and sat by orm for awhil her attend stand
at a littl distanc when she left him there wa a new look upon her
facea veri joy lookwhich caus me to ask her what had happen
oh he will live she answer
i inquir what made her think so
thi she repli blush suddenli he look up and in my own
tongu ask me of what colour were my ey i answer that it depend
upon the light in which thei might be seen
not at all he said thei ar alwai violet whether the curtain
is drawn or no now physician adam tell me what is thi colour
violet
that of a littl wild flower which grow in the west in the spring o
maquedaa veri beauti and sweetscent flower which is dark blue
like your ey
inde physician she said well i do not know thi flower but
what of that your friend will live and be sane a dy man doe not
troubl about the colour of a ladi ey and on who is mad doe not
give that colour right
ar you glad o child of king i ask
of cours she answer see that i am told that thi captain
alon can handl the firestuff which you have brought with you and
therefor that it is necessari to me that he should not die
i understand i repli let us prai that we mai keep him aliv but
there ar mani kind of firestuff o maqueda and of on of them
which chanc to give out violet flame i am not sure that my friend is
master yet in thi countri it mai be the most danger of all
now when she heard these word the child of king look me up and down
angrili then suddenli she laugh a littl in a kind of silent wai that
is peculiar to her and without sai anyth beckon to her ladi
and left the place
veri varieg thing woman sir remark quick who wa watch
i think he meant to sai variabl thi on for instanc come up
that passag like a tire horseshuffl shuffl shufflefor i could
hear the heel of her slipper on the floor but now she goe out like
a buck seek it matehead in air and hoof lift how do you explain

soup she brought him
everi drop sir and tri to kiss her hand afterward be still
daze poor man poor man i saw him do it know no better hell be
sorri enough when he come to himself
no doubt sergeant but meanwhil let us be glad that both their

invalid and women
ye doctor but he ad with a sudden fall of face invalid
recov sometim and then how about the women
suffici to the dai is the evil thereof i answer you had better
go out for exercis it is my watch but to myself i thought that fate

maqueda violet ey
well to cut a long stori short thi wa the turningpoint of orm
ill and from that dai he recov rapidli for as it prove
there wa no secret injuri to the skull and he wa suffer from
noth except shock and fever dure hi convalesc the child of
king came to see him sever time or to be accur if my memori

chapter ix
the swear of the oath
two or three dai after thi convers i forget exactli which it
wa maqueda held her council in the great hall of the palac when we
enter the place in charg of a guard as though we were prison we
found some hundr of abati gather there who were seat in orderli
row upon bench at the farther end in an apseshap space sat the
child of king herself on a gild or perhap a golden chair of which
the arm termin in lion head she wa dress in a robe of
glitter silver and wore a ceremoni veil embroid with star
also of silver and abov it set upon her dark hair a littl circlet
of gold in which shone a singl gem that look like a rubi thu
attir although her statur is small her appear wa veri
dignifi and beauti especi as the gossam veil ad mysteri
to her face
behind the throne stood soldier arm with spear and sword and at
it side and in front of it were gather her court to the number of a
hundr or more includ her waitingladi who in two compani were

them in their normanlik chain armour there were judg in black robe
and priest in gorgeou garment there were territori lord of

call marketmast whose busi it wa to regul the rate of
exchang of product and with them the repres of other trade
in short here wa collect all the aristocraci of the littl
popul of the town and territori of mur everi on of whom as we
found afterward possess some highsound titl answer to
those of our duke and lord and right honour and knight to sai
noth of the princ of the blood of whom joshua wa the first
realli although it look so fine and gai the spectacl wa in a
sens piteou be evid but a poor mockeri and surviv of the
pageantri of a peopl that had onc been great the vast hall in which
thei were assembl show thi sinc although the occas wa on
that excit public interest it wa after all but a quarter fill by
those who had a right to be present
with much digniti and to the sound of music we were march up the broad
nave if i mai describ it thu for the build with it aps and
support cedar column bore some resembl to a cathedr till
we reach the open space in front of the throne where our guard
prostrat themselv in their eastern fashion and we salut it
occup in our own then chair have been given to us after a paus
a trumpet blew and from a side chamber wa produc our late guid
shadrach heavili manacl and look extrem frighten
the trial that follow i need not describ at length it took a long
while and the three of us were call upon to give evid as to the
quarrel between our companion the professor and the prison about the
dog pharaoh and other matter the testimoni howev that proclaim
the guilt of shadrach wa that of hi companion guid who it
appear had been threaten with flog unless thei told the truth
these men swore on after the other that the abandon of higg had
been a preconceiv plan sever of them ad that shadrach wa in
traitor commun with the fung whom he had warn of our advent
by fire the reed and had even contriv to arrang that we were to
be taken while he and the other abati with the camel laden with our
rifl and good which thei hope to steal pass through in safeti
in defenc shadrach boldli deni the whole stori and especi that
he had push the gentil higg off hi dromedari as wa alleg

further hi possess were to be forfeit to the state and hi wife
and children and household to becom public slave which meant that the
male would be condemn to serv as soldier and the femal allot
to certain offici in the order of their rank
sever of those who had conspir with him to betrai us to the fung
were also depriv of their possess and condemn to the armi which
wa their form of penal servitud
thu amidst a mighti wail of those concern and of their friend
and rel end thi remark trial of which i give some account
becaus it throw light upon the social condit of abati what hope
is there for a peopl when it crimin ar sent not to jail but to
serv as soldier and their womenfolk howev innoc ar doom
to becom the slave of the judg or whoever these mai appoint be it
ad howev that in thi instanc shadrach and hi friend deserv
all thei got sinc even allow for a certain amount of fals
evid undoubtedli for the purpos of robberi and privat hate
thei did betrai those whom their ruler had sent them to guid and
protect
when thi trial wa finish and shadrach had been remov howl for
merci and attempt to kiss our feet like the cur he wa the audienc
who had collect to hear it and to see us the gentil stranger
dispers and the member of the privi council if i mai call it so
were summon by name to attend to their duti when all had gather
we three were request to advanc and take seat which had been place
for us among the councillor
then came a paus and as i had been instruct that i should do i
advanc and laid sheba ring upon a cushion held by on of the court
offic who carri it to maqueda
child of king i said take back thi ancient token which you lent
to me to be a proof of your good faith and mine know that by mean of
it i persuad our brother who is captiv a man learn in all that
ha to do with the past to undertak thi mission and through him the
captain orm who stand befor you and hi servant the soldier
she took it and after examin show it to sever of the priest
by whom it wa identifi
though i part from it with fear and doubt the holi ring ha serv
it purpos well she said and i thank you physician for return
it to my peopl and to me in safeti
then she replac it on the finger from which it had been withdrawn when
she gave it to me mani month befor
there then that matter end
now an offic cri
walda nagasta speak whereon everi on repeat walda nagasta
speak and wa silent
then maqueda began to address us in her soft and pleasant voic
stranger from the western countri call england she said be
pleas to hear me you know our case with the fungthat thei surround
us and would destroi us you know that in our extrem i took advantag
of the wander hither of on of you a year ago to beg him to go to hi
own land and there obtain firestuff and those who understand them with
which to destroi the great and ancient idol of the fung for that peopl
declar that if thi idol is destroi thei will leav the land thei
dwell in for anoth such be their ancient propheci
pardon o child of king interrupt orm but you will rememb
that onli the other dai barung sultan of the fung said that in thi
event hi nation would still live on to aveng their god harmac also
he said that of all the abati he would leav you aliv alon
now at these illomen word a shiver and a murmur went through the
council but maqueda onli shrug her shoulder caus the silver
trim on her dress to tinkl
i have told you the ancient propheci she answer and for the rest
word ar not deed if the foul fiend harmac goe i think that
the fung will follow him otherwis why do thei make sacrific to
earthquak as the evil god thei have to fear and when some five
centuri ago such an earthquak shook down part of the secret citi in
the bowel of the mountain that i will show to you afterward why did
thei fly from mur and take up their abod in the plain as thei said to
protect the god
i do not know answer oliv if our brother were here he whom
the fung have captur he might know be learn in the wai of
idolworship savag peopl
ala o son of orm she said thank to that traitor whom but now we
have condemn he is not here and perhap could tell us noth if
he were at least the sai run as i have spoken it and for mani
gener becaus of it we abati have desir to destroi the idol of
the fung to which so mani of us have been offer in sacrific through
the jaw of their sacr lion now i ask and she lean forward
look at oliv will you do thi for me
speak of the reward my niec broke in joshua in hi thick voic
when he saw that we hesit what to answer i have heard that these
western gentil ar a veri greedi peopl who live and die for the gold
which we despis
ask him captain exclaim quick if thei despis land also sinc
yesterdai afternoon i saw on of them try to cut the throat of anoth
over a piec not bigger than a larg dogkennel
ye i ad for i confess that joshua remark nettl me and ask
him whether the jew did not despoil the egyptian of their ornament
of gold in the old dai and whether solomon whom he claim as a
forefath did not trade in gold to ophir and lastli whether he know
that most of hi kindr in other land make a veri god of gold
so orm as our spokesman put these question with great gusto to
joshua whom he dislik intens whereat some of the council those
who were not of the parti of the princ smile or even laugh and the
silveri ornament upon maqueda dress began to shake again as though
she also were laugh behind her veil still she did not seem to think
it wise to allow joshua to answerif he couldbut did so herself
sai
the truth is o my friend that here we set small store by gold
becaus be shut in and unabl to trade it is of no us to us save
as an ornament were it otherwis doubtless we should valu it as much
as the rest of the world jew or gentil and shall do so when we ar
freed from our foe who hem us in therefor my uncl is wrong to claim
as a virtu that which is onli a necess especi when as your
servant sai and she point to the sergeant our peopl make land
their gold and will spend their live in gain more of it even when
thei have enough
then do the gentil seek no reward for their servic sneer
joshua
by no mean princ answer oliv we ar soldier of fortun
sinc otherwis why should we have come here to fight your quarrel
lai an unpleas emphasi on the your against a chief who
if half savag to us seem to have some merit those of honour and
courag for instanc if we risk our live and do our work we ar not
too proud to take whatev we can earn why should we be see that
some of us need wealth and that our brother who is as good as dead
yonder ow to the treacheri of those who were sent to guard him
ha rel in england who ar poor and should be compens for hi
loss
why inde ejacul maqueda listen now my friend in my
own name and in that of the abati peopl i promis to you as mani
camelload of thi gold as you can carri awai from mur and befor the
dai is done i will show it to you if you dare follow me to where it li
hid
first the work then the pai said oliv now tell us child of
king what is that work
thi o son of orm you must swearif thi is not against your
conscienc as christiansthat for the space of on year from todai
you will serv me and fight for me and be subject to my law strive
all the while to destroi the idol harmac by your western skill and
weapon after which you shall be free to go whither you will with your
reward
and if we swear ladi ask oliv after reflect tell us what
rank shall we hold in your servic
you shall be my chief captain for thi enterpris o son of orm
and those with you shall serv under you in such posit as you mai
pleas
at these word a murmur of dissatisfact aros from the mailclad
gener in the council
ar we then to obei thi stranger o child of king queri joshua
as their spokesman
ay my uncl so far as thi great enterpris is concern as i have
said can you handl the firestuff of which thei alon have the secret
could ani three of you have held the gate of harmac against the armi
of the fung and sent it fly skyward
she paus and wait in the midst of a sullen silenc
you do not answer becaus you cannot continu maqueda then for
thi purpos be content to serv awhil under the command of those who
have the skill and power which you lack
still there wa no answer
ladi said orm in thi omin quiet you ar so good as to make me
a gener among your soldier but will thei obei me and who ar your
soldier doe everi man of the abati bear arm
ala no she repli fix upon thi latter question perhap
becaus she could not answer the first ala no in the old dai it
wa otherwis when my great ancestress rule and then we did not
fear the fung but now the peopl will not serv as soldier thei sai
it take them from their trade and the game thei love thei sai thei
cannot give the time in youth thei sai that it degrad a man to obei
the order of those set over him thei sai that war is barbar and
should be abolish and all the while the brave fung wait without to
massacr our men and make our women slave onli the veri poor and the
desper and those who have offend against the law will serv in my
armi except it be as offic oh and therefor ar the abati doom
and throw back her veil suddenli she burst into tear befor us
all
i do not know that i ever rememb see a sight more pathet in it
wai than that of thi beauti and highspirit young woman weep
in the presenc of her council over the utter degeneraci of the race
she wa call upon to rule be old and accustom to these eastern
express of emot i remain silent howev but oliv wa so
deepli affect that i fear lest he should do someth foolish he
went red he went white and wa rise from hi seat to go to her had
i not caught him by the arm and pull him back as for quick he turn
hi ey to the ceil as though engag in prayer and i heard him
mutter
the lord help the poor thing the lord help her the on pearl in the
snout of all these gild swine well i understand i am a bit of a
gener now and if i dont make em sit up for her sake my name aint
samuel quick
meanwhil there wa much constern and indign murmur
amongst the court which felt that reflect had been thrown upon it
collect and individu at such a crisi as usual princ joshua
took the lead rise from hi seat he knelt not without difficulti
befor the throne and said
o child of king why do you distress us with such word have you not
the god of solomon to protect you
god protect those who protect themselv sob maqueda
and have you not mani brave offic
what ar offic without an armi
and have you not me your uncl your affianc your lover and he
laid hi hand where he conceiv hi heart to be and stare up at her
with hi roll fishlik ey had it not been for the interfer
of these gentil in whom you seem to put such trust he went on
should i not have taken barung captiv the other dai and left the fung
without a head
and the abati without such shred of honour as still belong to them my
uncl
let us be wed o bud of the rose o flower of mur and soon i will free
you from the fung we ar helpless becaus we ar separ but togeth
we shall triumph sai o maqueda when shall we be wed
when the idol harmac is utterli destroi and the fung have depart
for ever my uncl she answer impati but is thi a time to
talk of marriag i declar the council close let the priest bring
the roll that these stranger from the west mai take the oath and then
pardon me if i leav you
now from behind the throne there appear a gorgeou gentleman arrai
in a headdress that remind me faintli of a bishop mitr and
wear over hi robe a breastplat of preciou stone roughli
polish which wa half hidden by a veri long white beard
thi person who it seem wa the high priest carri in hi hand
a doubl roll of parchment written over with charact which we
afterward discov were bastard hebrew veri ancient and onli
decipher by three or four of the abati if inde ani of them could
realli read it at least it wa said to be the roll of the law brought
by their forefath centuri ago from abyssinia togeth with sheba
ring and a few other relic among them the cradl a palpabl forgeri
in which the child of solomon and maqueda or belchi the first known
queen of sheba wa tradition report to have been rock thi
roll of the law which for gener had been us at all import
ceremoni among the abati such as the swearingin of their queen and
chief offic wa now tender to us to hold and kiss while we took
the oath of obedi and allegi in the name of jehovah and of
solomon a strang mixtur it struck us solemnli vow to perform
those thing which i have alreadi set out
thi seem a pretti wide promis said oliv after it had been read
to us and translat by me to quick do you think that we ought to take
it on
i answer ye that wa from my point of view sinc otherwis i saw
no chanc of achiev the object that had caus me to enter upon thi
adventur then be especi request to do so the sergeant
after reflect awhil gave hi consid opinion
sir he said to orm we ar three white men here consort with a
mob of quarterbr african jew and on real ladi it seem to me that
we had best swear anyth thei want us to trust to the ladi to see
us through the mess sinc otherwis we shall be mere filibust in the
countri without offici rank and liabl therefor to be shot on sight
by the enemi or ani mutin who get the upper hand here also we
have the professor and the doctor son to think of therefor i sai
swear to anyth in reason reserv allegi to the crown of great
britain and trust to luck you see captain we ar in their power
anywai and thi oath mai help but cant hurt us while to refus it
must give offenc to all these skunk and perhap to the ladi also
which is of more consequ
i think you ar probabl right sergeant said orm anywai in for a
penni in for a pound
then he turn to maqueda who had been watch thi confer in an
unknown tongu with some anxieti or so it seem to me and ad in
arab o child of king we will take your oath although it is wide
trust to your honour to protect us from ani pitfal which it mai
cover for we would ask you to rememb that we ar stranger in your
land who do not understand it law and custom onli we stipul
that we retain our allegi to our own ruler far awai remain the
subject of that monarch with all right thereto appertain also
we stipul that befor we enter on our duti or at ani rate dure
those duti we shall be at full liberti to attempt the rescu of our
friend and companion now a prison in the hand of the fung and of
the son of on of us who is believ to be a slave to them and that
we shall have all the assist which you can give us in thi matter
moreov we demand that if we should be tri for ani offenc under
thi oath you to whom we swear allegi shall be our judg alon
none other intermeddl in the trial if you accept these term
we will swear the oath otherwis we swear noth but will act as
occas mai aris
now we were request to stand back while the child of king consult
with her advis which she did for a consider time sinc
evid the question rais involv differ of opinion in the
end howev she and those who support her seem to overrul the
objector and we were call up and told that our term had been
accept and engross upon the form of the oath and that everyth
there includ would be faithfulli observ by the ruler and council of
the abati
so we sign and swore kiss the book or rather the roll in the
civil fashion afterward veri tire for all thi busi had
been anxiou we were conduct back to our own quarter to lunch or
rather to dine for the abati at their heaviest meal at middai take
a siesta after it accord to the common eastern custom
about four oclock of that afternoon i wa awaken from my nap by the
growl of pharaoh and look up to see a man crouch against the
door evid in fear of the dog fang he prove to be a messeng
from maqueda sent to ask us if we care to accompani her to a place
that we had never seen of cours we answer ye and were at onc
led by the messeng to a disus and dusti hall at the back of the
palac where present maqueda and three of her ladi join us and
with them a number of men who carri light lamp gourd of oil and
bundl of torch
doubtless friend said maqueda who wa unveil and appear to
have quit recov from our outburst of the morn you have seen
mani wonder place in thi africa and other land but now i am about
to show you on that i think is stranger than them all
follow her we came to a door at the end of the hall which the men
unbolt and shut again behind us and thenc pass into a long passag
cut in the rock that slope continu downward and at length led
through anoth doorwai to the vastest cave that we had ever heard of or
seen so vast wa it inde that the feebl light of our lamp did not
suffic to reach the roof and onli dimli show to right and left the
outlin of what appear to be shatter build of rock
behold the cave citi of mur said maqueda wave the lamp she
held here it wa that the ancient whom we believ to have been the
forefath of the fung had their secret stronghold these wall were
those of their granari templ and place of ceremoni but as i
have told you centuri ago an earthquak shatter them leav them
as thei ar now also it broke down much of the cave itself caus
the roof to fall so that there ar mani part where it is not safe to
enter come now and see what is left
we follow her into the depth of the wonder place our lantern and
torch make littl star of light in that great black we saw the
ruin of granari still fill with the dust of what i suppos had onc
been corn and came at length to a huge roofless build of which
the area wa strewn with shatter column and among them overgrown
statu cover so thick by dust that we could onli discov that most
of them seem to be shape like sphinx
if onli higg were here said oliv with a sigh and pass on to
maqueda who wa call him to look at someth els
leav the templ in which it wa unsaf to walk she led us to where
a strong spring the water suppli of the place bubbl up into a rock
basin and overflow thenc through prepar open ran awai we
knew not whither
look thi fountain is veri ancient said maqueda point to the
lip of the basin that wa worn awai to the depth of sever inch where
those who drew water had for mani gener rest their hand upon
the hard rock
how did thei light so vast a cavern ask oliv
we do not know she answer sinc lamp would scarc have serv
them it is a secret of the past which none of the abati have care to
recov and anoth is how the air is alwai kept fresh so deep in
the bowel of the mountain we cannot even sai whether thi place is
natur as i think or hollow out by men
both i expect i answer but tell me ladi do the abati make ani
us of thi great cave
some corn is still store here in pit in case of sieg she repli
ad sadli but it is not enough to be of real servic sinc almost
all of it come from the estat of the child of king in vain have
i prai the peopl to contribut if onli a hundredth part of their
harvest but thei will not each sai that he would give if hi
neighbour gave and so none give and yet a dai mai come when a store
of corn alon would stand between them and death by hungerif the fung
held the vallei for instanc and she turn impati and walk
forward to show us the stabl where the ancient kept their hors and
the mark of their chariot wheel in the stone floor
nice peopl the abati sir said quick to me if it werent for
the women and children and abov all for thi littl ladi whom i am
begin to worship like my master as in duti bound id like to see
them do a bit of hunger
there is on more place to show you said maqueda when we had
inspect the stabl and argu as to what possibl caus could have
induc the ancient to keep hors underground which perhap you will
think worth a visit sinc it hold the treasur that ar or shall be
your come
we start forward again along variou passag the last of which
suddenli widen into a broad and steep inclin of rock which we
follow for quit fifti pace till it end in what seem to be a
blank wall here maqueda bade her ladi and attend halt which
inde thei seem veri anxiou to do though at the moment we did not
know why then she went to on end of the wall where it join that of
the passag and show us some loos stone ask me to pull them
out which i did not without difficulti when an apertur had been made
larg enough for a man to creep through she turn to her peopl and
said
you i know believ thi place to be haunt nor would the bravest of
you enter it save by express command but i and these stranger have no
such fear therefor give us a gourd of oil and some torch and bide
where you ar till we return set a lamp in the hole in the wall to
guid us in case our own should becom extinguish no do not reason
but obei there is no danger for though hot the air within is pure as
i know who have breath it more than onc
then she gave her hand to oliv and with hi assist crept through
the hole we follow to find ourselv in anoth cavern where as
she had said the temperatur wa much hotter than that without
what is thi place ask orm in a low voic for it aspect seem
to aw him
the tomb of the old king of mur she repli present you shall
see and onc more she took hi hand for the slope wa sharp and
slipperi
on we went alwai descend for perhap four hundr yard our
footfal echo loudli in the intens silenc and our lamp round
which the bat circl in hundr make four star of light in
the utter black till at length the passag widen out into what
appear to be a vast circular arena with a lofti domelik roof of
rock maqueda turn to the right and halt befor some object that
glimmer white held up her light sai look
thi wa what we saw a great stone chair and pile upon it seat
and upon it base human bone amongst these wa a skull and on it
grotesqu tilt a crown of gold while other ornamentssceptr
ring necklac weapon and armourwer mingl with the bone nor
wa thi all for in a wide circl round the chair were other skeleton
fifti or more of them and amongst them the ornament that their owner
had worn
also in front of each stood a trai of some metal which we afterward
discov to be silver or copper and heap upon it everi kind of
valuabl such as golden cup and vase toilet utensil necklac
pector bracelet leglet ear and bead that seem to be cut
from preciou stone pile of ring monei and a hundr other thing
such as have been prize by mankind sinc the begin of civil
you understand said maqueda as we stare openmouth at thi aw
and marvel sight he in the chair wa the king those about him
were hi offic guard and women when he wa buri thei brought
hi household here bear hi wealth sat them down about him and
kill them blow awai the dust and you will see that the rock beneath
is still stain with their blood also there ar the swordmark on
their skull and neckbon
quick who wa of an inquir mind step forward and verifi these
statement
golli he said throw down the skull of a man over whom the tire
execution had evid bungl badli im glad i didnt serv the
old king of mur but the same game goe on in a small wai todai in
africa for when i wa campaign on the west coast i came across
it not a fortnight old onli there thei had buri the poor beggar
live
perhap said maqueda when the sergeant remark had been translat
to her yet i do not think the custom is on that my peopl would
love and she laugh a littl then ad forward friend there
ar mani more of these king and oil doe not burn for ever
so we move on and at a distanc of some twenti pace found anoth
chair with scatter bone on and about the seat ly where each
had fallen as the dead man decai round it were the skeleton of the
unfortun who had been doom to accompani him upon hi last journei
everi on of them behind hi trai of golden object or of simpl
treasur in front of thi king chair also were the bone of a dog
with a jewel collar
again we proceed to a third mortuari if it mai so be call and here
maqueda point out the skeleton of a man in front of which stood a
trai pile up with what evid had been the medicin bottl of the
period and among them a number of rude surgic instrument
sai o physician adam she remark with a smile would you have
wish to be court doctor to the king of mur if inde that wa then
their citi name
no ladi i answer but i do wish to examin hi instrument if
i have your leav and while she hurri forward i stoop down and
fill my pocket here i mai remark that upon subsequ inspect
i found among these instrument manufactur i know not what number of
thousand of year agofor on that point controversi rage among the
learnedmani that with modif ar still in us todai
of that strang and dread sepulchr there is littl more to tell
from monarch to monarch we march on till at length we grew weari of
stare at bone and gold even quick grew weari who had pass hi
earli youth in assist hi father the parish sexton and therefor
like myself regard these relic with profession interest though of
a differ degre at ani rate he remark that thi famili vault wa
uncommonli hot and perhap if it pleas her majesti as he call
maqueda we might take the rest of the deceas gentlemen as read like
a recruit attest question
but just then we came to no 25 accord to my count and were
oblig to stop to wonder for clearli thi king had been the greatest
of them all sinc round him lai about two or three time the averag
number of dead and an enorm quantiti of wealth some of it in the
form of littl statu of men and women or perhap of god yet oddli
enough he wa hunchback with a huge skull almost a monstros inde
perhap hi mind partook of the abnorm qualiti of hi bodi sinc no
less than eleven littl children had been sacrif at hi obsequi
two of whom judg from their crook bone must have been hi own
on wonder what chanc in mur and the surround territori which
then acknowledg it swai when king hunchback rule ala histori
write no record
chapter x
quick light a match
here we begin to turn for thi cave is a great circl said maqueda
over her shoulder
but oliv whom she address had left her side and wa engag
in take observ behind the hunchback funer chair with an
instrument which he had produc from hi pocket
she follow him and ask curious what thi thing might be and why
he made us of it here
we call it a compass he answer and it tell me that beyond us
li the east where the sun rise also it show at what height we
stand abov the sea that great water which you have never seen o child
of king sai now if we could walk through thi rock what should we
find out yonder
the lionhead idol of the fung i have been told she answer
that which you saw befor you blew up the gate of the citi harmac but
how far off it mai be i do not know for i cannot see through stone
friend adam help me to refil the lamp for thei burn low and all
these dead would be ill compani in the dark so at least my peopl
think sinc there is not on of them that dare to enter thi place
when first we found it onli a few year ago and saw the compani it held
thei fled and left me to search it alon look yonder ar my footstep
in the dust
so i refil the shallow handlamp and while i did so orm took
some hasti observ of which he jot down the result in hi
pocketbook
what have you learn she ask when at last he rejoin us somewhat
unwillingli for she had been call to him to come
not so much as i should have done if you could have given me more
time he repli ad in explan ladi i wa brought up as
an engin that is on who execut work and to do so take
measur and make calcul for instanc those dead men who
hollow or dress these cave must have been engin and no mean
on
we have such among us now she said thei rais dam and make drain
and hous though not so good as those which were built of old but
again i askwhat have you learn o wise engin
onli that here we stand not so veri far abov the citi harmac of which
i chanc to take the level and that behind yonder chair there wa
i think onc a passag which ha been built up but be pleas to sai
noth of the matter ladi and to ask me no more question at present
as i cannot answer them with certainti
i see that you ar discreet as well as wise she repli with some
sarcasm well sinc i mai not be trust with your counsel keep it to
yourself
oliv bow and obei thi curt instruct
then we began our return journei pass mani more group of skeleton
which now we scarc troubl to look at perhap becaus the heavi air
fill with dust that onc had been the flesh of men wa tell on
our energi onli i notic or rather the observ quick call my
attent to the fact that as we went the king in their chair
were surround by fewer and fewer attend and women and that the
offer place at their feet were of an everlessen valu inde
after we had pass anoth five or six of them their murder retinu
dwindl to a few femal skeleton doubtless those of favourit wive
who had been singl out for thi particular honour
at length there were none at all the poor monarch who now were
crowd close togeth be left to explor the shade alon adorn
mere with their own jewelleri and regalia ultim even these were
replac by funer goldfoil ornament and the trai of treasur by
earthenwar jar which appear to have contain noth but food and
wine and ad to these a few spear and other weapon the last of
the occupi chair for there were empti on beyond contain bone
which from their slender and the small size of the bracelet among
them i saw at onc had belong to a woman who had been sent to the
grave without companion or ani offer at all
doubtless said maqueda when i point thi out to her at that time
the ancient had grown weak and poor sinc after so mani king thei
permit a woman to rule over them and had no wealth to wast upon her
burial that mai have been after the earthquak when onli a few peopl
were left in mur befor the abati took possess of it
where then ar those of your own hous buri ask oliv stare
at the empti chair
oh not in thi place she answer i have told you it wa
discov but a few year ago we rest in tomb outsid and for my
part i will sleep in the simpl earth so that i mai live on in grass
and flower if in no other wai but enough of death and doom soon
who can tell how soon we shall be as these ar and she shudder
meanwhil we breath so let us make the best of breath you have seen
your fee sai doe it content you
what fee he ask death the reward of life how can i tell until i
have pass it gate
here thi philosoph discuss wa interrupt by the sudden deceas
of quick lamp
thought there wa someth wrong with the bloom thing said the
sergeant but couldnt turn it up as it hasnt got a screw without
which these oldfashion colza oil never were no good hullo doctor
there goe your and as he spoke go it did
the wick exclaim maqueda we forgot to bring new wick and
without them of what us is oil come be swift we ar still far from
the mouth of thi cave where none except the high priest will dare to
seek us and take oliv by the hand she began to run leav us
two to follow as best we could
steadi doctor said quick steadi in the presenc of disast
comrad should alwai stick togeth as it sai in the redbook
present by the crown to warrant offic but paid for out of their
defer allow take my arm doctor ah i thought so the more
hast the less speed look there and he point to the fly shape
ahead now a long wai off and with onli on lamp between them
next instant maqueda turn round hold up thi remain lamp and
call to us i saw the faint light gleam upon her beauti face and
glitter down the silver ornament of her dress veri wild and strang
she look in that huge vault seen thu for a singl moment then seen
no more for present where the flame had been wa but a red spark and
then noth at all
stop still till we come back to you cri oliv and shout at
interv
ye sir said quick and instantli let off a fear yell
which echo backward and forward across the vault till i wa quit
bewild
all right come answer oliv and hi voic sound so far to
the left that quick thought it wise to yell again
to cut a long stori short we next heard him on our right and then
behind us
cant trust sound here sir echo ar too uncertain said the
sergeant but come on i think iv place them now and call
to them not to move we head in what we were sure wa the right
direct
the end of that adventur wa that present i trip up over a
skeleton and found myself ly half stun amidst trai of treasur
affection clasp a skull under the impress that it wa quick
boot
he haul me up again somehow and as we did not know what to do we
sat down amidst the dead and listen by now the other were appar
so far off that the sound of oliv call onli reach us in faint
mysteri note that came from we knew not whenc
as like idiot we start in such a hurri that we forgot to bring ani
match with us there is noth to be done except wait i said no
doubt in due cours those abati will get over their fear of ghost and
come to look for us
wish i could do the same sir i didnt mind those deader in the
light but the dark a differ matter cant you hear them rattl
their shank and talk all round us
certainli i do hear someth i answer but i think it must be the
echo of our own voic
well let us hold our jaw sir and perhap thei will hold their for
thi kind of convers aint nice
so we were silent but the strang murmur still went on come
appar from the wall of the cave behind us and it occur to me
that i had onc heard someth like it befor though at the time i
could not think where afterward i rememb that it wa when as
a boi i had been taken to see the whisper galleri in st paul
cathedr in london
halfanhour or so went by in thi fashion and still there were no
sign of the abati or of our miss pair quick began to fumbl among
hi cloth i ask him what he wa do
cant help think iv got a wax match somewher doctor i rememb
feel it in on of the pocket of thi coat on the dai befor we left
london and think afterward it wasnt safe to have had it pack in
a box mark hold now if onli i could find that match we have got
plenti of torch for iv stuck to my bundl all through although i
never thought of them when the lamp were go out
have small belief in the sergeant match i made no answer and the
search went on till present i heard him ejacul
by jingo here it is in the line ye and the head feel all right
now doctor hold two of the torch toward me make readi present
fire and he struck the match and appli it to the head of the
resin torch
instantli these blaze up give an intens light in that aw
dark by thi light for on moment onli we saw a strang and not
unattract spectacl i think i forgot to sai that in the centr of
thi vault stood a kind of altar which until that moment inde i
had not seen thi altar which doubtless had been us for ceremoni
purpos at the funer of the ancient king consist of a plain
block of basalt stone whereon wa cut the symbol of a human ey the
stone be approach by step and support upon carv and crouch
sphinx
on the lowest of these step near enough to enabl us to see them quit
clearli were seat oliv orm and maqueda child of king thei were
seat veri close togeth inde if i must tell the truth oliv
arm wa about maqueda waist her head rest upon hi shoulder and
appar he wa engag in kiss her upon the lip
right about face hiss the sergeant in a tone of command and mark
time
so we rightabout for a decent period then cough loudlybecaus
of the irrit smoke of the torchesadvanc to cross the cavern
and by accid stumbl upon our lost companion i confess that i had
noth to sai but quick rose to the occas nobli
glad to see you captain he said to oliv wa get veri anxiou
about you sir until by good luck i found a match in the line of my
coat if the professor had been here hed have had plenti which is an
argument in favour of continu smoke even when ladi ar present
ah no wonder her majesti is faint in thi hot place poor young thing
it lucki you didnt leav hold of her sir do you think you could
manag to support her sir as we ought to be move cant offer to do
so myself as i have lame my foot with the tooth of a dead king also
my arm ar full of torch but if you prefer the doctorwhat do you
sai sir that you can manag there is such an echo in thi vault
that it is difficult to hearveri well let us go on for these torch
wont last for ever and you wouldnt like us to have to spend a whole
night here with the ladi in such a delic condit would you
especi as those nastytemp abati might sai that you had done
it on purpos take her majesti arm doctor and let us trek ill go
ahead with the torch
to all thi artless harangu oliv answer not a singl word but
glare at us suspici over the shape of maqueda who appar had
faint onli when i ventur to offer her some profession assist
she recov and said that she could get on quit well alon which
meant upon orm arm
well the end of it wa that she got on and so did we for the torch
last until we reach the narrow slope passag and round the
corner saw the lantern burn in the hole in the wall after which of
cours thing were easi
doctor said oliv to me in a voic of studi nonchal that
night as we were prepar to turn in did you notic anyth in the
vault of king thi afternoon
oh ye i answer lot of cours myself i am not given to
archolog like poor higg but the sight struck me as absolut
uniqu if i were inclin to moral for instanc what a contrast
between those dead ruler and their young and beauti successor full
of life and loveher he look at me sharplylov of her peopl
such as i have no doubt in their dai
oh shut it adam i dont want a philosoph lectur with
histor comparison did you notic anyth except bone and gold
when that unutter ass quick suddenli turn on the lightsi mean
struck the match which unfortun he had with him
now i gave it up and face the situat
well if you want the truth i said not veri much myself for
my sight isnt as good as it us to be but the sergeant who ha
extraordinarili sharp ey thought that he saw you kiss maqueda
a supposit that your rel attitud seem to confirm which
explain moreov some of the curiou sound we heard befor he lit
the torch that why he ask me to turn my back but of cours we
mai have been mistaken do i understand you to sai that the sergeant wa
mistaken
oliv consign the sergeant ey to an ultim fate wors than
that which befel those of peep tom then in a burst of candour for
subterfug never wa hi fort own up
you made no mistak he said we love each other and it came out
suddenli in the dark i suppos that the unusu surround act on
our nerv
from a moral point of view i am glad that you love each other i
remark sinc embrac that ar mere nervou cannot be commend
but from everi other in our circumst the result situat
strike me as a littl short of aw although quick a most observ
man warn me to expect it from the first
curs quick said oliv again with the utmost energi ill give him
a month notic thi veri night
dont i said for then youll oblig him to take servic with
barung where he would be most danger look here orm to drop
chaff thi is a pretti mess
why what wrong about it doctor he ask indignantli of cours
she a jew of some dilut sort or other and im a christian but
those thing adapt themselv of cours too she my superior but
after all her is a strictli local rank and in europ we should be
on much the same foot as for her be an eastern what doe that
matter sure it is not an object which should have weight with
you and for the rest did you ever see her equal
never never never i answer with enthusiasm the young ladi
to whom ani gentleman ha just engag himself is alwai absolut
unequal and let me admit at onc that thi is perhap the most
origin and charm that i have ever met in all central africa onli
whatev mai be the case with you i dont know whether thi fact will
consol me and quick when our throat ar be cut look here orm i
ad didnt i tell you long ago that the on thing you must not do
wa to make love to the child of king
did you realli i forget you told me such a lot of thing doctor
he answer coolli enough onli unfortun the colour that rose in
hi cheek betrai hi lip
at thi moment quick who had enter the room unobserv gave a dry
cough and remark
dont blame the captain doctor becaus he dont rememb there
noth like shock from an explos for upset the memori iv
seen that often in the boer war when after a big shell had gone off
somewher near them the veri bravest soldier would clean forget that
it wa their duti to stand still and not run like rabbit inde it
happen to me myself
i laugh and oliv said someth which i could not hear but quick
went on imperturb
still truth is truth and if the captain ha forgotten the more
reason that we should remind him that even at the professor hous
in london you did warn him sir and he answer that you neednt bother
your head about the fascin of a nigger woman
nigger woman broke out oliv i never us such word i never
even thought them and you ar an impertin fellow to put them into my
mouth nigger woman good heaven it desecr
veri sorri captain now i come to think of it i believ you said
black woman speak in your hast ye and i beg you not to brag
see that if you did we might live to see you crawl after her with
myself samuel quick bring up the rear well there it is we ar and
the worst of it is that i cant blame you be as anticip in the
prophecyfor that what it wa though i didnt know it myself at
the timeexactli in the same state myself though of cours at a
distanc bring up the rear respectfulli as said
you dont mean that you ar in love with the child of king said
oliv stare at the sergeant grim and batter figur
beg your pardon captain that is exactli what i do mean if a cat
mai look at a queen why maynt a man love her howsoev my kind of
love aint like to interfer with your my kind mean sentrygo and
perhap a knife in my gizzard yourswel we saw what your mean
thi afternoon though what it will all lead to we didnt see still
captain speak as on who hasnt been keen on the sex heretofor
i saysail in sinc it worth it even if youv got to sink
afterward for thi ladi although she is half a jew and i never
could abid jew is the sweetest and the loveliest and the best and the
bravest littl woman that ever walk god earth
at thi point oliv seiz hi hand and shook it warmli and i mai
mention that i think some report of quick summari of her charact
must have reach maqueda ear at ani rate thenceforward until the
end she alwai treat the old fellow with what the french call the
most distinguish consider
but as i wa not in love no on shook my hand so leav the other
two to discuss the virtu and grace of the child of king i went off
to bed fill with the gloomiest forbod what a fool i had been not
to insist that whatev expert accompani higg should be a marri
man and yet now when i came to think of it that might not have
better matter and perhap would onli have ad to the transact
a degre of moral turpitud which at present wa lack sinc even
marri men ar sometim weak
the truth wa that maqueda attract were extraordinarili great to
her remark beauti she ad a wonder charm of manner and forc
of mind also her situat must touch the heart and piti of ani man
so helpless wa she in the midst of all her hollow grandeur so lone
amongst a nation of cur whom she strove in vain to save and should
she escap destruct with them doom to so sad and repuls a fate
name to becom the wife of a fat poltroon who wa her own uncl well
we know to what emot piti is akin and the catastroph had occur a
littl sooner than i had expect that wa all
doubtless to her in comparison with the men to whom she wa accustom
and allow by etiquett to take as her associ thi brave and
handsom young englishman who had come into her care sick and shatter
after the do of a great deed must have seem a verit fairi
princ and she had help to nurs him and he had shown himself
grate for her kind and condescens andth rest follow as
sure as the dai follow the night
but how would it end sooner or later the secret must come out for
alreadi the abati nobl if i mai call them so for want of a better
name and especi joshua were bitterli jealou of the favour their
ladi show to the foreign and watch them both then whatwhat
would happen under the abati law it wa death for ani on outsid of
the permit degre of relationship to tamper with the affect of
the child of king nor wa thi wonder sinc that person held her
seat in virtu of her suppos direct descent from solomon and the first
maqueda queen of sheba and therefor the introduct of ani alien
blood could not be toler
moreov orm have sworn an oath of allegi had becom subject
to those law lastli i could not in the least hope from the charact
of the pair concern that thi wa but a pass flirtat
oh without a doubt these two had sign their own deathwarr yonder
in the cave of death and incident our also thi must be the end
of our adventur and my long search for the son whom i had lost
chapter xi
the rescu fail
our breakfast on the follow morn wa a somewhat gloomi meal by
common consent no allus wa made to the event of the previou dai
or to our convers at bedtim
inde there wa no talk at all to speak of sinc not know
what els to do i thought i could best show my attitud of mind by
preserv a sever silenc while quick seem to be absorb
in philosoph reflect and orm look rather excit and
dishevel as though he had been write poetri as i daresai wa
the case in the midst of thi dreari meal a messeng arriv who
announc that the walda nagasta would be pleas to see us all within
halfanhour
fear lest orm should sai someth foolish i answer briefli that
we would wait upon her and the man went leav us wonder what had
happen to caus her to desir our presenc
at the appoint time we were shown into the small audienc room and
as we pass it door i ventur to whisper to oliv
for your own sake and her as well as that of the rest of us i
implor you to be care your face is watch as well as your word
all right old fellow he answer colour a littl you mai trust
me
i wish i could i mutter
then we were shown in ceremoni and made our bow to maqueda who
wa seat surround by some of the judg and offic among them
princ joshua and talk to two roughlook men clad in ordinari
brown robe she greet us and after the exchang of the usual
compliment said
friend i have summon you for thi reason thi morn when the
traitor shadrach wa be led out to execut at the hand of these
men the offic of the law he beg for a delai when ask why as
hi petit for repriev had been refus he said that if hi life
wa spare he could show how your companion he whom thei call black
window mai be rescu from the fung
how ask orm and i in on breath
i do not know she answer but wise thei spare the man let him
be brought in
a door open and shadrach enter hi hand bound behind hi back and
shackl on hi feet he wa a veri fear and much chasten shadrach
for hi ey roll and hi teeth chatter with terror as have
prostrat himself to the walda nagasta he wriggl round and tri to
kiss orm boot the guard pull him to hi feet again and maqueda
said
what have you to tell us traitor befor you die
the thing is secret o bud of the rose must i speak befor so mani
nai she answer and order most of those present to leav the
room includ the execution and soldier
the man is desper and there will be none left to guard him said
joshua nervous
ill do that your high answer quick in hi bad arab and
step up behind shadrach he ad in english now then pussi you
behav or it will be the wors for you
when all had gone again shadrach wa command to speak and sai how he
could save the englishman whom he had betrai into the hand of the
fung
thu child of king he answer black window as we know is
imprison in the bodi of the great idol
how do you know it man
o ladi i do know it and also the sultan said so did he not well
i can show a secret road to that idol whenc he mai be reach and
rescu in my boyhood i who am call cat becaus i can climb so
well found that road and when the fung took me afterward and threw
me to the lion where i got these scar upon my face by it i escap
spare me and i will show it to you
it is not enough to show the road said maqueda dog you must save
the foreign lord whom you betrai if you do not save him you die do
you understand
that is a hard sai ladi answer the man am i god that i should
promis to save thi stranger who perchanc is alreadi dead yet i
will do my best know that if i fail you will kill me and that if
i succe i shall be spare at ani rate i will show you the road to
where he is or wa imprison although i warn you that it is a rough
on
where you can travel we can follow said maqueda tell us now what we
must do
so he told her and when he had done the princ joshua interven
sai that it wa not fit that the child of king in her own sacr
person should undertak such a danger journei she listen to hi
remonstr and thank him for hi care of her
still i am go she said not for the sake of the stranger who is
call black window but becaus if there is a secret wai out of mur
i think it well that i should know that wai yet i agre with you
my uncl that on such a journei i ought not to be unprotect and
therefor i prai that you will be readi to start with us at noon sinc
i am sure that then we shall all be safe
now joshua began to make excus but she would not listen to them
no no she said you ar too honest the honour of the abati is
involv in thi manner sinc ala it wa an abati that betrai
black window and an abatinam yourselfmust save him you have
often told me my uncl how clever you ar at climb rock and now
you shall make proof of your skill and courag befor these foreign
it is a command speak no more and she rose to show that the audienc
wa finish
that same afternoon shadrach by mountain path that were known to him
led a littl compani of peopl to the crest of the western precipic of
mur fifteen hundr feet or more beneath us lai the great plain upon
which some mile awai could be seen the citi of harmac but the idol
in the vallei we could not see becaus here the precipic bent over and
hid it from our sight
what now fellow said maqueda who wa clad in the rough sheepskin
of a peasant woman which somehow look charm upon her here is the
cliff there li the plain i see no road between the two and my wise
uncl the princ tell me that he never heard of on
ladi answer the man now i take command and you must follow me
but first let us see that nobodi and noth ar lack
then he went round the compani and number them in all we were
sixteen maqueda and joshua we three englishmen arm with repeat
rifl and revolv our guid shadrach and some pick mountain
chosen for their skill and courag for even in mur there were brave men
left especi among the shepherd and huntsmen whose home were on
the cliff these sturdi guid were laden with rope lamp and long
slender ladder that could be strap togeth
when everyth had been check and all the ladder and strap test
shadrach went to a clump of bush which grew feebli on the windswept
crest of the precipic in the midst of these he found and remov a
larg flat stone reveal what evid had been the head of a stair
although now it step were much worn and crumbl by the water that in
the wet season follow thi natur drain to the depth below
thi is that road the ancient made for purpos of their own
explain shadrach which as i have said i chanc to discov when
i wa a boi but let none follow it who ar afraid for it is steep and
rough
now joshua who wa alreadi weari with hi long ride and walk up to the
crest of the precipic implor maqueda almost passion to abandon
the idea of enter thi horrid hole while oliv back up hi
entreati with few word but mani appeal glanc for on thi point
though for differ reason the princ and he were at on
but she would not listen
my uncl she said with you the experienc mountain why should
i be afraid if the doctor here who is old enough to be the father of
either of us so far as joshua wa concern thi remark lack truth
is will to go sure i can go also moreov if i remain behind
you would wish to stai to guard me and never should i forgiv myself
if i depriv you of such a great adventur also like you i love
climb come let us wast no more time
so we were rope up first went shadrach with quick next to him a
posit which the sergeant insist upon occupi as hi custodian
and sever of the mountain carri ladder lamp oil food and
other thing then in a second gang came two more of these men oliv
maqueda myself and next to me joshua the remain mountain
brought up the rear carri spare store ladder and so forth when
all wa readi the lamp were lit and we start upon a veri strang
journei
for the first two hundr feet or so the stair though worn and almost
perpendicular for the place wa like the shaft of a mine were not
difficult to descend to ani of us except joshua whom i heard puf
and groan behind me then came a galleri run eastward at a steep
slope for perhap fifti pace and at the end of it a second shaft of
about the same depth as the first but with the stair much more worn
appar by the wash of water of which a good deal trickl out of
the side of the shaft anoth difficulti wa that the air rush up
from below made it hard to keep the lamp alight
toward the bottom of thi section there wa scarc ani stair left and
the climb becam veri danger here inde joshua slip and
with a wail of terror slid down the shaft and land with hi leg
across my back in such a fashion that had i not happen to have
good hand and foot hold at the time he would have propel me on to
maqueda and we must have all roll down headlong probabl to our
death
as it wa thi fat and terrifi fellow cast hi arm about my neck to
which he clung nearli choke me until just when i wa about to faint
beneath hi weight and pressur the mountain in the third parti
arriv and drag him off when thei had got him in charg for i
refus to move anoth step while he wa immedi behind me we
descend by a ladder which the first parti had set up to the second
level where began anoth long eastward slope passag that end at
the mouth of a third pit
here aros the great question as to what wa to be done with the princ
joshua who vow that he could go no farther and demand loudli to be
taken back to the top of the cliff although shadrach assur him that
thenceforward the road wa much easier at length we were oblig to
refer the matter to maqueda who settl it in veri few word
my uncl she said you tell us that you cannot come on and it
is certain that we cannot spare the time and men to send you back
therefor it seem that you must stop where you ar until we return
and if we should not return make the best of your own wai up the shaft
farewel my uncl thi place is safe and comfort and if you ar
wise you will rest awhil
heartless woman gobbl joshua who wa shake like a jelli with
fear and rage would you leav your affianc lord and lover alon in
thi haunt hole while you scrambl down rock like a wild cat with
stranger if i must stai do you stai with me
certainli not repli maqueda with decis shall it be said that
the child of king is afraid to go where her guest can travel
well the end of it wa that joshua came on in the centr of the third
bodi of mountain who were practic oblig to carri him
shadrach wa right sinc for some reason or other the stair
thenceforward remain more perfect onli thei seem almost endless
and befor we reach our goal i calcul that we must have descend
quit twelv hundr feet into the bowel of the rock at length when i
wa almost tire out and maqueda wa so breathless that she wa oblig
to lean on oliv drag me behind her like a dog on a string of a
sudden we saw a glimmer of daylight that crept into the tunnel through a
small hole by the mouth of yet anoth pit or shaft we found shadrach
and the other wait for us salut he said that we must unrop
leav our lamp behind and follow him oliv ask him whither thi
last shaft led
to a still lower level lord he answer but on which you will
scarc care to explor sinc it end in the great pit where the fung
keep their sacr lion
inde said oliv much interest for reason of hi own and he
glanc at quick who nod hi head and whistl
then we all follow shadrach to find ourselv present upon a plateau
about the size of a racquet court which either by natur or by the hand
of man had been recess into the face of that gigant cliff go
to the edg of thi plateau whereon grew mani treefern and some thick
green bush that would have made us invis from below even had there
been ani on to see us we saw that the sheer precipic ran down beneath
for sever hundr feet of these yawn depth howev we did not
at the moment make out much partli becaus thei were plung in shadow
and partli for anoth reason
rise out of the gulf below wa what we took at first to be a round
hill of black rock oblong in shape from which project a gigant
shaft of stone end in a kind of fret bush that alon wa of the
size of a cottag the point of thi bushlik rock wa exactli opposit
the littl plateau on to which we had emerg and distant from it not
more than thirti or at most forti feet
what is that ask maqueda of shadrach point in front of her as
she hand back to on of the mountain a cup from which she had been
drink water
that o walda nagasta he answer is noth els than the back
of the mighti idol of the fung which is shape like a lion the great
shaft of rock with the bush at the end of it is the tail of the lion
doubtless thi platform on which we stand is a place whenc the old
priest when thei own mur as well as the land of the fung us to
hide themselv to watch whatev it wa thei want to see look and
he point to certain groov in the face of the rock i think that
here there wa onc a bridg which could be let down at will on to the
tail of the liongod though long ago it ha rot awai yet er now i
have travel thi road without it
we stare at him astonish and in the silenc that follow i heard
maqueda whisper to oliv
perhap that is how he whom we call cat escap from the fung or
perhap that is how he commun with them as a spy
or perhap he is a liar my ladi interrupt quick who had also
overheard their talk a solut which i confess commend itself to
me
why have you brought us here ask maqueda present
did i not tell you in mur ladyto rescu black window listen now
it is the custom of the fung to allow those who ar imprison within
the idol to walk unguard upon it back at dawn and sunset at least
thi is their custom with black windowsask me not how i know it thi
is truth i swear it on my life which is at stake now thi is my plan
we have with us a ladder which will reach from where we stand to the
tail of the idol should the foreign lord appear upon the back of the
god which if he still live as i believ he doe he is almost sure
to do at sundown as a man who dwell in the dark all dai will love the
light and air when he can get them then some of us must cross and bring
him back with us perhap it had best be you my lord orm sinc if
i went alon or even with these men after what is past black window
might not altogeth trust me
fool broke in maqueda how can a man do such a thing
o ladi it is not so difficult as it look a few step across the
gulf and then a hundr feet or so along the tail of the lion which
is flat on the top and so broad that on mai run down it if care to
follow the curv that is on a still daynoth more but of cours
if the lord orm is afraid which i did not think who have heard so much
of hi courag and the rogu shrug hi shoulder and paus
afraid fellow said oliv well i am not asham to be afraid of
such a journei yet if there is need i will make it though not befor
i see my brother alon yonder on the rock sinc all thi mai be but
a trick of your to deliv me to the fung among whom i know that you
have friend
it is mad you shall not go said maqueda you will fall and be
dash to piec i sai that you shall not go
why should he not go my niec interrupt joshua shadrach is
right we have heard much of the courag of thi gentil now let us see
him do someth
she turn on the princ like a tiger
veri good my uncl then you shall go with him sure on of the
ancient blood of the abati will not shirk from what a gentil dare
on hear thi joshua relaps into silenc and i have no clear memori
of what he did or said in connect with the rest of that thrill
scene
now follow a paus in the midst of which oliv sat down and began to
take off hi boot
why do you undress yourself friend ask maqueda nervous
becaus ladi he answer if i have to walk yonder road it is safer
to do so in my stock have no fear he ad gentli from boyhood
i have been accustom to such feat and when i serv in my countri
armi it wa my pleasur to give instruct in them although it is true
that thi on surpass all that ever i attempt
still i do fear she said
meanwhil quick had sat down and begun to take off hi boot
what ar you do sergeant i ask
get readi to accompani the captain upon forlorn hope doctor
nonsens i said you ar too old for the game sergeant if ani on
goe i should see that i believ my son is over there but i cant
try it as i know my head would give out and i should fall in a second
which would onli upset everybodi

sergeant that if anyth happen to me it is your busi to take

go and see to the prepar and find out the plan of campaign for i
want to rest and keep quiet i daresai the whole thing is humbug and we
shall see noth of the professor still on mai as well be prepar
so quick and i went to superintend the lash of two of the light
ladder togeth and the secur of some plank which we had brought
with us upon the top of the rung so as to make these ladder easi to
walk on i ask who would be of the parti besid shadrach and orm
and wa told no on as all were afraid ultim howev a man
name japhet on of the mountain volunt upon be promis
a grant of land from the child of king herself which grant she
proclaim befor them all wa to be given to hi rel in the event
of hi death
at length everyth wa readi and there came anoth spell of silenc
for the nerv of all of us were so strain that we did not seem abl
to talk it wa broken by a sound of sudden and terribl roar that
aros from the gulf beneath
it is the hour of the feed of the sacr lion which the fung keep
in the pit about the base of the idol explain shadrach then he
ad unless he should be rescu i believ that black window
will be given to the lion tonight which is that of full moon and a
festiv of harmac though mayb he will be kept till the next full moon
when all the fung come up to worship
thi inform did not tend to rais anyon spirit although quick
who alwai tri to be cheer remark that it wa probabl fals
the shadow began to gather in the vallei of harmac wherebi we knew
that the sun wa set behind the mountain inde had it not been
for a clear and curiou glow reflect from the eastern sky the gulf
would have plung us in gloom present far awai upon a rise of rock
which we knew must be the sphinx head of the huge idol a littl figur
appear outlin against the sky and there began to sing the moment
that i heard the distant voic i went near to faint and inde
should have fallen had not quick caught me
what is it adam ask oliv look up from where he and maqueda
sat whisper to each other while the fat joshua glower at them in
the background ha higg appear
no i answer but thank god my son still live that is hi
voic oh if you can save him too
now there wa much suppress excit and some on thrust a pair
of fieldglass into my hand but either thei were wrongli set or the
state of my nerv would not allow me to see through them so quick took
them and report
tall slim figur wear a white robe but at the distanc in thi
light cant make out the face on might hail him perhap onli it
would give us awai ah the hymn is done and he gone seem to jump
into a hole in the rock which show that he all right anywai or
he couldnt jump so cheer up doctor for you have much to be thank
for
ye i repeat after him much to be thank for but still i would
that i had more after all these year to search to think that i should
be so close to him and he know noth of it
after the ceas of the song and the departur of my son there
appear upon the back of the idol three fung warrior fine fellow
clad in long robe and arm with spear and behind them a trumpet
who carri a horn or hollow eleph tusk these men march up and
down the length of the platform from the rise of the neck to the root of
the tail appar to make an inspect have found noth for
of cours thei could not see us hidden behind the bush on our littl
plateau of which no doubt thei did not even know the exist and
much less that it wa connect with the mountain plain of mur the
trumpet blew a shrill blast upon hi horn and befor the echo of it
had di awai vanish with hi companion
sunset tour of inspect seen the same kind of thing as at gib
said the sergeant oh by jingo pussi isnt ly after allther
he is and he point to a figur that rose suddenli out of the black
stone of the idol back just as the guard had done
it wa higg higg without a doubt higg wear hi batter
sunhelmet and hi dark spectacl higg smoke hi big meerschaum
pipe and engag in make note in a pocketbook as calmli as though
he sat befor a new object in the british museum
i gasp with astonish for somehow i had never expect that we
should realli see him but orm rise veri quietli from hi seat
besid maqueda onli said
ye that the old fellow right enough well now for it you
shadrach run out your ladder and cross first that i mai be sure you
plai no trick

return from hi friend the fung man she said address japhet the
mountain to whom she had promis land go you over first and hold
the end of the ladder while thi lord cross if he return safe your
reward is doubl
japhet salut the ladder wa run out and it end set upon the
rough in the rock that repres the hair of the sphinx tail
the mountain paus a moment with hand and face uplift evid
he wa prai then bid hi companion hold the hither end of the
ladder and have first test it with hi foot and found that it hung
firm calmli he walk across be a brave fellow and present wa
seen seat on the oppos mass of rock
now came oliv turn he nod to maqueda who went white as a sheet
mutter some word to her that did not reach me then he turn and
shook my hand
if you can save my son also i whisper
ill do my best if i can get hold of him he answer sergeant if
anyth happen to me you know your duti
ill try and follow your exampl captain under all circumst
though that will be hard repli quick in a rather shaki voic
oliv step out on the ladder i reckon that twelv or fourteen
short pace would take him across and the first half of these he
accomplish with quiet certainti when he wa in the exact middl of
the passag howev the end of on of the upright of the ladder at
the farther side slip a littl notwithstand the effort of japhet
to keep it straight with the result that the plank bound on the rung
lost it level sink an inch or so to the right and nearli caus
oliv to fall from it into the gulf he waver like a windshaken
reed attempt to step forward hesit stop and slowli sank on
to hi hand and knee
ah pant maqueda
the gentil ha lost hi head began joshua in a voic full of the
triumph that he could not hide hewil
joshua got no further for quick turn threaten him savag with
hi fist sai in english
stow your jaw if you dont want to follow him you swine whereon
joshua who understood the gestur if not the word relaps into
silenc
now the mountain on the farther side spoke sai
have no fear the ladder is safe
for a moment oliv remain in hi crouch postur on the board
which wa all that separ him from an aw death in the gulf
beneath next while we watch agon he rose to hi feet again
and with perfect calm walk across to it other end
well done our side said quick address joshua why dont your
royal high cheer no you leav that knife alon or present
therel be a hog the less in thi world and stoop down he reliev
the princ of the weapon which he wa finger with hi round ey
fix upon the sergeant
maqueda who had note all now interf
my uncl she said brave men ar risk their live yonder while we
sit in safeti be silent and ceas from quarrel i prai you
next moment we had forgotten all about joshua be utterli absorb in
watch the drama in progress upon the farther side of the gulf after
a slight paus to recov hi nerv or breath orm rose and preced
by japhet climb up the bushlik rock till he reach the shaft
of the sphinx tail here he turn and wave hi hand to us
then follow the mountain walk appar with the utmost
confid along the curv of the tail to where it sprang from the
bodi of the idol at thi spot there wa a littl difficulti in climb
over the smooth slope of rock on to the broad terracelik back soon
howev thei surmount it and vanish for a few second into
the hollow of the loin which of cours wa a good mani feet deep
reappear move toward the shoulder between these we could see
higg stand with hi back toward us utterli unconsci of all that
wa pass behind him
pass japhet oliv walk up to the professor and touch him on
the arm higg turn stare at the pair for a moment and then in
hi astonish or so we guess sat down plump upon the rock thei
pull him to hi feet orm point to the cliff behind and evid
explain the situat and what must be done then follow a short
and anim talk through the glass we could even see higg shake
hi head he told them someth thei came to a determin for
now he turn step forward a pace or two and vanish as i learnt
afterward to fetch my son without whom he would not try to escap
a while went by it seem an ag but realli wa under a minut we
heard the sound of shout higgss white helmet reappear and then hi
bodi with two fung guard cling on to him he yell out in english
and the word reach us faintli
save yourself ill hold these devil run you infern fool run
oliv hesit although the mountain wa pull at him till the
head of more fung appear then with a gestur of despair he turn
and fled first ran oliv then japhet whom he had outpac and after
them came a number of priest or guard wave knive while in the
background higg roll on the rock with hi captor
the rest wa veri short orm slid down the rump of the idol on to the
tail follow by the mountain and after them in singl file came
three fung who appar thought no more of the peril natur of
their foothold than do the sheik of the egyptian pyramid when thei
swarm about those monument like lizard nor for the matter of that
did oliv or japhet who doubl down the tail as though it were a race
track oliv swung himself on to the ladder and in a second wa
half across it we hold it other end when suddenli he heard hi
companion cry out a fung had got hold of japhet by the leg and he lai
face downward on the board
oliv halt and slowli turn round draw hi revolv as he did
so then he aim and fire and the fung leav go of japhet leg
threw up hi arm and plung headlong into the gulf beneath the next
thing i rememb is that thei were both among us and somebodi shout
pull in the ladder
no said quick wait a bit
vagu i wonder why till i perceiv that three of those courag
fung were follow across it rest their hand upon each other
shoulder while their companion cheer them
now pull brother pull shout the sergeant and pull we did poor
fung thei deserv a better fate
alwai inflict loss upon the enemi when you get a chanc remark the
sergeant as he open fire with hi repeat rifl upon other fung
who by now were cluster upon the back of the idol thi posit
howev thei soon abandon as unten except on or two of them who
remain there dead or wound
a silenc follow in the midst of which i heard quick sai to joshua
in hi veri worst arab
now doe your royal high think that we gentil ar coward
although it is true those fung ar as good men as we ani dai
joshua declin argument and i turn to watch oliv who had cover
hi face with hi hand and seem to be weep
what is it o friend what is it i heard maqueda sai in her gentl
voicea voic full of tear tear of gratitud i think you have done
a great deed you have return safe all is well
nai he answer forget her titl in hi distress all is ill

fact he spoke of him firstthei seem to have becom friend he said
he would not escap without him and could fetch him in a moment as
he wa onli just below well he went to do so and must have found the
guard instead who i suppos had heard us talk you know as much
about the rest as i do tonight when the full moon is two hour high
there is to be a ceremoni of sacrific and poor higg will be let down
into the den of lion he wa write hi will in a notebook when we
saw him as barung had promis to send it to us
doctor said the sergeant in a confidenti voic when he had
digest thi inform would you translat for me a bit as i want
to have a talk with cat there and my arab dont run to it
i nod and we went to that corner of the plateau where shadrach stood
apart watch and listen
now cat said the sergeant i give hi remark in hi own languag
leav out my render just listen to me and understand that if
you tell li or plai game either you or i dont reach the top of thi
cliff again aliv do you catch on
shadrach repli that he caught on
veri well youv told us that onc you were a prison among the
fung and thrown to these holi lion but got out now just explain what
happen
thi o quick after ceremoni that do not matter i wa let down in
the foodbasket into the feedingden and thrown out of the basket like
ani other meat then the gate were lift up by the chain and the
lion came in to devour me accord to their custom
and what happen next shadrach
what happen why of cours i hid myself in the shadow as much as
possibl right against the wall of the precipic until a satan of
a shelion snuffl me out and gave a stroke at me look here ar the
mark of her claw and he point to the scar upon hi face those
claw stung like scorpion thei made me mad the terror which i had
lost when i saw their yellow ey came back to me i rush at the
precipic as a cat that is hunt by a dog rush at a wall i clung
to it smooth side with my nail with my toe with my teeth a lion
leap up and tore the flesh of my leg here here and he show the
mark which we could scarc see in that dim light he ran back for
anoth spring abov me i saw a tini ledg big enough for a hawk to
sit onno more i jump i caught it draw up my leg so that the
lion miss me i made the effort a man make onc in hi life somehow
i drag myself to that ledg i rest on thigh upon it and press
against the rock to steadi myself then the rock gave and i tumbl
backward into the bottom of a tunnel afterward i escap to the top
of the cliff in the dark o god of israel in the dark smell my wai
climb like a baboon risk death a thousand time it took me two
whole dai and night and the last of those night i knew not what i
did yet i found my wai and that is why my peopl name me cat
i understand said quick in a new and more respect voic and
howev big a rascal you mai be youv got pluck now sai rememb
what i told you and he tap the handl of hi revolv is that
feedingden where it us to be
i believ so o quick why should it be chang the victim ar let
down from the belli of the god just there between hi thigh where ar
door the feedingplac li in a hollow of the cliff thi platform on
which we stand is over it none saw my escap therefor none search
for the mean of it sinc thei thought that the lion had devour
me as thei have devour thousand no on enter there onli when the
beast have fed full thei draw back to their sleepingden and those
who watch abov let down the bar listen and as he spoke we heard a
crash and a rattl far below thei fall now the lion have eaten
when black window and perhap other ar thrown to them by and by
thei will be drawn up again
is that hole in the rock still there shadrach
without doubt though i have not been down to look
then my boi you ar go now remark quick grimli
chapter xii
the den of lion
we return to the other and told them everyth that we had learn
from shadrach
what your plan sergeant ask oliv when he had heard tell me
for i have none my head is muddl
thi captain for what it is worth that i should go down through the
hole that cat here speak of and get into the den then when thei let
down the professor if thei do and pull up the gate that i should
keep back the lion with my rifl while he bolt to the ladder which is
readi for him and i follow if i can
capit said orm but you cant go alon ill come too
and i also i said
what scheme do you make ask maqueda eagerli for of cours she
could not understand our talk
we explain
what my friend she said to oliv reproachfulli would you risk
your life again tonight sure it is tempt the good of god
it would be tempt the good of god much more if i left my friend
to be eaten by lion ladi he answer
then follow much discuss in the end it wa agre that we should
descend to the level of the den if thi were possibl that oliv and
quick should go down into the den with japhet who instantli volunt
to accompani them and that i with some of the mountain should
stop in the mouth of the hole as a reserv to cover their retreat from
the lion i plead to be allow to take a more activ part but of
thi thei would not hear sai with some truth that i wa by far the
best shot of the three and could do much more to help them from abov
if as wa hope the moon should shine brightli
but i knew thei realli meant that i wa too old to be of servic in such
an adventur as thi also thei desir to keep me out of risk
then came the question as to who should descend the last tunnel to the
place of oper oliv wish maqueda to return to the top of the
cliff and wait there but she said at onc that she could not think of
attempt the ascent without our aid also that she wa determin to
see the end of the matter even joshua would not go i think that be
an unpopular charact among them he distrust the mountain whose
duti it would have been to escort him
it wa suggest that he should remain where he wa until we return
if we did return but thi idea commend itself to him still less than
the other inde he point out with much truth what we had overlook
name that now the fung knew of the passag and were quit capabl
of plai our own game that is of throw a bridg across from the
sphinx tail and attempt the storm of mur
and then what should i do if thei found me here alon he ad
pathet
maqueda answer that she wa sure she did not know but that meanwhil
it might be wise to block the mouth of the tunnel by which we had
reach the plateau in such a fashion that it could not easili be
forc
ye answer oliv and if we ever get out of thi to blow the
shaft in and make sure that it cannot be us
that shaft might be us captain said quick doubtfulli
there is a better wai sergeant if we want to mine under the sphinx
i mean through the tomb of king i took the level roughli and the end
of it cant be far off anyhow thi shaft is of no more us to us now
that the fung have found it out
then we set to work to fill in the mouth of the passag with such loos
stone as we could find it wa a difficult busi but in the end the
mountain made a veri fair job of it under our direct pile the
rock in such a fashion that thei could scarc be clear awai in ani
short time without the aid of explos
while thi work wa go on japhet shadrach and the sergeant in
charg of him undertook to explor the last shaft which led down to the
level of the den to our relief just as we had finish build up
the hole thei return with the new that now after thei had remov a
fallen stone or two it wa quit practic with the aid of rope and
ladder
so in the same order as befor we commenc it passag and in about
halfanhour for it wa under three hundr feet in depth arriv
safe at the foot here we found a bathaunt place like a room that
evid had been hollow out by man as shadrach had said at it
eastern extrem wa a larg oblong boulder so balanc that if even
on person push on either of it end it swung around leav on
each side a passag larg enough to allow a man to walk through in a
crouch attitud
veri silent we prop open thi primval door and look out now the
full moon wa up and her brilliant light had begun to flood the gulf
by it we saw a dens shadow that reach from the ground to three
hundr feet or so abov us thi we knew to be that thrown by the
flank of the gigant sphinx which project beyond the mountain of
stone whereon it rest those flank whenc accord to shadrach
higg would be lower in a foodbasket in thi shadow and on either
side of it cover a space of quit a hundr yard squar lai the
feedingden whenc aros a sickli and horribl odour such as is common
to ani place frequent by cat mingl with the more pungent smell of
decai flesh
thi darksom den wa surround on three side by precipic and on
the fourth that toward the east enclos by a wall or barrier of rock
pierc with sever gate made of bar of metal or so we judg by the
light that flow through them
from beyond thi eastern wall came dread sound of roar snarl and
whimper evid there the sacr lion had their home
onli on more thing need be mention on the rock floor almost
immedi beneath us lai remain which from their torn cloth and
hair we knew must be human as somebodi explain i think it wa
shadrach thei were those of the man whom orm had shot upon the tail of
the sphinx and of hi companion who had been tilt off the ladder
for awhil we gaze at thi horribl hole in silenc then oliv took
out hi watch which wa a repeat and struck it
higg told me he said that he wa to be thrown to the lion two
hour after moonris which is within fifteen minut or so sergeant i
think we had better be get readi
ye captain answer quick but everyth is quit readi
includ those brute to judg by the nois thei make except
perhap samuel quick who never felt less readi for anyth in hi
life now then pussi run out that ladder here your rifl captain
and six reload clip of cartridg five hollownos bullet in each
youll never want more than that and it no us carri extra weight
in your righthand pocket captain dont forget iv the same in mine
doctor here a pile for you laid upon that stone if you lie there
youll have a good light and rest for your elbow and at thi rang
ought to make veri pretti shoot even in the moonlight best keep
your pistol on the safe captain at least im do so as we might
get a fall and these newfangl weapon ar veri hairtrigg
here japhet readi too so give us your march order sir and we
will go to busi the doctor will translat to japhet
we descend the ladder said orm and advanc about fifti pace into
the shadow where we can see without be seen where also accord
to shadrach the foodbasket is let down there we shall stand and await
the arriv of thi basket if it contain the professor he whom the
fung and the abati know as black window japhet you ar to seiz him
and lead or if necessari carri him to the ladder up which some of the
mountain must be readi to help him your duti sergeant and mine
also that of the doctor fire from abov will be to keep off the lion
as best we can should ani lion appear retreat as we fire if the
brute get on of us he must be left sinc it is foolish that both
live should be sacrif needlessli for the rest you sergeant
and you japhet must be guid by circumst and act upon your own
discret do not wait for special order from me which i mai not be
abl to give now come on if we do not return adam you will see the
child of king safe up the shaft and conduct her to mur goodby
ladi
goodby answer maqueda in a brave voic i could not see her
face in the dark present i am sure you will return with your
brother
just then joshua broke in
i will not be outdon in courag by these gentil he said lack
their terribl weapon i cannot advanc into the den but i will
descend and guard the foot of the ladder
veri well sir answer orm in an astonish voic glad to have
your compani i am sure onli rememb that you must be quick in go
up it again sinc hungri lion ar activ and let all take notic that
we ar not respons for anyth that mai happen to you
sure you had better stop where you ar my uncl remark maqueda
to be mock by you for ever after my niec no i go to face the
lion and veri slowli he crept through the hole and began to descend
the ladder inde when quick follow after an interv he found
him onli halfwai down and had to hurri hi movement by accident
tread on hi finger
a minut or two later peep over the edg i saw that thei were all
in the den that is except joshua who had reascend the ladder to the
height of about six feet and stood on it face outward hold to the
rock on either side with hi hand as though he had been crucifi
fear lest he should be seen there even in the shadow i suggest to
maqueda that she should order him either to go down or to return which
she did vigor but without effect so in the end we left him alon
meanwhil the three had vanish into the shadow of the sphinx and we
could see noth of them the great round moon rose higher and higher
flood the rest of the charnelhous with light and save for an
occasion roar or whimper from the lion beyond the wall the silenc
wa intens now i could make out the metal gate in thi wall and even
dark and stealthi form which pass and repass beyond their bar
then i made out someth els also the figur of men gather on the
top of the wall though whenc thei came i knew not by degre their
number increas till there were hundr of them for the wall wa
broad as a roadwai
evid these were spectat come to wit the ceremoni of
sacrific
princ i whisper to joshua you must get down off the ladder or
you will betrai us all nai it is too late to come up here again for
alreadi the moonlight strike just abov your head go down or we will
cast the ladder loos and let you fall
so he went down and hid himself among some fern and bush where we
saw no more of him for a while and to tell the truth forgot hi
exist
far far abov us from the back of the idol i suppos came a faint
sound of solemn chant it sank and we heard shout then suddenli
it swell again now maqueda who knelt near me touch my arm and
point to the shadow which gradual wa becom infiltr with the
moonlight flow into it from either side i look and high in
the air perhap two hundr feet from the ground saw someth dark
descend slowli doubtless it wa the basket contain higg and
whether by coincid or no at thi moment the lion on the farther
side of the wall burst into peal upon peal of terrif roar perhap
their sentri watch at the gate saw or smelt the familiar basket
and commun the intellig to their fellow
slowli slowli it descend till it wa within a few feet of the
ground when it began to swai backward and forward like a pendulum at
each swing cover a wider arc present when it hung over the edg
of the shadow that wa nearest to us it wa let down with a run and
overset and out of it look veri small in those vast surround
and that mysteri light roll the figur of a man although at
that distanc we could see littl of him accid assur us of hi
ident for as he roll the hat he wore fell from him and i knew
it at onc for higgss sunhelmet he rose from the ground limp veri
slowli and painfulli after the helmet pick it up and proceed to
us it to dust hi knee at thi moment there wa a clank sound
oh thei lift the gate murmur maqueda
then follow more sound thi time of wild beast rage for their
prei and of other human beast shriek with excit on the wall
abov the professor turn and saw for a moment he seem about to
run then chang hi mind clap the helmet on hi head fold hi
arm and stood still remind me in some curiou wai perhap becaus
of the short of hi thick figur of a pictur i had seen of the
great napoleon contempl a disast
to describ what follow is extrem difficult for we watch not
on but sever simultan scene for instanc there were the lion
which did not behav as might have been expect i thought that thei
would rush through the door and bound upon the victim but whether it
wa becaus thei had alreadi been fed that afternoon or becaus thei
thought that a singl human be wa not worth the troubl thei act
differ
through the open gate thei came in two indol yellow line male
lion femal lion halfgrown lion cub lion that cuf each other
in plai in all perhap fifti or sixti of them of these onli two or
three look toward the professor for none of them ran or gallop
while the rest spread over the den some of them vanish into the
shadow at the edg of the surround cliff where the moonlight could
not reach
here on of them at ani rate must have travel fast enough for it
seem onli a few second later that we heard a terrif yell beneath
us and crane over the rock i saw the princ joshua run up the
ladder more swiftli than ever did ani london lamplight when i wa a
boi
but quickli as he came the long thin sinuou thing beneath came
quicker it rear itself on it hind leg it stretch up a great
pawi can see the gleam claw in it nowand struck or hook at
poor joshua the paw caught him in the small of the back and seem
to pin him against the ladder then it wa drawn slowli downward
and heaven how joshua howl up came the other paw to repeat the
oper when stretch myself outward and downward with an abati
hold me by the ankl i manag to shoot the beast through the
head so that it fell all of a heap take with it a larg portion of
joshua nether garment
a few second later he wa among us and tumbl groan into a corner
where he lai in charg of some of the mountain for i had no time to
attend to him just then
when the smoke clear at length i saw that japhet had reach higg
and wa gesticul to him to run while two lion a male and a
femal stood at a littl distanc regard the pair in an interest
fashion higg after some brief word of explan point to hi
knee evid he wa lame and could not run japhet rise to the
occas point to hi back and bent down higg flung himself upon
it and wa hitch up like a sack of flour the pair began to advanc
toward the ladder japhet carri higg as on schoolboi carri
anoth
the lion sat down like a great dog watch thi strang proceed
with mild interest but the lioness fill with feminin curios
follow snif at higg who look over hi shoulder take off hi
batter helmet he threw it at the beast hit her on the head
she growl then seiz the helmet plai with it for a moment as
a kitten doe with a ball of wool and next instant find it
unsatisfi utter a short and savag roar ran forward and crouch
to spring lash her tail i could not fire becaus a bullet that
would hit her must first pass through japhet and higg
but just when i thought that the end had come a rifl went off in the
shadow and she roll over kick and bite the rock thereon the
indol male lion seem to awak and sprang not at the men but at
the wound lioness and a hellish fight ensu of which the detail
and end were lost in a mist of dust and fly hair
the crowd upon the wall becom aliv to the real situat began to
scream in indign excit which quickli commun itself to
the less savag beast these set up a terribl roar and ran about
keep for the most part to the shadow while japhet and hi burden
made slow but steadi progress toward the ladder
then from the gloom beneath the hindquart of the sphinx rose a
sound of rapid fire and present orm and quick emerg into the
moonlight follow by a number of angri lion that advanc in short
rush evid the pair had kept their head and were act on a
plan
on of them empti hi rifl at the pursu beast while the other
ran back a few pace thrust in a fresh clip of cartridg as he
went then he began to fire and hi companion in turn retreat behind
him in thi wai thei knock over a number of lion for the rang wa
too short for them to miss often and the expand bullet did their
work veri well paralyz even when thei did not kill i also open
fire over their head and although in that uncertain light the
major of my shot did no damag the other dispos of sever
anim which i saw were becom danger
so thing went on until all four that is japhet with higg upon
hi back and orm and quick were within twenti pace of the ladder
although separ from each other by perhap half the length of a
cricket pitch we thought that thei were safe and shout in our joi
while the hundr of spectat on the wall who fortun dare not
descend into the den becaus of the lion which ar undiscrimin
beast yell with rage at the immin rescu of the sacrific
then of a sudden the posit chang from everi quarter fresh lion
seem to arriv ring the men round and clearli bent on slaughter
although the shout and the sound of firearm which thei had never
heard befor frighten them and made them cautiou
a halfgrown cub rush in and knock over japhet and higg i fire
and hit it in the flank it bit savag at it wound then sprang on to
the prostrat pair and stood over them growl but in such pain that
it forgot to kill them the ring of beast close inw could see their
yellow ey glow in the gloom orm and quick might have got through
by the help of their rifl but thei could not leav the other the
dread climax seem at hand
follow me said maqueda who all thi while had watch pant at my
side and rose to run to the ladder i thrust her back
nai i shout follow me abati shall a woman lead you
of how i descend that ladder i have no recollect nor do i in the
least know how the mountain came after me but i think that the most
of them roll and scrambl down the thirti feet of rock at least to
their honour be it said thei did come yell like demon and wave
long knive in their hand
the effect of our sudden arriv from abov wa extraordinari scare
by the rush and the nois the lion gave wai then bolt in everi
direct the wound cub which could not or would not move be
stab to death where it stood over higg and japhet
five minut more and all of us were safe in the mouth of the tunnel
that wa how we rescu higg from the den of the sacr lion which
guard the idol of the fung
chapter xiii
the adventur of higg
a more weari and dishevel set of peopl than that which about the
hour of dawn final emerg from the mouth of the ancient shaft on to
the cliff of mur it ha seldom been my lot to behold yet with a singl
except the parti wa a happi on for we had come triumphant through
great danger and actual effect our objectth rescu of
higg which under the circumst most peopl would have thought
imposs ye there he wa in the flesh befor us have injur hi
knee and lost hi hat but otherwis quit sound save for a few trifl
scratch inflict by the cub and still wear what the nativ
call hi black window
even the princ joshua wa happi though wrap in a piec of coars
sack becaus the lion had taken most of hi posterior cloth and
terribl sore from the deep cut left by the claw
had he not dare the danger of the den and thu prove himself a hero
whose fame would last for gener had i not assur him that hi
honour wound though pain as a matter of fact after thei had
set thei kept him stiff as a mummi for some dai so that unless he
stood upon hi feet he had to be carri or lie rigid on hi face
would probabl not prove fatal and had he not actual surviv to
reach the upper air again which wa more than he ever expect to do
no wonder that he wa happi
i alon could not share in the gener joi sinc although my friend
wa restor to me my son still remain a prison among the fung yet
even in thi matter thing might have been wors sinc i learn
that he wa well treat and in no danger but of that i will write
present
never shall i forget the scene after the arriv of higg in our hole
when the swing boulder had been close and made secur and the lamp
light there he sat on the floor hi red hair glow like a torch
hi cloth torn and bloodi hi beard rag and stretch in a
newgat frill to hi ear inde hi whole appear accentu by
the blue spectacl with wire gauz sidepiec wa more disreput
than word can tell moreov he smelt horribl of lion he put hi
hand into hi pocket and produc hi big pipe which had remain
unbroken in it case
some tobacco pleas he said those were hi first word to us i
have finish mine save up the last to smoke just befor thei put me
into that stink basket
i gave him some and as he lit hi pipe the light of the match fell upon
the face of maqueda who wa stare at him with amus astonish
what an uncommonli pretti woman he said what she do down here
and who is she
i told him whereon he rose or rather tri to felt for hi hat
which of cours had gone with the idea of take it off and
instantli address her in hi beauti and fluent arab sai how
glad he wa to have thi unexpect honour and so forth
she congratul him on hi escap whereon hi face grew seriou
ye a nasti busi he said as yet i can hardli rememb whether
my name is daniel or ptolemi higg then he turn to us and ad
look here you fellow if i dont thank you it isnt becaus i am not
grate but becaus i cant the truth is im a bit daze your son
is all right adam he a good fellow and we grew great friend
safe oh ye he safe as a church old barung he the sultan and
anoth good fellow although he did throw me to the lionsbecaus the
priest made himi veri fond of him and is go to marri him to hi
daughter
at thi moment the men announc that everyth wa readi for our
ascent and when i had attend to joshua with a heart made thank by
higgss new we began that toilsom busi and as i have alreadi
said at length accomplish it safe but even then our labour were
not end sinc it wa necessari to fill up the mouth of the shaft so
as to make it imposs that it should be us by the fung who now
knew of it exist
nor wa thi a busi that could be delai for as we pass the
plateau whenc oliv and japhet had cross to the sphinx we heard the
voic of men on the farther side of the rough wall that we had built
there evid the priest or idol guard infuri by the rescu
of their victim had alreadi manag to bridg the gulf and were
contempl assault a knowledg which caus us to hurri our
movement consider if thei had got through befor we pass them
our fate would have been terribl sinc at the best we must have slowli
starv in the pit below
inde as soon as we reach the top and had block it temporarili
quick weari as he wa wa sent off on horseback accompani by
maqueda shadrach now under the term of hi contract onc more a free
man and two mountain to gallop to the palac of mur and fetch a
suppli of explos the rest of us for higg declin to leav and
we had no mean of carri joshua remain watch the place or
rather the abati watch while we slept with our rifl in our hand
befor noon quick return accompani by mani men with litter and all
thing need
then we pull out the stone and oliv japhet and some other
descend to the first level and arrang blast charg awhil after
he reappear with hi companion look somewhat pale and anxiou
and shout to us to get back follow our retreat to a certain
distanc unwind a wire as he came present he stop and press
the button of a batteri which he held in hi hand there wa a muffl
explos and a tremor of the soil like to that of an earthquak while
from the mouth of the shaft stone leapt into the air
it wa over and all that could be note wa a sinkag in the ground
where the ancient pit had been
i am sorri for them said oliv present but it had to be done
sorri for whom i ask
for those fung priest or soldier the level below ar full of them
dead or aliv thei were pour up at our heel well no on will
travel that road again
later in the guest hous at mur higg told us hi stori after hi
betray by shadrach which it appear wa meant to includ us all
for the professor overheard the hurri talk between him and a fung
captain he wa seiz and imprison in the bodi of the great sphinx
where mani chamber and dungeon had been hollow out by the primval
race that fashion it here barung the sultan visit him and inform
him of hi meet with the rest of us to whom appar he had taken
a great like and also that we had refus to purchas a chanc of hi
releas at the price of be fals to our trust
you know said higg that when first i heard thi i wa veri angri
with you and thought you a set of beast but on consid thing
i saw the other side of it and that you were right although i never
could come to fanci the idea of be sacrif to a sphinx by be
chuck like a piec of horseflesh to a lot of holi lion howev
barung an excel fellow in hi wai assur me that there wa no
road out of the matter without give grave offenc to the priest who
ar veri power among the fung and bring a fear curs on the
nation
meanwhil he made me as comfort as he could for instanc i
wa allow to walk upon the back of the idol to associ with the
priest a suspici and most exclus set and to studi their entir
religi system from which i have no doubt that of egypt wa deriv
inde i have made a great discoveri which if ever we get out of thi
will carri my name down to all gener the forefath of
these fung were undoubtedli also the forefath of the predynast
egyptian as is shown by the similar of their custom and spiritu
theori further intercours wa kept up between the fung who then
had their headquart here in mur and the egyptian in the time of
the ancient empir till the twentieth dynasti inde if not later
my friend in the dungeon in which i wa confin there is an
inscript or rather a graffit made by a prison extradit to
mur by rames ii after twenti year resid in egypt which wa
written by him on the night befor he wa thrown to the sacr lion
that even in those dai were an establish institut and i have got
a copi of that inscript in my pocketbook i tell you he ad in
a scream of triumph iv got a certifi copi of that inscript
thank to shadrach on whose dirti head be bless
i congratul him heartili upon thi triumph and befor he proceed
to give us further archolog detail ask him for some inform
about my boi
oh said higg he is a veri nice young man and extrem good
look inde i am quit proud to have such a godson he wa much
interest to hear that you were hunt for him after so mani year
quit touch inde he still talk english though with a fung accent
and of cours would like to escap meanwhil he is have a veri
good time be chief singer to the god for hi voic is realli
beauti an offic which carri with it all sort of privileg i
told you didnt i that he is to be marri to barung onli legitim
daughter on the night of the next full moon but on the ceremoni is
to take place in harmac citi and will be the greatest of it sort for
gener a feast of the entir peopl in short i should veri much
like to be present at it but be an intellig young man he ha
promis to keep note of everyth which i hope mai becom avail
in due cours
and is he attach to thi savag ladi i ask dismai
attach oh dear no i think he said he had never seen her and onli
knew that she wa rather plain and report to possess a haughti temper
he is a philosoph young man howev as might be expect from on
who ha undergon so mani vicissitud and therefor take thing
as thei come thank heaven that thei ar no wors you see as
the husband of the sultan daughter unless the pair quarrel veri
violent he will be safe from the lion and he could never quit sai
as much befor but we didnt go into these domest matter veri deepli
as there were so mani more import thing to interest us both he
want to know all about you and our plan and natur i want to
know all about the fung and the ritual and tradit connect with the
worship of harmac so that we were never dull for a singl moment
in fact i wish that we could have had longer togeth for we becam
excel friend but whatev happen i think that i have collect
the cream of hi inform and he tap a fat notebook in hi
hand ad
what an aw thing it would have been if a lion had eaten thi for
myself it did not matter there mai be mani better egyptologist but i
doubt if ani on of them will again have such opportun of origin
research howev i took everi possibl precaut to save my note
by leav a copi of the most import of them written with nativ
ink upon sheepskin in charg of your son inde i meant to leav the
origin also but fortun forgot in the excit of my veri
hurri departur
i agre with him that hi chanc had been uniqu and that he wa a
most lucki archologist and present he went on puf at hi pipe
of cours when oliv turn up in that unexpect fashion on the back
of the idol rememb your wish and natur desir to recov
your son i did my best to rescu him also but he wasnt in the room
beneath where i thought i should find him the priest were there
instead and thei had heard us talk abov and you know the rest
well as it happen it didnt matter though that descent into the
den of lionsther were two or three hundr feet of it and the rope
seem worn uncommonli thin with usewa a try busi to the
nerv
what did you think about all the time ask oliv curious
think about i didnt think much wa in too great a fright i just
wonder whether st paul had the same sensat when he wa let down
in a basket wonder what the earli christian martyr felt like in
the arena wonder whether barung with whom my part wa quit
affection would come in the morn and look for me as dariu did
for daniel and how much he would find if he did hope that my spec
would give on of those brute append and so forth my word it
wa sicken especi that kind of schooltreat swing and bump at
the end i never could bear swing still it wa all for the best as
i shouldnt have gone a yard along that sphinx tail without tumbl
off tightrop walk not be in my line and ill tell you what
you ar just the best three fellow in the whole world dont you think
i forget that becaus i havent said much and now let have your yarn
for i want to hear how thing stand which i never expect to do thi
side of judgmentdai
so we told him all while he listen openmouth when we came to the
descript of the tomb of the king hi excit could scarc be
restrain
you havent touch them he almost scream dont sai you have been
vandal enough to touch them for everi articl must be catalogu in
situ and draw must be made if possibl specimen group with their
surround offer should be move so that thei can be set up again
in museum why there six month work befor me at least and to
think that if it hadnt been for you by now i should be in process of
digest by a lion a stink mangi sacr lion
next morn i wa awaken by higg limp into my room in some weird
sleepingsuit that he had contriv with the help of quick
i sai old fellow he said tell me some more about that girl walda
nagasta what a sweet face she got and what pluck of cours such
thing aint in my line never look at a woman these twenti year
past hard enough to rememb her next morn but by jingo the ey
of that on made me feel quit queer here and he hit the sleepingsuit
somewher in the middl though perhap it wa onli becaus she wa
such a contrast to the lion
ptolemi i answer in a solemn voic let me tell you that she is
more danger to meddl with than ani lion and what more if you
dont want to further complic matter with a flame row you had
better keep to your old habit and leav her ey alon i mean that
oliv is in love with her
of cours he is i never expect anyth els but what that got to
do with it why shouldnt i be in love with her too though i admit
he ad sadli contempl hi rotund form the chanc ar in hi
favour especi as he got the start
thei ar ptolemi for she in love with him and i told him what we
had seen in the tomb of king
first he roar with laughter then on second thought grew exceedingli
indign
i call it scandal of oliv compromis us all in thi wayth
lucki dog these selfish amor adventur will let us in for no end
of troubl it is even probabl adam that you and i mai come to a
miser end sole becaus of thi young man erot tendenc
just fanci neglect busi in order to run after a pretti
roundfac jewess that is if she is a jewess which i doubt as the
blood must have got consider mix by now and the first queen of
sheba if she ever exist wa an ethiopian as a friend almost old
enough to be hi father i shall speak to him veri serious
all right i call after him as he hobbl off to take hi bath
onli if you ar wise you wont speak to maqueda for she might
misinterpret your motiv if you go on stare at her as you did
yesterdai
that morn i wa summon to see the princ joshua and dress hi
wound which although not of a seriou natur were veri pain the
moment that i enter the man presenc i notic a chang in hi face
like the rest of us i had alwai set thi fellow down as a mere poltroon
and windbag a blower of hi own trumpet as oliv had call him now
i got an insight into hi real natur which show me that although
he might be these thing and wors he wa also a veri determin and
danger person anim by ambit which he meant to satisfi at all
hazard
when i had done what i could for him and told him that in my opinion he
had no ill result to fear from hi hurt sinc the thick cloth he
wa wear at the time had probabl clean the lion paw of ani
poison that might have been on them he said
physician i desir privat word with you
i bow and he went on
the child of king hereditari ruler of thi land somewhat against the
advic of her council ha thought fit to emploi you and your gentil
companion in order that by your skill and certain art of which you ar
master you mai damag it ancient enemi the fung and in reward ha
promis to pai you well should you succe in your endeavour now i
wish you to understand that though you think yourselv great men and
mai for aught i know be great in your own countri here you ar but
servant like ani other mercenari whom it mai pleas us to hire
hi tone wa so offens that though it might have been wiser to keep
silent i could not help interrupt him
you us hard word princ i said let me then explain what is the
real pai for which we work and undergo some risk mine is the hope of
recov a son who is the slave of your enemi that of the captain
orm is the quest of adventur and war sinc be a rich man in hi
own countri he need no further wealth that of him whom you call black
window but whose name is higg is the pure love of learn in
england and throughout the west he is note for hi knowledg of dead
peopl their languag and custom and it is to studi these that he
ha undertaken so terribl a journei as for quick he is orm man
who ha known him from childhood an old soldier who ha serv with him
in war and come hither to be with the master whom he love
ah said joshua a servant a person of no degre who yet dare to
threaten me the premier princ of the abati to my face
in the presenc of death all men ar equal princ you act in a
fashion that might have brought hi lord who wa dare a desper
deed to a hideou doom
and what do i care about hi lord desper deed physician i see
that you set store by such thing and think those who accomplish them
great and wonder well we do not there is no savag among the
barbar fung would not do all that your orm doe and more just
becaus he is a savag we who ar civil we who ar cultiv
we who ar wise know better our live were given us to enjoi not to
throw awai or to lose at the sword point and therefor no doubt
you would call us coward
yet princ those who bear that titl of coward which you hold on of
honour ar apt to perish at the sword point the fung wait without
your gate o princ
and therefor o gentil we hire you to fight the fung still i
bear no grudg against your servant quick who is himself but a
whiteskin fung for he act accord to hi natur and i forgiv
him onli in the futur let him bewar and nowfor a greater matter
the child of king is beauti she is young and high spirit a new
face from anoth land mai perchanc touch her fanci but he ad
meaningli let the owner of that face rememb who she is and what
he is let him rememb that for ani outsid the circl of the ancient
blood to lift hi ey to the daughter of solomon is to earn death
death slow and cruel for himself and all who aid and abet him let him
rememb lastli that thi highborn ladi to whom he an unknown and
vagrant gentil dare to talk as equal to equal ha from childhood
been my affianc who will shortli be my wife although it mai pleas
her to seem to flout me after the fashion of maiden and that we abati
ar jealou of the honour of our women do you understand
ye princ i answer for by now my temper wa rous but i would
have you understand someth alsothat we ar men of a high race whose
arm stretch over half the world and that we differ from the littl
tribe of the abati whose fame is not known to us in thisthat we ar
jealou of our own honour and do not need to hire stranger to fight
the foe we fear to face next time i come to attend to your wound
o princ i trust that thei will be in front and not behind on word
more if you will be advis by me you will not threaten that captain
whom you call a gentil and a mercenari lest you should learn that it
is not alwai well to be a coward of blood howev ancient
then in a tower rage i left him feel that i had made a thorough
fool of myself but the truth wa that i could not sit still and hear
men such as my companion to sai noth of myself spoken of thu by
a bloat cur who call himself a princ and boast of hi own
poltrooneri he glower at me as i went and the men of hi parti who
hung about the end of the great room and in hi court glower at
me also clearli he wa a veri danger cur and i almost wish that
instead of threaten to slap hi face down in the tunnel quick had
broken hi neck and made an end of him
so did the other when i told them the stori although i think it open
their ey and especi those of oliv to the grave and grow
danger of the situat afterward he inform me that he had spoken of
the matter with maqueda and that she wa much frighten for our sake
and somewhat for her own joshua she said wa a man capabl of ani
crime who had at hi back the great major of the abati a jealou
mean and intoler race who made up in cun for what thei lack in
courag
yet as i saw well the peril of their situat did noth to separ
thi pair or to lessen their love inde rather did it seem to bind
them closer togeth and to make them more complet on in short
the tragedi took it appoint cours whilst we stood by and watch it
helplessli
on the afternoon of my angri interview with joshua we were summon to
a meet of the council whither we went not without some trepid
expect troubl troubl there wa but of a differ sort to that
which we fear scarc had we enter the great room where the child
of king wa seat in her chair of state surround by all the pomp and
ceremoni of her mimic court when the big door at the end of it were
open and through them march three graybeard men in white robe
whom we saw at onc were herald or ambassador from the fung these
men bow to the veil maqueda and turn toward where we stood in a
littl group apart bow to us also
but of joshua who wa there support by two servant for he could not
yet stand alon and the other notabl and priest of the abati thei
took not the slightest heed
speak said maqueda
ladi answer the spokesman of the embassi we ar sent by our
sultan barung son of barung ruler of the fung nation these ar the
word of barung o walda nagasta by the hand and the wit of the white
lord whom you have call to your aid you have of late done much evil
to the god harmac and to me hi servant you have destroi on of the
gate of my citi and with it mani of my peopl you have rescu a
prison out of my hand rob harmac of hi sacrific and therebi
bring hi wrath upon us you have slain sundri of the sacr beast
that ar the mouth of sacrific you have kill certain of the priest
and guard of harmac in a hole of the rock moreov my spi tell me
that you plan further ill against the god and against me now i send
to tell you that for these and other offenc i will make an end of the
peopl of the abati whom hitherto i have spare in a littl while i
marri my daughter to the white man that priest of harmac who is call
singer of egypt and who is said to be the son of the physician in
your servic but after i have celebr thi feast and my peopl have
finish the hoe of their crop i take up the sword in earnest nor
will i lai it down again until the abati ar no more
learn that last night after the holi beast had been slain and
the sacrific snatch awai the god harmac spoke to hi priest in
propheci and thi wa hi propheci that befor the gather in of the
harvest hi head should sleep abov the plain of mur we know not the
interpret of the sai but thi i know that befor the gather
of the harvest i or those who rule after me will lie down to sleep
within my citi of mur
now choosesurrend forthwith and save for the dog joshua who
the other dai tri to entrap me against the custom of peopl and ten
other whom i shall name i will spare the live of all of you though
joshua and these ten i will hang sinc thei ar not worthi to die by
the sword or resist and by harmac himself i swear that everi man among
the abati shall die save the white lord whom i honour becaus thei ar
brave and that servant of your who stood with them last night in the
den of lion and that everi woman shall be made a slave save you o
walda nagasta becaus of your great heart your answer o ladi of the
abati
now maqueda look around the face of her council and saw fear written
upon them all inde as we note mani of them shook in their terror
my answer will be short ambassador of barung she repli still i
am but on woman and it is fit that those who repres the peopl
should speak for the peopl my uncl joshua you ar the first of my
council what have you to sai ar you will to give up your life with
ten other whose name i do not know that there mai be peac between us
and the fung
what answer joshua with a splutter of rage do i live to hear a
walda nagasta suggest that the first princ of the land her uncl and
affianc husband should be surrend to our hereditari foe to be
hang like a wornout hound and do you o unknown ten who doubtless
stand in thi chamber live to hear it also
my uncl you do not i ask if such wa your wish that is all
then i answer that it is not my wish nor the wish of the ten nor the
wish of the abati nai we will fight the fung and destroi them and
of their beasthead idol harmac we will make block to build our
synagogu and stone to pave our road do you hear savag of fung
and assist by hi two servant he hobbl toward them grin in
their face
the envoi look him up and down with their quiet ey we hear and we
ar veri glad to hear their spokesman answer sinc we fung love
to settl our quarrel with the sword and not by treati but to you
joshua we sai make hast to die befor we enter mur sinc the rope is
not the onli mean of death whereof we know
veri solemnli the three ambassador salut first the child of king
and next ourselv then turn to go
kill them shout joshua thei have threaten and insult me the
princ
but no on lift a hand against the men who pass safe out of the
palac to the squar where an escort wait with their hors
chapter xiv
how pharaoh met shadrach
when the ambassador had gone at first there wa silenc a veri heavi
silenc sinc even the frivol abati felt that the hour wa big with
fate of a sudden howev the member of the council began to chatter
like so mani monkei each talk without listen to what hi
neighbour said till at length a gorgeous dress person i understood
that he wa a priest step forward and shout down the other
then he spoke in an excit and venom fashion he point out that we
gentil had brought all thi troubl upon mur sinc befor we came the
abati although threaten had live in peac and gloryh actual
us the word gloryfor gener but now we had stung the fung as
a hornet sting a bull and made them mad so that thei wish to toss
the abati he propos therefor that we should at onc be eject
from mur
at thi point i saw joshua whisper into the ear of a man who call
out
no no for then thei would go to their friend barung a savag like
themselv and have learn our secret would doubtless us them
against us i sai that thei must be kill instantli and he drew a
sword and wave it
quick walk up to the fellow and clap a pistol to hi head
drop that sword he said or youll never hear the end of the
stori and he obei whereupon quick came back
now maqueda began to speak quietli enough although i could see that
she wa quak with passion
these men ar our guest she said come hither to serv us do you
desir to murder our guest moreov of what us would that be on
thing alon can save us the destruct of the god of the fung
sinc accord to the ancient sai of that peopl when the idol is
destroi the fung will leav their citi of harmac moreov as to thi
new propheci of the priest of the idol that befor the gather in
of the harvest hi head shall sleep abov the plain of mur how can
that happen if it is destroi unless inde it mean that harmac shall
sleep in the heaven therefor what have you to fear from threat built
upon that which cannot happen
but can you destroi thi fals god harmac or dare you fight the
fung you know that it is not so for had it been so what need wa there
for me to send for these western and if you murder them will barung
therebi be appeas nai i tell you that be a brave and honour
man although our enemi he will becom ten time more wroth with you
than he wa befor and exact a vengeanc even more terribl i tell you
also that then you must find anoth walda nagasta to rule over you
sinc i maqueda will do so no more
that is imposs said some on you ar the last woman of the true
blood
then you can choos on of blood that is not true or elect a king
as the jew elect saul for if my guest ar butcher i shall die of
veri shame
these word of her seem to cow the council on of whom ask what
would she have them do
do she repli throw back her veil why be men rais an armi
of everi male who can carri a sword help the foreign and thei will
lead you to victori peopl of the abati would you be slaughter
would you see your women slave and your ancient name blot out from
the list of peopl
now some of them cri no
then save yourselv you ar still mani the stranger here have skill
in war thei can lead if you will follow be brave a while and i swear
to you that by harvest the abati shall sit in the citi of harmac and not
the fung in mur i have spoken now do what you will and rise from
her chair of state maqueda left the chamber motion to us to do
likewis
the end of all thi busi wa that a peac wa made between us and
the council of the abati after their pompou pedant fashion thei
swore solemnli on the roll of the law that thei would aid us in everi
wai to overcom the fung and even obei such militari order as we
might give them subject to the confirm of these order by a small
council of their gener in short be veri frighten for a time
thei forgot their hatr of us foreign
so a scheme of oper wa agre upon and some law pass by the
council the onli govern bodi among the abati for thei possess no
repres institut under which law a kind of conscript wa
establish for a while let me sai at onc that it met with the most
intens opposit the abati were agriculturalist who loath militari
servic from their childhood thei had heard of the immin of
invas but no actual invas had ever yet taken place the fung were
alwai without and thei were alwai within an inland isl the wall of
rock that thei thought impass be their sea which protect them
from danger
thei had no experi of slaughter and rapin their imagin were
not suffici strong to enabl them to understand what these thing
meant thei were lost in the petti of daili life and it press
local interest their home in flame thei themselv massacr their
women and children drag off to be the slave of the victor a poor
remnant left to die of starvat among the wast field or to becom
wild men of the rock all these thing thei look upon as a mere tale
a romanc such as their local poet repeat in the even of a
wet season dim and faroff event which might have happen to the
canaanit and jebusit and amalekit in the ancient dai whereof the
book of their law told them but which could never happen to them the
comfort abati in that book the israelit alwai conquer in the
end although the philistin alia fung sat at their gate for it
will be rememb that it includ no account of the final fall of
jerusalem and aw destruct of it citizen of which thei had
littl if ani knowledg
so it came about that our recruit parti perhap press gang would
be a better term were not well receiv i know it for thi branch of
the busi wa hand over to me of cours as advis to the abati
captain and on sever occas when ride round the villag on
the shore of their beauti lake we were met by shower of stone
and were even the object of activ attack which had to be put down with
bloodsh still an armi of five or six thousand men wa got togeth
somehow and form into camp whenc desert were incess onc
or twice accompani by the murder of offic
it opeless downright opeless doctor said quick to me drop
hi hs as he sometim did in the excit of the moment what can
on do with a crowd of pig everyon of them bent on bolt to hi own
sty or anywher except toward the enemi the sooner the fung get them
the better for all concern sai i and if it wasnt for our ladi
yonder quick alwai call maqueda after our ladi after it had been
impress upon him that her majesti wa an incorrect titl my advic
to the captain and you gentlemen would be get out of thi infern hole
as quick as your leg can carri you and let do a bit of hunt on
the wai home leav the abati to settl their own affair
you forget sergeant that i have a reason for stai in thi part of
the world and so perhap have the other for instanc the professor
is veri fond of those old skeleton down in the cave and i paus
ye doctor and the captain is veri fond of someth much better than
a skeleton and so ar we all well weve got to see it through but
somehow i dont think that everi on of us will have that luck though
it true that when a man ha live fairli straight accord to hi
light a few year more or less dont matter much on wai or the other
after all except you gentlemen who is there that will miss samuel
quick
then without wait for an answer draw himself up straight as a
ramrod he march off to assist some popinjai of abati offic whom
he hate and who hate him to instil the element of drill into a newli
rais compani leav me to wonder what fear or premonit fill
hi honest soul
but thi wa not quick princip work sinc for at least six hour
of everi dai he wa engag in help oliv in our great enterpris of
drive a tunnel from the end of the tomb of king deep into the solid
rock that form the base of the mighti idol of the fung the task
wa stupend and would inde have been imposs had not orm
conjectur that some passag had onc run from the extrem of the cave
toward the idol prove to be perfectli accur such a passag inde
wa found wall up at the back of the chair contain the bone of the
hunchback king it descend veri sharpli for a distanc of sever
hundr yard after which for anoth hundr yard or more it wall
and roof were so riven and shaki that for fear of accid we found
it necessari to timber them as we went
at last we came to a place where thei had fallen in altogeth shaken
down i presum by the great earthquak which had destroi so much
of the ancient cavec at thi spot if oliv instrument and
calcul could be trust we were within about two hundr feet
of the floor of the den of lion to which it seem probabl that the
passag onc led and of cours the question aros as to what should be
done
a council wa held to discuss thi problem at which maqueda and a few
of the abati notabl were present to these oliv explain that even
if that were possibl it would be useless to clear out the old passag
and at the end find ourselv onc more in the den of lion
what then is your plan ask maqueda
ladi he answer i your servant am instruct to attempt to
destroi the idol harmac by mean of the explos which we have
brought with us from england first i would ask you if you still cling
to that design
why should it be abandon inquir maqueda what have you against
it
two thing ladi as an act of war the deed seem useless sinc
suppos that the sphinx is shatter and a certain number of priest
and guard ar destroi how will that advanc your caus secondli
such destruct will be veri difficult if it can be done at all the
stuff we have with us it is true is of fear strength yet who can
be sure that there is enough of it to move thi mountain of hard rock
of which i cannot calcul the weight not have the measur or
ani knowledg of the size of the caviti within it bulk lastli if
the attempt is to be made a tunnel must be hollow of not less than
three hundr feet in length first downward and then upward into the
veri base of the idol and if thi is to be done within six week that
is by the night of the marriag of the daughter of barung the work
will be veri hard if inde it can be complet at all although
hundr of men labour dai and night
now maqueda thought a while then look up and said
friend you ar brave and skil tell us all your mind if you sat in
my place what would you do
ladi i would lead out everi ablebodi man and attack the citi of the
fung sai on the night of the great festiv when thei ar off their
guard i would blow in the gate of the citi of harmac and storm it and
drive awai the fung and afterward take possess of the idol and if
it is thought necessari destroi it piecem from within
now maqueda consult with her councillor who appear to be much
disturb at thi suggest and final call us back and gave us her
decis
these lord of the council she said speak with a ring of contempt
in her voic declar that your plan is mad and that thei will never
sanction it becaus the abati could not be persuad to undertak so
danger an enterpris as an attack upon the citi of harmac which
would end thei think in all of them be kill thei point out o
orm that the propheci is that the fung will leav the plain of harmac
when their god is destroi and not befor and that therefor it must
be destroi thei sai further o orm that for a year you and your
companion ar the sworn servant of the abati and that it is your
busi to receiv order not to give them also that the condit
upon which you earn your pai is that you destroi the idol of the fung
thi is the decis of the council spoken by the mouth of the princ
joshua who command further that you shall at onc set about the
busi to execut which you and your companion ar present here in
mur
is that your command also o child of king answer oliv
colour
sinc i also think that the abati can never be forc to attack the
citi of the fung it is o orm though the word in which it is couch
ar not my word
veri well o child of king i will do my best onli blame us not if
the end of thi matter is other than these advis of your expect
propheci ar twoedg sword to plai with and i do not believ that
a race of fight men like the fung will fly and leav you triumphant
just becaus a stone imag is shatter if that can be done in the time
and with the mean which we possess meanwhil i ask that you should
give me two hundr and fifti pick men of the mountain not of
the townspeopl under the captainci of japhet who must choos them to
assist us in our work
it shall be done she answer and we made our bow and went as we
pass through the council we heard joshua sai in a loud voic meant for
us to hear
thank be to god these hire gentil have been taught their place at
last
oliv turn on him so fierc that he recoil think that he wa
about to strike him
be care princ joshua he said that befor thi busi is
finish you ar not taught your which i think mai be lowli and he
look meaningli at the ground
so the labour began and it wa heavi inde as well as danger
fortun in addit to the picrat compound that quick call
azur sting bee we had brought with us a few case of dynamit
of which we now made us for blast purpos a hole wa drill in
the face of the tunnel and the charg insert then all retreat back
into the tomb of king till the cartridg had explod and the smoke
clear off which took a long while when our peopl advanc with iron
bar and basket and clear awai the dbri after which the process
must be repeat
oh the heat of that narrow hole deep in the bowel of the rock and
the reek of the stagnant air which sometim wa so bad that the light
would scarc burn inde after a hundr feet had been complet
we thought that it would be imposs to proce sinc two men di
of asphyxi and the other although thei were good fellow enough
refus to return into the tunnel at length howev orm and japhet
persuad some of the best of them to do so and shortli after thi the
atmospher improv veri much i suppos becaus we cut some cranni or
shaft which commun with the open air
there were other danger also notabl of the collaps of the whole
roof where the rock wa rotten as we found it to be in place then
it prove veri hard to deal with the water for onc or twice we
struck small spring impregn with copper or some other miner that
blister the feet and skin sinc everi drop of thi acid water had to
be carri out in wooden pail that difficulti we overcam at last by
sink a narrow well down to the level of the ancient tunnel of which i
have spoken as have been shaken in by the earthquak
thu we or rather oliv and quick with the mountain toil on
higg did hi best but after a while prove quit unabl to bear the
heat which becam too much for so stout a man the end of it wa that
he devot himself to the superintend of the remov of the rubbish
into the tomb of king the care of the store and so forth at least
that wa suppos to be hi busi but realli he emploi most of hi
time in draw and catalogu the object of antiqu and the group
of bone that were buri there and in explor the remain of the
underground citi in truth thi task of destruct wa most repel
to the poor professor
to think he said to us to think that i who all my life have
preach the iniqu of not conserv everi relic of the past should
now be emploi in attempt to obliter the most wonder object
ever fashion by the ancient it is enough to make a vandal weep and
i prai heaven that you mai not succe in your infam design what
doe it matter if the abati ar wipe out as lot of better peopl have
been befor them what doe it matter if we accompani them to oblivion
so long as that nobl sphinx is preserv to be the wonder of futur
gener well thank good at ani rate i have seen it which is
more probabl than ani of you will ever do there anoth brute is
dump hi rubbish over the skull of no 14
thu we labour continu each at hi differ task for the work
in the mine never stop oliv be in charg dure the dai and
quick at night for a whole week sinc on each sundai thei chang with
their gang quick take the dai shift and oliv the night or vice
versa sometim maqueda came down the cave to inspect progress
alwai i notic at those hour when oliv happen to be off duti
then on thi pretext or on that thei would wander awai togeth to visit
i know not what in the recess of the underground citi or elsewher
in vain did i warn them that their everi step wa dog and that
their everi word and action were note by spi who crept after them
continu sinc twice i caught on of these gentri in the act thei
were infatu and would not listen
at thi time oliv onli left the underground citi twice or thrice a
week to breath the fresh air for an hour or two in truth he had no
leisur for thi same reason he fit himself up a bed in what had
been a priest chamber or a sanctuari in the old templ and slept
there gener with no other guard but the great dog pharaoh hi
constant companion even in the recess of the mine
it wa curiou to see how thi faith beast accustom itself to the
dark and made it other sens especi that of smell serv
the purpos of ey as do the blind by degre too it learn all
the detail of the oper thu when the cartridg wa in place for
fire it would rise and begin to walk out of the tunnel even befor
the men in charg
on night the tragedi that i fear veri nearli happen and inde
must have happen had it not been for thi same hound pharaoh about
six oclock in the even oliv came off duti after an eighthour
shift in the tunnel leav higg in command for a littl while until
it wa time for quick to take charg i had been at work outsid all dai
in connect with the new conscript armi a regiment of which wa
in revolt becaus the men most of whom were what we should call
smallhold declar that thei want to go home to weed their crop
inde it had prove necessari for the child of king herself to be
summon to plead with them and condemn some of the ringlead to
punish
when at length thi busi wa over we left togeth and the poor
ladi exasper almost to mad sharpli refus the escort of ani
of her peopl request me to accompani her to the mine
at the mouth of the tunnel she met oliv as probabl she had arrang
to do and after he had report progress to her wander awai with him
as usual each of them carri a lamp into some recess of the buri
citi i follow them at a distanc not from curios or becaus i
wish to see more of the wonder of that citi whereof i wa heartili
sick but becaus i suspect that thei were be spi upon
the pair vanish round a corner that i knew end in a culdesac so
extinguish my lamp i sat down on a fallen column and wait till i
should see their light reappear when i propos to effect my retreat
whilst i sat thu think on mani thing and to tell the truth veri
depress in mind i heard a sound as of some on move and instantli
struck a match the light of it fell full upon the face of a man whom
i recogn at onc as a bodyserv of the princ joshua though
whether he wa pass me toward the pair or return from their
direct i could not be sure
what ar you do here i ask
what is that to you physician he answer
then the match burnt out and befor i could light anoth he had
vanish like a snake into a stone wall
my first impuls wa to warn maqueda and oliv that thei were be
watch but reflect that the busi wa awkward and that the spy
would doubtless have given over hi task for thi dai i left it alon
and went down to the tomb of the king to help higg just afterward
quick came on duti long befor hi time the fact be that he had no
confid in the professor as a director of mine oper when he
appear higg and i retreat from that close and filthi tunnel
and by wai of recreat put in an hour or so at the catalogu and
archolog research in which hi soul delight
if onli we could get all thi lot out of mur he said with a sweep of
hi hand we should be the most famou men in europ for at least three
dai and rich into the bargain
ptolemi i answer we shall be fortun if we get ourselv aliv
out of mur let alon these bone and ancient treasur and i told him
what i had seen that even
hi fat and kindli face grew anxiou
ah he said well i dont blame him should probabl do the same
myself if i got the chanc and so would youif you were twenti year
younger no i dont blame him or her either for the fact is that
although their race educ and circumst ar so differ thei
ar on of natur pair and while thei ar aliv noth will keep
them apart you might as well expect a magnet and a bit of iron to
remain separ on a sheet of notepap moreov thei give themselv
awai as peopl in that state alwai do the pursuit of archolog ha
it danger but it is a jolli sight safer than that of woman though it
did land me in a den of lion what go to happen old fellow
cant sai but i think it veri probabl that oliv will be murder
and that we shall follow the same road or if we ar lucki be onli
bundl out of mur well it time for dinner if i get a chanc i will
give them a hint
so we made our wai to the old templ in the great cave where we kept
our store and oliv had hi headquart here we found him wait
for us and our meal readi for food wa alwai brought to us by the
palac servant when we had eaten and these men had clear awai we
lit our pipe and fed the dog pharaoh upon the scrap that had been
reserv for him then i told oliv about the spy whom i had caught
track him and maqueda
well what of it he said colour in hi telltal fashion she
onli took me to see what she believ to be an ancient inscript on a
column in that northern aisl
then shed have done better to take me my boi said higg what wa
the charact like
dont know he answer guiltili she could not find it again
an awkward silenc follow which i broke
oliv i said i dont think you ought to go on sleep here alon
you have too mani enemi in thi place
rubbish he answer though it true pharaoh seem uneasi last
night and that onc i woke up and thought i heard footstep in the
court outsid i set them down to ghost in which i have almost come to
believ in thi haunt place and went to sleep again
ghost be blow said higg vulgarli if there were such thing i
have slept with too mani mummi not to see them that confound joshua
is the wizard who rais your ghost look here old boi he ad
let me camp with you tonight sinc quick must be in the tunnel and
adam ha to sleep outsid in case he is want on the armi busi
not a bit of it he answer you know you ar too asthmat to get
a wink in thi atmospher i wont hear of such a thing
then come and sleep with us in the guesthous
cant be done the sergeant ha got a veri nasti job down there about
on oclock and i promis to be handi in case he call me up and he
point to the portabl field telephon that fortun we had brought
with us from england which wa fix close by ad if onli that
silli thing had anoth few hundr yard of wire id come but you
see it hasnt and i must be in touch with the work
at thi moment the bell tinkl and orm made a jump for the receiv
through which for the next five minut he wa engag in give rapid
and to us quit unintellig direct
there you ar he said when he had replac the mouthpiec on it
hook if i hadnt been here thei would probabl have had the roof
of the tunnel down and kill some peopl no no i cant leav that
receiv unless i go back to the mine which i am too tire to do
howev dont you fret with a pistol a telephon and pharaoh im
safe enough and now good night you fellow had better be get home
as i must be up earli tomorrow and want to sleep while i can
on the follow morn about five oclock higg and i were awaken by
some on knock at our door i rose and open it whereon in walk
quick a grim and grimi figur for as hi soak cloth and soil
face told us he had but just left hi work in the mine
captain want to see you as soon as possibl gentlemen he said
what the matter sergeant ask higg as we got into our garment
youll see for yourself present professor wa the lacon repli
nor could we get anyth more out of him
five minut later we were advanc at a run through the dens dark
of the underground citi each of us carri a lamp i reach the ruin
of the old templ first for quick seem veri tire and lag behind
and in that atmospher higg wa scant of breath and could not travel
fast at the doorwai of the place where he slept stood the tall form
of oliv hold a lamp aloft evid he wa wait for us by hi
side sat the big yellow dog pharaoh that when he smelt us gambol
forward wag hi tail in greet
come here said orm in a low and solemn voic i have someth to
show you and he led the wai into the priest chamber or sanctuari
whatev it mai have been where he slept upon a rough nativemad
bedstead at the doorwai he halt lower the lamp he held and
point to someth dark on the floor to the right of hi bedstead
sai look
there lai a dead man and by hi side a great knife that evid had
fallen from hi hand at the first glanc we recognis the face which
by the wai wa singularli peac as though it were that of on
plung in deep sleep thi seem odd sinc the throat below wa
liter torn out
shadrach we said with on voic
shadrach it wa shadrach our former guid who had betrai us
shadrach who to save hi own life had shown us how to rescu higg
and for that servic been pardon as i think i mention shadrach and
no other
pussi seem to have been on the prowl and to have met a dog remark
quick
do you understand what ha happen ask oliv in a dry hard
voic perhap i had better explain befor anyth is move shadrach
must have crept in here last nighti dont know at what time for i
slept through it allfor purpos of hi own but he forgot hi old
enemi pharaoh and pharaoh kill him see hi throat when pharaoh
bite he doesnt growl and of cours shadrach could sai noth or
as he had drop hi knife for the matter of that do anyth either
when i wa woke up about an hour ago by the telephon bell the dog wa
fast asleep for he is accustom to that bell with hi head rest
upon the bodi of shadrach now why did shadrach come into my room at
night with a drawn knife in hi hand
doesnt seem a difficult question to answer repli higg in the
high voic which wa common to him when excit he came here to murder
you and pharaoh wa too quick for him that all that dog wa the
cheapest purchas you ever made friend oliv
ye answer orm he came here to murder meyou were right about
the risk after allbut what i wonder is who sent him
and so you mai go on wonder for the rest of your life captain
exclaim quick still i think we might guess if we tri
then new of what had happen wa sent to the palac and within littl
over an hour maqueda arriv accompani by joshua and sever other
member of her council when she saw and understood everyth she wa
horrifi and sternli ask joshua what he knew of thi busi of
cours he prove to be complet innoc and had not the slightest
idea of who had set the murder on to work thi deed of dark
nor had anybodi els the gener suggest be that shadrach had
attempt it out of reveng and met with the due reward of hi crime
onli that dai poor pharaoh wa poison well he had done hi work and
hi memori is bless
chapter xv
sergeant quick ha a presenti
from thi time forward all of us and especi oliv were guard
night and dai by pick men who it wa believ could not be corrupt
as a consequ the tsar of russia scarc lead a life more irksom
than our becam at mur of privaci there wa none left to us sinc
sentri and detect lurk at everi corner while taster were
oblig to eat of each dish and drink from each cup befor it touch
our lip lest our fate should be that of pharaoh whose loss we mourn
as much as though the poor dog had been some belov human be
most of all wa it irksom i think to oliv and maqueda whose
opportun of meet were much curtail by the exig of thi
rigid espionag who can murmur sweet noth to hi ador when two
soldier arm to the teeth have been instruct never to let him out
of their sight particularli is thi so if the ador happen to be the
ruler of those soldier to whom the person guard ha no right to
be make himself agreeabl for when off duti even the most faith
guardian ar apt to talk of cours the result wa that the pair took
risk which did not escap observ inde their intim relat
becam a matter of gossip throughout the land
still annoi as thei might be these precaut succeed for none
of us were poison or got our throat cut although we were constantli
the victim of mysteri accid thu a heavi rock roll down upon
us when we sat togeth on even upon the hillsid and a flight
of arrow pass between us while we were ride along the edg of
a thicket by on of which higgss hors wa kill onli when the
mountain and the thicket were search no on could be found moreov
a great plot against us wa discov in which some of the lord
and priest were implic but such wa the state of feel in the
countri that beyond warn them privat that their machin were
known maqueda did not dare to take proceed against these men
a littl later on thing mend so far as we were concern for the
follow reason on dai two shepherd arriv at the palac with some
of their companion sai that thei had new to commun on be
question these peasant aver that while thei were herd their
goat upon the western cliff mani mile awai suddenli on the top of
the hill appear a bodi of fifteen fung who bound and blindfold
them tell them in mock languag to take a messag to the council
and to the white men
thi wa the messag that thei had better make hast to destroi the
god harmac sinc otherwis hi head would move to mur accord to the
propheci and that when it did so the fung would follow as thei knew
how to do then thei set the two men on a rock where thei could be
seen and on the follow morn were in fact found by some of their
fellow those who accompani them to the court and corrobor thi
stori
of cours the matter wa duli investig but as i know for i went
with the search parti when we got to the place no trace of the fung
could be found except on of their spear of which the handl had been
driven into the earth and the blade point toward mur evid
in threat or defianc no other token of them remain for as it
happen a heavi rain had fallen and obliter their footprint
which in ani case must have been faint on thi rocki ground
notwithstand the most dilig search by skill men their mode of
approach and retreat remain a mysteri as inde it doe to thi
dai the onli place where it wa suppos to be possibl to scale
the precipic of mur were watch continu so that thei could have
climb up by none of these the infer wa therefor that the fung
had discov some unknown path and if fifteen men could climb that
path why not fifteen thousand
onli where wa thi path in vain were great reward in land and
honour offer to him who should discov it for although such
discoveri were continu report on investig these were
found to be invent or mare nest noth but a bird could have
travel by such road
then at last we saw the abati thoroughli frighten for with
addit the stori soon pass from mouth to mouth till the whole
peopl talk of noth els it wa as though we english learn that
a huge foreign armi had suddenli land on our shore and have cut
the wire and seiz the railwai wa march upon london the effect
of such tide upon a nation that alwai believ invas to be
imposs mai easili be imagin onli i hope that we should take them
better than did the abati
their swagger their selfconfid their talk about the rocki wall
of mur evapor in an hour now it wa onli of the disciplin and
terribl regiment of the fung among whom everi man wa train to war
and of what would happen to them the civil and domest abati
a peacelov peopl who rightli enough as thei declar had refus
all martial burden should these regiment suddenli appear in their
midst thei cri out that thei were betrayedthei clamour for the
blood of certain of the councillor that carpet knight joshua lost
popular for a while while maqueda who wa known alwai to have been
in favour of conscript and perfect readi to repel attack gain
what he had lost
leav their farm thei crowd togeth into the town and villag
where thei made what in south africa ar call laager religion which
practic had been dead among them for thei retain but few trace
of the jewish faith if inde thei had ever realli practis it
becam the craze of the hour priest were at a premium sheep and
cattl were sacrif it wa even said that after the fashion of
their foe the fung some human be share the same fate at ani
rate the almighti wa importun hourli to destroi the hate fung and
to protect hi peopleth abatifrom the result of their own base
selfish and cowardli neglect
well the world ha seen such exhibit befor todai and will
doubtless see more of them in the instanc of greater peopl who allow
luxuri and pleasureseek to sap their strength and manhood
the upshot of it all wa that the abati becam obsess with the
sai of the fung scout to the shepherd which after all wa but
a repetit of that of their envoi deliv to the council a littl
while befor that thei should hasten to destroi the idol harmac lest
he should move himself to mur how an idol of such proport or even
it head could move at all thei did not stop to inquir it wa obviou
to them howev that if he wa destroi there would be noth to
move and further that we gentil were the onli person who could
possibl effect such destruct so we also becam popular for a littl
while everybodi wa pleasant and flatter useverybodi even joshua
bow when we approach and took a most live interest in the
progress of our work which mani deput and promin individu
urg us to expedit
better still the untoward accid such as those i have mention
ceas our dog for we had obtain some other were no longer
poison rock that appear fix did not fall no arrow whistl
among us when we went out ride we even found it safe occasion to
dispens with our guard sinc it wa everi on interest to keep us
alivefor the present still i for on wa not deceiv for a singl
moment and in season and out of season warn the other that the wind
would soon blow again from a less favour quarter
we work we work we work heaven alon know how we did work
think of the task which after all wa onli on of sever a tunnel
must be bore for i forget how far through virgin rock with the
help of inadequ tool and unskil labour and thi tunnel must be
finish by a certain date a hundr unexpect difficulti aros and
on by on were conquer great danger must be run and were avoid
while the respons of thi tremend engin feat lai upon
the shoulder of a singl individu oliv orm who although he had
been educ as an engin had no great practic experi of such
enterpris
truli the occas make the man for orm rose to it in a wai that
i can onli call heroic when he wa not actual in the tunnel he wa
labour at hi calcul of which mani must be made or take
level with such instrument as he had for if there prove to be the
slightest error all thi toil would be in vain and result onli in the
blow of a useless hole through a mass of rock then there wa a
great question as to the effect which would be produc by the amount of
explos at hi dispos sinc terribl as might be the forc of the
stuff unless it were scientif place and distribut it would
assuredli fail to accomplish the desir end
at last after superhuman effort the mine wa finish our stock of
concentr explos about four full camel load of it wa set in
as mani separ chamber each of them just larg enough to receiv the
charg hollow in the primval rock from which the idol had been hewn
these chamber were about twenti feet from each other although if there
had been time to prolong the tunnel the distanc should have been
at least forti in order to give the stuff a wider rang of action
accord to oliv mathemat reckon thei were cut in the exact
centr of the base of the idol and about thirti feet below the actual
bodi of the crouch sphinx as a matter of fact thi reckon wa
wrong in sever particular the charg have been set farther
toward the east or head of the sphinx and higher up in the base than
he suppos when it is rememb that he had found no opportun
of measur the monument which practic we had onli seen onc from
behind under condit not favour to accuraci in such respect or
of know it actual length and depth these trifl error were not
remark
what wa remark is that hi gener plan of oper found upon
a mere hypothet estim should have prove as accur as it did
at length all wa prepar and the deadli castiron flask had been
pack in sand togeth with dynamit cartridg the necessari
deton electr wire and so forth an anxiou and inde aw
task execut entir in that stifl atmospher by the hand of orm
and quick then began anoth labour that of the fill in of the
tunnel thi it seem wa necessari or so i understood lest the
expand gase follow the line of least resist should blow
back as it were through the venthol what made that task the more
difficult wa the need of cut a littl channel in the rock to
contain the wire and therebi lessen the risk of the fractur of these
wire in the cours of the buildingup process of cours if by ani
accid thi should happen the circuit would be sever and no
explos would follow when the electr batteri wa set to work
the arrang wa that the mine should be fire on the night of
that full moon on which we had been told and spi confirm the
inform the feast of the marriag of barung daughter to my son
would be celebr in the citi of harmac thi date wa fix becaus
the sultan had announc that so soon as that festiv which coincid
with the conclus of the harvest wa end he meant to deliv hi
attack on mur
also we were anxiou that it should be adher to for anoth reason
sinc we knew that on thi dai but a small number of priest and guard
would be left in charg of the idol and my son could not be among them
now whatev mai have been the view of the abati we as christian who
bore them no malic did not at all desir to destroi an enorm number
of innoc fung as might have happen if we had fire our mine when
the peopl were gather to sacrific to their god
the fatal dai arriv at last all wa complet save for the block
of the passag which still went on or rather wa be reinforc by
the pile up of loos rock against it mouth at which a hundr or so
men labour incessantli the fire wire had been led into that littl
chamber in the old templ where the dog pharaoh tore out the throat of
shadrach and no inch of them wa left unguard for fear of accid or
treacheri
the electr batteriestwo of them in case on should failhad been
test but not connect with the wire there thei stood upon the
floor look innoc enough and we four sat round them like wizard
round their magic pot who await the work of some spell we were not
cheer who could be under so intens a strain orm inde who
had grown pale and thin with continu labour of mind and bodi seem
quit worn out he could not eat nor smoke and with difficulti i
persuad him to drink some of the nativ wine he would not even go to
look at the complet of the work or to test the wire
you can see to it he said i have done all i can now thing must
take their chanc
after our middai meal he lai down and slept quit soundli for sever
hour about four oclock those who were labour at the pile up of
dbri over the mouth of the tunnel complet their task and in charg
of quick were march out of the underground citi
then higg and i took lamp and went along the length of the wire
which lai in a littl trench cover over with dust remov the dust
and inspect them at interv discov noth amiss we return
to the old templ and at it doorwai met the mountain japhet who
throughout all these proceed had been our prop and stai inde
without hi help and that of hi author over the abati the mine could
never have been complet at ani rate within the time
the light of the lamp show that hi face wa veri anxiou
what is the matter i ask
o physician he answer i have word for the ear of the captain
orm be pleas to lead me to him
we explain that he slept and could not be disturb but japhet onli
answer as befor ad
come you with me my word ar for your ear as well as hi
so we went into the littl room and awok oliv who sprang up in a
great fright think that someth untoward had happen at the mine
what wrong he ask of japhet have the fung cut the wire
nai o orm a wors thing i have discov that the princ joshua
ha laid a plot to steal awai herwhosenameishigh
what do you mean set out all the stori japhet said oliv
it is short lord i have some friend on of whomh is of my own
blood but ask me not hi namei in the servic of the princ we
drank a cup of wine togeth which i need and i suppos it loos
hi tongu at ani rate he told me and i believ him thi is the
stori for hi own sake and that of the peopl the princ desir that
you should destroi the idol of fung and therefor he ha kept hi
hand off you of late yet should you succe he doe not know what mai
happen he fear lest the abati in their gratitud should set you up as
great men
then he is an ass interrupt quick for the abati have no
gratitud
he fear went on japhet other thing also for instanc that the
child of king mai express that gratitud by a mark of her signal favour
toward on of you and he stare at orm who turn hi head asid
now the princ is affianc to thi great ladi whom he desir to wed
for two reason first becaus thi marriag will make him the chief
man amongst the abati and secondli becaus of late he ha come to
think that he love her whom he is afraid that he mai lose so he ha
set a snare
what snare ask on of us for japhet paus
i dont know answer japhet and i do not think that my friend knew
either or if he did he would not tell me but i understand the plot
is that the child of king is to be carri off to the princ joshua
castl at the other end of the lake six hour ride awai and there be
forc to marri him at onc
inde said orm and when is all thi to happen
i dont know lord i know noth except what my friend told me which
i thought it right to commun to you instantli i ask him the
time howev and he said that he believ the date wa fix for on
night after next sabbath
next sabbath is five dai henc so that thi matter doe not seem to
be veri press remark oliv with a sigh of relief ar you sure
that you can trust your friend japhet
no lord i am not sure especi as i have alwai known him to be a
liar still i thought that i ought to tell you
veri kind of you japhet but i wish that you had let me have my sleep
out first now go down the line and see that all is right then return
and report
japhet salut in hi nativ fashion and went
what do you think of thi stori ask oliv as soon as he wa out
of hear
all bosh answer higg the place is full of talk and rumour and
thi is on of them
he paus and look at me
oh i said i agre with higg if japhet friend had realli
anyth to tell he would have told it in more detail i daresai there
ar a good mani thing joshua would like to do but i expect he will
stop there at ani rate for the present if you take my advic you will
sai noth of the matter especi to maqueda
then we ar all agre but what ar you think of sergeant
ask oliv address quick who stood in a corner of the room lost
appar in contempl of the floor
i captain he repli come to attent well beg their
pardon i wa think that i dont hold with these gentlemen except in
so far that i should sai noth of thi job to our ladi who ha plenti
to bother her just now and wont need to be frighten as well still
there mai be someth in it for though that japhet is stupid he
honest and honest men sometim get hold of the right end of the stick
at least he believ there is someth and that what weigh with
me
well if that your opinion what best to be done sergeant i agre
that the child of king should not be told and i shant leav thi
place till after ten oclock tonight at the earliest if we stick to
our plan as we had better do for all that stuff in the tunnel want
a littl time to settl and for other reason what ar you draw
there and he point to the floor in the dust of which quick wa
trace someth with hi finger
a plan of our ladi privat room captain she told you she wa go
to rest at sundown didnt she or earlier for she wa up most of last
night and want to get a few hour sleep beforesometh happen
well her bedchamb is there isnt it and anoth befor it in
which her maid sleep and noth behind except a high wall and a ditch
which cannot be climb
that quit true interrupt higg i got leav to make a plan
of the palac onli there is a passag six feet wide and twenti long
lead from the guard chamber to the ladi anteroom
just so professor and that passag ha a turn in it if i rememb
right so that two wellarm men could hold it against quit a lot
suppos now that you and i professor should go and take a nap in
that guardroom which will be empti for the watch is set at the palac
gate we shant be want here sinc if the captain cant touch off
that mine no on can with the doctor to help him just in case anyth
goe wrong and japhet guard the line i daresai there noth
in thi yarn but who know there might be and then we should blame
ourselv what do you sai professor
i oh ill do anyth you wish though i should rather have like to
climb the cliff and watch what happen
youd see noth higg interrupt oliv except perhap the
reflect of a flash in the sky so if you dont mind i wish you
would go with the sergeant somehow although i am quit certain that
we ought not to alarm maqueda i am not easi about her and if you two
fellow were there i should know she wa all right and it would be a
weight off my mind
that settl it said higg well be off present look here give
us that portabl telephon which is of no us anywher els now the
wire will reach to the palac and if the machin work all right we can
talk to you and tell each other how thing ar go on
ten minut later thei had made their prepar quick step up to
oliv and stood at attent sai
readi to march ani more order captain
i think not sergeant he answer lift hi ey from the littl
batteri that he wa watch as though thei were live thing you
know the arrang at ten oclockthat is about two hour hencei
touch thi switch whatev happen it must not be done befor for fear
lest the doctor son should not have left the idol to sai noth of
all the other poor beggar the spi sai that the marriag feast will
not be celebr until at least three hour after moonris
and that what i heard when i wa a prison interrupt higg
i daresai answer orm but it is alwai well to allow a margin
in case the process should be delai or someth so until ten
oclock iv got to stop where i am and you mai be sure doctor that
under no circumst shall i fire the mine befor that hour as inde
you will be here to see after that i cant sai what will happen but
if we dont appear you two had better come to look for usin case
of accid you know do your best at your end accord to
circumst the doctor and i will do our best at our i think that
is all sergeant report yourselv by the telephon if the wire is long
enough and it will work which i daresai it wont and anywai look out
for us about halfpast ten goodby
goodby captain answer quick then stretch out hi hand
shook that of orm and without anoth word took hi lamp and left the
chamber
an impuls prompt me to follow him leav orm and higg discuss
someth befor thei part when he had walk about fifti yard in
the aw silenc of that vast underground town of which the ruin
tenement yawn on either side of us the sergeant stop and said
suddenli
you dont believ in presenti do you doctor
not a bit i answer
glad of it doctor still i have got a bad on now and it is that i
shant see the captain or you ani more

no doctor for me i think you ar both all right and the professor
too it my name thei ar call up aloft or so it seem to me well
i dont care much for though no saint i have tri to do my duti
and if it is done it done if it written it got to come to pass
hasnt it for everyth is written down for us long befor we begin
or so iv alwai thought still ill griev to part from the captain
see that i nurs him as a child and id have like to know him well
out of thi hole and safe marri to that sweet ladi first though i
dont doubt that it will be so
nonsens sergeant i said sharpli you ar not yourself all thi
work and anxieti ha got on your nerv
as it well might doctor not but i daresai that true anyhow if the
other is the true thing and you should all see old england again with
some of the stuff in that deadhous iv got three niec live down
at home whom you might rememb dont sai noth of what i told you to
the captain till thi night game is plai see that it might upset
him and hell need to keep cool up to ten oclock and afterward too
perhap onli if we shouldnt meet again sai that samuel quick sent him
hi duti and god bless and the same on yourself doctor and your
son too and now here come the professor so goodby
a minut later thei had left me and i stood watch them until the two
star of light from their lantern vanish into the black
chapter xvi
harmac come to mur
slowli and in veri bad spirit i retrac my step to the old templ
follow the line of the telephon wire which higg and quick had
unreel as thei went in the sergeant prognost of evil i
had no particular belief as thei seem to me to be born of the
circumst which surround us and in differ wai affect all
our mind even that of the buoyant higg
to take my own case for instanc here i wa about to assist in an act
which for aught i knew might involv the destruct of my onli son it
wa true we believ that thi wa the night of hi marriag at the town
of harmac some mile awai and that the tale of our spi support
thi inform but how could we be sure that the date or the place
of the ceremoni had not been chang at the last moment suppos
for instanc that it wa held not in the town as arrang but in the
court of the idol and that the fear activ of the fieri agent
which we were about to wake to life should sweep the celebr into
nothing
the thought made me turn cold and yet the deed must be done roderick
must take hi chanc and if all were well and he escap that danger
were there not wors behind think of him a christian man the husband
of a savag woman who worship a stone imag with a lion head bound
to her and her tribe a state prison trebli guard whom so far
as i could see there would be no hope of rescu it wa aw then
there were other complic if the plan succeed and the idol wa
destroi my own belief wa that the fung must therebi be exasper
evid thei knew some road into thi stronghold it would be us
thei would pour their thousand up it a gener massacr would follow
of which justli we should be the first victim
i reach the chamber where oliv sat brood alon for japhet wa
patrol the line
i am not happi about maqueda doctor he said to me i am afraid
there is someth in that stori she want to be with us inde she
beg to be allow to come almost with tear but i wouldnt have it
sinc accid mai alwai happen the vibrat might shake in the roof
or someth in fact i dont think you should be here why dont you
go awai and leav me
i answer that noth would induc me to do so for such a job should
not be left to on man
no your right he said i might faint or lose my head or anyth
i wish now that we had arrang to send the spark from the palac
which perhap we might have done by join the telephon wire on to
the other but to tell you the truth im afraid of the batteri
the cell ar new but veri weak for time and the climat have affect
them and i thought it possibl the extra differ might make the
differ and that thei would fail to work that why i fix thi as
the fire point hullo there the bell what have thei got to sai
i snatch the receiv and present heard the cheer voic of
higg announc that thei had arriv safe in the littl anteroom to
maqueda privat apart
the palac seem veri empti he ad we onli met on sentri for i
think that everybodi els except maqueda and a few of her ladi
have clear out be afraid lest rock should fall on them when the
explos occur
did the man sai so i ask of higg
ye someth of that sort also he want to forbid us to come here
sai that it wa against the princ joshua order that we gentil
should approach the privat apart of the child of king well we
soon settl that and he bolt where to oh i dont know to report
he said
how quick i ask
much the same as usual in fact he is sai hi prayer in the
corner look like a melancholi brigand with rifl revolv and
knive stuck all over him i wish he wouldnt sai hi prayer ad
higg and hi voic reach me in an indign squeak it make me
feel uncomfort as though i ought to join him but not have been
brought up a dissent or a moslem i cant prai in public as he doe
hullo wait a minut will you
then follow a longish paus and after it higgss voic again
it all right it said onli on of maqueda ladi who had heard
us and come to see who we were when she learn i expect she will join
us here as the girl sai she nervou and cant sleep
higg prove right in hi anticip for in about ten minut we
were rung up again thi time by maqueda herself whereon i hand the
receiv to oliv and retir to the other end of the room
nor to tell the truth wa i sorri for the interrupt sinc it
cheer up oliv and help to pass the time
the next thing worth tell that happen wa that an hour or more
later japhet arriv look veri frighten we ask him our usual
question if anyth wa wrong with the wire with a groan he answer
no the wire seem all right but he had met a ghost
what ghost you donkei i said
the ghost of on of the dead king o physician yonder in the burial
cave it wa he with the bent bone who sit in the farthest chair onli
he had put some flesh on hi bone and i tell you he look fear a
veri fierc man or rather ghost
inde and did he sai anyth to you japhet
oh ye plenti o physician onli i could not understand it all
becaus hi languag wa somewhat differ to mine and he spat out
hi word as a green log spit out spark i think that he ask me
howev how my miser peopl dare to destroi hi god harmac i
answer that i wa onli a servant and did not know ad that he
should put hi question to you
and what did he sai to that japhet
i think he said that harmac would come to mur and settl hi account
with the abati and that the foreign men would be wise to fly fast and
far that all i understood ask me no more who would not return into
that cave to be made a princ
he got hold of what barung envoi told us said oliv
indiffer and no wonder thi place is enough to make anybodi see
ghost ill repeat it to maqueda it will amus her
i wouldnt if i were you i answer for it isnt exactli a cheer
yarn and perhap she afraid of ghost too also and i point
to the watch that lai on the tabl besid the batteri it is five
minut to ten
oh that last five minut it seem as mani centuri like stone
statu we sat each of us lost in hi own thought though for my part
the power of clear think appear to have left me vision of a sort
flow over my mind without sink into it as water flow over marbl
all i could do wa fix my ey on the face of that watch of which in
the flicker lamplight the secondhand seem to my excit fanci to
grow enorm and jump from on side of the room to the other
orm began to count aloud on two three four fivenow and
almost simultan he touch the knob first of on batteri and next
of the other befor hi finger press the lefthand knob i felt the
solid rock beneath us surgeno other word convei it movement then
the great stone crosspiec weigh sever ton that wa set as
a transom abov the tall door of our room dislodg itself and fell
quit gentli into the doorwai which it complet block
other rock fell also at a distanc make a great nois and somehow
i found myself on the ground my stool had slid awai from me next
follow a muffl aw roar and with it came a blast of wind blow
where wind never blew befor sinc the begin of the world that with
a terribl wail howl itself to silenc in the thousand recess of
the cave citi as it pass our lamp went out lastli quit a minut
later i should think there wa a thud as though someth of enorm
weight had fallen on the surfac of the earth far abov us
then all wa as it had been all wa dark and utter quietud
well that over said oliv in a strain voic which sound veri
small and far awai through that thick dark all over for good or
ill i neednt have been anxiou the first batteri wa strong enough
for i felt the mine spring as i touch the second i wonder he went
on as though speak to himself what amount of damag nearli a ton
and a half of that aw azoimid compound ha done to the old sphinx
accord to my calcul it ought to have been enough to break the
thing up if we could have spread the charg more but as it is i
am by no mean certain it mai onli have driven a hole in it bulk
especi if there were hollow through which the gase could run
well with luck we mai know more about it later strike a match adam
and light those lamp why what that listen
as he spoke from somewher came a seri of tini nois that
though thei were so faint and small suggest rifl fire at a great
distanc crack crack crack went the infinitesim nois
i grope about and find the receiv of the field telephon set
it to my ear in an instant all grew plain to me gun were be fire
near the other end of the wire and the transmitt wa send us the
sound of them veri faintli but with distinct i could hear higgss
high voic sai look out sergeant there anoth rush come
and quick answer shoot low professor for the lord sake shoot
low you ar empti sir load up load up here a clip of cartridg
dont fire too fast ah that devil got me but iv got him hell
never throw anoth spear
thei ar be attack i exclaim quick is wound now maqueda
is talk to you she sai oliv come joshua men assail me
oliv come
then follow a great sound of shout answer by more shot and just
as orm snatch the receiv from my hand the wire went dead in vain
he call down it in an agon voic as well might he have address
the planet saturn
the wire cut he exclaim dash down the receiv and seiz
the lantern which japhet had just succeed in relight come
on there murder be done and he sprang to the doorwai onli to
stagger back again from the great stone with which it wa block
good god he scream were shut in how can we get out how can
we get out and he began to run round and round the room and even to
spring at the wall like a frighten cat thrice he sprang strive to
climb to the cope for the place had no roof each time fall back
sinc it wa too high for him to grasp i caught him round the middl
and held him by main forc although he struck at me
be quiet i said do you want to kill yourself you will be no good
dead or maim let me think
meanwhil japhet wa act on hi own account for he too had heard
the tini omin sound given out by the telephon and guess their
purport first he ran to the massiv transom that block the doorwai
and push it wa useless not even an eleph could have stir it
then he step back examin it carefulli
i think it can be climb physician he said help me now and he
motion to me to take on end of the heavi tabl on which the batteri
stood we drag it to the doorwai and see hi purpos oliv
jump on to it with him then at japhet direct while i support
the tabl to prevent it overset orm rest hi forehead
against the stone make what schoolboi call a back up which the
mountain climb activ until he stood upon hi shoulder and
by stretch himself wa abl to grasp the end of the fallen transom
next while i held up the lamp to give him light he grip the
rough of the hewn stone with hi toe and in a few moment wa
upon the cope of the wall twenti feet or more abov the floor line
the rest wa compar easi for take off hi linen robe japhet
knot it onc or twice and let it down to us by the help of thi
improvis rope with orm support me beneath i too wa drag
up to the cope of the wall then both of us pull up oliv who
without a word swung himself over the wall hang to japhet arm
and loos hi hold drop to the ground on the farther side next
came my turn it wa a long fall and had not oliv caught me i think
that i should have hurt myself as it wa the breath wa shaken out
of me lastli japhet swung himself down land lightli as a cat the
lamp he had alreadi drop to us and in anoth minut thei were all
light and we were speed down the great cavern
be care i cri there mai be fallen rock about
as it happen i wa right for at that moment oliv struck hi leg
against on of them and fell cut himself a good deal in a moment
he wa up again but after thi our progress grew slow for hundr of
ton of stone had been shaken from the roof and block the path also
whole build of the ancient and underground citi had been thrown
down although these were mostli blown inward by the rush of air at
length we came to the end of the cave and halt dismai for here
where the blast of the explos had been brought to a full stop the
place seem to be crowd with rock which it had roll befor it
my god i believ we ar shut in exclaim oliv in despair
but japhet lantern in hand wa alreadi leap from block to block
and present from the top of the dbri call to us to come to him
i think there is a road left though a bad on lord he said and
point to a jag welllik hole blown out as i believ by the
recoil of the blast with difficulti and danger for mani of the pile
up stone were loos we climb down thi place and at it bottom
squeez ourselv through a narrow apertur on to the floor of the
cave prai that the huge door which led to the passag beyond might
not be jam sinc if it were as we knew well our small strength
would not avail to move it happili thi fear at least prove
groundless sinc it open outward and the forc of the compress air
had torn it from it massiv stone hing and thrown it shatter to the
ground
we scrambl over it and advanc down the passag our revolv
in our hand we reach the audienc hall which wa empti and in
dark we turn to the left cross variou chamber and in the
last of them through which on of the gate of the palac could be
approach met with the first sign of the tragedi for there were
bloodstain on the floor
orm point to them as he hurri on and suddenli a man leapt out of
the dark as a buck leap from a bush and ran past us hold hi
hand to hi side where evid he had some grievou hurt now we
enter the corridor lead to the privat apart of the child of
king and found ourselv walk on the bodi of dead and dy men
on of the former i observ as on doe notic littl thing at such
a moment held in hi hand the broken wire of the field telephon i
presum that he had snatch and sever it in hi death pang at the
moment when commun ceas between us and the palac
we rush into the littl antechamb in which light were burn and
there saw a sight that i for on never shall forget
in the foreground lai more dead men all of them wear the liveri of
princ joshua beyond wa sergeant quick seat on a chair he seem
to be liter hack to piec an arrow that no on had attempt to
remov wa fast in hi shoulder hi head which maqueda wa spong
with wet clothswel i will not describ hi wound
lean against the wall near by stood higg also bleed and
appar quit exhaust behind besid maqueda herself were two or
three of her ladi wring their hand and weep in face of thi
terribl spectacl we came to a sudden halt no word wa spoken of by
ani on for the power of speech had left us
the dy quick open hi ey lift hi hand upon which there wa
a ghastli swordcut to hi forehead as though to shade them from the
lightah how well i recal that pathet motionand from beneath thi
screen stare at us a while then he rose from the chair touch hi
throat to show that he could not speak as i suppos salut orm
turn and point to maqueda and with a triumphant smile sank down
anddi
such wa the nobl end of sergeant quick
to describ what follow is not easi for the scene wa confus also
shock and sorrow have blur it recollect in my mind i rememb
maqueda and orm fall into each other arm befor everybodi
i rememb her draw herself up in that imperi wai of her and
sai as she point to the bodi of quick
there li on who ha shown us how to die thi countryman of your
wa a hero o oliv and you should hold hi memori in honour sinc he
save me from wors than death
what the stori ask orm of higg
a simpl on enough he answer we got here all right as we told
you over the wire then maqueda talk to you for a long while until
you rang off sai you want to speak to japhet after that at ten
oclock precis we heard the thud of the explos next as we were
prepar to go out to see what had happen joshua arriv alon
announc that the idol harmac had been destroi and demand that
the child of king for state reason should accompani him to hi own
castl she declin and as he insist i took it upon myself to kick
him out of the place he retir and we saw no more of him but a few
minut later there came a shower of arrow down the passag and after
them a rush of men who call death to the gentil rescu the
rose
so we began to shoot and knock over a lot of them but quick got
that arrow through hi shoulder three time thei came on like that and
three time we drove them back at last our cartridg ran low and we
onli had our revolv left which we empti into them thei hung a
moment but move forward again and all seem up
then quick went mad he snatch the sword of a dead abati and ran at
them roar like a bull thei hack and cut at him but the end of
it wa that he drove them right out of the passag while i follow
fire past him
well those who were left of the blackguard bolt and when thei had
gone the sergeant tumbl down the women and i carri him back here
but he never said anoth word and at last you turn up now he
gone god rest him for if ever there wa a hero in thi world he wa
christen samuel quick and turn asid the professor push up
the blue spectacl he alwai wore on to hi forehead and wipe hi
ey with the back of hi hand
with grief more bitter than i can describ we lift up the bodi of the
gallant quick and bear it into maqueda privat apart place
it on her own bed for she insist that the man who had di to protect
her should be laid nowher els it wa strang to see the grim old
soldier whose face now that i had wash hi wound look calm and
even beauti laid out to sleep hi last sleep upon the couch of the
child of king that bed i rememb wa a rich and splendid thing
made of some black wood inlaid with scroll of gold and have hung
about it curtain of white net embroid with golden star such as
maqueda wore upon her offici veil
there upon the scent pillow and silken coverlet we set our burden
down the workworn hand clasp upon the breast in an attitud of
prayer and on by on bid our farewel to thi faith and upright
man whose face as it chanc we were never to see again except in
the glass of memori well he had di as he had live and would have
wish to diedo hi duti and in war and so we left him peac be
to hi honour spirit
in the bloodstain anteroom while i dress and stitch up the
professor wound a swordcut on the head an arrowgraz along the
face and a spearprick in the thigh none of them happili at all deep
or danger we held a brief council
friend said maqueda who wa lean on her lover arm it is
not safe that we should stop here my uncl plot ha fail for the
moment but it wa onli a small and secret thing i think that soon he
will return again with a thousand at hi back and then
what is in your mind ask oliv to fly from mur
how can we fly she answer when the pass is guard by joshua
men and the fung wait for us without the abati hate you my friend
and now that you have done your work i think that thei will kill you if
thei can whom thei bore with onli till it wa done ala ala that i
should have brought you to thi fals and ungrat countri and she
began to weep while we stare at each other helpless
then japhet who all thi while had been crouch on the floor rock
himself too and fro and mourn in hi eastern fashion for quick
whom he had love rose and come to the child of king prostrat
himself befor her
o walda nagasta he said hear the word of your servant onli three
mile awai near to the mouth of the pass ar encamp five hundr
men of my own peopl the mountain who hate princ joshua and hi
follow fly to them o walda nagasta for thei will cleav to you and
listen to me whom you have made a chief among them afterward you can
act as mai seem wisest
maqueda look at oliv questioningli
i think that is good advic he said at ani rate we cant be wors
off among the mountain than we ar in thi undefend place tell
your women to bring cloak that we can throw over our head and let us
go
five minut later a forlorn group fill with fear we had stolen
over the dead and dy in the passag and made our wai to the side
gate of the palac that we found open and over the bridg that span
the moat beyond which wa down doubtless joshua ruffian had us
it in their approach and retreat disguis in the long cloak with
monklik hood that the abati wore at night or when the weather wa
cold and wet we hurri across the great squar here sinc we could
not escap them we mingl with the crowd that wa gather at it
farther end all of themmen women and childrenchatt like
monkei in the treetop and point to the cliff at the back of the
palac beneath which it will be rememb lai the underground citi
a band of soldier rode by thrust their wai through the peopl and
in order to avoid them we thought it wise to take refug in the shadow
of a walk of greenleav tree which grew close at hand for we fear
lest thei might recogn oliv by hi height here we turn and
look up at the cliff to discov what it wa at which everi on wa
stare at that moment the full moon which had been obscur by a
cloud broke out and we saw a spectacl that under the circumst
wa noth less than terrifi
the cliff behind the palac rose to a height of about a hundr and
fifti feet and as it chanc just there a portion of it jut out
in an oblong shape which the abati call the lion rock although
person heretofor i had never been abl to see in it ani great
resembl to a lion now howev it wa differ for on the veri
extrem of thi rock stare down at mur sat the head and neck of
the huge lionfac idol of the fung inde in that light with the
promontori stretch awai behind it it look as though it were
the idol itself move from the vallei upon the farther side of the
precipic to the top of the cliff abov
oh oh oh groan japhet the propheci is fulfilledth head of
harmac ha come to sleep at mur
you mean that we have sent him there whisper higg dont be
frighten man cant you understand that the power of our medicin ha
blown the head off the sphinx high into the air and land it where it
sit now
ye i put in and what we felt in the cave wa the shock of it
fall
i dont care what brought him repli japhet who seem quit
unstrung by all that he had gone through all i know is that the
propheci is fulfil and harmac ha come to mur and where harmac goe
the fung follow
so much the better said the irrever higg i mai be abl to
sketch and measur him now
but i saw that maqueda wa trembl for she too thought thi
occurr a veri bad omen and even oliv remain silent perhap
becaus he fear it effect upon the abati
nor wa thi wonder sinc from the talk around us clearli that
effect wa great evid the peopl were terrifi like japhet we
could hear them forebod ill and curs us gentil as wizard
who had not destroi the idol of the fung as we promis but had onli
caus him to fly to mur
here i mai mention that as a matter of fact thei were right as we
discov afterward the whole forc of the explos instead of
shatter the vast bulk of the stone imag had rush up through the
hollow chamber in it interior until it struck against the solid head
lift thi as though it were a toi the expand ga had hurl that
mighti mass an unknown distanc into the air to light upon the crest of
the cliff of mur where probabl it will remain forev
well i said when we had stare a littl while at thi extraordinari
phenomenon thank god it did not travel farther and fall upon the
palac
oh had it done so whisper maqueda in a tear voic i think you
might have thank god inde for then at least i should be free
from all my troubl come friend let us be go befor we ar
discov
chapter xvii
i find my son
our road toward the pass ran through the camp ground of the newli
creat abati armi and what we saw on our journei thither told us
more vividli than ani word or report could do how utter wa the
demor of that peopl where should have been sentri were
no sentri where should have been soldier were group of offic
talk with women where should have been offic were camp follow
drink
through thi confus and excit we made our wai unobserv or
at ani rate unquest till at length we came to the regiment of the
mountain who for the most part were goatherd poor peopl who
live upon the slope of the precipic that enclos the land of mur
these folk have littl to do with their more prosper brethren of
the plain were hardi and primit of natur and therefor retain
some of the primev virtu of mankind such as courag and loyalti
it wa for the first of these reason and inde for the second also
that thei had been post by joshua at the mouth of the pass which he
knew well thei alon could be trust to defend in the event of seriou
attack moreov it wa desir from hi point of view to keep them
out of the wai while he develop hi plan against the person of the
child of king for whom these simplemind men had a hereditari and
almost a superstiti rever
as soon as we were within the line of these mountain we found the
differ between them and the rest of the abati the other regiment
we had pass unchalleng but here we were instantli stop by a
picket japhet whisper someth into the ear of it offic that
caus him to stare hard at us then thi offic salut the veil
figur of the child of king and led us to where the command of the
band and hi subordin were seat near a fire sit togeth at
some sign or word that did not reach us the command an old fellow
with a long grei beard rose and said
your pardon but be pleas to show your face
maqueda threw back her hood and turn so that the light of the moon
fell full upon her whereon the old man drop to hi knee sai
your command o walda nagasta
summon your regiment and i will give them she answer and seat
herself on a bench by the fire we three and japhet stand behind her
the command issu order to hi captain and present the
mountain form up on three side of a squar abov us to the
number of a littl over five hundr men when all were gather maqueda
mount the bench upon which she had been sit threw back her hood
so that everi on could see her face in the light of the fire and
address them
men of the mountainsid thi night just after the idol of the fung
had been destroi the princ joshua my uncl came to me demand
my surrend to him whether to kill me or to imprison me in hi castl
beyond the end of the lake for reason of state as he said or for
other vile purpos i do not know
at these word a murmur rose from the audienc
wait said maqueda hold up her hand there is wors to come
i told my uncl princ joshua that he wa a traitor and had best be
gone he went threaten me and when i do not know withdrew the
guard that should be station at my palac gate now some rumour of
my danger had reach the foreign in my servic and two of them
he who is call black window whom we rescu from the fung and the
soldier name quick came to watch over me while the lord orm and the
doctor adam stai in the cave to send out that spark of fire which
should destroi the idol nor did thei come back without need for
present arriv a band of princ joshua men to take me
then black window and the soldier hi companion fought a good fight
thei two hold the narrow passag against mani and slai a number
of them with their terribl weapon the end of it wa men of the
mountain that the warrior quick charg down the passag drove
awai those servant of joshua who remain aliv but in so do he wa
wound to the death ye that brave man li dead have given hi
life to save the child of king from the hand of her own peopl black
window also wa woundedse the bandag about hi head then came the
lord orm and the doctor adam and with them your brother japhet who
had bare escap with their live from the cave citi and know that
i wa no longer safe in the palac where even my sleepingroom ha been
drench with blood with them i have fled to you for succour will you
not protect me o men of the mountainsid
ye ye thei answer with a great shout command we obei what
shall we do o child of king
now maqueda call the offic of the regiment apart and consult with
them ask their opinion on by on some of them were in favour of
find out where joshua might be and attack him at onc crush the
snake head and it tail will soon ceas wriggl these said and i
confess thi wa a view that in mani wai commend itself to us
but maqueda would have none of it
what she exclaim shall i begin a civil war among my peopl when
for aught i know the enemi is at our gate ad asid to us also
how can these few hundr men brave though thei be hope to stand
against the thousand under the command of joshua
what then would you do ask orm

that garrison hold it against all enemi
veri well he repli to those who ar quit lost on road is as
good as anoth thei must trust to the star to guid them
quit so echo higg and the sooner we go the better for my leg
hurt and i want a sleep
so maqueda gave her command to the offic by whom thei were convei
to the regiment which receiv them with a shout and instantli began
to strike it camp
then it wa come hotfoot after so much sorrow loss and doubt that
there follow the happiest event of all my life utterli tire out and
veri despond i wa seat on an arrowchest await the order to
march idli watch oliv and maqueda talk with great earnest
at a littl distanc and in the interv try to prevent poor higg
at my side from fall asleep while i wa thu engag suddenli i
heard a disturb and by the bright moonlight caught sight of a man
be led into the camp in charg of a guard of abati soldier whom
from their dress i knew to belong to a compani that just then wa
emploi in watch the lower gate of the pass
i took no particular heed of the incid think onli that thei might
have captur some spy till a murmur of astonish and the gener
stir warn me that someth unusu had occur so i rose from my
box and stroll toward the man who now wa hidden from me by a group
of mountain as i advanc thi group open the men who compos

through great river into rise sun with fung
oliv instantli translat thi remark which made us all laugh
includ maqueda herself and veri grate we were to find the
opportun for a littl innoc merriment upon that tragic night
by thi time the regiment wa readi to start and had form up into
compani befor the march actual began howev the offic of the
abati patrol in whose charg roderick had been brought to us
demand hi surrend that he might deliv hi prison to the
commanderinchief princ joshua of cours thi wa refus whereon
the man ask roughli
by whose order
as it happen maqueda of whose presenc he wa not awar heard him
and act on some impuls came forward and unveil
by mine she said know that the child of king rule the abati not
the princ joshua and that prison taken by her soldier ar her
not hi be gone back to your post
the captain stare salut and went with hi companion not to the
pass inde as he had been order but to joshua to him he report
the arriv of the gentil son and the new he brought that the
nation of the fung dismai by the destruct of their god were in
full flight from the plain of harmac purpos to cross the great
river and to return no more
thi glad tide spread like wildfir so fast inde that almost
befor we had begun our march we heard the shout of exult with
which it wa receiv by the terrifi mob gather in the great squar
the cloud of terror wa suddenli lift from them thei went mad
in their delight thei lit bonfir thei drank thei feast thei
embrac each other and boast of their braveri that had caus the
mighti nation of the fung to flee awai for ever
meanwhil our advanc had begun nor in the midst of the gener
jubil wa ani particular notic taken of us till we were in the
middl of the squar of mur and within half a mile of the palac
when we saw by the moonlight that a larg bodi of troop two or three
thousand of them were drawn up in front of us appar to bar our
wai still we went on till a number of offic rode up and address
the command of the regiment of mountain demand to know why he
had left hi post and whither he went
i go whither i am order he answer for there is on here greater
than i
if you mean the gentil orm and hi fellow the command of the princ
joshua is that you hand them over to us that thei mai make report to him
of their do thi night
and the command of the child of king is repli the captain of the
mountain that i take them with her back to the palac
it ha no weight said the spokesman insol not be endors
by the council surrend the gentil hand over to us the person of
the child of king of whom you have taken possess and return to your
post till the pleasur of the princ joshua be known
then the wrath of maqueda blaze up
seiz those men she said and it wa done instantli now cut the
head from him who dare to demand the surrend of my person and of
my offic and give it to hi companion to take back to the princ
joshua as my answer to hi messag
the man heard and be a coward like all the abati flung himself upon
hi face befor maqueda try to kiss her robe and plead for merci
dog she answer you were on of those who thi veri night dare
to attack my chamber oh lie not i knew your voic and heard your
fellowtraitor call you by your name awai with him
we tri to interfer but she would not listen even to orm
would you plead for your brother murder she ask allud to
quick i have spoken
so thei drag him off behind us and present we saw a melancholi
process return whenc thei came carri someth on a shield
it reach the oppos rank whenc there aros a murmur of wrath and
fear
march on said maqueda and gain the palac
so the regiment form into a squar and set maqueda and ourselv
in the centr of it advanc again
then the fight began great number of the abati surround us and as
thei did not dare to make a direct attack commenc shoot arrow
which kill and wound a number of men but the highland also were
archer and carri stronger bow the squar wa halt the first
rank kneel and the second stand behind them then at a given
word the stiff bow which these hardi peopl us against the lion and
the buffalo upon their hill were drawn to the ear and loos again and
again with terribl effect
on that open place it wa almost imposs to miss the mob of the
abati who have no experi of war were fight without order nor
could the light mail thei wore withstand the rush of the heavi barb
arrow which pierc them through and through in two minut thei began
to give in three thei were fly back to their main bodi those who
were left of them a huddl rout of men and hors so the french
must have fled befor the terribl longbow of the english at crcy
and poitier for in fact we were take part in just such a mediv
battl
oliv who wa watch intent went to japhet and whisper
someth in hi ear he nod and ran to seek the command of the
regiment present the result of that whisper becam appar for
the side of the hollow squar wheel outward and the rear move up to
strengthen the centr
now the mountain were rang in a doubl or tripl line behind
which were onli about a dozen soldier who march round maqueda
hold their shield aloft in order to protect her from strai arrow
with these too came our four selv a number of campfollow and
other carri on their shield those of the regiment who were too
badli wound to walk
leav the dead where thei lai we began to advanc pour in vollei
of arrow as we went twice the abati tri to charg us and twice
those dread arrow drove them back then at the word of command the
highland slung their bow upon their back drew their short sword
and in their turn charg
five minut afterward everyth wa over joshua soldier threw
down their arm and ran or gallop to right and left save a number
of them who fled through the gate of the palac which thei had open
and across the drawbridg into the courtyard within after them or
rather mix up with them follow the mountain kill all whom
thei could find for thei were out of hand and would not listen to the
command of maqueda and their offic that thei should show merci
so just as the dawn broke thi strang moonlit battl end a small
affair it is true for there were onli five hundr men engag upon
our side and three or four thousand on the other yet on that cost
a great number of live and wa the begin of all the ruin that
follow
well we were safe for a while sinc it wa certain after the lesson
which he had just learn that joshua would not attempt to storm the
doubl wall and foss of the palac without long prepar yet even
now a new troubl await us for by some mean we never discov
how that wing of the palac in which maqueda privat room were
situat suddenli burst into flame
person i believ that the fire aros through the fact that a lamp
had been left burn near the bed of the child of king upon which
wa laid the bodi of sergeant quick perhap a wound man hidden there
overturn the lamp perhap the draught blow through the open door
brought the goldspangl curtain into contact with the wick
at ani rate the woodpanel chamber took fire and had it not
happen that the set of the wind wa favour the whole palac
might have been consum as it wa we succeed in confin the
conflagr to thi particular part of it which within two hour had
burnt out leav noth stand but the stark stone wall
such wa the funer pyre of sergeant quick a nobl on i thought to
myself as i watch it burn
when the fire wa so well under control for we had pull down the
connect passag where higg and quick fought their great fight that
there wa no longer ani danger of it spread and the watch had
been set at length we got some rest
maqueda and two or three of her ladi on of them i rememb her
old nurs who had brought her up for her mother di at her birth took
possess of some empti room of which there were mani in the palac
while we lai or rather fell down in the guestchamb where we had
alwai slept and never open our ey again until the even
i rememb that i woke think that i wa the victim of some wonder
dream of mingl joi and tragedi oliv and higg were sleep like
log but my son roderick still dress in hi bridal robe had risen
and sat by my bed stare at me a puzzl look upon hi handsom face
so you ar here i said take hi hand i thought i dream
no father he answer in hi odd english no dream all true
thi is a strang world father look at me for how mani

of fung idol alwai near death but never die then sultan barung
take fanci to me sai i come of white blood and must be hi daughter
husband then your brother higg made prison with me and tell me that

chapter xviii
the burn of the palac
orm wa right maqueda defianc did mean war an unequ war thi
wa our posit we were shut up in a long rang of build of which
on end had been burn that on account of their moat and doubl wall
if defend with ani vigour could onli be storm by an enemi of great
courag and determin prepar to face a heavi sacrific of
life thi wa a circumst in our favour sinc the abati were not
courag and veri much dislik the idea of be kill or even
injur
but here our advantag end deduct those whom we had lost on
the previou night the garrison onli amount to someth over four
hundr men of whom about fifti were wound some of them danger
moreov ammunit wa short for thei had shot awai most of their
arrow in the battl of the squar and we had no mean of obtain
more but worst of all the palac wa not provis for a sieg
and the mountain had with them onli three dai ration of sundri
beef or goat flesh and a hard kind of biscuit made of indian corn
mix with barlei meal thu as we saw from the begin unless we
could manag to secur more food our case must soon grow hopeless
there remain yet anoth danger although the palac itself wa
stonebuilt it gild dome and ornament turret were of timber and
therefor liabl to be fire as inde had alreadi happen the roof
also wa of ancient cedar beam thinli cover with concret while the
interior contain an enorm quantiti of panel or rather board
cut from some resin wood
the abati on the other hand were ampli suppli with everi kind of
store and weapon and could bring a great forc to blockad us though
that forc wa compos of a timid and undisciplin rabbl
well we made the best prepar that we could although of these i
did not see much sinc all that dai my time wa occupi in attend
to the wound with the help of my son and a few rough orderli whose
experi in doctor had for the most part been confin to cattl
a piti busi it prove without the aid of ansthet or a proper
suppli of bandag and other applianc although my medicin chest had
been furnish upon a liber scale it prove total inadequ to the
casualti of battl still i did my best and save some live though
mani case develop gangren and slip through my finger
meanwhil higg who work nobli notwithstand hi flesh wound
which pain him consider and orm were also do their best
with the assist of japhet and the other offic of the highland
regiment the palac wa thoroughli examin and all weak place in it
defenc were made good the avail forc wa divid into watch
and station to the best advantag a number of men were set to work to
manufactur arrow shaft from cedar beam of which there were plenti
in the wooden stabl and outhous that lai at the back of the main
build and to point and wing the same from a suppli of iron barb and
feather which fortun wa discov in on of the guardhous a
few hors that remain in a shed were kill and salt down for food
and so forth
also everi possibl prepar wa made to repel attempt to storm
pave stone be pile up to throw upon the head of assail and
fire light on the wall to heat pitch and oil and water for the same
purpos
but to our disappoint no direct assault wa deliv such
desper method not commend themselv to the abati their plan of
attack wa to take cover wherev thei could especi among the tree
of the garden beyond the gate and thenc shoot arrow at ani on who
appear upon the wall or even fire them in vollei at the cloud as
the norman did at hast so that thei might fall upon the head
of person in the courtyard although these cautiou tactic cost us
sever men thei had the advantag of furnish us with a suppli of
ammunit which we sore need all the spent arrow were carefulli
collect and made us of against the enemi at whom we shot whenev
opportun offer we did them but littl damag howev sinc thei
were extrem care not to expos themselv
in thi fashion three dreari dai went past unreliev by ani incid
except a feint for it wa scarc more which the abati made upon
the second night appar with the object of forc the great gate
under cover of a rainstorm the advanc wa discov at onc and
repel by two or three vollei of arrow and some rifl shot of
these rifl inde whereof we possess about a score the abati were
terribl afraid pick out some of the most intellig soldier we
taught them how to handl our spare gun and though of cours their
shoot wa extrem errat the result of it back up by our
own more accur marksmanship wa to forc the enemi to take cover
inde after on or two experi of the effect of bullet not a man
would show himself in the open within five hundr yard until night had
fallen
on the third afternoon we held a council to determin what must be done
sinc for the last twentyfour hour it had been obviou that thing
could not continu as thei were to begin with we had onli suffici
food left to keep our forc from starvat for two more dai also
the spirit of our soldier brave men enough when actual fight
wa concern were begin to flag in thi atmospher of inact
gather into group thei talk of their wive and children and of
what would happen to them at the hand of joshua also of their cattl
and crop sai that doubtless these were be ravag and their
hous burn in vain did maqueda promis them fivefold their loss
when the war wa end for evid in their heart thei thought it
could onli end on wai moreov as thei point out she could not
give them back their children if these were kill
at thi melancholi council everi possibl plan wa discuss to find
that these resolv themselv into two alternativesto surrend
or to take the bull by the horn salli out of the palac at night and
attack joshua on the face of it thi latter scheme had the appear
of suicid but in fact it wa not so desper as it seem the
abati be such coward it wa quit probabl that thei would run in
their thousand befor the onset of a few hundr determin men and
that if onc victori declar itself for the child of king the bulk
of her subject would return to their allegi so we settl on it in
prefer to surrend which we knew meant death to ourselv and for
maqueda a choic between that last grim solut of her troubl and a
forc marriag
but there were other to be convinc name the mountain japhet
who had been present at the council wa sent to summon all of them
except those actual on guard and when thei were assembl in the
larg inner court maqueda went out and address them
i do not rememb the exact word of her speech and i made no note of
them but it wa extrem beauti and touch she point out her
plight and that we could halt no longer between two opinion who must
either fight or yield for herself she said she did not care sinc
although she wa young and their ruler she set no store upon her life
and would give it up gladli rather than be driven into a marriag
which she consid shame and forc to pass beneath the yoke of
traitor
but for us foreign she did care we had come to her countri at her
invit we had serv her nobli on of us had given hi life to
protect her person and now in violat of her safeguard and that of
the council we were threaten with a dread death were thei her
subject so lack in honour and hospit that thei would suffer
such a thing with no blow struck to save us
now the major of them shout no but some were silent and on old
captain advanc salut and spoke
child of king he said let us search out the truth of thi matter
is it not becaus of your love of the foreign soldier orm that all
thi troubl ha arisen is not that love unlaw accord to our law
and ar you not solemnli affianc to the princ joshua
maqueda consid awhil befor she repli and said slowli
friend my heart is my own therefor upon thi point answer your
question for yourself as regard my uncl joshua if there exist ani
abid contract between us it wa broken when a few night ago he sent
hi servant arm to attack and drag me off i know not whither would
you have me marri a traitor and a coward i have spoken
no again shout the major of the soldier
then in the silenc that follow the old captain repli with a
canni that wa almost scotch
on the point rais by you o child of king i give no opinion sinc
you be but a woman if a highborn on would not listen to me if i
did but will doubtless follow that heart of your of which you speak to
whatev end is appoint settl the matter with your betroth joshua
as you will but we also have a matter to settl with joshua who is a
toad with a long tongu that if he seem slow yet never miss hi fly
we took up your caus and have kill a great number of hi peopl as
he ha kill some of our thi he will not forget therefor it seem
to me that it will be wise that we should make what we can of the nest
that we have built sinc it is better to die in battl than on the
gallow for thi reason then sinc we can stai here no longer for
my part i am will to go out and fight for you thi night although
joshua peopl be so mani and our so few i shall think myself
fortun if i live to see anoth sun
thi hard and reason speech seem to appeal to the dissenti with
the result that thei withdrew their opposit and it wa agre that
we should attempt to break our wai through the besieg armi about on
hour befor the dawn when thei would be heavili asleep and most liabl
to panic
yet as it chanc that sorti wa destin never to take place which
perhap wa fortun for us sinc i am convinc that it would have
end in failur it is true that we might have forc our wai through
joshua armi but afterward those of us who remain aliv would have
been surround starv out and when our strength and ammunit were
exhaust taken prison or cut down
howev that mai be event shape a differ cours for us perhap
becaus the abati got wind of our intent and had no stomach for
a pitch battl with desper men as it happen thi night from
sunset on to moonris wa on of a dark so remark that it wa
imposs to see anyth even a foot awai also a wind blow from
the east made sound veri inaud onli a few of our men were on
guard sinc it wa necessari that thei should be rest till it wa
time for them to prepar for their great effort also we had littl
fear of ani direct attack
about eight oclock howev my son roderick on of the watch
station in the gatewai tower who wa gift with veri quick ear
report that he thought he heard peopl move on the farther side of
the massiv wooden door beyond the moat accordingli some of us went to
listen but could distinguish noth and conclud therefor that he
wa mistaken so we retir to our post and wait patient for the
moon to rise but as it chanc no moon rose or rather we could not
see her becaus the sky wa complet cover by thick bank of
thundercloud presag the breakup of a period of great heat these
as the wind had now di down remain quit stationari upon the face
of the sky blot out all light
perhap anoth hour had pass when chanc to look behind me i saw
what i thought wa a meteor fall from the crest of the cliff against
which the palac wa built that cliff whither the head of the idol
harmac had been carri by the forc of the explos
look at that shoot star i said to oliv who wa at my side
it is not a shoot star it is fire he repli in a startl voic
and as he spoke other streak of light score of them began to rain
down from the brow of the cliff and land upon the wooden build to
the rear of the palac that were dry as tinder with the drought and
what wa wors upon the gild timber dome of the roof
dont you understand the game he went on thei have ti firebrand
to arrow and spear to burn us out sound the alarm sound the alarm
it wa done and present the great rang of build began to hum
like a hive of bee the soldier still half asleep rush hither
and thither shout the offic also develop the characterist
excit of the abati race in thi hour of panic yell and scream
at them beat them with their fist and sword till some kind of
control wa establish
then attempt were made to extinguish the flame which by thi time
had got hold in halfadozen place from the begin the effort wa
absolut hopeless it is true that there wa plenti of water in the
moat which wa fed by a perenni stream that flow down the face of
the precipic behind but pump engin of ani sort were quit unknown
to the abati who if a build took fire just let it burn content
themselv with safeguard those in it neighbourhood moreov
even in the palac such articl as pail jug or other vessel were
compar few and far between
those that we could find howev were fill with water and pass
by line of men to the place in most dangerthat is practic
everywherewhil other men tri to cut off the advanc of the flame
by pull down portion of the build
but as fast as on fire wa extinguish other broke out for the rain
of burn dart and of light pot or lamp fill with oil descend
continu from the cliff abov a strang and terribl sight it wa
to see them flash down through the dark like the fieri dart
that shall destroi the wick in the dai of armageddon
still we toil on despairingli on the roof we four white men and
some soldier under the command of japhet were pour water on to
sever of the gild dome which now were well alight close by
wrap in a dark cloak and attend by some of her ladi stood
maqueda she wa quit calm although sundri burn arrow and spear
fall with great forc from the cliff abov struck the flat roof
close to where she stood
her ladi howev were not calm thei wept and wrung their hand
while on of them went into violent hyster in her veri natur
terror maqueda turn and bade them descend to the courtyard of the
gatewai where she said she would join them present thei rush off
rejoic to escap the sight of those burn arrow on of which had
just pierc a man and set hi cloth and hair on fire caus him to
leap from the roof in hi mad
at oliv request i ran to the child of king to lead her to some
safer place if it could be found but she would not stir
let me be o adam she said if i am to die i will die here but
i do not think that is fate and with her foot she kick asid a
burn spear that had struck the cement roof and rebound fallen
quit close to her if my peopl will not fight she went on with
bitter sarcasm at least thei understand the other art of war for
thi trick of their is clever thei ar cruel also listen to them
mock us in the squar thei ask whether we will roast aliv or come
out and have our throat cut oh she went on clench her hand
oh that i should have been born the head of such an accurs race let
sheol take them all for in the dai of their tribul no finger will
i lift to save them
she wa silent for a moment and down below near the gatewai i heard
some brute scream pretti pigeon pretti pigeon ar your feather
sing come then into our pie pretti pigeon pretti pigeon
follow by shout of ribald laughter
but it chanc it wa thi hound himself who went into the pie
present when the flame were brighter i saw him in the midst of a
crowd of hi admir sing hi foul song anoth vers of it about
maqueda which i will not repeat and by good fortun manag to put a
bullet through hi head it wa not a bad shot consid the light and
circumst and the onli on i fire that night i trust also that it
will be the last i shall ever fire at ani human be
just as i wa about to leav maqueda and return with her messag to
orm to the effect that she would not move the final catastroph
occur amongst the stabl wa a larg shed fill with dry fodder
for the palac hors and camel suddenli thi burst into a mass of
flame that spread in all direct then came the last hideou panic
from everi part of the palac the mountain men and offic
togeth rush down to the gatewai in a minut with the singl
except of japhet we four and maqueda were left alon upon the
roof where we stood overwhelm not know what to do we heard
the drawbridg fall we heard the great door burst upon beneath the
pressur of a mob of men we heard a coars voicei thought it wa that
of joshuayel
kill whom you will my children but death to him who harm the child
of king she is my spoil
then follow terribl sight and sound the cun abati had
stretch rope outsid the door it wa the nois thei made at thi
work which had reach roderick ear earlier dure the dark the
terrifi soldier fly from the fire stumbl and fell over these
rope nor could thei rise again becaus of those who press behind
what happen to them all i am sure i do not know but doubtless mani
were crush to death and mani more kill by joshua men i trust
howev that some of them escap sinc compar to the rest of the
abati thei were as lion ar to cat although like all their race
thei lack the stamina to fight an uphil game
it wa at the commenc of thi terrif scene that i shot the
foulmouth singer
you shouldnt have done that old fellow scream higg in hi high
voic strive to make himself heard abov the tumult as it will show
those swine where we ar
i dont think thei will look for us here anywai i answer
then we watch awhil in silenc
come said orm at length take maqueda by the hand
where ar you go o oliv she ask hang back sooner will i
burn than yield to joshua
i am go to the cave citi he answer we have nowher els to
go and littl time to lose four men with rifl can hold that place
against a thousand come
i obei she answer bow her head
we went down the stairwai that led from the roof on which the
inhabit of the palac were accustom to spend much of their dai
and even to sleep in hot weather as is common in the east anoth
minut and we should have been too late the fire from on of the dome
had spread to the upper stori and wa alreadi appear in littl
tongu of flame mingl with jet of black smoke through crack in the
crumbl partit wall
as a matter of fact thi wall fell in just as my son roderick the last
of us wa pass down the stair with the curios of youth he had
linger for a few moment to watch the sad scene below a delai which
nearli cost him hi life
on the ground floor we found ourselv out of immedi danger sinc
the fire wa attack thi part of the palac from abov and burn
downward we had even time to go to our respect sleepingplac and
collect such of our possess and valuabl as we were abl to carri
fortun among other thing these includ all our notebook
which todai ar of priceless valu laden with these articl we met
again in the audienc hall which although it wa veri hot seem as
it had alwai been a huge empti place whereof the roof paint with
star wa support upon thick cedar column each of them hewn from a
singl tree
pass down that splendid apart which an hour later had ceas to
exist lamp in hand for these we had found time to fetch and light
we reach the mouth of the passag that led to the underground citi
without meet a singl human be
had the abati been a differ race thei could perfectli well have
dash in and made us prison for the drawbridg wa still intact
but their cowardic wa our salvat for thei fear lest thei should
be trap by the fire so i think at least but justic compel me to
add that on the spur of the moment thei mai have found it imposs
to clear the gatewai of the mass of fallen or dead soldier over which
it would have been difficult to climb
such at ani rate wa the explan that we heard afterward
we reach the mouth of the vast cave in perfect safeti and clamber
through the littl orific which wa left between the rock roll
thither by the forc of the explos or shaken down from the roof
thi hole for it wa noth more we proceed to stop with a few
stone in such a fashion that it could not be forc without much toil
and consider nois onli leav on littl tortuou channel through
which if necessari a man could creep
the labour of rockcarri in which even maqueda share occupi our
mind for awhil and induc a kind of fictiti cheer but
when it wa done and the chilli silenc of that enorm cave so
strike in comparison with the roar of the flame and the hideou human
tumult which we had left without fell upon us like sudden cold and
blind night upon a wander in windi sunlit mountain all our
excit perish in a flash we understood our terribl posit
we who had but escap from the red fire to perish slowli in the black
dark
still we strove to keep our spirit as best we could leav higg to
watch the block passag a somewhat superflu task sinc the fire
without wa our best watchman the rest of us thread our wai up the
cave follow the telephon wire which poor quick had laid on the
night of the blowingup of the god harmac till we came to what had been
our headquart dure the dig of the mine into the room which
wa oliv whenc we had escap with so much difficulti after
that event we could not enter becaus of the transom that block the
doorwai still there were plenti of other at hand in the old templ
although thei were foul with the refus of the bat that wheel about
us in thousand for these creatur evid had some unknown access
to the open air on of these room had serv as our storechamb and
after a few rough prepar we assign it to maqueda
friend she said as she survei it darksom entranc it look
like the door of a tomb well in the tomb there is rest and rest i
must have leav me to sleep who were it not for you o oliv would
prai that i might never wake again
man she ad passion befor us all for now in face of the
last peril everi fals shame and wish to conceal the truth had left her
man why were you born to bring woe upon my head and joi to my heart
well well the joi outweigh the woe and even if the angel who led you
hither is name azrael still i shall bless him who ha reveal to me
my soul yet for you i weep and if onli your life could be spare to
fulfil itself in happi in the land that bore you oh for you i
would gladli die
now oliv who seem deepli move step to her and began to whisper
into her ear evid make some propos of which i think i can
guess the natur she listen to him smile sadli and made a motion
with her hand as though to thrust him awai
not so she said it is nobli offer but did i accept through
whatev univers i mai wander those who came after me would know me
by my trail of blood the blood of him who love me perhap too by
that crime i should be separ from you for ever moreov i tell
you that though all seem black as thi thick dark i believ that
thing will yet end well for you and mein thi world or anoth
then she wa gone leav orm stare after her like a man in a
tranc
i daresai thei will remark higg sotto voce to me and that
firstrat so far as thei ar concern but what i should jolli well
like to know is how thei ar go to end for us who havent got a
charm ladi to see us across the styx
you neednt puzzl your brain over that i answer gloomili for
i think there will soon be a few more skeleton in thi beastli cave
that all dont you see that those abati will believ we ar burn in
the palac
chapter xix
starvat
i wa right the abati did think that we had been burn it never
occur to them that we might have escap to the underground citi
so at least i judg from the fact that thei made no attempt to seek
us there until thei learn the truth in the fashion that i am about to
describ if anyth thi safeti from our enemi ad to the trial
of those hideou dai and night had there been assault to repel and
the excit of strive against overwhelm odd at ani rate we
should have found occup for our mind and remain energi
but there were none by turn we listen at the mouth of the passag
for the echo of footstep that never came noth came to break a
silenc so intens that at last our ear crave for sound magnifi
the soft flitter of the bat into a nois as of eagl wing till
at last we spoke in whisper becaus the full voic of man seem to
affront the solemn quietud seem intoler to our nerv
yet for the first dai or two we found occup of a sort of cours
our first need wa to secur a suppli of food of which we had onli a
littl origin laid up for our us in the chamber of the old templ
tin meat that we had brought from london and so forth now nearli
all consum we rememb that maqueda had told us of corn from
her estat which wa store annual in pit to provid against the
possibl of a sieg of mur and ask her where it wa
she led us to a place where round stone cover with ring attach to
them were let into the floor of the cave not unlik those which stop
the coalshoot in a town pavement onli larger with great difficulti
we prise on of these up to me it did not seem to have been move
sinc the ancient king rule in mur and after leav it open for a
long while for the air within to purifi lower roderick by a rope we
had to report it content next moment we heard him sai want to
come up pleas thi place is not pleasant
we pull him out and ask what he had found
noth good to eat he answer onli plenti of dead bone and on
rat that ran up my leg
we tri the next two pit with the same resultthei were full of human
bone then we crossexamin maqueda who after reflect inform
us that she now rememb that about five gener befor a great
plagu had fallen on mur which reduc it popul by onehalf she
had heard also that those stricken with the plagu were driven into
the underground citi in order that thei might not infect the other
and suppos that the bone we saw were their remain thi inform
caus us to close up those pit again in a great hurri though realli
it did not matter whether we caught the plagu or no
still as she wa sure that corn wa buri somewher we went to
anoth group of pit in a distant chamber and open the first on
thi time our search wa reward to the extent that we found at the
bottom of it some moulder dust that year ago had been grain the
other pit two of which had been seal up within three year as the
date upon the wax show were quit empti
then maqueda understood what had happen

when we reach the passag that led from the citi to the tomb of king

by thi time we had reach that end of the vast tomb where the
hunchback king us to sit and saw at onc that our quest wa vain
the tunnel which we had dug beyond wa utterli choke with mass of
fallen rock that we could never hope to move even with the aid of
explos of which we had none left

he smack hi poor hungri lip ye ye he went on to take them
out on by on and show them to and and he mention by name
offici of sundri great museum with whom he wa at war and see them
tear their hair with rage and jealousi while thei wonder in their
heart if thei could not manag to seiz the lot for the crown as

in hi old pleasant fashion

i must get that great gold head into on of them though it is an aw
job to carri it far at a time doctor what diseas is it that make
your leg suddenli give wai beneath you so that you find yourself
sit in a heap on the floor without know how you came there you
dont know well no more do i but iv got it bad i tell you im
downright sore behind from continu and unexpect contact with the
rock
poor old higg i did not like to tell him that hi diseas wa
starvat
well he went on with hi fetch and carri and catalogu and
pack i rememb that the last load he brought in wa the golden head
he had spoken of the wonder like of some prehistor king which
ha sinc excit so much interest throughout the world the thing be
too heavi for him to carri in hi weaken state for it is much over
lifes he wa oblig to roll it befor him which account for the
present somewhat damag condit of the nose and semiegyptian diadem
never shall i forget the sight of the professor as he appear out of
the dark shuffl along upon hi knee where hi garment were
worn into hole and by the feebl light of the lamp that he move from
time to time painfulli push the great yellow object forward onli a
foot or two at each push
here it is at last he gasp triumphantli whilst we watch him with
indiffer ey japhet help me to wrap it up in the mat and lift
it into the box no no you donkeyfac upwardso never mind the
corner ill fill them with ringmonei and other trifl and out of
hi wide pocket he empti a golden shower amongst which he sift
hand of dust from the floor and anyth els he could find to serv
as pack final cover all with a goatshair blanket which he
took from hi bed
then veri slowli he found the lid of the box and nail it down rest
between everi few stroke of the hammer whilst we watch him in our
intent but idl fashion wonder at the strang form of hi mad
at length the last nail wa driven and seat on the box he put hi
hand into an inner pocket to find hi notebook then incontin
faint i struggl to my feet and sprinkl water over hi face till
he reviv and roll on to the floor where present he sank into
sleep or torpor as he did so the first lamp gave out
light it japhet said maqueda it is dark in thi place
o child of king answer the man i would obei if i could but
there is no more oil
halfanhour later the second lamp went out by the light that remain
we made such arrang as we could know that soon dark would
be on us thei were few and simpl the fetch of a jar or two
of water the place of arm and ammunit to our hand and the
spread out of some blanket on which to lie down side by side upon
what i for on believ would be our bed of death
while we were thu engag japhet crawl into our circl from the
outer gloom suddenli i saw hi haggard face appear look like that
of a spirit rise from the grave
my lamp is burn out he moan it began to fail whilst i wa
on watch at the tunnel mouth and befor i wa halfwai here it di
altogeth had it not been for the wire of the thingthatspeak
which guid me i could never have reach you i should have been lost
in the dark of the citi and perish alon among the ghost
well you ar here now said oliv have you anyth to report
noth lord or at least veri littl i move some of the small rock
that we pile up and crept down the hole till i came to a place where
the bless light of dai fell upon me onli on littl rai of it but
still the light of dai i think that someth ha fallen upon the
tunnel and broken it perhap on of the outer wall of the palac
at least i look through a crack and saw everywher ruinsruin that
still smoke from among them i heard the voic of men shout to each
other
on of them call to hi companion that it wa strang if the
gentil and the child of king had perish in the fire that thei had
not found their bone which would be known by the gun thei carri hi
friend answer that it wa strang inde but be magician perhap
thei had hidden awai somewher for hi part he hope so as then sooner
or later thei would be found and put to death slowli as thei deserv
who had led astrai the child of king and brought so mani of the
heavendescend abati to their death then fear lest thei should
find and kill me for thei drew near as i could tell by their voic i
crept back again and that is all my stori
we said noth there seem to be noth to sai but sat in our sad
circl and watch the dy lamp when it began to flicker leap up
and down like a thing aliv a sudden panic seiz poor japhet
o walda nagasta he cri throw himself at her feet you have
call me a brave man but i am onli brave where the sun and the star
shine here in the dark amongst so mani angri spirit and with hunger
gnaw at my bowel i am a great coward joshua himself is not such a
coward as i let us go out into the light while there is yet time let
us give ourselv up to the princ perhap he will be merci and
spare our live or at least he will spare your and if we die it will
be with the sun shine on us
but maqueda onli shook her head whereon he turn to orm and went on
lord would you have the blood of the child of king upon your hand
is it thu that you repai her for her love lead her forth no harm will
come to her who otherwis must perish here in miseri
you hear what the man sai maqueda said orm heavili there is some
truth in it it realli doe not matter to us whether we die in the power
of the abati or here of starvat in fact i think that we should
prefer the former end and doubtless no hand will be laid on you will
you go
nai she answer passion a hand would be laid on me the hand
of joshua and rather than that he should touch me i will die a hundr
death let fate take it cours for as i have told you i believ that
then it will open to us some gate we cannot see and if i believ in
vain why there is anoth gate which we can pass togeth o oliv
and beyond that gate li peac bid the man be silent or drive him
awai let him troubl me no more
the lamp flame sank low it flicker onc twice thrice each time
show the pale drawn face of us six seat about it like wizard
make an incant like corps in a tomb
then it went out
how long were we in that place after thi at least three whole dai and
night i believ if not more but of cours we soon lost all count of
time at first we suffer agoni from famin which we strove in vain
to assuag with great draught of water no doubt these kept us aliv
but even higg who it mai be rememb wa a teetotal afterward
confess to me that he ha loath the sight and tast of water ever
sinc inde he now drink beer and wine like other peopl it wa
tortur we could have eaten anyth in fact the professor did manag
to catch and eat a bat that got entangl in hi red hair he offer me
a bite of it i rememb and wa most grate when i declin
the worst of it wa also that we had a littl food a few hard ship
biscuit which we had save up for a purpos name to feed maqueda
thi wa how we manag it at certain interv i would announc that
it wa time to eat and hand maqueda her biscuit then we would all
pretend to eat also sai how much we felt refresh by the food and
how we long for more smack our lip and bite on a piec of wood
so that she could not help hear us
thi piteou farc went on for fortyeight hour or more until at
last the wretch japhet who wa quit demor and in no mood for
act betrai us exactli how i cannot rememb after thi maqueda
would touch noth more which did not greatli matter as there wa onli
on biscuit left i offer it to her whereon she thank me and all
of us for our courtesi toward a woman took the biscuit and gave it to
japhet who at it like a wolf
it wa some time after thi incid that we discov japhet to be
miss at least we could no longer touch him nor did he answer when
we call therefor we conclud that he had crept awai to die and
i am sorri to sai thought littl more about it for after all what he
suffer or had suffer we suffer also
i recal that befor we were overtaken by the last sleep a strang
fit came upon us our pang pass awai much as the pain doe when
mortif follow a wound and with them that horribl crave for
nutriment we grew cheer and talk a great deal thu roderick gave
me the entir histori of the fung peopl and of hi life among them and
other savag tribe further he explain everi secret detail of their
idol worship to higg who wa enorm interest and tri to
make some note by the aid of our few remain match when even that
subject wa exhaust he sang to us in hi beauti voiceenglish
hymn and arab song oliv and maqueda also chat togeth quit
gaili for i heard them laugh and gather that he wa engag in
try to teach her english
the last thing that i recollect is the scene as it wa reveal by the
momentari light of on of the last match maqueda sat by oliv hi
arm wa about her waist her head rest upon hi shoulder her long
hair flow loos her larg and tender ey stare from her white wan
face up toward hi face which wa almost that of a mummi
then on the other side stood my son support himself against the wall
of the room and beyond him higg a shadow of hi former self feebli
wave a pencil in the air and try appar to write a note upon
hi panama straw hat which he held in hi left hand as i suppos
imagin it to be hi pocketbook the incongru of that sunhat in
a place where no sun had ever come made me laugh and as the match went
out i regret that i had forgotten to look at hi face to ascertain
whether he wa still wear hi smoke spectacl
what is the us of a straw hat and smoke spectacl in kingdomcom
i kept repeat to myself while roderick whose arm i knew wa about
me seem to answer
the fung wizard sai that the sphinx harmac onc wore a hat but my
father i do not know if he had spectacl
then a sensat as of be whirl round and round in some vast
machin down the slope side of which i sank at last into a vortex of
utter black whereof i knew the name wa death
dimli veri dimli i becam awar that i wa be carri i heard
voic in my ear but what thei said i could not understand then a
feel of light struck upon my eyebal which gave me great pain agoni
ran all through me as it doe through the limb of on who is be
brought back from death by drown after thi someth warm wa
pour down my throat and i went to sleep
when i awok again it wa to find myself in a larg room that i did not
know i wa ly on a bed and by the light of sunris which stream
through the windowplac i saw the three other my son roderick orm
and higg ly on the other bed but thei were still asleep
abati servant enter the room bring food a kind of rough soup with
piec of meat in it of which thei gave me a portion in a wooden bowl
that i devour greedili also thei shook my companion until thei awok
and almost automat at up the content of similar bowl after
which thei went to sleep again as i did thank heaven that we were
all still aliv
everi few hour i had a vision of these men enter with the bowl
of soup or porridg until at last life and reason came back to me in
earnest and i saw higg sit up on the bed opposit and stare at
me
i sai old fellow he said ar we aliv or is thi hade
cant be hade i answer becaus there ar abati here
quit right he repli if the abati go anywher it to hell
where thei havent whitewash wall and fourpost bed oliv wake
up we ar out of that cave anywai
orm rais himself on hi hand and stare at us
where maqueda he ask a question to which of cours we could
give no answer till present roderick woke also and said
i rememb someth thei carri us all out of the cave japhet wa
with them thei took the child of king on wai and us anoth that is
all i know
shortli afterward the abati servant arriv bear food more solid
than the soup and with them came on of their doctor not that old
idiot of a court physician who examin us and announc that
we should all recov a fact which we knew alreadi we ask mani
question of him and the servant but could get no answer for
evid thei were sworn to silenc howev we persuad them to
bring us water to wash in it came and with it a polish piec of
metal such as the abati us for a lookingglass in which we saw our
face the terribl wast face of those who have gone within a hair
breadth of death by starvat in the dark
yet although our gaoler would sai noth someth in their aspect
told us that we were in sore peril of our live thei look at us
hungrili as a terrier look at rat in a wire cage of which the door
will present be open moreov roderick who as i think i have
said ha veri quick ear overheard on of the attend whisper to
anoth
when doe our servic on these hound of gentil come to an end to
which hi fellow answer the council ha not yet decid but i think
tomorrow or the next dai if thei ar strong enough it will be a great
show
also that even about sunset we heard a mob shout outsid the
barrack in which we were imprison for that wa it real us give us
the gentil give us the gentil we ar tire of wait until at
length some soldier drove them awai
well we talk the thing over onli to conclud that there wa noth
to be done we had no friend in the place except maqueda and she
it appear wa a prison like ourselv and therefor could not
commun with us nor could we see the slightest possibl of
escap
out of the fryingpan into the fire remark higg gloomili i wish
now that thei had let us die in the cave it would have been better than
be bait to death by a mob of abati
ye answer oliv with a sigh for he wa think of maqueda but
that why thei save us the vindict beast to kill us for what
thei ar pleas to call high treason
high treason exclaim higg i hope to good their punish
for the offenc is not that of mediv england hang is bad
enoughbut the rest
i dont think the abati studi european histori i broke in but it
is no us disguis from you that thei have method of their own look
here friend i ad i have kept someth about me in case
the worst should come to the worst and i produc a littl bottl
contain a particularli swift and deadli poison done up into tabloid
and gave on to each of them my advic is i ad that if you see
we ar go to be expos to tortur or to ani dread form of death
you should take on of these as i mean to do and cheat the abati of
their vengeanc
that is all veri fine said the professor as he pocket hi tabloid
but i never could swallow a pill without water at the best of time
and i dont believ those beast will give on ani well i suppos i
must suck it that all oh if onli the luck would turn if onli the
luck would turn
three more dai went by without ani sign of higgss aspir be
fulfil on the contrari except in on respect the luck remain
steadili against us the except wa that we got plenti to eat and
consequ regain our normal state of health and strength more
rapidli than might have been expect with us it wa liter a case
of let us eat and drink for tomorrow we die
onli somehow i dont think that ani of us realli believ that we should
die though whether thi wa becaus we had all except poor quick
surviv so much or from a sneak faith in maqueda optimist
dream i cannot sai at ani rate we at our food with appetit took
exercis in an inner yard of the prison and strove to grow as strong as
we could feel that soon we might need all our power oliv wa the
most miser among us not for hi own sake but becaus poor fellow
he wa haunt with fear as to maqueda and her fate although of these
he said littl or noth to us on the other hand my son roderick wa
by far the most cheer he had live for so mani year upon the brink
of death that thi familiar gulf seem to have no terror for him
all come right somehow my father he said airili who can know what
happen perhap child of king drag us out of mudhol for after all
she wa veri strong cow or what you call it heifer and i think toss
joshua if he drive her into corner or perhap other thing occur
what other thing roderick i ask
oh dont know cant sai but i think fung thing believ we not done
with fung yet believ thei not run far believ thei take thought for
morrow and come back again onli he ad sadli hope my wife not
come back for that old girl too full of lofti temper for me still
cheer up not dead yet by long dai march and meanwhil food good
and thi veri jolli rest after beastli underground citi now i tell
professor some more stori about fung religion den of lion and so
forth
on the morn after thi convers a crisi came just as we had
finish breakfast the door of our chamber were thrown open and in
march a number of soldier wear joshua badg thei were head by
an offic of hi household who command us to rise and follow him
where to ask orm
to take your trial befor the child of king and her council gentil
upon the charg of have murder certain of her subject answer
the offic sternli
that all right said higg with a sigh of relief if maqueda is
chairman of the bench we ar pretti certain of an acquitt for orm
sake if not for our own
dont you be too sure of that i whisper into hi ear the
circumst ar peculiar and women have been known to chang their
mind
adam he repli glare at me through hi smoke spectacl if
you talk like that we shall quarrel maqueda chang her mind inde
why it is an insult to suggest such a thing and if you take my advic
you wont let oliv hear you dont you rememb man that she in
love with him
oh ye i answer but i rememb also that princ joshua is in
love with her and that she is hi prison
chapter xx
the trial and after
thei set us in a line four raggedlook fellow all of us with
beard of variou degre of growth that is all the other three for
mine had been an establish fact for year and everyth have been
taken awai from us we possess neither razor nor scissor
in the courtyard of our barrack we were met by a compani of soldier
who encircl us about with a tripl line of men as we thought to
prevent ani attempt of escap so soon as we pass the gate i found
howev that thi wa done for a differ reason name to protect
us from the furi of the populac all the wai from the barrack to the
courthous whither we were be taken now that the palac wa burn
the peopl were gather in hundr liter howl for our blood
it wa a strang and in a wai a dread sight to see even the
brightli dress women and children shake their fist and spit at
us with face distort by hate
why thei love you so littl father when you do so much for them
ask roderick shrug hi shoulder and dodg a stone that nearli
hit him on the head
for two reason i answer becaus their ladi love on of us too
much and becaus through us mani of their peopl have lost their live
also thei hate stranger and ar by natur cruel like most coward
and now that thei have no more fear of the fung thei think it will be
safe to kill us
ah said roderick yet harmac ha come to mur and he point to the
great head of the idol seat on the cliff and i think where harmac
goe fung follow and if so thei make them pai plenti for my life for
i great man among fung fung myself husband of sultan daughter these
fool like children becaus thei see no fung think there ar no fung
well in on year or perhap on month thei learn
i daresai my boi i answer but i am afraid that wont help us
by now we were approach the courthous where the abati priest and
learn men tri civil and some crimin case through a mob of nobl
and soldier who mock us as we went we were hustl into the larg
hall of judgment that wa alreadi full to overflow
up the centr of it we march to a clear space reserv for the parti
to a caus or prison and their advoc beyond which against the
wall were seat for the judg these were five member of the council
on of whom wa joshua while in the centr as presid of the court
and wear her veil and beauti robe of ceremoni sat maqueda
herself
thank god she safe mutter oliv with a gasp of relief
ye answer higg but what she do there she ought to be in
the dock too not on the bench
we reach the open space and were thrust by soldier arm with sword
to where we must stand and although each of us bow to her i observ
that maqueda took not the slightest notic of our salut she onli
turn her head and said someth to joshua on her right which caus
him to laugh
then with startl sudden the case began a kind of public
prosecutor stood forward and drone out the charg against us it wa
that we who were in the emploi of the abati had traitor taken
advantag of our posit as mercenari captain to stir up a civil
war in which mani peopl had lost their live and some been actual
murder by ourselv and our companion who wa dead moreov that
we had caus their palac to be burn and greatest crime of all had
seiz the sacr person of the walda nagasta rose of mur and drag
her awai into the recess of the underground citi whenc she wa onli
rescu by the chanc of an accomplic of our on japhet betrai
our hidingplac
thi wa the charg which it will be note contain no allus
whatev to the love entangl between maqueda and oliv when it
wa finish the prosecutor ask us what we plead whereon oliv
answer as our spokesman that it wa true there had been fight and
men kill also that we had been driven into the cave but as to all
the rest the child of king knew the truth and must speak for us as she
wish
now the audienc began to shout thei plead guilti give them to
death and so forth while the judg rise from their seat gather
round maqueda and consult her
by heaven i believ she is go to give us awai exclaim higg
whereon oliv turn on him fierc and bade him hold hi tongu
ad
if you were anywher els you should answer for that slander
at length the consult wa finish the judg resum their seat
and maqueda held up her hand thereon an intens silenc fell upon the
place then she began to speak in a cold constrain voic
gentil she said address us you have plead guilti to the
stir up of civil war in mur and to the slai of number of it
peopl fact of which there is no need for evid sinc mani widow
and fatherless children can testifi to them todai moreov you did
as alleg by my offic commit the crime of bear off my person into
the cave and keep me there by forc to be a hostag for your safeti
we heard and gasp higg ejacul good graciou what a lie but
none of the rest of us said anyth
for these offenc went on maqueda you ar all of you justli worthi
of a cruel death then she paus and ad yet as i have the power
to do i remit the sentenc i decre that thi dai you and all the
good that remain to you which have been found in the cave citi and
elsewher togeth with camel for yourselv and your baggag shall
be driven from mur and that if ani on of you return hither he shall
without further trial be hand over to the execution thi i do
becaus at the begin of your servic a certain bargain wa made with
you and although you have sin so deepli i will not suffer that
the gloriou honour of the abati peopl shall be tarnish even by the
breath of suspicion get you gone wander and let us see your face
no more for ever
now the mob gather in the hall shout in exult though i heard
some cry out no kill them kill them
when the tumult had di down maqueda spoke again sai
o nobl and gener abati you approv of thi deed of merci you who
would not be held merciless in far land o abati where although you
mai not have heard of them there ar i believ other peopl who
think themselv as great as you you would not have it whisper i
sai that we who ar the best of the world we the children of solomon
have dealt harshli even with strai dog that have wander to our gate
moreov we call these dog to hunt a certain beast for us the
lionhead beast call fung and to be just to them thei hunt
well therefor spare them the noos though thei mai have deserv it
and let them run henc with their bone sai you the bone which thei
think that thei have earn what doe a bone more or less matter to the
rich abati if onli their holi ground is not defil with the blood of
gentil dog
noth at all noth at all thei shout tie it to their tail
and let them go
it shall be done o my peopl and now that we have finish with these
dog i have anoth word to sai to you you mai have thought or heard
that i wa too fond of them and especi of on of them and she
glanc toward oliv well there ar certain dog who will not work
unless you pat them on the head therefor i pat thi on on the
head sinc after all he is a clever dog who know thing that we do
not know for instanc how to destroi the idol of the fung o great
abati can ani of you realli have believ that i of the ancient race
of solomon and sheba i the child of king purpos to give my nobl
hand to a vagrant gentil come hither for hire can you realli have
believ that i the solemnli betroth to yonder princ of princ
joshua my uncl would for a moment even in my heart have prefer to
him such a man as that and onc again she look at oliv who made
a wild motion as though he were about to speak but befor he could so
much as open hi lip maqueda went on
well if you believ not guess all the while i wa work for the
safeti of my peopl soon shall you be undeceiv sinc tomorrow night
i invit you to the great ceremoni of my nuptial when accord to
the ancient custom i break the glass with him whom on the follow
night i take to be my husband and rise she bow thrice to the
audienc then stretch out her hand to joshua
he too rose puf himself out like a great turkeycock and take
her hand kiss it gobbl some word which we did not catch
wild cheer follow and in the momentari silenc which follow
oliv spoke
ladi he said in a cold and bitter voic we gentil have heard
your word we thank you for your kind acknowledg of our servic
name the destruct of the idol of the fung at the cost of some
risk and labour to ourselv we thank you also for your generos in
allow us as the reward of that servic to depart from mur with
insult and hard word and such good as remain to us instead of
consign us to death by tortur as you and your council have the
power to do it is inde a proof of your generos and of that of the
abati peopl which we shall alwai rememb and repeat in our own land
should we live to reach it also we trust that it will come to the
ear of the savag fung so that at length thei mai understand that
true nobil and great lie not in brutal deed of arm but in the
heart of men but now walda nagasta i have a last request to make of
you name that i mai see your face onc more to be sure that it is
you who have spoken to us and not anoth beneath your veil and that
if thi be so i mai carri awai with me a faith pictur of on so

thi dai
she listen then veri slowli lift her veil reveal such a
counten as i had never seen befor it wa maqueda without a doubt
but maqueda chang her face wa pale which wa onli to be expect
after all she had gone through her ey glow in it like coal her
lip were set but it wa her express at onc defiant and agon
which impress me so much that i never shall forget it i confess i
could not read it in the least but it left upon my mind the belief that
she wa a fals woman and yet asham of her own falsiti there wa the
greatest triumph of her art that in those terribl circumst she
should still have succeed in convei to me and to the hundr of
other who watch thi convict of her own turpitud
for a moment her ey met those of orm but although he search
them with plead and despair in hi glanc i could trace in her no
relent sign but onli challeng not unmix with mockeri then with
a short hard laugh she let fall her veil again and turn to talk with
joshua oliv stood silent a littl while long enough for higg to
whisper to me
i sai isnt thi downright aw id rather be back in the den of
lion than live to see it
as he spoke i saw oliv put hi hand to where hi revolv usual
hung but of cours it had been taken from him next he began to
search in hi pocket and find that tabloid of poison which i had
given him lift it toward hi mouth but just as it touch hi lip
my son who wa next to him saw also with a quick motion he struck it
from hi finger and ground it to powder on the floor beneath hi heel
oliv rais hi arm as though to hit him then without a sound fell
senseless evid maqueda note all thi also for i saw a kind of
quiver go through her and her hand grip the arm of her chair till
the knuckl show white beneath the skin but she onli said
thi gentil ha faint becaus he is disappoint with hi reward
take him henc and let hi companion the doctor adam attend to him
when he is recov conduct them all from mur as i have decre see
that thei go unharm take with them plenti of food lest it be said
that we onli spare their live here in order that thei might starv
without our gate
then wave her hand to show that the matter wa done with she rose
and follow by the judg and offic left the court by some door
behind them
while she spoke a strong bodi of guard had surround us some of whom
came forward and lift the senseless oliv on to a stretcher thei
carri him down the court the rest of us follow
look jeer the abati as he pass look at the gentil pig who
thought to wear the bud of the rose upon hi bosom he ha got the thorn
now not the rose is the swine dead think you
thu thei mock him and us
we reach our prison in safeti and there i set to work to reviv
oliv a task in which i succeed at length when he had come to
himself again he drank a cup of water and said quit quietli
you fellow have seen all so there is no need for talk and
explan on thing i beg of you if you ar ani friend of mine
and it is that you will not reproach or even speak of maqueda to me
doubtless she had reason for what she did moreov her bring up
ha not been the same as our and her code is differ do not let us
judg her i have been a great fool that is all and now i am pai
for my folli or rather i have paid come let us have some dinner
for we dont know when we shall get anoth meal
we listen to thi speech in silenc onli i saw roderick turn asid to
hide a smile and wonder why he smile
scarc had we finish eat or pretend to eat when an offic
enter the room and inform us roughli that it wa time for us to
be go as he did so some attend who had follow him threw us
bundl of cloth and with them four veri beauti camelhair cloak
to protect us from the cold with some of these garment we replac our
rag for thei were littl more ty them and the rest of the outfit
up into bundl
then cloth as abati of the upper class we were taken to the gate
of the barrack where we found a long train of ride camel wait for
us the moment that i saw these beast i knew that thei were the best
in the whole land and of veri great valu inde that to which oliv
wa conduct wa maqueda own favourit dromedari which upon state
occas she sometim rode instead of a hors he recogn it at
onc poor fellow and colour to the ey at thi unexpect mark of
kind the onli on she had vouchsaf to him
come gentil said the offic and take count of your good that
you mai not sai that we have stolen anyth from you here ar your
firearm and all the ammunit that is left these will be given to you
at the foot of the pass but not befor lest you should do more murder
on the road on those camel ar fasten the box in which you brought
up the magic fire we found them in your quarter in the cave citi
readi pack but what thei contain we neither know nor care full or
empti take them thei ar your those and he point to two other
beast ar laden with your pai which the child of king send to you
request that you will not count it till you reach egypt or your own
land sinc she wish no quarrel with you as to the amount the
rest carri food for you to eat also there ar two spare beast now
mount and begon
so we climb into the embroid saddl of the kneel dromedari
and a few minut later were ride through mur toward the pass
accompani by our guard and hoot mob that onc or twice becam
threaten but were driven off by the soldier
i sai doctor said higg to me excitedli do you know that we
have got all the best of the treasur of the tomb of king in those
fiveandtwenti crate i have thought sinc that i wa crazi when i
pack them pick out the most valuabl and rare articl with such
care and fill in the crack with ring monei and small curios
but now i see it wa the inspir of geniu my sublimin self knew
what wa go to happen and wa on the job that all oh if onli
we can get it safe awai i shall not have plai daniel and been nearli
starv to death for noth why id go through it all again for that
golden head alon shove on shove on befor thei chang their mind
it seem too good to be true
just then a rotten egg thrown by some sweet abati youth land full on
the bridg of hi nose and dispers itself into hi mouth and over
hi smoke spectacl cut short the professor eloqu or rather
chang it tenor so absurd wa the sight that in spite of myself i
burst out laugh and with that laugh felt my heart grow lighter as
though our cloud of troubl were lift at length
at the mouth of the pass we found joshua himself wait for us clad
in all hi fineri and chain armour and look more like a porpois on
horseback than he had ever done
farewel gentil he said bow to us in mockeri we wish you a
quick journei to sheol or wherev such swine as you mai go listen
you orm i have a messag for you from the walda nagasta it is that
she is sorri she could not ask you to stop for her nuptial feast which
she would have done had she not been sure that if you stai the
peopl would have cut your throat and she did not wish the holi soil of
mur to be defil with your dog blood also she bid me sai that she
hope that your stai here will have taught you a lesson and that in
futur you will not believ that everi woman who make us of you for
her own end is therefor a victim of your charm tomorrow night and
the night after i prai you think of our happi and drink a cup of
wine to the walda nagasta and her husband come will you not wish me
joi o gentil
orm turn white as a sheet and gaze at him steadili then a strang
look came into hi grei ey almost a look of inspir
princ joshua he said in a veri quiet voic who know what mai
happen befor the sun rise thrice on mur all thing that begin well do
not end well as i have learn and as you also mai live to learn at
least soon or late your dai of reckon must come and you too mai
be betrai as i have been rather should you ask me to forgiv your
soul the insult that in your hour of triumph you have not been asham
to heap upon on who is powerless to aveng them and he urg hi
camel past him
as we follow i saw joshua face turn as pale as oliv had done
and hi great round ey protrud themselv like those of a fish
what doe he mean said the princ to hi companion prai god he is
not a prophet of evil even now i have a mindno let him go to break
my marriag vow might bring bad luck upon me let him go and he glare
after oliv with fear and hatr written on hi coars featur
that wa the last we ever saw of joshua uncl of maqueda and first
princ among the abati
down the pass we went and through the variou gate of the
fortif which were thrown open as we came and close behind us
we did not linger on that journei why should we when our guard were
anxiou to be rid of us and we of them inde so soon as the last gate
wa behind us either from fear of the fung or becaus thei were in a
hurri to return to share in the festiv of the approach marriag
suddenli the abati wheel round bade us farewel with a part curs
and left us to our own devic
so have rope the camel into a long line we went on alon truli
thank to be rid of them and prai everi on of us that never
in thi world or the next might we see the face or hear the voic of
anoth abati
we emerg on to the plain at the spot where month befor we had held
our confer with barung sultan of the fung and where poor quick had
forc hi camel on to joshua hors and dismount that hero here we
paus awhil to arrang our littl caravan and arm ourselv with
the rifl revolv and cartridg which until now we had not been
allow to touch
there were but four of us to manag the long train of camel so we were
oblig to separ higg and i went ahead sinc i wa best acquaint
with the desert and the road oliv took the central station and
roderick brought up the rear becaus he wa veri keen of sight and
hear and from hi long familiar with them knew how to drive
camel that show sign of obstinaci or a wish to turn
on our right lai the great citi of harmac we note that it seem to be
quit desert there rebuilt now frown the gatewai through which we
had escap from the fung after we had blown so mani of them to piec
but beneath it none pass in or out the town wa empti and although
thei were dead ripe the rich crop had not yet been reap appar
the fung peopl had now left the land
now we were opposit to the vallei of harmac and saw that the huge
sphinx still sat there as it had done for unknown thousand of year
onli it head wa gone for that had move to mur and in it neck
and shoulder appear great cleft caus by the terrif forc of the
explos moreov no sound came from the enclosur where the sacr
lion us to be doubtless everi on of them wa dead
dont you think suggest higg whose archolog zeal wa
rekindl fast that we might spare halfanhour to go up the vallei
and have a look at harmac from the outsid of cours both roderick and
i ar thoroughli acquaint with hi insid and the den of lion and
so forth but i would give a great deal just to studi the rest of him
and take a few measur you know on must camp somewher and if we
cant find the camera at dawn on might make a sketch
ar you mad i ask by wai of answer and higg collaps but to
thi hour he ha never forgiven me
we look our last upon harmac the god whose glori we had destroi
and went on swiftli till dark overtook us almost opposit to that
ruin villag where shadrach had tri to poison the hound pharaoh
which afterward tore out hi throat here we unload the camel no
light task and camp for near thi spot there wa water and a patch
of maiz on which the beast could feed
befor the light quit fade roderick rode forward for a littl wai to
reconnoitr and present return announc shortli that he had seen
no on so we at of the food with which the abati had provid us not
without fear lest it should be poison and then held a council of war
the question wa whether we should take the old road toward egypt or
now that the swamp were dry strike up northward by the other rout of
which shadrach had told us accord to the map thi should be shorter
and higg advoc it strongli as i discov afterward becaus he
thought there might be more archolog remain in that direct
i on the other hand wa in favour of follow the road we knew
which although long and veri wearisom wa compar safe as in
that vast desert there were few peopl to attack us while oliv our
captain listen to all we had to sai and reserv hi opinion
present howev the question wa settl for us by roderick who
remark that if we travel to the north we should probabl fall in
with the fung i ask what he meant and he repli that when he made
hi reconnaiss an hour or so befor although it wa true that he
had seen no on not a thousand yard from where we sat he had come
across the track of a great armi thi armi from variou indic
he felt sure wa that of barung which had pass there within twelv
hour
perhap my wife with them so i no want to go that wai father he
ad with sincer simplic
where could thei be travel i ask
dont know he answer but think thei go round to attack mur from
other side or perhap to find new land to north
we will stick to the old road said oliv briefli like roderick i
have had enough of all the inhabit of thi countri now let us rest
awhil we need it
about two oclock we were up again and befor it wa dawn on the
follow morn we had load our camel and were on the road by the
first faint light we saw that what roderick had told us wa true we
were cross the track of an armi of mani thousand men who had pass
there recent with laden camel and hors moreov those men were
fung for we pick up some articl that could have belong to no
other peopl such as a headdress that had been lost or thrown awai
and an arrow that had fallen from a quiver
howev we saw noth of them and travel fast to our great
relief by middai reach the river ebur which we cross without
difficulti for it wa now low that night we camp in the forestland
beyond have all the afternoon march up the rise ground at the
foot of which ran the river
toward dawn higg whose turn it wa to watch the camel came and woke
me
sorri to disturb you old fellow he said but there is a most
curiou sky effect behind us which i thought you might like to see
i rose and look in the clear starlight night i could just discern
the mighti outlin of the mountain of mur abov them the firmament wa
suffus with a strang red glow i form my own conclus at onc
but onli said
let us go to tell orm and led the wai to where he had lain down
under a tree
he wa not sleep inde i do not think he had close hi ey all
night the night of maqueda marriag on the contrari he wa stand
on a littl knoll stare at the distant mountain and the glow abov
them
mur is on fire he said solemnli oh my god mur is on fire and
turn he walk awai
just then roderick join us
fung got into mur he said and now cut throat of all abati we well
out of that but pig joshua have veri warm wed feast becaus barung
hate joshua who try to catch him not fairli which he never forget
often talk of it
poor maqueda i said to higg what will happen to her
i dont know he answer but although onc like everybodi els
i ador that girl realli as a matter of justic she deserv all she
get the falseheart littl wretch still it is true he ad
relent she gave us veri good camel to sai noth of their
load
but i onli repeat poor maqueda
that dai we made but a short journei sinc we wish to rest ourselv
and fill the camel befor plung into the wilder and feel
sure that we should not be pursu had no caus to hurri at night we
camp in a littl hollow by a stream that ran at the foot of a rise as
dawn broke we were awaken by the voic of roderick who wa on watch
call to us in tone of alarm to get up as we were follow we
sprang to our feet seiz our rifl
where ar thei i ask
there there he said point toward the rise behind us
we ran round some interven bush and look to see upon it crest a
solitari figur seat on a veri tire hors for it pant and it head
droop thi figur which wa entir hidden in a long cloak with
a hood appear to be watch our camp just as a spy might do higg
lift hi rifl and fire at it but oliv who wa stand by him
knock the barrel up so that the bullet went high sai
dont be a fool if it is onli on man there no need to shoot him
and if there ar more you will bring them on to us
then the figur urg the weari hors and advanc slowli and i notic
that it wa veri small a boi i thought to myself who is bring
some messag
the rider reach us and slip from the hors stood still
who ar you ask oliv scan the cloak form
on who bring a token to you lord wa the answer spoken in a low
and muffl voic here it is and a hand a veri delic hand wa
stretch out hold between the finger a ring
i knew it at onc it wa sheba ring which maqueda had lent to me in
proof of her good faith when i journei for help to england thi ring
it will be rememb we return to her with much ceremoni at our
first public audienc oliv grew pale at the sight of it
how did you come by thi he ask hoars is she who alon mai
wear it dead
ye ye answer the voic a feign voic as i thought the child
of king whom you knew is dead and have no more need for thi ancient
symbol of her power she bequeath it to you whom she rememb kindli
at the last
oliv cover hi face with hi hand and turn awai
but went on the speaker slowli the woman maqueda whom onc it is
said you love
he drop hi hand and stare
the woman maqueda whom onc it is said youlovedstil live
then the hood slip back and in the glow of the rise sun we saw the
face beneath
it wa that of maqueda herself
a silenc follow that in it wai wa almost aw
my lord oliv ask maqueda present do you accept my offer of
queen sheba ring
note by maqueda
onc call walda nagasta and takla warda that is child of king and
bud of the rose onc also by birth ruler of the abati peopl the son
of solomon and sheba
i maqueda write thi by the command of oliv my lord who desir
that i should set out certain thing in my own word
truli all men ar fool and the greatest of them is oliv my lord
though perhap he is almost equal by the learn man whom the abati
call black window and by the doctor son of adam onli he who is
name roderick child of adam is somewhat less blind becaus have
been brought up among the fung and other peopl of the desert he ha
gather a littl wisdom thi i know becaus he ha told me that he
alon saw through my plan to save all their live but said noth of
it becaus he desir to escap from mur where certain death wait on
him and hi companion perhap howev he li to pleas me
now for the truth of the matter which not be skill in write i
will tell briefli
i wa carri out of the cave citi with my lord and the other
starv starv too weak to kill myself which otherwis i would
have done rather than fall into the hand of my accurs uncl joshua
yet i wa stronger than the rest becaus as i have learn thei
trick me about those biscuit pretend to eat when thei were not
eat for which never will i forgiv them it wa japhet a gallant
man on on side but a coward on the other like the rest of the abati
who betrai us driven thereto by empti within which after all
is an ill enemi to fight he went out and told joshua where we lai hid
and then of cours thei came
well thei took awai my lord and the other and me too thei bore to
anoth place and fed me till my strength return and oh how good wa
that honei which first i at for i could touch noth els when i wa
strong again came princ joshua to me and said now i have you in my
net now you ar mine
then i answer joshua fool your net is of air i will fly through
it
how he ask by death i answer of which a hundr mean lie
to my hand you have rob me of on but what doe that matter when so
mani remain i will go where you and your love cannot pursu me
veri well child of king he said but how about that tall gentil
who ha caught your ey and hi companion thei too have recov
and thei shall die everi on of them after a certain fashion which i
maqueda will not set down sinc there ar some thing that ought not
to be written if you die thei die as i told you thei die as a wolf
di that is caught by the shepherd thei die as a baboon di that is
caught by the husbandman
now i look thi wai and that and found that there wa no escap so i
made a bargain
joshua i said let these men go and i swear upon the name of our
mother she of sheba that i will marri you keep them and kill them
and you will have none of me
well in the end becaus he desir me and the power that went with me
he consent
then i plai my part my lord and hi companion were brought befor
me and in presenc of all the peopl i mock them i spat in their
face and oh fool fool fool thei believ me i lift my veil
and show them my ey and thei believ also what thei seem to see
in my ey forget that i am a woman who can plai a part at need
ye thei forgot that there were other to deceiv as well all the
abati peopl who if thei thought i trick them would have torn the
foreign limb from limb that wa my bitterest morsel that i should
have succeed in make even my own lord believ that of all the wick
women that ever trod thi world i wa the most vile yet i did so and
he cannot deni it for often we have talk of thi thing till he will
hear of it no more
well thei went with all that i could give them though i knew well that
my lord care noth for what i could give nor the doctor child of
adam either who care onli for hi son that god had restor to him
onli black window care not becaus he love wealth but becaus he
worship all that is old and ugli for of such thing he fashion up hi
god
thei went for their go wa report to me and i i enter into
hell becaus i knew that my lord thought me fals and that he would
never learn the truth name that what i did i did to save hi life
until at length he came to hi own countri if ever he came there and
open the chest of treasur if ever he open them which perhap he
would not care to do and all that while he would believ me the wife
of joshua andoh i cannot write of it and i i should be dead i i
could not tell him the truth until he join me in that land of death
if there men and women can talk togeth ani more
for thi and no other wa the road that i had plan to walk when he
and hi companion had gone so far that thei could not be follow
then i would tell joshua and the abati all the truth in such languag as
should never be forgotten for gener and kill myself befor their
ey so that joshua might lack a wife and the abati a child of king
i sat through the feast of prepar and smile and smile it pass
and the next dai pass and came the night of the feast of marriag
the glass wa broken the ceremoni wa fulfil joshua rose up to
pledg me befor all the priest lord and headmen he devour me
with hi hate ey me who wa alreadi hi but i i handl the
knife in my robe wish such wa the rage in my heart that i could
kill him also
then god spoke and the dream that i had dream came true far awai
there rose a singl cry and after it other cri and the sound of
shout and of march feet far awai tongu of fire leapt into the
air and each man ask hi neighbour what is thi then from all the
thousand of the feast peopl rose on giant scream and that scream
said fung fung the fung ar on us fly fly fly
come shout joshua seiz me by the arm but i drew my dagger on
him and he let go then he fled with the other lord and i remain in
my high seat beneath the golden canopi alon
the peopl fled past me without fight thei fled into the cave citi
thei fled to the rock thei hid themselv among the precipic and
after them came the fung slai and burn till all mur went up in
flame and i i sat and watch wait till it wa time for me to die
also
at last i know not how long afterward appear befor me barung a
red sword in hi hand which he lift to me in salut
greet child of king he said you see harmac is come to sleep at
mur
ye i answer harmac is come to sleep at mur and mani of those
who dwelt there sleep with him what of it sai barung will you kill
me or shall i kill myself
neither child of king he answer in hi high fashion did i not
make you a promis yonder in the pass of mur when i spoke with you and
the western men and doe a fung sultan break hi word i have taken
back the citi that wa our as i swore to do and purifi it with
fire and he point to the rage flame now i will rebuild it and
you shall rule under me
not so i answer but in place of that promis i ask of you three
thing
name them said barung
thei ar these first that you give me a good hors and five dai
food and let me go where i will secondli that if he still live you
advanc on japhet a certain mountain who befriend me and brought
other to do likewis to a place of honour under you thirdli that you
spare the rest of the abati peopl
you shall go whither you desir and i think i know where you will go
answer barung certain spi of mine last night saw four white men
ride on fine camel toward egypt and report it to me as i led my
armi to the secret pass that harmac show me which you abati could
never find but i said let them go it is right that brave men who
have been the mock of the abati should be allow their freedom ye
i said thi although on of them wa my daughter husband or near to
it but she will have no more of him who fled to hi father rather than
with her so it wa best that he should go also sinc if i brought him
back it must be to hi death
ye i answer boldli i go after the western men i who have done
with these abati i wish to see new land
and find an old love who think ill of you just now he said stroke
hi beard well no wonder for here ha been a marriag feast sai
what were you about to do o child of king take the fat joshua to your
breast
nai barung i wa about to take thi husband to my breast and i
show him the knife that wa hidden in my marriag robe
no he said smile i think the knife wa for joshua first still
you ar a brave woman who could save the life of him you love at
the cost of your own yet bethink you child of king for mani a
gener your mother have been queen and under me you mai still
remain a queen how will on whose blood ha rule so long endur to
serv a western man in a strang land
that is what i go to find out barung and if i cannot endur then i
shall come back again though not to rule the abati of whom i wash my
hand for ever yet barung my heart tell me i shall endur
the child of king ha spoken he said bow to me my best hors
await her and five of my bravest guard shall ride with her to keep
her safe till she sight the camp of the western men i sai happi is he
of them who wa born to wear the sweetscent bud of the rose upon hi
bosom for the rest the man japhet is in my hand he yield himself
to me who would not fight for hi own peopl becaus of what thei had
done to hi friend the white men lastli alreadi i have given order
that the slai should ceas sinc i need the abati to be my slave
thei who ar coward but cun in mani art onli on more man shall
die he ad sternli and that is joshua who would have taken me by
a trick in the mouth of the pass so plead not for him for by the head
of harmac it is in vain
now hear thi i did not plead fear lest i should anger barung
and but wast my breath
at daybreak i start on the hors have with me the five fung
captain as we cross the marketplac i met those that remain aliv
of the abati be driven in hord like beast to hear their doom
among them wa princ joshua my uncl whom a man led by a rope about
hi neck while anoth man thrust him forward from behind sinc joshua
knew that he went to hi death and the road wa on which he did not
wish to travel he saw me and cast himself down upon the ground cry
to me to save him i told him that i could not though it is the truth
i swear it befor god that notwithstand all the evil he had work
toward me toward oliv my lord and hi companion bring to hi
end that gallant man who di to protect me i would still have save
him if i could but i could not for although i tri onc more barung
would not listen so i answer
plead o joshua with him who ha the power in mur todai for i have
none you have fashion your own fate and must travel the road you
chose
what road do you ride mount on a hors of the plain maqueda oh
what need is there for me to ask you go to see that accurs gentil
whom i would i had kill by inch as i would that i could kill you
then call me by evil name joshua sprang at me as though to strike
me down but he who held the rope about hi neck jerk him backward so
that he fell and i saw hi face no more
but oh it wa sad that journei across the great squar for the
captiv abati by hundredsmen women and children togetherwith tear
and lament cri to me to preserv them from death or slaveri at
the hand of the fung but i answer
your sin against me and the brave foreign men who fought so well
for you i forgiv but search your heart o abati and sai if you can
forgiv yourselv if you had listen to me and to those whom i call
in to help us you might have beaten back the fung and remain free
for ever but you were coward you would not learn to bear arm like
men you would not even watch your mountain wall and soon or late the
peopl who refus to be readi to fight must fall and becom the servant
of those who ar readi
and now my oliv i have no more to write save that i am glad to have
endur so mani thing and therebi win the joi that is mine todai
not yet have i maqueda wish to reign again in mur who have found
anoth throne
