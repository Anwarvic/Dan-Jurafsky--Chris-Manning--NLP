why thoma wingfield tell hi tale
now glori be to god who ha given us the victori it is true the
strength of spain is shatter her ship ar sunk or fled the sea ha
swallow her soldier and her sailor by hundr and by thousand and
england breath again thei came to conquer to bring us to the tortur
and the staketo do to us free englishmen as cort did by the indian
of anahuac our manhood to the slave bench our daughter to dishonour
our soul to the lovingkind of the priest our wealth to the
emperor and the pope god ha answer them with hi wind drake ha
answer them with hi gun thei ar gone and with them the glori of
spain
i thoma wingfield heard the new todai on thi veri thursdai in the
bungai marketplac whither i went to gossip and to sell the appl
which these dread gale have left me as thei hang upon my tree
befor there had been rumour of thi and of that but here in bungai
wa a man name young of the young of yarmouth who had serv in on
of the yarmouth ship in the fight at gravelin ay and sail north
after the spaniard till thei were lost in the scottish sea
littl thing lead to great men sai but here great thing lead to
littl for becaus of these tide it come about that i thoma
wingfield of the lodg and the parish of ditchingham in the counti of
norfolk be now of a great ag and have onli a short time to live
turn to pen and ink ten year ago name in the year 1578 it pleas
her majesti our graciou queen elizabeth who at that date visit thi
counti that i should be brought befor her at norwich there and then
sai that the fame of it had reach her she command me to give
her some particular of the stori of my life or rather of those twenti
year more or less which i spent among the indian at that time when
cort conquer their countri of anahuac which is now known as mexico
but almost befor i could begin my tale it wa time for her to start
for cossei to hunt the deer and she said it wa her wish that i should
write the stori down that she might read it and moreov that if it
were but half as wonder as it promis to be i should end my dai
as sir thoma wingfield to thi i answer her majesti that pen and ink
were tool i had no skill in yet i would bear her command in mind
then i made bold to give her a great emerald that onc had hung upon the
breast of montezuma daughter and of mani a princess befor her and
at the sight of it her ey glisten brightli as the gem for thi
queen of our love such costli playth inde had i so desir
i think that i might then and there have struck a bargain and set the
stone against a titl but i who for mani year had been the princ of
a great tribe had no wish to be a knight so i kiss the royal hand
and so tightli did it grip the gem within that the knuckl joint shone
white and i went my wai come back home to thi my hous by the
wavenei on that same dai
now the queen wish that i should set down the stori of my life
remain in my mind and for long i have desir to do it befor life
and stori end togeth the labour inde is great to on unus to
such task but why should i fear labour who am so near to the holidai
of death i have seen thing that no other englishman ha seen which
ar worthi to be record my life ha been most strang mani a time it
ha pleas god to preserv it when all seem lost and thi perchanc
he ha done that the lesson of it might becom known to other for
there is a lesson in it and in the thing that i have seen and it is
that no wrong can ever bring about a right that wrong will breed wrong
at last and be it in man or peopl will fall upon the brain that
thought it and the hand that wrought it
look now at the fate of cortesthat great man whom i have known cloth
with power like a god nearli forti year ago so i have heard he di
poor and disgrac in spain he the conquerory and i have learn
also that hi son don martin ha been put to the tortur in that citi
which the father won with so great cruelti for spain malinch she
whom the spaniard name marina the chief and best belov of all the
women of thi same cort foretold it to him in her anguish when after
all that had been after she had so mani time preserv him and hi
soldier to look upon the sun at the last he desert her give her
in marriag to don juan xaramillo look again at the fate of marina
herself becaus she love thi man cort or malinch as the indian
name him after her she brought evil on her nativ land for without
her aid tenoctitlan or mexico as thei call it now had never bow
beneath the yoke of spainy she forgot her honour in her passion
and what wa her reward what right came to her of her wrongdo thi
wa her reward at last to be given awai in marriag to anoth and
a lesser man when her beauti wane as a wornout beast is sold to a
poorer master
consid also the fate of those great peopl of the land of anahuac
thei did evil that good might come thei sacrif the live of
thousand to their fals god that their wealth might increas and
peac and prosper be their throughout the gener and now the
true god ha answer them for wealth he ha given them desol for
peac the sword of the spaniard for prosper the rack and the
torment and the dai of slaveri for thi it wa that thei did sacrific
offer their own children on the altar of huitzel and of tezcat
and the spaniard themselv who in the name of merci have wrought
cruelti greater than ani that were done by the benight aztec who
in the name of christ daili violat hi law to the uttermost extrem
sai shall thei prosper shall their evildo bring them welfar i am
old and cannot live to see the question answer though even now it
is in the wai of answer yet i know that their wicked shall
fall upon their own head and i seem to see them the proudest of the
peopl of the earth bereft of fame and wealth and honour a starvel
remnant happi in noth save their past what drake began at gravelin
god will finish in mani anoth place and time till at last spain is of
no more account and li as low as the empir of montezuma li todai
thu it is in these great instanc of which all the world mai know and
thu it is even in the life of so humbl a man as i thoma wingfield
heaven inde ha been merci to me give me time to repent my sin
yet my sin have been visit on my head on me who took hi prerog
of vengeanc from the hand of the most high it is just and becaus it
is so i wish to set out the matter of my life histori that other mai
learn from it for mani year thi ha been in my mind as i have said
though to speak truth it wa her majesti the queen who first set the
seed but onli on thi dai when i have heard for certain of the fate of
the armada doe it begin to grow and who can sai if ever it will come
to flower for thi tide ha stir me strang bring back my
youth and the deed of love and war and wild adventur which i have been
mingl in fight for my own hand and for guatemoc and the peopl of
the otomi against these same spaniard as thei have not been brought
back for mani year inde it seem to me and thi is no rare thing
with the ag as though there in the far past my true life lai and all
the rest were noth but a dream
from the window of the room wherein i write i can see the peac
vallei of the wavenei beyond it stream ar the common land golden
with gors the ruin castl and the red roof of bungai town gather
about the tower of st mari church yonder far awai ar the king
forest of stow and the field of flixton abbei to the right the steep
bank is green with the earsham oak to the left the fast marsh land
spot with cattl stretch on to beccl and lowestoft while behind me
my garden and orchard rise in terrac up the turfi hill that in old
dai wa known as the earl vineyard all these ar about me and yet
in thi hour thei ar as though thei were not for the vallei of the
wavenei i see the vale of tenoctitlan for the slope of stow the snowi
shape of the volcan popo and iztac for the spire of earsham and the
tower of ditchingham of bungai and of beccl the soar pyramid
of sacrific gleam with the sacr fire and for the cattl in the
meadow the horsemen of cort sweep to war
it come back to me that wa life the rest is but a dream onc more
i feel young and should i be spare so long i will set down the stori
of my youth befor i am laid in yonder churchyard and lost in the world
of dream long ago i had begun it but it wa onli on last christma
dai that my dear wife di and while she live i knew that thi task
wa better left undon inde to be frank it wa thu with my wife
she love me i believ as few men have the fortun to be love and
there is much in my past that jar upon thi love of her move her
to a jealousi of the dead that wa not the less deep becaus it wa so
gentl and so close coupl with forgiv for she had a secret
sorrow that at her heart awai although she never spoke of it but on
child wa born to us and thi child di in infanc nor for all her
prayer did it pleas god to give her anoth and inde rememb
the word of otomi i did not expect that it would be so now she knew
well that yonder across the sea i had children whom i love by anoth
wife and though thei were long dead must alwai love unalter and
thi thought wrung her heart that i had been the husband of anoth
woman she could forgiv but that thi woman should have born me
children whose memori wa still so dear she could not forget if she
forgav it she who wa childless why it wa so be but a man i
cannot sai for who can know all the mysteri of a love woman heart
but so it wa onc inde we quarrel on the matter it wa our
onli quarrel
it chanc that when we had been marri but two year and our babe wa
some few dai buri in the churchyard of thi parish of ditchingham
i dream a veri vivid dream as i slept on night at my wife side
i dream that my dead children the four of them for the tallest lad
bore in hi arm my firstborn that infant who di in the great sieg
came to me as thei had often come when i rule the peopl of the otomi
in the citi of pine and talk with me give me flower and kiss
my hand i look upon their strength and beauti and wa proud at
heart and in my dream it seem as though some great sorrow had been
lift from my mind as though these dear on had been lost and now
were found again ah what miseri is there like to thi miseri of
dream that can thu give us back our dead in mockeri and then
depart leav us with a keener woe
well i dream on talk with my children in my sleep and name them
by their belov name till at length i woke to look on empti and
know all my sorrow i sob aloud now it wa earli morn and the
light of the august sun stream through the window but i deem
that my wife slept still lai in the shadow of my dream as it were and
groan murmur the name of those whom i might never see again
it chanc howev that she wa awak and had overheard those word
which i spoke with the dead while i wa yet asleep and after and
though some of thi talk wa in the tongu of the otomi the most wa
english and know the name of my children she guess the purport
of it all suddenli she sprang from the bed and stood over me and there
wa such anger in her ey as i had never seen befor nor have seen
sinc nor did it last long then for present inde it wa quench
in tear
what is it wife i ask astonish
it is hard she answer that i must bear to listen to such talk
from your lip husband wa it not enough that when all men thought
you dead i wore my youth awai faith to your memori though how
faith you were to mine you know best did i ever reproach you becaus
you had forgotten me and wed a savag woman in a distant land
never dear wife nor had i forgotten you as you know well but what
i wonder at is that you should grow jealou now when all caus is done
with
cannot we be jealou of the dead with the live we mai cope but who
can fight against the love which death ha complet seal it for
ever and make it immort still that i forgiv you for against thi
woman i can hold my own see that you were mine befor you becam
her and ar mine after it but with the children it is otherwis thei
ar her and your alon i have no part nor lot in them and whether
thei be dead or live i know well you love them alwai and will love
them beyond the grave if you mai find them there alreadi i grow old
who wait twenti year and more befor i wa your wife and i shall
give you no other children on i gave you and god took it back lest
i should be too happi yet it name wa not on your lip with those
strang name my dead babe is littl to you husband
here she choke burst into tear nor did i think it well to answer
her that there wa thi differ in the matter that wherea with
the except of on infant those son whom i had lost were almost
adolesc the babe she bore live but sixti dai
now when the queen first put it in my mind to write down the histori of
my life i rememb thi outbreak of my belov wife and see that
i could write no true tale and leav out of it the stori of her who wa
also my wife montezuma daughter otomi princess of the otomi and
of the children that she gave me i let the matter lie for i knew well
that though we spoke veri rare on the subject dure all the mani
year we pass togeth still it wa alwai in lili mind nor did
her jealousi be of the finer sort abat at all with ag but rather
gather with the gather dai that i should execut the task without
the knowledg of my wife would not have been possibl for till the veri
last she watch over my everi act and as i verili believ divin
the most of my thought
and so we grew old togeth peacefulli and side by side speak
seldom of that great gap in my life when we were lost to each other and
of all that then befel at length the end came my wife di suddenli
in her sleep in the eightyseventh year of her ag i buri her on the
south side of the church here with sorrow inde but not with sorrow
inconsol for i know that i must soon rejoin her and those other
whom i have love
there in that wide heaven ar my mother and my sister and my son
there ar great guatemoc my friend last of the emperor and mani other
companion in war who have preced me to peac there too though she
doubt of it is otomi the beauti and proud in the heaven which
i trust to reach all the sin of my youth and the error of my ag
notwithstand it is told us there is no marri and give in
marriag and thi is well for i do not know how my wive montezuma
daughter and the sweet english gentlewoman would agre togeth were it
otherwis
and now to my task
chapter ii
of the parentag of thoma wingfield
i thoma wingfield wa born here at ditchingham and in thi veri room
where i write todai the hous of my birth wa built or ad to earli
in the reign of the seventh henri but long befor hi time some kind of
tenement stood here which wa live in by the keeper of the vineyard
and known as garden lodg whether it chanc that the climat wa
more kindli in old time or the skill of those who tend the field
wa greater i do not know but thi at the least is true that the
hillsid beneath which the hous nestl and which onc wa the bank
of an arm of the sea or of a great broad wa a vineyard in earl bigod
dai long sinc it ha ceas to grow grape though the name of the
earl vineyard still cling to all that slope of land which li
between thi hous and a certain healthgiv spring that bubbl from
the bank the half of a mile awai in the water of which sick folk come
to bath even from norwich and lowestoft but shelter as it is from
the east wind to thi hour the place ha the advantag that garden
plant here ar earlier by fourteen dai than ani other in the countri
side and that a man mai sit in them coatless in the bitter month of
mai when on the top of the hill not two hundr pace henc he must
shiver in a jacket of otterskin
the lodg for so it ha alwai been name in it begin have
been but a farmhous face to the southwest and is built so low that
it might well be thought that the damp from the river wavenei which
run through the marsh close by would rise in it but thi is not so
for though in autumn the roke as here in norfolk we name ground fog
hang about the hous at nightfal and in season of great flood the
water ha been known to pour into the stabl at the back of it yet
be built on sand and gravel there is no healthier habit in the
parish for the rest the build is of studwork and red brick quaint
and mellow look with mani corner and gabl that in summer ar half
hidden in rose and other creep plant and with it outlook on
the marsh and the common where the light vari continu with the
season and even with the hour of the dai on the red roof of bungai
town and on the wood bank that stretch round the earsham land
though there ar mani larger to my mind there is none pleasant in
these part here in thi hous i wa born and here doubtless i shall
die and have spoken of it at some length as we ar wont to do of
spot which long custom ha endear to us i will go on to tell of my
parentag
first then i would set out with a certain pridefor who of us doe
not love an ancient name when we happen to be born to itthat i am
sprung from the famili of the wingfield of wingfield castl in suffolk
that li some two hour on horseback from thi place long ago the
heiress of the wingfield marri a de la pole a famili famou in our
histori the last of whom edmund earl of suffolk lost hi head for
treason when i wa young and the castl pass to the de la pole
with her but some offshoot of the old wingfield stock linger in the
neighbourhood perchanc there wa a bar sinist on their coat of arm
i know not and do not care to know at the least my father and i ar
of thi blood my grandfath wa a shrewd man more of a yeoman than
a squir though hi birth wa gentl he it wa who bought thi place
with the land round it and gather up some fortun mostli by care
marri and live for though he had but on son he wa twice marri
and also by trade in cattl
now my grandfath wa godlymind even to superstit and strang as
it mai seem have onli on son noth would satisfi him but that the
boi should be made a priest but my father had littl lean toward
the priesthood and life in a monasteri though at all season my
grandfath strove to reason it into him sometim with word and
exampl at other with hi thick cudgel of holli that still hang
over the ingl in the smaller sittingroom the end of it wa that the
lad wa sent to the priori here in bungai where hi conduct wa of such
natur that within a year the prior prai hi parent to take him back
and set him in some wai of secular life not onli so said the prior
did my father caus scandal by hi action break out of the priori
at night and visit drink hous and other place but such wa
the sum of hi wicked he did not scrupl to question and make
mock of the veri doctrin of the church alleg even that there
wa noth sacr in the imag of the virgin mari which stood in the
chancel and shut it ey in prayer befor all the congreg when
the priest elev the host therefor said the prior i prai you
take back your son and let him find some other road to the stake than
that which run through the gate of bungai priori
now at thi stori my grandfath wa so enrag that he almost fell into
a fit then recov he bethought him of hi cudgel of holli and
would have us it but my father who wa now nineteen year of ag and
veri stout and strong twist it from hi hand and flung it full fifti
yard sai that no man should touch him more were he a hundr time
hi father then he walk awai leav the prior and my grandfath
stare at each other
now to shorten a long tale the end of the matter wa thi it wa
believ both by my grandfath and the prior that the true caus of my
father contumaci wa a passion which he had conceiv for a girl of
humbl birth a miller fair daughter who dwelt at waingford mill
perhap there wa truth in thi belief or perhap there wa none what
doe it matter see that the maid marri a butcher at beccl and
di year sinc at the good ag of nineti and five but true or fals
my grandfath believ the tale and know well that absenc is the
surest cure for love he enter into a plan with the prior that my
father should be sent to a monasteri at sevil in spain of which
the prior brother wa abbot and there learn to forget the miller
daughter and all other worldli thing
when thi wa told to my father he fell into it readili enough be
a young man of spirit and have a great desir to see the world
otherwis howev than through the grate of a monasteri window so
the end of it wa that he went to foreign part in the care of a parti
of spanish monk who had journei here to norfolk on a pilgrimag to
the shrine of our ladi of walsingham
it is said that my grandfath wept when he part with hi son feel
that he should see him no more yet so strong wa hi religion or
rather hi superstit that he did not hesit to send him awai
though for no reason save that he would mortifi hi own love and flesh
offer hi son for a sacrific as abraham would have offer isaac
but though my father appear to consent to the sacrific as did isaac
yet hi mind wa not altogeth set on altar and faggot in short as
he himself told me in after year hi plan were alreadi laid
thu it chanc that when he had sail from yarmouth a year and six
month there came a letter from the abbot of the monasteri in sevil
to hi brother the prior of st mari at bungai sai that my father
had fled from the monasteri leav no trace of where he had gone my
grandfath wa griev at thi tide but said littl about it
two more year pass awai and there came other new name that my
father had been captur that he had been hand over to the power
of the holi offic as the accurs inquisit wa then name and
tortur to death at sevil when my grandfath heard thi he wept
and bemoan himself that hi folli in forc on into the church who
had no like for that path had brought about the shame end of hi
onli son after that date also he broke hi friendship with the prior of
st mari at bungai and ceas hi offer to the priori still he
did not believ that my father wa dead in truth sinc on the last dai
of hi own life that end two year later he spoke of him as a live
man and left messag to him as to the manag of the land which
now were hi
and in the end it becam clear that thi belief wa not illfound for
on dai three year after the old man death there land at the port
of yarmouth none other than my father who had been absent some eight
year in all nor did he come alon for with him he brought a wife
a young and veri love ladi who afterward wa my mother she wa a
spaniard of nobl famili have been born at sevil and her maiden
name wa donna luisa de garcia
now of all that befel my father dure hi eight year of wander i
cannot speak certainli for he wa veri silent on the matter though i
mai have need to touch on some of hi adventur but i know it is true
that he fell under the power of the holi offic for onc when as a
littl lad i bath with him in the elbow pool where the river wavenei
bend some three hundr yard abov thi hous i saw that hi breast
and arm were score with long white scar and ask him what had
caus them i rememb well how hi face chang as i spoke from
kindli to the hue of blackest hate and how he answer speak to
himself rather than to me
devil he said devil set on their work by the chief of all devil
that live upon the earth and shall reign in hell hark you my son
thoma there is a countri call spain where your mother wa born and
there these devil abid who tortur men and women ay and burn them
live in the name of christ i wa betrai into their hand by him
whom i name the chief of the devil though he is younger than i am by
three year and their pincer and hot iron left these mark upon me
ay and thei would have burnt me aliv also onli i escap thank to
your motherbut such tale ar not for a littl lad hear and see
you never speak of them thoma for the holi offic ha a long arm you
ar half a spaniard thoma your skin and ey tell their own tale but
whatev skin and ey mai tell let your heart give them the lie keep
your heart english thoma let no foreign devil enter there hate
all spaniard except your mother and be watch lest her blood should
master mine within you
i wa a child then and scarc understood hi word or what he meant
by them afterward i learn to understand them but too well as for my
father counsel that i should conquer my spanish blood would that i
could alwai have follow it for i know that from thi blood spring
the most of such evil as is in me henc come my fixed of purpos or
rather obstinaci and my power of unchristian hatr that ar not small
toward those who have wrong me well i have done what i might to
overcom these and other fault but strive as we mai that which is
bred in the bone will out in the flesh as i have seen in mani signal
instanc
there were three of us children geoffrei my elder brother myself and
my sister mari who wa on year my junior the sweetest child and the
most beauti that i have ever known we were veri happi children and
our beauti wa the pride of our father and mother and the envi of other
parent i wa the darkest of the three dark inde to swarthi but
in mari the spanish blood show onli in her rich ey of velvet hue
and in the glow upon her cheek that wa like the blush on a ripe
fruit my mother us to call me her littl spaniard becaus of my
swarthi that is when my father wa not near for such name anger
him she never learn to speak english veri well but he would suffer
her to talk in no other tongu befor him still when he wa not there
she spoke in spanish of which languag howev i alon of the famili
becam a masterand that more becaus of certain volum of old spanish
romanc which she had by her than for ani other reason from my
earliest childhood i wa fond of such tale and it wa by bribe me
with the promis that i should read them that she persuad me to learn
spanish for my mother heart still yearn toward her old sunni home
and often she would talk of it with us children more especi in the
winter season which she hate as i do onc i ask her if she wish
to go back to spain she shiver and answer no for there dwelt
on who wa her enemi and would kill her also her heart wa with us
children and our father i wonder if thi man who sought to kill my
mother wa the same as he of whom my father had spoken as the chief of
the devil but i onli answer that no man could wish to kill on so
good and beauti
ah my boi she said it is just becaus i am or rather have been
beauti that he hate me other would have wed me besid your
dear father thoma and her face grew troubl as though with fear
now when i wa eighteen and a half year old on a certain even
in the month of mai it happen that a friend of my father squir
bozard late of the hall in thi parish call at the lodg on hi road
from yarmouth and in the cours of hi talk let it fall that a spanish
ship wa at anchor in the road laden with merchandis my father

chapter iii
the come of the spaniard
and now i must go back and speak of my own matter as i have told it
wa my father wish that i should be a physician and sinc i came
back from my school at norwich that wa when i had enter on my
sixteenth year i had studi medicin under the doctor who practis
hi art in the neighbourhood of bungai he wa a veri learn man and an
honest grimston by name and as i had some like for the busi i
made good progress under him inde i had learn almost all that he
could teach me and my father purpos to send me to london there to
push on my studi so soon as i should attain my twentieth year that
is within some five month of the date of the come of the spaniard
but it wa not fate that i should go to london
medicin wa not the onli thing that i studi in those dai howev
squir bozard of ditchingham the same who told my father of the come
of the spanish ship had two live children a son and a daughter
though hi wife had born him mani more who di in infanc the
daughter wa name lili and of my own ag have been born three week
after me in the same year now the bozard ar gone from these part
for my greatniec the granddaught and sole heiress of thi son ha
marri and ha issu of anoth name but thi is by the wai
from our earliest dai we children bozard and wingfield live almost
as brother and sister for dai by dai we met and plai togeth in
the snow or in the flower thu it would be hard for me to sai when i
began to love lili or when she began to love me but i know that when
first i went to school at norwich i griev more at lose sight of her
than becaus i must part from my mother and the rest in all our game
she wa ever my partner and i would search the countri round for dai
to find such flower as she chanc to love when i came back from
school it wa the same though by degre lili grew shyer and i also
grew suddenli shy perceiv that from a child she had becom a woman
still we met often and though neither said anyth of it it wa sweet
to us to meet
thu thing went on till thi dai of my mother death but befor i
go further i must tell that squir bozard look with no favour on the
friendship between hi daughter and myselfand thi not becaus he
dislik me but rather becaus he would have seen lili wed to my
elder brother geoffrei my father heir and not to a younger son so
hard did he grow about the matter at last that we two might scarc
meet except by seem accid wherea my brother wa ever welcom
at the hall and on thi account some bitter aros between us two
brother as is apt to be the case when a woman come between friend
howev close for it must be known that my brother geoffrei also love
lili as all men would have love her and with a better right perhap
than i hadfor he wa my elder by three year and born to possess
it mai seem inde that i wa somewhat hasti to fall into thi state
see that at the time of which i write i wa not yet of ag but young
blood is nimbl and moreov mine wa half spanish and made a man of
me when mani a purebr englishman is still noth but a boi for the
blood and the sun that ripen it have much to do with such matter as
i have seen often enough among the indian peopl of anahuac who at the
ag of fifteen will take to themselv a bride of twelv at the least
it is certain that when i wa eighteen year of ag i wa old enough
to fall in love after such fashion that i never fell out of it again
altogeth although the histori of my life mai seem to give me the lie
when i sai so but i take it that a man mai love sever women and yet
love on of them the best of all be true in the spirit to the law
which he break in the letter
now when i had attain nineteen year i wa a man full grown and
write as i do in extrem old ag i mai sai it without fals shame a
veri handsom youth to boot i wa not over tall inde measur but
five feet nine inch and a half in height but my limb were well made
and i wa both deep and broad in the chest in colour i wa and my
white hair notwithstand am still extraordinarili dark hu my ey
also were larg and dark and my hair which wa wavi wa coal black
in my deport i wa reserv and grave to sad in speech i wa
slow and temper and more apt at listen than in talk i weigh
matter well befor i made up my mind upon them but be made up
noth could turn me from that mind short of death itself whether it
were set on good or evil on folli or wisdom in those dai also i had
littl religion sinc partli becaus of my father secret teach
and partli through the work of my own reason i had learn to doubt
the doctrin of the church as thei us to be set out youth is prone
to reason by larg leap as it were and to hold that all thing ar
fals becaus some ar prove fals and thu at time in those dai i
thought that there wa no god becaus the priest said that the imag of
the virgin at bungai wept and did other thing which i knew that it did
not do now i know well that there is a god for my own stori prove it
to my heart in truth what man can look back across a long life and sai
that there is no god when he can see the shadow of hi hand ly deep
upon hi tale of year
on thi sad dai of which i write i knew that lili whom i love
would be walk alon beneath the great pollard oak in the park of
ditchingham hall here in grubswel as the spot is call grew and
inde still grow certain hawthorn tree that ar the earliest to blow
of ani in these part and when we had met at the church door on the
sundai lili said that there would be bloom upon them by the wednesdai
and on that afternoon she should go to cut it it mai well be that she
spoke thu with design for love will breed cun in the heart of the
most guileless and truth maid moreov i notic that though she
said it befor her father and the rest of us yet she wait to speak
till my brother geoffrei wa out of hear for she did not wish to
go mai with him and also that as she spoke she shot a glanc of her
grei ey at me then and there i vow to myself that i also would
be gather hawthorn bloom in thi same place and on that wednesdai
afternoon ye even if i must plai truant and leav all the sick of
bungai to natur nurs moreov i wa determin on on thing
that if i could find lili alon i would delai no longer but tell her
all that wa in my heart no great secret inde for though no word
of love had ever pass between us as yet each knew the other hidden
thought not that i wa in the wai to becom affianc to a maid who
had my path to cut in the world but i fear that if i delai to make
sure of her affect my brother would be befor me with her father
and lili might yield to that to which she would not yield if onc we had
plight troth
now it chanc that on thi afternoon i wa hard put to it to escap to
my tryst for my master the physician wa ail and sent me to visit
the sick for him carri them their medicin at the last howev
between four and five oclock i fled ask no leav take the
norwich road i ran for a mile and more till i had pass the manor hous
and the church turn and drew near to ditchingham park then i drop
my pace to a walk for i did not wish to come befor lili heat and
disord but rather look my best to which end i had put on my
sundai garment now as i went down the littl hill in the road that
run past the park i saw a man on horseback who look first at the
bridlepath that at thi spot turn off to the right then back across
the common land toward the vineyard hill and the wavenei and then
along the road as though he did not know which wai to turn i wa quick
to notic thingsthough at thi moment my mind wa not at it swiftest
be set on other matter and chiefli as to how i should tell my tale
to lilyand i saw at onc that thi man wa not of our countri
he wa veri tall and noblelook dress in rich garment of velvet
adorn by a gold chain that hung about hi neck and as i judg about
forti year of ag but it wa hi face which chiefli caught my ey for
at that moment there wa someth terribl about it it wa long
thin and deepli carv the ey were larg and gleam like gold in
sunlight the mouth wa small and well shape but it wore a devilish
and cruel sneer the forehead lofti indic a man of mind and
mark with a slight scar for the rest the cavali wa dark and
southernlook hi curl hair like my own wa black and he wore
a peak chestnutcolour beard
by the time that i had finish these observ my feet had brought
me almost to the stranger side and for the first time he caught sight
of me instantli hi face chang the sneer left it and it becam
kindli and pleasant look lift hi bonnet with much courtesi he
stammer someth in broken english of which all that i could catch
wa the word yarmouth then perceiv that i did not understand him he
curs the english tongu and all those who spoke it aloud and in good
castilian
if the senor will gracious express hi wish in spanish i said
speak in that languag it mai be in my power to help him
what you speak spanish young sir he said start and yet you
ar not a spaniard though by your face you well might be caramba but
it is strang and he ei me curious
it mai be strang sir i answer but i am in hast be pleas to
ask your question and let me go
ah he said perhap i can guess the reason of your hurri i saw
a white robe down by the streamlet yonder and he nod toward the
park take the advic of an older man young sir and be care make
what sport you will with such but never believ them and never marri
themlest you should live to desir to kill them
here i made as though i would pass on but he spoke again
pardon my word thei were well meant and perhap you mai come to
learn their truth i will detain you no more will you gracious direct
me on my road to yarmouth for i am not sure of it have ridden by
anoth wai and your english countri is so full of tree that a man
cannot see a mile
i walk a dozen pace down the bridlepath that join the road at
thi place and point out the wai that he should go past ditchingham
church as i did so i notic that while i spoke the stranger wa
watch my face keenli and as it seem to me with an inward fear
which he strove to master and could not when i had finish again he
rais hi bonnet and thank me sai
will you be so graciou as to tell me your name young sir
what is my name to you i answer roughli for i dislik thi man
you have not told me your
no inde i am travel incognito perhap i also have met a ladi
in these part and he smile strang i onli wish to know the
name of on who had done me a courtesi but who it seem is not so
courteou as i deem and he shook hi hors rein
i am not asham of my name i said it ha been an honest on so
far and if you wish to know it it is thoma wingfield
i thought it he cri and as he spoke hi face grew like the face
of a fiend then befor i could find time even to wonder he had sprung
from hi hors and stood within three pace of me
a lucki dai now we will see what truth there is in propheci he
said draw hi silvermount sword a name for a name juan de
garcia give you greet thoma wingfield
now strang as it mai seem it wa at thi moment onli that there
flash across my mind the thought of all that i had heard about the
spanish stranger the report of whose come to yarmouth had stir my
father and mother so deepli at ani other time i should have rememb
it soon enough but on thi dai i wa so set upon my tryst with lili
and what i should sai to her that noth els could hold a place in my
thought
thi must be the man i said to myself and then i said no more
for he wa on me sword up i saw the keen point flash toward me and
sprang to on side have a desir to fly as be unarm except for
my stick i might have done without shame but spring as i would i could
not avoid the thrust altogeth it wa aim at my heart and it pierc
the sleev of my left arm pass through the fleshno more yet at
the pain of that cut all thought of flight left me and instead of it
a cold anger fill me caus me to wish to kill thi man who had
attack me thu and unprovok in my hand wa my stout oaken staff
which i had cut myself on the bank of hollow hill and if i would
fight i must make such plai with thi as i might it seem a poor weapon
inde to match against a toledo blade in the hand of on who could
handl it well and yet there ar virtu in a cudgel for when a man
see himself threaten with it he is like to forget that he hold
in hi hand a more deadli weapon and to take to the guard of hi own
head in place of run hi adversari through the bodi
and that wa what chanc in thi case though how it came about exactli
i cannot tell the spaniard wa a fine swordsman and had i been arm
as he wa would doubtless have overmatch me who at that ag had no
practic in the art which wa almost unknown in england but when he
saw the big stick flourish over him he forgot hi own advantag and
rais hi arm to ward awai the blow down it came upon the back of hi
hand and lo hi sword fell from it to the grass but i did not spare
him becaus of that for my blood wa up the next stroke took him on
the lip knock out a tooth and send him backward then i caught
him by the leg and beat him most unmercifulli not upon the head inde
for now that i wa victor i did not wish to kill on whom i thought a
madman as i would that i had done but on everi other part of him
inde i thrash him till my arm were weari and then i fell to kick
him and all the while he writh like a wound snake and curs
horribl though he never cri out or ask for merci at last i ceas
and look at him and he wa no pretti sight to seeinde what with
hi cut and bruis and the mire of the roadwai it would have been
hard to know him for the gallant cavali whom i had met not five
minut befor but uglier than all hi hurt wa the look in hi wick
ey as he lai there on hi back in the pathwai and glare up at me
now friend spaniard i said you have learn a lesson and what is
there to hinder me from treat you as you would have dealt with me
who had never harm you and i took up hi sword and held it to hi
throat
strike home you accurs whelp he answer in a broken voic it is
better to die than to live to rememb such shame as thi
no i said i am no foreign murder to kill a defenceless man you
shall awai to the justic to answer for yourself the hangman ha a rope
for such as you
then you must drag me thither he groan and shut hi ey as though
with faint and doubtless he wa somewhat faint
now as i ponder on what should be done with the villain it chanc
that i look up through a gap in the fenc and there among the
grubswel oak three hundr yard or more awai i caught sight of the
flutter of a white robe that i knew well and it seem to me that the
wearer of that robe wa move toward the bridg of the water as
though she were weari of wait for on who did not come
then i thought to myself that if i stai to drag thi man to the
villag stock or some other safe place there would be an end of
meet with my love that dai and i did not know when i might find
anoth chanc now i would not have miss that hour talk with lili
to bring a score of murderousmind foreign to their desert and
moreov thi on had earn good payment for hi behaviour sure
thought i he might wait a while till i had done my lovemak and
if he would not wait i could find a mean to make him do so not twenti
pace from us the hors stood crop the grass i went to him and
undid hi bridl rein and with it fasten the spaniard to a small
waysid tree as best i wa abl
now here you stai i said till i am readi to fetch you and i
turn to go
but as i went a great doubt took me and onc more i rememb my
mother fear and how my father had ridden in hast to yarmouth
on busi about a spaniard now todai a spaniard had wander to
ditchingham and when he learn my name had fallen upon me madli try
to kill me wa not thi the man whom my mother fear and wa it right
that i should leav him thu that i might go mai with my dear i knew
in my breast that it wa not right but i wa so set upon my desir and
so strongli did my heartstr pull me toward her whose white robe
now flutter on the slope of the park hill that i never heed the
warn
well had it been for me if i had done so and well for some who were yet
unborn then thei had never known death nor i the land of exil the
tast of slaveri and the altar of sacrific
chapter iv
thoma tell hi love
have made the spaniard as fast as i could hi arm be bound to the
tree behind him and take hi sword with me i began to run hard after
lili and caught her not too soon for in on more minut she would have
turn along the road that run to the water and over the bridg by
the park hill path to the hall
hear my footstep she face about to greet me or rather as though
to see who it wa that follow her there she stood in the even
light a bough of hawthorn bloom in her hand and my heart beat yet
more wildli at the sight of her never had she seem fairer than as she
stood thu in her white robe a look of amaz upon her face and in
her grei ey that wa half real half feign and with the sunlight
shift on her auburn hair that show beneath her littl bonnet lili
wa no roundcheck countri maid with few beauti save those of health
and youth but a tall and shape ladi who had ripen earli to her full
grace and sweet and so it came about that though we were almost of
an ag yet in her presenc i felt alwai as though i were the younger
thu in my love for her wa mingl some touch of rever
oh it is you thoma she said blush as she spoke i thought you
were noti mean that i am go home as it grow late but sai why do
you run so fast and what ha happen to you thoma that your arm is
bloodi and you carri a sword in your hand
i have no breath to speak yet i answer come back to the hawthorn
and i will tell you
no i must be wend homeward i have been among the tree for more
than an hour and there is littl bloom upon them
i could not come befor lili i wa kept and in a strang manner
also i saw bloom as i ran
inde i never thought that you would come thoma she answer
look down who have other thing to do than to go out mai like a
girl but i wish to hear your stori if it is short and i will walk a
littl wai with you
so we turn and walk side by side toward the great pollard oak
and by the time that we reach them i had told her the tale of the
spaniard and how he strove to kill me and how i had beaten him with my
staff now lili listen eagerli enough and sigh with fear when she
learn how close i had been to death
but you ar wound thoma she broke in see the blood run fast
from your arm is the thrust deep
i have not look to see i have had no time to look
take off your coat thoma that i mai dress the wound nai i will
have it so
so i drew off the garment not without pain and roll up the shirt
beneath and there wa the hurt a clean thrust through the fleshi part
of the lower arm lili wash it with water from the brook and bound it
with her kerchief murmur word of piti all the while to sai truth
i would have suffer a wors harm gladli if onli i could find her to
tend it inde her gentl care broke down the fenc of my doubt and
gave me a courag that otherwis might have fail me in her presenc
at first inde i could find no word but as she bound my wound
i bent down and kiss her minist hand she flush red as the
even sky the flood of crimson lose itself at last beneath her
auburn hair but it burn deepest upon the white hand which i had
kiss
why did you do that thoma she said in a low voic
then i spoke i did it becaus i love you lili and do not know how to
begin the tell of my love i love you dear and have alwai love as
i alwai shall love you
ar you so sure of that thoma she said again
there is noth els in the world of which i am so sure lili what i
wish to be as sure of is that you love me as i love you
for a moment she stood quiet her head sunk almost to her breast then
she lift it and her ey shone as i had never seen them shine befor
can you doubt it thoma she said
and now i took her in my arm and kiss her on the lip and the memori
of that kiss ha gone with me through my long life and is with me yet
when old and wither i stand upon the border of the grave it wa
the greatest joi that ha been given to me in all my dai too soon
ala it wa done that first pure kiss of youth loveand i spoke
again somewhat aimlessli
it seem then that you do love me who love you so well
if you doubt it befor can you doubt it now she answer veri
softli but listen thoma it is well that we should love each other
for we were born to it and have no help in the matter even if we
wish to find it still though love be sweet and holi it is not all
for there is duti to be thought of and what will my father sai to thi
thoma
i do not know lili and yet i can guess i am sure sweet that he
wish you to take my brother geoffrei and leav me on on side
then hi wish ar not mine thoma also though duti be strong it
is not strong enough to forc a woman to a marriag for which she ha no
like yet it mai prove strong enough to keep a woman from a marriag
for which her heart pleadsperhap also it should have been strong
enough to hold me back from the tell of my love
no lili the love itself is much and though it should bring no fruit
still it is someth to have won it for ever and a dai
you ar veri young to talk thu thoma i am also young i know but
we women ripen quicker perhap all thi is but a boi fanci to pass
with boyhood
it will never pass lili thei sai that our first love ar the
longest and that which is sown in youth will flourish in our ag
listen lili i have my place to make in the world and it mai take a
time in the make and i ask on promis of you though perhap it is a
selfish thing to seek i ask of you that you will be faith to me and
come fair weather or foul will wed no other man till you know me dead
it is someth to promis thoma for with time come chang still i
am so sure of myself that i promisenai i swear it of you i cannot
be sure but thing ar so with us women that we must risk all upon a
throw and if we lose goodby to happi
then we talk on and i cannot rememb what we said though these
word that i have written down remain in my mind partli becaus of
their own weight and in part becaus of all that came about in the
after year
and at last i knew that i must go though we were sad enough at part
so i took her in my arm and kiss her so close that some blood from
my wound ran down her white attir but as we embrac i chanc to look
up and saw a sight that frighten me enough for there not five pace
from us stood squir bozard lili father watch all and hi face
wore no smile
he had been ride by a bridlepath to the water ford and see a
coupl trespass beneath the oak dismount from hi hors to hunt
them awai not till he wa quit near did he know whom he came to hunt
and then he stood still in astonish lili and i drew slowli apart
and look at him he wa a short stout man with a red face and stern
grei ey that seem to be start from hi head with anger for a
while he could not speak but when he began at length the word came
fast enough all that he said i forget but the upshot of it wa that he
desir to know what my busi wa with hi daughter i wait till
he wa out of breath then answer him that lili and i love each other
well and were plight our troth
is thi so daughter he ask
it is so my father she answer boldli
then he broke out swear you light minx he said you shall be
whip and kept cool on bread and water in your chamber and for you
my halfbr spanish cockerel know onc and for all that thi maid
is for your better how dare you come woo my daughter you empti
pillbox who have not two silver penni to rattl in your pouch go
win fortun and a name befor you dare to look up to such as she
that is my desir and i will do it sir i answer
so you apothecari drudg you will win name and place will you
well long befor that deed is done the maid shall be safe wed to
on who ha them and who is not unknown to you daughter sai now that
you have finish with him
i cannot sai that father she repli pluck at her robe if it
is not your will that i should marri thoma here my duti is plain and
i mai not wed him but i am my own and no duti can make me marri where i
will not while thoma live i am sworn to him and to no other man
at the least you have courag hussei said her father but listen
now either you will marri where and when i wish or tramp it for your
bread ungrat girl did i breed you to flaunt me to my face now for
you pillbox i will teach you to come kiss honest men daughter
without their leav and with a curs he rush at me stick aloft to
thrash me
then for the second time that dai my quick blood boil in me and
snatch up the spaniard sword that lai upon the grass besid me
i held it at the point for the game wa chang and i who had fought
with cudgel against sword must now fight with sword against cudgel and
had it not been that lili with a quick cry of fear struck my arm from
beneath caus the point of the sword to pass over hi shoulder
i believ truli that i should then and there have pierc her father
through and end my dai earli with a noos about my neck
ar you mad she cri and do you think to win me by slai my
father throw down that sword thoma
as for win you it seem that there is small chanc of it i
answer hotli but i tell you thi not for the sake of all the maid
upon the earth will i stand to be beaten with a stick like a scullion
and there i do not blame you lad said her father more kindli i
see that you also have courag which mai serv you in good stead and it
wa unworthi of me to call you pillbox in my anger still as i have
said the girl is not for you so be gone and forget her as best you

live to call your daughter wife lili farewel till these storm ar
overpast
farewel thoma she said weep forget me not and i will never
forget my oath to you
then take lili by the arm her father led her awai
i also went awaysad but not altogeth illpleas for now i knew
that if i had won the father anger i had also won the daughter
unalter love and love last longer than wrath and here or
hereaft will win it wai at length when i had gone a littl distanc
i rememb the spaniard who had been clean forgotten by me in all
thi love and war and i turn to seek him and drag him to the stock
the which i should have done with joi and been glad to find some on
on whom to wreak my wrong but when i came to the spot where i had left
him i found that fate had befriend him by the hand of a fool for
there wa no spaniard but onli the villag idiot billi minn by name
who stood stare first at the tree to which the foreign had been made
fast and then at a piec of silver in hi hand
where is the man who wa ti here billi i ask
i know not master thoma he answer in hi norfolk talk which i
will not set down halfwai to wheresoev he wa go i should sai

reckon of time that keep it own score like an innkeep without
my help lawk how he did gallop off work those long spur he wore
right into the rib of the hors and littl wonder poor man and he
daft not be abl to speak but onli to bleat sheeplik and fallen
upon by robber on the king road and in broad daylight but billi
cut him loos and caught hi hors and set him on it and got thi piec
for hi good chariti lawk but he wa glad to be gone how he did
gallop
now you ar a bigger fool even than i thought you billi minn i said
in anger that man would have murder me i overcam him and made him
fast and you have let him go
he would have murder you master and you made him fast then why did
you not stop to keep him till i came along and we would have hale him
to the stock that would have been sport and all you call me foolbut
if you found a man cover with blood and hurt ti to a tree and he
daft and not abl to speak had you not cut him loos well he gone
and thi alon is left of him and he spun the piec into the air
now see that there wa reason in billi talk for the fault wa
mine i turn awai without more word not straight homeward for i
wish to think alon awhil on all that had come about between me and
lili and her father but down the wai which run across the lane to the
crest of the vineyard hill these hill ar cloth with underwood
in which larg oak grow to within some two hundr yard of thi hous
where i write and thi underwood is pierc by path that my mother
laid out for she love to walk here on of these path run along the
bottom of the hill by the edg of the pleasant river wavenei and the
other a hundr feet or more abov and near the crest of the slope or
to speak more plainli there is but on path shape like the letter o
place thu symbol of o lai on it side omit the curv end of
the letter mark how the path turn upon the hillsid
now i struck the path at the end that is furthest from thi hous and
follow that half of it which run down by the river bank have the
water on on side of it and the brushwood upon the other along thi
lower path i wander my ey fix upon the ground think deepli
as i went now of the joi of lili love and now of the sorrow of
our part and of her father wrath as i went thu wrap in
medit i saw someth white ly upon the grass and push it
asid with the point of the spaniard sword not heed it still it
shape and fashion remain in my mind and when i had left it some
three hundr pace behind me and wa draw near to the hous the
sight of it came back to me as it lai soft and white upon the grass
and i knew that it wa familiar to my ey from the thing whatev it
might be my mind pass to the spaniard sword with which i had toss
it asid and from the sword to the man himself what had been hi
busi in thi parishan ill on surelyand why had he look as
though he fear me and fallen upon me when he learn my name
i stood still look downward and my ey fell upon footprint
stamp in the wet sand of the path on of them wa my mother i
could have sworn to it among a thousand for no other woman in these
part had so delic a foot close to it as though follow after
wa anoth that at first i thought must also have been made by a woman
it wa so narrow but present i saw that thi could scarc be
becaus of it length and moreov that the boot which left it wa
like none that i knew be cut veri high at the instep and veri
point at the toe then of a sudden it came upon me that the spanish
stranger wore such boot for i had note them while i talk with
him and that hi feet were follow those of my mother for thei had
trodden on her track and in some place hi alon had stamp their
impress on the sand blot out her footprint then too i knew what
the white rag wa that i had thrown asid it wa my mother mantilla
which i knew and yet did not know becaus i alwai saw it set
daintili upon her head in a moment it had come home to me and with
the knowledg a keen and sicken dread why had thi man follow my
mother and why did her mantilla lie thu upon the ground
i turn and sped like a deer back to where i had seen the lace all the
wai the footprint went befor me now i wa there ye the wrap
wa her and it had been rent as though by a rude hand but where wa
she
with a beat heart onc more i bent to read the write of the
footstep here thei were mix on with anoth as though the two had
stood close togeth move now thi wai and now that in struggl i
look up the path but there were none then i cast round about like
a beagl first along the river side then up the bank here thei were
again and made by feet that flew and feet that follow up the bank
thei went fifti yard and more now lost where the turf wa sound now
seen in sand or loam till thei led to the bole of a big oak and were
onc more mix togeth for here the pursuer had come up with the
pursu
despairingli as on who dream for now i guess all and grew mad with
fear i look thi wai and that till at length i found more footstep
those of the spaniard these were deep mark as of a man who carri
some heavi burden i follow them first thei went down the hill
toward the river then turn asid to a spot where the brushwood wa
thick in the deepest of the clump the bough now burst into leaf
were bent downward as though to hide someth beneath i wrench them
asid and there gleam white in the gather twilight wa the
dead face of my mother
chapter v
thoma swear an oath
for a while i stood amaz with horror stare down at the dead face of
my belov mother then i stoop to lift her and saw that she had been
stab and through the breast stab with the sword which i carri
in my hand
now i understood thi wa the work of that spanish stranger whom i
had met as he hurri from the place of murder who becaus of the
wicked of hi heart or for some secret reason had striven to slai
me also when he learn that i wa my mother son and i had held thi
devil in my power and that i might meet my mai i had suffer him to
escap my vengeanc who had i known the truth would have dealt with
him as the priest of anahuac deal with the victim of their god i
understood and shed tear of piti rage and shame then i turn and
fled homeward like on mad
at the doorwai i met my father and my brother geoffrei ride up from
bungai market and there wa that written on my face which caus them
to ask as with on voic
what evil thing ha happen
thrice i look at my father befor i could speak for i fear lest the
blow should kill him but speak i must at last though i chose that it
should be to geoffrei my brother our mother li murder yonder on
the vineyard hill a spanish man ha done the deed juan de garcia by
name when my father heard these word hi face becam livid as though
with pain of the heart hi jaw fell and a low moan issu from hi open
mouth present he rest hi hand upon the pommel of the saddl and
lift hi ghastli face he said
where is thi spaniard have you kill him
no father he chanc upon me in grubswel and when he learn my
name he would have murder me but i plai quarter staff with him and
beat him to a pulp take hi sword
ay and then
and then i let him go know noth of the deed he had alreadi
wrought upon our mother afterward i will tell you all
you let him go son you let juan de garcia go then thoma mai the
curs of god rest upon you till you find him and finish that which you
began todai
spare to curs me father who am accurs by my own conscienc turn
your hors rather and ride for yarmouth for there hi ship li and
thither he ha gone with two hour start perhap you mai still trap
him befor he set sail
without anoth word my father and brother wheel their hors round
and depart at full gallop into the gloom of the gather night
thei rode so fierc that their hors be good thei came to the
gate of yarmouth in littl more than an hour and a half and that is
fast ride but the bird wa flown thei track him to the quai and
found that he had ship a while befor in a boat which wa in wait
for him and pass to hi vessel that lai in the road at anchor but
with the most of her canva set instantli she sail and now wa lost
in the night then my father caus notic to be given that he would pai
reward of two hundr piec in gold to ani ship that should captur the
spaniard and two start on the quest but thei did not find her that
befor morn wa far on her wai across the sea
so soon as thei had gallop awai i call togeth the groom and other
serv men and told them what had chanc then we went with lantern
for by now it wa dark and came to the thick brushwood where lai the
bodi of my mother i drew near the first for the men were afraid and
so inde wa i though why i should fear her ly dead who live had
love me tenderli i do not know yet i know thi that when i came to
the spot and saw two ey glower at me and heard the crash of bush
as someth broke them i could almost have fallen with fear although
i knew well that it wa but a fox or wander hound haunt the place
of death
still i went on call the other to follow and the end of it wa
that we laid my mother bodi upon a door which had been lift from
it hing and bore her home for the last time and to me that path is
still a haunt place it is seventi year and more sinc my mother di
by the hand of juan de garcia her cousin yet old as i am and harden
to such sad scene i do not love to walk that path alon at night
doubtless it wa fanci which plai us strang trick still but a year
ago have gone to set a spring for a woodcock i chanc to pass by
yonder big oak upon a novemb ev and i could have sworn that i saw
it all again i saw myself a lad my wound arm still bound with lili
kerchief climb slowli down the hillsid while behind me groan
beneath their burden were the form of the four serv men i heard
the murmur of the river and the wind that seventi year ago whisper
in the reed i saw the cloud sky flaw here and there with blue
and the broken light that gleam on the white burden stretch upon the
door and the red stain at it breast ay i heard myself talk as i
went forward with the lantern bid the men pass to the right of some
steep and rotten ground and it wa strang to me to listen to my own
voic as it had been in youth well well it wa but a dream yet such
slave ar we to the fear of fanci that becaus of the dead i who am
almost of their number do not love to pass that path at night
at length we came home with our burden and the women took it weep
and set about their task with it and now i must not onli fight my own
sorrow but must strive to sooth those of my sister mari who as i
fear would go mad with grief and horror at last she sob herself
into a torpor and i went and question the men who sat round the
fire in the kitchen for none sought their bed that night from them i
learn that an hour or more befor i met the spaniard a richlydress
stranger had been seen walk along the churchpath and that he had
ti hi hors among some gors and brambl on the top of the hill
where he stood as though in doubt till my mother came out when he
descend and follow her also i learn that on of the men at work
in the garden which is not more than three hundr pace from where
the deed wa done heard cri but had taken no note of them think
forsooth that it wa but the plai of some lover from bungai and hi
lass chase each other through the wood as to thi hour it is their
fashion to do truli it seem to me that dai as though thi parish of
ditchingham were the veri nurseri of fool of whom i wa the first and
biggest and inde thi same thought ha struck me sinc concern
other matter
at length the morn came and with it my father and brother who
return from yarmouth on hire hors for their own were spent in the
afternoon also new follow them that the ship which had put to sea
on the track of the spaniard had been driven back by bad weather have
seen noth of him
now i told all the stori of my deal with the murder of my mother
keep noth back and i must bear my father bitter anger becaus
know that my mother wa in dread of a spaniard i had suffer my
reason to be led astrai by my desir to win speech with my love nor did
i meet with ani comfort from my brother geoffrei who wa fierc against
me becaus he learn that i had not plead in vain with the maid whom
he desir for himself but he said noth of thi reason also that no
drop might be lack in my cup squir bozard who came with mani other
neighbour to view the corps and offer sympathi with my father in hi
loss told him at the same time that he took it ill that i should woo
hi daughter against hi wish and that if i continu in thi cours it
would strain their ancient friendship thu i wa hit on everi side by
sorrow for my mother whom i had love tenderli by long for my dear
whom i might not see by selfreproach becaus i had let the spaniard
go when i held him fast and by the anger of my father and my brother
inde those dai were so dark and bitter for i wa at the ag when
shame and sorrow sting their sharpest that i wish that i were dead
besid my mother on comfort reach me inde a messag from lili
sent by a servant girl whom she trust give me her dear love and
bid me to be of good cheer
at length came the dai of burial and my mother wrap in fair white
robe wa laid to her rest in the chancel of the church at ditchingham
where my father ha long been set besid her hard by the brass effigi
that mark the buri place of lili forefath hi wife and mani
of their children thi funer wa the saddest of sight for the
bitter of my father grief broke from him in sob and my sister
mari swoon awai in my arm inde there were few dry ey in all that
church for my mother notwithstand her foreign birth wa much love
becaus of her gentl wai and the good of her heart but it came to
an end and the nobl spanish ladi and english wife wa left to her long
sleep in the ancient church where she shall rest on when her tragic
stori and her veri name ar forgotten among men inde thi is like
to be soon for i am the last of the wingfield aliv in these part
though my sister mari ha left descend of anoth name to whom my
land and fortun go except for certain gift to the poor of bungai and
of ditchingham
when it wa over i went back home my father wa sit in the front
room well nigh besid himself with grief and by him wa my brother
present he began to assail me with bitter word becaus i had let the
murder go when god gave him into my hand
you forget father sneer geoffrei thoma woo a maid and it wa
more to him to hold her in hi arm than to keep hi mother murder
safe but by thi it seem he ha kill two bird with on stone he
ha suffer the spanish devil to escap when he knew that our mother
fear the come of a spaniard and he ha made enmiti between us and
squir bozard our good neighbour who strang enough doe not favour
hi woo
it is so said my father thoma your mother blood is on your
hand
i listen and could bear thi goad injustic no longer
it is fals i said i sai it even to my father the man had kill
my mother befor i met him ride back to seek hi ship at yarmouth
and have lost hi wai how then is her blood upon my hand as for my
woo of lili bozard that is my matter brother and not your though
perhap you wish that it wa your and not mine why father did you
not tell me what you fear of thi spaniard i heard some loos talk
onli and gave littl thought to it my mind be full of other thing
and now i will sai someth you call down god curs upon me
father till such time as i should find thi murder and finish what i
had begun so be it let god curs rest upon me till i do find him i
am young but i am quick and strong and so soon as mai be i start for
spain to hunt him there till i shall run him down or know him to be
dead if you will give me monei to help me on my quest so be itif not
i go without i swear befor god and by my mother spirit that i will
neither rest nor stai till with the veri sword that slew her i have
aveng her blood upon her murder or know him dead and if i suffer
myself to be led astrai from the purpos of thi oath by aught that is
then mai a wors end than her overtak me mai my soul be reject in
heaven and my name be shame for ever upon the earth
thu i swore in my rage and anguish hold up my hand to heaven that i
call upon to wit the oath
my father look at me keenli if that is your mind son thoma you
shall not lack for monei i would go myself for blood must be wipe out
with blood but i am too broken in my health also i am known in spain
and the holi offic would claim me there go and my bless go with
you it is right that you should go for it is through your folli that
our enemi ha escap us

you sai that becaus you wish to be rid of me geoffrei i answer
hotli and you would be rid of me becaus you desir to take my place
at the side of a certain maid follow your natur and do as you will
but if you would outwit an absent man no good shall come to you of it
the girl is to him who can win her he said
the girl heart is won alreadi geoffrei you mai bui her from her
father but you can never win her heart and without a heart she will be
but a poor prize
peac now is no time for such talk of love and maid said my father
and listen thi is the tale of the spanish murder and your mother
i have said noth of it heretofor but now it must out when i wa a
lad it happen that i also went to spain becaus my father will it i
went to a monasteri at sevil but i had no like for monk and their
wai and i broke out from the monasteri for a year or more i made my
live as i best might for i fear to return to england as a runawai
still i made a live and not a bad on now in thi wai and now in
that but though i am asham to sai it mostli by game at which i
had great luck on night i met thi man juan de garciafor in hi hate
he gave you hi true name when he would have stab youat plai even
then he had an evil fame though he wa scarc more than a lad but he
wa handsom in person set high in birth and of a pleas manner it
chanc that he won of me at the dice and be in a good humour he
took me to visit at the hous of hi aunt hi uncl widow a ladi of
sevil thi aunt had on child a daughter and that daughter wa your
mother now your mother luisa de garcia wa affianc to her cousin
juan de garcia not with her own will inde for the contract had been
sign when she wa onli eight year old still it wa bind more
bind inde than in thi countri be a marriag in all except
in fact but those women who ar thu bound for the most part bear no
wife love in their heart and so it wa with your mother inde she
both hate and fear her cousin juan though i think that he love
her more than anyth on earth and by on pretext and anoth she
contriv to bring him to an agreement that no marriag should be
celebr till she wa full twenti year of ag but the colder she
wa to him the more wa he inflam with desir to win her and also
her possess which were not small for like all spaniard he wa
passion and like most gamest and men of evil life much in want
of monei
now to be brief from the first moment that your mother and i set ey
on each other we love on anoth and it wa our on desir to meet
as often as might be and in thi we had no great difficulti for her
mother also fear and hate juan de garcia her nephew by marriag and
would have seen her daughter clear of him if possibl the end of it wa
that i told my love and a plot wa made between us that we should fly
to england but all thi had not escap the ear of juan who had spi
in the household and wa jealou and reveng as onli a spaniard can
be first he tri to be rid of me by challeng me to a duel but we
were part befor we could draw sword then he hire bravo to murder

doublet and their dagger broke upon it and in place of be slain i
slew on of them twice baffl de garcia wa not defeat fight and
murder had fail but anoth and surer mean remain i know not how
but he had won some clue to the histori of my life and of how i
had broken out from the monasteri it wa left to him therefor to
denounc me to the holi offic as a renegad and an infidel and thi he
did on night it wa the night befor the dai when we should have taken
ship i wa sit with your mother and her mother in their hous at
sevil when six cowl men enter and seiz me without a word when
i prai to know their purpos thei gave no other answer than to hold
a crucifix befor my ey then i knew why i wa taken and the women

she shook her head sadli it were too much happi thoma men and
women mai seldom wed their true love or if thei do it is but to lose
them at the least we love and let us be thank that we have learn
what love can be for have love here perchanc at the worst we mai
love otherwher when there ar none to sai us nai
then we talk on awhil babbl broken word of love and hope and
sorrow as young folk so place ar wont to do till at length lili
look up with a sad sweet smile and said
it is time to go sweetheart my father beckon me from the lattic
all is finish
let us go then i answer huskili and drew her behind the trunk of
the old beech and there i caught her in my arm and kiss her again
and yet again nor wa she asham to kiss me back
after thi i rememb littl of what happen except that as we rode
awai i saw her belov face wan and wist watch me depart out
of her life for twenti year that sad and beauti face haunt me
and it haunt me yet athwart life and death other women have love me
and i have known other part some of them more terribl but the
memori of thi woman as she wa then and of her farewel look overrun
them all whenev i gaze down the past i see thi pictur frame in it
and i know that it is on which cannot fade ar there ani sorrow like
these sorrow of our youth can ani bitter equal the bitter of
such goodby i know but on of which i wa fate to tast in after
year and that shall be told of in it place it is a common jest to
mock at earli love but if it be real if it be someth more than the
mere aris of the passion earli love is late love also it is love
for ever the best and worst event which can befal a man or woman i
sai it who am old and who have done with everyth and it is true
on thing i have forgotten as we kiss and clung in our despair
behind the bole of the great beech lili drew a ring from her finger
and press it into my hand sai look on thi each morn when you
wake and think of me it had been her mother and todai it still
is set upon my wither hand gleam in the winter sunlight as i trace
these word through the long year of wild adventur through all the
time of after peac in love and war in the shine of the camp fire
in the glare of the sacrifici flame in the light of lone star
illumin the lone wilder that ring ha shone upon my hand
remind me alwai of her who gave it and on thi hand it shall go
down into the grave it is a plain circlet of thick gold somewhat worn
now a posyr and on it inner surfac is cut thi quaint couplet
heart to heart though far apart
a fit motto for us inde and on that ha it mean to thi
hour
that same dai of our farewel i rode with my father to yarmouth my
brother geoffrei did not come with us but we part with kindli word
and of thi i am glad for we never saw each other again no more wa
said between us as to lili bozard and our woo of her though i knew
well enough that so soon as my back wa turn he would try to take my
place at her side as inde happen i forgiv it to him in truth i
cannot blame him much for what man is there that would not have desir
to wed lili who knew her onc we were dear friend geoffrei and i but
when we ripen toward manhood our love of lili came between us and
we grew more and more apart it is a common case enough well as it
chanc he fail so why should i think unkindli of him let me rather
rememb the affect of our childhood and forget the rest god rest
hi soul
mari my sister who after lili bozard wa now the fairest maiden in the
countri side wept much at my go there wa but a year between us
and we love each other dearli for no such shadow of jealousi had
fallen on our affect i comfort her as well as i wa abl and
tell her all that had pass between me and lili i prai her to
stand my friend and lili should it ever be in her power to do so
thi mari promis to do readili enough and though she did not give the
reason i could see that she thought it possibl that she might be abl
to help us as i have said lili had a brother a young man of some
promis who at thi time wa awai at colleg and he and my sister mari
had a strong fanci for each other that might or might not ripen into
someth closer so we kiss and bade farewel with tear
and after that my father and i rode awai but when we had pass down
pirnhow street and mount the littl hill beyond waingford mill to
the left of bungai town i halt my hors and look back upon the
pleasant vallei of the wavenei where i wa born and my heart grew full
to burst had i known all that must befal me befor my ey beheld
that scene again i think inde that it would have burst but god who
in hi wisdom ha laid mani a burden upon the back of men ha save
them from thi for had we foreknowledg of the futur i think that of
our own will but few of us would live to see it so i cast on long last
look toward the distant mass of oak that mark the spot where lili
live and rode on
on the follow dai i embark on board the adventuress and we
sail befor i left my father heart soften much toward me for
he rememb that i wa my mother best belov and fear also lest
we should meet no more so much did it soften inde that at the last
hour he chang hi mind and wish to hold me back from go but
have put my hand to the plough and suffer all the bitter
of farewel i would not return to be mock by my brother and my
neighbour you speak too late father i said you desir me to go
to work thi vengeanc and stir me to it with mani bitter word and
now i would go if i knew that i must die within a week for such oath
cannot be lightli broken and till mine is fulfil the curs rest on
me
so be it son he answer with a sigh your mother cruel death
madden me and i said what i mai live to be sorri for though at the
best i shall not live long for my heart is broken perhap i should
have rememb that vengeanc is in the hand of the lord who wreak
it at hi own time and without our help do not think unkindli of me my
boi if we should chanc to meet no more for i love you and it wa but
the deeper love that i bore to your mother which made me deal harshli
with you
i know it father and bear no grudg but if you think that you ow me
anyth pai it by hold back my brother from work wrong to me and
lili bozard while i am absent
i will do my best son though were it not that you and she have grown
so dear to each other the match would have pleas me well but as i
have said i shall not be long here to watch your welfar in thi or ani
other matter and when i am gone thing must follow their own fate do
not forget your god or your home wherev you chanc to wander thoma
keep yourself from brawl bewar of women that ar the snare of
youth and set a watch upon your tongu and your temper which is not of
the best moreov wherev you mai be do not speak ill of the religion
of the land or make a mock of it by your wai of life lest you should
learn how cruel men can be when thei think that it is pleas to their
god as i have learnt alreadi
i said that i would bear hi counsel in mind and inde it save me
from mani a sorrow then he embrac me and call on the almighti to
take me in hi care and we part
i never saw him more for though he wa but middleag within a year
of my go my father di suddenli of a distemp of the heart in the
nave of ditchingham church as he stood there near the rood screen
muse by my mother grave on sundai after mass and my brother took
hi land and place god rest him also he wa a trueheart man but
more wrap up in hi love for my mother than it is well for ani man
to be who would look at life larg and do right by all for such love
though natur to women is apt to turn to someth that partak of
selfish and to caus him who bear it to think all els of small
account hi children were noth to my father when compar to my
mother and he would have been content to lose them everi on if therebi
he might have purchas back her life but after all it wa a nobl
infirm for he thought littl of himself and had gone through much to
win her
of my voyag to cadiz to which port i had learn that de garcia ship
wa bound there is littl to be told we met with contrari wind in
the bai of biscai and were driven into the harbour of lisbon where we
refit but at last we came safe to cadiz have been forti dai at
sea

hous of the famou physician whom i sought wa so place that the man
sit at thi doorwai could command it with hi ey and take note
of all who went in and came out when i had found the hous i return
again into the quiet street and walk to and fro there for a while
think of what tale i should tell to the physician and all the time
the littl man watch me with hi keen ey at last i had made up my
stori and went to the hous onli to find that the physician wa from
home have inquir when i might find him i left and onc more took

pavement and restor it to him
a thousand thank young sir he said in a full and gentl voic you

them which is nobodi busi except their owner i see that you
ar a stranger in thi cityno need to look surpris senor on who
is familiar with a town doe not gaze and stare and ask the path of
passersbi nor doe a nativ of sevil walk on the sunni side of the
street in summer and now if you will not think me impertin i will
ask you what can be the busi of so healthi a young man with my rival
yonder and he nod toward the hous of the famou physician
a man busi like hi name is hi own affair senor i answer
set my host down in my mind as on of those who disgrac our art by

again he nod toward the physician hous such as he will take no
apprentic without the fee be larg inde it is not the custom of thi
citi
then i must seek a livelihood elsewher or otherwis
i did not sai so now senor let us see what you know of medicin and
what is more import of human natur for of the first none of us can
ever know much but he who know the latter will be a leader of menor
of womenwho lead the men
and without more ado he put me mani question each of them so shrewd
and go so directli to the heart of the matter in hand that i
marvel at hi sagac some of these question were medic deal
chiefli with the ailment of women other were gener and dealt more
with their charact at length he finish

i accept

discharg your score and bring it here no need for you to go nephew
let us stop and drink anoth glass of wine the sooner we grow intim
the better nephew
it wa thu that first i becam acquaint with senor andr de fonseca
my benefactor the strangest man whom i have ever known doubtless ani
person read thi histori would think that i the narrat wa sow
a plenti crop of troubl for myself in have to deal with him
set him down as a rogu of the deepest such as sometim for their
own wick purpos decoi young men to crime and ruin but it wa not
so and thi is the strangest part of the strang stori all that andr
de fonseca told me wa true to the veri letter
he wa a gentleman of great talent who had been render a littl mad
by misfortun in hi earli life as a physician i have never met hi
master if inde he ha on in these time and as a man vers in the
world and more especi in the world of women i have known none to
compar with him he had travel far and seen much and he forgot
noth in part he wa a quack but hi quackeri alwai had a mean
in it he fleec the foolish inde and even juggl with astronomi
make monei out of their superstit but on the other hand he did
mani a kind act without reward he would make a rich ladi pai ten gold
peso for the dye of her hair but often he would nurs some poor
girl through her troubl and ask no charg ye and find her honest
employ after it he who knew all the secret of sevil never made
monei out of them by threat of exposur as he said becaus it would
not pai to do so but realli becaus though he affect to be a selfish
knave at bottom hi heart wa honest
for my own part i found life with him both easi and happi so far as
mine could be quit happi soon i learn my role and plai it well it
wa given out that i wa the nephew of the rich old physician fonseca
whom he wa train to take hi place and thi togeth with my
own appear and manner ensur me a welcom in the best hous of
sevil here i took that share of our busi which my master could
not take for now he never mix among the fashion of the citi monei i
wa suppli with in abund so that i could ruffl it with the
best but soon it becam known that i look to busi as well as to
pleasur often and often dure some gai ball or carniv a ladi would
glide up to me and ask beneath her breath if don andr de fonseca would
consent to see her privat on a matter of some import and i would
fix an hour then and there had it not been for me such patient would
have been lost to us sinc for the most part their timid had kept
them awai
in the same fashion when the festiv wa end and i prepar to wend
homeward now and again a gallant would slip hi arm in mine and ask
my master help in some affair of love or honour or even of the purs
then i would lead him straight to the old moorish hous where don andr
sat write in hi velvet robe like some spider in hi web for the most
of our busi wa done at night and straightwai the matter would
be attend to to my master profit and the satisfact of all by
degre it becam known that though i wa so young yet i had discret
and that noth which went in at my ear came out of my lip that i
neither brawl nor drank nor gambl to ani length and that though i
wa friendli with mani fair ladi there were none who were entitl to
know my secret also it becam known that i had some skill in my art of
heal and it wa said among the ladi of sevil that there live no
man in that citi so deft at clear the skin of blemish or chang
the colour of the hair as old fonseca nephew and as ani on mai know
thi reput alon wa worth a fortun thu it came about that i wa
more and more consult on my own account in short thing went so well
with us that in the first six month of my servic i ad by on third
to the receipt of my master practic larg as thei had been befor
besid lighten hi labour not a littl
it wa a strang life and of the thing that i saw and learn could
thei be written i might make a tale inde but thei have no part in
thi histori for it wa as though the smile and silenc with which men
and women hide their thought were done awai and their heart spoke to
us in the accent of truth now some fair young maid or wife would come
to us with confess of wicked that would be thought imposs
did not her stori prove itself the secret murder perchanc of a spous
or a lover or a rival now some ag dame who would win a husband in
hi teen now some wealthi lowborn man or woman who desir to bui an
allianc with on lack monei but of nobl blood such i did not care
to help inde but to the lovesick or the lovedelud i listen with
a readi ear for i had a fellowfeel with them inde so deep and
earnest wa my sympathi that more than onc i found the unhappi fair
readi to transfer their affect to my unworthi self and in fact onc
thing came about so that had i will it i could have marri on of
the loveliest and wealthiest nobl ladi of sevil
but i would none of it who thought of my english lili by dai and night
chapter viii
the second meet
it mai be thought that while i wa emploi thu i had forgotten the
object of my come to spain name to aveng my mother murder on the
person of juan de garcia but thi wa not so so soon as i wa settl
in the hous of andr de fonseca i set myself to make inquiri as to
de garcia whereabout with all possibl dilig but without result
inde when i came to consid the matter coolli it seem that i had
but a slender chanc of find him in thi citi he had inde given
it out in yarmouth that he wa bound for sevil but no ship bear
the same name as hi had put in at cadiz or sail up the guadalquivir
nor wa it like have commit murder in england that he would
speak the truth as to hi destin still i search on the hous
where my mother and grandmoth had live wa burn down and as their
mode of life had been retir after more than twenti year of chang
few even rememb their exist inde i onli discov on an
old woman whom i found live in extrem poverti and who onc had been
my grandmoth servant and knew my mother well although she wa not
in the hous at the time of her flight to england from thi woman i
gather some inform though needless to sai i did not tell her
that i wa the grandson of her old mistress
it seem that after my mother fled to england with my father de garcia
persecut my grandmoth and hi aunt with lawsuit and by other mean
till at last she wa reduc to beggari in which condit the villain
left her to die so poor wa she inde that she wa buri in a public
grave after that the old woman my inform said she had heard that
de garcia had commit some crime and been forc to flee the countri
what the crime wa she could not rememb but it had happen about
fifteen year ago
all thi i learn when i had been about three month in sevil and
though it wa of interest it did not advanc me in my search
some four or five night afterward as i enter my employ hous
i met a young woman come out of the doorwai of the patio she wa
thickli veil and my notic wa drawn to her by her tall and beauti
figur and becaus she wa weep so violent that her bodi shook
with her sob i wa alreadi well accustom to such sight for mani
of those who sought my master counsel had good caus to weep and i
pass her without remark but when i wa come into the room where he
receiv hi patient i mention that i had met such a person and
ask if it wa ani on whom i knew
ah nephew said fonseca who alwai call me thu by now and inde
began to treat me with as much affect as though i were realli of
hi blood a sad case but you do not know her and she is no pai
patient a poor girl of nobl birth who had enter religion and taken
her vow when a gallant appear meet her secretli in the convent
garden promis to marri her if she will fly with him inde doe go
through some mummeri of marriag with herso she saysand the rest
of it now he ha desert her and she is in troubl and what is more
should the priest catch her like to learn what it feel like to die
by inch in a convent wall she came to me for counsel and brought some
silver ornament as the fee here thei ar
you took them
ye i took themi alwai take a fee but i gave her back their weight
in gold what is more i told her where she might hide from the priest
till the hunt is done with what i did not like to tell her is that her
lover is the greatest villain who ever trod the street of sevil
what wa the good she will see littl more of him hist here come
the duchessan astrolog case thi where ar the horoscop and the
wand ye and the crystal ball there shade the lamp give me the
book and vanish
i obei and present met the great ladi a stout woman attend by
a duenna glide fearfulli through the darken archwai to learn the
answer of the star and pai mani good peso for it and the sight of her
made me laugh so much that i forgot quickli about the other ladi and her
woe
and now i must tell how i met my cousin and my enemi de garcia for the
second time two dai after my meet with the veil ladi it chanc
that i wa wander toward midnight through a lone part of the old
citi littl frequent by passersbi it wa scarc safe to be thu
alon in such a place and hour but the busi with which i had been
charg by my master wa on that must be carri out unattend also i
had no enemi whom i knew of and wa arm with the veri sword that i
had taken from de garcia in the lane at ditchingham the sword that had
slain my mother and which i bore in the hope that it might serv to
aveng her in the us of thi weapon i had grown expert enough by now
for everi morn i took lesson in the art of fenc
my busi be done i wa walk slowli homeward and as i went i
fell to think of the strang of my present life and of how far it
differ from my boyhood in the vallei of the wavenei and of mani other
thing and then i thought of lili and wonder how her dai pass and
if my brother geoffrei persecut her to marri him and whether or no
she would resist hi importun and her father and so as i walk
muse i came to a waterg that open on to the guadalquivir and
lean upon the cope of a low wall i rest there idli to consid
the beauti of the night in truth it wa a love night for across all
these year i rememb it let those who have seen it sai if thei know
ani prospect more beauti than the sight of the august moon shine on
the broad water of the guadalquivir and the cluster habit of
the ancient citi
now as i lean upon the wall and look i saw a man pass up the step
besid me and go on into the shadow of the street i took no note of him
till present i heard a murmur of distant voic and turn my head i
discov that the man wa in convers with a woman whom he had met
at the head of the path that ran down to the waterg doubtless it
wa a lover meet and sinc such sight ar of interest to all and
more especi to the young i watch the pair soon i learn that
there wa littl of tender in thi tryst at least on the part of
the gallant who drew continu backward toward me as though he would
seek the boat by which doubtless he had come and i marvel at thi
for the moonlight shone upon the woman face and even at that distanc
i could see that it wa veri fair the man face i could not see
howev sinc hi back wa toward me for the most part moreov he
wore a larg sombrero that shade it now thei came nearer to me the
man alwai draw backward and the woman alwai follow till at
length thei were within earshot the woman wa plead with the man
sure you will not desert me she said after marri me and
all that you have sworn you will not have the heart to desert me i
abandon everyth for you i am in great danger i and here her
voic fell so that i could not catch her word
then he spoke fairest now as alwai i ador you but we must part
awhil you ow me much isabella i have rescu you from the grave
i have taught you what it is to live and love doubtless with your
advantag and charm your great charm you will profit by the lesson
monei i cannot give you for i have none to spare but i have endow
you with experi that is more valuabl by far thi is our farewel
for awhil and i am brokenheart yet
neath fairer ski shine other ey
and i and again he spoke so low that i could not catch hi word
as he talk on all my bodi began to trembl the scene wa move
inde but it wa not that which stir me so deepli it wa the man
voic and bear that remind meno it could scarc be
oh you will not be so cruel said the ladi to leav me your wife
thu alon and in such sore troubl and danger take me with you juan
i beseech you and she caught him by the arm and clung to him
he shook her from him somewhat roughli and as he did so hi wide hat
fell to the ground so that the moonlight shone upon hi face by heaven
it wa hejuan de garcia and no other i could not be mistaken there
wa the deepli carv cruel face the high forehead with the scar on
it the thin sneer mouth the peak beard and curl hair chanc
had given him into my hand and i would kill him or he should kill me
i took three pace and stood befor him draw my sword as i came
what my dove have you a bulli at hand he said step back
astonish your busi senor ar you here to champion beauti in
distress
i am here juan de garcia to aveng a murder woman do you rememb
a certain river bank awai in england where you chanc to meet a ladi
you had known and to leav her dead or if you have forgotten perhap
at least you will rememb thi which i carri that it mai kill you
and i flash the sword that had been hi befor hi ey
mother of god it is the english boi who and he stop
it is thoma wingfield who beat and bound you and who now purpos to
finish what he began yonder as he ha sworn draw or juan de garcia i
will stab you where you stand
de garcia heard thi speech that todai seem to me to smack of the
theatr though it wa spoken in grimmest earnest and hi face grew
like the face of a trap wolf yet i saw that he had no mind to fight
not becaus of cowardic for to do him justic he wa no coward but
becaus of superstit he fear to fight with me sinc as i learn
afterward he believ that he would meet hi end at my hand and it
wa for thi reason chiefli that he strove to kill me when first we met
the duello ha it law senor he said courteous it is not usual
to fight thu unsecond and in the presenc of a woman if you believ
that you have ani grievanc against methough i know not of what you
rave or the name by which you call mei will meet you where and when
you will and all the while he look over hi shoulder seek some
wai of escap
you will meet me now i answer draw or i strike
then he drew and we fell to it desper enough till the spark
flew inde and the rattl of steel upon steel rang down the quiet
street at first he had somewhat the better of me for my hate made me
wild in my plai but soon i settl to the work and grew cooler i meant
to kill himmor i knew that i should kill him if none came between
us he wa still a better swordsman than i who till i fought with him
in the lane at ditchingham had never even seen on of these spanish
rapier but i had the youth and the right on my side as also i had an
ey like a hawk and a wrist of steel
slowli i press him back and ever my plai grew closer and better and
hi becam wilder now i had touch him twice onc in the face and i
held him with hi back against the wall of the wai that led down to the
waterg and it had come to thi that he scarc strove to thrust
at me at all but stood on hi defenc wait till i should tire then
when victori wa in my hand disast overtook me for the woman who had
been watch bewild saw that her faithless lover wa in danger of
death and straightwai seiz me from behind at the same time send
up shriek after shriek for help i shook her from me quickli enough
but not befor de garcia see hi advantag had dealt me a coward
thrust that took me in the right shoulder and half crippl me so that
in my turn i must stand on my defenc if i would keep my life in me
meanwhil the shriek had been heard and of a sudden the watch came
run round the corner whistl for help de garcia saw them and
disengag suddenli turn and ran for the waterg the ladi also
vanish whither i do not know
now the watch wa on me and their leader came at me to seiz me
hold a lantern in hi hand i struck it with the handl of the sword
so that it fell upon the roadwai where it blaze up like a bonfir
then i turn also and fled for i did not wish to be drag befor
the magistr of the citi as a brawler and in my desir to escap i
forgot that de garcia wa escap also awai i went and three of the
watch after me but thei were stout and scant of breath and by the
time that i had run three furlong i distanc them i halt to get my
breath and rememb that i had lost de garcia and did not know when i
should find him again at first i wa mind to return and seek him but
reflect told me that by now it would be useless also that the end
of it might be that i should fall into the hand of the watch who would
know me by my wound which began to pain me so i went homeward curs
my fortun and the woman who had clasp me from behind just as i wa
about to send the deaththrust home and also my lack of skill which had
delai that thrust so long twice i might have made it and twice i had
wait be overcauti and overanxi to be sure and now i had
lost my chanc and might bide mani a dai befor it came again
how should i find him in thi great citi doubtless though i had not
thought of it de garcia pass under some feign name as he had done
at yarmouth it wa bitter inde to have been so near to vengeanc and
to have miss it
by now i wa at home and bethought me that i should do well to go to
fonseca my master and ask hi help hitherto i had said noth of
thi matter to him for i have alwai love to keep my own counsel and
as yet i had not spoken of my past even to him go to the room where
he wa accustom to receiv patient i found he had retir to rest
leav order that i wa not to awak him thi night as he wa weari
so i bound up my hurt after a fashion and sought my bed also veri
illsatisfi with my fortun
on the morrow i went to my master chamber where he still lai ab
have been seiz by a sudden weak that wa the begin of
the ill which end in hi death as i mix a draught for him he
notic that my shoulder wa hurt and ask me what had happen thi
gave me my opportun which i wa not slow to take
have you patienc to listen to a stori i said for i would seek your

then i sat down by the bed and told him all keep noth back i
told him the histori of my mother and my father courtship of my own
childhood of the murder of my mother by de garcia and of the oath
that i had sworn to be aveng upon him lastli i told him of what had
happen upon the previou night and how my enemi had evad me all the
while that i wa speak fonseca wrap in a rich moorish robe sat
up in the bed hold hi knee beneath hi chin and watch my face
with hi keen ey but he spoke no word and made no sign till i had
finish the tale

part youth fail through rash but you err by overcaut by
overcaut in your fenc you lost your chanc last night and so by
overcaut in hide thi tale from me you have lost a far greater
opportun what have you not seen me give counsel in mani such
matter and have you ever known me to betrai the confid even of the
veriest stranger why then did you fear for your

for myself
pride goeth befor a fall nephew now listen had i known thi histori
a month ago by now de garcia had perish miser and not by your
hand but by that of the law i have been acquaint with the man from
hi childhood and know enough to hang him twice over did i choos to

like in your face to her that haunt me for from the first it wa
familiar it wa i also who bribe the keeper of the holi offic to let
your father loos though as it chanc i never saw him and arrang
hi flight sinc then i have had de garcia through my hand some four
or five time now under thi name and now under that onc even he came
to me as a client but the villaini that he would have work wa too
black for me to touch thi man is the wickedest whom i have known in
sevil and that is sai much also he is the cleverest and the most
reveng he live by vice for vice and there ar mani death upon
hi hand but he ha never prosper in hi evildo and todai
he is but an adventur without a name who live by blackmail and by
ruin women that he mai rob them at hi leisur give me those book

from the night of my duel with the murder my master health declin
steadili through the action of a wast diseas of the liver which
baffl all skill so that within eight month of that time he lai
almost bedridden and at the point of death hi mind inde remain
quit clear and on occas he would even receiv those who came to
consult him reclin on a chair and wrap in hi embroid robe
but the hand of death lai on him and he knew that it wa so as the
week went by he grew more and more attach to me till at length had
i been hi son he could not have treat me with a greater affect
while for my part i did what lai in my power to lessen hi suffer
for he would let no other physician near him
at length when he had grown veri feebl he express a desir to see a
notari the man he name wa sent for and remain closet with him for
an hour or more when he left for a while to return with sever of
hi clerk who accompani him to my master room from which i wa

doe it matter if the road ha been good or bad when we have reach the
goal for my part religion neither comfort nor frighten me now at the
last i will stand or fall upon the record of my life i have done evil

temptat have been too strong for me at time the good also becaus
my heart prompt me to it well it is finish and after all death
cannot be so terribl see that everi human be is born to undergo
it togeth with all live thing whatev els is fals i hold thi
to be true that god exist and is more merci than those who preach
him would have us to believ and he ceas exhaust
often sinc then i have thought of hi word and i still think of them
now that my own hour is so near as will be seen fonseca wa a fatalist
a belief which i do not altogeth share hold as i do that within
certain limit we ar allow to shape our own charact and destini
but hi last sai i believ to be true god is and is merci and
death is not terribl either in it act or in it consequ
present fonseca spoke again why do you lead me to talk of such
thing thei weari me and i have littl time i wa tell of my will

will inherit nephew amount in all to about five thousand gold peso
or perhap twelv thousand of your english pound enough for a young
man to begin life on even with a wife inde there in england it mai
well be held a great fortun and i think that your betroth father
will make no more object to you as a soninlaw also there is thi
hous and all that it contain the librari and the silver ar valuabl
and you will do well to keep them all is left to you with the fullest
formal so that no question can aris as to your right to take it
inde forese my end i have of late call in my monei and for
the most part the gold li in strong box in the secret cupboard in
the wall yonder that you know of it would have been more had i known

without an heir i gave awai as much as what remain in act of merci
and in provid refug for the homeless and the suffer thoma
wingfield for the most part thi monei ha come to me as the fruit
of human folli and human wretched frailti and sin us it for
the purpos of wisdom and the advanc of right and liberti mai it
prosper you and remind you of me your old master the spanish quack
till at last you pass it on to your children or the poor and now on
word more if your conscienc will let you abandon the pursuit of de
garcia take your fortun and go with it to england wed that maid whom
you desir and follow after happi in whatev wai seem best to
you who ar you that you should meet out vengeanc on thi knave de
garcia let him be and he will aveng himself upon himself otherwis
you mai undergo much toil and danger and in the end lose love and
life and fortun at a blow
but i have sworn to kill him i answer and how can i break so
solemn an oath how could i sit at home in peac beneath the burden of
such shame
i do not know it is not for me to judg you must do as you wish but
in the do of it it mai happen that you will fall into greater shame
than thi you have fought the man and he ha escap you let him go if

desir that you should see me die and my death is near i cannot tell
if we shall meet again when in your turn you have lain as i lie now or
if we shape our cours for differ star if so farewel for ever
then i leant down and kiss him on the forehead and as i did so i
wept for not till thi hour did i learn how truli i had come to love
him so truli that it seem to me as though my father lai there dy
weep not he said for all our life is but a part onc i had a
son like you and our wa the bitterest of farewel now i go to seek
for him again who could not come back to me so weep not becaus i die
goodby thoma wingfield mai god prosper and protect you now go
so i went weep and that night befor the dawn all wa over with
andr de fonseca thei told me that he wa consciou to the end and
di murmur the name of that son of whom he spoke in hi last word
to me
what wa the histori of thi son or of fonseca himself i never
learn for like an indian he hid hi trail as step by step he wander
down the path of life he never spoke of hi past and in all the book
and document that he left behind him there is no allus to it onc
some year ago i read through the cipher volum of record that i have
spoken of and of which he gave me the kei befor he di thei stand
befor me on the shelf as i write and in them ar mani histori of
shame sorrow and evil of faith delud and innoc betrai of
the cruelti of priest of avaric triumphant over love and of love
triumphant over deathenough inde to furnish half a hundr of
true romanc but among these chronicl of a gener now past and
forgotten there is no mention of fonseca own name and no hint of hi
own stori it is lost for ever and perhap thi is well so di my
benefactor and best friend
when he wa made readi for burial i went in to see him and he look
calm and beauti in hi death sleep then it wa that she who had
arrai him for the grave hand to me two portrait most delic
paint on ivori and set in gold which had been found about hi neck
i have them yet on is of the head of a ladi with a sweet and wist
counten and the other the face of a dead youth also beauti but
veri sad doubtless thei were mother and son but i know no more about
them
on the morrow i buri andr de fonseca but with no pomp for he had
said that he wish as littl monei as possibl spent upon hi dead
bodi and return to the hous to meet the notari then the seal
were broken and the parchment read and i wa put in full possess of
the dead man wealth and have deduct such sum as were payabl for
due legaci and fee the notari left me bow humbl for wa i
not rich ye i wa rich wealth had come to me without effort and
i had reason to desir it yet thi wa the saddest night that i had
pass sinc i set foot in spain for my mind wa fill with doubt and
sorrow and moreov my loneli got a hold of me but sad as it might
be it wa destin to seem yet more sorrow befor the morn for

die thi night a walk of a hundr pace brought us to anoth door in
the wall of a long low build of moorish style here the knock and
the question were repeat at more length then the door wa open
and i found myself in a passag ill light long and narrow in the
depth of which i could see the figur of nun flit to and fro like
bat in a tomb the abbess walk down the passag till she came to a
door on the right which she open it led into a cell and here she
left me in the dark for ten minut or more i stai there a prei to

chapter x
the pass of isabella de siguenza
silent we went down the long passag and as we went i saw the ey of
the dweller in thi live tomb watch us pass through the grate of
their cell door littl wonder that the woman about to die had striven
to escap from such a home back to the world of life and love yet for
that crime she must perish sure god will rememb the do of such
men as these priest and the nation that foster them and in deed he
doe rememb for where is the splendour of spain todai and where ar
the cruel rite she glori in here in england their fetter ar broken
for ever and in strive to bind them fast upon us free englishmen she
is broken alsonev to be whole again
at the far end of the passag we found a stair down which we pass at
it foot wa an ironbound door that the monk unlock and lock
again upon the further side then came anoth passag hollow in the
thick of the wall and a second door and we were in the place of
death
it wa a vault low and damp and the water of the river wash it
outer wall for i could hear their murmur in the silenc perhap the
place mai have measur ten pace in length by eight broad for the rest
it roof wa support by massiv column and on on side there wa a
second door that led to a prison cell at the further end of thi gloomi
den that wa dimli light by torch and lamp two men with hood
head and drape in coars black gown were at work silent mix
lime that sent up a hot steam upon the stagnant air by their side were
squar of dress stone rang neatli against the end of the vault and
befor them wa a nich cut in the thick of the wall itself shape
like a larg coffin set upon it smaller end in front of thi nich wa
place a massiv chair of chestnut wood i notic also that two other
such coffinshap nich had been cut in thi same wall and fill
in with similar block of whitish stone on the face of each wa a date
grave in deep letter on had been seal up some thirti year befor
and on hard upon a hundr
these two men were the onli occup of the vault when we enter it
but present a sound of soft and solemn sing stole down the second
passag then the door wa open the mason monk ceas labour at
the heap of lime and the sound of sing grew louder so that i could
catch the refrain it wa that of a latin hymn for the dy next
through the open door came the choir eight veil nun walk two
by two and rang themselv on either side of the vault thei ceas
their sing after them follow the doom woman guard by two more
nun and last of all a priest bear a crucifix thi man wore a black
robe and hi thin halffrenzi face wa uncov all these and other
thing i notic and rememb yet at the time it seem to me that i
saw noth except the figur of the victim i knew her again although
i had seen her but onc in the moonlight she wa chang inde her
love face wa fuller and the great torment ey shone like star
against it waxen pallor reliev by the carmin of her lip alon
still it wa the same face that some eight month befor i had seen
lift in entreati to her fals lover now her tall shape wa wrap
about with grave cloth over which her black hair stream and in
her arm she bore a sleep babe that from time to time she press
convuls to her breast
on the threshold of her tomb isabella de siguenza paus and look
round wildli as though for help scan each of the silent watcher to
find a friend among them then her ey fell upon the nich and the heap
of smoke lime and the men who guard it and she shudder and would
have fallen had not those who attend her led her to the chair and
place her in ita live corps
now the dread rite began the dominican father stood befor her and
recit her offenc and the sentenc that had been pass upon her
which doom her to be left alon with god and the child of your sin
that he mai deal with you as he see fit to all of thi she seem to
pai no heed nor to the exhort that follow at length he ceas
with a sigh and turn to me said
draw near to thi sinner brother and speak with her befor it is too
late
lest such cruelti should seem imposs and
unpreced the writer mai mention that in the museum of
the citi of mexico he ha seen the desicc bodi of a
young woman which wa found immur in the wall of a
religi build with it is the bodi of an infant
although the exact caus of her execut remain a matter
of conjectur there can be no doubt as to the manner of her
death for in addit to other evid the mark of the
rope with which her limb were bound in life ar still
distinctli visibl such in those dai were the merci of
religion
then he bade all present gather themselv at the far end of the vault
that our talk might not be overheard and thei did so without wonder
think doubtless that i wa a monk sent to confess the doom woman
so i drew near with a beat heart and bend over her i spoke in her
ear
listen to me isabella de siguenza i said and as i utter the name
she start wildli where is that de garcia who deceiv and desert
you
how have you learnt hi true name she answer not even tortur
would have wrung it from me as you know
i am no monk and i know noth i am that man who fought with de
garcia on the night when you were taken and who would have kill him
had you not seiz me
at the least i save him that is my comfort now
isabella de siguenza i said i am your friend the best you ever had
and the last as you shall learn present tell me where thi man is
for there is that between us which must be settl
if you ar my friend weari me no more i do not know where he is
month ago he went whither you will scarc follow to the furthest
indi but you will never find him there
it mai still be that i shall and if it should so chanc sai have you
ani messag for thi man
noney thi tell him how we di hi child and hi wifetel him
that i did my best to hide hi name from the priest lest some like fate
should befal him
is that all
ye no it is not all tell him that i pass awai love and
forgiv
my time is short i said awak and listen for have spoken thu
she seem to be sink into a lethargi i wa the assist of that
andr de fonseca whose counsel you put asid to your ruin and i have
given a certain drug to the abbess yonder when she offer you the cup
of water see that you drink and deep you and the child if so none
shall ever die more happili do you understand
yesy she gasp and mai bless rest upon you for the gift
now i am no more afraidfor i have long desir to dieit wa the wai
i fear
then farewel and god be with you unhappi woman
farewel she answer softli but call me not unhappi who am about
to die thu easili with that i love and she glanc at the sleep
babe
then i drew back and stood with bent head speak no word now the
dominican motion to all to take the place where thei had stood befor
and ask her
er sister have you aught to sai befor you ar silent for ever
ye she answer in a clear sweet voic that never even quaver
so bold had she becom sinc she learn that her death would be swift
and easi ye i have thi to sai that i go to my end with a clean
heart for if i have sin it is against custom and not against god
i broke the vow inde but i wa forc to take those vow and
therefor thei did not bind i wa a woman born for light and love
and yet i wa thrust into the dark of thi cloister there to wither
dead in life and so i broke the vow and i am glad that i have
broken them though it ha brought me to thi if i wa deceiv and
my marriag is no marriag befor the law as thei tell me now i knew
noth of it therefor to me it is still valid and holi and on my soul
there rest no stain at the least i have live and for some few hour
i have been wife and mother and it is as well to die swiftli in thi
cell that your merci ha prepar as more slowli in those abov and
now for youi tell you that your wicked shall find you out you who
dare to sai to god childreny shall not love and to work murder
on them becaus thei will not listen it shall find you out i sai and
not onli you but the church you serv both priest and church shall be
broken togeth and shall be a scorn in the mouth of men to come
she is distraught said the dominican as a sigh of fear and wonder
went round the vault and blasphem in her mad forget her word
shrive her brother swiftli er she add to them
then the blackrob keenei priest came to her and hold the
cross befor her face began to mutter i know not what but she rose
from the chair and thrust the crucifix asid
peac she said i will not be shriven by such as you i take my sin
to god and not to youyou who do murder in the name of christ
the fanat heard and a furi took him
then go unshriven down to hell you and he name her by ill name
and struck her in the face with the ivori crucifix
the dominican bade him ceas hi revil angrili enough but isabella
de siguenza wipe her bruis brow and laugh aloud a dread laugh to
hear
now i see that you ar a coward also she said priest thi is my
last prayer that you also mai perish at the hand of fanat and more
terribl than i die tonight
then thei hurri her into the place prepar for her and she spoke
again
give me to drink for we thirst my babe and i
now i saw the abbess enter that passag whenc the victim had been led
present she came back bear a cup of water in her hand and with it a
loaf of bread and i knew by her mien that my draught wa in the water
but of what befel afterward i cannot sai certainli for i prai
the dominican to open the door by which we had enter the vault and
pass through it i stood daze with horror at some distanc a
while went by i do not know how long till at length i saw the abbess
stand befor me a lantern in her hand and she wa sob bitterli
all is done she said nai have no fear the draught work well
befor ever a stone wa laid mother and child slept sound ala for her
soul who di unrepent and unshriven
ala for the soul of all who have share in thi night work i
answer now mother let me henc and mai we never meet again
then she led me back to the cell where i tore off that accurs monk
robe and thenc to the door in the garden wall and to the boat which
still wait on the river and i rejoic to feel the sweet air upon my
face as on rejoic who awak from some foul dream but i won littl
sleep that night nor inde for some dai to come for whenev i
close my ey there rose befor me the vision of that beauteou woman
as i saw her last by the murki torchlight wrap in grave cloth and
stand in the coffinshap nich proud and defiant to the end her
child clasp to her with on arm while the other wa outstretch to
take the draught of death few have seen such a sight for the holi
offic and it helper do not seek wit to their dark deed and
none would wish to see it twice if i have describ it ill it is not
that i have forgotten but becaus even now after the laps of some
seventi year i can scarc bear to write of it or to set out it
horror fulli but of all that wa wonder about it perhap the most
wonder wa that even to the last thi unfortun ladi should still
have clung to her love for the villain who have deceiv her by a
fals marriag desert her leav her to such a doom to what end
can so holi a gift as thi great love of her have been bestow on such
a man none can sai but so it wa yet now that i think of it there is
on thing even stranger than her faith
it will be rememb that when the fanat priest struck her she prai
that he also might die at such hand and more terribl than she must do
so it came about in after year that veri man father pedro by name
wa sent to convert the heathen of anahuac among whom becaus of hi
cruelti he wa known as the christian devil but it chanc that
ventur too far among a clan of the otomi befor thei were final
subdu he fell into the hand of some priest of the war god huitzel
and by them wa sacrif after their dread fashion i saw him as he
went to hi death and without tell that i had been present when
it wa utter i call to hi mind the dy curs of isabella de
siguenza then for a moment hi courag gave wai for see in me
noth but an indian chief he believ that the devil had put the
word into my lip to torment him caus me to speak of what i knew
noth but enough of thi now if it is necessari i will tell of it in
it proper place at least whether it wa by chanc or becaus she had
a gift of vision in her last hour or that provid wa aveng on
him after thi fashion so it came about and i do not sorrow for it
though the death of thi priest brought much misfortun on me
thi then wa the end of isabella de siguenza who wa murder by
priest becaus she had dare to break their rule
so soon as i could clear my mind somewhat of all that i had seen and
heard in that dread vault i began to consid the circumst in
which i found myself in the first place i wa now a rich man and if it
pleas me to go back to norfolk with my wealth as fonseca had point
out my prospect were fair inde but the oath that i had taken hung
like lead about my neck i had sworn to be aveng upon de garcia and
i had prai that the curs of heaven might rest upon me till i wa so
aveng but in england live in peac and plenti i could scarc come
by vengeanc moreov now i knew where he wa or at least in what
portion of the world i might seek him and there where white men ar few
he could not hide from me as in spain thi tide i had gain from
the doom ladi and i have told her stori at some length becaus it
wa through it and her that i came to journei to hispaniola as it wa
becaus of the sacrific of her tormentor father pedro by the priest
of the otomi that i am here in england thi dai sinc had it not been
for that sacrific the spaniard would never have storm the citi of
pine where aliv or dead i should doubtless have been to thi hour
for thu do seem accid build up the fate of men had those word
never pass isabella lip doubtless in time i should have weari
of a useless search and sail for home and happi but have heard
them it seem to me to my undo that thi would be to plai the
part of a sorri coward moreov strang as it mai look now i felt
as though i had two wrong to aveng that of my mother and that of
isabella de siguenza inde none could have seen that young and love
ladi die thu terribl and not desir to wreak her death on him who had
betrai and desert her
so the end of it wa that be of a stubborn temper i determin to do
violenc to my own desir and the dy counsel of my benefactor and
to follow de garcia to the end of the earth and there to kill him as i
had sworn to do
first howev i inquir secretli and dilig as to the truth of
the statement that de garcia had sail for the indi and to be brief
have the clue i discov that two dai after the date of the duel i
had fought with him a man answer to de garcia descript though
bear a differ name had ship from sevil in a carak bound for
the canari island which carak wa there to await the arriv of the
fleet sail for hispaniola inde from variou circumst i had
littl doubt that the man wa none other than de garcia himself which
although i had not thought of it befor wa not strang see that
then as now the indi were the refug of half the desperado and
villain who could no longer live in spain thither then i made up my
mind to follow him consol myself a littl by the thought that at
least i should see new and wonder countri though how new and
wonder thei were i did not guess
now it remain for me to dispos of the wealth which had come to me
suddenli while i wa wonder how i could place it in safeti till my
return i heard by chanc that the adventuress of yarmouth the same
ship in which i had come to spain a year befor wa again in the port
of cadiz and i bethought me that the best thing i could do with the
gold and other articl of valu would be to ship them to england there
to be held in trust for me so have despatch a messag to my friend
the captain of the adventuress that i had freight of valu for him i
made my prepar to depart from sevil with such speed as i might
and to thi end i sold my benefactor hous with mani of the effect
at a price much below their worth the most of the book and plate
togeth with some other articl i kept and pack them in case
i caus them to be transport down the river to cadiz to the care
of those same agent to whom i had receiv letter from the yarmouth
merchant
thi be done i follow thither myself take the bulk of my fortun
with me in gold which i hid artfulli in numer packag and so it
came to pass that after a stai of a year in sevil i turn my back on
it for ever my sojourn there had been fortun for i came to it
poor and left it a rich man to sai noth of what i had gain in
experi which wa much yet i wa glad to be gone for here juan de
garcia had escap me here i had lost my best friend and seen isabella
de siguenza die
i came to cadiz in safeti and without loss of ani of my good or gold
and take boat proceed on board the adventuress where i found her
captain whose name wa bell in good health and veri glad to see me
what pleas me more howev wa that he had three letter for me on
from my father on from my sister mari and on from my betroth lili
bozard the onli letter i ever receiv from her the content of these
write were not altogeth pleas howev for i learn from them
that my father wa in broken health and almost bedridden and inde
though i did not know it for mani year after he di in ditchingham
church upon the veri dai that i receiv hi letter it wa short and
sad and in it he said that he sorrow much that he had allow me
to go upon my mission sinc he should see me no more and could onli
commend me to the care of the almighti and prai him for my safe return
as for lili letter which hear that the adventuress wa to sail
for cadiz she had found mean to despatch secretli though it wa not
short it wa sad also and told me that so soon as my back wa turn on
home my brother geoffrei had ask her in marriag from her father and
that thei push the matter strongli so that her life wa made a miseri
to her for my brother waylaid her everywher and her father did
not ceas to revil her as an obstin jade who would fling awai her
fortun for the sake of a penniless wander
but it went on be assur sweetheart that unless thei marri me by
forc as thei have threaten to do i will not budg from my promis
and thoma should i be wed thu against my will i shall not be
a wife for long for though i am strong i believ that i shall die of
shame and sorrow it is hard that i should be thu torment and for
on reason onli that you ar not rich still i have good hope that
thing mai better themselv for i see that my brother wilfr is
much inclin toward your sister mari and though he also urg thi
marriag on me todai she is a friend to both of us and mai be in
the wai to make term with him befor she accept hi suit then the
write end with mani tender word and prayer for my safe return
as for the letter from my sister mari it wa to the same purpos as
yet she said she could do noth for me with lili bozard for my
brother geoffrei wa mad with love for her my father wa too ill
to meddl in the matter and squir bozard wa fierc set upon the
marriag becaus of the land that were at stake still she hint
thing might not alwai be so as a time might come when she could speak
up for me and not in vain
now all thi new gave me much caus for thought more inde it awok
in me a long for home which wa so strong that it grew almost to a
sick her love word and the perfum that hung about the letter
of my betroth brought lili back to me in such sort that my heart ach
with a desir to be with her moreov i knew that i should be welcom
now for my fortun wa far greater than my brother would ever be
and parent do not show the door to suitor who bring more than twelv
thousand golden piec in their baggag also i wish to see my father
again befor he pass beyond my reach but still between me and
my desir lai the shadow of de garcia and my oath i had brood on
vengeanc for so long that i felt even in the midst of thi strong
temptat that i should have no pleasur in my life if i forsook my
quest to be happi i must first kill de garcia moreov i had come to
believ that did i so forsak it the curs which i had invok would
sure fall upon me
meanwhil i did thi go to a notari i caus him to prepar a deed
which i translat into english by thi deed i vest all my fortun
except two hundr peso that i kept for my own us in three person to
hold the same on my behalf till i came to claim it those three person
were my old master doctor grimston of bungai whom i knew for the
honestest of men my sister mari wingfield and my betroth lili
bozard i direct them by thi deed which for greater valid i
sign upon the ship and caus to be wit by captain bell and
two other englishmen to deal with the properti accord to their
discret invest not less than half of it in the purchas of land
and put the rest out to interest which interest with the rent of
the land wa to be paid to the said lili bozard for her own us for so
long as she remain unmarri
also with the deed i execut a will by which i devis the most of my
properti to lili bozard should she be unmarri at the date of my death
and the residu to my sister mari in the event of the marriag or death
of lili then the whole wa to pass to mari and her heir
these two document be sign and seal i deliv them togeth
with all my treasur and other good into the keep of captain bell
charg him solemnli to hand them and my possess to dr grimston
of bungai by whom he would be liber reward thi he promis to
do though not until he had urg me almost with tear to accompani them
myself
with the gold and the deed i sent sever letter to my father my
sister my brother dr grimston squir bozard and lastli to lili
herself in these letter i gave an account of my life and fortun
sinc i had come to spain for i gather that other which i had sent
had never reach england and told them of my resolut to follow de
garcia to the end of the earth
other i wrote to lili mai think me a madman thu to postpon or
perchanc to lose a happi which i desir abov anyth on earth
but you who understand my heart will not blame me howev much you mai
griev for my decis you will know that when onc i have set my mind
upon an object noth except death itself can turn me from it and
that in thi matter i am bound by an oath which my conscienc will
not suffer me to break i could never be happi even at your side if i
abandon my search now first must come the toil and then the rest
first the sorrow and then the joi do not fear for me i feel that i
shall live to return again and if i do not return at least i am
abl to provid for you in such fashion that you need never be marri
against your will while de garcia live i must follow him
to my brother geoffrei i wrote veri shortli tell him what i thought
of hi conduct in persecut an undefend maiden and strive to do
wrong to an absent brother i have heard that my letter pleas him veri
ill
and here i mai state that those letter and everyth els that i
sent came safe to yarmouth there the gold and good were taken to
lowestoft and put aboard a wherri and when he had discharg hi ship
captain bell sail up the wavenei with them till he brought them to
bungai staith and thenc to the hous of dr grimston in netherg
street here were gather my sister and brother for my father wa then
two month buriedand also squir bozard and hi son and daughter for
captain bell had advis them of hi come by messeng and when all
the tale wa told there wa wonder and to spare still greater did it
grow when the chest were open and the weight of bullion compar with
that set out in my letter for there had never been so much gold at
onc in bungai within the memori of man
and now lili wept first for joi becaus of my good fortun and then
for sorrow becaus i had not come with my treasur and when he had seen
all and heard the deed read by virtu of which lili wa a rich woman
whether i live or di the squir her father swore aloud and said that
he had alwai thought well of me and kiss hi daughter wish her
joi of her luck in short all were pleas except my brother who left
the hous without a word and straightwai took to evil cours for
now the cup wa dash from hi lip see that have come into my
father land he had brought it about that lili wa to be marri to
him by might if no other mean would serv for even now a man can forc
hi daughter into marriag while she is under ag and squir bozard
wa not on to shrink from such a deed hold as he did that a woman
fanci were of no account but on thi dai so great is the power of
gold there wa no more talk of her marri ani man except myself
inde her father would have held her back from such a thing had she
shown a mind to it see that then lili would have lost the wealth
which i had settl on her but all talk loudli of my mad becaus
i would not abandon the chase of my enemi but chose to follow him to
the far indi though squir bozard took comfort from the thought that
whether i live or di the monei wa still hi daughter onli lili
spoke up for me sai thoma ha sworn an oath and he doe well to
keep it for hi honour is at stake now i go to wait until he come to
me in thi world or the next
but all thi is out of place for mani a year pass awai befor i heard
of these do
chapter xi
the loss of the carak
on the dai after i had given my fortun and letter into the charg of
captain bell i watch the adventuress drop slowli round the mole
of cadiz and so sad wa i at heart that i am not asham to confess
i wept i would gladli have lost the wealth she carri if she had but
carri me but my purpos wa indomit and it must be some other
ship that would bear me home to the shore of england
as it chanc a larg spanish carak name la cinqu llaga or the
five wound wa about to sail for hispaniola and have obtain a
licenc to trade i took passag in her under my assum name of daila
pass myself off as a merchant to further thi decept i purchas
good the valu of on hundr and five peso and of such natur as i
wa inform were most readili saleabl in the indi which merchandis
i ship with me the vessel wa full of spanish adventur mostli
ruffian of vari career and strang histori but none the less
good companion enough when not in drink by thi time i could speak
castilian so perfectli and wa so spanish in appear that it wa
not difficult for me to pass myself off as on of their nation and thi
i did invent a feign tale of my parentag and of the reason
that led me to tempt the sea for the rest now as ever i kept my own
counsel and notwithstand my reserv for i would not mingl in their
orgi i soon becam well like by my comrad chiefli becaus of my
skill in minist to their sick
of our voyag there is littl to tell except of it sad end at the
canari isl we stai a month and then sail awai for hispaniola
meet with fine weather but light wind when as our captain
reckon we were within a week sail of the port of san domingo for
which we were bound the weather chang and present gather to a
furiou tempest from the north that grew more terribl everi hour for
three dai and night our cumbrou vessel groan and labour beneath
the stress of the gale that drove us on rapidli we knew not whither
till at length it becam clear that unless the weather moder
we must founder our ship leak at everi seam on of our mast wa
carri awai and anoth broken in two at a height of twenti feet from
the deck but all these misfortun were small compar to what wa to
come for on the fourth morn a great wave swept off our rudder and
we drift helpless befor the wave an hour later a green sea came
aboard of us wash awai the captain so that we fill and settl
down to founder
then began a most horrid scene for sever dai both the crew and
passeng had been drink heavili to allai their terror and now that
thei saw their end at hand thei rush to and fro scream prai
and blasphem such of them as remain sober began to get out the two
boat into which i and anoth man a worthi priest strove to place
the women and children of whom we had sever on board but thi wa no
easi task for the drunken sailor push them asid and tri to spring
into the boat the first of which overturn so that all were lost
just then the carak gave a lurch befor she sank and see that
everyth wa over i call to the priest to follow me and spring
into the sea i swam for the second boat which laden with some
shriek women had drift loos in the confus as it chanc i
reach it safe be a strong swimmer and wa abl to rescu the
priest befor he sank then the vessel rear herself up on her stern
and float thu for a minut or more which gave us time to get out the
oar and row some fathom further awai from her scarc had we done
so when with on wild and fear scream from those on board of her
she rush down into the depth below nearli take us with her for
a while we sat silent for our horror overwhelm us but when the
whirlpool which she made had ceas to boil we row back to where the
carak had been now all the sea wa strewn with wreckag but among it
we found onli on child live that had clung to an oar the rest
some two hundr soul had been suck down with the ship and perish
miser or if there were ani still live we could not find them in
that welter sea over which the dark wa fall
inde it wa well for our own safeti that we fail in so do for
the littl boat had ten soul on board in all which wa as mani as she
could carryth priest and i be the onli men among them i have said
that the dark wa fall and as it chanc happili for us so wa
the sea or assuredli we must have been swamp all that we could
do wa to keep the boat head straight to the wave and thi we did
through the long night it wa a strang thing to see or rather to
hear that good man the priest my companion confess the women on
by on as he labour at hi oar and when all were shriven send up
prayer to god for the salvat of our soul for of the safeti of our
bodi we despair what i felt mai well be imagin but i forbear
to describ it see that bad as wa my case there were wors on
befor me of which i shall have to tell in their season
at length the night wore awai and the dawn broke upon the desol sea
present the sun came up for which at first we were thank for we
were chill to the bone but soon it heat grew intoler sinc we
had neither food nor water in the boat and alreadi we were parch with
thirst but now the wind had fallen to a steadi breez and with the
help of the oar and a blanket we contriv to fashion a sail that drew
us through the water at a good speed but the ocean wa vast and we
did not know whither we were sail and everi hour the agoni of thirst
press us more close toward middai a child di suddenli and wa
thrown into the sea and some three hour later the mother fill a
bail bowl and drank deep of the bitter water for a while it seem
to assuag her thirst then suddenli a mad took her and spring
up she cast herself overboard and sank befor the sun glow like a
redhot ball had sunk beneath the horizon the priest and i were the
onli on in that compani who could sit uprightth rest lai upon the
bottom of the boat heap on on anoth like dy fish groan in
their miseri night fell at last and brought us some relief from our
suffer for the air grew cooler but the rain we prai for did
not fall and so great wa the heat that when the sun rose again in a
cloudless sky we knew if no help reach us that it must be the last
which we should see
an hour after dawn anoth child di and as we were in the act of
cast the bodi into the sea i look up and saw a vessel far awai
that seem to be sail in such fashion that she would pass within two
mile of where we were return thank to god for thi most bless
sight we took to the oar for the wind wa now so light that our
clumsi sail would no longer draw us through the water and row feebli
so as to cut the path of the ship when we had labour for more than an
hour the wind fell altogeth and the vessel lai becalm at a distanc
of about three mile so the priest and i row on till i thought that
we must die in the boat for the heat of the sun wa like that of a
flame and there came no wind to temper it by now too our lip were
crack with thirst still we struggl on till the shadow of the ship
mast fell athwart us and we saw her sailor watch us from the deck
now we were alongsid and thei let down a ladder of rope speak to us
in spanish
how we reach the deck i cannot sai but i rememb fall beneath
the shade of an awn and drink cup after cup of the water that wa
brought to me at last even my thirst wa satisfi and for a while i
grew faint and dizzi and had no stomach for the meat which wa thrust
into my hand inde i think that i must have faint for when i came
to myself the sun wa straight overhead and it seem to me that i had
dream i heard a familiar and hate voic at the time i wa alon
beneath the awn for the crew of the ship were gather on the
foredeck cluster round what appear to be the bodi of a man by my
side wa a larg plate of victual and a flask of spirit and feel
stronger i at and drank of them heartili i had scarc finish my
meal when the men on the foredeck lift the bodi of the man which i
saw wa black in colour and cast it overboard then three of them whom
from their port i took to be offic came toward me and i rose to my
feet to meet them
senor said the tallest of them in a soft and gentl voic suffer
me to offer you our felicit on your wonder and he stop
suddenli
did i still dream or did i know the voic now for the first time i
could see the man faceit wa that of juan de garcia but if i knew
him he also knew me
caramba he said whom have we here senor thoma wingfield i salut

to us he is no spaniard but an english spy the last time that i saw
him wa in the street of sevil and there he tri to murder me
becaus i threaten to reveal hi trade to the author now he is
here upon what errand he know best
it is fals i answer i am no spy and i am come to these sea for
on purpos onlyto find you

sai now do you deni that you ar thoma wingfield and an englishman
i do not deni it i

me you sail in la cinqu llaga under the name of daila
for my own reason juan de garcia

bear me wit onc i knew a cavali of the name of de garcia but he
is dead

across the mouth
gentli friend said de garcia do not defil your hand by strike
such rat as thi or if you must strike us a stick you have
heard that he confess to pass under a fals name and to be an
englishman and therefor on of our countri foe to thi i add
upon my word of honour that to my knowledg he is a spy and a wouldb
murder now gentlemen under the commiss of hi majesti
repres we ar judg here but sinc you mai think that have
been call a liar openli by thi english dog i might be mind to deal
unjustli with him i prefer to leav the matter in your hand
now i tri to speak onc more but the spaniard who had struck me a
ferociouslook villain drew hi sword and swore that he would run me
through if i dare to open my lip so i thought it well to keep silent
thi englishman would grace a yardarm veri well he said
de garcia who had begun to hum a tune indiffer smile look
first at the yard and then at my neck and the hate in hi ey seem
to burn me
i have a better thought than that said the third offic if we hung
him question might be ask and at the least it would be a wast of
good monei he is a fine built young man and would last some year in
the mine let him be sold with the rest of the cargo or i will take
him myself at a valuat i am in want of a few such on my estat
at these word i saw de garcia face fall a littl for he wish to
be rid of me for ever still he did not think it polit to interfer
beyond sai with a slight yawn
so far as i am concern take him comrad and free of cost onli i
warn you watch him well or you will find a stiletto in your back
the offic laugh and said our friend will scarc get a chanc at
me for i do not go a hundr pace underground where he will find hi
quarter and now englishman there is room for you below i think
and he call to a sailor bid him bring the iron of the man who had
di
thi wa done and after i had been search and a small sum in gold
that i had upon my person taken from meit wa all that remain to me
of my possessionsfett were place upon my ankl and round my neck
and i wa drag into the hold befor i reach it i knew from
variou sign what wa the cargo of thi ship she wa laden with slave
captur in fernandina as the spaniard name the island of cuba that
were to be sold in hispaniola among these slave i wa now number
how to tell the horror of that hold i know not the place wa low not
more than seven feet in height and the slave lai iron in the bilg
water on the bottom of the vessel thei were crowd as thick as thei
could lie be chain to ring fix in the side of the ship
altogeth there mai have been two hundr of them men women and
children or rather there had been two hundr when the ship sail a
week befor now some twenti were dead which wa a small number sinc
the spaniard reckon to lose from a third to half of their cargo in thi
devilish traffic when i enter the place a deadli sick seiz me
weak as i wa brought on by the horribl sound and smell and the
sight that i saw in the flare of the lantern which my conductor
carri for the hold wa shut off from light and air but thei drag
me along and present i found myself chain in the midst of a line
of black men and women mani feet rest in the bilg water there the
spaniard left me with a jeer sai that thi wa too good a bed
for an englishman to lie on for a while i endur then sleep or
insens came to my succour and i sank into oblivion and so i
must have remain for a dai and a night
when i awok it wa to find the spaniard to whom i had been sold or
given stand near me with a lantern and direct the remov of the
fetter from a woman who wa chain next to me she wa dead and in
the light of the lantern i could see that she had been carri off by
some horribl diseas that wa new to me but which i afterward learn
to know by the name of the black vomit nor wa she the onli on for i
count twenti dead who were drag out in success and i could
see that mani more were sick also i saw that the spaniard were not
a littl frighten for thei could make noth of thi sick and
strove to lessen it by cleans the hold and let air into it by
the remov of some plank in the deck abov had thei not done thi i
believ that everi soul of us must have perish and i set down my own
escap from the sick to the fact that the largest open in the
deck wa made directli abov my head so that by stand up which my
chain allow me to do i could breath air that wa almost pure
have distribut water and meal cake the spaniard went awai i
drank greedili of the water but the cake i could not eat for thei
were mouldi the sight and sound around me were so aw that i will
not try to write of them
and all the while we swelter in the terribl heat for the sun pierc
through the deck plank of the vessel and i could feel by her lack of
motion that we were becalm and drift i stood up and by rest
my heel upon a rib of the ship and my back against her side i found
myself in a posit whenc i could see the feet of the passersbi on
the deck abov
present i saw that on of these wore a priest robe and guess
that he must be my companion with whom i had escap i strove to
attract hi notic and at length succeed so soon as he knew who
it wa beneath him the priest lai down on the deck as though to rest
himself and we spoke togeth he told me as i had guess that we
were becalm and that a great sick had taken hold of the ship
alreadi lai low a third of the crew ad that it wa a judgment
from heaven becaus of their cruelti and wicked
to thi i answer that the judgment wa work on the captiv as well
as on the captor and ask him where wa sarceda as thei name de
garcia then i learn that he had been taken sick that morn and i
rejoic at the new for if i had hate him befor it mai be judg
how deepli i hate him now present the priest left me and return
with water mix with the juic of lime that tast to me like nectar
from the god and some good meat and fruit these he gave me through
the hole in the plank and i made shift to seiz them in my manacl
hand and devour them after thi he went awai to my great chagrin
why i did not discov till the follow morn
that dai pass and the long night pass and when at length the
spaniard visit the hold onc more there were forti bodi to be
drag out of it and mani other were sick after thei had gone i
stood up watch for my friend the priest but he did not come then
nor ever again
chapter xii
thoma come to shore
for an hour or more i stood thu crane my neck upward to seek for
the priest at length when i wa about to sink back into the hold for
i could stand no longer in that cramp postur i saw a woman dress
pass by the hole in the deck and knew it for on that wa worn by a
ladi who had escap with me in the boat
senora i whisper for the love of god listen to me it is i
daila who am chain down here among the slave
she start then as the priest had done she sat herself down upon the
deck and i told her of my dread plight not know that she wa
acquaint with it and of the horror below
ala senor she answer thei can be littl wors than those abov
a dread sick is rage among the crew six ar alreadi dead and
mani more ar rave in their last mad i would that the sea had
swallow us with the rest for we have been rescu from it onli to
fall into hell alreadi my mother is dead and my littl brother is
dy
where is the priest i ask
he di thi morn and ha just been cast into the sea befor he
di he spoke of you and prai me to help you if i could but hi
word were wild and i thought that he might be distraught and inde
how can i help you
perhap you can find me food and drink i answer and for our
friend god rest hi soul what of the captain sarceda is he also
dead
no senor he alon is recov of all whom the scourg ha smitten
and now i must go to my brother but first i will seek food for you
she went and present return with meat and a flask of wine which she
had hidden beneath her dress and i at and bless her
for two dai she fed me thu bring me food at night on the second
night she told me that her brother wa dead and of all the crew onli
fifteen men and on offic remain untouch by the sick and that
she herself grew ill also she said that the water wa almost finish
and there wa littl food left for the slave after thi she came no
more and i suppos that she di also
it wa within twenti hour of her last visit that i left thi accurs
ship for a dai none had come to feed or tend the slave and inde
mani need no tend for thei were dead some still live howev
though so far as i could see the most of them were smitten with the
plagu i myself had escap the sick perhap becaus of the
strength and natur healthi of my bodi which ha alwai save me
from fever and diseas fortifi as it wa by the good food that i
had obtain but now i knew that i could not live long inde chain
in thi dread charnelhous i prai for death to releas me from the
horror of such exist the dai pass as befor in swelter heat
unbroken by ani air or motion and night came at last made hideou by
the barbar rave of the dy but even there and then i slept and
dream that i wa walk with my love in the vale of wavenei
toward the morn i wa awaken by a sound of clank iron and
open my ey i saw that men were at work by the light of lantern
knock the fetter from the dead and the live togeth as the
fetter were loos a rope wa put round the bodi of the slave and dead
or quick he wa haul through the hatchwai present a heavi splash
in the water without told the rest of the tale now i understood that
all the slave were be thrown overboard becaus of the want of water
and in the hope that it might avail to save from the pestil those of
the spaniard who still remain aliv
i watch them at their work for a while till there were but two slave
between me and the worker of whom on wa live and the other dead
then i bethought me that thi would be my fate also to be cast quick
into the sea and took counsel with myself as to whether i should
declar that i wa whole from the plagu and prai them to spare me or
whether i should suffer myself to be drown the desir for life wa
strong but perhap it mai serv to show how great were the torment
from which i wa suffer and how broken wa my spirit by misfortun
and the horror around me when i sai that i determin to make no
further effort to live but rather to accept death as a merci
releas and inde i knew that there wa littl likelihood of such
attempt be of avail for i saw that the spanish sailor were mad
with fear and had but on desir to be rid of the slave who consum
the water and as thei believ had bred the pestil so i said such
prayer as came into my head and although with a great shiver of
fear for the poor flesh shrink from it end and the unknown beyond it
howev high mai be the spirit i prepar myself to die
now have drag awai my neighbour in miseri the live savag the
men turn to me thei were nake to the middl and work furious
to be done with their hate task sweat with the heat and keep
themselv from faint by draught of spirit
thi on is aliv also and doe not seem so sick said a man as he
struck the fetter from me
aliv or dead awai with the dog answer anoth hoars and i saw
that it wa the same offic to whom i had been given as a slave it
is that englishman and he it is who brought us ill luck cast the jonah
overboard and let him try hi evil ey upon the shark
so be it answer the other man and finish strike off my
fetter those who have come to a cup of water each a dai do not press
their guest to share it thei show them the door sai your prayer
englishman and mai thei do you more good than thei have done for most
on thi accurs ship here thi is the stuff to make drown easi
and there is more of it on board than of water and he hand me the
flask of spirit i took it and drank deep and it comfort me a littl
then thei put the rope round me and at a signal those on the deck abov
began to haul till i swung loos beneath the hatchwai as i pass
that spaniard to whom i had been given in slaveri and who but now had
counsel my cast awai i saw hi face well in the light of the
lantern and there were sign on it that a physician could read clearli
farewel i said to him we mai soon meet again fool why do you
labour take your rest for the plagu is on you in six hour you will
be dead
hi jaw drop with terror at my word and for a moment he stood
speechless then he utter a fear oath and aim a blow at me with
the hammer he held which would swiftli have put an end to my suffer
had i not at that moment been lift from hi reach by those who pull
abov
in anoth second i had fallen on the deck as thei slack the rope
near me stood two black men whose offic it wa to cast us poor wretch
into the sea and behind them seat in a chair hi face haggard from
recent ill sat de garcia fan himself with hi sombrero for the
night wa veri hot
he recognis me at onc in the moonlight which wa brilliant and
said what ar you here and still aliv cousin you ar tough inde
i thought that you must be dead or dy inde had it not been for
thi accurs plagu i would have seen to it myself well it ha come
right at last and here is the onli lucki thing in all thi voyag that
i shall have the pleasur of send you to the shark it consol
me for much friend wingfield so you came across the sea to seek
vengeanc on me well i hope that your stai ha been pleasant the
accommod wa a littl poor but at least the welcom wa hearti
and now it is time to speed the part guest good night thoma
wingfield if you should chanc to meet your mother present tell her
from me that i wa griev to have to kill her for she is the on be
whom i have love i did not come to murder her as you mai have thought
but she forc me to it to save myself sinc had i not done so i
should never have live to return to spain she had too much of my own
blood to suffer me to escap and it seem that it run strong in your
vein also els you would scarc hold so fast by vengeanc well it
ha not prosper you and he drop back into the chair and fell to
fan himself again with the broad hat
even then as i stood upon the ev of death i felt my blood run hot
within me at the sting of hi coars taunt truli de garcia triumph
wa complet i had come to hunt him down and what wa the end of it
he wa about to hurl me to the shark still i answer him with such
digniti as i could command
you have me at some disadvantag i said now if there is ani manhood
left in you give me a sword and let us settl our quarrel onc and for
all you ar weak from sick i know but what am i who have spent
certain dai and night in thi hell of your we should be well
match de garcia
perhap so cousin but where is the need to be frank thing have not
gone over well with me when we stood face to face befor and it is odd
but do you know i have been troubl with a forebod that you would
be the end of me that is on of the reason why i sought a chang
of air to these warmer region but see the folli of forebod my
friend i am still aliv though i have been ill and i mean to go on
live but you areforg me for mention ityou ar alreadi dead
inde those gentlemen and he point to the two black men who
were take advantag of our talk to throw into the sea the slave

convers have you ani messag that i can deliv for you if
so out with it for time is short and that hold must be clear by
daybreak

is not yet plai your fear mai still come true i am dead but my
vengeanc mai yet live on for i leav it to the hand in which i should
have left it at first you mai live some year longer but do you think
that you shall escap on dai you will die as sure as i must die
tonight and what then de garcia

been consecr priest you had a messag you said prai deliv it
quickli time press cousin wingfield who send messag to an exil
like myself

abandon i said
he start from hi chair and stood over me
what of her he whisper fierc

wall her up aliv mother of god how do you know that
i chanc to see it done that is all she prai me to tell you of
her end and the child and that she di hide your name love and
forgiv thi wa all her messag but i will add to it mai she haunt
you for ever she and my mother mai thei haunt you through life and
death through earth and hell
he cover hi face with hi hand for a moment then drop them sank
back into the chair and call to the black sailor
awai with thi slave why ar you so slow
the men advanc upon me but i wa not mind to be handl by them if
i could help it and i wa mind to caus de garcia to share my fate
suddenli i bound at him and grip him round the middl i drag
him from hi chair such wa the strength that rage and despair gave to
me that i succeed in swing him up to the level of the bulwark but
there the matter end for at that moment the two black sailor sprang
upon us both and tore him from my grip then see that all wa lost
for thei were about to cut me down with their sword i place my hand
upon the bulwark and leap into the sea
my reason told me that i should do well to drown as quickli as possibl
and i thought to myself that i would not try to swim but would sink at
onc yet love of life wa too strong for me and so soon as i touch
the water i struck out and began to swim along the side of the ship
keep myself in her shadow for i fear lest de garcia should caus
me to be shot at with arrow and musket ball present as i went i
heard him sai with an oath
he ha gone and for good thi time but my forebod went near to
come true after all bah how the sight of that man frighten me
now i knew in my heart that i wa do a mad thing for though if no
shark took me i might float for six or eight hour in thi warm water
yet i must sink at last and what would my struggl have profit me
still i swam on slowli and after the filth and stench of the slave
hold the touch of the clean water and the breath of the pure air were
like food and wine to me and i felt strength enter into me as i went
by thi time i wa a hundr yard or more from the ship and though
those on board could scarc have seen me i could still hear the
splash of the bodi as the slave were flung from her and the
drown cri of such among them as still live
i lift my head and look round the wast of water and see
someth float on it at a distanc i swam toward it expect
that everi moment would be my last becaus of the shark which abound
in these sea soon i wa near it and to my joi i perceiv that it wa
a larg barrel which had been thrown from the ship and wa float
upright in the water i reach it and push at it from below
contriv to tilt it so that i caught it upper edg with my hand then
i saw that it wa half full of meal cake and that it had been cast
awai becaus the meal wa stink it wa the weight of these rotten
cake act as ballast that caus the tub to float upright in the
water now i bethought me that if i could get into thi barrel i should
be safe from the shark for a while but how to do it i did not know
while i wonder chanc to glanc behind me i saw the fin of a shark
stand abov the water not twenti pace awai and advanc rapidli
toward me then terror seiz me and gave me strength and the wit of
despair pull down the edg of the barrel till the water began to
pour into it i seiz it on either side with my hand and lift my
weight upon them i doubl my knee to thi hour i cannot tell how i
accomplish it but the next second i wa in the cask with no other
hurt than a scrape shin but though i had found a boat the boat itself
wa like to sink for what with my weight and that of the rotten meal
and of the water which had pour over the rim the edg of the barrel
wa not now an inch abov the level of the sea and i knew that did
anoth bucket come aboard it would no longer bear me at that
moment also i saw the fin of the shark within four yard and then felt
the barrel shake as the fish struck it with hi nose
now i began to bail furious with my hand and as i bail the edg
of the cask lift itself abov the water when it had risen some
two inch the shark enrag at my escap came to the surfac and
turn on it side bit at the tub so that i heard it teeth grate
on the wood and iron band caus it to heel over and to spin round
ship more water as it heel now i must bail afresh and had the
fish renew it onset i should have been lost but not find wood
and iron to it tast it went awai for a while although i saw it fin
from time to time for the space of some hour i bail with my hand
till i could lift the water no longer then make shift to take off my
boot i bail with that soon the edg of the cask stood twelv inch
abov the water and i did not lighten it further fear lest it
should overturn now i had time to rest and to rememb that all thi
wa of no avail sinc i must die at last either by the sea or becaus
of thirst and i lament that my cowardic had onli suffic to prolong
my suffer
then i prai to god to succour me and never did i prai more heartili
than in that hour and when i had finish prai some sort of peac
and hope fell upon me i thought it marvel that i should thu have
escap thrice from great peril within the space of a few dai first
from the sink carak then from pestil and starvat in the bold
of the slaveship and now if onli for a while from the cruel jaw of
the shark it seem to me that i had not been preserv from danger
which prove fatal to so mani onli that i might perish miser at
last and even in my despair i began to hope when hope wa folli though
whether thi relief wa sent to me from abov or whether it wa simpli
that be so much aliv at the moment i could not believ that i should
soon be dead is not for me to sai
at the least my courag rose again and i could even find heart to note
the beauti of the night the sea wa smooth as a pond there wa no
breath of wind and now that the moon began to sink thousand of star
of a marvel bright such as we do not see in england gem the
heaven everywher at last these grew pale and dawn began to flush the
east and after it came the first rai of sunlight but now i could not
see fifti yard around me becaus of a dens mist that gather on the
face of the quiet water and hung there for an hour or more when the
sun wa well up and at length the mist clear awai i perceiv that i
had drift far from the ship of which i could onli see the mast that
grew ever fainter till thei vanish now the surfac of the sea wa
clear of fog except in on direct where it hung in a thick bank of
vapour though why it should rest there and nowher els i could not
understand
then the sun grew hot and my suffer commenc for except the
draught of spirit that had been given me in the hold of the slaveship
i had touch no drink for a dai and a night i will not tell them
all in particular detail it is enough to sai that those can scarc
imagin them who have never stood for hour after hour in a barrel
barehead and parch with thirst while the fierc heat of a tropic
sun beat down on them from abov and wa reflect upward from the
glassi surfac of the water in time inde i grew faint and dizzi
and could hardli save myself from fall into the sea and at last i
sank into a sort of sleep or insens from which i wa awaken by
a sound of scream bird and of fall water i look and saw to
my wonder and delight that what i had taken to be a bank of mist wa
realli lowli land and that i wa drift rapidli with the tide
toward the bar of a larg river the sound of bird came from great
flock of seagul that were prei on the shoal of fish which fed
at the meet of the fresh and salt water present as i watch a
gull seiz a fish that could not have weigh less than three pound
and strove to lift it from the sea fail in thi it beat the fish on
the head with it beak till it di and had begun to devour it when i
drift down upon the spot and made hast to seiz the fish in anoth
moment dread as it mai seem i wa devour the food raw and never
have i eaten with better appetit or found more refresh in a meal
when i had swallow all that i wa abl without drink water i put
the rest of the fish into the pocket of my coat and turn my thought
to the breaker on the bar soon it wa evid to me that i could not
pass them stand in my barrel so i hasten to upset myself into the
water and to climb astrid of it present we were in the surf and i
had much ado to cling on but the tide bore me forward brave and in
half an hour more the breaker were past and i wa in the mouth of the
great river now fortun favour me still further for i found a piec
of wood float on the stream which serv me for a paddl and by it
help i wa enabl to steer my craft toward the shore that as i went i
perceiv to be cloth with thick reed in which tall and love tree
grew in group bear cluster of larg nut in their crown hither
to thi shore i came without further accid have spent some ten
hour in my tub though it wa but a chanc that i did so becaus of
the horribl reptil call crocodil or by some allig with
which thi river swarm but of them i knew noth as yet
i reach land but just in time for befor i wa ashor the tide
turn and tide and current began to carri me out to sea again whenc
assuredli i had never come back inde for the last ten minut it
took all the strength that i had to forc the barrel along toward the
bank at length howev i perceiv that it float in not more than
four feet of water and slide from it i wade to the bank and cast
myself at length there to rest and thank god who thu far had preserv
me miracul but my thirst which now return upon me more fierc
than ever would not suffer me to lie thu for long so i stagger to
my feet and walk along the bank of the river till i came to a pool of
rain water which on the tast prove to be sweet and good then i
drank weep for joi at the tast of the water drank till i could
drink no more and let those who have stood in such a plight rememb
what water wa to them for no word of mine can tell it after i
had drunk and wash the brine from my face and bodi i drew out the
remaind of my fish and at it thankfulli and thu refresh cast
myself down to sleep in the shade of a bush bear white flower for i
wa utterli outworn
when i open my ey again it wa night and doubtless i should have
slept on through mani hour more had it not been for a dread itch and
pain that took me in everi part till at length i sprang up and curs
in my agoni at first i wa at a loss to know what occas thi
torment till i perceiv that the air wa aliv with gnatlik insect
which made a sing nois and then settl on my flesh suck blood
and spat poison into the wound at on and the same time these dread
insect the spaniard name mosquito nor were thei the onli fli for
hundr of other creatur no bigger than a pin head had fasten

were also too numer to mention and of everi shape and size though
thei had thi in common all bit and all were venom befor the
morn these plagu had driven me almost to mad for in no wai
could i obtain relief from them toward dawn i went and lai in the
water think to lessen my suffer but befor i had been there ten
minut i saw a huge crocodil rise up from the mud besid me i sprang
awai to the bank horribl afraid for never befor had i beheld so
monstrou and evillook a brute to fall again into the clutch of

at length the morn broke and found me in a sorri plight for my face
wa swollen to the size of a pumpkin by the venom of the mosquito and
the rest of my bodi wa in littl better case moreov i could not
keep myself still becaus of the itch but must run and jump like a
madman and where wa i to run to through thi huge swamp in which i
could see no shelter or sign of man i could not guess so sinc i must
keep move i follow the bank of the river as i walk disturb
mani crocodil and loathsom snake now i knew that i could not live
long in such suffer and determin to struggl forward till i fell
down insens and death put an end to my torment
for an hour or more i went on thu till i came to a place that wa clear
of bush and reed across thi i skip and danc strike with my
swollen hand at the gnat which buzz about my head now the end wa
not far off for i wa exhaust and near to fall when suddenli
i came upon a parti of men brown in colour and cloth with white
garment who had been fish in the river by them on the water were
sever cano in which were load of merchandis and thei were now
engag in eat so soon as these men caught sight of me thei utter
exclam in an unknown tongu and seiz weapon that lai by them
bow and arrow and wooden club set on either side with spike of
flinti glass thei made toward me as though to kill me now i lift up
my hand prai for merci and see that i wa unarm and helpless
the men laid down their arm and address me i shook my head to show
that i could not understand and point first to the sea and then to
my swollen featur thei nod and go to on of the cano a man
brought from it a past of a brown colour and aromat smell then by
sign he direct me to remov such garment as remain on me the
fashion of which seem to puzzl them greatli thi be done thei

foam froth that i learn to know afterward as chocol when i
had finish eat have talk a while togeth in low tone thei
motion me to enter on of the cano give me mat to lie on i
obei and three other men came with me for the cano wa larg on
of these a veri grave man with a gentl face and manner whom i took
to be the chief of the parti sat down opposit to me the other two
place themselv in the bow and stern of the boat which thei drove
along by mean of paddl then we start follow by three other
cano and befor we had gone a mile utter weari overpow me and
i fell asleep
i awok much refresh have slept mani hour for now the sun wa
set and wa astonish to find the gravelook man my companion
in the cano keep watch over my sleep and ward the gnat from me
with a leafi branch hi kind seem to show that i wa in no danger
of illtreat and my fear on that point be set at rest i began
to wonder as to what strang land i had come and who it peopl might
be soon howev i gave over have noth to build on and observ
the sceneri instead now we were paddl up a smaller river than the
on on the bank of which i had been cast awai and were no longer in
the midst of marsh on either side of us wa open land or rather land
that would have been open had it not been for the great tree larger
than the largest oak which grew upon it some of them of surpass
beauti up these tree climb creeper that hung like rope even
from the topmost bough and among them were mani strang and gorgeou
flower plant that seem to cling to the bark as moss cling to
a wall in their branch also sat harshvoic bird of brilliant
colour and ap that bark and chatter at us as we went
just as the sun set over all thi strang new scene the cano came to
a land place built of timber and we disembark now it grew dark
suddenli and all i could discov wa that i wa be led along a good
road present we reach a gate which from the bark of dog and
the number of peopl who throng about it i judg to be the entranc
to a town and pass it we advanc down a long street with hous on
either side at the doorwai of the last hous my companion halt and
take me by the hand led me into a long low room lit with lamp of
earthenwar here some women came forward and kiss him while other
whom i took to be servant salut him by touch the floor with on
hand soon howev all ey were turn on me and mani eager question
were ask of the chief of which i could onli guess the purport
when all had gaze their fill supper wa serv a rich meal of mani
strang meat and of thi i wa invit to partak which i did seat
on a mat and eat of the dish that were place upon the ground by
the women among these i notic on girl who far surpass all the
other in grace though none were unpleas to the ey she wa dark
inde but her featur were regular and her ey fine her figur wa
tall and straight and the sweet of her face ad to the charm of
her beauti i mention thi girl here for two reason first becaus she
save me onc from sacrific and onc from tortur and secondli becaus
she wa none other than that woman who afterward becam known as
marina the mistress of cort without whose aid he had never conquer
mexico but at thi time she did not guess that it wa her destini to
bring her countri of anahuac beneath the cruel yoke of the spaniard
from the moment of my entri i saw that marina as i will call her
for her indian name is too long to be written took piti on my forlorn
state and did what lai in her power to protect me from vulgar curios
and to minist to my want it wa she who brought me water to wash in
and a clean robe of linen to replac my foul and tatter garment and
a cloak fashion of bright feather for my shoulder
when supper wa done a mat wa given me to sleep on in a littl room
apart and here i lai down think that though i might be lost for
ever to my own world at least i had fallen among a peopl who were
gentl and kindli and moreov as i saw from mani token no savag
on thing howev disturb me i discov that though i wa well
treat also i wa a prison for a man arm with a copper spear
slept across the doorwai of my littl room befor i lai down i look
through the wooden bar which serv as a protect to the window
place and saw that the hous stood upon the border of a larg open
space in the midst of which a great pyramid tower a hundr feet or
more into the air on the top of thi pyramid wa a build of stone
that i took to be a templ and rightli in front of which a fire
burn marvel what the purpos of thi great work might be and in
honour of what faith it wa erect i went to sleep
on the morrow i wa to learn
here it mai be conveni for me to state what i did not discov till
afterward that i wa in the citi of tobasco the capit of on of the
southern provinc of anahuac which is situat at a distanc of some
hundr of mile from the central citi of tenoctitlan or mexico the
river where i had been cast awai wa the rio de tobasco where cort
land in the follow year and my host or rather my captor wa the
caciqu or chief of tobasco the same man who subsequ present
marina to cort thu it came about that with the except of a
certain aguilar who with some companion wa wreck on the coast of
yucatan six year befor i wa the first white man who ever dwelt among
the indian thi aguilar wa rescu by cort though hi companion
were all sacrif to huitzel the horribl wargod of the countri but
the name of the spaniard wa alreadi known to the indian who look
on them with superstiti fear for in the year previou to my be
cast awai the hidalgo hernandez de cordova had visit the coast of
yucatan and fought sever battl with the nativ and earlier in the
same year of my arriv juan de grigalva had come to thi veri river of
tobasco thu it came about that i wa set down as on of thi strang
new nation of teul as the indian name the spaniard and therefor
as an enemi for whose blood the god were thirst
i awok at dawn much refresh with sleep and have wash and cloth
myself in the linen robe that were provid for me i came into the
larg room where food wa given me scarc had i finish my meal
when my captor the caciqu enter accompani by two men whose
appear struck terror to my heart in counten thei were fierc
and horribl thei wore black robe embroid with mystic charact
in red and their long and tangl hair wa mat togeth with some
strang substanc these men whom all present includ the chief or
caciqu seem to look on with the utmost rever glare at me with
a fierc glee that made my blood run cold on of them inde tore
open my white robe and place hi filthi hand upon my heart which beat
quickli enough count it throb aloud while the other nod at hi
word afterward i learn that he wa sai that i wa veri strong
glanc round to find the interpret of thi act upon the face of
those about me my ey caught those of the girl marina and there wa
that in them which left me in littl doubt horror and piti were written
there and i knew that some dread death overshadow me befor
i could do anyth befor i could even think i wa seiz by the
priest or paba as the indian name them and drag from the room
all the household follow us except marina and the caciqu now i
found myself in a great squar or market place border by mani fine
hous of stone and lime and some of mud which wa fill rapidli
with a vast number of peopl men women and children who all stare at
me as i went toward the pyramid on the top of which the fire burn at
the foot of thi pyramid i wa led into a littl chamber hollow in it
thick and here my dress wa torn from me by more priest leav
me nake except for a cloth about my loin and a chaplet of bright
flower which wa set upon my head in thi chamber were three other
men indian who from the horror on their face i judg to be also
doom to death
present a drum began to beat high abov us and we were taken from the
chamber and place in a process of mani priest i be the first
among the victim then the priest set up a chant and we began the
ascent of the pyramid follow a road that wound round and round it
bulk till it end on a platform at it summit which mai have measur
forti pace in the squar henc the view of the surround countri wa
veri fine but in that hour i scarc notic it have no care for
prospect howev pleas on the further side of the platform were
two wooden tower fifti feet or so in height these were the templ of
the god huitzel god of war and quetzal god of the air whose hideou
effigi carv in stone grin at us through the open doorwai in
the chamber of these templ stood small altar and on the altar
were larg dish of gold contain the heart of those who had been
sacrif on the yesterdai these chamber moreov were encrust
with everi sort of filth in front of the templ stood the altar
whereon the fire burn etern and befor it were a hogback block
of black marbl of the size of an inn drink tabl and a great carven
stone shape like a wheel measur some ten feet across with a copper
ring in it centr
all these thing i rememb afterward though at the time i scarc
seem to see them for hardli were we arriv on the platform when i
wa seiz and drag to the wheelshap stone here a hide girdl
wa put round my waist and secur to the ring by a rope long enough
to enabl me to run to the edg of the stone and no further then a
flintpoint spear wa given to me and spear were given also to the
two captiv who accompani me and it wa made clear to me by sign
that i must fight with them it be their part to leap upon the stone
and mine to defend it now i thought that if i could kill these two poor
creatur perhap i myself should be allow to go free and so to save
my life i prepar to take their if i could present the head priest
gave a signal command the two men to attack me but thei were so lost
in fear that thei did not even stir then the priest began to flog them
with leather girdl till at length cry out with pain thei ran at
me on reach the stone and leapt upon it a littl befor the other
and i struck the spear through hi arm instantli he drop hi weapon
and fled and the other man fled also for there wa no fight in them
nor would ani flog bring them to face me again
see that thei could not make them brave the priest determin to
have done with them amidst a great nois of music and chant he whom
i had smitten wa seiz and drag to the hogback block of marbl
which in truth wa a stone of sacrific on thi he wa cast down
breast upward and held so by five priest two grip hi hand
two hi leg and on hi head then have don a scarlet cloak
the head priest that same who had felt my heart utter some kind of
prayer and rais a curv knife of the flintlik glass or itztli
struck open the poor wretch breast at a singl blow and made the
ancient offer to the sun
as he did thi all the multitud in the place below in full view of
whom thi bloodi game wa plai prostrat themselv remain on
their knee till the offer had been thrown into the golden censer
befor the statu of the god huitzel thereon the horribl priest
cast themselv on the bodi carri it with shout to the edg of
the pyramid or teocal and roll it down the steep side at the
foot of the slope it wa lift and born awai by certain men who were
wait for what purpos i did not know at that time
scarc wa the first victim dead when the second wa seiz and
treat in a like fashion the multitud prostrat themselv as
befor and then last of all came my turn i felt myself seiz and my
sens swam nor did i recov them till i found myself ly on the
accurs stone the priest drag at my limb and head my breast
strain upward till the skin wa stretch tight as that of a drum
while over me stood the human devil in hi red mantl the glass knife
in hi hand never shall i forget hi wick face madden with the lust
for blood or the glare in hi ey as he toss back hi mat lock
but he did not strike at onc he gloat over me prick me with the
point of the knife it seem to me that i lai there for year while the
paba aim and point with the knife but at last through a mist that
gather befor my ey i saw it flash upward then when i thought that
my hour had come a hand caught hi arm in midair and held it and i
heard a voic whisper
what wa said did not pleas the priest for suddenli he howl aloud
and made a dash toward me to kill me but again hi arm wa caught
befor the knife fell then he withdrew into the templ of the god
quetzal and for a long while i lai upon the stone suffer the agoni
of a hundr death for i believ that it wa determin to tortur me
befor i di and that my slaughter had been stai for thi purpos
there i lai upon the stone the fierc sunlight beat on my breast
while from below came the faint murmur of the thousand of the wonder
peopl all my life seem to pass befor me as i wa stretch upon
that aw bed a hundr littl thing which i had forgotten came back
to me and with them memori of childhood of my oath to my father of
lili farewel kiss and word of de garcia face as i wa hurl into
the sea of the death of isabella de siguenza and lastli a vagu wonder
as to why all priest were so cruel
at length i heard footstep and shut my ey for i could bear the sight
of that dread knife no longer but behold no knife fell suddenli my
hand were loos and i wa lift to my feet on which i never hope to
stand again then i wa born to the edg of the teocal for i could
not walk and here my wouldb murder the priest have first
shout some word to the spectat below that caus them to murmur
like a forest when the wind stir it clasp me in hi bloodstain
arm and kiss me on the forehead now it wa for the first time that
i notic my captor the caciqu stand at my side grave courteou
and smile as he had smile when he hand me to the paba so he
smile when he took me back from them then have been cleans and
cloth i wa led into the sanctuari of the god quetzal and stood face
to face with the hideou imag there stare at the golden censer that
wa to have receiv my heart while the priest utter prayer thenc
i wa support down the wind road of the pyramid till i came to it
foot where my captor the caciqu took me by the hand and led me through
the peopl who it seem now regard me with some strang vener
the first person that i saw when we reach the hous wa marina who
look at me and murmur some soft word that i could not understand
then i wa suffer to go to my chamber and there i pass the rest of
the dai prostrat by all that i had undergon truli i had come to a
land of devil
and now i will tell how it wa that i came to be save from the knife
marina have taken some like to me piti my sad fate and be
veri quickwit she found a wai to rescu me for when i had been led
off to sacrific she spoke to the caciqu her lord bring it to
hi mind that by common report montezuma the emperor of anahuac wa
disturb as to the teul or spaniard and desir much to see on
now she said i wa evid a teul and montezuma would be anger
inde if i were sacrif in a faroff town instead of be sent
to him to sacrific if he saw fit to thi the caciqu answer that the
word were wise but that she should have spoken them befor for now
the priest had got hold of me and it wa hopeless to save me from
their grip
nai answer marina there is thi to be said quetzal the god
to whom thi teul is to be offer wa a white man and it mai well
happen that thi man is on of hi children will it pleas the god
that hi child should be offer to him at the least if the god is not
anger montezuma will certainli be wroth and wreak a vengeanc on you
and on the priest
quetzal or more properli quetzalcoatl wa the divin
who is fabl to have taught the nativ of anahuac all the
us art includ those of govern and polici he
wa whiteskin and darkhair final he sail from
the shore of anahuac for the fabul countri of tlapallan
in a bark of serpent skin but befor he sail he
promis that he would return again with a numer progeni
thi promis wa rememb by the aztec and it wa

now when the caciqu heard thi he saw that marina spoke truth and
hurri up the teocal he caught the knife as it wa in the act of
fall upon me at first the head priest wa anger and call out
that thi wa sacrileg but when the caciqu had told him hi mind
he understood that he would do wise not to run a risk of the wrath of
montezuma so i wa loos and led into the sanctuari and when i came
out the paba announc to the peopl that the god had declar me to be
on of hi children and it wa for thi reason that then and thereaft
thei treat me with rever
chapter xiv
the save of guatemoc
now after thi dread dai i wa kindli dealt with by the peopl of
tobasco who gave me the name of teul or spaniard and no longer sought
to put me to sacrific far from it inde i wa well cloth and fed
and suffer to wander where i would though alwai under the care of
guard who had i escap would have paid for it with their live i
learn that on the morrow of my rescu from the priest messeng
were despatch to montezuma the great king acquaint him with the
histori of my captur and seek to know hi pleasur concern me
but the wai to tenoctitlan wa far and mani week pass befor the
messeng return again meanwhil i fill the dai in learn
the maya languag and also someth of that of the aztec which i
practis with marina and other for marina wa not a tobascan have
been born at painalla on the southeastern border of the empir but
her mother sold her to merchant in order that marina inherit
might come to anoth child of her by a second marriag and thu in
the end the girl fell into the hand of the caciqu of tobasco
also i learn someth of the histori and custom and of the pictur
write of the land and how to read it and moreov i obtain great
reput among the tobascan by my skill in medicin so that in time thei
grew to believ that i wa inde a child of quetzal the good god and
the more i studi thi peopl the less i could understand of them in
most wai thei were equal to ani nation of our own world of which i had
knowledg none ar more skill in the art few ar better architect
or boast purer law moreov thei were brave and had patienc but
their faith wa the canker at the root of the tree in precept it wa
nobl and had much in common with our own such as the rite of baptism
but i have told what it wa in practic and yet when all is said is
it more cruel to offer up victim to the god than to tortur them
in the vault of the holi offic or to immur them in the wall of
nunneri
when i had live a month in tobasco i had learn enough of the languag
to talk with marina with whom i grew friendli though no more and it
wa from her that i gather the most of my knowledg and also mani
hint as to the conduct necessari to my safeti in return i taught her
someth of my own faith and of the custom of the european and it
wa the knowledg that she gain from me which afterward made her
so us to the spaniard and prepar her to accept their religion
give her insight into the wai of white peopl
so i abod for four month and more in the hous of the caciqu of
tobasco who carri hi kind toward me to the length of offer
me hi sister in marriag to thi propos i said no as gentli as i
might and he marvel at it for the girl wa fair inde so well
wa i treat that had it not been that my heart wa far awai and
becaus of the horribl rite of their religion which i wa forc to
wit almost daili i could have learn to love thi gentl skill
and industri peopl
at length when full four month had pass awai the messeng
return from the court of montezuma have been much delai
by swollen river and other accid of travel so great wa the
import that the emperor attach to the fact of my captur and
so desir wa he to see me at hi capit that he had sent hi own
nephew the princ guatemoc to fetch me and a great escort of warrior
with him
never shall i forget my first meet with thi princ who afterward
becam my dear companion and brother in arm when the escort arriv i
wa awai from the town shoot deer with the bow and arrow a weapon in
the us of which i had such skill that all the indian wonder at
me not know that twice i had won the prize at the butt on bungai
common our parti be summon by a messeng we return bear our
deer with us on reach the courtyard of the caciqu hous i found
it fill with warrior most gorgeous attir and among them on more
splendid than the rest he wa young veri tall and broad most handsom
in face and have ey like those of an eagl while hi whole aspect
breath majesti and command hi bodi wa encas in a cuirass of gold
over which hung a mantl made of the most gorgeou feather exquisit
set in band of differ colour on hi head he wore a helmet of gold
surmount by the royal crest an eagl stand on a snake fashion
in gold and gem on hi arm and beneath hi knee he wore circlet
of gold and gem and in hi hand wa a copperblad spear round thi
man were mani nobl dress in a somewhat similar fashion except that
the most of them wore a vest of quilt cotton in place of the gold
cuirass and a jewel panach of the plume of bird instead of the
royal symbol
thi wa guatemoc montezuma nephew and afterward the last emperor
of anahuac so soon as i saw him i salut him in the indian fashion by
touch the earth with my right hand which i then rais to my head
but guatemoc have scan me with hi ey as i stood bow in hand
attir in my simpl hunter dress smile frankli and said
sure teul if i know anyth of the look of men we ar too equal
in our birth as in our ag for you to salut me as a slave greet hi
master and he held hi hand to me
i took it answer with the help of marina who wa watch thi
great lord with eager ey
it mai be so princ but though in my own countri i am a man of reput
and wealth here i am noth but a slave snatch from the sacrific
i know it he said frown it is well for all here that you were so
snatch befor the breath of life had left you els montezuma wrath
had fallen on thi citi and he look at the caciqu who trembl
such in those dai wa the terror of montezuma name
then he ask me if i wa a teul or spaniard i told him that i wa
no spaniard but on of anoth white race who had spanish blood in hi
vein thi sai seem to puzzl him for he had never so much as
heard of ani other white race so i told him someth of my stori at
least so much of it as had to do with my be cast awai
when i had finish he said if i have understood aright teul you
sai that you ar no spaniard yet that you have spanish blood in you
and came hither in a spanish ship and i find thi stori strang well
it is for montezuma to judg of these matter so let us talk of them no
more come and show me how you handl that great bow of your did you
bring it with you or did you fashion it here thei tell me teul that
there is no such archer in the land
so i came up and show him the bow which wa of my own make and would
shoot an arrow some sixti pace further than ani that i saw in anahuac
and we fell into talk on matter of sport and war marina help out my
want of languag and befor that dai wa done we had grown friendli
for a week the princ guatemoc and hi compani rest in the town of
tobasco and all thi time we three talk much togeth soon i saw
that marina look with ey of long on the great lord partli
becaus of hi beauti rank and might and partli becaus she weari of
her captiv in the hous of the caciqu and would share guatemoc
power for marina wa ambiti she tri to win hi heart in mani
wai but he seem not to notic her so that at last she spoke more
plainli and in my hear
you go henc tomorrow princ she said softli and i have a favour
to ask of you if you will listen to your handmaid
speak on maiden he answer
i would ask thi that if it pleas you you will bui me of the
caciqu my master or command him to give me up to you and take me with
you to tenoctitlan
guatemoc laugh aloud you put thing plainli maiden he said
but know that in the citi of tenoctitlan my wife and royal cousin
tecuichpo await me and with her three other ladi who as it chanc
ar somewhat jealou
now marina flush beneath her brown skin and for the first and last
time i saw her gentl ey grow hard with anger as she answer
i ask you to take me with you princ i did not ask to be your wife
or love
but perchanc you meant it he said dryli
whatev i mai have meant princ it is now forgotten i wish to see
the great citi and the great king becaus i weari of my life here and
would myself grow great you have refus me but perhap a time will
come when i shall grow great in spite of you and then i mai rememb
the shame that ha been put upon me against you princ and all your
royal hous
again guatemoc laugh then of a sudden grew stern
you ar overbold girl he said for less word than these mani a
on might find herself stretch upon the stone of sacrific but i will
forget them for your woman pride is stung and you know not what you
sai do you forget them also teul if you have understood
then marina turn and went her bosom heav with anger and outrag
love or pride and as she pass me i heard her mutter ye princ
you mai forget but i shall not
often sinc that dai i have wonder if some vision of the futur
enter into the girl breast in that hour or if in her wrath she
spoke at random i have wonder also whether thi scene between her and
guatemoc had anyth to do with the histori of her after life or did
marina as she avow to me in dai to come bring shame and ruin on
her countri for the love of cort alon it is hard to sai and perhap
these thing had noth to do with what follow for when great event
have happen we ar apt to search out caus for them in the past that
were no caus thi mai have been but a pass mood of her and on
soon put out of mind for it is certain that few build up the templ
of their live upon some firm foundat of hope or hate of desir or
despair though it ha happen to me to do so but rather take chanc
for their architectand inde whether thei take him or no he is still
the master builder still that marina did not forget thi talk i know
for in after time i heard her remind thi veri princ of the word that
had pass between them ay and heard hi nobl answer to her
now i have but on more thing to tell of my stai in tobasco and then
let me on to mexico and to the tale of how montezuma daughter becam
my wife and of my further deal with de garcia
on the dai of our departur a great sacrific of slave wa held upon
the teocal to propiti the god so that thei might give us a safe
journei and also in honour of some festiv for to the festiv of
the indian there wa no end thither we went up the side of the
steep pyramid sinc i must look upon these horror daili when all wa
prepar and we stood around the stone of sacrific while the multitud
watch below that fierc paba who onc had felt the beat of my
heart came forth from the sanctuari of the god quetzal and sign to
hi companion to stretch the first of the victim on the stone then
of a sudden the princ guatemoc step forward and address the
priest point to their chief and said
seiz that man
thei hesit for though he who command wa a princ of the blood
royal to lai hand upon a high priest wa sacrileg then with a smile
guatemoc drew forth a ring have a dull blue stone set in it bezel
on which wa engrav a strang devic with the ring he drew out also
a scroll of picturewrit and held them both befor the ey of the
paba now the ring wa the ring of montezuma and the scroll wa sign
by the great high priest of tenoctitlan and those who look on the
ring and the scroll knew well that to disobei the mandat of him who
bore them wa death and dishonour in on so without more ado thei
seiz their chief and held him then guatemoc spoke again and shortli
lai him on the stone and sacrific him to the god quetzal
now he who had taken such fierc joi in the death of other on thi same
stone began to trembl and weep for he did not desir to drink of hi
own medicin
why must i be offer up o princ he cri i who have been a
faith servant to the god and to the emperor
becaus you dare to try to offer up thi teul answer guatemoc
point to me without leav from your master montezuma and becaus
of the other evil that you have done all of which ar written in thi
scroll the teul is a son of quetzal as you have yourself declar
and quetzal will be aveng becaus of hi son awai with him here is
your warrant
then the priest who till thi moment had been hi servant drag
their chief to the stone and there notwithstand hi prayer and
bellow on who had don hi mantl practis hi own art upon
him and present hi bodi wa cast down the side of the pyramid for
my part i am not suffici of a christian to pretend that i wa sorri
to see him die in that same fashion by which he had caus the death of
so mani better men
when it wa done guatemoc turn to me and said so perish all your
enemi my friend teul
within an hour of thi event which reveal to me how great wa the
power of montezuma see that the sight of a ring from hi finger
could bring about the instant death of a high priest at the hand of
hi discipl we start on our long journei but befor i went i bid a
warm farewel to my friend the caciqu and also to marina who wept at
my go the caciqu i never saw again but marina i did see
for a whole month we travel for the wai wa far and the road rough
and sometim we must cut our path through forest and sometim we must
wait upon the bank of river mani were the strang sight that i saw
upon that journei and mani the citi in which we sojourn in much
state and honour but i cannot stop to tell of all these
on thing i will relat howev though briefli becaus it chang
the regard that the princ guatemoc and i felt on to the other into a
friendship which last till hi death and inde endur in my heart
to thi hour
on dai we were delai by the bank of a swollen river and in pastim
went out to hunt for deer when we had hunt a while and kill three
deer it chanc that guatemoc perceiv a buck stand on a hillock
and we set out to stalk it five of us in all but the buck wa in the
open and the tree and bush ceas a full hundr yard awai from where
he stood so that there wa no wai by which we might draw near to him
then guatemoc began to mock me sai now teul thei tell tale of
your archeri and thi deer is thrice as far as we aztec can make sure
of kill let us see your skill
i will try i answer though the shot is long
so we drew beneath the cover of a ceiba tree of which the lowest
branch droop to within fifteen feet of the ground and have set
an arrow on the string of the great bow that i had fashion after the
shape of those we us in merri england i aim and drew it straight
sped the arrow and struck the buck fair pass through it heart and
a low murmur of wonder went up from those who saw the feat
then just as we prepar to go to the fallen deer a male puma which
is noth but a cat though fifti time as big that had been watch
the buck from abov drop down from the bough of the ceiba tree full
on to the shoulder of the princ guatemoc fell him to the ground
where he lai face downward while the fierc brute claw and bit at hi
back inde had it not been for hi golden cuirass and helm guatemoc
would never have live to be emperor of anahuac and perhap it might
have been better so
now when thei saw the puma snarl and tear at the person of their
princ though brave men enough the three nobl who were with us were
seiz by sudden panic and ran think him dead but i did not run
though i should have been glad enough to do so at my side hung on of
the indian weapon that serv them instead of sword a club of wood set
on both side with spike of obsidian like the teeth in the bill of a
swordfish snatch it from it loop i gave the puma battl strike a
blow upon hi head that roll him over and caus the blood to pour
in a moment he wa up and at me roar with rage whirl the wooden
sword with both hand i smote him in mid air the blow pass between
hi open paw and catch him full on the snout and head so hard wa
thi stroke that my weapon wa shatter still it did not stop the
puma in a second i wa cast to the earth with a great shock and the
brute wa on me tear and bite at my chest and neck it wa well for
me at that moment that i wore a garment of quilt cotton otherwis
i must have been rip open and even with thi cover i wa sadli
torn and to thi dai i bear the mark of the beast claw upon my
bodi but now when i seem to be lost the great blow that i had struck
took effect on him for on of the point of glass had pierc to hi
brain he lift hi head hi claw contract themselv in my flesh
then he howl like a dog in pain and fell dead upon my bodi so i
lai upon the ground unabl to stir for i wa much hurt until my
companion have taken heart came back and pull the puma off me
by thi time guatemoc who saw all but till now wa unabl to move from
lack of breath had found hi feet again
teul he gasp you ar a brave man inde and if you live i swear
that i will alwai stand your friend to the death as you have stood
mine
thu he spoke to me but to the other he said noth cast no
reproach at them
then i faint awai
chapter xv
the court of montezuma
now for a week i wa so ill from my wound that i wa unabl to be
move and then i must be carri in a litter till we came to within
three dai journei of the citi of tenoctitlan or mexico after that
as the road were now better made and care for than ani i have seen in
england i wa abl to take to my feet again of thi i wa glad for
i have no love of be born on the shoulder of other men after the
womanish indian fashion and moreov as we had now come to a cold
countri the road run through vast tableland and across the top
of mountain it wa no longer necessari as it had been in the hot
land never did i see anyth more dreari than these immens length
of desol plain cover with alo and other thorni and succul
shrub of fantast aspect which alon could live on the sandi and
waterless soil thi is a strang land that can boast three separ
climat within it border and is abl to show all the glori of the
tropic side by side with desert of measureless expans
on night we camp in a rest hous of which there were mani built
along the road for the us of travel that wa place almost on
the top of the sierra or mountain rang which surround the vallei of
tenoctitlan next morn we took the road again befor dawn for the
cold wa so sharp at thi great height that we who had travel from
the hot land could sleep veri littl and also guatemoc desir if it
were possibl to reach the citi that night
when we had gone a few hundr pace the path came to the crest of the
mountain rang and i halt suddenli in wonder and admir below
me lai a vast bowl of land and water of which howev i could see
noth for the shadow of the night still fill it but befor me
pierc the veri cloud tower the crest of two snowclad mountain
and on these the light of the unrisen sun plai alreadi chang their
white to the stain of blood popo or the hill that smoke is the
name of the on and ixtac or the sleep woman that of the other
and no grander sight wa ever offer to the ey of man than thei
furnish in that hour befor the dawn from the lofti summit of popo
went up great column of smoke which what with the fire in their heart
and the crimson of the sunris look like roll pillar of
flame and for the glori of the glitter slope below that chang
continu from the mysteri of white to dull red from red to crimson
and from crimson to everi dazzl hue that the rainbow hold who can
tell it who can even imagin it none inde except those that have
seen the sun rise over the volcan of tenoctitlan
when i had feast my ey on popo i turn to ixtac she is not so
lofti as her husband for so the aztec name the volcan popo and when
first i look i could see noth but the gigant shape of a woman
fashion in snow and ly like a corps upon her lofti bier whose
hair stream down the mountain side but now the sunbeam caught her
also and she seem to start out in majesti from a veil of rosi mist
a wonder and thrill sight but beauti as she wa then still i
love the sleep woman best at ev then she li a shape of glori on
the black beneath and is slowli swallow up into the solemn night
as the dark draw it veil across her
now as i gaze the light began to creep down the side of the volcan
reveal the forest on their flank but still the vast vallei wa
fill with mist that lai in dens billow resembl those of the sea
through which hill and templ top start up like island by slow
degre as we pass upon our downward road the vapour clear awai
and the lake of tezcuco chalco and xochicalco shone in the sunlight
like giant mirror on their bank stood mani citi inde the
greatest of these mexico seem to float upon the water beyond them
and about them were green field of corn and alo and grove of forest
tree while far awai tower the black wall of rock that hedg in the
vallei
all dai we journei swiftli through thi fairi land we pass through
the citi of amaquem and ajotzinco which i will not stai to describ
and mani a love villag that nestl upon the border of lake chalco
then we enter on the great causewai of stone built like a road rest
on the water and with the afternoon we came to the town of cuitlahuac
thenc we pass on to iztapalapan and here guatemoc would have rest
for the night in the royal hous of hi uncl cuitlahua but when we
reach the town we found that montezuma who had been advis of
our approach by runner had sent order that we were to push on to
tenoctitlan and that palanquin had been made readi to bear us so we
enter the palanquin and leav that love citi of garden were
born swiftli along the southern causewai on we went past town built
upon pile fix in the bottom of the lake past garden that were laid
out on reed and float over the water like a boat past teocal and
glisten templ without number through fleet of light cano and
thousand of indian go to and fro about their busi till at
length toward sunset we reach the battlement fort that is call
xoloc which stand upon the dyke i sai stand but ala it stand no
more cort ha destroi it and with it all those gloriou citi
which my ey beheld that dai
at xoloc we began to enter the citi of tenoctitlan or mexico the
mightiest citi that ever i had seen the hous on the outskirt
inde were built of mud or adob but those in the richer part were
construct of red stone each hous surround a courtyard and wa
in turn surround by a garden while between them ran canal have
footpath on either side then there were squar and in the squar
pyramid palac and templ without end i gaze on them till i wa
bewild but all seem as noth when at length i saw the great
templ with it stone gatewai open to the north and the south
the east and the west it wall carven everywher with serpent it
polish pavement it teocal deck with human skull thousand
upon thousand of them and it vast surround tianquez or market
place i caught but a glimps of it then for the dark wa fall
and afterward we were born on through the dark i did not know
whither
a while went by and i saw that we had left the citi and were pass
up a steep hill beneath the shadow of mighti cedar tree present we
halt in a courtyard and here i wa bidden to alight then the princ
guatemoc led me into a wondrou hous of which all the room were
roof with cedar wood and it wall hung with richlycolour cloth
and in that hous gold seem as plenti as brick and oak ar with

here we stood a while with fold hand and downcast ey till a
signal wa made to us to advanc

i went to the citi of tobasco o gloriou montezuma i found the teul
and brought him hither also i caus the high priest to be sacrif

signet and he gave the ring to a counsellor
why did you delai so long upon the road nephew
becaus of the chanc of the journei while save my life royal
montezuma the teul my prison wa bitten by a puma it skin is
brought to you as an offer
now montezuma look at me for the first time then open a pictur
scroll that on of the counsellor hand to him and read in it
glanc at me from time to time
the descript is good he said at length in all save on thingit
doe not sai that thi prison is the handsomest man in anahuac sai
teul why have your countrymen land on my dominion and slain my
peopl
i know noth of it o king i answer as well as i might with the
help of guatemoc and thei ar not my countrymen
the report sai that you confess to have the blood of these teul in
your vein and that you came to these shore or near them in on of
their great cano
that is so o king yet i am not of their peopl and i came to the
shore float on a barrel
i hold that you lie answer montezuma frown for the shark and
crocodil would devour on who swam thu then he ad anxious
sai ar you of the descend of quetzal
i do not know o king i am of a white race and our forefath wa
name adam
perchanc that is anoth name for quetzal he said it ha long been
prophesi that hi children would return and now it seem that the
hour of their come is at hand and he sigh heavili then ad go
now tomorrow you shall tell me of these teul and the council of the
priest shall decid your fate
now when i heard the name of the priest i trembl in all my bone and

slai me if you will o king but i beseech you deliv me not again
into the hand of the priest
we ar all in the hand of the priest who ar the mouth of god he
answer coldli besid i hold that you have li to me
then i went forebod evil and guatemoc also look downcast bitterli
did i curs the hour when i had said that i wa of the spanish blood and
yet no spaniard had i known even what i knew that dai tortur would
not have wrung those word from me but now it wa too late
now guatemoc led me to certain apart of thi palac of chapoltepec
where hi wife the royal princess tecuichpo wa wait him a veri
love ladi and with her other ladi among them the princess otomi
montezuma daughter and some nobl here a rich repast wa serv to
us and i wa seat next to the princess otomi who spoke to me most
gracious ask me mani thing concern my land and the peopl of
the teul it wa from her that i learn first that the emperor wa
much disturb at heart becaus of these teul or spaniard for he wa
superstiti and held them to be the children of the god quetzal who
accord to ancient propheci would come to take the land inde so
graciou wa she and so royal love that for the first time i felt
my heart stir by ani other woman than my betroth whom i had left
far awai in england and whom as i thought i should never see again
and as i learn in after dai mine wa not the onli heart that wa
stir that night
near to us sat anoth royal ladi papantzin the sister of montezuma
but she wa neither young nor love and yet most sweet face and sad
as though with the presag of death inde she di not mani week
after but could not rest quiet in her grave as shall be told
when the feast wa done and we had drunk of the cocoa or chocol
and smoke tobacco in pipe a strang but most sooth custom that i
learn in tobasco and of which i have never been abl to break myself
though the weed is still hard to come by here in england i wa led to
my sleep place a small chamber panel with cedar board for a
while i could not sleep for i wa overcom by the memori of all the
strang sight that i had seen in thi wonder new land which wa so
civilis and yet so barbar i thought of that sadfac king the
absolut lord of million surround by all that the heart of man can
desir by vast wealth by hundr of love wive by love children
by countless armi by all the glori of the art rule over the
fairest empir on the earth with everi pleasur to hi hand a god in
all thing save hi mortal and worship as a god and yet a victim
to fear and superstit and more heavi heart than the meanest slave
about hi palac here wa a lesson such as solomon would have love to
show for with solomon thi montezuma might cry
i gather me also silver and gold and the peculiar treasur of king
and of the provinc i gat me men singer and women singer and the
delight of the son of men and music instrument and that of all
sort and whatsoev my ey desir i kept not from them i withheld
not my heart from ani joi and behold all wa vaniti and vexat of
spirit and there wa no profit under the sun
so he might have cri so inde he did cry in other word for as
the paint of the skeleton and the three monarch that is upon the
north wall of the aisl of ditchingham church show forth so aptli
king have their fate and happi is not to them more than to ani
other of the son of men inde it is not at all as my benefactor
fonseca onc said to me true happi is but a dream from which we
awak continu to the sorrow of our short labori dai
then my thought flew to the vision of that most love maid the
princess otomi who as i believ had look on me so kindli and i
found that vision sweet for i wa young and the english lili my own
love wa far awai and lost to me for ever wa it then wonder that
i should find thi indian poppi fair inde where is the man who would
not have been overcom by her sweet her beauti and that stamp
of royal grace which come with kingli blood and the daili exercis of
power like the rich wonder of the robe she wore her veri barbar
of which now i saw but the better side drew and dazzl my mind ey
give her woman tender some new qualiti sombr and strang an
eastern rich which is lack in our well school english women
that at on and the same stroke touch both the imagin and the
sens and through them enthral the heart
for otomi seem such woman as men dream of but veri rare win see
that the world ha few such natur and fewer nurseri where thei can
be rear at onc pure and passion of royal blood and heart rich
natur and most womanli yet brave as a man and beauti as the night
with a mind athirst for knowledg and a spirit that no sorrow could
avail to quell ever chang in her outer mood and yet most faith
and with the honour of a man such wa otomi montezuma daughter
princess of the otomi wa it wonder then that i found her fair or
when fate gave me her love that at last i love her in turn and yet
there wa that in her natur which should have held me back had i but
known of it for with all her charm her beauti and her virtu at
heart she wa still a savag and strive as she would to hide it at
time her blood would master her
but as i lai in the chamber of the palac of chapoltepec the tramp of
the guard without my door remind me that i had littl now to do with
love and other delight i whose life hung from dai to dai upon a hair
tomorrow the priest would decid my fate and when the priest were
judg the prison might know the sentenc befor it wa spoken i wa
a stranger and a white man sure such a on would prove an offer
more accept to the god than that furnish by a thousand indian
heart i had been snatch from the altar of tobasco that i might
grace the higher altar of tenoctitlan and that wa all my fate would
be to perish miser far from my home and in thi world never to be
heard of more
muse thu sadli at last i slept when i woke the sun wa up rise
from my mat i went to the woodbar window place and look through
the palac whenc i gaze wa place on the crest of a rocki hill on
on side thi hill wa bath by the blue water of tezcuco on the
other a mile or more awai rose the templ tower of mexico along the
slope of the hill and in some direct for a mile from it
base grew huge cedar tree from the bough of which hung a grei and
ghostlylook moss these tree ar so larg that the smallest of them
is bigger than the best oak in thi parish of ditchingham while the
greatest measur twentytwo pace round the base beyond and between
these marvel and ancient tree were the garden of montezuma that
with their strang and gorgeou flower their marbl bath their
aviari and wild beast den were as i believ the most wonder in
the whole world
at the least i thought to myself even if i must die it is
someth to have seen thi countri of anahuac it king it custom
and it peopl
the garden of montezuma have been long destroi but
some of the cedar still flourish at chapoltepec though the
spaniard cut down mani on of them which tradit sai
wa a favourit tree of the great emperor measur
accord to a rough calcul the author of thi book
made upon the spot about sixti feet round the bole it is
strang to think that a few ancient conif should alon
surviv of all the glori of montezuma wealth and state

then thei place me in a litter and carri me down the hill
chapoltepec and along causewai and through street till we came to
the great squar of the templ befor me went herald and priest
after me follow page and nobl and ever as we pass the multitud
prostrat themselv till i began to understand how wearisom a thing
it is to be a god next thei carri me through the wall of serpent and
up the wind path of the mighti teocal till we reach the summit
where the templ and idol stood and here a great drum beat and the
priest sacrif victim after victim in my honour and i grew sick with
the sight of wicked and blood present thei invit me to descend
from the litter lai rich carpet and flower for my feet to tread
on and i wa much afraid for i thought that thei were about to
sacrific me to myself or some other divin but thi wa not so
thei led me to the edg of the pyramid or as near as i would go for
i shrank back lest thei should seiz me suddenli and cast me over the
edg and there the high priest call out my digniti to the thousand
who were assembl beneath and everi on of them bent the knee in
ador of me the priest abov and the multitud below and so it
went on till i grew dizzi with the worship and the shout and the
sound of music and the sight of death and veri thank wa i when
at last thei carri me back to chapoltepec
here new honour await me for i wa conduct to a splendid rang of
apart next to those of the emperor himself and i wa told that
all montezuma household were at my command and that he who refus to
do my bid should die
so at last i spoke and said it wa my bid that i should be suffer
to rest a while till a feast wa prepar for me in the apart of
guatemoc the princ for there i hope to meet otomi
my tutor and the nobl who attend me answer that montezuma my
servant had trust that i would feast with him that night still my
command should be done then thei left me sai that thei would come
again in an hour to lead me to the banquet now i threw off the emblem
of my godhead and cast myself down on cushion to rest and think and a
certain exult took possess of me for wa i not a god and had i
not power almost absolut still be of a cautiou mind i wonder why
i wa a god and how long my power would last
befor the hour had gone by page and nobl enter bear new robe
which were put upon my bodi and fresh flower to crown my head and i
wa led awai to the apart of guatemoc fair women go befor me
who plai upon instrument of music
here guatemoc the princ wait to receiv me which he did as though
i hi captiv and companion wa the first of king and yet i thought
that i saw merriment in hi ey mingl with sorrow bend forward i
spoke to him in a whisper
what doe all thi mean princ i said am i befool or am i
inde a god
hush he answer bow low and speak beneath hi breath it
mean both good and ill for you my friend teul anoth time i will
tell you then he ad aloud doe it pleas you o tezcat god of

the god like good compani princ i said
now dure thi talk i had discov that among those gather in the
hall wa the princess otomi so when we pass to the low tabl around
which we were to sit on cushion i hung back watch where she would
place herself and then at onc seat myself besid her thi caus
some littl confus among the compani for the place of honour had
been prepar for me at the head of the tabl the seat of guatemoc

your seat is yonder o tezcat she said blush beneath her oliv
skin as she spoke

again she blush and answer ala i no goddess but onli a mortal
maid listen if you desir that i should be your companion at our
feast you must issu it as a command none will dare to disobei you
not even montezuma my father
so i rose and said in veri halt aztec to the nobl who wait on
me it is my will that my place shall alwai be set by the side of the
princess otomi
at these word otomi blush even more and a murmur went round among
the guest while guatemoc first look angri and then laugh but the
nobl my attend bow and their spokesman answer
the word of tezcat shall be obei let the seat of otomi the royal
princess the favour of tezcat be place by the side of the god
afterward thi wa alwai done except when i at with montezuma
himself moreov the princess otomi becam known throughout the citi
as the bless princess the favour of tezcat for so strong a hold
had custom and superstit upon thi peopl that thei thought it the
greatest of honour to her who wa among the first ladi in the land
that he who for a littl space wa suppos to hold the spirit of the
soul of the world should deign to desir her companionship when he at
now the feast went on and present i made shift to ask otomi what all
thi might mean
ala she whisper you do not know nor dare i tell you now but i
will sai thi though you who ar a god mai sit where you will todai
an hour shall come when you must lie where you would not listen when
we have finish eat sai that it is your wish to walk in the garden
of the palac and that i should accompani you then i mai find a chanc
to speak
accordingli when the feast wa over i said that i desir to walk in
the garden with the princess otomi and we went out and wander under
the solemn tree that ar drape in a windingsheet of grei moss which
hang from everi bough as though the forest had been deck with the
white beard of an armi of ag men wave and rustl sadli in the keen
night air but ala we might not be alon for after us at a distanc
of twenti pace follow all my crowd of attend nobl togeth with
fair danc girl and minstrel arm with their accurs flute on
which thei blew in season and out of it danc as thei blew in vain
did i command them to be silent tell them that it wa written of old
that there is a time to plai and danc and a time to ceas from danc
for in thi alon thei would not obei me never could i be at peac
becaus of them then or thereaft and not till now did i learn how
great a treasur is solitud
still we were allow to walk togeth under the tree and though the
clamour of music pursu us wherev we went we were soon deep in talk
then it wa that i learn how dread wa the fate which overshadow
me
know o teul said otomi for she would call me by the old name when
there were none to hear thi is the custom of our land that everi
year a young captiv should be chosen to be the earthli imag of the
god tezcat who creat the world onli two thing ar necessari to thi
captiv name that hi blood should be nobl and that hi person

rumour have reach us and whose come my father montezuma dread
more than anyth in the world it wa thought by the priest that you
mai avert their anger from us and the anger of the god
now otomi paus as on who ha someth to sai that she can scarc
find word to fit but i rememb onli what had been said swell
inwardli with the sens of my own great and becaus thi love
princess had declar that i wa the most beauti man in anahuac

and certain art which you must learn none will troubl you your
slightest wish will be a law and when you smile on ani it shall be an
omen of good to them and thei will bless you even my father montezuma
will treat you with rever as an equal or more everi delight shall
be your except that of marriag and thi will be withheld till the
twelfth month of the year then the four most beauti maiden in the
land will be given to you as bride
and who will choos them i ask
nai i know not teul who do not meddl in such mysteri she
answer hurriedli sometim the god is judg and sometim the
priest judg for him it is as it mai chanc listen now to the end of
my tale and you will sure forget the rest for on month you will live
with your wive and thi month you will pass in feast at all the
noblest hous in the citi on the last dai of the month howev you
will be place in a royal barg and togeth with your wive paddl
across the lake to a place that is name melt of metal thenc you

sai it you ar doom to be offer as a sacrific to the god whose
spirit you hold the great god tezcat for your heart will be torn from
your bodi and your head will be struck from your shoulder and set upon
the stake that is known as post of head
now when i heard thi dread doom i groan aloud and my knee
trembl so that i almost fell to the ground then a great furi seiz
me and forget my father counsel i blasphem the god of that
countri and the peopl who worship them first in the aztec and maya
languag then when my knowledg of these tongu fail me in spanish
and good english but otomi who heard some of my word and guess
more wa seiz with fear and lift her hand sai
curs not the aw god i beseech you lest some terribl thing
befal you at onc if you ar overheard it will be thought that you
have an evil spirit and not a good on and then you must die now and by
torment at the least the god who ar everywher will hear you
let them hear i answer thei ar fals god and that countri
is accurs which worship them thei ar doom i sai and all their
worshipp ar doom nai i care not if i am hearda well die now
by torment as live a year in the torment of approach death but i
shall not die alon all the sea of blood that your priest have shed
cri out for vengeanc to the true god and he will aveng
thu i rave on be mad with fear and impot anger while the
princess otomi stood terrifi and amaz at my blasphemi and the
flute pipe and the dancer danc behind us and as i rave i saw that
the mind of otomi wander from my word for she wa stare toward
the east like on who see a vision then i look also toward the east
and saw that the sky wa alight there for from the edg of the horizon
to the highest part of heaven spread a fan of pale and fear light
powder over with spark of fire the handl of the fan rest on the
earth as it were while it wing cover the eastern sky now i ceas
my curs and stood transfix and as i stood a cry of terror aros
from all the precinct of the palac and peopl pour from everi door
to gaze upon the portent that flare and blaze in the east present
montezuma himself came out attend by hi great lord and in that
ghastli light i saw that hi lip work and hi hand writh over each
other nor wa the miracl done with for anon from the clear sky that
hung over the citi descend a ball of fire which seem to rest upon
the point of the lofti templ in the great squar light up the
teocal as with the glare of dai it vanish but where it had been
anoth light now burn for the templ of quetzal wa afir
now cri of fear and lament aros from all who beheld these
wonder on the hill of chapoltepec and also from the citi below even i
wa frighten i do not know why for it mai well be that the blaze
of light which we saw on that and after night wa noth but the
bright of a comet and that the fire in the templ wa caus by
a thunderbolt but to these peopl and more especi to montezuma
whose mind wa fill alreadi with rumour of the come of a strang
white race which as it wa truli prophesi would bring hi empir to
nothing the omen seem veri evil inde if thei had ani doubt
as to their mean it wa soon to be dispel in their mind at
least for as we stood wonderstruck a messeng pant and soil
with travel arriv among us and prostrat himself befor the majesti
of the emperor he drew a paint scroll from hi robe and hand it to
an attend nobl so desir wa montezuma to know it content
that contrari to all custom he snatch the roll from the hand of the
counsellor and unrol it he began to read the pictur write
by the bale light of the blaze sky and templ present as we
watch and he read montezuma groan aloud and cast down the
write he cover hi face with hi hand as it chanc it fell near
to where i stood and i saw paint over it rude pictur of ship of
the spanish rig and of men in the spanish armour then i understood why
montezuma groan the spaniard had land on hi shore
now some of hi counsellor approach him to consol him but he thrust
them asid sai
let me mournth doom that wa foretold is fallen upon the children
of anahuac the children of quetzal muster on our shore and slai my
peopl let me mourn i sai
at that moment anoth messeng came from the palac have grief
written on hi face
speak said montezuma
o king forgiv the tongu that must tell such tide your royal
sister papantzin wa seiz with terror at yonder dread sight and
he point to the heaven she li dy in the palac
now when the emperor heard that hi sister whom he love wa dy he
said noth but cover hi face with hi royal mantl he pass
slowli back to the palac
and all the while the crimson light gleam and sparkl in the east
like some monstrou and unnatur dawn while the templ of quetzal
burn fierc in the citi beneath
now i turn to the princess otomi who had stood by my side
throughout overcom with wonder and trembl
did i not sai that thi countri wa accurs princess of the otomi
you said it teul she answer and it is accurs
then we went into the palac and even in thi hour of fear after me
came the minstrel as befor
chapter xvii
the aris of papantzin
on the morrow papantzin di and wa buri with great pomp that
same even in the burialground at chapoltepec by the side of the
emperor royal ancestor but as will be seen she wa not content
with their compani on that dai also i learn that to be a god is not
all pleasur sinc it wa expect of me that i must master variou
art and chiefli the horrid art of music to which i never had ani
desir still my own wish were not allow to weigh in the matter
for there came to me tutor ag men who might have found better
employ to instruct me in the us of the lute and on thi
instrument i must learn to strum other there were also who taught me
letter poetri and art as thei were understood among the aztec and
all thi knowledg i wa glad of still i rememb the word of the
preacher which tell us that he who increaseth knowledg increaseth
sorrow and moreov i could see littl us in acquir learn that
wa to be lost shortli on the stone of sacrific
as to thi matter of my sacrific i wa at first desper but
reflect told me that i had alreadi pass mani danger and come out
unscath and therefor it wa possibl that i might escap thi on
also at least death wa still a long wai off and for the present i
wa a god so i determin that whether i di or live while i live i
would live like a god and take such pleasur as came to my hand and
i act on thi resolv no man ever had greater or more strang
opportun and no man can have us them better inde had it not
been for the sorrow thought of my lost love and home which would
forc themselv upon me i should have been almost happi becaus of
the power that i wield and the strang of all around me but i
must to my tale
dure the dai that follow the death of papantzin the palac and
the citi also were plung in ferment the mind of men were shaken
strang becaus of the rumour that fill the air everi night the
fieri portent blaze in the east everi dai a new wonder or omen wa
report and with it some wild tale of the do of the spaniard who
by most were held to be white god the children of quetzal come back
to take the land which their forefath rule
but of all that were troubl none were in such bad case as the emperor
himself who dure these week scarc at or drank or slept so
heavi were hi fear upon him in thi strait he sent messeng to hi
ancient rival that wise and sever man neza the king of the alli
state of tezcuco beg that he would visit him thi king came
an old man with a fierc and gleam ey and i wa wit to the
interview that follow for in my qualiti of god i had full liberti of
the palac and even to be present at the council of the emperor and
hi nobl when the two monarch had feast togeth montezuma spoke
to neza of the matter of the omen and of the come of the teul
ask him to lighten the dark by hi wisdom then neza pull hi
long grei beard and answer that heavi as the heart of montezuma might
be it must grow still heavier befor the end
see lord he said i am so sure that the dai of our empir ar
number that i will plai you at dice for my kingdom which you and
your forefath have ever desir to win
for what wager ask montezuma
i will plai you thu answer neza you shall stake three fight
cock of which should i win i ask the spur onli i set against them
all the wide empir of tezcuco
a small stake said montezuma cock ar mani and kingdom few
still it shall serv our turn answer the ag king for know that
we plai against fate as the game goe so shall the issu be if you
win my kingdom all is well if i win the cock then goodby to
the glori of anahuac for it peopl will ceas to be a peopl and
stranger shall possess the land
let us plai and see said montezuma and thei went down to the place
that is call tlachco where the game ar set here thei began the
match with dice and at first all went well for montezuma so that he
call aloud that alreadi he wa lord of tezcuco
mai it be so answer the ag neza and from that moment the chanc
chang for strive as he would montezuma could not win anoth point
and present the set wa finish and neza had won the cock now the
music plai and courtier came forward to give the king homag on hi
success but he rose sigh and said
i had far sooner lose my kingdom than have won these fowl for if i
had lost my kingdom thei would still have pass into the hand of on
of my own race now ala my possess and hi must come under the
hand of stranger who shall cast down our god and bring our name to
noth
and have spoken thu he rose and take farewel of the emperor he
depart for hi own land where as it chanc he di veri shortli
without live to see the fulfil of hi fear
on the morrow of hi departur came further account of the do of
the spaniard that plung montezuma into still greater alarm in hi
terror he sent for an astronom note throughout the land for the
truth of hi divin the astronom came and wa receiv by the
emperor privat what he told him i do not know but at least it wa
noth pleasant for that veri night men were command to pull down
the hous of thi sage who wa buri in it ruin
two dai after the death of the astronom montezuma bethought
him that as he believ i also wa a teul and could give him
inform so at the hour of sunset he sent for me bid me walk
with him in the garden i went thither follow by my musician and
attend who would never leav me in peac but he command that all
should stand asid as he wish to speak with me alon then he began
to walk beneath the mighti cedar tree and i with him but keep on
pace behind
teul he said at length tell me of your countrymen and why thei
have come to these shore see that you speak truth
thei ar no countrymen of mine o montezuma i answer though my
mother wa on of them
did i not bid you speak the truth teul if your mother wa on of
them must you not also be of them for ar you not of your mother
bone and blood
as the king pleas i answer bow then i began and told him
of the spaniardsof their countri their great their cruelti and
their greed of gold and he listen eagerli though i think that
he believ littl of what i said for hi fear had made him veri
suspici when i had done he spoke and said
why do thei come here to anahuac
i fear o king that thei come to take the land or at the least to rob
it of all it treasur and to destroi it faith
what then is your counsel teul how can i defend myself against these
mighti men who ar cloth in metal and ride upon fierc wild beast
who have instrument that make a nois like thunder at the sound of
which their adversari fall dead by hundr and who bear weapon of
shine silver in their hand ala there is no defenc possibl for
thei ar the children of quetzal come back to take the land from my
childhood i have known that thi evil overshadow me and now it is at
my door
if i who am onli a god mai ventur to speak to the lord of the
earth i answer i sai that the repli is easi meet forc by forc
the teul ar few and you can muster a thousand soldier for everi
on of their fall on them at onc do not hesit till their prowess
find them friend but crush them
such is the counsel of on whose mother wa a teul the emperor
answer with sarcasm and bitter mean tell me now counsellor
how am i to know that in fight against them i shall not be fight
against the god how even am i to learn the true wish and purpos of
men or god who cannot speak my tongu and whose tongu i cannot speak
it is easi o montezuma i answer i can speak their tongu send
me to discov for you
now as i spoke thu my heart bound with hope for if onc i could come
among the spaniard perhap i might escap the altar of sacrific also
thei seem a link between me and home thei had sail hither in ship
and ship can retrac their path for though at present my lot wa not
all sorrow it will be guess that i should have been glad inde to
find myself onc more among christian men
montezuma look at me a while and answer
you must think me veri foolish teul what shall i send you to tell
my fear and weak to your countrymen and to show them the joint in
my har do you then suppos that i do not know you for a spy sent to
thi land by these same teul to gather knowledg of the land fool
i knew it from the first and by huitzel were you not vow to tezcat
your heart should smoke tomorrow on the altar of huitzel be warn
and give me no more fals counsel lest your end prove swifter than you
think learn that i have ask these question of you to a purpos and
by the command of the god as it wa written on the heart of those
sacrif thi dai thi wa the purpos and thi wa the command
that i might discov your secret mind and that i should shun whatev
advic you chanc to give you counsel me to fight the teul
therefor i will not fight them but meet them with gift and fair
word for i know well that you would have me to do that which should
bring me to my doom
thu he spoke veri fierc and in a low voic hi head held low and
hi arm cross upon hi breast and i saw that he shook with passion
even then though i wa veri much afraid for god as i wa a nod from
thi mighti king would have sent me to death by torment i wonder at
the folli of on who in everyth els wa so wise why should he doubt
me thu and allow superstit to drag him down to ruin todai i see
the answer montezuma did not these thing of himself but becaus the
hand of destini work with hi hand and the voic of destini spoke in
hi voic the god of the aztec were fals god inde but i for on
believ that thei had life and intellig for those hideou shape of
stone were the habit of devil and the priest spoke truth when
thei said that the sacrific of men wa pleas to their god
to these devil the king went for counsel through the priest and now
thi doom wa on them that thei must give fals counsel to their own
destruct and to the destruct of those who worship them as wa
decre by on more power than thei
now while we were talk the sun had sunk swiftli so that all the
world wa dark but the light still linger on the snowi crest of the
volcan popo and ixtac stain them an aw red never befor to my
sight had the shape of the dead woman whose everlast bier is ixtac
bulk seem so clear and wonder as on that night for either it wa
so or my fanci gave it the veri shape and colour of a woman corps
steep in blood and laid out for burial nor wa it my phantasi alon
for when montezuma had finish upbraid me he chanc to look up and
hi ey fall on the mountain remain fix there
look now teul he said present with a solemn laugh yonder li
the corps of the nation of anahuac wash in a water of blood and made
readi for burial is she not terribl in death
as he spoke the word and turn to go a sound of dole wail came
from the direct of the mountain a veri wild and unearthli sound that
caus the blood in my vein to stand still now montezuma caught my arm
in hi fear and we gaze togeth on ixtac and it seem to us that
thi wonder happen for in that red and fear light the red figur
of the sleep woman aros or appear to rise from it bier of
stone it aros slowli like on who awak from sleep and present
it stood upright upon the mountain brow tower high into the air
there it stood a giant and awaken corps it white wrap stain
with blood and we trembl to see it
for a while the wraith remain thu gaze toward the citi of
tenoctitlan then suddenli it threw it vast arm upward as though in
grief and at that moment the night rush in upon it and cover it
while the sound of wail di slowli awai
sai teul gasp the emperor do i not well to be afraid when such
portent as these meet my ey dai by dai hearken to the lament
in the citi we have not seen thi sight alon listen how the peopl
cry aloud with fear and the priest beat their drum to avert the omen
weep on ye peopl and ye priest prai and do sacrific it is veri
fit for the dai of your doom is upon you o tenoctitlan queen of
citi i see you ruin and desol your palac blacken with fire
your templ desecr your pleasant garden a wilder i see your
highborn women the wanton of stranger lord and your princ their
servant the canal run red with the blood of your children your
gatewai ar block with their bone death is about you everywher
dishonour is your daili bread desol is your portion farewel
to you queen of the citi cradl of my forefath in which i wa
nurs
thu montezuma lament in the dark and as he cri aloud the great
moon rose over the edg of the world and pour it level light through
the bough of the cedar cloth in their ghostli robe of moss it
struck upon montezuma tall shape on hi distraught counten and
thin hand as he wave them to and fro in hi prophet agoni on my
glitter garment and the terrorstricken band of courtier and the
musician who had ceas from their music a littl wind sprang up
also moan sadli in the mighti tree abov and against the rock of
chapoltepec never did i wit a scene more strang or more pregnant
with mysteri and the promis of unborn horror than that of thi great
monarch mourn over the downfal of hi race and power as yet no
misfortun had befallen the on or the other and still he knew that
both were doom and these word of lament burst from a heart
broken by a grief of which the shadow onli lai upon it
but the wonder of that night were not yet done with
when montezuma had made an end of cry hi propheci i ask him
humbl if i should summon to him the lord who were in attend on
him but who stood at some distanc
nai he answer i will not have them see me thu with grief and
terror upon my face whoever fear at least i must seem brave walk
with me a while teul and if it is in your mind to murder me i shall
not griev
i made no answer but follow him as he led the wai down the darkest of
the wind path that run between the cedar tree where it would have
been easi for me to kill him if i wish but i could not see how i
should be advantag by the deed also though i knew that montezuma wa
my enemi my heart shrank from the thought of murder for a mile or more
he walk on without speak now beneath the shadow of the tree and
now through open space of garden plant with love flower till at
last we came to the gate of the place where the royal dead ar laid to
rest now in front of these gate wa an open space of turf on which the
moonlight shone brightli and in the centr of thi space lai someth
white shape like a woman here montezuma halt and look at the
gate then said
these gate open four dai sinc for papantzin my sister how long
i wonder will pass befor thei open for me
as he spoke the white shape upon the grass which i had seen and he had
not seen stir like an awaken sleeper as the snow shape upon the
mountain had stir so thi shape stir as it had arisen so thi
on aros as it threw it arm upward so thi on threw up her arm
now montezuma saw and stood still trembl and i trembl also
then the womanfor it wa a womanadvanc slowli toward us and
as she came we saw that she wa drape in gravecloth present she
lift her head and the moonlight fell full upon her face now montezuma
groan aloud and i groan for we saw that the face wa the thin pale
face of the princess papantzinpapantzin who had lain four dai in the
grave on she came toward us glide like on who walk in her sleep
till she stop befor the bush in the shadow of which we stood now
papantzin or the ghost of papantzin look at us with blind ey that
is with ey that were open and yet did not seem to see
ar you there montezuma my brother she said in the voic of
papantzin sure i feel your presenc though i cannot see you
now montezuma step from the shadow and stood face to face with the
dead
who ar you he said who wear the shape of on dead and ar dress
in the garment of the dead
i am papantzin she answer and i am risen out of death to bring
you a messag montezuma my brother
what messag do you bring me he ask hoars
i bring you a messag of doom my brother your empir shall fall and
soon you shall be accompani to death by ten of thousand of your
peopl for four dai i have live among the dead and there i have seen
your fals god which ar devil there also i have seen the priest
that serv them and mani of those who worship them plung into
torment unutter becaus of the worship of these demon god the
peopl of anahuac is destin to destruct
have you no word of comfort for me papantzin my sister he ask
none she answer perchanc if you abandon the worship of the fals
god you mai save your soul your life you cannot save nor the live of
your peopl
then she turn and pass awai into the shadow of the tree i heard
her gravecloth sweep upon the grass
now a furi seiz montezuma and he rave aloud sai
curs on you papantzin my sister why then do you come back from the
dead to bring me such evil tide had you brought hope with you had
you shown a wai of escap then i would have welcom you mai you go
back into dark and mai the earth lie heavi on your heart for ever
as for my god my father worship them and i will worship them till
the end ay if thei desert me at least i will never desert them
the god ar angri becaus the sacrific ar few upon their altar

chapter xviii
the name of the bride
now some month pass between the date of my name as the god tezcat
and the entri of the spaniard into mexico and dure all thi space
the citi wa in a state of ferment again and again montezuma sent
embassi to cort bear with them vast treasur of gold and gem
as present and at the same time prai him to withdraw for thi
foolish princ did not understand that by displai so much wealth
he flew a lure which must sure bring the falcon on himself to these
ambassador cort return courteou answer togeth with present of
small valu and that wa all
then the advanc began and the emperor learn with dismai of the
conquest of the warlik tribe of the tlascalan who though thei were
montezuma bitter and hereditari foe yet made a stand against
the white man next came the tide that from enemi the conquer
tlascalan had becom the alli and servant of the spaniard and that
thousand of their fiercest warrior were advanc with him upon the
sacr citi of cholula a while pass and it wa known that cholula
also had been given to massacr and that the holi or rather the unholi
god had been torn from their shrine marvel tale were told of
the spaniard of their courag and their might of the armour that
thei wore the thunder that their weapon made in battl and the fierc
beast which thei bestrod onc two head of white men taken in a
skirmish were sent to montezuma fiercelook head great and hairi
and with them the head of a hors when montezuma saw these ghastli
relic he almost faint with fear still he caus them to be set up on
pinnacl of the great templ and proclam to be made that thi fate
await everi invad of the land
meanwhil all wa confus in hi polici dai by dai council were
held of the nobl of high priest and of neighbour and friendli
king some advis on thing some anoth and the end of it wa
hesit and folli ah had montezuma but listen to the voic of
that great man guatemoc anahuac would not have been a spanish fief
todai for guatemoc prai him again and yet again to put awai hi
fear and declar open war upon the teul befor it wa too late to
ceas from make gift and send embassi to gather hi countless
armi and smite the foe in the mountain pass
but montezuma would answer to what end nephew how can i struggl
against these men when the god themselv have declar for them
sure the god can take their own part if thei wish it and if thei
will not for myself and my own fate i do not care but ala for my
peopl ala for the women and the children the ag and the weak
then he would cover hi face and moan and weep like a child and
guatemoc would pass from hi presenc dumb with furi at the folli of
so great a king but helpless to remedi it for like myself guatemoc
believ that montezuma had been smitten with a mad sent from heaven
to bring the land to ruin
now it must be understood that though my place as a god gave me
opportun of know all that pass yet i thoma wingfield wa
but a bubbl on that great wave of event which swept over the world of
anahuac two gener sinc i wa a bubbl on the crest of the wave
inde but at that time i had no more power than the foam ha over the
wave montezuma distrust me as a spy the priest look on me as a
god and futur victim and no more onli guatemoc my friend and otomi
who love me secretli had ani faith in me and with these two i
often talk show them the true mean of those thing that were
happen befor our ey but thei also were strengthless for though
hi reason wa no longer captain still the uncheck power of montezuma
guid the ship of state first thi wai and then that just as a rudder
direct a vessel to it ruin when the helmsman ha left it and it
swing at the merci of the wind and tide
the peopl were distraught with fear of the futur but not the less on
that account or perhap becaus of it thei plung with fervour into
pleasur altern them with religi ceremoni in those dai no
feast wa neglect and no altar lack it victim like a river that
quicken it flow as it draw near the precipic over which it must
fall so the peopl of mexico forese ruin awok as it were and
live as thei had never live befor all dai long the cri of victim
came from a hundr templ top and all night the sound of revelri
were heard among the street let us eat and drink thei said for
the god of the sea ar upon us and tomorrow we die now women who had
been held virtuou prove themselv wanton and men whose name were
honest show themselv knave and none cri fie upon them ay even
children were seen drunken in the street which is an abomin among
the aztec
the emperor had move hi household from chapoltepec to the palac
in the great squar face the templ and thi palac wa a town in
itself for everi night more than a thousand human be slept beneath
it roof not to speak of the dwarf and monster and the hundr of
wild bird and beast in cage here everi dai i feast with whom i
would and when i wa weari of feast it wa my custom to salli out
into the street plai on the lute for by now i had in some degre
master that hate instrument dress in shine apparel and
attend by a crowd of nobl and royal page then the peopl would
rush from their hous shout and do me rever the children
pelt me with flower and the maiden danc befor me kiss
my hand and feet till at length i wa attend by a mob a thousand
strong and i also danc and shout like ani villag fool for i think
that a kind of mad humour or perhap it wa the drunken of worship
enter into me in those dai also i sought to forget my grief i
desir to forget that i wa doom to the sacrific and that everi dai
brought me nearer to the red knife of the priest
i desir to forget but ala i could not the fume of the mescal
and the pulqu that i had drunk at feast would pass from my brain the
perfum of flower the sight of beauti and the ador of the peopl
would ceas to move me and i could onli brood heavili upon my doom and
think with long of my distant love and home in those dai had it
not been for the tender kind of otomi i think that my heart would
have broken or i should have slain myself but thi great and beauteou
ladi wa ever at hand to cheer me in a thousand wai and now and again
she would let fall some vagu word of hope that set my puls bound
it will be rememb that when first i came to the court of montezuma
i had found otomi fair and my fanci turn toward her now i still
found her fair but my heart wa so full of terror that there wa no
room in it for tender thought of her or of ani other woman inde when
i wa not drunk with wine or ador i turn my mind to the make
of my peac with heaven of which i had some need
still i talk much with otomi instruct her in the matter of my
faith and mani other thing as i had done by marina who we now heard
wa the mistress and interpret of cort the spanish leader she for
her part listen grave watch me the while with her tender ey
but no more for of all women otomi wa the most modest as she wa the
proudest and most beauti
so matter went on until the spaniard had left cholula on their road
to mexico it wa then that i chanc on morn to be sit in the
garden my lute in hand and have my attend nobl and tutor
gather at a respect distanc behind me from where i sat i could
see the entranc to the court in which the emperor met hi council
daili and i note that when the princ had gone the priest began to
come and after them a number of veri love girl attend by women of
middl ag present guatemoc the princ who now smile but rare
came up to me smile and ask me if i knew what wa do yonder
i repli that i knew noth and care less but i suppos that
montezuma wa gather a peculiar treasur to send to hi master the
spaniard
bewar how you speak teul answer the princ haughtili your
word mai be true and yet did i not love you you should rue them even
though you hold the spirit of tezcat ala he ad stamp on the
ground ala that my uncl mad should make it possibl that such
word can be spoken oh were i emperor of anahuac in a singl week the
head of everi teul in cholula should deck a pinnacl of yonder templ
bewar how you speak princ i answer mock him for there ar
those who did thei hear might caus you to rue your word still on
dai you mai be emperor and then we shall see how you will deal with the
teul at least other will see though i shall not but what is it now
doe montezuma choos new wive
he choos wive but not for himself you know teul that your time
grow short montezuma and the priest name those who must be given to
you to wife
given me to wife i said start to my feet to me whose bride is
death what have i to do with love or marriag i who in some few short
week must grace an altar ah guatemoc you sai you love me and onc i
save you did you love me sure you would save me now as you swore to
do
i swore that i would give my life for your teul if it lai in my
power and that oath i would keep for all do not set so high a store on
life as you my friend but i cannot help you you ar dedic to the
god and did i die a hundr time it would not save you from your
fate noth can save you except the hand of heaven if it will
therefor teul make merri while you mai and die brave when you
must your case is no wors than mine and that of mani other for death
await us all farewel
when he had gone i rose and leav the garden i pass into the
chamber where it wa my custom to give audienc to those who wish to
look upon the god tezcat as thei call me here i sat upon my golden
couch inhal the fume of tobacco and as it chanc i wa alon for
none dare to enter that room unless i gave them leav present the
chief of my page announc that on would speak with me and i bent
my head signifi that the person should enter for i wa weari of my
thought the page withdrew and present a veil woman stood befor
me i look at her wonder and bade her draw her veil and speak she
obei and i saw that my visitor wa the princess otomi now i rose
amaz for it wa not usual that she should visit me thu alon i
guess therefor that she had tide or wa follow some custom of
which i wa ignor
i prai you be seat she said confusedli it is not fit that you
should stand befor me
why not princess i answer if i had no respect for rank sure
beauti must claim it
a truce to word she repli with a wave of her slim hand i come
here o tezcat accord to the ancient custom becaus i am charg
with a messag to you those whom you shall wed ar chosen i am the
bearer of their name
speak on princess of the otomi
thei areand she name three ladi whom i knew to be among the
loveliest in the land
i thought that there were four i said with a bitter laugh am i to
be defraud of the fourth
there is a fourth she answer and wa silent
give me her name i cri what other slut ha been found to marri a
felon doom to sacrific
on ha been found o tezcat who ha born other titl than thi you
give her
now i look at her questioningli and she spoke again in a low voic
i otomi princess of the otomi montezuma daughter am the fourth
and the first
you i said sink back upon my cushion you
ye i listen i wa chosen by the priest as the most love in the
land howev unworthili my father the emperor wa angri and said
that whatev befel i should never be the wife of a captiv who must
die upon the altar of sacrific but the priest answer that thi wa
no time for him to claim except for hi blood now when the god were
wroth wa the first ladi in the land to be withheld from the god thei
ask then my father sigh and said that it should be as i will and
i said with the priest that now in our sore distress the proud must
humbl themselv to the dust even to the marri of a captiv slave
who is name a god and doom to sacrific so i princess of the
otomi have consent to becom your wife o tezcat though perchanc
had i known all that i read in your ey thi hour i should not have
consent it mai happen that in thi shame i hope to find love if
onli for on short hour and that i purpos to vari the custom of our
peopl and to complet my marriag by the side of the victim on the
altar as if i will i have the right to do but i see well that i am
not welcom and though it is too late to go back upon my word have
no fear there ar other and i shall not troubl you i have given my
messag is it your pleasur that i should go the solemn ceremoni of
wedlock will be on the twelfth dai from now o tezcat
now i rose from my seat and took her hand sai
i thank you otomi for your nobl of mind had it not been for
the comfort and friendship which you and guatemoc your cousin have given
me i think that er now i should be dead so you desir to comfort me
to the last it seem that you even purpos to die with me how am i
to interpret thi otomi in our land a woman would need to love a
man after no common fashion befor she consent to share such a bed as
await me on yonder pyramid and yet i mai scarc think that you whom
king have su for can place your heart so low how am i to read the
write of your word princess of the otomi
read it with your heart she whisper low and i felt her hand
trembl in my own
i look at her beauti it wa great i thought of her devot a
devot that did not shrink from the most horribl of death and a
wind of feel which wa akin to love swept through my soul but even
as i look and thought i rememb the english garden and the english
maid from whom i had part beneath the beech at ditchingham and the
word that we had spoken then doubtless she still live and wa true to
me while i live should i not keep true at heart to her if i must wed
these indian girl i must wed them but if onc i told otomi that i
love her then i broke my troth and with noth less would she be
satisfi as yet though i wa deepli move and the temptat wa
great i had not come to thi
be seat otomi i said and listen to me you see thi golden
token and i drew lili posi ring from my hand and you see the
write within it
she bent her head but did not speak and i saw that there wa fear in
her ey
i will read you the word otomi and i translat into the aztec
tongu the quaint couplet
heart to heart though far apart
then at last she spoke what doe the write mean she said i can
onli read in pictur teul
it mean otomi that in the far land whenc i come there is a woman
who love me and who is my love
is she your wife then
she is not my wife otomi but she is vow to me in marriag
she is vow to you in marriag she answer bitterli why then we
ar equal for so am i teul but there is thi differ between us
you love her and me you do not love that is what you would make clear
to me spare me more word i understand all still it seem that if i
have lost she is also in the path of loss great sea roll between
you and thi love of your teul sea of water and the altar of
sacrific and the nothing of death now let me go your wife i must
be for there is no escap but i shall not troubl you over much and
it will soon be done with then you mai seek your desir in the hous
of the star whither you must wander and it is my prayer that you shall
win it all these month i have been plan to find hope for you and
i thought that i had found it but it wa built upon a fals belief and
it is end had you been abl to sai from your heart that you love
me it might have been well for both of us should you be abl to sai
it befor the end it mai still be well but i do not ask you to sai it
and bewar how you tell me a lie i leav you teul but befor i go
i will sai that i honour you more in thi hour than i have honour you
befor becaus you have dare to speak the truth to me montezuma
daughter when a lie had been so easi and so safe that woman beyond
the sea should be grate to you but though i bear her no ill will
between me and her there is a struggl to the death we ar stranger to
each other and stranger we shall remain but she ha touch your
hand as i touch it now you link us togeth and ar our bond of enmiti
farewel my husband that is to be we shall meet no more till that sorri
dai when a slut shall be given to a felon in marriag i us your
own word teul
then rise otomi cast her veil about her face and pass slowli
from the chamber leav me much disturb it wa a bold deed to have
reject the proffer love of thi queen among women and now that
i had done so i wa not altogeth glad would lili i wonder have
offer to descend from such state to cast off the purpl of her
royal rank that she might lie at my side on the red stone of sacrific
perhap not for thi fierc fidel is onli to be found in women of
anoth breed these daughter of the sun love wholli when thei love at
all and as thei love thei hate thei ask no priest to consecr their
vow nor if these becom hate will thei be bound by them for duti
sake their own desir is their law but while it rule them thei follow
it unflinchingli and if need be thei seek it consumm in the
gate of death or fail that forget
chapter xix
the four goddess
some weari time went by and at last came the dai of the entri into
mexico of cort and hi conqueror now of all the do of the
spaniard after thei occupi the citi i do not propos to speak at
length for these ar matter of histori and i have my own stori to
tell so i shall onli write of those of them with which i wa concern
myself i did not see the meet between montezuma and cort though
i saw the emperor set out to it clad like solomon in hi glori and
surround by hi nobl but i am sure of thi that no slave be
led to sacrific carri a heavier heart in hi breast than that of
montezuma on thi unlucki dai for now hi folli had ruin him and i
think he knew that he wa go to hi doom
afterward toward even i saw the emperor come back in hi golden
litter and pass over to the palac built by axa hi father that stood
opposit to and some five hundr pace from hi own face the western
gate of the templ present i heard the sound of a multitud shout
and amidst it the tramp of hors and arm soldier and from a seat
in my chamber i saw the spaniard advanc down the great street and my
heart beat at the sight of christian men in front clad in rich armour
rode their leader cort a man of middl size but nobl bear
with thought ey that note everyth and after him some few
on horseback but the most of them on foot march hi littl armi of
conqueror stare about them with bold wonder ey and jest to
each other in castilian thei were but a hand bronz with the sun
and scar by battl some of them illarm and almost in rag and
look on them i could not but marvel at the indomit courag
that had enabl them to pierc their wai through hostil thousand
sick and war even to the home of montezuma power
by the side of cort hold hi stirrup in her hand walk a
beauti indian woman dress in white robe and crown with flower
as she pass the palac she turn her face i knew her at onc it
wa my friend marina who now had attain to the great which she
desir and who notwithstand all the evil that she had brought upon
her countri look most happi in it and in her master love
as the spaniard went by i search their face on by on with the
vagu hope of hate for though it might well chanc that death had put
us out of each other reach i half thought to see de garcia among the
number of the conqueror such a quest as their with it promis of
blood and gold and rapin would certainli commend itself to hi evil
heart should it be in hi power to join it and a strang instinct told
me that he wa not dead but neither dead nor live wa he among those
men who enter mexico that dai
that night i saw guatemoc and ask him how thing went
well for the kite that roost in the dove nest he answer with a
bitter laugh but veri ill for the dove montezuma my uncl ha been
coo yonder and he point to the palac of axa and the captain of
the teul ha coo in answer but though he tri to hide it i could
hear the hawk shriek in hi pigeon note er long there will be
merri do in tenoctitlan
he wa right within a week montezuma wa treacher seiz by the
spaniard and kept a prison in their quarter watch dai and night
by their soldier then came event upon event certain lord in the
coast land have kill some spaniard were summon to mexico by the
instig of cort thei came and were burn aliv in the courtyard
of the palac nor wa thi all for montezuma their monarch wa
forc to wit the execut with fetter on hi ankl so low had
the emperor of the aztec fallen that he must bear chain like a common
felon after thi insult he swore allegi to the king of spain and
even contriv to captur cacama the lord of tezcuco by treacheri and
to deliv him into the hand of the spaniard on whom he would have
made war to them also he gave up all the hoard gold and treasur of
the empir to the valu of hundr of thousand of english pound all
thi the nation bore for it wa stupefi and still obei the command
of it captiv king but when he suffer the spaniard to worship the
true god in on of the sanctuari of the great templ a murmur of
discont and sullen furi rose among the thousand of the aztec it
fill the air it could be heard wherev men were gather and it
sound wa like that of a distant angri sea the hour of the break of
the tempest wa at hand
now all thi while my life went on as befor save that i wa not
allow to go outsid the wall of the palac for it wa fear lest
i should find some mean of intercours with the spaniard who did
not know that a man of white blood wa confin there and doom to
sacrific also in these dai i saw littl of the princess otomi
the chief of my destin bride who sinc our strang love scene had
avoid me and when we met at feast or in the garden spoke to me onli
on indiffer matter or of the affair of state at length came the
dai of my marriag it wa i rememb the night befor the massacr of
the six hundr aztec nobl on the occas of the festiv of huitzel
on thi my wed dai i wa treat with great circumst and
worship like a god by the highest in the citi who came in to do me
rever and burn incens befor me till i wa weari of the smell of
it for though such sorrow wa on the land the priest would abat no
jot of their ceremoni or cruelti and great hope were held that i
be of the race of teul my sacrific would avert the anger of the
god at sunset i wa entertain with a splendid feast that last two
hour or more and at it end all the compani rose and shout as with
on voic
glori to thee o tezcat happi art thou here on earth happi mayst thou
be in the hous of the sun when thou comest thither rememb that we
dealt well by thee give thee of our best and interced for us that
our sin mai be forgiven glori to thee o tezcat
then two of the chief nobl came forward and take torch led me to
a magnific chamber that i had never seen befor here thei chang my
apparel invest me in robe which were still more splendid than ani
that i had worn hitherto be made of the finest embroid cotton
and of the glitter feather of the hum bird on my head thei set
wreath of flower and about my neck and wrist emerald of vast size
and valu and a sorri popinjai i look in thi attir that seem
more suit to a woman beauti than to me
when i wa arrai suddenli the torch were extinguish and for a
while there wa silenc then in the distanc i heard women voic
sing a bridal song that wa beauti enough after it fashion
though i forbear to write it down the sing ceas and there came a
sound of rustl robe and of low whisper then a man voic spoke
sai
ar ye there ye chosen of heaven
and a woman voic i thought it wa that of otomi answer
we ar here
o maiden of anahuac said the man speak from the dark and
you o tezcat god among the god listen to my word maiden a great
honour ha been done to you for by the veri choic of heaven you have

ladi ar but shadow and symbol of the divin goddess your true

the voic paus then spoke again

sojourn with him dure hi stai on earth the god incarn take you
in marriag whom he himself creat that the symbol mai be perfect and
the mysteri fulfil yet lest your joi should be too fulllook now on
that which shall be
as the voic spoke these word mani torch sprang into flame at the
far end of the great chamber reveal a dread sight for there
stretch upon a stone of sacrific wa the bodi of a man but whether
the man live or wa model in wax i do not know to thi hour though
unless he wa paint i think that he must have been fashion in wax
sinc hi skin shone white like mine at the least hi limb and head
were held by five priest and a sixth stood over him clasp a knife
of obsidian in hi two hand it flash on high and as it gleam the
torch were extinguish then came the dull echo of a blow and a sound
of groan and all wa still till onc more the bride broke out into
their marriag song a strang chant and a wild and sweet though after
what i had seen and heard it had littl power to move me
thei sang on in the dark ever more loudli till present a singl
torch wa lit at the end of the chamber then anoth and anoth
though i could not see who lit them and the room wa a flare of light
now the altar the victim and the priest were all gone there wa no
on left in the place except myself and the four bride thei were tall
and love women all of them clad in white bridal robe star over
with gem and flower and wear on their brow the emblem of the
four goddess but otomi wa the stateliest and most beauti of the
four and seem in truth a goddess on by on thei drew near to me
smile and sigh and kneel befor me kiss my hand sai
i have been chosen to be your wife for a space tezcat happi maid that
i am mai the good god grant that i becom pleas to your sight so
that you mai love me as i worship you
then she who had spoken would draw back again out of earshot and the
next would take her place
last of all came otomi she knelt and said the word then ad in a
low voic
have spoken to you as the bride and goddess to the husband and the
god tezcat now o teul i speak as the woman to the man you do not
love me teul therefor if it is your will let us be divorc of our
own act who were wed by the command of other for so i shall be spare
some shame these ar friend to me and will not betrai us and she
nod toward her companion bride
as you will otomi i answer briefli
i thank you for your kind teul she said smile sadli and
withdrew make obeis look so state and so sweet as she went
that again my heart wa shaken as though with love now from that night
till the dread hour of sacrific no kiss or tender word pass
between me and the princess of the otomi and yet our friendship and
affect grew daili for we talk much togeth and i sought to turn
her heart to the true king of heaven but thi wa not easi for like
her father montezuma otomi clung to the god of her peopl though
she hate the priest and save when the victim were the foe of her
countri shrank from the rite of human sacrific which she said were
institut by the paba sinc in the earli dai there were no men
offer on the altar of the god but flower onli daili it grew and
ripen till although i scarc knew it at length in my heart after
lili i love her better than anyon on earth as for the other women
though thei were gentl and beauti i soon learn to hate them
still i feast and revel with them partli sinc i must or bring
them to a miser death becaus thei fail to pleas me and partli
that i might drown my terror in drink and pleasur for let it be
rememb that the dai left to me on earth were few and the aw end
drew near
the dai follow the celebr of my marriag wa that of the
shameless massacr of six hundr of the aztec nobl by the order of
the hidalgo alvarado whom cort had left in command of the spaniard
for at thi time cort wa absent in the coast land whither he had
gone to make war on narvaez who had been sent to subdu him by hi
enemi velasquez the governor of cuba
on thi dai wa celebr the feast of huitzel that wa held with
sacrific song and danc in the great court of the templ that
court which wa surround by a wall carv over with the writh
shape of snake it chanc that on thi morn befor he went to
join in the festiv guatemoc the princ came to see me on a visit of
ceremoni
i ask him if he intend to take part in the feast as the splendour
of hi apparel brought me to believ
ye he answer but why do you ask
becaus were i you guatemoc i would not go sai now will the
dancer be arm
no it is not usual
thei will be unarm guatemoc and thei ar the flower of the land
unarm thei will danc in yonder enclos space and the teul will
watch them arm now how would it be if these chanc to pick a
quarrel with the nobl
i do not know why you should speak thu teul for sure these white
men ar not cowardli murder still i take your word as an omen and
though the feast must be held for see alreadi the nobl gather i will
not share in it
you ar wise guatemoc i said i am sure that you ar wise
afterward otomi guatemoc and i went into the garden of the palac
and sat upon the crest of a small pyramid a teocal in miniatur that
montezuma had built for a place of outlook on the market and the court
of the templ from thi spot we saw the danc of the aztec nobl
and heard the song of the musician it wa a gai sight for in the
bright sunlight their feather dress flash like coat of gem and
none would have guess how it wa to end mingl with the dancer
were group of spaniard clad in mail and arm with sword and
matchlock but i note that as the time went on these men separ
themselv from the indian and began to cluster like bee about the
gate and at variou point under the shadow of the wall of serpent
now what mai thi mean i said to guatemoc and as i spoke i saw a
spaniard wave a white cloth in the air then in an instant befor the
cloth had ceas to flutter a smoke aros from everi side and with it
came the sound of the fire of matchlock everywher among the dancer
men fell dead or wound but the mass of them unharm as yet
huddl themselv togeth like frighten sheep and stood silent and
terrorstricken then the spaniard shout the name of their patron
saint as it is their custom to do when thei have some such wicked
in hand drew their sword and rush on the unarm aztec nobl
began to kill them now some shriek and fled and some stood still
till thei were cut down but whether thei stai or ran the end wa the
same for the gate were guard and the wall wa too high to climb
there thei were slaughter everi man of them and mai god who see
all reward their murder it wa soon over within ten minut of
the wave of the cloth those six hundr men were stretch upon the
pavement dead or dy and with shout of victori the spaniard were
despoil their corps of the rich ornament thei had worn
then i turn to guatemoc and said it seem that you did well not to
join in yonder revel
but guatemoc made no answer he stare at the dead and those who had
murder them and said noth onli otomi spoke you christian ar
a gentl peopl she said with a bitter laugh it is thu that you
repai our hospit now i trust that montezuma my father is pleas
with hi guest ah were i he everi man of them should lie on the
stone of sacrific if our god ar devil as you sai what ar those
who worship your
then at length guatemoc said onli on thing remain to us and that is
vengeanc montezuma ha becom a woman and i heed him no more nai
if it were need i would kill him with my own hand but two men ar
still left in the land cuitlahua my uncl and myself now i go to
summon our armi and he went
all that night the citi murmur like a swarm of wasp and next dai at
dawn so far as the ey could reach the street and market place were
fill with ten of thousand of arm warrior thei threw themselv
like a wave upon the wall of the palac of axa and like a wave from
a rock thei were driven back again by the fire of the gun thrice thei
attack and thrice thei were repuls then montezuma the woman king
appear upon the wall prai them to desist becaus forsooth did
thei succe he himself might perish even then thei obei him
so great wa their rever for hi sacr royalti and for a while
attack the spaniard no more but further than thi thei would not
go if montezuma forbad them to kill the spaniard at least thei
determin to starv them out and from that hour a strait blockad
wa kept up against the palac hundr of the aztec soldier had been
slain alreadi but the loss wa not all upon their side for some of the
spaniard and mani of the tlascalan had fallen into their hand as
for these unlucki prison their end wa swift for thei were taken at
onc to the templ of the great teocal and sacrif there to the
god in the sight of their comrad
now it wa that cort return with mani more men for he had conquer
narvaez whose follow join the standard of cort and with them
other on of whom i had good reason to know cort wa suffer to
rejoin hi comrad in the palac of axa without attack i do not know
why and on the follow dai cuitlahua montezuma brother king
of palapan wa releas by him that he might sooth the peopl but
cuitlahua wa no coward onc safe outsid hi prison wall he call
the council togeth of whom the chief wa guatemoc
there thei resolv on war to the end give it out that montezuma had
forfeit hi kingdom by hi cowardic and on that resolv thei act
had it been taken but two short month befor by thi date no spaniard
would have been left aliv in tenoctitlan for after marina the love of
cort whose subtl wit brought about hi triumph it wa montezuma
who wa the chief caus of hi own fall and of that of the kingdom of
anahuac
chapter xx
otomi counsel
on the dai after the return of cort to mexico befor the hour of
dawn i wa awaken from my uneasi slumber by the whistl cri of
thousand of warrior and the sound of atab and drum
hurri to my post of outlook on the littl pyramid where otomi
join me i saw that the whole peopl were gather for war so far
as the ey could reach in squar market place and street thei were
mass in thousand and ten of thousand some were arm with sling
some with bow and arrow other with javelin tip with copper
and the club set with spike of obsidian that is call maqua and yet
other citizen of the poorer sort with stake harden in the fire
the bodi of some were cover with golden coat of mail and mantl of
featherwork and their skull protect by paint wooden helm
crest with hair and fashion like the head of puma snake or
wolvesoth wore escaupil or coat of quilt cotton but the
most of them were nake except for a cloth about the loin on the flat
azotea or roof of hous also and even on the top of the teocal of
sacrific were band of men whose part it wa to rain missil into the
spanish quarter it wa a strang sight to see in that red sunris and
on never to be forgotten as the light flash from templ and palac
wall on to the glitter feather garment and gai banner the point
of countless spear and the armour of the spaniard who hurri to and
fro behind their battlement make readi their defenc
so soon as the sun wa up a priest blew a shrill note upon a shell
which wa answer by a trumpet call from the spanish quarter then
with a shriek of rage the thousand of the aztec rush to the attack
and the air grew dark with missil instantli a waver line of fire
and smoke follow by a sound as of thunder broke from the wall of
the palac of axa and the charg warrior fell like autumn leav
beneath the cannon and arquebuss ball of the christian
for a moment thei waver and a great groan went up to heaven but i saw
guatemoc spring forward a banner in hi hand and form up again thei
rush after him now thei were beneath the wall of the palac and the
assault began the aztec fought furious time upon time thei strove
to climb the wall pile up the bodi of the dead to serv them as
ladder and time upon time thei were repuls with cruel loss fail
in thi thei set themselv to batter it down with heavi beam but
when the breach wa made and thei cluster in it like herd sheep the
cannon open fire on them tear long lane through their mass and
leav them dead by score then thei took to the shoot of flame
arrow and by thi mean fire the outwork but the palac wa of
stone and would not burn thu for twelv long hour the struggl rage
unceasingli till the sudden fall of dark put an end to it and
the onli sight to be seen wa the flare of countless torch carri by
those who sought out the dead and the onli sound to be heard were the
voic of women lament and the groan of the dy
on the morrow the fight broke out again at dawn when cort salli
forth with the greater part of hi soldier and some thousand of
hi tlascalan alli at first i thought that he aim hi attack at
montezuma palac and a breath of hope went through me sinc then it
might becom possibl for me to escap in the confus but thi wa
not so hi object be to set fire to the hous from the flat roof
of which numberless missil were hail hourli upon hi follow
the charg wa desper and it succeed for the indian could not
withstand the shock of horsemen ani more than their nake skin could
turn the spaniard steel present score of hous were in flame
and thick column of smoke roll up like those that float from the
mouth of popo but mani of those who rode and ran from the gate of
axa did not come back thither for the aztec clung to the leg of
the hors and drag their rider awai live that veri dai these
captiv were sacrif on the altar of huitzel and in the sight of
their comrad and with them a hors wa offer up which had been
taken aliv and wa born and drag with infinit labour up the steep
side of the pyramid inde never had the sacrific been so mani as
dure these dai of combat all dai long the altar ran red and all
dai long the cri of the victim rang in my ear as the madden
priest went about their work for thu thei thought to pleas the god
who should give them victori over the teul
even at night the sacrific continu by the light of the sacr fire
that from below gave those who wrought them the appear of devil
flit through the flame of hell and inflict it torment on
the damn much as thei ar depict in the doom paint of the
resurrect of the dead that is over the chancel arch in thi church of
ditchingham and hour by hour through the dark a voic call out
threat and warn to the spaniard sai huitzel is hungri for
your blood ye teul ye shall sure follow where ye have seen your
fellow go the cage ar readi the knive ar sharp and the iron
ar hot for the tortur prepar ye teul for though ye slai mani ye
cannot escap
thu the struggl went on dai after dai till thousand of the aztec
were dead and the spaniard were well nigh worn out with hunger
war and wound for thei could not rest a singl hour at length on
morn when the assault wa at it hottest montezuma himself appear
upon the central tower of the palac clad in splendid robe and wear
the diadem befor him stood herald bear golden wand and about
him were the nobl who attend him in hi captiv and a guard of
spaniard he stretch out hi hand and suddenli the fight wa
stai and a silenc fell upon the place even the wound ceas from
their groan then he address the multitud what he said i wa too
far off to hear though i learn it purport afterward he prai hi
peopl to ceas from war for the spaniard were hi friend and guest
and would present leav the citi of tenoctitlan when these cowardli
word had pass hi lip a furi took hi subject who for long year
had worship him as a god and a shriek rent the air that seem to
sai two word onli
woman traitor
then i saw an arrow rush upward and strike the emperor and after the
arrow a shower of stone so that he fell down there upon the tower
roof
now a voic cri we have slain our king montezuma is dead and
instantli with a dread wail the multitud fled thi wai and that
so that present no live man could be seen where there had been
thousand
i turn to comfort otomi who wa watch at my side and had seen
her royal father fall and led her weep into the palac here we met
guatemoc the princ and hi mien wa fierc and wild he wa fulli
arm and carri a bow in hi hand
is montezuma dead i ask
i neither know nor care he answer with a savag laugh then ad
now curs me otomi my cousin for it wa my arrow that smote him
down thi king who ha becom a woman and a traitor fals to hi
manhood and hi countri
then otomi ceas weep and answer
i cannot curs you guatemoc for the god have smitten my father
with a mad as you smote him with your arrow and it is best that
he should die both for hi own sake and for that of hi peopl still
guatemoc i am sure of thi that your crime will not go unpunish
and that in payment for thi sacrileg you shall yourself come to a
shame death
it mai be so said guatemoc but at least i shall not die betrai
my trust and he went
now i must tell that as i believ thi wa my last dai on earth
for on the morrow my year of godhead expir and i thoma wingfield
should be led out to sacrific notwithstand all the tumult in the
citi the mourn for the dead and the fear that hung over it like a
cloud the ceremoni of religion and it feast were still celebr
strictli more strictli inde than ever befor thu on thi night a
festiv wa held in my honour and i must sit at the feast crown
with flower and surround by my wive while those nobl who remain
aliv in the citi did me homag and with them cuitlahua who if
montezuma were dead would now be emperor it wa a dreari meal enough
for i could scarc be gai though i strove to drown my woe in drink
and as for the guest thei had littl jolliti left in them hundr
of their rel were dead and with them thousand of the peopl the
spaniard still held their own in the fortress and that dai thei had
seen their emperor who to them wa a god smitten down by on of their
own number and abov all thei felt that doom wa upon themselv what
wonder that thei were not merri inde no funer feast could have been
more sad for flower and wine and fair women do not make pleasur and
after all it wa a funer feastfor me
at length it came to an end and i fled to my own apart whither my
three wive follow me for otomi did not come call me most happi
and bless who tomorrow should be with myself that is with my own
godhead in heaven but i did not call them bless for rise in
wrath i drove them awai sai that i had but on comfort left and it
wa that wherev i might go i should leav them behind
then i cast myself upon the cushion of my bed and mourn in my fear
and bitter of heart thi wa the end of the vengeanc which i had
sworn to wreak on de garcia that i myself must have my heart torn from
my breast and offer to a devil truli fonseca my benefactor had
spoken word of wisdom when he counsel me to take my fortun and
forget my oath had i done so todai i might have been my betroth
husband and happi in her love at home in peac england instead of
what i wa a lost soul in the power of fiend and about to be offer
to a fiend in the bitter of the thought and the extrem of my
anguish i wept aloud and prai to my maker that i might be deliv
from thi cruel death or at the least that my sin should be forgiven
me so that tomorrow night i might rest at peac in heaven
thu weep and prai i sank into a half sleep and dream that i
walk on the hillsid near the church path that run through the garden
of the lodg at ditchingham the whisper of the wind were in the tree
which cloth the bank of the vineyard hill the scent of the sweet
english flower wa in my nostril and the balmi air of june blew on my
brow it wa night in thi dream of mine and i thought that the moon
shone sweetli on the meadow and the river while from everi side came
the music of the nightingal but i wa not think of these delight
sight and sound though thei were present in my mind for my ey
watch the church path which goe up the hill at the back of the hous
and my heart listen for a footstep that i long to hear then there
came a sound of sing from beyond the hill and the word of the song
were sad for thei told of on who had sail awai and return no more
and present between the appl tree i saw a white figur on it crest
slowli it came toward me and i knew that it wa she for whom i wait
lili my belov now she ceas to sing but drew on gentli and her face
seem veri sad moreov it wa the face of a woman in middl life
but still most beauti more beauti inde than it had been in the
bloom of youth she had reach the foot of the hill and wa turn
toward the littl garden gate when i came forward from the shadow of
the tree and stood befor her back she start with a cry of fear
then grew silent and gaze into my face
so chang she murmur can it be the same thoma is it you
come back to me from the dead or is thi but a vision and slowli and
doubtingli the dream wraith stretch out her arm as though to clasp
me
then i awok i awok and lo befor me stood a fair woman cloth in
white on whom the moonlight shone as in my dream and her arm were
stretch toward me lovingli
it is i belov and no vision i cri spring from my bed and
clasp her to my breast to kiss her but befor my lip touch her i
saw my error for she whom i embrac wa not lili bozard my betroth
but otomi princess of the otomi who wa call my wife then i knew
that thi wa the saddest and the most bitter of dream that had been
sent to mock me for all the truth rush into my mind lose my hold
of otomi i fell back upon the bed and groan aloud and as i fell i
saw the flush of shame upon her brow and breast for thi woman love
me and thu my act and word were an insult to her who could guess
well what prompt them still she spoke gentli
pardon me teul i came but to watch and not to waken you i came also
that i mai see you alon befor the daybreak hope that i might be of
servic or at the least of comfort to you for the end draw near sai
then in your sleep did you mistak me for some other woman dearer and
fairer than i am that you would have embrac me
i dream that you were my betroth whom i love and who is far
awai across the sea i answer heavili but enough of love and such
matter what have i to do with them who go down into dark
in truth i cannot tell teul still i have heard wise men sai that if

the ey of the spirit you will see your dear befor anoth sun is set
and i prai that you mai find her faith to you tell me now how
much doe she love you would she have lain by your side on the bed of

moonlight as she spoke

the curtain swung behind her but the echo of her nobl word still
dwelt in my heart noth can make man look on death lovingli and that
await me wa on from which the bravest would shrink yet i felt that
otomi had spoken truth and that terribl as it seem it might prove
less terribl than life had shewn itself to be an unnatur calm fell
upon my soul like some dens mist upon the face of the ocean beneath
that mist the water might foam abov it the sun might shine yet
around wa on grei peac in thi hour i seem to stand outsid of my
earthli self and to look on all thing with a new sens the tide of
life wa eb awai from me the shore of death loom veri near and
i understood then as in extrem old ag i understand todai how much
more part we mortal have in death than in thi short accid of life
i could consid all my past i could wonder on the futur of my spirit
and even marvel at the gentl and wisdom of the indian woman who
wa abl to think such thought and utter them
well whatev befel in on thing i would not disappoint her i would
die brave as an englishman should do leav the rest to god these
barbarian should never sai of me that the foreign wa a coward who
wa i that i should complain did not hundr of men as good as i wa
perish daili in yonder squar and without a murmur had not my mother
di also at the hand of a murder wa not that unhappi ladi isabella
de siguenza wall up aliv becaus she had been mad enough to love a
villain who betrai her the world is full of terror and sorrow such
as mine who wa i that i should complain
so i muse on till at length the dai dawn and with the rise sun
rose the clamour of men make readi for battl for now the fight rage
from dai to dai and thi wa to be on of the most terribl but i
thought littl then of the war between the aztec and the spaniard
who must prepar myself for the struggl of my own death that wa now at
hand

farewel guatemoc i answer heaven prosper you for you ar a true
man
then we pass on
at the foot of the pyramid the process wa form and here on of my
wive bade me adieu after weep on my neck though i did not weep on
her now the road to the summit of the teocal wind round and round
the pyramid ever mount higher as it wind and along thi road we
went in solemn state at each turn we halt and anoth wife bade me a
last goodby or on of my instrument of music which i did not griev
to see the last of or some articl of my strang attir wa taken
from me at length after an hour march for our progress wa slow we
reach the flat top of the pyramid that is approach by a great stair
a space larger than the area of the churchyard here at ditchingham and
unfenc at it lofti edg here on thi dizzi place stood the templ
of huitzel and of tezcat soar structur of stone and wood within
which were place the horrid effigi of the god and dread chamber
stain with sacrific here too were the holi fire that burn
etern the sacrifici stone the implement of torment and the
huge drum of snake skin but for the rest the spot wa bare it wa
bare but not empti for on that side of it which look toward the
spanish quarter were station some hundr of men who hurl missil
into their camp without ceas on the other side also were gather a
concours of priest await the ceremoni of my death below the great
squar fring round with burntout hous wa crowd with thousand
of peopl some of them engag in combat with the spaniard but the
larger part collect there to wit my murder
now we reach the top of the pyramid two hour befor middai
for there were still mani rite to be carri out er the moment of
sacrific first i wa led into the sanctuari of tezcat the god whose
name i bore here wa hi statu or idol fashion in black marbl and
cover with golden ornament in the hand of thi idol wa a shield of
burnish gold on which it jewel ey were fix read there
as hi priest fabl all that pass upon the earth he had creat
befor him also wa a plate of gold which with mutter invoc the
head priest cleans as i watch rub it with hi long and mat
lock thi done he held it to my lip that i might breath on it and
i turn faint and sick for i knew that it wa be made readi to
receiv the heart which i felt beat in my breast
now what further ceremoni were to be carri out in thi unholi place
i do not know for at that moment a great tumult aros in the squar
beneath and i wa hurri from the sanctuari by the priest then i
perceiv thi gall to mad by the storm of missil rain upon
them from it crest the spaniard were attack the teocal alreadi
thei were pour across the courtyard in larg compani led by
cort himself and with them came mani hundr of their alli the
tlascalan on the other hand some thousand of the aztec were rush
to the foot of the first stairwai to give the white men battl there
five minut pass and the fight grew fierc again and again cover
by the fire of the arquebusi the spaniard charg the aztec but
their hors slip upon the stone pavement at length thei dismount
and continu the frai on foot slowli and with great slaughter the
indian were push back and the spaniard gain a foot on the first
stairwai but hundr of warrior still crowd the lofti wind road
and hundr more held the top and it wa plain that if the spaniard
won through at all the task would be a hard on still a fierc hope
smote me like a blow when i saw what wa toward if the spaniard took
the templ there would be no sacrific no sacrific could be offer
till middai so otomi had told me and that wa not for hard upon two
hour it came to thi then if the spaniard were victori within two
hour there wa a chanc of life for me if not i must die
now when i wa led out of the sanctuari of tezcat i wonder becaus
the princess otomi or rather the goddess atla as she wa then call
wa stand among the chief priest and disput with them for i had
seen her bow her head at the door of the holi place and thought that it
wa in token of farewel see that she wa the last of the four women
to leav me of what she disput i could not hear becaus of the din of
battl but the argument wa keen and it seem to me that the priest
were somewhat dismai at her word and yet had a fierc joi in them
it appear also that she won her caus for present thei bow
in obeis to her and turn slowli she swept to my side with a
peculiar majesti of gait that even then i note glanc up at her face
also i saw that it wa alight as though with a great and holi purpos
and moreov that she look like some happi bride pass to her
husband arm
why ar you not gone otomi i said now it is too late the
spaniard surround the teocal and you will be kill or taken
prison
i await the end whatev it mai be she answer briefli and we spoke
no more for a while but watch the progress of the frai which wa
fierc inde grimli the aztec warrior fought befor the symbol of
their god and in the sight of the vast concours of the peopl who
crowd the squar beneath and stare at the struggl in silenc thei
hurl themselv upon the spanish sword thei grip the spaniard
with their hand and scream with rage drag them to the steep side
of the roadwai purpos to cast them over sometim thei succeed
and a ball of men cling togeth would roll down the slope and be
dash to piec on the stone floor of the courtyard a spaniard
be in the centr of the ball but do what thei would like some
vast and writh snake still the long arrai of teul clad in their
glitter mail plough it wai upward through the storm of spear and
arrow minut by minut and step by step thei crept on fight as
men fight who know the fate that await the desecr of the god of
anahuac fight for life and honour and safeti from the stone of
sacrific thu an hour went by and the spaniard were half wai up
the pyramid louder and louder grew the fear sound of battl the
spaniard cheer and call on their patron saint to aid them the
aztec yell like wild beast the priest scream invoc to
their god and cri of encourag to the warrior while abov all
rose the rattl of the arquebuss the roar of the cannon and the
fear note of the great drum of snake skin on which a halfnak
priest beat madli onli the multitud below never move nor shout
thei stood silent gaze upward and i could see the sunlight flash on
the thousand of their stare ey
now all thi while i wa stand near the stone of sacrific with
otomi at my side round me were a ring of priest and over the stone
wa fix a squar of black cloth support upon four pole which were
set in socket in the pavement in the centr of thi black cloth wa
sewn a golden funnel measur six inch or so across at it mouth
and the sunbeam pass through thi funnel fell in a bright patch
the size of an appl upon the space of pavement that wa shade by the
cloth as the sun move in the heaven so did thi ring of light creep
across the shadow till at length it climb the stone of sacrific and
lai upon it edg
then at a sign from the head priest hi minist laid hold of me and
pluck what were left of my fine cloth from me as cruel boi pluck a
live bird till i stood nake except for the paint upon my bodi and a
cloth about my loin now i knew that my hour had come and strang
to tell for the first time thi dai courag enter into me and i
rejoic to think that soon i should have done with my tormentor
turn to otomi i began to bid her farewel in a clear voic when to
my amaz i saw that as i had been serv so she wa be serv for
her splendid robe were torn off her and she stood befor me arrai
in noth except her beauti her flow hair and a broider cotton
smock
do not wonder teul she said in a low voic answer the question
my tongu refus to frame i am your wife and yonder is our marriag
bed the first and last though you do not love me todai i die your
death and at your side as i have the right to do i could not save you
teul but at least i can die with you
at the moment i made no answer for i wa stricken silent by my wonder
and befor i could find my tongu the priest had cast me down and for
the second time i lai upon the stone of doom as thei held me a yell
fiercer and longer than ani which had gone befor told that the
spaniard had got foot upon the last stair of the ascent scarc had
my bodi been set upon the centr of the great stone when that of otomi
wa laid besid it so close that our side touch for i must lie in
the middl of the stone and there wa no great place for her then the
moment of sacrific not be come the priest made us fast with cord
which thei knot to copper ring in the pavement and turn to watch
the progress of the frai
for some minut we lai thu side by side and as we lai a great wonder
and gratitud grew in my heart wonder that a woman could be so brave
gratitud for the love she gave me seal it with her lifeblood
becaus otomi love me she had chosen thi fear death becaus she
love me so well that she desir to die thu at my side rather than
to live on in great and honour without me of a sudden in a moment
while i thought of thi marvel a new light shone upon my heart and it
wa chang toward her i felt that no woman could ever be so dear to
me as thi gloriou woman no not even my betroth i feltnai who
can sai what i did feel but i know thi that the tear rush to my
ey and ran down my paint face and i turn my head to look at her
she wa ly as much upon her left side as her hand would allow her
long hair fell from the stone to the pave where it lai in mass and
her face wa toward me so close wa it inde that there wa not an
inch between our lip
otomi i whisper listen to me i love you otomi now i saw her
breast heav beneath the band and the colour come upon her brow
then i am repaid she answer and our lip clung togeth in a kiss
the first and as we thought the last ye there we kiss on the
stone of sacrific beneath the knife of the priest and the shadow of
death and if there ha been a stranger love scene in the world i have
never heard it stori
oh i am repaid she said again i would gladli die a score of death
to win thi moment inde i prai that i mai die befor you take back
your word for teul i know well that there is on who is dearer to
you than i am but now your heart is soften by the faith of an
indian girl and you think that you love her let me die then believ
that the dream is true
talk not so i answer heavili for even at that moment the memori
of lili came into my mind you give your life for me and i love you for
it
my life is noth and your love is much she answer smile ah
teul what magic have you that you can bring me montezuma daughter
to the altar of the god and of my own free will well i desir no
softer bed and for the why and wherefor it will soon be known by both
of us and with it mani other thing
chapter xxii
the triumph of the cross
otomi i said present when will thei kill us
when the point of light li within the ring that is paint over your
heart she answer
now i turn my head from her and look at the sunbeam which pierc
the shadow abov us like a golden pencil it rest at my side about
six inch from me and i reckon that it would lie in the scarlet
ring paint upon my breast within some fifteen minut meanwhil the
clamour of battl grew louder and nearer shift myself so far as the
cord would allow i strain my head upward and saw that the spaniard
had gain the crest of the pyramid sinc the battl now rage upon it
edg and i have rare seen so terribl a fight for the aztec fought
with the furi of despair think littl of their own live if thei
could onli bring a spaniard to hi death but for the most part their
rude weapon would not pierc the coat of mail so that there remain
onli on wai to compass their desir name by cast the white men
over the edg of the teocal to be crush like eggshel upon the
pavement two hundr feet below thu the frai broke itself up into
group of foe who rent and tore at each other upon the brink of the
pyramid now and again to vanish down it side ten or twelv of them
togeth some of the priest also join in the fight think less of
their own death than of the desecr of their templ for i saw
on of them a man of huge strength and statur seiz a spanish soldier
round the middl and leap with him into space still though veri
slowli the spaniard and tlascalan forc their wai toward the centr
of the platform and as thei came the danger of thi dread end grew
less for the aztec must drag them further
now the fight drew near to the stone of sacrific and all who remain
aliv of the aztec perhap some two hundr and fifti of them besid
the priest ring themselv round us and it in a circl also the
outer rim of the sunbeam that fell through the golden funnel creep
on remorselessli touch my paint side which it seem to burn as hot
iron might for ala i could not command the sun to stand still while
the battl rage as did joshua in the vallei of ajalon when it touch
me five priest seiz my limb and head and the father of them he
who had conduct me from the palac clasp hi flint knife in both
hand now a deathli sick took me and i shut my ey dream that
all wa done but at that moment i heard a wildei man the chief of
the astronom whom i had note stand by call out to the minist
of death
not yet o priest of tezeat if you smite befor the sunbeam li upon
the victim heart your god ar doom and doom ar the peopl of
anahuac
the priest gnash hi teeth with rage and glare first at the creep
point of light and then over hi shoulder at the advanc battl
slowli the ring of warrior close in upon us slowli the golden rai
crept up my breast till it outer rim touch the red circl paint
upon my heart again the priest heav up hi aw knife again i shut
my ey and again i heard the shrill scream of the astronom not
yet not yet or your god ar doom
then i heard anoth sound it wa the voic of otomi cry for help
save us teul thei murder us she shriek in so pierc a note
that it reach the ear of the spaniard for on shout in answer
and in the castilian tongu on my comrad on the dog do murder on
their altar
then there wa a mighti rush and the defend aztec were swept in upon
the altar lift the priest of sacrific from hi feet and throw
him across my bodi thrice that rush came like a rush of the sea and
each time the stand of the aztec weaken now their circl wa broken
and the sword of the spaniard flash up on everi side and now the
red rai lai within the ring upon my heart
smite priest of tezcat scream the voic of the astronom smite
home for the glori of your god
with a fear yell the priest lift the knife i saw the golden
sunbeam that rest full upon my heart shine on it then as it wa
descend i saw the same sunbeam shine upon a yard of steel that
flash across me and lost itself in the breast of the murder priest
down came the great flint knife but it aim wa lost it struck inde
but not upon my bosom though i did not escap it altogeth full upon
the altar of sacrific it fell and wa shatter there pierc between
my side and that of otomi and gash the flesh of both so that our
blood wa mingl upon the stone make us on inde down too came
the priest across our bodi for the second time but to rise no more
for he writh dy on those whom he would have slain
then as in a dream i heard the wail of the astronom sing the dirg
of the god of anahuac
the priest is dead and hi god ar fallen he cri tezcat ha
reject hi victim and is fallen doom ar the god of anahuac
victori is to the cross of the christian
thu he wail then came the sound of sword blow and i knew that thi
prophet wa dead also
now a strong arm pull the dy priest from off us and he stagger
back till he fell over the altar where the etern fire burn
quench it with hi blood and bodi after it had flare for mani
gener and a knife cut the rope that bound us
i sat up stare round me wildli and a voic spoke abov me in
castilian not to me inde but to some comrad
these two went near to it poor devil said the voic had my cut
been on second later that savag would have drill a hole in him as
big as my head by all the saint the girl is love or would be if
she were wash i shall beg her of cort as my prize
the voic spoke and i knew the voic none other ever had that hard
clear ring i knew it even then and look up slip off the
deathston as i look now i saw befor me fulli clad in mail wa my
enemi de garcia it wa hi sword that by the good provid of god
had pierc the breast of the priest he had save me who had he known
would as soon have turn hi steel against hi own heart as on that of
my destroy
i gaze at him wonder if i dream then my lip spoke without my
will as it were
de garcia
he stagger back at the sound of my voic like a man struck by a shot
then stare at me rub hi ey with hi hand and stare again now
at length he knew me through my paint
mother of god he gasp it is that knave thoma wingfield and i
have save hi life
by thi time my sens had come back to me and know all my folli i
turn seek escap but de garcia had no mind to suffer thi lift
hi sword he sprang at me with a beastlik scream of rage and hate
swiftli as thought i slip round the stone of sacrific and after me
came the uplift sword of my enemi it would have overtaken me soon
enough for i wa weak with fear and fast and my limb were cramp
with bond but at that moment a cavali whom by hi dress and port
i guess to be none other than cort himself struck up de garcia
sword sai
how now sarceda ar you mad with the lust of blood that you would
take to sacrif victim like an indian priest let the poor devil
go
he is no indian he is an english spy cri de garcia and onc more
struggl to get at me
decidedli our friend is mad said cort scan me he sai that
thi wretch creatur is an englishman come be off both of you or
somebodi els mai make the same mistak and he wave hi sword in
token to us to go deem that i could not understand hi word then
ad angrili as de garcia speechless with rage made a new attempt to
get at me
no by heaven i will not suffer it we ar christian and come to
save victim not to slai them here comrad hold thi fool who would
stain hi soul with murder
now the spaniard clutch de garcia by the arm and he curs and
rave at them for as i have said hi rage wa that of a beast rather
than of a man but i stood bewild not know whither to fly
fortun it wa for me inde that on wa by who though she understood
no spanish yet had a quicker wit for while i stood thu otomi
clasp my hand and whisper fly fly swiftli led me awai from
the stone of sacrific
whither shall we go i said at length were it not better to trust to
the merci of the spaniard
to the merci of that mandevil with the sword she answer peac
teul and follow me
now she led me on and the spaniard let us by unharm ay and even
spoke word of piti as we pass for thei knew that we were victim
snatch from sacrific inde when a certain brute a tlascalan
indian rush at us purpos to slai us with a club on of the
spaniard ran him through the shoulder so that he fell wound to the
pavement
so we went on and at the edg of the pyramid we glanc back and saw
that de garcia had broken from those who held him or perhap he found
hi tongu and had explain the truth to them at the least he wa
bound from the altar of sacrific nearli fifti yard awai and come
toward us with uplift sword then fear gave us strength and we fled
like the wind along the steep path we rush side by side leap down
the step and over the hundr of dead and dy onli paus now and
again to save ourselv from be smitten into space by the bodi
of the priest whom the spaniard were hurl from the crest of the
teocal onc look up i caught sight of de garcia pursu far
abov us but after that we saw him no more doubtless he weari of the
chase or fear to fall into the hand of such of the aztec warrior as
still cluster round the foot of the pyramid
we had live through mani danger that dai the princess otomi and i
but on more await us befor ever we found shelter for awhil after
we had reach the foot of the pyramid and turn to mingl with the
terrifi rabbl that surg and flow through the courtyard of the
templ bear awai the dead and wound as the sea at flood reclaim
it wast and wreckag a nois like thunder caught my ear i look
up for the sound came from abov and saw a huge mass bound down the
steep side of the pyramid even then i knew it again it wa the idol of
the god tezcat that the spaniard had torn from it shrine and like
an aveng demon it rush straight on to me alreadi it wa upon us
there wa no retreat from instant death we had but escap sacrific
to the spirit of the god to be crush to powder beneath the bulk of
hi marbl emblem on he came while on high the spaniard shout in
triumph hi base had struck the stone side of the pyramid fifti feet
abov us now he whirl round and round in the air to strike again
within three pace of where we stood i felt the solid mountain
shake beneath the blow and next instant the air wa fill with huge
fragment of marbl that whizz over us and past us as though a mine
of powder had been fire beneath our feet tear the rock from their
base the god tezcat had burst into a score of piec and these fell
round us like a flight of arrow and yet we were not touch my head
wa graze by hi head hi feet dug a pit befor my feet but i stood
there unhurt the fals god had no power over the victim who had escap
him
after that i rememb noth till i found myself onc more in my
apart in montezuma palac which i never hope to see again
otomi wa by me and she brought me water to wash the paint from my
bodi and the blood from my wound which leav her own untend she
dress skilfulli for the cut of the priest knife wa deep and i had
bled much also she cloth herself afresh in a white robe and brought
me raiment to wear with food and drink and i partook of them then i
bade her eat someth herself and when she had done so i gather my
wit togeth and spoke to her
what next i said present the priest will be on us and we shall
be drag back to sacrific there is no hope for me here i must fly
to the spaniard and trust to their merci
to the merci of that man with the sword sai teul who is he
he is that spaniard of whom i have spoken to you otomi he is my
mortal enemi whom i have follow across the sea
and now you would put yourself into hi power truli you ar foolish
teul
it is better to fall into the hand of christian men than into those of
your priest i answer
have no fear she said the priest ar harmless for you you have
escap them and there an end few have ever come aliv from their
clutch befor and he who doe so is a wizard inde for the rest i
think that your god is stronger than our god for sure he must have
cast hi mantl over us when we lai yonder on the stone ah teul to
what have you brought me that i should live to doubt my god ay and to
call upon the foe of my countri for succour in your need believ me i
had not done it for my own sake sinc i would have di with your kiss
upon my lip and your word of love echo in my ear who now must live
know that these joi have pass from me
how so i answer what i have said i have said otomi you would
have di with me and you save my life by your wit in call on the
spaniard henceforth it is your for there is no other woman in the
world so tender and so brave and i sai it again otomi my wife i
love you our blood ha mingl on the stone of sacrific and there
we kiss let these be our marriag rite perhap i have not long to
live but till i die i am your otomi my wife
thu i spoke from the ful of my heart for my strength and courag
were shatter horror and loneli had taken hold of me but two
thing were left to me in the world my trust in provid and the love
of thi woman who had dare so much for me therefor i forgot my
troth and clung to her as a child cling to it mother doubtless it wa
wrong but i will be bold to sai that few men so place would have act
otherwis moreov i could not take back the fate word that i had
spoken on the stone of sacrific when i said them i wa expect death
inde but to renounc them now that it shadow wa lift from me if
onli for a littl while would have been the act of a coward for good
or evil i had given myself to montezuma daughter and i must abid by
it or be shame still such wa the nobl of thi indian ladi that
even then she would not take me at my word for a littl while she stood
smile sadli and draw a lock of her long hair through the hollow of
her hand then she spoke
you ar not yourself teul and i should be base inde if i made so
solemn a compact with on who doe not know what he sell yonder on the
altar and in a moment of death you said that you love me and doubtless
it wa true but now you have come back to life and sai lord who set
that golden ring upon your hand and what is written in it circl
yet even if the word ar true that you have spoken and you love me a
littl there is on across the sea whom you love better that i could
bear for my heart is fix on you alon among men and at the least you
would be kind to me and i should move in the sunlight of your presenc
but have known the light i cannot live to wander in the dark you
do not understand i will tell you what i fear i fear that ifif we
were wed you would weari of me as men do and that memori would grow
too strong for you then by and by it might be possibl for you to find
your wai back across the water to your own land and your own love and
so you would desert me teul thi is what i could not bear teul
i can forego you now ay and remain your friend but i cannot be put
asid like a danc girl the companion of a month i montezuma
daughter a ladi of my own land should you wed me it must be for my
life teul and that is perhap more than you would wish to promis
though you could kiss me on yonder stone and there is blood fellowship
between us and she glanc at the red stain in the linen robe that
cover the wound upon her side
and now teul i leav you a while that i mai find guatemoc if he
still live and other who now that the strength of the priest is
shatter have power to protect you and advanc you to honour think
then on all that i have said and do not be hasti to decid or would
you make an end at onc and fly to the white men if i can find a mean
of escap
i am too weari to fly anywher i answer even if i could
moreov i forget my enemi is among the spaniard he whom i have
sworn to kill therefor hi friend ar my foe and hi foe my
friend i will not fly otomi
there you ar wise she said for if you come among the teul that
man will murder you by fair mean or foul he will murder you within a
dai i saw it in hi ey now rest while i seek your safeti if there
is ani safeti in thi bloodstain land
chapter xxiii
thoma is marri
otomi turn and went i watch the golden curtain close behind her
then i sank back upon the couch and instantli wa lost in sleep for
i wa faint and weak and so daze with weari that at the time i
scarc knew what had happen or the purpos of our talk afterward
howev it came back to me i must have slept for mani hour for when
i awok it wa far on into the night it wa night but not dark for
through the bar window place came the sound of tumult and fight
and red rai of light cast by the flame of burn hous on of these
window wa abov my couch and stand on the bed i seiz the sill
with my hand with much pain becaus of the flesh wound in my side i
drew myself up till i could look through the bar then i saw that the
spaniard not content with the captur of the teocal had made a
night attack and set fire to hundr of hous in the citi the glare
of the flame wa that of a lurid dai and by it i could see the white
men retreat to their quarter pursu by thousand of aztec who
hung upon their flank shoot at them with stone and arrow
now i drop down from the window place and began to think as to what
i should do for again my mind wa waver should i desert otomi and
escap to the spaniard if that were possibl take my chanc of death
at the hand of de garcia or should i stai among the aztec if thei
would give me shelter and wed otomi there wa a third choic inde
to stai with them and leav otomi alon though it would be difficult
to do thi and keep my honour on thing i understood if i marri
otomi it must be at her own price for then i must becom an indian and
give over all hope of return to england and to my betroth of thi
inde there wa littl chanc still while my life remain to me
it might come about if i wa free but onc my hand were ti by thi
marriag it could never be dure otomi lifetim and so far as lili
bozard wa concern i should be dead how could i be thu faithless to
her memori and my troth and on the other hand how could i discard the
woman who had risk all for me and who to speak truth had grown so
dear to me though there wa on yet dearer a hero or an angel might
find a path out of thi tangl but ala i wa neither the on nor the
other onli a man afflict as other men ar with human weak and
otomi wa at hand and veri sweet and fair still almost i determin
that i would avail myself of her nobl that i would go back upon
my word and beg her to despis me and see me no more in order that
i might not be forc to break the troth that i had pledg beneath
the beech at ditchingham for i greatli dread thi oath of lifelong
fidel which i should be forc to swear if i chose ani other path
thu i thought on in pitiabl confus of mind not know that all
these matter were beyond my order sinc a path wa alreadi made
readi to my feet which i must follow or die and let thi be a proof
of the honesti of my word sinc had i been desir of gloze the
truth i need have written noth of these struggl of conscienc and
of my own weak for soon it wa to come to thi though not by her
will that i must either wed otomi or die at onc and few would blame
me for do the first and not the last inde though i did wed her i
might still have declar myself to my affianc and to all the world as
a slave of event from which there wa no escap but it is not all the
truth sinc my mind wa divid and had it not been settl for me i
cannot sai how the struggl would have end
now look back on the distant past and weigh my action and
charact as a judg might do i can see howev that had i found time
to consid there wa anoth matter which would sure have turn
the scale in favour of otomi de garcia wa among the spaniard and
my hatr of de garcia wa the rule passion of my life a stronger
passion even than my love for the two dear women who have been it joi
inde though he is dead these mani year i still hate him and evil
though the desir be even in my ag i long that my vengeanc wa still
to wreak while i remain among the aztec de garcia would be their
enemi and mine and i might meet him in war and kill him there but if i
succeed in reach the spanish camp then it wa almost sure that he
would bring about my instant death doubtless he had told such a tale of
me alreadi that within an hour i should be hung as a spy or otherwis
made awai with
but i will ceas from these unprofit wonder which have but on
valu that of set out my strang necess of choic between an
absent and a present love and go on with the stori of an event in which
there wa no room to balanc scrupl
while i sat muse on the couch the curtain wa drawn and a man enter
bear a torch it wa guatemoc as he had come from the frai which
except for it harvest of burn hous wa finish for that night
the plume were shorn from hi head hi golden armour wa hack by the
spanish sword and he bled from a shot wound in the neck
greet teul he said certainli i never thought to see you aliv
tonight or myself either for that matter but it is a strang world
and now if never befor in tenoctitlan those thing happen for which
we look the least but i have no time for word i came to summon you
befor the council
what is to be my fate i ask to be drag back to the stone of
sacrific
nai have no fear of that but for the rest i cannot sai in an hour
you mai be dead or great among us if ani of us can be call great in
these dai of shame otomi ha work well for you among the princ
and the counsellor so she sai and if you have a heart you should be
grate to her for it seem to me that few women have love a man so
much as for me i have been emploi elsewher and he glanc at hi
rent armour but i will lift up my voic for you now come friend for
the torch burn low by thi time you must be well season in danger
on more or less will matter as littl to you as to me
then i rose and follow him into the great cedarpanel hall where
that veri morn i had receiv ador as a god now i wa a god no
longer but a prison on trial for hi life upon the dai where i had
stood in the hour of my godhead were gather those of the princ and
counsellor who were left aliv some of them like guatemoc were clad
in rent and bloodi mail other in their customari dress and on in
a priest robe thei had onli two thing in common among them the
stern of their face and the great of their rank and thei sat
there thi night not to decid my fate which wa but a littl thing
but to take counsel as to how thei might expel the spaniard befor the
citi wa destroi
when i enter a man in mail who sat in the centr of the half circl
and in whom i knew cuitlahua who would be emperor should montezuma die
look up quickli and said
who is thi guatemoc that you bring with you ah i rememb the
teul that wa the god tezcat and who escap the sacrific todai
listen nobl what is to be done with thi man sai is it law that
he be led back to sacrific
then the priest answer i griev to sai that it is not law most
nobl princ thi man ha lain on the altar of the god he ha even
been wound by the holi knife but the god reject him in a fate
hour and he must lie there no more slai him if you will but not upon
the stone of sacrific
what then shall be done with him said the princ again
he is of the blood of the teul and therefor an enemi on thing is
certain he must not be suffer to join the white devil and give
them tide of our distress is it not best that he be put awai
forthwith
now sever of the council nod their head but other sat silent
make no sign
come said cuitlahua we have no time to wast over thi man when the
live of thousand ar hourli at stake the question is shall the teul
be slain
then guatemoc rose and spoke sai your pardon nobl kinsman but
i hold that we mai put thi prison to better us than to kill him i
know him well he is brave and loyal as i have prove moreov he is
not all a teul but half of anoth race that hate them as he hate
them also he ha knowledg of their custom and mode of warfar which
we lack and i think that he mai be abl to give us good counsel in our
strait
the counsel of the wolf to the deer perhap said cuitlahua coldli
counsel that shall lead us to the fang of the teul who shall answer
for thi foreign devil that he will not betrai us if we trust him
i will answer with my life answer guatemoc
your life is of too great worth to be set on such a stake nephew men
of thi white breed ar liar and hi own word is of no valu even if
he give it i think that it will be best to kill him and have done with
doubt
thi man is wed to otomi princess of the otomi montezuma
daughter your niec said guatemoc again and she love him so well
that she offer herself upon the stone of sacrific with him unless i
mistak she will answer for him also shall she be summon befor you
if you wish nephew but a woman in love is a blind woman and
doubtless he ha deceiv her also moreov she wa hi wife accord
to the rule of religion onli is it your desir that the princess should
be summon befor you comrad
now some said nai but the most those whose interest otomi had gain
said yea and the end of it wa that on of their number wa sent to
summon her
present she came look veri weari but proud in mien and royal
attir and bow befor the council
thi is the question princess said cuitlahua whether thi teul
shall be slain forthwith or whether he shall be sworn as on of us
should he be will to take the oath the princ guatemoc here vouch
for him and he sai moreov that you will vouch for him also a
woman can do thi in on wai onli by take him she vouch as her
husband you ar alreadi wed to thi foreign by the rule of religion
ar you will to marri him accord to the custom of our land and to
answer for hi faith with your own life
i am will otomi answer quietli if he is will
in truth it is a great honour that you would do thi white dog said
cuitlahua bethink you you ar princess of the otomi and on of our
master daughter it is to you that we look to bring back the mountain
clan of the otomi of whom you ar chieftai from their unholi
allianc with the accurs tlascalan the slave of the teul is not
your life too preciou to be set on such a stake as thi foreign
faith for learn otomi if he prove fals your rank shall not help
you
i know it all she repli quietli foreign or not i love thi
man and i will answer for him with my blood moreov i look to him to
assist me to win back the peopl of the otomi to their allegi but
let him speak for himself my lord it mai happen that he ha no desir
to take me in marriag
cuitlahua smile grimli and said when the choic li between the
breast of death and those fair arm of your niec it is easi to guess
hi answer still speak teul and swiftli
i have littl to sai lord if the princess otomi is will to wed
me i am will to wed her i answer and thu in the moment of my
danger all my doubt and scrupl vanish as cuitlahua had said it
wa easi to guess the choic of on set between death and otomi
she heard and look at me warningli sai in a low voic rememb
our word teul in such a marriag you renounc your past and give me
your futur
i rememb i answer and while i spoke there came befor my ey a
vision of lili face as it had been when i bade her farewel thi then
wa the end of the vow that i had sworn cuitlahua look at me with a
glanc which seem to search my heart and said
i hear your word teul you a white wander ar gracious will
to take thi princess to wife and by her to be lift high among the
great lord of thi land but sai how can we trust you if you fail us
your wife di inde but that mai be naught to you
i am readi to swear allegi i answer i hate the spaniard
and among them is my bitterest enemi whom i follow across the sea to
killth man who strove to murder me thi veri dai i can sai no more
if you doubt my word it were best to make an end of me alreadi i have
suffer much at the hand of your peopl it matter littl if i die or
live
boldli spoken teul now lord i ask your judgment shall thi man
be given to otomi as husband and be sworn as on of us or shall he be
kill instantli you know the matter if he can be trust as guatemoc
and otomi believ he will be worth an armi to us for he is acquaint
with the languag the custom the weapon and the mode of warfar of
these white devil whom the god have let loos upon us if on the other
hand he is not to be trust and it is hard for us to put faith in on
of hi blood he mai do us much injuri for in the end he will escap to
the teul and betrai our counsel and our strength or the lack of it
it is for you to judg lord
now the councillor consult togeth and some said on thing and
some anoth for thei were not by ani mean of a mind in the matter
at length grow weari cuitlahua call on them to put the question to
the vote and thi thei did by a lift of hand first those who were
in favour of my death held up their hand then those who thought that
it would be wise to spare me there were twentysix councillor present
not count cuitlahua and of these thirteen vote for my execut and
thirteen were for save me aliv
now it seem that i must give a cast vote said cuitlahua when the
tale had been render and my blood turn cold at hi word for i had
seen that hi mind wa set against me then it wa that otomi broke in
sai
your pardon my uncl but befor you speak i have a word to sai
you need my servic do you not for if the peopl of the otomi will
listen to ani and suffer themselv to be led from their evil path it
is to me my mother wa by birth their chieftai the last of a long
line and i am her onli child moreov my father is their emperor
therefor my life is of no small worth now in thi time of troubl for
though i am noth in myself yet it mai chanc that i can bring thirti
thousand warrior to your standard the priest knew thi on yonder
pyramid and when i claim my right to lie at the side of the teul
thei gainsai me nor would thei suffer it though thei hunger for
the royal blood till i call down the vengeanc of the god upon them
now my uncl and you lord i tell you thi slai yonder man if you
will but know that then you must find anoth than me to lure the
otomi from their rebellion for then i complet what i began todai
and follow him to the grave
she ceas and a murmur of amaz went round the chamber for none
had look to find such love and courag in thi ladi heart onli
cuitlahua grew angri
disloy girl he said do you dare to set your lover befor your
countri shame upon you shameless daughter of our king why it is
in the blooda the father is so is the daughter did not montezuma
forsak hi peopl and choos to lie among these teul the fals
children of quetzal and now thi otomi follow in hi path tell
us how is it woman that you and your lover alon escap from the
teocal yonder when all the rest were kill ar you then in leagu
with these teul i sai to you niec that if thing were otherwis
and i had my wai you should win your desir inde for you should be
slain at thi man side and within the hour and he ceas for lack of
breath and look upon her fierc
but otomi never quail she stood befor him pale and quiet with
fold hand and downcast ey and answer
forbear to reproach me becaus my love is strong or reproach me if you
will i have spoken my last word condemn thi man to die and princ
you must seek some other envoi to win back the otomi to the caus of
anahuac
now cuitlahua ponder stare into the gloom abov him and pull at
hi beard and the silenc wa great for none knew what hi judgment
would be at last he spoke
so be it we have need of otomi my niec and it is of no avail to
fight against a woman love teul we give you life and with the
life honour and wealth and the greatest of our women in marriag and a
place in our council take these gift and her but i sai to you both
bewar how you us them if you betrai us nai if you do but think
on treacheri i swear to you that you shall die a death so slow and
horribl that the veri name of it would turn your heart to water you
and your wife your children and your servant come let him be sworn
i heard and my head swam and a mist gather befor my ey onc again
i wa save from instant death
present it clear and look up my ey met those of the woman who
had save me otomi my wife who smile upon me somewhat sadli then
the priest came forward bear a wooden bowl carv about with strang
sign and a flint knife and bade me bare my arm he cut my flesh with
the knife so that blood ran from it into the bowl some drop of thi
blood he empti on to the ground mutter invoc the while then
he turn and look at cuitlahua as though in question and cuitlahua
answer with a bitter laugh
let him be baptiz with the blood of the princess otomi my niec for
she is bail for him
nai lord said guatemoc these two have mingl blood alreadi
upon the stone of sacrific and thei ar man and wife but i also have
vouch for him and i offer mine in earnest of my faith
thi teul ha good friend said cuitlahua you honour him overmuch
but so be it
then guatemoc came forward and when the priest would have cut him with
the knife he laugh and said point to the bullet wound upon hi
neck
no need for that priest blood run here that wa shed by the teul
none can be fitter for thi purpos
so the priest drew awai the bandag and suffer the blood of guatemoc
to drop into a second smaller bowl then he came to me and dip hi
finger into the blood he drew the sign of a cross upon my forehead as a
christian priest draw it upon the forehead of an infant and said
in the presenc and the name of god our lord who is everywher and
see all thing i sign you with thi blood and make you of thi blood
in the presenc and the name of god our lord who is everywher and see
all thing i pour forth your blood upon the earth here he pour
as he spoke as thi blood of your sink into the earth so mai the
memori of your past life sink and be forgotten for you ar born again
of the peopl of anahuac in the presenc and the name of god our lord
who is everywher and see all thing i mingl these blood here
he pour from on bowl into the other and with them i touch your
tongu here dip hi finger into the bowl he touch the tip of my
tongu with it and bid you swear thu
mai everi evil to which the flesh of man is subject enter into my
flesh mai i live in miseri and die in torment by the dread death
mai my soul be reject from the hous of the sun mai it wander
homeless for ever in the dark that is behind the star if i depart
from thi my oath i teul swear to be faith to the peopl of
anahuac and to their law governor i swear to wage war upon their
foe and to compass their destruct and more especi upon the
teul till thei ar driven into the sea i swear to offer no affront to
the god of anahuac i swear myself in marriag to otomi princess of
the otomi the daughter of montezuma my lord for so long as her life
shall endur i swear to attempt no escap from these shore i swear to
renounc my father and my mother and the land where i wa born and to
cling to thi land of my new birth and thi my oath shall endur till
the volcan popo ceas to vomit smoke and fire till there is no king
in tenoctitlan till no priest serv the altar of the god and the
peopl of anahuac ar no more a peopl
do you swear these thing on and all
on and all i swear them i answer becaus i must though there wa
much in the oath that i like littl enough and yet mark how strang
thing came to pass within fifteen year from that night the volcan
popo had ceas to vomit smoke and fire the king had ceas to reign
in tenoctitlan the priest had ceas to serv the altar of the god
the peopl of anahuac were no more a peopl and my vow wa null
and void yet the priest who frame thi form chose these thing as
exampl of what wa immort
when i had sworn guatemoc came forward and embrac me sai
welcom teul my brother in blood and heart now you ar on of us
and we look to you for help and counsel come be seat by me
i look toward cuitlahua doubtfulli but he smile gracious and
said teul your trial is over we have accept you and you have
sworn the solemn oath of brotherhood to break which is to die horribl
in thi world and to be tortur through etern by demon in the
next forget all that mai have been said in the hour of your weigh
for the balanc is in your favour and be sure that if you give us no
caus to doubt you you shall find none to doubt us now as the husband
of otomi you ar a lord among the lord have honour and great
possess and as such be seat by your brother guatemoc and join
our council
i did as he bade me and otomi withdrew from our presenc then
cuitlahua spoke again no longer of me and my matter but of the urgent
affair of state he spoke in slow word and weighti and more than onc
hi voic broke in hi sorrow he told of the grievou misfortun
that had overcom the countri of the death of hundr of it bravest
warrior of the slaughter of the priest and soldier that dai on the
teocal and the desecr of hi nation god what wa to be done
in thi extrem he ask montezuma lai dy a prison in the camp
of the teul and the fire that he had nurs with hi breath devour
the land no effort of their could break the iron strength of these
white devil arm as thei were with strang and terribl weapon dai
by dai disast overtook the arm of the aztec what wisdom had thei
now that the protect god were shatter in their veri shrine when
the altar ran red with the blood of their minist priest when the
oracl were dumb or answer onli in the accent of despair
then on by on princ and gener aros and gave counsel accord
to their light at length all had spoken and cuitlahua said look
toward me
we have a new counsellor among us who is skill in the warfar and
custom of the white men who till an hour ago wa himself a white man
ha he no word of comfort for us
speak my brother said guatemoc
then i spoke most nobl cuitlahua and you lord and princ you
honour me by ask my counsel and it is thi in few word and brief
you wast your strength by hurl your armi continu against stone
wall and the weapon of the teul so you shall not prevail against
them your devic must be chang if you would win victori the
spaniard ar like other men thei ar no god as the ignor imagin
and the creatur on which thei ride ar not demon but beast of
burden such as ar us for mani purpos in the land where i wa born
the spaniard ar men i sai and do not men hunger and thirst cannot
men be worn out by want of sleep and be kill in mani wai ar not
these teul alreadi weari to the death thi then is my word of comfort
to you ceas to attack the spaniard and invest their camp so close
that no food can reach them and their alli the tlascalan if thi is
done within ten dai from now either thei will surrend or thei will
strive to break their wai back to the coast but to do thi first thei
must win out of the citi and if dyke ar cut through the causewai
that will be no easi matter then when thei strive to escap cumber
with the gold thei covet and came here to seek then i sai will be the
hour to attack them and to destroi them utterli
i ceas and a murmur of applaus went round the council
it seem that we came to a wise judgment when we determin to spare
thi man life said cuitlahua for all that he tell us is true and
i would that we had follow thi polici from the first now lord i
give my voic for act as our brother point the wai what sai you
we sai with you that our brother word ar good answer guatemoc
present and now let us follow them to the end
then after some further talk the council broke up and i sought my
chamber well nigh blind with weari and crush by the weight of all
that i had suffer on that event dai the dawn wa flare in
the eastern sky and by it glimmer i found my path down the empti
corridor till at length i came to the curtain of my sleep place
i drew them and pass through there far up the room the faint light
gleam on her snowi dress her raven hair and ornament of gold stood
otomi my bride
i went toward her and as i came she glide to meet me with
outstretch arm present thei were about my neck and her kiss wa on
my brow
now all is done my love and lord she whisper and come good or
ill or both we ar on till death for such vow as our cannot be
broken
all is done inde otomi and our oath ar lifelong though other
oath have been broken that thei might be sworn i answer
thu then i thoma wingfield wa wed to otomi princess of the
otomi montezuma daughter
chapter xxiv
the night of fear
long befor i awok that dai the command of the council had been
carri out and the bridg in the great causewai were broken down
wherev dyke cross the rais road that ran through the water of
the lake that afternoon also i went dress as an indian warrior with
guatemoc and the other gener to a parlei which wa held with cort
who took hi stand on the same tower of the palac that montezuma had
stood on when the arrow of guatemoc struck him down there is littl to
be said of thi parlei and i rememb it chiefli becaus it wa then
for the first time sinc i had left the tobascan that i saw marina
close and heard her sweet and gentl voic for now as ever she wa by
the side of cort translat hi propos of peac to the aztec
among those propos wa on which show me that de garcia had not
been idl it ask that the fals white man who had been rescu from
the altar of the god upon the teocal should be given in exchang for
certain aztec prison in order that he might be hung accord to
hi merit as a spy and desert a traitor to the emperor of spain i
wonder as i heard if marina knew when she spoke the word that the
fals white man wa none other than the friend of her tobascan dai
you see that you ar fortun in have found place among us aztec
teul said guatemoc with a laugh for your own peopl would greet you
with a rope
then he answer cort sai noth of me but bid him and all
the spaniard prepar for death
mani of us have perish he said you also must perish teul you
shall perish of hunger and thirst you shall perish on the altar of the
god there is no escap for you teul the bridg ar broken
and all the multitud took up the word and thunder out there is no
escap for you teul the bridg ar broken
then the shoot of arrow began and i sought the palac to tell
otomi my wife what i had gather of the state of her father montezuma
who the spaniard said still lai dy and of her two sister who were
hostag in their quarter also i told her how my surrend had been
sought and she kiss me and said smile that though my life wa now
burden with her still it wa better so than that i should fall into
the hand of the spaniard
two dai later came the new that montezuma wa dead and shortli after
it hi bodi which the spaniard hand over to the aztec for burial
attir in the gorgeou robe of royalti thei laid it in the hall of
the palac whenc it wa hurri secretli and at night to chapoltepec
and there hidden awai with small ceremoni for it wa fear that the
peopl might rend it limb from limb in their rage with otomi weep
at my side i look for the last time on the face of that most unhappi
king whose reign so gloriou in it begin had end thu and while
i look i wonder what suffer could have equal hi as fallen
from hi estat and hate by the subject whom he had betrai he lai
dy a prison in the power of the foreign wolv who were tear
out hi countri heart it is littl wonder inde that montezuma
rent the bandag from hi wound and would not suffer them to tend hi
hurt for the real hurt wa in hi soul there the iron had enter
deepli and no leech could cure it except on call death and yet
the fault wa not all hi the devil whom he worship as god were
reveng upon him for thei had fill him with the superstit of
their wick faith and becaus of these the god and their high priest
must sink into a common ruin were it not for these unsubstanti
terror that haunt him the spaniard had never won a foothold in
tenoctitlan and the aztec would have remain free for mani a year to
come but provid will it otherwis and thi dead and disgrac
monarch wa but it instrument
such were the thought that pass through my mind as i gaze upon the
bodi of the great montezuma but otomi ceas from her tear kiss
hi clai and cri aloud
o my father it is well that you ar dead for none who love you
could desir to see you live on in shame and servitud mai the god you
worship give me strength to aveng you or if thei be no god then
mai i find it in myself i swear thi my father that while a man is
left to me i will not ceas from seek to aveng you
then take my hand without anoth word she turn and pass thenc
as will be seen she kept her oath
on that dai and on the morrow there wa fight with the spaniard who
salli out to fill up the gap in the dyke of the causewai a task
in which thei succeed though with some loss but it avail them
noth for so soon as their back were turn we open the dyke
again it wa on these dai that for the first time i had experi of
war and arm with my bow made after the english pattern i did good
servic as it chanc the veri first arrow that i drew wa on my hate
foe de garcia but here my common fortun pursu me for be out of
practic or overanxi i aim too high though the mark wa an easi
on and the shaft pierc the iron of hi casqu caus him to reel
in hi saddl but do him no further hurt still thi marksmanship
poor as it wa gain me great renown among the aztec who were but
feebl archer for thei had never befor seen an arrow pierc through
the spanish mail nor would mine have done so had i not collect the
iron barb off the crossbow bolt of the spaniard and fit them to
my own shaft i seldom found the mail that would withstand arrow made
thu when the rang wa short and the aim good
after the first dai fight i wa appoint gener over a bodi of three
thousand archer and wa given a banner to be born befor me and a
gorgeou captain dress to wear but what pleas me better wa a chain
shirt which came from the bodi of a spanish cavali for mani year i
alwai wore thi shirt beneath my cotton mail and it save my life more
than onc for even bullet would not pierc the two of them
i had taken over the command of my archer but fortyeight hour a
scant time in which to teach them disciplin whereof thei had littl
though thei were brave enough when the occas came to us them in
good earnest and with it the night of disast that is still known
among the spaniard as the noch trist on the afternoon befor that
night a council wa held in the palac at which i spoke sai i wa
certain that the teul thought of retreat from the citi and in the
dark for otherwis thei would not have been so eager to fill up the
canal in the causewai to thi cuitlahua who now that montezuma
wa dead would be emperor though he wa not yet chosen and crown
answer that it might well be that the teul medit flight but
that thei could never attempt it in the dark sinc in so do thei
must becom entangl in the street and dyke
i repli that though it wa not the aztec habit to march and fight at
night such thing were common enough among white men as thei had seen
alreadi and that becaus the spaniard knew it wa not their habit
thei would be the more like to attempt escap under cover of the
dark when thei thought their enemi asleep therefor i counsel
that sentri should be set at all the entranc to everi causewai
to thi cuitlahua assent and assign the causewai of tlacopan to
guatemoc and myself make us the guardian of it safeti that night
guatemoc and i with some soldier went out toward midnight to visit
the guard that we had place upon the causewai it wa veri dark and a
fine rain fell so that a man could see no further befor hi ey
than he can at even through a norfolk roke in autumn we found and
reliev the guard which report that all wa quiet and we were
return toward the great squar when of a sudden i heard a dull sound
as of thousand of men tramp
listen i said
it is the teul who escap whisper guatemoc
quickli we ran to where the street from the great squar open on to
the causewai and there even through the dark and rain we caught the
gleam of armour then i cri aloud in a great voic to arm to arm
the teul escap by the causewai of tlacopan
instantli my word were caught up by the sentri and pass from post
to post till the citi rang with them thei were cri in everi street
and canal thei echo from the roof of hous and among the summit
of a hundr templ the citi awok with a murmur from the lake came
the sound of water beaten by ten thousand oar as though myriad of
wildfowl had sprung suddenli from their reedi bed here there and
everywher torch flash out like fall star wild note were blown
on horn and shell and abov all aros the boom of the snakeskin
drum which the priest upon the teocal beat furious
present the murmur grew to a roar and from thi direct and from
that arm men pour toward the causewai of tlacopan some came on
foot but the most of them were in cano which cover the water
of the lake further than the ear could hear now the spaniard to
the number of fifteen hundr or so accompani by some six or eight
thousand tlascalan were emerg on the causewai in a long thin line
guatemoc and i rush befor them collect men as we went till we
came to the first canal where cano were alreadi gather by score
the head of the spanish column reach the canal and the fight began
which so far as the aztec were concern wa a frai without plan or
order for in that dark and confus the captain could not
see their men or the men hear their captain but thei were there in
countless number and had onli on desir in their breast to kill the
teul a cannon roar send a storm of bullet through us and by
it flash we saw that the spaniard carri a timber bridg with them
which thei were place across the canal then we fell on them everi
man fight for himself guatemoc and i were swept over that bridg by
the first rush of the enemi as leav ar swept in a gale and though
both of us won through safe we saw each other no more that night with
us and after us came the long arrai of spaniard and tlascalan
and from everi side the aztec pour upon them cling to their
struggl line as ant cling to a wound worm
how can i tell all that came to pass that night i cannot for i saw
but littl of it all i know is that for two hour i wa fight like
a madman the foe cross the first canal but when all were over the
bridg wa sunk so deep in the mud that it could not be stir and
three furlong on ran a second canal deeper and wider than the first
over thi thei could not cross till it wa bridg with the dead it
seem as though all hell had broken loos upon that narrow ridg of
ground the sound of cannon and of arquebuss the shriek of agoni
and fear the shout of the spanish soldier the warcri of the
aztec the scream of wound hors the wail of women the hiss of
hurtl dart and arrow and the dull nois of fall blow went up
to heaven in on hideou hurlyburli like a frighten mob of cattl
the long spanish arrai swai thi wai and that bellow as it swai
mani roll down the side of the causewai to be slaughter in the
water of the lake or born awai to sacrific in the cano mani were
drown in the canal and yet more were trampl to death in the mud
hundr of the aztec perish also for the most part beneath the
weapon of their own friend who struck and shot not know on whom
the blow should fall or in whose breast the arrow would find it home
for my part i fought on with a littl band of men who had gather about
me till at last the dawn broke and show an aw sight the most of
those who were left aliv of the spaniard and their alli had cross
the second canal upon a bridg made of the dead bodi of their fellow
mix up with a wreck of baggag cannon and packag of treasur now
the fight wa rage beyond it a mob of spaniard and tlascalan were
still cross the second breach and on these i fell with such men
as were with me i plung right into the heart of them and suddenli
befor me i saw the face of de garcia with a shout i rush at him he
heard my voic and knew me with an oath he struck at my head the heavi
sword came down upon my helmet of paint wood shear awai on side
of it and fell me but er i fell i smote him on the breast with the
club i carri tumbl him to the earth now half stun and blind
i crept toward him through the press all that i could see wa a gleam
of armour in the mud i threw myself upon it grip at the wearer
throat and togeth we roll down the side of the causewai into the
shallow water at the edg of the lake i wa uppermost and with a
fierc joi i dash the blood from my ey that i might see to kill my
enemi caught at last hi bodi wa in the lake but hi head lai upon the
slope bank and my plan wa to hold him beneath the water till he wa
drown for i had lost my club
at length de garcia i cri in spanish as i shift my grip
for the love of god let me go gasp a rough voic beneath me fool
i am no indian dog
now i peer into the man face bewild i had seiz de garcia but
the voic wa not hi voic nor wa the face hi face but that of a
rough spanish soldier
who ar you i ask slacken my hold where is de garciah whom
you name sarceda
sarceda i dont know a minut ago he wa on hi back on the causewai
the fellow pull me down and roll behind me let me be i sai i am
not sarceda and if i were is thi a time to settl privat quarrel
i am your comrad bernal diaz holi mother who ar you an aztec who
speak castilian
i am no aztec i answer i am an englishman and i fight with the
aztec that i mai slai him whom you name sarceda but with you i have no
quarrel bernal diaz begon and escap if you can no i will keep the
sword with your leav
englishman spaniard aztec or devil grunt the man as he drew
himself from hi bed of ooz you ar a good fellow and i promis you
that if i live through thi and it should ever come about that i get
you by the throat i will rememb the turn you did me farewel and
without more ado he rush up the bank and plung into a knot of hi
fly countrymen leav hi good sword in my hand i strove to follow
him that i might find my enemi who onc more had escap me by craft
but my strength fail me for de garcia sword had bitten deep and i
bled much so i must sit where i wa till a cano came and bore me back
to otomi to be nurs and ten dai went by befor i could walk again
thi wa my share in the victori of the noch trist ala it wa a
barren triumph though more than five hundr of the spaniard were
slain and thousand of their alli for there wa no warlik skill or
disciplin among the aztec and instead of follow the spaniard till
not on of them remain aliv thei stai to plunder the dead and drag
awai the live to sacrific also thi dai of reveng wa a sad on
to otomi see that two of her brother montezuma son whom the
spaniard held in hostag perish with them in the frai
as for de garcia i could not learn what had becom of him nor whether
he wa dead or live
chapter xxv
the buri of montezuma treasur
cuitlahua wa crown emperor of the aztec in success to hi brother
montezuma while i lai sick with the wound given me by the sword of
de garcia and also with that which i had receiv on the altar of
sacrific thi hurt had found no time to heal and in the fierc
fight on the night of fear it burst open and bled much inde it
gave me troubl for year and to thi hour i feel it in the autumn
season otomi who nurs me tenderli and so strang is the heart
of woman even seem to be consol in her sorrow at the loss of her
father and nearest kin becaus i had escap the slaughter and won
fame told me of the ceremoni of the crown which wa splendid
enough inde the aztec were almost mad with rejoic becaus the
teul had gone at last thei forgot or seem to forget the loss of
thousand of their bravest warrior and of the flower of their rank and
as yet at ani rate thei did not look forward to the futur from
hous to hous and street to street ran troop of young men and maiden
garland with flower cry the teul ar gone rejoic with
us the teul ar fled and woe to them who were not merri ay even
though their hous were desol with death also the statu of the
god were set up again on the great pyramid and their templ rebuilt
the holi crucifix that the spaniard had place there be serv as
the idol huitzel and tezcat had been serv and tumbl down the side
of the teocal and that after sacrific of some spanish prison had
been offer in it presenc it wa guatemoc himself who told me
of thi sacrileg but not with ani exult for i had taught him
someth of our faith and though he wa too sturdi a heathen to chang
hi creed in secret he believ that the god of the christian wa
a true and mighti god moreov though he wa oblig to counten
them becaus of the power of the priest like otomi guatemoc never
love the horrid rite of human sacrific
now when i heard thi tale my anger overcam my reason and i spoke
fierc sai
i am sworn to your caus guatemoc my brother and i am marri to
your blood but i tell you that from thi hour it is an accurs caus
becaus of your bloodstain idol and your priest it is accurs
that god whom you have desecr and those who serv him shall come
back in power and he shall sit where your idol sat and none shall stir
him for ever
thu i spoke and my word were true though i do not know what put them
into my heart sinc i spoke at random in my wrath for todai christ
church stand upon the site of the place of sacrific in mexico a sign
and a token of hi triumph over devil and there it shall stand while
the world endur
you speak rashli my brother guatemoc answer proudli enough
though i saw him quail at the evil omen of my word i sai you speak
rashli and were you overheard there ar those notwithstand the rank
we have given you the honour which you have won in war and council and
that you have pass the stone of sacrific who might forc you to look
again upon the face of the be you blasphem what wors thing ha
been done to your christian god than ha been done again and again to
our god by your white kindr but let us talk no more of thi matter
and i prai you my brother do not utter such illomen word to me
again lest it should strain our love do you then believ that the
teul will return
ay guatemoc so sure as tomorrow sun shall rise when you held
cort in your hand you let him go and sinc then he ha won a victori
at otompan is he a man think you to sheath the sword that he ha
onc drawn and go down into dark and dishonour befor a year is
past the spaniard will be back at the gate of tenoctitlan
you ar no comfort tonight my brother said guatemoc and yet i
fear that your word ar true well if we must fight let us strive
to win now at least there is no montezuma to take the viper to
hi breast and nurs it till it sting him then he rose and went in
silenc and i saw that hi heart wa heavi
on the morrow of thi talk i could leav my bed and within a week i wa
almost well now it wa that guatemoc came to me again sai that he
had been bidden by cuitlahua the emperor to command me to accompani
him guatemoc on a servic of trust and secreci and inde the natur
of the servic show how great a confid the leader of the aztec
now place in me for it wa none other than the hide awai of the
treasur that had been recaptur from the spaniard on the night of
fear and with it much more from the secret store of the empir
at the fall of dark we start some of the great lord guatemoc
and i and come to the water edg we found ten larg cano each
laden with someth that wa hidden by cotton cloth into these cano
we enter secretli think that none saw us three to a cano for
there were thirti of us in all and led by guatemoc we paddl for two
hour or more across the lake tezcuco till we reach the further shore
at a spot where thi princ had a fair estat here we land and the
cloth were withdrawn from the cargo of the cano which were great
jar and sack of gold and jewel besid mani other preciou object
among them a like of the head of montezuma fashion in solid gold
which wa so heavi that it wa as much as guatemoc and i could do to
lift it between us as for the jar of which if my memori serv me
there were seventeen six men must carri each of them by the help of
paddl lash on either side and then the task wa not light all thi
priceless stuff we bore in sever journei to the crest of a rise some
six hundr pace distant from the water set it down by the mouth
of a shaft behind the shelter of a mound of earth when everyth wa
brought up from the boat guatemoc touch me and anoth man a great
aztec nobl born of a tlascalan mother on the shoulder ask us if
we were will to descend with him into the hole and there to dispos
of the treasur
gladli i answer for i wa curiou to see the place but the nobl
hesit awhil though in the end he came with us to hi illfortun
then guatemoc took torch in hi hand and wa lower into the shaft
by a rope next came my turn and down i went hang to the cord like
a spider to it thread and the hole wa veri deep at length i found
myself stand by the side of guatemoc at the foot of the shaft round
which as i saw by the light of the torch he carri an edg of dri
brick wa built up to the height of a man abov our head rest on
thi edg and against the wall of the shaft wa a massiv block of
stone sculptur with the pictur write of the aztec i glanc at
the write which i could now read well and saw that it record
the buri of the treasur in the first year of cuitlahua emperor of
mexico and also a most fear curs on him who should dare to steal
it beyond us and at right angl to the shaft ran anoth passag ten
pace in length and high enough for a man to walk in which led to a
chamber hollow in the earth as larg as that wherein i write todai
at ditchingham by the mouth of thi chamber were place pile of adob
brick and mortar much as the block of hewn stone had been place in
that underground vault at sevil where isabella de siguenza wa brick
up live
who dug thi place i ask
those who knew not what thei dug answer guatemoc but see here
is our companion now my brother i charg you be surpris at noth
which come to pass and be assur i have good reason for anyth that
i mai do
befor i could speak again the aztec nobl wa at our side then those
abov began to lower the jar and sack of treasur and as thei reach
us on by on guatemoc loos the rope and check them while the
aztec and i roll them down the passag into the chamber as here in
england men roll a cask of al for two hour and more we work till
at length all were down and the tale wa complet the last parcel to be
lower wa a sack of jewel that burst open as it came and descend
upon us in a glitter rain of gem as it chanc a great necklac of
emerald of surpass size and beauti fell over my head and hung upon
my shoulder
keep it brother laugh guatemoc in memori of thi night and
noth loth i hid the baubl in my breast that necklac i have yet
and it wa a stone of itth smallest save onethat i gave to our
graciou queen elizabeth otomi wore it for mani year and for thi
reason it shall be buri with me though it valu is priceless so sai
those who ar skill in gem but priceless or no it is doom to lie
in the mould of ditchingham churchyard and mai that same curs which
is grave upon the stone that hide the treasur of the aztec fall upon
him who steal it from my bone
now leav the chamber we three enter the tunnel and began the work
of build the adob wall when it wa of a height of between two and
three feet guatemoc paus from hi labour and bade me hold a torch
aloft i obei wonder what he wish to see then he drew back some
three pace into the tunnel and spoke to the aztec nobl our companion
by name
what is the fate of discov traitor friend he said in a voic
that quiet though it wa sound veri terribl and as he spoke he
loos from hi side the war club set with spike of glass that hung
there by a thong
now the aztec turn grei beneath hi duski skin and trembl in hi
fear
what mean you lord he gasp
you know well what i mean answer guatemoc in the same terribl
voic and lift the club
then the doom man fell upon hi knee cry for merci and hi
wail sound so aw in that deep and lone place that in my horror
i went near to let the torch fall
to a foe i can give mercyto a traitor none answer guatemoc and
whirl the club aloft he rush upon the nobl and kill him with a
blow then seiz the bodi in hi strong embrac he cast it into the
chamber with the treasur and there it lai still and dread among
the gem and gold the arm as it chanc be wound about two of the
great jar as though the dead man would clasp them to hi heart
now i look at guatemoc who had slain him wonder if my hour wa at
hand also for i knew well that when princ buri their wealth thei hold
that few should share the secret
fear not my brother said guatemoc listen thi man wa a thief a
dastard and a traitor as we know now he strove twice to betrai us to
the teul more it wa hi plan to show thi nest of wealth to them
should thei return again and to share the spoil all thi we learn
from a woman whom he thought hi love but who wa in truth a spy set to
worm herself into the secret of hi wick heart now let him take hi
fill of gold look how he grip it even in death a white man could not
hug the stuff more close to hi breast ah teul would that the soil
of anahuac bore naught but corn for bread and flint and copper for
the point of spear and arrow then had her son been free for ever
curs on yonder dross for it is the bait that set these sea shark
tear at our throat curs on it i sai mai it never glitter more
in the sunshin mai it be lost for ever and he fell fierc to the
work of build up the wall
soon it wa almost done but befor we set the last brick which were
shape in squar like the clai lump that we us for the build of
farmeri and hind hous in norfolk i thrust a torch through the
open and look for the last time at the treasur chamber that wa
also a deadhous there lai the glitter gem there stood upon a
jar gleam the golden head of montezuma of which the emerald ey
seem to glare at me and there hi back rest against thi same
jar and hi arm encircl two other to the right and left wa the
dead man but he wa no longer dead or so it seem to me at the
least hi ey that were shut had open and thei stare at me like the
emerald ey of the golden statu abov him onli more fearfulli
veri hastili i withdrew the torch and we finish in silenc when it
wa done we withdrew to the end of the passag and look up the shaft
and i for on wa glad to see the star shine in heaven abov me then
we made a doubl loop in the rope and at a signal were haul up
till we hung over the ledg where the black mass of marbl rest the
tombston of montezuma treasur and of him who sleep among it
thi stone that wa nice balanc we push with our hand and feet
till present it fell forward with a heavi sound and catch on the
ridg of brick which had been prepar to receiv it shut the treasur
shaft in such a fashion that those who would enter it again must take
powder with them
then we were drag up and came to the surfac of the earth in safeti
now on ask of the aztec nobl who had gone down with us and return
no more
he ha chosen to stai and watch the treasur like a good and loyal
man till such time as hi king need it answer guatemoc grimli and
the listen nod understand all
then thei fell to and fill up the narrow shaft with the earth that
lai readi work without ceas and the dawn broke befor the task wa
finish when at length the hole wa full on of our companion took
seed from a bag and scatter them on the nake earth also he set
two young tree that he had brought with him in the soil of the shaft
though why he did thi i do not know unless it wa to mark the spot
all be done we gather up the rope and tool and embark in
the cano came back to mexico in the morn leav the cano at a
landingplac outsid the citi and find our wai to our home by on
and two as we thought unnot of ani
thu it wa that i help in the buri of montezuma treasur for
the sake of which i wa destin to suffer tortur in dai to come
whether ani will help to unburi it i do not know but till i left the
land of anahuac the secret had been kept and i think that then except
myself all those were dead who labour with me at thi task it
chanc that i pass the spot as i came down to mexico for the last
time and knew it again by the two tree that were grow tall and
strong and as i went by with spaniard at my side i swore in my heart
that thei should never finger the gold by my help it is for thi reason
that even now i do not write of the exact bear of the place where
it li buri with the bone of the traitor though i know them well
enough see that in dai to come what i set down here might fall into
the hand of on of their nation
and now befor i go on to speak of the sieg of mexico i must tell of
on more matter name of how i and otomi my wife went up among the
peopl of the otomi and won a great number of them back to their
allegi to the aztec crown it must be known if my tale ha not
made thi clear alreadi that the aztec power wa not of on peopl
but built up of sever and that surround it were mani other tribe
some of whom were in allianc with it or subject to it and some of whom
were it deadli enemi such for instanc were the tlascalan a small
but warlik peopl live between mexico and the coast by whose help
cort overcam montezuma and guatemoc beyond the tlascalan and to the
west the great otomi race live or live among it mountain thei
ar a braver nation than the aztec speak anoth languag of a
differ blood and made up of mani clan sometim thei were subject
to the great aztec empir sometim in allianc and sometim at open
war with it and in close friendship with the tlascalan it wa to
draw the tie closer between the aztec and the otomi who were to the
inhabit of anahuac much what the scottish clan ar to the peopl
of england that montezuma took to wife the daughter and sole legitim
issu of their great chief or king thi ladi di in childbirth and
her child wa otomi my wife hereditari princess of the otomi but
though her rank wa so great among her mother peopl as yet otomi
had visit them but twice and then as a child still she wa well
skill in their languag and custom have been brought up by nurs
and tutor of the tribe from which she drew a great revenu everi year
and over whom she exercis mani right of royalti that were render to
her far more freeli than thei had been to montezuma her father
now as ha been said some of these otomi clan had join the
tlascalan and as their alli had taken part in the war on the side of
the spaniard therefor it wa decid at a solemn council that otomi
and i her husband should go on an embassi to the chief town of the
nation that wa known as the citi of pine and strive to win it back
to the aztec standard
accordingli herald have been sent befor us we start upon our
journei not know how we should be receiv at the end of it for
eight dai we travel in great pomp and with an everincreas
escort for when the tribe of the otomi learn that their princess
wa come to visit them in person bring with her her husband a man
of the teul who had espous the aztec caus thei flock in vast
number to swell her retinu so that it came to pass that befor we
reach the citi of pine we were accompani by an armi of at least ten
thousand mountain great men and wild who made a savag music as we
march but with them and with their chief as yet we held no convers
except by wai of formal greet though everi morn when we start
on our journei otomi in a litter and i on a hors that had been
captur from the spaniard thei set up shout of salut and made
the mountain ring ever as we went the land like it peopl grew wilder
and more beauti for now we were pass through forest clad with
oak and pine and with mani a love plant and fern sometim we cross
great and sparkl river and sometim we wend through gorg and
pass of the mountain but everi hour we mount higher till at
length the climat becam like that of england onli far more bright at
last on the eighth dai we pass through a gorg riven in the red rock
which wa so narrow in place that three horsemen could scarc have
ridden there abreast thi gorg that is five mile long is the high
road to the citi of pine to which there wa no other access except by
secret path across the mountain and on either side of it ar sheer
and tower cliff that rise to height of between on and two thousand
feet
here is a place where a hundr men might hold an armi at bai i said
to otomi littl know that it would be my task to do so in a dai to
come
present the gorg took a turn and i rein up amaz for befor me
wa the citi of pine in all it beauti the citi lai in a wheelshap
plain that mai measur twelv mile across and all around thi plain
ar mountain clad to their summit with forest of oak and cedar tree
at the back of the citi and in the centr of the ring of mountain is
on howev that is not green with foliag but black with lava and
abov the lava white with snow over which again hang a pillar of smoke
by dai and a pillar of fire by night thi wa the volcan xaca or the
queen and though it is not so lofti as it sister orizaba popo and
ixtac to my mind it is the loveliest of them all both becaus of it
perfect shape and of the colour purpl and blue of the fire that
it send forth at night or when it heart is troubl the otomi
worship thi mountain as a god offer human sacrific to it which
wa not wonder for onc the lava pour from it bowel cut a path
through the citi of pine also thei think it holi and haunt so that
none dare set foot upon it loftier snow nevertheless i wa destin
to climb themi and on other
now in the lap of thi ring of mountain and watch over by the mighti
xaca clad in it robe of snow it cap of smoke and it crown of fire
li or rather lai the citi of pine for now it is a ruin or so i
left it as to the citi itself it wa not so larg as some other that
i have seen in anahuac have onli a popul of some five and thirti
thousand soul sinc the otomi be a race of mountain did
not desir to dwell in citi but if it wa not great it wa the most
beauti of indian town be laid out in straight street that met
at the squar in it centr all along these street were hous each
stand in a garden and for the most part built of block of lava and
roof with a cement of white lime in the midst of the squar stood the
teocal or pyramid of worship crown with templ that were garnish
with rope of skull while beyond the pyramid and face it wa the
palac the home of otomi forefath a long low and veri ancient
build have mani court and sculptur everywher with snake and
grin god both the palac and the pyramid were case with a fine
white stone that shone like silver in the sunlight and contrast
strang with the darkhu hous that were built of lava
such wa the citi of pine when i saw it first when i saw it last it
wa but a smoke ruin and now doubtless it is the home of bat and
jackal now it is a court for owl now the line of confus is
stretch out upon it and the stone of empti fill it street
pass from the mouth of the gorg we travel some mile across the
plain everi foot of which wa cultiv with corn maguei or alo and
other crop till we came to on of the four gate of the citi enter
it we found the flat roof on either side of the wide street crowd
with hundr of women and children who threw flower on us as we
pass and cri welcom princess welcom otomi princess of the
otomi and when at length we reach the great squar it seem as
though all the men in anahuac were gather there and thei too took
up the cry of welcom otomi princess of the otomi till the earth
shook with the sound me also thei salut as i pass by touch the
earth with their right hand and then hold the hand abov the head
but i think that the hors i rode caus them more wonder than i did
for the most of them had never seen a hors and look on it as a
monster or a demon so we went on through the shout mass follow
and preced by thousand of warrior mani of them deck in glitter
feather mail and bear broider banner till we had pass the
pyramid where i saw the priest at their cruel work abov us and were
come to the palac gate and here in a strang chamber sculptur with
grin demon we found rest for a while
on the morrow in the great hall of the palac wa held a council of the
chief and head men of the otomi clan to the number of a hundr or
more when all were gather dress as an aztec nobl of the first
rank i came out with otomi who wore royal robe and look most
beauti in them and the council rose to greet us otomi bade them be
seat and address them thu
hear me you chief and captain of my mother race who am your
princess by right of blood the last of your ancient ruler and who am
moreov the daughter of montezuma emperor of anahuac now dead to us
but live evermor in the mansion of the sun first i present to you
thi my husband the lord teul to whom i wa given in marriag when
he held the spirit of the god tezcat and whom when he had pass the
altar of the god be chosen by heaven to aid us in our war i
wed anew after the fashion of the earth and by the will of my royal
brethren know chief and captain that thi lord my husband is not
of our indian blood nor is he altogeth of the blood of the teul
with whom we ar at war but rather of that of the true children of
quetzal the dweller in a far off northern sea who ar foe to the
teul and as thei ar foe so thi my lord is their foe and as
doubtless you have heard of all the deed of arm that were wrought
upon the night of the slai of the teul none were greater than hi
and it wa he who first discov their retreat
chief and captain of the great and ancient peopl of the otomi i
your princess have been sent to you by cuitlahua my king and your
togeth with my lord to plead with you on a certain matter our king
ha heard and i also have heard with shame that mani of the warrior
of our blood have join the tlascalan who were ever foe to the
aztec in their unholi allianc with the teul now for a while the
white men ar beaten back but thei have touch the gold thei covet
and thei will return again like bee to a halfdrain flower thei
will return yet of themselv thei can do noth against the glori of
tenoctitlan but how shall it go if with them come thousand and ten
of thousand of the indian peopl i know well that now in thi time
of troubl when kingdom crumbl when the air is full of portent and
the veri god seem impot there ar mani who would seiz the moment
and turn it to their profit there ar mani men and tribe who rememb
ancient war and wrong and who cry now is the hour of vengeanc
now we will think on the widow that the aztec spear have made on the
tribut which thei have wrung from our poverti to swell their wealth
and on the captiv who have deck the altar of their sacrific
is it not so ay it is so and i cannot wonder at it yet i ask you to
rememb thi that the yoke you would help to set upon the neck of the
queen of citi will fit your neck also o foolish men do you think
that you shall be spare when by your aid tenoctitlan is a ruin and the
aztec ar no more a peopl i sai to you never the stick that the
teul us to beat out the life of tenoctitlan shall by them be broken
on by on and cast into the fire to burn if the aztec fall then
earli or late everi tribe within thi wide land shall fall thei shall
be slain their citi shall be stamp flat their wealth shall be
wrung from them and their children shall eat the bread of slaveri and
drink the water of afflict choos ye peopl of the otomi will you
stand by the men of your own custom and countri though thei have been
your foe at time or will you throw in your lot with the stranger
choos ye peopl of the otomi and know thi that on your choic and
that of the other men of anahuac depend the fate of anahuac i am your
princess and you should obei me but todai i issu no command i sai
choos between the allianc of the aztec and the yoke of the teul and
mai the god abov the god the almighti the invis god direct your
choic
otomi ceas and a murmur of applaus went round the hall ala i can
do no justic to the fire of her word ani more than i can describ the
digniti and loveli of her person as it seem in that hour but thei
went to the heart of the rude chieftain who listen mani of them
despis the aztec as a womanish peopl of the plain and the lake
a peopl of commerc mani had blood feud against them date back for
gener but still thei knew that their princess spoke truth and
that the triumph of the teul in tenoctitlan would mean hi triumph over
everi citi throughout the land so then and there thei chose though
in after dai in the stress of defeat and troubl mani went back upon
their choic as is the fashion of men
otomi cri their spokesman after thei had taken counsel togeth
we have chosen princess your word have conquer us we throw in
our lot with the aztec and will fight to the last for freedom from the
teul
now i see that you ar inde my peopl and i am inde your ruler
answer otomi so the great lord who ar gone my forefath your
chieftain would have spoken in a like case mai you never regret thi
choic my brethren men of the otomi
and so it came to pass that when we left the citi of pine we took from
it to cuitlahua the emperor a promis of an armi of twenti thousand men
vow to serv him to the death in hi war against the spaniard
chapter xxvi
the crown of guatemoc
our busi with the peopl of the otomi be end for a while we
return to the citi of tenoctitlan which we reach safe have
been absent a month and a dai it wa but a littl time and yet long
enough for fresh sorrow to have fallen on that most unhappi town for
now the almighti had ad to the burden which were laid upon her she
had tast of death by the sword of the white man now death wa with
her in anoth shape for the spaniard had brought the foul sick
of europ with him and smallpox rage throughout the land dai by dai

wide thei were dy in the hous thei lai dead by compani in the
market place await burial for the sick took it toll of
everi famili the veri priest were smitten by it at the altar as thei

and sent command that we should be brought to hi bedsid in vain did
i prai otomi not to obei she who wa without fear laugh at me
sai what my husband shall i shrink from that which you must face
come let us go and make report of our mission if the sick take me
and i die it will be becaus my hour ha come
thi treatment is follow among the indian of mexico to
thi dai but if the writer mai believ what he heard in
that countri the patient is frequent cure by it
so we went and were usher into a chamber where cuitlahua lai cover
by a sheet as though he were alreadi dead and with incens burn
round him in golden censer when we enter he wa in a stupor but
present he awok and it wa announc to him that we wait

voic you find me in an evil case for my dai ar number the

now he lai silent for a while then of a sudden as though an
inspir had seiz him he cast the sheet from hi face and sat upon
hi couch no pleasant sight to see for the pestil had done it
worst with him
ala he wail and ala i see the street of tenoctitlan red with

have cri thu with a great voic cuitlahua fell back upon the
cushion and befor the frighten leech who tend him could lift hi
head he had pass beyond the troubl of thi earth but the word
which he had spoken remain fix in the heart of those who heard

of the aztec when he had reign but fifteen week onc more the
nation mourn it king the chief of mani a thousand of it children
whom the pestil swept with him to the mansion of the sun or
perchanc to the dark behind the star
but the mourn wa not for long for in the urgenc of the time it
wa necessari that a new emperor should be crown to take command of
the armi and rule the nation therefor on the morrow of the burial of
cuitlahua the council of the four elector wa conven and with them
lesser nobl and princ to the number of three hundr and i among
them in the right of my rank as gener and as husband of the princess

man who by birth by courag and nobil of mind wa fit to cope
with the troubl of the nation that man wa guatemoc my friend and
blood brother the nephew of the two last emperor and the husband of
my wife sister montezuma daughter tecuichpo all knew it i sai
except strang enough guatemoc himself for as we pass into the

lesser council of confirm of three hundr lord and princ who
sat without the circl but in hear of all that pass veri solemn
also wa the prayer of the high priest who clad in hi robe of sabl

when the high priest had made an end of hi prayer the first of the
four great elector rose sai
guatemoc in the name of god and with the voic of the peopl of
anahuac we summon you to the throne of anahuac long mai you live and
justli mai you rule and mai the glori be your of beat back into the
sea those foe who would destroi us hail to you guatemoc emperor of
the aztec and of their vassal tribe and all the three hundr of the
council of confirm repeat in a voic of thunder hail to you
guatemoc emperor
now the princ himself stood forward and spoke
you lord of elect and you princ gener nobl and captain
of the council of confirm hear me mai the god be my wit
that when i enter thi place i had no thought or knowledg that i wa
destin to so high an honour as that which you would thrust upon me
and mai the god be my wit again that were my life my own and not a
trust in the hand of thi peopl i would sai to you seek on and find
on worthier to fill the throne but my life is not my own anahuac
call her son and i obei the call war to the death threaten her and
shall i hang back while my arm ha strength to smite and my brain ha
power to plan not so now and henceforth i vow myself to the servic
of my countri and to war against the teul i will make no peac with
them i will take no rest till thei ar driven back whenc thei came or
till i am dead beneath their sword none can sai what the god have
in store for us it mai be victori or it mai be destruct but be it
triumph or death let us swear a great oath togeth my peopl and my
brethren let us swear to fight the teul and the traitor who abet
them for our citi our hearth and our altar till the citi ar
a smoke ruin till the hearth ar cumber with their dead and
the altar run red with the blood of their worshipp so if we ar
destin to conquer our triumph shall be made sure and if we ar
doom to fail at least there will be a stori to be told of us do you
swear my peopl and my brethren
we swear thei answer with a shout
it is well said guatemoc and now mai everlast shame overtak him
who break thi oath
thu then wa guatemoc the last and greatest of the aztec emperor
elect to the throne of hi forefath it wa happi for him that he
could not forese that dread dai when he the noblest of men must
meet a felon doom at the hand of these veri teul yet so it came
about for the destini that lai upon the land smote all alik inde
the greater the man the more certain wa hi fate
when all wa done i hurri to the palac to tell otomi what had come
to pass and found her in our sleep chamber ly on her bed
what ail you otomi i ask
ala my husband she answer the pestil ha stricken me come
not near i prai you come not near let me be nurs by the women you
shall not risk your life for me belov
peac i said and came to her it wa too true i who am a physician
knew the symptom well inde had it not been for my skill otomi
would have di for three long week i fought with death at her
bedsid and in the end i conquer the fever left her and thank
to my treatment there wa no singl scar upon her love face dure
eight dai her mind wander without ceas and it wa then i learn
how deep and perfect wa her love for me for all thi while she
did noth but rave of me and the secret terror of her heart wa
disclosedthat i should ceas to care for her that her beauti and love
might pall upon me so that i should leav her that the flower maid
for so she name lili who dwelt across the sea should draw me back to
her by magic thi wa the burden of her mad at length her sens
return and she spoke sai
how long have i lain ill husband
i told her and she said and have you nurs me all thi while and
through so foul a sick
ye otomi i have tend you
what have i done that you should be so good to me she murmur then
some dread thought seem to strike her for she moan as though in
pain and said a mirror swift bring me a mirror
i gave her on and rise on her arm eagerli she scan her face in
the dim light of the shadow room then let the plate of burnish gold
fall and sank back with a faint and happi cry
i fear she said i fear that i had becom hideou as those ar
whom the pestil ha smitten and that you would ceas to love me
than which it had been better to die
for shame i said do you then think that love can be frighten awai
by some few scar
ye otomi answer that is the love of a man not such love as
mine husband had i been thusah i shudder to think of itwithin a
year you would have hate me perhap it had not been so with anoth
the fair maid of far awai but me you would have hate nai i know it
though i know thi also that i should not have live to feel your hate
oh i am thank thank
then i left her for a while marvel at the great love which she had
given me and wonder also if there wa ani truth in her word and
if the heart of man could be so ungrat and so vile suppos that
otomi wa now as mani were who walk the street of tenoctitlan that
dai a mass of dread scar hairless and with blind and whiten
eyebal should i then have shrunk from her i do not know and i thank
heaven that no such trial wa put upon my constanc but i am sure of
thi had i becom a leper even otomi would not have shrunk from me
so otomi recov from her great sick and shortli afterward the
pestil pass awai from tenoctitlan and now i had mani other
thing to think of for the choos of guatemocmi friend and blood
brothera emperor meant much advanc to me who wa made a gener
of the highest class and a princip advis in hi council nor did
i spare myself in hi servic but labour by dai and night in the work
of prepar the citi for sieg and in the marshal of the troop
and more especi of that armi of otomi who came as thei had
promis to the number of twenti thousand the work wa hard inde
for these indian tribe lack disciplin and power of uniti without
which their thousand were of littl avail in a war with white men
also there were great jealousi between their leader which must be
overcom and i wa myself an object of jealousi moreov mani tribe
took thi occas of the troubl of the aztec to throw off their
allegi or vassalag and even if thei did not join the spaniard to
remain neutral watch for the event of the war still we labour
on divid the armi into regiment after the fashion of europ and
station each in it own quarter drill them to the better us of
arm provis the citi for a sieg and weed out as mani useless
mouth as we might and there wa but on man in tenoctitlan who toil
at these task more heavili than i and that wa guatemoc the emperor
who did not rest dai or night i tri even to make powder with sulphur
which wa brought from the throat of the volcan popo but have no
knowledg of that art i fail inde it would have avail us littl
had i succeed for have neither arquebuss nor cannon and no
skill to cast them we could onli have us it in mine road and
gatewai and perhap in grenad to be thrown with the hand
and so the month went on till at length spi came in with the tide
that the spaniard were advanc in number and with them countless
host of alli
now i would have sent otomi to seek safeti among her own peopl but
she laugh me to scorn and said
where you ar there i will be husband what shall it be suffer
that you face death perhap to find him when i am not at your side to
die with you if that is the fashion of white women i leav it to them
belov and here with you i stai
chapter xxvii
the fall of tenoctitlan
now shortli after christma have march from the coast with a great
arrai of spaniard for mani had join hi banner from over sea and
ten of thousand of nativ alli cort took up hi head quarter at
tezcuco in the vallei of mexico thi town is situat near the border
of the lake at a distanc of sever leagu from tenoctitlan and
be on the edg of the territori of the tlascalan hi alli it wa
most suitabl to cort as a base of action and then began on of the
most terribl war that the world ha seen for eight month it rage
and when it ceas at length tenoctitlan and with it mani other
beauti and popul town were blacken ruin the most of the
aztec were dead by sword and famin and their nation wa crush for
ever of all the detail of thi war i do not purpos to write for were
i to do so there would be no end to thi book and i have my own tale
to tell these therefor i leav to the maker of histori let it be
enough to sai that the plan of cort wa to destroi all her vassal and
alli citi and peopl befor he grappl with mexico queen of the
vallei and thi he set himself to do with a skill a valour and a
straight of purpos such as have scarc been shown by a gener
sinc the dai of caesar
iztapalapan wa the first to fall and here ten thousand men women and
children were put to the sword or burn aliv then came the turn of
the other on by on cort reduc the citi till the whole girdl
of them wa in hi hand and tenoctitlan alon remain untouch mani
inde surrend for the nation of anahuac be of variou blood
were but as a bundl of reed and not as a tree thu when the power of
spain cut the band of empir that bound them togeth thei fell thi
wai and that have no uniti so it came about that as the power
of guatemoc weaken that of cort increas for he garner these
loosen reed into hi basket and inde now that the peopl saw
that mexico had met her match mani an ancient hate and smoulder
rivalri broke into flame and thei fell upon her and tore her like
halftam wolv upon their master when hi scourg is broken it wa
thi that brought about the fall of anahuac had she remain true to
herself had she forgotten her feud and jealousi and stood against
the spaniard as on man then tenoctitlan would never have fallen and
cort with everi teul in hi compani had been stretch upon the stone
of sacrific
did i not sai when i took up my pen to write thi book that everi wrong
reveng itself at last upon the man or the peopl that wrought it
so it wa now mexico wa destroi becaus of the abomin of the
worship of her god these feud between the alli peopl had their
root in the horribl rite of human sacrific at some time in the past
from all these citi captiv have been drag to the altar of the
god of mexico there to be slaughter and devour by the cannib
worshipp now these outrag were rememb now when the arm of
the queen of the vallei wa wither the children of those whom she had
slain rose up to slai her and to drag her children to their altar
by the month of mai strive as we would and never wa a more gallant
fight made all our alli were crush or had desert us and the
sieg of the citi began it began by land and by water for with
incred resourc cort caus thirteen brigantin of war to be
construct in tlascala and convei in piec for twenti leagu
across the mountain to hi camp whenc thei were float into the lake
through a canal which wa hollow out by the labour of ten thousand
indian who work at it without ceas for two month the bearer
of these brigantin were escort by an armi of twenti thousand
tlascalan and if i could have had my wai that armi should have been
attack in the mountain pass so thought guatemoc also but there
were few troop to spare for the most of our forc had been despatch
to threaten a citi name chalco that though it peopl were of the
aztec blood had not been asham to desert the aztec caus still i
offer to lead the twenti thousand otomi whom i command against the
tlascalan convoi and the matter wa debat hotli at a council of war
but the most of the council were against the risk of an engag
with the spaniard and their alli so far from the citi and thu the
opportun went by to return no more it wa an evil fortun like
the rest for in the end these brigantin brought about the fall of
tenoctitlan by cut off the suppli of food which wa carri in
cano across the lake ala the bravest can do noth against the
power of famin hunger is a veri great man as the indian sai
now the aztec fight alon were face to face with their foe and the
last struggl began first the spaniard cut the aqueduct which suppli
the citi with water from the spring at the royal hous of chapoltepec
whither i wa taken on be brought to mexico henceforth till the end
of the sieg the onli water that we found to drink wa the brackish and
muddi fluid furnish by the lake and well sunk in the soil although
it might be drunk after boil to free it of the salt it wa
unwholesom and filthi to the tast breed variou pain sick
and fever it wa on thi dai of the cut of the aqueduct that
otomi bore me a son our firstborn alreadi the hardship of the sieg
were so great and nourish food so scarc that had she been less
strong or had i possess less skill in medicin i think that she
would have di still she recov to my great thank and joi
and though i am no clerk i baptiz the boi into the christian church
with my own hand name him thoma after me
now dai by dai and week by week the fight went on with vari
success sometim in the suburb of the citi sometim on the lake
and sometim in the veri street time on time the spaniard were
driven back with loss time on time thei advanc again from their
differ camp onc we captur sixti of them and more than a thousand
of their alli all these were sacrif on the altar of huitzel
and given over to be devour by the aztec accord to the beastlik
custom which in anahuac enjoin the eat of the bodi of those who
were offer to the god not becaus the indian love such meat but for
a secret religi reason
in vain did i prai guatemoc to forego thi horror
is thi a time for gentl he answer fierc i cannot save
them from the altar and i would not if i could let the dog die
accord to the custom of the land and to you teul my brother i sai
presum not too far
ala the heart of guatemoc grew ever fiercer as the struggl wore on
and inde it wa littl to be wonder at
thi wa the dread plan of cort to destroi the citi piecem as
he advanc toward it heart and it wa carri out without merci
so soon as the spaniard got foot in a quarter thousand of the
tlascalan were set to work to fire the hous and burn all in them
aliv befor the sieg wa done tenoctitlan queen of the vallei wa
but a heap of blacken ruin cort might have cri over mexico with
isaiah the prophet thy pomp is brought down to the grave and the
nois of thy viol the worm is spread under thee and the worm cover
thee how art thou fallen from heaven o lucif son of the morn
how art thou cut down to the ground which didst weaken the nation
in all these fight i took my part though it doe not becom me to
boast my prowess still the spaniard knew me well and thei had good
reason whenev thei saw me thei would greet me with revil call
me traitor and renegad and guatemoc white dog and moreov
cort set a price upon my head for he knew through hi spi that
some of guatemoc most success attack and stratagem had been of
my devis but i took no heed even when their insult pierc me like
arrow for though mani of the aztec were my friend and i hate
the spaniard it wa a shame thing that a christian man should be
war on the side of cannib who made human sacrific i took no
heed sinc alwai i wa seek for my foe de garcia he wa there i
knew for i saw him mani time but i could never come at him inde
if i watch for him he also watch for me but with anoth purpos
to avoid me for now as of old de garcia fear me now as of old he
believ that i should bring hi death upon him
it wa the custom of warrior in the oppos armi to send challeng
to singl combat on to anoth and mani such duel were fought in
the sight of all safe conduct be given to the combat and their
second upon a dai despair of meet him face to face in battl
i sent a challeng to de garcia by a herald under hi fals name of
sarceda in an hour the herald return with thi messag written on
paper in spanish
christian men do not fight duel with renegad heathen dog white
worshipp of devil and eater of human flesh there is but on
weapon which such cannot defil a rope and it wait for you thoma
wingfield
i tore the write to piec and stamp upon it in my rage for now
to all hi other crime against me de garcia had ad the blackest
insult but wrath avail me noth for i could never come near him
though onc with ten of my otomi i charg into the heart of the
spanish column after him
from that rush i alon escap aliv the ten otomi were sacrif to
my hate
how shall i paint the horror that dai by dai were heap upon the
doom citi soon all the food wa gone and men ay and wors still
tender women and children must eat such meat as swine would have turn
from strive to keep life in them for a littl longer grass the bark
of tree slug and insect wash down with brackish water from
the lake these were their best food these and the flesh of captiv
offer in sacrific now thei began to die by hundr and by
thousand thei di so fast that none could buri them where thei
perish there thei lai till at length their bodi bred a plagu
a black and horribl fever that swept off thousand more who in turn
becam the root of pestil for on who wa kill by the spaniard
and their alli two were swept off by hunger and plagu think then
what wa the number of dead when not less than seventi thousand perish
beneath the sword and by fire alon inde it is said that forti
thousand di in thi manner in a singl dai the dai befor the last of
the sieg
on night i came back to the lodg where otomi dwelt with her royal
sister tecuichpo the wife of guatemoc for now all the palac had been
burnt down i wa starv for i had scarc tast food for forti
hour but all that my wife could set befor me were three littl meal
cake or tortilla mix with bark she kiss me and bade me eat
them but i discov that she herself had touch no food that dai so
i would not till she share them then i note that she could scarc
swallow the bitter morsel and also that she strove to hide tear which
ran down her face
what is it wife i ask
then otomi broke out into a great and bitter cry and said
thi my belov for two dai the milk ha been dry in my
breasthung ha dri itand our babe is dead look he li dead
and she drew asid a cloth and show me the tini bodi
hush i said he is spare much can we then desir that a child
should live to see such dai as we have seen and after all to die at
last
he wa our son our firstborn she cri again oh why must we
suffer thu
we must suffer otomi becaus we ar born to it just so much
happi is given to us as shall save us from mad and no more ask
me not why for i cannot answer you there is no answer in my faith or
in ani other
and then look on that dead babe i wept also everi hour in those
terribl month it wa my lot to see a thousand sight more aw and
yet thi sight of a dead infant move me the most of all of them the
child wa mine my firstborn it mother wept besid me and it stiff
and tini finger seem to drag at my heart string seek not the caus
for the almighti who gave the heart it infinit power of pain alon can
answer and to our ear he is dumb
then i took a mattock and dug a hole outsid the hous till i came to
water which in tenoctitlan is found at a depth of two feet or so and
have mutter a prayer over him there in the water i laid the bodi of
our child buri it out of sight at the least he wa not left for the
zapilot as the aztec call the vultur like the rest of them
after that we wept ourselv to sleep in each other arm otomi
murmur from time to time oh my husband i would that we were
asleep and forgotten we and the babe togeth
rest now i answer for death is veri near to us
the morrow came and with it a deadlier frai than ani that had gone
befor and after it more morrow and more death but still we live
on for guatemoc gave us of hi food then cort sent hi herald
demand our surrend and now threefourth of the citi wa a ruin
and threefourth of it defend were dead the dead were heap in
the hous like bee stifl in a hive and in the street thei lai so
thick that we walk upon them
the council wa summonedfierc men haggard with hunger and with war
and thei consid the offer of cort
what is your word guatemoc said their spokesman at last
am i montezuma that you ask me i swore to defend thi citi to the
last he answer hoars and for my part i will defend it better
that we should all die than that we should fall live into the hand
of the teul
so sai we thei repli and the war went on
at length there came a dai when the spaniard made a new attack and
gain anoth portion of the citi there the peopl were huddl
togeth like sheep in a pen we strove to defend them but our arm
were weak with famin thei fire into us with their piec mow us
down like corn befor the sickl then the tlascalan were loos upon
us like fierc hound upon a defenceless buck and on thi dai it is
said that there di forti thousand peopl for none were spare on
the morrow it wa the last dai of the sieg came a fresh embassi from
cort ask that guatemoc should meet him the answer wa the same
for noth could conquer that nobl spirit
tell him said guatemoc that i will die where i am but that i will
hold no parlei with him we ar helpless let cort work hi pleasur
on us
by now all the citi wa destroi and we who remain aliv within it
bound were gather on the causewai and behind the ruin of wall
men women and children togeth
here thei attack us again the great drum on the teocal beat for the
last time and for the last time the wild scream of the aztec warrior
went up to heaven we fought our best i kill four men that dai with
my arrow which otomi who wa at my side hand me as i shot but the
most of us had not the strength of a child and what could we do thei
came among us like seamen among a flock of seal and slaughter us by
hundr thei drove us into the canal and trod us to death there till
bridg were made of our bodi how we escap i do not know
at length a parti of us among whom wa guatemoc with hi wife
tecuichpo were driven to the shore of the lake where lai cano and
into these we enter scarc know what we did but think that
we might escap for now all the citi wa taken the brigantin saw us
and sail after us with a favour windth wind alwai favour the
foe in that warand row as we would on of them came up with us and
began to fire into us then guatemoc stood up and spoke sai
i am guatemoc bring me to malinch but spare those of my peopl who
remain aliv
now i said to otomi at my side my hour ha come for the spaniard
will sure hang me and it is in my mind wife that i should do well
to kill myself so that i mai be save from a death of shame
nai husband she answer sadli as i said in bygon dai while you
live there is hope but the dead come back no more fortun mai favour
us yet still if you think otherwis i am readi to die
that i will not suffer otomi
then you must hold your hand husband for now as alwai where you go
i follow
listen i whisper do not let it be known that you ar my wife
pass yourself as on of the ladi of tecuichpo the queen your sister
if we ar separ and if by ani chanc i escap i will try to make
my wai to the citi of pine there among your own peopl we mai find
refug
so be it belov she answer smile sadli but i do not know
how the otomi will receiv me who have led twenti thousand of their
bravest men to a dread death
now we were on the deck of the brigantin and must stop talk and
thenc after the spaniard had quarrel over us a while we were
taken ashor and led to the top of a hous which still stood where
cort had made readi hurriedli to receiv hi royal prison
surround by hi escort the spanish gener stood cap in hand and by
hi side wa marina grown more love than befor whom i now met for
the first time sinc we had part in tobasco
our ey met and she start therebi show that she knew me again
though it must have been hard for marina to recognis her friend teul
in the bloodstain starv and tatter wretch who could scarc
find strength to climb the azotea but at that time no word pass
between us for all ey were bent on the meet between cort and
guatemoc between the conqueror and the conquer
still proud and defiant though he seem but a live skeleton
guatemoc walk straight to where the spaniard stood and spoke marina
translat hi word

by either arm thei led me across the roof of the hous toward the

though with fear and exhaust i fell at her feet the soldier who
led me laugh brutal and on of them kick me with hi heavi boot
but otomi stoop down and held her hand to me to help me rise and as

gentl from that woman she is starv yet she leav her food to
help your prison to hi feet now take him awai to the camp and see
that he come to no harm for he can tell me much
then the soldier led me awai grumbl as thei went and the last
thing that i saw wa the despair face of otomi my wife as she gaze
after me faint with the secret agoni of our part but when i came
to the head of the stairwai guatemoc who stood near took my hand and
shook it
farewel my brother he said with a heavi smile the game we plai
togeth is finish and now it is time for us to rest i thank you for
your valour and your aid
farewel guatemoc i answer you ar fallen but let thi comfort
you in your fall you have found immort fame
on on growl the soldier and i went littl think how guatemoc
and i should meet again
thei took me to a cano and we were paddl across the lake by
tlascalan till at length we came to the spanish camp all the journei
through my guard though thei laid no hand on me fear the anger
of cort mock and taunt me ask me how i like the wai of the
heathen and whether i at the flesh of the sacrific raw or cook
and mani anoth such brutal jest thei made at my expens for a while i
bore it for i had learn to be patient from the indian but at last i
answer them in few word and bitter
peac coward i said rememb that i am helpless and that were i
befor you strong and arm either i should not live to listen to such
word or you would not live to repeat them
then thei were silent and i also wa silent
when we reach their camp i wa led through it follow by a throng of
fierc tlascalan and other who would have torn me limb from limb had
thei not fear to do so i saw some spaniard also but the most
of these were so drunk with mescal and with joi at the tide that
tenoctitlan had fallen and their labour were end at last that thei
took no heed of me never did i see such mad as possess them for
these poor fool believ that henceforth thei should eat their veri
bread off plate of gold it wa for gold that thei had follow cort
for gold thei had brave the altar of sacrific and fought in a hundr
fight and now as thei thought thei had won it
the room of the stone hous where thei prison me had a window secur
by bar of wood and through these bar i could see and hear the
revel of the soldier dure the time of my confin all dai
long when thei were not on duti and most of the night also thei
gambl and drank stake ten of peso on a singl throw which
the loser must pai out of hi share of the countless treasur of the
aztec littl did thei care if thei won or lost thei were so sure
of plunder but plai on till drink overpow them and thei roll
senseless beneath the tabl or till thei sprang up and danc wildli
to and fro catch at the sunbeam and scream gold gold gold
listen at thi window also i gather some of the tide of the
camp i learn that cort had come back bring guatemoc and sever
of the princ with him togeth with mani of the nobl aztec ladi
inde i saw and heard the soldier gambl for these women when thei
were weari of their plai for monei a descript of each of them
be written on a piec of paper on of these ladi answer well to
otomi my wife and she wa put up to auction by the brute who won her
in the gambl and sold to a common soldier for a hundr peso for
these men never doubt but that the women and the gold would be hand
over to them
thu thing went for sever dai dure which i sat and slept in my
prison untroubl by ani except the nativ woman who wait on me and
brought me food in plenti dure those dai i at as i have never eaten
befor or sinc and i slept much for my sorrow could not rid my bodi
of it appetit and command need for food and rest inde i verili
believ that at the end of a week i had increas in weight by a full
half also my weari wa conquer at length and i wa strong again
but when i wa neither sleep nor eat i watch at my window
hope though in vain to catch some sight of otomi or of guatemoc
if i might not see my friend howev at least i saw my foe for on
even de garcia came and stare at my prison he could not see me but
i saw him and the devilish smile that flicker on hi face as he went
awai like a wolf made me shiver with a presag of woe to come for ten
minut or more he stood gaze at my window hungrili as a cat gaze at
a cage bird and i felt that he wa wait for the door to be open
and knew that it would soon be open
thi happen on the ev of the dai upon which i wa put to tortur
meanwhil as time went on i notic that a chang came over the temper
of the camp the soldier ceas to gambl for untold wealth thei even
ceas from drink to excess and from their riotou joi but took to
hang togeth in knot discuss fierc i could not learn of what
on the dai when de garcia came to look at my prison there wa a great
gather in the squar opposit my prison to which i saw cort ride
up on a white hors and richli dress the meet wa too far awai for
me to overhear what pass but i note that sever offic address

the escap
now otomi put the rope off her neck and descend from the stool
stood befor marina
you ar marina she said coldli and proudli and you come to save
us you who have brought ruin on the land that bore you and have given
thousand of her children to death and shame and torment now if i
had my wai i would have none of your salvat nai i would rather
save myself as i wa about to do
thu otomi spoke and never had she look more royal than in thi
moment when she risk her last chanc of life that she might pour
out her scorn upon on whom she deem a traitress no on who wa a
traitress for had it not been for marina wit and aid cort would
never have conquer anahuac i trembl as i heard her angri word
for all i suffer notwithstand life still seem sweet to me who
ten second ago had stood upon the verg of death sure marina would
depart and leav us to our doom but it wa not so inde she shrank
and trembl befor otomi contempt thei were a strang contrast in
their differ loveli as thei stood face to face in the tortur
den and it wa strang also to see the spirit of the ladi of royal
blood threaten as she wa with a shame death or still more
shame life triumph over the indian girl whom todai fortun had set
as far abov her as the star
sai royal ladi ask marina in her gentl voic for what caus
did you if tale ar true lie by the side of yonder white man upon the
stone of sacrific
becaus i love him marina
and for thi same caus have i marina laid my honour upon a differ
altar for thi same caus i have striven against the children of my
peopl becaus i love anoth such as he it is for love of cort that
i have aid cort therefor despis me not but let your love plead
for mine see that to us women love is all i have sin i know
but doubtless in it season my sin shall find a fit punish
it had need be sharp answer otomi my love ha harm none see
befor you but on grain of the countless harvest of your own in yonder
chair guatemoc your king wa thi dai tortur by your master cort
who swore to treat him with all honour by hi side sat teul my
husband and your friend him cort gave over to ha privat enemi
de garcia whom you name sarceda see how he ha left him nai do not
shudder gentl ladi look now at hi wound consid to what a pass we
ar driven when you find us about to die thu like dog he my husband
that he mai not live to see me handl as he ha been and i with him
becaus a princess of the otomi and of montezuma blood cannot submit
to such a shame while death ha on door through which to creep it is
but a singl grain of your harvest outcast and traitress the harvest
of miseri and death that is store yonder in the ruin of tenoctitlan
had i my will i tell you that i had sooner die a score of time than
take help from a hand so stain with the blood of my peopl and of
yoursi
oh ceas ladi ceas groan marina cover her ey with her
hand as though the sight of otomi were dread to her what is done
is done do not add to my remors what did you sai that you the ladi
otomi were brought here to be tortur
even so and befor my husband ey why should montezuma daughter
and the princess of the otomi escap the fate of the emperor of the
aztec if her womanhood doe not protect her ha she anyth to hope
of her lost rank
cort know noth of thi i swear it said marina to the rest
he ha been driven by the clamour of the soldier who taunt him with
steal treasur that he ha never found but of thi last wicked
he is innoc
then let him ask hi tool sarceda of it
as for sarceda i promis you princess that if i can i will aveng
thi threat upon him but time is short i am come here with the
knowledg of cort to see if i can win the secret of the treasur from
teul your husband and for my friendship sake i am about to betrai
my trust and help him and you to fly do you refus my aid
otomi said noth but i spoke for the first time
nai marina i have no love for thi thief fate if i can escap it
but how is it to be done
the chanc is poor enough teul but i bethought me that onc out of
thi prison you might slip awai disguis few will be stir at dawn
and of them the most will not be keen to notic men or thing see i
have brought you the dress of a spanish soldier your skin is dark and
in the half light you might pass as on and for the princess your wife
i have brought anoth dress inde i am asham to offer it but it is
the onli on that will not be note at thi hour also teul i bring
you a sword that which wa taken from you though i think that onc it
had anoth owner
now while she spoke marina undid her bundl and there in it were the
dress and the sword the same that i had taken from the spaniard diaz
in the massacr of the noch trist first she drew out the woman robe
and hand it to otomi and i saw that it wa such a robe as among
the indian is worn by the women who follow camp a robe with red and
yellow in it otomi saw it also and drew back
sure girl you have brought a garment of your own in error she
said quietli but in such a fashion as show more of the savag heart
that is nativ to her race than she often suffer to be seen at the
least i cannot wear such robe
it seem that i must bear too much answer marina grow wroth at
last and strive to keep back the tear that start to her ey i
will awai and leav you and she began to roll up her bundl
forgiv her marina i said hastili for the desir to escap grew on
me everi minut sorrow ha set an edg upon her tongu then turn
to otomi i ad i prai you be more gentl wife for my sake if not
for your own marina is our onli hope
would that she had left us to die in peac husband well so be it
for your sake i will put on these garment of a drab but how shall we
escap out of thi place and the camp will the door be open to us
and the guard remov and if we pass them can you walk husband
the door will not be open ladi said marina for those wait
without who will see that thei ar lock when i have pass them but
there will be noth to fear from the guard trust to me for it see
the bar of thi window ar but of wood that sword will soon sever
them and if you ar seen you must plai the part of a drunken soldier
be guid to hi quarter by a woman for the rest i know noth
save that i run great risk for your sake sinc if it is discov
that i have aid you then i shall find it hard to soften the rage of
cort who the war be won and she sigh doe not need me now
so much as onc he did
i can make shift to hop on my right foot i said and for the rest we
must trust to fortun it can give us no wors gift than those we have
alreadi
so be it teul and now farewel for i dare stai no longer i can
do noth more mai your good star shine on you and lead you henc
in safeti and teul if we never meet again i prai you think of me
kindli for there ar mani in the world who will do otherwis in the
dai to come
farewel marina i said and she wa gone
we heard the door close behind her and the distant voic of those who
bore her litter then all wa silenc otomi listen at the window for
a while but the guard seem to be gone where or why i do not know to
thi hour and the onli sound wa that of distant revelri from the camp
and now to the work i said to otomi
as you wish husband but i fear it will be profitless i do not trust
that woman faithless in all without doubt she betrai us still at the
worst you have the sword and can us it
it matter littl i answer our plight cannot be wors than it is
now life ha no greater evil than torment and death and thei ar with
us alreadi
then i sat upon the stool and my arm be left sound and strong i
hack with the sharp sword at the wooden bar of the window sever
them on by on till there wa a space big enough for us to creep
through thi be done and no on have appear to disturb us
otomi clad me in the cloth of a spanish soldier which marina had
brought for i could not dress myself what i suffer in the don of
those garment and more especi in the pull of the long boot
on to my burnt foot can never be told but more than onc i stop
ponder whether it would not be better to die rather than to endur
such agoni at last it wa done and otomi must put on the red and
yellow robe a garb of shame such as mani honest indian women would die
sooner than be seen in and i think that as she did thi her agoni wa
greater than mine though of anoth sort for to her proud heart that
dress wa a veri shirt of nessu present she wa clad and minc
befor me with savag mockeri sai
prithe soldier do i look my part
a peac to such fool i answer our live ar at stake what
doe it matter how we disguis ourselv
it matter much husband but how can you understand who ar a man and
a foreign now i will clamber through the window and you must
follow me if you can if not i will return to you and we will end thi
masquerad
then she pass through the hole swiftli for otomi wa agil and
strong as an ocelot and mount the stool i made shift to follow her
as well as my hurt would allow in the end i wa abl to throw myself
upon the sill of the window and there i wa stretch out like a dead
cat till she drew me across it and i fell with her to the ground on the
further side and lai groan she lift me to my feet or rather to
my foot for i could us but on of them and we stare round us no on
wa to be seen and the sound of revelri had di awai for the crest of
popo wa alreadi red with the sunlight and the dawn grew in the vallei
where to i said
now otomi had been allow to walk in the camp with her sister the
wife of guatemoc and other aztec ladi and she had thi gift in
common with most indian that where she had onc pass there she could
pass again even in the darkest night
to the south gate she whisper perhap it is unguard now that
the war is done at the least i know the road thither
so we start i lean on her shoulder and hop on my right foot
and thu veri painfulli we travers some three hundr yard meet
nobodi but now our good luck fail us for pass round the corner
of some build we came face to face with three soldier return to
their hut from a midnight revel and with them some nativ servant
whom have we here said the first of these your name comrad

leav the sot my pretti and come and walk with us and he caught her
by the arm but she turn on him with so fierc a look that he let
her go again astonish and we stagger on till the corner of anoth
hous hid us from their view here i sank to the ground overcom with
pain for while the soldier were in sight i wa oblig to us my
wound foot lest thei should suspect but otomi pull me up sai
ala belov we must pass on or perish
i rose groan and by what effort i reach the south gate i cannot
describ though i thought that i must die befor i came there at last
it wa befor us and as chanc would have it the spanish guard were
asleep in the guardhous three tlascalan onli were crouch over a
littl fire their zerap or blanket about their head for the dawn

bid her begon and me with her alreadi we had pass the gate when
a sudden faint seiz me and i stumbl and fell roll over on

reach the edg of the alo plant and there we sank togeth to the
earth i cast my ey back over the path which we had travel round

with a great wonder that grew slowli to a whirl nothing for a

lift spear and of otomi run toward them with outstretch
arm

chapter xxxi
otomi plead with her peopl
when i awok it wa to find myself in a cave where the light shone veri
dimli otomi leant over me and not far awai a man wa cook a pot
over a fire made of dry alo leav
where am i and what ha happen i ask
you ar safe belov she answer at least for awhil when you
have eaten i will tell you more
she brought me broth and food and i at eagerli and when i wa
satisfi she spoke
you rememb how the tlascalan follow us and howi wa rid of him
i rememb otomi though how you found strength to kill him i do not
understand
love and despair gave it to me and i prai that i mai never have such
anoth need do not speak of it husband for thi is more horribl to
me than all that ha been befor on thing comfort me howev i did
not kill him the sword twist in my hand and i believ that he wa
but stun then we fled a littl wai and look back i saw that two
other tlascalan companion of the senseless man were follow us
and him present thei came up to where he lai and stare at him then
thei start on our track run hard and veri soon thei must have
caught us for now you could scarc stir your mind wa gone and i
had no more strength to carri you still we stumbl on till present
when the pursuer were within fifti pace of us i saw arm men eight
of them rush at us from the bush thei were of my own peopl the
otomi soldier that had serv under you who watch the spanish
camp and see a spaniard alon thei came to slai him thei veri
nearli did so inde for at first i wa so breathless that i could
scarc speak but at last in few word i made shift to declar my name
and rank and your sad plight by now the two tlascalan were upon us
and i call to the men of the otomi to protect us and fall on the
tlascalan befor thei knew that enemi were there thei kill on of
them and took the other prison then thei made a litter and place
you on it bore you without rest twenti leagu into the mountain till
thei reach thi secret hide place and here you have lain three dai
and night the teul have search for you far and wide but thei have
search in vain onli yesterdai two of them with ten tlascalan pass
within a hundr pace of thi cave and i had much ado to prevent our
peopl from attack them now thei ar gone whenc thei came and i
think that we ar safe for a time soon you will be better and we can go
henc
where can we go to otomi we ar bird without a nest
we must seek shelter in the citi of pine or fly across the water
there is no other choic husband
we cannot try the sea otomi for all the ship that come here ar
spanish and i do not know how thei will greet us in the citi of pine
now that our caus is lost and with it so mani thousand of their
warrior
we must take the risk husband there ar still true heart in anahuac
who will stand by us in our sorrow and their own at the least we have
escap from greater danger now let me dress your wound and rest
awhil
so for three more dai i lai in the cave of the mountain and otomi
tend me and at the end of that time my state wa such that i could
travel in a litter though for some week i wa unabl to set foot to
the ground on the fourth dai we start by night and i wa carri on
men shoulder till at length we pass up the gorg that lead to the
citi of pine here we were stop by sentri to whom otomi told our
tale bid some of them go forward and repeat it to the captain of
the citi we follow the messeng slowli for my bearer were weari
and came to the gate of the beauti town just as the red rai of
sunset struck upon the snowi pinnacl of xaca that tower behind it
turn her cap of smoke to a sullen red like that of molten iron
the new of our come had spread about and here and there knot of
peopl were gather to watch us pass for the most part thei stood
silent but now and again some woman whose husband or son had perish
in the sieg would hiss a curs at us
ala how differ wa our state thi dai to what it had been when not
a year befor we enter the citi of pine for the first time then we
were escort by an armi ten thousand strong then musician had sung
befor us and our path wa strewn with flower and now now we came two
fugit from the vengeanc of the teul i born in a litter by four
tire soldier while otomi the princess of thi peopl still clad in
her wanton robe at which the women mock for she had been abl to
come by no other tramp at my side sinc there were none to carri
her and the inhabit of the place curs us as the author of their
woe nor did we know if thei would stop at word
at length we cross the squar beneath the shadow of the teocal and
reach the ancient and sculptur palac as the light fail and the
smoke on xaca the holi hill began to glow with the fire in it heart
here small prepar had been made to receiv us and that night we
sup by the light of a torch upon tortilla or meal cake and water
like the humblest in the land then we crept to our rest and as i lai
awak becaus of the pain of my hurt i heard otomi who thought that
i slept break into low sob at my side her proud spirit wa humbl
at last and she whom i had never known to weep except onc when our
firstborn di in the sieg wept bitterli
why do you sorrow thu otomi i ask at length
i did not know that you were awak husband she sob in answer
or i would have check my grief husband i sorrow over all that ha
befallen us and my peoplealso though these ar but littl thing
becaus you ar brought low and treat as a man of no estat and of
the cold comfort that we find here
you have caus wife i answer sai what will these otomi do
with uskil us or give us up to the teul
i do not know tomorrow we shall learn but for my part i will not be
surrend live
nor i wife death is better than the tender merci of cort and hi
minist de garcia is there ani hope
ye there is hope belov now the otomi ar cast down and thei
rememb that we led the flower of their land to death but thei ar
brave and gener at heart and if i can touch them there all mai yet
be well weari pain and memori make us weak who should be full of
courag have escap so mani ill sleep my husband and leav me to
think all shall yet go well for even misfortun ha an end
so i slept and woke in the morn somewhat refresh and with a
happier mind for who is there that is not bolder when the light shine
on him and he is renew by rest
when i open my ey the sun wa alreadi high but otomi had risen
with the dawn and she had not been idl dure those three hour
for on thing she had contriv to obtain food and fresh raiment more
befit to our rank than the rag in which we were cloth also she
had brought togeth certain men of condit who were friendli and
loyal to her in misfortun and these she sent about the citi let
it be known that she would address the peopl at middai from the step
of the palac for as otomi knew well the heartstr of a crowd ar
touch more easili than those of cold and ancient counsellor
will thei come to listen i ask
have no fear she answer the desir to look upon us who have
surviv the sieg and to know the truth of what ha happen will
bring them moreov some will be there seek vengeanc on us
otomi wa right for as the morn drew on toward middai i saw the
dweller in the citi of pine gather in thousand till the space
between the step of the palac and the face of the pyramid wa black
with them now otomi comb her curl hair and place flower in it
and set a gleam feather cloak about her shoulder so that it hung
down over her white robe and on her breast that splendid necklac of
emerald which guatemoc had given to me in the treasur chamber and
which she had preserv safe through all our evil fortun and a
golden girdl about her waist in her hand also she took a littl
sceptr of eboni tip with gold that wa in the palac with other
ornament and emblem of rank and thu attir though she wa worn
with travel and suffer and grief had dim her beauti for a while
she seem the queenliest woman that my ey have seen next she caus
me to be laid upon my rude litter and when the hour of noon wa come
she command those soldier who had born me across the mountain to
carri me by her side thu we issu from the wide doorwai of the palac
and took our stand upon the platform at the head of the step as we
came a great cry rose from the thousand of the peopl a fierc cry
like that of wild beast howl for their prei higher and higher it
rose a sound to strike terror into the bravest heart and by degre i
caught it purport
kill them said the cry give the liar to the teul
otomi step forward to the edg of the platform and lift the
eboni sceptr she stood silent the sunlight beat on her love face
and form but the multitud scream a thousand taunt and threat at
us and still the tumult grew onc thei rush toward her as though
to tear her to piec but fell back at the last stair as a wave fall
from a rock and onc a spear wa thrown that pass between her neck
and shoulder
now the soldier who had carri me make certain that our death wa
at hand and have no wish to share it set my litter down upon the
stone and slip back into the palac but all thi while otomi never
so much as move no not even when the spear hiss past her she stood
befor them state and scorn a veri queen among women and littl
by littl the majesti of her presenc and the great of her courag
hush them to silenc when there wa quiet at length she spoke in a
clear voic that carri far
am i among my own peopl of the otomi she ask bitterli or have
we lost our path and wander perchanc among some savag tlascalan
tribe listen peopl of the otomi i have but on voic and none can
reason with a multitud choos you a tongu to speak for you and let
him set out the desir of your heart
now the tumult began again for some shout on name and some anoth
but in the end a priest and nobl name maxtla step forward a man
of great power among the otomi who abov all had favour an allianc
with the spaniard and oppos the send of an armi to aid guatemoc
in the defenc of tenoctitlan nor did he come alon for with him were
four chief whom by their dress i knew to be tlascalan and envoi from
cort then my heart sank for it wa not difficult to guess the object
of their come
speak on maxtla said otomi for we must hear what there is for us
to answer and you peopl of the otomi i prai you keep silenc that
you mai judg between us when there is an end of talk
now a great silenc fell upon the multitud who press togeth like
sheep in a pen and strain their ear to catch the word of maxtla
my speech with you princess and the teul your outlaw husband
shall be short and sharp he began roughli a while henc you came
hither to seek an armi to aid cuitlahua emperor of the aztec in hi
struggl with the teul the son of quetzal that armi wa given you
against the wish of mani of us for you won over the council by the
honei of your word and we who urg caution or even an allianc with
the white men the children of god were overrul you went henc
and twenti thousand men the flower of our peopl follow you to
tenoctitlan where ar thei now i will tell you some two hundr of
them have crept back home the rest fly to and fro through the air in
the gizzard of the zaphilot or crouch on the earth in the belli
of jackal death ha them all and you led them to their death is it
then much that we should seek the live of you two in payment for those
of twenti thousand of our son our husband and our father but we do
not even ask thi here besid me stand ambassador from malinch the
captain of the teul who reach our citi but an hour ago thi is the
demand that thei bring from malinch and in hi own word
deliv back to me otomi the daughter of montezuma and the renegad
her paramour who is known as teul and who ha fled from the justic
due to hi crime and it shall be well with you peopl of the otomi
hide them or refus to deliv them and the fate of the citi of pine
shall be as the fate of tenoctitlan queen of the vallei choos then
between my love and my wrath peopl of the otomi if you obei the
past shall be forgiven and my yoke will be light upon you if you
refus your citi shall be stamp flat and your veri name wipe out of
the record of the world
sai messeng of malinch ar not these the word of malinch
thei ar hi veri word maxtla said the spokesman of the embassi
now again there wa a tumult among the peopl and voic cri give
them up give them to malinch as a peac offer otomi stood
forward to speak and it di awai for all desir to hear her word
then she spoke
it seem peopl of the otomi that i am on my trial befor my own
vassal and my husband with me well i will plead our caus as well as
a woman mai and have the power you shall judg between us and maxtla
and hi alli malinch and the tlascalan what is our offenc it is
that we came hither by the command of cuitlahua to seek your aid in hi
war with the teul what did i tell you then i told you that if the
peopl of anahuac would not stand togeth against the white men thei
must be broken on by on like the stick of an unbound faggot and cast
into the flame did i speak li nai i spoke truth for through
the treason of her tribe and chiefli through the treason of the
tlascalan anahuac is fallen and tenoctitlan is a ruin sown with dead
like a field with corn
it is true cri a voic
ye peopl of the otomi it is true but i sai that had all the
warrior of the nation of anahuac plai the part that your son
plai the tale had run otherwis thei ar dead and becaus of their
death you would deliv us to our foe and your but i for on do not
mourn them though among their number ar mani of my kin nai be not
wroth but listen it is better that thei should lie dead in honour
have earn for themselv a wreath of fame and an immort dwell
in the hous of the sun than that thei should live to be slave which
it seem is your desir peopl of the otomi there is no fals word
in what i said to you now the stick that malinch ha us to beat out
the brain of guatemoc shall be broken and burnt to cook the pot of the
teul alreadi these fals children ar hi slave have you not heard
hi command that the tribe hi alli shall labour in the quarri and
the street till the gloriou citi which he ha burn rise afresh upon
the face of the water will you not hasten to take your share in the
work peopl of the otomi the work that know no rest and no reward
except the lash of the overs and the curs of the teul sure you
will hasten peopl of the mountain your hand ar shape to the spade
and the trowel not to the bow and the spear and it will be sweeter to
toil to do the will and swell the wealth of malinch in the sun of the
vallei or the shadow of the mine than to bide here free upon your hill
where as yet no foe ha set hi foot
again she paus and a murmur of doubt and unrest went through the
thousand who listen maxtla step forward and would have spoken
but the peopl shout him down cry otomi otomi let us hear
the word of otomi
i thank you my peopl she said for i have still much to tell you
our crime is then that we drew an armi after us to fight against the
teul and how did we draw thi armi did i command you to muster your
arrai nai i set out my case and i said now choos you chose and of
your own free will you despatch those gloriou compani that now ar
dead my crime is therefor that you chose wrongli as you sai but as i
still hold most rightli and becaus of thi crime i and my husband ar
to be given as a peac offer to the teul listen let me tell you
someth of those war in which we have fought befor you give us to
the teul and our mouth ar silent for ever where shall i begin i
know not stai i bore a childhad he live he would have been your
princ todai that child i saw starv to death befor my ey inch by
inch and dai by dai i saw him starv but it is noth who am i that
i should complain becaus i have lost my son when so mani of your son
ar dead and their blood is requir at my hand listen again and
she went on to tell in burn word of the horror of the sieg of the
cruelti of the spaniard and of the braveri of the men of the otomi
whom i had command for a full hour she spoke thu while all that
vast audienc hung upon her word also she told of the part that i
plai in the struggl and of the deed which i had done and now and
again some soldier in the crowd who serv under me and who had escap
the famin and the massacr cri out
it is true we saw it with our ey
and so she said at last it wa finish at last tenoctitlan wa a
ruin and my cousin and my king the gloriou guatemoc lai a prison
in the hand of malinch and with him my husband teul my sister i
myself and mani anoth malinch swore that he would treat guatemoc
and hi follow with all honour do you know how he treat him
within a few dai guatemoc our king wa seat in the chair of torment
while slave burn him with hot iron to caus him to declar the
hide place of the treasur of montezuma ay you mai well cry shame
upon him you shall cry it yet more loudli befor i have done for know
that guatemoc did not suffer alon on li there who suffer with him
and spoke no word and i also your princess wa doom to torment
we escap when death wa at our door for i told my husband that
the peopl of the otomi had true heart and would shelter us in our
sorrow and for hi sake i otomi disguis myself in the robe of a
wanton and fled with him hither could i have known what i should live
to see and hear could i have dream that you would receiv us thu i
had di a hundr death befor i came to stand and plead for piti at
your hand
oh my peopl my peopl i beseech of you make no term with the
fals teul but remain bold and free your neck ar not fit to the
yoke of the slave your son and daughter ar of too high a blood to
serv the foreign in hi need and pleasur defi malinch some of
our race ar dead but mani thousand remain here in your mountain nest
you can beat back everi teul in anahuac as in bygon year the fals
tlascalan beat back the aztec then the tlascalan were free now thei
ar a race of serf sai will you share their serfdom my peopl my
peopl think not that i plead for myself or even for the husband who
is more dear to me than aught save honour do you inde dream that
we will suffer you to hand us live to these dog of tlascalan whom
malinch insult you by send as hi messeng look and she walk
to where the spear that had been hurl at her lai upon the pavement and
lift it here is a mean of death that some friend ha sent us and
if you will not listen to my plead you shall see it us befor your
ey then if you will you mai send our bodi to malinch as a peac
offer but for your own sake i plead with you defi malinch and
if you must die at last die as free men and not as the slave of the
teul behold now hi tender merci and see the lot that shall be
your if you take anoth counsel the counsel of maxtla and come to
the litter on which i lai swiftli otomi rent my robe from me leav
me almost nake to the waist and unwound the bandag from my wound
limb then lift me up so that i rest upon my sound foot
look she cri in a pierc voic and point to the scar and
unheal wound upon my face and leg look on the work of the teul
and the tlascalan see how the foe is dealt with who surrend to them
yield if you will desert us if you will but i sai that then your own
bodi shall be mark in a like fashion till not an ounc of gold is
left that can minist to the greed of the teul or a man or a maiden
who can labour to satisfi hi indol
then she ceas and let me sink gentli to the ground for i could
not stand alon she stood over me the spear in her hand as though
wait to plung it to my heart should the peopl still demand our
surrend to the messeng of cort
for on instant there wa silenc then of a sudden the clamour and the
tumult broke out again ten time more furious than at first but it
wa no longer aim at us otomi had conquer her nobl word her
beauti the tale of our sorrow and the sight of my torment had done
their work and the heart of the peopl wa fill with furi against the
teul who had destroi their armi and the tlascalan that had aid
them never did the wit and eloqu of a woman caus a swifter chang
thei scream and tore their robe and shook their weapon in the air
maxtla strove to speak but thei pull him down and present he wa
fly for hi life then thei turn upon the tlascalan envoi and beat
them with stick cry
thi is our answer to malinch run you dog and take it till thei
were driven from the town
now at length the turmoil ceas and some of the great chief came
forward and kiss the hand of otomi said
princess we your children will guard you to the death for you have
put anoth heart into us you ar right it is better to die free than
to live as slave
see my husband said otomi i wa not mistaken when i told you that
my peopl were loyal and true but now we must make readi for war for
thei have gone too far to turn back and when thi tide come to the
ear of malinch he will be like a puma rob of her young now let us
rest i am veri weari
otomi i answer there ha live no greater woman than you upon
thi earth
i cannot tell husband she said smile if i have won your prais
and safeti it is enough for me
chapter xxxii
the end of guatemoc
now for a while we dwelt in quiet at the citi of pine and by slow
degre and with much suffer i recov from the wound that the
cruel hand of de garcia had inflict upon me but we knew that thi
peac could not last and the peopl of the otomi knew it also for had
thei not scourg the envoi of malinch out of the gate of their citi
mani of them were now sorri that thi had been done but it wa done
and thei must reap as thei had sown
so thei made readi for war and otomi wa the presid of their
council in which i share at length came new that a forc of fifti
spaniard with five thousand tlascalan alli were advanc on the citi
to destroi us then i took command of the tribesmen of the otomiether
were ten thousand or more of them all wellarm after their own
fashionand advanc out of the citi till i wa twothird of the wai
down the gorg which lead to it but i did not bring all my armi down
thi gorg sinc there wa no room for them to fight there and i had
anoth plan i sent some seven thousand men round the mountain of
which the secret path were well known to them bid them climb to
the crest of the precipic that border either side of the gorg
and there at certain place where the cliff is sheer and more than on
thousand feet in height to make a great provis of stone
the rest of my armi except five hundr whom i kept with me i
arm with bow and throw spear and station them in ambush in
conveni place where the side of the cliff were broken and in such
fashion that rock from abov could not be roll on them then i sent
trusti men as spi to warn me of the approach of the spaniard and
other whose mission it wa to offer themselv to them as guid
now i thought my plan good and everyth look well and yet it
miss failur but by a veri littl for maxtla our enemi and the
friend of the spaniard wa in my campinde i had brought him with
me that i might watch himand he had not been idl
for when the spaniard were half a dai march from the mouth of the
defil on of those men whom i had told off to watch their advanc
came to me and made it known that maxtla had bribe him to go to the
leader of the spaniard and disclos to him the plan of the ambuscad
thi man had taken the bribe and start on hi errand of treacheri
but hi heart fail him and return he told me all then i caus
maxtla to be seiz and befor nightfal he had paid the price of hi
wicked
on the morn after hi death the spanish arrai enter the pass
halfwai down it i met them with my five hundr men and engag them
but suffer them to drive us back with some loss as thei follow thei
grew bolder and we fled faster till at length we flew down the defil
follow by the spanish hors now some three furlong from it mouth
that lead to the citi of pine thi pass turn and narrow and here
the cliff ar so sheer and high that a twilight reign at the foot of
them
down the narrow wai we ran in seem rout and after us came the
spaniard shout on their saint and flush with victori but
scarc had we turn the corner when thei sang anoth song for those
who were watch a thousand feet abov us gave the signal and down
from on high came a rain of stone and boulder that darken the air
and crash among them crush mani of them on thei struggl see
a wider wai in front where the cliff slope and perhap half of them
won through but here the archer were wait and now in the place of
stone arrow were hail upon them till at length utterli bewild
and unabl to strike a blow in their own defenc thei turn to fly
toward the open countri thi finish the fight for now we assail
their flank and onc more the rock thunder on them from abov and
the end of it wa that those who remain of the spaniard and their
indian alli were driven in utter rout back to the plain beyond the
pass of pine
after thi battl the spaniard troubl us no more for mani year
except by threat and my name grew great among the peopl of the
otomi
on spaniard i rescu from death and afterward i gave him hi liberti
from him i inquir of the do of de garcia or sarceda and learn
that he wa still in the servic of cort but that marina had been
true to her word and had brought disgrac upon him becaus he had
threaten to put otomi to the tortur moreov cort wa angri with
him becaus of our escap the burden of which marina had laid upon hi
shoulder hint that he had taken a bribe to suffer us to pass the
gate
of the fourteen year of my life which follow the defeat of the
spaniard i can speak briefli for compar to the time that had gone
befor thei were year of quiet in them children were born to me and
otomi three son and these children were my great joi for i love
them dearli and thei love me inde except for the strain of their
mother blood thei were english boi and not indian for i christen
them all and taught them our english tongu and faith and their mien
and ey were more english than indian though their skin were dark
but i had no luck with these dear children of mine ani more than i have
had with that which lili bore me two of them diedon from a fever
that all my skill would not avail to cure and anoth by a fall from a
lofti cedar tree which he climb search for a kite nest thu
of the three of themsinc i do not speak now of that infant my
firstborn who perish in the siegether remain to me onli the
eldest and best belov of whom i must tell hereaft
for the rest jointli with otomi i wa name caciqu of the citi
of pine at a great council that wa held after i had destroi the
spaniard and their alli and as such we had wide though not absolut
power by the exercis of thi power in the end i succeed in
abolish the horribl rite of human sacrific though becaus of
thi a larg number of the outli tribe fell awai from our rule and
the enmiti of the priest wa excit against me the last sacrific
except on onli the most terribl of them all of which i will tell
afterward that wa ever celebr on the teocal in front of the
palac took place after the defeat of the spaniard in the pass
when i had dwelt three year in the citi of pine and two son had
been born to me there secret messeng arriv that were sent by
the friend of guatemoc who had surviv the tortur and wa still a
prison in the hand of cort from these messeng we learn that
cort wa about to start upon an expedit to the gulf of hondura
across the countri that is now known as yucatan take guatemoc and
other aztec nobl with him for he fear to leav them behind we heard
also that there wa much murmur among the conquer tribe of anahuac
becaus of the cruelti and extort of the spaniard and mani
thought that the hour had come when a rise against them might be
carri to a success issu
thi wa the prayer of those who sent the envoi that i should rais a
forc of otomi and travel with it across the countri to yucatan and
there with other who would be gather wait a favour opportun
to throw myself upon the spaniard when thei were entangl in the
forest and swamp put them to the sword and releas guatemoc
such wa the first purpos of the plot though it had mani other of
which it is useless to speak see that thei came to noth
when the messag had been deliv i shook my head sadli for i could
see no hope in such a scheme but the chief of the messeng rose and
led me asid sai that he had a word for my ear
guatemoc send these word he said i hear that you my brother ar
free and safe with my cousin otomi in the mountain of the otomi i
ala linger in the prison of the teul like a crippl eagl in a
cage my brother if it is in your power to help me do so i conjur
you by the memori of our ancient friendship and of all that we have
suffer togeth then a time mai still come when i shall rule again in
anahuac and you shall sit at my side
i heard and my heart wa stir for then as to thi hour i love
guatemoc as a brother
go back i said and find mean to tell guatemoc that if i can save
him i will though i have small hope that wai still let him look for
me in the forest of yucatan
now when otomi heard of thi promis of mine she wa vex for she
said that it wa foolish and would onli end in my lose my life still
have given it she held with me that it must be carri out and the
end of it wa that i rais five hundr men and with them set out upon
my long and toilsom march which i time so as to meet cort in the
pass of yucatan at the last moment otomi wish to accompani me but
i forbad it point out that she could leav neither her children nor
her peopl and we part with bitter grief for the first time
of all the hardship that i underw i will not write for two and
a half month we struggl on across mountain and river and through
swamp and forest till at last we reach a mighti desert citi
that is call palenqu by the indian of those part which ha been
uninhabit for mani gener thi citi is the most marvel place
that i have seen in all my travel though much of it is hidden in
bush for wherev the travel wander there he find vast palac of
marbl carven within and without and sculptur teocal and the huge
imag of grin god often have i wonder what nation wa strong
enough to build such a capit and who were the king that dwelt in it
but these ar secret belong to the past and thei cannot be answer
till some learn man ha found the kei to the stone symbol and
write with which the wall of the build ar cover over
in thi citi i hid with my men though it wa no easi task to persuad
them to take up their habit among so mani ghost of the depart
not to speak of the noisom fever and the wild beast and snake that
haunt it for i had inform that the spaniard would pass through
the swamp that li between the ruin and the river and there i hope
to ambush them but on the eighth dai of my hide i learn from spi
that cort had cross the great river higher up and wa cut hi
wai through the forest for of swamp he had pass more than enough so
i hurri also to the river intend to cross it but all that dai and
all that night it rain as it can rain nowher els in the world that
i have seen till at last we wade on our road knee deep in water and
when we came to the ford of the river it wa to find a wide roar
flood that no man could pass in anyth less frail than a yarmouth
her boat so there on the bank we must stai in miseri suffer
mani ill from fever lack of food and plenitud of water till at
length the stream ran down
three dai and night we wait there and on the fourth morn i made
shift to cross lose four men by drown in the passag onc over i
hid my forc in the bush and reed and crept forward with six men onli
to see if i could discov anyth of the whereabout of the spaniard
within an hour i struck the trail that thei had cut through the forest
and follow it cautious present we came to a spot where the forest
wa thin and here cort had camp for there wa heat left in the
ash of hi fire and among them lai the bodi of an indian who had
di from sick not fifti yard from thi camp stood a huge ceiba
a tree that ha a habit of growth not unlik that of our english oak
though it is soft wood and white bark and will increas more in
bulk in twenti year than ani oak mai in a hundr inde i never yet
saw an oak tree so larg as thi ceiba of which i write either in girth
or in it spread of top unless it be the kirbi oak or the tree that
is call the king of scoto which grow at broom that is the next
parish to thi of ditchingham in norfolk on thi ceiba tree mani
zaphilot or vultur were perch and as we crept toward it i saw
what it wa thei came to seek for from the lowest branch of the ceiba
three corps swung in the breez here ar the spaniard footprint
i said let us look at them and we pass beneath the shadow of the
tree
as i came a zaphilot alight on the head of the bodi that hung
nearest to me and it weight or the waft of the fowl wing caus
the dead man to turn round so that he came face to face with me i
look start back then look again and sank to the earth groan
for here wa he whom i had come to seek and save my friend my brother
guatemoc the last emperor of anahuac here he hung in the dim and
desol forest dead by the death of a thief while the vultur
shriek upon hi head i sat bewild and horrorstricken and as
i sat i rememb the proud sign of aztec royalti a bird of prei
clasp an adder in it claw there befor me wa the last of the
stock and behold a bird of prei grip hi hair in it talon a
fit emblem inde of the fall of anahuac and the king of anahuac
i sprang to my feet with an oath and lift the bow i held i sent
an arrow through the vultur and it fell to the earth flutter and
scream then i bade those with me to cut down the corps of guatemoc
and of the princ of tacuba and anoth nobl who hung with him and
hollow a deep grave beneath the tree there i laid them and there i
left them to sleep for ever in it melancholi shadow and thu for the
last time i saw guatemoc my brother whom i came from far to save and
found made readi for burial by the spaniard
then i turn my face homeward for now anahuac had no king to rescu
but it chanc that befor i went i caught a tlascalan who could speak
spanish and who had desert from the armi of cort becaus of the
hardship that he suffer in their toilsom march thi man wa present
at the murder of guatemoc and hi companion and heard the emperor
last word it seem that some knave had betrai to cort that an
attempt would be made to rescu the princ and that thereon cort
command that he should be hung it seem also that guatemoc met hi
death as he had met the misfortun of hi life proudli and without
fear these were hi last word i did ill malinch when i held my
hand from take my own life befor i surrend myself to you then my
heart told me that all your promis were fals and it ha not li to
me i welcom my death for i have live to know shame and defeat and
tortur and to see my peopl the slave of the teul but still i sai
that god will reward you for thi deed
then thei murder him in the midst of a great silenc
and so farewel to guatemoc the most brave the best and the noblest
indian that ever breath and mai the shadow of hi torment and
shame end lie deep upon the fame of cort for so long as the name
of both of them ar rememb among men
for two more month i journei homeward and at length i reach the
citi of pine well though weari and have lost onli forti men by
variou misadventur of travel to find otomi in good health and
overjoi to know me safe whom she thought never to see again but when
i told her what wa the end of her cousin guatemoc she griev bitterli
both for hi sake and becaus the last hope of the aztec wa gone and
she would not be comfort for mani dai
chapter xxxiii
isabella de siguenza is aveng
for mani year after the death of guatemoc i live with otomi at peac
in the citi of pine our countri wa poor and rug and though we
defi the spaniard and paid them no tribut now that cort had gone
back to spain thei had no heart to attempt our conquest save some few
tribe that live in difficult place like ourselv all anahuac wa
in their power and there wa littl to gain except hard blow in the
bring of a remnant of the peopl of the otomi beneath their yoke so
thei let us be till a more conveni season i sai of a remnant of the
otomi for as time went on mani clan submit to the spaniard till
at length we rule over the citi of pine alon and some leagu of
territori about it inde it wa onli love for otomi and respect for
the shadow of her ancient race and name togeth with some rever
for me as on of the unconquer white men and for my skill as a
gener that kept our follow togeth
and now it mai be ask wa i happi in those year i had much to make
me happyno man could have been bless with a wife more beauti and
love nor on who had exampl her affect by more signal deed of
sacrific thi woman of her own free will had lain by my side on the
stone of slaughter overrid the instinct of her sex she had not
shrunk from dip her hand in blood to secur my safeti her wit had
rescu me in mani a troubl her love had consol me in mani a sorrow
sure therefor if gratitud can conquer the heart of man mine should
have been at her feet for ever and a dai and so inde it wa and in a
sens is still but can gratitud can love itself or ani passion that
rule our soul make a man forget the hous where he wa born could
i an indian chief struggl with a fallen peopl against an inevit
destini forget my youth and all it hope and fear could i forget the
vallei of the wavenei and that flower who dwelt therein and forsworn
though i might be could i forget the oath that i onc had sworn chanc
had been against me circumst overpow me and i think that
there ar few who could thei read thi stori would not find in it
excus for all that i had done certainli there ar veri few who
stand where i stood surround as i wa by doubt difficulti and
danger would not have act as i did
and yet memori would rise up against me and time upon time i would lie
awak at night even by the side of otomi and rememb and repent
if a man mai repent of that over which he ha no control for i wa a
stranger in a strang land and though my home wa there and my children
were about me the long for my other home wa yet with me and i
could not put awai the memori of that lili whom i had lost her ring wa
still upon my hand but noth els of her remain to me i did not
know if she were marri or singl live or dead the gulf between us
widen with the widen year but still the thought of her went
with me like my shadow it shone across the stormi love of otomi i
rememb it even in my children kiss and worst of all i despis
myself for these regret nai if the worst can have a wors there wa
on here for though she never spoke of it i fear that otomi had
read my mind
heart to heart though far apart
so ran the write upon lili betroth ring and so it wa with me
far apart we were inde so far that no bridg that i might imagin
could join that distanc and yet i could not sai that we had ceas
from be heart to heart her heart might throb no more but mine
beat still toward it across the land across the sea across the gulf
of deathif she were deadstil in secret must i desir the love that
i had forsworn
and so the year roll on bring littl of chang with them till
i grew sure that here in thi far place i should live and die but that
wa not to be my fate
if ani should read thi the stori of my earli life he will rememb
that the tale of the death of a certain isabella de siguenza is piec
into it motlei he will rememb how thi isabella in the last moment
of her life call down a curs upon that holi father who ad outrag
and insult to her torment prai that he might also die by the hand
of fanat and in a wors fashion if my memori doe not plai me fals
i have said that thi inde came to pass and veri strang for after
the conquest of anahuac by cort among other thi same fieri priest
came from spain to turn the indian to the love of god by torment and by
sword inde of all of those who enter on thi mission of peac he
wa the most zealou the indian paba wrought cruelti enough when
tear out the victim heart thei offer it like incens to huitzel
or to quetzal but thei at least dismiss hi soul to the mansion of
the sun with the christian priest the thumbscrew and the stake took
the place of the stone of sacrific but the soul which thei deliv
from it earthli bondag thei consign to the hous of hell
of these priest a certain father pedro wa the boldest and the most
cruel to and fro he pass mark hi path with the corps of
idolat until he earn the name of the christian devil at length
he ventur too far in hi holi fervour and wa seiz by a clan of the
otomi that had broken from our rule upon thi veri question of human
sacrific but which wa not yet subjug by the spaniard on dai
it wa when we had rule for some fourteen year in the citi of pine
it came to my knowledg that the paba of thi clan had captur a
christian priest and design to offer him to the god tezcat
attend by a small guard onli i pass rapidli across the mountain
purpos to visit the caciqu of thi clan with whom although he had
cast off hi allegi to us i still kept up a show of friendship
and if i could to persuad him to releas the priest but swiftli as i
travel the vengeanc of the paba had been more swift and i arriv
at the villag onli to find the christian devil in the act of be
led to sacrific befor the imag of a hideou idol that wa set upon a
stake and surround with pile of skull nake to the waist hi hand
bound behind him hi grizzl lock hang about hi breast hi keen
ey fix upon the face of hi heathen foe in menac rather than in
supplic hi thin lip mutter prayer father pedro pass on to
the place of hi doom now and again shake hi head fierc to free
himself from the torment of the insect which buzz about it
i look upon him and wonder i look again and knew suddenli there
rose befor my mind a vision of that gloomi vault in sevil of a
woman young and love drape in cerement and of a thinfac
blackrob friar who smote her upon the lip with hi ivori crucifix
and curs her for a blasphem heret there befor me wa the man
isabella de siguenza had prai that a fate like to her own fate should
befal him and it wa upon him now nor inde rememb all that
had been wa i mind to avert it even if it had been in my power to
do so i stood by and let the victim pass but as he pass i spoke to
him in spanish sai
rememb that which it mai well be you have forgotten holi father
rememb now the dy prayer of isabella de siguenza whom mani year
ago you did to death in sevil
the man heard me he turn livid beneath hi bronz skin and stagger
until i thought that he would have fallen he stare upon me with
terror in hi ey to see as he believ a common sight enough that of
an indian chief rejoic at the death of on of hi oppressor
what devil ar you he said hoars sent from hell to torment me at
the last
rememb the dy prayer of isabella de siguenza whom you struck and
curs i answer mock seek not to know whenc i am but rememb
thi onli now and for ever
for a moment he stood still heedless of the urg of hi tormentor
then hi courag came to him again and he cri with a great voic
get thee behind me satan what have i to fear from thee i rememb
that dead sinner wellmai her soul have peaceand her curs ha fallen
upon me i rejoic that it should be so for on the further side of
yonder stone the gate of heaven open to my sight get thee behind me
satan what have i to fear from thee
cry thu he stagger forward sai o god into thy hand i commend
my spirit mai hi soul have peac also for if he wa cruel at least
he wa brave and did not shrink beneath those torment which he had
inflict on mani other
now thi wa a littl matter but it result were larg had i save
father pedro from the hand of the paba of the otomi it is like
enough that i should not todai be write thi histori here in the
vallei of the wavenei i do not know if i could have save him i onli
know that i did not try and that becaus of hi death great sorrow
came upon me whether i wa right or wrong who can sai those who judg
my stori mai think that in thi as in other matter i wa wrong had
thei seen isabella de siguenza die within her live tomb certainli
thei would hold that i wa right but for good or ill matter came
about as i have written
and it came about also that the new viceroi sent from spain wa stir
to anger at the murder of the friar by the rebelli and heathen peopl
of the otomi and set himself to take vengeanc on the tribe that
wrought the deed
soon tide reach me that a great forc of tlascalan and other
indian were be collect to put an end to us root and branch and
that with them march more than a hundr spaniard the expedit
be under the command of none other than the captain bernal diaz that
same soldier whom i had spare in the slaughter of the noch trist and
whose sword to thi dai hung at my side
now we must need prepar our defenc for our onli hope lai in
bold onc befor the spaniard had attack us with thousand of
their alli and of their number but few had live to look again on the
camp of cort what had been done could be done a second timeso said
otomi in the pride of her unconquer heart but ala in fourteen
year thing had chang much with us fourteen year ago we held swai
over a great district of mountain whose rude clan would send up their
warrior in hundr at our call now these clan had broken from our
yoke which wa acknowledg by the peopl of the citi of pine alon
and those of some adjac villag when the spaniard came down on me
the first time i wa abl to muster an armi of ten thousand soldier to
oppos them now with much toil i could collect no more than between two
and three thousand men and of these some slip awai as the hour of
danger drew nigh
still i must put a bold face on my necess and make what plai i
might with such forc as lai at my command although in my heart i
fear much for the issu but of my fear i said noth to otomi and
if she felt ani she on her part buri them in her breast in truth i
do believ her faith in me wa so great that she thought my singl wit
enough to overmatch all the armi of the spaniard
now at length the enemi drew near and i set my battl as i had done
fourteen year befor advanc down the pass by which alon thei
could approach us with a small portion of my forc and station the
remaind in two equal compani upon either brow of the beetl cliff
that overhung the road have command to overwhelm the spaniard with
rock hurl upon them from abov so soon as i should give the signal
by fly befor them down the pass other measur i took also for
see that do what i would it well might happen that we should be
driven back upon the citi i caus it wall and gate to be set in
order and garrison them as a last resourc too i store the lofti
summit of the teocal which now that sacrific were no longer offer
there wa us as an arsen for the materi of war with water and
provis and fortifi it side by wall stud with volcan
glass and by other devic till it seem well nigh imposs that ani
should be abl to forc them while a score of men still live to offer a
defenc
it wa on on night in the earli summer have bid farewel to otomi
and take my son with me for he wa now of an ag when accord to
the indian custom lad ar brought face to face with the danger of
battl that i despatch the appoint compani to their station on
the brow of the precipic and salli into the darksom mouth of the
pass with the few hundr men who were left to me i knew by my spi
that the spaniard who were encamp on the further side would attempt
it passag an hour befor the daylight trust to find me asleep
and sure enough on the follow morn so earli that the first rai
of the sun had not yet stain the lofti snow of the volcan xaca that
tower behind us a distant murmur which echo through the silenc
of the night told me that the enemi had begun hi march i move down
the pass to meet him easili enough there wa no stone in it that wa
not known to me and my men but with the spaniard it wa otherwis
for mani of them were mount and moreov thei drag with them
two carronad time upon time these heavi gun remain fast in the
boulderstrewn roadwai for in the dark the slave who drew them
could find no place for the wheel to run on till in the end
the captain of the armi unwil to risk a fight at so great a
disadvantag order them to halt until the dai broke
at length the dawn came and the light fell dimli down the depth of
the vast gulf reveal the long rank of the spaniard clad in their
bright armour and the yet more brilliant thousand of their nativ
alli gorgeou in their paint helm and their glitter coat of
feather thei saw us also and mock at our poor arrai their column
twist forward like some huge snake in the crack of a rock till thei
came to within a hundr pace of us then the spaniard rais their
battl cry of saint peter and lanc at rest thei charg us with their
hors we met them with a rain of arrow that check them a littl but
not for long soon thei were among us drive us back at the point of
their lanc and slai mani for our indian weapon could work
littl harm to men and hors clad in armour therefor we must fly and
inde flight wa my plan for by it i hope to lead the foe to that
part of the defil where the road wa narrow and the cliff sheer
and thei might be crush by the stone which should hail on them from
abov all went well we fled the spaniard follow flush with
victori till thei were fairli in the trap now a singl boulder
came rush from on high and fall on a hors kill him then
rebound carri dismai and wound to those behind anoth follow
and yet anoth and i grew glad at heart for it seem to me that the
danger wa over and that for the second time my strategi had succeed
but suddenli from abov there came a sound other than that of the
rush rock the sound of men join in battl that grew and grew
till the air wa full of it tumult then someth whirl down from on
high i look it wa no stone but a man on of my own men inde he
wa but as the first raindrop of a shower
ala i saw the truth i had been outwit the spaniard old in war
could not be caught twice by such a trick thei advanc down the pass
with the carronad inde becaus thei must but first thei sent great
bodi of men to climb the mountain under shelter of the night by
secret path which had been discov to them and there on it summit
to deal with those who would stai their passag by hurl rock upon
them and in truth thei dealt with them but too well for my men of the
otomi ly on the verg of the cliff among the scrub of alo and
other prickli plant that grew there watch the advanc of the foe
beneath and never for on moment dream that foe might be upon their
flank were utterli surpris scarc had thei time to seiz their
weapon which were laid at their side that thei might have the greater
freedom in the roll of heavi mass of rock when the enemi who
outnumb them by far were upon them with a yell then came a fight
short but decis
too late i saw it all and curs the folli that had not provid
against such chanc for inde i never thought it possibl that the
forc of the spaniard could find the secret trail upon the further
side of the mountain forget that treason make most thing
possibl
chapter xxxiv
the sieg of the citi of pine
the battl wa alreadi lost from a thousand feet abov us swell the
shout of victori the battl wa lost and yet i must fight on as
swiftli as i could i withdrew those who were left to me to a certain
angl in the path where a score of desper men might for a while
hold back the advanc of an armi here i call for some to stand at
my side and mani answer to my call out of them i chose fifti men
or more bid the rest run hard for the citi of pine there to warn
those who were left in garrison that the hour of danger wa upon
them and should i fall to conjur otomi my wife to make the best
resist in her power till if it were possibl she could wring
from the spaniard a promis of safeti for herself her child and her
peopl meanwhil i would hold the pass so that time might be given to
shut the gate and man the wall with the main bodi of those who were
left to me i sent back my son though he prai hard to be allow to
stai with me but see noth befor me except death i refus him
present all were gone and fear a snare the spaniard came slowli
and cautious round the angl of the rock and see so few men
muster to meet them halt for now thei were certain that we had set
a trap for them sinc thei did not think it possibl that such a littl
band would ventur to oppos their arrai here the ground lai so that
onli a few of them could come against us at on time nor could thei
bring their heavi piec to bear on us and even their arquebuss
help them but littl also the rough of the road forc them to
dismount from their hors so that if thei would attack at all it
must be on foot thi in the end thei chose to do mani fell upon either
side though i myself receiv no wound but in the end thei drove us
back inch by inch thei drove us back or rather those who were left
of us at the point of their long lanc till at length thei forc us
into the mouth of the pass that is some five furlong distant from what
wa onc the wall of the citi of pine
to fight further wa of no avail here we must choos between death and
flight and as mai be guess for wive and children sake if not for
our own we chose to fly across the plain we fled like deer and after
us came the spaniard and their alli like hound happili the ground
wa rough with stone so that their hors could not gallop freeli and
thu it happen that some of us perhap twenti gain the gate in
safeti of my armi not more than five hundr in all live to enter them
again and perchanc there were as mani left within the citi
the heavi gate swung to and scarc were thei bar with the massiv
beam of oak when the foremost of the spaniard rode up to them my bow
wa still in my hand and there wa on arrow left in my quiver i set it
on the string and draw the bow with my full strength i loos
the shaft through the bar of the gate at a young and gallant look
cavali who rode the first of all it struck him truli between the
joint of hi helm and neck piec and stretch hi arm out wide he
fell backward over the crupper of hi hors to move no more then thei
withdrew but present on of their number came forward bear a
flag of truce he wa a knightli look man clad in rich armour and
watch him it seem to me that there wa someth in hi bear
and in the careless grace with which he sat hi hors that wa familiar
to me rein up in front of the gate he rais hi visor and began to
speak
i knew him at onc befor me wa de garcia my ancient enemi of whom i
had neither heard nor seen anyth for hard upon twelv year time had
touch him inde which wa scarc to be wonder at for now he wa
a man of sixti or more hi peak chestnutcolour beard wa streak
with grei hi cheek were hollow and at that distanc hi lip seem
like two thin red line but the ey were as thei had alwai been
bright and pierc and the same cold smile plai about hi mouth
without a doubt it wa de garcia who now as at everi crisi of my
life appear to shape my fortun to some evil end and i felt as i
look upon him that the last and greatest struggl between us wa at
hand and that befor mani dai were sped the ancient and accumul
hate of on or of both of us would be buri for ever in the silenc of
death how ill had fate dealt with me now as alwai but a few minut
befor when i set that arrow on the string i had waver for a moment
doubt whether to loos it at the young cavali who lai dead or at
the knight who rode next to him and see i had slain on with whom i
had no quarrel and left my enemi unharm
ho there cri de garcia in spanish i desir to speak with the
leader of the rebel otomi on behalf of the captain bernal diaz who

as he mai select there to learn the us art of husbandri and
mine these ar the condit of surrend and i am command to
sai that an hour is given you in which to decid whether you accept or
reject them
and if we reject them
then the captain bernal diaz ha order to sack and destroi thi citi
and have given it over for twelv hour to the merci of the tlascalan
and other faith indian alli to collect those who mai be left
live within it and bring them to the citi of mexico there to be sold
as slave
good i said you shall have your answer in an hour now leav
the gate guard i hurri to the palac send messeng as i went
to summon such of the council of the citi as remain aliv at the door
of the palac i met otomi who greet me fondli for after hear of
our disast she had hardli look to see me again
come with me to the hall of assembl i said there i will speak to
you
we went to the hall where the member of the council were alreadi
gather so soon as the most of them were assembl there were but
eight in all i repeat to them the word of de garcia without comment
then otomi spoke as be the first in rank she had a right to do
twice befor i had heard her address the peopl of the otomi upon these
question of defenc against the spaniard the first time it mai be
rememb wa when we came as envoi from cuitlahua montezuma her
father successor to prai the aid of the children of the mountain
against cort and the teul the second time wa when some fourteen
year ago we had return to the citi of pine as fugit after the
fall of tenoctitlan and the populac move to furi by the destruct
of nearli twenti thousand of their soldier would have deliv us as
a peac offer into the hand of the spaniard
on each of these occas otomi had triumph by her eloqu by the
great of her name and the majesti of her presenc now thing were
far otherwis and even had she not scorn to us them such art would
have avail us noth in thi extrem now her great name wa but
a shadow on of mani wane shadow cast by an empir whose glori
had gone for ever now she us no passion appeal to the pride and
tradit of a doom race now she wa no longer young and the first
splendour of her womanhood had depart from her and yet as with her
son and mine at her side she rose to address those seven councillor
who haggard with fear and hopeless in the grasp of fate crouch in
silenc befor her their face buri in their hand i thought that
otomi had never seem more beauti and that her word simpl as
thei were had never been more eloqu
friend she said you know the disast that ha overtaken us my
husband ha given you the messag of the teul our case is desper
we have but a thousand men at most to defend thi citi the home of our
forefath and we alon of all the peopl of anahuac still dare to
stand in arm against the white men year ago i said to you choos
between death with honour and life with shame todai again i sai to
you choos for me and mine there is no choic left sinc whatev you
decid death must be our portion but with you it is otherwis will
you die fight or will you and your children serv your remain
year as slave
for a while the seven consult togeth then their spokesman answer
otomi and you teul we have follow your counsel for mani year
and thei have brought us but littl luck we do not blame you for the
god of anahuac have desert us as we have desert them and the god
alon stand between men and their evil destini whatev misfortun we
mai have born you have share in them and so it is now at the end
nor will we go back upon our word in thi the last hour of the peopl
of the otomi we have chosen we have live free with you and still
free we will die with you for like you we hold that it is better for
us and our to perish as free men than to drag out our dai beneath the
yoke of the teul
it is well said otomi now noth remain for us except to seek a
death so gloriou that it shall be sung of in after dai husband you
have heard the answer of the council let the spaniard hear it also
so i went back to the wall a white flag in my hand and present an
envoi advanc from the spanish camp to speak with menot de garcia
but anoth i told him in few word that those who remain aliv of
the peopl of the otomi would die beneath the ruin of their citi like
the children of tenoctitlan befor them but that while thei had a spear
to throw and an arm to throw it thei would never yield to the tender
merci of the spaniard
the envoi return to the camp and within an hour the attack began
bring up their piec of ordnanc the spaniard set them within
littl more than an hundr pace of the gate and began to batter
us with iron shot at their leisur for our spear and arrow could
scarc harm them at such a distanc still we were not idl for
see that the wooden gate must soon be down we demolish hous on
either side of them and fill up the roadwai with stone and rubbish
at the rear of the heap thu form i caus a great trench to be dug
which could not be pass by horsemen and ordnanc till it wa fill
in again all along the main street lead to the great squar of the
teocal i threw up other barricad protect in the front and rear by
dyke cut through the roadwai and in case the spaniard should try to
turn our flank and forc a passag through the narrow and tortuou lane
to the right and left i also barricad the four entranc to the great
squar or market place
till nightfal the spaniard bombard the shatter remain of the
gate and the earthwork behind them do no great damag beyond the
kill of about a score of peopl by cannon shot and arquebuss ball
but thei attempt no assault that dai at length the dark fell and
their fire ceas but not so our labour most of the men must guard
the gate and the weak spot in the wall and therefor the build of
the barricad wa left chiefli to the women work under my command
and that of my captain otomi herself took a share in the toil an
exampl that wa follow by everi ladi and inde by everi woman in
the citi and there were mani of them for the women outnumb the men
among the otomi and moreov not a few of them had been made widow on
that same dai
it wa a strang sight to see them in the glare of hundr of torch
split from the resin pine that gave it name to the citi as all night
long thei move to and fro in line each of them stagger beneath the
weight of a basket of earth or a heavi stone or dug with wooden spade
at the hard soil or labour at the pull down of hous thei never
complain but work on sullenli and despairingli no groan or tear
broke from them no not even from those whose husband and son had
been hurl that morn from the precipic of the pass thei knew that
resist would be useless and that their doom wa at hand but no cry
aros among them of surrend to the spaniard those of them who spoke
of the matter at all said with otomi that it wa better to die free
than to live as slave but the most did not speak the old and the
young mother wife widow and maid thei labour in silenc and the
children labour at their side
look at them it came into my mind that these silent patient women
were inspir by some common and desper purpos that all knew of
but which none of them chose to tell
will you work so hard for your master the teul cri a man in
bitter mockeri as a file of them toil past beneath their load of
stone
fool answer their leader a young and love ladi of rank do the
dead labour
nai said thi ill jester but such as you ar too fair for the
teul to kill and your year of slaveri will be mani sai how shall
you escap them
fool answer the ladi again doe fire die from lack of fuel onli
and must everi man live till ag take him we shall escap them thu
and cast down the torch she carri she trod it into the earth with
her sandal and went on with her load then i wa sure that thei had
some purpos though i did not guess how desper it wa and otomi
would tell me noth of thi woman secret
otomi i said to her that night when we met by chanc i have ill
new for you
it must be bad inde husband to be so name in such an hour she
answer
de garcia is among our foe
i knew it husband
how did you know it
by the hate written in your ey she answer
it seem that hi hour of triumph is at hand i said
nai belov not hi but your you shall triumph over de garcia but
victori will cost you dear i know it in my heart ask me not how or
why see the queen put on her crown and she point to the volcan
xaca whose snow grew rosi with the dawn and you must go to the gate
for the spaniard will soon be stir
as otomi spoke i heard a trumpet blare without the wall hurri to
the gate by the first light of dai i could see that the spaniard were
muster their forc for attack thei did not come at onc howev
but delai till the sun wa well up then thei began to pour a furiou
fire upon our defenc that reduc the shatter beam of the gate
to powder and even shook down the crest of the earthwork beyond them
suddenli the fire ceas and again a trumpet call now thei charg
us in column a thousand or more tlascalan lead the van follow by
the spanish forc in two minut i who await them beyond it togeth
with some three hundr warrior of the otomi saw their head appear
over the crest of the earthwork and the fight began thrice we drove
them back with our spear and arrow but at the fourth charg the wave
of men swept over our defenc and pour into the dry ditch beyond
now we were forc to fly to the next earthwork for we could not hope
to fight so mani in the open street whither so soon as a passag had
been made for their hors and ordnanc the enemi follow us here the
fight wa renew and thi barricad be veri strong we held it
for hard upon two hour with much loss to ourselv and to the spanish
forc again we retreat and again we were assail and so the
struggl went on throughout the livelong dai everi hour our number
grew fewer and our arm fainter but still we fought on desper at
the two last barricad hundr of the women of the otomi fought by
the side of their husband and their brother
the last earthwork wa captur by the spaniard just as the sun sank
and under the shadow of approach dark those of us that remain
aliv fled to the refug which we had prepar upon the teocal nor
wa there ani further fight dure that night
chapter xxxv
the last sacrific of the women of the otomi
here in the courtyard of the teocal by the light of burn hous
for as thei advanc the spaniard fire the town we muster our arrai
to find that there were left to us in all some four hundr fight
men togeth with a crowd of nearli two thousand women and mani
children now although thi teocal wa not quit so lofti as that of
the great templ of mexico it side were steeper and everywher face
with dress stone and the open space upon it summit wa almost as
great measur inde more than a hundr pace everi wai thi area
wa pave with block of marbl and in it centr stood the templ of
the wargod where hi statu still sat although no worship had been
offer to him for mani year the stone of sacrific the altar of
fire and the storehous of the priest moreov in front of the
templ and between it and the stone of sacrific wa a deep cement
hole the size of a larg room which onc had been us as a place for
the safe keep of grain in time of famin thi pit i had caus to
be fill with water born with great toil to the top of the pyramid
and in the templ itself i store a great quantiti of food so that we
had no caus to fear present death from thirst or famin
but now we were face to face with a new troubl larg as wa the summit
of the pyramid it would not give shelter to a half of our number and
if we desir to defend it some of the multitud herd round it base
must seek refug elsewher call the leader of the peopl togeth
i put the matter befor them in few word leav them to decid what
must be done thei in turn consult among themselv and at length
gave me thi answer that it wa agre that all the wound and ag
there togeth with most of the children and with them ani other who
wish to go should leav the teocal that night to find their wai
out of the citi if thei could or if not to trust to the merci of the
spaniard
i said that it wa well for death wa on everi side and it matter
littl which wai men turn to meet it so thei were sort out fifteen
hundr or more of them and at midnight the gate of the courtyard were
thrown open and thei left oh it wa dread to see the farewel
that took place in that hour here a daughter clung to the neck of her
ag father here husband and wive bade each other a last farewel
here mother kiss their littl children and on everi side rose up the
sound of bitter agoni the agoni of those who part for ever i buri
my face in my hand wonder as i had often wonder befor how a god
whose name is merci can bear to look upon sight that break the heart
of sin men to wit
present i rais my ey and spoke to otomi who wa at my side
ask her if she would not send our son awai with the other pass
him off as the child of common peopl
nai husband she answer it is better for him to die with us than
to live as a slave of the spaniard
at length it wa over and the gate had shut behind the last of them
soon we heard the distant challeng of the spanish sentri as thei
perceiv them and the sound of some shot follow by cri
doubtless the tlascalan ar massacr them i said but it wa not
so when a few had been kill the leader of the spaniard found that
thei wage war upon an unarm mob made up for the most part of ag
peopl women and children and their command bernal diaz a merci
man if a rough on order that the onslaught should ceas inde he
did more for when all the ablebodi men togeth with such children
as were suffici strong to bear the fatigu of travel had been
sort out to be sold as slave he suffer the rest of that melancholi
compani to depart whither thei would and so thei went though what
becam of them i do not know
that night we spent in the courtyard of the teocal but befor it wa
light i caus the women and children who remain with us perhap some
six hundr in all for veri few of the former who were unmarri or
who be marri were still young and come had chosen to desert our
refug to ascend the pyramid guess that the spaniard would attack
us at dawn i stai howev with the three hundr fight men that
were left to me a hundr or more have thrown themselv upon the
merci of the spaniard with the refuge to await the spanish onset
under shelter of the wall of the courtyard at dawn it began and by
middai do what we could to stai it the wall wa storm and leav
nearli a hundr dead and wound behind me i wa driven to the wind
wai that led to the summit of the pyramid here thei assault us again
but the road wa steep and narrow and their number gave them no great
advantag on it so that the end of it wa that we beat them back with
loss and there wa no more fight that dai
the night which follow we spent upon the summit of the pyramid and
for my part i wa so weari that after i had eaten i never slept more
soundli next morn the struggl began anew and thi time with better
success to the spaniard inch by inch under cover of the heavi fire
from their arquebuss and piec thei forc us upward and backward
all dai long the fight continu upon the narrow road that wound from
stage to stage of the pyramid at length as the sun sank a compani of
our foe their advanc guard with shout of victori emerg upon the
flat summit and rush toward the templ in it centr all thi while
the women had been watch but now on of them sprang up cry with
a loud voic
seiz them thei ar but few
then with a fear scream of rage the mob of women cast themselv
upon the weari spaniard and tlascalan bear them down by the weight
of their number mani of them were slain inde but in the end the
women conquer ay and made their victim captiv fasten them
with cord to the ring of copper that were let into the stone of the
pavement to which in former dai those doom to sacrific had been
secur when their number were so great that the priest fear
lest thei should escap i and the soldier with me watch thi sight
wonder then i cri out
what men of the otomi shall it be said that our women outdid us in
courag and without further ado follow by a hundr or more of my
companion i rush desper down the steep and narrow path
at the first corner we met the main arrai of spaniard and their alli
come up slowli for now thei were sure of victori and so great wa
the shock of our encount that mani of them were hurl over the edg
of the path to roll down the steep side of the pyramid see the
fate of their comrad those behind them halt then began to retreat
present the weight of our rush struck them also and thei in turn
push upon those below till at length panic seiz them and with a
great cry the long line of men that wound round and round the pyramid
from it base almost to it summit sought their safeti in flight but
some of them found none for the rush of those abov press with ever
increas forc upon their friend below drove mani to their death
sinc here on the pyramid there wa noth to cling to and if onc
a man lost hi foothold on the path hi fall wa broken onli when hi
bodi reach the court beneath thu in fifteen short minut all that
the spaniard had won thi dai wa lost again for except the prison
at it summit none of them remain aliv upon the teocal inde so
great a terror took them that bear with them their dead and wound
thei retreat under cover of the night to their camp without the wall
of the courtyard
now weari but triumphant we wend back toward the crest of the
pyramid but as i turn the corner of the second angl that wa perhap
nearli on hundr feet abov the level of the ground a thought struck
me and i set those with me at a task loosen the block of stone that
form the edg of the roadwai we roll them down the side of the
pyramid and so labour on remov layer upon layer of stone and
of the earth beneath till where the path had been wa noth but a
yawn gap thirti feet or more in width
now i said survei our handiwork by the light of the rise moon
that spaniard who would win our nest must find wing to fly with
ay teul answer on at my side but sai what wing shall we
find
the wing of death i said grimli and went on my upward wai
it wa near midnight when i reach the templ for the labour of
level the road took mani hour and food had been sent to us from
abov as i drew nigh i wa amaz to hear the sound of solemn chant
and still more wa i amaz when i saw that the door of the templ of
huitzel were open and that the sacr fire which had not shone there
for mani year onc more flare fierc upon hi altar i stood still
listen did my ear trick me or did i hear the dread song of
sacrific nai again it wild refrain rang out upon the silenc
to thee we sacrific save us o huitzel huitzel lord god
i rush forward and turn the angl of the templ i found myself
face to face with the past for there as in bygon year were the
paba clad in their black robe their long hair hang about their
shoulder the dread knife of glass fix in their girdl there to
the right of the stone of sacrific were those destin to the god and
there be led toward it wa the first victim a tlascalan prison
hi limb held by men clad in the dress of priest near him arrai
in the scarlet robe of sacrific stood on of my own captain who i
rememb had onc serv as a priest of tezcat befor idolatri wa
forbidden in the citi of pine and around were a wide circl of women
that watch and from whose lip swell the aw chant
now i understood it all in their last despair madden by the loss of
father husband and children by their cruel fate and stand face
to face with certain death the fire of the old faith had burnt up in
their savag heart there wa the templ there were the stone and
implement of sacrific and there to their hand were the victim taken
in war thei would glut a last reveng thei would sacrific to their
father god as their father had done befor them and the victim
should be taken from their own victori foe ay thei must die but
at the least thei would seek the mansion of the sun made holi by the
blood of the accurs teul
i have said that it wa the women who sang thi chant and glare so
fierc upon the victim but i have not yet told all the horror of
what i saw for in the forefront of their circl clad in white robe
the necklet of great emerald guatemoc gift flash upon her
breast the plume of royal green set in her hair give the time of
the death chant with a littl wand stood montezuma daughter otomi
my wife never had i seen her look so beauti or so dread it wa
not otomi whom i saw for where wa the tender smile and where the
gentl ey here befor me wa a live vengeanc wear the shape of
woman in an instant i guess the truth though i did not know it all
otomi who although she wa not of it had ever favour the christian
faith otomi who for year had never spoken of these dread rite
except with anger whose everi act wa love and whose everi word wa
kind wa still in her soul an idolat and a savag she had hidden
thi side of her heart from me well through all these year perchanc
she herself had scarc known it secret for but twice had i seen
anyth of the buri fierc of her blood the first time wa when
marina had brought her a certain robe in which she might escap from
the camp of cort and she had spoken to marina of that robe and the
second when on thi same dai she had plai her part to the tlascalan
and had struck him down with her own hand as he bent over me
all thi and much more pass through my mind in that brief moment
while otomi mark the time of the death chant and the paba drag
the tlascalan to hi doom
the next i wa at her side
what pass here i ask sternli
otomi look on me with a cold wonder and empti ey as though she did
not know me
go back white man she answer it is not law for stranger to
mingl in our rite
i stood bewild not know what to do while the flame burn and
the chant went up befor the effigi of huitzel of the demon huitzel
awaken after mani year of sleep
again and yet again the solemn chant aros otomi beat time with her
littl rod of eboni and again and yet again the cry of triumph rose to
the silent star
now i awok from my dream for as an evil dream it seem to me and
draw my sword i rush toward the priest at the altar to cut him
down but though the men stood still the women were too quick for me
befor i could lift the sword befor i could even speak a word thei
had sprung upon me like the jaguar of their own forest and like
jaguar thei hiss and growl into my ear
get you gone teul thei said lest we stretch you on the stone with
your brethren and still hiss thei push me thenc
i drew back and thought for a while in the shadow of the templ my ey
fell upon the long line of victim await their turn of sacrific
there were thirti and on of them still aliv and of these five were
spaniard i note that the spaniard were chain the last of all the
line it seem that the murder would keep them till the end of the
feast inde i discov that thei were to be offer up at the rise
of the sun how could i save them i wonder my power wa gone the
women could not be move from their work of vengeanc thei were mad
with their suffer as well might a man try to snatch her prei from a
puma rob of her whelp as to turn them from their purpos with the
men it wa otherwis howev some of them mingl in the orgi inde
but more stood aloof watch with a fear joi the spectacl in
which thei did not share near me wa a man a nobl of the otomi of
someth more than my own ag he had alwai been my friend and after
me he command the warrior of the tribe i went to him and said
friend for the sake of the honour of your peopl help me to end
thi
i cannot teul he answer and bewar how you meddl in the plai
for none will stand by you now the women have power and you see thei
us it thei ar about to die but befor thei die thei will do as their
father did for their strait is sore and though thei have been put
asid the old custom ar not forgotten
at the least can we not save these teul i answer
why should you wish to save the teul will thei save us some few dai
henc when we ar in their power
perhap not i said but if we must die let us die clean from thi
shame
what then do you wish me to do teul
thi i would have you find some three or four men who ar not fallen
into thi mad and with them aid me to loos the teul for we
cannot save the other if thi mai be done sure we can lower them
with rope from that point where the road is broken awai down to the
path beneath and thu thei mai escap to their own peopl
i will try he answer shrug hi shoulder not from ani
tender toward the accurs teul whom i could well bear to see
stretch upon the stone but becaus it is your wish and for the sake
of the friendship between us
then he went and present i saw sever men place themselv as
though by chanc between the spot where the last of the line of indian
prison and the first of the spaniard were made fast in such a
fashion as to hide them from the sight of the madden women engross
as thei were in their orgi
now i crept up to the spaniard thei were squat upon the ground
bound by their hand and feet to the copper ring in the pavement there
thei sat silent await the dread doom their face grei with
terror and their ey start from their socket
hist i whisper in spanish into the ear of the first an old man
whom i knew as on who had taken part in the war of cort would you
be save
he look up quickli and said in a hoars voic
who ar you that talk of save us who can save us from these she
devil
i am teul a man of white blood and a christian and ala that i must
sai it the captain of thi savag peopl with the aid of some few men
who ar faith to me i purpos to cut your bond and afterward you
shall see know spaniard that i do thi at great risk for if we ar
caught it is a chanc but that i myself shall have to suffer those
thing from which i hope to rescu you
be assur teul answer the spaniard that if we should get safe
awai we shall not forget thi servic save our live now and the
time mai come when we shall pai you back with your but even if we ar
loos how can we cross the open space in thi moonlight and escap the
ey of those furi
we must trust to chanc for that i answer and as i spoke fortun
help us strang for by now the spaniard in their camp below had
perceiv what wa go forward on the crest of the teocal a yell of
horror rose from them and instantli thei open fire upon us with their
piec and arquebuss though becaus of the shape of the pyramid and
of their posit beneath it the storm of shot swept over us do
us littl or no hurt also a great compani of them pour across the
courtyard hope to storm the templ for thei did not know that the
road had been broken awai
now though the rite of sacrific never ceas what with the roar of
cannon the shout of rage and terror from the spaniard the hiss of
musket ball and the crackl of flame from hous which thei had
fire to give them more light and the sound of chant the turmoil
and confus grew so great as to render the carri out of my purpos
easier than i had hope by thi time my friend the captain of the
otomi wa at my side and with him sever men whom he could trust
stoop down with a few swift blow of a knife i cut the rope which
bound the spaniard then we gather ourselv into a knot twelv of
us or more and in the centr of the knot we set the five spaniard
thi done i drew my sword and cri
the teul storm the templ which wa true for alreadi their long
line wa rush up the wind path the teul storm the templ i go
to stop them and straightwai we sped across the open space
none saw us or if thei saw us none hinder us for all the compani
were intent upon the consumm of a fresh sacrific moreov the
tumult wa such as i afterward discov that we were scarc
notic two minut pass and our feet were set upon the wind wai
and now i breath again for we were beyond the sight of the women
on we rush swiftli as the cramp limb of the spaniard would carri
them till present we reach that angl in the path where the breach
began the attack spaniard had alreadi come to the further side of
the gap for though we could not see them we could hear their cri
of rage and despair as thei halt helplessli and understood that their
comrad were beyond their aid
now we ar sped said the spaniard with whom i had spoken the road
is gone and it must be certain death to try the side of the pyramid
not so i answer some fifti feet below the path still run and
on by on we will lower you to it with thi rope
then we set to work make the cord fast beneath the arm of a soldier
we let him down gentli till he came to the path and wa receiv there
by hi comrad as a man return from the dead the last to be lower
wa that spaniard with whom i had spoken
farewel he said and mai the bless of god be on you for thi act
of merci renegad though you ar sai now will you not come with me
i set my life and honour in pledg for your safeti you tell me that
you ar still a christian man is that a place for christian and he
point upward
no inde i answer but still i cannot come for my wife and son
ar there and i must return to die with them if need be if you bear me
ani gratitud strive in return to save their live sinc for my own i
care but littl
that i will he said and then we let him down among hi friend whom
he reach in safeti
now we return to the templ give it out that the spaniard were in
retreat have fail to cross the breach in the roadwai here befor
the templ the orgi still went on but two indian remain aliv and
the priest of sacrific grew weari
where ar the teul cri a voic swift strip them for the
altar
but the teul were gone nor search where thei would could thei find
them
their god ha taken them beneath hi wing i said speak from the
shadow and in a feign voic huitzel cannot prevail befor the god of
the teul
then i slip asid so that none knew that it wa i who had spoken
but the cry wa caught up and echo far and wide
the god of the christian ha hidden them beneath hi wing let us make
merri with those whom he reject said the cry and the last of the
captiv were drag awai
now i thought that all wa finish but thi wa not so i have spoken
of the secret purpos which i read in the sullen ey of the indian
women as thei labour at the barricad and i wa about to see it
execut mad still burn in the heart of these women thei had
accomplish their sacrific but their festiv wa still to come thei
drew themselv awai to the further side of the pyramid and heedless
of the shot which now and again pierc the breast of on of themfor
here thei were expos to the spanish fireremain a while in
prepar with them went the priest of sacrific but now as
befor the rest of the men stood in sullen group watch what
befel but lift no hand or voic to hinder it hellish
on woman did not go with them and that woman wa otomi my wife
she stood by the stone of sacrific a piteou sight to see for her
frenzi or rather her mad had outworn itself and she wa as she had
ever been there stood otomi gaze with wide and horrorstricken
ey now at the token of thi unholi rite and now at her own handsa
though she thought to see them red and shudder at the thought i
drew near to her and touch her on the shoulder she turn swiftli
gasp
husband husband
it is i i answer but call me husband no more
oh what have i done she wail and fell senseless in my arm
and here i will add what at the time i knew noth of for it wa told
me in after year by the rector of thi parish a veri learn man
though on of narrow mind had i known it inde i should have spoken
more kindli to otomi my wife even in that hour and thought more gentli
of her wicked it seem so said my friend the rector that from the
most ancient time those women who have bent the knee to demon god
such as were the god of anahuac ar subject at ani time to becom
possess by them even after thei have abandon their worship and to
be driven in their frenzi to the work of the greatest crime thu
among other instanc he told me that a greek poet name theocritu
set out in on of hi idyl how a woman call agav be engag in
a secret religi orgi in honour of a demon name dionysu perceiv
her own son pentheu watch the celebr of the mysteri and
thereon becom possess by the demon she fell on him and murder
him be aid by the other women for thi the poet who wa also a
worshipp of dionysu gave her great honour and not reproach see
that she did the deed at the behest of thi god a deed not to be
blame
now i write of thi for a reason though it ha noth to do with me
for it seem that as dionysu possess agav drive her to unnatur
murder so did huitzel possess otomi and inde she said as much to me
afterward for i am sure that if the devil whom the greek worship
had such power a still greater strength wa given to those of anahuac
who among all fiend were the first if thi be so as i believ it wa
not otomi that i saw at the rite of sacrific but rather the demon
huitzel whom she had onc worship and who had power therefor to
enter into her bodi for awhil in place of her own spirit
chapter xxxvi
the surrend
take otomi in my arm i bore her to on of the storehous attach
to the templ here mani children had been place for safeti among them
my own son
what ail our mother father said the boi and why did she shut
me in here with these children when it seem that there is fight
without
your mother ha faint i answer and doubtless she place you
here to keep you safe now do you tend her till i return
i will do so answer the boi but sure it would be better that i
who am almost a man should be without fight the spaniard at your
side rather than within nurs sick women
do as i bid you son i said and i charg you not to leav thi
place until i come for you again
now i pass out of the storehous shut the door behind me a
minut later i wish that i had stai where i wa sinc on the
platform my ey were greet by a sight more dread than ani that
had gone befor for there advanc toward us were the women divid
into four great compani some of them bear infant in their arm
thei came sing and leap mani of them nake to the middl nor
wa thi all for in front of them ran the paba and such of the women
themselv as were person in author these leader male and femal
ran and leap and sang call upon the name of their demongod
and celebr the wicked of their forefath while after them
pour the howl troop of women
to and fro thei rush now make obeis to the statu of huitzel
now prostrat themselv befor hi hideou sister the goddess of
death who sat besid him adorn with her carven necklac of men
skull and hand now bow around the stone of sacrific and now
thrust their bare arm into the flame of the holi fire for an hour
or more thei celebr thi ghastli carniv of which even i vers
as i wa in the indian custom could not fulli understand the mean
and then as though some singl impuls had possess them thei
withdrew to the centr of the open space and form themselv into a
doubl circl within which stood the paba of a sudden thei burst into
a chant so wild and shrill that as i listen my blood curdl in my
vein
even now the burden of that chant with the vision of those who sang it
sometim haunt my sleep at night but i will not write it here let
him who read imagin all that is most cruel in the heart of man and
everi terror of the evillest dream ad to these some horrorridden
tale of murder ghost and inhuman vengeanc then if he can let him
shape the whole in word and as in a glass darkli perchanc he mai
mirror the spirit of that last ancient song of the women of the otomi
with it sob it cri of triumph and it death wail
ever as thei sang step by step thei drew backward and with them went
the leader of each compani their ey fix upon the statu of their
god now thei were but a segment of a circl for thei did not advanc
toward the templ backward and outward thei went with a slow and
solemn tramp there wa but on line of them now for those in the
second ring fill the gap in the first as it widen still thei drew
on till at length thei stood on the sheer edg of the platform then
the priest and the women leader took their place among them and for a
moment there wa silenc until at a signal on and all thei bent them
backward stand thu their long hair wave on the wind the light
of burn hous flare upon their breast and in their madden ey
thei burst into the cry of
save us huitzel receiv us lord god our home
thrice thei cri it each time more shrilli than befor then suddenli
thei were gone the women of the otomi were no more
with their own selfslaught thei had consumm the last celebr
of the rite of sacrific that ever shall be held in the citi of pine
the devil god were dead and their worshipp with them
a low murmur ran round the lip of the men who watch then on cri
and hi voic rang strang in the sudden silenc mai our wive
the women of the otomi rest softli in the hous of the sun for of a
sureti thei teach us how to die
ay i answer but not thu let women do selfmurd our foe have
sword for the heart of men
i turn to go and befor me stood otomi
what ha befallen she said where ar my sister oh sure i have
dream an evil dream i dream that the god of my forefath were
strong onc more and that onc more thei drank the blood of men
your ill dream ha a wors awaken otomi i answer the god of
hell ar still strong inde in thi accurs land and thei have taken
your sister into their keep
is it so she said softli yet in my dream it seem to me that thi
wa their last strength er thei sink into death unend look yonder
and she point toward the snowi crest of the volcan xaca
i look but whether i saw the sight of which i am about to tell or
whether it wa but an imagin born of the horror of that most hideou
night in truth i cannot sai at the least i seem to see thi and
afterward there were some among the spaniard who swore that thei had
wit it also
on xaca lofti summit now as alwai stood a pillar of fieri smoke and
while i gaze to my vision the smoke and the fire separ themselv
out of the fire wa fashion a cross of flame that shone like
lightn and stretch for mani a rod across the heaven it base
rest on the mountain top at it foot roll the cloud of smoke and
now these too took form vast and terrifi such form inde as
those that sat in stone within the templ behind me but magnifi a
hundredfold
see said otomi again the cross of your god shine abov the shape
of mine the lost god whom tonight i worship though not of my own
will then she turn and went
for some few moment i stood veri much afraid gaze upon the vision
on xaca snow then suddenli the rai of the rise sun smote it and it
wa gone
now for three dai more we held out against the spaniard for thei
could not come at us and their shot swept over our head harmlessli
dure these dai i had no talk with otomi for we shrank from on
anoth hour by hour she would sit in the storehous of the templ a
veri pictur of desol twice i tri to speak with her my heart
be move to piti by the dumb torment in her ey but she turn her
head from me and made no answer
soon it came to the knowledg of the spaniard that we had enough food
and water upon the teocal to enabl us to live there for a month or
more and see that there wa no hope of captur the place by forc
of arm thei call a parlei with us
i went down to the breach in the roadwai and spoke with their envoi
who stood upon the path below at first the term offer were that we
should surrend at discret to thi i answer that sooner than do
so we would die where we were their repli wa that if we would give
over all who had ani part in the human sacrific the rest of us might
go free to thi i said that the sacrific had been carri out by women
and some few men and that all of these were dead by their own hand
thei ask if otomi wa also dead i told them no but that i would
never surrend unless thei swore that neither she nor her son should
be harm but rather that togeth with myself thei should be given a
safeconduct to go whither we will thi wa refus but in the end
i won the dai and a parchment wa thrown up to me on the point of a
lanc thi parchment which wa sign by the captain bernal diaz set
out that in consider of the part that i and some men of the otomi
had plai in rescu the spanish captiv from death by sacrific a
pardon wa grant to me my wife and child and all upon the teocal
with liberti to go whithersoev we would unharm our land and
wealth be howev declar forfeit to the viceroi
with these term i wa well content inde i had never hope to win ani
that would leav us our live and liberti
and yet for my part death had been almost as welcom for now otomi
had built a wall between us that i could never climb and i wa bound
to her to a woman who willingli or no had stain her hand with
sacrific well my son wa left to me and with him i must be satisfi
at the least he knew noth of hi mother shame oh i thought to
myself as i climb the teocal oh that i could but escap far from
thi accurs land and bear him with me to the english shore ay and
otomi also for there she might forget that onc she had been a savag
ala it could scarc be
come to the templ i and those with me told the good tide to our
companion who receiv it silent men of a white race would have
rejoic thu to escap for when death is near all other loss seem as
noth but with these indian peopl it is not so sinc when fortun
frown upon them thei do not cling to life these men of the otomi had
lost their countri their wive their wealth their brethren and their
home therefor life with freedom to wander whither thei would seem
no great thing to them so thei met the boon that i had won from the
merci of our foe as had matter gone otherwis thei would have met the
bane in sullen silenc
i came to otomi and to her also i told the new
i had hope to die here where i am she answer but so be it death
is alwai to be found
onli my son rejoic becaus he knew that god had save us all from
death by sword or hunger
father he said the spaniard have given us life but thei take our
countri and drive us out of it where then shall we go
i do not know my son i answer
father the lad said again let us leav thi land of anahuac where
there is noth but spaniard and sorrow let us find a ship and sail
across the sea to england our own countri
the boi spoke my veri thought and my heart leapt at hi word though i
had no plan to bring the matter about i ponder a moment look at
otomi
the thought is good teul she said answer my unspoken question
for you and for our son there is no better but for myself i will
answer in the proverb of my peopl the earth that bear us li
lightest on our bone
then she turn make readi to quit the storehous of the templ where
we had been lodg dure the sieg and no more wa said about the
matter
befor the sun set a weari throng of men with some few women and
children were march across the courtyard that surround the
pyramid for a bridg of timber taken from the templ had been made
over the breach in the roadwai that wound about it side
at the gate the spaniard were wait to receiv us some of them
curs us some mock but those of the nobler sort said noth for
thei piti our plight and respect us for the courag we had shown
in the last struggl their indian alli were there also and these
grin like unf puma snarl and whimper for our live till
their master kick them to silenc the last act of the fall of
anahuac wa as the first had been dog still at dog leav the goodli
spoil to the lion who watch
at the gate we were sort out the men of small condit togeth
with the children were taken from the ruin citi by an escort and
turn loos upon the mountain while those of note were brought to the
spanish camp to be question there befor thei were set free i with
my wife and son wa led to the palac our old home there to learn the
will of the captain diaz
it is but a littl wai to go and yet there wa someth to be seen
in the path for as we walk i look up and befor me stand
with fold arm and apart from all men wa de garcia i had scarc
thought of him for some dai so full had my mind been of other matter
but at the sight of hi evil face i rememb that while thi man
live sorrow and danger must be my bedfellow
he watch us pass take note of all then he call to me who walk
last
farewel cousin wingfield you have live through thi bout also and
won a free pardon you your woman and your brat togeth if the old
warhors who is set over us as a captain had listen to me you should

for a while friend i am awai to mexico to report these matter to the
viceroi who mai have a word to sai
i made no answer but ask of our conductor that same spaniard whom i
had save from the sacrific what the senor meant by hi word
thi teul that there ha been a quarrel between our comrad sarceda
and our captain the former would have grant you no term or fail
thi would have decoi you from your stronghold with fals promis
and then have put you to the sword as infidel with whom no oath is
bind but the captain would not have it so for he said that faith
must be kept even with the heathen and we whom you had save cri
shame on him and so word ran high and in the end the senor sarceda
who is third in command among us declar that he would be no parti to
thi peacemak but would be gone to mexico with hi servant there
to report to the viceroi then the captain diaz bade him begon to hell
if he wish and report to the devil sai that he had alwai believ
that he had escap thenc by mistak and thei part in wrath who
sinc the dai of noch trist never love each other much the end

chapter xxxvii
vengeanc
dure that meal bernal diaz spoke of our first meet on the causewai
and of how i had gone near to kill him in error think that he wa
sarceda and then he ask me what wa my quarrel with sarceda
in as few word as possibl i told him the stori of my life of all the
evil that de garcia or sarceda had work upon me and mine and of how
it wa through him that i wa in thi land that dai he listen amaz
holi mother he said at length i alwai knew him for a villain but
that if you do not lie friend wingfield he could be such a man as
thi i did not know now by my word had i heard thi tale an hour
ago sarceda should not have left thi camp till he had answer it or
clear himself by combat with you but i fear it is too late he wa to
leav for mexico at the rise of the moon to stir up mischief against
me becaus i grant you termsnot that i fear him there where hi
reput is small
i do not lie inde i answer much of thi tale i can prove if
need be and i tell you that i would give half the life that is left
to me to stand face to face in open fight with him again ever he ha
escap me and the score between us is long
now as i spoke thu it seem to me that a cold and dread air plai
upon my hand and brow and a warn sens of present evil crept into my
soul overcom me so that i could not stir or speak for a while
let us go and see if he ha gone said diaz present and summon
a guard he wa about to leav the chamber it wa at thi moment that
i chanc to look up and see a woman stand in the doorwai her hand
rest on the doorpost her head from which the long hair stream wa
thrown back and on her face wa a look of such anguish that at first
so much wa she chang i did not know her for otomi when i knew her
i knew all on thing onli could conjur up the terror and agoni that
shone in her deep ey
what ha chanc to our son i ask
dead dead she answer in a whisper that seem to pierc my marrow
i said noth for my heart told me what had happen but diaz ask
deadwhi what ha kill him
de garcia i saw him go repli otomi then she toss her arm
high and without anoth sound fell backward to the earth
in that moment i think that my heart brokeat least i know that noth
ha had the power to move me greatli sinc though thi memori move me
dai by dai and hour by hour till i die and go to seek my son
sai bernal diaz i cri with a hoars laugh did i lie to you
concern thi comrad of your
then spring over otomi bodi i left the chamber follow by
bernal diaz and the other
without the door i turn to the left toward the camp i had not gone
a hundr pace when in the moonlight i saw a small troop of horsemen
ride toward us it wa de garcia and hi servant and thei head
toward the mountain pass on their road to mexico i wa not too late
halt cri bernal diaz
who command me to halt said the voic of de garcia
i your captain roar diaz halt you devil you murder or you
shall be cut down
i saw him start and turn pale
these ar strang manner senor he said of your grace i ask
at thi moment de garcia caught sight of me for the first time for i
had broken from the hold of diaz who clutch my arm and wa move
toward him i said noth but there wa someth in my face which
told him that i knew all and warn him of hi doom he look past me
but the narrow road wa block with men i drew near but he did
not wait for me onc he put hi hand on the hilt of the sword then
suddenli he wheel hi hors round and fled down the street of xaca
de garcia fled and i follow after him run fast and low like a
hound at first he gain on me but soon the road grew rough and he
could not gallop over it we were clear of the town now or rather of
it ruin and travel along a littl path which the indian us
to bring down snow from xaca in the hot weather perhap there ar some
five mile of thi path befor the snow line is reach beyond which no
indian dare to set hi foot for the ground abov wa holi along thi
path he went and i wa content to see it for i knew well that the
travel cannot leav it sinc on either side lie watercours and
cliff mile after mile de garcia follow it look now to the left
now to the right and now ahead at the great dome of snow crown with
fire that tower abov him but he never look behind him he knew
what wa theredeath in the shape of a man
i came on doggedli save my strength i wa sure that i must catch him
at last it did not matter when
at length he reach the snowlin where the path end and for the
first time he look back there i wa some two hundr pace behind
him i hi death wa behind him and in front of him shone the snow
for a moment he hesit and i heard the heavi breath of hi hors
in the great still then he turn and face the slope drive hi
spur into the brute side the snow wa hard for here the frost bit
sharpli and for a while though it wa so steep the hors travel
over it better than he had done along the pathwai now as befor there
wa onli on road that he could take for we pass up the crest of a
ridg a pleat as it were in the garment of the mountain and on either
side were steep of snow on which neither hors nor man might keep hi
foot for two hour or more we follow that ridg and as we went
through the silenc of the haunt volcan and the loneli of it
etern snow it seem to me that my spirit enter into the spirit
of my quarri and that with it ey i saw all that wa pass in hi
heart to a man so wrong the dream wa pleasant even if it were not
true for i read there such agoni such black despair such haunt
memori such terror of advanc death and of what lai beyond it that
no reveng of man could surpass their torment and it wa truei
knew that it wa true he suffer all thi and more for if he had no
conscienc at least he had fear and imagin to quicken and multipli
the fear
now the snow grew steeper and the hors wa almost spent for he could
scarc breath at so great a height in vain did de garcia drive hi
spur into it side the gallant beast could do no more suddenli it
fell down sure i thought he will await me now but even i had not
fathom the depth of hi terror for de garcia disengag himself
from the fallen hors look toward me then fled forward on hi feet
cast awai hi armour as he went that he might travel more lightli
by thi time we had pass the snow and were come to the edg of the ic
cap that is made by the melt of the snow with the heat of the inner
fire or perhap by that of the sun in hot season i know not and
it freez in the winter month or in the cold of the night at least
there is such a cap on xaca measur nearli a mile in depth which
li between the snow and the black rim of the crater up thi ic
climb de garcia and the task is not of the easiest even for on of
untroubl mind for a man must step from crack to crack or needl
to needl of rough ic that stand upon the smooth surfac like the
bristl on a hog back and woe to him if on break or if he slip for
then as he fall veri shortli the flesh will be file from hi bone
by the thousand of swordlik point over which he must pass in hi
descent toward the snow inde mani time i fear greatli lest thi
should chanc to de garcia for i did not desir to lose my vengeanc
thu therefor twice when i saw him in danger i shout to him tell
him where to put hi feet for now i wa within twenti pace of
him and strang to sai he obei me without question forget
everyth in hi terror of instant death but for myself i had no fear
for i knew that i should not fall though the place wa on which i had
sure shrunk from climb at ani other time
all thi while we had been travel toward xaca fieri crest by the
bright moonlight but now the dawn broke suddenli on the mountain top
and the flame di awai in the heart of the pillar of smoke it wa
wonder to see the red glori that shone upon the icecap and on us
two men who crept like fli across it while the mountain breast and
the world below were plung in the shadow of night
now we have a better light to climb by comrad i call to de
garcia and my voic rang strang among the ic cliff where never a
man voic had echo befor
as i spoke the mountain rumbl and bellow beneath us shake like
a windtoss tree as though in wrath at the desecr of it sacr
solitud with the rumbl came a shower of grei ash that rain
down on us and for a littl while hid de garcia from my sight i heard
him call out in fear and wa afraid lest he had fallen but present
the ash clear awai and i saw him stand safe on the lava rim
that surround the crater
now i thought he will sure make a stand for could he have found
courag it had been easi for him to kill me with hi sword which he
still wore as i climb from the ic to the hot lava it seem that he
thought of it for he turn and glare at me like a devil then went on
again leav me wonder where he believ that he would find refug
some three hundr pace from the edg of the ic the smoke and steam
of the crater rose into the air and between the two wa lava so hot
that in place it wa difficult to walk upon it across thi bed that
trembl as i pass over it went de garcia somewhat slowli for now he
wa weari and i follow him at my eas get my breath again
present i saw that he had come to the edg of the crater for he
lean forward and look over and i thought that he wa about to
destroi himself by plung into it but if such thought had been in
hi mind he forgot them when he had seen what sort of nest thi wa
to sleep in for turn he came back toward me sword up and we met
within a dozen pace of the edg i sai met but in truth we did not
meet for he stop again well out of reach of my sword i sat down
upon a block of lava and look at him it seem to me that i could not
feast my ey enough upon hi face and what a face it wa that of a
more than murder about to meet hi reward would that i could paint to
show it for no word can tell the fear of those red and sunken
ey those grin teeth and quiver lip i think that when the
enemi of mankind ha cast hi last die and won hi last soul he too
will look thu as he pass into doom
at length de garcia i said
why do you not kill me and make an end he ask hoars
where is the hurri cousin for hard on twenti year i have sought you
shall we then part so soon let us talk a while befor we part to meet
no more perhap of your courtesi you will answer me a question for i
am curiou why have you wrought these evil on me and mine sure
you must have some reason for what seem to be an empti and foolish
wicked
i spoke to him thu calmli and coldli feel no passion feel
noth for in that strang hour i wa no longer thoma wingfield i
wa no longer human i wa a forc an instrument i could think of my
dead son without sorrow he did not seem dead to me for i partook of
the natur that he had put on in thi chang of death i could even
think of de garcia without hate as though he also were noth but a
tool in some other hand moreov i knew that he wa mine bodi and
mind and that he must answer and truli so sure as he must die when
i chose to kill him he tri to shut hi lip but thei open of
themselv and word by word the truth wa drag from hi black heart
as though he stood alreadi befor the judgment seat
i love your mother my cousin he said speak slowli and
painfulli from a child i love her onli in the world as i love her to
thi hour but she hate me becaus i wa wick and fear me becaus i
wa cruel then she saw your father and love him and brought about hi
escap from the holi offic whither i had deliv him to be tortur
and burnt and fled with him to england i wa jealou and would have
been reveng if i might but there wa no wai i led an evil life and
when nearli twenti year had gone by chanc took me to england on a
trade journei by chanc i learn that your father and mother live
near yarmouth and i determin to see her though at that time i had no
thought of kill her fortun favour me and we met in the woodland
and i saw that she wa still beauti and knew that i love her more
than ever befor i gave her choic to fly with me or to die and after
a while she di but as she shrank up the wood hillsid befor my
sword of a sudden she stood still and said
listen befor you smite juan i have a death vision as i have fled
from you so shall you fly befor on of my blood in a place of fire and
rock and snow and as you drive me to the gate of heaven so he shall
drive you into the mouth of hell
in such a place as thi cousin i said
in such a place as thi he whisper glanc round
continu
again he strove to be silent but again my will master him and he
spoke
it wa too late to spare her if i wish to escap myself so i kill
her and fled but terror enter my heart terror which ha never left
it to thi hour for alwai befor my ey wa the vision of him of
your mother blood befor whom i should fly as she fled befor me who
shall drive me into the mouth of hell
that must be yonder cousin i said point with the sword toward
the pit of the crater
it is yonder i have look
but onli for the bodi cousin not for the spirit
onli for the bodi not for the spirit he repeat after me
continu i said
afterward on that same dai i met you thoma wingfield alreadi your
dead mother propheci had taken hold of me and see on of her blood
i strove to kill him lest he should kill me
as he will do present cousin
as he will do present he repeat like a talk bird
you know what happen and how i escap i fled to spain and strove
to forget but i could not on night i saw a face in the street of
sevil that remind me of your face i did not think that it could
be you yet so strong wa my fear that i determin to fly to the far
indi you met me on the night of my flight when i wa bid farewel
to a ladi
on isabella de siguenza cousin i bade farewel to her afterward and
deliv her dy word to you now she wait to welcom you again
she and her child
he shudder and went on in the ocean we met again you rose out of
the sea i did not dare to kill you at onc i thought that you must die
in the slavehold and that none could bear wit against me and hold
me guilti of your blood you did not die even the sea could not destroi
you but i thought that you were dead i came to anahuac in the train
of cort and again we met that time you nearli kill me afterward
i had my reveng and i tortur you well i meant to murder you on the
morrow though first i would tortur you for terror can be veri cruel
but you escap me long year pass i wander hither and thither to
spain back to mexico and elsewher but wherev i went my fear
the ghost of the dead and my dream went with me and i wa never
fortun onli the other dai i join the compani of diaz as an
adventur not till we reach the citi of pine did i learn that you
were the captain of the otomi it wa said that you were long dead you
know the rest
why did you murder my son cousin
wa he not of your mother blood of the blood that should bring my
doom upon me and did i ow you no reward for all the terror of these
mani year moreov he is foolish who strive to slai the father and
spare the son he is dead and i am glad that i kill him though he
haunt me now with the other
and shall haunt you etern now let us make an end you have your
sword us it if you can it will be easier to die fight
i cannot he groan my doom is upon me
as you will and i came at him sword up
he ran from befor me move backward and keep hi ey fix upon
mine as i have seen a rat do when a snake is about to swallow it now
we were upon the edg of the crater and look over i saw an aw
sight for there some thirti feet beneath us the redhot lava glow
sullenli beneath a shift pall of smoke roll and spout like a
thing aliv jet of steam flew upward from it with a scream sound
line of noxiou vapour manycolour crept and twist on it
surfac and a hot and horrid stench poison the heat air here
inde wa such a gate as i could wish for de garcia to pass through to
hi own abod
i look point with my sword and laugh he look and shriek
aloud for now all hi manhood had left him so great wa hi terror of
what lai beyond the end ye thi proud and haughti spaniard scream
and wept and prai for merci he who had done so mani villani beyond
forgiv prai for merci that he might find time to repent i stood
and watch him and so dread wa hi aspect that horror struck me
even through the calm of my frozen heart
come it is time to finish i said and again i lift my sword onli
to let it fall for suddenli hi brain gave wai and de garcia went mad
befor my ey
of all that follow i will not write with hi mad courag came
back to him and he began to fight but not with me
he seem to perceiv me no more but nevertheless he fought and
desper thrust at the empti air it wa terribl to see him
thu do battl with hi invis foe and to hear hi scream and
curs as inch by inch thei drove him back to the edg of the
crater here he stood a while like on who make a last stand against
overpow strength thrust and strike furious twice he nearli
fell as though beneath a mortal wound but recov himself fought
on with nothing then with a sharp cry suddenli he threw hi arm
wide as a man doe who is pierc through the heart hi sword drop
from hi hand and he fell backward into the pit
i turn awai my ey for i wish to see no more but often i have
wonder who or what it wa that dealt de garcia hi death wound
chapter xxxviii
otomi farewel
thu then did i accomplish the vengeanc that i had sworn to my father
i would wreak upon de garcia or rather thu did i wit it
accomplish for in the end he di terribl enough not by my hand
but by those of hi own fear sinc then i have sorrow for thi for
when the frozen and unnatur calm pass from my mind i hate him as
bitterli as ever and griev that i let him die otherwis than by my
hand and to thi hour such is my mind toward him doubtless mani mai
think it wick sinc we ar taught to forgiv our enemi but here i
leav the forgiv to god for how can i pardon on who betrai my
father to the priest who murder my mother and my son who chain
me in the slaveship and for mani hour tortur me with hi own hand
rather year by year do i hate him more i write of thi at some
length sinc the matter ha been a troubl to me i never could sai
that i wa in chariti with all men live and dead and becaus of thi
some year sinc a worthi and learn rector of thi parish took upon
himself to refus me the rite of the church then i went to the bishop
and laid the stori befor him and it puzzl him somewhat
but he wa a man of larg mind and in the end he rebuk the rector
and command him to minist to me for he thought with me that the
almighti could not ask of an er man that he should forgiv on who
had wrought such evil on him and hi even though that enemi were dead
and gone to judgment in anoth place
but enough of thi question of conscienc
when de garcia wa gone into the pit i turn my step homeward or
rather toward the ruin citi which i could see beneath me for i had
no home left now i must descend the ic cap and thi i found less
easi than climb it had been for my vengeanc be accomplish i
becam as other men ar and a sad and weari on at that so sad inde
that i should not have sorrow greatli if i had made a fals step upon
the ic
but i made none and at length i came to the snow where the travel
wa easi my oath wa fulfil and my vengeanc wa accomplish but
as i went i reckon up the cost i had lost my betroth the love of
my youth for twenti year i had live a savag chief among savag and
made acquaint with everi hardship wed to a woman who although
she love me dearli and did not lack nobil of mind as she had shown
the other dai wa still at heart a savag or at the least a thrall
of demon god the tribe that i rule wa conquer the beauti citi
where i dwelt wa a ruin i wa homeless and a beggar and my fortun
would be great if in the issu i escap death or slaveri all thi i
could have born for i had born the like befor but the cruel end of
my last surviv son the on true joi of my desol life i could
not bear the love of those children had becom the passion of my middl
ag and as i love them so thei had love me i had train them from
babyhood till their heart were english and not aztec as were their
speech and faith and thu thei were not onli my dear children but
companion of my own race the onli on i had and now by accid by
sick and by the sword thei were dead the three of them and i wa
desol
ah we think much of the sorrow of our youth and should a sweetheart
give us the go by we fill the world with moan and swear that it hold
no comfort for us but when we bend our head befor the shroud shape
of some lost child then it is that for the first time we learn how
terribl grief can be time thei tell us will bring consol
but it is fals for such sorrow time ha no salvesi sai it who am
olda thei ar so thei shall be there is no hope but faith there is
no comfort save in the truth that love which might have wither on the
earth grow fastest in the tomb to flower glorious in heaven that no
love inde can be perfect till god sanctifi and complet it with hi
seal of death
i threw myself down there upon the desol snow of xaca that none had
trod befor and wept such tear as a man mai weep but onc in hi life
dai
o my son absalom my son my son absalom would god i had di for
thee o absalom my son my son i cri with the ancient kingi whose
grief wa greater than hi for had i not lost three son within as mani
year then rememb that as thi king had gone to join hi son
long centuri ago so i must on dai go to join mine and take such
comfort from the thought as mai be found in it i rose and crept back to
the ruin citi of pine
it wa near sunset when i came thither for the road wa long and i grew
weak by the palac i met the captain diaz and some of hi compani and
thei lift their bonnet to me as i went by for thei had respect for
my sorrow onli diaz spoke sai
is the murder dead
i nod and went on i went on to our chamber for there i thought that
i should find otomi
she sat in it alon cold and beauti as though she had been fashion
in marbl
i have buri him with the bone of hi brethren and hi forefath
she said answer the question that my ey ask it seem best
that you should see him no more lest your heart should break
it is well i answer but my heart is broken alreadi
is the murder dead she said present in the veri word of diaz
he is dead
how
i told her in few word
you should have slain him yourself our son blood is not aveng
i should have slain him but in that hour i did not seek vengeanc i
watch it fall from heaven and wa content perchanc it is best so
the seek of vengeanc ha brought all my sorrow upon me vengeanc
belong to god and not to man as i have learn too late
i do not think so said otomi and the look upon her face wa that
look which i had seen when she smote the tlascalan when she taunt
marina and when she danc upon the pyramid the leader of the
sacrific had i been in your place i would have kill him by inch
when i had done with him then the devil might begin not befor but
it is of no account everyth is done with all ar dead and my heart
with them now eat for you ar weari
so i at and afterward i cast myself upon the bed and slept
in the dark i heard the voic of otomi that said awak i would
speak with you and there wa that about her voic which stir me
from my heavi sleep
speak on i said where ar you otomi
seat at your side i cannot rest so i am seat here listen mani
mani year ago we met when you were brought by guatemoc from tobasco
ah well do i rememb my first sight of you the teul in the court
of my father montezuma at chapoltepec i love you then as i have love
you ever sinc at least i have never gone astrai after strang god
and she laugh bitterli
why do you talk of these thing otomi i ask
becaus it is my fanci to do so cannot you spare me on hour from your
sleep who have spare you so mani you rememb how you scorn meoh
i thought i should have di of shame when after i had caus myself
to be given to you as wife the wife of tezcat you told me of the
maid across the sea that lili maid whose token is still set upon
your finger but i live through it and i love you the better for your
honesti and then you know the rest i won you becaus i wa brave and
lai at your side upon the stone of sacrific where you kiss me and
told me that you love me but you never love me not truli all the
while you were think of the lili maid i knew it then as i know it
now though i tri to deceiv myself i wa beauti in those dai and
thi is someth with a man i wa faith and that is more and onc
or twice you thought that you love me now i wish that those teul had
come an hour later and we had di togeth there upon the stone that
is i wish it for my own sake not for your then we escap and the
great struggl came i told you then that i understood it all you had
kiss me on the stone of sacrific but in that moment you were as on
dead when you came back to life it wa otherwis but fortun took the
game out of your hand and you marri me and swore an oath to me and

now that i onli care for them becaus thei were your and thei

hous of the sun to seek my own peopl and to you teul with whom
i have live mani year and seen much sorrow but whom i will no longer
call husband sinc you forbad me so to do i sai make no mock of
me to the lili maid speak of me to her as littl as you mayb happi
andfarewel
now as she spoke ever more faintli and i listen bewild the light
of dawn grew slowli in the chamber it gather on the white shape of
otomi seat in a chair hard by the bed and i saw that her arm hung
down and that her head wa rest on the back of the chair now i
sprang up and peer into her face it wa white and cold and i could
feel no breath upon her lip i seiz her hand that also wa cold i
spoke into her ear i kiss her brow but she did not move nor answer
the light grew quickli and now i saw all otomi wa dead and by her
own act
thi wa the manner of her death she had drunk of a poison of which the
indian have the secret a poison that work slowli and without pain
leav the mind uncloud to the end it wa while her life wa fade
from her that she had spoken to me thu sadli and bitterli i sat upon
the bed and gaze at her i did not weep for my tear were done and as
i have said whatev i might feel noth could break my calm ani more
and as i gaze a great tender and sorrow took hold of me and i
love otomi better now that she wa dead befor me than ever i had done
in her life dai and thi is sai much i rememb her in the glori
of her youth as she wa in the court of her royal father i rememb
the look which she had given me when she step to my side upon the
stone of sacrific and that other look when she defi cuitlahua the
emperor who would have slain me onc more i seem to hear her cry of
bitter sorrow as she uncov the bodi of the dead babe our firstborn
and to see her sword in hand stand over the tlascalan
mani thing came back to me in that sad hour of dawn while i watch
by the corps of otomi there wa truth in her word i had never
forgotten my first love and often i desir to see her face but it wa
not true to sai that i had no love for otomi i love her well and i
wa faith in my oath to her inde not until she wa dead did i
know how dear she had grown to me it is true that there wa a great
gulf between us which widen with the year the gulf of blood and
faith for i knew well that she could not altogeth put awai her old
belief and it is true that when i saw her lead the death chant a
great horror took me and for a while i loath her but these thing i
might have live to forgiv for thei were part of her blood and natur
moreov the last and worst of them wa not done by her own will and
when thei were set asid there remain much that i could honour and
love in the memori of thi most royal and beauti woman who for so
mani year wa my faith wife so i thought in that hour and so i
think to thi dai she said that we part for ever but i trust and i
believ that thi is not so sure there is forgiv for us all and
a place where those who were near and dear to each other on the earth
mai onc more renew their fellowship
at last i rose with a sigh to seek help and as i rose i felt that there
wa someth set about my neck it wa the collar of great emerald
which guatemoc had given to me and that i had given to otomi she had
set it there while i slept and with it a lock of her long hair both
shall be buri with me
i laid her in the ancient sepulchr amid the bone of her forefath
and by the bodi of her children and two dai later i rode to mexico
in the train of bernal diaz at the mouth of the pass i turn and
look back upon the ruin of the citi of pine where i had live
so mani year and where all i love were buri long and earnestli i
gaze as in hi hour of death a man look back upon hi past life till
at length diaz laid hi hand upon my shoulder
you ar a lone man now comrad he said what plan have you for
the futur
none i answer except to die
never talk so he said why you ar scarc forti and i who am
fifti and more do not speak of dy listen you have friend in your
own countri england

folk live long in those quiet land go seek them i will find you a
passag to spain

in time we came to mexico a new and a strang citi to me for cort
had rebuilt it and where the teocal had stood up which i wa led to
sacrific a cathedr wa build whereof the foundat were fitli
laid with the hideou idol of the aztec the place wa well enough
but it is not so beauti as the tenoctitlan of montezuma nor ever
will be the peopl too were chang then thei were warrior and free
now thei ar slave
in mexico diaz found me a lodg none molest me there for the
pardon that i had receiv wa respect also i wa a ruin man no
longer to be fear the part that i had plai in the noch trist and
in the defenc of the citi wa forgotten and the tale of my sorrow won
me piti even from the spaniard i abod in mexico ten dai wander
sadli about the citi and up to the hill of chapoltepec where
montezuma pleasurehous had been and where i had met otomi noth
wa left of it glori except some of the ancient cedar tree on the
eighth dai of my stai an indian stop me in the street sai that an
old friend had charg him to sai that she wish to see me
i follow the indian wonder who the friend might be for i had no
friend and he led me to a fine stone hous in a new street here i wa
seat in a darken chamber and wait there a while till suddenli
a sad and sweet voic that seem familiar to me address me in the
aztec tongu sai welcom teul
i look and there befor me dress in the spanish fashion stood
a ladi an indian still beauti but veri feebl and much worn as
though with sick and sorrow
do you not know marina teul she said again but befor the word
had left her lip i knew her well i will sai thi that i should
scarc have known you teul troubl and time have done their work
with both of us
i took her hand and kiss it

juan xaramillo who took me becaus of my possess for cort dealt
liber with me hi discard mistress and she began to weep
then by degre i learn the stori but i will not write it here for
it is known to the world when marina had serv hi turn and her wit
wa of no more servic to him the conqueror discard her leav her
to wither of a broken heart she told me all the tale of her anguish
when she learn the truth and of how she had cri to him that
thenceforth he would never prosper nor inde did he do so
for two hour or more we talk and when i had heard her stori i told
her mine and she wept for me sinc with all her fault marina heart
wa ever gentl
then we part never to meet again befor i went she press a gift of
monei on me and i wa not asham to take it who had none
thi then wa the histori of marina who betrai her countri for her
love sake and thi the reward of her treason and her love but i
shall alwai hold her memori sacr for she wa a good friend to me
and twice she save my life nor would she desert me even when otomi
taunt her so cruelli
chapter xxxix
thoma come back from the dead
now on the morrow of my visit to marina the captain diaz came to see me
and told me that a friend of hi wa in command of a carak which wa due
to sail from the port of vera cruz for cadiz within ten dai and
that thi friend wa will to give me a passag if i wish to leav
mexico i thought for a while and said that i would go and that veri
night have bid farewel to the captain diaz whom mai god prosper
for he wa a good man among mani bad on i set out from the citi for
the last time in the compani of some merchant a week journei took
us safe down the mountain to vera cruz a hot unhealthi town with an
indiffer anchorag much expos to the fierc northerli wind here
i present my letter of recommend to the command of the carak
who gave me passag without question i lai in a stock of food for
the journei
three night later we set sail with a fair wind and on the follow
morn at daybreak all that wa left in sight of the land of anahuac
wa the snowi crest of the volcan orizaba present that vanish into
the cloud and thu did i bid farewel to the far countri where so mani
thing had happen to me and which accord to my reckon i had
first sight on thi veri dai eighteen year befor
of my journei to spain i have noth of note to tell it wa more
prosper than such voyag often ar and within ten week of the date
of our lift anchor at vera cruz we let it drop in the harbour of
cadiz here i sojourn but two dai for as it chanc there wa an
english ship in the harbour trade to london and in her i took a
passag though i wa oblig to sell the smallest of the emerald from
the necklac to find the mean to do so the monei that marina gave me
be spent thi emerald sold for a great sum howev with part of
which i purchas cloth suitabl to a person of rank take the rest
of the gold with me i griev to part with the stone inde though it
wa but a pendant to the pendant of the collar but necess know no
law the pendant stone itself a fine gem though flaw i gave in after
year to her graciou majesti queen elizabeth
on board the english ship thei thought me a spanish adventur who had
made monei in the indi and i did not undec them sinc i would
be left to my own compani for a while that i might prepar my mind to
return to wai of thought and life that it had long forgotten therefor
i sat apart like some proud don sai littl but listen much and
learn all i could of what had chanc in england sinc i left it some
twenti year befor
at length our voyag came to an end and on a certain twelfth of june i
found myself in the mighti citi of london that i had never yet visit
and kneel down in the chamber of my inn i thank god that after
endur so mani danger and hardship it had pleas him to preserv
me to set foot again on english soil inde to thi hour i count it
noth short of marvel that thi frail bodi of a man should surviv
all the sorrow and risk of death by sick hunger battl murder
drown wild beast and the cruelti of men to which mine had been
expos for mani year
in london i bought a good hors through the kind offic of the host of
my inn and on the morrow at daybreak i set out upon the ipswich road
that veri morn my last adventur befel me for as i jog along
muse of the beauti of the english landscap and drink in the sweet
air of june a cowardli thief fire a pistol at me from behind a hedg
purpos to plunder me if i fell the bullet pass through my hat
graze the skull but befor i could do anyth the rascal fled
see that he had miss hi mark and i went on my journei think
to myself that it would inde have been strang if after pass such
great danger in safeti i had di at last by the hand of a miser
footpad within five mile of london town
i rode hard all that dai and the next and my hors be stout and
swift by halfpast seven oclock of the even i pull up upon the
littl hill whenc i had look my last on bungai when i rode thenc
for yarmouth with my father below me lai the red roof of the town
there to the right were the oak of ditchingham and the beauti tower
of st mari church yonder the stream of wavenei wander and befor
me stretch the meadow land purpl and golden with marsh weed in
bloom all wa as it had been i could see no chang at all the onli
chang wa in myself i dismount and go to a pool of water near
the roadwai i look at the reflect of my own face i wa chang
inde scarc should i have known it for that of the lad who had
ridden up thi hill some twenti year ago now ala the ey were
sunken and veri sorrow the featur were sharp and there wa more
grei than black in the beard and hair i should scarc have known it
myself would ani other know it i wonder would there be ani to know
it inde in twenti year mani die and other pass out of sight should
i find a friend at all among the live sinc i read the letter which
captain bell of the adventuress had brought me befor i sail for
hispaniola i had heard no tide from my home and what tide
await me now abov all what of lili wa she dead or marri or gone
mount my hors i push on again at a canter take the road past
waingford mill through the ford and pirnhow town leav bungai upon
my left in ten minut i wa at the gate of the bridl path that run
from the norwich road for half a mile or more beneath the steep and
wood bank under the shelter of which stand the lodg at ditchingham
by the gate a man loiter in the last rai of the sun i look at
him and knew him it wa billi minn that same fool who had loos de
garcia when i left him bound that i might run to meet my sweetheart
he wa an old man now and hi white hair hung about hi wither face
moreov he wa unclean and dress in rag but i could have fallen on
hi neck and embrac him so rejoic wa i to look onc more on on
whom i had known in youth
see me come he hobbl on hi stick to the gate to open it for me
whine a prayer for alm
doe mr wingfield live here i said point up the path and my
breath came quick as i ask
mr wingfield sir mr wingfield which of them he answer the
old gentleman he been dead nigh upon twenti year i help to dig
hi grave in the chancel of yonder church i did we laid him by hi
wifeh that wa murder then there mr geoffrei
what of him i ask
he dead too twelv year gone or more he drank hisself to dead
he did and mr thoma he dead drown over sea thei sai mani
a winter back theyr all dead all dead ah he wa a rare on mr
thoma wa i mind me well how when i let the furrin go and he
rambl off into the tale of how he had set de garcia on hi hors after
i had beaten him nor could i bring him back from it
cast him a piec of monei i set spur to my weari hors and canter
up the bridl path leav the mill hous on my left and as i went
the beat of hi hoof seem to echo the old man word all dead all
dead doubtless lili wa dead also or if she wa not dead when the
tide came that i had been drown at sea she would have marri
be so fair and sweet she would sure not have lack for suitor
nor could it be believ that she had worn her life awai mourn over
the lost love of her youth
now the lodg wa befor me it had chang no whit except that the ivi
and creeper on it front had grown higher to the roof inde and
i could see that peopl live in the hous for it wa well kept and
smoke hung abov the chimnei the gate wa lock and there were no
serv men about for night fell fast and all had ceas from their
labour leav the hous on the right i pass round it to the stabl
that ar at the back near the hillsid garden but here the gate wa
lock also and i dismount not know what to do inde i wa so
unman with fear and doubt that for a while i seem bewild and
leav the hors to crop the grass where he stood i wander to the
foot of the church path and gaze up the hill as though i wait for the
come of on whom i should meet
what if thei were all dead what if she were dead and gone i buri
my face in my hand and prai to the almighti who had protect me
through so mani year to spare me thi last bitter i wa crush
with sorrow and i felt that i could bear no more if lili were lost to
me also then i thought that it would be best that i should die sinc
there wa noth left for which i care to live
thu i prai for some while trembl like a leaf and when i look
up again er i turn to seek tide from those that dwelt in the
hous whoever thei might be the twilight had fallen complet and
lo nightingal sang both far and near i listen to their song and
as i listen some troubl memori came back to me that at first i
could not grasp then suddenli there rose up in my mind a vision of the
splendid chamber in montezuma palac in tenoctitlan and of myself
sleep on a golden bed and dream on that bed i knew it now i wa
the god tezcat and on the morrow i must be sacrif and i slept in
miseri and as i slept i dream i dream that i stood where i stood
thi night that the scent of the english flower wa in my nostril as
it wa thi night and that the sweet song of the nightingal rang in
my ear as at thi present hour i dream that as i muse and listen
the moon came up over the green ash and oak and lo there she shone i
dream that i heard a sound of sing on the hill
but now i awok from thi vision of the past and of a long lost dream
for as i stood the sweet voic of a woman began to sing yonder on the
brow of the slope i wa not mad i heard it clearli and the sound grew
ever nearer as the singer drew down the steep hillsid it wa so near
now that i could catch the veri word of that sad song which to thi dai
i rememb
now i could see the woman shape in the moonlight it wa tall and
state and clad in a white robe present she lift her head to watch
the flitter of a bat and the moonlight lit upon her face it wa the
face of lili bozard my lost love beauti as of yore though grown
older and stamp with the seal of some great sorrow i saw and so
deepli wa i stir at the sight that had it not been for the low
pale to which i clung i must have fallen to the earth and a deep
groan broke from my lip
she heard the groan and ceas her song then catch sight of the
figur of a man she stop and turn as though to fly i stood quit
still and wonder overcom her fear she drew nearer and spoke in the
sweet low voic that i rememb well sai who wander here so
late is it you john
now when i heard her speak thu a new fear took me doubtless she wa
marri and john wa her husband i had found her but to lose her more
complet of a sudden it came into my mind that i would not discov
myself till i knew the truth i advanc a pace but not so far as to
pass from the shadow of the shrub which grow here and take my stand
in such a fashion that the moonlight did not strike upon my face i
bow low in the courtli spanish fashion and disguis my voic spoke
as a spaniard might in broken english which i will spare to write down
madam i said have i the honour to speak to on who in bygon year
wa name the senora lili bozard
that wa my name she answer what is your errand with me sir
now i trembl afresh but spoke on boldli
befor i answer madam forgiv me if i ask anoth question is thi
still your name
it is still my name i am no marri woman she answer and for a
moment the sky seem to reel abov me and the ground to heav beneath
my feet like the lava crust of xaca but as yet i did not reveal myself
for i wish to learn if she still love my memori
senora i said i am a spaniard who serv in the indian war of
cort of which perhap you have heard
she bow her head and i went on in those war i met a man who wa
name teul but who had anoth name in former dai so he told me on
hi deathb some two year ago

now lili moan aloud and in her turn caught at the pale to save
herself from fall
i deem him dead these eighteen year she gasp drown in the
indian sea where hi vessel founder
i have heard sai that he wa shipwreck in those sea senora but he
escap death and fell among the indian who made a god of him and gave
him the daughter of their king in marriag and i paus
she shiver then said in a hard voic continu sir i listen to
you
my friend teul took the part of the indian in the war as be
the husband of on of their princess he must do in honour and fought
brave for them for mani year at length the town that he defend wa
captur hi on remain child wa murder hi wife the princess
slew herself for sorrow and he himself wa taken into captiv where
he languish and di
a sad tale sir she said with a littl laugha mourn laugh that
wa half choke by tear
a veri sad tale senora but on which is not finish while he lai
dy my friend told me that in hi earli life he had plight troth
with a certain english maid name
i know the namecontinu
he told me that though he had been wed and love hi wife the
princess who wa a veri royal woman that mani time had risk her
life for hi ay even to ly at hi side upon the stone of sacrific
and of her own free will yet the memori of thi maiden to whom he wa
onc betroth had companion him through life and wa strong upon him
now at it close therefor he prai me for our friendship sake to
seek her out when i return to europ should she still live and to
give her a messag from him and to make a prayer to her on hi behalf
what messag and what prayer lili whisper
thi that he love her at the end of hi life as he had love her
at it begin that he humbl prai her forgiv becaus he had
broken the troth which thei two swore beneath the beech at ditchingham
sir she cri what do you know of that
onli what my friend told me senora
your friendship must have been close and your memori must be good she
murmur
which he had done i went on under strang circumst so strang
inde that he dare to hope that hi broken troth might be renew in
some better world than thi hi last prayer wa that she should sai to
me hi messeng that she forgav him and still love him as to hi
death he love her
and how can such forgiv or such an avow advantag a dead man
lili ask watch me keenli through the shadow have the dead then
ey to see and ear to hear
how can i know senora i do but execut my mission
and how can i know that you ar a true messeng it chanc that i
had sure tide of the drown of thoma wingfield mani year ago and
thi tale of indian and princess is wondrou strang more like those
that happen in romanc than in thi plain world have you no token of
your good faith sir
i have such a token senora but the light is too faint for you to see
it
then follow me to the hous there we will get light stai and onc
more go to the stabl gate she call john
an old man answer her and i knew the voic for that of on of my
father serv men to him she spoke in low tone then led the wai by
the garden path to the front door of the hous which she open with
a kei from her girdl motion to me to pass in befor her i did so
and think littl of such matter at the moment turn by habit into
the doorwai of the sittingroom which i knew so well lift my feet
to avoid stumbl on it step and pass into the room found my wai
through the gloom to the wide fireplac where i took my stand lili
watch me enter then follow me she lit a taper at the fire which
smoulder on the hearth and place it upon the tabl in the window in
such fashion that though i wa now oblig to take off my hat my face
wa still in shadow
now sir your token if it pleas you
then i drew the posi ring from my finger and gave it to her and she sat
down by the tabl and examin it in the light of the candl and as
she sat thu i saw how beauti she wa still and how littl time had
touch her except for the sad of her face though now she had seen
eightandthirti winter i saw also that though she kept control of her
featur as she look upon the ring her breast heav quickli and her
hand shook
the token is a true on she said at length i know the ring though
it is somewhat worn sinc last i saw it it wa my mother and mani
year ago i gave it as a love gage to a youth to whom i promis myself
in marriag doubtless all your tale is true also sir and i thank you

companion mari bozard will be glad to learn the stori of hi strang
adventur from your lip
i bow my head and answer first senora i would prai your answer

ah you know that also but doubtless you have carri the ring for
mani month and learn the write well sir though we were far
apart and though perchanc i cherish the memori of him who wore thi
ring and for hi sake remain unw it seem that hi heart went a
strayingto the breast inde of some savag woman whom he marri and
who bore him children that be so my answer to the prayer of your
dead friend is that i forgiv him inde but i must need take back
the vow which i swore to him for thi life and for ever sinc he ha
broken them and as best i mai strive to cast out the love i bore him
sinc he reject and dishonour it and stand up lili made as
though she tore at her breast and threw someth from her and at the
same time she let fall the ring upon the floor
i heard and my heart stood still so thi wa the end of it well she
had the right of me though now i began to wish that i had been
less honest for sometim women can forgiv a lie sooner than such
frank i said noth my tongu wa ti but a great miseri and
weari enter into me stoop down i found the ring and replac
it on my finger i turn to seek the door with a last glanc at the
woman who refus me halfwai thither i paus for on second wonder
if i should do well to declar myself then bethought me that if she
would not abat her anger toward me dead her piti for me live would
be small nai i wa dead to her and dead i would remain
now i wa at the door and my foot wa on it step when suddenli a
voic lili voic sound in my ear and it wa sweet and kind
thoma said the voic thoma befor you go will you not take
count of the gold and good and land that you place in my keep
now i turn amaz and lo lili came toward me slowli and with
outstretch arm

woman heart thu clumsili you who talk of the beech in the hall
garden you who found your wai so well to thi dark chamber and spoke
the write in the ring with the veri voic of on who ha been dead so
long listen i forgiv that friend of your hi broken troth for he
wa honest in the tell of hi fault and it is hard for man to live
alon so mani year and in strang countri come strang adventur
moreov i will sai it i still love him as it seem that he love me
though in truth i grow somewhat old for love who have linger long
wait to find it beyond my grave
thu lili spoke sob as she spoke then my arm close round her
and she said no more and yet as our lip met i thought of otomi
rememb her word and rememb also that she had di by her own
hand on thi veri dai a year ago
let us prai that the dead have no vision of the live
chapter xl
amen
and now there is littl left for me to tell and my tale draw to
it end for which i am thank for i am veri old and write is a
weari to me so great a weari inde that mani a time dure the
past winter i have been near to abandon the task
for a while lili and i sat almost silent in thi same room where i write
todai for our great joi and mani anoth emot that wa mix with
it clog our tongu then as though move by on impuls we knelt
down and offer our humbl thank to heaven that had preserv us both
to thi strang meet scarc had we risen from our knee when
there wa a stir without the hous and present a buxom dame enter
follow by a gallant gentleman a lad and a maiden these were my
sister mari her husband wilfr bozard lili brother and their two
surviv children roger and joan when she guess that it wa i come
home again and no other lili had sent them tide by the servant man
john that on wa with her whom she believ thei would be glad to see
and thei had hurri hither not know whom thei should find nor were
thei much the wiser at first for i wa much chang and the light in
the room shone dim but stood perplex wonder who thi stranger
might be
mari i said at length mari do you not rememb me my sister
then she cri aloud and throw herself into my arm she wept there
a while as would ani of us were our belov dead suddenli to appear
befor our ey aliv and well and her husband clasp me by the hand
and swore heartili in hi amaz as is the fashion of some men when
thei ar move but the children stood stare blankli till i call the
girl to me who now wa much what her mother had been when we part
and kiss her told her that i wa that uncl of whom perhap she had
heard as dead mani year ago
then my hors that all thi while had been forgotten have been
caught and stabl we went to supper and it wa a strang meal to me
and after meat i ask for tide now i learn that the fortun which
my old master fonseca had left to me came home in safeti and that it
had prosper exceedingli under lili care for she had spent but veri
littl of it for her mainten look on it alwai as a trust rather
than as her own when my death seem certain my sister mari had enter
on her share of my possess howev and with it had purchas
some outli land in earsham and hedenham and the wood and manor of
tyndal hall in ditchingham and broom these land i made hast to sai
she might keep as a gift from me sinc it seem that i had greater
rich than i could need without them and thi sai of mine pleas
her husband wilfr bozard not a littl see that it is hard for a
man to give up what he ha held for mani year
then i heard the rest of the stori of my father sudden death of how
the come of the gold had save lili from be forc into marriag
with my brother geoffrei who afterward had taken to evil cours which
end in hi deceas at the ag of thirtyon of the end of squir
bozard lili father and my old enemi from an apoplexi which took
him in a sudden fit of anger after thi it seem her brother be
marri to my sister mari lili had move down to the lodg have paid
off the charg that my brother geoffrei had heap upon hi heritag
and bought out my sister right to it and here at the lodg she had
live ever sinc a sad and lone woman and yet not altogeth an
unhappi on for she gave much of her time to good work inde she
told me that had it not been for the wide land and monei which
she must manag as my heiress she would have betaken herself to a
sisterhood there to wear her life awai in peac sinc i be lost to
her and inde dead as she wa assuredfor the new of the wreck
of the carak found it wai to ditchinghamsh no longer thought of
marriag though more than on gentleman of condit had sought her
hand thi with some minor matter such as the birth and death of
children and the stori of the great storm and flood that smote bungai
and inde the length of the vale of wavenei in those dai wa all the
tale that thei had to tell who had grown from youth to middl ag in
quiet for of the crown and end of king and of matter polit such
as the downfal of the power of the pope of rome and the sack of the
religi hous which wa still in progress i make no mention here
but now thei call for mine and i began it at the begin and it
wa strang to see their face as thei listen all night long till
the thrush sang down the nightingal and the dawn shone in the
east i sat at lili side tell them my stori and then it wa not
finish so we slept in the chamber that had been made readi for us
and on the morrow i took it up again show them the sword that had
belong to bernal diaz the great necklac of emerald which guatemoc
had given to me and certain scar and wound in wit of it truth
never did i see folk so much amaz and when i came to speak of the
last sacrific of the women of the otomi and of the horrid end of de
garcia who di fight with hi own shadow or rather with the shadow
of hi own wicked thei cri aloud with fear as thei wept when i
told of the death of isabella de siguenza and of guatemoc and of the
loss of my son
but i did not tell all the stori to thi compani for some of it wa for
lili ear alon and to her i spoke of my deal with otomi as a
man might speak with a man for i felt that if i kept anyth back now
there would never be complet faith between us therefor i set out
all my doubt and troubl nor did i hide that i had learn to love
otomi and that her beauti and sweet had drawn me from the first
moment when i saw her in the court of montezuma or that which had
pass between us on the stone of sacrific
when i had done lili thank me for my honesti and said it seem that
in such matter men differ from women see that she had never felt
the need to be deliv from the temptat of strang love still we
were as god and natur had made us and therefor had littl right to
reproach each other or even to set that down as virtu which wa
but lack of lean moreov thi otomi her sin of heathen
notwithstand had been a greatheart woman and on who might well
dazzl the wander ey of man dare more for her love sake than
ever she lili could have dare and to end with it wa clear that at
last i must choos between wed her and a speedi death and have
sworn so great an oath to her i should have been perjur inde if
i had left her when my danger were gone by therefor she lili wa
mind to let all thi matter rest nor should she be jealou if i still
thought of thi dead wife of mine with tender
thu she spoke most sweetli look at me the while with her clear
and earnest ey that i ever fanci must be such as adorn the shine
face of angel ay and those same ey of her were fill with tear
when i told her my bitter grief over the death of my firstborn and of my
other bereav for it wa not till some year afterward when she
had abandon further hope of children that lili grew jealou of those
dead son of mine and of my ever present love for them
now the tide of my return and of my strang adventur among the
nation of the indi were nois abroad far and wide and peopl came
from mile round ay even from norwich and yarmouth to see me and i
wa press to tell my tale till i grew weari of it also a servic of
thanksgiv for my safe deliver from mani danger by land and sea
wa held in the church of st mari here in ditchingham which servic
wa no longer celebr after the rite of the romish faith for while
i had sojourn afar the saint were fallen like the aztec god the
yoke of rome had been broken from off the neck of england and though
all do not think with me i for on rejoic at it heartili who had seen
enough of priestcraft and it cruelti
when that ceremoni wa over and all peopl had gone to their home i
came back again to the empti church from the hall where i abod a while
as the guest of my sister and her husband till lili and i were wed
and there in the quiet light of the june even i knelt in the chancel
upon the rush that strew the grave of my father and my mother and
sent my spirit up toward them in the place of their etern rest and
to the god who guard them a great calm came upon me as i knelt thu
and i felt how mad had been that oath of mine that as a lad i had sworn
to be aveng upon de garcia and i saw how as a tree from a seed all
my sorrow had grown from it but even then i could not do other than
hate de garcia no nor can i to thi hour and after all it wa natur
that i should desir vengeanc on the murder of my mother though the
wreak of it had best been left in anoth hand
without the littl chancel door i met lili who wa linger there
know me to be within and we spoke togeth
lili i said i would ask you someth after all that ha been
will you still take me for your husband unworthi as i am
i promis so to do mani a year ago thoma she answer speak
veri low and blush like the wild rose that bloom upon a grave
besid her and i have never chang my mind inde for mani year i
have look upon you as my husband though i thought you dead
perhap it is more than i deserv i said but if it is to be sai
when it shall be for youth ha left us and we have littl time to
lose
when you will thoma she answer place her hand in mine
within a week from that even we were wed
and now my tale is done god who gave me so sad and troublou a youth
and earli manhood ha bless me beyond measur in my middl ag and
eld all these event of which i have written at such length were done
with mani a dai ago the hornbeam sapl that i set beneath these
window in the year when we were marri is now a goodli tree of shade
and still i live to look on it here in the happi vallei of the wavenei
save for my bitter memori and that long for the dead which no time
can so much as dull year after year ha roll over my silver hair
in perfect health and peac and rest and year by year have i rejoic
more deepli in the true love of a wife such as few have known for
it would seem as though the heartach and despair of youth had but
sweeten that most nobl natur till it grew well nigh divin but on
sorrow came to us the death of our infant childfor it wa fate that
i should die childlessand in that sorrow as i have told lili shew
that she wa still a woman for the rest no shadow lai between us hand
in hand we pass down the hill of life till at length in the ful
of her dai my wife wa taken from me on christma night she lai down
to sleep at my side in the morn she wa dead i griev inde and
bitterli but the sorrow wa not as the sorrow of my youth had been
sinc ag and us dull the edg of mortal grief and i knew and know
that we ar no long space apart veri soon i shall join lili where she
is and i do not fear that journei for the dread of death ha left me
at length as it depart from all who live long enough and strive to
repent them of their sin and i am well content to leav my safeti at
the gate and my heavenli comfort in the almighti hand that save me
from the stone of sacrific and ha guid me through so mani peril
upon thi troubl earth
and now to god my father who hold me thoma wingfield and all i
have love and love in hi holi keep be thank and glori and prais
amen
