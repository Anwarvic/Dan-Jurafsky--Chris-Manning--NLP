allan refus a fortun
had i the slightest qualif for the task i allan quatermain
would like to write an essai on temptat
thi of cours come to all in on shape or anoth or at ani rate
to most for there ar some peopl so colourless so invertebr that
thei cannot be temptedor perhap the subtl power which surround
and direct or misdirect us do not think them worth an effort these
cling to ani condit moral or materi in which thei mai find
themselv like limpet to a rock or perhap float along the stream
of circumst like jellyfish make no effort to find a path for
themselv in either case and therefor die as thei have livedquit
good becaus noth ha ever move them to be otherwiseth object
of the approb of the world and let us hope of heaven also
the major ar not so fortun someth is alwai eg their
live person along thi or that road of mischief materialist
will explain to us that thi someth is but the passion inherit
from a thousand gener of unknown progenitor who depart
left the curs of their blood behind them i who am but a simpl old
fellow take anoth view which at ani rate is hallow by mani
centuri of human opinion ye in thi matter as in sundri other
i put asid all the modern talk and theori and am plumb for the
good oldfashion and most effici devil as the author of our
woe no on els could suit the lure so exactli to the appetit as
that old fisherman in the water of the human soul who know so well
how to bait hi hook and chang hi fli so that thei mai be
attract not onli to all fish but to everi mood of each of them
well without go further with the argument rightli or wrongli
that is my opinion
thu to take a veri minor matterfor if the reader think that these
word ar the prelud to tell a tale of murder or other great sin
he is mistakeni believ that it wa satan himself or at ani rate
on of hi agent who caus my late friend ladi ragnal to
bequeath to me the casket of the magic herb call taduki in
connect with which alreadi we had share certain remark
adventur
see the book the ivori child and the ancient allan
now it mai be argu that to make us of thi taduki and on it
wing to be transport in fact or in imagin to some farawai
state in which on appear for a while to live and move and have on
be is no crime howev rash the proceed nor is it sinc if
we can find new road to knowledg or even to interest imagin
why should we not take them but to break on word is a crime and
becaus of the temptat of thi stuff which i confess for me ha
more allur than anyth els on earth at ani rate in these
latter dai i have broken my word
for after a certain experi at ragnal castl did i not swear to
myself and befor heaven that no power in the world not even that of
ladi ragnal herself would induc me again to inhal those time
dissolv fume and look upon that which perhap designedli is
hidden from the ey of man name reveal of hi buri past
or mayhap of hi yet unact futur what do i sai thi busi is
on of dreamsno more though i think that those dream ar best left
unexplor becaus thei suggest too much and yet leav the soul
unsatisfi better the ignor in which we ar doom to wander
than these lift of corner of the veil than these revel
which excit deliri hope that after all mai be but marsh light
which when thei vanish will leav us in complet black
now i will get on to the stori of my fall of how it came about and
the revel to which it led and which i found interest enough
whatev other mai think of them
elsewher i have told how year after our joint adventur into
central africa onc again i came into touch with the widow ladi
ragnal and allow myself to be persuad in her compani to inhal
the charm smoke of the taduki herb with which she becam familiar
when in a state of mental collaps she fell into the hand of the
priest of some strang african faith under it influenc the
curtain of time seem to swing asid and she and i saw ourselv
plai great part as inhabit of egypt in the dai of the persian
domin in that life if the tale were true we had been veri
intim but befor thi intimaci culmin in actual union the
curtain fell and we reawok to our modern world
next morn i went awai much confus and veri frighten nor did
i ever again set ey upon the state and beauti ladi ragnal
after all that we had learn or dream i felt that further meet
would be awkward also to tell the truth i did not like the stori of
the curs which wa said to hang over the man who had to do with her
who in it wa name amada and fill the role of priestess of isi
the goddess whom she betrai in whatev gener might be born
or perchanc reborn of cours such ancient maledict ar the
merest nonsens and yetwel the truth is that in our separ
fashion we ar all superstiti and realli the fate of lord
ragnal who had marri thi ladi wa most unpleas and
suggest too much so to encourag anyon els to follow hi
exampl further i had come to a time of life when i did not wish for
more adventur in which women were mix up even in dream sinc
such i have observ howev entranc at the moment lead to
troubl as sure as spark fly upward
thu it came about that when ladi ragnal wrote ask me to stai with
hera she did on two subsequ occasionsi put her off with
excus which were perfectli valid although at thi moment i forget
what thei mai have been it be my firm intent never again to
place myself within reach of her beauteou and command person
you see in that dream we dream togeth the stori came to an end
just as i wa about to marri the princess and high priestess amada
who wa or appear to be ladi ragnal prototyp inde on
regain her sens she whose vision last a second or two longer
than did mine let it slip that we actual had been marri in some
primit egyptian fashion and i could see clearli enough although i
knew it to be nonsens she believ that thi event had happen
now even when the scene wa laid a long while ago it is extrem
awkward to foregath with an imperi woman who is firmli convinc
that she wa onc your wife so awkward that in the end it might
have prove necessari to resum what she consid to be an
establish if an interrupt relationship
thi for sundri reason i wa determin not to do not the least of
them be that certainli i should have been set down as a fortun
hunter also as i have said there wa alwai the curs in the
background which i hope fondli would recogn my selfdeni and
not oper in my direct and yetalthough to think of it make me
feel cold down the backif perchanc that dream were true alreadi it
wa incur alreadi i allan the shabaka of former dai am doom
to die by violenc far from my own countri where first i had look
upon the sun as it term record in the papyru from kandahland
of which i read a translat at the castl provid with antiqu
direct and simplic as the lot of all and sundri who have ever
ventur to lai hand or lip upon the person of amada high priestess
of isi
to return in repli to my second letter of excus i receiv a quaint
littl epistl from the ladi to whom it had been written it ran thu
shabaka why do you seek to escap the net of fate when alreadi
you ar envelop in it mesh you think that never more seat
side by side shall we see the blue taduki smoke rise up toward
us or feel it subtl strength waft our soul afar
perhap thi is so though assuredli even here you ar doom to
acknowledg it dominion how often i do not know and will you
find it less to be fear alon than in my compani moreov from
that compani you never can escap sinc it ha been with you from
time immemori if not continu and will be with you when
there is no more sun
yet as it is your wish until we meet again in the past or in the
futur farewel o shabaka
amada
when i had finish read thi veri peculiar note of which the
envelop by the wai wa seal with the ancient egyptian ring that
my late friend lord ragnal had found and given to hi wife just
befor hi terribl fate overtook him liter i felt faint and lai
back in my chair to recov myself realli she wa an omin and in
her wai rather creepi woman on unlik all other on who seem to
be in touch with that which doubtless by intent is hidden from
mankind now it came back to me that when first i met her as the hon
luna holm and wa so interest in her at the ragnal castl dinner
parti befor her marriag i wa impress with thi omin qualiti
which seem to flow from her as had he been more sensit her
futur husband would have been also
dure our subsequ associ in africa too it had alwai been
with me and of cours it wa in full forc through our joint
experi with the taduki herb now again it flow up in me like
an unseal fountain and drown my judgment wash the order
reason on which i pride myself from it foundat also in thi
confus anoth truth emerg name that from the first moment i
set my ey on her i had alwai been attract by and in a kind of
hidden wai in love with her it wa not a violent and passion
sort of affect but then the same man can love sundri women in
differ wai all of which ar real enough
yet i knew that it wa perman for a littl while her phantasi
got a hold upon me and i began to believ that we alwai had been and
alwai should be mix up togeth also that in some undeclar
fashion i wa under deep oblig to her that she had stood my
friend not onc but often and so would stand while our person
continu to endur true she had been ragnal wife yetand thi
through no person vaniti sinc heaven know that thi vice is
lack in meof a sudden i becam convinc that it wa to me that
her natur realli turn and not to ragnal i did not seek it i did
not even hope that it wa so for sure she wa hi possess not
mine and i want to rob no man yet in that moment there the fact
loom befor me larg and solid as a mountain a calm immov
mountain a snowcap volcano appar extinct that still on
dai might break into flame and overwhelm me take me as it
possess upon wing of fire
such were my reflect dure the moment of weak which follow
the shock i had receiv from that remark letter outwardli and
visibl so final yet inwardli and spiritu open up vast avenu
of unexpect possibl present thei pass with the faint
and i wa my own man again whatev she might or might not be so far
as i wa concern there wa an end to my activ associ with
ladi ragnallat ani rate until i wa certain that she wa rid of her
store of taduki as she admit in her curious word
commun that book wa close for our live and ani
specul concern the past and the futur when we were not in
be remain so futil that about them it wa unnecessari to
troubl
a littl while later i read in a newspap under the head of
fashion intellig that ladi ragnal had left england to
spend the winter in egypt and know all her associ with that
countri i marvel at her courag what had taken her there i
wonder then shrug my shoulder and let the matter be
six week or so afterward i wa out shoot driven partridg a
covei came over me of which i got two as i thrust new cartridg
into my gun i saw approach me fly veri fast and high a coupl
of wild duck that i suppos had been disturb from some pond by the
distant beater i close the gun and lift it be particularli
anxiou to bag those wild duck which were somewhat rare in the
neighbourhood especi at that season of the year at that moment i
wa smitten by a most extraordinari seri of impress that had to
do with egypt and ladi ragnal the last thing i had been think of
a minut befor
i seem to see a desert and ruin that i knew to be those of a
templ and ladi ragnal herself seat among them hold up a
sunshad which suddenli fell onto the sand thi illus pass to
be follow by anoth name that she wa with me talk to me
veri earnestli but in a joy vigor voic onli in a languag of
which i could not understand on word yet the burden of her speech
seem to reach my mind it wa to the effect that now we should
alwai be near to each other as we had been in the past
then all wa gone nor can those impress have endur for long
see that when thei began i wa point my gun at the wild duck
and thei left me befor the dead bird touch the ground for
automat i went on with the busi at hand nor did my
accustom skill desert me
set down the fanci as onc of those queer mental prank that
cannot be explainedunless in thi instanc it wa due to someth
i had eaten at lunchi thought no more about it for two whole dai
then i thought a great deal for on open my newspap which
reach the grang about three oclock that is exactli fortyeight
hour after my telepath experi or whatev it mai have been
the first thing that my ey fell on among the foreign telegram wa
the follow from cairo
a messag ha been receiv here convei the sad intellig of
the sudden death yesterdai of ladi ragnal the widow of the late
lord ragnal who as a famou egyptologist wa veri well known
in egypt where he came to a tragic end some year ago ladi
ragnal who wa note for her wealth and beauti wa visit the
ruin of a templ of isi which stand a littl wai back from the
east bank of the nile between luxor and assouan where her husband
met with hi fatal accid while engag in it excav
inde she wa seat by the monument erect on the sand which
entomb him so deepli that hi bodi wa never recov when
suddenli she sank back and expir the english medic offic
from luxor certifi heart diseas as the caus of death and she
ha been buri where she di thi ground have been
consecr at the time of the deceas of lord ragnal
if i had felt queer when i receiv ladi ragnal mystic letter
befor she left for egypt now i felt much queerer then i wa
perplex now i wa terrifi and what is more greatli move
again that convict came to me that deep down in my be i wa
attach unchang attach to thi strang and charm woman
and that with her my destini wa intertwin if thi were not so
inde why had her pass becom known to me of all peopl and in
so incongru a fashion for although the hour of her death wa not
state i had littl doubt that it occur at the veri moment when i
shot the wild duck
now i wish that i had not refus to visit her and even that i had
given her some proof of my regard by ask her to marri me
notwithstand her great wealth the fact that i had been her
husband friend and all the rest no doubt she would have refus
still the quiet devot of even so humbl an individu as myself
might have pleas her howev regret came too late she wa dead
and all between us at an end
a few week later i discov that here i wa mistaken for after a
preliminari telegram inquir whether i wa in resid at the
grang which i answer on a prepaid form to the address of some
unknown lawyer in london there arriv at lunch time on the
follow dai a gentleman of the name of melli evid on of the
firm of melli melli who had sent me the telegram he wa shown in
and without wait for luncheon said
i believ i am address mr allan quatermain
i bow and he went on
i come upon a strang errand mr quatermain so strang that i doubt
whether in the cours of your life which as i have heard ha been
full of adventur you have ever known it equal you were i believ
well acquaint with our late client lord ragnal also with hi
wife ladi ragnal formerli the hon luna holm of whose recent sad
death you mai perhap have heard
i said that thi wa so and the lawyer went on in hi dry precis
wai watch my face as he spoke
it would appear mr quatermain that ladi ragnal must have been
much attach to you sinc a while ago after a visit that you paid
to her at ragnal castl she came to our offic and made a will a
thing i mai add that we had never been abl to persuad her to do
under that willa you will see present for i have brought a copi
with mesh left everyth she possess that is all the great
ragnal properti and accumul personalti of which she had the power
to dispos at her unfett discret toahemto you
great heaven i exclaim and sank back into a chair
as i do not sail under fals colour went on mr melli with a dry
smile i mai as well tell you at onc that both i and my partner
protest vehement against the execut of such a will for reason
that seem good to us but which i need not set out she remain firm
as a rock
you think i am mad she said forese thi i have taken the
precaut of visit two emin london specialist to whom i told
all my histori includ that of the mental obscur from which i
suffer for a while as the result of shock each of these examin me
carefulli and subject me to test with the resultbut here ar
their certif and you can judg for yourselv
i or rather we read the certif which of cours we have
preserv to be brief thei state that her ladyship wa of
absolut sound and normal mind although certain of her theori
might be thought unusu but not more so than those of thousand of
other some of them emin in variou walk of life in face of
these document which were entir endors by our own observ
there wa but on thing to do name to prepar the will in
accord with our client clear and definit instruct while we
were write these down she said suddenli
someth ha occur to me i shall never chang my mind nor
shall i remarri but from my knowledg of mr quatermain i think it
possibl and even probabl that he will refus thi great inherit
a statement sir which struck us as so incred that we made no
comment
in that event she continu i wish all the real properti to be
realiz and togeth with the personalti except certain legaci to
be divid among the societi institut and chariti that ar
written down upon thi list and she hand us a document unless
inde mr quatermain whom should he surviv me i leav my sole
executor should disapprov of ani of them
do you now understand the situat sir
quit i answer that is no doubt i shall when i have read the
will meanwhil i suggest that you must be hungri after your journei
and that we should have lunch
so we lunch talk of indiffer matter while the servant were
in the room and afterward return to my studi where the document
were read and expound to me by mr melli to cut the stori short
it seem that my inherit wa enorm i am afraid to state from
memori at what figur it wa provision valu subject to certain
reserv such as an inject that no part of the total either
in land or in monei wa to be alien in favour of mr atterbi
smith a rel of lord ragnal whom the testatrix held in great
dislik or ani member of hi famili and that for part of the year
i must inhabit ragnal castl which might not be sold dure my
lifetim or even let all thi vast fortun wa left at my absolut
dispos both dure my life and after my death failur to observ
these trust might it seem invalid the will in the event of my
renounc the inherit howev ragnal castl with a suitabl
endow wa to becom a counti hospit and the rest of the estat
wa to be divid in accord with the list that i have mentioneda
veri admir list but on which exclud ani societi or institut
of a sectarian natur
now i think that i have explain everyth said mr melli at
length except a minor and rather peculiar provis as to your
accept of certain relic particularli describ by the testatrix
in a seal letter which i will hand to you present so it onli
remain for me mr quatermain to ask you to sign a document which i
have alreadi prepar and brought with me to enabl me to deal with
these great matter on your behalf that is he ad with a bow
should you propos to continu that confid in our firm with which
the famili of the late lord ragnal ha honour it for sever
gener
while he wa hunt in hi bag for thi paper explain as he did
so that i must be prepar to face an action brought by mr atterbi
smith who had been rage round hi offic like a wild anim
suddenli i made up my mind
dont bother about that paper mr melli i said becaus ladi
ragnal wa right in her supposit i have no intent of accept
thi inherit the estat must go for divis to the chariti
etcetera set down in her list
the lawyer heard and stare at me
in my life he gasp at last i have known mad testat and mad
heir but never befor have i come across a case where both the
testat and the heir were mad perhap sir you will be pleas to
explain
with pleasur i said when i had finish light my pipe in the
first place i am alreadi what is call a rich man and i do not want
to be bother with more monei and properti
but mr quatermain he interrupt you have a son who with such
wealth behind him might rise to anythingy anyth thi wa
true for at that time my boi harri wa live
ye but as it chanc mr melli i have idea upon thi matter
which you mai think peculiar i do not wish my son to begin life with
enorm resourc or even the prospect of them i wish him to fight
hi own wai in the world he is go to be a doctor when he ha
succeed in hi profess and learn what it mean to earn on
own bread it will be time for him to come into other peopl monei
alreadi i have explain thi to him with refer to my own and
be a sensibl youth he agre with me
i daresai groan the lawyer suchwel failingsa your ar
often hereditari
anoth thing is i went on that i do not wish to be bother by a
lawsuit with mr atterbysmith further i cannot bind myself to live
half the year in ragnal castl in a kind of ducal state veri like
befor all is done i might want to return to africa which then i
could not do in short it come to thi i accept the executorship
and my outofpocket expens and shall ask your firm to act for me
in the matter the fortun i posit and final refus as you
observ ladi ragnal thought it probabl i should do
mr melli rose and look at the clock if you will allow me to
order the dogcart he said i think there is just time for me to
catch the afternoon train up to town meanwhil i propos to leav
you a copi of the will and of the other document to studi at your
leisur includ the seal letter which you have not yet read
perhap after take independ advic from your own solicitor and
friend you will write me your view in a few dai time until then
thi convers of our goe for noth i consid it entir
preliminari and without prejudic
the dogcart came roundinde it wa alreadi waitingand thu thi
remark interview end from the doorstep i watch the departur
of mr melli and saw him turn look at me and shake hi head
solemnli evid he thought that the right place for me wa a
lunat asylum
thank good that done with i said to myself now ill order
a trap and go and tell curti and good about all the busi no i
wont theyll onli think me mad as that lawyer doe and argu with
me ill take a walk and mark those oak that have to come down next
spring but first i had better put awai these paper
thu i reflect and began to collect the document lift the copi
of the will i saw ly beneath it the seal letter of which mr
melli had spoken address to me and mark
to be deliv after my death or in the event of mr quatermain
predeceas me to be burn unread
the sight of that wellknown write and the thought that she who
pen it wa now depart from the world and that nevermor would my
ey behold her move me i laid the letter down then took it up
again broke the seal seat myself and read as follow
my dear friend my dearest friend for so i mai call you know
as i do that if ever you see these word we shall no longer be
fellow citizen of the world thei ar true word becaus between
you and me there is a closer tie than you imagin at ani rate at
present you thought our egyptian vision to be a dreamno more i
believ it on the other hand at least in essenti to be a
record of fact that have happen in bygon ag moreov i
will tell you now that my revel went further than your own
shabaka and amada were marri and i saw them as man and wife
lead a host southward to found a new empir somewher in
central africa of which perchanc the kendah tribe were the last
remnant then the dark fell
moreov i am certain that thi wa not the first time that we
had been associ upon the earth as i am almost certain that it
will not be the last thi mysteri i cannot understand or explain
yet it is so in some of our manifold exist we have been
bound togeth by the bond of destini as in some we mai have
been bound to other and so i suppos it will continu to
happen perhap for ever and ever
now as i know that you hate long letter i will tell you why i
write i am go to make a will leav you practic
everyth i possesswhich is a great deal as there is no
relationship or other tie between us thi mai seem a strang
thing to do but after all why not i am alon in the world
without a rel of ani kind nor had my late husband ani except
some distant cousin those atterbysmith whom you mai rememb
and these he detest even more than i do which is sai much on
on point i am determinedthat thei shall never inherit and that
is why i make thi will in such a hurri have just receiv a
warn that my own life mai not be much prolong
now i do not deceiv myself i know you to be no moneyhunt and
i think it highli probabl that you will shrink from the
respons of thi fortun which if it came to you you
would feel it your duti to administ it for the good of mani to
the weari of your own flesh and spirit nor would you like the
gossip in which it would involv you or the worri of the action
atlaw which the atterbysmith and perhap other unknown would
certainli bring against you therefor it seem possibl that you
will refus my gift a conting for which i have provid by
altern deposit if a widow ladi without connect
choos to dispos of her good in chariti or for the advanc
of scienc etc no on can complain but even in thi event i
warn you that you will not altogeth escap sinc i am make
you my soul executor and although i have jot down a list of
the institut which i propos to benefit you will be given an
absolut discret concern them with power to vari the
amount and add to or lessen their number in return for thi
troubl should you yourself renounc the inherit i am
leav you an executor fee of 5000 pound which i beg that you
will not renounc as the mere thought of your do so offend me
also as a person gift i ask you to accept all that famou set
of carolin silver which wa us on grand occas at ragnal
that i rememb you admir so much and ani other object of art
that you mai choos
lastlyand thi is the realli import thingtogeth with the
egyptian collect i pass on to you the chest of taduki herb
with the kendah brazier etc enjoin you most strictli if
ever you held me in ani friendship to take it and abov all to
keep it sacr
in thi friend you will not fail me observ i do not direct
you to make further experi with the taduki to begin with
it is unnecessari sinc although you have recent refus to do
so in my companyperhap becaus you were afraid of complic
sooner or later you will certainli breath it by yourself
know that it would pleas me much and perhap when i am
dead hope that through it you mai see more of me than you did
when i wa aliv you know the dead often increas in valu at
compound interest and i am vain enough to hope that thi mai be
so in my case
i have no more to sai farewellfor a littl while
luna ragnal
ps you can burn thi letter if you like it doe not in the
least matter as you will never forget it content how
interest it will be to talk it over with you on dai
chapter ii
back to the past
it is unnecessari that i should set out the histori of the dispos of
the great ragnal fortun in ani detail i adher to my decis
which at last wa record with much formal though as i wa a
total unknown individu few took ani interest in the matter those
who came to hear of it for the most part set me down as mad inde i
could see that even my friend and neighbour sir henri curti and
captain good with whom i declin to discuss the busi more or
less share thi view while a societi journal of the lower sort
print a paragraph head
the hunter hermit ivori trader who mock at million
then follow a distort version of the fact also i receiv
anonym letter written i do not doubt by member of the atterbi
smith famili which set down my selfdeni to the work of a
guilti conscienc and to fear of exposur
of all these thing i took no heed and notwithstand wild threat
of action by mr atterbysmith in due cours the altern claus
of the will came into oper under which with onli a rough list
to guid me i found myself the practic dispens of vast sum then
inde i endur hard not onli had collieri and other
properti to be sold to the best advantag not onli wa i afflict
by constant interview with messr melli melli and troubl too
numer to mention in addit to these i think that everi societi
and chariti in the unit kingdom and quit eighti per cent of it
beggar must have written or sought interview with me to urg their
public or privat claim so that in the end i wa oblig to fly
awai and hide myself leav the lawyer to deal with the
correspond and the mendic
at length i complet my list allot the bulk of the monei to
learn societi especi such of them as dealt with archaeolog
matter in which the testatrix and her husband had been interest to
those who labour among the poor to the restor of an abbei in
which i had heard ladi ragnal express great interest and to the
endow of the castl as a local hospit in accord with her
wish
thi divis have been approv and ratifi by an order in court
my duti came to an end further my fee as executor wa paid me
which i took without scrupl for seldom ha monei been harder earn
and the magnific servic of ancient plate wa hand over to meor
rather to the custodi of my bankwith the result that i have never
set ey upon it from that dai to thi and probabl never shall
also i select certain souvenir includ a beauti portrait of
ladi ragnal by a note artist paint befor her marriag
concern which there wa a tragic stori whereof i have written
elsewher thi pictur i hung in my dine room where i can see it as
i sit at tabl so that never a dai pass that i do not think twice
or thrice of her whose young loveli it repres inde i think
of her so much that often i wish i had place it somewher els
the egyptian collect i gave to a museum which i will not name onli
the chest of taduki and the other articl connect with it i kept
as i wa bound to do hide them awai in a bookcas in my studi and
hope that i should forget where i had put them an effort wherein i
fail entir inde that chest might have been aliv to judg
from the persist with which it inflict itself upon my mind just
as if someon were imprison in the bookcas it wa stow awai in
the bottom part of an old chippendal bookcas which stood exactli
behind my write chair and which i had taken over as a fixtur when i
bought the grang now thi chair that i am us at the moment of
write is on of the sort that revolv and heedless of the work i
had to do continu i found myself turn it round so that i sat
stare at the bookcas instead of at my desk
thi went on for some dai until i began to wonder whether there wa
anyth wrong whether for instanc i had place the articl so
that thei could fall over and my subconsci self wa remind me of
the fact at length on even after dinner thi idea fidget me
so much that i could bear it no more go to my bedroom i open
the littl safe that stand there and took out the kei of the bookcas
which i had stow awai so that i could not get at it without some
troubl return i unlock the fade mahogani door of the
eighteenth centuri bookcas and wa surpris when it open itself
veri quickli as if someth were push at it
next moment i saw the reason my subconsci self had been right
ow i suppos to insuffici light when i put them awai i had
set the eboni tripod upon which rest the black stone bowl that
formerli wa us in the taduki ceremoni in the sanctuari of the
templ in kendahland whenc ladi ragnal had brought it so that on
of it feet project over the edg of the shelf thu it press
against the door and when it wa open of cours fell forward i
caught it rather smartli i flatter myself or rather i caught the
bowl which wa veri heavi and the tripod fell to the floor set
down the bowl on the hearthrug which wa near i pick up it stand
and made a hasti examin fear lest the brittl shortgrain
wood should have broken it had not it condit wa as perfect as
when it wa first us perhap thousand of year befor
next that i might examin thi curios with more care than i had
ever yet done i place the bowl upon it stand to consid it shape
and ornament though so massiv i saw that in it wai it wa a
beauti thing and the head of the women carv upon the handl
were so full of life that i think thei must have been model from a
live person perhap that model wa the priestess who had first us
it in her sacr rite of offer or of divin or perhap amada
herself to whom now that i thought of it the resembl wa great
as i had seen her in my taduki dream
the ey for both handl were ident seem fix on me in a
solemn and mystic stare the part lip look as though thei were
utter word of invit to what did thei invit ala i knew
too well it wa that i should burn taduki in the bowl so that thei
might be open by it magic and tell me of hidden thing
nonsens i thought to myself moreov i rememb that on must
never take taduki after drink wine then i rememb someth
els name that as it happen at dinner that night i had drunk
noth but water have for some reason or other prefer it to
claret or port also i had eaten preciou littlei suppos becaus i
wa not hungri or could it be that i wa a humbug and had done these
thing or rather left them undon so that should temptat overtak
me it result might not prove fatal upon my word i did not know
for on such occas it is difficult to disentangl the exact motiv
of the heart
moreov thi specul wa forgotten in a new and convinc idea
that suddenli i conceiv doubtless the virtu or the vice of
taduki were all humbug or rather nonexist what caus the
illus wa the magnet person of the ministr that is
to sai of ladi ragnal herself and on my first acquaint with it
here in england of that remark old medicin man harut without
these person and especi the first who wa now depart
from the earth it would be as harmless as tobacco and as ineffectu
as hai so delight wa i with thi discoveri that almost i
determin to prove it by immedi demonstr
i open the carv chest of richcolour wood and drew out the ag
blacken silver box within which now i observ for the first time
had engrav upon it sever time a pictur of the goddess isi in
her accustom ceremoni dress and a god osiri or ptah i think
make incant with their hand hold lotu flower and the
cross of life stretch out over a littl altar thi i open also
whereon a wellrememb aroma aros and for a moment cloud my
sens when these clear again i perceiv ly on the top of the
bundl of taduki leav of which there seem to be a larg
quantiti remain a half sheet of letter paper bear a few line
in ladi ragnal handwrit
i lift it and read as follow
my friend
when you ar move to inhal thi taduki as certainli you will
do be care not to us too much lest you should wander so far
that you can return no more on of the littl bundl of which i
think there ar thirteen remain in the box should be
suffici though perhap as you grow accustom to the drug you
mai requir a larger dose anoth thingfor a hidden reason with
which i will not troubl you it is desir though not
necessari that you should have a companion in the adventur by
prefer thi companion should be a woman but a man will serv
if he be on in whom you have confid and who is sympathet to
you
lr
that settl it i thought i am not go to take taduki with
on of the housemaid and there is no other woman about here and i
rose from my chair prepar to put the stuff awai
at that moment the door open and in walk captain good
hullo old fellow he said curti sai a farmer tell him that a
lot of snipe have come in onto the brathal marsh and he want to
know if you will come over tomorrow morn and have a go at themi
sai what is thi smell in the room have you taken to scent
cigarett or hashish
not quit but to tell you the truth i wa think of it i
answer and i point to the open silver box
good who is a person of alert mind and on veri full of curios
advanc snif at the taduki and examin the brazier and the
box which in hi ignor he suppos to be of grecian workmanship
final he overwhelm me with so mani question that at length in
selfdef i told him someth of it stori and how it had been
bequeath to me with it content by ladi ragnal
inde said good she who left you the fortun which you wouldnt
take be the lineal descend of don quixot or rather of sancho
panza donkei well thi is much more excit than monei what
happen to you when you went into that tranc
oh i answer wearili i seem to foregath with a veri pretti
ladi who live some thousand of year ago and after mani adventur
wa just about to marri her when i woke up
how jolli though i suppos you have been suffer from blight
affect ever sinc perhap if you took some more you might pull
it off next time
i shook my head and hand him the note of instruct that i had
found with the taduki which he read with attent and said
i see allan that a partner is requir and that fail a ladi a
man in whom you have confid and who is sympathet to you will
serv obvious that me for in whom could you have greater
confid and who is more sympathet to you well my boi if
there ani hope of adventur real or imaginari ill take the risk
and sacrific myself upon the altar of friendship light up your
stuffim readi what do you sai that i cant becaus i have been
dine and drink wine or whiski well as a matter of fact i
havent iv onli had some tea and a boil eggi wont stop to
explain whyand intend to rais someth more substanti out of
you so fire awai and let go to meet your love ladi in ancient
egypt or anywher els
look here good i explain i think there is a certain amount of
risk about thi stuff and realli you had better reflect
befor i rush in where angel fear to tread eh well youv done it
and you aint even an angel also i like risk or anyth that make
a chang in thi mill round of a life come on what have we got to
do
then feel that fate wa at work under a return of the impuls of
which the strength had been broken for a moment by the read of ladi
ragnal note of instruct i gave wai to tell the truth good
unexpect arriv when such a companion wa essenti and hi
strang willing and even desir to share in thi unusu
enterpris brought on on of the fit of fatal from which i suffer
at time i becam convinc that the whole busi wa arrang by
someth or somebodi beyond my kenthat i must take thi drug with
good as my companion so as i have said i gave wai and made the
necessari prepar explain everyth to good as i did so
i sai he said at last just as i wa fish for an ember from the
wood fire to lai upon the taduki in the bowl i thought thi job
wa a joke but you seem jolli solemn about it allan do you realli
think it danger
ye i do but more to the spirit than to the bodi i think to judg
from my own experi that anyon who ha onc breath taduki
will wish to do so again shall we give it up it isnt too late
no answer good i never funk anyth yet and i wont begin
now lai on macduff
so be it good but first of all listen to me move that armchair of
your close to mine but not quit up against it i am go to place
the brazier just between and a littl in front of us when the stuff
catch a blue flame will burn for about thirti secondsat least
thi happen on a previou occas so soon as it di awai and you
see the smoke begin to rise bend your head forward and a littl
sidewai so that it strike you full in the face but in such a
fashion that when you becom insens the weight of your bodi will
caus you to fall back into the chair not outward to the floor it is
quit easi if you ar care then open your mouth and draw the
vapour down into your lung two or three breath will suffic as it
work veri quickli
just like laugh ga remark good i onli hope i shant wake
with all my teeth out the last time i took it i felt
stop joke i said for thi is a seriou matter
a jolli sight too seriou is there anyth els
no that is if there is anybodi you particularli wish to see you
might concentr your thought on him
him i cant think of ani him unless it is the navig lieuten
of my first ship with whom i alwai want to have it out in the next
world as he is gone from thi the brute
on her then i meant her
then why didnt you sai so instead of indulg in pharisa
humbug who would breath poison just to meet anoth man
i would i repli firmli
that a lie mutter good hullo dont be in such a hurri with
that coal i aint readi ought i to sai ani hocuspocu dash it all
it is like a nightmar about be hang
no i repli as i drop the ember onto the taduki just as ladi
ragnal had done now plai fair good i ad for i dont know
what the effect of half a dose would be it might drive you mad look
the flame is burn open your mouth and arrang your weight as i
said and when your head begin to whirl lean back at the end of the
third deep breath
the mysteri billowi vapour aros as the pale blue flame di awai
and spread itself out fanwis
ay ay my hearti said good and thrust hi face into it with
such vigour that he brought hi head into violent contact with mine
as i leant forward from the other side
i heard him mutter some word that were better left unsaid for often
enough good languag would have born edit then i heard no more
and forgot that he exist
my mind becam wonderfulli clear and i found myself argu in a
fashion that would have done credit to the greatest of the greek
philosoph upon all sort of fundament problem all i can
rememb about that argument or lectur is that in part at ani rate
it dealt with the possibl of reincarn set out the pro
and con in a most vivid manner
even if i had not forgotten them these mai be pass over as thei
ar familiar to student of such subject the end of the exposit
howev wa to the effect that accept as it is by a quarter of the
inhabit of the earth thi doctrin should not lightli be set
asid see that in it there is hope for man that it is at least
worthi of consider if the sage who have preach it from plato
downand inde for countless ag befor hi time sinc without
doubt he borrow it from the eastar right then at least we pure
human creatur do not appear and die like gnat upon a summer ev
but in that seem dai pass on to life etern renew climb a
kind of jacob ladder to the ski
it is true that as our foot leav it each rung of that ladder
vanish below is dark and all the gulf of time abov is
dark and we know not what yet our hand cling to the upright and
our feet stand firm upon a rung and we know that we do not fall but
mount also that in the natur of thing a ladder must lean against
some support and lead somewher a melancholi busi thi tread
mill doctrin it mai be said where on rung is so like anoth and
there ar so mani of them and yet and yeti it not better than
that of the bubbl which burst and is gone ay becaus life is
better than death especi if it be progress life and if at
last it mai lead to some joi undream to some supern light in
which we shall see all the path that we have trodden and with it the
deep foundat of the rock of be upon which our ladder stand and
the gate of etern calm whereon it lean
thu in the begin of my dream state i the lectur argu to
an unknown audienc or perhap i wa the audienc and the lectur
argu to me i am not sure point out that otherwis we ar but as
those unhappi victim of the revolut in the prison of pari who
for a littl while bow and talk and plai our part wait till the
door open and the jailer death appear to lead us to the tumbril and
the knife
the argument i should point out wa pure ration it did not deal
with faith or ani reveal religion perhap becaus these ar too
person and too holi it dealt onli with the possibl develop of
a mighti law under the work of which man through much
tribul might accomplish hi own weal and at last come to look
upon the sourc of that law and understand it purpos
obvious these imperfectli report reflect and mani other that
i cannot rememb at all were induc by the feel that i might be
about to plung into some seem state of former exist as i had
done onc befor under the influenc of thi herb my late friend
ladi ragnal believ that state to be not seem but real while i
on the other hand could not accept thi as a fact i set it down as
i am still inclin to do to the work of imagin
superexcit by a strang and power drug and draw perhap from
some fount of knowledg of past event that is hidden deep in the
be of everi on of us
howev these thing mai be thi rhetor sum up of the case
of which i can onli recollect the last part wa but a kind of
introductori speech such as is sometim made by a master of
ceremoni befor the curtain rise upon the plai it echo di
awai into a deep silenc all the live part of me went down into
dark dens dark that seem to endur for ag then with
struggl and effort i awok againreborn a hand wa hold my
own lead me forward a voic i knew whisper in my ear sai
look upon on record of the past o doubter look and believ now
there happen to me or seem to happen that which i had
experienc befor in the museum at ragnal castl name that i
allan the live man of todai beheld myself anoth man and yet
the same and whilst remain myself could enter into and live the
life of that other man know hi thought appreci hi motiv
and hi effort hi hope and hi fear hi love and hi hate and
yet stand outsid of them read him like a book and weigh
everyth in the scale of my modern judgment
the voicesur it wa that of ladi ragnal though i could not see
her facedi awai the hand wa loos i saw a man in the cold
glimmer light of dawn he wa a veri sturdi man thicklimb
deepchest and somewhat hairi whose ag i judg to be about
thirti year i knew at onc that he wa not a modern man although
hi weathertan skin wa white where the fur he wore had slip
awai from hi shoulder for there wa someth unusu about hi
aspect few modern men ar so massiv of bodi and never have i seen
on with a neck so short and larg in circumfer although the feet
and hand were not larg hi frame wa extraordinarili solid be
not more than five feet seven inch in height and by no mean fat
yet he must have weigh quit fifteen stone if not more hi dark
hair wa long and part in the middl it hung down to hi shoulder
he turn hi head look behind him as though to make sure that he
wa alon or that no wild beast stalk him and i saw hi face the
forehead wa wide and not high for the hair grew low upon it hi
eyebrow were beetl and the ey beneath them deep set thei were
remark ey larg and grai quickglanc also yet when at rest
somewhat sombr and veri thought the nose wa straight with wide
and sensit nostril suggest that it owner us them as a dog
or a deer doe to scent with the mouth wa thicklip but not
larg and within it were splendid and regular white teeth broader
than those we have the chin wa veri massiv and on it grew two
littl tuft of beard though the cheek were bare
for the rest thi man wa long arm for the tip of hi middl
finger came down almost to the kneecap he had a sort of kilt about
hi middl and a heavi fur robe upon hi shoulder which look as
though it were made of bearskin in hi left hand he held a short
spear the blade of which seem to be fashion of chip flint or
some other hard and shine stone and in the girdl of hi kilt wa
thrust a woodenhandl instrument or ax made by set a great
sharpedg stone that must have weigh two pound or so into the
cleft end of the handl which wa lash with sinew both abov and
below the axhead
i allan the man of todai look upon thi mighti savag for
mighti i could see he wasboth in hi bodi and after a fashion in
hi mind alsoand in my tranc knew that the spirit which had dwelt
in him hundr of thousand of year ago mayhap or at least in the
far far past wa the same that anim me the live creatur
whose bodi for aught i knew descend from hi thu link us in
flesh as well as soul inde the thought came to mei know not
whencethat here stood my remot forefath whose forgotten exist
wa my caus of life without whom my bodi could not have been
now i allan quatermain fade from the stori no longer am i he i am
wi the hunter the futur chief of a littl tribe which had no name
sinc believ itself to be the onli peopl on the earth it need
none yet rememb that my modern intellig and individu never
went to sleep that alwai it wa abl to watch thi prototyp thi
primev on to enter into hi thought to appreci hi motiv
hope and fear and to compar them with those that actuat us
todai therefor the tale i tell is the substanc of that which the
heart of wi told to my heart set out in my own modern tongu and
interpret by my modern intellect
chapter iii
wi seek a sign
wi be alreadi endow with a spiritu sens wa prai to such
god as he knew the icegod that hi tribe had alwai worship he
did not know for how long it had worship them ani more than he
knew the begin of that tribe save for a legend that onc it
forefath had come here from behind the mountain driven sunward
and southward by the cold these god of their live in the blue
black ic of the mightiest of the glacier which move down from the
crest of the high snow mountain the breast of thi glacier wa in
the central vallei but most of the ic move down smaller vallei to
the east and west and so came to the sea where in springtim the
children of the icegod that had been begotten in the heart of the
snowi hill were born come forth in great berg from the dark womb
of the vallei and sail awai southward thu it wa that the vast
central glacier the hous of the god move but littl
urk the agedon who had seen the birth of all who live in the
tribe said that hi grandfath had told him when he wa littl
that in hi youth the face of thi glacier wa perhap a spear cast
higher up the vallei than it stood todai no more it wa a mighti
threaten face of the height of a score of tall forest pine set on
upon the other slope backward to it crest for the most part it
wa of clear black ic which sometim when the god within were
talk crack and groan and when thei were angri heav itself
forward by an arm length shave off the rock of the vallei which
stood in it path and drive them in front of it who or what these
god might be wi did not know all he knew wa that thei were
terribl power to be fear in whom he believ as hi forefath
had done and that in their hand lai the fate of the tribe
in the autumn night when the mist rose some had seen them vast
shadowi figur move about befor the face of the glacier and even
at time advanc toward the beach beneath where the peopl dwelt
thei had heard them laugh also and their priest ngae the
magician and taren the witchwhohidherself who onli came out at
night and who wa the lover of ngae said that thei had spoken to
them make revel but to wi thei had never spoken although he
had sat face to face with them at night which none other dare to
do so silent were thei that at time when he wa well fed and happi
heart and hi hunt had prosper he began to doubt thi tale of
the god and to set down the nois that were call their voic to
break in the ic caus by frost and thaw
yet there wa someth which he could not doubt deep in the face of
the ic the length of three pace awai onli to be seen in certain
light wa on of the god who for gener had been known to the
tribe as the sleeper becaus he never move wi could not make out
much about him save that he seem to have a long nose as thick as a
tree at it root and grow smaller toward the end on each side of
thi nose project a huge curl tusk that came out of a vast head
black in colour and cover with red hair behind which swell an
enorm bodi larg as that of a whale whereof the end could not be
seen
here inde wa a godnot even wi could doubt itfor none had ever
heard of or seen it likethough for what reason it chose to sleep
forev in the bosom of the ic he could not guess had such a monster
been known aliv he would have thought thi on dead not sleep
but it wa not known and therefor it must be a god so it came about
that for hi divin like the rest of the tribe wi took a gigant
eleph of the earli world caught in the ic of a glacial period that
had happen some hundr of thousand of year befor hi dai and
slowli born forward in the frozen stream from the faroff spot where
it had perish doubtless to find it ultim sepulchr in the sea
a strang god enough but not stranger than mani have chosen and still
bow befor todai
wi after debat with hi wife aaka the proud and fair had climb
to the glacier while it wa still dark to take counsel of the god and
learn their will as to a certain matter it wa thi the greatest man
of the tribe who by hi strength rule it wa henga a terribl man
born ten spring befor wi huge in bulk and feroci thi wa the
law of the tribe that the mightiest wa it master and so remain
until on mightier than he came to the open of the cave in which he
live challeng him to singl combat and kill him thu henga had
kill hi own father who rule befor him
now he oppress the tribe do no work himself he seiz the food
of other or the skin garment that thei made moreov although
there were few and all men fought for them he took the women from
their parent or husband kept them for a while then cast them out
or perhap kill them and took other nor might thei resist him
becaus he wa sacr and could do what he pleas onli as ha been
said ani man might challeng him to singl combat for to slai him
otherwis wa forbidden and would have caus the slayer to be driven
out to starv as on accurs then if the challeng prevail he
took the cave of thi sacr on with the women and all that wa hi
and becam chief in hi place until in hi turn he wa slain in like
fashion thu it came about that no chief of the tribe live to be
old for as soon as year began to rob him of hi might he wa kill
by someon younger and stronger who hate him for thi reason also
none desir to be chief know that if he were sooner or later he
would die in blood and it wa better to suffer oppress than to
die
yet wi desir it becaus of the cruelti of henga and hi misrul of
the tribe which he wa bring to miseri also he knew that if he
did not kill henga henga would kill him from jealousi long ago he
wi would have been murder had he not been belov by the tribe as
their great hunter who won them much of their meat food and therefor
a man whose death would caus the slayer to be hate yet fear to
attack him openli alreadi henga had tri to do awai with him
secretli and a littl while befor when wi wa visit hi pit
trap on the edg of the forest a spear whizz past him thrown from
a ledg of overhang rock which he could not climb he pick up the
spear and ran awai it wa on which he knew belong to henga
moreov it flint point had been soak in poison made from a kind
of cuttlefish that had rot mix with the juic of a certain herb
as wi could tell for sometim he us thi poison to kill game he
kept the spear and save to hi wife aaka said noth of the matter
then follow a wors thing besid hi son foh a lad of ten year
whom he love better than ani thing on earth he had a littl daughter
on year younger name foa thi wa all hi famili for children
were scarc among the tribe and most of those who were born di
quit young of cold lack of proper food and variou sick
moreov if girl mani of them were cast out at birth to starv or
be devour by wild beast
on even foa wa miss and it wa thought that wood wolv had
taken her or perhap the bear that live in the forest aaka wept
and wi when there wa no on to see wept also as he search for
foa whom he love two morn afterward when he came out of hi
hut near to the door place he found someth wrap in a skin and
on unwind it saw that it wa the bodi of littl foa with her neck
broken and the mark of a great hand upon her throat he knew well
that henga had done thi thing as did everybodi els sinc among the
tribe none murder except the chief though sometim men kill each
other fight for women of whom there were so few or when thei were
angri yet when he show the bodi to the peopl thei onli shook
their head and were silent for had not henga the right to take the
life of ani among them
then it wa that wi blood boil within him and he talk with aaka
sai that it wa in hi heart to challeng henga to fight
that is what he wish you to do answer aaka for be a fool
he think himself the stronger and that thu he will kill you without
reproach who otherwis when he is older will kill him also i have
wish it for long who am sure that you can conquer henga but you
will not listen to me in thi matter
then she roll herself up in her skin rug and pretend to go to
sleep sai no more
in the morn she spoke again and said
hearken wi counsel ha come to me in my sleep it seem to me that
foa our daughter who is dead stood befor me sai
let wi my father go up at night to make prayer to the icegod and
seek a sign from them if a stone fall from the crest of the glacier
at the dawn it shall be a token to him that he must fight henga and
aveng my blood upon him and take hi chieftainship but if no stone
fall then should he fight henga will kill him also afterward he
will kill foh my brother and take you my mother to be on of hi
wive
now wi i sai that you will do well to obei the voic of our child
who is dead and to go up to make prayer to the icegod and await
their omen
wi look at her doubtfulli put littl faith in thi tale and
answer
such a dream is a thin stick on which to lean i know well wife
that for a long while you have desir that i should fight henga
although he is a terribl man yet if i do he mai kill me and then
what would happen to you and foh
that which is fate to happen to us and noth els husband shall
it be said in the tribe that wi wa afraid to aveng the blood of hi
daughter upon henga
i know not wife but i know also that if such word ar whisper
thei will not be true it is of you and foh that i think not of
myself
then go and seek an omen from the icegod husband
i will go aaka but do not blame me afterward if thing happen
awri
thei will not happen awri answer aaka smile for the first time
sinc foa di
for she wa sure that wi would conquer henga if onli he could be
brought to fight him and thu aveng foa and becom chief in hi
place also she smile becaus for reason of which she did not
speak she wa sure also that a stone would fall from the crest of the
glacier at dawn when the sun struck upon the ic
thu it came about that on the follow night wi the hunter slip
from the villag of the tribe and walk round the foot of the hill
that ran down to the beach on the east scale the cleft between the
mountain until he came to the base of the great glacier the wolv
that were prowl round the place still winterhungri becaus the
spring wa so late scent him and surround him with glare ey
but he the hunter wa not afraid of the wolv moreov woe had
made hi heart fierc so with a yell he charg at the biggest of
them the leader of the pack and drove hi flint spear into it
throat then while it writh upon the spear gnash it red jaw
he dash out it brain with hi stone ax mutter
thu shall henga die thu shall henga die
the wolv knew their master and sped awai all save their leader that
lai dead wi drag it carcas to the top of a rock and left it
there where the rest could not reach it purpos to skin it in the
morn
thi done he went on up the cold vallei where no beast came becaus
here there wa noth to eat till he reach the face of the
glacier a mighti wall of backward slope ic that gleam faintli in
the moonlight and fill the cleft from side to side four hundr
pace or more in width when last he wa here twelv moon gone he
had driven a stake of driftwood between two rock and anoth stake
five pace lower down becaus of late it had seem to him that the
glacier wa march forward
so it wa inde for the first stake wa buri and the cruel
crawl lip of the glacier had nearli reach the second the god
were awak the god were match toward the sea
wi shiver not becaus of the cold to which he wa accustom but
from fearfor thi place wa terribl to him it wa the hous of the
god who dwelt there in the ic the god in whom he believ and who
were alwai angri and now he rememb that he had brought no
offer to propiti them he went back to the place where he had
kill the wolf and with difficulti by aid of hi sharp flint spear
and stone ax hack off it head return with thi head he set
the grisli thing upon a rock at the foot of the glacier mutter
it bleed and the god love blood now i swear that if i kill henga
i will give them hi carcass which is better than the head of a
wolf
then he knelt down as men have ever done befor that which thei fear
and worship and began to prai after hi rude fashion
o mighti on he said who have live here sinc the begin
and o sleeper with a shape such as no man ha ever seen wi throw out
hi spirit to you hear ye the prayer of wi and give him a sign henga
the fierc and hideou who kill hi own children lest in a dai to
come thei should slai him as he slew hi father rule the peopl and
doe evilli the peopl groan but accord to the old law mai not
rebel and to speak thei ar afraid henga would kill me and my
littl daughter foa he ha kill and her mother weep i wi would
fight henga as i mai do under the law but he is strong as the wild
bull of the forest and if he prevail not onli will he kill me he
will also take aaka whom he covet and will murder our son foh and
perhap devour him therefor i am afraid to fight for their sake
yet i would be reveng upon henga and slai him and live in the cave
and rule the peopl better not devour their food but store it
up for them not take the women but leav them to be the wive of
those who have none i have brought you an offer o god the head
of a wolf fresh slain which bleed the best thing i have to give
you and if i kill henga i will bring you a richer on that of hi
dead bodi becaus our father have alwai said that you love blood
wi paus for he could think of noth more to sai then

wai and fight him openli for the rule of the tribe or sinc if i
fear to do thi i cannot stai here among the peopl shall i fly awai
with aaka and foh and perhap pag the wise dwarf the wolfman who
love me to seek anoth home beyond the wood if we live to win
through them accept my offer and tell me o god if i must fight
henga let a stone fall from the crest of the glacier and if i must
fly to save the live of aaka and foh let no stone fall here now i

out that i am about to challeng him and in the night i shall slip
awai with aaka and foh and pag if he choos wherebi you will lose
worshipp o god
pleas with thi master argument which had come as an inspir
sinc he had never thought of it befor and sure that it would appeal
to god whose follow were few and who therefor could not afford to
lose ani of them wi ceas prai a terribl exercis which tire
him more than a whole dai hunt or fish and remain on hi
knee stare at the face of ic in front of him he knew noth of
the law of natur but he did know that heavi bodi if onc set in
motion move veri fast down a hill go quicker and quicker as thei
came near to it foot inde onc he had kill a bear by roll a
stone down on it which overtook the run beast with wonder
swift
thi be so he began to marvel what would happen if all that mighti
mass of ic should move in good earnest instead of at the rate of onli
a few handbreadth a year well he knew someth of that also for
onc when he wa in the wood he had seen an ic child born a vast
mass larg as a mountain which suddenli rush down on of the western
vallei into the sea send foam fly as high as heaven that had
hurt no on except perhap some of the seal peopl which were
bask in the bai becaus there wa no on to hurt but if it had
been the great central glacier that thu move and gave birth
togeth with the other smaller glacier of the west what would
chanc to the tribe upon the beach beneath thei would be kill
everi on and there would be no peopl left in the world
he did not call it the world of cours sinc he knew noth of the
world but rather by some word that meant the place that is the
few mile of beach and wood and mountain over which he wander from
a great height he had seen other beach and wood also mountain
beyond a rocki barren plain but to him these were but a dreamland
at least no men and women live in them becaus thei had never heard
their voic or seen the smoke of their fire such as the tribe made
to warm themselv by and for the cook of their food it wa true
that there were stori that such peopl exist and pag the cun
dwarf thought so howev wi be a man who dealt with fact paid
no heed to these tale there below him live the onli peopl in the
world and if thei were crush all would be finish
well if so it would not matter veri much except in the case of
aaka and abov all of foh hi son for of other women he thought
littl while the creatur that furnish food the seal and the
bird and the fish especi the salmon that came up the stream in
spring and the speckl trout would be happier if thei were gone
these specul also tire him a man of action who wa onli
begin to learn how to think so he gave them up as he had given
up prai and stare with hi big thought ey at the ic in
front of him the light wa gather now veri soon the sun should
rise and he should see into the ic look there were face grotesqu
face some of them vast some tini that seem to shift and chang
with the chang of the light and the plai of the shadow doubtless
these were those of the lesser god of whom probabl there were a
great number all of them bad and cruel and thei were peer and
mock at him
moreov beyond them a dim outlin wa the great sleeper as he had
alwai been a mountain of a god with huge tusk and the curl nose
much longer than the bodi of a man and a head like a rock and ear
as big as the side of a hut and a small cold ey that seem to be
fix upon him and behind all thi vanish into the depth of the
ic an enorm bodi the height of three men stand on each other
head perhap there wa a god inde and look at him wi
wonder whether on dai he would awak and break out of the ic and
come rush down the mountain that he might see him better wi rose
from hi knee and crept timidli to the face of the glacier to peer
down a certain crevic in the ic while he wa thu engag the sun
rose in a clear sky over the shoulder of the mountain and shone with
some warmth upon the glacier for the first time that springor rather
earli summer it rai penetr the cleft in the ic so that wi saw
more of the sleeper than he had ever done
truli he wa enorm and look behind him wa someth like the
figur of a man of which he had often heard but never befor seen so
clearli or wa it a shadow wi could not be sure for just then a
cloud float over the face of the sun and the figur vanish he
wait for the cloud to pass awai and well wa it for him that he did
so for just then a great rock which lai doubtless upon the extrem
lip of the glacier loosen from it last hold by the warmth of the
sun came thunder down the slope of the ic and leap over wi
fell upon the spot where he had just been stand make a hole in
the frozen ground and crush the wolf head to a pulp after which
with mighti bound it vanish toward the beach
the sleeper ha protect me said wi to himself as he turn to
look after the vanish rock had i stai where i wa i should
have been as that wolf head
then suddenli he rememb that thi stone had fallen in answer to
hi prayer that it wa the sign he had sought and remov himself
swiftli lest anoth that he had not sought should follow after it
when he had run a few pace down the frozen slope he came to a littl
bai hollow in the mountainsid and sat down know that there he
wa safe from fall stone confusedli he began to think what had
he ask the god wa it that he must fight henga if the stone fell
or that he must not fight him oh now he rememb it wa that he
must fight as aaka wish him to do and a cold trembl shook hi
limb to talk of fight that rage giant wa easi enough but to
do it wa anoth matter yet the god had spoken and he dare not
disobei the counsel that he had sought moreov by spare hi life
from the fall stone sure thei meant that he would conquer henga
or perhap thei onli meant that thei wish to see henga tear him to
piec for their sport for the god love blood and the god were
cruel moreov be evil themselv would it not perhap pleas
them to give victori to the evil man
as he could not answer these question wi rose and walk slowli
toward the beach reflect that probabl he had seen hi last of the
glacier and the icegod who dwelt therein he who wa about to
challeng henga to fight to the death present he drew near to the
place where he had kill the wolf and look up wa astonish to
see that someon wa skin the beast inde hi finger tighten
upon the haft of hi spear for thi wa a crime against the hunter
lawthat on should steal what anoth had slain then the head of
the skinner appear and wi smile and loosen hi grip of the
spear for thi wa no thief thi wa pag hi slave who love him
a strangelook man wa pag a largehead oneei dwarf great
chest longarm power but with thick littl leg no longer
than those of a child of eight year a monstrou flatnos big
mouth creatur who yet alwai wore upon hi scar counten a
smile humor air it wa told of pag that when he wa born a
long while beforefor hi youth had passedh wa so ugli that hi
mother had thrown him out into the wood fear that hi father who
wa absent kill seal farther up the beach would be angri with her
for bear such a son and purpos to tell him that the child had
been stillborn
as it chanc when the father came back he went to search for the
infant bone but in place of them found the babe still live but
with on ey dash out against a stone and it face much scar
still thi be hi firstborn and becaus he wa a man with a
merci heart he brought it home into the hut and forc the mother
to nurs it thi she did like on who is frighten though why she
wa frighten she would not sai nor would hi father ever tell where
and how he had found pag thu it came about that pag did not die but
live and becaus of what hi mother had done to him alwai wa a
hater of women on too who live much in the forest for which
reason or some other he wa name wolfman moreov he grew up
the cleverest of the tribe for natur which had made him ugli and
deform gave him more wit than the rest of them and a sharp tongu
that he us to gibe with at the women
therefor thei hate him also and made a plot against him and when
there came a time of scarciti persuad the chief of the tribe of
that dai the father of henga that pag wa the caus of illfortun
so that chief drove out pag to starv but when pag wa dy for lack
of food wi found him and brought him to hi hut where although like
the rest of her sex aaka love him littl he remain as a slave for
thi wa the law that if ani save a life that life belong to
him in truth howev pag wa more than a slave becaus from the
hour that wi brave the wrath of the women who thought that thei
were rid of pag and hi gibe and perchanc the anger of the chief
had rescu him when he wa starv in a season of bitter frost pag
love him more than a woman love her firstborn or a young man hi
onedai bride
thenceforward he wa wi shadow readi to suffer all thing for him
and even to refrain from sharp word and jest about aaka or ani other
woman upon whom wi look with favour though to do so he must bite a
hole in hi tongu so pag love wi and wi love pag for which reason
aaka who wa jealousheart came to hate him more than she had done
at first
there wa troubl about thi busi of the save of the life of pag
by wi after he had been driven out to starv as an evilei and
scurril fellow but the chief henga father a kindli natur
man when the matter came befor him said that sinc twice pag had
been thrown out and brought back again it wa evid that the god
meant him to die in some other fashion onli now that wi had taken
him wi must feed him and see that he hurt none if he chose to keep a
oneei wolf it wa hi own busi and that of no on els
shortli after thi henga kill hi father and becam chief in place
and the matter of pag wa forgotten so pag stai on with wi and wa
belov of him and by wi children but hate of aaka
chapter iv
the tribe
a good pelt said pag point to the wolf with hi red knife
for the spring be so late thi beast had not begun to shoot it
hair when i have brai it as i know how it will make a cloak for
foh he need on that is warm even in the summer for late he ha
been cough and spit
ye answer wi anxious it ha come upon him ever sinc he hid
in the cold water becaus the black bear with the great teeth wa
after him know that the beast hate water for which he ad
vicious i swear that i will kill that bear also he griev for
hi sister foa
ay wi snarl pag hi on ey flash with hate foh griev
aaka griev you griev and i pag the wolfman griev too oh
why did you make me come hunt with you that dai when my heart wa
against it and smell evil i wish to stop with foa whom aaka
let run off by herself just becaus i told her that she should keep
the girl at home
it wa the will of the god pag mutter wi turn hi head
awai
the god what god i sai it wa the will of a brute with two leg
nai of the greattooth tiger himself of which our forefath told
live in a man skin ye of henga help by aaka temper kill
that man tiger wi and never mind the great black bear or if you
cannot let me i know a woman who hate him becaus he ha put her
awai and made her serv anoth who ha her place and i can make good
poison veri good poison
nai it is not law said wi and would bring a curs upon us
but it is law that i should kill him and i will i have been
talk to the god about it
oh that is where the wolf head ha gonean offer i see and
what did the god sai to you wi
thei gave me a sign a stone fell from the brow of the ic as aaka
said that it would if i wa to fight henga it nearli hit me but i
had move closer to the ic to look at the sleeper the greatest of
the god
i dont believ it is a god wi i believ it is a beast of a sort we
do not know dead and frozen and that the shadow behind it is a man
that wa hunt the beast when thei both fell into the snow that
turn to ic
wi stare at him for thi inde wa a new idea
how can that be pag see that the sleeper and the shadow have
alwai been there for our grandfath knew them and there is no
such beast known also except us there ar no other men
ar you sure wi the place is big if you go to the top of that
hill you see other hill behind as far as the ey can look and
between them plain and wood also there is the sea and there mai
be beach beyond the sea why then should there not be other men
did the god make us alon would thei not make more to plai with and
to kill
wi shook hi head at these revolutionari argument and pag went on
as for the fall of the stone it often happen when the heat of
the sun melt the edg of the ic or make it swell and as for the
groan and call of the god doe not ic crack when the frost is
sharp or when there is no frost at all and it begin to move of it
own weight
ceas pag ceas said wi stuf hi finger into hi ear no
longer will i listen to such mad word if the god hear them thei
will kill us
if the peopl hear them thei mai kill us becaus thei walk in fear
of what thei cannot see and would save themselv at the cost of
other but for the godsthat and pag snap hi finger in the
direct of the glacier which after all is a veri ancient gestur
of contempt
wi wa so overcom that he sat down upon a stone unabl to answer
and that first of sceptic pag went on
if i must have a god who have found men quit bad enough to deal
with without on abov them more evil than thei i would choos the
sun the sun give life when the sun shine everyth grow and
the creatur mate and the bird lai egg and the seal come to bear
their young and the flower bloom when there is no sun onli frost and
snow then all these die or go awai and it is hard to live and the
wolv and bear raven and eat men if thei can catch them ye the
sun shall be my good god and the black frost my evil god
thu did pag propound a new religion which sinc then ha been veri
popular in the world next chang the subject rapidli as do
children and savag he ask
what of henga wi ar you go to challeng him to fight
ye said wi fierc thi veri dai
mai you be victori mai you kill him thu and thu and thu and
pag jab hi flint knife into the stomach of the dead wolf yet
he ad reflect it is a big busi there ha been no such
man as henga among our peopl that i have heard of although ngae
who call himself a magician is without doubt a cheat and a liar i
think he is right when he sai that henga mother made a mistak she
meant to have twin but thei got mix up togeth and henga came
instead otherwis why is he doublejoint why ha he two row of
teeth on behind the other and why is he twice the size of ani other
man and more than twice as wick still without doubt he is a man
and not what you call a god sinc he grow fat and heavi and hi hair
is begin to turn grai therefor he can be kill if anyon is
strong enough to break in that thick skull of hi i should like to
try poison on him but you sai that i must not well i will think the
matter over and we will talk again befor you fight meanwhil as
there mai be no chanc afterward when chatter women ar about give
me your command wi as to what is to be done if henga kill you i
suppos that you do not wish him to take aaka as he desir to do or
foh that he mai make a noth of him and keep him as a slave
i do not said wi
then pleas direct me to kill them or to see that thei kill
themselv never mind how
i do so direct you pag
good and what ar your wish as regard myself
i dont know answer wi wearili do what you will i thank you
and wish you well
you ar not kind to me wi although i am call the twicethrown
out and the wolfman and the hideou and the barbedtongu still
i have serv you well now when i ask you what i must do after you
ar dead and i have kill your famili you do not sai why follow
me of cours and look for me in the dark and if you find
noth it will be becaus there is noth to find as you would
have done did you love me no you sai do as you will what is it to
me still i shall come with foh and aaka although of cours i
must be a littl behind them becaus it will take time to fulfil your
order and afterward to do what is necessari to myself still wait
for me an hour even if aaka is angri as she will be
so you think you would find me somewher you who do not believ in
the god said wi stare at him with hi big melancholi ey
ye wi i think that though i dont know why i think it i think
that the lover alwai find the belov and that therefor you will
find foa and i shall find you also i think that if i am wrong it
doesnt matter for i shall never know that i wa wrong but as for
those god who dwell in the ic piff and again pag snap hi
finger in the direct of the glacier and went on with the skin
of the wolf
present thi wa finish and he threw the gori hide flesh side
down over hi broad shoulder to keep it stretch as he said for a
littl blood did not troubl him then without more talk the pair
walk down to the beach the squat misshapen pag waddl on hi
short leg after the burli swiftmov wi

as wi enter she threw a curiou search glanc at him as though
to read hi mind then smile in rather a forc fashion and drew
forward a block of wood inde there wa noth els for him to sit
on for furnitur even in it simplest form wa not known in the
tribe sometim a thick flat stone wa us as a tabl or a divid

upon the floor of the hut and cover with skin of on sort or

wi sat down on the log and aaka take on of the stick on which
wa spit a great lump of frizzl seal meat not too well cook

quantiti of spring water which aaka kept store in big shell and in
a stone her most valu possess hollow to the shape of a pot by
the action of ic or the constant grind of other stone at the
bottom of the sea thi he did becaus there wa noth els though
at certain time of the year aaka made a kind of tea by boil an

pin them togeth with a bone that pass through loop in the

what said the god ask aaka quickli did thei answer your
prayer
woman thei did at sunris a rock fell from the crest of the ic
field and crush my offer so that the ic took it to itself
what offer
the head of a wolf that i slew as i went up the vallei
aaka brood awhil then said
my heart tell me that the omen is good henga is that wolf and as
you slew the wolf so shall you slai henga did i hear that it hide
is to be a cloak for foh if so the omen is good also sinc on dai
the rule of henga shall descend to foh at least if you kill henga
foh shall live and not die as foa di
an express of joi spread over wi face as he listen
your word give me strength he said and now i go out to summon
the peopl and to tell them that i am about to challeng henga to
fight to the death
go she said and hear me my man fight you without fear for if
my rede be wrong and henga the mighti should kill you what of it
soon we die all of us for the most part slowli by hunger or
otherwis but death at the hand of henga will be swift and if you
die then we shall die soon veri soon pag will see to it and so we
shall be togeth again
togeth again togeth where wife he ask stare at her
curious
a kind of veil seem to fall over aaka face that is her
express chang entir for it grew blank and wooden secret
also like to the face of all her sister of the tribe
i dont know she answer roughli togeth in the light or
togeth in the dark or togeth with the icegodswho can tell at
least togeth somewher you shake your head you have been talk
to that hater of the god and changel pag who realli is a wolf
not a man and hunt with the wolv at night which is why he is
alwai so fat in winter when other starv
here wi laugh incredul sai
if so he is a wolf that love us i would that we had more such
wolv
oh you mock as all men do but we women see further and we ar
sure that pag is a wolf by night if a dwarf by dai for if ani try
to injur him ar thei not taken by wolv did not wolv eat hi
father and were not the leader of those women who caus him to be
driven forth to starv when there wa such scarciti that even the
wolv fled far awai afterward taken by wolv thei or their
children
then as though she thought she had said too much aaka ad
yet all thi mai be but a tale spread from mouth to mouth becaus we
women hate pag who mock us at least he believ in naught and would
teach you to do the same and alreadi you begin to walk in hi
footstep yet if you hold that we live no more after our breath
leav us tell me on thing why when you buri foa yonder did
you set with her in the hole her necklac of shell and the stone ball
that she plai with and the tame bird she had after you kill it
and her winter cloak and the doll you made for her of pinewood last
year of what good would these thing be to her bone wa it not
becaus you thought that thei and the littl stone ax might be of us
to her elsewher as the dri fish and the water might serv to feed
her
here she ceas and stare at him
sorrow make you mad said wi veri gentli for he wa move by her
word as it make me mad but in anoth fashion for the rest i do
not know why i did thu perhap it wa becaus i wish to see those
thing no more perhap becaus it is a custom to buri with the dead
what thei love when thei were aliv
then he turn and left the hut aaka watch him go mutter to
herself
he is right i am mad with grief for foa and with fear for foh for
it is the children that we women love ye more than the man who
begat them and if i thought that i should never find her again then
i would die at onc and have done meanwhil i live on to see wi dash
out the brain of henga or if he is kill to help pag poison him
thei sai that pag is a wolf but though i hate him of whom wi think
too much what care i whether he be wolf or monster at least he love
wi and our children and will help me to be reveng on henga
present she heard the wildbul horn that serv the tribe as a
trumpet be blown and knew that winiwini he who wa call the
shudder becaus he shook like a jellyfish even if not frighten
which wa seldom wa summon the peopl that thei might talk
togeth or hear new guess what that new would be aaka threw
her skin cloak about her and follow the sound of the horn to the
place of assembl
here on a flat piec of ground at a distanc from the hut that lai
about two hundr pace from a clifflik spur of the mountain all
the peopl men women and children except a few who were in
childb or too sick or old to move were gather togeth as thei
walk or ran thei chatter excitedli delight that someth wa
happen to break the terribl sad of their live now and again
point toward the mouth of the great cave that appear in the stone
cliff opposit to the meet place in thi cave dwelt henga for by
right from time immemori it wa the home of the chief of the
tribe which none might enter save by permiss a sacr place like
to the palac of modern time
aaka walk on feel that she wa be watch by the other but
take no heed for she knew the reason she wa wi woman and the
rumour had run round that wi the strong wi the great hunter wi whose
littl daughter had been murder wa about to do someth strang
though what it might be none wa sure all of them long to ask aaka
but there wa someth in her ey which forbad them for she wa
cold and state and thei fear her a littl so she went on
unmolest look for foh of whom present she caught sight
walk in the compani of pag who still had the reek wolfskin on
hi shoulder of which as he wa short the tail drag along the
ground she note that as he advanc the peopl made wai for him
not from rever or love but becaus thei fear him and hi evil
ey
look said on woman to anoth in hear there goe he who hate
us the speartongu dwarf
ay answer the other he is in such hast that he ha forgotten
to take off the wolf hide he hunt in last night have you heard
that buk wife ha lost her littl child of three it is said that
the bear took it but perhap yonder wolfman know better
yet foh doe not fear him look he hold hi hand and laugh
no becaus here suddenli the woman caught sight of aaka and wa
silent
i wonder reflect aaka whether we women hate pag becaus he is
ugli and hate us or becaus he is clever than we ar and pierc
us with hi tongu i wonder also why thei all think he is half a
wolf i suppos it is becaus he hunt with wi for how can he be both
a man and a wolf at least i too believ that report speak truth and
that he and the wolv have deal togeth or perhap he put the
tale about that all mai fear him
she came to the meet ground and took her stand near to foh and pag
among the crowd which stood or sat in a ring about an open space of
empti ground where sometim the tribe danc when thei had plenti of
food and the weather wa warm or took counsel or watch the young
men fight and wrestl for the prize of a girl thei covet
at the head of the ring which wa oblong in shape rather than round
stand about winiwini the shudder who from time to time still
blew blast upon hi horn were some of the leader of the tribe
among them old turi the avarici the hoarder of food who wa alwai
fat whoever grew thin and pitok the unlucki with whom everyth
went wrong whose fish alwai turn rotten whose women desert him
whose children di and whose net wa sure to break so that he must
be support by other for fear lest he should die and pass on hi
illluck to them who neglect him and whaka the birdofillomen
the leanfac on who wa alwai howl of misfortun to come and
hou the unstabl a feather blown by the wind who wa never of the
same mind two dai togeth and rahi the rich who trade in stone
ax and fish hook and thu live well without work and hotoa the
greatbelli and slowspeech who never gave hi word as to a
matter until he knew how it wa settl and then shout it loudli
and look wise and taren shewhohid with ngae the priest of the
icegod and the magician who told fortun with shell and onli came
out when there wa evil in the wind
lastli there wa moananga wi younger brother the brave the great
fighter who had fought six men to win and keep tana the sweet and
love the fairest woman of the tribe and kill two of them who
strove to steal her by forc he wa a roundei man with a laugh
face quick to anger but goodtemp and after wi the hunter he
who stood first among the peopl moreov he love wi and clung to
him so that the two were as on for which reason henga the chief
hate them both and thought that thei were too strong for him
all these were talk with their head close togeth till present
appear wi straight strong and stern at whose come thei grew
silent he look round at them then said
i have word
we ar listen repli moananga
hearken went on wi is there not a law that ani man of the tribe
mai challeng the chief of the tribe to fight and if he can kill him
mai take hi place
there is such a law said urk the old wizard he who made charm
for women and brew love potion and in winter told stori of what
had happen long ago befor hi grandfath grandfath wa born
veri strang stori some of them twice it ha chanc in my dai
the second time when henga challeng and kill hi own father and
took the cave
ye ad whaka the birdofillomen but if he who challeng is
defeat not onli is he kill hi famili is kill alsoher he
glanc at aaka and fohand perhap hi friend or brotherher he
look at moananga ye without doubt that is the law the cave onli
belong to the chief while he can defend it with hi hand if anoth
rise who is stronger than he he mai take the cave and the women
also the children if there ar ani and kill them or make them slave
until hi strength begin to fail him and he in turn is kill by some
mightier man
i know it said wi hearken again henga ha done me wrong he
stole and murder my daughter foa therefor i would kill him also
he rule the tribe cruelli no man wife or daughter or robe or food
is safe from him hi wicked make the god angri why is it that
the summer have turn cold and the spring doe not come i sai it is
becaus of the wicked of henga therefor i would kill him and
take the cave and rule well and gentli so that everi man mai have
plenti of food in hi hut and sleep safe at night what sai you
now winiwini the shudder spoke shake in all hi limb
we sai that you must do what you will wi but that we will not mix
with the matter if we mix when you ar kill as you will befor
henga is mightier than youy he is the tiger he is the bull of
the wood he is the roar bearthen he will kill us also do what
you will but do it alon we turn our back on you we put our hand
befor our ey and see noth
pag spat upon the ground and said in hi low growl voic that
seem to come out of hi stomach
i think that you will see someth on night when the star ar
shine i think winiwini that on night you will meet that which
will make you shudder yourself to piec
it is the wolfman exclaim winiwini protect me why should the
wolfman threaten me when we ar gather to talk
nobodi answer becaus if some were afraid of pag all down to the
most miser slavewoman despis winiwini
take no heed of hi word brother said moananga the happyfac
i will go up with you to the cavemouth when you challeng henga and
so i think will mani other to be wit of the challeng
accord to the custom of our father let those stop behind who
will you will know what to think of them when you ar chief and sit
in the cave
it is well said wi let us go at onc
chapter v
the ax that pag made
thi matter be settl there follow a jabber of argument as to
the method of convei the challeng of wi to henga the chief urk
the ag wa consult as to preced and made a long speech in
which he contradict himself sever time hou the unstabl sprang
up at length and said that he wa not afraid and would be the leader
suddenli howev he chang hi mind declar he rememb that
thi offic by right belong to winiwini the hornblow who must
sound three blast at the mouth of the cave to summon the chief to
thi all assent with a shout perhap becaus there wa a sens of
humour even in their primit mind and protest as he would wini
wini wa thrust forward with hi horn
then the process start winiwini go first follow close
behind by pag in the bleed wolfskin who from time to time
prick him in the back with hi sharp flint knife to keep him
straight next came wi himself with hi brother moananga and after
these the elder and the rest of the peopl
at least thei start thu to cover the three hundr pace or so
which lai between them and the cliff but befor thei reach the
cave most of them lag behind so that thei were dot in a long
line reach from the meet place to it entranc
inde here remain onli winiwini who could not escap from pag
wi moananga and at a littl distanc behind whaka the birdofil
omen prophesi evil in a ceaseless stream of word at hi side
too wa aaka walk boldli and look down at hi wither shape
with scorn of the remaind the bravest drawn by curios kept
within hear but the rest stai at a distanc or hid themselv
blow growl pag to winiwini and as he still hesit prick
him in the back with hi knife
then winiwini blew a quaver blast
blow again louder said pag
winiwini set the horn to hi lip but befor a sound came out of it
a larg stone hurl from the cave struck him in the middl and down
he went writh and gasp
now you have someth to shake for said pag as he waddl to on
side lest anoth stone should follow
none came but out of the cave with a roar rush a huge hairi
blackbrow fellow wave a great wooden clubhenga himself he wa
a mighti thick limb man of about forti year of ag with a chest
like a bull a big head from which long black hair fell upon hi
shoulder and a wide thicklip mouth whenc project yellow
tusklik teeth from hi shoulder in token of hi rank hung the
hide of a cave tiger and round hi neck wa a collar made from it
claw and teeth
who send that dog to waken me from my rest he shout in hi
bellow voic and point with the club to winiwini twist on
the ground
i do answer wi i and all the peopl i wi whose child you
murder come to challeng you the chief to fight me for the rule
of the tribe as you must do accord to the law in the presenc of
the tribe
henga ceas from hi shout and glare at him
is it so he ask in a quiet voic that had in it a hiss of hate
know that i hope that you would come on thi errand and that is why
i kill your brat to give you courag as i will kill the other that
remain to you and he glanc at the boi foh who stood at a
distanc you have troubl me for long wi with your talk and
threat against me of which i am hungri to make an end now tell me
when doe it pleas the peopl to see me break your bone
when the sun is within an hour of it set henga for i have a
fanci to sleep in the cave tonight as chief of the peopl answer
wi quietli
henga glower at him gnaw at hi lip then said
so be it dog i shall be readi at the meet place an hour befor
the sun set for the rest it is aaka who will sleep in the cave
tonight not you who i think will sleep in the belli of the wolv
now begon for a salmon ha been sent to me the first of the year
and i who love salmon would cook and eat it
then aaka spoke sai
eat well devilman who murder children for i the mother tell you
that it shall be your last meal
laugh hoars henga went back into the cave and wi and all the
other slip awai
who gave henga the salmon ask moananga idli as on who would sai
someth
i did answer pag who wa walk besid him but out of earshot
of wi i caught it last night in a net and sent it to him or rather
caus it to be laid on a stone by the mouth of the cave
what for ask moananga
becaus henga is greedi over salmon especi the first of the
year he will eat the whole fish and be heavi when it come to
fight
that is clever i should never have thought of that said moananga
but how did you know that wi wa go to challeng henga
i did not know nor did wi yet i guess it becaus aaka sent him to
consult the god when a woman send a man to seek a sign from the
god that sign will alwai be the on she wish so at least she
will tell him and he will believ
that is clever still said moananga stare at the dwarf with hi
round ey but why doe aaka wish wi to fight henga
for two reason first becaus she would reveng the kill of her
child and second becaus she think that wi is the better man and
that present she will be the wife of the chief of the tribe still
she is not sure about thi becaus she ha made a plan should wi be
defeat that i must kill her and foh at onc which i shall do
befor i kill myself or perhap i shall not kill myself at ani rate
until i have tri to kill henga
would you then be chief of the tribe wolfman ask moananga
astonish
perhap for a littl while for do not those who have been spat upon
and revil alwai wish to rule the spitter and the revil yet i
will tell who ar wi brother and love him that if he di i who
love him better and love no on els save perhap foh becaus he is
hi son shall not live long after him no then i should pass on the
chieftainship to you moananga and be seen no more though perhap in
the after year you might hear me at night howl round the hut in
winterwith the wolv moananga to which fool sai i belong
moananga stare again at thi sinist dwarf whose talk frighten
him then that he might talk of someth els ask him
which of these two do you think will conquer pag
pag stop and point to the sea at some distanc from the shore a
mighti struggl wa in progress between a thresher shark and a whale
the terribl shark had driven the whale into shallow water where it
flounder unabl to escap by sound now the sea wolf as it is
call wa leap high into the air and each time as it fell it
smote the whale upon the head with it aw swordlik tail blow
upon blow that echo far and wide the whale roll in agoni beat
the water to a foam with it giant fluke but for all it size and
bulk could do noth present it began to gasp and open it
great mouth whereon the thrasher dart between it jaw seiz
it tongu and tore it out then the whale roll over and began to
bleed to death
look said pag there is henga the huge and mighti and there is wi
the nimbl and wi win the dai and will feed hi fill upon whale
flesh he and hi friend that is my answer and the omen is veri
good now i go to make wi readi for thi battl
when pag reach the hut he sent aaka and foh out of it leav
himself alon with wi then caus wi to strip off hi cloak he
made him lie down and rub him all over with seal oil also with a
sharp flint and a shell ground to a fine edg slowli and painfulli he
cut is hair short so short that it could give no hold to henga
hand and thi done greas what remain of it with the seal oil
next he bade wi sleep awhil and left the hut take with him wi
stone ax also hi spear that with which he had kill the wolf and
hi flint knife that wa haft with two flat piec of ivori rub
down from a walru tusk and lash onto the end of the flint
outsid the hut he met aaka who wa wander to and fro in an ill
humour she made as though she would pass him set her face toward
the hut
nai said pag you do not enter
why not she ask
becaus wi rest and must not be disturb
so a misshapen monster a wolfman hate of all who live on bounti
mai enter my husband hut when i the wife mai not she said
furious
ye for present he goe upon a man busi name to kill hi
enemi or be kill of him and it is best that no woman should come
near to him till the thing is end
you sai that becaus you hate women who will not look on you pag
i sai it becaus women take awai the strength of men and suck out
their courag and disturb them with weak word
she leapt to on side as though to rush past him but pag leapt also
lift the spear in hi hand whereon she stop for she fear the
dwarf
listen he said you do ill to reproach me aaka who am your best
friend still i do not blame you overmuch for i know the reason of
your hate you ar jealou of me becaus wi love me more than he doe
you as doe foh if in anoth fashion
love you you abort you hideou on she gasp
ye aaka who it seem do not know that there ar differ sort
of love that of the man for the woman which come and goe and that
of man for man which chang not i sai that you ar jealou onli
thi dai i told wi that if he had not taken me with him hunt but
had left me to watch foa she would not have been stolen and kill
by yonder cave dweller it wa a lie i could have refus to go
hunt with wi and he would have let me be who know that alwai i
have a reason for what i do i went with him becaus of word which
you had spoken which you will rememb well i told you that foa wa
in danger from henga the cavedwel and that i had best watch her
and you said that no girl child of your should be watch by a wolf
cub and that you would take care of her yourself which you did not
do therefor becaus you goad me i went hunt and foa wa
taken and kill
now aaka hung her head answer noth for she knew that hi word
were true
let that be went on pag the dead ar dead and well dead
perchanc now although i speak wise to you you would thwart me
again and go in to awaken wi even when i tell you that to do so mai
turn the fight against him and bring about your death and foh as
well
doe wi sleep ask aaka weaken a littl
i think he sleep becaus i bade him and in such matter he obei
me also last night he slept littl but the road is open and i have
said my sai go and look for yourself go wake him up and ask if he is
asleep and wear him out with your woman talk and tell him what
dream have come to you about foa and the god and thu make him
readi to fight the devil giant henga
i go not she said stamp her foot lest if wi fall your
poison tongu should put it about that i wa the caus of hi death
but know misshapen outcast wolfman that should he conquer and
live he must choos between you and me for if he take you to dwell
with him in the cave then i stai here in the hut
pag laugh deep down in hi throat after hi fashion and answer
that would be peac inde were it not as i rememb that if
henga di he leav behind him sundri fair women who also live in
the cave and doubtless will be hard to dislodg still in thi
matter as in all other do what you will onli i tell you aaka
that you do ill to revil me whom you mai need present to help you
out of the world
then ceas from hi mockeri and the roll of hi great head from
side to side as wa hi habit when he mock he look her in the
face with hi on bright ey with which folk said he could see in the
dark like a wildcat and said quietli
why do you reproach me becaus i am hideou did i make my own shape
or wa it the gift of a woman did i throw awai my right ey or did a
woman dash it out against a stone afterward did i leav the camp to
starv in the winter or did women drive me out becaus i told them
the truth why ar you angri with me becaus i love wi who save me
from the cruelti of women and your son foh whom wi caus to be why
will you not understand that although i be misshapen yet i have more
wisdom than all the rest of you and a larger heart and that the
wisdom and the heart ar the servant of wi and those with whom he ha
to do why should you be jealou of me
would you know pag becaus you speak truth becaus you ar more to
wi than i amy and to foh also when on come whom wi love
better than he doe you then we mai be friend again but not
befor
that mai happen said pag reflect now troubl me no more who
go to make readi wi weapon for thi fight and who have no time to
wast go now to the hut as i have said the wai is open and tell
your own tale to wi
aaka hesit then she said
nai i come to help you with the weapon for my finger ar defter
than your let there be peac between us for an hour or gibe on if
you will and i will not answer
again pag laugh hi great laugh sai
women ar strang so strang that even i cannot weigh or measur
them come on come on the edg of the spear and ax need rub
and the lash ar worn
for a while did pag and aaka with the lad foh to help them fetch
and carri or hold hide strip labour at the simpl weapon of
wi point the spear and grind the edg of the ax when thi ax
wa as sharp as thei could make it pag weigh the thing in hi hand
and cast it down with a curs
it is too light he said what chanc ha thi toi against the club
of henga
then he rose and ran to hi hovel at the back of the hut whenc he
return bear in hi hand a glitter lump fashion to the shape
of an ax
see here he said thi is not much larger yet it ha thrice the
weight i found it on the mountainsid on of mani shatter
fragment and last winter work by the light of seal oil i
fashion it
aaka took it in her hand which it bore to the ground so heavi wa
it then she felt it edg which wa sharper than that of newflak
flint and ask what it wa
i dont know answer pag outsid it look like stone that ha
been in hot fire but see within it shine also it is so hard that
i could onli work it with anoth piec of the same stone hammer
it after it had lain in fire until it turn red and polish it
with fine sand and water
here it mai be state that although he knew it not thi substanc
wa meteor iron that had fallen from heaven and that pag by the
light of natur had becom on of the first of blacksmith when
find that he could not touch it otherwis becaus of it hard
he thrust that lump into a hot fire till it turn red and beat it
upon a stone with anoth lump he learn the us of iron and took
on of mankind first and greatest step forward
it will not break said aaka doubtfulli
no answer pag i have tri the blow that shatter the best
stone ax leav it unmark it will not break but that which it hit
will break i made it for myself but wi shall have it now help me
then he produc the handl that like the blade wa of a new sort
be fashion with infinit patienc and labour from the solid lower
leg bone of a gigant deer that he had found blacken and half
fossil when dig in a bog by the bank of a stream to make a
waterhol doubtless that of the nobl creatur that is now known as
cervu giganteu or the irish deer which onc roam the wood of
the earli world have cut off a suitabl length of thi bone he had
made a deep slot divid the end in two to receiv the neck of the
ax which it exactli fit project two inch or so abov thi
neck now with wonder skill help by the other he set to work
and with sinew and strip of damp hide cut from the skin of
reindeer he lash haft and blade togeth knot the end of the
strip again and again then have heat fossil gum or amber of
which there wa plenti to be found on the shore in a shell till it
melt he pour the resin over and between the hide strip and as
it cool rub it smooth with a piec of stone thi done he
plung the finish ax into icecold water for a while till the
resin wa quit solid after which he held it in the smoke of the fire
that burn near by to dry and shrink the hide strip by heat lastli
in case the first should have crack he pour on more resin cool
it with a hand of snow dri it in the smoke and polish it
at length all wa finish and with pride swell in hi heart pag
held up the weapon sai
behold the finest ax the tribe ha ever seen
the bone will not shatter ask aaka the doubt
nai he answer as he rub the smokedul resin i have test
it as i test the blade no man and no shock can break it moreov
see to make sure i have lash it about with hide at everi thumb
length now let me go and wake wi and arm him
still polish the ax and it handl with a piec of skin as he went
pag enter the hut veri quietli leav aaka without wi slept on
like a child pag laid the ax upon the skin cover of hi bed and
go to the head of the hut hid himself in the shadow then he
scrape with hi foot on the floor and wi woke the first thing hi
ey fell on wa thi ax he sat up lift the ax and began to
examin it with eager ey when he had note all it wonderfor to
him it wa a most marvel thing made of a glitter stone such as
he had never seen that wa thrice heavier than ani stone haft with
black bone as hard as walru ivori with a knob at the end of it
fashion by rub down the knuckl joint to save it from slip
through the hand lash about here and there with neatli finish
strip of hide doubleedg and sharper than a flint flake balanc
in the grasp alsooh sure he dream and thi wa such a weapon as
the god must us when thei fought togeth in the bowel of the ic
pag waddl forward out of the shadow sai
time to aris wi but tell me first how do you like your new ax
sure the god made it gasp wi with it i could kill a white
bear singlehand
ye the god made it it is a gift to you from the god how thei
sent it i will tell you afterwardthat with it you mai kill not the
white brute that prowl in the dark but a fiercer beast who
raven by dai as well as by night i tell you wi that thi is the ax
of victori hold it you cannot be conquer hearken to me wi
henga will rush at you with hi great club leap to on side and smite
with all your strength at hi hand if the blow from thi ax fall
upon them or upon the handl of the club where he grasp it thei or
it will be shorn through then if hi hand remain he will rush at
you again strive to seiz you and crush you in hi grip or to
break your back or neck if you have time smite at hi leg or knee
cut the tendon or crippl him should he still get a hold of
you do your best to slip from hi grasp as be greas perhap you
mai and befor he can catch you again hew at hi neck or head or
backbon as chanc mai offer for thi ax will not onli bruis it

wrist thu and it will not come off nai to make sure i will tie it
there with a deer sinew hold out your hand
wi obei and while veri deftli pag made the thong fast with the
sinew answer
i understand though whether i shall be abl to do all or ani of
these thing i do not know still it is a wondrou ax and i will try
to us it well
then pag rub more oil all over wi look onc more at the ax to
make sure that the damp thong had dri and shrunk tight upon the
haft in the warmth of the fire and that the amber resin had set hard
and have given wi a piec of dri fish soak in seal oil to eat
and a littl drink of water threw a skin cloak over hi shoulder and
led him from the hut
aaka wa wait outsid and with her wi brother moananga she
stare at wi and ask
who ha cut off my man hair
i have answer pag for a good reason
she stamp her foot sai coldli
how dare you touch hi hair which i love to see him wear long i
hate you for it
sinc you ar mind to pick a quarrel with me why not hate me for
thi as well as for anyth els yet aaka you mai have caus to
thank me for it in the end though if so it will onli make you hate
me more
that cannot be said aaka and thei went on toward the meet
place
here all the tribe wa gather in a ring stand silent becaus
thei were too move for speech on the issu of thi fight hung their
fate henga thei fear and hate becaus he us them cruelli and
brought ani who murmur to their death while wi thei like well yet
thei dare sai noth who knew not how the fight would go and thought
that no man could stand against the strength of the giant henga or
save himself from be crush beneath hi mighti club
still thei stare wonderingli at the new ax which wi bore and
point to it nudg each other also thei marvel becaus hi
hair had been cut off for what reason thei did not know though thei
thought it must be as an offer to the god
the time came although becaus of the cold mist that hung over sea
and shore the sun could not be seen all knew that it wa within an
hour of it set and grew more silent than befor present the
voic of on who watch on the outskirt of the crowd call
he come henga come whereon take their ey from wi thei
turn and stare toward the cave emerg from the shadow of the
cliff the giant appear walk toward them with a heavi tread but
unconcernedli wi stoop down and kiss foh hi son beckon to
aaka to take charg of him then follow by moananga hi brother and
by pag he walk to the centr of the open space where urk the ag
the wizard whose duti it wa to recit the condit of the duel in
the ancient form stood wait as he went whaka the birdofil
omen call to him
farewel wi whom we shall see no more we shall miss you veri much
for i know not where we shall find so good a hunter or on who bring
in so much meat
pag turn glower at him and said
me at least you shall see again croak raven
take no note wi walk on as he went it came into hi mind that
while he lai asleep in the hut he had dream a beauti dream he
could not rememb much of it but it substanc wa that he wa
seat in a rich and love land where the sun shone and water rippl
and bird sang where the air wa soft and warm and the wild creatur
wander round him unafraid and there wa plenti of fragrant food to
eat then in that sweet place came hi daughter foa grown veri
fair and with a face that shone as moonlight shine upon the sea and
set a garland of white flower about hi neck
thi wa all he could recal of the dream nor inde did he search
for more of it for thi vision of foa the cruelli slain brought
tear of rage to hi ey yet of a sudden hi strength seem to
doubl and he swore that he would kill henga even though afterward he
must enter that happi land of peac in which she seem to wander
the chief appear befor him wear hi cloak of tigerskin and
hold the great club in hi left hand

chapter vi
the death of henga
first at great length as master of the ancient custom of the tribe
urk set out the law of such combat as that of wi and henga he told
how the chief onli held hi offic and enjoi hi privileg by
virtu of the strength of hi bodi as doe the bull of a herd when a
younger and stronger than he aros he might kill the chief if he
could and take hi place onli accord to the law he must do so
in fair and open fight befor the peopl each combat be arm
with a singl weapon then if he conquer the cave wa hi with
those who dwelt there and all would acknowledg him as chief
wherea if he were conquer hi bodi would be thrown to the wolv
such be the fate of those that fail
in short though urk knew it not he wa set out the doctrin of
the surviv of the fittest and the right of the strong over the
weak as natur preach them in all her work
at thi point henga show sign of wish to have done with urk
oratori be for reason of hi own quit certain of a speedi
victori over an enemi whom he despis and anxiou to return to the
cave to receiv the prais of the womenfolk and to sleep off the
salmon which as pag guess he had devour almost to the tail but
urk would not be silenc here he wa master as keeper of the oral
record head offici and voic of the ceremoni of the tribe who
natur regard ani departur from establish custom as on of
the worst of crime
everyth must be set out urk declar in a high and indign
voic otherwis how would he earn hi fee of the robe and weapon of
the defeatedher he cast covet look at wi strang ax the
like of which he had never seen befor although hi wither arm
could scarc have found strength to lift it for a blow he announc
loudli that onc befor in hi youth he had assist hi father who
wa the first wizard befor him to go through thi ceremoni and the
garment he still woreher he touch the shini hairless and
tatter hide upon hi shouldershad been taken from the bodi of the
conquer if he were interrupt now he ad as wizard he would
pronounc hi most formid curs upon the violat of tradit and
privileg and what that meant probabl both of them would understand
wi listen and said noth but henga growl out
be swift then old fool for i grow cold and soon there will not be
enough light for me to see so to smash up thi fellow that even hi
dog would not know him again
then urk set out the reason that caus wi to challeng which be
anger by henga descript of him as old fool he did with point
and acid he told how wi alleg that henga oppress the peopl
and gave startl instanc of that oppress all of them quit
true he told of the kidnap and murder of wi daughter foa
which wi lai at the door of henga and of how the god were wroth at
such a crime warm to hi work inde he began to advanc other
grievanc not strictli connect with wi whereon henga abl to
bear no more rush at urk and sent hi frail old bodi fly with a
kick of hi huge foot
as urk pick himself up and hobbl off call down on henga head
hi widest if somewhat confus wizard curs henga threw off hi
tigerskin cloak which a slave remov as wi did likewis pag who
took the garment whisper to him
bewar he ha someth hidden in hi right hand he plai a trick
then he hobbl off with the cloak leav the giant and the hunter
face each other at a distanc of five pace
even as pag went henga lift hi arm and with fear forc hurl
at wi a flint knife set in a whale tooth for handl which he had
hidden in hi great paw but wi be warn wa watch and as a
shout of ill done went up from the crowd drop to the ground so
that the knife whizz over him next instant he wa up again
charg at henga who now grasp the club with both hand and swung
it aloft to crush him
befor it could fall wi rememb pag counsel smote with all
hi strength henga slope the club sidewai to protect hi head wi
ax fell on it halfwai up the handl and the sharp steel forg in
heaven furnac shore through the tough wood so that the thick part
of the club fell to the ground a sight that caus the peopl to
shout with wonder
henga threw the handl at wi strike him on the head and as he
stagger back pick up the thick end of the club wi paus to wipe
the blood out of hi ey for the broken stick had graze hi skin
then again he charg at henga and keep out of reach of the
shorten club strove to smite him on the knee onc more follow
the counsel of pag but the giant arm were veri long and the handl
of wi ax wa short so that the task wa difficult at length
howev a blow went home and although no sinew wa sever cut into
henga flesh abov the knee so deepli that he roar aloud
madden with rage and pain the giant chang hi plan drop the
club as wi straighten himself after the blow he leapt at him and
grip him in hi huge arm purpos to break hi bone or hug him
to death as a bear doe thei struggl togeth
all is over said whaka that man whom henga embrac is dead
pag who wa stand besid him smote him on the mouth sai
is it so look raven look
as he spoke wi slip from the grasp of henga as an eel slip from a
child hand again henga caught him by the head but wi hair have
been cut and hi scalp greas he could not hold him then the giant
smote at him with hi great fist a mighti blow that caught wi upon
the forehead and fell him to the ground befor he could rise henga
hurl himself onto him and the two struggl there upon the sand
never befor had the tribe seen a fight like thi nor did tradit
tell of such a on thei writh thei twist thei roll over now
thi on uppermost and now that on henga tri to get wi by the
throat but hi hand would not hold on the oil skin and alwai the
hunter escap from that deadli grasp and twice or thrice found
opportun to pound henga face with hi fist
present thei were seen to rise togeth the giant arm still
about wi whom he dare not loos becaus he wa weaponless while the
ax still hung to the hunter wrist thei wrestl stagger to and
fro cover with blood and sand and sweat the watcher shook their
head for how thought thei could ani man stand against the weight
and strength of henga but pag note everyth with hi quick ey
whisper to aaka who forget her hate in her troubl and fear
had drawn near to him
keep courag woman the salmon doe it work henga tire
it wa true the grip of the giant loosen hi breath came in short
gasp moreov that leg into which the ax of wi had cut began to
fail and he dare not put all hi weight upon it still gather up
hi strength with a mighti effort he cast wi from him with such forc
that the hunter fell to the ground and lai there a moment as though
he were stun or the breath had been shaken out of him
now moananga groan aloud wait to see henga spring upon hi foe
prostrat form and stamp him to death but some chang came over the
man it wa as though a sudden terror had taken him or perhap he
thought that wi wa dead if so he did not wait to look but turn
ran toward the cave wi recov hi wit or hi breath or both
sat up and saw then with a shout he leapt to hi feet and sped
after henga follow by all the peopl ye even by urk the ag
who hobbl along lean on hi wand of offic
henga had a long start but at everi step hi hurt leg grew weaker
and wi sped after him like a deer at the veri mouth of the cave he
overtook him and those who follow saw the flash of a fall ax and
heard the thud of it blow upon the back of henga who stagger
forward then the pair of them vanish into the shadow of the cave
while the peopl halt without await the issu whatev it might
be
a littl while later there wa a stir in the shadow out of them a
man appear it wa wi who bore someth in hi hand wi with the
red ax still hang from hi right arm he stagger forward a rai
from the set sun pierc the mist and struck full upon him and
that which he carri lo it wa the huge head of henga
for a moment wi stood still like on bemus while the tribe shout
their welcom to him as chief by right of conquest then he swoon
and fell forward into the arm of pag who see that he wa about to
fall thrust himself past aaka and caught him
becaus it wa nigh at hand wi wa carri into the cave whenc now
that he wa fallen the bodi of the giant henga wa drag as though
it had been that of a dog and afterward by the command of wi born
to the foot of the glacier and as he had vow laid there as an
offer to the icegod onli some of those whom he had wrong and
who hate him took hi head and climb a dead pine that stood near
by of which the top had been twist out by the wind stuck it upon
the jag point of the broken tree where it remain it long lock
float on the wind grin with empti ey at the hut below
when thei enter it thi cave which wa veri great wa found to be
full of women who although he wa still senseless hasten to do
rever to wi as their futur lord and hung about him till with
the help of moananga and other pag drove them all out sai that
if the chief wi want ani of them back again he could send for them
he ad that he did not think thi probabl becaus thei were all so
ugli which wa not true so thei went awai seek shelter where
thei could and were veri angri with pag more becaus he had said
that thei were ugli than becaus he had driven them out which thei
guess he had done becaus he did not trust them and fear lest
thei henga wive should do wi a mischief by poison or otherwis
wi be laid upon henga bed in a side cave near to a brightli
burn fire soon recov from hi swoon and have drunk some
water that on of the slave of the place gave to him for these were
not driven out with the women ask first for foh whom he embrac
and next for pag whom he bade to find aaka but aaka learn that
he wa recov and littl hurt had gone sai that she must
attend to the fire in her hut lest it should go out but would return
in the morn
so pag and moananga fed wi with food thei found in the place among it
a piec of that salmon which henga had left to eat after the fight
have swallow thi wi turn over and went to sleep be utterli
outworn so that he could not even speak foh crept onto the bed by
hi side for he would not leav hi father and did likewis
wi slept all night and woke in the morn to find himself alon for
foh had gone he wa veri stiff and bruis with a lump on the back
of hi head where he had fallen when henga threw him to the ground
also he wa sore all over from the grip of the giant hand and
there wa a deep cut on hi forehead where the handl of the club had
struck him and hi skin wa scratch by henga clawlik nail
still he felt within himself that no bone wa broken and that hi
bodi wa sound and whole thank fill hi heart that thi
should be so when he might well have been as henga wa todai
to whom did he ow thi safetyth icegod perhap and if so he
thank them he who did not desir to die and felt that he had work
to do for the peopl yet the icegod seem veri cold and far awai
and although the stone had fallen it might have been by chanc so
that he wonder whether thei troubl themselv about him and hi
fate pag thought that there were no god and perhap he wa right
at least thi wa clear that if it had not been for pag the god
would not have save him yesterdai from henga the giant the mightiest
man that wa told of in the tale of the tribe even by urk and other
who made up stori and sang them by the fire on winter night henga
who onc had caught a wild bull by the horn and twist it neck with
hi hand
pag it wa who had oil him all over and cut off hi hair so that
henga could not hold him pag it wa who had made and given to him the
wonder ax that lai on the bed besid him it thong still about hi
wrist without which he never could have smitten henga down as he
gain the safeti of hi cave or dealt him that deep cut upon the leg
which caus him to give up the fight and run even when he wi lai
prostrat on the ground caus him too to limp and stumbl in hi
flight so that he could be overtaken pag it wa too who had put a
great heart into him tell him not to be afraid for he would
conquer on that dai word which he rememb even when all seem
finish and now henga wa dead for after he fell smitten on the
back two blow of the wonder ax had hew right through hi thick
neck as no other weapon could have done foa wa aveng foh and
aaka were save and he wi wa lord of the cave and chief of the
peopl therefor he wi swore thi that pag though a dwarf
deform whom all hate and name wolfman should be next to him
among them and hi counsellor ye he swore it although he knew that
it would pleas aaka littl becaus of her jealou heart
whilst he lai and thought thu by the light that crept into the cave
wi notic that three of the women the youngest and fairest among
them had return to the place and were stand togeth at a
distanc talk and look toward him present thei came to a
decis for thei advanc veri quietli which caus wi to grip hi
ax see that hi ey were open thei knelt down and touch the
ground with their forehead call him lord and master sai that
thei wish to stai with him who wa so great and strong that he had
kill henga and swear to be faith to him
wi listen astonish not know what to answer least of all did
he wish to take these women into hi household if for no other reason
becaus anyon whom henga had touch wa hate to him yet be
kindheart he did not desir to tell them thi roughli while he
wa seek for soft word on of the women crept forward still upon
her knee and seiz hi hand press it against her forehead and
kiss it it wa at thi moment that aaka appear and follow by
pag the women sprang up and run a few pace huddl themselv
togeth while pag laugh hoars and aaka draw herself to her
full height said
it seem that you soon make yourself at home in your new hous
husband sinc alreadi i find henga castoff kiss you in love
love answer wi am i in a state for love the women camei did
not seek them
oh ye without doubt thei came know where thei would be
welcom husband inde perhap thei never went awai of a truth i
perceiv that there will be no room for me in thi chief cave well
i am glad of it who love my own hut better than such a darksom
hole
yet often wife i have heard you sai when the wind whistl through
the hut in winter that you wish you lai safe and warm in thi
cave
did i well i have chang my mind who had never seen the place
not have been on of henga famili
peac woman said pag and let us see how the chief wi fare as
for those slave i have hunt them out onc and present will do so
again chief we bring you food can you eat
i think so answer wi if aaka will hold me up
aaka look wrathfulli at the women and still more wrathfulli at pag
so that wi thought that she wa about to refus if so she chang
her mind and support wi who wa too stiff to stand up alon while
foh who had now return fed him with piec of food chatter all
the while about the fight
were you not afraid for your father ask wi at length who must
fight a giant twice hi size
oh no said foh cheerfulli pag told me that you would win in the
end and that therefor i must never be afraid and pag is alwai
right still he ad shake hi head when i saw you ly on
the ground and not move and believ that henga wa about to jump on
you then i began to think that for onc pag might be wrong
wi laugh and lift hi hand with difficulti pat foh curl
hair pag in the background growl
never think that i am wrong again for the god live on the faith of
hi worshippersword that foh did not in the least understand nor
did aaka quit but guess that pag wa compar himself to a god
she hate him more than ever and frown although she believ in
them after her fashion becaus her forefath had done so befor
her she wa not a spiritu woman and did not like hi talk of god
who if in fact thei exist at all were she wa sure be to
be fear it wa true that she had sent wi to worship the icegod in
which he put faith and to watch for the sign of the fall stone but
that wa becaus she had made up her mind that the time had come for
him to fight henga and aveng the death of foa if he could take
the risk of be kill and knew that at thi time of year at
sunris a stone wa almost certain to fall from the crest of the
glacier which wa strewn with hundr of them and that without some
sign he would not move inde she had made sure that on or more of
those stone would fall upon that veri morn also she had some
gift of foresight with which women ar often endow especi among
northern peopl that told her wi would conquer henga she said that
someth of thi had been reveal to her and it wa true enough
that she had dream that foa had appear and told her that wi would
work vengeanc upon henga becaus the thirst for vengeanc and desir
for the death of henga were alwai present to her mind
therefor she frown and told foh sharpli that it wa foolish to
believ sai becaus thei came out of the mouth of pag
yet mother answer foh what pag said wa true moreov he
made the wonder sharp ax and he oil father skin and cut off
hi hair which none of us thought of do
now pag wish to stop thi talk broke in
these thing ar noth foh and if i did them it is onli becaus
a hideou deform on such as i am who wa born differ from
other must think and protect himself and those he love by wisdom
as do the wolv and other wild beast peopl who ar handsom like
your father and mother do not need to think for thei protect
themselv in differ wai
yet perhap thei think as much as you do dwarf said aaka angrili
ye aaka doubtless thei think onli to less purpos the differ
is that such as i think right and thei think wrong
without wait for an answer pag waddl off veri swiftli on some
busi of hi own aaka watch him go with a puzzl look in her
fine ey then ask
is pag go to live with you in thi cave husband
ye wife now that i am chief he to whom i ow so much he the wise
and the axgiv will be my counsellor
then i shall live in my hut she answer where you can visit me
when it pleas you i hate thi place it smell of henga and hi
slave women bah
then she went awai to return later it is true yet as to sleep
in the cave she kept her wordthat is until winter came
chapter vii
the oath of wi
be veri strong and healthi wi soon recov from thi great
fight although for a time he suffer from fester sore where he
had been scratch by henga whose nail it would seem were
poison as ar a wolf teeth inde on the follow dai he came
out of the cave and wa receiv by all the peopl who were wait
without to give him welcom as the new chief thi thei did veri
heartili and next through the mouth of urk the ag went on to set
out their grievanc of which thei had prepar a long list these
thei suggest he the present ruler should redress
first thei complain of the climat which of late year had grown so
strang cold and sunless as to thi he answer that thei must
make prayer to the icegod whereon someon cri out that if thei
did these god would onli send them more ic of which thei had
enough alreadi an argument that wi could not combat he said
howev that perhap the weather had chang becaus of the evil
do of henga and now that he had gone it might chang again
next thei went on to speak of a delic and domest matter women
thei point out were veri scarc among them so much so that some
men although thei were prepar to marri the ugliest or the most
eviltemp could find no wive and make no home yet certain of
the strongest and richest took as mani as three or four into their
household while the late chief by virtu of hi rank and power had
swallow up from fifteen to twenti of the youngest and bestlook
whom thei suppos wi intend to keep for himself
on thi point wi repli that he intend noth of the sort as he
would make clear in due season and for the rest that women were few
becaus of their habit of expos femal children at birth rather
than be at the pain of rear and feed them
then thei went on to other matter such as the pressur of taxat
or it primev equival the chief took too much thei said and
gave too littl he did not work himself and produc noth yet he
and all hi great household expect to be support in luxuri and
with the best moreov he seiz their wive and daughter raid
their store of food or skin and occasion commit murder
lastli he favour certain rich men among themher urk look hard
at turi the foodhoard the avarici and at rahi the rich the
trader in fish hook skin and flint instrument which he caus
to be manufactur by forc labour onli pai the maker with a
littl food in time of want these rich men thei alleg were
protect in their evildo by the chief to whom thei paid a heavi
tith of their illgotten good in return for which he promot them
to posit of honour and gave them fine name such as counsellor
order that other should bow down to them
wi said that he would look into these practic and try to put a stop
to them
final thei call attent to the break of their ancient
custom as when he who had kill an anim or trap it in a pit
or found it dead or caught it fish and propos to lai it up for
the winter wa rob of it by a hord of hungri idler who wish to
live on the industri without toil for themselv
into thi matter also wi said that he would inquir
then he announc that he summon the whole tribe to a gather on
the dai of the next full moon when he would announc the result of
hi deliber and submit new law to be approv by the tribe
dure the time which elaps between thi meet and that of the
full moon name seventeen dai wi thought a great deal for hour
he would walk upon the shore accompani onli by pag whom aaka
contemptu name hi shadow with whom he consult deepli
toward the end of the time also he call in urk the ag moananga
hi brother and two or three other men none of the latter of much
promin but whom he knew to be honest and industri
the rest of the tribe devour by curios tri to wring from
these men what it might be that the chief talk of with them thei
would sai noth then thei set the women on to them who be even
more curiou did their best by mean of mani wile to find out what
all want to know even tana moananga wife the sweet and gentl
plai a part in thi game sai that she would not speak to him or
even look at him until he told her but he would not nor would the
other whereupon it wa decid that wi or pag or both of them
must have some great magic sinc it suffic to bridl the tongu of
men even when women tempt them
now a strang thing happen from the dai that wi becam chief the
weather mend at length the cold snowylook cloud roll awai
at length the pierc wind ceas to blow out of the north and east
at length though veri late the spring or rather the summer came
for that year there wa no spring seal appear though not in their
usual quantiti the salmon which seem to have been icebound ran up
the river in shoal while eider and other duck arriv and nest
late come soon gone said pag as he note these thing still
better that than noth
thu it came about that on the appoint dai the tribe full of food
and in high good humour met it chief whom it felt to be an
auspici person even aaka wa goodhumour and when tana who wa
her relat both by blood and becaus she wa the wife of wi
brother ask her what wa about to happen she answer laugh
i dont know but no doubt we shall be told some nonsens which wi
and that wolfman make up togetherempti word like the cackl of
wild gees which make a great nois and is soon forgot
at ani rate said tana inconsequ wi is behav veri well to
you for i know that he ha sent awai all those women slave of
henga
oh ye he is behav well enough but how long will it last is it
to be expect now that he ha becom chief that he will be
differ from other chief see that on man is like the rest
thei ar all the same moreov she ad acidli if he ha sent
awai the women he ha kept pag
what can that matter to you ask tana open her big ey
much more than all the rest tana if you could understand it which
you cannot it is of wi mind that i am jealou not of anyth els
about him and thi dwarf ha hi mind
inde said tana stare at her there is a strang fanci for my
part anyon is welcom to moananga mind it is of him that i am
jealou and with veri good reason not of hi mind
no said aaka sharpli becaus he ha not got on with wi it is
otherwis hi mind is more than hi bodi and that is why i would
keep it for myself
then you should learn to be as clever as pag answer tana with
gentl irrit as she turn to talk to someon els
the peopl were gather at the talkingplac in front of the cave
the same spot where wi had conquer henga there thei stood or sat in
a semicircl those of the more consequ in front and the rest
behind present winiwini blew a blast on hi horn a strong and
steadi blast for thi time he fear no evil from rock or otherwis
to announc the appear of the chief then wi clad in the
tigerskin cloak that henga us to wear which as aaka remark wa
too big for him and much frai advanc follow by moananga urk
pag and the other and sat down upon a stool made from two joint of
the backbon of a whale lash togeth which had been place there
in readi for him
is all the tribe gather here ask winiwini the herald to which
spokesmen answer that it wa except a few who would not come
then hearken to the chief wi the great hunter a mighti man the
conqueror of henga the evil that is unless anyon wish first to
fight him for hi place and he paus
as nobodi answeredfor who in hi sens wish to face the wonder
ax that had chop off the great head of henga whereof the hollow
ey still stare at them from the broken trunk of a neighbour
treewi rose and began hi address sai
o peopl of the tribe we believ that there ar no other like us
anywhereat least we have seen none upon the beach or in the wood
around though it is true that in the ic yonder behind the mighti
sleeper is someth that look like a man if so he di long ago
unless inde he is a god perhap he wa a forefath of the tribe
who went into the ic to be buri there be therefor the onli
men and though it is true that in some wai thei ar stronger than
we ar much greater than the beast peopl for we can think and talk
and build hut and do thing that the beast cannot do it is right
that we should show how much better we ar than thei by our conduct to
each other as it had never occur to the peopl to compar
themselv rel to the anim around them these lofti
sentiment were receiv in silenc inde if thei thought about the
matter at all most of them compar men and the beast would have
been inclin to give the palm to the latter
could ani man thei would have said and in fact did sai in privat
argument afterward match the strength of the auroch the wild bull
of the wood or of the whale of the water could ani man swim like a
seal or fly like a bird or be as swift and savag as the stripe
tiger that dwelt or us to dwell in cave or hunt in pack like the
fierc raven wolv or build such hous as the bird did or fly
through the air or do mani other thing with the perfect of the
creatur which live and move in the sea and sky or upon the earth
while as for the other side of the matter were not these creatur
in their own wai as clever as man wa also although their languag
wa not to be understood did thei not talk togeth as men did and
worship their own god who could doubt it that had heard the wolv
and dog howl at the moon but of all thi at that time thei said
noth
have laid down thi gener rule wi went on to sai that as thing
were thu he had given ear to the complaint of the peopl and after
consult with sundri of the wisest among them had determin that
the time had come to make new law which all must bind themselv to
obei or if all would not then those who refus must give wai to the
major who consent to them or if thei rebel must be treat
as evildo and punish if thei agre to thi let them sai so
with on voic
thi thei did first becaus thei were tire of sit still and it
gave them an opportun of shout and second becaus thei had not
heard the law onli on or two of the most cun exclaim that
thei would like to hear the law first but these were overrul by
the cri of gener approb
to begin with continu wi there wa the matter of scarciti of
women which could onli be remedi to some extent by everi man in
futur bind himself to be content with a singl wife as he wi
wa prepar to do swear by the god that he would keep to hi
oath and call down on hi own head and on the head of the peopl of
which he wa the chief the anger and the vengeanc of the god should
he break it and should thei allow him to do so
now in the silenc which follow thi amaz announc tana
whisper to aaka delightedli
do you hear sister what do you think of thi law
i think that it amount to noth at all answer aaka
contemptu wi and the other men will obei it until thei see
someon who make them wish to break it moreov mani of the women
will find it hate when thei grow old will thei wish to have to do
all the work of the household and to cook the food for the whole
famili that for thi law which is foolish like all new thing
here she snap her finger still let it go on see that it
will give us a stick with which to beat our husband when thei forget
it as doubtless wi himself will find out befor all is done the
silli dreamer who think that he can chang the natur of men with a
few word unless inde it wa pag who put it into hi head pag
who is neither man nor woman but just a dwarf and a wolfhound
wolfhound ar veri us sometim aaka said tana reflect
then turn to listen to the voic about her
these as it happen were mani for as soon as the mean of wi
startl propos had come home to the mind of hi audienc great
tumult aros all the men who had no wive or wish for those of
other shout for joi as did mani of the women who were member of
larg household and therefor much neglect on the other hand some
of the lord of those household protest with vigour wherea other
acquiesc with a shrug and a smile
long and loud wa the debat but at length it end in a compromis
the polygamist agre to the propos provid that thei were
allow to keep that wife whom thei like best also to chang her
when thei wish by mutual consent of all concern as public
opinion among the tribe an easygo folk wa toler on such
matter ultim hi solut wa accept by all except by wi
himself he with the newborn enthusiasm of the reform and as on
who wish to set an exampl rose and exempt himself solemnli from
the arrang
other mai do what thei will he said but it is known that i the
chief will never chang my wife while she live no not even if she
desir me to do so which can scarc happen hearken o peopl
onc more i swear by the god to lai their curs upon me if i break
thi my oath moreov lest at ani time i should grow weak and
foolish and be tempt so to do i prai the god if that chanc to
lai their curs upon the peopl also all of them from the oldest to
the youngest
here some of hi audienc grew uneasi and a voic shout out
for what reason
becaus answer wi in hi burn zeal know the evil that my
illdo would bring upon your head never would i yield to folli i
who am your chief and your protector also if i went mad and did such
a thing you could kill me
silenc follow thi remark declar in the midst of which
hotoa the slowspeech at last got out a question
how would kill you help us wi if the curs for which you have
been ask had alreadi fallen upon our head moreov who is like
to kill you while you have that wonder ax with which you chop
henga in two he ask
befor wi could think of a suitabl answer for the question wa
shrewd and the point on which he had not consid the gener
argument broke out again mani women take part in it at the top of
their voic so that he lost hi opportun at length three men
were thrust forward a somewhat omin trio as it happen pitok
the unlucki hou the unstabl and whaka the birdofillomen of whom
whaka wa the spokesman
chief wi he said the peopl have heard your propos as to
marriag mani of us do not like them becaus thei overthrow old
custom still we acknowledg that someth must be done lest the
peopl should come to an end for those who have mani wive bring up
no more children than those who have but on also the unmarri turn
into murder and thiev both of women and of other properti
therefor we accept the new law for a period of five summer which
will give us time to see how it work also we note your oath that
you will take no other wife while aaka live and that you call down
the curs of the god upon yourself if you do so we do not think that
you will keep that oath for be a chief who can do what he like
why should you but when you break it we shall wait to see if the
curs fall upon you as for the rest that you call it down on the
peopl also with that we will have noth to do nor do we believ
it for why should the peopl suffer becaus you break an oath if
there ar god thei will be aveng upon him who doe the wrong not
on other who ar innoc therefor speak on behalf of the
peopl i sai that we accept your law though for myself i add that i
am sure no good can ever come of the chang of ancient custom
inde i daresai that the curs will fall upon you and that soon you
will be dead
thu spoke whaka the birdofillomen fulfil hi reput and
retir with hi companion
by now it wa grow dark for all thi debat had taken a long time
moreov mani of the peopl had slip awai to try to make new
arrang in view of thi sudden and unexpect revolut in their
matrimoni law therefor wi adjourn the discuss of the next
rule of hi new code that which dealt with the exposur of unwant
femal infant till the morrow and the tribal confer broke up
that night he slept in the hut where he live befor he becam chief
and at the even meal tri to open a discuss with aaka on hi
great new law she listen for a minut then remark that she had
heard enough of it that afternoon and if he want to talk more of
the matter instead of eat hi food and discuss what wa of real
import name how she should lai up her winter store now that
he had becom chief he had better do so with hi counsellor pag
thi retort anger wi who said
do you not understand that thi law make women taller by a head than
thei have been for now thei ar the equal of men who give up much
if so answer aaka you should first have ask us whether we
wish to grow taller had you done so you would have found i think
that the most of us were content to remain the same size see that
we do not desir more work and more children still it matter
littl for your law is all nonsens on made by fool of whom i
should hold you the biggest did i not know that you speak with the
mouth of pag the womanhat and the cutter down of old tree by
thi she meant the destroy of old custom man is man and woman is
woman and what thei have done from the begin thei will continu
to do nor will you chang them by talk wi although you think
yourself so clever yet i am glad to learn that i shall have no pert
girl thrust into my household or so you swore call down curs
on your own head in the presenc of mani wit like a fool for
when you break the oath you will find them troublesom to deal with
then with a sigh wi grew silent he had thought to pleas aaka whom
he love and had suffer much to win and who he knew love him in
her fashion although often she treat him so roughli still he
note that it wa her purpos to take advantag of thi law so far as
she wa concern and to keep him for herself alon why then he
wonder did she belittl that of which she meant to take advantag
a thing which no man would do then he shrug hi shoulder and
began to talk of the winter food and of the plan which he and pag had
made wherebi all would be assur of plenti
that night toward dawn thei were awaken by a great tumult women
shriek and men shout the boi foh who slept on the other side of
the hut behind a skin curtain crept out to see what wa the matter
think perhap that the wolv had carri off someon present
he return and report that there wa fight go on but he did
not know what about
now wi wish to rise and look into the matter but aaka bade him lie
still sai
keep quiet it is your new law at work that is all
when morn came thi prove to be true enough some wive of old
husband had run awai from them to young lover and some men who had
no wive had captur or tri to captur them by forc with the
result that there wa much fight in which on old man had been
kill and other male and femal injur
aaka laugh at wi about thi busi but he wa so sad that he did
not try to answer her onli he said
you treat me hardli wife of late who am try to do my best and
who love you as i prove long ago when i fought a man who wish to
take you against your will and kill him which brought much anger
and troubl on me then you thank me and we came togeth and for
year live happili at last henga who hate me and had alwai
desir to take you into the cave caught our daughter foa and kill
her and from that time you who love foa more than you do foh have
chang toward me although that thi happen wa no fault of mine
it wa your fault she answer for you should have stai to
watch foa instead of go out to hunt to pleas yourself
i did not hunt to pleas myself i hunt to get meat moreov if
you had ask me i would have left pag to watch the girl
so the dwarf ha been tell you that tale ha he then know the
truth he did offer to stai with foa but i would not have that
hideou beast guard my daughter
pag ha told me no tale though it is true that doubtless to shield
you he reproach me for have taken him out hunt when there wa
danger from henga wife you have done ill for if you hate pag yet
he love me and mine and had you allow him to bide with foa she
would have been aliv todai but let that matter beth dead ar
dead and we shall see them no more afterward i prai to the god
as you wish and challeng henga and kill him take vengeanc
on him as you also wish pag help me with hi wisdom and by the
gift of the ax and now i have driven awai all the chief women who
were mine by right of custom and have made a law that henceforth a
man shall have but on wife and that i might set an exampl as
chief have call down curs on my head and that i might never
weaken in thi matter on the tribe too if i myself should break
that law and yet you ar still bitter against me have you then
ceas to love me
would you know the truth wi she answer look him in the ey
then i will tell you i have not i who never had a thought toward
anoth man i love you as well as i did on the dai when you kill
rongi for my sake but hearkeni love not pag who is your chosen
friend and it is to pag that you turn not to me pag is your
counsellornot i it is true that sinc foa wa kill all water is
bitter to my tast and all meat is sprinkl with sand and in place
of my heart a stone beat in my breast so that i care for noth and
am as readi to die as to live which i thought i must do when the huge
cave dweller hurl you down yet i sai thi to youdriv out pag as
you can do be chief and so far as i am abl i will be to you
what i wa befor not onli your wife but your counsellor choos
then between me and pag
now wi bit hi lip as wa hi fashion when perplex and look at
her sadli sai
women ar strang also thei know not the thing that is just onc i
save pag life and becaus of that he love me also becaus he is
veri wise the wisest i think of all the peopl i listen to hi
word further by hi craft and counsel and with the help of the
gift he gave me and he look at the ax hang from hi wrist i
slew henga who without these should now myself be dead also foh
our son love him and he love foh and with hi help i have
fashion new law which shall make life good for all the tribe yet
you sai to me drive out pag my friend and helper know that if
he ceas to sit in my shadow the women who ar hi enemi would
kill him or he must wander awai and live like a wild beast in the
wood wife if i did thi i should be a treacher dog not a man
and much less a chief whose duti it is to do justic to all why
becaus you ar jealou of him do you ask such a thing of me
for my own reason wi which ar enough well i ask and you do not
grant so go your road and i will go mine though among the peopl it
need not be known that we have quarrel as for these new law i
tell you that thei will bring you troubl and noth els you seek
to cut down an old tree and to plant a better in it place but if it
ever grow at all you will be dead befor it keep a drop of rain
from off you you ar vain and foolish and it is pag who ha made you
so
thu thei part wi go awai full of sad for now he wa sure
that noth he could sai or do would chang aaka heart had he been
as were the other of the peopl he would have rid himself of her and
taken anoth wife leav her to take anoth husband if she chose
but wi wa not like the rest of the tribe he wa on born out of hi
time a forerunn on with imagin who could understand other
and see with their ey he understood that aaka wa jealou by
natur jealou of everyon not onli of other women that which she
had she want to keep for herself alon she would rather that wi
should lack guidanc and help than that he should find these in the
dwarf pag or in other men she wa even jealou of her son foh
becaus he love him hi father better than he did her
now with foa it had been otherwis for although he had love her
so much she had taken littl note of her father and had clung close
to her mother so when foa wa kill aaka had lost everyth
moreov she knew that she herself wa to blame for when wi went
hunt as he must she would not suffer pag to protect the child
both becaus she hate him and becaus foa like pag therefor
through her own folli she had lost her daughter and knew that thi
wa so and yet blame not herself but wi becaus pag wa hi
friendwhich caus her to hate pag so much that she would not suffer
him to guard foa from that moment as she had said water had becom
bitter to her and all meat full of sand she wa sour and differ
from what she had beeninde anoth woman
in the old dai with a kind of trembl joi she had thought how on
dai wi might becom chief of the tribe now she did not care whether
he were chief or not even to have becom the first woman in the tribe
gave her no pleasur for the blow of the death of foa although she
knew it not had fallen on her brain and disturb her reasonth
more so becaus she wa sure that she would bear no other children
yet deep in her heart she love wi better than she had ever done and
suffer more than she could have told becaus she fear lest some
other woman should appear to whom he might turn for the fellowship and
comfort she would no longer give
now all these thing wi knew better than did aaka herself becaus by
natur he wa a man with an understand heart although but a poor
savag who as yet had no pot in which to boil hi food therefor he
wa veri sad and yet determin to be patient hope that aaka mind
would right itself and that she would chang her face toward him
when wi reach the cave he found pag wait for him with food
which foh who had gone befor him at the break of dai serv with
much stir and mysteri eat of thi foodit wa a small salmon new
run from the seawi note oddli enough that it wa cook in a new
fashion and made savouri with salt shellfish and certain herb
i have never tast the like of thi befor he said how is it
prepar
then with triumph foh point out to him a vessel hollow from a
block of wood which stood by the fire and show him that in thi
vessel water boil
how is it done ask wi if wood is place upon fire it burn
next foh rake awai some ash reveal in the heart of the fire a
number of redhot stone
it is done thu father he said for dai i have been hollow
out that block of black wood which come from the swamp where it lai
buri by burn it and when it wa char cut it awai with a
piec of that same bright stone of which your ax is made then when
it wa finish and wash i fill it with water and drop redhot
stone into it till the water boil after thi i put in the clean
fish with the oyster and the herb and kept on drop in redhot
stone till the fish wa cook that how it is done fatherand is
the fish nice and he laugh and clap hi hand
it is veri nice son said wi and i would that i had more stomach
to eat it but who thought of thi plan which is clever
oh pag thought of it father but i did nearli all the work
well son take awai the rest of the fish and eat it and then go
wash out your pot lest it should stink i tell you that you and pag
have done more than you know and that soon you will be famou in the
tribe
then foh depart rejoic and afterward even took the pot to hi
mother to show her all expect that she would prais him but in
thi he wa disappoint for when she learn that pag had hit upon
thi plan she said that for her part she wa content with food
cook as her forefath had cook it from the begin and that
she wa sure that seeth flesh would make those who at of it veri
sick
but it did not make them sick and soon thi new fashion spread and
the whole tribe might be seen burn hollow in block of wood
cut awai the char that wa left with their chip flint and
when the pot were finish make water boil with the redhot stone
and place in it meat that wa tough from have been store in the
ic or fish or egg or whatev thei need to cook thu those who
were old and toothless could now eat again and grew fat moreov the
health of the tribe improv much especi that of the children
who ceas to suffer from dysenteri brought on by the devour of
lump of flesh char in the fire
chapter viii
pag trap the wolv
on the afternoon of thi dai of hi quarrel with aaka and of the
boil of the salmon wi and hi counsellor again met the tribe in
front of the cave to declar to them more of hi new law thi time
howev not so mani attend becaus as a fruit of the first law a
number of them were laid by hurt while other were engag
quarrel over the women or if thei belong to the unmarri in
build hut larg enough to hold a wife
at onc befor the talk began mani complaint were laid as to the
violenc work upon the previou night and demand made for
compens for injuri receiv also there were knotti point to
be decid as to the allot of women when for exampl three or
four men wish to marri on girl which of them wa to take her
thi wi decid must be settl by the girl choos which of them
she would an announc that caus wonder and dismai sinc never
befor had a woman been allow to make choic in such a matter which
had been settl by her father if he were known or more frequent
by her mother or sometim if there were none to protect her by her
be drag off by the hair of her head by the strongest of her
suitor after he had kill or beaten the other
soon howev moananga and pag point out to him that if he stop
to hear and give judgment on all these caus no more new law would
be declar for mani dai therefor he adjourn them till some
futur time and set out the second law which declar that in
futur no femal child should be cast forth to be taken by the wolv
or to perish of cold unless it were deform thi announc
caus much grumbl becaus said the grumbler the child belong
to the parent and especi to the mother and thei had a right to
do with their own as thei wish
then an inspir seiz wi and he utter a great sai which
afterward wa to be accept by most of the world
the child come from heaven and belong to the god whose gift it is
and who will requir account of it from those to whom it ha been
lent he said
these word so amaz to the peopl who had never even dream
their like were receiv in astonish silenc urk the ag sit
at wi side mutter that he had never heard anyth of the sort
from hi grandfath while pag the sceptic behind him ask
to what god
again an inspir came to wi and he answer aloud
that we shall learn when we ar dead for then the hidden god will
becom visibl
next he went on hastili to declar the punish for the break of
thi law it wa terribl name that the castersforth should
themselv be cast forth to suffer the same fate and that none should
succour them
but if we had no food for the children cri a voic
then if that is prove to be so i the chief will receiv them and
care for them as though thei were my own or give them to other who
ar barren
sure soon we shall have a larg famili aaka remark to tana
ye said tana still wi ha a great heart and wi is right
at thi point as though by gener consent the meet broke up for
all felt that thei could not swallow more than on law a dai
on the follow afternoon thei came togeth again but in still
fewer number and wi continu to give out law veri excel law
which did not interest hi audienc much either becaus as on of
them said thei were full to the throat with wisdom or for the
reason that like other savag thei could not keep their attent
fix for long on such matter
the end of it wa that no on came at all to listen and that the law
must be proclaim throughout the tribe by winiwini with hi horn
for dai he might be seen go from hut to hut blow hi horn and
shout out the law into the doorwai till at last the women grew
angri and set on the children to pelt him with eggshel and dri
cod head inde by the time he had finish those in the first
hut where he began had quit forgotten of what he wa talk
still the law have been duli proclaim without ani refus of
them were held to be in forc nor wa ignor of them allow to
be plead as excus for their break everi man woman and child
be presum to know the law even if thei did not obei them
yet wi discov that it is much easier to make law than to forc
peopl to keep them with the result that soon to hi offic of
lawgiv he must add that of chief magistr nearli everi dai wa
he oblig to sit in front of the cave or in it when the weather wa
bad to try case and award punish which were mostli inflict by
certain sturdi fellow who wield whip of whalebon in thi
fashion a knowledg of the code and of what happen to those who
broke it grew by degre thu when turi the foodhoard manag to
secur more than hi share of the spread of stockfish by arriv
earlier than the other hi hoard wa raid and most of it
distribut among the poor after which he wa more care in the
hide of hi illgotten gain
again when rahi the rich trader wa prove to have suppli bad
bonefish hook broken at the point or weak in the shank in exchang
for skin which had been receiv by him in advanc moananga went
with some men and dig beneath the floor of hi hut found score
of hook wrap up in hide which thei took and distribut amongst
those of the tripe who had none great wa the outcri of rahi but in
thi case few join in it for all love to see who batten on the
poor in the hour of their necess forc to disgorg some of hi
gain
moreov although he offend mani who murder and plot against
him on the whole wi gain great credit for these good law of hi
for now the peopl knew that he who dwelt in the cave wa no murder
or robber as henga and other chief had been but a man who take
from them as littl as might be wa honest and although often as
thei thought foolish on who strove for the good of all therefor
by degre thei came to obei hi lawssom more and some lessand
although thei abus him openli in privat thei spoke well of him and
hope that hi rule would continu
yet at last troubl came it chanc that a certain sournatur woman
name ejji bore a femal child and not wish to be troubl with
it forc her husband to lai it on a stone at the edg of the forest
where the wolv came everi night that it might be devour by them
but thi woman wa watch by other womenset about the busi by
pag who knew her heart and suspect hera wa her husband who wa
seiz when he had laid the child upon the stone at nightfal even as
he told hi wife ejji what he had done and receiv her thank
next morn both of them were brought befor wi who sat deal out
justic at the mouth of the cave he ask them what had becom of the
girl child that wa born to them within a moon ejji answer boldli
that it had di and it bodi had been cast awai accord to custom
thereon wi made a sign and a foster mother wa led from the cave
bear the child in her arm for thither it had been taken as wi
had promis should be done in such case the woman ejji deni that
it wa her child but the husband take it in hi arm said
otherwis and on be press admit that what he had done wa
against hi will and for the sake of peac in hi home
then when the find of the child had been prove wi after
recit the law order that these two who were rich and not driven
by need should be taken at sunset and ti to tree by that stone
upon which thei had expos the child that the wolv might devour
them at thi stern sentenc there wa much troubl among the tribe
most of whom had thrown out femal infant in their time and threat
were made against wi
yet he would not chang hi judgment and at nightfal amidst
lament from their rel and friend the pair were taken out
and ti to the tree whereon thei were abandon by all as evildo
who had been unlucki enough to be found out
dure the night growl and cri were heard rise from the
direct of the tree which told the tribe that ejji and her husband
had been devour by the wolv which alwai wander there at a
distanc from the hut where unless thei were veri hungri thei dare
not come becaus of the fire and the pitfal the death of these
two made the peopl veri angri so much so that mani of them ran up to
the cave to revil wi by whose order it had been brought about
shout out that the kill of men and women becaus thei wish to
be rid of a useless brat wa not to be born greatli were thei
astonish when there in the mouth of the cave thei saw three dead
wolv and stand behind them bound hand and foot ejji and her
husband
then waddl forth pag hold a red spear in hi hand who said
listen thi pair were justli condemn to die by the death that thei
would have given to their child yet went forth wi the chief and
moananga hi brother and i pag with some dog and wait in the
night close by but where thei could not see us came the wolv six
or eight of them and flew at these two then we loos the dog and
at risk to ourselv attack the brute kill three and wound
other so that thei ran awai afterward we unbound ejji and her
husband and carri them here for thei were so frighten that thei
could scarc walk now by the command of wi i set them free to
tell all that if anoth girl is cast forth those who do the deed
will be left to die and none will come to save them
so ejji and her husband were loos and crept awai cover with
shame but for hi deal in thi matter wi gain great honour as
moananga and even pag did also
after thi no more girl children were thrown out to die or to be
devour but on the other hand sever were brought to wi becaus
their parent said thei could not support them these infant as he
had promis he would do he took into the cave set asid a part
of it near to the light and fire for their us which as the place
wa larg could be done easili here the mother must come to feed
them till thei were old enough to be given into the charg of certain
women whom he chose to nurs them
now all these chang caus much talk in the tribe so that two
parti were form on of which wa in favour of them and on
against them howev as yet no on quarrel with wi whom all knew
to be better and wiser than ani chief told of in their tradit
moreov the peopl had other thing to think of sinc now in the
summer month wa the time when food must be store for the long
winter
at thi busi wi and hi council made everyon work accord to
hi strength even the children be us to collect the egg of
seabird and to spread out the cod and other fish after clean
them to dry in the sun in a place watch dai and night where the
wolv and fox could not come to steal them a tith of all thi
food went to the chief for hi support and for that of those depend
on him then half of what remain wa store against dai of want
either in the cave or to keep it fresh buri deep in ic at the
foot of the glacier with great stone pile upon the top to make it
safe from the wolv and other beast of prei
thu did wi work from dawn to dark with pag to help him direct
all thing till often he wa so tire that he fell asleep befor he
could lie down he who hitherto had spent most of hi dai hunt in
the open air at night he would sometim rest in aaka hut for she
kept her word and would not come into the cave while pag wa there
thu thei live in seem agreement and talk togeth of small
matter of daili life but no more of those over which thei had
quarrel
the boi foh howev although he slept in hi mother hut at night
as he wa command to do live more and more with hi father becaus
there he wa so welcom for aaka wa jealou even of foh and thi
the lad knewor felt
the winter came on veri earli inde that year there wa littl
autumn of a sudden on on calm dai when a sun without heat shone
wi who wa walk on the shore with urk the ag moananga and pag
for he wa so busi that thu he wa forc to take counsel with them
heard a sound like thunder and saw the eiderduck rise in thousand
wheel round and fly off toward the south
what frighten them he ask and urk answer
noth i think but when i wa a boi over seventi summer gone i
rememb that thei did just the same thing at about thi time after
which came the harshest and longest winter that had been known when
it wa so cold that mani of the peopl di still it mai happen that
the fowl were frighten by someth such as a shake of the earth
when the ic stir farther north at the end of summer if so thei
will return but if not we shall see them no more till next spring
the duck did not return although thei left so hurriedli that hundr
of flapper which could scarc fly remain behind and were hunt
down by the children of the tribe and store in the ic for food also
the breed seal that came up from the south and other creatur
went awai with their young as did most of the fish
next night there wa a sharp frost warn by which wi set the tribe
to drag in firewood from the edg of the forest where fir blown down
by storm lai in plenti thi wa a slow and toilsom task becaus
thei had no saw with which to cut up the tree or rid them of the
branch and could onli hack them to piec slowli with flint ax
from long experi thei count on a month of open weather for thi
wood harvest befor the snow began to fall buri the dead tree so
that thei could not come at them for thi fueldrag wa their
last task er winter set in
that year howev snow fell on the sixth dai although not thickli
and the heavi sky show that there wa more to come note thi wi
set the whole tribe to work and neglect everyth els went out
with them to make sure that all did their share thu it came about
that in fourteen more dai thei had pile up a greater store of wood
than urk had ever seen in all hi life and with it much moss for the
camp wick and mani heap of seawe left by the high tide which if
kept dry under earth burn even better than did the wood
the peopl grumbl at thi incess toil carri on in sleet or
lightli fall snow but wi would not listen to their complaint for
he wa frighten of he knew not what and made them work through all
the hour of the daylight and even by that of the moon well wa it
that he did so for scarc were the last trunk drag home the
bough brought in and pile up by the boi and girl and all the
heap of seawe earth up when a great snow began to fall which
continu for mani dai buri the land sever feet deep so that
it would have been imposs to come to the fallen tree or to
collect the moss and seawe then after the snow came frost great
frost that continu for month
never had such a winter been known as that which began with thi
snowfal especi as the daylight seem to be shorter than in the
past though thi thei held wa becaus of the continu snow cloud
befor it wa done inde even the greatest grumbler in the tribe
bless wi who had laid up such vast store of food and fuel without
which thei must have perish as it wa mani who were old or weakli
di as did some of the children and becaus it wa imposs to
buri them in the frozen earth thei were taken awai and cover with
snow whenc present the wolv dug them up
as the month went on these wolv becam veri terribl for be
unabl to find food thei raven boldli round the villag and even
rush into the hut at night drag out some of their inmat
while in the daytim thei lai in wait to catch children then wi
caus steep snow bank to be made as a protect and at certain
place kept fire burn do all he could to scare the beast
great white bear from the seaborn ic appear also roam round
and terrifi them though these creatur seem to be afraid of man
and did not kill ani peopl drawn by it smell howev thei dug up
some of the buri store of food and devour them which wa a great
loss to the tribe
at length the attack of these wolv and other wild beast grew so
fierc and constant that wi after consult with moananga and pag
determin that war must be wage against them befor more peopl were
devour now in the icetop hill behind the beach where the hut
stood wa a certain highclif hole from which there wa no escap
and which could onli be enter by a narrow gorg thi wa the plan
of wi the cun hunterto drive all the wolv into that great
rocksurround hole and to build a wall across it mouth over which
thei could not climb and thu to be rid of them first howev he
must accustom them to enter that place lest thei should break back
thi he propos to do in the follow fashion
at the begin of the winter a dy whale of which the tongu wa
torn out by thresher shark had drift ashor or rather into
shallow water and the tribe wa set to work to cut it up when it wa
dead for the sake of it blubber and meat thi thei did pile up
great lump of flesh and blubber upon certain rock that rose out of
the water which thei purpos to drag awai after the ic had form
whilst thei were still engag upon thi task there came terribl
snowstorm and gale so that thei must abandon it and after these a
thaw with more gale had prevent them from come to the rock
when at last the weather abat thei went there to find that the
whale flesh had becom rotten dure the thaw so that it wa useless
and must be left where it lai now when everyth wa frozen wi
determin to fetch thi flesh or as much of it as thei could carri
and place it in the great rock hollow whither the wolv would
certainli be drawn by it smell have plan all thi he call
the chief men of the tribe togeth and told them what must be done
thei listen veri doubtfulli especi a parti of them led by
pitok the unlucki and whaka the birdofillomen who said that
wolv attack men but never had thei heard such a thing as that men
should attack the host of the wolv in the dead of winter when these
were fierc and terribl
listen said wi will you rather kill the wolv or be kill by
them with your women and children for know that it ha come to thi
the brute be mad with hunger
then thei wrangl for a long time so that the matter could not be
settl that dai and must be put off till the morrow
as it chanc that veri night the wolv made a great attack upon
the hut a hundr or more of them scrambl over the snow bank
and rush past the fire so that befor thei could be driven off a
woman and two children were torn to piec while other were bitten
after thi the elder accept the plan of wi becaus thei could see
no other
so first of all the strongest men were sent to the mouth of the
gorg where thei drag togeth loos stone of which there were
hundr ly about though mani of these thei could not move becaus
the frost held them fast these stone thei built into a wall with a
broad bottom and twice the height of a man fill in the crack with
snow which soon froze solid but leav a gap in the middl through
which the wolv might enter also other piledup stone wherewith it
could be close veri swiftli then thei went down to the seashor and
cross the ic or if it wa broken wade through the shallow
water came to those rock on which the whale flesh wa store and
scrape the deep snow off the heap
now howev thei found themselv beaten for notwithstand the
cover snow the frost had frozen the outer lump of flesh and
blubber so hard that thei could not move them therefor their labour
lost thei return home whaka announc loudli that he knew all the
while that thi would be so
that night wi and pag talk long and earnestli but though thei were
wise thei could find no plan to overcom thi troubl wi thought of
light fire upon the heap to thaw them but pag point out that
if thei did thi the blubber would catch fire and all be burn so
at last thei ceas talk and wi went to aaka who now had chang
her mind and slept in the cave becaus of the cold and the wolv and
ask her counsel
so when pag fail you you come to me for wisdom she said well i
have none to give seek it of your god for thei alon can help you
as it came about the god or chanc did help and in a strang
fashion in the dark toward dawn a great nois wa heard out in
the sea grunt and growl and when at last light came wi saw a
whole troop of great white bear crawl awai through the snow mist
when thei had all gone call pag and some other he made hi wai
over the ic to the rock where the whale flesh wa pile up and
found that with their sharp claw and giant strength the bear
scent food now that the snow had been remov had torn the heap
open and scatter them so that the centr which were not frozen so
hard becaus of the protect of the snow lai expos much thei had
eaten of cours but more remain
then wi said to pag
i thought that we must leav the pit unbait and try to drive the
wolv into it as best we could but it is not so for the god have
been good to us
ye said pag the bear have been veri good to us and for aught i
know the god mai be bear or the bear god
then he sent to summon all the men of the tribe befor the expos
flesh turn to solid ic thei camescor of them mani with hide
rope which thei made fast to great lump of meat and other with
rough reedwoven basket set to work befor night fell thei had
carri ton of the flesh into the rock pit which wa round and mai
have measur a hundr pace from side to side where thei left it to
freez so that the wolv could not drag it awai or eat it easili
that night watch by the moonlight thei saw and heard mani wolv
gather at the mouth of the pit and walk to and fro fill with
doubt and fear of rap at last some enteredthough onli a veri few
of themand were suffer to go awai unhind when thei had gorg
themselv next night more enter and next night more though now
thei could make small plai with the flesh becaus the frost had turn
it into stone on the fourth dai wi call up the tribe and befor
sunset sent all the younger man led by moananga into the wood
make a great halfcircl round those place where thei knew the
wolv had their lair order them to hide there sever togeth
so that thei might not be attack and not to stir till thei saw a
fire burn upon a certain rock then with shout thei were to
advanc drive all the wolv befor them toward the mouth of the
gorg
so the men went for now thei knew that either thei must conquer the
wolv or the wolv would conquer them
then it wa that pag behav veri strang for after these man had
start he said
thi plan is of no us wi for when the wolv hear the shout
thei will not run toward the gorg but will break and scatter by on
and two thi wai and that slip through the driver or round the
end of the line befor it close
if you think that why did you not sai so befor ask wi angrili
for my own reason hearken wi all the women call me a wolfman do
thei not on who chang into a wolf and hunt with the wolv well
that is a lie and yet there is truth mix up with thi lie you know
that soon after i wa born my mother cast or caus me to be cast
out into the forest where she wa sure the wolv would eat me but
afterward my father found me and brought me back what you do not know
is that thi wa ten dai from the time when i wa cast out now how
did i live dure those dai i cannot tell you who have no memori
but i hold that some wolf suckl me sinc otherwis i must have
di
i have heard of such thing said wi doubtfulli but alwai set
them down as winterfir tale but why do you think thi on to be
true perchanc your father found you the dai that you were cast out
i think it to be true becaus in after time when she wa dy my
mother whisper thi tale into my ear she said my father who
himself wa kill by wolv not long afterward told her secretli
for he dare not speak of the matter openlythat when he came upon me
in the forest whither he had gone to seek my bone and if ani of them
could be found buri them he discov me in such a nest as wolv
make when thei bear their young and saw a great grai wolf stand
over me with her teat in my mouth on that had lost her cub mayhap
she growl at him but ran awai and seiz me he also ran and bore
me home thi my mother swore to me
a dy woman fanci said wi
i think not answer pag and for thi reason when for the second
time i wa driven out by the women or rather by henga father whom
thei persuad that i wa a bewitch and unlucki have nowher els
to go and all hand be against me i wander into the wood that
there the wolv might kill me and make an end the dai began to die
and present wolv gather round me for i saw them move between
the tree trunk wait till night fell to spring upon me i watch
them idli care noth sinc i had come there to be their meat
thei drew near when suddenli a great grai shewolf ran up as though to
seiz me then stop and snif at me
thrice she smelt then lick me with her tongu and leap round
rush at those other wolv snarl and openjaw her fur
start up from her back the dogwolv ran awai from her but two
of the shewolv stood be hungri with these she fought tear
the throat out of on and maul the other so that it limp off
howl then she too went awai leav me amaz till i rememb
my mother stori after which i wonder no more be sure that
thi old wolf wa she that had suckl me and knew me again
did you see more of her pag
ay twice she return onc after five dai and onc after six
more dai and each time she brought me meat and laid it at my feet
it wa filthi carrion torn from some dead deer that she had dug up
from beneath the snow but doubtless the best she could find
moreov although she wa thin with hunger and thi wa her portion
still she brought it to me
and did you eat it ask wi astonish
nai why should i who had crept into that hole to die moreov my
stomach turn at the sight of it then you found me and carri me
into your hut and i have met that foster mother of mine no more yet
she still live for more than onc i have seen her ye thi veri
winter i have seen her who now is the leader of all the wolf peopl
a strang stori said wi stare at him sure if you have not
dream it you who slai mani of them should be more tender toward
wolv
not so for did thei not kill my father and would thei not have
kill me yet to thi wolf i am tender as i shall show you for in
payment of what i would do i ask her life
and what would you do ask wi
thi now befor the fire is light i will go down into the forest
and find that wolf for she will know me again and come to me then
when the shout begin and the brute grow frighten she will
follow me and the all the other wolv will follow her and i shall
lead them thither into the trap onli her i will save from the trap
for that is my bargain
you ar mad said wi
if i come back no more then call me mad or if my plan fail but if
i live and it succe then call me wise answer pag with a low
guttur laugh there is yet an hour befor the light of the fire
when the edg of the moon cover yonder star give me that hour and
you shall learn
then without wait for more word pag slip down the rock on
which thei were stand and vanish into the gloom
without doubt he is mad said wi to himself and without doubt thi
is the end of our fellowship
present wait there in the cold frost and watch hi breath
steam upon the still air wi mind went back to thi matter of pag
now that he came to think of it it wa veri strang that all the
peopl believ pag to be a companion of wolv what wa accept by
all he had note wa gener true if on person smelt a fox he
might be mistaken but if everybodi smelt it sure there wa a fox
it wa certain also that pag never had ani fear of wolv and would go
down into the forest when thei were howl all around as quietli as
anoth would walk into hi hut and take no harm wherea from bear
or other wild beast he would run like the rest
further now wi rememb have heard the tale told in hi youth
that when pag wa cast out by hi mother shortli after birth for
some reason that he forgot fifteen dai went by befor hi father
went to seek hi bone to buri them yet he found him live and
strong becaus of whichso ran the taleth peopl held pag to be
not human but a monster sprung from on of those evil spirit that
might be heard howl round the hut at the dead of night
so perhap what pag said wa true perhap hi father had found him in
a wolf den and seen her suckl him perhap too sinc these
beast were known to live mani year especi if the spirit of a
dead man were in them as urk and other ag on declar happen
from time to time both in the case of wolv and of other creatur
such as the great tooth tiger food had been brought to him by that
same wolf when he wa cast out for the second time
well he would learn present meanwhil the moment drew near when
he must light the signal fire
a while later wi look at the moon and saw that the star wa
vanish in the light of it edg then he whisper to foh who now
had come to him and crouch at hi side watch all thing eagerli
as a boi doe foh nod and slip awai to return present with a
smoulder brand that he had brought from a littl fire which wa
burn out of sight farther down the hillsid
wi took it and went to the pile of dri wood that had been prepar
upon the rock where he blew it to a flame and set it among some
powder seawe at the base of the pile the seawe caught readili
as thi sort doe when dry give out a blue light and present the
pile wa aflam then wi bade foh go home to the cave which he
pretend to do but did not for desir abov all thing to see
thi great wolf hunt he hid himself awai behind a rock
think that foh had depart wi crept down to where the old men to
the number of fifti or more under the command of hotoa the slow
speech lai hidden among the stone down wind so that the wolv
might not smell them and near to the mouth of the gulli that save
for a gap in the middl wa built up with a wall of snowcov
boulder as ha been told these men he bade be readi and when the
wolv had gone through the gap and thei heard hi command but not
befor to rush forward each of them carri a larg stone and fill
up the gap so that the wolv could not come out again meanwhil
thei must keep stir the stone lest the frost should fasten them
to the ground
these men mani of whom were shiver with cold or fear or both
listen dulli whaka said that hi heart told him that no good would
come of thi busi hou the unstabl ask if thei could not chang
their plan and go home ngae the magician announc that he had
sought an omen from the icegod whose priest he wa and had dream
a veri evil dream in which he had seen pitok sleep in the belli
of a wolf signifi no doubt that thei were all about to be kill
and eaten new at which pitok moan and wrung hi hand urk the
ag shook hi head and declar that no such plan as thi had ever
been made from the begin at least hi grandfath had never told
him of it and what had not been done befor could not be done now
onli hotoa a man of good heart though stupid answer at length
that the stone were readi and that for hi part he would build them
up if and when the wolv were in the pit even if he had to do so
alon
now wi grew angri
hearken he said the moon is veri clear and i can see all if on
man run be sure i shall note him and shall dash out hi brain now
or later ye the first man who run shall die and he lift hi ax
and look at hou and whaka
after thi all grew silent for thei knew that what wi said that he
would do
present the wolv began to appear look like shadow on the
snow and by two or three lope past with loll tongu and
vanish through the cleft into the pit beyond
stir not whisper wi these ar not driven thei come to eat the
whale flesh as thei have done befor
thi wa true enough for soon from within the pit the watcher
heard the sound of growl and of the teeth of the starv beast
grate on the frozen flesh
then from far awai aros the sound of shout and thei knew that the
driver had seen the fire on the high rock and were at their work a
long time went by thenoh then those watcher saw a terribl sight
for behold the snow slope beneath them grew black with wolv more
wolv than thei had ever countedhundr of them there seem to
be all come on in silenc slowli doggedli like a marshal
host and lo in front of them trot a huge gaunt grai shewolf
and either run at her side hold to her hair or mount on her
back which thei could not be sure becaus of the shadow wa pag the
dwarf pag the wolfman
the watcher gasp with fear and some of them hid their ey with
their hand for thei were terrifi even wi gasp for now he knew
that pag had spoken truth and that wolf milk ran in hi blood as the
wolf crafti live in hi brain
into the shadow of the cleft pass the great grai mother wolf wi
could see her glow ey and her worn yellow fang as she trot
beneath him and with her went pag lo thei enter the gap in the
stone snowcov wall and as thei enter the shewolf rais her
head and howl aloud whereon all the multitud which follow her
that for a moment had seem to hesit rais their head and howl
also make such a sound as the peopl had never heard so terribl a
sound that some of them fell upon the earth swoon for thi wa
the cry of the mother wolf to the pack the call that thei must obei
then the multitud press on after her scrambl upon each other
back to be first into the pit
all were innot on of the hundr remain outsid and the time
had come to close the breach wi open hi lip to utter the command
then hesit for pag wa there in the pit and when the wolv
found that thei were trap certainli thei would tear him to piec
and the mother wolf also which had led them to their death he must
speak and yet pag wa in the pit how could he command the death of
pag oh pag wa but on man and the peopl were mani and if onc
those wolv broke out again mad with rage none would be left
live
to the wall he said hoars and himself lift a larg stone
sprang forward
then it wa that back through the cleft came the great mother wolf and
with her pag unharm he bent down he whisper into the ear of the
shewolf and it seem to them the watcher that she listen and
lick hi face then suddenli like an arrow she sped awai
in her path wa pitok the unlucki who turn to fly with a growl
she nip him tear a great hole in hi side fled onand wa no
more seen
build up cri wi build up
ay build you up echo pag and swiftli if you would see the
sun i go my work is finish and he shambl through them who even
then shrank awai from him
wi rush to the cleft and flung down hi stone as did other a
wolf head appear abov the rise pile he brain it with hi ax
so that it fell backward dead and there wa a sound of it be torn
to piec and devour by those within thi gave them a breath of
time the stone rose higher but now at them came all the weight of
the wolv some were kill or driven back for even the most timid
fought desper with their stone spear club and ax know
that if onc the imprison pack climb or broke through the wall it
would have the masteri of them so some built and other fought while
yet other brought basket fill with damp grit or snow taken from
deep hole which thei pour on to the stone where immedi it
ran down into the crack and froze turn them to a fortress wall
yet some of the wolv got over by climb on to each other back
and leap thenc to the crest of the wall befor it reach it full
height the most of these fled awai to be the parent of other pack
in year to come but certain of the fiercest fought with the men
beyond and mangl them so that on old fellow di of hi wound
in all thi nois and confus suddenli wi heard a cry for help
which caus him to turn round for he thought he knew the voic he
look and by the bright moonlight shine on the snow saw foh hi
son fight a great wolf with a snarl the brute sprang foh bent
himself and receiv the weight of it upon the point of hi flint
head spear down went the lad with the wolf on top of him wi
bound forward think to find him with hi throat torn out he
reach the place too late for both foh and the wolf lai still
put out hi strength he drag the brute awai beneath it lai
foh cover with blood think him dead in an agoni wi lift him
for he love thi boi better than anyon on the earth then suddenli
foh slip from hi arm stood upon hi feet and gasp as hi
breath return to him
see father i kill the beast my spear brokebut see the point
of it stick out of hi back hi teeth were on my throat when all at
onc hi mouth open and he di
get you home said wi roughli but in hi heart he thank the ic
god becaus hi onli son had been save aliv
then he rush back to the wall nor did he leav it until it had been
built so high that it could not be leapt over by ani wolf in the
world nor could it be scale for the topmost stone were set so that
thei curv toward the great pit within there then wi wait till the
damp sand and the snow froze hard and he knew that befor the spring
came noth could stir them
at length the work wa done and in the east broke the dawn of the
short winter dai then wi climb to the top of the wall and look
into the pit beyond it wa still full of dark for the moon had
sunk behind the hill but in the dark he could see hundr of
fierc ey move while the mountain echo with the howl of the
imprison beast
so thei howl for dai the stronger devour those that grew weak
till at length there wa silenc in that darksom place for all were
dead
chapter ix
wi meet the tiger
two dai had gone by for the most of which time wi had slept inde
after thi great battl with the wolv he wa weari almost to death
not with the work or the fight but through amaz at the sight
of pag keep aw fellowship with the great shewolf and agoni of
mind becaus of what he had suffer when he thought that the throat
of foh wa torn out also when he believ that the whole host of the
wooddwel would break through or over the wall and tear him and
hi companion to piec
when at time he woke up from that sleep aaka wa kind to him more
so than she had been sinc henga had murder foa also she wa
proud of hi deed and fame that were in everi mouth and now that he
had risen from hi bed she brought him food and spoke to him softli
which pleas wi who love aaka the wife of hi youth although of
late her face seem to have turn awai from him now while he at
aaka give him hi food piec by piec as wa the fashion of wive
among the tribe moananga join them and began to talk in hi light
manner of that night of fear
all the good of it wa with you brother he said for we tramp
through the forest cut our feet and break our skin against
trunk of tree and bough half buri in the snow for no purpos at
all
did you not see ani wolv ask wi
not on though we heard them howl in the distanc it seem that
thei had all gone on befor led by a certain friend of our who can
charm wolv if what i hear is true and he shrug hi shoulder
yet we saw someth els
what wa that ask wi
we saw the great stripe beast of which we have learn from our
father the tiger with teeth like spearhead a like beast to that
whose skin or what remain of it is your cloak todai which ha
been worn by the chief of the tribe sinc the begin
now thi wa true sinc for gener those who dwelt in the cave
on after anoth wore that cloak though none knew how it had come
to the first of them moreov although tradit told of thi great
tiger beast which wa onc the terror of the tribe hitherto none
live had seen it so that although thei still talk of it men
thought that it race wa dead or had left their land
what did it do said wi much stir as a hunter would be
it appear from between the tree and walk forward boldli leapt
onto a rock and stood there stare at us and lash it tail a
mighti brute tall as a deer and longer we shout think to scare
it awai but it took no heed onli stood and pur like a wildcat of
the wood watch us with it glow ey now in front of it
with other wa the man name finn he whom henga hate and swore to
kill so that he must hide himself in the wood whenc he onli came out
again after you had slain henga suddenli the tiger ceas pur
and fix hi ey on finn finn saw it and turn to run then the
tiger leapt such a leap as ha never been seen right over the head
of the other he leapt land onto the back of finn who fell down
next instant the tiger had him in hi jaw and bound awai with him
as the wildcat bound with a bird which it ha seiz that wa the
last we saw of it and of finn
strang that the tiger should have chosen him who wa hate of henga
the tigerman said wi
ye wi so strang that all the peopl hold that the spirit of henga
ha enter into thi tiger
now wi did not laugh at thi sai becaus it wa the belief of hi
folk that the ghost of an evil man often pass into the shape of some
terribl beast that could not be kill and in that form took
vengeanc upon those whom that man had hate in life or on hi
children therefor he onli said
if it be so it seem that i must guard myself see that if henga
hate finn he hate me ten time more and with good reason as
perhap he know todai well i slew henga and i swear that i will
slai thi tiger also if he troubl us more though whenc the beast
came i cannot guess
at thi moment pag appear whereon aaka who had been listen to
the tale of the death of finn turn and went awai sai over her
shoulder
here come on who perchanc can show you how to lead the tiger into
a trap for what is a tiger but a big stripe wolf
other too shrank to on side as pag advanc becaus although
thei were grate to him for what he had done thei who had alwai
fear pag now fear him ten time more ye even moananga shrank
and made a place for him
fear not said pag mockingli the grai wolf mother ha fled afar
and no more of her kin follow after me and her inde i come from
watch them thei fight and devour each other there in the pit and
er long i think all will be dead for that wall thei cannot climb
or tunnel through
tell us pag said moananga boldli after hi fashion what ar
you a man or a wolf fashion to the shape of a dwarf
you knew my father and my mother moananga and therefor should be
abl to answer your own question yet in all men there is someth
of the wolf and for certain reason that wi ha heard in me perhap
more than in most
so the peopl think pag
do thei moananga if so tell them from me that i am not a wolf that
can be caught in ani trap also that if thei will leav me alon i
will leav them alon but if thei will not then thei mai feel my
fang
how did you lead the wolv pag
why should you ask secret moananga yet if you would know i will
tell you that you mai tell it to other the mother of them all is my
friend i went into the wood and call and she came to me then i
bade her follow me as a dog doe she follow and the rest follow
herthat is all
moananga look at pag doubtfulli and answer
i hold that there is more behind pag
ay moananga there is alwai more behind everyth for those who
can find it we cannot see far and know veri littl moananganot
even what we were befor we were born or what we shall be after we
ar dead
now there wa someth so grim about pag talk that although he wa
curiou moananga ask him no more question onli he said
if there be someth of a wolf in man there mai be someth of man
in a tiger and he repeat to him that tale which he had told to wi
pag listen eagerli and answer
when on cloud pass anoth come the wolv have gone the tiger
follow whether henga dwell in thi beast i do not know but if so
the sooner it is slain the better and he glanc at wi and at foh
who now wa stand by hi father hi arm thrown about him then he
went to fetch hi food for he wa hungri
now from that dai forward the tiger becam as great an ill to the
tribe as the wolv had been although it wa but on and these had
been mani it lurk around the villag in the dark of night and when
light came and peopl crept out of their hut it rush in seiz
now on and now anoth and bound awai with it prei in it mouth
no fenc could keep it out nor would it tread on ani pitfal while
so swift were it movement that none could hit it with a spear it
wa note moreov that all those who were taken had been men whom
henga hate or their children or perchanc women who had been hi
and now were marri to other therefor the peopl grew sure that
in thi tiger dwelt the spirit of henga also ngae the priest and
taren hi wife have taken counsel with the icegod return from
the glacier and declar that thi wa so
ponder these thing wi wa much afraid though more for foh than
for himself certainli soon or late the lad would be seiz or
perchanc hi own turn would come first the peopl live in terror
also and now none of them would come out of hi hut till it wa full
dai much less walk beyond the villag unless there were mani of them
togeth
veri slowli and veri late at length the spring came the snow melt
and the horn deer appear in the wood now wi hope the huge tiger
with the flash teeth would ceas from kill men and fill himself
with venison or perhap go awai altogeth whenc he came wherev
that might be to seek a mate there yet the tiger did none of these
thing almost it seem that it wa the last of it race who could
not mate becaus none wa left live on the earth at least it
stai in the great wood that border the beach live now in on
place and now in anoth moreov it continu to find victim for
between the spring and the first month of summer three of the tribe
were drag awai so that the end of it wa that thei dare not go
out to seek food never be sure but that the stripe beast might
spring upon them from some lair where it lai hid for it seem to
watch all their movement and to know where thei would come
the end of it wa that the peopl gather at the meetingplac and
sent winiwini the shudder to prai wi to speak with them he came
accompani by pag then by the mouth of urk the ag thei address
him sai
thi tiger with the great teeth whom we believ to be henga in the
shape of a beast kill us we demand that you who slew henga and
turn him into a tiger you who ar a mighti hunter and our chief by
right of conquest should slai the tiger as you slew henga
and if i cannot or will not what then ask wi
then if we ar strong enough we will kill you and pag and choos
anoth chief thei repli through winiwini the mouth or if we
cannot at least we will obei you and your law no more but will go
awai from thi place where we have live sinc the begin and seek
anoth home far from the tiger
mayhap the tiger will go with you said pag darkli a grin upon hi
ugli face which sai did not pleas them for thei had not thought
of such a thing befor ani of them could answer howev wi spoke in
a slow sad voic
it seem that among you i have mani enemi he said nor do i
wonder at thi for in sundri wai the past winter ha been most evil
with fiercer cold and longer snow than were ever known whenc have
come much death and sick also a number of us have been kill
first by the wolv which ar now destroi and afterward by thi
tiger nor although we have made offer do the god who live in
the ic yonder help us at all now you tell me that i must kill the
tiger or that you will kill me if you can which by the ancient custom
you have a right to do and find anoth chief or if you cannot
that you will leav me and go henc to seek a new home far from where
you were born
hearken peopl of the tribe i sai to you it is not need that you
should wander awai perhap to find wors danger than those which you
have left soon i go out to seek thi tiger and match myself against
it as i did against henga whose spirit you believ live in it
skin perhap i shall kill it or more probabl it will kill me in
which case you must fight with the beast as best you can or if it
should pleas you better fly awai in ani case it is not need
that you should try to kill me for learn that i am weari of thi
chieftainship a while ago i rid you of a tyrant who murder mani of
you as he did my own daughter and sinc then labour dai and
night i have work for the good of all and done my best to serv
you now as you hold that i have fail and i am of the same mind
for otherwis you would love me better it is my wish to lai down my
chieftainship or if the custom will not allow of thi to stand here
unarm while he whom you mai choos to succe me put an end to my
life with hi club and spear
therefor choos the man that i mai submit myself to you yet if you
will take my last counsel as your chief when you have done so
command him to spare me a littl while that i mai go forth to kill the
tiger if i can then have done thi if perchanc it doe not kill
me i will return and you can deal with me as you will either by
suffer me to live on as on of you such as i wa befor i becam
your chief or by put an end to me
when the peopl heard these word and understood their nobl thei
were asham also thei were confus for thei knew not whom to
choos as chief if inde there wa anyon who would take that
offic moreov pag did not comfort them by announc loudli that
thi new chief would find on to challeng him and that within an
hour name pag himself inde at thi sai thei look asid
or rather those among them who had cast ey of long on the cave
did so for although pag wa a dwarf hi strength wa terribl
moreov he wa a wolfman who could doubtless summon power to help
him from the earth or air perhap the grai wolf mother or ghost
that howl in the night still on voic did call out the name of
moananga whereon he answer
not so fool i stand with my brother wi and tell you that if you
thrust him out it will be becaus the god have made you mad for
where can you find on who is braver or wiser and more honest why do
you not go up yourselv against the tiger and kill it is it
perchanc that you ar afraid
none answer for a while thei murmur togeth confusedli and
then as though with on voic cri out
wi is our chief we will have no other chief but wi
so that troubl end
that night wi and pag took counsel togeth as to how thei might make
an end of the tiger earnestli thei debat but for a long while
could see no light everyth had been tri the brute would not
walk over their most cun pitfal it would not eat the meat
poison with the juic of a certain fish that when rotten wa
deadli it fear no fire and could not be driven awai twice men in
number had gone out to attack it but onc it hid itself and the
next time it charg them smote down a man with it great paw and
vanish after which thei would go no more
you and i must fight it alon said wi but pag shook hi head
our strength is not enough he answer befor you could smite a
blow with your ax it would have kill us both or perchanc if the
ghost of henga dwell in it as all the peopl think it would not
face that ax again but would hide itself
then he walk to the mouth of the cave and idli enough stare up at
that broken tree where as the moonlight show the blacken head of
henga still wa fix it long lock wave in the wind he return
and said
that tiger must be veri lone have none of it kind with which to
talk or mate will you lend me your chief cloak wi if it is lost i
will promis you a better
what for ask wi
that i will tell you afterward will you lend me the cloak and the
necklac of tiger claw

to dig for secret in the dark heart of pag take them and the
chieftainship also if it pleas you for of all these i have had
enough who would that onc again i were a hunter and no more
a hunter you shall be said pag the greatest of hunter now talk
no more to me of tiger for a while lest i should smell them in my
sleep
after thi for sever dai pag wa miss for hour at a time and
when he return at night alwai seem to be veri weari also wi
notic that other thing were miss name hi tigerskin cloak
with the necklac and the head of henga from the broken tree outsid
the cave that now wa noth but skin and bone aaka ask him why
he did not wear hi cloak he answer
becaus winter pass and it grow too warm
i do not find it warm said aaka and why do you not wear the
necklac
becaus in spring the skin is tender and it scratch me
sure pag is a good master to you said aaka himself he could not
have answer with a smoother tongu but where doe pag go so
secretli
i do not know wife i wa about to ask you who watch him well if
you could tell me
that i think i can wi without doubt he goe to hunt with the old
mother wolf as he must do when she call him which is why he come
home so tire i hear that certain of our dead have been dug out of
the snow late and eaten
that ha not been report to me said wi
even a chief is not told everyth especi of those he love
answer aaka and walk awai laugh
two night later pag went to the mouth of the cave and by wet hi
finger and hold it in the wind test it direct veri
carefulli then he came to wi and whisper
will you rise an hour befor dawn and come with me to kill the
tiger
had we not better take other also ask wi hesit
nai onli fool share their meat with stranger let the glori be
our alon now ask me no more in thi place where there ar mani
ear
good said wi i will come with youto kill the tiger or be kill
by it
so a littl more than an hour befor dawn the two of them might have
been seen slip from the cave like shadow but befor he went wi
kiss foh who lai fast asleep at hi side becaus he did not think
to see him again also he look at the place where aaka slept and
sigh sadli he wa fulli arm with hi heavi ax of bright stone
two flinthead spear and a knife also of flint pag likewis
carri two spear and a knife
when thei were clear of the hut and pick their wai toward the wood
by the light of the moon now near her death and of the star pag
said that the gale which had been rage for dai seem to have blown
itself awai and the star shone so brightli that he prophesi fair
weather then wi grew angri exclaim
have done with your talk of the weather and the star and tell me
whither we go and to what end am i a child that you should keep me
thu in the dark
ye answer pag i think that you ar someth of a child out
of whom women can suck secret which cannot be said of me
i return home said wi stop
yet went on pag quietli if you would hear the tale it is short
onli do not stand there like a girl look after her lover but come
on for our time is also short
that i can well believ mutter wi as he walk forward
listen said pag you know the two rock yonder near the edg of
the forest that peopl call man and wife becaus thei ar so close
togeth and yet divid
ye i know them onc we thought of dig a pit there but did not
do so becaus the base of the rock slope inward and doubtless meet
just under the ground
those who would know must first look to see said pag i heard that
talk about the pit heard also urk declar that hi grandfath had
tri to dig on there but could not becaus the rock met then
becaus i knew that urk grandfath must have been a great liaror
perhap it is urk who is the liar i went to try for myself with a
sharpen stake and found that the rock do not meet i found anoth
thing alsothat the tiger us thi path so to scare him awai for a
while i hung up castoff skin garment with a man scent on them
then i set to work and dug my pitfal a veri nice pitfal narrow
like a grave and place sharp stake in it and lit a fire at the
bottom of it to take awai the smell of man and laid pine bough over
it which smell of themselv and cover it with fine sand like to
that around that i carri there in a skin fill with a shell so
that my hand never touch a grain of it and did all other thing
that might deceiv a tiger
thi tiger cannot be deceiv said wi gloomili for is it not as
cun as a man how mani pitfal have we made and ha it not
walk round everi on of them
ye wi that tiger is cun but it is also lone and when it
see that anoth tiger ha cross the pit and is wait for it on
the farther side then perhap it will followat least i hope so
anoth tiger what do you mean
that you shall learn present and now wi i prai you to forget
that you ar a good chief and to rememb that you ar a better
hunter and be silent for then there is naught to fear becaus the
wind blow straight down the cleft and the tiger cannot smell us
present thei came to the pit where there wa a gap in a rocki ridg
at the height of a tall pine which gap wa wider at the top than at
the bottom worn so by ic or water perhap inde at it foot it
did not measur more than two pace across to on side of thi cleft
lai some stone larg stone and among these pag told wi to hide
whisper
be swift and lie close for the dawn is near and if as i hope the
tiger come it will be soon have your ax readi too
what ar you go to do ask wi
that you shall learn be not astonish at anyth you mai see and
do not stir unless you ar attack or i call to you
then pag slip awai into the dark and kneel on the ground
wi watch between a crack in the stone by such light as there wa
have been a hunter from hi youth and therefor accustom to see in
the gloom as wild beast can he perceiv that on the snow
sprinkl bottom of the cleft for here in thi shade place the snow
had not melt appear footmark such as were made by the tiger
pad of which the claw cut line in the snow and thought to himself
that pag wa too late for the brute had alreadi pass here then he
rememb that thi could not be becaus if it had it would have
fallen into the pit which wa dug beneath
whenc then came the footprint he wonder soon he wonder much
more for almost beneath him in the shadow of the rock and on the
hither side of the pitfal appear the tiger yet how could the tiger
be there see that thei had just come to the place across open land
where there were no tree such as grew in plenti on the farther side
of the cleft and must have seen it yet it wa the tiger for he
could distinguish it stripe hide or some of it moreov it
growl as do beast of prei and appear to be tear with it jaw
at someth that lai befor it on the snow just where the pitfal
should end
now thought wi to himself if i spring down suddenli and hit it with
all my strength perhap i mai break thi brute neck or dash out it
brain with a blow of my ax befor it turn upon me
then he rememb that pag had said he must not stir except to defend
himself unless he pag call to him also that pag boast that he
never spoke without a reason so wi stai where he wa and watch
the first grai light of dawn began to gather and though the tiger wa
still hid in the shade it fell upon that which it seem to be
devour someth black and round from which hung hair
by the god it wa the head of henga now wi understood everyth
pag wa the tiger ye insid that skin fashion from the chief
cloak set out to a tiger shape upon a framework of twig cover
with dri grass or seawe wa pag in front of whom lai the dri
head of henga which he pretend to devour and to think of it a few
moment ago he had propos to smite thi sham with hi ax therebi
kill pag the blood of wi ran cold at the thought then he forgot
it and all els for on the farther side of the cleft creep up
slowli belli to ground with wave tail flash fang and
bristl hair appear the monstrou creatur thei had come out to
seek there it stood for now it had risen to it full height which
seem to be that of a deer doubtfulli it stood glare in front of
it with glow ey
the other tiger beneath or rather pag in it skin growl more
fierc tear at the head of henga the monster prick it ear
and growl back but in a friendli fashion then suddenli it seem
to smell the head of henga and glare down at it it step forward
arch it back and leapt as a wolf cub or a puppi leap to seiz
that which it desir for it plai the tiger rose into the air and
with gather paw land onto the cover of the pit which broke
beneath it weight down into the pit it went and after it roll the
head of henga roar upon roar rent the air as the sharp stake which
pag had set at the bottom of the pit sank deeper into the beast
beneath the pressur of it bulk
wi leapt forward from hi hide place and ran forward to pag who
have cast off the stuffedout tiger skin stood stare into the
pit a spear in hi hand wi look down and saw the huge tiger it
ey glow like lamp twist on the stake suddenli it ceas
it aw roar and for on moment thei thought that it wa dead
the next pag cri
bewar the brute come
as he spoke the tiger claw appear over the edg of the grave
like pit follow by it great flat head for it had freed itself
from the stake and with all it mighti strength wa draw itself
from the hole pag drove at it with hi spear wound it in the
throat it caught the handl with it teeth and bit it in two
smite he said and wi brought down the ax upon it head crush
it skulla great blow
yet even thi did not kill the tiger wi struck again and shatter
on foreleg it heav itself upward and now it wa out of the pit it
rear up and smote at him with it uninjur paw wi ran back
bend so that the blow went over hi head and pag slip to on
side the tiger follow wi tower abov him on hi hind feet for
becaus of it hurt it seem that it could not spring wi struck
again with the ax which he wield in both hand and the sharp blade
sank into the beast below the breast he strove to withdraw the ax
which wa firmli fix in the tough hide but befor he could do so
the brute fell on him and down he went beneath it and lai there
cover by it carcass
pag ran up and drove hi remain spear into it side behind the
forearm ye again and again he push with all hi weight upon the
spear then the tiger which had open it mouth to seiz the head of
wi and crush it utter a moan nois it jaw close it head
fell down on to the face of wi it claw contract scatter the
sand a shiver ran through it whole length and it lai still
again pag thrust at the spear drive it in yet deeper until he knew
that it must have pierc the beast heart then he seiz on
forepaw and put out all hi great strength drag at it till
the dead tiger roll over upon it back reveal wi beneath
paint red with blood
pag who thought that he wa dead utter a low cry of grief and as
he did so wi sat up gasp for the breath wa press out of him
ar you torn ask pag
i think not grunt wi i think the claw miss me
perhap after all there ar some god said pag
at least there ar devil answer wi look down at the dead
monster
you will have a fine new cloak a cloak of glori said pag
then it should cover your shoulder answer wi
chapter x
the boat and it burden
wi and pag lean on each other for though neither wa hurt now
after all wa over both felt veri tire walk back to the cave for
with the carcass of the huge tiger thei could do noth by
themselv but first pag shook the seawe and withi with which it
had been stuf out of the chief cloak wherein he had plai the
part of a tiger and sinc wi could not wear it becaus he wa too
filthi with blood and dirt threw it over hi shoulder but the head
of henga he left where it lai it had serv it turn also pag swore
that never again did he wish to have it so close to hi nose and
teeth
when thei reach the hut it wa still so near to the dawn that no
on wa about for sinc the peopl learn that the great tiger
attack at thi hour thei had becom late riser therefor thei
came to the mouth of the cave unnot
here howev thei found some wait for them as aaka have been
awaken earli by foh who came to tell her that hi father wa gone
from their bed rose to look for him for in thi matter aaka wa
strang although so sharp with wi when he wa present she kept a
watch on all hi movement and grew disturb when she could not see
him and did not know where he might be or why he had gone awai thi
mood wa strong on her that morn becaus she wa sure in herself
that danger wa near to him especi when she learn that pag wa
also miss from the cave therefor although the tiger might be on
the prowl she bade foh run swiftli to the hut of hi uncl moananga
and bring him to her
so moananga came and with him tana who would not be left alon in the
hut also other whom he summon for becaus of the tiger if
peopl stir at thi hour when it wa known to be abroad a compani
of them alwai went togeth thei reach the cave and moananga
ask what wa the troubl aaka answer that she desir to know if
thei had seen wi whom she could not find or pag who doubtless wa
with him or if thei knew where he had gone
moananga answer no and spoke calm word to her for she wa much
disturb sai that wi had mani duti to attend of which he told
no on and doubtless on of these had call him awai or perhap he
ad he had gone to the glacier to make prayer to the icegod or to
seek some sign of them
while he wa speak thu foh point with hi finger and behold
out of the morn mist appear wi paint from head to heel with
blood and lean upon the shoulder of pag the dwarf as a lame man
lean upon a stick
not for noth wa i troubl said aaka see wi is wound and
sore
yet he walk well and hi ax is as red as hi skin answer
moananga
then wi came up to them and aaka ask
whose blood is that which cover you husband your own or anoth
man
neither wife answer wi it is the blood of the great tooth
tiger which pag and i have been fight
yet pag skin is white and your is red which is strang but what
of the tiger husband
the tiger is dead wife
now thei stare at him then aaka ask
did you slai it
nai he answer i fought it but i think pag wa it slayer he
made the plan he dug the trap he set the bait and it wa hi spear
that reach the brute heart at last er my head wa bitten off
go look at the tiger skull said pag and see whether wi ax
fit into the hole there look at it forearm also and judg what
weapon shatter it
pag alwai pag is there noth that you can do without pag
husband
oh ye answer wi bitterli perchanc i might kiss a woman if i
could find on who wa fair and gentleheart
why dont you mock aaka
then he went past her into the cave and call for water to wash
himself while pag sat down in front of it and told the tale of how wi
had slain the tiger to all who would listen to him but of hi part in
that plai sai noth at all
led by moananga men went out a score of them or more and carri in
the beast which thei laid down in a place where it could be seen by
everyon that dai all who could stand upon their feet from the oldest
to the youngest of the tribe came to stare at the dead monster which
had work them so much mischief while pag sat by grin and
point out how the ax of wi had shatter it skull and wellnigh
hewn off it great forepaw
but who gave the wound that pierc it heart ask on
oh wi did that too answer pag when the beast charg him with
it last strength he leapt asid and thrust hi spear through it
heart after which it fell on top of him and tri to bite off hi
head
and what did you do all thi time ask tana the wife of moananga
i oh i look on no i forgot i knelt down and prai to the god
that wi might conquer
you lie wolfman said tana for both your spear ar buri in
the beast
perhap answer pag if so it is an art i have learn from
women if you have never li tana for good end or bad then
reproach me but if you have leav me alon
then tana wa silent for although she wa sweet and love it wa
well known that she did not alwai tell the truth
after thi when he wa recov from hi weari and shake and
hi crush rib ceas to ach all the peopl came up and worship
wi who had rid them of the tiger as he had rid them of the wolv
declar that he wa on of the god who had come out of the ic to
save them
so you sai when thing go well and danger pass but when thei go
ill and it hang over your head then you tell anoth tale about
me answer wi smile sadli moreov you give prais where it
is not due while you withhold it where it is due
then to be rid of all thi clamour he slip awai from them and
went out quit alon to walk upon the beach while pag stai behind
to skin the tiger and to dress it hide for now that the wolv were
dead and the tiger wa dead and henga the murder wa dead all
slain by wi man or woman or child might walk the beach in safeti and
alon especi as the bear seem to have gone awai though
whether thi wa from fear of the tiger or lack of food none knew
the great gale from the south which that spring had rage for veri
mani dai almost up to the night when wi went out to fight the tiger
had now quit blown itself out leav behind it a clear grai sky
though of sun that spring there seem to be even less than dure the
year that wa gone inde the air remain veri cold feel as it
doe when snow is about to fall though thi wa not the time for
snow the flower which should have been make the woodland and the
hillsid bright had not yet bloom nor had the seal and the bird
come in their wont number but though the wind wa gone there wa
still a great swell upon the sea and big wave upon which float
block of ic broke sullenli upon the beach
wi walk toward the east present he came to the mouth of the
glacier cleft and though he had not purpos to go up to the face of
the ic or to look upon the shape of the sleeper someth seem to
lead him there inde he felt as if an invis cord wa draw
him toward thi gloomi yet to him sacr spot becaus in it dwelt the
onli god he knew moreov he rememb that dure the mighti
frost of the past winter and especi at the time of the big gale
great nois had been heard in the ic which caus the peopl to
believ the god were stir
he reach the head of the cleft and there poor savag that he wa
cover hi ey with hi hand and kneel down prai after hi
fashion he thank the god becaus thei had deliv him and the
peopl in hi charg from great peril give him strength to kill the
evil henga and by the help of pag to do awai with the most of the
wolv and with the aw tiger that the tribe believ contain the
spirit of henga still linger upon earth he prai also that the
law which he had made might prosper that there might be plenti of
food that foh hi son might grow and be strong ceas to cough
that aaka might be gentl toward him who felt so lone and
companionless and who by the law that he had made wa forbidden to
seek ani other wife lastli he prai that the sun might shine and
the weather becom warm
then as had happen to him befor in thi spot someth seem to
speak in hi heart remind him that he had brought no offer
also that it wa too late to find on especi now that the wolv
were gone and he could not slai a beast as he had done befor and set
it head upon a stone that the god might smell blood
well if so what did it matter how could the blood of wolv be of
ani servic to god and if it were so wa it good to worship be
who rejoic in blood and suffer if thei live and had power must
thei not desir a veri differ sacrific what sacrific a thought
came to him sure that of the heart that of repent for past
evil that of promis to do better a gust of passion seiz him he
flung himself upon hi face mutter
o god let me be the sacrific give me strength to see and
understand to bring bless upon the head of all to protect and
nurtur all if onli for a littl while and then if you will take
my life in payment for your gift
thu prai poor wi and for a moment thought that he wa better than
those among whom he live sinc he knew that not in the heart of on
of them would thi prayer have been born except perhap in that of
pag if pag had believ in anyth which he did not for even then
wi understood that he who doe not believ cannot prai a boi so long
as he think he see someth or smell it or hear it move will
throw stone in the hope that he mai hit it but when he is certain
that there is noth beneath the water or in the tree for how long
will he go on throw the stone now thi wa the differ between
them although he could not see it wi thought that there wa
someth beneath the water or in the tree and therefor continu to
throw hi stone of prayer wherea pag wa sure that there wa
noth at all and therefor kept hi stone and save hi strength
then wi rememb that after all he had no caus to boast himself
he prai for the peopl but why did he do so oh the answer wa
plain it wa not for the peopl and their woe that he wa sorri but
for hi own in which he saw their reflect by the mirror of hi
heart as imag ar seen in clear water hi littl daughter had been
taken from him in a cruel fashion he had aveng her death upon the
murder think thu to satisfi hi soul yet it wa not satisfi
for he had learn that there is no comfort in vengeanc what he
need wa hi daughter not the blood of her butcher therefor he
hope that some land unseen lai beyond that of life where he might
find her and other whom he had love which wa why he prai to the
god he wa sorri for other who had lost their children becaus he
could measur someth of their suffer by hi own but at bottom
he wa most sorri for himself so it wa with everyth by hi own
unhappi he measur that of other and when he fear for them
realli he fear for himself and those he love feel for all with
the ach of hi own heart and see all by the light of hi own ey
these thought crush wi who by help of them now understood that
even the sacrific which he offer for other wa full of
selfish becaus he desir to escap from troubl and at the same
time to earn merit and to leav a hallow name behind him he who did
not know that than thi no higher measur is given to man for if it
were he would ceas to be man and becom a god
of a sudden wi abandon prayer he had thrown the spear of hi mind
at the ski and lo it stood there fix in the ground befor hi
feet sinc he could never get awai from himself what wa the us of
prai let him do those thing that lai to hi hand as best he might
and bear hi burden as far as he could and ceas from importun
help from he knew not whenc he who in thi bitter moment of
understand for a while becam sure that man could not hunt the
god sinc it wa thei who hunt him pai no more heed to hi
petit than he wi did to the groan of ani seal that he
pursu as it strove impot to struggl to the sea where it would
be safe
he rose from the ground to look at the face of the glacier and
discov how far it had move forward dure the fierc winter that
wa gone he stare at it and start back for there in hideou
imageri stood hi own thought portrai in that clear ic he had been
accustom to see the dim form of the sleeper and behind it rather to
on side a yet dimmer form thought to be that of a man who pursu
the sleeper or perchanc of on of the god take hi rest with it
now behold all thi wa chang there stood the sleeper as befor
but by magic or perhap by some convuls of the ic the figur
that had been behind wa now in front ye there it stood with not
more than onc pace length of ic between wi himself and it a weird
and aw thing
it wa a man of that there could be no doubt but such a man as wi
had never seen for hi limb were cover with hair hi forehead
slope backward and hi great jaw stood out beyond the line of hi
flat nose hi arm were veri long hi leg were bow and in on of
hi hand he held a short rough staff of wood for the rest hi sunk
but open ey seem to be small and hi teeth larg and promin
while hi head wa cover with coars and mat hair and from hi
shoulder hung a cloak the skin of some anim of which the forepaw
were knot about hi neck
on thi strang and hideou creatur face there wa stamp a look
of the wildest terror tell wi that he had di suddenli and that
when he di he wa veri much afraid of what had he been afraid wi
wonder not of the sleeper he thought becaus until some movement
of the glacier had thrust him forward dure the past winter he had
been behind the sleeper as though he were pursu it no it wa
someth els that he fear
suddenli wi guess what it wa long long ago thi forefath of the
tribe for know no other men wi thought that so he must be
thousand of winter ago perhap thi man had been fly from the
ic and snow when in an instant thei rush down and swallow him
up so that there he choke and di he wa no god but just a poor
man if inde he were altogeth a man whom death had taken in thi
fashion and whom the ic had preserv with hi stori written on hi
hideou face and flee form
then wa the sleeper a god or wa he some huge wild beast that live
when the man live and perish when the man perish and in like
fashion roar openmouth to the heaven for help so much for the
god if thei dwelt there in the glacier as perhap thei dwelt
everywher it wa not in the shape of thi enorm brute or of the
man who also look like a brute for as wi had never seen an ap he
did not know that thi wa what he realli resembl
whatev their end mai have been as he stare at them a fanci or a
vision came to wi that man wa himselfor all men and the huge
brute behind wa death who pursu and the ic around wa doom which
swallow up both life and death vagu thought of all thi mysteri
got hold of hi untutor mind and overcam it so that present he
turn to creep shiver and terrorstruck from these relic and
emblem of a tragedi he could not comprehend
come to the beach again wi continu to walk eastward past the
smaller hill and icefil vallei for he desir to visit a
certain bai beyond them where the seal were wont to gather when thei
arriv hope that he would see the first of them come up from the
south to breed like the rest of the peopl wi thought more of seal
than he did of anyth els becaus these furnish the most of
their winter food and of the other thing that thei need on he went
till turn a spur of cliff which here ran down to the sea to the
east of the glacier field he came to the bai that wa border by a
wide stretch of white sand and back by a barren rocki plain
ceas to ponder upon the sleeper and the man and the deeper thing
that the sight of them had awaken in hi heart wi search the
shore with hi keen hunter ey and the water of the bai and the
ridg of rock wherebi at low tide it wa almost enclos that ran at
some four spearcast from the shore but not on seal could he see
thei ar even later thi spring than thei were last year he
mutter to himself and wa about to make hi wai homeward when on
the farther side of the ridg where the wave broke he caught sight
of some strang object that wa strand among the surf a long thing
which seem to be point at both end at first he thought that it
might be a dead anim of a sort new to him wash up by the sea and
wa turn to go when the surf lift the object and he saw that it
seem to be hollow and that there lai in it what look to him like a
human form
now wi curios wa awaken and he wish that he could come
nearer thi howev wa imposs for at each end of the ridg of
rock wa open water through which the tide race swiftli or rather
it wa not possibl except by swim out from the shore of the bai
it is true that wi wa a great swimmer but the water wa bitterli
cold for in it still float mani lump of drift ic so cold that
there wa much danger to a swimmer who might moreov be cut or
bruis by the sharp edg of the ic also the swim would be long
for the ridg wa far awai so again he thought that he would go home
and not give himself up to more fanci about someon who lai in that
hollow thing which wa strang to him for wi had never seen a boat
inde he turn to do so and walk a few pace
then for a second time that dai it seem to him as though a rope were
draw him thi time not to the glacier face but to the ridg of
rock and that which lai upon it farther side suppos that there
wa a manor womanyond it seem imposs becaus no other men
or women live except those upon the beach of whom he wa chief what
he saw wa some drift log splinter white by roll upon stone or
perhap a great fish dead and rotten and yet how could he sai that
there were no other men and women he who had just look upon the
corps of a man who must have live thousand of year ago when the
ancient ic that wrap him round wa born in the womb of the distant
mountain whenc it had flow how could he be sure that he and hi
peopl were the onli twoleg creatur on the earth which perhap
wa bigger than thei knew
oh he would go to look for if he did not he would be sorri all hi
life should he be cramp in the cold water and drown or should
the pack ic strike him so that he sank after all it would not matter
veri much then doubtless pag would becom chief or perhap he
would make moananga chief which would pleas the peopl better and
be the whisper in hi ear either of them would look after foh or
if thei did not aaka would especi when he wa gone and she could
no more be jealou becaus the boi love him better than he did her
probabl too there at the bottom of the sea wa peac without fear
or hope question or disappoint also fate wa alwai
behind them as the huge sleeper wa behind that wild hairi creatur
that wa onc a man
so thought wi and as he thought he threw off hi cloak and laid it on
a rock hide the ax beneath it so that if he return no more pag
and the other might learn that the sea had taken him then he plung
into the water veri swiftli lest hi courag should desert him and
struck out for the reef at first that water wa bitterli cold but as
he swam with great stroke stop now and again to push asid the
block of float ic or to feel them with hi hand beneath the
surfac lest on them should be sharp point that would cut him he
grew warmer
also the joi of the quest the hope of adventur caus hi blood to
flow more quickli than it had done there upon the beach where he wa
fill with so mani sad thought and haunt by the memori of the
strang and hideou man with whom he had come face to face in the ic
of the glacier now he felt as he had done when as a boi he had
climb the mountain crag on which none had ever dare to set foot to
rob the great eagl nest and had brought down it young on in a
basket on hi back while the parent eagl scream round him
strike at thi head and tear him which young on he had pinion
and kept for year till at last the dog kill it ye onc more he
wa a fearless boi untroubl by memori of yesterdai or fear for
tomorrow and seek onli what the hour might bring him
at length wi reach the reef uncramp and unhurt crawl onto it
he shook himself as a dog doe then veri cautious pick hi wai
among it stone and peer down at the spot where from the height of
the shore he had seen that strang sharppoint thing in which a
figur seem to be ly it wa gone no there it wa right beneath
him lift up toward him by the send of the surf it wa someth
made by man to float upon the water much larger than he had thought
for five or six peopl could have sat in it hollow it would seem
from a great tree thicker than ani that he knew for there were ax
mark in the redhu wood moreov hi ey had not deceiv him
for behold within thi shape log lai a figur cover with a cloak
or blanket of white fur which hid it all even the head that rest at
the rais end of the log no not quit all for outsid of the cloak
lai a tress of hair long hair yellow as the marsh flower that came
in spring also a white arm and hand which hand grasp a wooden
implement that from it shape he guess must be us to drive the
hollow log through the water
wi stare and stare and while he stare becam awar that thi hand
wa not that of a dead woman for from it delic shape he knew it
to be a woman becaus although blue with cold present the
littl finger move bend itself inward note thi he ponder
for a moment what could he do to swim to the beach bear a
senseless woman wa imposs moreov she would die in the ici
water if she might be brought there at all it must be in that in
which she lai yet to drag that heavi log across the reef wa behind
hi strength therefor there wa but on thing to be done it had
come ashor but a littl distanc from the western channel by which
the sea flow in and out of the bai the tide had turn he note it
as he swam and wa now run shoreward if he push the log to the
channel it would float to the beach he leapt into the surf and
thrust it forward be light it move easili and as it drew but
veri littl water not more than four handbreadth it would seem he
could guid it through the surf and shallow out of reach of the
break wave
push it in front of him present he came to the lip of the race
down which the tide began to run strongli shoreward here he paus a
moment propos to take to the water onc more and swim behind the
hollow tree guid it with hi hand then he rememb that the
water wa dreadfulli coldthat the wai wa long and that befor he
cover it cramp might seiz him so that he would sink and go to find
out the truth about the god and mani other matter
perhap thi might be well for him but if he were drown what would
happen to her who lai there without doubt she who must alreadi be
near to death would die also for except to kill seal of which as
yet there were not ani no on came to thi lone faroff bai or if
perchanc some did and saw a strang woman ly in a hollow tree
thei would run awai think that she wa a witch of the sea such as
wa told of in legend or perhap thei would kill her lest she should
be the bearer of a curs
then he thought to himself why should he not get into the log and
guid it ashor with that which lai in the stranger hand often when
the sea wa calm and the weather warm he like other of the tribe
would bestrid a piec of wood and paddl it by the help of a bough to
a certain sand bank that swarm with fish there to catch them on a
line therefor he could guess the us of what she held and knew how
it should be handl
take the paddl veri gentli from her hand wi enter the cano for
such it wa and seat himself at the woman feet push it off
into the centr of the race here the tide took it and bore it
forward so that all he need do at ani rate at first wa to keep the
bark straight and after thei were out of the race and in the bai with
gentl stroke of the paddl that he dip into the water first on
on side and then on the other as he wa accustom to do when out
fish on a log to drive it shoreward avoid the lump of
float ic
thu thi nake savag man and the shroud woman upon whose face he
had not yet dare to look partli becaus he wa nake and partli
becaus he fear what he might behold beneath that cloaka sea
witch perhap who would drag him into the deep watercam safe to
the shore when a while befor wi had look upon the sleeper in the
ic and the hairi on who seem to flee in front of it in hi heart
he had compar these two to man be hunt of fate in a most
fear form he did not know that fate ha mani shape and that some
of them ar veri fair he did not guess that there stretch senseless
befor him lai hi fate a fate as deadli as the monstrou sleeper
would have been to the hairi man who had live and di thousand of
year ago
chapter xi
laleela
wi leapt to the beach and seiz the cano by a hide rope which wa
attach to it prow drag it over the hard wet sand as be
veri strong he could do easili enough till it wa well abov high
water mark then he ran to the rock and cloth himself swiftli in hi
girdl of dress seal fur and hi hood cloak of grai wolfskin which
he wore when out hunt slip hi hand through the loop of the
ax for after all who knew what might lie beneath that cover
also about hi shoulder he hung the bag in which when he went abroad
he kept food for a dai or two and hi tool for make fire then he
return to the cano and with a beat heart for like all savag
he wa frighten of the unknown drew off the fur wrap from her
who lai senseless and stare down
next instant he stagger back for never had he seen and never had he
dream of a woman so beauti as thi that the sea had brought to
him tall she wa and shape young too and all about her hung the
mat mass of her yellow hair though somewhat blue with cold and
redden where the weather had caught it her skin wa of the
white of snow her face wa oval and her featur were fine and
well cut her ey he could not see becaus thei were shut at which
he rejoic for had thei been open he would have known that she wa
dead but he note the long curl eyelash which lai upon her
cheek also that thei were not yellow like her hair but dark inde
almost black in hue
she wa cloth but in a fashion that wa strang to him for beneath
her breast support by strap across her shoulder wa a long
garment blue in colour made of he knew not what that wa ti in at
the waist with a girdl of fur to which were sewn polish stone and
beauti littl shell that glitter also about her neck wa a
string of amber round into bead and pierc while on her feet were
sandal made fast with broider thong lastli from her shoulder
hung a long cloak also deep blue in colour and of the same soft
unknown stuff as wa her gown and with thi a bag work like the
sandal
ye wi stagger back mutter
the seawitch the seawitch herself she who bring curs no
woman now what sai the talethat such should be thrust back into
the sea take their curs with them i will thrust her back into the
sea
he drew near again and touch her cheek with hi finger tip as
though expect to find it vapour which he did not for he ask
himself
thi on ha flesh like women have seawitch flesh like a
woman
just then the seawitch shiver and made a littl moan nois
and can thei shiver went on wi thei who ar said to live upon the
ic sure first i should warm her who can suffer and bring her back
to life i can alwai kill her afterward if i find that she is a witch
and not a woman that is unless she kill me
he look about him at the back of the beach wa a slope cliff of
soft stone and in it a littl cave hollow out by water inde a
spring of pure water bubbl besid it of which wi had often drunk
when he shelter in thi cave weari with the hunt of seal now
he bethought him of thi place and stoop down encircl the sea
witch shape with hi strong arm lift her and although she wa
heavi if somewhat wast perhap with want and cold carri her
past the beach to the cave where he laid her down upon a bed of dri
seawe which he himself had us at the last seal hunt then he
began to rub her hand and arm and as still she did not wake he
lift her again and held her against hi breast that she might gather
warmth from him
still she swoon on although he clasp her fast so onc more he
laid her down and cover her with hi cloak and her own bethought
him of anoth plan in thi cave amongst other thing us by the
hunter wa a store of driftwood for make fire on which to cook
seal meat wi took from hi bag hi fire stick and set on
between hi feet and on it a pinch of dry touchwood powder from hi
pouch twirl the sharppoint hardwood rod between the palm of hi
hand more quickli perhap than ever he did befor the spark
appear the touchwood light wi blew on it and on littl piec of
crumbl seawe that he ad till there wa a tini flame on which
he place more dri seawe and more and more then he set the
burn seawe beneath the wood that he had built up readi leav a
hollow in it centr and present there wa a great blaze
he paus admir hi own work after hi simpl fashion and
wonder dimli why two piec of wood rub togeth produc fire
which if it were allow to grow and spread would burn a forest as
everi dai he wonder about mani thing that he could not understand
then bring hi mind back to the matter with which he had to deal
he lift the seawitch and laid her down upon her fur rug quit close
to the fire be care first to arrang the mass of her tumbl
hair so that no spark could fall among them thu she lai a while the
heat beat on her and her beauti face illumin in the strong
light of the flame while wi watch her entranc wonder whether
she would live or die he hope that she would live and yet he felt
that if she di perhap it would be better for him for then he would
be left with the compani of a marvel memori yet without fear of
troubl to be born
which wai will you have it ask wi of fate and sat still by the
fire await the answer
present it came for the seawitch wa strong and did not mean to
die she need noth but warmth to call her back to life and on
hi breast and by hi fire wi had given her warmth she open her
ey and with a littl catch of the breath wi note that thei were
larg and darknot black but of the hue of those woodland flower
that we call violet and veri tender next she sat up rest her
weight upon on hand and stare at the fire mutter someth in a
soft voic and hold her other hand toward it thu she remain a
while drink in it gloriou warmth then began to look about her
first out toward the sea then round the littl cave
so her ey fell upon wi a dark massiv figur a perfect shape of
develop manhood who now wa on hi knee bend toward her with hi
hand outstretch a littl silent motionless like to the statu of
on who is lost in prayer she start then began to studi him with
those great ey of her slowli her glanc travel up and down him
rest for a long while upon hi face then it fell upon the shine
ax on hi wrist and for a moment grew fear back from thi ax it
flew to hi face and read there that she had noth of which to
be afraid for it wa a most earnest kindli face wild enough but not
illlook after it fashion she shook her head and smile whereon
in a slow and doubt fashion he smile back at her
next she touch her lip and her throat with her long finger for a
moment wi wa puzzl then he understood leap up he ran from the
cave and at onc return with hi join hand full of water for
these were hi onli cup she smile again nod then bent her head
and drank the water till all wa gone and by a littl sign ask for
more thrice he went and thrice return till at last her thirst wa
satisfi
again she lift her finger thi time lai them upon her teeth
and again wi understood seiz hi bag he drew from it a hand of
dri codfish and to show that it wa good took a littl piec
chew and swallow it she consid thi food doubtfulli show
him that it wa on to which she had not been accustom then
overcom by hunger accept a fragment and made trial appar
she like it well enough for she ask for more and more till she had
eaten a good meal after which she sign to him to bring her anoth
drink of water
by the time thi strang feast wa done the light began to fail she
note it and point to the sky then spoke ask some question but
what she said he could not understand nor could she understand what
he said to her now wi wa much perplex night fell and the villag
wa far awai nor wa it safe to try to walk thither in the dark
becaus of wild beast and other danger
moreov thi seawitch must be veri tire and need rest if witch
ever rest so he sign to her to lie down to sleep and made a bed
for her of dry seawe near to the fire also take more seawe
he pile it up outsid the mouth of the cave and by point first to
himself and then to it show her that he would sleep there she
nod to tell him that she understood whereon wi left her for a
while and by the light of the dy dai walk some distanc round
the spur of the cliff which almost encircl the bai and beyond it to
discov if perchanc pag had follow him track hi footstep as
sometim he did
but pag who wa work on the skin of the tiger and thought that wi
would return at nightfal had not done so therefor find neither
pag nor anyon els wi walk back again come to the mouth of the
cave he peep in and saw that the seawitch had lain down and wa
asleep or at ani rate that her ey were close he went awai and
cover himself with seawe lai down also but sleep he could not
for it wa cold there outsid the cave and he wa hungri who would
not touch the dri fish becaus the seawitch might need more of it
at ani moment and the suppli wa small inde that he might not
fall into temptat he had left the bag in which it wa carri at
her side
yet perhap cold and hunger would not have kept him awak who wa
hardi and like all savag accustom to privat perhap it wa
the thought of the strang adventur that had befallen him and of the
wonder beauti of the woman creatur whom he had save from death
that is if she were a woman and could die also of all that these
thing might mean to him which caus him to toss from side to side
with open ey
alreadi he knew that whatev chanc even if she were taken awai as
swiftli and as strang as she had come he would never be abl to
forget thi witch of the sea who even now seem to draw hi heart
toward her and if she were not taken awai what then with what ey
would the peopl look on her and how would aaka receiv her and
where wa she to live in the old dai befor the make of the new
law it would have been simpl for if she were will then there
wa noth to prevent him the chief or inde ani other man from
take a second wife and even if she were not will she might pass
as such and have the shelter of the cave but there wa the new law
and he had sworn an oath that might not be broken for if it were
shame mockeri and disast would come upon him and perhap to
other
thu muse wi from hour to hour strive to climb hi slipperi mount
of doubt and fear first from thi side and then from that and alwai
fail until hi head swam and he gave up the quest twice he rose
and crept into the cave to replenish the fire lest that fair sleeper
should grow cold thi he did with hi ey turn from her becaus
accord to the custom of the peopl it wa not seemli that he
should look upon a maiden while she lai asleep yet although he did
not look at her he wa sure that she look at him for he could
feel or thought that he could feel her ey upon him
after hi second visit to the cave he did at length sink into a
troubl sleep onli to be awaken suddenli glanc upward but
without stir he saw what had awaken him it wa the seawitch
who stood there tall and state consid him with earnest ey
he lai quit still feign slumber till at length have as he
thought made up her mind that realli he wa asleep she move a
littl wai and look upward search the ski present she found
what she sought for between a rift in the cloud appear the faint
shape of the wane moon thrice she bow to it then kneel down
with an uplift hand spoke aloud make some sweetvoic prayer
evid she is a witch thought wi for she worship the moon
which no on doe among the peopl and yet is it more witchlik to
prai to the moon that give light than to kneel and make offer
befor the icegod and him who sleep in the ic perhap if she saw
me do that she would sai that i wa a wizard
she rose again bow thrice turn and glanc at wi as though in
farewel and glide awai across the beach
she is go back into the sea as a witch would well let her go
for perhap it is better thought wi again
she came to the cano and stood by it think then she bent herself
and push at it but by now it had sunk into the wet sand and be
waterlog wa too heavi for her to move
i will help her said wi and rise he follow her
she look at him without astonish and appar without fear it
wa as though she knew alreadi that he would never harm her by sign
he made it clear that if she desir it he would bale out the cano
and push it into the water for her which seem to surpris her a
littl most earnestli she studi hi face note perhap that it
wa veri sad and that what he offer to do wa not becaus he wish
to be rid of her then mutter some word and wave her arm she
look upward again at the dy moon like on who seek a sign
present she came to a decis for suddenli she shook her head
smile a littl and take him veri gentli by the hand led him back
toward the cave which she enter leav him without
so the witch mean to stai thought wi if so it is her own
choic for i have done my best to help her back to the sea
dai came at last grai and dull as all the dai seem to be that
year but without snow or rain the witch appear at the mouth of the
cave and beckon to wi who sat shiver without for a littl while
he hesit then enter to find that she had heap wood upon the
fire which burn glorious in front of it she sat upon the seawe
of her bed that she had gather to a pile chang inde from what
she had been when first he saw her ly at the bottom of the hollow
log
look at her he thought that she must have wash herself at the
spring befor he saw her prai to the moon for there wa no longer
ani brine upon her face or arm also her blue cloak and other
garment were dry and to hi sight who had never seen such robe
splendid moreov she wa draw through the mass of her yellow
hair someth with mani sharp point made of horn or bone which
doubtless she had taken from her bag a new thing to wi for comb
were unknown amongst the peopl though now when he look upon it
and saw it us he wonder that thei had not thought of them befor
while she wa still engag upon thi task and the long yellow wave
hair that had been so matter and tangl separ itself till it
hung about her glitter in the firelight a garment in itself that
hid her to the waist wi stood befor her awkwardli for he wa
amaz then he bethought him that by now she must be hungri again
and lift hi bag that lai near by he pour out more of the
shred codfish and offer it to her she began to eat heartili
enough till some thought seem to strike her and she point first
to the codfish then to wi mouth also lower down sai as plainli
as sign could do that he too must be hungri
he shook hi head pretend that thi wa not so but she would not
be deceiv and held out a piec of the fish toward him refus to
eat ani more until it wa swallow the end of it wa that togeth
thei finish all remain in the bag eat altern
it wa just as wi wa offer the last fragment to the seawitch
that pag appear at the mouth of the cave and stood stare at them
outlin against the bright background of the fire as though he
believ them to be ghost
the seawitch glanc up perceiv thi squat bowleg form
great head and ugli oneei face and for the first time wa
frighten at least she grasp wi arm and look at him in
inquiri whereon not know what els to do he smile pat her
hand and spoke to pag in a command voic of which she understood
the tone if not the word
what ar you do here wi ask
i wonder answer pag reflect for in thi cave there seem
to be no place for me still if you would know i follow your
footprint hither fear lest harm had befallen youa i think it
ha he ad still more reflect fix hi on bright ey upon
the seawitch
have you brought ani food with you ask wi who to tell the truth
desir to fend off explan for a while if so give it to me
for thi maiden and he nod at the seawitch ha fast long and
is still hungri
how do you know that she is not marri and that she ha fast
long ask pag inconsequ ad can you talk her languag
no answer wi seiz upon the last part of the question and
ignor the rest i found her float in a hollow log which li
yonder on the beach and brought her back to life
then you found someth that wa worth find wi for she is veri
beauti said pag though what aaka will sai about her i do not
know
nor do i answer wi rub hi brow or the peopl either
perhap she is a witch whom you would do well to kill urk and ngae
tell of such wi
perhap pag but witch or woman i do not mean to kill her
i understand that wi for who could kill anyth so love look at
her face and shape and hair and those great ey
i have look at them alreadi repli wi with irrit ceas
your foolish talk and tell me what i am to do
pag ponder a while and repli
i think that you had better marri her and tell the peopl that the
icegod or the seagod or ani other god gave her to you which
inde thei seem to have done
fool how do i know that she would marri me who am so far beneath
her also there is the new law
ah said pag i alwai misdoubt me of that law and now i
understand why i did so well if you will not kill her and will not
marri her you must bring her to the villag and sinc she cannot
live with aaka or in the cave or in ani place where there is anoth
woman you must set her in a hut by herself there is a veri fine on
empti quit near the mouth of the cave so that you could look at her
whenev you like
wi who wa think of other thing ask in an absentmind wai
what hut wa empti
that of rahi the miser who you rememb di last week as some
said from fear of the tiger but as i believ of grief becaus you
order him to divid up hi fish hook and flint knive with those
who had none
ye i rememb said wi and by the wai have you got the fish
hook
not yet wi but i shall have them soon for i am sure that old woman
who live with rahi and who ha run awai from the hut buri them in
hi grave as he order her to do present i will catch her and
find out meanwhil there is the hut all readi
ye said wi the women who nurs the children in the cave can look
after thi seawitch
pag shook hi head doubtfulli and remark he did not think that ani
woman would look after her as the young on would be jealou and the
old on afraid
especi he ad as you sai that she is a witch
i sai no such word exclaim wi angrili seawitch i name her
becaus she came out of the sea and i know no other
or becaus she is a witch suggest pag still let us try to
learn how she call herself
ye said wi it is well to do that for if the women refus her i
shall give her into your care
i have known wors task answer pag then he turn to the sea
witch who all thi while watch them steadili guess that thei
were talk of her and clap hi hand as though to awak her
which wa not need next he tap wi upon the breast and said
wi then he tap hi own breast and said pag sever time he
did thi then tap her arm and point hi finger at her look
a question
at first she seem puzzl but after the third repetit of the
tap and the name she understood for she smile a quick bright
smile then point at each of them repeat wii paag
lastli she set her finger on her breast and ad laleela
thei nod and exclaim togeth laleela whereon she nod
back and smile again repeat laleela then thei talk about
the cano and take her to it show her by sign that thei
propos to hide it in the cave to which she seem to assent
so have empti the water out of it thei drag the cano to the
cave and after pag had examin it with much interest for in thi
strang and us thing he saw a great discoveri thei hid it beneath
pile of seawe buri the paddl of which thei found two
beneath the sand of the cave thi done wi took her by the hand and
as best he could show her that she must accompani them at first
she seem afraid and hung back but present shrug her shoulder
sigh look imploringli at wi as though to ask him to protect her
and walk forward between them
an hour or more later aaka moananga tana and foh who were
watch on the outskirt of the villag be frighten becaus wi
had not return caught sight of the three of them walk toward
them

glacier mountain there ar father and pag and a beauti on
beauti she is inde said moananga while hi wife stare open

come to bring evil upon our head
tana watch thi tall stranger advanc with a glide step across
the sand note her blue cloak and amber necklac her yellow tress
and when she came nearer her great dark ey set in a face that wa
pink as the line of a shell then she said
you ar right aakaher come a witch if not of the sort you mean
such a witch as you and i wish that we could be
your mean ask aaka
i mean that thi on will draw the heart of all men after her and
earn the hate of all women which is what everyon of us would do if
she could
so you sai said aaka but i hold otherwis
yet you will walk the same road as the rest of us although you hold
your head sidewai and pretend that it is differ you who tell us
that wi is noth to you and who treat him so badli and yet alwai
watch him out of the corner of your ey said tana who had never
love aaka overmuch and wa veri fond of wi

the stori is long wife but the heart of it is that i saw her
float in a hollow log yesterdai and swim out brought her to
shore in the bai of seal

she must be becaus thei of the tribe were the onli peopl who live

stood in the ic with the sleeper but if he were a man of which thei
were not sure doubtless he wa on of their forefath therefor

and other garment the broider sandal on her feet the amber
necklac on her breast and everyth els about her not forget
her larg dark ey liquid and soft as a deer yet somewhat
scorn then of cours thei knew that thei were right and that
thi wa in truth a witch for no woman could look like that thei
stare thei gape thei point some of the children ran awayher
wa proof of the worstso did certain of the dog that bound
forward bark but on see and smell that at which thei bark
had turn tail and fled as it wa their custom to do from ghost who
pelt them with invis stone so a dirti unkempt halfcloth
crowd thei stare on while guard on either side like a captiv by
wi and pag laleela glide through them glanc now to right and now
to left with unchang face and sai noth
at first thei were silent then when she had pass and with her the
fear that she would shoot a curs at them with a glanc of those dark
ey whisper debat broke out among them as huddl togeth thei
follow on her footstep
she is a veri ugli witch said on woman who ha hair the colour
of sunlight and such long arm
i wish you were as ugli answer her husband rude and thu the
argument began to rage all the women and some of the old men hold
that she wa vile to look on while the young men also the children
as soon as thei grew us to the sight of her thought her beauti
where will wi take her ask on
nowher answer urk the ag becaus she will vanish awai and
as the point wa disput hastili invent a tale
hi grandfath he said had been told by hi grandfath that such
a witch as thi probabl the same witch sinc witch never grew
old had visit the tribe come to the shore stand upon an ic
floe that wa push by white bear with their nose know her for
what she wa the peopl had tri to kill her with stone but when
thei threw the stone these fell back upon their head and kill
them also the bear attack them so she came ashor and sat in the
cave for six dai sing till the chief son a bold and dissolut
youth fell in love with her and tri to kiss her whereon she turn
him into a bear and mount on hi back went out into the sea again
and wa no more seen
now some believ thi tale and some did not yet it work well for
laleela sinc all made up their mind that thei would be on the safe
side and neither try to stone nor to kiss thi witch lest thei also
should be turn into bear or otherwis come to harm
when thei drew near to the cave aaka and moananga overtook them also
tana who have spread the new had rejoin her husband veri
breathless
what ar you go to do with the witch husband aaka ask
look at her sidewai
i am not sure he answer then ad in a hesit voic
perhap you wife would take her into our old hut see that now
you sleep in the cave and ar onli there dure the dai
not so answer aaka firmli have i not enough troubl that i
should add a witch to them also now that the winter is gone i who
hate that cave and the cry of the children intend to sleep in the
hut again
wi bit hi lip and stood think
brother broke in moananga we have two hut side by side and in
the second on onli keep our food thi seawoman might live in it
and
he got no further for tana cut him short
what ar you sai husband she ask that hut is need for the
dri fish the firewood and the net also by me for the cook of
our food
then wi walk on leav moananga and tana disput at the mouth
of the cave stood those women who tend the girl children that would
have been cast out to perish but were save under wi new law some
of these were young and nurs the children at the breast while
other were old and widow who watch them when the nurs were not
there address them wi bade them choos on of their number to
wait upon and cook for thi stranger from the sea thei heard thei
look at the stranger and then thei ran awai into the cave or
elsewher so that wi saw no more of them now wi turn to pag and
said
all thing have happen as you told me and the women refus her
from the sea who is name laleela and come we know not whenc what
is to be done
pag spat upon the ground pag stare upward with hi on ey pag
look at laleela and at wi then he answer
when a cord is knot and cannot be unravel the best thing is to
cut it through and knit up the end afresh take the witch into the
cave and look after her yourself wi as aaka and the other will not
receiv her and she cannot be left to starv or if thi doe not
pleas you kill her if she can be kill
neither of these thing will i do answer wi into the cave she
cannot come becaus of my oath starv she shall not for who could
refus food even to a dog that creep hungri to the hut door kill her
i will not it would be murder and bring the sky onto our head
ye wi though if she were old and hideou the sky might remain
where it is sinc perhap for an ancient hag it would not fall but
as all these thing ar so what next
thi pag take her to the hut of rahi who is dead command some of
my servant men not women to make it readi for her to light fire
and to furnish food from my store then go you and dwell in the
outhous against the hut which wa rahi workshop where he shape
flint and the place where he kept hi good and trade in them and
by dai and night be the guard of thi beauti on whom the god have
sent to us
so i am to becom a witch nurs well i thought that would be the
end of the stori said pag
thu it came about that laleela the beauti on who had risen from
the sea went to dwell in the hut of rahi the dead miser and there
wa tend by pag the dwarf the hater of women without a word she
went patient submit to all thing as on who feel herself to
be swept along by the stream of fate and wait for it to bear her
whither it will care littl how that journei might end pag too
went patient to fulfil hi strang and unaccustom task of guard
and servant to on whom all the tribe held to be a witch provid
for her need teach her the custom of the peopl and protect
her from everi harm all these thing he did not onli to pleas wi
but for a certain reason of hi own he who saw farther than the
rest except perhap wi himself understood from the first that thi
woman wa no witch but on of some peopl unknown to them he saw
also that thi unknown peopl had mani art which were strang to him
and he desir to learn these art also where thei live and
everyth els about them of what wa the blue cloak made how came
it that the stranger woman travel across the sea in a hollow log
and how wa that log made fit to bear her what knowledg wa hid in
her which she could not utter becaus her tongu wa differ all
these thing and mani other pag who wa athirst for wisdom desir
to learn therefor when wi command him to be the guid and
companion of laleela the risenfromthesea he obei without a
word
strang wa the life of laleela there she sat in the hut and cook
the food that pag brought to her after new fashion that were unknown
to him or sometim she walk abroad follow and guard by pag
take note of the wai of the peopl and after she had learn
these up and down upon the beach with her ey ever fix upon the
sea look southward
or when the weather wa bad by sign she caus pag to give her
dress skin and sinew also splinter of ivori from the tusk of
the walru these splinter she fashion into needl bore an ey
in the head of them with a sharp and heat flint and thread the
sinew through them began to sew in a fashion such as pag had never
seen of thi sew he told the women of the tribe who gather in
front of the hut watch her with amaz and later prai pag to
ask of the witch to make them needl like her own which she did
smile till there wa no more ivori
then pag sinc he could not understand her began to teach her hi
own languag which she learn readili enough especi after wi
came to join in the lesson within two moon inde she could ask
for what she want and understand what wa said to her and within
four be quick and clever could talk the tongu of the peopl well
enough if but slowli
thu at last it came about that wi and pag learn as much of her
histori as she chose to tell them which wa but littl she said that
she wa the daughter of a great on the ruler of a tribe that could
not be count who live far awai to the south thi tribe for the
most part dwelt in hous that were built upon treetrunk sunk into
the mud in the water of a lake though some of them made their home
upon the shore of the lake fish and game were their food also thei
cultiv certain herb the seed of which thei gather and at
after grind them between stone and make them into a past that
thei cook in clai heat with fire thei had implement also and
weapon of war beautifulli fashion from flint ivori and the horn
of deer and thei wove cloth such as that of her garment from the
wool of tame beast and dy it with the juic of herb differ
from those that bore the seed which thei at
moreov where thei live although much rain fell the sun shone
more brightli and the air wa warmer than here in the home of the
tribe
to all of these tale gather painfulli word by word wi and pag
listen with wonder then at last wi ask
how come it o woman laleela that you left a land where you were so
great and where you live in such plenti and comfort
i left it becaus of on i hate and becaus of a dream thei
understood her to answer
why did you hate thi on and what wa the dream ask wi
she paus a while as though to master hi question which she seem
to be translat in her mind then answer
the on i hate wa my father brother my father wa go awai
by thi she meant dy the brother wish to marri me and becom
king i hate him take boat with much food i row down river to the
sea at night
wi nod to show that he understood and ask again
but what of the dream
the dream told me to go north she repli a great wind blow me
north for dai and dai till i fall asleep and you find me
why did the dream tell you to go north ask wi with the help of
pag
she shook her head and answer with a set face
ask of the dream o wi nor would she sai ani more
from thi time forward laleela began to learn the languag of the
tribe veri fast so that soon she could speak it quit well for she
wa quick and clever and pag who wa also clever taught her
continu in the even when hi work wa done wi would come to
her hut and sit there with pag he ask her mani thing about
her peopl and her countri in answer she told him that it wa much
warmer than hi own though there wa a great deal of rain if littl
snow also that it lai a long wai off for she had been dai and
night in the boat driven by the gale befor she fell asleep
could you find your wai home ask wi
i think so she answer becaus all the time i wa seldom out of
the sight of the shore and i mark the headland and know the
mountain between which the river run that lead to my countri i
mean that i should know all thi if onc i were out of the ic that
float upon your sea for it wa after i pass the last headland and
came across open water into the ic that i fell asleep
then that headland cannot be so veri far awai said wi for if it
were the cold would have been your death befor i found you
so thi talk end but wi thought much of it afterward and often he
and pag spoke togeth of the matter
a littl while later laleela began to grow restless and to sai that
she lack work she who had been a big woman among her peopl with
much to do
pag thought over her word for a while then on dai when wi wa out
upon some busi he took her to the cave and show her the littl
girl infant which were nurtur there tell her their stori how
thei had been cast out to perish or rather how thei would have been
cast out had it not been for wi new law
your mother ar veri cruel she said in my countri she who did
thi would herself be cast out
then she took up some of the infant and after look them all over
said that thei were illtend as though by hirel and that two of
them were like to die
sever have di said pag
now although thei did not see him wi have return to the cave
stood in the shadow watch them and listen to their talk
present he step forward and said
you ar right laleela these babe need more care after the first
few week their mother neglect them i think to show that thei were
fate to die and that for thi reason thei wish to cast them out
nor do the other women nurs them as thei should yet i am helpless
who lack time to see to the busi and when i complain find all
the women leagu against me will you help me with these children
laleela
ye wi she answer though if i do so the women of your tribe
will becom even more bitter against me than thei ar now why doe
not your wife aaka see to the matter
if i walk on wai aaka walk anoth answer wi sadli see now
he ad i make you laleela the strangerfromthesea head nurs
of these babe with author to do what you will for their welfar
thi i will proclaim and with it my word that ani who disobei you in
your duti shall be punish
so laleela the witchfromthesea becam the mother of the cast
out with other women set under her and fill that offic well
there she would sit by the fire among these littl creatur feed
them with such food as wa known to thi peopl and in a low sweet
voic sing song of her own countri that were veri pleasant to
hear at least wi thought them pleasant for often he would come into
the cave and seat in the shadow would watch and listen to her
think that she did not know he wa there though all the while she
knew thi well enough at length find out that she knew he came
forward from the shadow and seat on a log of wood would talk to
her who by now understood hi languag
thu he learn much for though she would not speak about herself in
broken word she told him of her countri and of how around it live
mani other peopl with whom thei made war or peac which astonish
him who had believ that the tribe were the onli men upon the earth
also she told him and pag of such simpl art as thei practis
whereof these heard with wonder but of why she fled from these folk
of her trust herself to the sea in an open boat to be driven
wherev the wind would take her she would or could tell him littl
moreov when he ask her whether she wish to return to her own
countri she answer that she did not know
then after a while wi began to talk to her as a friend and to tell
her of hi own troubl though of aaka he said noth at all she
listen and at length answer that hi sick had no cure
you belong to thi peopl chief she said but ar not of them
you should have been born of my peopl
in everi compani on walk quicker than the rest answer wi
then he find himself alon said laleela
not so becaus he must return to guid the other
then befor the hilltop is gain night will overtak them all
said laleela
if a man gain that hilltop what can he do by himself
look at the plain below and die at least it is someth to have
been the first to see new thing and some dai those who follow in hi
footstep will find hi bone
from the time that wi heard laleela speak thu he began to love her
with hi heart and not onli for her beauti sake as he had alwai
done sinc first he look upon her in the boat
soon aaka note all thi and laugh at him
why do you not take the witch to yourself as it is law that you
should do she ask for whoever heard of a chief with onli on
wife i shall not be jealou of her and you have but a singl child
left
becaus she is far abov me he answer moreov i have sworn an
oath upon thi matter
that for your oath said aaka snap her finger
yet when she spoke thu aaka did not tell all the truth as a wife
she wa not jealou of wi becaus of the custom of her peopl yet in
other wai she wa veri jealou becaus in old time she and no other
had been hi counsellor then she becam bitter toward him becaus he
set their children befor her and left him to go hi own wai thereon
he turn to pag and made a friend of him and hearken to hi word
and for thi reason she hate pag now the witchfromthesea had come
with her new wisdom which he drank up as thirsti sand drink up water
and behold she hate her even more than she had done pag not
becaus she wa fair but becaus she wa clever
moreov although he had like laleela well enough at first and
guard her as her friend pag began to hate her also and for the
same reason the truth wa that notwithstand hi fault which
were mani wi wa on of those men who is belov by all who ar near
to him even when thei do not understand him so much so that those
who love him grow jealou of each other but thi wi himself never
knew ani more than pag did that it wa becaus he enter into the
heart of all read them and their joi and sorrow that he drew
the heart of all after him
so wi made a friend of laleela tell her hi troubl and the
closer he drew to her the farther awai move aaka and pag laleela
listen and advis and comfort and be a woman in her heart
wonder why he did not come still nearer though whether or not she
would have been glad if he had she did not know at least she would
have wonder had not wi told her of the new law that he had made
under which becaus women were so few among the tribe no man might
take more than on wife and of the oath that he had sworn that thi
law he would keep himself call down upon hi head the curs of the
icegod whom he worship should he break it and not on hi own
onli but also upon those of the peopl
now laleela did not believ in the icegod becaus she wa a moon
worshipp yet she did believ that a curs invok in the name of
on god wa just as terribl as that invok in the name of anoth
in fact she put more faith in the curs than she did in the god
becaus if the god were invis alwai evil could be seen
therefor she wa not angri becaus wi who wa so near to her in
mind still remain as far awai from her as though he were her
brother or her father nor did she try to draw him closer as had she
wish she knew well enough that she could do
meanwhil it is to be told that thi year all thing went ill with
the tribe there wa no spring and when the time of summer came the
weather remain so cold and sunless that alwai it felt as though
snow were about to fall while the wind from the east wa so bitter
that but littl could grow moreov onli a few seal appear from
the south to breed not enough to furnish the food of the peopl or
their garment for the winter with the duck and other wild fowl and
the fish especi the salmon the stori wa the same so that had
it not been for the chanc that four whale of the smaller sort
come in with a high tide were left strand in the bai which
whale thei cut up preserv their flesh as best thei could by
smoke it and otherwis there would have been littl for them to
eat until the spring of anoth year
at the cut up of these whale also at the collect of all food
that could be found wi work veri hard yet the peopl who had been
accustom to plenti in the summer season howev tight thei must
draw their belt in winter murmur and walk about with sullen
downcast face grumbl and ask each other why such troubl
should come upon them the like of which even urk the ag could not
rememb then a whisper began to run from ear to ear among them that
it wa becaus the beauti witchfromthesea had brought evil on
them out of the sea chang the face of heaven and drive awai the
seal and the fowl and the fish that would not come where no sun
shone
if she were gone said the whisper the sun would shine again and
the beast and bird would return and their stomach would be full and
thei could look up to the ridgepol of their hut and see them
bend beneath the weight of the winter food as thei us to do in
the old dai why could she not go back into the sea in her hollow
log or if she would not why could she not be cast out thither
live or if need bedead thu thei said on to anoth by sign
or speak in hint but as yet whatev he might guess wi knew
noth of their talk
chapter xiii
the lesson of the wolf mother
on a certain dai aaka saw pag shambl past her hut hi ey fix
upon the ground
the wolfman is sad she said to herself and i know why he is sad
it is becaus wi up there at the cave is take counsel with that
yellowhair laleela about big matter and ask no help from him
thu she thought then call to pag to come to her and offer him a
dish of food mussel cook in a shell pag who wa hungri look
at it then said
is it poison aaka
why do you ask that pag she answer
for two veri good reason said pag first becaus i never
rememb the dai that you offer food to me out of kind and
secondli becaus you hate me aaka
both those thing ar true pag becaus i hate you i have never
offer you food yet on hate mai be driven out by a larger hate eat
the mussel pag thei ar fresh and good for foh brought them to me
thi morn though not so fat as thei us to be in past year
so pag sat down and devour that dish to the last mussel smack
hi thick lip for he wa a larg eater and food had been scarc of
late becaus by wi command all that could be spare wa be save
for the come winter
aaka handsom solemn blackbrow deepei watch him as he
at and when he had finish said
let us talk
i wish there were some more mussel said pag lick the shell
but if thei ar finish then if you have anyth to sai about
laleela talk on for i am sure it is of her that you wish to speak
now as alwai you ar clever pag
ye i am clever if i were not i should have been dead long ago
well what of laleela the beauti
oh noth much excepther she leant forward and whisper in
hi earthat i wish you would kill her pag or bring it about that
she is kill thi be a man or someth like on you can do
wherea for us women it is imposs becaus it would be set down to
jealou hate
i understand said pag and yet why should i kill laleela whom i
like veri much and who know more than all the rest of us put
togeth
becaus she ha brought a curs upon the tribe began aaka whereon
pag stop her with a wave of hi big hand
you mai think that aaka or choos to sai that you think it but why
wast breath in tell such a tale to me who know it to be a lie it
is the ski and the season that have brought a curs upon the tribe
not thi fair woman from the sea as the peopl believ
what the peopl believ is alwai true said aaka sullenli or at
least thei think that it is true which is the same thing hearken if
thi witch is not kill or driven awai to die or put in her hollow
log and sent out to sea so that we look on her no more the peopl
will kill wi
wors thing might happen to him aaka for instanc he might live
on hate to see all hi plan fail and all hi friend turn against
him as it seem some have done alreadi and he look at her hard
ad come speak your mind or let me go
you know it said aaka stare at the ground with her fine ey
i think i know it answer pag i think that you ar so jealou of
laleela that you would like to be rid of her yet why ar you jealou
see that wi by hi new law ha built a wall between himself and
her
talk not to me of wi foolish law for i hate them and all new
thing interrupt aaka impati if wi wish more wive let
him take them that i could understand for it is our custom what i
do not understand is that seat with her by the fire he should make
a friend and counsellor of thi witch leav me hi wife stand
outsid the hut in the cold while she is warm within meand you
also pag she ad slowli
i understand it well enough said pag wi be wise and in
troubl seek wisdom to help him out of hi troubl find a lamp
to hi hand he hold it up to search the dark
ye and while he stare at thi new light hi feet will fall into a
pit listen pag onc i wa wi counsellor then you the wolfman
and outcast whom he had save came and took him from me now anoth
ha come and taken him from both of us therefor we who were foe
should be friend and rid ourselv of that other
to find ourselv enemi again afterward well there is someth
in what you sai aaka for if you can be jealou so can i now what
you want me to do is to bring about the death of laleela either by
caus her to be kill or by drive her into the sea which is the
same thing is that so
ye pag
you wish me to do thi not with my own hand becaus you know that i
would never strike down with an ax or a stone on whom i have been set
to watch and who ha alwai been kind to me but by stir up the
peopl against her
perhap that might be the better plan said aaka uneasili sinc it
is the peopl upon whom she bring the curs
ar you sure of that aaka ar you sure that if you leav her
alon she will not bring a bless on the peopl in the end see
that wisdom is alwai strong and that she ha more of it than the
rest of us put togeth
i am sure that she would be best out of our path answer aaka
scowl and so would you be if you had a husband whom you love and
who wa be led asid
how should a wife show love to her husband aaka i ask you becaus i
do not know is it by be alwai rough to him and find fault with
all he doe and turn her back on him and hate all hi friend
or is it by be kindli and love and try to help him in hi
troubl as such a on as laleela would do well who am i to talk of
such matter of which as a wolfman i can know noth friendship
and it duti i understand sinc even a dog mai care for it master
but love and it wai have never been mine to know still it is true
that like you i am jealou of thi laleela and should not be sorri
to see her back on the sea therefor i will think over all that you
have said and afterward we will talk again and now i will be go
that is if you have no more mussel aaka
so as there were no more mussel pag went leav aaka wonder
for she wa not sure what he would do she knew that he wa jealou of
laleela who had taken hi place in wi counsel and therefor sure
he must wish to be rid of her as she did and yet pag wa veri
strang and who could be certain he wa onli a twist dwarf wolf
suckl thei said and yet he seem to have the mind of a man and
how could men be count on especi where a woman wa concern
she might have bewitch him also notwithstand hi wrong he
might turn round and take her side now she almost wish she had not
paid so much heed to pag grumbl and open her secret heart to
him for after all pag wa a man and how wa it possibl to trust
men mad peopl most of them who thought quit differ from
women and could be turn from their end and advantag by all sort
of silli reason
pag went awai far awai into the wood for he knew that wi wa take
counsel with laleela and would not want him at a certain place in the
wood a secret place where the tree were veri thick and save
himself no man had ever come he cast himself down upon hi face and
lai think it had come to thi that he hate laleela of whom he
us to be so fond almost as much as aaka did and for the same
reasonbecaus she had rob him of the heart of wi if he caus
her to be kill as aaka had suggest which he could do well enough
by stir up the peopl against her who thought that she had
brought a curs upon them then he would be rid of her and wi heart
would come back to him becaus hi natur wa such that he must have
someon to trust and to care for him and the boi foh wa not yet old
enough for him to lean upon onli if ever he learn that he pag
had loos the stone that crush laleela what then he would kill
him nai that wa not wi wai he would look over hi head and would
never see him more even when he sat on the other side of the fire or
stare him in the face ye wi would despis him and in hi heart
call himdog
pag thought till he could think no more for hi mind went up and
down first thi wai and then that like a stick balanc on a stone
and shaken by the wind at last a kind of savageri enter into him
who grew weari of these reason and wish that he were as the
beast ar who obei their desir and question not he set hi hand to
hi big mouth and utter a low howl cry thrice he utter it and
present far far awai in the distanc it wa answer then pag
sat silent and wait and while he wait the sun went down and
twilight came
there wa a patter of feet stir the dri pine needl then
between the trunk of two tree appear the head of a grai wolf
glare about it suspici pag howl again in a lower note but
still the wolf seem doubt it move awai till such wind as there
wa blew from pag to it then snif thrice and leap forward and
after it ran a cub it came to pag a great gaunt creatur and
rear itself up set it forepaw upon hi shoulder and lick hi
face for it knew him again pag pat it upon the head whereon the
old shewolf sat herself down besid him as a dog might do then with
low growl call to the young on to come near as though to make it
known to pag which it would not do for man wa strang to it so pag
and the wolf sat there togeth and pag talk to the wolf that mani
year ago onc had suckl him while she sat still as though she
understood him which she did not all she understood wa that by her
wa on whom she had suckl
i have kill your kin grai mother said pag to the shewolf or
rather to himself if not all of them for it seem that somewher
you have found on to mate with you and he look toward the cub
lurk at a distanc yet you can forgiv me and come at my call as
of old you that ar a brute beast while i am a man then if you the
beast can forgiv why should not i the man also forgiv on who
ha done me far smaller wrong why should i kill thi witchfromth
sea thi laleela becaus for a while she ha stolen the mind of on
whom i love be wiser than i am and know more be a veri
fair woman also and therefor arm with a net which i cannot cast
oh old mother wolf if you the savag beast can forgiv and come at
my call becaus onc you gave me of your milk why cannot i forgiv
who am a man
then the great gaunt shewolf that understood noth save that he
her fosterl wa troubl lick hi face again and lean against
him who had plan the murder of all her kin and us her love to
decoi them to their doom
i will not kill laleela or caus her to be kill said pag at
length aloud i will forgiv as thi grai wolf mother of mine
forgiv if it is in aaka mind to kill her let her work her own
evil against which i will warn laleela ye and wi also i thank you
for your lesson grai mother and now get you back to your cub and
your hunt
so the old shewolf went awai and present pag went also
next morn pag sat at the mouth of the cave watch laleela at her
work among the castout femal babe go from on to anoth
tend them sooth them talk to those who nurs them
brave sweetli gentli love to look on and in all her wai
at length her task were finish and she came to pag sat herself
down besid him glanc at the grai cold sky drew her robe closer
about her shoulder and shiver
why do you stop in thi cold place laleela ask pag you who i
understand come from a countri where the sun shine and it is warm
becaus i must or so it would seem pag
then would you go awai if you could laleela
i do not know i am not sure pag the great sea is a lone place

should come in your basket not curs you whose ey ar kind and
who do kind deed with your hand yet the peopl hold differ
becaus thei believ that thei ar the onli men and women on the earth
and think that therefor you must be a witch born of the sea also
sinc you came there ha been noth but misfortun the sun ha
hidden itself those beast and bird and fish on which we feed have

continu as hi counsellor with your hand in hi but never round hi
neck until the wrath of the tribe strike you stir up by your
enemi of whom perhap i am the worst here laleela smiledand
you ar kill or driven out to die or will you perhap be pleas
to return to your own peopl as doubtless you can do in that magic
boat of your or so declar urk the ag who sai that he knew a
greatgrandmoth of your who wa exactli like you

and beauti face of her who spoke them then seiz laleela
littl hand he lift it to hi thick lip and kiss it next he
wipe hi on ey with the back of hi hairi paw spat upon the
ground mutter someth that might have been a bless or an
oath and shambl awai while laleela watch him go still smile
sweetli
but when he had gone and she knew that she wa alon she smile no
longer nai she sat down cover her love ey with her hand and
wept
that even when wi return she made her report to him as to the
babe whom he had set in her care speak particularli of two who
were ail that she thought need watch and chosen food
what of it ask wi in hi pleasant fashion see that you watch
them and give them their food laleela

chapter xiv
the redbeard
next morn laleela wa miss when wi notic thi as he wa
quick to do and inquir of her whereabout on of the women who
help her in the care of the castout babe answer that the sun
hairedwhiteon as she call her after she had prepar their
food that morn had told her that she need rest and fresh air
she ad said the woman that she wa go to spend that dai in the
wood and that therefor none must troubl about or search for her as
she would be back at nightfal
did she sai anyth els ask wi anxious
ye answer the woman she spoke to me of what food should be
given to those two sick babe and at what hour in case she should
make up her mind to spend the night in the wood which howev she
wa almost sure she would not do that wa all
then wi went awai to attend hi busi of which he had much in
hand ask no more question perhap becaus aaka had come into the
cave and must have overheard them yet that dai pass slowli for him
and at nightfal he hurri home to the cave think to find laleela
there and to speak to her sharpli becaus she had troubl him by
go out thu without warn him so that he could caus her to be
guard against danger
but when he came to the cave as the dai di there wa no laleela
he wait a while pretend to eat hi food which he could not
touch then he sent for pag present pag shambl into the cave and
look at wi ask
why doe the chief send for me which he ha not done for a long
while it wa but just in time for as i am never want nowadai i
wa about to start for the wood
so you too desir to wander in the wood said wi suspici
and wa silent
what is it ask pag
then wi told him all
now as pag listen he rememb hi talk with laleela and wa
disturb in hi heart still of that talk he said noth but
answer onli
there is no caus for fear thi laleela of the sea is as you know
a moonworshipp doubtless she ha gone out to worship the moon and
to make offer and prayer to it accord to the rite of her own
peopl
it mai be so said wi but i am not sure
if you ar afraid went on pag i will go out to search for her
wi studi the face of pag with hi quick ey then answer
it come into my mind that you pag ar more afraid than i am and
perhap with better reason but whether thi be so or not nobodi can
search for laleela tonight becaus the moon is cover with thick
cloud and rain fall and who can find a woman in the dark
pag went to the mouth of the cave and look at the sky then came
back and answer
it is as you said the sky is black rain fall heavili no man can
see where to set hi foot doubtless laleela is hid in some hole or
beneath thick tree and will return at dawn
i think that she ha been murder or ha gone awai and that you
pag or aaka or both of you know where and why she ha gone said wi
in a mutter wrath voic and glare at him
i know noth answer pag perhap she is at the hut of
moananga i will go to see
he went and a long while afterward return with the rain water
run off him to sai that she wa not in moananga hut or in ani
other that he could find and that none had seen her that dai
all that night wi and pag sat on either side of the fire or lai down
pretend to sleep sai noth but with their ey fix upon the
mouth of the cave at length dawn came a wretch dawn grai and veri
cold although the rain had ceas at the first sign of it pag
slip from the cave sai no word to anyon present wi
follow think to find him outsid but he had vanish nor did
ani know where he had gone then wi sent out messeng and inquir
for laleela these return in due cours but without tide after
thi he dispatch peopl to search for her ye and went himself
although aaka who had come up to the cave ask him why he should be
so disturb becaus a witchwoman had vanish see that it wa
well known that thi wa the fashion of witchwomen when thei had done
all the ill thei could
thi on did good not ill wife said wi look at the foundl
babe
then he went out to the wood take moananga with him
all that dai he search as did other but found noth and at
nightfal return weari and veri sad for it seem to him as though
laleela had torn out hi heart and taken it with her also that
night on of the sick babe which she had been nurs di for it
would not take it food from ani hand but her wi ask for pag but
no on had seen him he too had vanish
doubtless he ha gone with laleela for thei were great friend
although he pretend otherwis said aaka
wi made no answer but to himself he thought that perhap pag had gone
to buri her
a second dawn came and shortli after it pag crept back to the cave
look veri thin and hungri like a toad when it crawl out of it
hole after winter is past
where is laleela ask wi
i dont know answer pag but her hollow log ha gone she must
have drag it down to the sea out of the seal cave at high tide
which is a great deed for a woman
what have you been sai to her ask wi
who can rememb what he said dai ago answer pag give me food
for i am as empti as a whelkshel upon the midden
while pag at wi went down to the seashor he did not know for what
reason he went unless it wa becaus the sea had taken laleela from
him as onc it gave her to him and therefor he wish to look upon
it so there he stood stare at the grai and quiet sea till
present far awai upon the edg of the mist that cover it he saw
someth move
a fish he thought to himself but i dont know what kind of fish
sinc it stai upon the top of the water which onli whale do and
thi fish is too small to be a whale
there he stood stare idli and care noth what sort of fish it
might be till present he note although it wa still so far awai
and so hidden by mist wreath that the thing wa not a fish at all
yet it remind him of someth of what did it remind him ah he
knewof that hollow log in which laleela had drift to thi shore
but it wa not drift now it wa be push beachward by on who
paddl on who paddl swiftli
the gather light fell on thi paddler hair and he saw that it
glint yellow then wi knew that laleela wa the paddler and ran out
into the sea up to hi middl on she came not see him until he
hail her then she paus breathless and the cano glide up to him
where have you been he ask angrili know that i have been much
troubl about you
is it so she gasp look at him in an odd fashion well we
will talk of that afterward meanwhil learn wi that mani peopl
descend on you come in boat like thi onli larger i have fled
awai from them to warn you
mani peopl said wi how can that be there ar not other peopl
unless thei be your that you have brought upon us
nai nai she answer these ar quit differ moreov thei
come from the north not from the south to shore now and quickli
for i think that thei ar veri fierc
then she paddl on beachward wi wade alongsid of her
thei reach the shore where some who had seen the cano had
gather among them moananga and pag it wa drag upon the sand
and laleela climb out of it stiffli help by wi inde she sank
down upon the sand as though she were veri tire
tell us your stori said wi hi ey fix upon her as though he
fear lest she should vanish awai again
it is short chief she answer be weari of the land i
thought that i would float upon the sea for a while therefor i took
my boat and paddl out to sea for my pleasur
you lie laleela said wi rude still go on
so i paddl far the weather be calm toward the end of the great
point of rock which li out yonder though perhap you have never
seen it she continu smile faintli
there last even at the sundown suddenli i saw a great number of
boat come from the north and round the point of rock as though
thei were follow the shore line thei were big boat each of them
hold mani men hideouslook and hairi men thei caught sight of
me and yell at me with harsh voic in a talk i did not understand
i turn and fled befor them thei follow after but the night came
down and save me sometim howev the moon shone out between the
cloud and thei caught sight of me again then at last her face wa
cover up and i paddl on through the mist and dark have seen
the outlin of these hill and know which wai to row i think that
thei ar not far off i think that thei will attack you and that you
must make readi at onc that is all i have to sai to you
what do thei come for ask wi amaz
i do not know answer laleela but thei look thin and hungri
perhap thei seek food
what must we do ask wi again
fight them i suppos said laleela fight them and drive them
off
now wi look bemus for thi thought of folk fight against each
other wa strang to him he had never heard of such a thing becaus
the tribe until laleela came believ themselv to be alon in the
world and therefor had no need of defenc against other men then pag
spoke sai
chief you have fought wild beast and kill them you fought henga
and kill him well it seem that thi is what you and all of us
must do against thi peopl who attack us if laleela is right either
thei will kill us or we must kill them
ye ye it is so said wi still bemus then ad let wini
wini summon all the tribe and bid them bring their weapon with them
ye and let other go with him that thei mai hear more quickli
so certain of those who had gather there on the beach depart
run their hardest when thei had gone wi turn to pag and ask
what shall we do pag
do you seek counsel of me while laleela stand there answer pag
bitterli
laleela a woman ha plai her part said wi now men must plai
their
it alwai come to that in the end said pag
what can we do ask wi
i dont know answer pag yet low tide draw on and at low tide
there is but on entranc to thi bai through the gap in the rock
yonder these stranger will not know thi and if thei come on
present their boat will be strand or onli a few of them will
get through the gap these we must fight also ani who remain upon the
reef but what do i know of fight who am but a dwarf there is
moananga your brother on who is strong and tall and brave let him
be captain and manag the fight but do you wi keep behind it to
look after the peopl who will want you or if need be to fight ani
of these stranger who get on shore
let it be so said wi moananga i make you captain do your best
and i will do my best behind you
i obei you said moananga simpli if i am kill and you live look
after tana and see that she doe not starv
just then summon by the furiou trumpet of winiwini and by
rumour that flew from mouth to mouth the peopl began to run up
each of them arm in a fashion some with stone ax some with
flinthead spear and knive some with stake harden in the fire
or with sling
wi address them tell them that devil who came from the north
float on the sea were about to attack them and that thei must
fight them unless thei wish to be kill with their wive and
children also that moananga would direct them then there aros a
great nois for the women who had run up with the men began to wail
and cling to them till in the end these were driven awai after thi
hou the unstabl began to argu loudli sai that laleela wa a
liar that there were no men in boat and that therefor there wa no
need for all thi make readi also whaka the birdofillomen
declar that if there were such men there wa no us try to
fight against them becaus if thei did thei would all be kill
sinc men in boat must be veri strong and clever so the onli thing
to do wa to run awai at onc and hide in the wood
thi counsel seem to move mani inde some depart at onc
note thi wi went up to whaka and knock him down with a blow of
hi fist also he strove to serv hou in the same wai but see him
come hou escap after thi he call out that the next man who ran
he would catch and brain with hi ax whereon all the rest stai
where thei were still hou went on talk from a distanc till
present there wa a shoutfor there on the misti surfac of the sea
appear a great number of larg cano man some of them by as
mani as eight or ten paddler these cano row on toward the bai
know noth of the fall tide or of the reef of rock so it
happen that present six or eight of them struck these rock upon
which wave broke and then overturn throw the men in them into
the water where some were drown but the most of them reach the
rock to the right and stood upon them jabber in loud voic to
their companion in the other boat outsid the reef who jabber
back to them
at length these men paddl forward gentli which the sea be calm
thei could do well enough not to the gap where those boat that went
first had been overturn but to the rock upon it right side on
which mani of them land leav some in each cano to hold on to
the seawe that grew upon the rock when thei had gather there to
the number of a hundr or more thei began to talk wave their long
arm and point to the shore with the spear thei carri that
seem to be tip with walru ivori or white stone
wi watch them from the beach said to pag at hi side
sure these stranger ar terribl see how tall and strong thei
ar and behold their skin cover with fur and their red hair and
beard i think that thei ar not men but devil onli devil could
look like that and travel about without women or children
if so answer pag thei ar veri hungri devil for that big
fellow who seem to be their chief open hi mouth and point down
it also at hi stomach and then wave hi hand toward the shore
tell the other thu that there thei will find food likewis thei
ar devil who can drown and he nod toward the corps of on or
two of them who had been in those cano that were overset which
corps now were roll to and fro in the shallow water for the
rest he ad after a paus wive can alwai be stolen and he
glanc toward the women of the tribe who were gather in littl
compani behind them all talk togeth at onc or scream and
beat their breast while the children clung to them terrifi
ye said wi then he thought for a moment and call certain men to
him
go he said to urk the ag and bid him lead the women the
children and the old peopl to the wood and hide them there for how
thi busi will end i do not know and thei will be better far
awai
the men went and there follow much scream and confus some of
the women began to run toward the wood other would not move while
other threw their arm about their husband and tri to drag these
awai with them
unless thi wail stop soon the heart of the men will melt like
blubber over a fire said pag look some of them ar creep awai
to the women
go you and drive them to the wood said wi
nai answer pag i who never like the compani of women overmuch
stai where i am
now wi took anoth counsel see aaka stand at a distanc
between the women and the men or most of them whom moananga wa
marshal as best he might he call to her she heard and came to
him for aaka did not lack courag
wife he said those red devil ar go to attack us and we must
kill them or be kill
that i know answer aaka calmli
it is best went on wi look down and speak in a rapid voic
that the women should not see the fight i ask you therefor to
lead them all to the wood and hide them awai togeth with the old
peopl and children and those who have run there alreadi afterward
you can return
what is the us of return to find our men dead it is better that
we should stai here and die with them
you would not die aaka those red wander mai want wive at
least you would not die at onc though in the end thei might kill
and eat you therefor i command you to go
sure the witchfromthesea who guid the wander to attack us
should go also befor she work more treacheri answer aaka
she did not guid them she fled befor them exclaim wi angrili
still take her with you if you will and foh also onli drive back
ani men go now i command you
i obei said aaka but know husband that although we have grown
awai from each other if you die i die also becaus onc we were
close togeth
i thank you answer wi yet if that should happen i sayliv
on rule the tribe and build it up afresh
of what us ar women without men repli aaka shrug her
shoulder
then she turn to walk awai and as she went wi saw her wipe her
ey with the back of her hand she reach the women and cri out
someth to them in a fierc voic repeat it again and again
till present thei began to move awai with the ag drag the
children by the hand or carri them so that at last the tumult di
and the sad compani vanish among the first of the tree
all thi while the redbeard had been jabber togeth make
their plan at last these seem to be settl for by the help of
their boat a number of them cross the mouth of the bai and gather
upon the line of rock to the left that now at low tide also stood
bare abov the water other too in some of the boat set themselv
in order between these jaw of rock as though prepar to paddl
toward the shore
pag note thi and cri out exultingli
that thei cannot do for their boat will overset upon the reef that
lie beneath the wave and thei will be drown in the deep hole
between like those fellow and he point to the bodi roll
about in the surf
but such wa not the purpos of the redhair men as present he
wa to learn
as he spoke wi heard the crunch of littl shell in the sand behind
him and look round to see who came behold it wa laleela clad in
her blue cloak and hold a spear in her hand
why ar you here he ask angrili why have you not gone to the
wood with the other women
your order were to the tribe she repli in a quiet voic i am
not of the tribe so i hid in a hut till all were gone be not wrath
chief she went on in a gentl voic for i who have seen other
tribe and their fight mai be abl to give good counsel
now he began to speak angri word to her and bid her begon of which
stand at hi side she took no heed but onli stare out at the sea
then suddenli with a cry of i thought it she leapt in front of
wi whose face wa shoreward and next instant stagger back fall
into hi arm as he turn he stare at her as did pag and lo thei
saw that in her cloak stood a littl spear with feather on it which
had struck her just abov the breast
pull it out pag she said recov her feet it is an arrow
which other peopl us and well wa it for me that thi cloak is so
good and thick
had you not sprung in front of me that littl spear would have
pierc me exclaim wi stare at her
it wa by a chanc answer laleela with a smile
you lie said wi at which she onli smile again and drew the cloak
more close about her ay while pag pull she still smile though
he note that her lip turn pale and twitch at length the arrow
came out and he note someth els name that on it bone barb
there wa blood and a littl piec of flesh though be wise of
thi he said noth
lie down chief said laleela there behind that rock and you
also pag for so you will be safer i also will lie down and she
did so now hearken to me she went on those redbeard or some
of them have bow and arrow as we have just learn and their plan
is to shoot at you from the boat until the tide is quit low and
then to climb along both line of rock and attack you
at thi moment moananga came up and wa also made to lie down
perhap said wi and if so we had better draw out of the reach of
the littl spear
that is what thei want you to do answer laleela for then thei
will climb along the line of rock quietli and without hurt i have
anoth counsel if it pleas you to hear it
what is it said wi and moananga togeth
thi chief you and all the peopl know those rock and where the
deep water hole ar between them sinc from childhood you have
gather shellfish there now divid your men into two compani and
do you command on while moananga command the other clamber along
those rock to the right and left with the compani and attack the
redbeard on them for when thei see you come so boldli some of
them will get into the boat the other you must fight and kill nor
will those in the boat who have bow and arrow be abl to shoot much
at you for fear lest thei should hit their own peopl do thi and
swiftli
those ar good word said wi moananga do you take the left line
of rock with half the men and i will take the right with the rest
and laleela i bid you remain here or fly
ye i will remain here said laleela rather faintli and turn on
her face so that none should see the stain of blood soak through
her blue robe yet as thei went she cri after them
bid your peopl take stone wi and moananga that thei mai cast them
into the boat and break their bottom
come to the men of the tribe who stood there in knot look veri
wretch and afraid most of them as thei stare at the hairi red
beard upon the rock and in their boat wi address them in a few
hard word sai
yonder redbeard come from i know not whenc thei ar starv
which will make them veri brave and thei mean to kill us everi on
and to take first our food and then our women if thei can find them
also perhap to eat the children now we count as mani head as thei
do perhap more and it will be a great shame to us if we allow
ourselv to be conquer our old peopl butcher our women taken
and our children eaten by these red wander is it not so
to thi question the crowd answer that it wa yet without
eager for the ey of most of them were turn toward the wood
whither the women had gone then moananga said
i am chief in thi matter if ani man run awai i will kill him at
onc if i can and if not i will kill him afterward
and i ad pag who have a good memori will keep my ey fix on
all and rememb what everi man doe which afterward i will report to
the women
then the forc wa divid into two compani of whom the bravest
were put in the rear to prevent the other from run awai thi
done thei began to scrambl along the two horn of rock that enclos
the littl bai wade round the pool that lai between the rock for
thei knew where the water wa deep and where it wa shallow
when the redbeard saw them come thei made a howl nois
wag their head so that their long beard shook and beat their
breast with their left hand moreov wave their spear thei did
not wait to be attack but clamber forward down the rock while
those of them in the boat shot arrow a few of which hit men of the
tribe and wound them
now at the sight of blood flow from their brother whom the arrow
had struck the tribe went mad in an instant thei seem to forget
all their fear it wa as though someth of which neither thei nor
their father had thought for hundr of year came back to their
heart thei wave their stone ax and flintpoint spear thei
shout make a sound like to that of wolv or other wild beast
thei gnash their teeth and leapt into the air and began to rush
forward yet move by the same thought wi and moananga made them
stai where thei were for a while for thei knew what would happen to
the redbeard
thi happen these redbeard also leap forward slip upon
the seaweedcov rock and fell into the pool between them or if
thei did not fall thei tri to wade these pool not know which
were deep and which were shallow so that mani of them went under
water and came up again splutter then wi and moananga scream to
the tribe to charg
on thei went bound from rock to rock as thei could do readili
enough who from boyhood had known everi on of these stone and where
to set their feet upon them then come to the pool into which the
redbeard had fallen thei attack them as thei tri to climb out
break their skull with ax and stone and thu kill a number
without loss to themselv
now the redbeard scrambl back to the end of the two horn of
rock purpos to make a stand there and here the tribe attack
them led by wi and moananga that fight wa veri hard for the red
beard were strong and fierc and drove their big ivorypoint
spear through the bodi of a number of the tribe inde it look
ill for the tribe until wi with hi bright ax that pag had made
that with which he slew henga kill a great fellow who seem to be
the chief of the redbeard cut hi head in two so that he fell
down into the water see thi the redbeard wail aloud and
seiz by a sudden panic rush for the boat into which thei began
to scrambl as best thei could then wi and moananga rememb the
counsel of laleela and gave command to the tribe to throw the
heaviest stone thei could lift into the boat thi thei did
break the bottom of most of them so that water flow in and thei
sank
the men in the boat swam about till thei drown or tri to come to
the shore where thei were met with spear or stone so that thei
diedeveri on of them the end of it wa that but five boatload got
awai and these row out to sea and were never seen again that
night a wind blew in which thei mai have founder or perhap
be so hungri thei starv upon the sea at least the tribe saw no
more of them thei came none knew whenc and thei went none knew
whither onli the most of them remain behind in the pool of the
rock or sunk in the deep sea beyond the rock
thu end the fight the first that the tribe had ever known
chapter xv
wi kiss laleela
when all wa over wi and moananga have come togeth on the shore
bear the hurt with them count their loss thei found that in
all twelv men had been kill and twentyon wound among whom wa
moananga who wa hit in the side with an arrow though not badli of
the redbeard howev more than sixti had di most of them by
drown at least thi wa the number that thei found after the next
high tide had wash up the bodi there mai have been more that were
taken out to sea
it is a great victori said moananga as wi wash the wound in hi
side with salt water and the tribe fought well
ye answer wi the tribe fought veri well
yet interrupt pag it wa the witchfromthesea who won the
fight by her counsel for i think that had we wait for the red
beard to attack us on the beach it would have end otherwis also
it wa she who taught us to throw stone into the boat
that is true said wi let us go to thank her
so thei went all three of them and found laleela ly where thei
had left her behind the rock but face downward
she ha fallen asleep who must be veri weari said moananga
ye said wi yet it is strang to sleep when death is so near
and he look at her doubtfulli
pag said noth onli kneel down he thrust hi long arm
underneath laleela and turn her over onto her back then thei saw
that the sand beneath her wa red with blood and that her blue robe
wa also red now wi cri aloud and would have fallen had not
moananga caught him by the arm
laleela is dead he said in a hollow voic laleela who save us
is dead
then i know on who will be glad mutter pag still be not so
sure
then he open her robe and thei saw the wound beneath her breast
which still bled a littl pag who wa skill in the treat of
hurt bent down and examin it and while he did so moananga said
to wi
do you understand brother that the littl spear gave her thi wound
while she wa talk to us and that she hid it so that none of us
knew she had been pierc
wi nod like on who will not trust himself to speak
i knew well enough growl pag i who drew out the arrow
then why did you not tell us ask moananga
becaus if wi had known that thi witchfromthesea wa smitten in
the breast the heart would have gone out of him and hi knee would
have becom feebl better that she should die than that the heart of
our chief should have turn to water while the red wander gather
to kill us
what of the wound ask wi pai no heed to thi talk
be comfort answer pag although she ha bled much i do not
think that it is deep becaus thi thick cloak of her almost stop
the littl spear therefor unless the point wa poison i believ
that she will live stai now and watch her
then he shambl off toward certain bush and sea herb that grew
upon the beach and search among them till he found on that he
sought from thi he pluck a number of leav which he put into hi
mouth and chew between hi great teeth he return and take the
green pulp from hi mouth thrust some of it into laleela wound and
the rest into that of moananga
it burn said moananga winc
ay it burn out poison and staunch blood answer pag as he
cover laleela with her cloak
then wi seem to awak from the deep thought into which he had
fallen for stoop down he lift laleela in hi arm as though
she were a child and strode awai with her toward the cave follow by
pag and moananga also by certain of the tribe who wave their spear
and shout by thi time the women were return from the wood for
some of the younger and more activ of them had climb tall tree
and watch all though from far awai had made report to those
below who learn that the red wander had fled or been kill
troop back to the hut leav the ag and the children to follow
after
the first of all came foh run like a deer
father he cri in an angri voic as he met wi am i a child that
i should be drag off to wood by women when you ar fight
hush said wi nod hi head at the burden in hi arm hush my
son we will talk of these matter afterward
then appear aaka calmfac and state although if the truth
were known she had run also and with much swift
welcom husband she said thei tell me that you have conquer
those redbeard is it true
it seem so wifeat least thei have been conquer afterward i
will tell you the tale
as he spoke he strove to pass her by but she step in front of him
and ask again
if that witchfromthesea ha been kill for her treacheri why do
you carri her in your arm
wi gave no answer for anger made him speechless but pag laugh
hoars and said
in throw stone at the kite you have hit the dove aaka the
witchfromthesea whom wi clasp upon hi breast ha not di for
treacheri if she be dead death came upon her in save wi life
sinc she leapt in front of him and receiv into her bosom that which
would have pierc him through and thi not by chanc
such thing might have been look for from her who is ever where
she should not be what did she among the mensh who ought to have
accompani the women ask aaka
i dont know answer pag i onli know that she save wi life by
offer up her own
is it so pag then it is hi turn to save her if he can or to
buri her if he cannot now i go to tend the wound of our own peopl
come with me tana for i see that moananga hurt ha been dress
and that we ar not want here and toss her head she walk
awai slowli
but tana did not follow her be curiou to learn the tale of
laleela also to make sure that moananga had taken no harm
wi bore laleela into the cave and laid her down upon the bed where she
slept near to the castout children tana took moananga awai and pag
went to make broth to pour down laleela throat so that wi and
laleela seem to be left alon though thei were not for the women
who nurs the castout watch them from dark place in the cave wi
threw fur wrap over her and take her hand rub it between
hi own in the warmth of the cave where fire still burn laleela
woke up and began to talk like on who dream
just in time just in time she said for i saw the arrow come
though thei did not and leapt into it path it would have kill
him if i save him all is well for what matter the life of a
stranger want of none not even of him
then she open her ey and look upward by the light of the fire
saw the ey of wi gaze down upon her
do i live she murmur and do you live wi
wi made no answer onli he bent hi head and kiss her on the lip
and although she wa so weak she kiss him back then turn awai
her head and seem to go to sleep but asleep or awak wi went on
kiss her till pag came with the broth and after him the women
with the castout children appear from their hide place
chatter like starl befor thei flight in autumn
present wi look up from hi task of watch laleela who have
swallow the broth seem to have fallen asleep and saw aaka
stand by the fire and gaze at them both
so the witch live she said in a low voic and ha found a nurs
when ar you go to marri her wi
wi rose and came to her then ask
who told you that i wa go to marri her have i not sworn an oath
upon thi matter
your ey told me i think wi what ar oath against such servic
as she ha done youthough it is strang that i should live to learn
that wi made us of a woman breast as a shield in battl
you know the truth of that he answer
i onli know what i see who pai no heed to word also what my heart
tell me
and what doe your heart tell you wife
it tell me that the curs which thi witch ha brought upon us ha
but begun it work she goe out to sea in her hollow log and return
lead a host of red wander you fight these wander and drive
them awai for a time yet mani of the tribe ar dead and wound
what she will do next i do not know but i am sure she ha wors gift
in her bag for i tell you that she is a witch who ha been stare at
the moon and talk with spirit in the air and that you would have
done well to leav thi darl of your to die upon the beach if die
she can
some wive might have held that these ar hard word to us of on
who ha just save their man from death said wi yet if you think
so ill of her kill her aaka for she is helpless
and bring her curs upon my head nai wi she is safe from me
then abl to bear no more wi turn and left the cave
outsid on the gather ground he found much tumult for here the
bodi of the dead had been carri and everybodi wa come togeth
women and children who had lost their husband or father wail
make a great nois after the fashion of the tribe men who had been
wound but could still walk move about show their hurt and
seek prais or comfort while other who had come through
unscath boast loudli of their deed in the great fight with the
redbeard the devil who came out of the sea
here and there were group and in the centr of each group a speaker
in on of them whaka the birdofillomen wa tell hi hearer that
these redbeard whom thei had fought and conquer were but the
forerunn of a great host which would descend upon them present
at a littl distanc hou the unstabl while rejoic in the victori
of the tribe declar that such fortun wa not to be trust and
that therefor the best thing to do would be that thei should all run
awai into the wood befor it turn against them meanwhil wini
wini the shudder went from corps to corps follow by the
mourner blow hi horn over each and point out it wound
whereon all the mourner wail aloud in choru
the most of the peopl howev were collect round urk the ag
who hi white beard wag upon hi chin mumbl to them through
hi toothless jaw that now he rememb what he had long forgotten
name that hi greatgrandfath had told hi that is urk
grandfath that hi urk greatgrandfath greatgrandfath
had heard from hi remot ancestor that onc just such redbeard had
descend on the tribe after the appear among them of a witch
fromthesea veri much like to the ladi laleela who wa belov of wi
their chief as wa known of all for had not he wi been seen
kiss her
and what happen then ask a voic
i cannot quit rememb answer urk but i think that the witch
wa sacrif to the icegod after which no more redbeard came
do you mean that laleela the white witch should also be sacrif to
the icegod ask the voic
confront with thi problem urk wag hi long beard then answer
that he wa not sure but he thought that on the whole it might be
wise to sacrific her if the consent of wi could be obtain
for what reason ask the voic again see that she warn us
of the come of the redbeard and afterward took into her own
breast the littl spear that wa aim at wi
becaus answer urk after a great event such as ha happen
the god alwai seek a sacrific and as none of the redbeard ha
been taken aliv it would be better to offer up to them the witch
fromthesea who is a stranger rather than ani on of our own
peopl
now moananga who wa among those that heard thi speech limp up to
urk for the wound in hi side made him walk stiffli and seiz hi
beard with on hand slap him in the face with the other
hearken old vile on who call yourself a wizard he said if ani
should be sacrif i think that it is you becaus you ar a liar
who feed the peopl upon fals tale of what ha never been well you
know that thi laleela whom you urg us to kill is the noblest of
women and that had it not been for her wi my brother and our
chief would now be dead inde that we should all be dead sinc
she warn us of the come of the red wander she it wa too
who after the littl spear had found her breast the spear she bade
pag drag out with her flesh upon it sai no word as i who wa
present know gave us counsel that told us how to master the red
beard by attack them and throw stone into their boat which
afterward we did thu kill the most of them yet now you would egg
on the peopl to sacrific her to the icegod dog that you ar
then moananga onc more smote urk upon the face tumbl him over
onto the sand and limp awai while all who heard shout applaus
of the word as just befor thei had done of those of urk for such
is the fashion of crowd
just then wi himself appear whereon urk rose from the sand and
began to prais him sai that there had been no such chief of the
tribe sinc the dai of hi greatgrandfath greatgrandfath
then all the peopl ran togeth and took up that song of prais ye
even those of the wound who could walk for in their heart thei
knew everi on of them that it wa wi who had save them from death
and their women from even wors thing ye howev much thei might
grumbl and find fault thei knew that it wa wi who had save them
as thei knew also that it wa laleela the witchfromthesea who had
save wi by spring in front of him and receiv the littl spear
into her own breast and who after she wa stricken yet had given
good counsel to him to pag and to moananga
wi heard all their prais but answer noth to them nai he
push asid those who crowd round him and the women who strove to
kiss hi hand forc a wai through them to where the dead lai upon
whom he look long and earnestli then have given order for their
burial he went on to visit those who had deep wound still sai
noth for the heart of wi wa heavi in him and the word of aaka
had pierc him like a spear rememb hi oath he knew not what
he should do and even now in the hour of hi victori he wonder
what fate had in store for him and for laleela who had save hi
life which he wish that she had not done
so from that time forward dai by dai wi went about hi task veri
silent sai littl to anyon becaus hi heart wa sore and he
fear lest should he open hi lip it bitter would escap from
them therefor he kept apart from other and walk much alon or
accompani by foh onli for thi son of hi seem all that wa left
to him also he went out hunt as he us to do befor he kill
henga and becam the chief let it be known that sit so much
in the cave took awai hi health and spirit also that meat be
need he held it hi duti as the best huntsman of the tribe to kill
deer if he could though thi wa not often sinc becaus of the
bad season the most of the deer seem to have left the wood
on dai wi follow a doe far into the forest and have lost her
there turn homeward hi road led him past a littl pocket in the
hillsid where the fir tree grew thickli thi cleft or pocket wa
not more than thirti pace deep by perhap as mani wide all round it
were steep wall of rock and it mouth wa narrow perhap three
pace across no more outsid of it wa a patch of rainwash rock
of the size of a larg hut which rock end in a littl cliff about
four spear length high below thi cliff lai a patch of marsh such
as were common in a forest a kind of hole fill with sticki red
slime in the centr of which a spring bubbl up that could be seen
beneath the growth of marsh briar that grew on the red mud which mud
spread out for mani pace everi wai and at it edg wa ring round
with fir tree
as wi drew near to thi pocket he heard a snort sound that caus
him to stand still and take shelter behind the bole of a big tree for
he did not know what beast made that nois
whilst he stood thu out of the narrow entranc of the cleft there
stalk a huge auroch bull so great a beast that a tall man stand
by it side could not have seen over it shoulder it stood still upon
the patch of rock look about it and snif the air which caus
wi to fear that it had smelt him and to crouch close behind the tree
but thi wa not so for the wind blew from the bull to him now wi
stare at the auroch as he had never stare at anyth except at
laleela when first he saw her in her hollow log for although such
beast were told of among the tribe thei were veri rare be quit
differ from the wild cattl and he had never seen but on of them
befor a halfgrown cow it wa a mighti creatur with thick curv
horn and it bodi wa cover with black hair while down it spine
ran a long grai streak of other lightercolour hair it ey were
fierc and promin it leg were short so that it dewlap hung
nearli to the ground and it had big cleft hoof
a great desir took hold of wi to attack that beast but he restrain
himself becaus he knew that he could not prevail against it for
certainli it would toss and trampl him to death whilst he watch
it the bull turn and went awai from him down the ledg of rock and
present he heard it crash a path through the forest doubtless to
seek it feed ground
when it had gone wi crept to the mouth of the cleft and look in
search the place with hi ey then as he could neither see nor
hear anyth with a beat heart he enter the cleft keep
close to the lefthand wall of rock and work hi wai round it
slip from tree to tree it wa empti but at it end grew some
larg fir and beneath them bracken and here from mani sign wi
learn that the auroch bull had it lair thu the trunk of the
tree were polish by it hide as it rub itself against them
which show him that thi wa it home also the ground wa trodden
hard with it feet and in certain place where it wa soft torn by
it horn which it had thrust deep into the sandi soil to clean and
sharpen them
wi came out of the cleft and stood still think he turn and
look over the edg of the littl cliff at the morass beneath then
he climb down the cliff and by the help of a fallen tree some few
feet out upon the morass where he test the depth of the mud with hi
spear
it wa deep for he must drive in the spear to it full length and the
arm that held it to the elbow befor he touch the rock or hard
ground that form it bottom scrambl along the fallen tree he
did thi thrice and alwai found the bottom at the same depth then
he climb the cliff again and stand befor the mouth of the
cleft wi the brave and cun hunter thought to himself thu
that mighti bull rest in the daytim in yonder hole but when
even draw in it come out to feed now if when it came out or
when it return in the morn it found a man stand in front of
it what would it do certainli it would charg him and if the man
leapt asid what would happen it would fall over the cliff and be
bog and there the man might go down and fight it
thu thought wi and hi nostril spread themselv out and hi ey
flash as he thought of that great fight which might be between a
hunter and thi bull of bull wallow togeth there in the slime
then he thought again thu
the odd ar great the bull might catch the man with a sweep of it
horn and be too cun to rush over the cliff which it know well
or be so mighti when thei were at it in the mud it might break
out and come on to him and there would be an end ye there would be
death
a third time wi thought
am i so happi that i should fear to face death have i not wonder
mani a time of late whether it would not be well to stumbl among the
rough root of the tree and to fall by chanc upon the point of my
spear and were it not for foh should i not have stumbl thusbi
chanceand been found pierc with the spear for when the spear had
done it work might there not be peac for on who ha tri and
fail and know not which road to take what better end could there
be for a hunter than to die cover with glori fight thi mighti
beast of the forest which no man of hi peopl ha ever yet dare to
do would not the tribe make song about me which thei would tell on
winter night by the fire in the dai to come ye thei and their
children after them for more gener than urk can rememb and
would not aaka the wife of my youth then learn to think of me
tenderli
thu said wi to himself and hasten homeward through the twilight
inde as the wai wa far and the path difficult the dark had
fallen er ever he came to the cave
enter silent from the shadow he saw aaka stand by the fire
and note that her face wa troubl for she wa stare into the
dark at the mouth of the cave by the fire also sat pag polish
a spear head and near to him foh who wa whisper into hi ear at
a distanc by the other fire laleela now recov from her wound
but still somewhat pale went about among the castout babe see
that their skin rug were wrap round them so that thei might not
grow cold in the night with her wa moananga he whisper into her
ear and she smile and seem to answer aimlessli for her ey too
were fix upon the dark at the mouth of the cave
wi came forward into the firelight aaka saw him and instantli her
face chang for on it seem to fall it usual mask of haughti
you ar late husband she said which as you were aloneher
she glanc first at laleela and next at pag the two of whom she wa
so jealousi strang and caus me to fear who thought that
perhap you might have met more red wander
no wife he answer simpli i think that we shall see no more
wander on thi shore i wound a doe with my spear which stuck in
it side and follow it far but it escap me who have no fortun
nowadai even at the onli craft i understand he ad with a sigh
now i am tire and hungri
did the deer carri awai the spear father ask foh
ye son he repli absent
then how come it that it is in your hand father for when you sent
me back thi morn you had onli on spear
it fell from the doe side and i found it again amongst the rock
son
then if it fell among rock why is the shaft cover with mud
father ask foh but wi made no answer onli pag who had been
watch him with hi on bright ey rose and take the spear
began to clean it note as he did so that there wa no dry blood
upon it point
befor she went awai to her hut where the fanci had taken her to sleep
again for a while becaus she said that the cry of the castout
children disturb her aaka brought wi hi food thi she did becaus
she fear that otherwis laleela might take her place and serv him
with hi meat
on the follow dai wi stop at home and did those thing that lai
to the hand of the chief there wa much troubl in the tribe the
time of autumn had come and the weather remain cold and cheerless
as it had done dure that of summer food wa scanti and the most of
what could be won by the order of wi wa be save up against the
come winter even here there wa troubl becaus mani of such fish
as could be caught be laid out on the bank in the usual wai for
cure went bad ow to the lack of sun to dry them so that much
labour wa wast moreov those women whose husband or son had
been kill in the fight with the redbeard forget the peril
from which thei and all the tribe had been save began to grumbl
much as did those whose men had been wound and were not recov
of their hurt thi wa their cry
that laleela the fair white witchfromthesea she who wa the love
of wi had brought all these ill upon them she who had led the red
beard to their shore and that therefor she ought to be kill or
driven awai yet none of them dare to lift a finger against her
first becaus as thei suppos she wa the lover of wi whom everi
on of them fear and honour and secondli becaus all did not
think as thei did thu mani of the men clung to laleela some for the
reason that she wa sweet and beauti and other becaus thei knew
that she had save wi from death offer up her own life for hi
also there were women who side with her for instanc the mother of
the castout children whom she tend night and dai for although thei
had cast them out the most of those mother still love their
children and came to nurtur them in their heart bless wi who
had save them from death and her who tend them in their
helpless moreov although thi wa strang howev much she
mai have plot against her and desir her death in the past and
howev much in a fashion she hate her through jealousi in secret
laleela greatest friend and protector wa aaka
for although she would never sai so aaka knew that had it not been
for thi woman whom she call witchfromthesea there would have
been no wi left live also she honour laleela know too that
if she who wa so sweet and beauti chose to stretch out her hand
and to look on him with the ey of love she could caus wi to forget
hi oath and to take her to himself which she did not do therefor
although she spoke rough word of her openli and turn her back upon
her and mock at wi about her still in secret she wa laleela
friend
further laleela had anoth friend in moananga who after wi wa the
most belov and honour of ani in the tribe especi sinc he had
born himself so brave against the redbeard for from the moment
that moananga had seen laleela leap in front of wi to receiv the
arrow in her breast he had fallen in love with her although it wa
not in front of him that she had leapt
thi folli of hi made troubl in hi hous becaus although hi
wife tana like aaka wa jealou natur if in a gentler fashion
still he love laleela and what is more said so openli
inde he tri to win her announc that he wa bound by no law
which wi had made but in thi matter he fail for although laleela
answer him veri sweetli she would have none of him about which
when she came to learn of it tana mock him much yet so kindli did
laleela push him awai from her that he remain the dearest and
closest of her friend mayhap becaus he knew that it wa wi who
stood between them wi hi brother whom he love more than he did ani
woman still he found tana mockeri hard to bear though the more
she mock the closer he clung to laleela as did tana becaus she
held that laleela had taught moananga a lesson that he need
take heed of none of these thing which meant naught to them the
common peopl of the tribe grumbl and moan in their distress and
becaus thei could find no other at whose door to lai their troubl
thei bound them on to the back of laleela sai that she had brought
them with her out of the sea and that their home wa on her shoulder
for be but simpl folk thei did not understand that like the rain
or the snow evil fall upon the head of men from heaven abov
chapter xvi
the auroch and the star
on the second morn wi who had made all thing readi to hi hand
rose while it wa still dark kiss foh who lai fast asleep at hi
side and slip from the cave take with him three spear and the
bonehaft ax of iron that pag had made and fashion the same with
which he had slain henga as he went by the flicker light of the
fire he saw laleela sleep among the babe look most beauti
with her long bright hair ly in mass about her sweet wa her
face as she lai thu asleep and yet as he thought sad and troubl
he stood still look at her then sigh and went on think that
she had not seen him for wi did not know that after he had pass
laleela sat up and watch him till he wa lost in the shadow
outsid the cave ti to a stake beneath a rough shelter of stone
wa hi dog yow a fierc wolflik beast that love him onli which
often he took with him when he went ahunt for it wa train to
drive game toward him loos yow who whimper with joi at the
smell of him wi struck him on the head with hi hand thu tell
the beast that he must be silent then he start paus a littl
while by the hut in which aaka slept inde almost he enter it
but in the end did not becaus he knew that she would question him
close for the night wa too far gone for him to come to sleep with
her in the hut as he did sometim while it wa too earli for him to
be stir in the dark when all were asleep and she would guess that
he plan some adventur and try to wring out of him what it might
be
wi thought to himself that if onli aaka wa as she had been in past
year he would not now be start to fight the auroch singl
hand and so think for the second time that morn he sigh
yet he wa not angri with her for well he knew what had caus thi
chang it wa the death of her child foa murder by the brute man
henga that had turn her heart sour and made of her anoth woman
for he knew also that secretli she blame him and laid foa death
upon hi shoulder as pag had alwai laid it upon her own
alwai aaka for a long time befor he did so had desir that he
should challeng henga and thi not onli becaus she wish that he
should becom chief of the tribe nai there wa a deeper reason
someth within her had warn her that if henga continu to live
he would bring calam upon her and her hous therefor know
wi strength and skill and be sure in herself that howev mighti
henga might be wi could conquer him again and again she had urg wi
to give him battl though she had hidden from him the true reason for
her urg but he would not do so not becaus he had been afraid
but becaus he had shrunk from thrust himself forward and caus
all to talk of him be a man of veri modest mind also becaus he
had fear lest henga should overcom him be so terribl a giant
in which case not onli would he have been kill a matter of no great
moment but aaka and hi children would have been at the merci of the
tyrant and unless thei had slain themselv must have born hi
vengeanc
therefor not until foa had been butcher through aaka own fault
and jealousi of pag whom she hate becaus wi love him so much had
he consent to stir in thi busi that he might aveng hi child
blood upon henga if so he could even then he had not stir until
she had sent him to take counsel with the icegod and watch for the
omen of the fall stone for secretli she had climb to the crest
of the glacier on the dai befor he went and thrust sundri of the
loos stone to it veri lip when she had known that on or other of
them would fall on the follow morn when the rai of the risen
sun struck upon the ic or if perchanc none had fallen then she
would have made some other plan to bring about that which she desir
for alwai be it rememb she wa sure in herself that wi whom
she look upon as greater and stronger than ani who live as half a
god inde would deal out death to henga if onc he could be brought
to face him and after foa had been murder she had had but on aim
in lifeto see henga dead er he kill wi and foh also
much of all thi wi knew and more he guess though some thing were
hid from him such as the place of the stone upon the lip of the
glacier oh all had gone awri between aaka and himself and now
laleela had come cloth in beauti wisdom and sweet to tie the
thread of their live to a knot that he knew not how to loosen
sure he would be better dead leav moananga to becom chief after
him at least so he held and if the god had decre otherwis then
let them give him the strength to conquer the bull of bull
thu did he take these matter out of the rack of hi troubl
mind and lai them in the hand of fate that fate might decid them as
it would if he kill the auroch or could not find it again then he
would know it wa a sign from the god who decre that he must live
on and if otherwis then hi troubl would be done so he depart
from the hut think that aaka would never learn how he had stood
there in the dark fill with such muse and memori and
present wa on the seashor and clear of the villag
here he stai a while until the sky turn grai and there wa light
suffici to enabl him to thread hi wai through the forest
thi he did slowli at first but afterward more quickli follow a
differ road to that which he had taken after he had first seen the
auroch on which ran along the edg of the beach where in place
blown sand still lai among the fir tree thi he did becaus he
fear lest the bull should have scent him after he left it lair
two dai befor and be watch and wait on hi track at length
he struck up hill for although he had never walk that path the
hunter sens within him told him where to turn and strike the
foot of the littl marsh skirt round it till he came near the
bottom of the low cliff along the top of which ran the rocki path
that border the den of the auroch here he rest a while hide
himself in the brambl undergrowth becaus he did not know at what
hour the bull return to it lair after it nightli feed and fear
lest he might meet it on the rocki path
he had sat still thu for perhap the half of an hour or more idli
watch certain bird that had gather togeth on the branch of a
dead fir near by prepar to fly south long befor their accustom
time present after much twitter the bird rose in a cloud and
flew awai to warmer clime though as wi knew noth of ani other
countri he wonder why thei went and whither next a rabbit ran past
him scream as it ran and as though bewild took shelter
behind a stone where it crouch present he saw why it had
scream for after it run on it scent swift thin terribl
silent came a weasel the weasel also vanish behind the stone where
the rabbit had crouch there wa a sound of scuffl and of more
thin scream then the weasel and the rabbit roll out togeth from
behind the stone the weasel with it sharp teeth fix in the
rabbit neck
behold death hunt all thing thought wi to himself behold the
god hunt man who fli and scream fill with terror of he
know not what till thei have him by the throat
suddenli the dog yow who had taken no heed of the rabbit be too
well train half rose from where he crouch hidden in the thick
bush at hi master side lift hi fierc head snif the wind
which blew toward them from the direct of the auroch den and
look upward utter a growl so low that it could scarc be heard
wi also look upward and saw what it wa at which yow growl
for there but a few pace abov him with the morn light glanc
from it wide polish horn came the huge auroch return full
fed to it lair wi shiver when he saw it for view thu from
beneath with it shadow magnifi by the low light show enorm
on the rocki wall beyond the beast wa terrifi as it march past
him majest shake it great head and lash it flank with
it bushi tail so terrifi inde that wi bethought him that it
would be wise to fly while there wa yet time
oh could ani man prevail against such a brute as thi wi wonder
and turn to go
then he rememb all the purpos that had brought him thither also
how great would be hi futur glori if he could kill that bull and
how nobl hi end if the bull kill him so he sat down again and
wait awhil anoth halfhour perhap to give the auroch some
time to settl itself in it lair and forget it vigil so that
if it were disturb it might come out confus by sleep also wi
wait till the sun which as it chanc shone that morn should
reach a certain height when he hope that it rai strike full in
the beast ey would confus it as it issu forth
at length the moment wa at hand when he must either dare the deed or
leav it undar and return home asham make pretenc that he had
gone forth to hunt deer which he had not found and perhap to be
laugh at for hi lack of skill by pag whom of late he had forbidden
to follow him becaus he wish to be alon or to be ask by aaka
for the venison which she knew he had not brought
rememb these thing wi rose up stretch hi arm straighten
himself and climb the littl cliff to give battl to the auroch
strip himself of hi skin robe he laid it on on side hang it
to the bough of a tree so that now he wa cloth onli in an
undergar of fawn hide which came down to abov hi knee then
have thrust hi left wrist through the loop of hi ax he took on
of the short heavi spear in hi right hand hold the other two in
hi left next he peer into the cleft but could see noth of hi
game which doubtless wa ly down under the tree at the farther
end the hound yow smelt it there inde for he began to slaver at
the mouth and hi hair stood up upon hi back wi pat him upon the
head and made a motion with hi arm yow understood and leapt into the
cleft like a stone from a sling befor wi could count ten there
aros a sound of wrath bellow and of crash bough tell
him that the bull wa up and charg at yow
nearer came the bellow and the crash and now he saw the great
brute yow wa leap to and fro in front of it silent after hi
fashion keep out of the reach of it horn while the auroch
charg again and again tear up the ground and stamp with it
feet but never touch yow who thu led it forward as he had been
train to do at length when it wa quit close to the mouth of the
cleft yow sprang and seiz it by the nose hung there
out thei came the pair of them the auroch toss it head and
try to shake off yow who would not leav go rear up also as it
swung the dog from side to side and strike at it with it fore feet
but without avail now it wa alongsid of wi who stood wait
with rais spear like to a man of stone it drop it head hope
to rub yow on the ground and free itself wi saw hi chanc quickli
as a swoop hawk he sprang at it and drove the flint spear through
the bull right ey then thrust upon it with all hi strength the
spear had vanish in the boni socket of the ey with a roar of rage
and pain the auroch toss up it head so mightili that the spear
shaft broke close to the pierc ey and yow wa hurl far awai
torn from hi hold upon the nose though never had the brave hound
unlock hi jaw the bull smelt the man and charg at him along the
narrow path wi flatten himself against the rock for it could not
see him with it blind ey and rush past him though the great
horn touch hi chest it wheel round wi saw and scrambl up the
face of the rock to twice the height of a man where he stood upon a
littl ledg steadi himself with hi left elbow against the root
of a fir
now the auroch caught sight of him and rear itself up on it hind
leg strove to reach him with it horn wi took a second spear in
hi right hand let fall the third and with hi left that wa
now free grip the root of the fir the great mouth of the auroch
appear over the edg of the ledg but becaus of thi ledg it
could not touch him with it horn it open it mouth roar in
it mad rage wi bend forward thrust the second spear down that
cavern of a mouth and deep into the throat beyond it wa wrench
from hi grip blood run from it muzzl the auroch drove
furious at the ledg on which wi stood it horn caught underneath
the ledg and so great wa it strength that it broke a length of the
soft rock awai from the cliff face that length on which wi stood
leav him hang to the root
now he becam awar that yow had reappear for he heard hi low
growl then the growl ceas and he knew that he must have fix
hi fang into the hind part of the bull down went the auroch
seek to kill the hound leap along the path and kick and
down went wi also for hi root broke he land on hi feet turn
and saw the bull a few pace to the left almost doubl into a ball
in it effort to be rid of yow who clung to hi flank or belli wi
pick up hi last spear which lai upon the path the bull came
round and as it came saw him with it unharm ey it charg
drag yow with it wi hurl hi last spear which struck it in the
neck and there remain fix again wi leapt asid but thi time to
the right becaus he must for the bull rush along close to the
bank from which he had fallen the brute saw and wheel came at
him wi caught it by the horn with both hand and hung there be
swung to and fro in the air over the swamp beneath the rotten ground
gave and down went wi the auroch and yow into the mud below
a littl while after wi had left the cave pag wa waken by someon
who shook him by the shoulder he look up and in the low light of
the fire saw that it wa laleela her blue ey wide open her face
distraught as though with fear
awak pag she said i have dream a veri evil dream i dream

spear of wi on fix deep in it ey socket and on in it throat
at the root of the tongu thei note how wi had hack at the beast
head with hi ax strive to sever it neck bone which he could not
do becaus of the thick of the mane and hide but at length
batter it till it di thei marvel at it mighti horn on of
which it had splinter when it tore the ridg of rock upon which wi
stood thei measur it bulk with wand and report it to urk the
ag who wa too old to go so far but said that in the dai of hi
grandfath grandfath a still bigger bull had been kill by hi
greatuncl greatuncl who threw over it a net of withi and
pound it to death with rock while it struggl to be free someon
ask him how he knew thi whereon he answer that hi greatgreat
grandmoth when she wa a hundr winter old had told it to hi
grandmoth who had told it to him when he wa a littl lad
so the bull wa skin the meat on it divid up and the hide
brought home to be a mat for the cave also the head wa brought
carri upon pole by four men and ti to that tree upon which had
been hung the head of henga until pag us it as a bait for the great
tooth tiger ye it wa brought with on of wi spear fix in
the ey socket and anoth whereof the shaft wa champ to piec
fast in it throat there it hung and the peopl came up and stare at
it wi also when he had vomit out all the red mud and rest
himself sat in the mouth of the cave and stare at the great head
hang on the tree wonder how he had found strength to fight that
beast while it live
there aaka spoke with him
you ar a mighti man husband she said so mighti that long ago
you might have made an end of henga if it had pleas you and thu
save our daughter from death i am proud to have born the children
of such a man and yet tell me how came it that pag and moananga
were there to drag you from the mud when the bull roll over on to
you
i dont know wife wi answer but i hear that laleela had
someth to do with the busi she dream someth i know not
what which she told to pag and moananga and thei ran out to seek me
ask her whom i have not seen sinc i woke up
i have sought her husband but she cannot be found yet i do not
doubt that be a witch her witchcraft wa at work here as
alwai
if so in thi case you should not grumbl wife
i do not grumbl i thank her who ha preserv aliv the greatest
man that is told of among the peopl i sai more i think that you
should marri her wi for she ha earn no less onli first you must
find her
as to thi matter of marriag i have made a new law answer wi
shall the maker of law be also the breaker of law
why not said aaka laugh see that he who make can also
break moreov who will find fault with the man that singlehand
could slai thi bull of bull not i for on wi
two of us slew it answer wi look down the hound yow and i
slew it togeth without yow i should have been slain
ay and therefor glori be to yow if i were a lawmak like you
wi i should choos yow to be a god among us
then she smile in her dark fashion and went awai to talk with pag and
moananga for aaka desir to learn the truth of all thi matter
wi sat in the mouth of the cave eat hi food and tell the tale
of the fight to foh hi son who listen with open mouth and stare
ey then he sent foh to help peg out the skin of the bull and when
he wa gone slip from the cave to seek for laleela who could not
be found
not know where to look he walk veri stiffli at first along the
shore by the mouth of the great glacier and round the headland beyond
past the hill and smaller glacier toward the seal bai there if
anywher he thought that he might find laleela sinc thither after
the fight with the red wander her boat had been brought back and
hidden in the littl cave at the head of the bai late in the
afternoon he reach the place and there seat at the mouth of the
small cave he found laleela as though she were wait for the sun to
set or for the moon to rise she start look down but sai
noth
why ar you here he ask sternli
i came to be alon to give thank to the moon that i worship becaus
of a certain dream which wa sent to me and to make my prayer to the
moon when she appear
is it so laleela ar you sure that you did not come for anoth
purpos also and he look toward the cave where her boat wa
hous
i am not sure wi all hang upon the answer that is sent to my
prayer
hearken laleela he said in a voic that wa thick with rage
unless you swear to me that you will not fly awai for a second time
i will drive my ax through the bottom of that boat of your or burn it
with fire
to what purpos wi cannot the seeker of death travel to him by
mani road if on be block a hundr other still remain
why should you seek death he ask passion ar you then so
unhappi here do you hate me so much that you wish to die
now laleela bent her head and shook her long hair about her face as
though to hide her face and spoke to him through the mesh of her
hair sai veri softli
you know that i do not hate you wi but rather that i hold you too
dear yet hear me among my own folk i am name a prophetess on
believ to have gift that ar not given to all and in truth
sometim i think that i have such gift thu when i left my own
peopl i wa sure that i must do so that i might find on who would
be more to me than all other and did i not find him yet now that
gift is upon me again and it tell me that i should do well to go
awai becaus if i bide here i shall bring evil upon the head of on
who is more to me than all other
then stai laleela and togeth let us face thi evil that your
heart foretel
wi we mai face noth quit togeth have you not sworn an oath
and would you break that oath i think not yet if you should be
weak must i therefor ceas from be strong nai draw not near to
me lest mad take you for here and now i swear that oath for you
afresh never will i live to see you mock of aaka and of your
peopl as a man who ha broken hi oath for a woman sake nai
rather would i die twice over
then it is finish said wi with a groan
laleela lift her head and look upward in the sky appear the
even star and on thi star she fix her ey then answer
by what right do you sai that it is finish between us or inde
that anyth is ever finish listen wi among my folk ar wise men
and women who hold that death is not the end of all inde that it
is but the begin and that yonder beyond that star the life we
lai down here will spring afresh and that in thi new life all which
we have lost will be found again i am of that compani i who am
call a prophetess and so i believ who hold therefor that thi
world is of small account and that if onc we find thereon that which
we were sent forth to seek for us it ha serv it purpos and mai
be well forgot
wi stare at her then ask
do you mean that somewher beyond death there is a home where we
shall find those whom we have lost where i shall find foa my child
and the mother who suckl me andand other and there be in joi
and peac with them
ye answer laleela look him in the face and her ey were
bold and happi
at time said wi ay not often but now and again such hope ha
come to me onli to fade awai if i could but be sure that i who am
but what you see a beast that think and talksoh tell me of thi
faith laleela
so speak low and earnestli she set it out to him a simpl faith
inde such as ha been held by chosen on throughout the earth in
all the gener yet a pure and a comfort on while he drank
in her word and hi heart burn with a new fire
now i understand why you were sent to me laleela he said at
length tell me no more tonight i must think i must think
she smile at him veri happili and as thei rose to go said thi
wi there wa more in that dream that came to me thi morn than i
told to pag or ani that dream said to me that you went out secretli
in the dark almost hope that you would not return in the light
perhap he answer briefli for i wa unhappi
who now ar happi again wi see i have promis you that no more
will i flee from you back into the water whenc i came but through
good and ill will stand at your side till the end which is the
begin though not hand in hand do you promis me as much wi
i do laleela
then all is well wi and we can laugh at troubl
ye laleela but there is on thing you know that i love foh my
onli child and alwai i am afraid for foh i am afraid lest the
brother should follow the sister laleela
ceas to be afraid wi i think that on dai foh will be a great
chief over a great tribe
how do you know that he ask eagerli
have i not told you that i am name a prophetess or a witchfrom
thesea as your peopl call me she answer and smile at him
again
chapter xvii

god she ask and turn left him
from that hour began the great troubl the winter wa terribl none
had known such a winter even urk the ag declar that weather so
fierc had not been told of sinc the dai of hi grandfath great
grandfath the wind howl continu from the north and east and
whenev thei sank a littl snow fell till it wa pile up in great
drift out of which in place onli the top of the fir appear
drift that almost swallow up the hut so that men must throw asid
the snow from dai to dai to come to each other the sea too wa more
frozen than ever it had been befor and through the pack ic move
great berg like mountain crash their road southward on which
berg might be seen number of terribl white bear that scrambl
from them to the shore seek what thei might devour for if ani of
the seal on which thei live were left these were hidden beneath the
ic where the bear could not come at them
from month to month the peopl live upon such food as wi in hi
wisdom had store up for them though now and again led by him and
moananga thei must go out against the bear that made mad by hunger
even strove to tear a wai through the side and roof of the hut in
these fight a number of them perish be maul by the bear or
dy of the cold while thei wait for them also mani of the old
peopl and young children di of thi same cold especi in those
hut where notwithstand wi order enough wood and dri seawe
had not been store for now no seawe could be got and becaus of
the snowdrift and the blizzard it wa imposs to go to the
forest and thenc to bring more wood
dure all thi time of suffer and of terror wi went to and fro
with a smile face do the best he could to help even the
humblest shelter them in the cave share the chief food with
them and even the fuel of which he had gather so great a store
laleela too cherish the outcast babe and wept as on by on thei
di of the bitter frost that pour into the open mouth of the cave
and struck them through their wrap
at last the black winter month pass awai give place to those of
spring yet no spring came the snow it is true ceas to fall and
the pack ic off the shore grew thinner also the river began to run
turbidli fill with brine rather than water and the tree of the
wood appear again out of their white bed blacken and dead for
the most part but there wa no green where there should have been
grass no spring flower bloom the fir bud did not burst no seal
or bird appear while the cold remain like to that of a winter
when wi wa a lad
great murmur went up from the tribe tale had gone from mouth to
mouth
the curs ha come upon us said these tale a curs brought by
the fair witchofthesea
moreov there spread a rumour that wi their chief had desert the
icegod whom all had worship sinc the dai of urk grandfath
greatgrandfath and perhap even earlier that now he bent to the
knee to some other god that of the witchofthesea as aaka would
sai nothingalthough perchanc alreadi she had said too muchand as
thei dare not ask the truth of wi he who had slain henga and the
great tooth tiger and the bull of bull and wa therefor more than
a man chosen on from among the peopl waylaid pag who wa wi
chief counsellor and question him he listen grimli wrap up
in hi skin rug and watch them with hi on ey then answer
i know noth of thi matter of god i who put no faith in ani
god all i know is that the weather ha chang for the wors also
that as for the oath which wi swore he ha kept it well see that
although a veri fair on lai to hi hand he ha taken no other wife
which he might have donefor she whom he ha doe not treat him
kindli for the rest if you ar not content to die quietli as it
seem that we must do and would find out what is the will of the
god go and ask it of those who dwell in the ic yonder ay let all
those who complain gather themselv togeth and let wi and those
who cling to him of whom i am on gather themselv togeth also
then let us go up and stand befor the icegod in whom you put faith
and make sacrific to them if there be anyth left to offer and
ask them for an oracl
thu spoke pag in hi bitter and mockeri never guess that
those poor tortur and bewild folk would pai heed to hi word
yet thi thei did for these seem to them a tree to cling to as thei
were swept awai by the flood of miseri sure the god to whom their
father had bent the knee from the begin must exist sure thei
would listen if the peopl appear befor them and offer them
sacrific and would caus the ic to melt and the spring to come
the peopl took counsel togeth and at last sent some of their
number to the mouth of the cave to speak with wi ngae he who made
charm the priest of the icegod and pitok and hou and whaka
among them so thei went up to the cave have chosen hotoa the slow
speech and urk the ancient as their spokesmen and at the mouth of
the cave winiwini the shudder blew three blast upon hi horn
accord to the old custom when the peopl desir to talk with the
chief
wi came forth wear hi robe that wa made of the hide of the long
tooth tiger which he had kill and saw the spokesmen stand
befor him shamefac and with downcast ey while behind them
gather upon the meet place where he had fought henga the mass of
the peopl or those who were left of them were huddl togeth
miser
what would you with me he ask
chief mumbl urk we ar sent to sai that the peopl can no
longer bear the curs which ha fallen upon them we hear that the
witchfromthesea who brought the curs ha chang your heart so
that you have ceas to worship the ancient god who dwell in the ic
and have set up some other god in your heart wherefor the ic
dweller ar angri we ask you if thi be true
it is true answer wi steadfastli no longer do i worship the
icegod becaus there ar no such god those that dwell in the ic
ar but a great beast and a man both of whom have been dead from the
begin
now the messeng look at each other and shiver for to them
these word were horribl while ngae the priest wave hi hand and
mutter prayer or spell then urk went on
we fear that thi wa so hearken chief it ha been hand down
to me from my forefath that onc when the peopl were starv
becaus of bad season the chief offer up hi son as a sacrific to
the icegod ye he kill hi son befor them whereon the god
were appeas the season chang the seal and the fish return in
plenti and all wa well
do you demand that i should sacrific my son ask wi
chief ngae the priest of the icegod like hi father befor him
the weaver of spell and taren hi wife the seeress have made
divin and wisdom ha come upon them ye a voic ha spoken to
them from the roof of their hut in the dead of night
and what said the voic ask wi lean on hi ax and look at
ngae tell me you to whom it spoke
then the lank evilfac ngae pipe an answer in hi thin voic
chief the voic said that the icegod must have their sacrific and
that thi sacrific must walk upon two leg
did it name the sacrific ngae
nai yet it said that it must be chosen by the chief from the chief
household and thereaft be offer with hi own hand yonder in the
holi place befor the face of the god
name my household said wi
chief there ar but three of them aaka your wife foh your son and
the witchfromthesea who is your second wife
i have no second wife answer wi in that matter as in all
other i have kept the oath which i made to the peopl
we hold that she is your second wife also that she ha brought the
curs upon us as she brought the red wander repli ngae
stubbornli while the other nod their head in assent we
demand he went on that you choos on of these three to be offer
to the icedwel at sunset on the night of full moon which is the
appoint hour of sacrific when the sun and the moon look at each
other across the sky
and if i refus said wi quietli
now ngae look at urk and urk answer
if you refus chief thi is the decre of the peoplethi is their
messag to you thei will kill all these three aaka your wife foh

will do howev whenev and wherev thei can catch them by dai or
by night wake or sleep walk or eat and have slain
them thei will take their bodi and lai them as an offer on the
threshold of the dweller in the ic
why not kill me ask wi
chiefbecaus you ar the chief who mai onli be slain by on who is
stronger than he as you slew henga and who is there that is stronger
than you ar or who dare stand befor you
so like wolv you would kill the weak and let the mighti be said
wi with scorn well messeng well voic of the peopl go back
to them and sai that wi the chief will take counsel with himself as to
thi matter which you have brought befor him tomorrow at thi same
hour of middai return to me and i shall speak my heart to you and to
the peopl so that tomorrow night at the set of the sun the
sacrific if sacrific there must be mai be accomplish when the
sun and the full moon look at each other across the ski
then thei went shrink befor hi ey which seem to burn them
like fire
now of thi talk wi said noth to anyno not even to aaka or pag
or laleela though perchanc thei all knew it for when thei met him
thei look upon him strang as did even foh hi son or so it
seem to him that afternoon go to the mouth of the cave he saw
that a larg fire had been lit down among the hut and that round it
mani were gather as though at a feast
perhap thei have found a dead seal and cook it said wi to himself
as he stood there wonder pag and moananga came up and he note
that moananga wa bruis as though he had been fight
what pass yonder ask wi
thi brother answer moananga and there wa horror in hi voic
those of the peopl who have eaten all their store and to whom by
your order no more mai be given till after the night of the full
moon and who ar therefor starv have slaughter two girl
children and cook and devour them i tri to stai them but thei
fell me with club for thei ar fierc as wolv and more savag
is it so said wi in a low voic for hi heart wa sick in him
shall we gather men and fall on them and kill them ask moananga
of what us to shed more blood answer wi thei ar starv
brute and such will fill themselv hearken i go out to think let
none follow me for i would be alon fear not i shall return yet
keep watch over the other children for there ar mani famish
yonder
so wi went along the base of the hill that thi spring were cover
with thick ic such as had never been seen upon them befor thi
ic inde had crept down from the glacier abov almost to the
seashor and he note that where it end it thick wa that of
the height of three spear ti on to anoth and wonder what it
might be in the cleft farther up the slope of the hill wi came to
the vallei that wa call the home of the icegod and went up to it
lo the great glacier had move forward for the last wand that he had
set to measur it advanc wa cover and the rock that the ic had
push in front of it were pile into a heap or ridg that separ
the vallei into two part a larger part to the left as he face the
glacier in front of the sleeper and a smaller part to the right where
the ic wa not so steep wi look at the sleeper and the man it
seem to him that thei were nearer than ever thei had been befor
for he could see them both more clearli although thei were also
higher up in the ic
these god travel he said to himself then he cross the ridg of
piledup stone and sat himself down upon a rock to think as more
than onc he had done befor then he had come thither becaus the
place wa holi to him now it wa no longer holi but he sought it
becaus he knew that he would be alon for none dare enter it at
nightfal wi watch the edg of the sun sink toward the west and
the edg of the moon rise in the east and began to prai
o that which laleela worship and ha taught me to worship hear me
he prai behold i am helpless those poor starv folk seek to
kill the on i love and sai to me choos the victim and if i
choos not thei will kill them thei sai that the icegod demand a
human sacrific and that thi sacrific must be given to them o that
which laleela worship tell me what i must do
thu he prai in rough and simpl word with hi heart rather than
with hi lip and have prai fell into thought commun with
hi own soul
the place wa veri silent the frozen air hung heavili on either side
rose the black rock wall of the gulf in front wa the blue ic full
of reflect light and abov to the left of him were the grim
figur of the dead man of long ago be hunt from ag to ag by
the enorm shadowi unknown beast in thi dread hous of the god
of hi peopl wi bow hi head and commun with hi soul and not
onli with hi own soul but as it seem to him with the soul of
all who had begotten him for he sought not hi own wisdom onli but
that of hi race
what now should he do the tribe believ in the icegod as their
forefath had done back and back forev and though he had come to
reject those god as god still he also believ in them as devil
the bearer of miseri the tribe believ that if the sacrific in
which ran the blood of man were made to the god these would ceas
from torment them and that onc more thei would have plenti and
live as their ancestor had live
it might be so it might be that devil could onli be made kind by
blood offer and that the devil were near while the real god
were far awai at least so held the peopl who were starv and
desper and whose soothsay had declar that on of hi own
household must be offer up to these their god from gener to
gener as legend told had been done in the past by chief who
rule befor him moreov if that offer were not made thei would
make it for themselv by murder therefor an offer must be made
and on him wa laid the burden of thi dread choic
who then should he give up to be butcher aaka the wife of hi
youth whom he still love although she treat him so unkindli
never the veri thought of such a deed made him burn with shame even
in that cold laleela the sweet on from the south whose beauti wa
that of a star and whose breath wa as the balm from fir tree she
whose wisdom had given him peac she who had offer her life for
hi never then who remain onli foh hi son the on child that
wa left to him the bright brave lad of promis who as laleela had
prophesi might live on to becom a better and more famou man than
he had been and to beget children to succe him should he stand by
and see the throat of foh cut befor the icegod that the smoke of
hi blood might rise to their nostril and give them pleasur never
who then remain of hi household to satisfi the hunger of the god
and to take awai the fear of the peopl on onli he wi himself
whom thei dare not touch becaus he wa chief and too strong for
them
a while ago in hi wretched he had gone up to fight the great
bull in the wood half hope that the bull would prevail against
him who had no more desir to live afterward laleela had taught him
certain lesson amongst other that it wa wrong to die thu to
pleas himself and to cast the burden from hi back upon the back
of those who came after him but laleela had never taught him that it
wa wrong to die for other inde she herself had shown that she
wa readi to do thi veri thing when she leapt in the path of the
littl spear and when she row out to sea to perish there in her
hollow log that he might be no more reproach or mock perchanc
if he di the devil whom onc he thought to be god would be
appeas and the sun would shine again as it us to do and the snow
and ic would melt and the beast and the bird would return and give
the peopl food wa it not well that on should die for the sake of
mani should he hold back hi own life if by the give of it mani
might be help or even believ that thei would be help sure
thi must be given nor should he griev overmuch to whom laleela had
taught certain lesson except that for a littl while he would be
call upon to leav foh and her behind him
such were the lesson that the soul of wi taught to wi there in the
ici silenc of the glacier
wi rose up and laugh aloud he stood upon the pile of iceborn
stone a tini form in that tremend place and shook hi ax at the
sleeper and at him whom the sleeper hunt and at the shadowi shape
that seem to crowd about these in the moonlight the tower
chang shape that the peopl held to be those of god
i defi you he cri hi voic echo strang from the mighti
ic cliff and the wall of rock ye shall have your sacrific my
blood shall steam befor you ye shall feed on death then be
full ye and those that worship you those from whom ye draw your
strength shall come face to face with that which is greater than ye
ar ye ye the demand of sacrific shall yourselv be
sacrif to that which is greater than ye ar
thu cri wi in hi mad scarc know what it wa he said or
why such word broke from him
but from the icegod there came no answer still the hunter and the
hunt stare at him still the frost bit and the deep silenc
reign and the moon shone on abov as he a defeat desper
man crept halffrozen back to whenc he came
when wi reach the cave he saw crouch in front of it a singl
figur wrap up in fur it wa pag who await him
what counsel from the icedwel ask pag ey him strang
out of noth come noth answer wi what do you here
there ar three within whom i watch said pag hearken i know all
as do the other and if the icedwel ar dumb i have counsel it
is that we threeyou moananga and ifal upon certain on whom
you know those who spoke with you todai now in the night and slai
them then lack leader the rest will scatter and hide their
head for thei ar coward
i will shed no blood said wi not even that of those who hate me
for miseri make them mad
then other blood will be shed that of those who love you
i think not said wi still watch them well who walk in the midst
of hungri wolv then he enter the cave and laid himself down
between foh and aaka for he had sent command to aaka that she must no
more sleep alon in her hut

wi went into the cave and at talk with foh as he at and tell
him tale of wild beast and how he had slain them such as the lad
love to hear but to aaka and laleela he spoke no word nor to pag
either for spear in hand pag kept guard at the mouth of the cave
and moananga with him yet laleela watch him from far off
wonder what hi soul had said to wi yonder in the home of the god
or perhap she did not wonder perhap hi soul had told her soul and
she knew
after he had eaten wi lai down and slept awhil when it drew toward
sunset he rose and call to aaka and laleela to foh and to pag
also to moananga and hi wife tana to cover themselv with their fur
cloak for the air wa cold and to accompani him to the home of the
god then he wrap himself in hi tigerskin robe took hi ax
pag gift and two spear and led the wai past the white hill that
rose abov the beach to the gulf in the mountain where the blue ic
shone and the sleeper slept as he pass from the cave he note that
the most of those who were left of the peopl were come togeth on
the gatheringground where he had fought henga and watch him a
strang and silent compani present look back he saw that thei
were follow him still silent much as a pack of hungri wolv
follow a littl herd of deer ye that wa what thei look like
upon the white snow which thi season would not melt a pack of wolv
creep after a littl herd of deer
wi came to the glacier gulf and climb up it follow by hi
household till he reach the foot of the ic then he bade them
stand on the right of the littl ridg of stone that the ic had
push befor it where there wa a narrow strip or bai of ground
between these stone and the rock wall of the cleft which wa not
overhung by the ic for here the rocki gulf bulg outward so that
on it no ic could lie the mighti glacier be to the west on the
left of the stone
thi is a strait place husband said aaka which give us but
littl stand room
we ar few wife he answer and those who come ar mani
moreov stand here where the rock slope outward we can be seen
and heard of all who gather befor the face of the ic
led by the elder the peopl came and as thei came wi point with
hi spear show them that thei should take their place to the left
of the stone where the vallei wa broad and in summer a stream ran
from the ic which stream wa now frozen so there thei gather on
the bed of that stream famili by famili for all the tribe that could
walk had come to see thi sacrific to the ancient god
at length all were there and stood still wi climb upon a rock in
the littl bai of the eastern cliff over against them and stood
there a figur of fire for the light from the sink sun struck
full upon him while the great compani of the peopl were in shadow
i wi the chief am here and my household with me he cri and in
that great cold silenc hi voic echo from the wall of ic and
rock now tell me o peoplewhat is your will with me and mine
then out of the shadow answer the pipe voic of ngae the
divin the priest the weaver of spell sai
thi is our will chief that you choos for sacrific on of your
household that the god of our father mai smell the blood and lift
from off us the curs that ha been brought upon us by laleela the
witchfromthesea whom against your oath you have taken to wife
on that matter i have answer you alreadi cri wi across the
gulf but let it be now do you o peopl put up your prayer to your
god and when that prayer is finish if to it no answer come i
will name the sacrific
then ngae in hi thin pipe voic began to prai to the god out of
the shadow
o icedwel he said ye whom our father have worship from
of old hearken to our tale a while ago he who is our chief made new
law and becaus the women among us were veri few decre that no
man should take more than on wife also he swore that he himself
would keep hi own law and should he break it he call down your
curs upon hi head and upon those of all the tribe
o ye ancient god there rose out of the sea a veri fair witch whom
thi chief of our ha taken to wife break hi oath therefor the
curs that he creat in your name is fallen upon us therefor the
season have chang the seal and the fish do not come there ar no
fowl and no deer in the wood and where there should be grass and
flower there is naught but ic and snow therefor too we starv
and die and must fill ourselv with the flesh of our own children
becaus you o god ar wroth with us
now hearken o ye god it ha come to us from the former dai
father tell the tale to son through mani gener that in the
far past such evil have happen to those who begat us and ar now
forgotten for then too you were wroth with us becaus of the
wicked of those who rule over us turn their back on you ye
god yet afterward that wrath of your wa appeas by a sacrific
chosen from among the household of the chief and thu the curs wa
lift from us and again we were full of food but never did ani
chief of our sin so greatli against you as doe thi wi who rule
over us todai and who is so mighti a man that none of us mai stand
against him to fight and kill him thu ha he sin o ye god from
of old not onli ha he broken hi oath but led of the witchfrom
thesea he ha reject you and revil you sai that ye ar no
god but devil and that he worship anoth power without a name
to whose feet he ha been led by the magic of the witchfromthesea
therefor we your servant from the begin have made known and
declar to him that no common sacrific will satisfi hi sin but
that the blood to be shed must be that of on of hi own famili ay
the blood of a wife or that of hi son such is the case that we lai
befor ye o ye god we your servant of old now let wi the mighti
man our chief who reject you make answer to it if he is abl and
then let the sacrific be offer that your curs mai be lift from
off us and that we who perish with cold and hunger mai live again
the pipe voic of ngae di and for a while there wa silenc
then stand on a rock wi made answer
o ye icedwel whom onc i worship as good god but whom now i
know to be devil and bearer of evil hear my word your priest said
that i have sworn an oath and it is so yet he is a liar for that
oath i have not broken true it is that a curs ha fallen upon us
becaus the season have chang their cours yet that curs began to
fall er ever the woman whom thei name witchfromthesea set foot
upon our shore now the tribe demand a sacrific of blood to be name
by me from among my household believ that by virtu of thi shed
blood the curs will be lift from them and spring and summer will
return as aforetim bring plenti
o ye icedwel that sacrific is readi to be offer i wi am
that sacrific i wi name myself as the victim whose blood must
flow yet first er i fall upon my spear or stretch out my throat to
the priest i make prayer to that which is abov both you and me hear
me now o power without a name o power in whom i have learn to
trust is it your will that i should die as an offer to these
devil the dweller in the ic answer for i am readi the peopl
ar in miseri thei ar mad i blame them not i into whose hand thei
were given to feed and guid if by the shed of my blood their
woe can be wash awai then let it be outpour judg then o
power between me and the peopl for whom i have labour vainli and
the evil god thei worship who rejoic in miseri and desir death
judg o power without a name turn the heart of these men if thei
can be turn and break the bond that bind them but if thi mai not
be if have heard me still the peopl desir sacrific or by my
blood their miseri can be wash awai then let me die for them
thu prai wi to the strength that dwelt abov and to the folk whom
he had cherish here upon the earth ask for no sign nor for ani
vengeanc put up no plea for piti yet hope that thi strength
might find a wai to turn them from their bloodi purpos so that no
longer in the name of their god thei should demand the life of him or
hi as he prai the light of the dy sun fade from him stand
there in the bai of the cliff so that hi last word were spoken out
of the deep gloom while the light of the rise moon grew and
gather upon the glacier face and upon the savag hord beneath who
stare up toward him upon the rock
he ceas and for a while there wa a great silenc and through that
silenc there came home to the heart of wi the hunter wi the wild
man knowledg that he plai hi part in a war of god ye in the
etern fight between the evil and the good suddenli he knew that
those icedwel whom the peopl worship as onc he had done
were naught but the evil in their own heart given form and name and
that the unknown on whom now he worship wa the good in their
heart and hi heart of which laleela had open the door so that it
might enter there the good which now he saw and felt but which as yet
thei did not understand which then would prevail he wonder to
himselfy wonder calmli even coldli as though he judg
anoth case and in that great wonder all fear left him and with
it the thought of the agoni of death and of the love that he must
leav behind
he look down upon the peopl and by the shimmer moonlight
watch their face thei were disturb thei began to whisper on to
anoth thei grew sadei and some of the women wept he caught
snatch of their talk
he ha been kind to us thei said he ha done all that man can do
he is not the lord of the season he doe not caus the bird to fly
or the seal to swim why should he not take anoth wife if it
pleas him can the god demand hi blood or that of hi wive or
son why should he be sacrif leav us leaderless
such were the word that thei murmur on to anoth
the good conquer the ill goe down thought wi still judg of
the case as though it were not hi own
but ngae the weaver of spell who hate him also saw and heard he
ran out from among them he stood face them with hi back to the ic
slope he cri in hi thin pierc voic
hear me the priest of the icegod as were my father befor me
hear me ye peopl wi the oathbreak wi through whom the curs
ha fallen on you plead with you for hi life if he is afraid to
die then let him give anoth to the god let him give aaka the
proud or the white witchfromthesea or foh hi son did we ask for
hi blood would we kill him the chief not so if he di it is by
hi own choic and of hi own will therefor let not your heart be
soften by hi plead rememb what he is out of hi own mouth
he ha declar himself a revil of the god he ha set up anoth
god and in their veri presenc make prayer to it name them devil
sure for thi he is worthi of death sure becaus of thi
blasphemi the god will be aveng yet we seek not hi life let him
give to us on of the other let him give to us that white witch
fromthesea that we mai bind her and caus her to die here and now
i tell you peopl i who am the priest and to whom the god talk
that if you go henc have rob them of their sacrific you shall
starv ye you shall die as mani of us have di alreadi of
sick and want and cold more you shall eat on anoth and kill
on anoth till at last none is left will you starv will you see
your children devour look and he turn point behind him at
the shadow which the moonlight caus to appear in the deep clear
ic the god ar move thei gather wait for their feast will
you dare to rob them of their feast do so and you shall becom everi
on of you like that dead on who fli befor the sleeper do you
not see them move
now a groan cry went up from the peopl
we see them we see them
and will you rob them of their feast ask the fiercefac ngae
again
nai thei shout take fire let the sacrific be sacrif
let us see the red blood flow let the icegod whom our father
worship smell the red blood
wi you have your answer pipe ngae as the shout di now
come hither and die if you dare or if you dare not then send us on
of your household
aaka hold foh by the hand laleela pag moananga and hi wife
cluster togeth as though to take counsel wi prepar to descend
from hi rock perchanc to fall upon hi spear perchanc to give
himself up to be butcher by the peopl and their priest
then it wa that someth at first none knew what began to happen
that caus all to stand silent each in hi place like men that had
been smitten to stone from high up in the air although no wind blew
there came a moan sound as if out of sight countless greatwing
bird were fly the air seem to chang it grew more ici cold
men breath froze upon it the shadow in the ic shrank and grew in
the waver moonbeam thei advanc thei flit back quickli and
depart onli to appear again here and there high abov where thei
had been
the hairi man who stood befor the sleeper seem to move a littl
sure thei saw him move
the earth trembl as though it were fill with dread and deeper and
deeper grew the silenc till suddenli it wa broken by an aw
crack like to that of the fiercest thunder as it echo di awai
out of the bowel of the ic rush the sleeper and he whom it
appear to hunt yea the whitetusk sleeper rush like a charg
bull it sped forward like a stone from a sling the frozen man wa
thrown far and vanish but the mighti sleeper fell full on ngae the
priest who still stood stare upward crush him to powder and
pass on plough a red path through the folk beyond
again for a moment there wa silenc and in that silenc wi said
speak out of the dark as on who dream
it would seem that the icegod have taken their sacrific
as the word di upon hi lip with an aw rend sound
companion by whirlwind the great glacier move forward in a slow
and deadli march it advanc down the vallei thrust rock in
front of it heav itself into wave like a tumultu sea dig
up the solid ground while befor it great boulder leapt and danc
the boulder danc through the peopl and ic flow over them ye
as thei turn to fly it flow over them so that present where
thei had been there wa noth but a deep sea of tumbl heav
ic that travel toward the beach
wi leapt from hi rock with those of hi hous he huddl further
back into the littl bai of the mountain side and there protect by
the wall of the cliff watch the river of ic grind and thunder
past them how long did thei watch none ever knew thei saw it flow
thei saw it creep into the sea and there break off in sharptop
hill of ic then as suddenli as it had begun to move it stop
and the night wa as the night had been onli now the vallei of the
god wa a vallei of ic and where the glacier had been were slope
and wall of smooth black rock
when all wa over wi spoke to the littl compani who clung to him
sai
the icegod have given birth the old devilgod have taken a great
sacrific of all who serv them but that which i and anoth worship
ha heard our prayer and preserv us aliv let us go back to the
cave
so wi lead them thei climb out of the bai in the mountain side
up on to the steep cliff of tumbl ic that had flow down the
vallei fill it from side to side purpos to return to the
villag but when thei reach it crest and look toward where the
beach should be and the hut of the peopl thei sank down amaz and
terrifi for behold no beach wa left behold the ic gather
upon the smaller hill behind the villag also had flow down over it
into the sea so that where the dwell place of the peopl had been
now there wa noth but a rough slope of tumbl ic wash up by
the wave of the troubl sea the tribe that had dwelt upon thi
beach for ag wa gone and with it it habit that now lai
buri forev swept from the face of the world
aaka lean upon wi studi all thing in the cold moonlight then
she said
the curs brought by that fair witch of your ha work well
husband so well that i wonder what remain for her to do
after all that ha pass wife such word seem to me to be evil
answer wi the peopl who call upon the icedwel where ar
thei sure thei have becom dweller in the ic yet i who learn
anoth lesson from her whom you reproach i who thought by thi time
to be a sacrific remain aliv and with me all my hous is thi
then a time for bitter word wife
then pag spoke sai
as you well know wi never did i put faith in the icegod becaus
our peopl have made sacrific to them and have danc befor them for
a thousand year and now i believ in them less than ever see
that those who worship them ar swept awai and those who reject
them live on the peopl have gone not on of them remain aliv
except thi littl compani a hand out of hundr thei have gone
thei lie buri in the ic as thousand of year ago the great
sleeper that fell on ngae and crush him and he who hunt it or by
it wa hunt were buri there thei lie who perchanc in their turn
will becom god in a dai to come and be worship by the fool that
follow after us yet we still breath and all the rest be dead
how shall we save ourselv the children who were born of the
marriag of those icegod have eaten up our home the beach is no
more noth remain whither then shall we go who if we stai here
upon the ic veri soon must perish
wi cover hi ey with hi hand and made no answer for he wa
brokenheart
then for the first time spoke laleela who hitherto had been silent
sai noth at all even when wi offer himself as the sacrific
be pleas to hear me she said as the moonlight show you the
ic ha flow down over the beach and the hut and the wood beyond
yet on the farther side of the ridg that bound the vallei of the
god and the littl hill beyond it ha not flow for there the ic
sheet is flat beneath the snow and cannot stir of it own weight
yonder to the east there is a littl cave that in which the boat li
that brought me to thi land and there i have hidden food if it
pleas you let us go to that cave and shelter there
ay let us go to the cave for if we stai here upon the ic we shall
perish said pag
so climb round the foot of the mountain and the hill beyond thei
came at length to the open beach where lai some snow but no ic and
walk by the edg of the sea to the littl cave
pag and moananga go first reach it befor the other pag
peer in start back for he saw larg ey look at him out of
it dark
have a care he call to moananga here ar bear or wolv
the sound of hi voic frighten the beast in the cave and move
slowli these came out on to the beach whereon thei saw that thei
were not bear or wolv but two seal a larg cow and her half
grown cub that had refug there perhap becaus thei were frighten
by the sound of the glacier rush into the sea thei leapt upon the
clumsi beast and befor these could escap kill them with their
ax
here at least is meat enough to last us for a long while said pag
when the seal were dead now let us skin them befor thei freez
so help by foh thei set to the task and wellnigh finish it by
moonlight befor wi came up with the women for tana wa so frighten
by the horror she had seen that aaka and laleela must support her
and thu thei could onli walk slowli through the snow
then have search the cave and made sure that now it wa empti
thei enter it and lit a fire round which thei crouch to warm
themselv silent and full of terror
chapter xix
which
befor the come of the dawn wi left the cave and climb a littl
hill behind it that wa built up of ancient iceborn rock and drift
in which thi hollow cavern lai thi he did becaus he wish to
look at the land and the sea when the light came also to be alon and
think yet he found that he wa not alon for kneel behind on of
the rock wa laleela prai with her face turn toward the
sink moon when she saw who it wa that came she did not stir but
went on prai and kneel at her side he prai with her for now
thei had on worship though neither of them altogeth understood who
or what thei worship
their prayer finish thei spoke togeth
strang thing have happen laleela said wi and my heart is
pierc becaus of the peopl who ar dead i would have offer
myself as a sacrific if thei sought it know thei believ that
therebi a curs would have been taken from them and that what is
believ often come to pass yet i live on and thei ar slaineveri
on of themand i sai that my heart is broken and for the first
time sinc foa wa murder wi bow hi head and wept
laleela took hi hand and comfort him wipe awai hi tear with
her hair then she said in her gentl voic
thing have come about as thei were decre and those who sought
blood have di in blood crush to powder by the god thei
worship whether by chanc or by the will of that which dwell
yonder i do not know or seek to learn onli wi you do ill to wish
to slai yourself or suffer yourself to be slain and she ad with
a thrill of fear in her voic who can be sure that what ha been
offer to heaven heaven will not take at it own time
not i answer wi yet laleela what would you have had me do if
i had refus ani sacrific to those mad folk thei would have done
what thei swore and murder aaka and foh and you all three
therefor a blood offer must be furnish out of my household and
would you have had me name on of you and myself remain aliv
i brought the troubl wi sure i should have paid it price
inde i would have given myself up to them who hate me and sought
my blood not your had not a voic speak in my breast told me
that in some wai you would be spare also at the last i felt that a
terror wa at hand though what it might be i did not know
so i think did all of us laleela for last night the air wa big
with death but you do not answer what would you have thought of me
when the spear wa at your throat had i said take yonder laleela
whom you declar a witch offer her to your god and be content
i should have thought you a wiser man than you ar wi she said
smile sadli yet believ me i thank you who ar nobl nor
should i live ten thousand year shall i forget no never never
shall i forget
if you live ten thousand year laleela perhap i shall alsowher
there is less troubl
i am sure that it will be so she repli simpli
the dawn came and stand side by side in silenc thei watch it
come it wa a strang and splendid dawn full of red light which
shone upon the littl cloud that float in the quiet sky and turn
them to shape of glori ye it wa as though natur have done her
worst now lai rest in perfect peac but oh what a sight wa
reveal to them where the villag had been wa ic pile so high
that thei could see it tumbl mass and pinnacl over the shoulder
of the hill between the great wood also where wi had kill the
auroch bull that swell upward from the beach westward had
vanish beneath the flood of ic which flow down upon them from the
mountain that lai behind which now show black rob of their
white cloak in front too far as the ey could reach the sea wa
cover with a sheet of solid ic so press togeth by the weight
of the glacier that had plung into it from the hill and the vallei
of the god that it seem quit smooth and immov as rock be
held in place by the headland round which the red wander had come
in their cano all the white world wa a desol and a wast
what ha chanc said wi stare about him is the world about to
end
i think not answer laleela i think that the ic is move
south that is all and that where men live there thei can live no
moreneith thei nor the beast
then we must perish laleela
why so my boat remain and a store of food and i think it will hold
us all
your boat cannot float upon ic laleela
nai but be hollow from on tree it is veri thick and strong so
that we can push it befor us until at length we come to open water
over which we can row awai
where to laleela
down yonder to the south across a stretch of sea that li beyond
that headland is the home of my peopl wi it li in a veri
pleasant land full of wood and river where i think the ic will not
reach becaus that sea which border it even in winter is alwai
warm inde sometim ic mountain from the north float into it
for i have seen them from far awai but there at onc thei melt my
peopl ar not as your peopl wi for thei have tame creatur like
to the bull you slew and other from which thei draw milk and on
whose flesh thei feed also thei ar a peac folk who for a long
while past have wage no war and live quietli till death take them
yet you fled awai from these peopl laleela
ye wi and now i understand why i fled but let that be also
although i fled i think that should i return thei would welcom me
who am a great woman among them and ani whom i brought with me
still the wai is far and yonder ic is rough and cold and who
know perchanc it would be better to bide here
that we cannot do answer wi look all the shore is ic and all
the wood ar ic and all the sea whenc we won the most of our food
is ic while behind us is noth but a wilder of black rock upon
which noth grow as i am sure who in past dai have hunt the
reindeer across it also to the east yonder is a wall of mountain
that we cannot climb for thei ar steep and on them the snow li
thick still let us talk with the other
so thei descend the hillock of piledup stone and at the mouth of
the littl cave found aaka stand there like on who wait
ar your prayer to the new god finish wi she ask if so i
would learn whether it priestess give us leav to eat of the food
which she ha store here while so mani who now ar dead were
starv
hear these word wi bit upon hi lip but laleela answer
aaka all in thi place is your not mine yet of that food know
that i save it out of what wa serv out to me for a certain
purpos name to store in my boat when i fled awai from where i wa
not welcom
now pag who wa stand by grin but wi said onli
have done and let us eat
so thei at who had tast noth sinc noon on the yesterdai and
when thei had fill themselv after a fashion wi spoke to them
sai
the home of our forefath is destroi and with it all the peopl
of whom we alon ar left ye the ic that ha pile itself abov us
for mani year ha broken it bound and rush to the sea ha
buri them as i for on who mark it cours from winter to winter
alwai thought that it would do on dai now what is left to us we
cannot stai here there is no food moreov doubtless driven by the
ic wolv and great bear will come down from the north and devour
us therefor thi is my word that we fly south over the ic
drag the boat of laleela with us till we reach open water and
then travel across that water to find some warmer land where the ic
ha not come
you ar our master said aaka and when you command we must obei
yet i hold that the journei we make in laleela boat will end in
evil for us if not for her
then pag spoke sai
noth can be wors than the worst here certainli we die yonder we
mai live who in the end cannot do more than die
pag word ar mine said moananga when wi look toward him but
tana wa silent becaus fear had rob her of all spirit and laleela
also held her peac onli while thei still stare at the ground the
boi foh cri out
the chief my father ha spoken is it for us to weigh hi word
no on answer so thei rose up and lade the cano with the food
that laleela had store and the cutup flesh of the two seal which
now wa frozen stiff the skin of the seal thei us although these
were undress for cover lash them over the food with the
paddl and some wood of which other might be made lastli at
laleela bid thei took a young fir tree that lai in the cave
over which in former dai the seal pelt had been hung to dry that it
might serv to make them a mast though except laleela none of them
knew anyth of the us of mast also upon their back thei bound
load of dry wood and seawe for the make of fire wrap up in
such hide as lai in the cave
these thing done thei drag the boat over the snow to the ic that
cover the sea and awai out on to the ic southward laleela walk
ahead to guid them and carri a pole in her hand with which she
test the ic
thu then did wi and the other bid farewel to the home of their
father which thei were never to see again
for some hour thei drag the boat thu make but littl progress
for the face of the pack ic wa much rougher than it seem to be
when look at from the shore then rest a while and at some of
their food when thei rose to try to go forward though by now most of
them thought the task hopeless foh cri out
father thi ic move when we stop those rock on the headland
were over against us and now look thei ar behind
it seem that it is so but i am not sure said wi
while thei discuss the matter pag wander back upon their track
present he return and said
certainli it move the ic sheet ha broken behind us and there is
water fill with hummock that grind against each other between us
and the shore to which now we cannot return
then thei knew that a current wa bear them southward and some of
them were frighten but wi said
let us rather be thank for so shall we travel faster
still thei continu to push and drag the boat over the rough ic
though thi thei did chiefli that thei might keep themselv warm who
fear that thei would freez if thei remain still for too long so
thei toil all dai till toward nightfal thei came to ic upon
which snow had fallen and lai deep moreov it began to fall again
so that thei must stop and make themselv a kind of hut of snow
block as thei knew well how to do in which hut thei crouch all
night to protect themselv from cold
next morn thei found that the snow had ceas also that now thei
were out of sight of the mountain that stood at the back of the beach
which wa their home though thei could still see snowcov peak
on the headland to the east of them veri far awai leav the hut
thei drag the boat forward over the surfac of the snow which had
frozen so that now it wa easi to travel and thu made good
progress all that dai rest from time to time thei went on thu
till late in the afternoon the snow began to grow soft and it wa
difficult to draw the boat through it therefor thei stop be
tire and built themselv anoth snow hut outsid which thei lit a
fire on that fire thei cook some of the seal flesh and at it
thankfulli and then went into the hut and slept for thei were veri
weari
next morn thei found that the snow wa still soft and that if thei
tri to walk on it thei sank in to their ankl so that it wa no
longer possibl to drag the boat forward
we cannot go forward and we cannot go back said wi there is but
on thing to doto stai here though where that mai be i do not know
for the mountain on the headland have vanish
now tana broke into weep and moananga look sad but aaka said
ye we stai here till we die inde what other end could be look
for on such a journei unless we have a witch among us who can teach
us to fly like the swan and she glanc at laleela
that i cannot do answer laleela and the journei wa on that
must be tri or so we all thought nor need we die for a long while
see that here we have shelter in the snow hut and enough seal
flesh to last for mani dai if we ar spare and snow that we can
melt to drink also i hope that alwai the ic is bear us forward
and it seem to me that the air grow somewhat warmer
those ar wise word said pag now let us make the hut bigger and
sinc we can do noth more for ourselv trust to the icegod or
to those that laleela and wi worship or to ani other that there mai
be
so thei did these thing also while their fuel last thei cook
the most of the seal flesh after a fashion and set it asid to eat
cold togeth with the fat which thei swallow raw
that dai pag and moananga spoke much with laleela question her as
to her journei northward and how long it had taken about her own land
also and where it layto which she answer as best she could but
wi and laleela talk littl togeth for whenev thei did so aaka
watch them coldli which seem to tie their tongu
four more dai and night pass thu and dure thi weari night
there wa no chang save on name that alwai the air grew
warmer by which thei knew thei were be born southward so that at
last the snow began to melt and the wall of their hut to drip on the
fourth dai also thei saw behind them but somewhat to the west a
mountain of ic that thei had not note befor thi mountain seem
to grow bigger and nearer as though it were head toward them or
thei toward it which told them that all the ic still travel
though thei could not see or feel it move dure that night thei
heard terribl rend sound and felt the ic shake beneath them but
although it wa melt thei did not dare go out of the snow hut to
look whenc the sound came for a strong wind had begun to blow from
the north bring with it cloud that cover the moon
toward dawn the wind fell and present the sun rose shine
brightli in a clear sky thrust asid the block of snow that seal
the entranc hole of the hut pag crept out present he return
and find wi hand without speak drew him from the hut
push back the snow block after him
look he said as thei rose from their knee and point to the
north
wi look and would have fallen had not pag caught him for there
not more than a hundr pace awai wedg into the thick floe
whereon thei float wa that great ic mountain which thei had seen
befor thei slept a tall pinnacl end in a slope of rough ic and
lo there halfwai up the slope held up between block of ic and
stone stood the great sleeper
oh there could be no doubt for the light of the rise sun struck
full upon it there stood the sleeper as wi had seen it for all hi
life through the veil of ic onli now it left foreleg wa broken off
below the knee moreov thi wa not all for among the stone and
ic lai strang silent shape shroud in a powder of snow
here be old friend said pag if it pleas you to go to look upon
them wi ngaeno not ngae for of him on whom the sleeper fell
littl would be left but urk the ag and pitok and hotoa and
whaka though no longer will he croak of evil like a raven and mani
other
it doe not pleas me said wi then he heard a voic behind him
that of aaka who said
you thought you had left the old god behind but see thei have
follow after you husband which i think mean no good to pag and
you who were the first to look upon them whom both of you have
reject
i do not know what it mean wife said wi nor do i ask still
the sight is strang
then the other came moananga wa silent tana lift her hand and
scream but laleela said
the evil god mai follow but we go befor them and never shall thei
come up with us
that remain to be learn said pag
as he spoke the ic peak on which thei were look whereof the base
had been melt by the warmer water into which it had float began
to trembl and to bow toward them thrice it bow thu then with a
slow and nobl motion it turn over bear the sleeper and it
compani with it it vanish into the sea and where it head had been
appear it foot spot all about with great rock that it had
brought with it from the land
farewel to the icegod said laleela with a smile but wi cri
back back the wave come and seiz aaka by the hand he drag
her awai
thei fled all of them and not too soon for after them follow a
mingl flood of ic and water cast up by the overturn of the
berg near to their snow hut it stop and began to reced yet the
platform upon which that hut stood rock and trembl
in hi fear and hast to escap the lad foh ran past the hut out on
to the snow plain whenc present he return cry
the ic ha broken and far awai i see land come father and look
upon the land
thei ran after him wade through the snow for some two hundr
pace till befor them thei beheld a channel of water wide as the
mouth of a great river down which the current ran furious bear
with it great block of ic thi channel wend it wai between two
shore of ic as a river wind between it bank and seem to end
at last in a blue and open sea where there wa no ic far awai at
the edg of that sea appear the land of which foh had spoken green
hill between which a larg river ran into the sea and vallei with
wood on either side of them that grew upward from the plain ly at
the foot of the hill cloth their round side for a few minut
onli thei saw thi green and pleasant land then a mist that seem to
aris from where the ic mountain had overturn drove down wind and
hid it
yonder is the shore of my countri i know that river and those
hill said laleela
then the sooner we come there the better answer pag for thi
ic which ha born us so far is break up beneath us
break up it wa inde have drift into those warmer water of
which onc laleela had spoken as bath the coast of her land
rapidli it melt beneath their feet crack appear in it on
open beneath the snow hut which fell to a shapeless heap
to the boat cri wi
thei ran back thei took hold of the cano and drag it forward
toward the edg of the ic that here and there began to yawn thei
came to the edg the women and foh were thrust in moananga follow
and pag also by the command of wi who held the stern of the boat to
keep it bow straight in the stream while laleela and moananga got
out the paddl wi look at it and saw that it wa veri heavi laden
saw that the water almost ran over the edg of the great hollow log
whereof it wa fashion saw too that if anoth man enter into
it and the wind blew a littl harder or if it were struck by on of
the block of ic that float past on the swift current it would
fill and overset so that all would be drown
come swiftli wi cri aaka and the other also cri come for
thei found it hard to keep the boat steadi
i come i come answer wi and with all hi strength thrust at the
stern so that the boat dart out into the midst of the channel and
there be seiz by the fierc current turn and sped awai
wi went back a few pace and sat himself down upon a floe that wa
bed in the sheet ic watch as he went he heard a splash and
turn saw pag swim toward the ic be veri strong he
reach it and by the help of wi climb on to it edg
why do you come ask wi
that hollow log is veri full answer pag and there ar too mani
women in it their chatter troubl me
now wi look at pag and pag look at wi but neither of them said
anyth thei sat upon the floe watch the cano be born down
the race between the shore of ic it head point first thi wai
and then that as though the paddler were try to turn it round but
could not the mist grew thick about it then just befor it wa
swallow up in that mist thei saw a tall woman shape stand up in
the boat and plung from it into the water
which of them wa it ask wi of pag in a hollow groan voic
that we mai learn present answer pag
then he threw himself down on the ic and shut hi ey like on who
wish to sleep
thu the vision end
chapter xx
the sum of the matter
i allan quatermain woke up to notic that as on the previou
occas when ladi ragnal and i took the taduki togeth my tranc
must have been brief although i had forgotten to look at the time as
it chanc i could measur it durat by anoth method the
taduki herb as i knew soon burn itself awai yet when i awok
the last littl vapour so thin and faint that it could scarc be
discern wa rise from it ember
good graciou i thought to myself how could all those thing have
happen in that unknown land and ag in much less time than it take
the stump of a cigarett to die
then i rememb good for although my head seem rather heavi at
first my brain wa clear enough and look at him not without
alarm or rather anxieti for if anyth had happen to good what
would my posit be
there he wa in hi armchair hi head ly back stare at me with
hi ey halfopen much as a cat doe sometim when it is
pretend to be asleep but is realli veri wide awak inde also he
resembl someth els a man who wa drunk an effect that wa
heighten present by hi try to speak and produc onli
prolong stutter and a word that sound like whiski
no you dont i said it is far too soon to drink alcohol and
taduki might not agre
then good said a word that he should have left unsaid sat up shook
himself and remark
i sai wifor you ar wi arent youhow in the name of the holi
roman empireor of the icegod and the sleeperdid i get out of
that cano and where laleela
befor i answer your question which seem absurd might i ask you
good what you consid your name to be when you were in the cano
of which you speak
name why moananga of cours dash it all wi you havent
forgotten your own brother have you who stuck to you through thick
and thinwel like a brother in a book
then if you were moananga why do you not ask after tana instead of
laleela
i wonder said good reflect i suppos it wa becaus she wa
out of the pictur just then ly at the bottom of the cano
overcom with the horror or seasick or someth you know
with that dear boi foh sit on her also you neednt be jealou
old chap for although i did try to cut in when you were do the
piou over that tomfool oath of your and the rest of it it wasnt
the slightest us she just smile me out of court so to speak and
like you made remark about tana but where laleela you havent
hidden her awai anywher have you and he stare round the room in a
foolish fashion
that just what i want to know i answer inde to tell you
the truth i never rememb want to know anyth quit so much in
all my life
then i cant tell you the last i saw of her she wa in the cano
try to get the head of the crazi thing round with a paddlewhich i
didnt know how to do
look here good i said thi is a seriou matter so pull yourself
togeth and tell me exactli what you rememb just befor you woke
onli thi the cano wa bob about be carri shoreward down
that infern tide race or current between the two bank of ic at i
should sai not less than eight or nine knot moreov it wa
rock becaus that fiddlehead dwarf pag nearli overset it when
he jump out like a seal from a rock and began to swim toward the ic
bank we had left becaus he thought we were all go to be drown
i suppos so there remain onli aaka laleela tana foh and
myself laleela as i have told you wa try to get the craft
round tana wa wail and sob that plucki lad foh wa quit
stilli can see hi white face and big ey now and aaka sit in
the bottom of the cano grip the thwart with both her
outstretch hand but still look veri dignifi wa make
unpleas remark to laleela as to her have murder you wi
aaka husband and her lover or someth of the sort to which
laleela return no answer then just as i wa shove awai a cake of
float ic which cut my hand everyth went out like a candl and
here i am for heaven sake tell me where is laleela
i am afraid old fellow we shall ask ourselv that question for the
rest of our dai yet never learn the answer i repli solemnli
listen i saw a littl more than you did pag reach the ic bank
and i pull him to my side he said that he had jump out of the
cano becaus it wa too full and there were too mani women in it for
hi like but what the dear chap realli meant wa that he prefer
to return to die with me
good old pag ejacul moanangai mean good
after that i went on the cano ran into the spindrift which the
wind lash up and the sea fog
alwai get it with thaw ic interrupt good onc nearli lost
in it myself off the coast of newfoundland
and for a moment pag and i lost sight of it it reappear between
two billow of fog a hundr yard or more awai and thenwel then
we saw a tall woman spring suddenli from the cano into the sea but
as you will rememb both aaka and laleela were tall exactli of a
height inde and neither of us could tell which of them it wa that
the sea took next instant the mist close in again
did you see the woman rise up in the cano aaka wa sit down
you rememb
no we onli saw the spring
that sound like laleela said good for she wa stand and yet
i do not think it can have been for she wa do all she knew to try
to bring the craft round think to creep back to fetch you by the
edg of the ic where the current did not run so fierc the last
thing she said wa to call to me to get out the other paddl and help
inde i had it in my hand but be a landlubb hardli knew how
to us it
i dont think laleela could have done such a thing good suicid wa
against her principl inde she reproach me upon that veri
matter also her own countri wa just ahead of her and she would
wish to reach it if onli to make sure that foh and aakay aaka
met with a good recept yet who know
aaka had a veri bitter tongu remark good also by then
laleela saw that we could never get back against that race and she
wa mad with grief so as you saywho know and he groan while
iwel never mind what i did
for a time there wa silenc between us a veri depress silenc
becaus both of us were overcom it wa broken by good ask humbl
enough if i thought he might have some whiski now
i dont know and i dont care but for my part i mean to risk it i
said and go to the side tabl i help myself freeli as did good
onli more so
teetotal mai sai what thei like but alcohol in moder often
is a friend in troubl so at least we found for as we put that
whiski down our spirit rose consider
look here said good present while he lit hi pipe and i occupi
myself in hide awai that confound taduki outfit which i both
hate and bless i hate it becaus it seem to be possess by an
imp which like a willothewisp led on on and on to the edg of
some great denouement and then in the veri moment of crisi
vanish awai leav on flounder in a bog of doubt and wonder i
bless it becaus these dream it gave were to me at ani rate so
veri suggest and interest
look here repeat good you ar a clever old boi in your wai and
on who think a lot so be kind enough to tell me what all thi
busi mean do you suggest that you and i have been read some
chapter out of a former exist of our own
i suggest noth i answer sharpli the thing is beyond me but
if you want to know i dont much believ in the former exist
solut doe it not occur to you that we must all of us perhap
fifti thousand perhap five hundr thousand year ago have had just
such ancestor as wi and the rest of them and is it not possibl that
thi drug mai have the power of awaken the ancestr memori which
ha come down to us with our spark of life through score of
interven forefath
ye that right enough and yet allan in a wai the thing is too
perfect rememb that we understood and us the languag of those
prehistor beachcomb although we have forgotten everi word of it
nowor at least i have rememb that we saw not onli our own
career but those of other peopl with whose ancestr memori we
have noth to do moreov that some of those peopl remind us
or at ani rate me of folk whom i have known in thi life just as
though the whole lot of us had reappear togeth
that the veri point good men ar queer bundl of mysteri for
the most part thei seem quit commonplac what might be call
matteroffact yet i believ that insid there ar few who ar not
stuf with imagin as our dream show us suppos that we ar
deal with our own ancestr past if that be so we could quit
well invent the rest us the staff that li to our hand name
our knowledg of other with whom we have been intim in life these
would be the foundat upon which the dream were built up the bit
of glass that make the pattern in the kaleidoscop
if so all i have to sai is that your kaleidoscop is an uncommonli
clever machin becaus anyth more natur than those dirti peopl
upon the beach i never knew allan still on thing seem to support
your argument wi the great hunter of the tribe who by birth and
surround wa a most elementari savag show himself much in
advanc of hi ag he made law he thought about the good of other
he resist hi perfectli natur inclin he adopt a higher
religion when it wa brought to hi knowledg he wa patient under
provoc he offer himself up as a sacrific to the god in whom
he no longer believ becaus hi peopl believ in them and he
thought that hi voluntari death would act as a kind of faith cure
among them which is on of the noblest deed i have ever heard of
among men lastli when he saw that a confound hollowedout log
which by courtesi mai be call a cano or a boat wa overcrowd and
like to sink in a kind of icepack mill race he thrust it out
into the stream and himself remain behind to die although it
contain all that he care abouthi wife anoth woman who love
him hi son and perhap i mai add hi brother i sai that the man
who did these thing not to mention other wa a hero and a
christian martyr roll into on with someth of the saint and
solon who i believ wa the first record lawgiv thrown in now
i ask you allan could such a person by ani possibl have exist
in paleolith or prepaleolith time at that period of the world
histori when on of the ic ag wa begin also the same question
mai be ask of laleela
you must rememb i answer that wi wa not such a hero as you
suppos he offer to sacrific himself chiefli in order to save hi
famili or on of them just as most men would do in like
circumst as regard laleela she and everyth about her were
mysterioush origin her nobl patienc and especi her self
control but it is quit obviou that she belong to anoth stratum
of civil i presum that which we call neolith sinc she
told mei mean withat her peopl grew crop kept cow with other
domest anim had some advanc form of religion with a divin
that wa symbol by the moon and so forth well there is noth
strang about all thi sinc now we know that in prehistor dai
race in veri differ stage of advanc exist in the world at
the same time it is quit possibl that wi and hi compani live in
their paleolith simplic let us sai somewher in scotland those
redhead wander who descend upon them suggest scotland while
laleela and her peopl exist perhap in the south of ireland or in
franc where the climat wa much warmer and the ic did not come
probabl wi and co might have live anywher in a cold district and
gone to ani warmer shoreperhap on wash by the gulf stream
answer good at ani rate on thing is obviou if there is
anyth in thi dream of our it tell of a tragedi that must often
have happen in the world i mean the come of an ic ag
ye i said all about the northern shore there must have been
littl collect of miser peopl like to those over whom wi
rule each of them perhap think itself alon in the world and
time on time the ic at interv of ten or hundr of thousand of
year must have descend upon them and crush them out except a few
survivor who fled south doubtless the tragedi of wi wa common
though nobodi think of such thing todai when for aught we know we
mai be live in an interv between two ic ag not long ago i wa
read of the flint pit at brandon in norfolk where it is said
that in the far past live tribe of flintwork then it seem
came an ic ag and after it wa over appear other tribe of flint
worker separ from the first by untold epoch of time but on
might talk of such thing all night
and all tomorrow allan but you have not answer my question how
do you account for a man like wi at that period of the world
histori
i took a littl more whiski and soda to give myself time to think
then i answer easili enough at least to my mind
the world thei tell us now ha probabl been inhabit and
therefor inhabit by man for million of year now wi if he ever
exist by comparison live quit recent for he knew how to make
fire how to trap beast and mani other thing i suggest to you my
dear good that we have not realli advanc veri much sinc the dai
of wi the skull that ar found of peopl of or befor hi period
have the same or sometim an even larger brain capac than our
own all the first and more essenti develop of the human race
took place infinit ag befor the birth of wi some outstand
individu must have conceiv the idea of make and enforc
necessari law and of put a stop to infanticid why should not wi
have been on of these he mai have gone ahead too fasta in fact
he didbut perhap the memori of hi law surviv through hi wife
aaka or hi brother moananga or hi son foh if thei escap and
were repeat and improv upon by futur gener of hi blood in
short good although i think that men have grown clever as a race
i do not believ that the highwat mark of individu among them
ha advanc greatli sinc the time of such as wi which after all
in the histori of the world and inde of the human race ar but
yesterdai for the rest in my own life i have known mani who ar
call savag in africa who knew as littl or less than wi and yet
in similar circumst would have done all that he did and more
that a new idea said good perhap we civil peopl vaunt
ourselv too much
perhap i answer for civil as we know it is veri young
and a great sham i dont know and it isnt worth bother about all
i know is that i wish i had never dream that dream which ha given
me a new set of sorrow that cannot be forgotten
that the point exclaim good now there wa tana she wa a
jealou sort of woman and we quarrel often especi when i
began to make up to laleela and i well i wa a natur man much as
i am todai so as i sai we quarrel yet after all i wa veri
fond of tana she wa my wife for mani year and she bore children
whom both of us love children that di as most children di among
the tribe as for the row between us what do thei matter now that i
have come to know her i can never forget tana
it is the same here i answer that boi foh and hi sister foa
whom you rememb that bruteman henga murderedfor exampl well
thei mai be but dream children but henceforward thei ar mine at
thi veri moment i tell you that i could burst into tear over the
murder of foa and that my heart ach over the loss of foh and yet
i suppos that thei ar onli fantasi drugborn fantasi see what
thi curs taduki ha done for us to the bereav and miseri
of our own live it ha ad anoth seri it ha suggest to us
that we have endur other live other loss and other miseri
and yet it ha not help us to solv their problem shall we ever
see ani of these peopl again we who seem to mix with them still
exist do thei exist also and if so have we ani hope of find
them
ar you quiet certain allan that we havent found some of them
alreadi although it wa but to lose them onc more now although i
never saw him you have often told me of the hottentot call han who
serv you from your youth until he di still try to serv you by
save your life well isnt there some resembl between that
hottentot and pag
undoubtedli there is i answer although pag the wolfman wa a
bit more primev
then as regard laleelahow about that ladi ragnal who left you
the fortun which like a donkei you refus do you see ani
connect between them
not much i answer except that thei were both priestess of or
at ani rate in some wai connect with the moon but of cours i
know veri littl of laleela life she appear from a southern land
but exactli why she left it i cannot tell becaus she never told me
at that time her ag must have been well what do you put it at
good
anywher between twentyeight and thirtytwo i should sai
that about it well in those dai a woman of her beauti and
station must have had lot of privat histori behind her at let us
sai thirti inde she hint as much more than onc but as she
never state what it wa there is veri littl to go on and
identif becom imposs
look here let us stop thi befor we go crack under the influenc
of an african drug we have seen strang thing or think that we have
seen them we have seen an ancient barbar tribe live at the foot
of the glacier upon a desol beach collect their food from year
to year as best thei could with their primit weapon and evolv
a kind of elementari civil thu thei were rule by a chief who
might be kill when ani stronger man appear as in a herd of game
the old bull is kill by the young bull we have seen a man of
strength and abil aris who tri to make new and better law and
to introduc justic and who under the influenc of a foreign and
more advanc woman ultim turn from the worship of fierc
fetish god suppos to dwell in the ic thei dread to a purer if
still elementari faith we have seen the fate fall upon him that
overtak almost all reform also that thi ic wa not fear in
vain sinc it swept down and destroi hi peopl as inde it must
often have done in the histori of the world and perhap will do again
in the futur
ye we have seen all that said good but if it wasnt real what
is the us of it dream have not much practic valu
ar you sure about that good ar you sure that life as we know it
is anyth more than a taduki dream
what do you mean allan
i mean that perhap alreadi we mai be plung into and be a part of
immort and that thi immort mai have it night as well as
it daysdreamhaunt night of which thi present life of our is
on
steadi old fellow you ar run full steam into strang water
and without a chart
quit true i answer let us get back into the channel between
the light buoi to my mind our experi tonight ha been veri
instruct whether it be real or imaginari it ha taught me what
must have happen to our forefath ten or hundr of thousand of
year ago let us suppos that it wa all a dream or delus and
think of it as noth els still it ha been a most fascin
dream a kind of lightn flash show us a page of the past there
let us leav it lock it up as an individu experi not meant
for the benefit of other to advertis what ar call hallucin
is not wise
i quit agre with you allan said good and i mean to keep my
experi upon that beach wherev it mai have been veri much to
myself onli in my leisur time i intend to take up the studi of the
ic ag and the glacial drift
and now about those snipe it is odd by the wai that even in those
dai you seem to have been a sportsman and a hunter will you bring
your speari mean gunand come tomorrow
the end
