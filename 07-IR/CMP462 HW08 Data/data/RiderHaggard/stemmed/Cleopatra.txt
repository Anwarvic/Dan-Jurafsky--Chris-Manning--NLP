author note
the histori of the ruin of antoni and cleopatra must have struck mani
student of the record of their ag as on of the most inexplic
of tragic tale what malign influenc and secret hate were at work
continu sap their prosper and blind their judgment why
did cleopatra fly at actium and why did antoni follow her leav hi
fleet and armi to destruct an attempt is made in thi romanc to
suggest a possibl answer to these and some other question
the reader is ask to bear in mind howev that the stori is told
not from the modern point of view but as from the broken heart and
with the lip of an egyptian patriot of royal blood no mere
beastworshipp but a priest instruct in the inmost mysteri who
believ firmli in the person exist of the god of khem in the
possibl of communion with them and in the certainti of immort
life with it reward and punish to whom also the bewild and
often gross symbol of the osirian faith wa noth but a veil woven
to obscur secret of the sanctuari whatev proport of truth there
mai have been in their spiritu claim and imagin if inde there
wa ani such men as the princ harmachi have been told of in the
annal of everi great religion and as is shown by the testimoni of
monument and sacr inscript thei were not unknown among the
worshipp of the egyptian god and more especi of isi
unfortun it is scarc possibl to write a book of thi natur and
period without introduc a certain amount of illustr matter for
by no other mean can the long dead past be made to live again befor
the reader ey with all it accessori of fade pomp and forgotten
mysteri to such student as seek a stori onli and ar not interest
in the faith ceremoni or custom of the mother of religion and
civilis ancient egypt it is howev respectfulli suggest
that thei should exercis the art of skip and open thi tale at it
second book
that version of the death of cleopatra ha been prefer which
attribut her end to poison accord to plutarch it actual manner is
veri uncertain though popular rumour ascrib it to the bite of an asp
she seem howev to have carri out her design under the advic
of that shadowi personag her physician olympu and it is more than
doubt if he would have resort to such a fantast and uncertain
method of destroi life
it mai be mention that so late as the reign of ptolemi epiphan
pretend of nativ blood on of whom wa name harmachi ar known
to have advanc their claim to the throne of egypt moreov there
wa a book of propheci current among the priesthood which declar that
after the nation of the greek the god harsefi would creat the chief
who is to come it will therefor be seen that although it lack
histor confirm the stori of the great plot form to stamp out
the dynasti of the macedonian lagida and place harmachi on the throne
is not in itself improb inde it is possibl that mani such plot
were enter into by egyptian patriot dure the long ag of their
countri bondag but ancient histori tell us littl of the abort
struggl of a fallen race
the chant of isi and the song of cleopatra which appear in these
page ar done into vers from the writer prose by mr andrew lang
and the dirg sung by charmion is translat by the same hand from the
greek of the syrian meleag

probabl inclos the bodi of the high priest amenemhat and of
hi wife father and mother of harmachi the hero of thi histori the
shameless arab who discov them there and then broke up
the arab broke the bodi up with unhallow hand thei tore the holi

what ensu i will give in hi own word exactli as he wrote it to me

boulder polish by centuri of action of sun and sand here ali
halt sai that the tomb wa under the stone accordingli we
dismount and leav the donkei in charg of a fellah boi went up
to the rock beneath it wa a small hole bare larg enough for a man
to creep through inde it had been dug by jackal for the doorwai and
some part of the cave were entir silt up and it wa by mean of
thi jackal hole that the tomb had been discov ali crept in on hi
hand and knee and i follow to find myself in a place cold after
the hot outsid air and in contrast with the light fill with a
dazzl dark we lit our candl and the select bodi of thiev
have arriv i made an examin we were in a cave the size of
a larg room and hollow by hand the further part of the cave be
almost free from driftdust on the wall ar religi paint of the
usual ptolema charact and among them on of a majest old man with
a long white beard who is seat in a carv chair hold a wand in
hi hand befor him pass a process of priest bear sacr
imag in the right hand corner of the tomb is the shaft of the
mummypit a squaremouth well cut in the black rock we had brought a
beam of thornwood and thi wa now laid across the pit and a rope
made fast to it then aliwho to do him justic is a courag
thieftook hold of the rope and put some candl into the breast
of hi robe place hi bare feet against the smooth side of the well
and began to descent with great rapid veri soon he had vanish into
black and the agit of the cord alon told us that anyth wa
go on below at last the rope ceas shake and a faint shout came
rumbl up the well announc ali safe arriv then far below a
tini star of light appear he had lit the candl therebi disturb
hundr of bat that flit up in an endless stream and as silent as
spirit the rope wa haul up again and now it wa my turn but as
i declin to trust my neck to the handoverhand method of descent the
end of the cord wa made fast round my middl and i wa lower bodili
into those sacr depth nor wa it a pleasant journei for if the
master of the situat abov had made ani mistak i should have been
dash to piec also the bat continu flew into my face and clung
to my hair and i have a great dislik of bat at last after some
minut of jerk and dangl i found myself stand in a
narrow passag by the side of the worthi ali cover with bat and
perspir and with the skin rub off my knee and knuckl then
anoth man came down hand over hand like a sailor and as the rest
were told to stop abov we were readi to go on ali went first with
hi candleof cours we each had a candlelead the wai down a long
passag about five feet high at length the passag widen out and we
were in the tombchamb i think the hottest and most silent place that
i ever enter it wa simpli stifl thi chamber is a squar room
cut in the rock and total devoid of paint or sculptur i held
up the candl and look round about the place were strewn the coffin
lid and the mummi remain of the two bodi that the arab had
previous violat the paint on the former were i notic of
great beauti though have no knowledg of hieroglyph i could not
deciph them bead and spici wrap lai around the remain which
i saw were those of a man and a woman the head had been broken off
the bodi of the man i took it up and look at it it had been close
shavedaft death i should sai from the gener indicationsand the
featur were disfigur with gold leaf but notwithstand thi
and the shrinkag of the flesh i think the face wa on of the most
impos and beauti that i ever saw it wa that of a veri old man
and hi dead counten still wore so calm and solemn inde so aw
a look that i grew quit superstiti though as you know i am pretti
well accustom to dead peopl and put the head down in a hurri there
were still some wrap left upon the face of the second bodi and i
did not remov them but she must have been a fine larg woman in her
dai
thi i take it is a portrait of amenemhat himself
editor
doubtless amenemhat and hi wifeeditor
there the other mummi said ali point to a larg and solid case
that seem to have been carelessli thrown down in a corner for it wa
ly on it side
i went up to it and carefulli examin it it wa well made but of
perfectli plain cedarwoodnot an inscript not a solitari god on
it
never see on like him befor said ali buri great hurri he no
mafish no fineesh throw him down here on side
i look at the plain case till at last my interest wa thoroughli
arous i wa so shock by the sight of the scatter dust of
the depart that i had made up my mind not to touch the remain
coffinbut now my curios overcam me and we set to work
ali had brought a mallet and a cold chisel with him and have
set the coffin straight he began upon it with all the zeal of an
experienc tombbreak and then he point out anoth thing most
mummycas ar fasten by four littl tongu of wood two on either
side which ar fix in the upper half and pass into mortic cut
to receiv them in the thick of the lower half ar there held
fast by peg of hard wood but thi mummi case had eight such tongu
evid it had been thought well to secur it firmli at last with
great difficulti we rais the massiv lid which wa nearli three
inch thick and there cover over with a deep layer of loos spice
a veri unusu thing wa the bodi
ali look at it with open eyesand no wonder for thi mummi wa not
as other mummi ar mummi in gener lie upon their back as stiff
and calm as though thei were cut from wood but thi mummi lai upon it
side and the wrap notwithstand it knee were slightli bent
more than that inde the gold mask which after the fashion of the
ptolema period had been set upon the face had work down and wa
liter pound up beneath the hood head
it wa imposs see these thing to avoid the conclus that
the mummi befor us had move with violenc sinc it wa put in the
coffin
him veri funni mummi him not mafish when him go in there said
ali
nonsens i said who ever heard of a live mummi
we lift the bodi out of the coffin nearli choke ourselv with
mummi dust in the process and there beneath it half hidden among the
spice we made our first find it wa a roll of papyru carelessli
fasten and wrap in a piec of mummi cloth have to all appear
been thrown into the coffin at the moment of close
thi roll contain the third unfinish book of the
histori the other two roll were neatli fasten in the
usual fashion all three ar written by on hand in the
demot charactereditor
ali ei the papyru greedili but i seiz it and put it in my pocket
for it wa agre that i wa to have all that might be discov
then we began to unwrap the bodi it wa cover with veri broad strong
bandag thickli wound and roughli ti sometim by mean of simpl
knot the whole work the appear of have been execut in
great hast and with difficulti just over the head wa a larg lump
present the bandag cover it were off and there on the face
lai a second roll of papyru i put down my hand to lift it but it
would not come awai it appear to be fix to the stout seamless
shroud which wa drawn over the whole bodi and ti beneath the
feeta a farmer ti sack thi shroud which wa also thickli wax
wa in on piec be made to fit the form like a garment i took a
candl and examin the roll and then i saw why it wa fast the spice
had congeal and glu it to the sacklik shroud it wa imposs to
get it awai without tear the outer sheet of papyru
thi account for the gap in the last sheet of the
second roll editor
at last howev i wrench it loos and put it with the other in my
pocket
then we went on with our dread task in silenc with much care we
rip loos the sacklik garment and at last the bodi of a man lai
befor us between hi knee wa a third roll of papyru i secur it
then held down the light and look at him on glanc at hi face wa
enough to tell a doctor how he had di
thi bodi wa not much dri up evid it had not pass the
allot seventi dai in natron and therefor the express and
like were better preserv than is usual without enter into
particular i will onli sai that i hope i shall never see such anoth
look as that which wa frozen on thi dead man face even the arab
recoil from it in horror and began to mutter prayer
for the rest the usual open on the left side through which the
embalm did their work wa absent the finelycut featur were those
of a person of middl ag although the hair wa alreadi grei and
the frame wa that of a veri power man the shoulder be of an
extraordinari width i had not time to examin veri close howev
for within a few second from it uncov the unembalm bodi began
to crumbl now that it wa expos to the action of the air in five or
six minut there wa liter noth left of it but a wisp of hair
the skull and a few of the larger bone i notic that on of the
tibii forget if it wa the right or the lefthad been fractur and
veri badli set it must have been quit an inch shorter than the other

behold it is written hereaft
here in abouthi i wa born i harmachi and my father the justifi
in osiri wa high priest of the templ of sethi and on that same dai
of my birth cleopatra the queen of egypt wa born also i pass my
youth in yonder field watch the baser peopl at their labour and
go in and out at will among the great court of the templ of my
mother i knew naught for she di when i yet hung at the breast but
befor she di in the reign of ptolemi ault who is name the piper
so did the old wife atoua told me my mother took a golden uru the
snake symbol of our royalti of egypt from a coffer of ivori and laid
it on my brow and those who saw her do thi believ that she wa
distraught of the divin and in her mad foreshadow that the dai
of the macedonian lagid wa end and that egypt sceptr should pass
again to the hand of egypt true and royal race but when my father
the old high priest amenemhat whose onli child i wa she who wa hi
wife befor my mother have been for what crime i know not curs
with barren by sekhet i sai when my father came in and saw what the
dy woman had done he lift up hi hand toward the vault of heaven
and ador the invis becaus of the sign that had been sent and
as he ador the hathor fill my dy mother with the spirit of
propheci and she rose in strength from the couch and prostrat herself
thrice befor the cradl where i lai asleep the royal asp upon my brow
cry aloud
the egyptian parc or fateseditor
hail to thee fruit of my womb hail to thee royal child hail to
thee pharaoh that shalt be hail to thee god that shalt purg the
land divin seed of nektnebf the descend from isi keep thee pure
and thou shalt rule and deliv egypt and not be broken but if thou
dost fail in thy hour of trial then mai the curs of all the god
of egypt rest upon thee and the curs of thy royal forefath the
justifi who rule the land befor thee from the ag of horu then in
life mayst thou be wretch and after death mai osiri refus thee
and the judg of amenti give judgment against thee and set and sekhet
torment thee till such time as thy sin is purg and the god of
egypt call by strang name ar onc more worship in the templ
of egypt and the staff of the oppressor is broken and the footstep of
the foreign ar swept clean and the thing is accomplish as thou in
thy weak shalt caus it to be done
when she had spoken thu the spirit of propheci went out of her and
she fell dead across the cradl where i slept so that i awok with a
cry
but my father amenemhat the high priest trembl and wa veri
fear both becaus of the word which had been said by the spirit of
the hathor through the mouth of my mother and becaus what had been
utter wa treason against ptolemi for he knew that if the matter
should come to the ear of ptolemi pharaoh would send hi guard
to destroi the life of the child concern whom such thing were
prophesi therefor my father shut the door and caus all those
who stood by to swear upon the holi symbol of hi offic and by the
name of the divin three and by the soul of her who lai dead upon the
stone besid them that noth of what thei had seen and heard should
pass their lip
now among the compani wa the old wife atoua who had been the nurs of
my mother and love her well and in these dai though i know not how
it had been in the past nor how it shall be in the futur there is
no oath that can bind a woman tongu and so it came about that
byandbi when the matter had becom home in her mind and her fear
had fallen from her she spoke of the propheci to her daughter who
nurs me at the breast now that my mother wa dead she did thi as
thei walk togeth in the desert carri food to the husband of the
daughter who wa a sculptor and shape effigi of the holi god
in the tomb that ar fashion in the rocktel the daughter my
nurs how great must be her care and love toward the child that
should on dai be pharaoh and drive the ptolemi from egypt but the
daughter my nurs wa so fill with wonder at what she heard that she
could not keep the tale lock within her breast and in the night she
awok her husband and in her turn whisper it to him and therebi
compass her own destruct and the destruct of her child my
fosterbroth for the man told hi friend and the friend wa a spy of
ptolemi and thu the tale came to pharaoh ear
now pharaoh wa much troubl thereat for though when he wa full of
wine he would make a mock of the god of the egyptian and swear that
the roman senat wa the onli god to whom he bow the knee yet in hi
heart he wa terribl afraid as i have learn from on who wa hi
physician for when he wa alon at night he would scream and cry aloud
to the great serapi who inde is no true god and to other god
fear lest he should be murder and hi soul hand over to the
tormentor also when he felt hi throne trembl under him he would
send larg present to the templ ask a messag from the oracl
and more especi from the oracl that is at phil therefor when
it came to hi ear that the wife of the high priest of the great and
ancient templ of abouthi had been fill with the spirit of propheci
befor she di and foretold that her son should be pharaoh he wa
much afraid and summon some trusti guardswho be greek did
not fear to do sacrilegeh despatch them by boat up the nile with
order to come to abouthi and cut off the head of the child of the high
priest and bring it to him in a basket
but as it chanc the boat in which the guard came wa of deep
draught and the time of their come be at the lowest ebb of the
river it struck and remain fast upon a bank of mud that is opposit
the mouth of the road run across the plain to abouthi and as the
north wind wa blow veri fierc it wa like to sink thereon
the guard of pharaoh call out to the common peopl who labour at
lift water along the bank of the river to come with boat and take
them off but see that thei were greek of alexandria the peopl
would not for the egyptian do not love the greek then the guard
cri that thei were on pharaoh busi and still the peopl would
not ask what wa their busi whereon a eunuch among them who
had made himself drunk in hi fear told them that thei came to slai the
child of amenemhat the high priest of whom it wa prophesi that he
should be pharaoh and sweep the greek from egypt and then the peopl
fear to stand longer in doubt but brought boat not know what
might be meant by the man word but there wa on amongst thema
farmer and an overs of canalswho wa a kinsman of my mother and
had been present when she prophesi and he turn and ran swiftli for
three part of an hour till he came to where i lai in the hous that
is without the north wall of the great templ now as it chanc my
father wa awai in that part of the place of tomb which is to the left
of the larg fortress and pharaoh guard mount on ass were hard
upon us then the messeng cri to the old wife atoua whose tongu
had brought about the evil and told how the soldier drew near to slai
me and thei look at each other not know what to do for had thei
hid me the guard would not have stai their search till i wa found
but the man gaze through the doorwai saw a littl child at plai
woman he said whose is that child
it is my grandchild she answer the fosterbroth of the princ
harmachi the child to whose mother we ow thi evil case
woman he said thou knowest thy duti do it and he again point
at the child i command thee by the holi name
atoua trembl exceedingli becaus the child wa of her own blood but
nevertheless she took the boi and wash him and set a robe of silk
upon him and laid him on my cradl and me she took and smear with
mud to make my fair skin darker and draw my garment from me set me
to plai in the dirt of the yard which i did right gladli
then the man hid himself and present the soldier rode up and ask
of the old wife if thi were the dwell of the high priest amenemhat
and she told them yea and bid them enter offer them honei and
milk for thei were thirsti
when thei had drunk the eunuch who wa with them ask if that were
the son of amenemhat who lai in the cradl and she said yeayea
and began to tell the guard how he would be great for it had been
prophesi of him that he should on dai rule them all
but the greek guard laugh and on of them seiz the child smote
off hi head with a sword and the eunuch drew forth the signet of
pharaoh as warrant for the deed and show it to the old wife atoua
bid her tell the high priest that hi son should be king without a
head
and as thei went on of their number saw me plai in the dirt and
call out that there wa more breed in yonder brat than in the
princ harmachi and for a moment thei waver think to slai
me also but in the end thei pass on bear the head of my
fosterbroth for thei love not to murder littl children
after a while the mother of the dead child return from the
marketplac and when she found what had been done she and her husband
would have kill atoua the old wife her mother and given me up to the
soldier of pharaoh but my father came in also and learn the truth
and he caus the man and hi wife to be seiz by night and hidden awai
in the dark place of the templ so that none saw them more
but i would todai that it had been the will of the god that i had been
slain of the soldier and not the innoc child
thereaft it wa given out that the high priest amenemhat had taken me
to be as a son to him in the place of that harmachi who wa slain of
pharaoh
chapter ii
of the disobedi of harmachi of the slai of the lion and of the
speech of the old wife atoua
and after these thing ptolemi the piper troubl us no more nor did he
again send hi soldier to seek for him of whom it wa prophesi that
he should be pharaoh for the head of the child my fosterbroth
wa brought to him by the eunuch as he sat in hi palac of marbl at
alexandria flush with cyprian wine and plai upon the flute befor
hi women and at hi bid the eunuch lift up the head by the hair
for him to look on then he laugh and smote it on the cheek with hi

after thi the year pass on nor did i be veri littl know
anyth of the great thing that came to pass in egypt nor is it my
purpos to set them out here for i harmachi have littl time left
to me will onli speak of those thing with which i have been concern
and as the time went on my father and the teacher instruct me in the
ancient learn of our peopl and in such matter appertain to
the god as it is meet that children should know so i grew strong and
come for my hair wa black as the hair of the divin nout and my
ey were blue as the blue lotu and my skin wa like the alabast
within the sanctuari for now that these glori have pass from me
i mai speak of them without shame i wa strong also there wa no youth
of my year in abouthi who could stand against me to wrestl with me
nor could ani throw so far with the sling or spear and i much yearn
to hunt the lion but he whom i call my father forbad me tell me
that my life wa of too great worth to be so lightli hazard but when
i bow befor him and prai he would make hi mean clear to me
the old man frown and answer that the god made all thing clear in
their own season for my part howev i went awai in wroth for there
wa a youth in abouthi who with other had slain a lion which fell upon
hi father herd and be enviou of my strength and beauti he set
it about that i wa cowardli at heart in that when i went out to hunt
i onli slew jackal and gazel now thi wa when i had reach my
seventeenth year and wa a man grown
it chanc therefor that as i went sore at heart from the presenc
of the high priest i met thi youth who call to me and mock me
bid me know the countri peopl had told him that a great lion wa
down among the rush by the bank of the canal which run past the
templ ly at a distanc of thirti stadia from abouthi and still
mock me he ask me if i would come and help him slai thi lion or
would i go and sit among the old women and bid them comb my side lock
thi bitter word so anger me that i wa near to fall on him but
in place therefor forget my father sai i answer that if he
would come alon i would go with him and seek thi lion and he should
learn if i were inde a coward and at first he would not for as men
know it is our custom to hunt the lion in compani so it wa my hour
to mock then he went and fetch hi bow and arrow and a sharp knife
and i brought forth my heavi spear which had a shaft of thornwood and
at it end a pomegran in silver to hold the hand from slip and
in silenc we went side by side to where the lion lai when we
came to the place it wa near sundown and there upon the mud of the
canalbank we found the lion slot which ran into a thick clump of
reed
now thou boaster i said wilt thou lead the wai into yonder reed
or shall i and i made as though i would lead the wai
nai nai he answer be not so mad the brute will spring upon
thee and rend thee see i will shoot among the reed perchanc if he
sleep it will arous him and he drew hi bow at a ventur
how it chanc i know not but the arrow struck the sleep lion and
like a flash of light from the belli of a cloud he bound from the
shelter of the reed and stood befor us with bristl mane and yellow
ey the arrow quiver in hi flank he roar aloud in furi and the
earth shook
shoot with the bow i cri shoot swiftli er he spring
but courag had left the breast of the boaster hi jaw drop down and
hi finger unloos their hold so that the bow fell from them then
with a loud cry he turn and fled behind me leav the lion in my
path but while i stood wait my doom for though i wa sore afraid
i would not fly the lion crouch himself and turn not asid with
on great bound swept over me touch me not he lit and again he
bound full upon the boaster back strike him such a blow with hi
great paw that hi head wa crush as an egg thrown against a stone he
fell down dead and the lion stood and roar over him then i wa mad
with horror and scarc know what i did i grasp my spear and with
a shout i charg as i charg the lion lift himself up abov me
he smote at me with hi paw but with all my strength i drove the broad
spear into hi throat and shrink from the agoni of the steel hi
blow fell short and did no more than rip my skin back he fell the
great spear far in hi throat then rise he roar in pain and leapt
twice the height of a man straight into the air smite at the spear
with hi forepaw twice he leapt thu horribl to see and twice he
fell upon hi back then hi strength spent itself with hi rush
blood and groan like a bull he di while i be but a lad
stood and trembl with fear now that all caus of fear had pass
but as i stood and gaze at the bodi of him who had taunt me and at
the carcass of the lion a woman came run toward me even the same
old wife atoua who though i knew it not as yet had offer up her
flesh and blood that i might be save aliv for she had been gather
simpl in which she had great skill by the water edg not know
that there wa a lion near and inde the lion for the most part
ar not found in the till land but rather in the desert and the
libyan mountain and had seen from a distanc that which i have set
down now when she wa come she knew me for harmachi and bend
herself she made obeis to me and salut me call me royal and
worthi of all honour and belov and chosen of the holi three ay and
by the name of the pharaoh the deliver
but i think that terror had made her sick of mind ask her of what
she would speak
is it a great thing i ask that i should slai a lion is it a
matter worthi of such talk as thine there live and have live men who
have slain mani lion did not the divin amenhetep the osirian slai
with hi own hand more than a hundr lion is it not written on the
scarabu that hang within my father chamber that he slew lion
aforetim and have not other done likewis why then speakest thou
thu o foolish woman
all of which i said becaus have now slain the lion i wa mind
after the manner of youth to hold it as a thing of no account but she
did not ceas to make obeis and to call me by name that ar too
high to be written
o royal on she cri wise did thy mother propheci sure the

chapter iii
of the rebuk of amenemhat of the prayer of harmachi and of the sign
given by the holi god
for a while as i harmachi went the juic of the green herb which
the old wife atoua had place upon my wound caus me much smart
but present the pain ceas and of a truth i believ that there wa
virtu in them for within two dai my flesh heal up so that after a
time no mark remain but i bethought me that i had disobei the word
of the old high priest amenemhat who wa call my father for till
thi dai i knew not that he wa in truth my father accord to the
flesh have been taught that hi own son wa slain as i have written
and that he had been pleas with the sanction of the divin on to
take me as an adopt son and rear me up that i might in due season
fulfil an offic about the templ therefor i wa much troubl for i
fear the old man who wa veri terribl in hi anger and ever spoke
with the cold voic of wisdom nevertheless i determin to go in
to him and confess my fault and bear such punish as he should be
pleas to put upon me so with the red spear in my hand and the red
wound on my breast i pass through the outer court of the great
templ and came to the door of the place where the high priest dwelt it
is a great chamber sculptur round about with the imag of the solemn
god and the sunlight come to it in the daytim by an open cut
through the stone of the massi roof but at night it wa lit by a
swing lamp of bronz i pass in without nois for the door wa
not altogeth shut and push my wai through the heavi curtain that
were beyond i stood with a beat heart within the chamber
the lamp wa lit for the dark had fallen and by it light i saw
the old man seat in a chair of ivori and eboni at a tabl of stone on
which were spread mystic write of the word of life and death but
he read no more for he slept and hi long white beard rest upon the
tabl like the beard of a dead man the soft light from the lamp fell
on him on the papyri and the gold ring upon hi hand where were graven
the symbol of the invis on but all around wa shadow it fell on
the shaven head on the white robe on the cedar staff of priesthood
at hi side and on the ivori of the lionfoot chair it show
the mighti brow of power the featur cut in kingli mould the white
eyebrow and the dark hollow of the deepset ey i look and
trembl for there wa about him that which wa more than the digniti
of man he had live so long with the god and so long kept compani
with them and with thought divin he wa so deepli vers in all those
mysteri which we do but faintli discern here in thi upper air that
even now befor hi time he partook of the natur of the osiri and
wa a thing to shake human with fear
i stood and gaze and as i stood he open hi dark ey but look
not on me nor turn hi head and yet he saw me and spoke
why hast thou been disobedi to me my son he said how came it
that thou wentest forth against the lion when i bade thee not
how knowest thou my father that i went forth i ask in fear
how know i ar there then no other wai of knowledg than by the
sens ah ignor child wa not my spirit with thee when the lion
sprang upon thy companion did i not prai those set about thee to
protect thee to make sure thy thrust when thou didst drive the spear
into the lion throat how came it that thou wentest forth my son
the boaster taunt me i answer and i went

then i went forth with a full heart the night wa veri still and none
were stir in the templ court i hurri through them and reach
the entranc to the pylon that is at the outer gate then seek
solitud and as it were to draw near to heaven i climb the pylon
two hundr step until at length i reach the massiv roof here i
lean my breast against the parapet and look forth as i look
the red edg of the full moon float up over the arabian hill and
her rai fell upon the pylon where i stood and the templ wall beyond
light the visag of the carven god then the cold light struck the
stretch of welltil land now whiten to the harvest and as the
heavenli lamp of isi pass up to the sky her rai crept slowli down
to the vallei where sihor father of the land of khem roll on toward
the sea
now the bright beam kiss the water that smile an answer back and
now mountain and vallei river templ town and plain were flood
with white light for mother isi wa arisen and threw her gleam
robe across the bosom of the earth it wa beauti with the beauti
of a dream and solemn as the hour after death mightili inde the
templ tower up against the face of night never had thei seem so
grand to me as in that hourthos etern shrine befor whose wall
time himself shall wither and it wa to be mine to rule thi moonlit
land mine to preserv those sacr shrine and cherish the honour of
their god mine to cast out the ptolemi and free egypt from the foreign
yoke in my vein ran the blood of those great king who await the
dai of resurrect sleep in the tomb of the vallei of thebe
my spirit swell within me as i dream upon thi gloriou destini
i close my hand and there upon the pylon i prai as i had never
prai befor to the godhead who is call by mani name and in mani
form made manifest
o amen i prai god of god who hast been from the begin lord
of truth who art and of whom all ar who givest out thy godhead and
gatherest it up again in the circl of whom the divin on move
and ar who wast from all time the selfbegot and who shalt be till
timehearken unto me
for a somewhat similar definit of the godhead see the
funer papyru of nesikhonsu a princess of the twenti

to carri out the purpos of the god let a sign be given me even now
to seal my life to the life abov stretch out your arm toward me o
ye god and uncov the glori of your counten hear ah hear me
and i cast myself upon my knee and lift up my ey to heaven
and as i knelt a cloud grew upon the face of the moon cover it up
so that the night becam dark and the silenc deepen all aroundeven
the dog far below in the citi ceas to howl while the silenc grew
and grew till it wa heavi as death i felt my spirit lift up within
me and my hair rose upon my head then of a sudden the mighti pylon
seem to rock beneath my feet a great wind beat about my brow and a
voic spoke within my heart
behold a sign possess thyself in patienc o harmachi
and as the voic spoke a cold hand touch my hand and left somewhat
within it then the cloud roll from the face of the moon the wind
pass the pylon ceas to trembl and the night wa as the night had
been
as the light came back i gaze upon that which had been left within my
hand it wa a bud of the holi lotu new break into bloom and from
it came a most sweet scent
and while i gaze behold the lotu pass from my grasp and wa gone
leav me astonish

so i made readi and the same even have receiv letter and
embrac my father and those about the templ who were dear to me i

as the pilot stood upon the prow and with a rod in hi hand bade the
sailormen loosen the stake by which the vessel wa moor to the
bank the old wife atoua hobbl up her basket of simpl in her
hand and call out farewel threw a sandal after me for good
chanc which sandal i kept for mani year
so we sail and for six dai pass down the wonder river make
fast each night at some conveni spot but when i lost sight of the
familiar thing that i had seen dai by dai sinc i had ey to see and
found myself alon among strang face i felt veri sore at heart and
would have wept had i not been asham and of all the wonder thing
i saw i will not write here for though thei were new to me have thei
not been known to men sinc such time as the god rule in egypt but
the priest who were with me show me no littl honour and expound to
me what were the thing i saw

and shown the beauti of the great and marvel citi also i wa led
in secret by the high priest and two other into the holi presenc of
the god api the ptah who deign to dwell among men in the form of a
bull the god wa black and on hi forehead there wa a white squar
on hi back wa a white mark shape like an eagl beneath hi tongu
wa the like of a scarabu in hi tail were doubl hair and a
plate of pure gold hung between hi horn i enter the place of the
god and worship while the high priest and those with him stood
asid watch earnestli and when i had worship sai the word
which had been told me the god knelt and lai down befor me then
the high priest and those with him who as i heard in after time were
great men of upper egypt approach wonder and sai no word
made obeis to me becaus of the omen and mani other thing i saw in
memphi that ar too long to write of here
on the fourth dai some priest of annu came to lead me to sepa my
uncl the high priest of annu so have bidden farewel to those of
memphi we cross the river and rode on ass two part of a dai
journei through mani villag which we found in great poverti becaus
of the oppress of the taxgather also as we went i saw for
the first time the great pyramid that ar beyond the imag of the god
horemkhu that sphinx whom the greek name harmachi and the templ of
the divin mother isi queen of the memnonia and the god osiri lord
of rosat of which templ togeth with the templ of the worship
of the divin menkaura i harmachi am by right divin the hereditari
high priest i saw them and marvel at their great and the white
carven limeston and red granit of syen that flash the sun rai
back to heaven but at thi time i knew noth of the treasur that wa
hid in her which is the third among the pyramidswould i had never
known of it
and so at last we came within sight of annu which after memphi ha
been seen is no larg town but stand on rais ground befor which
ar lake fed by a canal behind the town is the inclos field of the
templ of the god ra
we dismount at the pylon and were met beneath the portico by a man
not great of statur but of nobl aspect have hi head shaven and
with dark ey that twinkl like the further star
hold he cri in a great voic which fit hi weak bodi but ill
hold i am sepa who open the mouth of the god
and i i said am harmachi son of amenemhat hereditari high priest
and ruler of the holi citi abouthi and i bear letter to thee o
sepa
enter he said enter scan me all the while with hi twinkl
ey enter my son and he took me and led me to a chamber in the
inner hall close to the door and then have glanc at the letter
that i brought of a sudden he fell upon my neck and embrac me
welcom he cri welcom son of my own sister and hope of khem
not in vain have i prai the god that i might live to look upon thy
face and impart to thee the wisdom which perchanc i alon have master
of those who ar left aliv in egypt there ar few whom it is law
that i should teach but thine is the great destini and thine shall be
the ear to hear the lesson of the god
and he embrac me onc more and bade me go bath and eat sai that
on the morrow he would speak with me further
thi of a truth he did and at such length that i will forbear to set
down all he said both then and afterward for if i did so there would
be no papyru left in egypt when the task wa end therefor have
much to tell and but littl time to tell it i will pass over the event
of the year that follow
for thi wa the manner of my life i rose earli i attend the worship
of the templ and i gave my dai to studi i learnt of the rite of
religion and their mean and of the begin of the god and the
begin of the upper world i learnt of the mysteri of the movement
of the star and of how the earth roll on among them i wa instruct
in that ancient knowledg which is call magic and in the wai of
interpret of dream and of the draw nigh to god i wa taught
the languag of symbol and their outer and inner secret i becam
acquaint with the etern law of good and evil and with the mysteri
of that trust which is held of man also i learnt the secret of the
pyramidswhich i would that i had never known further i read the
record of the past and of the act and word of the ancient king who
were befor me sinc the rule of horu upon earth and i wa made to
know all craft of state the lore of earth and with it the histori of
greec and rome also i learnt the grecian and roman tongu of which
inde i alreadi had some knowledgeand all thi while for five long
year i kept my hand clean and my heart pure and did no evil in the
sight of god or man but labour heavili to acquir all thing and to
prepar myself for the destini that await me
twice everi year greet and letter came from my father amenemhat
and twice everi year i sent back my answer ask if the time had come
to ceas from labour and so the dai of my probat sped awai till i
grew faint and weari at heart for be now a man ay and learn i
long to make a begin of the life of men and often i wonder if
thi talk and propheci of the thing that were to be wa but a dream
born of the brain of men whose wish ran befor their thought i wa
inde of the royal blood that i knew for my uncl sepa the priest
show me a secret record of the descent trace without break from
father to son and graven in mystic symbol on a tablet of the stone
of syen but of what avail wa it to be royal by right when egypt my
heritag wa a slavea slave to do the pleasur and minist to the
luxuri of the macedonian lagidai and when she had been so long a
serf that perchanc she had forgotten how to put off the servil smile
of bondag and onc more to look across the world with freedom happi
ey
then i bethought me of my prayer upon the pylon tower of abouthi and of
the answer given to my prayer and wonder if that too were a dream
and on night as weari with studi i walk within the sacr grove
that is in the garden of the templ and muse thu i met my uncl
sepa who also wa walk and think
hold he cri in hi great voic why is thy face so sad harmachi
ha the last problem that we studi overwhelm thee
nai my uncl i answer i am overwhelm inde but not of the
problem it wa a light on my heart is heavi for i am weari of life
within these cloister and the piledup weight of knowledg crush me
it is of no avail to store up forc which cannot be us
ah thou art impati harmachi he answer it is ever the wai
of foolish youth thou wouldst tast of the battl thou dost tire of
watch the breaker fall upon the beach thou wouldst plung into
them and ventur the desper hazard of the war and so thou wouldst be
go harmachi the bird would fly the nest as when thei ar grown
the swallow fly from the eav of the templ well it shall be as
thou desirest the hour is at hand i have taught thee all that i have
learn and methink that the pupil ha outrun hi master and he
paus and wipe hi bright black ey for he wa veri sad at the
thought of my departur
and whither shall i go my uncl i ask rejoic back to abouthi
to be initi into the mysteri of the god
ay back to abouthi and from abouthi to alexandria and from
alexandria to the throne of thy father harmachi listen now thing
ar thu thou knowest how cleopatra the queen fled into syria when
that fals eunuch pothinu set the will of her father ault at naught
and rais her brother ptolemi to the sole lordship of egypt thou
knowest also how she came back like a queen inde with a great armi
in her train and lai at pelusium and how at thi junctur the mighti
csar that great man that greatest of all men sail with a weak
compani hither to alexandria from pharsalia bloodi field in hot
pursuit of pompei but he found pompei alreadi dead have been base
murder by achilla the gener and luciu septimiu the chief of
the roman legion in egypt and thou knowest how the alexandrian were
troubl at hi come and would have slain hi lictor then as
thou hast heard csar seiz ptolemi the young king and hi sister
arsino and bade the armi of cleopatra and the armi of ptolemi under
achilla which lai face each other at pelusium disband and go
their wai and for answer achilla march on csar and besieg him
straitli in the bruchium at alexandria and so for a while thing
were and none knew who should reign in egypt but then cleopatra took
up the dice and threw them and thi wa the throw she madein truth
it wa a bold on for leav the armi at pelusium she came at dusk
to the harbour of alexandria and alon with the sicilian apollodoru
enter and land then apollodoru bound her in a bale of rich rug
such as ar made in syria and sent the rug as a present to csar and
when the rug were unbound in the palac behold within them wa the
fairest girl on all the earthai and the most witti and the most
learn and she seduc the great csareven hi weight of year did
not avail to protect him from her charmsso that as a fruit of hi
folli he wellnigh lost hi life and all the glori he had gain in a
hundr war
the fool i broke inth fool thou callest him great but how can
the man be truli great who ha no strength to stand against a woman
wile csar with the world hang on hi word csar at whose breath
forti legion march and chang the fate of peopl csar the cold
the farse the herocsar to fall like a ripe fruit into a fals
girl lap why in the issu of what common clai wa thi roman csar
and how poor a thing
but sepa look at me and shook hi head be not so rash harmachi
and talk not with so proud a voic knowest thou not that in everi suit
of mail there is a joint and woe to him who wear the har if the
sword should search it out for woman in her weak is yet the
strongest forc upon the earth she is the helm of all thing human she
come in mani shape and knock at mani door she is quick and patient
and her passion is not ungovern like that of man but as a gentl
steed that she can guid een where she will and as occas offer can
now bit up and now give rein she ha a captain ey and stout must be
that fortress of the heart in which she find no place of vantag doe
thy blood beat fast in youth she will outrun it nor will her kiss
tire art thou set toward ambit she will unlock thy inner heart
and show thee road that lead to glori art thou worn and weari she ha
comfort in her breast art thou fallen she can lift thee up and to the
illus of thy sens gild defeat with triumph ay harmachi she can
do these thing for natur ever fight upon her side and while she
doe them she can deceiv and shape a secret end in which thou hast
no part and thu woman rule the world for her ar war for her men
spend their strength in gather gain for her thei do well and ill
and seek for great to find oblivion but still she sit like yonder
sphinx and smile and no man ha ever read all the riddl of her
smile or known all the mysteri of her heart mock not mock not
harmachi for he must be great inde who can defi the power of woman
which press round him like the invis air is often strongest
when the sens least discov it
i laugh aloud thou speakest earnestli my uncl sepa i said
on might almost think that thou hadst not come unscath through thi
fierc fire of temptat well for myself i fear not woman and her
wile i know naught of them and naught do i wish to know and i still
hold that thi csar wa a fool had i stood where csar stood to cool
it wanton that bale of rug should have been roll down the palac
step into the harbour mud
nai ceas ceas he cri aloud it is evil to speak thu mai the
god avert the omen and preserv to thee thi cold strength of which
thou boastest oh man thou knowest notthou in thy strength and
beauti that is without compar in the power of thy learn and the

csarion csar appoint the younger ptolemi to rule with cleopatra
and be her husband in name and he himself depart for rome bear

and we went forth
chapter vi
of the initi of harmachi of hi vision of hi pass to the
citi that is in the place of death and of the declar of isi the
messeng
in silenc we pass into the shrine of isi it wa dark and bareonli
the feebl light from the lamp gleam faintli upon the sculptur
wall where in a hundr effigi the holi mother suckl the holi
child
the priest close the door and bolt them onc again he said art
thou readi harmachi
onc again i answer i am readi
he spoke no more but have lift up hi hand in prayer led me to
the centr of the holi and with a swift motion put out the lamp
look befor thee harmachi he cri and hi voic sound hollow in
the solemn place
i gaze and saw noth but from the nich that is high in the wall
where is hid that sacr symbol of the goddess on which few mai look
there came a sound as of the rattl rod of the sistrum and as i
listen awestruck behold i saw the outlin of the symbol drawn as
with fire upon the black of the air it hung abov my head and
rattl while it hung and as it turn i clearli saw the face of
the mother isi that is graven on the on side and signifi unend
birth and the face of her holi sister nephthi that is graven on the
other and signifi the end of all birth in death
a music instrument peculiarli sacr to isi of which
the shape and rod had a mystic significanceeditor
slowli it turn and swung as though some mystic dancer trod the air
abov me and shook it in her hand but at length the light went out
and the rattl ceas
then of a sudden the end of the chamber becam lumin and in that
white light i beheld pictur after pictur i saw the ancient nile
roll through desert to the sea there were no men upon it bank
nor ani sign of man nor ani templ to the god onli wild bird move
on sihor lone face and monstrou brute plung and wallow in hi
water the sun sank in majesti behind the libyan desert and stain
the water red the mountain tower up toward the silent sky but in
mountain desert and river there wa no sign of human life then i knew
that i saw the world as it had been befor man wa and a terror of it
loneli enter my soul
the pictur pass and anoth rose up in it place onc again i saw
the bank of sihor and on them crowd wildfac creatur partak
of the natur of the ap more than of the natur of mankind thei fought
and slew each other the wild bird sprang up in affright as the fire
leapt from reed hut given by foemen hand to flame and pillag thei
stole and rent and murder dash out the brain of children with
ax of stone and though no voic told me i knew that i saw man as
he wa ten of thousand of year ago when first he march across the
earth
yet anoth pictur again i beheld the bank of sihor but on them fair
citi bloom like flower in and out their gate went men and women
pass to and fro from wide welltil land but i saw no guard or
armi and no weapon of war all wa wisdom prosper and peac
and while i wonder a gloriou figur clad in raiment that shone
as flame came from the gate of a shrine and the sound of music went
befor and follow after him he mount an ivori throne which wa set
in a marketplac face the water and as the sun sank call in
all the multitud to prayer with on voic thei prai bend in
ador and i understood that herein wa shown the reign of the god
on earth which wa long befor the dai of mene
a chang came over the dream still the same fair citi but other
menmen with greed and evil on their faceswho hate the bond of
righteou do and set their heart on sin the even came the
gloriou figur mount the throne and call to prayer but none bow
themselv in ador
we ar aweari of thee thei cri make evil king slai him slai
him and loos the bond of evil make evil king
the gloriou shape rose up gaze with mild ey upon those wick men
ye know not what ye ask he cri but as ye will so be it for if
i die by me after much travail shall ye onc again find a path to the
kingdom of good
even as he spoke a form foul and hideou to behold leapt upon him
curs slew him tore him limb from limb and amidst the clamour of
the peopl sat himself upon the throne and rule but a shape whose
face wa veil pass down from heaven on shadowi wing and with
lament gather up the rent fragment of the be a moment she
bent herself upon them then lift up her hand and wept and as she
wept behold from her side there sprang a warrior arm and with a
face like the face of ra at noon he the aveng hurl himself with
a shout upon the monster who had usurp the throne and thei close in
battl and struggl ever in a strait embrac pass upward to the
ski
then came pictur after pictur i saw power and peopl clad in
variou robe and speak mani tongu i saw them pass and pass in
millionslov hate struggl dy some few were happi and
some had woe stamp upon their face but most bore not the seal of
happi nor of woe but rather that of patienc and ever as thei
pass from ag to ag high abov in the heaven the aveng fought
on with the evil thing while the scale of victori swung now here now
there but neither conquer nor wa it given to me to know how the
battl end
and i understood that what i had beheld wa the holi vision of the
struggl between the good and the evil power i saw that man wa
creat vile but those who ar abov took piti on him and came down
to him to make him good and happi for the two thing ar on thing but
man return to hi wick wai and then the bright spirit of good who
is of us call osiri but who ha mani name offer himself up for
the evildo of the race that had dethron him and from him and the
divin mother of whom all natur is sprang anoth spirit who is the
protector of us on earth as osiri is our justifi in amenti
for thi is the mysteri of the osiri
of a sudden as i saw the vision these thing becam clear to me the
mummi cloth of symbol and of ceremoni that wrap osiri round fell from
him and i understood the secret of religion which is sacrific
the pictur pass and again the priest my guid spoke to me
hast thou understood harmachi those thing which it ha been grant
thee to see
i have i said ar the rite end
nai thei ar but begun that which follow thou must endur alon
behold i leav thee to return at the morn light onc more i warn
thee that which thou shalt see few mai look upon and live in all my
dai i have known but three who dare to face thi dread hour and of
those three at dawn but on wa found aliv myself i have not trod
thi path it is too high for me
depart i said my soul is athirst for knowledg i will dare it
he laid hi hand upon my shoulder and bless me he went i heard the
door shut to behind him the echo of hi footstep slowli di awai
then i felt that i wa alon alon in the holi place with thing
which ar not of the earth silenc fellsil deep and black as the
dark which wa around me the silenc fell it gather as the cloud
gather on the face of the moon that night when a lad i prai upon
the pylon tower it gather denser and yet more dens till it seem
to creep into my heart and call aloud therein for utter silenc ha
a voic that is more terribl than ani cry i spoke the echo of my
word came back upon me from the wall and seem to beat me down the
still wa lighter to endur than an echo such as thi what wa i
about to see should i die even now in the ful of my youth and
strength terribl were the warn that had been given to me i wa
fearstricken and bethought me that i would fly flyfli whither the
templ door wa bar i could not fly i wa alon with the godhead
alon with the power that i had invok nai my heart wa puremi
heart wa pure i would face the terror that wa to come ay even
though i di
isi holi mother i prai isi spous of heaven come unto me be
with me now i faint be with me now
and then i knew that thing were not as thing had been the air around
me began to stir it rustl as the wing of eagl rustl it took
life bright ey gaze upon me strang whisper shook my soul upon
the dark were bar of light thei chang and interchang thei
move to and fro and wove mystic symbol which i could not read
swifter and swifter flew that shuttl of the light the symbol group
gather fade gather yet again faster and still more fast till my
ey could count them no more now i wa afloat upon a sea of glori it
surg and roll as the ocean roll it toss me high it brought me
low glori wa pile on glori splendour heap on splendour head and

flame and whirl awai awai faster than the lightn flash down i
fell through depth of empti space set here and there with glitter
crown of star down for ten million mile and ten time ten million

white pharo that wonder of the world from the crown of which a light
like the light of the sun blaze out across the water of the harbour
to guid marin on their wai across the sea the vessel have been
cautious made fast to the quai for it wa night i disembark and
stood wonder at the vast mass of hous and confus by the clamour
of mani tongu for here all peopl seem to be gather togeth

young man came and touch me on the shoulder ask me if i wa from
abouthi and name harmachi i said yea then bend over me
he whisper the secret password into my ear and beckon to
two slave bade them bring my baggag from the ship thi thei did

drinkingplac where all sort of men were gather tippl wine and
watch the danc of women some of whom were but scantili arrai

pave with granit and border by strong hous have cloister in
front of them the like of which i had never seen turn onc more to
the right we came to a quieter portion of the citi where except for
parti of stroll revel the street were still present
my guid halt at a hous built of white stone we pass in and
cross a small courtyard enter a chamber where there wa a light
and here at last i found my uncl sepa most glad to see me safe
when i had wash and eaten he told me that all thing went well and
that as yet there wa no thought of evil at the court further he said
it have come to the ear of the queen that the priest of annu wa
sojourn at alexandria she sent for him and close question
himnot as to ani plot for of that she never thought but as to the
rumour which had reach her that there wa treasur hid in the great
pyramid which is by annu for be ever wast she wa ever in want
of monei and had bethought her of open the pyramid but he laugh
at her tell her the pyramid wa the buryingplac of the divin
khufu and that he knew noth of it secret then she wa anger
and swore that so sure as she rule in egypt she would tear it down
stone by stone and discov the secret at it heart again he laugh
and in the word of the proverb which thei have at alexandria told her
that mountain live longer than king thereon she smile at hi readi
answer and let him go also my uncl sepa told me that on the morrow i
should see thi cleopatra for it wa her birthdai as inde it wa
also mine and dress in the robe of the holi isi she would pass
in state from her palac on the lochia to the serapeum to offer a
sacrific at the shrine of the fals god who sit in the templ and he
said that thereaft the fashion by which i should gain entranc to the
household of the queen should be contriv
then be veri weari i went to rest but could sleep littl for the
strang of the place the nois in the street and the thought of
the morrow while it wa yet dark i rose climb the stair to the
roof of the hous and wait present the sun rai shot out like
arrow and lit upon the white wonder of the marbl pharo whose light
instantli sank and di as though inde the sun had kill it now
the rai fell upon the palac of the lochia where cleopatra lai and
lit them up till thei flame like a jewel set on the dark cool bosom
of the sea awai the light flew kiss the soma sacr dome beneath
which alexand sleep touch the high top of a thousand palac
and templ past the portico of the great museum that loom near at
hand strike the lofti shrine where carv of ivori is the imag
of the fals god serapi and at last seem to lose itself in the vast
and gloomi necropoli then as the dawn gather into dai the flood of
bright overbrim the bowl of night flow into the lower land
and street and show alexandria red in the sunris as the mantl of
a king and shape as a mantl the etesian wind came up from the north
and swept awai the vapour from the harbour so that i saw their blue
water rock a thousand ship i saw too that mighti mole the
heptastadium i saw the hundr of street the countless hous the
innumer wealth and splendour of alexandria set like a queen between
lake mareoti and the ocean and domin both and i wa fill with
wonder thi then wa on citi in my heritag of land and citi
well it wa worth the grasp and have look my full and fed my
heart as it were with the sight of splendour i commun with the holi
isi and came down from the roof
in the chamber beneath wa my uncl sepa i told him that i had been
watch the sun rise over the citi of alexandria
so he said look at me from beneath hi shaggi eyebrow and what
thinkest thou of alexandria
i think it is like some citi of the god i answer
ay he repli fierc a citi of the infern godsa sink of
corrupt a bubbl well of iniqu a home of fals faith spring
from fals heart i would that not on stone of it wa left upon
anoth stone and that it wealth lai deep beneath yonder water i
would that the gull were scream across it site and that the wind
untaint by a grecian breath swept through it ruin from the ocean to
mareoti o royal harmachi let not the luxuri and beauti of alexandria
poison thy sens for in their deadli air faith perish and religion
cannot spread her heavenli wing when the hour come for thee to rule
harmachi cast down thi accurs citi and as thy father did set
up thy throne in the white wall of memphi for i tell thee that for
egypt alexandria is but a splendid gate of ruin and while it endur
all nation of the earth shall march through it to the plunder of the
land and all fals faith shall nestl in it and breed the overthrow of
egypt god
i made no answer for there wa truth in hi word and yet to me the
citi seem veri fair to look on after we had eaten my uncl told me
it wa now time to set out to view the march of cleopatra as she went
in triumph to the shrine of serapi for although she would not pass
till within two hour of the middai yet these peopl of alexandria have
so great a love of show and idl that had we not present set forth
by no mean could we have come through the press of the multitud who
were alreadi gather along the highwai where the queen must ride so
we went out to take our place upon a stand built of timber that had
been set up at the side of the great road which pierc through the
citi to the canop gate for my uncl had alreadi purchas a right to
enter there and that dearli
we won our wai with much struggl through the great crowd that were
alreadi gather in the street till we reach the scaffold of
timber which wa roof in with an awn and gaili hung with scarlet
cloth here we seat ourselv upon a bench and wait for some hour
watch the multitud press past shout sing and talk loudli
in mani tongu at length soldier came to clear the road clad after
the roman fashion in breastplat of chainarmour after them march
herald enjoin silenc at which the popul sung and shout all
the more loudli and cry that cleopatra the queen wa come
then follow a thousand cilician skirmish a thousand thracian a
thousand macedonian and a thousand gaul each arm after the fashion
of their countri then pass five hundr men of those who ar call
the fenc horsemen for both men and hors were altogeth cover
with mail next came youth and maiden sumptuous drape and wear
golden crown and with them imag symbolis dai and night morn
and noon the heaven and the earth after these walk mani fair women
pour perfum on the road and other scatter bloom flower
now there rose a great shout of cleopatra cleopatra and i held my
breath and bent forward to see her who dare to put on the robe of
isi
but at that moment the multitud so gather and thicken in front of
where i wa that i could no longer clearli see so in my eager
i leapt over the barrier of the scaffold and be veri strong
push my wai through the crowd till i reach the foremost rank and
as i did so nubian slave arm with thick stave and crown with
ivyleav ran up strike the peopl on man i note more especi
for he wa a giant and be strong wa insol beyond measur
smite the peopl without caus as inde is the wont of low person
set in author for a woman stood near to me an egyptian by her face
bear a child in her arm whom the man see that she wa weak
struck on the head with hi rod so that she fell prone and the peopl
murmur but at the sight my blood rush of a sudden through my vein
and drown my reason i held in my hand a staff of olivewood from
cypru and as the black brute laugh at the sight of the stricken
woman and her babe roll on the ground i swung the staff aloft and
smote so shrewdli did i strike that the tough rod split upon the
giant shoulder and the blood spurt forth stain hi trail
leav of ivi
then with a shriek of pain and furyfor those who smite love not that
thei be smittenh turn and sprang at me and all the peopl round
gave back save onli the woman who could not rise leav us two in a
ring as it were on he came with a rush and as he came be now mad
i smote him with my clench fist between the ey have noth els
with which to smite and he stagger like an ox beneath the first blow
of the priest ax then the peopl shout for thei love to see a
fight and the man wa known to them as a gladiat victori in the
game gather up hi strength the knave came on with an oath and
whirl hi heavi staff on high struck me in such a fashion that had
i not avoid the blow by nimbl i had sure been slain but as
it chanc the staff hit upon the ground and so heavili that it flew
in fragment thereon the multitud shout again and the great man
blind with furi rush at me to smite me down but with a cry i sprang
straight at hi throatfor he wa so heavi a man that i knew i could
not hope to throw him by strengthai and grip it there i clung
though hi fist batter me like bludgeon drive my thumb into hi
throat round and round we turn till at length he flung himself
to the earth trust thu to shake me off but i held on fast as we
roll over and over on the ground till at last he grew faint for want
of breath then i be uppermost drove my knee down upon hi chest
and as i believ should thu have slain him in my rage had not my
uncl and other there gather fallen upon me and drag me from
him
and meanwhil though i know it not the chariot in which the queen
sat with eleph go befor and lion led after it had reach the
spot and had been halt becaus of the tumult i look up and thu
torn pant my white garment stain with the blood that had rush
from the mouth and nostril of the mighti nubian i for the first time
saw cleopatra face to face her chariot wa all of gold and drawn by
milkwhit steed she sat in it with two fair girl clad in greek
attir stand on on either side fan her with glitter fan
on her head wa the cover of isi the golden horn between which
rest the moon round disk and the emblem of osiri throne with the
uru twine around beneath thi cover wa the vultur cap of gold
the blue enamel wing and the vultur head with gemmi ey under
which her long dark tress flow toward her feet about her round
neck wa a broad collar of gold stud with emerald and coral round
her arm and wrist were bracelet of gold stud with emerald and
coral and in on hand she held the holi cross of life fashion of
crystal and in the other the golden rod of royalti her breast wa
bare but under it wa a garment that glisten like the scali cover
of a snake everywher sewn with gem beneath thi robe wa a skirt
of golden cloth half hidden by a scarf of the broider silk of co
fall in fold to the sandal that fasten with great pearl
adorn her white and tini feet
all thi i discern at a glanc as it were then i look upon the
facethat face which seduc csar ruin egypt and wa doom to
give octavian the sceptr of the world i look upon the flawless
grecian featur the round chin the full rich lip the chisel
nostril and the ear fashion like delic shell i saw the
forehead low broad and love the crisp dark hair fall in
heavi wave that sparkl in the sun the arch eyebrow and the long
bent lash there befor me wa the grandeur of her imperi shape
there burnt the wonder ey hu like the cyprian violetey that
seem to sleep and brood on secret thing as night brood upon the
desert and yet as the night to shift chang and be illumin by
gleam of sudden splendour born within their starri depth all those
wonder i saw though i have small skill in tell them but even
then i knew that it wa not in these charm alon that the might of
cleopatra beauti lai it wa rather in a glori and a radianc cast
through the fleshli cover from the fierc soul within for she wa a
thing of flame like unto which no woman ha ever been or ever will be
even when she brood the fire of her quick heart shone through her
but when she woke and the lightn leapt suddenli from her ey and
the passionladen music of her speech chime upon her lip ah then
who can tell how cleopatra seem for in her met all the splendour
that have been given to woman for her glori and all the geniu which
man ha won from heaven and with them dwelt everi evil of that greater
sort which fear noth and make a mock of law ha taken
empir for it place of plai and smile water the growth of
it desir with the rich blood of men in her breast thei gather
togeth fashion that cleopatra whom no man mai draw and yet whom
no man have seen ever can forget thei fashion her grand as the
spirit of storm love as lightn cruel as pestil yet with a
heart and what she did is known woe to the world when such anoth
come to curs it
for a moment i met cleopatra ey as she idli bent herself to find the
tumult caus at first thei were sombr and dark as though thei saw
inde but the brain read noth then thei awok and their veri
colour seem to chang as the colour of the sea chang when the water
is shaken first there wa anger written in them next an idl note
then when she look upon the huge bulk of the man whom i had overcom
and knew him for the gladiat someth perchanc that wa not
far from wonder at the least thei soften though inde her face
chang no whit but he who would read cleopatra mind had need to
watch her ey for her counten vari but a littl turn she
said some word to her guard thei came forward and led me to her while
all the multitud wait silent to see me slain
i stood befor her my arm fold on my breast overcom though i wa
by the wonder of her loveli i hate her in my heart thi woman who
dare to cloth herself in the dress of isi thi usurp who sat upon
my throne thi wanton squander the wealth of egypt in chariot and
perfum when she had look me over from head to the feet she spake
in a low full voic and in the tongu of khemi which she alon had
learn of all the lagid
and who and what art thou egyptianfor egyptian i see thou artwho
darest to smite my slave when i make progress through my citi
i am harmachi i answer boldli harmachi the astrolog adopt
son of the high priest and governor of abouthi who am come hither to
seek my fortun i smote thy slave o queen becaus for no fault he
struck down the woman yonder ask of those who saw royal egypt
harmachi she said the name ha a high soundand thou hast a high
look and then speak to a soldier who had seen all she bade him
tell her what had come to pass thi he did truthfulli be friendli
dispos toward me becaus i had overcom the nubian thereon she
turn and spoke to the girl bear the fan who stood besid hera
woman with curl hair and shy dark ey veri beauti to see the
girl answer somewhat then cleopatra bade them bring the slave to her
so thei led forward the giant who had found hi breath again and with
him the woman whom he had smitten down
thou dog she said in the same low voic thou coward who
be strong didst smite down thi woman and be a coward wast
overthrown of thi young man see thou i will teach thee manner
henceforth when thou smitest women it shall be with thy left arm ho
guard seiz thi black slave and strike off hi right hand
her command given she sank back in her golden chariot and again
the cloud gather in her ey but the guard seiz the giant and
notwithstand hi cri and prayer for merci struck off hi hand
with a sword upon the wood of the scaffold and he wa carri awai
groan then the process move on again as it went the fair woman
with the fan turn her head caught my ey and smile and nod as
though she rejoic at which i wonder somewhat
the peopl cheer also and made jest sai that i should soon
practic astrolog in the palac but as soon as we might i and my
uncl escap and made our wai back to the hous all the while he
rate me for my rash but when we came to the chamber of the hous
he embrac me and rejoic greatli becaus i had overthrown the giant
with so littl hurt to myself

been my dearest hope now for mani year to thi end i charmion have
put asid my rank and becom servingwoman to cleopatra that i might
cut a notch in which thou couldst set thy foot when the hour came for
thee to climb the throne and pharaoh the notch is cut
thi then is our plot royal cousin thou must gain an entranc to the
household and learn it wai and secret and so far as mai be suborn
the eunuch and captain some of whom i have alreadi tempt thi
done and all thing be prepar without thou must slai cleopatra
and aid by me with those whom i control in the confus that shall
ensu throw wide the gate and admit those of our parti who ar
in wait put such of the troop as remain faith to the sword and
seiz the bruchium which be finish within two dai thou shalt
hold thi fickl alexandria at the same time those who ar sworn to
thee in everi citi of egypt shall rise in arm and in ten dai from
the death of cleopatra thou shalt inde be pharaoh thi is the counsel
which ha been taken and thou seest royal cousin that though our
uncl yonder think so ill of me i have learn my partai and plai
it
i hear thee cousin i answer marvel that so young a womansh

then shall i gain entranc to the palac of cleopatra
nai cousin as thing ar it is easi thu cleopatra love to look
upon a man andgiv me pardonthi face and form ar fair todai
she note them and twice she said she would she had ask where that
astrolog might be found for she held that an astrolog who could
wellnigh slai a nubian gladiat with hi bare hand must inde be a
master of the fortun star i answer her that i would caus inquiri
to be made so hearken royal harmachi at middai cleopatra sleep in
her inner hall which look over the garden to the harbour at that hour
tomorrow then i will meet thee at the gate of the palac whither
thou shalt come boldli ask for the ladi charmion i will make
appoint for thee with cleopatra so that she shall see thee alon
when she wake and the rest shall be for thee harmachi for much she
love to plai with the mysteri of magic and i have known her stand
whole night watch the star and make a pretenc to read them and
but late she ha sent awai dioscorid the physician becaus poor
fool he ventur on a propheci from the conjunct of the star that
cassiu would defeat mark antoni thereon cleopatra sent order to the
gener allienu bid him add the legion she had sent to syria
to help antoni to the armi of cassiu whose victori forsooth
wasaccord to dioscorideswritten on the star but as it chanc
antoni beat cassiu first and brutu afterward and so dioscorid ha
depart and now he lectur on herb in the museum for hi bread and
hate the name of star but hi place is empti and thou shalt fill it
and then we will work in secret and in the shadow of the sceptr ay
we will work like the worm at the heart of a fruit till the time of
pluck come and at thy dagger touch royal cousin the fabric of
thi grecian throne crumbl to nothing and the worm that rot it
burst hi servil cover and in the sight of empir spread hi
royal wing oer egypt
i gaze at thi strang girl onc more astonish and saw that her face
wa lit up with such a light as i had never seen in the ey of woman
ah broke in my uncl who wa watch her ah i love to see thee
so girl there is the charmion that i knew and i bred upnot the court
girl whom i like not drape in silk of co and fragrant with essenc
let thy heart harden in thi mouldai stamp it with the fervid zeal
of patriot faith and thy reward shall find thee and now cover up that
shameless dress of thine and leav us for it grow late tomorrow
harmachi shall come as thou hast said and so farewel
charmion bow her head and turn wrap her darkhu peplo
round her then take my hand she touch it with her lip and went
without ani further word
a strang woman said sepa when she had gone a most strang woman
and an uncertain
methought my uncl i said that thou wast somewhat harsh with her
ay he answer but not without a caus look thou harmachi
bewar of thi charmion she is too wayward and i fear me mai be led
awai in truth she is a veri woman and like a restiv hors will
take the path that pleas her she ha brain and fire and she love
our caus but i prai that the caus come not face to face with her
desir for what her heart is set on that will she do at ani cost she
will do it therefor i frighten her now while i mai for who can know
but that she will pass beyond my power i tell thee that in thi on
girl hand lie all our live and if she plai us fals what then
ala and ala that we must us such tool as these but it wa
need there wa no other wai and yet i misdoubt me i prai that it
mai be well still at time i fear my niec charmionsh is too fair
and the blood of youth run too warm in those blue vein of her
ah woe to the caus that build it strength upon a woman faith
for women ar faith onli where thei love and when thei love their
faithless becom their faith thei ar not fix as men ar fix
thei rise more high and sink more lowthei ar strong and chang as
the sea harmachi bewar of thi charmion for like the ocean she
mai float thee home or like the ocean she mai wreck thee and with
thee the hope of egypt

truth which is their habit ye sleep is a stair by which the
messeng of the guardian god mai descend in mani shape upon the

he led him forth from egypt to be crown in the capitol crown the
emperor of rome and lord of all the land for the rest i know not it
is hid from me
thu then i read the vision though to my sens it had a darker
mean but it is not well to prophesi evil unto king
meanwhil cleopatra had risen and have thrown back the gnat gauz
wa seat upon the edg of her couch her ey fix upon my face
while her finger plai with her girdl jewel end
of a truth she cri thou art the best of all magician for thou
readest my heart and drawest a hidden sweet out of the rough shell of
evil omen
ay o queen said charmion who stood by with downcast ey and i
thought that there wa bitter mean in her soft tone mai no rougher
word ever affront thy ear and no evil presag tread less close upon
it happi sens
cleopatra place her hand behind her head and lean back look at
me with halfshut ey
come show us of thy magic egyptian she said it is yet hot abroad
and i am weari of those hebrew ambassador and their talk of herod and
jerusalem i hate that herod as he shall findand will have none of
the ambassador todai though i yearn a littl to try my hebrew on
them what canst thou do hast thou no new trick by serapi if thou
canst conjur as well as thou canst prophesi thou shalt have a place
at court with pai and perquisit to boot if thy lofti soul doe not
scorn perquisit
nai i answer all trick ar old but there ar some form of
magic to be rare us and with discret that mai be new to thee o
queen art thou afraid to ventur on the charm
i fear noth go on and do thy worst come charmion and sit by me
but stai where ar all the girlsira and merirathei too love
magic
not so i said the charm work ill befor so mani now behold
and gaze at the twain i cast my wand upon the marbl and murmur
a spell for a moment it wa still and then as i mutter the rod
slowli began to writh it bent itself it stood on end and move of
it own motion next it put on scale and behold it wa a serpent that
crawl and fierc hiss
fie on thee cri cleopatra clap her hand callest thou that
magic why it is an old trick that ani waysid conjur can do i have
seen it a score of time
wait o queen i answer thou hast not seen all and as i spoke
the serpent seem to break in fragment and from each fragment grew a
new serpent and these too broke in fragment and bred other till in
a littl while the place to their glamour sight wa a seeth sea
of snake that crawl hiss and knot themselv in knot then
i made a sign and the serpent gather themselv round me and seem
slowli to twine themselv about my bodi and my limb till save my
face i wa wreath thick with hiss snake
oh horribl horribl cri charmion hide her counten in the
skirt of the queen garment
nai enough magician enough said the queen thy magic overwhelm
us
i wave my snakewrap arm and all wa gone there at my feet lai
the black wand tip with ivori and naught besid
the two women look upon each other and gasp with wonder but i took
up the wand and stood with fold arm befor them
is the queen content with my poor art i ask most humbl
ay that i am egyptian never did i see it like thou art court
astronom from thi dai forward with right of access to the queen
presenc hast thou more of such magic at thy call
yea royal egypt suffer that the chamber be a littl darken and i
will show thee on more thing
half am i afraid she answer nevertheless do thou as thi
harmachi sai charmion
so the curtain were drawn and the chamber made as though the twilight
were at hand i came forward and stood besid cleopatra gaze thou
there i said sternli point with my wand to the empti space where i
had been and thou shalt behold that which is in thy mind
then for a littl space wa silenc while the two women gaze fixedli
and half fear at the spot
and as thei gaze a cloud gather befor them veri slowli it took
shape and form and the form it took wa the form of a man though as
yet he wa but vagu map upon the twilight and seem now to grow
and now to melt awai
then i cri with a loud voic
spirit i conjur thee appear
and as i cri the thing perfect in everi part leapt into form befor
us suddenli as the flash of dai hi shape wa the shape of royal
csar the toga thrown about hi face and on hi form a vestment bloodi
from a hundr wound an instant so he stood then i wave my wand and
he wa gone
i turn to the two women on the couch and saw cleopatra love face
all cloth in terror her lip were ashi white her ey stare wide
and all the flesh wa shake on her bone
man she gasp man who and what art thou who canst bring the dead
befor our ey
i am the queen astronom magician servantwhat the queen will
i answer laugh wa thi the form that wa on the queen mind
she made no answer but rise left the chamber by anoth door
then charmion rose also and took her hand from her face for she too
had been stricken with dread
how dost thou these thing royal harmachi she said tell me for
of a truth i fear thee
be not afraid i answer perchanc thou didst see noth but what
wa in my mind all thing ar shadow how canst thou then know their
natur or what is and what onli seem to be but how goe it rememb
charmion thi sport is plai to an end
it goe well she said by tomorrow morn dawn these tale
will have gone round and thou wilt be more fear than ani man in
alexandria follow me i prai thee
chapter iv
of the wai of charmion and of the crown of harmachi as the king of
love
on the follow dai i receiv the write of my appoint as
astrolog and magicianinchief to the queen with the pai and
perquisit of that offic which were not small room were given me
in the palac also through which i pass at night to the high
watchtow whenc i look on the star and drew their auguri for
at thi time cleopatra wa much troubl about matter polit and
not know how the great struggl among the roman faction would end
but be veri desir to side with the strongest she took constant
counsel with me as to the warn of the star these i read to her
in such manner as best seem to fit the high interest of my end for
antoni the roman triumvir wa now in asia minor and rumour ran veri
wroth becaus it had been told him that cleopatra wa hostil to the
triumvir in that her gener serapion had aid cassiu but
cleopatra protest loudli to me and other that serapion had act
against her will yet charmion told me that as with allienu it wa
becaus of a propheci of dioscorid the unlucki that the queen herself
had secretli order serapion so to do still thi did not save
serapion for to prove to antoni that she wa innoc she drag the
gener from the sanctuari and slew him woe be to those who carri
out the will of tyrant if the scale should rise against them and so
serapion perish
meanwhil all thing went well with us for the mind of cleopatra and
those about her were so set upon affair abroad that neither she nor
thei thought of revolt at home but dai by dai our parti gather
strength in the citi of egypt and even in alexandria which is to
egypt as anoth land all thing be foreign there dai by dai those
who doubt were won over and sworn to the caus by that oath which
cannot be broken and our plan of action more firmli laid and everi
other dai i went forth from the palac to take counsel with my uncl
sepa and there at hi hous met the nobl and the great priest who
were for the parti of khem
i saw much of cleopatra the queen and i wa ever more astonish at
the wealth and splendour of her mind that for rich and varieti
wa as a woven cloth of gold throw back all light from it chang
face she fear me somewhat and therefor wish to make a friend of
me ask me of mani matter that seem to be beyond the provinc of
my offic i saw much of the ladi charmion alsoinde she wa ever at
my side so that i scarc knew when she came and when she went for she
would draw nigh with that soft step of her and i would turn to find
her at hand and watch me beneath the long lash of her downcast
ey there wa no servic that wa too hard for her and no task too
long for dai and night she labour for me and for our caus
but when i thank her for her loyalti and said it should be had in
mind in that time which wa at hand she stamp her foot and pout
with her lip like an angri child sai that among all the thing
which i had learn thi had i not learnedthat love servic ask
no payment and wa it own guerdon and i be innoc in such
matter and foolish that i wa hold the wai of women as of small
account read her sai in the sens that her servic to the caus
of khem which she love brought with them their own reward but when
i prais so fine a spirit she burst into angri tear and left me
wonder for i knew noth of the troubl at her heart i knew not
then that unsought thi woman had given me her love and that she wa
rent and torn by pang of passion fix like arrow in her breast i did
not knowhow should i know it who never look upon her otherwis than
as an instrument of our joint and holi caus her beauti never stir
meno not even when she lean over me and breath upon my hair i
never thought of it otherwis than as a man think of the beauti of a
statu what had i to do with such delight i who wa sworn to isi
and dedic to the caus of egypt o ye god bear me wit that i am
innoc of thi thing which wa the sourc of all my woe and the woe of
khem
how strang a thing is thi love of woman that is so small in it
begin and in it end so great see at the first it is as the
littl spring of water well from a mountain heart and at the last
what is it it is a mighti river that float argosi of joi and make
wide land to smile or perchanc it is a torrent to wash in a flood
of ruin across the field of hope burst in the barrier of design
and bring to tumbl nothing the tenement of man puriti and the
templ of hi faith for when the invis conceiv the order of the
univers he set thi seed of woman love within it plan that by it
most unequ growth is doom to bring about equal of law for now
it lift the low to height untold and now it bring the nobl to the
level of the dust and thu while woman that great surpris of natur
is good and evil can never grow apart for still she stand and blind
with love shoot the shuttl of our fate and pour sweet water into
the cup of bitter and poison the wholesom breath of life with the
doom of her desir turn thi wai and turn that she is at hand to meet
thee her weak is thy strength her might is thy undo of her
thou art to her thou goest she is thy slave yet hold thee captiv
at her touch honour wither lock open and barrier fall she is
infinit as ocean she is variabl as heaven and her name is the
unforeseen man strive not to escap from woman and the love of
woman for fly where thou wilt she is yet thy fate and whateer thou
buildest thou buildest it for her
and thu it came to pass that i harmachi who had put such matter far
from me wa yet doom to fall by the thing i held of no account for
see thi charmion she love mewhi i know not of her own thought
she learn to love me and of her love came what shall be told but i
know naught treat her like a sister walk as it were hand in
hand with her toward our common end
and so the time pass on till at length all thing were made readi
it wa the night befor the night when the blow should fall and there
were revel in the palac that veri dai i had seen sepa and with
him the captain of a band of five hundr men who should burst into
the palac at midnight on the morrow when i had slain cleopatra the
queen and put the roman and the gallic legionari to the sword that
veri dai i had suborn the captain paulu who sinc i drew him through
the gate wa my will slave half by fear and half by promis of
great reward i had prevail upon him for the watch wa hi to unbar
that small gate which face to the east at the signal on the morrow
night
all wa made readyth flower of freedom that had been fiveandtwenti
year in growth wa on the point of bloom arm compani were
gather in everi citi from abu to athu and spi look out from
their wall await the come of the messeng who should bring
tide that cleopatra wa no more and that harmachi the royal
egyptian had seiz the throne
all wa prepar triumph hung in my hand as a ripe fruit to the hand of
the plucker yet as i sat at the royal feast my heart wa heavi and a
shadow of come woe lai cold within my mind i sat there in a place
of honour near the majesti of cleopatra and look down the line of
guest bright with gem and garland with flower mark those whom
i had doom to die there befor me lai cleopatra in all her beauti
which thrill the behold as he is thrill by the rush of the
midnight gale or by the sight of stormi water i gaze on her as she
touch her lip with wine and toi with the chaplet of rose on her
brow think of the dagger beneath my robe that i had sworn to buri in
her breast again and yet again i gaze and strove to hate her
strove to rejoic that she must dieand could not there too behind
herwatch me now as ever with her deepfring eyeswa the
love ladi charmion who to look at her innoc face would believ
that she wa the setter of that snare in which the queen who love her
should miser perish who would dream that the secret of so much
death wa lock in her girlish breast i gaze and grew sick at heart
becaus i must anoint my throne with blood and by evil sweep awai the
evil of the land at that hour i wish inde that i wa noth
but some humbl husbandman who in it season grow and in it season
garner the golden grain ala the seed that i had been doom to sow
wa the seed of death and now i must reap the red fruit of the harvest
why harmachi what ail thee said cleopatra smile her slow
smile ha the golden skein of star got tangl my astronom or
dost thou plan some new feat of magic sai what is it that thou dost so
poorli grace our feast nai now did i not know have made inquiri
that thing so low as we poor women ar far beneath thy gaze why i
should swear that ero had found thee out harmachi
nai that i am spare o queen i answer the servant of the star
mark not the smaller light of woman ey and therein is he happi
cleopatra lean herself toward me look on me long and steadili in
such fashion that despit my will the blood flutter at my heart
boast not thou proud egyptian she said in a low voic which none but
i and charmion could hear lest perchanc thou dost tempt me to match
my magic against thine what woman can forgiv that a man should push
us by as thing of no account it is an insult to our sex which natur
self abhor and she lean back again and laugh most music but
glanc up i saw charmion her teeth on her lip and an angri frown
upon her brow
pardon royal egypt i answer coldli but with such wit as i could
summon befor the queen of heaven even star grow pale thi i said
of the moon which is the sign of the holi mother whom cleopatra dare
to rival name herself isi come to earth
happili said she answer clap her white hand why here an
astronom who ha wit and can shape a compliment nai such a wonder
must not pass unnot lest the god resent it charmion take thi
rosechaplet from my hair and set it upon the learn brow of our
harmachi he shall be crown king of love whether he will it or
not
charmion lift the chaplet from cleopatra brow and bear it to
where i wa with a smile set it upon my head yet warm and fragrant from
the queen hair but so roughli that she pain me somewhat she
did thi becaus she wa wroth although she smile with her lip and
whisper an omen royal harmachi for though she wa so veri much
a woman yet when she wa anger or suffer jealousi charmion had a
childish wai
have thu fix the chaplet she curtsi low befor me and with the
softest tone of mockeri name me in the greek tongu harmachi king
of love then cleopatra laugh and pledg me as king of love and
so did all the compani find the jest a merri on for in alexandria
thei love not those who live straitli and turn asid from women
but i sat there a smile upon my lip and black wrath in my heart for
know who and what i wa it irk me to think myself a jest for the
frivol nobl and light beauti of cleopatra court but i wa
chiefli anger against charmion becaus she laugh the loudest and i
did not then know that laughter and bitter ar often the veil with
which a sore heart wrap it weak from the world an omen she said
it wasthat crown of flowersand so it prove inde for i wa fate
to barter the doubl diadem of the upper and the lower land for a wreath
of passion rose that fade befor thei fulli bloom and pharaoh
ivori bed of state for the pillow of a faithless woman breast
king of love thei crown me in their mockeri ay and king of
shame and i with the perfum rose on my browi by descent and
ordin the pharaoh of egyptthought of the imperish hall
of abouthi and of that other crown which on the morrow should be
consumm
but still smile i pledg them back and answer with a jest for
rise i bow befor cleopatra and crave leav to go venu i
said speak of the planet that we know as donaou in the morn and
bonou in the even wa in the ascend therefor as newcrown
king of love i must now pass to do my homag to it queen for these
barbarian name venu queen of love
and so amidst their laughter i withdraw to my watchtow and dash
that shame chaplet down amidst the instrument of my craft made
pretenc to note the roll of the star there i wait think on
mani thing that were to be until charmion should come with the last
list of the doom and the messag of my uncl sepa whom she had seen
that even
at length the door open softli and she came jewel and clad in her
white robe as she had left the feast

of the come of cleopatra to the chamber of harmachi of the throw
forth of the kerchief of charmion of the star and of the gift by
cleopatra of her friendship to her servant harmachi

death how hast thou settl it must it be by my own hand
yea my lord she answer and again i caught that note of bitter
in her voic doubtless pharaoh will rejoic that hi should be the
hand to rid the land of thi fals queen and wanton woman and at on
blow break the chain which gall the neck of egypt
talk not thu girl i said thou knowest well that i do not rejoic
be but driven to the act by deep necess and the pressur of my
vow can she not then be poison or can no on of the eunuch be

i heard her bid ira to leav her i mai not be found alon with thee
at thi hour it ha a strang look and she mai suspect what want she

i glanc round at the further end of the chamber wa a heavi curtain
that hid a littl place built in the thick of the wall which i us
for the storag of roll and instrument
hast theether i said and she glide behind the curtain which
swung back and cover her then i thrust the fatal scroll of death into
the bosom of my robe and bent over the mystic chart present i heard
the sweep of woman robe and there came a low knock upon the door
enter whoever thou art i said
the latch lift and cleopatra swept in royal arrai her dark
hair hang about her and the sacr snake of royalti glisten on her
brow
of a truth harmachi she said with a sigh as she sank into a seat

i saw of the art of that love live falsehood cleopatra which
for pastim she practis on thy folli i have spoken out my heart and
answer thou and she clasp her hand and draw on pace nearer
gaze all white and trembl on my face
for a moment i stood struck dumb for the magic of her voic and the
power of her speech despit myself stir me like the rush of music
had i love the woman doubtless she might have fire me with her flame
but i love her not and i could not plai at passion and so thought
came and with thought that laugh mood which is ever apt to fashion
upon nerv strain to the point of break in a flash as it were
i bethought me of the wai in which she had that veri night forc the
wreath of rose on my head i thought of the kerchief and how i had
flung it forth i thought of charmion in the littl chamber watch
what she held to be the art of cleopatra and of her bitter speech
lastli i thought of what my uncl sepa would sai of her could he see
her now and of the strang and tangl skein in which i wa inmesh
and i laugh aloudth fool laughter that wa my knell of ruin
she turn whiter yetwhit as the deadand a look grew upon her face
that check my foolish mirth thou findest then harmachi she
said in a low choke voic and drop the level of her ey thou
findest caus of merriment in what i have said
nai i answer nai charmion forgiv me if i laugh it wa
rather a laugh of despair for what am i to sai to thee thou hast
spoken high word of all thou mightest be is it left for me to tell
thee what thou art
she shrank and i paus
speak she said
thou knowestnon so wellwho i am and what my mission is thou
knowestnon so wellthat i am sworn to isi and mai by law divin
have naught to do with thee
ay she broke in in her low voic and with her ey still fix upon
the groundai and i know that thy vow ar broken in spirit if not
in formbroken like wreath of cloud for harmachisth lovest
cleopatra
it is a lie i cri thou wanton girl who wouldst seduc me from my
duti and put me to an open shamewho led by passion or ambit or
the love of evil hast not shame to break the barrier of thy sex and
speak as thou hast spokenbewar lest thou go too far and if thou wilt
have an answer here it is put straightli as thy question charmion
outsid the matter of my duti and my vow thou art naught to menor
for all thy tender glanc will my heart beat on puls more fast
hardli art thou now my friendfor of a truth i scarc can trust thee
but onc more bewar to me thou mayest do thy worst but if thou dost
dare to lift a finger against our caus that dai thou diest and now
is thi plai done
and as wild with anger i spoke thu she shrank back and yet further
back till at length she rest against the wall her ey cover with
her hand but when i ceas she drop her hand glanc up and her
face wa as the face of a statu in which the great ey glow like
ember and round them wa a ring of purpl shadow
not altogeth done she answer gentli the arena must yet be
sand thi she said have refer to the cover up of the
bloodstain at the gladiatori show with fine sand well she went
on wast not thine anger on a thing so vile i have thrown my throw
and i have lost v victisah v victi wilt thou not lend me
the dagger in thy robe that here and now i mai end my shame no then
on word more most royal harmachi if thou canst forget my folli
but at the least have no fear from me i am now as ever thy servant
and the servant of our caus farewel
and she went lean her hand against the wall but i pass to
my chamber flung myself upon my couch and groan in bitter of
spirit ala we shape our plan and by slow degre build up our hous
of hope never count on the guest that time shall bring to lodg
therein for who can guard againstth unforeseen
at length i slept and my dream were evil when i woke the light of
the dai which should see the red fulfil of the plot wa stream
through the casement and the bird sang merrili among the garden palm
i woke and as i woke the sens of troubl press in upon me for i
rememb that befor thi dai wa gather to the past i must dip
my hand in bloody in the blood of cleopatra who trust me why
could i not hate her as i should there had been a time when i look on
to thi act of vengeanc with somewhat of a righteou glow of zeal and
nowand nowwhi i would frankli give my royal birthright to be free
from it necess but ala i knew that there wa no escap i
must drain thi cup or be for ever cast awai i felt the ey of egypt
watch me and the ey of egypt god i prai to my mother isi
to give me strength to do thi deed and prai as i had never prai
befor and oh wonder no answer came nai how wa thi what then
had loos the link between us that for the first time the goddess
deign no repli to her son and chosen servant could it be that i
had sin in heart against her what had charmion saidthat i love
cleopatra wa thi sick love nai a thousand time nayit wa
but the revolt of natur against an act of treacheri and blood the
goddess did but try my strength or perchanc she also turn her holi
counten from murder
i rose fill with terror and despair and went about my task like a man
without a soul i con the fatal list and note all the plansai in
my brain i gather up the veri word of that proclam of my royalti
which on the morrow i should issu to the startl world
citizen of alexandria and dweller in the land of egypt it began
cleopatra the macedonian hath by the command of the god suffer
justic for her crime

the minut wore awai in the third hour of the afternoon i went as by
appoint fix to the hous where my uncl sepa lodg that same
hous to which i had been brought some three month gone when i enter
alexandria for the first time and here i found the leader of the

emerg and our high empris i felt someth of the spirit of
former dai flow back into my heart at the last all wa order and so
order that it could scarc miscarri for it wa fix that if by ani
chanc i could not come to slai cleopatra on thi night then the plot
should hang in the scale till the morrow when the deed must be done
upon occas for the death of cleopatra wa the signal these matter

the wai down the stair and through the empti hall
in the chamber that is call the alabast hall the roof of which
is upborn by column of black marbl we stai for beyond wa the
privat chamber of cleopatra the same in which i had seen her sleep
abid thou here she said while i tell cleopatra of thy come and
she glide from my side
i stood for long mayhap in all the half of an hour count my own
heartbeat and as in a dream strive to gather up my strength to
that which lai befor me
at length charmion came back her head held low and walk heavili
cleopatra wait thee she said pass on there is no guard
where do i meet thee when what must be done is done i ask hoars
thou meetest me here and then to paulu be firm and prosper
harmachi fare thee well
and so i went but at the curtain i turn suddenli and there in the
midst of that lone lamplit hall i saw a strang sight far awai in
such a fashion that the light struck full upon her stood charmion her
head thrown back her white arm outstretch as though to clasp and on
her girlish face a stamp of anguish passion so terribl to see that
inde i cannot tell it for she believ that i whom she love wa
pass to my death and thi wa her last farewel to me
but i knew naught of thi matter so with anoth pass pang of wonder
i drew asid the curtain gain the doorwai and stood in cleopatra
chamber and there upon a silken couch at the far end of the perfum
chamber clad in wonder white attir rest cleopatra in her hand
wa a jewel fan of ostrich plume with which she gentli fan
herself and by her side wa her harp of ivori and a littl tabl
whereon were fig and goblet and a flask of rubycolour wine i drew
near slowli through the soft dim light to where the wonder of the world
lai in all her glow beauti and inde i have never seen her look
so fair as she did upon that fatal night couch in her amber cushion
she seem to shine as a star on the twilight glow perfum came from
her hair and robe music fell from her lip and in her heavenli ey
all light chang and gather as in the omin opal disc
and thi wa the woman whom present i must slai
slowli i drew near bow as i came but she took no heed she lai
there and the jewel fan float to and fro like the bright wing of
some hover bird
at length i stood befor her and she glanc up the ostrichplum
press against her breast as though to hide it beauti
what friend art thou come she said it is well for i grew lone
here nai ti a weari world we know so mani face and there ar so
few whom we love to see again well stand not there so mute but be
seat and she point with her fan to a carven chair that wa place
near her feet
onc more i bow and took the seat
i have obei the queen desir i said and with much care and
skill work out the lesson of the star and here is the record of my
labour if the queen permit i will expound it to her and i rose in
order that i might pass round the couch and as she read stab her in
the back
nai harmachi she said quietli and with a slow and love smile
bide thou where thou art and give me the write by serapi thy face
is too come for me to wish to lose the sight of it
check in thi design i could do noth but hand her the papyru
think to myself that while she read i would aris suddenli and plung
the dagger to her heart she took it and as she did so touch my hand
then she made pretenc to read but she read no word for i saw that her
ey were fix upon me over the edg of the scroll
why placest thou thy hand within thy robe she ask present for
inde i clutch the dagger hilt is thy heart stir
yea o queen i said it beat high
she gave no answer but onc more made pretenc to read and the while
she watch me
i took counsel with myself how should i do the hate deed if i flung
myself upon her now she would see me and scream and struggl nai i
must wait a chanc
the auguri ar favour then harmachi she said at length
though thi she must have guess
ye o queen i answer
it is well and she cast the write on the marbl the ship shall
sail for good or bad i am weari of weigh chanc
thi is a heavi matter o queen i said i had wish to show upon
what circumst i base my forecast
nai not so harmachi i have weari of the wai of star thou hast
prophesi that is enough for me for doubtless be honest thou
hast written honestli therefor save thou thy reason and well be
merri what shall we do i could danc to theether ar none who can
danc so wellbut it would scarc be queenli nai i have it i will
sing and lean forward she rais herself and bend the harp
toward her struck some wander chord then her low voic broke out
in perfect and most sweet song
and thu she sang
night on the sea and night upon the sky
and music in our heart we float there
lull by the low sea voic thou and i
and the wind kiss in my cloudi hair
and thou didst gaze on me and call me fair
enfold by the starri robe of night
and then thy sing thrill upon the air
voic of the heart desir and love delight
adrift with starlit ski abov
with starlit sea below
we move with all the sun that move
with all the sea that flow
for bond or free earth sky and sea
wheel with on circl will
and thy heart drifteth on to me
and onli time stand still
between two shore of death we drift
behind ar thing forgot
befor the tide is drive swift
to land beholden not
abov the sky is far and cold
below the moan sea
sweep oer the love that were of old
but oh love kiss thou me
ah lone ar the ocean wai
and danger the deep
and frail the fairi barqu that strai
abov the sea asleep
ah toil no more at sail nor oar
we drift or bond or free
on yon far shore the breaker roar
but oh love kiss thou me
and ever as thou sangest i drew near
then sudden silenc heard our heart that beat
for now there wa an end of doubt and fear
now passion fill my soul and led my feet
then silent didst thou rise thy love to meet
who sink on thy breast knew naught but thee
and in the happi night i kiss thee sweet
ah sweet between the starlight and the sea
the last echo of her rich note float down the chamber and slowli
di awai but in my heart thei roll on and on i have heard among
the womensing at abouthi voic more perfect than the voic of
cleopatra but never have i heard on so thrill or so sweet with
passion honeynot and inde it wa not the voic alon it wa the
perfum chamber in which wa set all that could move the sens it
wa the passion of the thought and word and the surpass grace and
loveli of that most royal woman who sang them for as she sang i
seem to think that we twain were inde float alon with the night
upon the starlit summer sea and when she ceas to touch the harp and
rise suddenli stretch out her arm toward me and with the last
low note of song yet quiver upon her lip let fall the wonder of
her ey upon my ey she almost drew me to her but i rememb and
would not
hast thou then no word of thank for my poor sing harmachi she
said at length
yea o queen i answer speak veri low for my voic wa choke
but thy song ar not good for the son of men to hearof a truth thei
overwhelm me
nai harmachi there is no fear for thee she said laugh softli
see that i know how far thy thought ar set from woman beauti and
the common weak of thy sex with cold iron we mai safe toi
i thought within myself that coldest iron can be brought to whitest heat
if the fire be fierc enough but i said noth and though my hand
trembl i onc more grasp the dagger hilt and wild with fear
at my own weak set myself to find a mean to slai her while yet my
sens remain
come hither harmachi she went on in her softest voic come sit
by me and we will talk togeth for i have much to tell thee and she
made place for me at her side upon the silken seat
and i think that i might so more swiftli strike rose and seat
myself some littl wai from her on the couch while fling back her
head she gaze on me with her slumbrou ey
now wa my occas for her throat and breast were bare and with a
mighti effort onc again i lift my hand to clutch the daggerhilt
but more quick than thought she caught my finger with her own and
gentli held them
why lookest thou so wildli harmachi she said art sick
ay sick inde i gasp
then lean thou on the cushion and rest thee she answer still
hold my hand from which the strength had fled the fit will sure
pass too long hast thou labour with thy star how soft is the night
air that flow from yonder casement heavi with the breath of lili
hark to the whisper of the sea lap against the rock that though
it is faint yet be so strong doth almost drown the quick cool fall
of yonder fountain list to philomel how sweet from a full heart of
love she sing her messag to her dear inde it is a love night and
most beauti is natur music sung with a hundr voic from wind
and tree and bird and ocean wrinkl lip and yet sung all to tune

sure such a shoot could spring but from the stock of princ what

loneli and with the golden web of love of twain weav on ident
why it is never to have live harmachi
and ever as she murmur she drew nearer to me till at last with a
long sweet sigh she flung on arm about my neck and gaze upon me
with blue unfathom ey and smile her dark slow smile that
like an open flower reveal beauti within beauti hidden nearer
she bent her queenli form and still more nearnow her perfum breath

neither speak nor rise
but cleopatra bend over me drew the dagger from my robe

chapter viii
of the awak of harmachi of the sight of death of the come of
cleopatra and of her comfort word
onc more i woke it wa to find myself in my own chamber i start up

wa the shape of a manthat thing drape in bloodstain white and
huddl in a hideou heap at the foot of the couch on which i seem to
lie
i sprang at it with a shriek as a lion spring and struck with all my
strength the blow fell heavili and beneath it weight the thing
roll over upon it side half mad with terror i rent awai the white
cover and there hi knee bound beneath hi hang jaw wa the
nake bodi of a manand that man the roman captain paulu there he

wall stai me while without the bird sang a merri greet to the
dai so it wa no dream and i wa lost lost
i thought of my ag father amenemhat ye the vision of him flash
into my mind as he would be when thei came to tell him hi son shame
and the ruin of all hi hope i thought of that patriot priest my
uncl sepa wait the long night through for the signal which never
came ah and anoth thought follow swift how would it go with
them i wa not the onli traitor i too had been betrai by whom by
yonder paulu perchanc if it were paulu he knew but littl of
those who conspir with me but the secret list had been in my robe o
osiri thei were gone and the fate of paulu would be the fate of all
the patriot in egypt and at thi thought my mind gave wai i sank and
swoon even where i stood
my sens came back to me and the lengthen shadow told me that it
wa afternoon i stagger to my feet the corps of paulu wa still
there keep it aw watch abov me i ran desper to the door
it wa bar and without i heard the tramp of sentinel as i stood
thei challeng and ground their spear then the bolt were shot
back the door open and radiant clad in royal attir came the
conquer cleopatra she came alon and the door wa shut behind her
i stood like on distraught but she swept on till she wa face to face
with me
greet harmachi she said smile sweetli so my messeng ha
found thee and she point to the corps of paulu pah he ha an
ugli look ho guard
the door wa open and two arm gaul step across the threshold
take awai thi carrion said cleopatra and fling it to the kite
stai draw that dagger from hi traitor breast the men bow low and
the knife rust red with blood wa drag from the heart of paulu
and laid upon the tabl then thei seiz him by the head and bodi and
stagger thenc and i heard their heavi footfal as thei bore him
down the stair
methink harmachi thou art in an evil case she said when the
sound of the footfal had di awai how strang the wheel of
fortun turn but for that traitor and she nod toward the door
through which the corps of paulu had been carri i should now be as
ill a thing to look on as he is and the red rust on yonder knife would
have been gather from my heart
so it wa paulu who had betrai me
ay she went on and when thou camest to me last night i knew that
thou camest to slai when time upon time thou didst place thy hand
within thy robe i knew that it grasp a dagger hilt and that thou
wast gather thy courag to the deed which thou didst littl love
to do oh it wa a strang wild hour well worth the live and
i wonder greatli from moment to moment which of us twain would
conquer as we match guil with guil and forc to forc
yea harmachi the guard tramp befor thy door but be not deceiv
did i not know that i hold thee to me by bond more strong than prison
chainsdid i not know that i am hedg from ill at thy hand by a fenc
of honour harder for thee to pass than all the spear of all my legion
thou hadst been dead er now harmachi see here is thy knife and
she hand me the dagger now slai me if thou canst and she drew
near tore open the bosom of her robe and stood wait with calm ey
thou canst not slai me she went on for there ar thing as i know
well that no manno man such as thou artmai do and live and thi is
the chief of themto slai the woman who is all hi own nai stai thy
hand turn not that dagger against thy breast for if thou mayst not
slai me by how much more mayst thou not slai thyself o thou forsworn

in amenti with what ey thinkest thou will the heavenli mother look
upon her son who shame in all thing and fals to hi most sacr
vow come to greet her hi lifeblood on hi hand where then will
be the space for thy atonementif inde thou mayest aton
then i could bear no more for my heart wa broken ala it wa too
truei dare not die i wa come to such a pass that i did not even
dare to die i flung myself upon the couch and weptwept tear of blood
and anguish
but cleopatra came to me and seat herself besid me she strove to
comfort me throw her arm about my neck

anger against thee we did plai a mighti game but as i warn thee
i match my woman magic against thine and i have conquer but i
will be open with thee both as queen and woman thou hast my pityai
and more nor do i love to see thee plung in sorrow it wa well
and right that thou shouldst strive to win back that throne my father
seiz and the ancient liberti of egypt myself as law queen had
done the same nor shrunk from the deed of dark to which i wa
sworn therein then thou hast my sympathi that ever goe out to what
is great and bold it is well also that thou shouldst griev over the
great of thy fall therein then as womana love womanth
hast my sympathi nor is all lost thy plan wa foolishfor as i hold
egypt could never have stood alonefor though thou hadst won the crown
and countrya without a doubt thou must have doneyet there wa the
roman to be reckon with and for thy hope learn thi i am littl
known there is no heart in thi wide land that beat with a truer
love for ancient khem than doe thi heart of minenai not thine

to thy trust didst serv thee of such mean as natur gave thee and
win the heart of egypt queen that through her gentl love thou
mightest yet attain thy end and spread thy wing of power across the
land of nile am i an illcounsellor thinkest thou harmachi
i lift my head and a rai of hope crept into the dark of my heart
for when men fall thei grasp at feather then i spoke for the first
time
and those with methos who trust mewhat of them
ay she answer amenemhat thy father the ag priest of abouthi
and sepa thy uncl that fieri patriot whose great heart is hid

rose against him drag athini pausira chesuphu and irobasthu
bound to hi chariotnot as achil drag hector but yet
livinground the citi wall i will spare them all save the hebrew
if there be ani hebrew for the jew i hate
there ar no hebrew i said
it is well she said for no hebrew will i ever spare am i then
inde so cruel a woman as thei sai in thy list harmachi were
mani doom to die and i have but taken the life of on roman knave
a doubl traitor for he betrai both me and thee art thou not
overwhelm harmachi with the weight of merci which i give thee
becausesuch ar a woman reasonsth pleasest me harmachi nai
by serapi she ad with a littl laugh ill chang my mind i will
not give thee so much for noth thou shalt bui it from me and the
price shall be a heavi oneit shall be a kiss harmachi
nai i said turn from that fair temptress the price is too
heavi i kiss no more

choos i am but a woman harmachi and on who is not wont to sue to
men do as thou wilt but thi i sai to theeif thou dost put me awai
i will gather up the merci i have mete out therefor most virtuou
priest choos thou between the heavi burden of my love and the swift
death of thy ag father and of all those who plot with him
i glanc at her and saw that she wa anger for her ey shone and
her bosom heav so i sigh and kiss her therebi set the seal
upon my shame and bondag then smile like the triumphant aphrodit
of the greek she went thenc bear the dagger with her
i knew not yet how deepli i wa betrai or why i wa still left to
draw the breath of life or why cleopatra the tigerheart had grown
merci i did not know that she fear to slai me lest so strong wa
the plot and so feebl her hold upon the doubl crown the tumult that
might tread hard upon the tide of my murder should shake her from the
throneeven when i wa no more i did not know that becaus of fear
and the weight of polici onli she show scant merci to those whom i
had betrai or that becaus of cun and not for the holi sake of
woman lovethough in truth she like me well enoughsh chose
rather to bind me to her by the fibr of my heart and yet i will sai
thi in her behalf even when the dangercloud had melt from her
sky she kept faith nor save paulu and on other did ani suffer
the utmost penalti of death for their part in the great plot against
cleopatra crown and dynasti but thei suffer mani other thing
and so she went leav the vision of her glori to strive with the
shame and sorrow in my heart oh bitter were the hour that could not
now be made light with prayer for the link between me and the divin
wa snap and isi commun with her priest no more bitter were the
hour and dark but ever through their dark shone the starri ey of
cleopatra and came the echo of her whisper love for not yet wa the
cup of sorrow full hope still linger in my heart and i could almost
think that i had fail to some higher end and that in the depth of
ruin i should find anoth and more floweri path to triumph
for thu those who sin deceiv themselv strive to lai the burden
of their evil deed upon the back of fate strive to believ their
wicked mai compass good and to murder conscienc with the sharp
plea of necess but it can avail noth for hand in hand down the
path of sin rush remors and ruin and woe to him thei follow ay and
woe to me who of all sinner am the chief
chapter ix
of the imprison of harmachi of the scorn of charmion of the
set free of harmachi and of the come of quintu delliu
for a space of eleven dai i wa thu kept prison in my chamber nor
did i see anyon except the sentri at my door the slave who in
silenc brought me food and drink and cleopatra self who came
continu but though her word of love were mani she would tell me
noth of how thing went without she came in mani moodsnow gai and
laugh now full of wise thought and speech and now passion onli
and to everi mood she gave some newfound charm she wa full of talk as
to how i should help her make egypt great and lessen the burden on
the peopl and fright the roman eagl back and though at first i
listen heavili when she spoke thu by slow advanc as she wrap
me closer and yet more close in her magic web from which there wa no
escap my mind fell in time with her then i too open someth
of my heart and somewhat also of the plan that i had form for egypt
she seem to listen gladli weigh them all and spoke of mean
and method tell me how she would purifi the faith and repair the
ancient templesai and build new on to the god and ever she crept
deeper into my heart till at length now that everi other thing had
gone from me i learn to love her with all the unspent passion of my
ach soul i had naught left to me but cleopatra love and i twine
my life about it and brood on it as a widow over her onli babe and
thu the veri author of my shame becam my all my dearest dear and
i love her with a strong love that grew and grew till it seem to
swallow up the past and make the present a dream for she had conquer
me she had rob me of my honour and steep me to the lip in shame
and i poor fallen blind wretch i kiss the rod that smote me and
wa her veri slave
ay even now in those dream which still come when sleep unlock the
secret heart and set it terror free to roam through the open hall
of thought i seem to see her royal form as erst i saw it come with
arm outstretch and love own light shine in her ey with lip
apart and flow lock and stamp upon her face the look of utter
tender that she alon could wear ay still after all the year i
seem to see her come as erst she came and still i wake to know her an
unutter lie
and thu on dai she came she had fled in hast she said from some
great council summon concern the war of antoni in syria and
she came as she had left the council in all her robe of state the
sceptr in her hand and on her brow the uru diadem of gold there she
sat befor me laugh for weari of them she had told the envoi
to whom she gave audienc in the council that she wa call from their
presenc by a sudden messag come from rome and the jest seem merri
to her suddenli she rose took the diadem from her brow and set it
on my hair and on my shoulder her royal mantl and in my hand the
sceptr and bow the knee befor me then laugh again she kiss
me on the lip and said i wa inde her king but rememb how
i had been crown in the hall of abouthi and rememb also that
wreath of rose of which the odour haunt me yet i rose pale with
wrath and cast the trinket from me ask how she dare to mock
meher cage bird and i think there wa that about me which startl
her for she fell back
nai harmachi she said be not wroth how knowest thou that i mock
thee how knowest thou that thou shalt not be pharaoh in fact and deed
what meanest thou i said wilt thou then wed me befor egypt how
els can i be pharaoh now
she cast down her ey perchanc love it is in my mind to wed thee
she said gentli listen she went on thou growest pale here in
thi prison and thou dost eat littl gainsai me not i know it from
the slave i have kept thee here harmachi for thy own sake that is
so dear to me and for thy own sake and thy honour sake thou must
still seem to be my prison els wouldst thou be shame and slainai
murder secretli but i can meet thee here no more therefor tomorrow
i shall free thee in all save in the name and thou shalt onc more be
seen at court as my astronom and i will give thi reasonthat thou
hast clear thyself and moreov that thy auguri as regard the
war have been auguri of trutha inde thei have though for
thi i have no caus to thank thee see that thou didst suit thy
propheci to fit thy caus now farewel for i must return to those
heavybrow ambassador and grow not so sudden wroth harmachi for
who know what mai come to pass betwixt thee and me
and with a littl nod she went leav it on my mind that she had it
in her heart to wed me openli and of a truth i believ that at thi
hour such wa her thought for if she love me not still she held me
dear and as yet she had not weari of me
on the morrow cleopatra came not but charmion camecharmion whom
i had not seen sinc that fatal night of ruin she enter and stood
befor me with pale face and downcast ey and her first word were
word of bitter
pardon me she said in her gentl voic in that i dare to come to
thee in cleopatra place thy joi is not delai for long for thou
shalt see her present
i shrank at her word as well i might and see her vantag she
seiz it
i come harmachisroy no morei come to sai that thou art free
thou art free to face thine own infami and see it thrown back from
everi ey which trust thee as shadow ar from water i come to tell
thee that the great plotth plot of twenti year and morei at it
utter end none have been slain inde unless it is sepa who ha
vanish but all the leader have been seiz and put in chain or
driven from the land and their parti is broken and scatter the storm
ha melt befor it burst egypt is lost and lost for ever for her
last hope is gone no longer mai she strugglenow for all time she
must bow her neck to the yoke and bare her back to the rod of the
oppressor
i groan aloud ala i wa betrai i said paulu betrai us
thou wast betrai nai thou thyself wast the betray how came it
that thou didst not slai cleopatra when thou wast alon with her speak
thou forsworn
she drug me i said again
o harmachi answer the pitiless girl how low art thou fallen from
that princ whom onc i knewthou who dost not scorn to be a liar
yea thou wast druggeddrug with a lovephiltr yea thou didst
sell egypt and thy caus for the price of a wanton kiss thou sorrow
and thou shame she went on point her finger at me and lift her
ey to my face thou scornthou outcastand thou contempt deni
if it thou canst ay shrink from meknow what thou art well mayst
thou shrink crawl to cleopatra feet and kiss her sandal till such
time as it pleas her to trampl thee in thy kindr dirt but from all
honest folk shrinkshrink
my soul quiver beneath the lash of her bitter scorn and hate but i
had no word to answer
how come it i said at last in a heavi voic that thou too art
not betrai but art still here to taunt me thou who onc didst

that same night cleopatra summon me to her privat chamber i went
and found her much troubl in mind never befor had i seen her so
deepli move she wa alon and like some trap lioness walk to
and fro across the marbl floor while thought chase thought across her
mind each as cloud scud over the sea for a moment cast it
shadow in her deep ey
so thou art come harmachi she said rest for a while as she
took my hand counsel me for never did i need counsel more oh what
dai have the god measur out to medai restless as the ocean i
have known no peac from childhood up and it seem none shall i know
scarc by a veri littl have i escap thy dagger point harmachi
when thi new troubl that like a storm ha gather beneath the
horizon rim suddenli burst over me didst mark that tigerish fop
well should i love to trap him how soft he spoke ay he pur like
a cat and all the time he stretch hi claw didst hear the letter
too it ha an ugli sound i know thi antoni when i wa but a child
bud into womanhood i saw him but my ey were ever quick and i
took hi measur half hercul and half a fool with a dash of geniu
vein hi folli through easili led by those who enter at the gate of
hi voluptu sens but if cross an iron foe true to hi friend
if inde he love them and ofttim fals to hi own interest
gener hardi and in advers a man of virtu in prosper a sot
and a slave to woman that is antoni how deal with such a man
whom fate and opportun despit himself have set on the crest of
fortun wave on dai it will overwhelm him but till that dai he
sweep across the world and laugh at those who drown
antoni is but a man i answer and a man with mani foe and be
but a man he can be overthrown
ay he can be overthrown but he is on of three harmachi now that
cassiu hath gone where all fool go rome ha thrown out a hydra head
crush on and anoth hiss in thy face there lepidu and with
him that young octavianu whose cold ey mai yet with a smile of
triumph look on the murder form of empti worthless lepidu of
antoni and of cleopatra if i go not to cilicia mark thou antoni will
knit up a peac with these parthian and take the tale thei tell
of me for truthand inde there is truth in themwil fall with all
hi forc on egypt and how then
how then why then well drum him back to rome
ah thou sayest so and perchanc harmachi had i not won that game
we plai togeth some twelv dai gone thou be pharaoh mightest
well have done thi thing for round thy throne old egypt would have
gather but egypt love not me nor my greek blood and i have but now
scatter that great plot of thine in which half the land wa mesh
will these men then aris to succour me were egypt true to me i
could inde hold my own against all the forc that rome mai bring
but egypt hate me and had as lief be rule by the roman as the greek
still i might make defenc had i the gold for with monei soldier
can be bought to feed the maw of mercenari battl but i have none my
treasuri ar dry and though there is wealth in the land yet debt
perplex me these war have brought me ruin and i know not how to
find a talent perchanc harmachi thou who art by hereditari right
priest of the pyramid and she drew near and look me in the ey
perchanc if long descend rumour doe not lie thou canst tell me
where i can touch the gold to save thy land from ruin and thy love from
the grasp of antoni sai is it so
i thought a while and then i answer
and if such a tale were true and if i could show thee treasur store
by the mighti pharaoh of the most faroff ag against the need of
khem how can i know that thou wouldst inde make us of that wealth to
those good end
is there then a treasur she ask curious nai fret me not
harmachi for of a truth the veri name of gold at thi time of want is
like the sight of water in the desert
i believ i said that there is such a treasur though i myself
have never seen it but i know thi that if it still lie in the place
where it wa set it is becaus so heavi a curs will rest upon him who
shall lai hand on it wickedli and for selfish end that none of those
pharaoh to whom it ha been shown have dare to touch it howev sore
their need
so she said thei were cowardli aforetim or els their need wa
not great wilt thou show me thi treasur then harmachi
perhap i answer i will show it to thee if it still be there
when thou hast sworn that thou wilt us it to defend egypt from thi
roman antoni and for the welfar of her peopl

that if thou showest me thi great treasur i will defi antoni and send
delliu back to cilicia with sharper word than those he brought ye
ill do more harmachi so soon as mai be i will take thee to husband
befor all the world and thou thyself shalt carri out thy plan and
beat off the roman eagl
thu she spoke gaze at me with truth earnest ey i believ
her and for the first time sinc my fall wa for a moment happi
think that all wa not lost to me and that with cleopatra whom i
love thu madli i might yet win my place and power back
swear it cleopatra i said
i swear belov and thu i seal my oath and she kiss me on the
forehead and i too kiss her and we talk of what we would do when
we were wed and how we should overcom the roman
and thu i wa again beguil though i believ that had it not been
for the jealou anger of charmionwhich as shall be seen wa ever
urg her forward to fresh deed of shamecleopatra would have wed
me and broken with the roman and inde in the issu it had been
better for her and egypt
we sat far into the night and i reveal to her somewhat of that
ancient secret of the mighti treasur hid beneath the mass of her
thither it wa agre we should go on the morrow and the second
night from now attempt it search so earli on the next dai a boat
wa secretli made readi and cleopatra enter it veil as an egyptian
ladi about to make a pilgrimag to the templ of horemkhu and i also
enter cloak as a pilgrim and with us ten of her most trust
servant disguis as sailor but charmion went not with us we sail
with a fair wind from the canop mouth of the nile and that night
push on with the moon we reach sai at midnight and here rest
for a while at dawn we onc more loos our craft and all that dai
sail swiftli till at last at the third hour from the sunset we
came in sight of the light of that fortress which is call babylon
here on the opposit bank of the river we moor our ship safe in a
bed of reed
then on foot and secretli we set out for the pyramid which were at
a distanc of two leagu cleopatra i and on trust eunuch for
we left the other servant with the boat onli i caught an ass for
cleopatra to ride that wa wander in a till field and threw a
cloak upon it she sat on it and i led the ass by path i knew the
eunuch follow us on foot and within littl more than an hour
have gain the great causewai we saw the mighti pyramid tower up
through the moonlit air and aw us to silenc we pass on in utter
silenc through the haunt citi of the dead for all around us stood
the solemn tomb till at length we climb the rocki hill and stood in
the deep shadow of khufu khut the splendid throne of khufu
of a truth whisper cleopatra as she gaze up the dazzl
marbl slope abov her everywher blazon over with a million mystic
charactersof a truth there were god rule in khem in those dai
and not men thi place is sad as deathai and as mighti and far from
man is it here that we must enter

i led the wai through a thousand ancient tomb till we stood in the
shadow of ur the great and gaze at hi red heavenpierc mass
is it here that we must enter she whisper onc again
nai i answer it is not here pass on
we pass on through mani more tomb till we stood in the shadow of
her and cleopatra gaze astonish at it polish beauti which
for thousand of year night by night had mirror back the moon and
at the black girdl of ethiopian stone that circl it base about for
thi is the most beauti of all pyramid
the upper now known as the third pyramideditor
is it that we must enter she said
i answer it is here
we pass round between the templ of the worship of hi divin majesti
menkaura the osirian and in the base of the pyramid till we came
to the north side here in the centr is grave the name of pharaoh
menkaura who built the pyramid to be hi tomb and store hi treasur
in it against the need of khem
if the treasur still remain i said to cleopatra as it remain in
the dai of my greatgreatgrandfath who wa priest of thi
pyramid befor me it is hid deep in the womb of the mass befor thee
cleopatra nor can it be come by without toil danger and terror of
mind art thou prepar to enterfor thou thyself must enter and must
judg
canst thou not go in with the eunuch harmachi and bring the treasur
forth she said for a littl her courag began to fail her
nai cleopatra i answer not even for thee and for the weal of
egypt can i do thi thing for of all sin it would be the greatest
sin but it is law for me to do thi i as hereditari holder of the
secret mai upon demand show to the rule monarch of khem the place
where the treasur li and show also the warn that is written and
if on see and read the pharaoh deem that the need of khem is so
sore and strait that it is law for him to brave the curs of the dead
and draw forth the treasur it is well for on hi head must rest the
weight of thi dread deed three monarchsso sai the record that i
have readhav thu dare to enter in the time of need thei were the
divin queen hatshepsu that wonder known to the god alon her divin
brother tahutim menkheperra and the divin rames miamen but of
these three majesti not on when thei saw dare to touch for though
sharp their need it wa not great enough to consecr the act
so fear lest the curs should fall upon them thei went henc
sorrow
she thought a littl till at last her spirit overcam her fear
at the least i will see with mine own ey she said
it is well i answer then stone have been pile up by me and
the eunuch who wa with us on a certain spot at the base of the pyramid
to somewhat more than the height of a man i climb on them and
search for the secret mark no larger than a leaf i found it with
some troubl for the weather and the rub of the windstir sand
had worn even the ethiopian stone have found it i press on it with
all my strength in a certain fashion even after the laps of mani year
the stone swung round show a littl open through which a man
might scarc creep as it swung a mighti bat white in colour as
though with unreckon ag and such as i had never seen befor for
big for hi measur wa the measur of a hawk flew forth and for a
moment hover over cleopatra then sail slowli up and up in circl
till at last he wa lost in the bright light of the moon
but cleopatra utter a cry of terror and the eunuch who wa watch
fell down in fear believ it to be the guardian spirit of the
pyramid and i too fear though i said noth for even now i
believ that it wa the spirit of menkaura the osirian who take
the form of a bat flew forth from hi holi hous in warn
i wait a while till the foul air should clear from the passag then
i drew out the lamp kindl them and pass them to the number
of three into the entranc of the passag thi done i went to the
eunuch and take him asid i swore him by the live spirit of him
who sleep at abouthi that he should not reveal those thing which he
wa about to see
thi he swore trembl sore for he wa veri much afraid nor
inde did he reveal them
thi done i clamber through the open take with me a coil of
rope which i wound around my middl and beckon to cleopatra to come
make fast the skirt of her robe she came and i drew her through the
open so that at length she stood behind me in the passag which
is line with slab of granit after her came the eunuch and he also
stood in the passag then have taken counsel of the plan of the
passag that i had brought with me and which in sign that none but
the initi can read wa copi from those ancient write that had
come down to me through oneandforti gener of my predecessor
the priest of thi pyramid of her and of the worship of the templ
of the divin menkaura the osirian i led the wai through that
darksom place toward the utter silenc of the tomb guid by the
feebl light of our lamp we pass down the steep inclin gasp in
the heat and the thick stagnat air present we had left the region
of the masonri and were slip down a galleri hewn in the live rock
for twenti pace or more it ran steepli then it slope lessen and
shortli we found ourselv in a chamber paint white so low that i
be tall had scarc room to stand but in length four pace and
in breadth three and case throughout with sculptur panel here
cleopatra sank upon the floor and rest awhil overcom by the heat
and the utter dark
rise i said we must not linger here or we faint
so she rose and pass hand in hand through that chamber we found
ourselv face to face with a mighti door of granit let down from the
roof in groov onc more i took counsel of the plan press with my
foot upon a certain stone and wait then suddenli and softli i know
not by what mean the mass heav itself from it bed of live rock
we pass beneath and found ourselv face to face with a second door
of granit again i press on a certain spot and thi door swung wide
of itself and we went through to find ourselv face to face with a
third door yet more mighti than the two through which we had won our
wai follow the secret plan i struck thi door with my foot upon a
certain spot and it sank slowli as though at a word of magic till it
head wa level with the floor of rock we cross and gain anoth
passag which descend gentli for a length of fourteen pace led
us into a great chamber pave with black marbl more than nine cubit
high by nine cubit broad and thirti cubit long in thi marbl floor
wa sunk a great sarcophagu of granit and on it lid were grave the
name and titl of the queen of menkaura in thi chamber too the air
wa purer though i know not by what mean it came thither
is the treasur here gasp cleopatra
nai i answer follow me and i led the wai to a galleri which
we enter through an open in the floor of the great chamber it had
been close by a trapdoor of stone but the door wa open creep
along thi shaft or passag for some ten pace we came at length to a
well seven cubit in depth make fast on end of the rope that i
had brought about my bodi and the other to a ring in the rock i
wa lower hold the lamp in my hand till i stood in the last
restingplac of the divin menkaura then the rope wa drawn up and
cleopatra be made fast to it wa let down by the eunuch and i
receiv her in my arm but i bade the eunuch sore against hi will
sinc he fear to be left alon await our return at the mouth of the
shaft for it wa not law that he should enter whither we went
chapter xi
of the tomb of the divin menkaura of the write on the breast of

solemn of that holi place seem to crush us abov us cubit over
cubit in it mighti measur the pyramid tower up to heaven and wa
kiss of the night air but we were deep in the bowel of the rock
beneath it base we were alon with the dead whose rest we were about
to break and no sound of the murmur air and no sight of life came
to dull the aw edg of solitud i gaze on the sarcophagu it
heavi lid had been lift and rest at it side and around it the dust
of ag had gather thick
see i whisper point to a write daub with pigment upon the
wall in the sacr symbol of ancient time
read it harmachi answer cleopatra in the same low voic for i

visit thi sepulchr but though great my need and bold my heart
i dare not face the curs of menkaura judg o thou who shalt come
after me and if thy soul is pure and khem be utterli distress take

where then is the treasur she whisper is that sphinxfac of
gold
even there i answer point to the sarcophagu draw near and
see
and she took my hand and drew near
the cover wa off but the paint coffin of the pharaoh lai in the
depth of the sarcophagu we climb the sphinx then i blew the dust
from the coffin with my breath and read that which wa written on it
lid and thi wa written
pharaoh menkaura the child of heaven

pharaoh menkaura who didst lie beneath the heart of nout
nout thy mother wrap thee in the spell of her holi name

nout thy mother breath on thy foe and utterli destroi them
o pharaoh menkaura who livest for ever
where then is the treasur she ask again here inde is the
bodi of the divin menkaura but the flesh even of pharaoh is not
gold and if the face of thi sphinx be gold how mai we move it
for answer i bade her stand upon the sphinx and grasp the upper part of
the coffin while i grasp it foot then at my word we lift and
the lid of the case which wa not fix came awai and we set it upon
the floor and there in the case wa the mummi of pharaoh as it
had been laid three thousand year befor it wa a larg mummi and
somewhat ungainli nor wa it adorn with a gild mask as is the
fashion of our dai for the head wa wrap in cloth yellow with ag
which were made fast with pink flaxen bandag under which were push

throne behold i menkaura the osirian have in the dai of my life
been warn of a dream that a time will come when khem shall fear to
fall into the hand of stranger and her monarch shall have great need
of treasur wherewith to furnish armi to drive the barbarian back
have out of my wisdom done thi thing for it have pleas the
protect god to give me wealth beyond ani pharaoh who ha been sinc

and ass thousand of measur of corn and hundr of measur of
gold and gem thi wealth i have us sparingli and that which
remain i have barter for preciou stoneseven for emerald the most
beauti and largest that ar in the world these stone then i have
store up against that dai of the need of khem but becaus as there
have been so there shall be those who do wickedli on the earth and
who in the lust of gain might seiz thi wealth that i have store
and put it to their us behold thou unborn on who in the ful
of time shalt stand abov me and read thi that i have caus to

and to the end of the keep of thi secret i menkaura have set up
a templ of my worship which i have built upon the eastern side of
thi my hous of death it shall be made known from time to time to the
hereditari high priest of thi my templ and if ani high priest that

she bent her head in thought
i fear to do thi thing she said present let us henc
it is well i said with a lighten of the heart and bent down to
lift the wooden lid for i too fear
and yet what said the write of the divin menkaurait wa
emerald wa it not and emerald ar now so rare and hard to come by
ever did i love emerald and i can never find them without a flaw
it is not a matter of what thou dost love cleopatra i said it is a
matter of the need of khem and of the secret mean of thy heart which
thou alon canst know
ay sure harmachi sure and is not the need of egypt great
there is no gold in the treasuri and how can i defi the roman if i have
no gold and have i not sworn to thee that i will wed thee and defi the
roman and do i not swear it againy even in thi solemn hour with
my hand upon dead pharaoh heart why here is that occas of which
the divin menkaura dream thou seest it is so for els hatshepsu
or rames or some other pharaoh had drawn forth the gem but no thei
left them to come to thi hour becaus the time wa not yet come now it
must be come for if i take not the gem the roman will sure seiz on
egypt and then there will be no pharaoh to whom the secret mai be
told nai let us awai with fear and to the work why dost look so
frighten have pure heart there is naught to fear harmachi
even as thou wilt i said again it is for thee to judg sinc if
thou judgest fals on thee will sure fall the curs from which there

a shadow yonder in the dark methought that it move toward us and
then straightwai vanish let us be go didst thou see naught
i saw noth cleopatra but mayhap it wa the spirit of the divin
menkaura for the spirit ever hover round it mortal tenement let us
then be go i shall be right glad to go
she made as though to start then turn back again and spoke onc more
it wa naughtnaught but the mind that in such a hous of horror
bodi forth those shadowi form of fear it dread to see nai i must
look upon these emerald inde if i die i must look cometo the
work and stoop she with her own hand lift from the tomb on
of the four alabast jar each seal with the graven like of the
head of the protect god that held the holi heart and entrail of
the divin menkaura but noth wa found in these jar save onli
what should be there
then togeth we mount on the sphinx and with toil drew forth the
bodi of the divin pharaoh lai it on the ground now cleopatra took
my dagger and with it cut loos the bandag which held the wrap
in their place and the lotusflow that had been set in them by
love hand three thousand year befor fell down upon the pavement
then we search and found the end of the outer bandag which wa fix
in at the hinder part of the neck thi we cut loos for it wa glu
fast thi done we began to unrol the wrap of the holi corps
set my shoulder against the sarcophagu i sat upon the rocki
floor the bodi rest on my knee and as i turn it cleopatra
unwound the cloth and awesom wa the task present someth fell
out it wa the sceptr of the pharaoh fashion of gold and at it
end wa a pomegran cut from a singl emerald
cleopatra seiz the sceptr and gaze on it in silenc then onc
more we went on with our dread busi and ever as we unwound other
ornament of gold such as ar buri with pharaoh fell from the
wrappingscollar and bracelet model of sistra an inlaid ax and
an imag of the holi osiri and of the holi khem at length all the
bandag were unwound and beneath we found a cover of coarsest
linen for in those veri ancient dai the craftsmen were not so skill
in matter pertain to the embalm of the bodi as thei ar now and
on the linen wa written in an oval menkaura royal son of the sun
we could in no wise loosen thi linen it held so firm on to the bodi
therefor faint with the great heat choke with mummi dust and the
odour of spice and trembl with fear of our unholi task wrought
in that most lonesom and holi place we laid the bodi down and rip
awai the last cover with the knife first we clear pharaoh head
and now the face that no man had gaze on for three thousand year wa
open to our view it wa a great face with a bold brow yet crown
with the royal uru beneath which the white lock stain yellow by
the spice fell in long straight wisp not the cold stamp of death
and not the slow flight of three thousand year had found power to mar
the digniti of those shrunken featur we gaze on them and then made
bold with fear strip the cover from the bodi there at last it
lai befor us stiff yellow and dread to see and on the left side
abov the thigh wa the cut through which the embalm had done their
work but it wa sewn up so deftli that we could scarc find the mark
the gem ar within i whisper for i felt that the bodi wa veri
heavi now if thy heart fail thee not thou must make an entri to
thi poor hous of clai that onc wa pharaoh and i gave her the
daggerth same dagger which had drunk the life of paulu
it is too late to doubt she answer lift her white beauteou
face and fix her blue ey all big with terror upon my own she took
the dagger and with set teeth the queen of thi dai plung it into the
dead breast of the pharaoh of three thousand year ago and even as she
did so there came a groan sound from the open to the shaft where
we had left the eunuch we leapt to our feet but heard no more and the
lamplight still stream down through the open
it is noth i said let us make an end
then with much toil we hack and rent the hard flesh open and as we
did so i heard the knife point grate upon the gem within
cleopatra plung her hand into the dead breast and drew forth somewhat
she held it to the light and gave a littl cry for from the dark
of pharaoh heart there flash into light and life the most beauteou
emerald that ever man beheld it wa perfect in colour veri larg
without a flaw and fashion to a scarabu form and on the under side
wa an oval inscrib with the divin name of menkaura son of the
sun
again again and yet again she plung in her hand and drew emerald
from pharaoh breast bed there in spice some were fashion and
some were not but all were perfect in colour without a flaw and in
valu priceless again and again she plung her white hand into that
dread breast till at length all were found and there were on hundr
and forti and eight of such gem as ar not known in the world the last
time that she search she brought forth not emerald inde but two
great pearl wrap in linen such as never have been seen and of
these pearl more hereaft
so it wa done and all the mighti treasur lai glitter in a heap
befor us there it lai and there too lai the regalia of gold the
spice and sicklysc wrap and the torn bodi of whitehair
pharaoh menkaura the osirian the ever live in amenti
we rose and a great aw fell upon us now that the deed wa done and
our heart were no more upborn by the rage of searchso great an aw
inde that we could not speak i made a sign to cleopatra she grasp
the head of pharaoh and i grasp hi feet and togeth we lift him
climb the sphinx and place him onc more within hi coffin i pile
the torn mummi cloth over him and on them laid the lid of the coffin
and now we gather up the great gem and such of the ornament as
might be carri with eas and i hid them as mani as i could in the
fold of my robe those that were left cleopatra hid upon her breast
heavili laden with the priceless treasur we gave on last look at
the solemn place at the sarcophagu and the sphinx on which it rest
whose gleam face of calm seem to mock us with it everlast smile
of wisdom then we turn and went from the tomb
at the shaft we halt i call to the eunuch who stai abov and
methought a faint mock laugh answer me too smitten with terror to
call again and fear that should we delai cleopatra would certainli
swoon i seiz the rope and be strong and quick mount by it and
gain the passag there burnt the lamp but the eunuch i saw not
think sure that he wa a littl wai down the passag and
slepta in truth he didi bade cleopatra make the rope fast about
her middl and with much labour drew her up then have rest
awhil we move with the lamp to seek for the eunuch

shrill sound

that draught of muddi water wa sweeter than all the choicest wine of
alexandria also we wash the mummi dust and grime from our hand
and brow and made us clean as she bath her neck stoop over the
water on of the great emerald slip from cleopatra breast and
fell into the canal and it wa but by chanc that at length i found

make all sail sai that we had left the eunuch to sojourn a while
behind us as in truth we had so we sail have first hidden awai
the gem and such of the ornament of gold as we could bring to the
boat
we spent four dai and more in come to alexandria for the wind
wa for the most part against us and thei were happi dai at first
inde cleopatra wa somewhat silent and heavi at heart for what she
had seen and felt in the womb of the pyramid weigh her down but soon
her imperi spirit awok and shook the burden from her breast and she
becam herself againnow gai now learn now love and now cold

defenc against the roman which now we had the mean to carri out and
she approv them sweetli sai that what seem good to me wa good

the word that thou ha brought across the sea methink thei had been
better fit to the ear of some petti halftam princ than to those
of egypt queen therefor we have number the legion that we can
gather and the trirem and the gallei wherewith we mai breast the
sea and the monei which shall bui us all thing want to our war
and we find thi that though antoni be strong yet ha egypt naught to
fear from the strength of antoni
she paus and a murmur of applaus of her high word ran down the
hall onli delliu stretch out hi hand as though to push them back
then came the end

guiltless of those charg against us that have come to the ear of

chapter xiii
of the reproach of harmachi of the struggl of harmachi with the
guard of the blow of brennu and of the secret speech of cleopatra
and at length all be gone i too turn to go when a eunuch
struck me on the shoulder and roughli bade me wait on the presenc of
the queen an hour past thi fellow would have crawl to me on hi
knee but he had heard and now he treat meso brutish is the natur
of such slavesa the world treat the fallen with scorn for to come
low after be great is to learn all shame unhappi therefor ar the
great for thei mai fall
i turn upon the slave with so fierc a word that curlik he sprang
behind me then i pass on to the alabast hall and wa admit by
the guard in the centr of the hall near the fountain sat cleopatra
and with her were charmion and the greek girl ira and merira and other
of her waitingladi go she said to these i would speak with my
astrolog so thei went and left us face to face
stand thou there she said lift her ey for the first time come
not nigh me harmachi i trust thee not perchanc thou hast found
anoth dagger now what hast thou to sai by what right didst thou
dare to break in upon my talk with the roman
i felt the blood rush through me like a storm bitter and burn
anger took hold of my heart what hast thou to sai cleopatra
i answer boldli where is thy vow sworn on the dead heart of
menkaura the everliv where now thy challeng to thi roman
antoni where thy oath that thou wouldest call me husband in the face
of egypt and i choke and ceas
well doth it becom harmachi who never wa forsworn to speak to me
of oath she said in bitter mockeri and yet o thou most pure priest
of isi and yet o thou most faith friend who never didst betrai
thy friend and yet o thou most steadfast honour and upright
man who never barter thy birthright thy countri and thy caus for
the price of a woman pass lovebi what token knowest thou that my
word is void
i will not answer thy taunt cleopatra i said hold back my heart
as best i might for i have earn them all though not from thee by
thi token then i know it thou goest to visit antoni thou goest as
said that roman knave trick in thy best attir to feast with him
whom thou shouldst give to vultur for their feast perhap for
aught i know thou art about to squander those treasur that thou hast
filch from the bodi of menkaura those treasur store against the
need of egypt upon wanton revel which shall complet the shame of
egypt by these thing then i know that thou art forsworn and i who
love thee believ thee trick and by thi also that thou who
didst but yesternight swear to wed me dost todai cover me with taunt
and even befor that roman put me to an open shame
to wed thee and i did swear to wed thee well and what is marriag
is it the union of the heart that bond beauti as gossam and than
gossam more light which bind soul to soul as thei float through the
dreami night of passion a bond to be perchanc melt in the dew of
dawn or is it the iron link of enforc unchang union wherebi if
sink the on the other must be drag beneath the sea of circumst
there like a punish slave to perish of unavoid corrupt
marriag i to marri i to forget freedom and court the worst
slaveri of our sex which by the selfish will of man the stronger
still bind us to a bed grown hate and enforc a servic that love
mayhap no longer hallow of what us then to be a queen if therebi i
mai not escap the evil of the meanli born mark thou harmachi woman
be grown hath two ill to feardeath and marriag and of these
twain is marriag the more vile for in death we mai find rest but in
marriag should it fail us we must find hell nai be abov the
breath of common slander that envious would blast those who of
true virtu will not consent to stretch affect link i love
harmachi but i marri not
refer to the roman custom of chain a live felon
to the bodi of on alreadi deadeditor
and yesternight cleopatra thou didst swear that thou wouldst wed me
and call me to thy side befor the face of egypt
and yesternight harmachi the red ring round the moon mark the
come of the storm and yet the dai is fair but who know that the
tempest mai not break tomorrow who know that i have not chosen the
easier path to save egypt from the roman who know harmachi that
thou shalt not still call me wife
then i no longer could bear her falsehood for i saw that she but plai
with me and so i spoke that which wa in my heart
cleopatra i cri thou didst swear to protect egypt and thou
art about to betrai egypt to the roman thou didst swear to us the
treasur that i reveal to thee for the servic of egypt and thou art
about to us them to be her mean of shameto fashion them as fetter
for her wrist thou didst swear to wed me who love thee and for thee
gave all and thou dost mock me and reject me therefor i saywith the
voic of the dread god i sai itthat on thee shall fall the curs
of menkaura whom thou hast rob inde let me go henc and work
out my fate let me go o thou fair shame thou live lie whom i have
love to my doom and who hast brought upon me the last curs of doom
let me hide myself and see thy face no more
she rose in her wrath and she wa terribl to see
let thee go to stir up evil against me nai harmachi thou shalt not

came to joppa on the even of the second dai thenc we sail
slowli with contrari wind up the coast of syria make csarea and
ptolemai and tyru and berytu and past lebanon white brow crown
with hi crest of cedar on to heraclea and across the gulf of issu to
the mouth of cydnu and ever as we journei the strong breath of the
sea brought back my health till at length save for a line of white
upon my head where the sword had fallen i wa almost as i had been
and on night as we drew near cydnu while brennu and i sat alon
togeth on the deck hi ey fell upon the white mark hi sword had
made and he swore a great oath by hi heathen god an thou hadst
di lad he said methink i could never again have held up my head
ah that wa a coward stroke and i am shame to think that it wa i who

chapter xv
of the feast of cleopatra of the melt of the pearl of the sai of
harmachi and of cleopatra vow of love
on the third night the feast wa onc more prepar in the hall of the
great hous that had been set asid to the us of cleopatra and on thi
night it splendour wa greater even than on the night befor for the
twelv couch that were set about the tabl were emboss with gold
and those of cleopatra and antoni were of gold set with jewel the
dish also were all of gold set with jewel the wall were hung with
purpl cloth sewn with gold and on the floor cover with a net of
gold fresh rose were strewn ankledeep that as the slave trod them
sent up their perfum onc again i wa bidden to stand with charmion
and ira and merira behind the couch of cleopatra and like a slave
from time to time call out the hour as thei flew and there be no

time sinc i could not bear that shame for though i would not yet
believ what charmion told methat cleopatra wa about to becom the
love of antonyyet i could no more endur thi ignomini and tortur
for from cleopatra now i had no word save such as a queen speak to her
slave and methink it gave her dark heart pleasur to torment me
thu it came to pass that i the pharaoh crown of khem stood among
eunuch and waitingwomen behind the couch of egypt queen while the
feast went merrili and the winecup pass and ever antoni sat hi
ey fix upon the face of cleopatra who from time to time let her
deep glanc lose itself in hi and then for a littl while their
talk di awai for he told her tale of war and of deed that he had
doneai and lovejest such as ar not meet for the ear of women but
she took offenc at noth rather fall into hi humour she would
cap hi stori with other of a finer wit but not less shameless
at length the rich meal be finish antoni gaze at the splendour
around him
tell me then most love egypt he said ar the sand of nile
compact of gold that thou canst night by night thu squander the
ransom of a king upon a singl feast whenc come thi untold wealth
i bethought me of the tomb of the divin menkaura whose holi treasur
wa thu wickedli wast and look up so that cleopatra ey caught
mine but read my thought she frown heavili
why nobl antoni she said sure it is noth in egypt we have
our secret and know whenc to conjur rich at our need sai what is
the valu of thi golden servic and of the meat and drink that have
been set befor us
he cast hi ey about and hazard a guess
mayb a thousand sestertia
about eight thousand pound of english moneyeditor
thou hast underst it by half nobl antoni but such as it is i
will give it thee and those with thee as a free token of my friendship
and more will i show thee now i myself will eat and drink ten thousand
sestertia at a draught
that cannot be fair egypt
she laugh and bade a slave bring her white vinegar in a glass when
it wa brought she set it befor her and laugh again while antoni
rise from hi couch drew near and set himself at her side and all
the compani leant forward to see what she would do and thi she did
she took from her ear on of those great pearl which last of all had
been drawn from the bodi of the divin pharaoh and befor ani could
guess her purpos she let it fall into the vinegar then came silenc
the silenc of wonder and slowli the priceless pearl melt in the
strong acid when it wa melt she lift the glass and shook it then
drank the vinegar to the last drop
more vinegar slave she cri my meal is but half finish and
she drew forth the second pearl
by bacchu no that shalt thou not cri antoni snatch at her

chapter xvi
of the plan of charmion of the confess of charmion and of the
answer of harmachi
for some while i sat with bow head and the last bitter of shame
sank into my soul thi then wa the end for thi i had betrai my
oath for thi i had told the secret of the pyramid for thi i had
lost my crown my honour and perchanc my hope of heaven could there
be anoth man in the wide world so steep in sorrow as i wa that
night sure not on where should i turn what could i do and even
through the tempest of my torn heart the bitter voic of jealousi call
aloud for i love thi woman to whom i had given all and she at thi
momentsh wasah i could not bear to think of it and in my utter
agoni my heart burst in a river of tear such as ar terribl to weep
then charmion drew near me and i saw that she too wa weep
weep not harmachi she sob kneel at my side i cannot endur
to see thee weep oh why wouldst thou not be warn then hadst thou
been great and happi and not as now listen harmachi thou didst hear
what that fals and tigerish woman saidtomorrow she hand thee over
to the murder
it is well i gasp
nai it is not well harmachi give her not thi last triumph over
thee thou hast lost all save life but while life remain hope remain
also and with hope the chanc of vengeanc
ah i said start from my seat i had not thought of that ayth
chanc of vengeanc it would be sweet to be aveng
it would be sweet harmachi and yet thisveng is an arrow that
in fall oft pierc him who shot it myselfi know it and she
sigh but a truce to talk and grief there will be time for us twain
to griev if not to talk in all the heavi come year thou must
flybefor the come of the light must thou fly here is a plan
tomorrow er the dawn a gallei that but yesterdai came from
alexandria bear fruit and store sail thither again and it
captain is known to me but to thee he is not known now i will find
thee the garb of a syrian merchant and cloak thee as i know how and
furnish thee with a letter to the captain of the gallei he shall give
thee passag to alexandria for to him thou wilt seem but as a merchant
go on the busi of thy trade brennu is offic of the guard
tonight and brennu is a friend to me and thee perhap he will guess
somewhat or perhap he will not guess at the least the syrian
merchant shall safe pass the line what sayest thou
it is well i answer wearili littl do i reck the issu
rest thou then here harmachi while i make these matter readi
and harmachi griev not overmuch there ar other who should griev
more heavili than thou and she went leav me alon with my agoni
which rent me like a tortureb had it not been for that fierc desir
of vengeanc which from time to time flash across my torment mind
as the lightn over a midnight sea methink my reason had left me
in that dark hour at length i heard her footstep at the door and she
enter breath heavili for she bore a sack of cloth in her arm
it is well she said here is the garb with spare linen and
writingtablet and all thing need i have seen brennu also and
told him that a syrian merchant would pass the guard an hour befor the
dawn and though he made pretenc of sleep i think he understood for
he answer yawn that if thei but had the password antoni
fifti syrian merchant might go through about their law busi and
here is the letter to the captainth canst not mistak the gallei
for she is moor along to the righta small gallei paint black as
thou dost enter on the great quai and moreov the sailor make readi
for sail now i will wait here without while thou dost put off the
liveri of thy servic and arrai thyself
when she wa gone i tore off my gorgeou garment and spat upon them and
trod them on the ground then i put on the modest robe of a merchant
and bound the tablet round me on my feet the sandal of untan hide
and at my waist the knife when it wa done charmion enter onc again
and look on me
too much art thou still the royal harmachi she said see it must
be chang
then she took scissor from her tiringt and bid me be seat
she cut off my lock clip the hair close to the head next she
found stain of such sort as women us to make dark the ey and mix
them cunningli rub the stuff on my face and hand and on the white
mark in my hair where the sword of brennu had bitten to the bone
now thou art changedsomewhat for the wors harmachi she said
with a dreari laugh scarc myself should i know thee stai there is
on more thing and go to a chest of garment she drew thenc a
heavi bag of gold
take thou thi she said thou wilt have need of monei
i cannot take thy gold charmion
ye take it it wa sepa who gave it to me for the further of
our caus and therefor it is fit that thou shouldst spend it
moreov if i want monei doubtless antoni who is henceforth my
master will give me more he is much beholden to me and thi he know
well there wast not the preciou time in haggl oer the pelfnot
yet art thou all a merchant harmachi and without more word she
thrust the piec into the leather bag that hung across my shoulder
then she made fast the sack contain the spare garment and so
womanli thought wa she place in it an alabast jar of pigment
with which i might stain my counten afresh and take the
broider robe of my offic that i had cast off hid them in the secret
passag and so at last all wa made readi
is it time that i should go i ask
not yet a while be patient harmachi for but on littl hour more
must thou endur my presenc and then perchanc farewel for ever
i made a gestur signifi that thi wa no time for sharp word
forgiv me my quick tongu she said but from a salt spring bitter
water well be seat harmachi i have heavier word to speak to thee
befor thou goest
sai on i answer word howev heavi can move me no more
she stood befor me with fold hand and the lamplight shone upon her
beauteou face i notic idli how great wa it pallor and how wide
and dark were the ring about the deep black ey twice she lift her
white face and strove to speak twice her voic fail her and when at
last it came it wa in a hoars whisper
i cannot let thee go she saidi cannot let thee go unwit of the
truth
harmachi twa i who did betrai thee
i sprang to my feet an oath upon my lip but she caught me by the
hand
oh be seat she saidb seat and hear me then when thou hast
heart do to me as thou wilt listen from that evil moment when in
the presenc of thy uncl sepa for the second time i set ey upon thy
face i love theehow much thou canst littl guess think upon
thine own love for cleopatra and doubl it and doubl it again and
perchanc thou mayst come near to my love mighti sum i love thee
dai by dai i love thee more till in thee and for thee alon i seem
to live but thou wast coldthou wast wors than cold thou didst deal
with me not as a breath woman but rather as the instrument to an
enda a tool with which to grave thy fortun and then i sawy
long befor thou knewest it thyselfthi heart tide wa set strong
toward that ruinou shore whereon todai thy life is broken and at
last that night came that dread night when hid within the chamber
i saw thee cast my kerchief to the wind and with sweet word cherish
my royal rival gift thenoh thou knowestin my pain i betrai
the secret that thou wouldst not see and thou didst make a mock of me
harmachi oh the shame of itthou in thy foolish didst make a
mock of me i went thenc and within me were rise all the torment
which can tear a woman heart for now i wa sure that thou didst love
cleopatra ay and so mad wa i even that night i wa mind to betrai
thee but i thoughtnot yet not yet tomorrow he mai soften then
came the morrow and all wa readi for the burst of the great plot
that should make thee pharaoh and i too cameth dost rememberand
again thou didst put me awai when i spake to thee in parabl as
someth of littl wortha a thing too small to claim a moment
weighti thought and know that thi wa becausethough thou knewest
it notthou didst love cleopatra whom now thou must straightwai slai
i grew mad and a wick spirit enter into me possess me utterli
so that i wa myself no longer nor could control myself and becaus
thou hadst scorn me i did thi to my everlast shame and
sorrowi pass into cleopatra presenc and betrai thee and those
with thee and our holi caus sai that i had found a write which
thou hadst let fall and read all thi therein
i gasp and sat silent and gaze sadli at me she went on
when she understood how great wa the plot and how deep it root
cleopatra wa much troubl and at first she would have fled to sai
or taken ship and run for cypru but i show her that the wai were
bar then she said she would caus thee to be slain there in the
chamber and i left her so believ for at that hour i wa glad that
thou shouldst be slainai even if i wept out my heart upon thy grave
harmachi but what said i just nowveng is an arrow that oft
fall on him who loos it so it wa with me for between my go and
thy come cleopatra hatch a deeper plan she fear that to slai thee
would onli be to light a fiercer fire of revolt but she saw that to
bind thee to her and have left men awhil in doubt to show thee
faithless would strike the immin danger at it root and wither
it thi plot onc form be great she dare it doubt issu
andne i go on thou knowest harmachi how she won and thu the
shaft of vengeanc that i loos fell upon my own head for on the
morrow i knew that i had sin for naught that the burden of my
betray had been laid on the wretch paulu and that i had but ruin
the caus to which i wa sworn and given the man i love to the arm of
wanton egypt
she bow her head awhil and then as i spoke not onc more went on
let all my sin be told harmachi and then let justic come see now
thi thing happen half did cleopatra learn to love thee and deep in
her heart she bethought her of take thee to wed husband for the
sake of thi half love of her she spare the live of those in the plot
whom she had mesh bethink her that if she wed thee she might
us them and thee to draw the heart of egypt which love not her nor
ani ptolemi and then onc again she entrap thee and in thy folli
thou didst betrai to her the secret of the hidden wealth of egypt which
todai she squander to delight the luxuri antoni and of a truth
at that time she purpos to make good her oath and marri thee but on
the veri morn when delliu came for answer she sent for me and tell
me allfor my wit abov ani she hold at pricedemand of me my
judgment whether she should defi antoni and wed thee or whether she
should put the thought awai and come to antoni and inow mark thou all
my sini in my bitter jealousi rather than i would see her thy wed
wife and thou her love lord counsel her most strictli that
she should come to antoni well knowingfor i had had speech with
delliusthat if she came thi weak antoni would fall like a ripe fruit
at her feet as inde he ha fallen and but now i have shown thee
the issu of the scheme antoni love cleopatra and cleopatra love
antoni and thou art rob and matter have gone well for me who of
all women on the earth tonight am the wretchedest by far for when i
saw how thy heart broke but now my heart seem to break with thine
and i could no longer bear the burden of my evil deed but knew that i
must tell them and take my punish
and now harmachi i have no more to sai save that i thank thee for
thy courtesi in hearken and thi on thing i add driven by my great
love i have sin against thee unto death i have ruin thee i have
ruin khem and myself also i have ruin let death reward me slai
thou me harmachisi will gladli die upon thy sword ay and kiss it
blade slai thou me and go for if thou slayest me not myself i will
sure slai and she threw herself upon her knee lift her fair
breast toward me that i might smite her with my dagger and in my
bitter furi i wa mind to strike for abov all i thought how
when i wa fallen thi woman who herself wa my caus of shame had
scourg me with her whip of scorn but it is hard to slai a fair woman
and even as i lift my hand to strike i rememb that she had now
twice save my life
woman thou shameless woman i said aris i slai thee not who am
i that i should judg thy crime that with mine own doth overtop all
earthli judgment
slai me harmachi she moan slai me or i slai myself my burden
is too great for me to bear be not so deadli calm curs me and slai
what wa it that thou didst sai to me just now charmionthat as i had
sown so i must reap it is not law that thou shouldst slai thyself
it is not law that i thine equal in sin should slai thee becaus
through thee i sin as thou hast sown charmion so must thou
also reap base woman whose cruel jealousi ha brought all these woe
on me and egypt livel on and from year to year pluck the bitter
fruit of crime haunt be thy sleep by vision of thy outrag god
whose vengeanc await thee and me in their dim amenti haunt be thy
dai by memori of that man whom thy fierc love brought to shame and
ruin and by the sight of khem a prei to the insati cleopatra and a
slave to roman antoni
oh speak not thu harmachi thy word ar sharper than ani sword
and more sure if more slowli shall thei slai listen harmachi
and she grasp my robe when thou wast great and all power lai within
thy grasp thou didst reject me wilt reject me now that cleopatra hast
cast thee from hernow that thou art poor and shame and with no pillow
to thy head still am i fair and still i worship thee let me fly with
thee and make aton for my lifelong love or if thi be too great
a thing to ask let me be but as thy sister and thy servantthi veri
slave so that i mai still look upon thy face and share thy troubl
and minist to thee o harmachi let me but come and i will brave all
thing and endur all thing and noth but death himself shall stai
me from thy side for i do believ that the love that sank me to so low
a depth drag thee with me can yet lift me to an equal height and
thee with me

she gaze wildli upon my facesh stretch out her arm as though to
clasp me then in the agoni of her despair she cast herself at length
and grovel upon the ground
i took up the sack of cloth and the staff and gain the door and
as i pass it i threw on last glanc upon her there she lai with
arm outstretchedmor white than her white robesh dark hair
stream about her and her fair brow hidden in the dust
and thu i left her nor did i again set my ey upon her till nine long

began to hum a tune
farewel brennu thou honest man i answer and wa gone and as
i heard long afterward when on the morrow the hue and cry wa
rais becaus the murder could not find me though thei sought me
everywher to slai me brennu did me a servic for he swore that as
he kept hi watch alon an hour after midnight he saw me come and stand
upon the parapet of the roof that then i stretch out my robe
and thei becam wing on which i float up to heaven leav him
astonish and all those about the court lent ear to thi histori
believ in it becaus of the great fame of my magic and thei
wonder much what the marvel might portend the tale also travel
into egypt and did much to save my good name among those whom i had
betrai for the more ignor among them believ that i act not
of my will but of the will of the dread god who of their own purpos
waft me into heaven and thu to thi dai the sai run that when
harmachi come again egypt shall be free but ala harmachi come
no more onli cleopatra though she wa much afraid doubt her of the
tale and sent an arm vessel to search for the syrian merchant but
not to find him as shall be told
when i reach the gallei of which charmion had spoken i found her
about to sail and gave the write to the captain who con it
look on me curious but said noth
so i went aboard and immedi we drop swiftli down the river with
the current and have come to the mouth of the river unchalleng
though we pass mani vessel we put out to sea with a strong favour
wind that befor night freshen to a great gale then the sailor men
be much afraid would have put about and run for the mouth of cydnu
again but could not becaus of the wild of the sea all that night
it blew furious and by dawn our mast wa carri awai and we roll
helplessli in the trough of the great wave but i sat wrap in a
cloak littl heed and becaus i show no fear the sailor cri
out that i wa a wizard and sought to cast me into the sea but the
captain would not at dawn the wind slacken but er noon it onc more
blew in terribl furi and at the fourth hour from noon we came in sight
of the rocki coast of that cape in the island of cypru which is call
dinaretum where is a mountain name olympu and thitherward we
drift swiftli then when the sailor saw the terribl rock and how
the great wave that smote on them spout up in foam onc more thei
grew much afraid and cri out in their fear for see that i still
sat unmov thei swore that i certainli wa a wizard and came to
cast me forth as a sacrific to the god of the sea and thi time the
captain wa overrul and said noth therefor when thei came to
me i rose and defi them sai cast me forth if ye will but if ye
cast me forth ye shall perish
for in my heart i care littl have no more ani love of life
but rather a desir to die though i greatli fear to pass into the
presenc of my holi mother isi but my weari and sorrow at the
bitter of my lot overcam even thi heavi fear so that when be
mad as brute beast thei seiz me and lift me hurl me into the
rage water i did but utter on prayer to isi and made readi for
death but it wa fate that i should not die for when i rose to the
surfac of the water i saw a spar of wood float near me to which i
swam and clung and a great wave came and swept me ride as it were
upon the spar as when a boi i had learn to do in the water of the
nile past the bulwark of the gallei where the fiercefac sailor
cluster to see me drown and when thei saw me come mount on the
wave curs them as i came and saw too that the colour of my
face had changedfor the salt water had wash wai the pigment thei
shriek with fear and threw themselv down upon the deck and within a
veri littl while as i rode toward the rocki coast a great wave pour
into the vessel that roll broadsid on and press her down into the
deep whenc she rose no more
so she sank with all her crew and in that same storm also sank the
gallei which cleopatra had sent to search for the syrian merchant thu
all trace of me were lost and of a sureti she believ that i wa
dead
but i rode on toward the shore the wind shriek and the salt wave
lash my face as alon with the tempest i rush upon my wai while
the seabird scream about my head i felt no fear but rather a wild
uplift of the heart and in the stress of my immin peril the love
of life seem to waken again and so i plung and drift now toss
high toward the lower cloud now cast into the deep vallei of the
sea till at length the rocki headland loom befor me and i saw the
breaker smite upon the stubborn rock and through the scream of
the wind heard the sullen thunder of their fall and the groan of stone
suck seaward from the beach on highthron upon the mane of a
mighti billowfifti cubit beneath me the level of the hiss water
abov me the inki sky it wa done the spar wa torn from me and
drag downward by the weight of the bag of gold and the cling of
my garment i sank struggl furious
now i wa underth green light for a moment stream through the
water and then came dark and on the dark pictur of the
past pictur after pictureal the long scene of life wa written
here then in my ear i onli heard the song of the nightingal the
murmur of the summer sea and the music of cleopatra laugh of victori
follow me softli and yet more soft as i sank awai to sleep
onc more my life came back and with it a sens of deadli sick and
of ach pain i open my ey and saw a kind face bend over me
and knew that i wa in the room of a build hous
how came i hither i ask faintli
of a truth poseidon brought thee stranger answer a rough voic
in barbar greek we found thee cast high upon the beach like a dead
dolphin and brought thee to our hous for we ar fisherfolk and here
methink thou must lie a while for thy left leg is broken by the forc
of the wave
i strove to move my foot and could not it wa true the bone wa broken
abov the knee
who art thou and how art thou name ask the roughbeard sailor
i am an egyptian travel whose ship ha sunk in the furi of the gale
and i am name olympu i answer for these peopl call a mountain
that we had sight olympu and therefor i took the name at hazard
and as olympu i wa henceforth known
here with these rough fisherfolk i abod for the half of a year pai
them a littl out of the sum of gold that had come safe ashor upon
me for it wa long befor my bone grew togeth again and then i wa
left somewhat of a crippl for i who had been so tall and straight and
strong now limpedon limb be shorter than the other and after i
recov from my hurt i still live there and toil with them at the
trade of fish for i knew not whither i should go or what i should
do and for a while i wa fain to becom a peasant fisherman and so
wear my weari life awai and these peopl entreat me kindli though
as other thei fear me much hold me to be a wizard brought hither
by the sea for my sorrow had stamp so strang an aspect on my face
that men gaze at me grew fear of what lai beneath it calm
there then i abod till at length on night as i lai and strove to
sleep great restless came upon me and a mighti desir onc more to
see the face of sihor but whether thi desir wa of the god or born
of my own heart not know i cannot tell so strong wa it at the
least that befor it wa dawn i rose from my bed of straw and
cloth myself in my fisher garb and becaus i had no wish to answer
question thu i took farewel of my humbl host first i place some
piec of gold on the wellclean tabl of wood and then take a pot
of flour i strew it in the form of letter write
thi gift from olympu the egyptian who return into the sea
then i went and on the third dai i came to the great citi of salami
that is also on the sea here i abod in the fishermen quarter till
a vessel wa about to sail for alexandria and to the captain of thi
vessel a man of papho i hire myself as a sailor we sail with a
favour wind and on the fifth dai i came to alexandria that hate
citi and saw the light danc on it golden dome
here i might not abid so again i hire myself out as a sailor give
my labour in return for passag and we pass up the nile and i
learn from the talk of men that cleopatra had come back to alexandria
draw antoni with her and that thei live togeth with royal state
in the palac on the lochia inde the boatmen alreadi had a song
thereon which thei sang as thei labour at the oar also i heard how
the gallei that wa sent to search for the vessel which carri the
syrian merchant had founder with all her crew and the tale that the
queen astronom harmachi had flown to heaven from the roof of the
hous at tarsu and the sailor wonder becaus i sat and labour and
would not sing their ribald song of the love of cleopatra for thei
too began to fear me and mutter concern me among themselv then
i knew that i wa a man accurs and set aparta man whom none might
love
on the sixth dai we drew nigh to abouthi where i left the craft and
the sailor were right glad to see me go and with a break heart i
walk through the fertil field see face that i knew well but in
my rough disguis and limp gait none knew me at length as the sun
sank i came near to the great outer pylon of the templ and here i
crouch down in the ruin of a hous not know why i had come or
what i wa about to do like a lost ox i had strai from far back to
the field of my birth and for what if my father amenemhat still
live sure he would turn hi face from me i dare not go into the
presenc of my father i sat hidden there among the broken rafter and
idli watch the pylon gate to see if perchanc a face i knew should
issu from them but none came forth or enter in though the great
gate stood wide and then i saw that herb were grow between the
stone where no herb had grown for ag what could thi be wa the
templ desert nai how could the worship of the etern god have
ceas that for thousand of year had dai by dai been offer in the
holi place wa then my father dead it well might be and yet why
thi silenc where were the priest where the worshipp
i could bear the doubt no more but as the sun sank red i crept like a
hunt jackal through the open gate and on till i reach the first
great hall of pillar here i paus and gaze around menot a sight
not a sound in the dim and holi place i went on with a beat heart
to the second great hall the hall of sixandthirti pillar where i
had been crown lord of all the land still not a sight or a sound
thenc half fear of my own footfal so terribl did it echo in the
silenc of the desert holi i pass down the passag of the name
of the pharaoh toward my father chamber the curtain still swung
over the doorwai but what would there be withinalso empti i
lift it and noiselessli pass in and there in hi carven chair
at the tabl on which hi long white beard flow sat my father
amenemhat clad in hi priestli robe at first i thought that he wa
dead he sat so still but at length he turn hi head and i saw that
hi ey were white and sightless he wa blind and hi face wa thin
as the face of a dead man and woeful with ag and grief
i stood still and felt the blind ey wander over me i could not
speak to himi dare not speak to him i would go and hide myself
afresh
i had alreadi turn and grasp the curtain when my father spoke in a
deep slow voic

chapter iii
of the life of him who wa name the learn olympu in the tomb of the
harper that is by tp of hi counsel to cleopatra of the messag of
charmion and of the pass of olympu down to alexandria
these thing then came to pass for eighti dai i wa hidden of the old

hid i saw the priest of the templ of osiri and of the holi shrine of
isi come forth and in slow process bear hi paint coffin to the
sacr lake and lai it beneath the funer tent in the consecr boat
i saw them celebr the symbol of the trial of the dead and name him
abov all men just and then bear him thenc to lai him by hi wife
my mother in the deep tomb that he had hewn in the rock near to the
restingplac of the holi osiri where notwithstand my sin i
too hope to sleep er long and when all these thing were done and the
deep tomb seal the wealth of my father have been remov from the
hidden treasuri and place in safeti i fled disguis with the old
wife atoua up the nile till we came to tp and here in thi great
citi i lai a while till a place could be found where i should hide
myself
thebeseditor
and such a place i found for to the north of the great citi ar brown
and rug hill and desert vallei blast of the sun and in thi
place of desol the divin pharaoh my forefath hollow out
their tomb in the solid rock the most part of which ar lost to thi
dai so cunningli have thei been hidden but some ar open for the
accurs persian and other thiev broke into them in search
of treasur and on nightfor by night onli did i leav my
hidingplacejust as the dawn wa break on the mountain top i
wander alon in thi sad vallei of death like to which there is
no other and present came to the mouth of a tomb hidden amid great
rock which afterward i knew for the place of the buri of the
divin rames the third of that name now long gather to osiri and
by the faint light of the dawn creep through the entranc i saw that
it wa spaciou and that within were chamber
on the follow night therefor i return bear light with
atoua my nurs who ever minist faithfulli to me as when i wa
littl and without discret and we search the mighti tomb and came
to the great hall of the sarcophagu of granit in which the divin
rames sleep and saw the mystic paint on the wall the symbol
of the snake unend the symbol of ra rest upon the scarabu the
symbol of ra rest upon nout the symbol of the headless men and mani
other whereof be initi well i read the mysteri and
open from the long descend passag i found chamber in which were
paint beauti to behold and of all manner of thing for beneath
each chamber is entomb the master of the craft of which the paint
tell he who wa the chief of the servant of that craft in the hous
of thi divin rames and on the wall of the last chamberon
the lefthand side look toward the hall of the sarcophagusar
paint exceedingli beauti and two blind harper plai upon
their bent harp befor the god mou and beneath the floor these
harper who harp no more ar soft at sleep here then in thi gloomi
place even in the tomb of the harper and the compani of the dead i
took up my abod and here for eight long year i work out my penanc
and made aton for my sin but atoua becaus she love to be near
the light abod in the chamber of the boatsthat is the first chamber
on the righthand side of the galleri look toward the hall of the
sarcophagu
and thi wa the manner of my life on everi second dai the old wife
atoua went forth and brought water from the citi and such food as is
necessari to keep the life from fail and also taper made from fat
and on hour at the time of sunris and on hour at the time of sunset
i did go forth also to wander in the vallei for my health sake and to
save my sight from fail in the great dark of the tomb but the
other hour of the dai and night except when i climb the mountain
to watch the cours of the star i spent in prayer and medit and
sleep till the cloud of sin lift from my heart and onc more i drew
near to the god though with isi my heavenli mother i might speak no
more and i grew exceedingli wise also ponder on all those mysteri
to which i held the kei for abstin and prayer and sorrow
solitud wore awai the gross of my flesh and with the ey of the
spirit i learn to look deep into the heart of thing till the joi of
wisdom fell like dew upon my soul
soon the rumour wa waft about the citi that a certain holi man name
olympu abod in solitud in the tomb of the aw vallei of the dead
and hither came peopl bear sick that i might cure them and i gave
my mind to the studi of simpl in which atoua instruct me and by
lore and the weight of my thought i gain great skill in medicin and
heal mani sick and thu ever as time went on my fame wa nois
abroad for it wa said that i wa also a magician and that in the
tomb i had commun with the spirit of the dead and thi inde i
didthough it is not law for me to speak of these matter thu
then it came to pass that no more need atoua go forth to seek food and
water for the peopl brought itmor than wa need for i would
receiv no fee now at first fear lest some in the hermit olympu
might know the lost harmachi i would onli meet those who came in the
dark of the tomb but afterward when i learn how it wa held
through all the land that harmachi wa certainli no more i came forth
and sat in the mouth of the tomb and minist to the sick and
at time calcul nativ for the great and thu my fame grew
continu till at length folk journei even from memphi and
alexandria to visit me and from them i learn how antoni had left
cleopatra for a while and fulvia be dead had marri octavia the
sister of csar mani other thing i learn also
and in the second year i did thi i despatch the old wife atoua
disguis as a seller of simpl to alexandria bid her seek out
charmion and if yet she found her faith reveal to her the secret
of my wai of life so she went and in the fifth month from her sail
return bear charmion greet and a token and she told me that
she had found mean to see charmion and in talk had let fall the name
of harmachi speak of me as on dead at which charmion unabl to
control her grief wept aloud then read her heartfor the old
wife wa veri clever and held the kei of knowledgesh told her that
harmachi yet live and sent her greet thereon charmion wept yet
more with joi and kiss the old wife and made her gift bid her
tell me that she had kept her vow and wait for my come and the hour
of vengeanc so have learn mani secret atoua return again to
tp
and in the follow year messeng came to me from cleopatra bear
a seal roll and great gift i open the roll and read thi in it
cleopatra to olympu the learn egyptian who dwell in the vallei of
death by tp
the fame of thy renown o learn olympu hath reach our ear tell
thou then thi to us and if thou tellest aright greater honour and
wealth shalt thou have than ani in egypt how shall we win back the love
of nobl antoni who is bewitch of cun octavia and tarri long
from us
now in thi i saw the hand of charmion who had made my renown known to
cleopatra
all that night i took counsel with my wisdom and on the morrow wrote my
answer as it wa put into my heart to the destruct of cleopatra and
antoni and thu i wrote
olympu the egyptian to cleopatra the queen
go forth into syria with on who shall be sent to lead thee thu shalt
thou win antoni to thy arm again and with him gift more great than
thou canst dream
and with thi letter i dismiss the messeng bid them share the
present sent by cleopatra among their compani
so thei went wonder
but cleopatra seiz on the advic to which her passion prompt her
depart straightwai with fonteiu capito into syria and there the
thing came about as i had foretold for antoni wa subdu of her
and gave her the greater part of cilicia the ocean shore of arabia
nabatha the balmbear provinc of juda the provinc of phoenicia
the provinc of coelesyria the rich isl of cypru and all the librari
of pergamu and to the twin children that with the son ptolemi
cleopatra had born to antoni he impious gave the name of king
the children of kingsof alexand helio as the greek name the sun
and of cleopatra selen the moon the longwing
these thing then came to pass
now on her return to alexandria cleopatra sent me great gift of which
i would have none and prai me the learn olympu to come to her at
alexandria but it wa not yet time and i would not but thereaft she
and antoni sent mani time to me for counsel and i ever counsel them
to their ruin nor did my propheci fail
thu the long year roll awai and i the hermit olympu the dweller
in a tomb the eater of bread and the drinker of water by strength of
the wisdom that wa given me of the aveng power becam onc more
great in khem for i grew ever wiser as i trampl the desir of the
flesh beneath my feet and turn my ey to heaven
at length eight full year were accomplish the war with the parthian
had come and gone and artavasd king of armenia had been led in
triumph through the street of alexandria cleopatra had visit samo
and athen and by her counsel the nobl octavia had been driven
like some discard concubin from the hous of antoni at rome and
now at the last the measur of the folli of antoni wa full even to
the brim for thi master of the world had no longer the good gift of
reason he wa lost in cleopatra as i had been lost therefor in the
event octavianu declar war against him
and as i slept upon a certain dai in the chamber of the harper in the
tomb of pharaoh that is by tp there came to me a vision of my father
the ag amenemhat and he stood over me lean on hi staff and
spoke sai
look forth my son
then i look forth and with the ey of my spirit saw the sea and
two great fleet grappl in war hard by a rocki coast and the emblem
were those of octavian and of the other those of cleopatra and antoni
the ship of antoni and cleopatra bore down upon the ship of csar and
drove them on for victori inclin to antoni
i look again there sat cleopatra in a golddeck gallei watch the
fight with eager ey then i cast my spirit on her so that she seem
to hear the voic of dead harmachi cry in her ear
fly cleopatra it seem to sai fly or perish
she look up wildli and again she heard my spirit cry now a mighti
fear took hold of her she call aloud to the sailor to hoist the
sail and make signal to her fleet to put about thi thei did wonder
but littl loath and fled in hast from the battl
then a great roar went up from friend and foe
cleopatra is fled cleopatra is fled and i saw wreck and red ruin
fall upon the fleet of antoni and awok from my tranc
the dai pass and again a vision of my father came to me and spoke
sai
aris my sonth hour of vengeanc is at hand thy plot have not
fail thy prayer have been heard by the bid of the god as she
sat in her gallei at the fight of actium the heart of cleopatra wa
fill with fear so that deem she heard thy voic bid her fly
or perish she fled with all her fleet now the strength of actium is
broken on the sea go forth and as it shall be put into thy mind so do
thou
in the morn i awok wonder and went to the mouth of the tomb
and there come up the vallei i saw the messeng of cleopatra and
with them a roman guard
what will ye with me now i ask sternli

captain bow low befor me for i wa much fear by all men the

so on that veri dai i depart togeth with the ag atoua ay i went
as secretli as i had come and the tomb of the divin rames knew me no
more and with me i took all the treasur of my father amenemhat for
i wa not mind to go to alexandria emptyhand and as a suppliant
but rather as a man of much wealth and condit now as i went i
learn that antoni follow cleopatra had inde fled from actium
and knew that the end drew nigh for thi and mani other thing had
i foreseen in the dark of the tomb of tp and plan to bring
about
thu then i came to alexandria and enter into a hous which had
been made readi for me at the palac gate
and that veri night charmion came to mecharmion whom i had not seen
for nine long year
chapter iv
of the meet of charmion with the learn olympu of her speech with
him of the come of olympu into the presenc of cleopatra and of the
command of cleopatra
clad in my plain black robe i sat in the guestchamb of the hous
that had been made readi for me i sat in a carven lionfoot chair
and look upon the swing lamp of scent oil the pictur
tapestri the rich syrian rugsand amidst all thi luxuri bethought
me of that tomb of the harper which is at tp and of the nine long
year of dark loneli and prepar i sat and crouch upon a rug
near to the door lai the ag atoua her hair wa white as snow and
shrivel with ag wa the wrinkl counten of the woman who when
all desert me had yet clung to me in her great love forget my
great sin nine year nine long year and now onc again i set my
foot in alexandria onc again in the appoint circl of thing i came
forth from the solitud of prepar to be a fate to cleopatra and
thi second time i came not forth to fail
and yet how chang the circumst i wa out of the stori my part
now wa but the part of the sword in the hand of justic i might no
more hope to make egypt free and great and sit upon my law throne
khem wa lost and lost wa i harmachi in the rush and turmoil of
event the great plot of which i had been the pivot wa cover up and
forgotten scarc a memori of it remain the curtain of dark night
wa close in upon the histori of my ancient race it veri god were
totter to their fall i could alreadi in the spirit hear the shriek
of the roman eagl as thei flap their wing abov the furthest bank
of sihor
present i rous myself and bade atoua go seek a mirror and bring it
to me that i might look therein
and i saw thi a face shrunken and pallid on which no smile came
great ey grown wan with gaze into dark look out beneath
the shaven head emptili as the hollow eyepit of a skull a wizen
halt form wast by abstin sorrow and prayer a long wild beard
of iron grei thin bluevein hand that ever trembl like a leaf
bow shoulder and lessen limb time and grief had done their
work inde scarc could i think myself the same as when the royal
harmachisin all the splendour of my strength and youth beautyi
first had look upon the woman loveli that did destroi me and
yet within me burn the same fire as of yore yet i wa not chang
for time and grief have no power to alter the immort spirit of man
season mai come and go hope like a bird mai fly awai passion mai
break it wing against the iron bar of fate illus mai crumbl
as the cloudi tower of sunset flame faith as run water mai slip
from beneath our feet solitud mai stretch itself around us like the
measureless desert sand old ag mai creep as the gather night over
our bow head grown hoari in their shameyea bound to fortun
wheel we mai tast of everi turn of chancenow rule as king now
serv as slave now love now hate now prosper and now perish but
still through all we ar the same for thi is the marvel of ident
and as i sat and thought these thing in bitter of heart there came
a knock at the door
open atoua i said
she rose and did my bid and a woman enter clad in grecian robe

the caus of all our ruin to speak truth in secret i wa thank
to her who woo of all and live in thi shameless court had still
through the long year pour out her unreturn love upon an outcast
and who when that poor broken slave of fortun came back in such

i thank thee that thou dost not answer she said for the bitter
word which thou didst pour upon me in those dai that long ar dead

heart is no more place for the arrow of thy scorn new venom through

of antoni but as thou sentest me word i entreat him for the queen
vow to him with tear that did he leav her she would die of
grief and he poor slave believ me and so she went and in the
thick of the fight for what caus i know not though perchanc thou
knowest harmachi she made signal to her squadron and put about
fled from the battl sail for peloponnesu and now mark the end
when antoni saw that she wa gone he in hi mad took a gallei
and desert all follow hard after her leav hi fleet to be
shatter and sunk and hi great armi in greec of twenti legion
and twelv thousand hors without a leader and all thi no man would
believ that antoni the smitten of the god had fallen so deep in
shame therefor for a while the armi tarri and but now tonight
come new brought by canidiu the gener that worn with doubt and
be at length sure that antoni had desert them the whole of hi
great forc ha yield to csar
and where then is antoni
he ha built him a habit on a littl isl in the great harbour and
name it timonium becaus forsooth like timon he cri out at the
ingratitud of mankind that ha forsaken him and there he li smitten
by a fever of the mind and thither thou must go at dawn so will the
queen to cure him of hi ill and draw him to her arm for he will
not see her nor know he yet the full measur of hi woe but first
my bid is to lead thee instantli to cleopatra who would ask thy
counsel

and so we pass the palac gate and along the alabast hall and
present onc again i stood befor the door of cleopatra chamber and
onc again charmion left me to warn her of my come
present she came back and beckon to me make strong thy heart she
whisper and see that thou dost not betrai thyself for still ar the
ey of cleopatra keen enter

of the fountain the song of the nightingal and the murmur of the
summer sea with bow head and halt gait i came till at length i
stood befor the couch of cleopatrathat same golden couch on which
she had sat the night she overcam me then i gather my strength and
look up there befor me wa cleopatra gloriou as of old but oh
how chang sinc that night when i saw antoni clasp her in hi arm at
tarsu her beauti still cloth her like a garment the ey were yet
deep and unfathom as the blue sea the face still splendid in it
great loveli and yet all wa chang time that could not touch
her charm had stamp upon her presenc such a look of weari grief as
mai not be written passion beat ever in that fierc heart of her
had written hi record on her brow and in her ey shone the sad light
of sorrow
i bow low befor thi most royal woman who onc had been my love and

of her plan and of how even now her gallei were be drawn by the
canal that lead from bubasti on the pelusiac branch of the nile to
clysma at the head of the bai of heroopoli for it wa her design
should csar prove stubborn to fly with antoni and her treasur down

then a great silenc of fear fell upon the compani and antoni sat also
silent
chapter vi
of the work of the learn olympu at memphi of the poison of
cleopatra of the speech of antoni to hi captain and of the pass
of isi from the land of khem
now i harmachi must make speed with my task set down that which
is permit as shortli as mai be and leav much untold for of thi
i am warn that doom draw on and my dai ar wellnigh sped after the
draw forth of antoni from the timonium came that time of heavi quiet
which herald the rise of the desert wind antoni and cleopatra
onc again gave themselv up to luxuri and night by night feast in
splendour at the palac thei sent ambassador to csar but csar would
have none of them and thi hope be gone thei turn their mind
to the defenc of alexandria men were gather ship were built and a
great forc wa made readi against the come of csar
and now aid by charmion i began my last work of hate and vengeanc
i worm myself deep into the secret of the palac counsel all
thing for evil i bade cleopatra keep antoni gai lest he should brood
upon hi sorrow and thu she sap hi strength and energi with
luxuri and wine i gave him of my draughtsdraught that sank hi
soul in dream of happi and power leav him to wake to a heavier
miseri soon without my heal medicin he could not sleep and thu
be ever at hi side i bound hi weaken will to mine till at last
he would do littl if i said not it is well cleopatra also grown
veri superstiti lean much upon me for i prophesi fals to her
in secret
moreov i wove other web my fame wa great throughout egypt for
dure the long year that i had dwelt in tp it had spread through all
the land therefor mani men of note came to me both for their health
sake and becaus it wa known that i had the ear of antoni and the
queen and in these dai of doubt and troubl thei were fain to learn
the truth all these men i work upon with doubt word sap
their loyalti and i caus mani to fall awai and yet none could bear
an evil report of what i had said also cleopatra sent me to memphi
there to move the priest and governor that thei should gather men in
upper egypt for the defenc of alexandria and i went and spoke to the
priest with such a doubl mean and with so much wisdom that thei
knew me to be on of the initi in the deeper mysteri but how i
olympu the physician came thu to be initi none might sai and
afterward thei sought me secretli and i gave them the holi sign of
brotherhood and thereund bade them not to ask who i might be but
send no aid to cleopatra rather i said must thei make peac with
csar for by csar grace onli could the worship of the god endur in
khem so have taken counsel of the holi api thei promis in public
to give help to cleopatra but in secret sent an embassi to csar
thu then it came to pass that egypt gave but littl aid to it hate
macedonian queen thenc from memphi i came onc more to alexandria
and have made favour report continu my secret work and
inde the alexandrian could not easili be stir for as thei sai
in the marketplac the ass look at it burden and is blind to it
master cleopatra had oppress them so long that the roman wa like a
welcom friend
thu the time pass on and everi night found cleopatra with fewer
friend than that which had gone befor for in evil dai friend fly
like swallow befor the frost yet she would not give up antoni whom
she love though to my knowledg csar by hi freedman thyreu made
promis to her of her dominion for herself and for her children if she
would but slai antoni or even betrai him bound but to thi her woman
heartfor still she had a heartwould not consent and moreov we
counsel her against it for of necess we must hold him to her
lest antoni escap or be slain cleopatra might ride out the storm
and yet be queen of egypt and thi griev me becaus antoni though
weak wa still a brave man and a great and moreov in my own heart
i read the lesson of hi woe for were we not akin in wretched had
not the same woman rob us of empir friend and honour but piti
ha no place in polit nor could it turn my feet from the path of
vengeanc it wa ordain that i should tread csar drew nigh pelusium
fell the end wa at hand it wa charmion who brought the tide to
the queen and antoni as thei slept in the heat of the dai and i came
with her
awak she cri awak thi is no time for sleep seleucu hath
surrend pelusium to csar who march straight on alexandria
with a great oath antoni sprang up and clutch cleopatra by the arm
thou hast betrai mebi the god i swear it now thou shalt pai the
price and snatch up hi sword he drew it
stai thy hand antoni she cri it is falsei know naught of
thi and she sprang upon him and clung about hi neck weep i
know naught my lord take thou the wife of seleucu and hi littl
children whom i hold in guard and aveng thyself o antoni antoni
why dost thou doubt me
then antoni threw down hi sword upon the marbl and cast himself
upon the couch hid hi face and groan in bitter of spirit
but charmion smile for it wa she who had sent secretli to seleucu
her friend counsel him to surrend forthwith sai that no fight
would be made at alexandria and that veri night cleopatra took all her
great store of pearl and emeraldsthos that remain of the treasur
of menkauraal her wealth of gold eboni ivori and cinnamon
treasur without price and place it in the mausoleum of granit which
after our egyptian fashion she had built upon the hill that is by the
templ of the holi isi these rich she pile up upon a bed of flax
that when she fire it all might perish in the flame and escap the
greed of moneylov octavianu and she slept henceforth in thi tomb
awai from antoni but in the daytim she still saw him at the palac
but a littl while after when csar with all hi great forc
had alreadi cross the capon mouth of the nile and wa hard on
alexandria i came to the palac whither cleopatra had summon me
there i found her in the alabast hall royal clad a wild light in
her ey and with her ira and charmion and befor her guard and
stretch here and there upon the marbl bodi of dead men among whom
lai on yet dy

here man man knowest thou not that in death onli can peac be found
struggl no more but enter into rest and even as she spoke the man
with a great cry gave up the spirit
there she cri at length the farc is playedawai with those
slave whom i have forc through the difficult gate of joi and she
clap her hand but when thei had born the bodi thenc she drew me
to her and spoke thu

prepar me such a draught as shall pangless steal my life awai
and as i listen the sens of triumph fill my bitter heart for
i knew now that by my own hand should thi ruin woman die and the
justic of the god be done
spoken like a queen o cleopatra i said death shall cure thy ill
and i will brew such a wine as shall draw him down a sudden friend and
sink thee in a sea of slumber whenc upon thi earth thou shalt never

as thei sai here where the head goe the tail will follow moreov
csar ha my challeng and if he will but meet me hand to hand the
world shall soon see which is the better man antoni or octavian
and even as he spoke and the peopl cheer there came the cry of a
messeng from csar
the herald enter and bow low gave a write to antoni bow
again and went cleopatra snatch it from hi hand broke the silk and
read aloud
csar to antoni greet

than beneath the sword of csar farewel
and thereaft thei cheer no more
the dark came and befor it wa midnight have feast with hi
friend who tonight went over hi woe and tomorrow should betrai him
antoni went forth to the gather of the captain of the landforc
and of the fleet attend by mani among whom wa i
when all were come togeth he spoke to them stand barehead in
their midst beneath the radianc of the moon and thu he most nobli

night i shall deck yonder canop gate with the head of octavian and
hi captain
ay cheer and cheer again i love that martial music which swell
not as from the indiffer lip of clarion now neath the breath of
antoni and now of csar but rather out of the singl heart of men who
love me yetand now i will speak low as we do speak oer the bier of
some belov deadyet if fortun should rise against me and if born
down by the weight of arm antoni the soldier di a soldier death
leav you to mourn him who ever wa your friend thi is my will
that after our rough fashion of the camp i here declar to you you

of helpless soldier enough tomorrow at the dawn we spring on
csar throat both by land and sea swear that ye will cling to me

highest heaven it yet mai shine the lamp of csar down till then
farewel
he turn to go as he went thei caught hi hand and kiss it and so
deepli were thei move that mani wept like children nor could antoni
master hi grief for in the moonlight i saw tear roll down hi
furrow cheek and fall upon that mighti breast
and see all thi i wa much troubl for i well knew that if these
men held firm to antoni all might yet go well for cleopatra and though
i bore no illwil against antoni yet he must fall and in that fall
drag down the woman who like some poison plant had twine herself
about hi giant strength till it choke and moulder in her embrac
therefor when antoni went i went not but stood back in the shadow
watch the face of the lord and captain as thei spoke togeth
then it is agre said he who should lead the fleet and thi we
swear to on and all that we will cling to nobl antoni to the last
extrem of fortun
ay ay thei answer

magic and he drew hi sword
ay slai him he would betrai the lord antoni whom he is paid to
doctor
hold a while i said in a slow and solemn voic and bewar how ye
try to murder the servant of the god i am no traitor for myself
i abid the event here in alexandria but to you i sai flee flee to
csar i serv antoni and the queeni serv them truli but abov all
i serv the holi god and what thei make known to me that lord i do
know and i know thi that antoni is doom and cleopatra is doom
for csar conquer therefor becaus i honour you nobl gentlemen
and think with piti on your wive left widow and your littl
fatherless children that shall if ye hold to antoni be sold as
slavestherefor i sai cling to antoni if ye will and die or flee
to csar and be save and thi i sai becaus it is so ordain of the
god
the god thei growl what god slit the traitor throat and
stop hi illomen talk
let him show us a sign from hi god or let him die i do mistrust thi
man said anoth
stand back ye fool i cri stand backfre mine armsand i will
show you a sign and there wa that in my face which frighten them
for thei freed me and stood back then i lift up my hand and put
out all my strength of soul search the depth of space till my spirit
commun with the spirit of my mother isi onli the word of power i
utter not as i had been bidden and the holi mysteri of the goddess
answer to my spirit cry fall in aw silenc upon the face of
the earth deeper and deeper grew the terribl silenc even the dog
ceas to howl and in the citi men stood still afear then from far
awai there came the ghostli music of the sistra faint it wa at first
but ever as it came it grew more loud till the air shiver with the
unearthli sound of terror i said naught but point with my hand
toward the sky and behold bosom upon the air float a vast veil
shape that herald by the swell music of the sistra drew slowli
near till it shadow lai upon us it came it pass it went toward
the camp of csar till at length the music di awai and the aw
shape wa swallow in the night
it is bacchu cri on bacchu who leav lost antoni and as
he spoke there rose a groan of terror from all the camp
but i knew that it wa not bacchu the fals god but the divin isi
who desert khem and pass over the edg of the world sought her
home in space to be no more known of men for though her worship is
still upheld though still she is here and in all earth isi manifest
herself no more in egypt i hid my face and prai but when i lift it
from my robe lo all had fled and i wa alon

the plot and becaus harmachi scorn me i betrai him and becaus
of my great love for him i have remain unw and she glanc up at
me and caught my ey then let the modest lash veil her own
so i thought it strang ar the wai of women but littl caus
methink had that harmachi to thank thee for thy love what sayest
thou olympu ah and so thou also wast a traitor charmion how
danger ar the path which monarch tread well i forgiv thee for
thou hast serv me faithfulli sinc that hour
but to my tale harmachi i dare not slai lest hi great parti should
rise in furi and cast me from the throne and now mark the issu though
he must murder me in secret thi harmachi love me and someth
thereof i guess i had striven a littl to draw him to me for the
sake of hi beauti and hi wit and for the love of man cleopatra never
strove in vain therefor when with the dagger in hi robe he came
to slai me i match my charm against hi will and need i tell you
be man and woman how i won oh never can i forget the look in
the ey of that fallen princ that forsworn priest that discrown
pharaoh when lost in the poppi draught i saw him sink into
a shame sleep whenc he might no more wake with honour and
thereaftertil in the end i weari of him and hi sad learn
mind for hi guilti soul forbad him to be gaya littl i came to care
for him though not to love but hehe who love meclung to me as a
drunkard to the cup which ruin him deem that i should wed him
he betrai to me the secret of the hidden wealth of the pyramid of
herfor at the time i much need treasureand togeth we dare the
terror of the tomb and drew it forth even from dead pharaoh breast
see thi emerald wa a part thereofand she point to the great
scarabu that she had drawn from the holi heart of menkaura
and becaus of what wa written in the tomb and of that thing which
we saw in the tombah pest upon it why doe it memori haunt me
nowand also becaus of polici for i would fain have won the love
of the egyptian i wa mind to marri thi harmachi and declar hi
place and lineag to the worldai and by hi aid hold egypt from the
roman for delliu had then come to call me to antoni and after much
thought i determin to send him back with sharp word but on that veri
morn as i tire me for the court came charmion yonder and i told
her thi for i would see how the matter fell upon her mind now mark
olympu the power of jealousi that littl wedg which yet ha strength
to rend the tree of empir that secret sword which can carv the fate
of king thi she could in no wise beardeni it charmion if thou
canst for now it is clear to methat the man she love should be
given to me as husbandm whom he love and therefor with more
skill and wit than i can tell she reason with me show that i
should by no mean do thi thing but journei to antoni and for that
charmion i thank thee now that all is come and gone and by a veri
littl her word weigh down my scale of judgment against harmachi
and i went to antoni thu it is through the jealou spleen of yonder
fair charmion and the passion of a man on which i plai as on a lyre
that all these thing have come to pass for thi caus octavian sit
a king in alexandria for thi caus antoni is discrown and dead and
for thi caus i too must die tonight ah charmion charmion thou
hast much to answer for thou hast chang the stori of the world and
yet even nowi would not have it otherwis
she paus awhil cover her ey with her hand and look i saw
great tear upon the cheek of charmion
and of thi harmachi i ask where is he now o queen
where is he in amenti forsoothmak hi peac with isi
perchanc at tarsu i saw antoni and love him and from that moment i
loath the sight of the egyptian and swore to make an end of him for
a lover done with should be a lover dead and be jealou he spoke
some word of evil omen even at that feast of the pearl and on the
same night i would have slain him but befor the deed wa done he wa
gone
and whither wa he gone
nai that know not i brennush who led my guard and last year
sail north to join hi own peoplebrennu swore he saw him float to
the ski but in thi matter i misdoubt me of brennu for methink
he love the man nai he sank off cypru and wa drown perchanc
charmion can tell us how
i can tell thee noth o queen harmachi is lost
and well lost charmion for he wa an evil man to plai withai
although i better him i sai it well he serv my purpos but i love
him not and even now i fear him for it seem to me that i heard
hi voic summon me to fly through the din of the fight at actium
thank be to the god as thou sayest he is lost and can no more be
found
but i listen put forth my strength and by the art i have cast
the shadow of my spirit upon the spirit of cleopatra so that she felt
the presenc of the lost harmachi
nai what is it she said by serapi i grow afraid it seem to
me that i feel harmachi here hi memori overwhelm me like a flood of
water and he these ten year dead oh at such a time it is unholi
nai o queen i answer if he be dead then he is everywher and
well at such a timeth time of thy own deathmai hi spirit draw near
to welcom thine at it go

between us is too heavi and in anoth world than thi more evenli
perchanc should we be match ah the terror pass i wa but
unnerv well the fool stori hath serv to wile awai the heaviest of
our hour the hour which end in death sing to me charmion sing for

thi is the state of life at length there come an hour when rather
than endur those burden that overwhelm us put off the bodi we
would take wing into forget csar thou hast conquer take
thou the spoil of victori but in thy triumph cleopatra cannot walk
when all is lost then we must go to seek the lost thu in the desert
of despair the brave do harvest resolut cleopatra hath been great
as antoni wa great nor shall her fame be minish in the manner of
her end slave live to endur their wrong but princ tread with a
firmer step pass through the gate of wrong into the royal dwell of
the dead thi onli doth egypt ask of csarthat he suffer her to lie
in the tomb of antoni farewel
thi i wrote and have seal the write cleopatra bade me go find a
messeng despatch it to csar and then return so i went and at the
door of the tomb i call a soldier who wa not on duti and give him
monei bade him take the letter to csar then i went back and there in
the chamber the three women stood in silenc cleopatra cling to the
arm of ira and charmion a littl apart watch the twain
if inde thou art mind to make an end o queen i said the time
is short for present csar will send hi servant in answer to thy
letter and i drew forth the phial of white and deadli bane and set it
upon the board
she took it in her hand and gaze thereon how innoc it seem she
said and yet therein li my death ti strang

happi ay in rome where thou shalt walk in csar triumph while
the laughter of the hardei latin women shall chime down the music of
thy golden chain
nai i will die olympu oh if on would but show the path
then ira loos her hand and step forward give me the draught
physician she said i go to make readi for my queen
it is well i answer on thy own head be it and i pour from the
phial into a littl golden goblet
she rais it curtsi low to cleopatra then come forward kiss
her on the brow and charmion she also kiss thi done tarri not
and make no prayer for ira wa a greek she drank and put her
hand to her head instantli fell down and di

ay olympu thine is a master drug come now i thirst fill me the
bowl lest ira weari in wait at the gate
so i pour afresh into the goblet but thi time make pretenc
to rins the cup i mix a littl water with the bane for i wa not
mind that she should die befor she knew me
then did the royal cleopatra take the goblet in her hand turn her
love ey to heaven and cry aloud

for your ear ar shut unto my cry and your ey blind to my grief
therefor i make entreati of that last friend whom the god depart

and the dy cleopatra rest on her hand swung slowli to and fro
gaze with vacant ey
then the answer came the casement burst asund and on flitter

our heart blood upon the shrine of our discrown god
for love is of the spirit and know not death
chapter ix

deck it royal so that it mai give it dumb audienc to the messeng
of csar as becom the last of egypt queen
i spoke no word in answer for my heart wa veri heavi and now that all
wa done i wa weari togeth then we lift up the bodi and laid it
on the golden bed charmion place the uru crown upon the ivori brow
and comb the nightdark hair that show never a thread of silver
and for the last time shut those ey wherein had shone all the
chang glori of the sea she fold the chill hand upon the breast
whenc passion breath had fled and straighten the bent knee
beneath the broider robe and by the head set flower and there at
length cleopatra lai more splendid now in her cold majesti of death
than in her richest hour of breath beauti
we drew back and look on her and on dead ira at her feet
it is done quoth charmion we ar aveng and now harmachi
dost follow by thi same road and she nod toward the phial on the

she took the phial and with a steadi hand pour what wa left of the

methink there is a fate abov our fate that blow from some strang
shore compel our littl sail of purpos set them as we will and

she drank cast down the cup and for a moment stood with the wide ey
of on who look for death then he came and charmion the egyptian fell
prone upon the floor dead and for a moment more i stood alon with the
dead
i crept to the side of cleopatra and now that none were left to see
i sat down on the bed and laid her head upon my knee as onc befor
it had been laid in that night of sacrileg beneath the shadow of the
everlast pyramid then i kiss her chill brow and went from the
hous of deathaveng but sore smitten with despair
physician said the offic of the guard as i went through the gate
