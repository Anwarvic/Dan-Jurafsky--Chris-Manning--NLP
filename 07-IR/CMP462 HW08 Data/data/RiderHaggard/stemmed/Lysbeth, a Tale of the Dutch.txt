chapter i
the wolf and the badger
the time wa in or about the year 1544 when the emperor charl v
rule the netherland and our scene the citi of leyden
ani on who ha visit thi pleasant town know that it li in the
midst of wide flat meadow and is intersect by mani canal fill
with rhine water but now as it wa winter near to christma inde
the meadow and the quaint gabl roof of the citi lai buri beneath
a dazzl sheet of snow while instead of boat and barg skater
glide up and down the frozen surfac of the canal which were swept
for their conveni outsid the wall of the town not far from the
morsch poort or gate the surfac of the broad moat which surround
them present a sight as gai as it wa charm just here on of
the branch of the rhine ran into thi moat and down it came the
pleasureseek in sledg on skate or afoot thei were dress
most of them in their best attir for the dai wa a holidai set apart
for a kind of skate carniv with sleigh match such game as
curl and other amus
among these merri folk might have been seen a young ladi of two or three
and twenti year of ag dress in a coat of dark green cloth trim
with fur and closefit at the waist thi coat open in front
show a broider woollen skirt but over the bust it wa tightli
button and surmount by a stiff ruff of brussel lace upon her head
she wore a highcrown beaver hat to which the nod ostrich feather
wa fasten by a jewel ornament of suffici valu to show that she
wa a person of some mean in fact thi ladi wa the onli child of a
sea captain and shipown name carolu van hout who whilst still a
middleag man had di about a year befor leav her heiress to a
veri consider fortun thi circumst with the ad advantag
of a veri pretti face in which were set two deep and thought grei
ey and a figur more grace than wa common among the netherland
women caus lysbeth van hout to be much sought after and admir
especi by the marriag bachelor of leyden
on thi occas howev she wa unescort except by a serv woman
somewhat older than herself a nativ of brussel greta by name who in
appear wa as attract as in manner she wa suspici discreet
as lysbeth skate down the canal toward the moat mani of the good
burgher of leyden took off their cap to her especi the young
burgher on or two of whom had hope that she would choos them to be
her cavali for thi dai fete some of the elder also ask her
if she would care to join their parti think that as she wa
an orphan without near male relat she might be glad of their
protect in time when it wa wise for beauti young women to be
protect with thi excus and that howev she escap from them
all for lysbeth had alreadi made her own arrang
at that date there wa live in leyden a young man of four or five and
twenti name dirk van goorl a distant cousin of her own dirk wa a
nativ of the littl town of alkmaar and the second son of on of it
lead citizen a brass founder by trade as in the natur cours of
event the alkmaar busi would descend to hi elder brother their
father appoint him to a leyden firm in which after eight or nine
year of hard work he had becom a junior partner while he wa still
live lysbeth father had taken a like to the lad with the result
that he grew intim at the hous which from the first wa open
to him as a kinsman after the death of carolu van hout dirk had
continu to visit there especi on sundai when he wa duli and
ceremoni receiv by lysbeth aunt a childless widow name clara
van ziel who act as her guardian thu by degre favour with
such ampl opportun a strong affect had sprung up between these
two young peopl although as yet thei were not affianc nor inde
had either of them said a word of open love to the other
thi abstin mai seem strang but some explan of their
selfrestraint wa to be found in dirk charact in mind he wa
patient veri deliber in form hi purpos and veri sure in
carri them out he felt impuls like other men but he did not
give wai to them for two year or more he had love lysbeth but be
somewhat slow at read the wai of women he wa not quit certain
that she love him and abov everyth on earth he dread a rebuff
moreov he knew her to be an heiress and as hi own mean were still
humbl and hi expect from hi father small he did not feel
justifi in ask her in marriag until hi posit wa more assur
had the captain carolu still been live the case would have been
differ for then he could have gone to him but he wa dead and
dirk fine and sensit natur recoil from the thought that it might
be said of him that he had taken advantag of the inexperi of a
kinswoman in order to win her fortun also deep down in hi mind he had
a sincer and quit secret reason for retic whereof more in it
proper place
thu matter stood between these two todai howev though onli with
diffid and after some encourag from the ladi he had ask
leav to be hi cousin cavali at the ic fete and when she
consent readili enough appoint the moat as their place of meet
thi wa somewhat less than lysbeth expect for she wish hi escort
through the town but when she hint as much dirk explain that he
would not be abl to leav the work befor three oclock as the metal
for a larg bell had been run into the cast and he must watch it
while it cool
so follow onli by her maid greta lysbeth glide lightli as a bird
down the ic path on to the moat and across it through the narrow
cut to the frozen mere beyond where the sport were to be held and the
race run there the scene wa veri beauti
behind her lai the roof of leyden point picturesqu and cover
with sheet of snow while abov them tower the bulk of the two great
church of st peter and st pancra and stand on a mound known as
the burg the round tower which is suppos to have been built by the
roman in front stretch the flat expans of white meadow broken
here and there by windmil with narrow waist and thin tall sail and
in the distanc by the church tower of other town and villag
immedi befor her in strang contrast to thi lifeless landscap
lai the peopl mere fring around with dead reed stand so still
in the frosti air that thei might have been paint thing on thi mere
half the popul of leyden seem to be gather at least there were
thousand of them shout laugh and skim to and fro in their
bright garment like flock of gayplumag bird among them drawn
by hors with bell ti to their har glide mani sledg of
wickerwork and wood mount upon iron runner their foreend fashion
to quaint shape such as the head of dog or bull or triton then
there were vendor of cake and sweetmeat vendor of spirit also who
did a good trade on thi cold dai beggar too were numer and among
them deform who nowadai would be hidden in charit home
slid about in wooden box which thei push along with crutch
lastli mani loafer had gather there with stool for fine ladi to
sit on while the skate were bound to their pretti feet and chapmen
with these articl for sale and strap wherewith to fasten them to
complet the pictur the huge red ball of the sun wa sink to the
west and opposit to it the pale full moon began alreadi to gather
light and life
the scene seem so charm and so happi that lysbeth who wa young
and now that she had recov from the shock of her belov father
death lightheart ceas her forward movement and pois herself
upon her skate to watch it for a space while she stood thu a littl
apart a woman came toward her from the throng not as though she were
seek her but aimlessli much as a child toyboat is driven by
light contrari wind upon the summer surfac of a pond
she wa a remarkablelook woman of about thirtyf year of ag
tall and boni in make with deepset ey light grei of colour that
seem now to flash fierc and now to waver as though in memori of
some great dread from beneath a coars woollen cap a wisp of grizzl
hair fell across the forehead where it lai like the forelock of
a hors inde the high cheekbon scar as though by burn
widespread nostril and promin white teeth whenc the lip had
strang sunk awai gave the whole counten a more or less equin
look which thi fall lock seem to heighten for the rest the woman
wa poorli and not too plentifulli clad in a gown of black woollen torn
and stain as though with long us and journei while on her feet she
wore wooden clog to which were strap skate that were not fellow
on be much longer than the other
opposit to lysbeth thi strang gaunt person stop contempl
her with a dreami ey present she seem to recognis her for she
said in a quick low voic the voic of on who live in terror of
be overheard
that a pretti dress of your van hout daughter oh ye i know
you your father us to plai with me when i wa a child and onc he
kiss me on the ic at just such a fete as thi think of it kiss
me martha the mare and she laugh hoars and went on ye
wellwarm and wellf and without doubt wait for a gallant to
kiss you here she turn and wave her hand toward the peopleal
wellwarm and wellf and all with lover and husband and children
to kiss but i tell you van hout daughter as i have dare to creep
from my hide hole in the great lake to tell all of them who will
listen that unless thei cast out the curs spaniard a dai shall come
when the folk of leyden must perish by thousand of hunger behind
those wall ye ye unless thei cast out the curs spaniard and hi
inquisit oh i know him i know him for did thei not make me carri
my own husband to the stake upon my back and have you heard why van
hout daughter becaus what i had suffer in their tortureden had
made my facey mine that onc wa so beautifullik the face of a
hors and thei said that a hors ought to be ridden
now while thi poor excit creatur on of a whole class of such
peopl who in those sad dai might be found wander about the
netherland crazi with their grief and suffer and live onli for
reveng pour out these broken sentenc lysbeth terrifi shrank
back befor her as she shrank the other follow till present
lysbeth saw her express of rage and hate chang to on of terror in
anoth instant mutter someth about a request for alm which she
did not wait to receiv the woman had wheel round and fled awai as
fast as her skate would carri herwhich wa veri fast inde
turn about to find what had frighten her lysbeth saw stand on
the bank of the mere so close that she must have overheard everi word
but behind the screen of a leafless bush a tall forbiddinglook
woman who held in her hand some broider cap which appar she wa
offer for sale these cap she began to slowli fold up and place on
by on in a hide satchel that wa hung about her shoulder all thi
while she wa watch lysbeth with her keen black ey except when
from time to time she took them off her to follow the flight of that
person who had call herself the mare
you keep ill compani ladi said the capsel in a harsh voic
it wa none of my seek answer lysbeth astonish into make a
repli
so much the better for you ladi although she seem to know you and
to know also that you would listen to her song unless my ey deceiv
me which is not often that woman is an evildo and a worker of magic
like her dead husband van muyden a heret a blasphem of the holi
church a traitor to our lord the emperor and on she ad with a
snarl with a price upon her head that befor night will i hope be
in black meg pocket then walk with long firm step toward a fat
man who seem to be wait for her the tall blackei pedlar pass
with him into the throng where lysbeth lost sight of them
lysbeth watch them go and shiver to her knowledg she had never
seen thi woman befor but she knew enough of the time thei live in
to be sure that she wa a spy of the priest alreadi there were such
creatur move about in everi gather ye and in mani a privat
place who were paid to obtain evid against suspect heret
whether thei won it by fair mean or by foul matter not provid
thei could find someth and it need be littl inde to justifi the
inquisit in get to it work
as for the other woman the mare doubtless she wa on of those wick
outcast accurs by god and man who were call heret peopl who
said dread thing about the pope and the church and god priest
have been misl and stir up thereto by a certain fiend in human
form name luther lysbeth shudder at the thought and cross herself
for in those dai she wa an excel cathol yet the wander said
that she had known her father so that she must be as well born as
herselfand then that dread storyno she could not bear to think
of it but of cours heret deserv all these thing of that there
could be no doubt whatev for had not her father confessor told her
that thu alon might their soul be save from the grasp of the evil
on
the thought wa comfort still lysbeth felt upset and not a littl
rejoic when she saw dirk van goorl skate toward her accompani by
anoth young man also a cousin of her own on her mother side who
wa destin in dai to come to earn himself an immort renownyoung
pieter van de werff the two took off their bonnet to her dirk van
goorl reveal in the act a head of fair hair beneath which hi steadi
blue ey shone in a rather thickset selfcontain face lysbeth
temper alwai somewhat quick wa ruffl and she show it in her
manner
i thought cousin that we were to meet at three and the kirk clock
yonder ha just chime halfpast she said address them both but
lookingnot too sweetlyat dirk van goorl
that right cousin answer pieter a pleasantfac and alert
young man look at him scold him for he is to blame ever sinc a
quarter past two have ii who must drive a sledg in the great race and
am back to winbeen wait outsid that factori in the snow but
upon my honour he did not appear until seven minut sinc ye we
have done the whole distanc in seven minut and i call that veri good
skate
i thought as much said lysbeth dirk can onli keep an appoint
with a church bell or a stadhui chandeli
it wa not my fault broke in dirk in hi slow voic i have my
busi to attend i promis to wait until the metal had cool
suffici and hot bronz take no account of iceparti and sledg
race
so i suppos that you stop to blow on it cousin well the result
is that be quit unescort i have been oblig to listen to thing
which i did not wish to hear
what do you mean ask dirk take fire at onc
then she told them someth of what the woman who call herself the
mare had said to her ad doubtless the poor creatur is a heret
and deserv all that ha happen to her but it is dreadfulli sad and
i came here to enjoi myself not to be sad
between the two young men there pass a glanc which wa full of
mean but it wa dirk who spoke the other more cautiou remain
silent
why do you sai that cousin lysbeth he ask in a new voic a voic
thick and eager why do you sai that she deserv all that can happen
to her i have heard of thi poor creatur who is call mother martha
or the mare although i have never seen her myself she wa nobleborn
much better born than ani of us three and veri faironc thei call
her the lili of brusselswhen she wa the vrouw van muyden and she ha
suffer dreadfulli for on reason onli becaus she and her did not
worship god as you worship him
as we worship him broke in van de werff with a cough
no answer dirk sullenli as our cousin lysbeth van hout worship
him for that reason onli thei kill her husband and her littl son
and drove her mad so that she live among the reed of the haarlem
meer like a beast in it den ye thei the spaniard and their spanish
priest as i daresai that thei will kill us also
dont you think that it is get rather cold stand here
interrupt pieter van de werff befor she could answer look the
sledg race ar just begin come cousin give me your hand and
take lysbeth by the arm he skate off into the throng follow at a
distanc by dirk and the servingmaid greta
cousin he whisper as he went thi is not my place it is dirk
place but i prai you as you love himi beg your pardona you esteem
a worthi relativedo not enter into a religi argument with him here
in public where even the ic and sky ar two great ear it is not
safe littl cousin i swear to you that it is not safe
in the centr of the mere the great event of the dai the sledg race
were now in progress as the competitor were mani these must be run in
heat the winner of each heat stand on on side to compet in the
final contest now these victor had a pretti prerog not unlik
that accord to certain dancer in the cotillion of modern dai each
driver of a sledg wa bound to carri a passeng in the littl car in
front of him hi own place be on the seat behind whenc he direct
the hors by mean of rein support upon a guiderod so fashion
that it lift them abov the head of the travel in the car thi
passeng he could select from among the number of ladi who were
present at the game unless inde the gentleman in charg of her
chose to deni him in set form name by step forward and sai in
the appoint phrase no for thi happi hour she is mine
among the winner of these heat wa a certain spanish offic the
count don juan de montalvo who as it chanc in the absenc on
leav of hi captain wa at that date the command of the garrison at
leyden he wa a man still young onli about thirti inde report to
be of nobl birth and handsom in the usual castilian fashion that is
to sai he wa tall of a grace figur darkei strongfeatur
with a somewhat humor express and of veri good if exagger
address as he had but recent come to leyden veri littl wa known
about thi attract cavali beyond that he wa well spoken of by the
priest and accord to report a favourit with the emperor also the
ladi admir him much
for the rest everyth about him wa handsom like hi person as might
be expect in the case of a man reput to be as rich as he wa nobl
thu hi sledg wa shape and colour to resembl a great black wolf
rear itself up to charg the wooden head wa cover in wolf skin
and adorn by ey of yellow glass and great fang of ivori round the
neck also ran a gild collar hung with a silver shield whereon were
paint the arm of it owner a knight strike the chain from off a
captiv christian saint and the motto of the montalvo trust to god
and me hi black hors too of the best breed import from spain
glitter in har decor with gild and bore a splendid plume
of dy feather rise from the headband
lysbeth happen to be stand near to the spot where thi gallant had
halt after hi first victori she wa in the compani of dirk van goorl
alonefor as he wa the driver of on of the compet sledg her
other cousin pieter van de werff had now been summon awai have
noth els to do at the moment she approach and not unnatur
admir thi brilliant equipag although in truth it wa the sledg and
the hors rather than their driver which attract her attent as for
the count himself she knew him slightli have been introduc to and
danc a measur with him at a festiv given by a grande of the town
on that occas he wa courteou to her in the spanish fashion rather
too courteou she thought but as thi wa the manner of castilian
don when deal with burgher maiden she paid no more attent to the
matter
the captain montalvo saw lysbeth among the throng and recognis her
for he lift hi plume hat and bow to her with just that touch of
condescens which in those dai a spaniard show when greet
on whom he consid hi inferior in the sixteenth centuri it wa
understood that all the world were the inferior to those whom god
had grant to be born in spain the english who rate themselv at
a valuat of their ownand were care to announc the factalon
except
an hour or so later after the last heat had been run a steward of the
ceremoni call aloud to the remain competitor to select their
passeng and prepar for the final contest accordingli each jehu
leav hi hors in charg of an attend step up to some young
ladi who evid wa wait for him and led her by the hand to hi
sledg while lysbeth wa watch thi ceremoni with amusementfor
these select were alwai understood to show a strong prefer
on behalf of the chooser for the chosensh wa astonish to hear a
welltrain voic address her and on look up to see don juan de
montalvo bow almost to the ic
senora he said in castilian a tongu which lysbeth understood
well enough although she onli spoke it when oblig unless my ear
deceiv me i heard you admir my hors and sledg now with the
permiss of your cavali and he bow courteous to dirk i name
you as my passeng for the great race know that you will bring me
fortun have i your leav senor
now if there wa a peopl on earth whom dirk van goorl hate the
spaniard were that peopl and if there live a cavali who he would
prefer should not take hi cousin lysbeth for a lone drive that
cavali wa the count juan de montalvo but as a young man dirk wa
singularli diffid and so easili confus that on the spur of the
moment it wa quit possibl for a person of address to make him sai
what he did not mean thu on the present occas when he saw thi
courtli spaniard bow low to him a humbl dutch tradesman he wa
overwhelm and mumbl in repli certainli certainli
if a glanc could have wither him without doubt dirk would
immedi have been shrivel to noth to sai that lysbeth wa
angri is too littl for in truth she wa absolut furiou she did
not like thi spaniard and hate the idea of a long interview with him
alon moreov she knew that among her fellow townspeopl there wa a
great desir that the count should not win thi race which in it
own fashion wa the event of the year wherea if she appear as hi
companion it would be suppos that she wa anxiou for hi success
lastlyand thi wa the chiefest sorealthough in theori the
competitor had a right to ask ani on to whom thei took a fanci to
travel in their sledg in practis thei onli sought the compani of
young women with whom thei were on the best of term and who were
alreadi warn of their intent
in an instant these thought flash through her mind but all she did
wa to murmur someth about the heer van goorl
ha alreadi given hi consent like an unselfish gentleman broke in
captain juan tender her hi hand
now without absolut make a scene which then as todai ladi
consid an illbr thing to do there wa no escap sinc half
leyden gather at these sledg choos and mani ey were on her
and the count therefor becaus she must lysbeth took the profer
hand and wa led to the sledg catch as she pass to it through
the throng more than on sour look from the men and more than on
exclam of surpris real or affect on the lip of the ladi
of her acquaint these manifest howev put her upon her
mettl so determin that at least she would not look sullen or
ridicul she began to enter into the spirit of the adventur and
smile gracious while the captain montalvo wrap a magnific apron
of wolf skin about her knee
when all wa readi her chariot took the rein and settl himself
upon the littl seat behind the sleigh which wa then led into line by
a soldier servant
where is the cours senor lysbeth ask hope that it would be a
short on
but in thi she wa to be disappoint for he answer
up to the littl quarkel mere round the island in the middl of it
and back to thi spot someth over a leagu in all now senora
speak to me no more at present but hold fast and have no fear for at
least i drive well and my hors is surefoot and rough for ic
thi is a race that i would give a hundr gold piec to win sinc
your countrymen who contend against me have sworn that i shall lose
it and i tell you at onc senora that grei hors will press me hard
follow the direct of hi glanc lysbeth ey lit upon the next
sledg it wa small fashion and paint to resembl a grei badger
that silent stubborn and if molest savag brute which will not
loos it grip until the head is hack from off it bodi the hors
which match it well in colour wa of flemish breed rather a
rawbon anim with strong quarter and an ugli head but renown in
leyden for it courag and stai power what interest lysbeth most
howev wa to discov that the chariot wa none other than pieter
van de werff though now when she thought of it she rememb he
had told her that hi sledg wa name the badger in hi choic of
passeng she note too not without a smile that he show hi
cautiou charact disdain of ani immedi glori so long as the
end in view could be attain for there in the sleigh sat no fine young
ladi deck out in brave attir who might be suppos to look at him
with tender ey but a littl fairhair mate ag nine who wa in
fact hi sister as he explain afterward the rule provid that a
ladi passeng must be carri but said noth of her ag and weight
now the competitor eight of them were in a line and come forward
the master of the cours in a voic that everi on might hear call
out the condit of the race and the prize for which it wa to be
run a splendid glass goblet engrav with the crosskei the arm of
leyden thi done after ask if all were readi he drop a littl
flag whereon the hors were loos and awai thei went
befor a minut had pass forget all her doubt and annoy
lysbeth wa lost in the gloriou excit of the moment like bird
in the heaven cleav the keen crisp air thei sped forward over
the smooth ic the gai throng vanish the dead reed and stark bush
seem to fly awai from them the onli sound in their ear were the
rush of the wind the swish of the iron runner and the hollow
tap of the hoov of their gallop hors certain sledg drew
ahead in the first burst but the wolf and the badger were not among
these the count de montalvo wa hold in hi black stallion and as
yet the grei flemish geld loop along with a constrain and awkward
stride when pass from the littl mere thei enter the straight of
the canal these two were respect fourth and fifth up the cours
thei sped through a desert snowclad countri past the church of the
villag of alkemaad now half a mile or more awai appear the quarkel
mere and in the centr of it the island which thei must turn thei
reach it thei were round it and when their face were onc more set
homeward lysbeth note that the wolf and the badger were third and
fourth in the race some on have drop behind half a mile more and
thei were second and third anoth half mile and thei were first and
second with perhap a mile to go then the fight began
yard by yard the speed increas and yard by yard the black stallion
drew ahead now in front of them lai a furlong or more of bad ic
encumb with lump of frozen snow that had not been clear awai
which caus the sleigh to shake and jump as it struck lysbeth look
round
the badger is come up she said
montalvo heard and for the first time laid hi whip upon the haunch
of hi hors which answer gallantli but still the badger came up
the grei wa the stronger beast and had begun to put out hi strength
present hi ugli head wa behind them for lysbeth felt the breath
from hi nostril blow on her and saw their steam then it wa past
for the steam blew back into her face ye and she could see the eager
ey of the child in the grei sledg now thei were neck and neck and
the rough ic wa done with six hundr yard awai not more lai the
goal and all about them outsid the line of the cours were swift
skater travel so fast that their head were bent forward and down
to within three feet of the ic
van de werff call to hi hors and the grei began to gain montalvo
lash the stallion and onc more thei pass him but the black wa
fail and he saw it for lysbeth heard him curs in spanish then of
a sudden after a cun glanc at hi adversari the count pull upon
the right rein and a shrill voic rose upon the air the voic of the
littl girl in the other sledg
take care brother it cri he will overthrow us
true enough in anoth moment the black would have struck the grei
sidewai lysbeth saw van de werff rise from hi seat and throw hi
weight backward drag the grei on to hi haunch by an inchnot
moreth wolf sleigh miss the geld inde on runner of it
struck hi hoof and the high wood work of the side brush and cut hi
nostril
a foul a foul yell the skater and it wa over onc more thei
were speed forward but now the black had a lead of at least ten
yard for the grei must find hi stride again thei were in the
straight the cours wa line with hundr of wit and from the
throat of everi on of them aros a great cry or rather two cri
the spaniard the spaniard win said the first cry that wa answer
by anoth and a deeper roar
no holland the holland the holland come up
then in the midst of the fierc excitementbr of the excit
perhapssom curiou spell fell upon the mind of lysbeth the race it
detail it object it surround fade awai these physic
thing were gone and in place of them wa present a dream a spiritu
interpret such as the omen and influenc of the time she live
in might well inspir what did she seem to see
she saw the spaniard and the holland strive for victori but not a
victori of hors she saw the black spanish wolf at first triumphant
outmatch the netherland badger still the badger the dog dutch
badger held on
who would win the fierc beast or the patient beast who would be the
master in thi fight there wa death in it look the whole snow wa

of the sunset thei seem bath in blood while about her the shout of
the backer and faction transform themselv into a fierc cry as
of battl peopl all voic mingl in that cryvoic of hope of
agoni and of despair but she could not interpret them someth told
her that the interpret and the issu were in the mind of god alon
perhap she swoon perhap she slept and dream thi dream perhap
the sharp rush air overcam her at the least lysbeth ey close
and her mind gave wai when thei open and it return again their
sledg wa rush past the win post but in front of it travel
anoth sledg drawn by a gaunt grei hors which gallop so hard
that it belli seem to lie upon the ic a hors driven by a young man
whose face wa set like steel and whose lip were as the lip of a trap
could that be the face of her cousin pieter van de werff and if so
what passion had stamp that strang seal thereon she turn herself
in her seat and look at him who drove her

what it wa it wa the veri type and incarn of the spanish wolf

then lysbeth knew that it wa over and again the faint overpow

chapter ii
she who buyspai
when lysbeth mind recov from it confus she found herself still
in the sledg and beyond the border of the crowd that wa engag in
raptur congratul the winner drawn up alongsid of the wolf
wa anoth sleigh of plain make and har to it a heavi flemish
hors thi vehicl wa driven by a spanish soldier with whom sat a
second soldier appar of the rank of sergeant there wa no on
els near alreadi peopl in the netherland had learnt to keep their
distanc from spanish soldier
if your excel would come now the sergeant wa sai thi
littl matter can be settl without ani further troubl
where is she ask montalvo
not more than a mile or so awai near the place call steen veld
tie her up in the snow to wait till tomorrow morn my hors is
tire and it mai save us troubl he began then ad after glanc
back at the crowd behind him and next at lysbeth no i will come
perhap the count did not wish to listen to condol on hi defeat
or perhap he desir to prolong the teteatet with hi fair
passeng at ani rate without further hesit he struck hi weari
hors with the whip caus it to ambl forward somewhat stiffli but at
a good pace
where ar we go senor ask lysbeth anxious the race is over
and i must seek my friend
your friend ar engag in congratul the victor ladi he
answer in hi suav and courteou voic and i cannot leav you alon
upon the ic do not troubl thi is onli a littl matter of busi
which will scarc take a quarter of an hour and onc more he struck
the hors urg it to a better speed
lysbeth thought of remonstr she thought even of spring from the
sledg but in the end she did neither to seem to continu the drive
with her cavali would she determin look more natur and less
absurd than to attempt a violent escap from him she wa certain that
he would not put her down mere at her request someth in hi manner
told her so and though she had no long for hi compani it wa
better than be made ridicul befor half the inhabit of leyden
moreov the posit wa no fault of her it wa the fault of dirk
van goorl who should have been present to take her from the sledg
as thei drove along the frozen moat montalvo leant forward and began to
chat about the race express regret at have lost it but us no
angri or bitter word could thi be the man wonder lysbeth as
she listen whom she had seen deliber attempt to overthrow hi
adversari in a foul heedless of dishonour or of who might be kill by
the shock could thi be the man whose face just now had look like
the face of a devil had these thing happen inde or wa it not
possibl that her fanci confus with the excit and the speed at
which thei were travel had deceiv her certainli it seem to
have been overcom at last for she could not rememb the actual finish
of the race or how thei got clear of the shout crowd
while she wa still wonder thu repli from time to time to
montalvo in monosyl the sledg in front of them turn the corner
of on of the eastern bastion and came to a halt the place where it
stop wa desol and lone for the town be in a state of peac
no guard wa mount on the wall nor could ani live soul be found
upon the snowi wast that lai beyond the moat at first inde lysbeth
wa abl to see nobodi at all for by now the sun had gone down and her
ey were not accustom to the increas light of the moon present
howev she caught sight of a knot of peopl stand on the ic in a
recess or littl bai of the moat and half hidden by a fring of dead
reed
montalvo saw also and halt hi hors within three pace of them
the peopl were five in number three spanish soldier and two women
lysbeth look and with difficulti stifl a cry of surpris and fear
for she knew the women the tall dark person with lower ey wa
none other than the capsel and spanish spy black meg and she who
crouch there upon the ic her arm bound behind her her grizzl
lock torn loos by some rough hand trail on the snowsur it
wa the woman who call herself the mare and who that veri afternoon
spoke to her sai that she had known her father and curs the
spaniard and their inquisit what were thei do here instantli an
answer leapt into her mind for she rememb black meg wordsthat
there wa a price upon thi heret head which befor nightfal
would be in her pocket and why wa there a squar hole cut in the
ic immedi in front of the captiv could it beno that wa too
horribl
well offic broke in montalvo address the sergeant in a quiet
weari voic what is all thi about set out your case
excel repli the man it is a veri simpl matter thi
creatur here so that woman is readi to take oath and he point to
black meg is a notori heret who ha alreadi been condemn to

point to black meg who wa the on who waylaid her pull her down
and held her till we came requir your certif in order that
she mai claim the reward from the treasur of the holi inquisit
therefor you will be ask to certifi that thi is inde the
notori heret commonli known as martha the mare but whose other

to the rest
you mean that she will be taken to the prison to be dealt with by the
holi offic queri montalvo
not exactli excel answer the sergeant with a discreet smile
and a cough the prison i am told is quit full but she mai start
for the prison andther seem to be a hole in the ic into which
sinc satan lead the footstep of such peopl astrai thi heret
might chanc to fallor throw herself
what is the evid ask montalvo
then black meg stood forward and with the rapid and unction of a
spy pour out her tale she identifi the woman with on whom she had
known who wa sentenc to death by the inquisit and escap and
after give other evid end by repeat the convers which
she had overheard between the accus and lysbeth that afternoon
you accompani me in a fortun hour senora van hout said the
captain gaili for now to satisfi myself as i wish to be just and do
not trust these paid hag and he nod toward black meg i must

tale and whether or no thi veri ugli person name the mare call down
curs upon my peopl and the holi offic answer and quickli if you

then for the first time the mare rais her head drag at her
hair which had becom frozen to the ic until she tore it free
lysbeth van hout she cri in shrill pierc tone would you to
pleas your spanish lover bring your father playmat to her death
the spanish hors is cold and cannot stai but the poor netherland
mareah she mai be thrust beneath the blue ic and bide there till her
bone rot at the bottom of the moat you have sought the spaniard you

cost you everyth not onli the bodi but the spirit also woe to you
lysbeth van hout if you cut me off befor my work is done i fear not
death nai i welcom it but i tell you i have work to do befor i die
now in an agoni of mind lysbeth turn and look at montalvo
the count wa a man of keen percept and understood it all lean
forward hi arm rest on the back of the sledg as though to
contempl the prison he whisper into lysbeth ear so low that
no on els could hear hi word
senora he said i have no wish in thi matter i do not desir to
drown that poor mad woman but if you confirm the spy stori drown
she must at present i am not satisfi so everyth turn upon your

whenev i choos to call upon you your door will be open to me though
i must remind you that on three occas alreadi when i have wish

lysbeth heard and understood if she would save thi woman life she
must expos herself to the attent of the spaniard which she desir
least of anyth in the world more speak upon her oath in the
presenc of god she must utter a dread lie she who as yet had never
li for thirti second or more she thought stare round her with
anguish ey while the scene thei fell on sank into her soul in such
fashion that never till her death dai did she forget it aspect
the mare spoke no more she onli knelt search her face with a stern
and wonder glanc a littl to the right stood black meg glare
at her sullenli for the bloodmonei wa in danger behind the prison
were two of the soldier on pat hi hand to hi face to hide
a yawn while the other beat hi breast to warm himself the third
soldier who wa place somewhat in front stir the surfac of the
hole with the shaft of hi halbert to break up the thin film of ic
which wa form over it while montalvo himself still lean
sidewai and forward watch her ey with an amus and cynic
express and over all over the desol snow and gabl roof of
the town behind over the smooth blue ic the martyr and the murder
over the gai sledg and the furwrap girl who sat within it fell the
calm light of the moon through a silenc broken onli by the beat of
her heart and now and again by the sigh of a frostwind breath among
the rush
well senora ask montalvo if you have suffici reflect
shall i administ the oath in the form provid
administ it she said hoars
so descend from the sledg he stood in front of lysbeth and
lift hi cap repeat the oath to her an oath strong enough to
blast her soul if she swore to it with fals intent
in the name of god the son and of hi bless mother you swear he
ask
i swear she answer
good senora now listen to me did you meet that woman thi
afternoon
ye i met her on the ic
and did she in your hear utter curs upon the govern and the
holi church and call upon you to assist in drive the spaniard from
the land as thi spy whom i believ is call black meg ha born
wit
no said lysbeth
i am afraid that is not quit enough senora i mai have misquot the
exact word did the woman sai anyth of the sort
for on second lysbeth hesit then she caught sight of the victim
watch specul ey and rememb that thi craze and broken
creatur onc had been a child whom her father had kiss and plai
with and that the crime of which she wa accus wa that she had
escap from death at the stake
the water is cold to die in the mare said in a medit voic as
though she were think aloud
then why did you run awai from the warm fire heret witch jeer
black meg
now lysbeth hesit no longer but again answer in a monosyl
no
then what did she do or sai senora
she said she had known my father who us to plai with her when she wa
a child and beg for alm that is all then that woman came up and
she ran awai whereon the woman said there wa a price upon her head
and that she meant to have the monei
it is a lie scream black meg in fierc strident tone
if that person will not be silent silenc her said montalvo
address the sergeant i am satisfi he went on that there is no
evid at all against the prison except the stori of a spy who sai
she believ her to be a vagrant heret of bad charact who escap
from the stake sever year ago in the neighbourhood of brussel
whither it is scarc worth while to send to inquir about the matter
so that charg mai drop there remain the question as to whether or
no the prison utter certain word thi afternoon which if she did
utter them ar undoubtedli worthi of the death that under my author
as act command of thi town i have power to inflict thi
question i foresaw and that is why i ask the senora to whom the
woman is alleg to have spoken the word to accompani me here to
give evid she ha done so and her evid on oath as against the
statement of a spy woman not on oath is that no such word were spoken
thi be so as the senora is a good cathol whom i have no reason to
disbeliev i order the releas of the prison whom for my part i take
for noth more than a crazi and harmless wander
at least you will detain her till i can prove that she is the heret
who escap from the stake near brussel shout black meg
i will do noth of the sort the prison here is overful alreadi
unti her arm and let her go
the soldier obei wonder somewhat and the mare scrambl to her
feet for a moment she stood look at her deliver then cry we
shall met again lysbeth van hout suddenli she turn and sped up a
dyke at extraordinari speed in a few second there wa noth to be
seen of her but a black spot upon the white landscap and present she
had vanish altogeth
gallop as you will mare i shall catch you yet scream black meg
after her and you too my pretti littl liar who have cheat me out
of a dozen florin wait till you ar up befor the inquisit as a
hereticfor that where youll end no fine spanish lover will save
you then so you have gone to the spanish have you and thrown over
your fatfac burgher well you will have enough of spaniard befor
you have done with them i can tell you
twice had montalvo tri to stop thi flood of furiou eloqu which
had becom person and might prove prejudici to hi interest but
without avail now he adopt other measur
seiz her he shout to two of the soldier that it now hold her
under water in that hole till i tell you to let her up again
thei obei but it took all three of them to carri out the order for
black meg fought and bit like a wild cat until at last she wa thrust
into the ici moat head downward when at length she wa releas
soak and shiver she crept off silent enough but the look of
furi which she cast at montalvo and lysbeth drew from the captain a
remark that perhap it would have been as well to have kept her under
water two minut longer
now sergeant he ad in a genial voic it is a cold night
and thi ha been a troublesom busi for a feastdai so here
someth for you and your watch to warm yourselv with when you go off
duti and he hand him what in those dai wa a veri handsom present
by the wai he said as the men salut him gratefulli perhap you
will do me a favour it is onli to take thi black hors of mine to hi
stabl and har that grei trooper nag to the sledg instead as i
wish to go the round of the moat and my beast is tire
again the men salut and set to work to chang the hors whereon
lysbeth guess her cavali purpos turn as though to fly awai
for her skate were still upon her feet but he wa watch
senora he said in a quiet voic i think that you gave me the
promis of your compani for the rest of thi even and i am certain
he ad with a slight bow that you ar a ladi whom noth would
induc to tell an untruth had i not been sure of that i should scarc
have accept your evid so readili just now
lysbeth winc visibl i thought senor that you were go to return
to the fete
i do not rememb sai so senora and as a matter of fact i have
picket to visit do not be afraid the drive is charm in thi
moonlight and afterward perhap you will extend your hospit so
far as to ask me to supper at your hous
still she hesit dismai written on her face
jufvrouw lysbeth he said in an alter voic in my countri we
have a home proverb which sai she who bui pai you have bought
andth good have been deliv do you understand ah allow me to
have the pleasur of arrang those fur i knew that you were the soul
of honour and were butshal we sai teas me otherwis had you
realli wish to go of cours you would have skate awai just now
while you had the opportun that is why i gave it you as natur i
should not desir to detain you against your will
lysbeth heard and wa aghast for thi man clever overwhelm her
at everi step he contriv to put her in the wrong moreov she wa
crush by the sens that he had justic on hi side she had bought
and she must pai why had she bought not for ani advantag of her
own but from an impuls of human pityto save a fellow creatur
life and why should she have perjur herself so deepli in order to
save that life she wa a cathol and had no sympathi with such peopl
probabl thi person wa an anabaptist on of that dread sect which
practis nameless immor and ran strip through the street
cry that thei were the nake truth wa it then becaus the
creatur had declar that she had known her father in her childhood
to some extent ye but wa not there more behind had she not been
influenc by the woman invoc about the spaniard of which the
true mean came home to her dure that dread sledg race at the
moment inde when she saw the satan look upon the face of montalvo
it seem to her that thi wa so though at the time she had not
understood it it seem to her that she wa not a free agent that some
forc push her forward which she could neither control nor understand
moreoverand thi wa the worst of itsh felt that littl good could
come of her sacrific or that if good came at least it would not be
to her or her now she wa as a fish in a net though why it wa worth
thi brilliant spaniard while to snare her she could not understand
for she forgot that she wa beauti and a woman of properti well
to save the blood of anoth she had bought and in her own blood and
happi or in that of those dear to her assuredli she must pai
howev cruel and unjust might be the price
such were the thought that pass through lysbeth mind as the strong
flemish geld lumber forward drag the sledg at the same steadi
pace over rough ic and smooth and all the while montalvo behind her
wa chat pleasantli about thi matter and that tell her of
the orang grove in spain of the court of the emperor charl
of adventur in the french war and mani other thing to which
convers she made such answer as courtesi demand and no more
what would dirk think she wa wonder and her cousin pieter van de
werff whose good opinion she valu and all the gossip of leyden she
onli prai that thei might not have miss her or at least that thei
took it for grant that she had gone home
on thi point howev she wa soon destin to be undeceiv for
present trudg over the snowcov ic and carri hi useless
skate in hi hand thei met a young man whom she knew as dirk fellow
apprentic on see them he stop in front of the sledg in such a
posit that the hors a steadi and a patient anim pull up of it
own accord
is the jufvrouw lysbeth van hout there he ask anxious
ye she repli but befor she could sai more montalvo broke in
inquir what might be the matter
noth he answer except that she wa lost and dirk van goorl my
friend send me to look for her thi wai while he took the other
inde then nobl sir perhap you will find the heer dirk van goorl
and tell him that the senora hi cousin is mere enjoi an even
drive and that if he come to her hous in an hour time he will find
her safe and sound and with her myself the count juan de montalvo
whom she ha honour with an invit to supper
then befor the astonish messeng could answer befor inde
lysbeth could offer ani explan of hi word montalvo lash up
the hors and left him stand on the moat bewild hi cap off and
scratch hi head
after thi thei proceed on a journei which seem to lysbeth almost
intermin when the circuit of the wall wa finish montalvo
halt at on of the shut gate and call to the guard within
summon them to open thi caus delai and investig for at
first the sergeant of the guard would not believ that it wa hi act
command who spoke without
pardon excel he said when he had inspect him with a lantern
but i did not think that you would be go the round with a ladi
in your sledg and hold up the light the man took a long look at
lysbeth grin visibl as he recognis her
ah he is a gai bird the captain a veri gai bird and it a pretti
dutch dickei he is teach to pipe now she heard him call to a
comrad as he close the heavi gate behind their sleigh
then follow more visit to other militari post in the town and with
each visit a further explan all thi while the count montalvo
utter no word beyond those of ordinari compliment and ventur on
no act of familiar hi convers and demeanour inde remain
perfectli courteou and respect so far as it went thi wa
satisfactori but at length there came a moment when lysbeth felt that
she could bear the posit no longer
senor she said briefli take me home i grow faint
with hunger doubtless he interrupt well by heaven so do i but
my dear ladi as you ar awar duti must be attend to and after
all you mai have found some interest in accompani me on a tour of
the picket at night i know your peopl speak roughli of us spanish
soldier but i hope that after thi you will be abl to bear testimoni
to their disciplin although it is a fete dai you will be my wit
that we have not found a man off duti or the wors for drink here
you he call to a soldier who stood up to salut him follow me to
the hous of the jufvrouw lysbeth van hout where i sup and lead thi
sledg back to my quarter
chapter iii
montalvo win a trick
turn up the bree straat then as now perhap the finest in the town
of leyden montalvo halt hi hors befor a substanti hous front
with three roundhead gabl of which the largestthat over the
entranc in the middlewa shape into two window with balconi thi
wa lysbeth hous which had been left to her by her father where
until such time as she should pleas to marri she dwelt with her aunt
clara van ziel the soldier whom he had summon have run to the
hors head montalvo leapt from hi driver seat to assist the ladi
to alight at the moment lysbeth wa occupi with wild idea of swift
escap but even if she could make up her mind to try it there wa an
obstacl which her thought cavali had foreseen
jufvrouw van hout he said as he pull up do you rememb that you
ar still wear skate
it wa true though in her agit she had forgotten all about them
and the fact put sudden flight out of the question she could not
struggl into her own hous walk on the side of her feet like the
tame seal which old fisherman han had brought from northern sea it
would be too ridicul and the servant would certainli tell the stori
all about the town better for a while longer to put up with the compani
of thi odiou spaniard than to becom a laugh stock in an attempt to
fly besid even if she found herself on the other side of it could
she shut the door in hi face would her promis let her and would he
consent
ye she answer briefli i will call my servant
then for the first time the count becam complimentari in a dignifi
spanish manner
let no baseborn menial hold the foot which it is an honour for an
hidalgo of spain to touch i am your servant he said and rest on
knee on the snowcov step he wait
again there wa noth to be done so lysbeth must need thrust out her
foot from which veri delic and carefulli he unstrap the skate
what jack can bear jill must put up with mutter lysbeth to herself
as she advanc the other foot just at that moment howev the door
behind them began to open
she who bui murmur montalvo as he commenc on the second set of
strap then the door swung wide and the voic of dirk van goorl wa
heard sai in a tone of relief
ye sure enough it is she tant clara and some on is take off her
boot
skate senor skate interrupt montalvo glanc backward over
hi shoulder then ad in a whisper as he bent onc more to hi task
ahempai you will introduc me is it not so i think it will be
less awkward for you
so as flight wa imposs for he held her by the foot and an
instinct told her that especi to the man she love the onli thing
to do wa to make light of the affair lysbeth said
dirk cousin dirk i think you knowthi isth honour captain
the count juan de montalvo
ah it is the senor van goorl said montalvo pull off the skate
and rise from hi knee which from hi excess of courtesi wa now
wet through senor allow me to return to you safe and sound the fair
ladi of whom i have rob you for a while
for a while captain blurt dirk why from first to last she
ha been gone nearli four hour and a fine state we have been in about
her
that will all be explain present senorat supper to which the
jufvrouw ha been so courteou as to ask me then asid and below hi
breath again the omin word of reminderpai most happili
your cousin presenc wa the mean of save a fellowcreatur life
but as i have said the tale is long senorpermit and in anoth
second lysbeth found herself walk down her own hall upon the arm of
the spaniard while dirk her aunt and some guest follow obedi
behind
now montalvo knew that hi difficulti were over for that even at
ani rate sinc he had cross the threshold and wa a guest
half unconsci lysbeth guid him to the balconi sitkam on
the first floor which in our dai would answer to the drawingroom here
sever other of her friend were gather for it had been arrang
that the icefestiv should end with a supper as rich as the hous
could give to these too she must introduc her cavali who bow
courteous to each in turn then she escap but as she pass him
distinctli she could swear did she see hi lip shape themselv to
the hate wordpai
when she reach her chamber so great wa lysbeth wrath and
indign that almost she choke with it till again reason came to
her aid and with reason a desir to carri the thing off as well as
might be so she told her maid greta to robe her in her best garment
and to hang about her neck the famou collar of pearl which her father
had brought from the east that wa the talk and envi of half the women
in leyden on her head too she place the cap of love lace which had
been a wed gift to her mother by her grandmoth the old dame who
wove it then she ad such golden ornament as it wa customari for
women of her class of wear and descend to the gather room
meanwhil montalvo had not been idl take dirk asid and plead
hi travelworn condit he had prai him to lead him to some room
where he might order hi dress and person dirk compli though with
an ill grace but so pleasant did montalvo make himself dure those few
minut that befor he usher him back to the compani in some wai dirk
found himself convinc that thi particular spaniard wa not as the
sai went as black as hi mustachio he felt almost sure too
although he had not yet found time to tell him the detail of it that
there wa some excel reason to account for hi have carri off
the ador lysbeth dure an entir afternoon and even
it is true that there still remain the strang circumst of the
attempt foul of hi cousin van de werff sledg in the great race
but after all why should there not be some explan of thi also
it had happen if it did happen at quit a distanc from the win
post when there were few peopl to see what pass inde now that
he came to think of it the onli real evid on the matter wa that
of hi cousin the littl girl passeng sinc van de werff himself had
brought no actual accus against hi oppon
shortli after thei return to the compani it wa announc that supper
had been serv whereon ensu a paus it wa broken by montalvo who
step forward offer hi hand to lysbeth sai in a voic that
all could hear
ladi my companion of the race permit the humblest repres of
the greatest monarch in the world to have an honour which doubtless that
monarch would be glad to claim
that settl the matter for as the act command of the spanish
garrison of leyden had chosen to refer to hi offici posit it wa
imposs to question hi right of preced over a number of folk
who although promin in their wai were but unennobl netherland
burgher
lysbeth inde did find courag to point to a rather flurri and
spasmod ladi with grei hair who wa fan herself as though the
season were juli and wonder whether the cook would come up to the
grand spaniard expect and to murmur my aunt but she got no
further for the count instantli ad in a low voic
doubtless come next in the direct line but unless my educ ha
been neglect the heiress of the hous who is of ag goe befor the
collateralhowev ag
by thi time thei were through the door so it wa useless to argu the
point further and again lysbeth felt herself overmatch and submit
in anoth minut thei had pass down the stair enter the dine
hall and were seat side by side at the head of the long tabl of
which the foot wa occupi present by dirk van goorl and her aunt
who wa also hi cousin the widow clara van ziel
there wa a silenc while the domest began their servic of which
montalvo took opportun to studi the room the tabl and the guest
it wa a fine room panel with german oak and light suffici
if not brilliantli by two hang brass chandeli of the famou
flemish workmanship in each of which were fix eighteen of the best
candl while on the sideboard were branch candlestick also of
work brass the light thu provid wa supplement by that from
the great fire of peat and old ship timber which burn in a
wide bluetil fireplac half wai down the chamber throw it
reflect upon mani a flagon and bowl of cunningli hammer silver
that adorn the tabl and the sideboard
the compani wa of the same charact as the furnitur handsom and
solid peopl of mean everi man and woman of them accumul
by themselv or their father in the exercis of the honest and
profit trade whereof at thi time the netherland had a practic
monopoli
i have made no mistak thought montalvo to himself as he survei
the room and it occup my littl neighbour necklac alon is
worth more cash than ever i had the handl of and the plate would add
up handsom well befor veri long i hope to be in a posit to make
it inventori then have first cross himself devoutli he fell to
upon a supper that wa well worth hi attent even in a land note
for the luxuri of it food and wine and the superb appetit of those
who consum them
it must not be suppos howev that the gallant captain allow
eat to strangl convers on the contrari find that hi
hostess wa in no talk mood he address himself to hi fellow
guest chat with them pleasantli upon everi conveni subject
among these guest wa none other than pieter van de werff hi
conqueror in that afternoon conquest upon whose watch and
suspici reserv he brought all hi batteri to bear
first he congratul pieter and lament hi own illluck and thi
with great earnest for as a matter of fact he had lost much more
monei on the event than he could afford to pai then he prais the
grei hors and ask if he wa for sale offer hi own black in part
exchang
a good nag he said but on that i do not wish to conceal ha hi
fault which must be taken into consider if it come to the point
of put a price upon him for instanc mynheer van de werff you mai
have notic the dread posit in which the brute put me toward the
end of the race there ar certain thing that thi hors alwai shi
at and on of them is a red cloak now i dont know if you saw that
a girl in a red cloak suddenli appear on the bank in an instant the
beast wa round and you mai imagin what my feel were be in
charg of your fair kinswoman for i thought to a certainti that we
should be over what is more it quit spoilt my chanc of the race
for after he ha shi like that the black turn sulki and wont let
himself go
when lysbeth heard thi amaz explan rememb the fact she
gasp and yet now that she came to think of it a girl in a red cloak
did appear near them at the moment and the hors did whip round as
though it had shi violent wa it possibl she wonder that the
captain had not realli intend to foul the badger sledg
meanwhil van de werff wa answer in hi slow voic appar he
accept montalvo explan at least he said that he too saw
the redcloak girl and wa glad that noth seriou had come of the
mischanc as regard the propos deal he should be most happi to
go into it upon the line mention as the grei although a veri good
hors wa ag and he thought the barb on of the most beauti
anim that he had ever seen at thi point as he had not the
slightest intent of part with hi valuabl charger at ani rate on
such term montalvo chang the subject
at length when men and for the matter of that women too had well
eaten and the beauti tall flemish glass not for the first time
were replenish with the best rhenish or spanish wine montalvo
take advantag of a paus in the convers rose and said that he
wish to claim the privileg of a stranger among them and propos a
toast name the health of hi late adversari pieter van de werff
at thi the audienc applaud for thei were all veri proud of the
young man success and some of them had won monei over him still
more did thei applaud be great judg of culinari matter when
the spaniard began hi speech by an eleg tribut to the surpass
excel of the supper rare he assur them and especi did he
assur the honour widow van ziel who blush all over with pleasur
at hi compliment and fan herself with such vigour that she upset
dirk wine over hi new tunic cut in the brussel style the fame of
whose skill in such matter had travel so far as the hagu for he
had heard of it there himselfrar even in the court of king and
emperor or at the tabl of pope and archbishop had he eaten food
so exquisit cook or drunk wine of a better vintag
then pass on to the subject of hi speech van de werff he toast
him and hi hors and hi littl sister and hi sledg in realli
wellchosen and appropri term not by ani mean overdo it for
he confess frankli that hi defeat wa a bitter disappoint to him
especi as everi solder in the camp had expect him to win
andh wa afraidback him for more than thei could afford also
incident so that everi on might be well acquaint with it he
retold the stori of the girl with the red cloak next suddenli drop
hi voic and adopt a quieter manner he address himself to the
aunt clara and the wellbelov heer dirk sai that he ow them
both an apolog which he must take thi opportun to make for
have detain the ladi at hi right dure so unreason a time that
afternoon when howev thei had heard the fact thei would he wa
sure blame him no longer especi if he told them that thi breach
of good manner had been the mean of save a human life
immedi after the race he explain on of hi sergeant had found
him out to tell him that a woman suspect of certain crime against
life and properti and believ to be a notori escap witch or
heret had been captur ask for reason which he need not troubl
them with that he would deal with the case at onc thi woman also
so said the man had been heard that everi afternoon to make us of the
most horribl the most traitor and blasphem languag to a ladi
of leyden the jufvrouw lysbeth van hout inde as wa depos by a
certain spy name black meg who had overheard the convers
now went on montalvo as he knew well everi man and woman in that room
would share hi horror of traitor and blasphem hereticsher most
of the compani cross themselv especi those who were alreadi
secret adher of the new religion still even heret had a right
to a fair trial at least he who although a soldier by profess wa
a man who honestli detest unnecessari bloodsh held that opinion
also long experi taught him great mistrust of the evid of
inform who had a monei interest in the convict of the accus
lastli it did not seem well to him that the name of a young and nobl
ladi should be mix up in such a busi as thei knew under the
recent edict hi power in these case were absolut inde in hi
offici capac he wa order at onc to consign ani suspect of
anabapt or other form of heresi to be dealt with by the appoint
court and in the case of peopl who had escap to caus them on
satisfactori proof of their ident to be execut instantli without
further trial under these circumst fear that did the ladi knew
hi purpos she might take fright he had he confess resort to
artific as he wa veri anxiou both for her sake and in the interest
of justic that she should bear testimoni in the matter so he ask
her to accompani him on a short drive while he attend to a busi
affair a request to which she had gracious assent
friend he went on in a still more solemn voic the rest of my
stori is short inde i do congratul myself on the decis that
i took for when confront with the prison our young and honour
hostess wa abl upon oath to refut the stori of the spy with the
result that i in my turn wa to save an unfortun and as i believ
a halfcraz creatur from an immedi and a cruel death is it not
so ladi and helpless in the net of circumst not know inde
what els to do lysbeth bow her head in assent
i think conclud montalvo that after thi explan what mai
have appear to be a breach of manner will be forgiven i have onli
on other word to add my posit is peculiar i am an offici here
and i speak boldli among friend take the risk that ani of you present
will us what i sai against me which for my part i do not believ
although there is no better cathol and no truer spaniard in the
netherland i have been accus of show too great a sympathi with
your peopl and of deal too lenient with those who have incur
the displeasur of our holi church in the caus of right and justic i
am will to bear such aspers still thi is a slander world a
world in which truth doe not alwai prevail therefor although i have
told you noth but the bare fact i do suggest in the interest of
your hostessin my own humbl interest who might be misrepres and
i mai add in the interest of everi on present at thi boardthat it
will perhap be well that the detail of the stori which i have had the
honour of tell you should not be spread aboutthat thei should in
fact find a grave within these wall friend do you agre
then move by a common impuls and by a common if a secret fear with
the singl except of lysbeth everi person present ye even the
cautiou and farse young van de werff echo we agre
friend said montalvo those simpl word carri to my mind
convict deep as ani vow howev solemn deep if that were possibl
as did the oath of your hostess upon the faith of which i felt myself
justifi in acquit the poor creatur who wa alleg to be an
escap heret then with a courteou and allembrac bow montalvo
sat down
what a good man what a delight man murmur aunt clara to dirk in
the buzz of convers which ensu
ye ye cousin but
and what discrimin he ha what tast did you notic what he said
about the cook
i heard someth but
it is true that folk have told me that my capon stew in milk such
as we had tonightwhi lad what is the matter with your doublet you
fidget me by continu rub at it
you have upset the red wine over it that is all answer dirk
sulkili it is spoil
and littl loss either to tell you the truth dirk i never saw a coat
wors cut you young men should learn in the matter of cloth from
the spanish gentlemen look at hi excel the count montalvo for
instanc
see here aunt broke in dirk with suppress furi i think i have
heard enough about spaniard and the captain montalvo for on night
first of all he spirit off lysbeth and is absent with her for four
hour then he invit himself to supper and place himself at the head
of the tabl with her set me down to the dullest meal i ever at at
the other end
cousin dirk said aunt clara with digniti your temper ha got the
better of your manner certainli you might learn courtesi as well as
dress even from so humbl a person as a spanish hidalgo and command
then she rose from the tabl addingcom lysbeth if you ar readi
let us leav these gentlemen to their wine
after the ladi had gone the supper went on merrili in those dai
nearli everybodi drank too much liquor at ani rate at feast and thi
compani wa no except even montalvo hi game be won and the
strain on hi nerv relax partook pretti freeli and began to talk
in proport to hi potat still so clever wa the man that in hi
cup he yet show a method for hi convers reveal a sympathi
with netherland grievanc and a toler of view in religi
matter rare displai by a spaniard
from such question thei drift into a militari discuss and
montalvo challeng by van de werff who as it happen had not
drunk too much wine explain how were he offic in command he would
defend leyden from attack by an overwhelm forc veri soon van de
werff saw that he wa a capabl soldier who had studi hi profess
and be himself a capabl civilian with a thirst for knowledg press
the argument from point to point
and suppos he ask at length that the citi were starv and
still untaken so that it inhabit must either fall into the hand
of the enemi or burn the place over their head what would you do
then
then mynheer if i were a small man i should yield to the clamour of
the starv folk and surrend
and if you were a big man captain
if i were a big manah if i were a big man why theni should cut
the dyke and let the sea beat onc more against the wall of leyden an
armi cannot live in salt water mynheer
that would drown out the farmer and ruin the land for twenti year
quit so mynheer but when the corn ha to be save who think of
spoil the straw
i follow you senor your proverb is good although i have never heard
it
mani good thing come from spain mynheer includ thi red wine on
more glass with you for if you will allow me to sai it you ar a man
worth meet over a beakeror a blade
i hope that you will alwai retain the same opinion of me answer
van de werff as he drank at the trencher or in the trench
then pieter went home and befor he slept that night made care note
of all the spaniard suggest militari disposit both of attack
and attack write underneath them the proverb about the corn and the
straw there exist no real reason why he should have done so as he
wa onli a civilian engag in busi but pieter van de werff chanc
to be a provid young man who knew mani thing might happen which
could not precis be foreseen as it fell out in after year a time
came when he wa abl to put montalvo advic to good us all reader
of the histori of the netherland know how the burgomast pieter van de
werff save leyden from the spanish
as for dirk van goorl he sought hi lodg rather tipsi and
arminarm with none other than captain the count don juan de montalvo
chapter iv
three wake
there were three person in leyden whose reflect when thei awok on
the morn after the sledg race ar not without interest at ani rate
to the student of their histori first there wa dirk van goorl whose
work made an earli riser of himto sai noth of a split headach
which on thi morn call him into conscious just as the clock in
the bell tower wa chime halfpast four now there ar few thing more
depress than to be awaken by a bad headach at halfpast four
in the black frost of a winter dawn yet as dirk lai and thought a
convict took hold of him that hi depress wa not due entir to
the headach or to the cold
on by on he recal the event of yesterdai first he had been late
for thi appoint with lysbeth which evid vex her then the
captain montalvo had swoop down and carri her awai as a hawk bear
off a chicken under the veri ey of the henwif while hedonkei that
he wascould find no word in which to protest next think it hi
duti to back the sledg wherein lysbeth rode although it wa driven
by a spaniard he had lost ten florin on that event which be a
thrifti young man did not at all pleas him the rest of the fete
he had spent hunt for lysbeth who mysteri vanish with the
spaniard an unentertain and even an anxiou pastim then came the
supper when onc more the count swoop down on lysbeth leav him
to escort hi cousin clara whom he consid an old fool and dislik
and who have spoilt hi new jacket by spill wine over it end by
abus hi tast in dress nor wa that allh had drunk a great deal
more strong wine than wa wise for to thi hi head certifi lastli
he had walk home arm in arm with hi ladysnatch spaniard and by
heaven ye he had sworn etern friendship with him on the doorstep
well there wa no doubt that the count wa an uncommonli good
fellowfor a spaniard as for that stori of the foul he had explain
it quit satisfactorili and he had taken hi beat like a gentleman
could anyth be nicer or in better feel than hi allus to
cousin pieter in hi aftersupp speech also and thi wa a graver
matter the man had shown that he wa toler and kindli by the wai
in which he dealt with the poor creatur call the mare a woman whose
histori dirk knew well on whose suffer had made of her a crazi and
rashtongu wander who so it wa rumour could us a knife
in fact for the truth mai as well be told at onc dirk wa a lutheran
have been admit to that commun two year befor to be a
lutheran in those dai that is in the netherland meant it need
scarc be explain that you walk the world with a halter round
your neck and a vision of the rack and the stake befor your ey
circumst under which religion becam a more earnest and seriou
thing than most peopl find it in thi centuri still even at that date
the dread penalti attach to the crime did not prevent mani of
the burgher and lower class from worship god in their own fashion
inde if the truth had been known of those who were present at
lysbeth supper on the previou night more than half includ pieter
van de werff were adher of the new faith
to dismiss religi consider howev dirk could have wish
that thi kindli natur spaniard wa not quit so goodlook or quit
so appreci of the excel point of the young leyden ladi
and especi of lysbeth with whose sterl charact he now
rememb montalvo had assur him he wa much impress what he
fear wa that thi regard might be reciproc after all a spanish
hidalgo in command of the garrison wa a distinguish person and
ala lysbeth also wa a cathol dirk love lysbeth he love her with
that patient sincer which wa characterist of hi race and hi own
tempera but in addit to and abov the reason that have been
given alreadi it wa thi fact of the differ of religion which
hitherto had built a wall between them of cours she wa unawar of
anyth of the sort she did not know even that he belong to the new
faith and without the permiss of the elder of hi sect he would
not dare to tell her for the live of men and of their famili could
not be confid lightli to the hazard of a girl discret
herein lai the real reason why although dirk wa so devot to lysbeth
and although he imagin that she wa not indiffer to him as yet no
word had pass between them of love or marriag how could he who wa
a lutheran ask a cathol to becom hi wife without tell her the
truth and if he told her the truth and she consent to take the risk
how could he drag her into that dread net suppos even that she
kept to her own faith which of cours she would be at liberti to do
although equal of cours he wa bound to try to convert her their
children if thei had ani must be brought up in hi belief then
sooner or later might come the inform that dread inform whose
shadow alreadi lai heavi upon thousand of home in the netherland and
after the inform the offic and after the offic the priest and
after the priest the judg and after the judgeth execution and the
stake
in thi case what would happen to lysbeth she might prove herself
innoc of the horribl crime of heresi if by that time she wa
innoc but what would life becom to the love young woman whose
husband and children perhap had been hale off to the slaughter
chamber of the papal inquisit thi wa the true first caus why
dirk had remain silent even when he wa sore tempt to speak ye
although hi instinct told him that hi silenc had been misinterpret
and set down to overcaut or indiffer or to unnecessari
scrupl
the next to wake up that morn wa lysbeth who if she wa not
troubl with headach result from indulgenceand in that dai
women of her class sometim suffer from ithad pain of her own to
overcom when sift and classifi these pain resolv themselv
into a sens of fieri indign against dirk van goorl dirk had been
late for hi appoint alleg some ridicul excus about the
cool of a bell as though she care whether the bell were hot or
cold with the result that she had been thrown into the compani of that
dread martha the mare after the mareaggrav by black megcam
the spaniard here again dirk had shown contempt indiffer and
insuffici for he allow her to be forc into the wolf sledg
against her will nai he had actual consent to the thing next
in a fate sequenc follow all the other incid of that hideou
carniv the race the foul if it wa a foul the dread nightmar
vision call into her mind by the look upon montalvo face the trial
of the mare her own unpremedit but indel perjuri the lone
drive with the man who compel her to it the exhibit of herself
befor all the world as hi will companion and the feast in which he
appear as her cavali and wa accept of the simpl compani almost
as an angel entertain by chanc
what did he mean doubtless for on that point she could scarc be
mistaken he meant to make love to her for had he not in practic said
as much and nowthi wa the terribl thingsh wa in hi power
sinc if he chose to do so without doubt he could prove that she had
sworn a fals oath for her own purpos also that lie weigh upon her
mind although it had been spoken in a good caus if it wa good to
save a wretch fanat from the fate which were the truth known
without doubt her crime deserv
of cours the spaniard wa a bad man if an attract on and he had
behav wickedli if with grace and breed but who expect anyth
els from a spaniard who onli act after hi kind and for hi own
end it wa dirkdirkthat wa to blame not so muchand here again
came the rubfor hi awkward and mistak of yesterdai as for hi
gener conduct why had he not spoken to her befor and put her beyond
the reach of such accid as these to which a woman of her posit
and substanc must necessarili be expos the saint knew that she had
given him opportun enough she had gone as far as a maiden might and
not for all the dirk on earth would she go on inch further why
had she ever come to care for hi foolish face why had she refus
soandso and soandso and soandsoal of them honour menwith
the result that now no other bachelor ever came near her comprehend
that she wa under bond to her cousin in the past she had persuad
herself that it wa becaus of someth she felt but could not see of
a hidden nobil of charact which after all wa not veri evid
upon the surfac that she love dirk van goorl but where wa thi
someth thi nobil sure a man who wa a man ought to plai hi
part and not leav her in thi fals posit especi as
there could be no question of mean she would not have come to him
emptyhand veri far from it inde oh were it not for the unlucki
fact that she still happen to care about himto her sorrownev
never would she speak to him again
the last of our three friend to awak on thi particular morn
between nine and ten oclock inde when dirk had been alreadi two
hour at hi factori and lysbeth wa bui provis in the market
place wa that accomplish and excel offic captain the count
juan de montalvo for a few second after hi dark ey open he stare
at the ceil collect hi thought then sit up in bed he
burst into a prolong roar of laughter realli the whole thing wa
too funni for ani man of humour to contempl without be move
to merriment that gabi dirk van goorl the furious indign but
helpless lysbeth the solemn fathead fool of netherland at the
supper and the fashion in which he had plai hi own tune on the whole
pack of them as though thei were the string of a fiddleoh it wa
delici
as the reader by thi time mai have guess montalvo wa not the
typic spaniard of romanc and inde of histori he wa not gloomi
and stern he wa not even particularli veng or bloodthirsti on the
contrari he wa a clever and utterli unprincipl man with a sens of
humour and a gift of bonhomi which made him popular in all place
moreov he wa brave a good soldier in a certain sens sympathet
and strang to sai no bigot inde which seem to have been a rare
thing in those dai hi religi view were so enlarg that he
had none at all hi conduct therefor if from time to time it
wa affect by pass spasm of acut superstit wa total
uninfluenc by ani settl spiritu hope or fear a condit which
he found gave him great advantag in life in fact had it suit hi
purpos montalvo wa prepar at a moment notic to becom lutheran
or calvinist or mahomedan or mystic or even anabaptist on the
principl he would explain that it is easi for the artist to paint ani
pictur he like upon a blank canva
and yet thi curiou plianci of mind thi lack of convict thi
absolut want of moral sens which ought to have given the count such
great advantag in hi conflict with the world were in realiti the
main sourc of hi weak fortun had made a soldier of the man and
he fill the part as he would have fill ani part but natur intend
him for a playactor and from dai to dai he pose and mime and mouth
through life in thi charact or in that though never in hi
own charact princip becaus he had none still far down in
montalvo be there wa someth solid and genuin and that
someth not good but bad it wa veri rare on view the hand of
circumst must plung deep to find it but it dwelt there the
strong cruel spanish spirit which would sacrific anyth to save
or even to advanc itself it wa thi spirit that lysbeth had seen
look out of hi ey on the yesterdai which when he knew that the
race wa lost had prompt him to try to kill hi adversari although
he kill himself and her in the attempt nor did she see it then for
the last time for twice more at least in her life she wa destin to
meet and trembl at it power
in short although montalvo wa a man who realli dislik cruelti he
could upon occas be cruel to the last degre although he appreci
friend and desir to have them he could be the foulest of traitor
although without a caus he would do no hurt to a live thing yet if
that caus were suffici he would cheerfulli consign a whole city
to death no not cheerfulli he would have regret their end veri
much and often afterward might have thought of it with sympathi
and even sorrow thi wa where he differ from the major of hi
countrymen in that ag who would have done the same thing and more
brutal from honest principl and for the rest of their live
rejoic at the memori of the deed
montalvo had hi rule passion it wa not war it wa not women it
wa monei but here again he did not care about the monei for itself
sinc he wa no miser and be the most inveter of gambler never
save a singl stiver he want it to spend and to stake upon the dice
thu again in varianc to the tast of most of hi countrymen he care
littl for the other sex he did not even like their societi and as for
their passion and the rest he thought it someth of a bore but he did
care intens for their admir so much so that if no better game
were at hand he would take enorm troubl to fascin even a serv
maid or a fish girl wherev he went it wa hi ambit to be report
the man the most admir of the fair in that citi and to attain thi
end he offer himself upon the altar of numer love affair which
did not amus him in the least of cours the indulg of thi vaniti
meant expens sinc the fair requir monei and present and he who
pursu them should be well dress and hors and abl to do thing
in the veri finest style also their rel must be entertain and
when thei were entertain impress with the sens that thei had the
honour to be guest of a grande of spain
now that of a grande ha never been a cheap profess inde as mani
a pauper peer know todai rank without resourc is a terrif burden
montalvo had the rank for he wa a wellborn man whose sole heritag
wa an ancient tower built by some warlik ancestor in a posit
admir suit to the purpos of the said ancestor name the
pillag of travel through a neighbour mountain pass when
howev travel ceas to us that pass or for other reason
robberi becam no longer product the revenu of the montalvo famili
declin till at the present date thei were practic nil thu it
came about that the statu of the last repres of thi ancient
stock wa that of a soldier of fortun of the common type endow
unfortun for himself with grand idea a gambler fatal fire
expens tast and more than the usual pride of race
although perhap he had never defin them veri clearli even to
himself juan de montalvo had two aim in life first to indulg hi
everi freak and fanci to the full and nextbut thi wa secondari
and somewhat nebulousto reestablish the fortun of hi famili in
themselv thei were quit legitim aim and in those time when
fisher of troubl water gener caught someth and when men of
abil and charact might forc their wai to splendid posit there
wa no reason why thei should not have led him to success yet so
far at ani rate in spite of mani opportun he had not succeed
although he wa now a man of more than thirti the caus of hi
failur were variou but at the bottom of them lai hi lack of
stabil and genuin
a man who is alwai plai a part amus everi on but convinc
nobodi montalvo convinc nobodi when he discours on the mysteri
of religion with priest even priest who in those dai for the
most part were stupid felt that thei assist in a mere intellectu
exercis when hi theme wa war hi audienc guess that hi object
wa probabl love when love wa hi song an inconveni instinct wa
apt to assur the ladi immedi concern that it wa love of self
and not of her thei were all more or less mistaken but as usual the
women went nearest to the mark montalvo real aim wa self but he
spelt it monei monei in larg sum wa what he want and what in
thi wai or that he meant to win
now even in the sixteenth centuri fortun did not lie to the hand of
everi adventur militari pai wa small and not easili recover
loot wa hard to come by and quickli spent even the ransom of a rich
prison or two soon disappear in the payment of such debt of honour
as could not be avoid of cours there remain the possibl of
wealthi marriag which in a countri like the netherland that wa
full of rich heiress wa not difficult to a highborn handsom and
agreeabl man of the rule spanish cast inde after mani chanc
and chang the time had come at length when montalvo must either marri
or be ruin for hi station hi debt especi hi game debt
were enorm and creditor met him at everi turn unfortun for
him also some of these creditor were person who had the ear of
peopl in author so at last it came about that an intim reach
him that thi scandal must be abat or he must go back to spain a
countri which as it happen he did not in the least wish to visit
in short the sorri hour of reckon that hour which overtak all
procrastin had arriv and marriag wealthi marriag wa the
onli wai wherewith it could be defi it wa a sad altern to a man
who for hi own veri excel reason did not wish to marri but thi
had to be face
thu it came about that as the onli suitabl parti in leyden
the count montalvo had sought out the wellfavour and wellendow
jufvrouw lysbeth van hout to be hi companion in the great sledg race
and taken so much troubl to ensur to himself a friendli recept at
her hous
so far thing went well and what wa more the open of the chase
had prove distinctli entertain also the societi of the place
after hi appropri of her at a public festiv and their long
moonlight teteatet which by now must be common gossip talk
would be quit prepar for ani amount of attent which he might see
fit to pai to lysbeth inde why should he not pai attent to an
unaffianc woman whose rank wa lower if her mean were greater than
hi own of cours he knew that her name had been coupl with that of
dirk van goorl he wa perfectli awar also that these two young peopl
were attach to each other for as thei walk home togeth on the
previou night dirk possibl for motiv of hi own had favour him
with a semiintox confid to that effect but as thei were not
affianc what did that matter inde had thei been affianc what
would it matter still dirk van goorl wa an obstacl and therefor
although he seem to be a good fellow and he wa sorri for him
dirk van goorl must be got out of the wai sinc he wa convinc that
lysbeth wa on of those stubbornnatur creatur who would probabl
declin to marri himself until thi young leyden lout had vanish and
yet he did not wish to be mix up with duel if for no other reason
becaus in a duel the unexpect mai alwai happen and that would be
a poor end certainli also he did not wish to be mix up with murder
first becaus he intens dislik the idea of kill anybodi unless
he wa driven to it and secondli becaus murder ha a nasti wai of
come out on could never be quit sure in what light the despatch
of a young netherland of respect famili and fortun would be
look at by those in author
also there wa anoth thing to be consid if thi young man di
it wa imposs to know exactli how lysbeth would take hi death thu
she might elect to refus to marri or decid to mourn him for four or
five year which for all practic purpos would be just as bad and
yet while dirk live how could he possibl persuad her to transfer her
affect to himself it seem therefor that dirk ought to deceas
for quit a quarter of an hour montalvo thought the matter over and
then just as he had given it up and determin to leav thing
to chanc for a while at least inspir came a splendid a
heavens inspir
dirk must not die dirk must live but hi continu exist must be
the price of the hand of lysbeth van hout if she wa half as fond of
the man as he believ it wa probabl that she would be delight to
marri anybodi els in order to save hi preciou neck for that wa just
the kind of sentiment idiotci of which nine women out of ten realli
enjoi the indulg moreov thi scheme had other merit it did
everi on a good turn dirk would be save from extinct for which he
should be grate lysbeth besid earn the honour of an allianc
perhap onli temporari with himself would be abl to go through life
wrap in a heavenli glow of virtu aris from the impress that
she had realli done someth veri fine and tragic while he montalvo
under provid the humbl purveyor of these bless would also
benefit to some small extent
the difficulti wa how could the situat be creat how could
the interest dirk be brought to a pass that would give the ladi an
opportun of exercis her finer feel on hi behalf if onli he
were a heret now well by the pope why shouldnt he be a heret
if ever a fellow had the heret cut thi fellow had flatfac
sanctimoniouslook and with a fanci for darkcolour stockingsh
had observ that all heret male and femal wore darkcolour
stock perhap by wai of mortifi the flesh he could think of
onli on thing against it the young man had drunk too much last night
but there were certain breed of heret who did not mind drink too
much also the best could slip sometim for as he had learn from
the old castilian priest who taught him latin humanum est etc
thi then wa the summari of hi reflect 1 that to save the
situat within three month or so he must be unit in holi matrimoni
with lysbeth van hout 2 that if it prove imposs to remov the
young man dirk van goorl from hi path by overmatch him in the
ladi affect or by plai on her jealousi queri could a woman
be eg into becom jealou of that flounder of a fellow and into
marri some on els out of piqu stronger measur must be
adopt 3 that such stronger measur should consist of induc the
ladi to save her lover from death by unit herself in marriag with
on who for her sake would do violenc to hi conscienc and manipul
the busi 4 that thi plan would be best put into execut by
prove the lover to be a heret but if unhappili thi could not be
prove becaus he wa not still he must figur in that capac for
thi occas onli 5 that meanwhil it would be well to cultiv the
societi of mynheer van goorl as much as possibl first becaus he wa a
person with whom under the circumst he montalvo would natur
wish to becom intim and secondli becaus he wa quit certain to
be an individu with cash to lend
now these research after heret invari cost monei for thei
involv the servic of spi obvious therefor friend dirk the
dutch flounder wa a man to provid the butter in which he wa go to
be fri why if ani holland had a spark of humour he would see the

chapter v
the dream of dirk
on the dai follow montalvo interview with black meg dirk receiv
a messag from that gentleman sent to hi lodg by an orderli which
remind him that he had promis to dine with him thi veri night now
he had no recollect of ani such engag rememb with shame
howev that there were variou incid of the even of the supper
whereof hi memori wa most imperfect he conclud that thi must be
on of them so much against hi own wish dirk sent back an answer to
sai that he would appear at the time and place appoint
thi wa the third thing that had happen to annoi him that dai first
he had met pieter van de werff who inform him that all leyden wa
talk about lysbeth and the captain montalvo to whom she wa said to
have taken a great fanci next when he went to call at the hous in the
bree straat he wa told that both lysbeth and hi cousin clara had gone
out sleigh which he did not believ for as a thaw had set in the
snow wa no longer in a condit suitabl to that amus moreov
he could almost have sworn that as he cross the street he caught
sight of cousin clara red face peep at him from between the
curtain of the upstair sittingroom inde he said as much to greta
who contrari to custom had open the door to him
i am sorri if mynheer see vision answer that young woman
imperturb i told mynheer that the ladi had gone out sleigh
i know you did greta but why should thei go out sleigh in a wet
thaw
i dont know mynheer ladi do those thing that pleas them it is
not my place to ask their reason
dirk look at greta and wa convinc that she wa ly he put hi
hand in hi pocket to find to hi disgust that he had forgotten hi
purs then he thought of give her a kiss and try to melt the truth
out of her in thi fashion but rememb that if he did she might
tell lysbeth which would make matter wors than ever refrain so
the end of it wa that he mere said oh inde and went awai
great softhead reflect greta as she watch hi retreat
form he knew i wa tell li why didnt he push past me ordo
anyth ah mynheer dirk if you ar not care that spaniard will
take your wind well he is more amus that certain i am tire of
these duckfoot leyden who darent wink at a donkei lest he should
brai and among such holi folk somebodi a littl wick is rather a
chang then greta who it mai be rememb came from brussel and
had french blood in her vein went upstair to make a report to her
mistress tell her all that pass
i did not ask you to speak falsehood as to my be out sleigh and
the rest i told you to answer that i wa not at home and mind you sai
the same to the captain montalvo if he call said lysbeth with some
acerb as she dismiss her
in truth she wa veri sore and angri and yet asham of herself becaus
it wa so but thing had gone so horribl wrong and as for dirk he
wa the most exasper person in the world it wa ow to hi
bad manag and lack of readi that her name wa coupl with
montalvo at everi tabl in leyden and now what did she hear in a note
from the captain himself sent to make excus for not have call
upon her after the supper parti but that dirk wa go to dine with
him that night veri well let him do it she would know how to pai him
back and if necessari wa readi to act up to ani situat which he had
chosen to creat
thu thought lysbeth stamp her foot with vexat but all the time
her heart wa sore all the time she knew well enough that she love
dirk and howev strang might be hi backward in speak out hi
mind that he love her and yet she felt as though a river wa run
between them in the begin it had been a streamlet but now it wa
grow to a torrent wors still the spaniard wa upon her bank of the
river
after he had to some extent conquer hi shyness and irrit dirk
becam awar that he wa realli enjoi hi dinner at montalvo
quarter there were three guest besid himself two spanish offic
and a young netherland of hi own class and ag brant by name he wa
the onli son of a note and veri wealthi goldsmith at the hagu who had
sent him to studi certain mysteri of the metal worker art under
a leyden jewel famou for the exquisit beauti of hi design the
dinner and the servic were both of them perfect in style but better
than either prove the convers which wa of a charact that dirk
had never heard at the tabl of hi own class and peopl not that
there wa anyth even broad about it as might perhap have been
expect no it wa the talk of highli accomplish and travel men
of the world who had seen much and been actor in mani move event
men who were not overtrammel by prejudic religi or other and
who were abov all thing desir of make themselv agreeabl and
instruct to the stranger within their gate the heer brant also who
had but just arriv in leyden show himself an abl and polish
man on that had been educ more thoroughli than wa usual among hi
class and who at the tabl of hi father the opul burgomast of
the hagu from hi youth had associ with all class and condit
of men inde it wa there that he made the acquaint of montalvo
who recognis him in the street had ask him to dinner
after the dish were clear on of the spanish offic rose and
beg to be excus plead some militari duti when he had salut
hi command and gone montalvo suggest that thei should plai a game
of card thi wa an invit which dirk would have like to declin
but when it came to the point he did not for fear of seem peculiar
in the ey of these brilliant men of the world
so thei began to plai and as the game wa simpl veri soon he pick
up the point of it and what is more found them amus at first
the stake were not high but thei doubl themselv in some automat
fashion till dirk wa astonish to find that he wa gambl for
consider sum and win them toward the last hi luck chang a
littl but when the game came to an end he found himself the richer by
about three hundr and fifti florin
what am i do to with thi he ask colour up as with sigh which
in on instanc were genuin enough the loser push the monei across
to him
do with it laugh montalvo did anybodi ever hear such an innoc

their late companion and the game of card which thei had plai
an amus as to the proprieti of which dirk intim that he had
doubt
young brant shrug hi shoulder cousin he said we live in the
world so it is as well to understand the world if the risk of a
few piec at plai which it will not ruin us to lose help us to
understand it well for my part i am readi to risk them especi as
it put us on good term with those who as thing ar it is wise we
should cultiv onli cousin if i mai ventur to sai it be care
not to take more wine than you can carri with discret better lose a
thousand florin than let drop on word that you cannot rememb
i know i know answer dirk think of lysbeth supper and at
the door of hi lodg thei part
like most netherland when dirk made up hi mind to do anyth he
did it thoroughli thu have undertaken to give a dinner parti he
determin to give a good dinner in ordinari circumst hi first
idea would have been to consult hi cousin clara and lysbeth after
that monstrou stori about the sleigh howev which by inquiri from
the coachman of the hous whom he happen to meet he ascertain to
be perfectli fals thi for the young man had some pride he did not
feel inclin to do so in place of it he talk first to hi landladi
a worthi dame and by her advic afterward with the first innkeep of
leyden a man of resourc and experi the innkeep well know
that thi custom would pai for anyth which he order threw
himself into the affair heartili with the result that by five oclock
relai of cook and other attend were to be seen stream up dirk
staircas carri everi varieti of dish that could be suppos to
tempt the appetit of highclass cavali
dirk apart consist of two room situat upon the first floor
of an old hous in a street that had ceas to be fashion onc
howev it had been a fine hous and accord to the idea of the
time the room themselv were fine especi the sit chamber
which wa oakpanel low and spaciou with a handsom fireplac
carri the arm of it builder out of it open hi sleep
roomwhich had no other doorwaylikewis oakpanel with tall
cupboard not unlik the canopi of a tomb in shape and gener

the hour came and with it the guest the feast began the cook
stream up and down bear relai of dish from the inn abov the
tabl hung a sixarm brass chandeli and in each of it socket
gutter a tallow candl furnish light to the compani beneath
although outsid of it bright ring there wa shadow more or less dens
toward the end of dinner a portion of the rush wick of on of these
candl fell into the brass saucer beneath caus the molten greas
to burn up fierc as it chanc by the light of thi sudden flare
montalvo who wa sit opposit to the door thought that he caught
sight of a tall dark figur glide along the wall toward the bedroom
for on instant he saw it then it wa gone
caramba my friend he said address dirk whose back wa turn
toward the figur have you ani ghost in thi gloomi old room of
your becaus if so i think i have just seen on
ghost answer dirk no i never heard of ani i do not believ in
ghost take some more of that pasti
montalvo took some more pasti and wash it down with a glass of
wine but he said no more about ghostsperhap an explan of the
phenomenon had occur to him at ani rate he decid to leav the
subject alon
after the dinner thei gambl and thi even the stake began where
those of the previou night left off for the first hour dirk lost then
the luck turn and he won heavili but alwai from montalvo
my friend said the captain at last throw down hi card
certainli you ar fate to be unfortun in your matrimoni
adventur for the devil live in your dicebox and hi high doe
not give everyth i pass and he rose from the tabl
i pass also said dirk follow him into the window place for he

said

for the next six month i must live onwellwel noth except the
recollect of your excel dinner
i am sorri mutter dirk confusedli i did not wish to take your
monei it wa the turn of those accurs dice see here let us sai no
more about it
sir said montalvo with a sudden stern an offic and a
gentleman cannot treat a debt of honour thu but he ad with a
littl laugh if anoth gentleman chanc to be good enough to charg
a debt of honour for a debt of honour the affair is differ if
for instanc it would suit you to lend me four hundr florin which
ad to the six hundr which i have lost tonight would make a
thousand in all well it will be a conveni to me though should it
be ani inconveni to you prai do not think of such a thing
certainli answer dirk i have won nearli as much as that and here
at my own tabl take them i beg of you captain and empti a roll
of gold into hi hand he count it with the skill of a merchant and
held it toward him
montalvo hesit then he took the monei pour it carelessli into
hi pocket
you have not check the sum said dirk
my friend it is needless answer hi guest your word is rather
better than ani bond and again he yawn remark that it wa
get late
dirk wait a few moment think in hi coars businesslik wai
that the nobl spaniard might wish to sai someth about a written
acknowledg as howev thi did not seem to occur to him and
the matter wa not on of ordinari affair he led the wai back to the
tabl where the other two were now show their skill in card trick
a few minut later the two spaniard took their departur leav dirk
and hi cousin brant alon
a veri success even said brant and cousin you won a great
deal
ye answer dirk but all the same i am a poorer man than i wa
yesterdai
brant laugh did he borrow of you he ask well i thought he
would and what more dont you count on that monei montalvo is a
good sort of fellow in hi own fashion but he is an extravag man
and a desper gambler with a queer histori i fancyat least nobodi
know much about him not even hi brother offic if you ask them
thei shrug their shoulder and sai that spain is a big kettl full of
all sort of fish on thing i do know howev that he is over head
and ear in debt inde there wa troubl about it down at the hagu
so cousin dont you plai with him more than you can help and dont
reckon on that thousand florin to pai your bill with it is a mysteri
to me how the man get on but i am told that a foolish old vrouw in
amsterdam lent him a lot till she discoveredbut there i dont
talk scandal and now he ad chang hi voic is thi place
privat
let see said dirk thei have clear the thing awai and the old
housekeep ha tidi up my bedroom ye i think so nobodi ever come
up here after ten oclock what is it
brant touch hi arm and understand the truth dirk led the wai
into the windowplac there stand with hi back to the room and
hi hand cross in a peculiar fashion he utter the word jesu
and paus brant also cross hi hand and answer or rather
continu wept it wa the password of those of the new religion
you ar on of us cousin said dirk
i and all my hous my father my mother my sister and the maiden
whom i am to marri thei told me at the hagu that i must seek of you or
the young heer pieter van de werff knowledg of those thing which we
of the faith need to know who ar to be trust and who ar not to
be trust where prayer is held and where we mai partak of the pure
sacrament of god the son
dirk took hi cousin hand and press it the pressur wa return
and thenceforward brother could not have trust brother more
complet for now between them wa the bond of a common and burn
faith
such bond the reader mai sai tie nineti out of everi hundr peopl
to each other in the present year of grace but it is not to be observ
that a like mutual confid result no becaus the circumst
have chang thank veri larg to dirk van goorl and hi fellow of
that dai especi to on william of orang it is no longer necessari
for devout and godfear peopl to creep into hole and corner like
felon hide from the law that thei mai worship the almighti after
some fashion as pure as it is simpl know the while that if thei ar
found so do their lot and the lot of their wive and children will
be the torment and the stake now the thumbscrew and the rack as
instrument for the discomfitur of heret ar releg to the
dusti case of museum but some short gener sinc all thi wa
differ for then a man who dare to disagre with certain doctrin
wa treat with far less merci than is shown to a dog on the
vivisector tabl
littl wonder therefor that those who lai under such a ban those who
were continu walk in the cold shadow of thi dread doom clung
to each other love each other and comfort each other to the last
pass often enough handinhand through the fieri gate to that
countri in which there is no more pain to be a member of the new
religion in the netherland under the aw rule of charl the emperor
and philip the king wa to be on of a vast famili it wa not sir
or mistress or madam it wa my father and my mother or my
sister and my brother ye and between peopl who were of veri
differ statu and almost stranger in the flesh stranger in the
flesh but brethren in spirit
it will be understood that in these circumst dirk and brant
alreadi like each other and be alreadi connect by blood were
not slow in come to a complet understand and fellowship
there thei sat in the windowplac tell each other of their famili
their hope and fear and even of their ladylov in thi as in
everi other respect hendrik brant stori wa on of simpl prosper
he wa betroth to a ladi of the hagu the onli daughter of a wealthi
winemerch who accord to hi account seem to be as beauti
as she wa good and rich and thei were to be marri in the spring but
when dirk told him of hi affair he shook hi wise young head
you sai that both she and her aunt ar cathol he ask
ye cousin thi is the troubl i think that she is fond of me or
at ani rate she wa until a few dai sinc he ad ruefulli but
how can i be a heret ask her to plight her troth to me unless
i tell her and that you know is against the rule inde i scarc
dare to do so
had you not best consult with some godli elder who by prayer and word
mai move your ladi heart till the light shine on her ask brant
cousin it ha been done but alwai there is the other in the wai
that rednos aunt clara who is a mad idol also there is
the servingwoman greta whom i take for littl better than a spy
therefor between the two of them i see littl chanc that lysbeth will
ever hear the truth thi side of marriag and yet how dare i marri her
is it right that i should marri her and therefor perhap bring her
too to some dread fate such as mai wait for you or me moreov now
sinc thi man montalvo ha cross my path all thing seem to have
gone wrong between me and lysbeth inde but yesterdai her door wa
shut on me
women have their fanci answer brant slowli perhap he ha
taken her she would not be the first who walk that plank or
perhap she is vex with you for not speak out er thi for man
not know what you ar how can she read your mind
perhap perhap said dirk but i know not what to do and in hi
perplex he struck hi forehead with hi hand
then brother in that case what hinder that we should ask him who can
tell you said brant calmli
dirk understood what he meant at onc it is a wise thought and a good
on cousin i have the holi book first let us prai and then we can
seek wisdom there
you ar rich inde answer brant sometim you must tell me how
and where you came by it
here in leyden if on can afford to pai for them such good ar not
hard to get said dirk what is hard is to keep them safe for
to be found with a bibl in your pocket is to carri your own
deathwarr
brant nod is it safe to show it here he ask
as safe as anywher cousin the window is shutter the door is or
will be lock but who can sai that he is safe thi side of the stake
in a land where the rat and mice carri new and the wind bear wit
come i will show you were i keep it and go to the mantelpiec
he took down a candlestick a quaint brass ornament on it massiv
oblong base with two copper snail and lit the candl do you like the
piec he ask it is my own design which i cast and file out in
my spare hour and he gaze at the holder with the affect of an
artist then without wait for an answer he led the wai to the door
of hi sittingroom and paus
what is it ask brant
i thought i heard a sound that is all but doubtless the old vrouw
move upon the stair turn the kei cousin so now come on
thei enter the sleep chamber and have glanc round and made
sure that it wa empti and the window shut dirk went to the head of
the bed which wa form of oakpanel the centr on carv with
a magnific coatofarm fellow to that in the fireplac of the
sittingroom at thi panel dirk began to work till present it slid
asid reveal a hollow out of which he took a book bound in board
cover with leather then have close the panel the two young men
return to the sittingroom and place the volum upon the oak tabl
beneath the chandeli
first let us prai said brant
it seem curiou doe it not that two young men as a final to a
dinner parti and a gambl match at which the stake had not been low
young men who like other had their weak for on of them at ani
rate could drink too much wine at time and both be human doubtless
had further sin to bear should suggest kneel side by side to offer
prayer to their maker befor thei studi the scriptur but then in
those strang dai prayer now so common and so neglect an exercis
wa an actual luxuri to these poor hunt men and women it wa a joi
to be abl to kneel and offer thank and petit to god believ
themselv to be safe from the sword of those who worship otherwis
thu it came about that religion be forbidden wa to them a veri
real and earnest thing a thing to be indulg in at everi opportun
with solemn and grate heart so there beneath the light of the
gutter candl thei knelt side by side while brant speak for
both of them offer up a prayera sight touch enough and in it
wai beauti
the word of hi petit do not matter he prai for their church he
prai for their countri that it might be made strong and free he even
prai for the emperor the carnal harelip guzzl abl hapsburg
selfseek then he prai for themselv and all who were dear to
them and lastli that light might be vouchsaf to dirk in hi present
difficulti no not quit lastli for he end with a petit that
their enemi might be forgiven ye even those who tortur them and
burnt them at the stake sinc thei knew not what thei did it mai be
wonder whether ani human aspir could have been more thoroughli
steep in the true spirit of christian
when at length he had finish thei rose from their knee
shall i open the book at a hazard ask dirk and read what my ey
fall on
no answer brant for it savour of superstit thu did the
ancient with the write of the poet virgiliu and it is not fit
that we who hold the light should follow the exampl of those blind
heathen what work of the book brother ar you studi now
the first letter of paul to the corinthian which i have never read
befor he answer
then begin where you left off brother and read your chapter perhap
we mai find instruct in it if not no answer is vouchsaf to us
tonight
so from the blacklett volum befor him dirk began to read the
seventh chapter in which as it chanc the great apostl deal with
the marriag state on he read in a quiet even voic till he came to
the twelfth and four follow vers of which the last three run for
the unbeliev husband is sanctifi by the wife and the unbeliev
wife is sanctifi by the husband els were your children unclean
but now thei ar holi but if the unbeliev depart let him depart
a brother or a sister is not under bondag in such case but god ha
call us to peac for what knowest thou o wife whether thou shalt
save thy husband or how knowest thou o man whether thou shalt save
thy wife dirk voic trembl and he paus
continu to the end of the chapter said brant so the reader went on
there is a sound thei do not hear it but the door of the bedchamb
behind them open ever so littl thei do not see it but between door
and lintel someth white thrust itself a woman white face crown
with black hair and set in it two evil stare ey sure
when first he rais hi head in eden satan might have worn such a
counten as thi it crane itself forward till the long thin neck
seem to stretch then suddenli a stir or a movement alarm it and back
the face draw like the crest of a startl snake back it draw and
the door close again
the chapter is read the prayer is prai and strang mai seem the
answer to that prayer an answer to shake out faith from the heart of
men men who ar impati who do not know that as the light take long
in travel from a distant star so the answer from the throne to the
supplic of trust mai be long in come it mai not come todai
or tomorrow it mai not come in thi gener or thi centuri the
prayer of todai mai receiv it crown when the children children of
the lip that utter it have in their turn vanish in the dust and
yet that divin repli mai in no wise be delai even as our liberti
of thi hour mai be the fruit of those who di when dirk van goorl and
hendrik brant walk upon the earth even as the vengeanc that but now
is fall on the spaniard mai be the reward of the deed of shame that
he work upon them and upon their kin long gener gone for the
throne is still the throne and the star is still the star from the on
flow justic and from the other light and to them time and space ar
naught
dirk finish the chapter and close the book
it seem that you have your answer brother said brant quietli
ye repli dirk it is written larg enoughth unbeliev wife
is sanctifi by the husband how knowest thou o man whether thou
shalt save thy wife had the apostl foreseen my case he could not have
set the matter forth more clearli
he or the spirit in him knew all case and wrote for everi man that
ever shall be born answer brant thi is a lesson to us had you
look sooner you would have learn sooner and mayhap much troubl
might have been spare as it is without doubt you must make hast and
speak to her at onc leav the rest with god
ye said dirk as soon as mai be but there is on thing more ought
i tell her all the truth
i should not be care to hide it friend and now good night no
do not come to the door with me who can tell there mai be watcher
without and it is not wise that we should be seen togeth so late
when hi cousin and newfound friend had gone dirk sat for a while till
the gutter tallow light overhead burn to the socket inde then
take the candl from the snailadorn holder he lit it and
have extinguish those in the chandeli went into hi bedroom and
undress himself the bibl he return to it hidingplac and close
the panel after which he blew out the light and climb into the tall
bed
as a rule dirk wa a most excel sleeper when he laid hi head on
the pillow hi ey close nor did thei open again until the appoint
and accustom hour but thi night he could not sleep whether it wa
the dinner or the wine or the gambl or the prayer and the search
of the scriptur with hi cousin brant the result remain the same
he wa veri wake which annoi him the more as a man of hi race and
phlegm found it hard to attribut thi unrest to ani of these trivial
caus still as vexat would not make him sleep he lai awak
watch the moonlight flood the chamber in broad bar and think
somehow as dirk thought thu he grew afraid it seem to him as though
he share that place with anoth presenc an evil and malign
presenc never in hi life befor had he troubl over or been troubl
by tale of spirit yet now he rememb montalvo remark about a
ghost and of a sureti he felt as though on were with him there in
thi strang and new alarm he sought for comfort and could think of none
save that which an old and simpl pastor had recommend to him in all
hour of doubt and danger name if it could be had to clasp a bibl
to hi heart and prai
well both thing were easi rais himself in bed in a moment he had
taken the book from it hidingplac and close the panel then press
it against hi breast between himself and the mattress he lai down
again and it would seem that the charm work for present he wa
asleep
yet dirk dream a veri evil dream he dream that a tall black figur
lean over him and that a long white hand wa stretch out to hi
bedhead where it wander to and fro till at last he heard the panel
slide home with a rattl nois
then it seem to him that he woke and that hi ey met two ey bent
down over him ey which search him as though thei would read the
veri secret of hi heart he did not stir he could not but lo
in thi dream of hi the figur straighten itself and glide awai
appear and disappear as it cross the bar of moonlight until it
vanish by the door
a while later and dirk woke up in truth to find that although the night
wa cold enough the sweat ran in big drop from hi brow and bodi but
now strang enough hi fear wa gone and know that he had but
dream a dream he turn over touch the bibl on hi breast and
fell sleep like a child to be awaken onli by the light of the
rise winter sun pour on hi face
then dirk rememb that dream of the bygon night and hi heart grew
heavi for it seem to him that thi vision of a dark woman search
hi face with those dread ey wa a portent of evil not far awai

lysbeth look up unabl to conceal her anxieti
oh jufvrouw let me beg of you to learn to control your express
the open face of childhood is so danger in these dai
he is my cousin
i know were he anyth more i should be so griev but we can most
of us spare a cousin or two
if you would ceas amus yourself senor
and come to the point of cours i will well the result of my
inquiri ha been to find out that thi worthi person is a heret of
the most pernici sort i said inquiri but there wa no need for me
to make ani he ha been
not denounc broke in lysbeth
oh my dear ladi again that telltal emot from which all sort of
thing might be conclud yesdenouncedbut fortun to myself as
a person appoint under the edict it will i fear be my duti to have
him arrest thi eveningy wish to sit down allow me to hand you a
chairbut i shall not deal with the case myself inde i propos
to pass him over to the worthi ruard tapper the papal inquisitor you
knoweveri on ha heard of the unpleas tapperwho is to visit
leyden next week and who no doubt will make short work of him
what ha he done ask lysbeth in a low voic and bend down her
head to hide the work of her featur
done my dear ladi it is almost too dread to tell you thi
misguid and unfortun young man with anoth person whom the
wit have not been abl to identifi wa seen at midnight read
the bibl
the bibl why should that be wrong
hush ar you also a heret do you not know that all thi heresi
spring from the read of the bibl you see the bibl is a veri
strang book it seem that there ar mani thing in it which when
read by an ordinari layman appear to mean thi or that when read by a
consecr priest howev thei mean someth quit differ in the
same wai there ar mani doctrin which the layman cannot find in the
bibl that to the consecr ey ar plain as the sun and the moon
the differ between heresi and orthodoxi is in short the differ
between what can actual be found in the letter of thi remark
work and what is realli thereaccord to their holi
almost thou persuadest me began lysbeth bitterli
hush ladyto be what you ar an angel
there came a paus
what will happen to him ask lysbeth
afteraft the usual pain preliminari to discov accomplic
i presum the stake but possibl as he ha the freedom of leyden he
might get off with hang
is there no escap
montalvo walk to the window and look out of it remark that
he thought it wa go to snow then suddenli he wheel round and
stare hard at lysbeth ask
ar you realli interest in thi heret and do you desir to save
him
lysbeth heard and knew at onc that the button were off the foil the
banter whimsic tone wa gone now her tormentor voic wa stern
and cold the voic of a man who wa plai for great stake and meant
to win them
she also gave up fenc
i am and i do she answer
then it can be doneat a price
what price
yourself in marriag within three week
lysbeth quiver slightli then sat still
would not my fortun do instead she ask
oh what a poor substitut you offer me montalvo said with a return
to hi hate banter then he ad that offer might be consid
were it not for the abomin law which you have here in practic it
would be almost imposs for you to hand over ani larg sum much of
which is repres by real estat to a man who is not your husband
therefor i am afraid i must stipul that you and your possess
shall not be separ
again lysbeth sat silent montalvo watch her with genuin interest
saw sign of rebellion perchanc of despair he saw the woman mental
and physic loath of himself conquer her fear for dirk unless
he wa much mistaken she wa about to defi him which as a matter of
fact would have prove exceedingli awkward as hi pecuniari resourc
were exhaust also on the veri insuffici evid which he
possess he would not have dare to touch dirk and thu to make
himself a thousand power enemi
it is strang he said that the ironi of circumst should reduc
me to plead for a rival but lysbeth van hout befor you answer
i beg you to think upon the next movement of your lip it depend
whether that bodi you love shall be stretch upon the rack whether
those ey which you find pleasant shall grow blind with agoni in the
dark of a dungeon and whether that flesh which you think desir
shall scorch and wither in the furnac or on the other hand whether
none of these thing shall happen whether thi young man shall go free
to be for a month or two a littl piqueda littl bitterabout the
inconst of women and then to marri some opul and respect
heret sure you could scarc hesit oh where is the
selfsacrif spirit of the sex of which we hear so much choos
still there wa no answer montalvo plai hi trump card drew from
hi vest an officiallook document seal and sign
thi he said is the inform to be given to the incorrupt
ruard trapper look here written on it is your cousin name my
servant wait for me in your kitchen if you hesit ani longer i call
him and in your presenc charg him to hand that paper to the messeng
who start thi afternoon for brussel onc given it cannot be recal
and the piou dirk doom is seal
lysbeth spirit began to break how can i she ask it is true
that we ar not affianc perhap for thi veri reason which i now
learn but he care for me and know that i care for him must i then
in addit to the loss of him be rememb all hi life as littl
better than a lightoflov caught by the trick and glitter of such a
man as you i tell you that first i will kill myself
again montalvo went to the window for thi hint of suicid wa most
disconcert no on can marri a dead woman and lysbeth wa scarc
like to leav a will in hi favour it seem that what troubl her
particularli wa the fear lest the young man should think her conduct
light well why should she not give him a reason which he would be the
first to acknowledg as excel for break with him could she a
cathol be expect to wed a heret and could he not be made to tell
her that he wa a heret
behold an answer to hi question the saint themselv desir that
thi pearl of price should continu to rest in the bosom of the true
church had interf in hi behalf for there in the street below wa
dirk van goorl approach lysbeth door ye there he wa dress
in hi best burgher suit hi brow knit with thought hi step
hesit a veri pictur of the timid doubt lover
lysbeth van hout said the count turn to her as it chanc the
heer dirk van goorl is at your door you will admit him and thi matter
can be settl on wai or the other i wish to point out to you how
needless it is that the young man should be left believ that you have
treat him ill all which is necessari is that you should ask whether
or no he is of your faith if i know him he will not lie to you then
it remain onli for you to sayfor doubtless the man come here to seek
your handthat howev much it mai griev you to give such an answer
you can take no heret to husband do you understand
lysbeth bow her head
then listen you will admit your suitor you will allow him to make
hi offer to you nowif he is so inclin you will befor give ani
answer ask him of hi faith if he repli that he is a heret you
will dismiss him as kindli as you wish if he repli that he is a true
servant of the church you will sai that you have heard a differ tale
and must have time to make inquiri rememb also that if by on jot
you do otherwis than i have bid you when dirk van goorl leav the
room you see him for the last time unless it pleas youto attend
hi execut wherea if you obei and dismiss him final as the door
shut behind him i put thi inform in the fire and satisfi you that
the evid upon which it is base is for ever depriv of weight and
done with
lysbeth look a question
i see you ar wonder how i should know what you do or do not do
it is simpl i shall be the harmless but observ wit of your
interview over thi doorwai hang a tapestri you will grant me the
privilegenot a great on for a futur husbandof step behind it
never never said lysbeth i cannot be put to such a shame i defi
you
as she spoke came the sound of knock at the street door glanc up
at montalvo for the second time she saw that look which he had worn
at the crisi of the sledg race all it urban it careless
bonhomi had vanish instead of these appear a reflect of the
last and innermost natur of the man the rock foundat as it were
upon which wa built the fals and decor superstructur that he
show to the world there were the glare ey there the grin
teeth of the spanish wolf a raven brute readi to rend and tear if
so he might satisfi himself with the meat hi soul desir
dont plai trick with me he mutter and dont argu for there

psalmsing fellow blood and look you dont try set him on

the servant announc him go to the door and order that he is to be
admit and pick up hi plume hat which might have betrai him
montalvo step behind the arra
for a moment lysbeth stood think ala she could see no possibl
escap she wa in the toil the rope wa about her throat either
she must obei or so she thought she must give the man she love to a
dread death for hi sake she would do it for hi sake and might god
forgiv her might god aveng her and him

that it caus him to look up but he saw noth for her head wa

as for lysbeth she cast herself at full length and in the bitter of
her heart beat her brow upon the board
when the front door had shut behind dirk but not befor montalvo
emerg from hi hide place and stood over the prostrat lysbeth he
tri to adopt hi airi and sarcast manner but he wa shaken by the
scene which he had overheard shaken and somewhat frighten also for
he felt that he had call into be passion of which the forc and
fruit could not be calcul

then the fear of lysbeth van hout fell upon him that fear which wa to
haunt him all hi life he turn and crept from the room and hi face
wa like the face of an old man nor notwithstand the height of hi
immedi success could hi heart have been more heavi if lysbeth
had been an angel sent straight from heaven to proclaim to him the
unalter doom of god
chapter vii
hendrik brant ha a visitor
nine month had gone by and for more then eight of them lysbeth had
been known as the countess juan de montalvo inde of thi there could
be no doubt sinc she wa marri with some ceremoni by the bishop in
the groot kerk befor the ey of all men folk had wonder much at
these hurri nuptial though some of the more illnatur shrug
their shoulder and said that when a young woman had compromis
herself by long and lone drive with a spanish cavali and wa in
consequ drop by her own admir why the best thing she could do
wa to marri as soon as possibl
so the pair who look handsom enough befor the altar were wed
and went to tast of such nuptial bliss as wa reserv for them in
lysbeth comfort hous in the bree straat here thei live almost
alon for lysbeth countrymen and women show their disapprov
of her conduct by avoid her compani and for reason of hi own
montalvo did not encourag the visit of spaniard at hi hous
moreov the servant were chang while tant clara and the girl
greta had also disappear inde lysbeth find out the fals
part which thei had plai toward her dismiss them both befor her
marriag
it will be guess that after the event that led to their union lysbeth
took littl pleasur in her husband societi she wa not on of those
women who can acquiesc in marriag by fraud or captur and even learn
to love the hand which snare them so it came about that to montalvo
she spoke veri seldom inde after the first week of marriag she onli
saw him on rare occas veri soon he found out that hi presenc wa
hate to her and turn her detest to account with hi usual
clever in other word lysbeth bought freedom by part with her
propertyin fact a regular tariff wa establish so mani guilder
for a week liberti so mani for a month
thi wa an arrang that suit montalvo well enough for in hi
heart he wa terrifi of thi woman whose beauti face had frozen
into a perpetu mask of watch hatr he could not forget that
fright curs which had taken deep root in hi superstiti mind and
alreadi seem to flourish there for it wa true that sinc she spoke
it he had never known a quiet hour how could he when he wa haunt
night and dai by the fear lest hi wife should murder him
sure if ever death look out of a woman ey it look out of
her and it seem to him that such a deed might troubl her conscienc
littl that she might consid it in the light of an execut and not
as a murder bah he could not bear to think of it what would it be
to drink hi wine on dai and then feel a hand of fire grip at hi
vital becaus poison had been set within the cup or wors still
if anyth could be wors to wake at night and find a stiletto point
grate against hi backbon littl wonder that montalvo slept alon
and wa alwai care to lock hi door
he need not have taken such precaut whatev her ey might sai
lysbeth had no intent of kill thi man in that prayer of her she
had as it were place the matter in the hand of a higher power and
there she meant to leav it feel quit convinc that although
vengeanc might tarri it would fall at last as for her monei he could
have it from the begin her instinct told her that her husband
object wa not amor but pure monetari a fact of which she soon
had plenti proof and her great inde her onli hope wa that when
the wealth wa gone he would go too an otter sai the dutch proverb
doe not nest in a dry dyke
but oh what month those were what dread month from time to time
she saw her husbandwhen he want cashand everi night she heard him
return home often with unsteadi step twice or thrice a week also
she wa command to prepar a luxuri meal for himself and some six
or eight companion to be follow by a gambl parti at which the
stake rule high then in the morn befor he wa up strang peopl
would arriv jew some of them and wait till thei could see him or
catch him as he slip from the hous by a back wai these men lysbeth
discov were dun seek payment of old debt under such constant
call her fortun which if substanti wa not great melt rapidli
soon the readi monei wa gone then the share in certain ship were
sold then the land and the hous itself were mortgag

she be forc to endur the contamin of hi touchthat wa her
thought she wa sure that the stori wa true were it not true who
could have move the author to take action against him moreov
now that she had the kei a thousand thing were explain trivial
enough in themselv each of them but in their sum amount to proof
posit of hi guilt had he not spoken of some entangl in

rememb all these thing she wa free she wa free and there on the
tabl still lai the symbol of her bondag the emerald ring that wa to
give him the mean of flight a flight from thi charg which he knew
wa hang over him she took it up dash it to the ground and
stamp upon it next she fell upon her knee prais and bless
god and then worn out crept awai to rest
the morn came the still and beauti autumn morn but now
all her exult had left her and lysbeth wa depress and heavi
heart she rose and assist the on servant who remain in the hous
to prepar their breakfast take no heed of the sidelong glanc that
the woman cast at her afterward she went to the market to spend some
of her last florin in necessari here and in the street she becam
awar that she wa the object of remark for peopl nudg each other
and stare at her moreov as she hurri home appal her quick
ear caught the convers of two coars women while thei walk behind
her
she got it now said on
serv her right too answer the other for run after and
marri a spanish don
marri broke in the first it wa the best that she could do she
couldnt stop to ask question some corps must be buri quickli
glanc behind her lysbeth saw the creatur nip her nostril with her
finger as though to shut out an evil smell
then she could bear it no longer and turn upon them
you ar evil slander she said and walk awai swiftli pursu by
the sound of their loud insult laughter
at the hous she wa told that two men were wait to see her thei
prove to be creditor clamour for larg sum of monei which she
could not pai lysbeth told them that she knew noth of the matter
thereupon thei show her her own write at the foot of deed and she
rememb that she had sign more thing than she chose to keep count
of everyth inde that the man who call himself her husband put
befor her if onli to win an hour of bless freedom from hi presenc
at length the dun went awai vow that thei would have their monei if
thei drag the bed from under her
after that came loneli and silenc no friend appear to cheer her
inde she had no friend left for by her husband command she had
broken off her acquaint with all who after the strang circumst
connect with her marriag were still inclin to know her he said
that he would have no chatter dutch vrouw about the hous and thei
said and believ that the countess de montalvo had becom too proud to
associ with those of her own class and peopl
middai came and she could eat no food inde she had touch none for
twentyfour hour her gorg rose against it although in her state
she need food now the shame of her posit began to come home to
lysbeth she wa a wife and no wife soon she must bear the burden of
motherhood and oh what would that child be and what should she be
it mother what too would dirk think of her dirk for whom she had
done and suffer all these thing through the long afternoon hour she
lai upon her bed think such thought as these till at length her mind
gave and lysbeth grew lighthead her brain becam a chao a perfect
hell of distort imagin
then out of it turmoil and confus rose a vision and a desir a
vision of peac and a desir for rest but what rest wa there for her
except the rest of death well why not die god would forgiv her the
mother of god would plead for her who wa shame and brokenheart and
unfit to live even dirk would think kindli of her when she wa dead
though doubtless now if he met her he would cover hi ey with hi
hand she wa burn hot and she wa thirsti how cool the water would
be on thi fever night what could be better than to slip into it and
slowli let it close abov her poor ach head she would go out and
look at the water in that at ani rate there could be no harm
she wrap herself in a long cloak and drew it hood over her head
then she slip from the hous and stole like a ghost through the
darkl street and out of the maren or sea poort where the guard let
her pass think that she wa a countri woman return to her villag
now the moon wa rise and by the light of it lysbeth recognis
the place here wa the spot where she had stood on the dai of the ic
carniv when that woman who wa call martha the mare and who said
that she had known her father had spoken to her on that water she had
gallop in montalvo sledg and up yonder canal the race wa run
she follow along it bank rememb the reedi mere some mile
awai spot with islet that were onli visit from time to time by
fishermen and wildfowl the great haarlem meer which cover mani
thousand of acr of ground that mere she felt must look veri cool and
beauti on such a night as thi and the wind would whisper sweetli
among the tall bulrush which fring it bank
on lysbeth went and on it wa a long long walk but at last she came
there and oh the place wa sweet and vast and lone for so far as
her ey could reach in the light of the low moon there wa noth but
glimmer water broken here and there by the reedwreath island
hark how the frog croak and the bittern boom among the rush
look where the wild duck swam leav behind them broad trail of
silver as their breast broke the surfac of the great mere into
rippl line
there on an island not a bowshot from her grew tuft of a daisylik
marsh bloom white flower such as she rememb gather when she wa
a child a desir came upon her to pluck some of these flower and the
water wa shallow sure she could wade to the island or if not what
did it matter then she could turn to the bank again or she might stai
to sleep a while in the water what did it matter she step from
the bankhow sweet and cool it felt to her feet now it wa up to
her knee now it reach her middl and now the littl wavelet beat
against her breast but she would not go back for there ahead of her
wa the island and the white flower were so close that she could count
them eight upon on bunch and twelv upon the next anoth step and
the water struck her in the face on more and it close abov her head
she rose and a low cry broke from her lip
then as in a dream lysbeth saw a skiff glide out from among the rush
befor her she saw also a strang mutil face which she rememb
dimli bend over the edg of the boat and a long brown hand
stretch out to clasp her while a hoars voic bade her keep still and
fear noth
after thi came a sound of sing in her ear anddark
when lysbeth woke again she found herself ly upon the ground or
rather upon a soft mattress of dry reed and aromat grass look
round her she saw that she wa in a hut reedroof and plaster with
thick mud in on corner of thi hut stood a fireplac with a chimnei
artfulli built of clai and on the fire of turf boil an earthen pot
hang from the roof by a string of twist grass wa a fish fresh
caught a splendid pike and near to it a bunch of smoke eel over her
also wa thrown a magnific rug of otter skin note these thing
she gather that she must be in the hovel of some fisherman
now by degre the past came back to lysbeth and she rememb her
part with the man who call himself her husband rememb also her
moonlight flight and how she had wade out into the water of the great
mere to pluck the white flower and how as thei close abov her
head a hand had been stretch out to save her lysbeth rememb
and rememb she sigh aloud the sound of her sigh seem to
attract the attent of some on who wa listen outsid the hut at
ani rate a rough door wa open or push asid and a figur enter
ar you awak ladi ask a hoars voic
ye answer lysbeth but tell me how did i come here and who ar
you
the figur step back so that the light from the open door fell full
upon it look carolu van hout daughter and juan montalvo wife
those who have seen me onc do not forget me
lysbeth sat up on the bed and stare at the gaunt power form
the deepset grei ey the widespread nostril the scar high
cheekbon the teeth made promin by some devil work upon the
lip and the grizzl lock of hair that hung across the forehead in an
instant she knew her
you ar martha the mare she said
ye i am the mare none other and you ar in the mare stabl what
ha he been do to you that spanish dog that you came last night to
ask the great water to hide you and your shame
lysbeth made no answer the stori seem hard to begin with thi strang
woman then martha went on
what did i tell you lysbeth van hout did i not sai that your blood
should warn you against the spaniard well well you save me from the
ic and i have save you from the water ah who wa it that led me to
row round by that outer isl last night becaus i could not sleep but
what doe it matter god will it so and here you lie in the mare
stabl nai do not answer me first you must eat
then go to the pot she took it from the fire pour it content
into an earthen basin and at the smell of them for the first time
for dai lysbeth felt hungri of what that stew wa compound she never
learn but she at it to the last spoon and wa thank while
martha seat on the ground besid her watch her with delight from
time to time stretch out a long thin hand to touch the brown hair
that hung about her shoulder
come out and look said martha when her guest had done eat and she
led her through the doorwai of the hut
lysbeth gaze round her but in truth there wa not much to see the hut
itself wa hidden awai in a littl clump of swamp willow that grew upon
a mound in the midst of a marshi plain broken here and there by patch
of reed and bulrush walk across thi plain for a hundr yard or
so thei came to more reed and in them a boat hidden cunningli for
here wa the water of the lake and not fifti pace awai what seem
to be the shore of an island the mare bade her get into the boat and
row her across to thi island then round it to anoth and thenc to
anoth and yet anoth
now tell me she said upon which of them is my stabl built
lysbeth shook her head helplessli
you cannot tell no nor ani live man i sai that no man live who
could find it save i myself who know the path there by night or by
dai look and she point to the vast surfac of the mere on thi
great sea ar thousand of such islet and befor thei find me the
spaniard must search them all for here upon the lone water no
spi or hound will help them then she began to row again without even
look round and present thei were in the clump of reed from which
thei had start
i must be go home falter lysbeth
no answer martha it is too late you have slept long look the
sun is wester fast thi night you must stop with me oh do not be
afraid my fare is rough but it is sweet and fresh and plenti fish
from the mere as much as you will for who can catch them better than i
and waterfowl that i snare ye and their egg moreov dri flesh
and bacon which i get from the mainland for there i have friend whom
sometim i meet at night
so lysbeth yield for the great peac of thi lake pleas her oh
after all that she had gone through it wa like heaven to watch the sun
sink toward the quiet water to hear the wildfowl call to see the
fish leap and the halcyon flash by and abov all to be sure that by
noth short of a miracl could thi divin silenc broken onli by
natur voic be defil with the sound of the hate accent of the
man who had ruin and betrai her ye she wa weari and a strang
unaccustom langour crept over her she would rest there thi night
also
so thei went back to the hut and made readi their even meal and as
she fri the fish over the fire of peat verili lysbeth found herself
laugh like a girl again then thei at it with appetit and after
it wa done mother martha prai aloud ye and without fear although
she knew lysbeth to be a cathol read from her on treasur a
testament crouch there in the light of the fire and sai
see ladi what a place thi is for a heret to hide in where els
mai a woman read from the bibl and fear no spy or priest rememb
a certain stori lysbeth shiver at her word
now said the mare when she had finish read tell me befor
you sleep what it wa that brought you into the water of the haarlem
meer and what that spanish man ha done to you do not be afraid for
though i am mad or so thei sai i can keep counsel and between you and
me ar mani bond carolu van hout daughter some of which you know
and see and some that you can neither know nor see but which god will
weav in hi own season
lysbeth look at the weird counten distort and made unhuman by
long torment of bodi and mind and found in it someth to trust ye
even sign of that sympathi which she so sore need so she told her
all the tale from the first word of it to the last
the mare listen in silenc for no stori of evil perpetr by a
spaniard seem to move or astonish her onli when lysbeth had done she
said
ah child had you but known of me and where to find me you should
have ask my aid
why mother what could you have done answer lysbeth
done i would have follow him by night until i found my chanc in
some lone place and there i would have then she stretch out
her boni hand to the red light of the fire and lysbeth saw that in it
wa a knife
she sank back aghast
why ar you frighten my pretti ladi ask the mare i tell you
that i live on for onli on thingto kill spaniard ye priest first
and then the other oh i have a long count to pai for everi time that
he wa tortur a life for everi groan he utter at the stake a life
ye so mani for the father and half as mani for the son well i shall
live to be old i know that i shall live to be old and the count will
be discharg ay to the last stiver
as she spoke the outlaw water wife had risen and the flare of the
fire struck full upon her it wa an aw face that lysbeth beheld by
the light of it full of fierc and energi the face of an inspir
aveng dread and unnatur yet not altogeth repuls inde that
counten wa such as an imagin artist might give to on of the
beast in the book of revel amaz and terrifi lysbeth said
noth
i frighten you gentl on went on the mare you who although
you have suffer ar still full of the milk of human kind wait
woman wait till thei have murder the man you love till your heart is
like my heart and you also live on not for love sake not for life
sake but to be a sword a sword a sword in the hand of god
ceas i prai you said lysbeth in a low voic i am faint i am
ill
ill she wa inde and befor morn there in that lone hovel on
the island of the mere a son wa born to her
when she wa strong enough her nurs spoke
will you keep the brat or shall i kill it she ask
how can i kill my child said lysbeth
it is the spaniard child also and rememb the curs you told me of
your own curs utter on thi thing befor ever you were marri if
it live that curs shall cling to it and through it you too shall be
accurs best let me kill it and have done
how can i kill my own child touch it not answer lysbeth sullenli
so the blackei boi live and throve
somewhat slowli ly there in the island hut lysbeth won back her
strength the mare or mother martha as lysbeth had now learn to call
her tend her as few midwiv would have done food too she had
in plenti for martha snare the fowl and caught the fish or she made
visit to the mainland and thenc brought egg and milk and flesh
which so she said the boor of that countri gave her as much as she
want of them also to while awai the hour she would read to her out
of the testament and from that read lysbeth learnt mani thing which
until then she had not known inde befor it wa done withcathol
though she wassh began to wonder in what lai the wicked of these
heret and how it came about that thei were worthi of death and
torment sinc sooth to sai in thi book she could find no law to
which their live and doctrin seem to give offenc
thu it happen that martha the fierc halfcrazi waterdwel
sow the seed in lysbeth heart that wa to bear fruit in due season
when three week had gone by and lysbeth wa on her feet again though
as yet scarc strong enough to travel martha told her that she had
busi which would keep her from home a night but what the busi
wa she refus to sai accordingli on a certain afternoon have left
good store of all thing to lysbeth hand the mare depart in her
skiff nor did she return till after middai on the morrow now lysbeth
talk of leav the island but martha would not suffer it sai
that if she desir to go she must swim and inde when lysbeth went
to look she found that the boat had been hidden elsewher so noth
loth she stai on and in the crisp autumn air her health and beauti
came back to her till she wa onc more much as she had been befor the
dai when she went sledg with juan de montalvo
on a novemb morn leav her infant in the hut with martha who
had sworn to her on the bibl that she would not harm it lysbeth walk
to the extrem of the island dure the night the first sharp frost
of late autumn had fallen make a thin film of ic upon the surfac
of the lake which melt rapidli as the sun grew high the air too wa
veri clear and calm and among the reed now turn golden at their
tip the finch flew and chirp forget that winter wa at hand
so sweet and peac wa the scene that lysbeth also forget of mani
thing survei it with a kind of raptur she knew not why but her
heart wa happi that morn it wa as though a dark cloud had pass
from her life as though the blue ski of peac and joi were spread
about her doubtless other cloud might appear upon the horizon
doubtless in their season thei would appear but she felt that thi
horizon wa as yet a long wai off and meanwhil abov her bent the
tender sky seren and sweet and happi
upon the crisp grass behind her suddenli she heard a footfal a new
footfal not that of the long stealthi stride of martha who wa
call the mare and swung round upon her heel to meet it
oh god who wa thi oh god there befor her stood dirk van goorl
dirk and no other than dirk unless she dream dirk with hi kind
face wreath in a happi smile dirk with hi arm outstretch toward
her lysbeth said noth she could not speak onli she stood still
gaze gaze gaze and alwai he came on till now hi arm were
round her then she sprang back
do not touch me she cri rememb what i am and why i stai here
i know well what you ar lysbeth he answer slowli you ar the
holiest and purest woman who ever walk thi earth you ar an angel
upon thi earth you ar the woman who gave her honour to save the man
she love oh be silent be silent i have heard the stori i know it
everi word and here i kneel befor you and next to my god i worship

but the child she murmur it live and it is mine and the man
dirk face harden a littl but he onli answer
we must bear our burden you have born your i must bear mine and
he seiz her hand and kiss them ye and the hem of her garment and
kiss it also
so these two plight their troth
afterward lysbeth heard all the stori montalvo had been put upon hi
trial and as it chanc thing went hard with him among hi judg
on wa a great netherland lord who desir to uphold the right of
hi countrymen on wa a high ecclesiast who wa furiou becaus of
the fraud that had been plai upon the church which had been trap
into celebr a bigam marriag and a third wa a spanish grande

to the hilt against him by the evid of the priest who brought the
letter of the wife letter and of the trucul black meg who now
found an opportun of pai back hot water for cold there wa
littl merci hi charact wa bad and it wa said moreov that
becaus of hi cruelti and the shame she had suffer at hi hand
lysbeth van hout had commit suicid at least thi wa certain that
she wa seen run at night toward the haarlem meer and that after
thi search as her friend would noth more could be heard of her
so that an exampl might be made although he writh and fenc hi
best the nobl captain count juan de montalvo wa sent to serv for
fourteen year in the gallei as a common slave and there for the
while wa an end of him
there also wa an end of the strang and tragic courtship of dirk van
goorl and lysbeth van hout
six month afterward thei were marri and by dirk wish took the
child who wa christen adrian to live with them a few month later

fashion unaid by imag and priest
although so long a time had pass as it chanc those personag with
whom we have alreadi made acquaint in thi histori were still aliv
let us begin with two of them on of whom we know and on of
whom although we have heard of him befor will requir some
introductiondirk van goorl and hi son foi
scenean upper room abov a warehous overlook the marketplac
of leyden a room with small window and approach by two staircas
time a summer twilight the faint light which penetr into thi
chamber through the unshutt window for to curtain them would have
been to excit suspicion show that about twenti peopl were gather
there among whom were on or two women for the most part thei were men
of the better class middleag burgher of sober mien some of whom
stood about in knot while other were seat upon stool and bench
at the end of the room address them wa a man well on in middl life
with grizzl hair and beard small and somewhat mean of statur yet
on through whose poor exterior good seem to flow like light
through some rough casement of horn thi wa jan arentz the famou
preacher by trade a basketmak a man who show himself steadfast
to the new religion through all afflict and who wa gift with a
spirit which could remain unmov amidst the horror of perhap the most
terribl persecut that christian have suffer sinc the dai of
the roman emperor he wa preach now and these peopl were hi
congreg
i come not to bring peac but a sword wa hi text and certainli
thi night it wa most appropri and on easi of illustr for
there on the veri marketplac beneath them guard by soldier and
surround with the rabbl of the citi two member of hi flock men
who a fortnight befor had worship in that same room at thi moment
were undergo martyrdom by fire
arentz preach patienc and fortitud he went back into recent histori
and told hi hearer how he himself had pass a hundr danger how he
had been hunt like a wolf how he had been tri how he had escap
from prison and from the sword of soldier even as st paul had done
befor him and how yet he live to minist to them thi night he
told them that thei must have no fear that thei must go on quit happi
quit confid take what it pleas god to send them feel that
it would all be for the best ye that even the worst would be for the
best what wa the worst some hour of torment and death and what lai
beyond the death ah let them think of that the whole world wa but a
brief and vari shadow what did it matter how or when thei walk
out of that shadow into the perfect light the sky wa veri black but
behind it the sun shone thei must look forward with the ey of faith
perhap the suffer of the present gener were part of the scheme
of thing perhap from the earth which thei water with their blood
would spring the flower of freedom that gloriou freedom in whose dai
all men would be abl to worship their creator respons onli to the
bibl law and their own conscienc not to the dogma or doctrin of
other men
as arentz spoke thu eloqu sweetli spoke like on inspir the
twilight deepen and the flare of those sacrifici fire flicker on
the window pane and the mix murmur of the crowd of wit broke
upon hi listen ear the preacher paus and look down upon the
dread scene below for from where he stood he could behold it all
mark is dead he said and our dear brother andrea jansen is
dy the execution heap the faggot round him you think it cruel
you think it piteou but i sai to you no i sai that it is a holi
and a gloriou sight for we wit the pass of soul to bliss
brethren let us prai for him who leav us and for ourselv who stai
behind ye and let us prai for those who slai him that know not what
thei do we watch hi suffer but i tell you that christ hi lord
watch also christ who hung upon the cross the victim of such men as
these he stand with him in the fire hi hand compass him hi voic
support him brethren let us prai
then at hi bid everi member of that littl congreg knelt in
prayer for the pass spirit of andrea jansen
again arentz look through the window
he di he cri a soldier ha thrust him through with a pike in
merci hi head fall forward oh god if it be thy will grant to us a
sign
some strang breath pass through that upper chamber a cold breath
which blew upon the brow of the worshipp and stir their hair
bring with it a sens of the presenc of andrea jansen the martyr
then there upon the wall opposit to the window at the veri spot where
their brother and companion andrea saint and martyr wa wont to
kneel appear the sign or what thei took to be a sign ye there
upon the whitewash wall reflect mayhap from the fire below and
show clearli in the darken room shone the vision of a fieri cross
for a second it wa seen then it wa gone but to everi soul in
thi room the vision of that cross had brought it messag to each a
separ messag an individu inspir for in the light of it thei
read strang lesson of life and death the cross vanish and there wa
silenc
brethren said the voic of arentz speak in the dark you
have seen through the fire and through the shadow follow the cross and
fear not
the servic wa over and below in the empti marketplac the
execution collect the poor calcin fragment of the martyr to
cast them with contum and filthi jest into the darkl water of
the river now on by on and two by two the worshipp slip awai
through some hidden door open on an allei let us look at three of
their number as thei crept through bye street back to a hous on the
bree straat with which we ar acquaint two of them walk in front
and on behind
the pair were dirk van goorl and hi son foyther wa no mistak
their relationship save that he had grown somewhat portli and
thought dirk wa the dirk of five and twenti year ago thickset
greyei beard a handsom man accord to the dutch standard
whose massiv kindli counten betrai the massiv kindli mind
within veri like him wa hi son foi onli hi ey were blue instead
of grei and hi hair wa yellow though thei seem sad enough just
now these were merri and pleasant ey and the round the somewhat
childlik face wa merri also the face of a person who look upon the
bright side of thing
there wa noth remark or distinguish about foi appear
but from it the observ who met him for the first time receiv an
impress of energi honesti and goodnatur in truth such were
apt to set him down as a sailorman who had just return from a long
journei in the cours of which he had come to the conclus that thi
world wa a pleasant place and on well worth explor as foi walk
down the street with hi quick and nautic gait it wa evid that
even the solemn and dread scene which he had just experienc had not
altogeth quench hi cheeri and hope spirit yet of all those who
listen to the exhort of the saintlik arentz none had laid it
burden of faith and careless for the futur to heart more entir
than foi van goorl
but of thi power of look on the bright side of thing the credit
must be given to hi natur and not to hi pieti for foi could not be
sad for long dum spiro spero would have been hi motto had he known
latin and he did not mean to grow sorrowfulov the prospect of be
burnt for instanceuntil he found himself fast to the stake it wa
thi qualiti of good spirit in a depress and melancholi ag that
made of foi so extraordinarili popular a charact
behind these two follow a much more remarkablelook personag the
frisian martin roo or red martin so name from hi hair which wa
red to the verg of flame colour and hi beard of a like hue that hung
almost to hi breast there wa no other such beard in leyden inde
the boi take advantag of hi good natur would call to him as he
pass ask him if it wa true that the stork nest in it everi
spring thi strangelook man who wa now perhap a person of forti
year of ag for ten year or more had been the faith servant of
dirk van goorl whose hous he had enter under circumst which
shall be told of in their place
ani on glanc at martin casual would not have said that he wa
a giant and yet hi height wa consider to be accur when he
stood upright someth over six feet three inch the reason why he
did not appear to be tall wa that in truth hi great bulk shorten him
to the ey and also becaus hi carri himself ill more from a desir
to conceal hi size than for ani other reason it wa in girth of
chest and limb that martin wa realli remark so much so that a
shortarm man stand befor him could not make hi finger touch
behind hi back hi face wa fair as a girl and almost as flat as a
full moon for of nose he had littl natur inde had furnish him
with on of ordinari if not excess size but certain incid in
martin earli career which in our dai would be design as that of
a prizefight had caus it to spread about hi counten in
an interest and curiou fashion hi eyebrow howev remain
promin beneath them appear a pair of veri larg round and rather
mild blue ey cover with thick white lid absolut devoid of
lash which ey had a most unholi trick of occasion take fire
when their owner wa irrit then thei could burn and blaze like
lamp ti to a barg on a dark night with an effect that wa all the
more alarm becaus the rest of hi counten remain absolut
impass
suddenli while thi littl compani went homeward a sound aros in the
quiet street as of peopl run instantli all three of them press
themselv into the doorwai of a hous and crouch down martin lift
hi ear and listen
three peopl he whisper a woman who fli and two men who
follow
at that moment a casement wa thrown open forti pace or so awai and a
hand bear a torch thrust out of it by it light thei saw the
pale face of a ladi speed toward them and after her two spanish
soldier
the vrouw andrea jansen whisper martin again fly from two of
the guard who burn her husband
the torch wa withdrawn and the casement shut with a snap in those
dai quiet burgher could not afford to be mix up in street troubl
especi if soldier had to do with them onc more the place wa
empti and quiet except for the sound of run feet
opposit to the doorwai the ladi wa overtaken oh let me go
she sob oh let me go is it not enough that you have kill my
husband why must i be hunt from my hous thu
becaus you ar so pretti my dear answer on of the brute also
you ar rich catch hold of her friend lord how she kick
foi made a motion as though to start out of the doorwai but martin
press him back with the flat of hi hand without appar effort and
yet so strongli that the young man could not move
my busi master he mutter you would make a nois and thei
heard hi breath come thick
now move with curiou stealthi for on of so great a bulk martin
wa out of the porch by the summer starlight the watcher could see
that befor thei had caught sight of or even heard him he grip
the two soldier small men like most spaniard by the nape of their
neck on in either hand and wa grind their face togeth thi
inde wa evid for hi great shoulder work visibl and their
breastplat click as thei touch but the men themselv made no
sound at all then martin seem to catch them round the middl and
behold in anoth second the pair of them had gone headlong into the
canal which ran down the centr of the street
my god he ha kill them mutter dirk
and a good job too father said foi onli i wish that i had share
in it
martin great form loom in the doorwai the vrouw jansen ha fled
awai he said and the street is quit quiet now so i think that we
had better be move befor ani see us my master
some dai later the bodi of these spanish soldier were found with
their face smash flat it wa suggest in explan of thi
plight that thei had got drunk and while fight togeth had fallen
from the bridg on to the stonework of a pier thi version of their end
found a readi accept as it consort well with the reput of
the men so there wa no search or inquiri
i had to finish the dog martin explain apologeticallymai the
lord jesu forgiv mebecaus i wa afraid that thei might know me
again by my beard
ala ala groan dirk what time ar these sai noth of thi
dread matter to your mother son or to adrian either but foi
nudg martin in the rib and mutter well done old fellow well
done
after thi experi which the reader must rememb wa noth
extraordinari in those dark and dread dai when neither the live of
men nor the safeti of womenespeci protest men and womenwer
thing of much account the three of them reach home without further
incid and quit unobserv arriv at the hous thei enter it
near the waterg by a back door that led into the stableyard it wa
open by a woman whom thei follow into a littl room where a light
burn here she turn and kiss two of them dirk first and then foi
thank god that i see you safe she said whenev you go to the
meetingplac i trembl until i hear your footstep at the door
what the us of that mother said foi your fret yourself
wont make thing better or wors
ah dear how can i help it she repli softli we cannot all be
young and cheer you know
true wife true broke in dirk though i wish we could we should be
lighterheart so and he look at her and sigh
lysbeth van goorl could no longer boast the beauti which wa her when
first we met her but she wa still a sweet and grace woman her
figur remain almost as slim as it had been in girlhood the grei
ey also retain their depth and fire onli the face wa worn though
more by care and the burden of memori than with year the lot of the
love wife and mother wa hard inde when philip the king rule in
spain and alva wa hi prophet in the netherland
is it done she ask

repli dirk
that poor vrouw jansen broke in lysbeth just marri and so young
and pretti i wonder what will becom of her
dirk and foi look at each other and martin who wa hover about
near the door slunk back guiltili into the passag as though he had
attempt to injur the vrouw jansen
tomorrow we will look to it wife and now let us eat for we ar
faint with hunger
ten minut later thei were seat at their meal the reader mai
rememb the room it wa that wherein montalvo excount and captain
made the speech which charm all hearer on the night when he had lost
the race at the icecarniv the same chandeli hung abov them some
portion of the same plate even repurchas by dirk wa on the tabl
but how differ were the compani and the feast aunt clara the
fatuou wa long dead and with her mani of the companion of that
occas some natur some by the hand of the execution while
other had fled the land pieter van de werff still live howev and
though regard with suspicion by the author wa a man of weight
and honour in the town but tonight he wa not present there the food
too if ampl wa plain not on account of the poverti of the household
for dirk had prosper in hi worldli affair be hardwork and
skil and the head of the brass foundri to which in those earli dai
he wa apprent but becaus in such time peopl thought littl
of the refin of eat when life itself is so doubt it
pleasur and amus becom of small import the ampl wait
servic of the maid greta who long ago had vanish none knew where
and her fellow domest wa now carri on by the man martin and
on old woman sinc as everi menial might be a spy even the richest
emploi few of them in short all the lighter and more cheer part
of life were in abey
where is adrian ask dirk
i do not know answer lysbeth i thought that perhap
no repli her husband hastili he did not accompani us he rare
doe
brother adrian like to look underneath the spoon befor he lick it
said foi with hi mouth full
the remark wa enigmat but hi parent seem to understand what
foi meant at least it wa follow by an uncomfort and acquiesc
silenc just then adrian came in and as we have not seen him sinc
some four and twenti year ago he made hi entri into the world on the
secret island in the haarlem meer here it mai be as well to describ
hi appear
he wa a handsom young man but of quit a differ stamp from hi
halfbroth foi be tall slight and veri grace in figur
advantag which he had inherit from hi mother lysbeth in
counten howev he differ from her so much that none would have
guess him to be her son inde adrian face wa pure spanish there
wa noth of a netherland about hi dark beauti spanish were the
ey of velvet black set rather close togeth spanish also the fine
chisel featur and the thin spread nostril spanish the cold
yet somewhat sensual mouth more apt to sneer than smile the straight
black hair the clear oliv skin and that indiffer halfweari
mien which becam it wearer well enough but in a man of hi year of
northern blood would have seem unnatur or affect
he took hi seat without speak nor did the other speak to him till
hi stepfath dirk said
you were not at the work todai adrian although we should have been
glad of your help in found the culverin
no fatherh call him fatheransw the young man in a measur
and rather melodi voic you see we dont quit know who is go to
pai for that piec or at ani rate i dont quit know as nobodi seem
to take me into confid and if it should chanc to be the lose
side well it might be enough to hang me
dirk flush up but made no answer onli foi remark
that right adrian look after your own skin
just now i find it more interest went on adrian loftili and
disregard of hi brother to studi those whom the cannon mai shoot
than to make the cannon which is to shoot them
hope you wont be on of them interrupt foi again
where have you been thi even son ask lysbeth hastili fear
a quarrel
i have been mix with the peopl mother at the scene on the
marketplac yonder
not the martyrdom of our good friend jansen sure
ye mother why not it is terribl it is a crime no doubt but
the observ of life should studi these thing there is noth more
fascin to the philosoph than the plai of human passion the
emot of the brutal crowd the stolid indiffer of the guard the
grief of the sympathis the stoical endur of the victim anim
by religi exalt
and the beauti logic of the philosoph with hi nose in the air

there an end we meet by the boshhuysen at five oclock at the big oak
in the cops where we will settl the detail
after thi simon said no more for he had thi virtu so us in
domest lifeh knew when to yield
on thi same morn adrian rose late the talk at the supper tabl on
the previou night especi foi coars uneduc sarcasm had
ruffl hi temper and when adrian temper wa ruffl he gener
found it necessari to sleep himself into good humour as the bookkeep
of the establish for hi stepfath had never been abl to induc
him to take an activ part in it work which in hi heart he consid
beneath him adrian should have been in the offic by nine oclock not
have risen befor ten howev nor eaten hi breakfast until after
eleven thi wa clearli imposs then he rememb that here wa a
good chanc of finish a sonnet of which the last line were run
in hi head it chanc that adrian wa a bit of a poet and like most
poet he found quiet essenti to the art of composit somehow when
foi wa in the hous sing and talk and that great frisian brute
martin wa tramp to and fro there wa never ani quiet for even
when he could not hear them the sens of their presenc exasper
hi nerv so now wa hi opportun especi as hi mother wa
outmarket she saidbut in all probabl engag upon some
wretch and riski busi connect with the peopl whom she call
martyr adrian determin to avail himself of it and finish hi sonnet
thi took some time first as all true artist know the muse must be
summon and she will rare arriv under an hour appropri and
gloomi contempl of thing in gener then especi in the case
of sonnet rhyme which ar stubborn and remorseless thing must be
found and arrang the pivot and object of thi particular poem wa a
certain notabl spanish beauti isabella dovanda by name she wa the
wife of a decrepit but exceedingli nobl spaniard who might almost
have been her grandfath and who had been sent as on of a commiss
appoint by king philip ii to inquir into certain financi matter
connect with the netherland
thi grande who as it happen wa a veri industri and
conscienti person among other citi had visit leyden in order to
assess the valu of the imperi due and tax the task did not take
him long becaus the burgher rude and vehement declar that under
their ancient charter thei were free from ani imperi due or tax
whatsoev nor could the nobl marquiss argument move them to a more
ration view still he argu for a week and dure that time hi
wife the love isabella dazzl the women of the town with her
costum and the men with her exceedingli attract person
especi did she dazzl the romant adrian henc the poetri on the
whole the rhyme went pretti well though there were difficulti but
with industri he got round them final the sonnet a highflown and
veri absurd composit wa complet
by now it wa time to eat inde there ar few thing that make a man
hungrier than longcontinu poetic exercis so adrian at in the
midst of the meal hi mother return pale and anxiousfac for the
poor woman had been engag in make arrang for the safeti of the
beggar widow of the martyr jansen a pathet and even a danger
task in hi own wai adrian wa fond of hi mother but be a selfish
puppi he took but littl note of her care or mood therefor seiz
the opportun of an audienc he insist upon read to her hi
sonnet not onc but sever time
veri pretti my son veri pretti murmur lysbeth through whose
bewild brain the stilt and meaningless word buzz like bee in
an empti hive though i am sure i cannot guess how you find the heart
in such time as these to write poetri to fine ladi whom you do not
know
poetri mother said adrian sententi is a great consol it
lift the mind from the contempl of petti and sordid care
petti and sordid care repeat lysbeth wonderingli then she ad
with a kind of cry oh adrian have you no heart that you can watch
a saint burn and come home to philosophis about hi agoni will you
never understand if you could have seen that poor woman thi morn
who onli three month ago wa a happi bride then burst into tear
lysbeth turn and fled from the room for she rememb that what wa
the fate of the vrouw jansen todai tomorrow might be her own
thi show of emot quit upset adrian whose nerv were delic
and who be honestli attach to hi mother did not like to see her
weep
pest on the whole thing he thought to himself why cant we go awai
and live in some pleasant place where thei havent got ani religion
unless it is the worship of venu ye a place of orang grove and
run stream and pretti women with guitar who like have sonnet
read to them and
at thi moment the door open and martin huge and flame poll
appear
the master want to know if you ar come to the work heer adrian
and if not will you be so good as to give me the kei of the strongbox
as he need the cash book
with a groan adrian rose to go then chang hi mind no after that
perfum vision of green grove and love ladi it wa imposs for
him to face the malodor and prosaic foundri
tell them i cant come he said draw the kei from hi pocket
veri good heer adrian why not
becaus i am write
write what queri martin
a sonnet
what a sonnet ask martin blankli
illeduc clown murmur adrian thenwith a sudden inspir
ill show you what a sonnet is i will read it to you come in and
shut the door martin obei and wa duli reward with the sonnet of
which he understood noth at all except the name of the ladi isabella
dovanda but martin wa not without the guil of the serpent
beauti he said beauti read it again master
adrian did so with much delight rememb the tale of how the music
of orpheu had charm the veri beast
ah said martin that a lovelett isnt it to that splendid
blackei marchio whom i saw look at you
well not exactli said adrian highli pleas although to tell the
truth he could not recollect upon what occas the fair isabella had
favour him with her kind glanc yet i suppos that you might call
it so an idealis lovelett a letter in which ardent and distant
yet tender admir is wrapt with the veil of vers
quit so well master adrian just you send it to her
you dont think that she might be offend queri adrian doubtfulli
offend said martin if she is i know noth of women as a
matter of fact he didnt no she will be veri pleas shell take
it awai and read it by herself and sleep with it under her pillow until
she know it by heart and then i daresai she will ask you to come and
see her well i must be off but thank you for read me the beauti
poetri letter heer adrian
realli reflect adrian as the door close behind him thi is
anoth instanc of the deceit of appear i alwai thought
martin a great brutal fool yet in hi breast uncultur as it is the
sacr spark still smoulder and then and there he made up hi mind
that he would read martin a further select of poem upon the first
opportun
if onli adrian could have been a wit to the scene which at that veri
moment wa in progress at the work martin have deliv the kei
of the box sought out foi and proceed to tell him the stori more
perfidi on he hand over a rough draft of the sonnet which he had
surreptiti garner from the floor to foi who clad in a leather
apron and seat on the edg of a cast read it eagerli
i told him to send it went on martin and by st peter i think he
will and then if he doesnt have old don diaz after him with a pistol
in on hand and a stiletto in the other my name isnt martin roo
of cours of cours gasp foi kick hi leg into the air
with delight why thei call the old fellow sing jaloux oh it
capit and i onli hope that he open the ladi letter
thu did foi the commonplac and practic make a mock of the poetic
effort of the highsoul and sentiment adrian
meanwhil adrian feel that he requir air after hi literari
labour fetch hi peregrin from it perchfor he wa fond of
hawkingand set it on hi wrist start out to find a quarri on
the marsh near the town
befor he wa halfwai down the street he had forgotten all about the
sonnet and the love isabella hi wa a curiou tempera and thi
sentiment born of vain and idl hour by no mean express
it all that he wa what we should nowadai call a prig we know and
also that he possess hi father montalvo readi of speech
without hi father sens of humour in him as martin had hint the
strain of the sire predomin for in all essenti adrian wa as
spanish in mind as in appear
for instanc the sudden and violent passion into which he wa apt to
fall if thwart or overlook were pure spanish there seem to be
noth of the patient phlegmat netherland about thi side of him
inde it wa thi temper of hi perhap more than ani other desir or
tendenc that made him so danger for wherea the impuls of hi
heart were often good enough thei were alwai liabl to be pervert by
some access of suddenli provok rage
from hi birth up adrian had mix littl with spaniard and everi
influenc about him especi that of hi mother the be whom he
most love on earth had been antispanish yet were he an hidalgo
fresh from the court at the escuri he could scarc have been
more castilian thu he had been brought up in what might be call
a republican atmospher yet he wa without sympathi for the love of
liberti which anim the peopl of holland the sturdi independ
of the netherland their perpetu critic of king and establish
rule their vulgar and unheardof assumpt that the good thing of
the world were free to all honest and hardwork citizen and not
mere the birthright of blue blood did not appeal to adrian also from
childhood he had been a member of the dissent church on of the
new religion yet at heart he reject thi faith with it humbl
professor and pastor it simpl and sometim squalid rite it
long and earnest prayer offer to the almighti in the damp of a cellar
or the reek of a cowhous
like thousand of hi spanish fellowcountrymen he wa constitution
unabl to appreci the fact that true religion and true faith ar the
natur fruit of penit and effort and that individu repent
and strive ar the onli sacrific requir of man
for safeti sake like most polit netherland adrian wa call
upon from time to time to attend worship in the cathol church he
did not find the oblig irksom in fact the form and rite of
that state ceremoni the move pictur of the mass in those
dim aisl the peal of the music and the sweet voic of hidden
choristersal these thing unseal a fountain in hi bosom and at
while move him well nigh to tear the system appeal to him also
and he could understand that in it were joi and comfort for here wa
to be found forgiv of sin not far off in the heaven but at hand
upon the earth forgiv to all who bent the head and paid the fee
here readi made by that princ of armour a church that claim to
be directli inspir wa a har of proof which after the death he
dread for he wa full of spiritu fear and superstit would
suffic to turn the shaft of satan from hi poor shiver soul
howev steep in crime wa not thi a more servic and practic
faith than that of these loudvoic rudehand lutheran among whom
he live men who elect to cast asid thi armour and trust instead to
a buckler forg by their faith and prayersy and to give up their
evil wai and subdu their own desir that thei might forg it better
such were the thought of adrian secret heart but as yet he had never
act on them sinc howev much he might wish to do so he had not
found the courag to break awai from the influenc of hi surround
hi surroundingsah how he hate them how he hate them for veri
shame sake inde he could not live in complet idl among
folk who were alwai busi therefor he act as account in hi
stepfath busi keep the book of the foundri in a scanti and
ineffici fashion or write letter to distant custom for he wa
a skill clerk to order the raw materi necessari to the craft but
of thi occup he wa weari for he had the true spanish dislik and
contempt of trade in hi heart he held that war wa the onli occup
worthi of a man success war of cours against foe worth
plunder such as cort and pizarro had wage upon the poor indian
of new spain
adrian had read a chronicl of the adventur of these hero and
bitterli regret that he had come into the world too late to share
them the tale of heathen foemen slaughter by thousand and of the
incalcul golden treasur divid among their conqueror fire hi
imaginationespeci the treasur at time he would see them in hi
sleep basket full of gem heap of barbar gold and guerdon of
fair women slave all given by heaven to the true soldier whom it had
charg with the sacr work of christianis unbeliev by mean of
massacr and the rack
oh how deepli did he desir such wealth and the power which it would
bring with it he who wa depend upon other that look down upon
him as a lazi dreamer who had never a guilder to spare in hi pouch
who had noth inde but more debt than he care to rememb but it
never occur to him to set to work and grow rich like hi neighbour
by honest toil and commerc no that wa the task of slave like these
low holland fellow among whom hi lot wa cast
such were the main characterist of adrian surnam van goorl adrian
the superstiti but unspiritu dreamer the vain sybarit the dull
poet the chopper of fals logic the weak and passion selfseek
whose best and deepest crave such as hi love for hi mother and
anoth love that shall be told of were realli littl more than a
reflect of hi own pride and lust or at least could be subordin
to their fulfil not that he wa altogeth bad somewher in him
there wa a better part thu he wa capabl of good purpos and of
bitter remors under certain circumst even he might becom capabl
also of a certain spuriou spiritu exalt but if thi wa to
bloom in hi heart it must be in a prison strong enough to protect from
the blow of temptat adrian tempt would alwai be adrian overcom
he wa fashion by natur to be the tool of other or of hi own
desir
it mai be ask what part had hi mother in him where in hi weak
ignobl natur wa the trace of her pure and nobl charact it seem
hard to find wa thi want to be account for by the circumst
connect with hi birth in which she had been so unwil an agent
had she given him someth of her bodi but naught of that which wa
within her own controlh spirit who can sai thi at least is true
that from hi mother stock he had deriv noth beyond a certain
dutch dogged of purpos which when ad to hi other qualiti
might in some event make him formidablea thing to fear and flee from
adrian reach the witt poort and paus on thi side of the moat to
reflect about thing in gener like most young men of hi time and
blood as ha been said he had militari lean and wa convinc
that given the opportun he might becom on of the foremost
gener of hi ag now he wa engag in imagin himself besieg
leyden at the head of a great armi and in fanci dispos hi forc
after such fashion as would bring about it fall in the shortest
possibl time littl did he guess that within some few year thi veri
question wa to exercis the brain of valdez and other great spanish
captain
whilst he wa thu occupi suddenli a rude voic call
wake up spaniard and a hard objectit wa a green applestruck
him on hi flat cap nearli knock out the feather adrian leap
round with an oath to catch sight of two lad lout of about fifteen
project their tongu and jeer at him from behind the angl of
the gatehous now adrian wa not popular with the youth of leyden
and he knew it well so think it wisest to take no notic of thi
affront he wa about to continu on hi wai when on of the youth
made bold by impun step from hi corner and bow befor him till
the rag cap in hi hand touch the dust sai in a mock voic
han why do you disturb the nobl hidalgo cannot you see that the
nobl hidalgo is go for a walk in the countri to look for hi most
high father the honour duke of the golden fleec to whom he is
take a cockolli bird as a present
adrian heard and winc at the sting of the insult as a highbr hors
winc beneath the lash of a sudden rage boil in hi vein like a
fountain of fire and draw the dagger from hi girdl he rush at
the boi drag the hood hawk which had becom dislodg from hi
wrist flutter through the air after him at that moment inde he
would have been capabl of kill on or both of them if he could have
caught them but fortun for himself and them be prepar
for an onslaught thei vanish thi wai and that up the narrow lane
present he stop and still shake with wrath replac the hawk
on hi wrist and walk across the bridg
thei shall pai for it he mutter oh i will not forget i will not
forget
here it mai be explain that of the stori of hi birth adrian had heard
someth but not all he knew for instanc that hi father name
wa montalvo that the marriag with hi mother for some reason wa
declar to be illeg and that thi montalvo had left the netherland
under a cloud to find hi death so he had been told abroad more than
thi adrian did not know for certain sinc everybodi show a singular
retic in speak to him of the matter twice he had pluck up
courag to question hi mother on the subject and on each occas her
face had turn cold and hard as stone and she answer almost in the
same word
son i beg you to be silent when i am dead you will find all the stori
of your birth written down but if you ar wise you will not read
onc he had ask the same question of hi stepfath dirk van goorl
whereupon dirk look ill at eas and answer
take my advic lad and be content to know that you ar here and
aliv with friend to take care of you rememb that those who dig in
churchyard find bone
inde repli adrian haughtili at least i trust that there is
noth against my mother reput
at these word to hi surpris dirk suddenli turn pale as a sheet
and step toward him as though he were about to fly at hi throat
you dare to doubt your mother he began that angel out of heaven
then ceas and ad present go i beg your pardon i should have
rememb that you at least ar innoc and it is but natur that
the matter weigh upon your mind
so adrian went also that proverb about churchyard and bone made such
an impress on him that he did no more dig in other word he
ceas to ask question try to consol hi mind with the knowledg
that howev hi father might have behav to hi mother at least he
wa a man of ancient rank and ancient blood which blood wa hi todai
the rest would be forgotten although enough of it wa still rememb
to permit of hi be taunt by those street lout and when it wa
forgotten the blood that preciou blue blood of an hidalgo of spain
must still remain hi heritag
chapter xi
adrian rescu beauti in distress
all that long even adrian wander about the causewai which pierc
the meadowland and marsh ponder these thing and pictur
himself as have attain to the digniti of a grande of spain perhap
evenwho could tellto the proud rank of a knight of the golden fleec
entitl to stand cover in the presenc of hi sovereign more than
on snipe and other bird such as he had come to hawk rose at hi feet
but so preoccupi wa he that thei were out of flight befor he
could unhood hi falcon at length after he had pass the church of
weddinvliet and follow the left bank of the old vliet wa opposit
to the wood name boshhuyen after the halfruin castl that stood in
it he caught sight of a heron wing it homeward wai to the heronri
and cast off hi peregrin out of the hood she saw the quarri at onc
and dash toward it whereon the heron becom awar of the approach
of it enemi began to make plai rise high into the air in narrow
circl swiftli the falcon climb after it in wider ring till at
length she hover high abov and stoop but in vain with a quick
turn of the wing the heron avoid her and befor the falcon could
find her pitch again wa far on it path toward the wood
onc more the peregrin climb and stoop with a like result a
third time she soar upward in great circl and a third time rush
downward now strike the quarri full and bind to it adrian who
wa follow their flight as fast as he could run leap some of the
dyke in hi path and splash through other saw and paus to watch
the end for a moment hawk and quarri hung in the air two hundr feet
abov the tallest tree beneath them for at the instant of it take
the heron had begun to descend to the grove for refug a struggl
black dot against the glow of sunset then still bound togeth thei
rush downward headlong for their spread and flutter wing did not
serv to stai their fall and vanish among the treetop
now my good hawk will be kill in the boughsoh what a fool wa i
to fly so near the wood thought adrian to himself as again he start
forward
push on at hi best pace soon he wa wander about among the tree
as near to that spot where he had seen the bird fall as he could guess
it call to the falcon and search for her with hi ey but here
in the dens grove the fade light grew faint so that at length he
wa oblig to abandon the quest in despair and turn to find hi wai
to the leyden road when within twenti pace of it suddenli he came
upon hawk and heron the heron wa stone dead and the brave falcon so
injur that it seem hopeless to try to save her for as he fear
thei had crash through the bough of a tree in their fall adrian
look at her in dismai for he love thi bird which wa the best of
it kind in the citi have train her himself from a nestl inde
there had alwai been a curiou sympathi between himself and thi fierc
creatur of which he made a companion as anoth man might of a dog
even now he note with a sort of pride that brokenwing and shatter
though she wa her talon remain fix in the back of the quarri and
her beak through the neck
he stroke the falcon head whereon the bird recognis him loos
her grip of the heron and tri to flutter to her accustom perch upon
hi wrist onli to fall to the ground where she lai watch him with
her bright ey then becaus there wa no help for it although he
choke with grief at the deed adrian struck her on the head with hi
staff until she di
goodby friend he mutter at least that is the best wai to go
henc dy with a dead foe beneath and pick up the peregrin he
smooth her ruffl feather and place her tenderli in hi satchel
then it wa just as adrian rose to hi feet stand beneath the
shadow of the big oak upon which the bird had fallen that come from
the road which wa separ from him by a littl belt of undergrowth
he heard the sound of men voic growl and threaten and with
them a woman cry for help at ani other time he would have hesit
and reconnoitr or perhap have retreat at onc for he knew well
the danger of mix himself up in the quarrel of wayfar in those
rough dai but the loss of the hawk had exasper hi nerv make
ani excit or adventur welcom to him therefor without paus
to think adrian push forward through the brushwood to find himself in
the midst of a curiou scene
befor him ran the grassi road or woodland lane in the midst of it
sprawl on hi back for he had been pull from hi hors lai
a stout burgher whose pocket were be rifl by a heavybrow
footpad who from time to time doubtless to keep him quiet threaten
hi victim with a knife on the pillion of the burgher thickset
flemish hors which wa peacefulli crop at the grass sat a
middleag femal who seem to be stricken dumb with terror while a
few pace awai a second ruffian and a tall boni woman were engag in
drag a girl from the back of a mule
act on the impuls of the moment adrian shout
come on friend here ar the thiev whereon the robber woman took
to flight and the man wheel round as he turn snatch a nake
knife from hi girdl but befor he could lift it adrian heavi staff
crash down upon the point of hi shoulder caus him to drop the
dagger with a howl of pain again the staff rose and fell thi time
upon hi head stagger him and knock off hi cap so that the
light such as it wa shone upon hi villain fat face the fring of
sandycolour whisker run from throat to templ and the bald
head abov which adrian knew at onc for that of hagu simon or the
butcher fortun for him howev the butcher wa too surpris
or too much confus by the blow which he had receiv upon hi head
to recognis hi assail nor have lost hi knife and believ
doubtless that adrian wa onli the first of a troop of rescuer did he
seem inclin to continu the combat but call to hi companion
to follow him he began to run after the woman with a swift almost
incred in a man of hi build and weight turn present into the
brushwood where he and hi two fellow thiev vanish awai
adrian drop the point of hi stick and look round him for the
whole affair had been so sudden and the rout of the enemi so complet
that he wa tempt to believ he must be dream not eighti second
ago he wa hide the dead falcon in hi satchel and now behold he wa
a gallant knight who unarm except for a dagger which he forgot to
draw had conquer two sturdi knave and a femal accomplic bristl
with weapon rescu from their clutch beauti for doubtless the
maiden wa beauti and incident her wealthi rel just
then the ladi who had been drag from the mule to the ground where
she still lai struggl to her knee and look up therebi caus the
hood of her travel cloak to fall back from her head
thu it wa soften and illumin by the last pale glow of thi
summer even that adrian first saw the face of elsa brant the woman
upon whom in the name of love he wa destin to bring so much sorrow
the hero adrian overthrow of robber look at the kneel elsa
and knew that she wa love as under the circumst wa right and
fit and the rescu elsa gaze at the hero adrian admit to
herself that he wa handsom also that hi appear on the scene had
been opportun not to sai providenti
elsa brant the onli child of that hendrik brant the friend and cousin
of dirk van goorl who wa alreadi figur in thi histori wa
just nineteen her ey and her hair which curl were brown her
complexion wa pale suggest delicaci of constitut her mouth
small with a turn of humour about it and her chin rather larg and
firm she wa of middl height if anyth somewhat under it with an
exquisit round and grace figur and perfect hand lack the
stateli of a spanish beauti and the coars ful of outlin which
ha alwai been admir in the netherland elsa wa still without doubt
a beauti woman though how much of her charm wa ow to her bodili
attract and how much to her vivaci mien and to a certain stamp
of spiritu that wa set upon her face in repos and look out of
her clear larg ey when she wa thought it would not be easi to
determin at ani rate her charm were suffici to make a power
impress upon adrian who forget all about the marchio
dovanda inspir of sonnet becam enamour of her then and there
partli for her own sake and partli becaus it wa the right kind of
thing for a deliver to do
but it cannot be said howev deep her feel of gratitud that elsa
becam enamour of adrian undoubtedli as she had recognis he wa
handsom and she much admir the readi and forc with which he had
smitten that singularli loathsomelook individu who had drag her
from the mule but as it chanc stand where he did the shadow of
hi face lai on the grass besid her it wa a faint shadow for the
light fade still it wa there and it fascin her for seen thu
the fine featur becam sinist and cruel and their smile of courtesi
and admir wa transform into a most unpleas sneer a trivial
accid of light no doubt and foolish enough that elsa should notic
it under such circumst but notic it she did and what is more
so quickli ar the mind of women turn thi wai or that and so
illog do thei draw a right conclus from some pure freak of
chanc it rais her prejudic against him
oh senor said elsa clasp her hand how can i thank you
enough
thi speech wa short and not origin yet there were two thing about
it that adrian note with satisfact first that it wa utter in a
soft and most attract voic and secondli that the speaker suppos
him to be a spaniard of nobl birth
do not thank me at all graciou ladi he repli make hi lowest
bow to put to flight two robber rogu and a woman wa no great feat
although i had but thi staff for weapon he ad perhap with a view
to impress upon the maiden mind that her assail had been arm
while he the deliver wa not
ah she answer i daresai that a brave knight like you think
noth of fight sever men at onc but when that wretch with the
big hand and the flat face caught hold of me i nearli di of fright
at the best of time i am a dread coward andno i thank you
senor i can stand now and alon see here come the heer van
broekhoven under whose escort i am travel and look he is bleed
oh worthi friend ar you hurt
not much elsa gasp the heer for he wa still breathless with
fright and exhaust but that ruffianmai the hangman have himgav
me a dig in the shoulder with hi knife as he rose to run howev
he ad with satisfact he got noth from me for i am an old
travel and he never thought to look in my hat
i wonder why thei attack us said elsa
the heer van broekhoven rub hi head thoughtfulli to rob us i

awar that elsa face had undergon a complet chang the piquant
halfamus smile had pass out of it it wa strain and hard and the
ey were frighten

it would be a good thing if we might find a citi which we were quit
quit certain the spaniard could never takeal all of us and she
sigh heavili
if i were a spanish gener with a proper armi began adrian
pompous i would take leyden easili enough onli thi afternoon i

so elsa describ the appear of the man and of the blackei hag

that sound like the spy hagu simon him whom thei call the butcher
and hi wife black meg said dirk adrian you must have seen these

against a man that he ha been seen in the fellowship of on of the most
infam wretch in leyden a creatur whose hand ar stain red with
the blood of innoc men and women and who as your mother know onc

then the storm broke as elsa who had been watch the face of adrian
while he listen to foi artless but somewhat fatuou explan saw
that it must break
there is a conspiraci against me said adrian who had grown white
with rage ye everyth ha conspir against me todai first the

next it chanc that i rescu thi ladi and her companion from robber

my stepfath and foi choos to take that risk well and good but i
maintain that thei have no right to lai it consequ upon my mother

of an ey the danger wa done with for by some movement too quick to
follow martin had dealt hi assail such a blow upon the arm that the
poniard jar from hi grasp flew flash across the room to fall in
lysbeth lap anoth second and the iron grip had close upon adrian
shoulder and although he wa strong and struggl furious yet he
could not loos the hold of that singl hand
pleas ceas fight mynheer adrian for it is quit useless said
martin to hi captiv in a voic as calm as though noth unusu had

chapter xii
the summon
wretch man said lysbeth wring her hand and with a shudder
shake the dagger from her lap as though it had been a serpent you
have kill my son
your pardon mistress repli martin placidli but that is not so
the master order me to remov the heer adrian whereon the heer adrian
veri natur tri to stab me but i have been accustom to such
thing in my youth and he look deprecatingli toward the pastor
arentz struck the heer adrian upon the bone of hi elbow caus the
knife to jump from hi hand for had i not done so i should have been
dead and unabl to execut the command of my master then i took the
heer adrian by the shoulder gentli as i might and walk awai with
him whereupon he di of rage for which i am veri sorri but not to
blame
you ar right man said lysbeth it is you who ar to blame dirk
ye you have murder my son oh never mind what he said hi temper
wa alwai fierc and who pai ani heed to the talk of a man in a mad
passion
why did you let your brother be thu treat cousin foi broke in
elsa quiver with indign it wa cowardli of you to stand still
and see that great red creatur crush the life out of him when you know
well that it wa becaus of your taunt that he lost hi temper and said
thing that he did not mean as i do myself sometim no i will
never speak to you againand onli thi afternoon he save me from the
robber and she burst into weep
peac peac thi is no time for angri word said the pastor arentz
push hi wai through the group of bewild men and overwrought
women he can scarc be dead let me look at him i am someth of
a doctor and he knelt by the senseless and bleed adrian to examin
him
take comfort vrouw van goorl he said present your son is not
dead for hi heart beat nor ha hi friend martin injur him in ani
wai by the exercis of hi strength but i think that in hi furi he ha
burst a bloodvessel for he bleed fast my counsel is that he should
be put to bed and hi head cool with cold water till the surgeon can
be fetch to treat him lift him in your arm martin
so martin carri adrian not to the street but to hi bed while foi
glad of an excus to escap the undeserv reproach of elsa and the
pain sight of hi mother grief went to seek the physician in due
cours he return with him and to the great relief of all of them
the learn man announc that notwithstand the blood which he had
lost he did not think that adrian would die though at the best he
must keep hi bed for some week have skil nurs and be humour
in all thing
while hi wife lysbeth and elsa were attend to adrian dirk and hi
son foi for the pastor arentz had gone sat upstair talk in the
sittingroom that same balconi chamber in which onc dirk had been
refus while montalvo hid behind the curtain dirk wa much disturb
for when hi wrath had pass he wa a tenderheart man and hi
stepson plight distress him greatli now he wa justifi himself
to foi or rather to hi own conscienc
a man who could speak so of hi own mother wa not fit to stop in the
same hous with her he said moreov you heard hi word about the
pastor i tell you son i am afraid of thi adrian
unless that bleed from hi mouth stop soon you will not have caus
to fear him much longer repli foi sadli but if you want my opinion
about the busi father why here it isi think that you have made
too much of a small matter adrian isadrian he is not on of us and
he should not be judg as though he were you cannot imagin me fly
into a furi becaus the women forgot to set my place at tabl or try
to stab martin and burst a blood vessel becaus you told him to lead
me out of the room no i should know better for what is the us of ani
ordinari man attempt to struggl against martin he might as well try
to argu with the inquisit but then i am i and adrian is adrian
but the word he us son rememb the word
ye and if i had spoken them thei would have meant a great deal but
in adrian mouth i think no more of them than if thei came from some
angri woman why he is alwai sulk or take offenc or fly
into rage over someth or other and when he is like that it all
meansjust noth except that he want to us fine talk and show off
and plai the don over us he did not realli mean to lie to me when he
said that i had not seen him talk to black meg he onli meant to
contradict or perhap to hide someth up as a matter of fact if you
want to know the truth i believ that the old witch took note for him
to some young ladi and that hagu simon suppli him with rat for hi
hawk
ye foi that mai be so but how about hi talk of the pastor it
make me suspici son you know the time we live in and if he
should go that wayrememb it is in hi bloodth live of everi on
of us ar in hi hand the father tri to burn me onc and i do not
wish the child to finish the work
then when thei come out of hi hand you ar at liberti to cut off
mine answer foi hotli i have been brought up with adrian and i
know what he is he is vain and pompou and everi time he look at
you and me he thank god that he wa not made like that also he ha
fail and vice and he is lazi be too fine a gentleman to work
like a common flemish burgher and all the rest of it but father he
ha a good heart and if ani man outsid thi hous were to tell me that
adrian is capabl of plai the traitor and bring hi own famili to
the scaffold well i would make him swallow hi word or try to that
is all as regard what he said about my mother first marriageand
foi hung hi headof cours it is a subject on which i have no right
to talk but father speak as on man to anotherh is sadli
place and innoc whatev other mai have been and i dont wonder
that he feel sore about the stori
as he spoke the door open and lysbeth enter
how goe it with adrian wife dirk ask hastili

same rule said lysbeth almost repeat foi word

as she finish whisper foi heard a warn stamp from martin

minut later ani for whom the sight had interest might have observ a
yellowhair young gallant and a blackhair young woman walk down
the broad street with their arm affection dispos around each
other middl follow them wa a huge and lumber serv man
with a beard like fire who in a loyal effort to imit the action
of hi master had hook a great limb about the neck of red bow stout
littl attend and held her thu in a chanceri which if flatter
must have been uncomfort as martin explain to the poor woman
afterward it wa no fault of hi sinc in order to reach her waist he
must have carri her under hi arm
foi and hi companion chat merrili enough if in a somewhat jerki
fashion but martin attempt no talk onli as he proceed he wa heard
to mutter between hi teeth lucki the pastor arentz cant see us now
he would never understand he is so onesid so at least foi declar

unobserv as he thought till he heard a mock voic call after
them goodnight red bow hope you will have a fine supper with your
leyden shopboi
quick whisper red bow and thei turn anoth corner then
anoth and anoth now thei walk down narrow street illkept and
unsavouri with sharp pitch roof gabl and overhang so much
that here and there thei seem almost to meet leav but a ribbon
of starspeck sky wind abov their head evid it wa a low
quarter of the town and a malodour quarter for the canal span
by picturesqu and higharch bridg were everywher and at thi
summer season the water in them wa low rotten and almost stirless
at length red bow halt and knock upon a small recess door which
instantli wa open by a man who bore no light
come in he whisper and all four of them pass into a darksom
passag quick quick said the man i hear footstep
foi heard them also echo down the empti street and as the door
close it seem to him that thei stop in the deep shadow of the
hous then hold each other by the hand thei crept along black
passag and down stair till at length thei saw light shine through
the crevic of an illfit door it open mysteri at their
approach and when thei had all enter shut behind them
foi utter a sigh of relief for he wa weari of thi long flight
and look round him to discov that thei were in a larg windowless
cellar well furnish after a fashion by oak bench and a tabl set
out with cold meat and flagon of wine at the foot of thi tabl stood
a middleag man prematur grei and with a face worn as though by
constant care
welcom foi van goorl said the man in a gentl voic mani year

hi fist in a kind of frenzi and address the two women who had
plai the part of red bow and her servant who among you is the
traitor can it be that you whom my bounti ha fed betrai me nai
girl do not weep i know that it is not so and yet in thi citi the

well if onli i can save my fortun from those wolv what do i care
then thei mai take my carcas and tear it at least my daughter is
safefor a while and now i have but on desir left on earthto rob
them of my wealth also
then he turn to the girl deck out in the gai cloth who now that
the chase wa over sat upon a bench with her face hidden in her hand
and said tell me your stori gretchen whereon she lift her head
and repeat all that happen
thei press us hard mutter brant but friend we will beat them

man who had led them to the vault listen without the door
when thei had finish brant bade the two women red bow and the other
leav the cellar and send in the sentri replac him as guard he
enter a hardfac grizzl man and take a seat at the tabl
began to fill himself with food and wine

call the swallow small but the swiftest on thi coast and handi
in a sea her cargo is salt and beneath it eight keg of powder and
between the powder and the salt certain barrel which barrel ar
fill with treasur now present if you have the heart for itand
if you have not sai so and i will go myselfthi man here han
under cover of the dark will row you down to the boat swallow
then you must board her and at the first break of dawn hoist her sail
and stand out to sea and awai with her where the wind drive ty
the skiff behind like enough you will find foe wait for you at
the mouth of the canal or elsewher then i can give you onli on

gone think lad how great is thi wealth and you will understand why
the crow ar hungri it is talk of throughout the netherland it ha
been report to the king in spain and i learn that order have come
from him concern it seizur but there is anoth band who would get
hold of it first ramiro and hi crew and that is why i have been left
safe so long becaus the thiev strive on against the other and watch
each other most of all howev thei watch me and everyth that is
mine for though thei do not believ that i should send the treasur
awai and stai behind yet thei ar not sure
you think that thei will pursu us then ask foi

brant shook hi head i have thought of that he said as i have
thought of everyth but it cannot now be done also there is no time
to make fresh plan
why ask foi
becaus dai and night men ar watch the boat which ar known to
belong to me although thei ar regist in other name and onli thi
even an order wa sign that thei must be search within an hour
of dawn my inform is good as it should be sinc i pai for it

try to hide the treasur and if we cant we will try to blow her up
as you direct and try to escap ourselv or and he shrug hi

thousand of our folk will live to bless the gold of hendrik brant and
that is why i work so hard to save it from the spaniard also that is
why i ask you to risk your live tonight not for the wealth sake
for wealth is dross but for what the wealth will bui in dai to come

some step and climb into a boat which lai there readi next came
martin and last of all foi as he set foot upon the first step a
figur shot out of the gloom toward him a knife gleam in the air and
a blow took him between the shoulder that sent him stumbl headlong
for he wa balanc upon the edg of the step
but martin had heard and seen he swung round and struck out with the
sword silenc the assassin wa far from him still the tip of the long
steel reach the outstretch murder hand and from it fell a broken

of steel then han whistl like a plover and drop their sword
thei came to him and fell into talk present han left them and
return to foi and martin said
listen we must lie here a while for the wind is against us and it
would be too danger for us to try to row or pole so big a boat down
to the sea and across the bar in the dark for most like we should
set her fast upon a shoal befor dawn it will turn and if i read the
sky aright blow hard off land
what have the bargemen to sai ask foi

and sail as the light would allow thei sat in the cabin wait till
the wind should chang while the two watch men unmoor the vessel
and made her sail readi for hoist an hour pass and still the
breez blew from the sea but in uncertain chop gust then it fell
altogeth
prai god it come soon said martin for the owner of that finger
in your pocket will have laid the hound on to our slot long ago and
look the east grow red
the silent hardfac han leant forward and stare up the darkl

mast present it wa set and after it the jib then assist by
the two watchmen thrust from anoth of the boat thei push the
swallow from her place in the line out into midstream but all thi

neighbour mound

the littl vessel began to gather wai

for the dawn wa break he caught sight of a long boat with her
canva spread which wa sweep round the bend of the stream toward

the stretch of open water which ran down to the sea by now the light
wa strong and in it thei saw that the signal fire had not been lit in
vain at the mouth of the cut just where the bar began the channel
wa narrow in with earth to a width of not more than fifti pace and
on on bank of it stood a foot arm with culverin out of the littl

of the deck we ar safe now mate hold fast i cant go past that
boat so i am go through her we mai sink on the other side though i
am sure that the fire will reach the powder first in that case you can
swim for it if you like but i shall go with the swallow
i will think about it when the time come oh that curs astrolog
growl martin look back at the pursu ship which wa not more
than seven or eight hundr yard awai
meanwhil the offic in command of the boat who wa arm with a
musket wa shout to them to pull down their sail and surrend
inde not until thei were within fifti yard of him did he seem to
understand their desper purpos then some on in the boat call
out the devil ar go to sink us and there wa a rush to bow and
stern to get up the anchor onli the offic stood firm scream at
them like a madman it wa too late a strong gust of wind caught the
swallow caus her to heel over and sweep down on the boat like a
swoop falcon
han stood and shift the tiller ever so littl calcul all thing
with hi ey foi watch the boat toward which thei sprang like a
thing aliv and martin ly at hi side watch the burn match
suddenli the spanish offic when their prow wa not more than twenti
pace from him ceas to shout and lift hi piec fire martin
look upward with hi left ey thought that he saw han flinch but
the pilot made no sound onli he did someth to the tiller put
all hi strength on to it and it seem to the pair of them as though
the swallow wa for an instant check in her flightcertainli her
prow appear to lift itself from the water suddenli there wa a sound
of someth snappinga sound that could be heard even through the yell
of terror from the soldier in the boat it wa the bowsprit which had
gone leav the jib fly loos like a great pennon
then came the crash foi shut hi ey for a moment hang on with
both hand till the scrape and the trembl were done with now he
open again and the first thing he saw wa the bodi of the spanish
offic hang from the jag stump of the bowsprit he look behind
the boat had vanish but in the water were to be seen the head of
three or four men swim as for themselv thei seem to be clear
and unhurt except for the loss of their bowsprit inde the littl
vessel wa ride over the sea on the bar like ani swan han glanc
at the slowmatch which wa smoulder awai peril near to the
deck whereon martin stamp upon it sai
if we sink now it will be in deep water so there is no need to fly up
befor we go down
go and see if she leak said han
thei went and search the forehold but could not find that the
swallow had taken ani harm worth note inde her massiv oaken
prow with the weight of the galedriven ship behind it had crash
through the frail side of the open spanish boat like a knife through an
egg
that wa good steer said foi to han when thei return and
noth seem to be amiss
han nod i hit him neatli he mutter look he gone as he
spoke the swallow gave a sharp pitch and the corps of the spaniard
fell with a heavi splash into the sea

someth in the tone of the man voic caus foi to scrutinis hi

we shall be talk it over togeth no dont troubl it is through
the bodi and mortal well i expect noth less so i cant complain
now listen while my strength hold can you lai a cours for harwich
in england
martin and foi shook their head like most holland thei were good
sailormen but thei onli knew their own coast
then you had best not try it said han for there is a gale brew
and you will be driven on the goodwin sand or somewher down that
shore and drown and the treasur lost run up to the haarlem mere
comrad you can hug the land with thi small boat while that big
devil after you and he nod toward the pursu vessel which by
now wa cross the bar must stand further out beyond the shoal
then slip up through the small gutth ruin farmstead mark itand
so into the mere you know mother martha the mad woman who is nicknam
the mare she will be watch at the mouth of it she alwai is
moreov i caus her to be warn that we might pass her wai and if
you hoist the white flag with a red crossit li in the lockeror
after nightfal hang out four lamp upon your starboard side she will
come aboard to pilot you for she know thi boat well to her also you
can tell your busi without fear for she will help you and be as
secret as the dead then buri the treasur or sink it or blow it up
or do what you can but in the name of god to whom i go i charg you
do not let it fall into the hand of ramiro and hi spanish rat who ar
at your heel
as han spoke he sank down upon the deck foi ran to support him but he
push him asid with a feebl hand let me be he whisper i wish
to prai i have set you a cours follow it to the end
then martin took the tiller while foi watch han in ten minut he
wa dead
now thei were run northward with a fierc wind abeam of them and
the larger spanish ship behind but stand further out to sea to avoid
the bank half an hour later the wind which wa gather to a gale
shift sever point to the north so that thei must beat up against
it under reef canva still thei held on without accid foi
attend to the sail and martin steer the swallow wa a good sea
boat and if their progress wa slow so wa that of their pursuer which
dog them continu sometim a mile awai and sometim less at
length toward even thei caught sight of a ruin hous that mark
the channel of the littl gut on of the outlet of the haarlem mere
the sea run high upon the bar and it is ebb tide said foi
even so we must try it master answer martin perhap she will
scrape through and he put the swallow about and ran for the mouth of
the gut
here the wave were mountain and much water came aboard moreov
three time thei bump upon the bar till at length to their joi thei
found themselv in the calm stream of the gut and by shift the
sail were abl to draw it up though veri slowli
at least we have got a start of them said foi for thei can never
get across until the tide rise
we shall need it all answer martin so now hoist the white flag
and let us eat while we mai
while thei at the sun sank and the wind blew so that scarc could
thei make a knot an hour shift the sail as thei might then as there
wa no sign of mother martha or ani other pilot thei hung out the four
lamp upon the starboard side and with a flap sail drift on
gradual till at length thei reach the mouth of the great mere an
infinit wast of watersdeep in some place shallow in other
and spot everywher with islet now the wind turn against them
altogeth and the dark close in thei were forc to drop
anchor fear lest otherwis thei should go ashor on comfort thei
had howev as yet noth could be seen of their pursuer
then for the first time their spirit fail them a littl and thei
stood togeth near the stern wonder what thei should do it wa
while thei rest thu that suddenli a figur appear befor them
as though it had risen from the deck of the ship no sound of oar or
footstep had reach their ear yet there outlin against the dim
sky wa the figur
i think that friend han ha come to life again said martin with a
slight quaver in hi voic for martin wa terribl afraid of ghost
and i think that a spaniard ha found us said foi draw hi knife
then a hoars voic spoke sai who ar you that signal for a pilot
on my water
the question iswho ar you answer foi and be so good as to tell
us quickli
i am the pilot said the voic and thi boat by the rig of her and
her signal should be the swallow of the hagu but why must i crawl
aboard of her across the corps of a dead man
come into the cabin pilot and we will tell you said foi
veri well mynheer so foi led the wai to the cabin but martin
stop behind a while
we have found our guid so what is the us of the lamp he said to
himself as he extinguish them all except on which he brought with
him into the cabin foi wa wait for him by the door and thei enter
the place togeth at the end of it the light of the lamp show them
a strang figur clad in skin so shapeless and sacklik that it wa
imposs to sai whether the form beneath were male or femal the
figur wa barehead and about the brow lock of grizzl hair hung
in tuft the face in which were set a pair of wander grei ey
wa deep cut tan brown by exposur scar and veri ugli with
wither lip and project teeth

that you or your parent either should be known to traffic with such
as i now what is your busi with me for the signal show that you
have busi and why doe the corps of hendrik brant fosterbroth
lie there in the stern
becaus to be plain we have hendrik brant treasur on board
mother and for the rest look yonder and he point to what hi ey
had just caught sight of two or three mile awai a faint light too low
and too red for a star that could onli come from a lantern hung at the
masthead of a ship
martha nod spaniard after you pole through the gut against the
wind come on there is no time to lose bring your boat round and we
will tow the swallow to where she will lie safe tonight
five minut later thei were all three of them row the oar boat in
which thei had escap from the hagu toward some unknown point in the
dark slowli drag after them the littl ship swallow as thei
went foi told martha all the stori of their mission and escap
i have heard of thi treasur befor she said all the netherland
ha heard of brant hoard also dead han there let me know that
perhap it might come thi wai for in such matter he thought that i
could be trust and she smile grimli and now what would you do
fulfil our order said foi hide it if we can if not destroi it
better the first than the last interrupt martin hide the
treasur sai i and destroi the spaniard if mother martha here can
think of a plan
we might sink the ship suggest foi
and leav her mast for a beacon ad martin sarcast
or put the stuff into the boat and sink that
and never find it again in thi great sea object martin
all thi while martha steer the boat as calmli as though it were
daylight thei had left the open water and were pass slowli in and
out among islet yet she never seem to be doubt or to hesit at
length thei felt the swallow behind them take the mud gentli whereon
martha led the wai aboard of her and threw out the anchor sai that
here wa her berth for the night
now she said bring up thi gold and lai it in the boat for if you
would save it there is much to do befor dawn
so foi and martin went down while martha hang over the hatchwai
held the light lamp abov them sinc thei dare not take it near the
powder move the bag of salt soon thei came to the five barrel of
treasur mark b and strong though thei were it wa no easi task for
the pair of them by the help of a pullei to sling them over the ship
side into the boat at last it wa done and the place of the barrel
have been fill with salt bag thei took two iron spade which
were provid for such a task as thi and start martha steer as
befor for an hour or more thei row in and out among endless island
at the dim shore of which martha stare as thei pass till at length
she motion to them to ship their oar and thei touch ground
leap from the boat she made it fast and vanish among the reed
to reconnoitr present she return again sai that thi wa the
place then began the heavi labour of roll the cask of treasur for
thirti yard or more along otter path that pierc the dens growth of
reed
now have first carefulli cut out reed sod in a place chosen by
martha foi and martin set to their task of dig a great hole by the
light of the star hard inde thei toil at it yet had it not been
for the soft of the marshi soil thei could not have got done while
the night last for the grave that would contain those barrel must
be both wide and deep after three feet of earth had been remov thei
came to the level of the lake and for the rest of the time work in
water throw up shovel of mud still at last it wa done and
the five barrel stand side by side in the water were cover up with
soil and roughli plant over with the reed turf
let us be go said martha there is no time to lose so thei
straighten their back and wipe the sweat from their brow
there is earth ly about which mai tell it stori said martin
ye she repli if ani see it within the next ten dai after which
in thi damp place the moss will have hidden it
well we have done our best said foi as he wash hi mudstain
boot in the water and now the stuff must take it chanc
then onc more thei enter the boat and row awai somewhat wearili
martha steer them
on thei went and on till foi tire out nearli fell asleep at hi oar
suddenli martha tap him on the shoulder he look up and there not
two hundr yard awai it taper mast show dimli against the sky
wa the vessel that had pursu them from the hagu a singl lantern
burn on it stern martha look and grunt then she leant forward
and whisper to them imperi
it is mad gasp martin
do as i bid you she hiss and thei let the boat drift with the
wind till it came to a littl island within thirti yard of the anchor
vessel an island with a willow tree grow upon it shore hold to
the twig of the tree she mutter and wait till i come again not
know what els to do thei obei
then martha rose and thei saw that she had slip off her garment of
skin and stood befor them a gaunt white figur arm with a gleam
knife next she put the knife to her mouth and nip it between her
teeth slid into the water silent as a dive bird a minut pass
not more and thei saw that someth wa climb up the cabl of the
ship
what is she go to do whisper foi
god in heaven know answer martin but if she doe not come back
goodby to heer brant treasur for she alon can find it again
thei wait hold their breath till present a curiou choke
sound float to them and the lantern on the ship vanish two minut
later a hand with a knife in it appear over the gunwal of the boat
follow by a grei head martin put out hi great arm and lift and
lo the white form slid down between them like a big salmon turn out
of a net
put about and row it gasp and thei obei while the mare cloth
herself again in her skin garment
what have you done ask foi
someth she repli with a fierc chuckl i have stab the
watchmanh thought i wa a ghost and wa too frighten to call out
i have cut the cabl and i think that i have fire the ship ah look
but rowrow round the corner of the island
thei gave wai and as thei turn the bank of reed glanc behind them
to see a tall tongu of fire shoot up the cordag of the ship and to
hear a babel of frighten and angri voic
ten minut later thei were on board the swallow and from her deck
watch the fierc flare of the burn spanish vessel nearli a mile
awai here thei at and drank for thei need food badli
what shall we do now ask foi when thei had finish
noth at present answer martha but give me pen and paper
thei found them and have shroud the littl window of the cabin
she sat at the tabl and veri slowli but with much skill drew a plan or
rather a pictur of thi portion of the haarlem mere in that plan were
mark mani island accord to their natur shape twenti of them
perhap and upon on of these she set a cross
take it and hide it said martha when it wa finish so that if i
die you mai know where to dig for brant gold with thi in your hand
you cannot fail to find it for i draw well rememb that it li
thirti pace due south of the onli spot where it is easi to land upon
that island
what shall i do with thi pictur which is worth so much said foi
helplessli for in truth i fear to keep the thing
give it to me master said martin the secret of the treasur mai
as well lie with the legaci that is charg on it then onc more he
unscrew the handl of the sword silenc and have fold up the
paper and wrap it round with a piec of linen he thrust it awai into
the hollow hilt
now that sword is worth more than some peopl might think martin said
as he restor it to the scabbard but i hope that those who come to
seek it secret mai have to travel up it blade well when shall we be
move
listen said martha would you two men dare a great deed upon those
spaniard their ship is burnt but there ar a score or over of them
and thei have two larg boat now at the dawn thei will see the mast
of thi vessel and attack it in the boat think to find the treasur
well if as thei win aboard we can manag to fire the match
there mai be fewer spaniard left to plagu us suggest foi
and believ it to be blown up no on will troubl about that monei
further ad martin oh the plan is good but danger come let
us talk it over
the dawn broke in a flood of yellow light on the surfac of the haarlem
mere present from the direct of the spanish vessel which wa
still burn sullenli came a sound of beat oar now the three
watcher in the swallow saw two boatload of arm men on of them
with a small sail set swoop down toward them when thei were within
a hundr yard martha mutter it is time and foi ran hither and
thither with a candl fire the slowmatch also to make sure he cast
the candl among a few hand of oilsoak shred of canva that lai
readi at the bottom of the hatchwai then with the other without the
spaniard be abl to see them he slip over the side of the littl
vessel into the shallow water that wa cloth with tall reed and
wade through it to the island
onc on firm land thei ran a hundr yard or so till thei reach a
clump of swamp willow and took shelter behind them inde foi did
more for he climb the trunk of on of the willow high enough to see
over the reed to the ship swallow and the lake beyond by thi time
the spaniard were alongsid the swallow for he could hear their
captain hail him who leant over the taffrail and command all on
board to surrend under pain of be put to death but from the man in
the stern came no answer which wa scarc strang see that it wa
the dead pilot han to whom thei talk in the misti dawn whose bodi
martin had lash thu to deceiv them so thei fire at the pilot who
took no notic and then began to clamber on board the ship present
all the men were out of the first boatthat with the sail set on
itexcept two the steersman and the captain whom from hi dress and
demeanour foi took to be the oneei spaniard ramiro although of
thi he wa too far off to make sure it wa certain howev that thi
man did not mean to board the swallow for of a sudden he put hi boat
about and the wind catch the sail soon drew him clear of her
that fellow is cun said foi to martin and martha below and i
wa a fool to light the tar canva for he ha seen the smoke draw
up the hatchwai
and have had enough fire for on night think that he will leav hi
mate to quench it ad martin
the second boat is come alongsid went on foi and sure the mine
should spring
scarc time yet answer martin the match were set for six
minut
then follow a silenc in which the three of them watch and listen
with beat heart in it thei heard a voic call out that the
steersman wa dead and the answer voic of the offic in the boat
whom foi had been right in suppos to be ramiro warn them to
bewar of treacheri now suddenli aros a shout of a mine a mine for
thei had found on of the light fuse
thei ar run for their boat said foi and the captain is sail
farther off heaven how thei scream
as the word pass hi lip a tongu of flame shot to the veri ski
the island seem to rock a fierc rush of air struck foi and shook him
from the tree then came a dread thunder sound and lo the sky
wa darken with fragment of wreck limb of men a grei cloud of
salt and torn shred of sail and cargo which fell here there and
everywher about and beyond them
in five second it wa over and the three of them shaken but unhurt
were cling to each other on the ground then as the dark pall of
smoke drift southward foi scrambl up hi tree again but now there
wa littl to be seen for the swallow had vanish utterli and for
mani yard round where she lai the wreckagestrewn water wa black as
ink with the stir mud the spaniard had gone also noth of them
wa left save the two men and the boat which rode unhurt at a distanc
foi stare at them the steersman wa seat and wring hi hand
while the captain on whose armour the rai of the rise sun now shone
brightli held to the mast like on stun and gaze at the place
where a minut befor had been a ship and a troop of live men
present he seem to recov himself for he issu an order whereon
the boat head went about and she began to glide awai
now we had best try to catch him said martha who by stand up
could see thi also
nai let him be answer foi we have sent enough men to their
account and he shudder
as you will master grumbl martin but i tell you it is not
wise that man is too clever to be allow to live els he would have
accompani the other on board and perish with them
oh i am sick repli foi the wind from that powder ha shaken me
settl it as you will with mother martha and leav me in peac
so martin turn to speak with martha but she wa not there chuckl
to herself in the mad of her hate and the glori of thi great
reveng she had slip awai knife in hand to discov whether
perchanc ani of the powderblast spaniard still live fortun
for them thei did not the shock had kill them all even those who at
the first alarm had thrown themselv into the water at length
martin found her clap her hand and croon abov a dead bodi so
shatter that no on could tell to what manner of man it had belong
and led her awai
but although she wa keen enough for the chase by now it wa too
late for travel befor the strong wind ramiro and hi boat had
vanish
chapter xv
senor ramiro
if foi van goorl by some magic could have seen what wa pass in
the mind of that fugit in the boat as he sail swiftli awai from the
scene of death and ruin bitterli inde would he have curs hi folli
and inexperi which led him to disregard the advic of red martin
let us look at thi man as he goe gnaw hi hand in rage and
disappoint there is someth familiar about hi face and bear
still gallant enough in a fashion yet the most observ would find
it difficult to recognis in the senor ramiro the handsom and courtli
count juan de montalvo of over twenti year befor a long spell of the
gallei chang the hardiest man and by ill luck montalvo or ramiro
to call him by hi new name had been forc to serv nearli hi full
time he would have escap earlier inde had he not been foolish
enough to join in a mutini which wa discov and suppress it wa
in the cours of thi savag struggl for freedom that he lost hi ey
knock out with a belai pin by an offic whom he had just stab
the innoc offic di and the rascal ramiro di but without hi
good look
to a person of gentl birth howev great a scoundrel he might be the
gallei which repres penal servitud in the sixteenth centuri
were a veri rough school inde for the most part the man who went into
them blameless becam bad and the man who went into them bad becam
wors for as the proverb sai those who have dwelt in hell alwai
smell of brimston who can imagin the aw of itth chain
the arduou and continu labour the whip of the quartermast the
compani of thiev and outcast ruffian all dread in it squalid
same
well hi strength and constitut coupl with a sort of grim
philosophi brought him through and at length ramiro found himself
a free man middleag inde but intellig and still strong the
world onc more befor him yet what a world hi wife believ him
dead or perhap wish to believ it had remarri and gone with her
husband to new spain take hi children with her and hi friend
such of them as live turn their back upon him but although he had
been an unlucki man for with him wicked had not prosper he still
had resourc and courag
the count montalvo wa a penniless outlaw a byword and a scorn and so
the count montalvodi and wa buri publicli in the church of hi
nativ villag strang enough howev about the same time the
senor ramiro appear in anoth part of spain where with success he
practis as a notari and man of affair some year went by thu till
at length have realis a consider sum of monei by the help of
an ingeni fraud of which the detail ar superflu an inspir
took him and he sail for the netherland
in those dread dai in order to further the end of religi
persecut and of legalis theft inform were reward with a
portion of the good of heret ramiro ideaa great on in it
waywa to organis thi inform busi and by interest a
number of confeder who practic were sharehold in the ventur
to sweep into hi net more fortun or share of fortun than a
singl individu howev industri could hope to secur as he had
expect soon he found plenti of worthi companion and the compani wa
float for a while with the help of local agenc and spi such as
black meg and the butcher with whom forget past injuri he had
secretli renew hi acquaint it did veri well the dividend be
larg and regular in such time handsom sum were realis without
risk out of the properti of unfortun who were brought to the
stake and still more wa secur by a splendid system of blackmail
extract from those who wish to avoid execut and who when thei
had been suck dry could either be burnt or let go as might prove
most conveni
also there were other method of make moneybi an intellig method
of robberi by contract to collect fine and tax and so forth thu
thing went well and at length after mani year of suffer and
poverti the senor ramiro that experienc man of affair began
to grow rich until inde driven forward by a natur but unwis
ambit a fault inher to dare mind he enter upon a danger
path
the wealth of hendrik brant the goldsmith wa a matter of common
report and gloriou would be the fortun of him who could secur it
revers thi ramiro wish to win inde there wa no ostens
reason why he should not do so sinc brant wa undoubtedli a heret
and therefor legitim game for ani honour servant of the church
and king yet there were lion in the path two larg and formid
lion or rather a lion and the ghost of a lion for on wa materi
and the other spiritu the materi lion wa that the govern
or in other word hi august kingship philip desir the goldsmith
thousand for himself and wa therefor like to be irrit by an
interlop the spiritu lion wa that brant wa connect with lysbeth
van goorl onc known as lysbeth de montalvo a ladi who had brought
her reput husband no luck often and often dure dreari hour of
reflect beneath tropic sun for which the profess of galleyslav
gave great leisur the senor ramiro rememb that veri energet
curs which hi new affianc wife had bestow upon him a curs in
which she prai that through her he might live in heavi labour that
through her and her he might be haunt by fear and misfortun and
at the last die in miseri look back upon the past it would certainli
seem that there had been virtu in thi curs for alreadi through
lysbeth and hi deal with her he had suffer the last degrad
and the toil which could not be call light of nearli fourteen year
of daili occup in the gallei
well he wa clear of them and thenceforward the curs have
exhaust itself for the time be he had prosperedat ani rate to a
moder extent but if onc more he began to interfer with lysbeth van
goorl and her rel might it not reassert it power that wa on
question wa it worth while to take hi risk on the chanc of secur
brant fortun that wa anoth brant it wa true wa onli a cousin
of lysbeth husband but when onc you meddl with a member of the
famili it wa imposs to know how soon other member would becom
mix up in the affair
the end mai be guess the treasur wa at hand and enorm wherea
the wrath of a heavenli or an earthli king wa problemat and far
awai so greed outstrip caution and superstiti fear won the
race and ramiro threw himself into the adventur with a resourc and
energi which in their wai were splendid
now as alwai he wa a man who hate violenc for it own sake it wa
no wish of hi that the worthi heer brant should be unnecessarili burnt
or tortur therefor through hi intermediari as brant had narrat
in hi letter he approach him with a propos which under the
circumst wa liber enoughthat brant should hand over
twothird of hi fortun to him and hi confeder on condit
that he wa assist to escap with the remain third to hi disgust
howev thi obstin dutchman refus to bui hi safeti at the price
of a singl stiver inde he answer with rude energi that now as
alwai he wa in the hand of god and if it pleas god that hi life
should be sacrif and hi great wealth divid amongst thiev well
it must be so but he at least would be no parti to the arrang
the detail of the plot and counterplot the attack of the ramiro
compani the defenc of brant the internecin struggl between the
member of the compani and the agent of the govern if set out
at length would fill a consider book of these we alreadi know
someth and the rest mai be divin
in the cours of the affair ramiro had made but on mistak and that
sprang from what he wa wont to consid the weak of hi natur
needless to sai it wa that he had wink at the escap of brant
daughter elsa it mai have been superstit that prompt him or it
mai have been piti or perhap it wa a certain oath of merci which he
had taken in an hour of need at ani rate he wa content that the girl
should not share the doom which overshadow her father he did not
think it at all like that she would take with her ani document of
import and the treasur of cours she could not take still to
provid against accid he arrang for her to be search upon the
road
as we know thi search wa a failur and when on the morrow black meg
arriv to make report and to warn him that dirk van goorl son and hi
great servingman whose strength wa known throughout the netherland
were on their road to the hagu he wa sure that after all the girl had
carri with her some paper or messag
by thi time the whereabout of brant treasur had been practic
solv it wa believ to lie in the string of vessel although it wa
not known that on of these wa laden with powder as well as gold the
plan of the govern agent wa to search the vessel as thei pass
out to sea and seiz the treasur as contraband which would save much
legal troubl sinc under the law or the edict wealth might not be
ship abroad by heret the plan of ramiro and hi friend wa
to facilit the escap of the treasur to the open sea where thei
propos to swoop down upon it and convei it to more peac shore
when foi and hi parti start down the canal in the boat ramiro knew
that hi opportun had come and at onc unmoor the big ship and
follow the attempt stab of foi wa not done by hi order as
he wish the parti to go unmolest and to be kept in sight that wa a
piec of privat malic on the part of black meg for it wa she who wa
dress as a man on variou occas in leyden foi had made remark
upon meg charact which she resent and about her person
appear which she resent much more and thi wa an attempt to pai
off old score that in the issu cost her a finger a good knife and a
gold ring which had associ connect with her youth
at first everyth had gone well by on of the most dare and
masterli manoeuvr that ramiro had ever seen in hi long and vari
experi upon the sea the littl swallow with her crew of three
men had run the gauntlet of the fort which wa warn and wait for
her had sunk and sail through the big govern boat and her crew of
lubberli soldier mani of whom he wa glad to reflect were drown
had crush the offic against whom he had a person grudg like an
eggshel and won through to the open sea there he thought he wa sure
of her for he took it for grant that she would run for the norfolk
coast and knew that in the gale of wind which wa blow hi larger
and wellman vessel could pull her down but then the illluckthat
ancient illluck which alwai dog him when he began to interfer with
the affair of lysbeth and her relativesdeclar itself
instead of attempt to cross the north sea the littl swallow hug
the coast where for variou nautic reason connect with the wind
the water and the build of their respect ship she had the leg of
him next he lost her in the gut and after that we know what happen
there wa no disguis it it wa a most dread fiasco to have on
vessel board the expens vessel in which so larg a proport of
the gain of hi honour compani had been invest not onli board
but fire and the watchman stab by a singl nake devil of unknown
sex or charact wa bad enough and then the end of it
to have found the goldladen ship to have been gull into attack
her andandoh he could scarc bear to think of it there wa but
on consol although too late to save the other even through the
mist he had seen that wisp of smoke rise from the hold ye he the
experienc had smelt a rat and warn by some halfdivin intuit
had kept hi distanc with the result that he wa still aliv
but the other those gallant comrad in adventur where were thei
well to be frank he did not greatli care there wa anoth question
of more moment where wa the treasur now that hi brain had clear
after the shock and turmoil it wa evid to him that foi van goorl
red martin and the white devil who had board hi ship would not have
destroi so much wealth if thei could help it and still less would
thei have destroi themselv therefor to pursu the matter to a
logic conclus it seem probabl that thei had spent the night in
sink or buri the monei and prepar the pretti trap into which
he had walk so the secret wa in their hand and as thei were still
aliv veri possibl mean could be found to induc them to reveal it
hidingplac there wa still hope inde now that he came to weigh
thing thei were not so bad
to begin with almost all the sharehold in the affair had perish
by the stern decre of provid and he wa the natur heir of
their interest in other word the treasur if it wa recov wa
henceforth hi properti further when thei came to hear the stori the
govern would set down brant fortun as hopelessli lost so that
the gall competit from which he had suffer so much wa at an
end
under these circumst what wa to be done veri soon as he sail
awai over the lake in the sweet air of the morn the senor ramiro
found an answer to the question
the treasur had left the hagu he must leav the hagu the secret of
it dispos wa at leyden henceforth he must live at leyden why not
he knew leyden well it wa a pleasant place but of cours he might
be recognis there though after so long thi wa scarc probabl
for wa not the count de montalvo notori dead and buri time and
accid had chang him moreov he could bring art to the assist
of natur in leyden too he had confederatesblack meg to wit for
on also he had fund for wa he not the treasur of the compani
that thi veri morn had achiev so remark and unsoughtfor an
ascens
there wa onli on thing against the scheme in leyden live lysbeth van
goorl and her husband and with them a certain young man whose parentag
he could guess more her son foi knew the hidingplac of brant
hoard and from him or hi servant martin that secret must be won
so onc again he wa destin to match himself against lysbethth
wrong the dread the victori lysbeth whose voic of
denunci still rang in hi ear whose ey of fire still scorch
hi soul the woman whom he fear abov everyth on earth he fought
her onc for monei and although he won the monei it had done him
littl good for in the end she worst him now if he went to leyden
he must fight her again for monei and what would be the issu of that
war wa it worth while to take the risk would not histori repeat
itself if he hurt her would she not crush him but the treasur that
mighti treasur which could give him so much and abov all could
restor to him the rank and station he had forfeit and which he
covet more than anyth in life for low as he had fallen montalvo
could not forget that he had been born a gentleman
he would take hi chanc he would go to leyden had he weigh the
matter in the gloom of night or even in a dull and stormi hour
perhapsnai probablyh would have decid otherwis but thi morn
the sun shone brightli the wind made a merri music in the reed on the
rippl surfac of the lake the marshbird sang and from the shore
came a cheer low of kine in such surround hi fear and
superstit vanish he wa master of himself and he knew that all
depend upon himself the rest wa dream and nonsens behind him lai
the buri gold befor him rose the tower of leyden where he could
find it kei a god that haunt legend of a god of vengeanc in
which priest and other affect to believ now that he came to think
of it what rubbish wa here for as ani agent of the inquisit knew
well the vengeanc alwai fell upon those who trust in thi same god
a hundr tortur den a thousand smoke fire bore wit to the
fact and if there wa a god why recognis hi person merit
onli thi morn he had select him out of mani to live on and be the
inheritor of the wealth of hendrik brant ye he would go to leyden and
fight the battl out
at the entri of the gut the senor ramiro land from hi boat at first
he had thought of kill hi companion so that he might remain the
sole survivor of the catastroph but on reflect he abandon thi
idea as the man wa a faith creatur of hi own who might be us
so he bade him return to the hagu to tell the stori of the destruct
of the ship swallow with the treasur her attack and her crew
whoever thei might have been he wa to add moreov that so far as
he knew the captain ramiro had perish also as he the steersman wa
left alon in charg of the boat when the vessel blew up then he wa to
come to leyden bring with him certain good and paper belong to
him ramiro
thi plan seem to have advantag no on would continu to hunt for
the treasur no on except himself and perhap black meg would know
that foi van goorl and martin had been on board the swallow and
escap inde as yet he wa not quit sure of it himself for the rest
he could either lie hidden or if it prove desir announc that he
still live even if hi messeng should prove faithless and tell the
truth it would not greatli matter see that he knew noth which
could be of servic to anybodi
and so the steersman sail awai while ramiro fill with memori
reflect and hope walk quietli through the morsch poort into the
good citi of leyden
that even but not until dark had fallen two other travel
enter leyden name foi and martin pass unobserv through
the quiet street thei reach the side door of the hous in the bree
straat it wa open by a servingwoman who told foi that hi mother

at a time for had he not a great stori to tell

thei were as much preoccupi as the younger coupl and it wa not
difficult for foi to guess that fear for hi own safeti upon hi

unnumb fear for the dweller in the netherland in those dai

now as he knew well all thi would be chang foi the exuber
unrefin plainspoken nerveshak foi would becom the centr of

while martin that brutal bull of a man who wa onli fit to draw a cart

the govern boat of the run through the gale to the haarlem mere
with the dead pilot on board and the spanish ship behind and of the
secret midnight buri of the treasur
where did you buri it ask adrian
i have not the slightest idea said foi i believ there ar about
three hundr islet in that part of the mere and all i know is that
we dug a hole in on of them and stuck it in howev he went on in
a burst of confid we made a map of the place that is here he
broke off with a howl of pain for an accid had happen
while thi narr wa proceed martin who wa stand by him
sai ja and neen at interv as adrian foresaw he would had
unbuckl the great sword silenc and in an abstract manner wa
amus himself by throw it toward the ceil hilt downward and
as it fell catch it in hi hand now most unaccount he look
the other wai and miss hi catch with the result that the handl of
the heavi weapon fell exactli upon foi left foot and then clatter to
the ground
you awkward beast roar foi you have crush my toe and he
hop toward a chair upon on leg
your pardon master said martin i know it wa careless my mother

the end of all your nois if you ar not care we shall have him
break anoth vessel go out of the room all of you you can finish
tell the stori downstair and she drove them befor her as a
farmer wife drive fowl
martin said foi on the stair where thei found themselv togeth
for a minut for at the first sign of the storm dirk had preced
them why did you drop that accurs great sword of your upon my
foot
master count martin imperturb why did you hit me in the pit
of the stomach with your elbow
to keep your tongu quiet
and what is the name of my sword
silenc
well then i drop the sword silenc for the same reason i hope
it hasnt hurt you much but if it did i cant help it
foi wheel round what do you mean martin
i mean answer the great man with energi that you have no right to
tell what becam of that paper which mother martha gave us
why not i have faith in my brother
veri like master but that isnt the point we carri a great secret
and thi secret is a trust a danger trust it would be wrong to lai
it burden upon the shoulder of other folk what peopl dont know thei
cant tell master
foi still stare at him half in question half in anger but martin
made no further repli in word onli he went through certain curiou
motion motion as of a man wind slowli and labori at someth
like a pump wheel foi lip turn pale
the rack he whisper martin nod and answer beneath hi
breath
thei mai all of them be on it yet you let the man in the boat escap
and that man wa the spanish spy ramiro i am sure of it if thei dont
know thei cant tell and though we know we shant tell we shall die
first master
now foi trembl and lean against the wall what would betrai us he
ask
who know master a woman torment a man and he put a strang
mean into hi voic a mansjealousi or pride or vengeanc oh
bridl your tongu and trust no on no not your father or mother
or sweetheart or and again that strang mean came into martin
voic or brother
or you queri foi look up
i am not sure ye i think you mai trust me though there is no
know how the rack might chang a man mind
if all thi be so said foi with a flush of sudden passion i have
said too much alreadi
a great deal too much master if i could have manag it i should have
drop the sword silenc on your toe long befor but i couldnt for
the heer adrian wa watch me and i had to wait till he close hi
ey which he did to hear the better without seem to listen
you ar unjust to adrian martin as you alwai have been and i am
angri with you sai what is to be done now
now master repli martin cheerfulli you must forget the teach
of the pastor arentz and tell a lie you must take up your tale where
you left it off and sai that we made a map of the hidingplac but
thatib a foolmanag to drop it while we were light the
fuse so that it wa blown awai with the ship i will tell the same
stori
am i to sai thi to my father and mother
certainli and thei will quit understand why you sai it my mistress
wa get uneasi alreadi and that wa why she drove us from the room
you will tell them that the treasur is buri but that the secret of
it hidingplac wa lost
even so martin it is not lost mother martha know it and thei all
will guess that she doe know it
why master as it happen you were in such a hurri to get on with
your stori that i think you forgot to mention that she wa present at
the buri of the barrel her name wa come when i drop the sword
upon your foot
but she board and fire the spanish shipso the man ramiro and hi
companion would probabl have seen her
i doubt master that the onli person who saw her wa he whose gizzard
she split and he will tell no tale probabl thei think it wa you or
i who did that deed but if she wa seen or if thei know that she
ha the secret then let them get it from mother martha oh mare can
gallop and duck can dive and snake can hide in the grass when thei
can catch the wind and make it give up it secret when thei can charm
from sword silenc the tale of the blood which it ha drunk throughout
the gener when thei can call back the dead saint from heaven and
stretch them anew within the torturepit then and not befor thei will
win knowledg of the hoard hidingplac from the lip of the witch of
haarlem meer oh master fear not for her the grave is not so safe
why did you not caution me befor martin
becaus master answer martin stolidli i did not think that you
would be such a fool but i forgot that you ar youngy i forget
that you ar young and good too good for the dai we live in it is my
fault on my head be it
chapter xvi
the master
in the sittingroom speak more slowli and with greater caution foi
continu the stori of their adventur when he came to the tale of
how the ship swallow wa blown up with all the spanish boarder
elsa clasp her hand sai horribl horribl think of the poor
creatur hurl thu into etern
and think of the busi thei were on broke in dirk grimli ad
mai god forgiv me who cannot feel griev to hear of the death of
spanish cutthroat it wa well manag foi excel well manag
but go on
i think that is about all said foi shortli except that two of the
spaniard got awai in a boat on of whom is believ to be the head spy
and captain ramiro
but son up in adrian chamber just now you said someth about
have made a map of the hidingplac of the gold where is it for it
should be put in safeti
ye i know i did answer foi but didnt i tell you he went
on awkwardli martin manag to drop the thing in the cabin of the
swallow while we were light the fuse so it wa blown up with the
ship and there is now no record of where the stuff wa buri
come come son said dirk martha who know everi island on the
great lake must rememb the spot
oh no she doesnt answer foi the truth is that she didnt come
with us when we buri the barrel she stop to watch the spanish
ship and just told us to land on the first island we came to and dig a
hole which we did make a map of the place befor we left the same
that martin drop
all thi clumsi falsehood foi utter with a wooden face and in a voic
which would not have convinc a threeyearold infant pride himself
the while upon hi extraordinari clever
martin ask dirk suspici is thi true
absolut true master repli martin it is wonder how well he
rememb
son said dirk turn white with suppress anger you have alwai
been a good lad and now you have shown yourself a brave on but i prai
god that i mai not be forc to add that you ar falsetongu do you
not see that thi look black the treasur which you have hidden is the
greatest in all the netherland will not folk sai it is not wonder
that you should have forgotten it secret untilit suit you to
rememb
foi took a step forward hi face crimson with indign but the
heavi hand of martin fell upon hi shoulder and drag him back as
though he were but a littl child
i think master foi he said fix hi ey upon lysbeth that your
ladi mother wish to sai someth
you ar right martin i do do you not think husband that in these
dai of our a man might have other reason for hide the truth than a
desir to enrich himself by theft
what do you mean wife ask dirk foi here sai that he ha buri
thi great hoard with martin but that he and martin do not know where
thei buri it and have lost the map thei made whatev mai be the
exact word of the will that hoard belong to my cousin here subject
to certain trust which have not yet arisen and mai never aris and i
am her guardian while hendrik brant live and hi executor when he di
therefor legal it belong to me also by what right then do my
son and my servant hide the truth from me if inde thei ar hide
the truth sai what you have to sai straight out for i am a plain man
and cannot read riddl
then i will sai it husband though it is but my guess for i have had
no word with foi or martin and if i am wrong thei can correct me i
know their face and i think with you that thei ar not speak the
truth i think that thei do not wish us to know itnot that thei mai
keep the secret of thi treasur for themselv but becaus such a
secret might well bring those who know of it to the torment and the
stake is it not so my son
mother answer foi almost in a whisper it is so the paper is not
lost but do not seek to learn it hidingplac for there ar wolv
who would tear your bodi limb from limb to get the knowledg out of
you ye even elsa even elsa if the trial must come let it fall
on me and martin who ar fitter to bear it oh father sure you know
that whatev we mai be neither of us is a thief
dirk advanc to hi son and kiss him on the forehead
my son he said pardon me and you red martin pardon me also i
spoke in my hast i spoke as a fool who at my ag should have known
better but oh i tell you that i wish that thi curs treasur these
case of preciou gem and these keg of hoard gold had been shiver
to the wind of heaven with the timber of the ship swallow for mark
you ramiro ha escap and with him anoth man and thei will know
well that have the night to hide it you did not destroi those jewel
with the ship thei will track you down these spanish sleuthhound
fill with the lust of blood and gold and it will be well if the
live of everi on of us do not pai the price of the secret of the
buryingplac of the wealth of hendrik brant
he ceas pale and trembl and a silenc fell upon the room and all
in it a sad and heavi silenc for in hi voic thei caught the note of
propheci martin broke it
it mai be so master he said but your pardon you should have
thought of that befor you undertook thi duti there wa no call upon
you to send the heer foi and myself to the hagu to bring awai thi
trash but you did it as would ani other honest man well now it is
done and we must take our chanc but i sai thisif you ar wise my
master ye and you ladi also befor you leav thi room you
will swear upon the bibl everi on of you never to whisper the word
treasur never to think of it except to believ that it is gonelost
beneath the water of the haarlem meer never to whisper it no
mistress not even to the heer adrian your son who li sick ab
upstair
you have learnt wisdom somewher of late year martin sinc you
stop drink and fight said dirk drili and for my part befor
god i swear it
and so do i and i and i and i echo the other martin
who spoke last ad ye i swear that i will never speak of it no
not even to my young master adrian who li sick ab upstair
adrian made a good though not a veri quick recoveri he had lost
a great deal of blood but the vessel close without further
complic so that it remain onli to renew hi strength by rest
and ampl food for ten dai or so after the return of foi and martin
he wa kept in bed and nurs by the women of the hous elsa share
in thi treatment wa to read to him from the spanish romanc which he
admir veri soon howev he found that he admir elsa herself even
more than the romanc and would ask her to shut the book that he might
talk to her so long as hi convers wa about himself hi dream
plan and ambit she fell into it readili enough but when he began
to turn it upon herself and to lard it with compliment and amor
innuendo then she demur and fled to the romanc for refug
handsom as he might be adrian had no attract for elsa about
him there wa someth too exagger for her tast moreov he wa
spanish spanish in hi beauti spanish in the cast of hi mind and all
spaniard were hate to her deep down in her heart also lai a second
reason for thi repugn the man remind her of anoth man who for
month had been a nightmar to her soul the hagu spy ramiro thi
ramiro she had observ close though she had not seen him veri often
hi terribl reput wa familiar to her she knew also for her
father had told her as much that it wa he who wa draw the net
about him at the hagu and who plot dai and night to rob him of hi
wealth
at first sight there wa no great resembl between the pair how
could there be inde between a man on the wrong side of middl ag
oneei grizzl batter and bear about with him an atmospher
of iniqu and a young gentleman handsom distinguish and
wayward but assuredli no crimin yet the like exist she
had seen it first when adrian wa point out to her how were he a
gener he would dispos hi forc for the captur of leyden and from
that moment her natur rose in arm against him also it came out in
other wai in littl trick of voic and pompos of manner which
elsa caught at unexpect moment perhap as she told herself becaus
she had train her mind to seek these similar yet all the while
she knew that the fanci wa ridicul for what could these two men
have in common with each other
in those dai howev elsa did not think much of adrian or of anybodi
except her belov father whose onli child she wa and whom she ador
with all the passion of her heart she knew the terribl danger in which
he stood and guess that she had been sent awai that she should not
share hi peril now she had but on desir and on prayerthat he
might escap in safeti and that she might return to him again onc
onli a messag came from him sent through a woman she had never seen
the wife of a fisherman who deliv it by word of mouth thi wa the
messag
give my love and bless to my daughter elsa and tell her that so far
i am unharm to foi van goorl sai i have heard the new well done
thou good and faith servant let him rememb what i told him and be
sure that he will not strive in vain and that he shall not lack for hi
reward here or hereaft
that wa all tide reach them that the destruct of so mani men
by the blow up of the swallow and by her sink of the govern
boat as she escap had caus much excit and furi among the
spaniard but as those who had been blown up were freelanc and as
the boat wa sunk while the swallow wa fly from them noth had
been done in the matter inde noth could be done for it wa not
known who man the swallow and as ramiro had foreseen her crew
were suppos to have been destroi with her in the haarlem meer
then after a while came other new that fill elsa heart with a
wild hope for it wa report that hendrik brant had disappear and
wa believ to have escap from the hagu noth more wa heard of
him howev which is scarc strang for the doom man had
gone down the path of rich heret into the silent vault of the
inquisit the net had close at last and through the net fell the
sword
but if elsa thought seldom of adrian except in gust of spasmod
dislik adrian thought of elsa and littl besid so earnestli did
he lash hi romant tempera and so deepli did her beauti and charm
appeal to him that veri soon he wa truli in love with her nor did the
fact that as he believ she wa potenti the greatest heiress
in the netherland cool adrian amor devot what could suit him
better in hi condit than to marri thi rich and love ladi
so adrian made up hi mind that he would marri her for in hi vaniti
it never occur to him that she might object inde the onli thought
that gave him troubl wa the difficulti of reduc her wealth into
possess foi and martin had buri it somewher in the haarlem
meer but thei said for thi he had ascertain by repeat inquiri
although the inform wa given grudgingli enough that the map of
the hidingplac had been destroi in the explos on the swallow
adrian did not believ thi stori for a moment he wa convinc that
thei were keep the truth from him and as the prospect master of
that treasur he resent thi retic bitterli still it had to be
overcom and so soon as he wa engag to elsa he intend to speak
veri clearli upon thi point meanwhil the first thing wa to find a
suitabl opportun to make hi declar in due form which done he
would be prepar to deal with foi and martin
toward even it wa elsa custom to walk abroad as at that hour foi
left the foundri natur he accompani her in these walk martin
follow at a littl distanc in case he should be want soon those
excurs becam delight to both of them to elsa especi it
wa pleasant to escap from the hot hous into the cool even air
and still more pleasant to exchang the labour tender and
highli colour compliment of adrian for the cheer honesti of foi
convers
foi admir hi cousin as much as did hi halfbroth but hi attitud
toward her wa veri differ he never said sweet thing he never
gaze up into her ey and sigh although onc or twice perhap by
accid he did squeez her hand hi demeanour toward her wa that of
a friend and rel and the subject of their talk for the most part
wa the possibl of her father deliver from the danger which
surround him and other matter of the sort
the time came at last when adrian wa allow to leav hi room and
as it chanc it fell to elsa lot to attend him on thi first journei
downstair in a dutch home of the period and of the class of the van
goorl all the womenfolk of whatev degre were expect to take
a share in the household work at present elsa share wa to nurs to
adrian who show so much temper at everi attempt which wa made
to replac her by ani other woman that in face of the doctor
instruct lysbeth did not dare to cross hi whim
it wa with no small delight therefor that elsa hail the prospect
of releas for the young man with hi grandios bear and amor
sigh weari her almost beyond endur adrian wa not equal
pleas inde he had feign symptom which caus him to remain in
bed an extra week mere in order that he might keep her near him but
now the inevit hour had come and adrian felt that it wa incumb
upon him to lift the veil and let elsa see some of the secret of
hi soul he had prepar for the event inde the tedium of hi
confin had been much reliev by the composit of lofti and
heartstir address in which he the nobl cavali laid hi
preciou self and fortun at the feet of thi undistinguish but rich
and attract maid
yet now when the moment wa with him and when elsa gave him her hand
to lead him from the room behold all these beauti imagin had
vanish and hi knee shook with no fanci weak somehow elsa did
not look as a girl ought to look who wa about to be propos to she
wa too cold and dignifi too utterli unconsci of anyth unusu
it wa disconcertingbutit must be done
by a superb effort adrian recov himself and open with on of the
fine speech not the best by ani mean but the onli specimen which he
could rememb
without he began the free air wait to be press by my cramp
wing but although my heart bound wild as that of ani haggard hawk i
tell you fairest elsa that in yonder gild cage and he point to
the bed i
heaven abov us heer adrian broke in elsa in alarm ar youar
youget giddi
she doe not understand poor child how should she he murmur in a
stage asid then he start again ye most ador best belov
i am giddi giddi with gratitud to those fair hand giddi with worship
of those love ey
now elsa unabl to contain her merriment ani longer burst out
laugh but see that her ador face wa begin to look as
it did in the diningroom befor he broke the blood vessel she check
herself and said
oh heer adrian dont wast all thi fine poetri upon me i am too
stupid to understand it
poetri he exclaim becom suddenli natur it isnt poetri
then what is it she ask and next moment could have bitten her
tongu out
it isit islov and he sank upon hi knee befor her where she
could not but notic he look veri handsom in the subdu light of
the room with hi upturn face blanch by sick and hi southern
glow ey elsa i love you and no other and unless you return that
love my heart will break and i shall die
now under ordinari circumst elsa would have been quit compet
to deal with the situat but the fear of overagit adrian
complic it greatli about the realiti of hi feel at the moment
at ani rate it seem imposs to be mistaken for the man wa
shake like a leaf still she must make an end of these advanc
rise heer adrian she said gentli hold out her hand to help him
to hi feet
he obei and glanc at her face saw that it wa veri calm and cold
as winter ic
listen heer adrian she said you mean thi kindli and doubtless
mani a maid would be flatter by your word but i must tell you that i
am in no mood for lovemak
becaus of anoth man he queri and suddenli becom theatric
again ad speak on let me hear the worst i will not quail
there is no need to repli elsa in the same quiet voic becaus
there is no other man i have never yet thought of marriag i have no
wish that wai and if i had i should forget it now when from hour to
hour i do not know where my dear father mai be or what fate await him
he is my onli lover heer adrian and as elsa spoke her soft brown ey
fill with tear
ah said adrian would that i might fly to save him from all danger
as i rescu you ladi from the bandit of the wood
i would you might she repli smile sadli at the doubl mean of
the word but hark your mother is call us i know heer adrian
she ad gentli that you will understand and respect my dread
anxieti and will not troubl me again with poetri and lovetalk for if
you do i shall beangri
ladi he answer your wish ar my law and until these cloud
have roll from the blue heaven of your life i will be as silent as the
watch moon and by the wai he ad rather nervous perhap
you will be silent alsoabout our talk i mean as we do not want that
buffoon foi thrust hi streetboi fun at us
elsa bow her head she wa inclin to resent the we and other
thing in thi speech but abov all she did not wish to prolong thi
foolish and tiresom interview so without more word she took her
admir by the hand and guid him down the stair
it wa but three dai after thi ridicul scene on a certain
afternoon when adrian had been out for the second time that the
evil tide came dirk had heard them in the town and return home
wellnigh weep elsa saw hi face and knew at onc
oh is he dead she gasp
he nod for he dare not trust himself to speak
how where
in the poort prison at the hagu
how do you know
i have seen a man who help to buri him
she look up as though to ask for further detail but dirk turn awai
mutter he is dead he is dead let be
then she understood nor did she ever seek to know ani more whatev he
had suffer at least now he wa with the god he worship and with
the wife he lost onli the poor orphan comfort by lysbeth crept from
the chamber and for a week wa seen no more when she appear again
she seem to be herself in all thing onli she never smile and wa
veri indiffer to what took place about her thu she remain for
mani dai
although thi demeanour on elsa part wa understood and receiv with
sympathi and more by the rest of the household adrian soon began to
find it irksom and even ridicul so coloss wa thi young man
vaniti that he wa unabl quit to understand how a girl could be so
wrap up in the memori of a murder father that no place wa left
in her mind for the tender of a present ador after all thi
father what wa he a middleag and doubtless quit uninterest
burgher who could lai claim to but on distinct that of great
wealth most of which had been amass by hi ancestor
now a rich man aliv ha point of interest but a rich man dead is
onli interest to hi heir also thi brant wa on of these
narrowmind fanat new religion fellow who were so wearisom to
men of intellect and refin true he adrian wa himself of that
commun for circumst had driven him into the herd but oh he
found them a dreari set their bald doctrin of individu effort of
person strive to win a person redempt did not appeal to him
moreov thei gener end at the stake now about the pomp and
circumst of the mother church there wa someth attract of
cours as a matter of prejudic he attend it ceremoni from time
to time and found them comfort and satisfi comfort also
were the dogma of forgiv to be obtain by an act of penitenti
confess and the sens of a great support forc whose whole weight
wa at the dispos of the humblest believ
in short there wa noth picturesqu about the excel depart
hendrik noth that could justifi the young woman in wrap herself
up in grief for him to the entir exclus of a person who wa
picturesqu and readi at the first opportun to wrap himself up in
her
after long brood assist by a close studi of the romanc of the
period adrian convinc himself that in all thi there wa someth
unnatur that the girl must be under a speci of spell which in her
own interest ought to be broken through but how that wa the question
try as he would he could do noth therefor like other in a
difficulti he determin to seek the assist of an expert name
black meg who among her other occup for a certain fee payabl
in advanc wa readi to give advic as a specialist in affair of the
heart
to black meg accordingli he went disguis secretli and by night for
he love mysteri and in truth it wa hardli safe that he should visit
her by the light of dai seat in a shadow chamber he pour out hi
artless tale to the pytho of cours conceal all name he might
have spare himself thi troubl as he wa an old client of meg a
fact that no disguis could keep from her befor he open hi lip
she knew perfectli what wa the name of hi inamorata and inde all the
circumst connect with the pair of them
the wise woman listen in patienc and when he had done shook her
head sai that the case wa too hard for her she propos howev
to consult a master more learn than herself who by great good
fortun wa at that moment in leyden frequent her hous in fact
and beg that adrian would return at the same hour on the morrow

so you might see him often enough but not at last week meet
it is needless to follow the convers further the seer by aid of a
ball of crystal that he produc from the fold of hi cloak describ
hi spirit vision and the pupil correct them from hi intim
knowledg of the fact until the senor ramiro and hi confeder in
the cupboard had enough evid as evid wa understood in those
dai to burn dirk foi and martin three time over and if it should
suit him adrian also then for that night thei part
next even adrian wa back again with the finger in the bottl
which meg grab as a pike snatch at a frog and further fascin

temper with shrewd advic upon love affair and other worldli matter
and with flatteri of hi own person and gift singularli attract
sever time did he return thu for as it chanc elsa had been unwel
and kept her room so that he discov no opportun of administ
the magic philtr that wa to caus her heart to burn with love for him
at length when even the patient ramiro wa almost worn out by the young
gentleman lengthi visit the luck chang elsa appear on dai
at dinner and with great adroit adrian quit unseen of anyon
contriv to empti the phial into her goblet of water which as he
rejoic to see she drank to the last drop
but no opportun such as he sought ensu for elsa overcom
doubtless by an unwont rush of emot retir to battl it in her
own chamber sinc it wa imposs to follow and propos to her there
adrian possess hi soul in such patienc as he could command sat
in the sittingroom to await her return for he knew that it wa not her
habit to go out until five oclock as it happen howev elsa
had other arrang for the afternoon sinc she had promis to
accompani lysbeth upon sever visit to the wive of neighbour and
then to meet her cousin foi at the factori and walk with him in the
meadow beyond the town
so while adrian lost in dream wait in the sittingroom elsa and
lysbeth left the hous by the side door
thei had paid three of their visit when their path chanc to lead them
past the old town prison which wa call the gevangenhui thi place
form on of the gatewai of the citi for it wa built in the wall
and open on to the moat water surround it on all side in front
of it massiv door that wa guard by two soldier a small crowd
had gather on the drawbridg and in the street beyond appar
in expect of somebodi or someth lysbeth look at the
threestori frown build and shudder for it wa here that
heret were put upon their trial and here too mani of them were
done to death after the dread fashion of the dai
hasten she said to elsa as she push through the crowd for
doubtless some horror pass here
have no fear answer an elderli and goodnatur woman who overheard
her we ar onli wait to hear the new governor of the prison read
hi deed of appoint
as she spoke the door were thrown open and a manh wa a wellknown
execution name baptistecam out carri a sword in on hand and a
bunch of kei on a salver in the other after him follow the governor
gallantli dress and escort by a compani of soldier and the
offici of the prison draw a scroll from beneath hi cloak he
began to read it rapidli and in an almost inaud voic
it wa hi commiss as governor of the prison sign by alva
himself and set out in full hi power which were consider hi
respons which were small and other matter except onli
the sum of monei that he had paid for the offic that given certain
condit wa as a matter of fact sold to the highest bidder as
mai be guess thi post of governor of a gaol in on of the larg
netherland citi wa lucr enough to those who did not object to
such a fashion of grow rich so lucr wa it inde that the
salari suppos to attach to the offic wa never paid at least it
occup wa expect to help himself to it out of heret pocket
as he finish read through the paper the new governor look up
to see perhap what impress he had produc upon hi audienc now
elsa saw hi face for the first time and grip lysbeth arm
it is ramiro she whisper ramiro the spy the man who dog my
father at the hagu
as well might she have spoken to a statu inde of a sudden lysbeth
seem to be smitten into stone for there she stood stare with a
blanch and meaningless face at the face of the man opposit to her
well might she stare for she also knew him across the gulf of year
oneei beard wither scar as he wa by suffer passion
and evil thought she knew him for there befor her stood on whom she
deem dead the wretch whom she had believ to be her husband juan de
montalvo some magnet drew hi gaze to her out of all the face
of that crowd it wa her that leapt to hi ey he trembl and grew
white he turn awai and swiftli wa gone back into the hell of the
gevangenhui like a demon he had come out of it to survei the human
world beyond and search for victim there like a demon he went back
into hi own place so at least it seem to lysbeth
come come she mutter and draw the girl with her pass out of
the crowd
elsa began to talk in a strain voic that from time to time broke into
a sob
that is the man she said he hound down my father it wa hi
wealth he want but my father swore that he would die befor he should
win it and he is deaddead in the inquisit and that man is hi
murder
lysbeth made no answer never a word she utter till present thei
halt at a mean and humbl door then she spoke for the first time in
cold and constrain accent
i am go in here to visit the vrouw jansen you have heard of her
the wife of him whom thei burn she sent to me to sai that she is
sick i know not of what but there is smallpox about i have heard of
four case of it in the citi so cousin it is wisest that you should
not enter here give me the basket with the food and wine look yonder
is the factori quit close at hand and there you will find foi oh
never mind ramiro what is done is done go and walk with foi and for a
while forgetramiro
at the door of the factori elsa found foi await her and thei walk
togeth through on of the gate of the citi into the pleasant meadow
that lai beyond at first thei did not speak much for each of them wa
occupi with thought which press their tongu to silenc when thei
were clear of the town howev elsa could contain herself no more
inde the anguish awaken in her mind by the sight of ramiro work
upon nerv alreadi overstrung had made her halfhyster she began
to speak the word broke from her like water from a dam which it ha
breach she told foi that she had seen the man and moremuch more
all the miseri which she had suffer all the love for the father who
wa lost to her
at last elsa ceas outworn and stand still there upon the river
bank she wrung her hand and wept till now foi had said noth for
hi good spirit and cheer readi seem to have forsaken him
even now he said noth all he did wa to put hi arm about thi
sweet maid waist and draw her to him to kiss her upon brow and
ey and lip she did not resist it never seem to occur to her to
show resent inde she let her head sink upon hi shoulder like
the head of a littl child and there sob herself to silenc at last
she lift her face and ask veri simpli
what do you want with me foi van goorl
what he repeat why i want to be your husband
is thi a time for marri and give in marriag she ask again
but almost as though she were speak to herself
i dont know that it is he repli but it seem the onli thing to
do and in such dai two ar better than on
she drew awai and look at him shake her head sadli my father
she began
ye he interrupt brighten thank you for mention him that
remind me he wish thi so i hope now that he is gone you will take
the same view
it is rather late to talk about that isnt it foi she stammer
look at hi shoulder and smooth her ruffl hair with her small
white hand but what do you mean
so word for word as nearli as he could rememb it he told her all
that hendrik brant had said to him in the cellar at the hagu befor
thei had enter upon the desper adventur of their flight to the
haarlem meer he wish it you see he end
my thought wa alwai hi thought andfoyi wish it also
priceless thing ar not lightli won said he quot brant word
as though by some afterthought
there he must have been talk of the treasur foi she answer
her face lighten to a smile
ay of the treasur sweet the treasur of your dear heart
a poor thing foi but i think thatit ring true
it had need elsa yet the best of coin mai crack with rough usag
mine will wear till death foi
i ask no more elsa when i am dead spend it elsewher i shall find
it again abov where there is no marri or give in marriag
there would be but small chang left to spend foi so look to your own
gold andse that you do not alter it imag and superscript for
metal will melt in the furnac and each queen ha her stamp
enough he broke in impati why do you talk of such thing and
in these riddl which puzzl me
becaus becaus we ar not marri yet andth word ar not
minepreci thing ar dearli won perfect love and perfect peac
cannot be bought with a few sweet word and kiss thei must be earn
in trial and tribul
of which i have no doubt we shall find plenti foi repli cheerfulli
meanwhil the kiss make a good road to travel on
after thi elsa did not argu ani more
at length thei turn and walk homeward through the quiet even
twilight hand clasp in hand and were happi in their wai it wa not
a veri demonstr wai for the dutch have never been excit or
at least thei do not show their excit moreov the condit
of thi betroth were peculiar it wa as though their hand had been
join from a deathb the deathb of hendrik brant the martyr of
the hagu whose newsh blood cri out to heaven for vengeanc thi
sens press on both of them did not tend toward raptur outburst
of youth passion and even if thei could have shaken it off and
let their young blood have rein there remain anoth sensethat of
danger ahead of them
two ar better than on foi had said and for her own reason she
had not wish to argu the point still elsa felt that to it there wa
anoth side if two could comfort each other could help each other
could love each other could thei not also suffer for each other
in short by doubl their live did thei not also doubl their
anxieti or if children should come trebl and quadrupl them thi
is true of all marriag but how much more wa it true in such dai and
in such a case as that of foi and elsa both of them heret both of
them rich and therefor both liabl at a moment notic to be hale
to the torment and the stake know these thing and have but just

rejoic as ani woman must that the man to whom her soul turn had
declar himself her lover elsa could onli drink of thi joy cup
with a chasten and a fear spirit nor is it wonder that even in
the hour of hi triumph foi buoyant and hope natur wa chill by
the shadow of her fear and the forebod of hi own heart
when lysbeth part from elsa that afternoon she went straight to
the chamber of the vrouw jansen it wa a poor place for after the

lysbeth slept so ill as she did upon thi night montalvo wa aliv
montalvo wa here here to strike down and destroi those whom she love
and tripl arm with power author and desir to do the deed well
she knew that when there wa plunder to be won he would not step asid
or soften until it wa in hi hand yet there wa hope in thi he wa
not a cruel man as she knew also that is to sai he had no pleasur
in inflict suffer for it own sake such method he us onli as a
mean to an end if he could get the monei all of it she wa sure that
he would leav them alon why should he not have it why should all
their live be menac becaus of thi trust which had been thrust upon
them
unabl to endur the torment of her doubt and fear lysbeth woke her
husband who wa sleep peacefulli at her side and told him what wa
pass in her mind
it is a true sai answer dirk with a smile that even the best
of women ar never quit honest when their interest pull the other wai
what wife would you have us bui our own peac with brant fortun
and thu break faith with a dead man and bring down hi curs upon us
the live of men ar more than gold and elsa would consent she
answer sullenli alreadi thi pelf is stain with blood the blood
of hendrik brant himself and of han the pilot
ye wife and sinc you mention it with the blood of a good mani
spaniard also who tri to steal the stuff let see there must have
been sever drown at the mouth of the river and quit twenti went
up with the swallow so the loss ha not been all on our side listen
lysbeth listen it wa my cousin hendrik brant belief that in the
end thi great fortun of hi would do some servic to our peopl or our
countri for he wrote as much in hi will and repeat it to foi i know
not when or in what fashion thi mai come about how can i know but
first will i die befor i hand it over to the spaniard moreov i
cannot sinc it secret wa never told to me
foi and martin have it
lysbeth said dirk sternli i charg you as you love me not to work
upon them to betrai their trust no not even to save my life or your
ownif we must die let us die with honour do you promis
i promis she answer with dry lip but on thi condit onli
that you fly from leyden with us all tonight if mayb
good answer dirk a halfpenni for a her you have made your
promis and ill give you mine that fair although i am old to seek
a new home in england but it cant be tonight wife for i must make
arrang there is a ship sail todai and we might catch her
tomorrow at the river mouth after she ha pass the offic for
her captain is a friend of mine how will that do
i had rather it had been tonight said lysbeth while we ar in
leyden with that man we ar not safe from on hour to the next
wife we ar never safe it is all in the hand of god and therefor
we should live like soldier await the hour to march and rejoic
exceedingli when it pleas our captain to sound the call
i know she answer but oh dirk it would be hardto part
he turn hi head asid for a moment then said in a steadi voic
ye wife but it will be sweet to meet again and part no more
while it wa still earli that morn dirk summon foi and martin to
hi wife chamber adrian for hi own reason he did not summon make
the excus that he wa still asleep and it would be a piti to disturb
him nor elsa sinc as yet there wa no necess to troubl her
then briefli for he wa given to few word he set out the gist of
the matter tell them that the man ramiro whom thei had beaten on the
haarlem meer wa in leyden which foi knew alreadi for elsa had told
him as much and that he wa no other than the spaniard name the count
juan de montalvo the villain who had deceiv lysbeth into a mock
marriag by work on her fear and who wa the father of adrian all
thi time lysbeth sat in a carv oak chair listen with a stoni
face to the tale of her own shame and betray she made no sign at all
beyond a littl twitch of her finger till foi guess what she
suffer in her heart suddenli went to hi mother and kiss her then
she wept a few silent tear for an instant laid her hand upon hi head
as though in bless and motion him back to hi place becam
herself againstern unmov observ
next dirk take up hi tale spoke of hi wife fear and of her
belief that there wa a plot to wring out of them the secret of hendrik
brant treasur
happili he said address foi neither your mother nor i nor
adrian nor elsa know that secret you and martin know it alon you
and perhap on other who is far awai and cannot be caught we do not
know it and we do not wish to know it and whatev happen to ani of
us it is our earnest hope that neither of you will betrai it even if
our live or your live hang upon the word for we hold it better
that we should keep our trust with a dead man at all cost than that we
should save ourselv by break faith is it not so wife
it is so answer lysbeth hoars
have no fear said foi we will die befor we betrai
we will try to die befor we betrai grumbl martin in hi deep
voic but flesh is frail and god know
oh i have no doubt of you honest man said dirk with a smile for
you have no mother and father to think of in thi matter
then master you ar foolish repli martin for i repeat itflesh
is frail and i alwai hate the look of a rack howev i have a
handsom legaci charg upon thi treasur and perhap the thought of
that would support me aliv or dead i should not like to think of my
monei be spent by ani spaniard
while martin spoke the strang of the thing came home to foi here
were four of them two of whom knew a secret and two who did not while
those who did not implor those who did to impart to them noth of
the knowledg which if thei had it might serv to save them from a
fear doom then for the first time in hi young and inexperienc
life he understood how great er men and women can be and what
patient majesti dwell in the human heart that for the sake of a trust
it doe not seek can yet defi the most hideou terror of the bodi
and the soul inde that scene stamp itself upon hi mind in such
fashion that throughout hi long exist he never quit forgot it for
a singl dai hi mother clad in her frill white cap and grei gown
seat coldfac and resolut in the oaken chair hi father to whom
although he knew it not he wa now speak for the last time stand
by her hi hand rest upon her shoulder and address them in hi
quiet honest voic martin stand also but a littl to on side and
behind the light of the morn plai upon hi great red beard hi
round pale ey glitter as wa their fashion when wrath and
himself foi lean forward to listen everi nerv in hi bodi strung
tight with excit love and fear
oh he never forgot it which is not strang for so great wa the
strain upon him so well did he know that thi scene wa but the prelud
to terribl event that for a moment onli for a moment hi steadi
reason wa shaken and he saw a vision martin the huge patient
oxlik martin wa chang into a red vengeanc he saw him great
sword aloft he heard the roar of hi battl cry and lo befor him
men went down to death and about him the floor seem purpl with their
blood hi father and hi mother too thei were no longer human thei
were saintsse the glori which shone over them and look too the
dead hendrik brant wa whisper in their ear and he foi he wa
besid martin plai hi part in those red frai as best he might and
plai it not in vain
then all pass and a wave of peac roll over him a great sens of
duti done of honour satisfi of reward attain lo the plai wa
finish and it ultim mean clear but befor he could read and
understandit had gone
he gasp and shook himself grip hi hand togeth
what have you seen son ask lysbeth watch hi face
strang thing mother foi answer a vision of war for martin and
me of glori for my father and you and of etern peac for us all
it is a good omen foi she said fight your fight and leav us to
fight our through much tribul we must enter into the kingdom of
god where at last there is a rest remain for us all it is a good
omen your father wa right and i wa wrong now i have no more to fear
i am satisfi
none of them seem to be amaz or to find these word wonder and
out of the common for them the hand of approach doom had open the
gate of distanc and thei knew everyon that through these some light
had broken on their soul a faint flicker of dawn from beyond the
cloud thei accept it in thank
i think that is all i have to sai said dirk in hi usual voic no
it is not all and he told them of hi plan for flight thei listen
and agre to it yet to them it seem a thing far off and unreal none
of them believ that thi escap would ever be carri out all of them
believ that here in leyden thei would endur the fieri trial of their
faith and win each of them it separ crown
when everyth wa discuss and each had learn the lesson of what
he must do that dai foi ask if adrian wa to be told of the scheme
to thi hi father answer hastili that the less it wa spoken of the
better therefor he propos to tell adrian late that night onli when
he could make up hi mind whether he would accompani them or stai in
leyden
then he shant go out tonight and will come with us as far as the
ship onli if i can manag it mutter martin beneath hi breath but
aloud he said noth somehow it did not seem to him to be worth while
to make troubl about it for he knew that if he did hi mistress and
foi who believ so heartili in adrian would be angri
father and mother said foi again while we ar gather here there
is someth i wish to sai to you
what is it son ask dirk

consent and bless

noth she like elsa well indeedwho would notbut oh thi
brought them a step nearer to that accurs treasur the treasur which
from gener to gener had been hoard up that it might be a
doom to men if foi were affianc to elsa it wa hi inherit as
well as her for those trust of hendrik brant will were to lysbeth
thing unreal and visionari and it curs would fall upon him as well
as upon her moreov it might be said that he wa marri her to win
the wealth
thi betroth doe not pleas you you ar sad wife said dirk
look at her quickli
ye husband for now i think that we shall never get out of leyden i
prai that adrian mai not hear of it that is all

adrian adrian alwai adrian answer dirk impati well it is

to me to be us for certain purpos he ha or will have monei
alsosaf at interest in england hark here thei come so wife put
on a pleasant face thei will think it unlucki if you do not smile
as he spoke foi reenter the room lead elsa by the hand and she
look as sweet a maid as ever the sun shone on so thei told their
stori and kneel down befor dirk receiv hi bless in the old
fashion and veri glad were thei in the after year to rememb that it

up her hand to bless them but er it touch their head do what she
would to check it a cry forc it wai to her lip and she said
oh children doubtless you love each other well but is thi a time
for marri and give in marriag
my own word my veri word exclaim elsa spring to her feet and
turn pale
foi look vex then recov himself and try to smile he said
and i give them the same answerthat two ar better than on
moreov thi is a betroth not a marriag

betroth is on thing and marriag anoth but low as he spoke elsa
overheard him
your mother is upset broke in dirk and you can guess why so do not
disturb her more at present let us to our busi you and martin to

elsa
thei left the room but as martin wa follow them lysbeth call him
back
go arm to the factori martin she said and see that your young
master wear that steel shirt beneath hi jerkin
martin nod and went
adrian woke up that morn in an ill mood he had it is true
administ hi love potion with singular dexter and success but as
yet he reap no fruit from hi labour and wa desper afraid lest
the effect of the magic draught might wear off when he came downstair
it wa to find that foi and martin were alreadi depart to the factori
and that hi stepfath had gone out whither he knew not thi wa so
much to the good for it left the coast clear still he wa none the
better off sinc either hi mother and elsa had taken their breakfast
upstair or thei had dispens with that meal hi mother he could
spare especi after her recent contact with a plagu patient but
under the circumst elsa absenc wa annoi moreov suddenli
the hous had becom uncomfort for everi on in it seem to be
run about carri articl hither and thither in a fashion so
aimless that it struck him as littl short of insan onc or twice
also he saw elsa but she too wa carri thing and had no time for
convers
at length adrian weari of it and depart to the factori with the
view of make up hi book which to tell the truth had been somewhat
neglect of late to find that here too the same confus reign
instead of attend to hi ordinari work martin wa march to and
fro bear choic piec of brasswar which were be pack into
crate and he notic for adrian wa an observ young man that he
wa not wear hi usual artisan dress why he wonder to himself
should martin walk about a factori upon a summer dai clad in hi
armour of quilt bull hide and wear hi great sword silenc
strap round hi middl why too should foi have remov the book
and be engag in go through them with a clerk wa he audit
them if so he wish him joi of the job sinc to bring them to a
satisfactori balanc had prove recent quit beyond hi own power

what happen after thi adrian could never quit rememb but a vision
remain of himself crouch to on side and of a door flung back so
violent that it threw him against the wall a vision too of a ladi
sweep past him with blaze ey and lip set in scorn that wa all
for a while he wa crush quit crush the blow had gone home
adrian wa not onli a fool he wa also the vainest of fool that
ani young woman on whom he chose to smile should actual reject hi
advanc wa bad and unexpect but that the other man should be
foyoh thi wa infam and inexplic he wa handsom than foi
no on would dream of deni it he wa clever and better read had
he not master the content of everi known romancehighsoul work
which foi bluntli declar were rubbish and refus even to open wa
he not a poet but rememb a certain sonnet he did not follow thi
comparison in short how wa it conceiv that a woman look
upon himself a veri type of the chivalri of spain silvertongu a
followernai a companion of the muse on to whom in everi previou
adventur of the heart to love had been to conquer could still prefer
that broadfac painfulli commonplac if worthi young repres
of the dutch middl class foi van goorl
it never occur to adrian to ask himself anoth question name
how it come about that eight young women out of ten ar endow with
an intellig or instinct suffici keen to enabl them to
discrimin between an emptyhead popinjai of a man intox
with the fume of hi own vaniti and an honest young fellow of
stabl charact and sterl worth not that adrian wa altogeth
emptyhead for in some wai he wa clever also beneath all thi foam
and froth the dutch strain inherit from hi mother had given a certain

a minut later adrian found himself in the street toward which he had
been help by the kick of a heavi boot hi first impuls wa to run
and he ran for half a mile or more without stop till at length he
paus breathless in a desert street and lean against the wheel
of an unhar waggon tri to think think how could he think hi
mind wa on mad whirl rage shame disappoint passion all boil in
it like bone in a knacker cauldron he had been fool he had lost
hi love and oh infami he had betrai hi kindr to the hell of
the inquisit thei would be tortur and burnt ye even hi mother
and elsa might be burn sinc those devil respect neither ag nor
sex and their blood would be upon hi head it wa true that he had
sign under compuls but who would believ that for had thei not
taken down hi talk word for word for onc adrian saw himself as he
wa the cloak of vaniti and selflov were strip from hi soul and
he knew what other would think when thei came to learn the stori he
thought of suicid there wa water here wa steel the deed would not
be difficult no he could not it wa too horribl moreov how dare
he enter the other world so unprepar so steep in everi sort of
evil what then could he do to save hi charact and those whom hi
folli had betrai he look round him there not three hundr yard
awai rose the tall chimnei of the factori perhap there wa yet time
perhap he could still warn foi and martin of the fate which await
them
act on the impuls of the moment adrian start forward run
like a hare as he approach the build he saw that the workmen had
left for the big door were shut he race round to the small entranc
it wa openh wa through it and figur were move in the offic
god be prais thei were foi and martin to them he sped a whitefac
creatur with gape mouth and stare ey to look at more like a
ghost than a human be
martin and foi saw him and shrank back could thi be adrian thei
thought or wa it an evil vision
fly he gasp hide yourselv the offic of the inquisit
ar after you then anoth thought struck him and he stammer my
father and mother i must warn them and befor thei could speak he had
turn and wa gone as he went cry fly fly
foi stood astonish till martin struck him on the shoulder and said
roughli
come let us get out of thi either he is mad or he know someth
have you your sword and dagger quick then
thei pass through the door which martin paus to lock and into the
courtyard foi reach the gate first and look through it open bar
then veri deliber he shot the bolt and turn the great kei
ar you brainsick ask martin that you lock the gate on us
i think not repli foi as he came back to him it is too late to
escap soldier ar march down the street
martin ran and look through the bar it wa true enough there
thei came fifti men or more a whole compani head straight for the
factori which it wa thought might be garrison for defenc
now i can see no help but to fight for it martin said cheerfulli as
he hid the kei in the bucket of the well which he let run down to the
water
what can two men do against fifti ask foi lift hi steellin
cap to scratch hi head
not much still with good luck someth at least as noth but a
cat can climb the wall and the gatewai is stop i think we mai as
well die fight as in the torturechamb of the gevangenhui for
that is where thei mean to lodg us
i think so too answer foi take courag now how can we hurt
them most befor thei quiet us
martin look round reflect in the centr of the courtyard stood a
build not unlik a pigeonhous or the shelter that is sometim set
up in the middl of a market beneath which merchant gather in fact it
wa a shot tower where leaden bullet of differ size were cast and
drop through an open in the floor into a shallow tank below to
cool for thi wa part of the trade of the foundri
that would be a good place to hold he said and crossbow hang upon
the wall
foi nod and thei ran to the tower but not without be seen for
as thei set foot upon it stair the offic in command of the soldier
call upon them to surrend in the name of the king thei made
no answer and as thei pass through the doorwai a bullet from an
arquebu struck it woodwork
the shot tower stood upon oaken pile and the chamber abov which wa
round and about twenti feet in diamet wa reach by a broad ladder
of fifteen step such as is often us in stabl thi ladder end
in a littl land of about six feet squar and to the left of the
land open the door of the chamber where the shot were cast thei
went up into the place
what shall we do now said foi barricad the door
i can see no us in that answer martin for then thei would batter
it down or perhap burn a wai through it no let us take it off it
hing and lai it on block about eight inch high so that thei mai
catch their shin against it when thei try to rush us
a good notion said foi and thei lift off the narrow oaken door and
prop it up on four mould of metal across the threshold weight
it with other mould also thei strew the floor of the land with
threepound shot so that men in a hurri might step on them and fall
anoth thing thei did and thi wa foi notion at the end of the
chamber were the iron bath in which the lead wa melt and beneath
them furnac readi laid for the next dai found these foi set
alight pull out the damper to make them burn quickli and so melt
the leaden bar which lai in the trough
thei mai come underneath he said point to the trap through which
the hot shot were drop into the tank and then molten lead will be
us
martin smile and nod then he took down a crossbow from the wall
for in those dai when everi dwell and warehous might have to
be us as a place of defenc it wa common to keep a good store of
weapon hung somewher readi to hand and went to the narrow window
which overlook the gate
as i thought he said thei cant get in and dont like the look of
the iron spike so thei ar fetch a smith to burst it open we must
wait
veri soon foi began to fidget for thi wait to be butcher by an
overwhelm forc told upon hi nerv he thought of elsa and hi
parent whom he would never see again he thought of death and all the
terror and wonder that might lie beyond it death whose depth he must
so soon explor he had look to hi crossbow had test the string
and laid a good store of quarrel on the floor besid him he had taken
a pike from the wall and seen to it shaft and point he had stir
the fire beneath the leaden bar till thei roar in the sharp draught
is there noth more to do he ask
ye repli martin we might sai our prayer thei will be the
last and suit hi action to the word the great man knelt down an
exampl which foi follow
do you speak said foi i cant think of anyth
so martin began a prayer which is perhap worthi of record
o lord he said forgiv me all my sin which ar too mani to count
or at least i havent the time to try and especi for cut off
the head of the execution with hi own sword although i had no death
quarrel with him and for kill a spaniard in a box match o lord
i thank you veri much becaus you have arrang for us to die fight
instead of be tortur and burnt in the gaol and i prai that we
mai be abl to kill enough spaniard first to make them rememb us for
year to come o lord protect my dear master and mistress and let the
former learn that we have made an end of which he would approv but if
mai be hide it from the paster arentz who might think that we ought to
surrend that is all i have to sai amen
then foi did hi own prai and it wa hearti enough but we need
scarc stop to set down it substanc
meanwhil the spaniard had found a blacksmith who wa get to work
upon the gate for thei could see him through the open upper bar
why dont you shoot ask foi you might catch him with a bolt
becaus he is a poor dutchman whom thei have press for the job while
thei stand upon on side we must wait till thei break down the gate
also we must fight well when the time come master foi for see folk
ar watch us and thei will expect it and he point upward
foi look the foundri courtyard wa surround by tall gabl hous
and of these the window and balconi were alreadi crowd with
spectat word had gone round that the inquisit had sent soldier
to seiz on of the young van goorl and red martinthat thei were
batter at the gate of the factori therefor the citizen some of
them their own workmen gather there for thei did not think that red
martin and foi van goorl would be taken easili
the hammer at the gate went on but it wa veri stout and would not
give
martin said foi present i am frighten i feel quit sick i
know that i shall be no good to you when the pinch come
now i am sure that you ar a brave man answer martin with a short
laugh for otherwis you would never have own that you feel afraid
of cours you feel afraid and so do i it is the wait that doe it
but when onc the first blow ha been struck why you will be as happi
as a priest look you master so soon as thei begin to rush the ladder
do you get behind me close behind for i shall want all the room to
sweep with my sword and if we stand side by side we shall onli hinder
each other while with a pike you can thrust past me and be readi to
deal with ani who win through
you mean that you want to shelter me with your big carcas answer
foi but you ar captain here at least i will do my best and put
hi arm about the great man middl he hug him affection
look look cri martin the gate is down now first shot to you
and he step to on side
as he spoke the oaken door burst open and the spanish soldier began
to stream through them suddenli foi nerv return to him and he grew
steadi as a rock lift hi crossbow he aim and pull the trigger
the string twang the quarrel rush forth with a whistl sound
and the first soldier pierc through breastplat and through breast
sprang into the air and fell forward foi step to on side to string
hi bow
good shot said martin take hi place while from the spectat in
the window went up a sudden shout martin fire and anoth man fell
then foi fire again and miss but martin next bolt struck the last
soldier through the arm and pin him to the timber of the broken gate
after thi thei could shoot no more for the spaniard were beneath
them
to the doorwai said martin and rememb what i told you awai with
the bow cold steel must do the rest
now thei stood by the open door martin a helmet from the wall upon
hi head ti beneath hi chin with a piec of rope becaus it wa too
small for him the great sword silenc lift readi to strike and
foi behind grip the long pike with both hand below them from the
gather mob of soldier came a confus clamour then a voic call
out an order and thei heard footstep on the stair
look out thei ar come said martin turn hi head so that foi
caught sight of hi face it wa transfigur it wa terribl the
great red beard seem to bristl the pale blue unshad ey roll
and glitter thei glitter like the blue steel of the sword silenc
that waver abov them in that dread instant of expect foi
rememb hi vision of the morn lo it wa fulfil for befor
him stood martin the peac patient giant transform into a red
vengeanc
a man reach the head of the ladder step upon on of the loos
cannonbal and fell with an oath and a crash but behind him came
other suddenli thei turn the corner suddenli thei burst into view
three or four of them togeth gallantli thei rush on the first of
them caught hi feet in the trap of the door and fell headlong across
it of him martin took no heed but foi did for befor ever the soldier
could rise he had driven hi pike down between the man shoulder so
that he di there upon the door at the next martin struck and foi
saw thi on suddenli grow small and doubl up which if he had found
leisur to examin the natur of that wound would have surpris him
veri littl anoth man follow so quickli that martin could not lift
the sword to meet him but he point with it and next instant wa
shake hi carcas off it blade
after thi foi could keep no count martin slash with the sword and
when he found a chanc foi thrust with the pike till at length there
were none to thrust at for thi wa more than the spaniard had
bargain two of them lai dead in the doorwai and other had been
drag or had tumbl down the ladder while from the onlook at the
window without as thei caught sight of them be brought forth slain
or sore wound went up shout upon shout of joi
so far we have done veri well said martin quietli but if thei come
up again we must be cooler and not wast our strength so much had i
not struck so hard i might have kill anoth man
but the spaniard show no sign of come up ani more thei had seen
enough of that narrow wai and of the red swordsman who await them in
the doorwai round the corner inde it wa a bad place for attack
sinc thei could not shoot with arquebus or arrow but must pass in
to be slaughter like sheep at the shambl in the dim room beyond so
be cautiou men who love their live thei took a safer counsel
the tank beneath the shottow when it wa not in us wa close
with a stone cover and around thi thei pile firewood and peat from
a stack in the corner of the yard and stand in the centr out of the
reach of arrow set light to it martin lai down watch them through
a crack in the floor then he sign to foi and whisper and go
to the iron bath foi drew from them two larg bucket of molten lead
each as much as a man could carri again martin look through the
crack wait till sever of the burner were gather beneath then
with a swift motion he lift up the trapdoor and as those below
stare upward wonder full into their face came the bucket of
molten lead down went two of them never to speak more while other ran
out shriek and aflam tear at their hair and garment
after thi the spaniard grew more wari and built their fire round
the oak pier till the flame eat up them fire the build and the
room abov grew full of littl curl wreath of smoke
now we must choos said martin whether we will be roast like
fowl in an oven or go down and have our throat cut like pig in the
open
for my part i prefer to die in the air cough foi
so sai i master listen we cant get down the stair for thei ar
watch for us there so we must drop from the trapdoor and charg
through the fire then if we ar lucki back to back and fight it out
half a minut later two men bear nake sword in their hand might be
seen burst through the barrier of flame wood out thei came safe
enough and there in an open space not far from the gatewai halt
back to back rub the water from their smart ey on them a
few second later like hound on a wound boar dash the mob of
soldier while from everi throat of the hundr who were watch went
up shrill cri of encourag grief and fear men fell befor them
but other rush in thei were down thei were up again onc more thei
were down and thi time onli on of them rose the great man martin he
stagger to hi feet shake off the soldier who tri to hold him
as a dog in the gamepit shake off rat he wa up he stood across
the bodi of hi companion and onc more that fear sword wa sweep
round bring death to all it touch thei drew back but a soldier
old in war creep behind him suddenli threw a cloak over hi head
then the end came and slowli veri slowli thei overmatch hi
strength and bore him down and bound him while the watch mob
groan and wept with grief

henc quit free and unharm and he paus
how can we after we have been condemn to death ask foi

inquisitorwho for all hi soft word is a cruel man inde wa in

thing to do well a judg can acquit as well as condemn and thi
onei no except what is there to prevent me fill thi paper in
with an order for your releas

doubtless said foi angrili upon such honour as gentlemen learn in
the gallei senor ramiroi beg your pardon count juan de montalvo
ramiro face grew crimson to the hair
sir he said were i a differ sort of man for those word you
should die in a fashion from which even the boldest might shrink but
you ar young and inexperienc so i will overlook them now thi
bargain must come to a head which will you have life and safeti or
the chancewhich under the circumst is no chanc at allthat on
dai not you of cours but somebodi interest in it mai recov a
hoard of monei and jewel
then martin spoke for the first time veri slowli and respectfulli
worship sir he said we cannot tell you where the monei is
becaus we do not know to be frank with you nobodi ever knew except
myself i took the stuff and sank it in the water in a narrow channel
between two island and i made a littl draw of them on a piec of
paper
exactli my good friend and where is that piec of paper
ala sir when i wa light the fuse on board the swallow i let
it fall in my hast and it isin exactli the same place as ar all
your worship worthi comrad who were on board that ship i believ
howev that if you will put yourself under my guidanc i could show
your excel the spot and thi as i do not want to be kill i
should be most happi to do
good simpl man said ramiro with a littl laugh how charm is
the prospect that you paint of a midnight row with you upon those lone
water the tarantula and the butterfli arm in arm mynheer van goorl
what have you to sai
onli that the stori told by martin here is true i do not know where
the monei is as i wa not present at it sink and the paper ha
been lost
inde i am afraid then that it will be necessari for me to refresh
your memori but first i have on more argument or rather two ha
it struck you that anoth life mai hang upon your answer as a rule men
ar loth to send their father to death
foi heard and terribl as wa the hint yet it came to him as a relief
for he had fear lest he wa about to sai your mother or elsa
brant
that is my first argument a good on i think but i haveanoth
which mai appeal even more forcibl to a young man and prospect heir
the dai befor yesterdai you becam engag to elsa brantdont look
surpris peopl in my posit have long ear and you neednt
be frighten the young ladi will not be brought here she is too
valuabl
be so good as to speak plainli said foi
with pleasur you see thi girl is the heiress is she not and
whether or no i find out the fact from you sooner or later in thi
wai or that she will doubtless discov where her heritag is hidden
well that fortun a husband would have the advantag of share i
myself labour at present under no matrimoni engag and am in a
posit to obtain an introductionah my friend ar you begin to
see that there ar more wai of kill a dog than by hang him
weak and wound as he wa foi heart sank in him at the word of thi
man thi devil who had betrai hi mother with a mock marriag and
who wa the father of adrian the idea of make the heiress hi wife
wa on worthi of hi evil ingenu and why should he not put it into
practic elsa of cours would rebel but alva offici in such
dai had mean of overcom ani maidenli reluct or at least of
forc women to choos between death and degrad wa it not common
for them even to dissolv marriag in order to give heret to new
husband who desir their wealth there wa no justic left in the
land human be were the chattel and slave of their oppressor oh
god what wa there to do except to trust in god why should thei
be tortur murder marri against their will for the sake of a
miser pile of pelf why not tell the truth and let the fellow take
the monei he had measur up hi man and believ that he could drive
a bargain with him ramiro want monei not live he wa no fanat
horror gave him no pleasur he care noth about hi victim soul
as he had betrai hi mother lysbeth for cash so he would be will
to let them all go for cash why not make the exchang
then distinct formid overwhelm the answer rose up in foi
mind becaus he had sworn to hi father that noth which could be
imagin should induc him to reveal thi secret and betrai thi trust
and not onli to hi father to hendrik brant also who alreadi had given
hi own life to keep hi treasur out of the hand of the spaniard
believ that in some unforeseen wai it would advantag hi own land
and countrymen no great as wa the temptat he must keep the letter
of hi bond and pai it dread price so again foi answer
it is useless to try to bribe me for i do not know where the monei
is
veri well heer foi van goorl now we have a plain issu befor us
but i will still try to protect you against yourselfth warrant shall
remain blank for a littl while
then he call aloud sergeant ask the professor baptist to be so
good as to step thi wai

whose offic it wa to let peopl in and out upon their law busi
make pretenc to shift foi in hi arm martin scan thi wicket as
narrowli as time would allow and observ that it seem to be secur
by mean of iron bolt at the top and the bottom but that it wa
not lock sinc the socket into which the tongu went wa empti
doubtless while he wa on guard there the porter did not think it
necessari to go to the pain of us the great kei that hung at hi
girdl
the sergeant in charg of the victim open a low and massiv door
which wa almost exactli opposit to that of the courtroom by shoot
back a bolt and push it ajar evid the place beyond at some time
or other had been us as a prison which account for the bolt on
the outsid a few second later and thei were lock into the
torturechamb of the gevangenhui which wa noth more than a
goodsiz vault like that of a cellar lit with lamp for no light
of dai wa suffer to enter here and by a horrid littl fire that
flicker on the floor the furnitur of the place mai be guess
at those that ar curiou about such thing can satisfi themselv by
examin the mediaev prison at the hagu and elsewher let us pass
them over as unfit even for descript although these terror of
which we scarc like to speak todai were veri familiar to the sight
of our ancestor of but three centuri ago
martin sat foi down upon some terribl engin that roughli resembl
a chair and onc more let hi blue ey wander about him amongst the
variou implement wa on lean against the wall not veri far
from the door which excit hi especi interest it wa made for a
dread purpos but martin reflect onli that it seem to be a stout
bar of iron exactli suit to the break of anybodi head
come sneer the professor undress that big gentleman while i make
readi hi littl bed
so the soldier strip martin nor did thei assault him with sneer
and insult for thei rememb the man deed of yesterdai and
admir hi strength and endur and the huge muscular frame beneath
their hand
now he is readi if you ar said the sergeant
the professor rub hi hand

then martin nerv gave wai and he began to shiver and to shake
oho laugh the professor even in thi stuffi place he is cold
without hi cloth well we must warm himw must warm him
who would have thought that a big fellow who can fight well too
wa such a coward at heart said the sergeant of the guard to hi
companion after all he will give no more plai than a rhine salmon
martin heard the word and wa seiz with such an intens access of
fear that he burst into a sweat all over hi bodi
i cant bear it he said cover hi eyeswhich howev he did

then he walk to the door and began to unlock it as he went strike
martin in the face with the back of hi hand and sai
take that cur whereat as foi observ the cow prison perspir
more profus than befor and shrank awai toward the wall
god in heaven what had happen the door of the tortur den wa

a movement more quick than he could follow someth flew up and fell
with a fear thud upon the execution in the doorwai the guard

the differ for let the soldier on the further side strive as thei
might slowli veri slowli the thick door quiver to it frame martin
glanc at the bolt for he could not speak and with hi left hand foi
slowli work it forward it wa stiff with disus it caught upon the
edg of the socket
closer he gasp
martin made an effort so fierc that it wa hideou to behold for
beneath the pressur the blood trickl from hi nostril but the door
went in the sixteenth of an inch and the rusti bolt creak home into
it stone notch
martin step back and for a moment stood swai like a man about to
fall then recov himself he leapt at the sword silenc which hung
upon the wall and pass it thong over hi right wrist next he turn
toward the door of the courtroom
where ar you go ask foi

beyond the courtroom where he had been write to find the professor
and the porter dead in the passag and the yell guard lock in hi
own torturechamb why then those sentri declar that thei had
seen noth at all of prison cloth or nake
for a while he believ them and mighti wa the hunt from the
clocktow of the gevangenhui down to the lowest stone of it cellar
ye and even in the water of the moat but when the governor found out
the truth it went veri ill with those soldier and still wors with the
guard from whom martin had escap in the tortureroom like an eel out
of the hand of a fishwif for by thi time ramiro temper wa rous
and he began to think that he had done ill to return to leyden
but he had still a card to plai in a certain room in the gevangenhui
sat anoth victim compar to the dread den where foi and martin
had been confin thi wa quit a pleasant chamber upon the first
floor be reserv inde for polit prison of rank or
offic captur upon the field who were held to ransom thu it had
a real window secur howev by a doubl set of iron bar which
overlook the littl inner courtyard and the gaol kitchen also it wa
furnish after a fashion and wa more or less clean thi prison
wa none other than dirk van goorl who had been neatli captur as he
return toward hi hous after make certain arrang for the
flight of hi famili and hurri awai to the gaol on that morn dirk
also had been put upon hi trial befor the squeakyvo and agit
extailor he also had been condemn to death the method of hi
end as in the case of foi and martin be left in the hand of the
governor then thei led him back to hi room and shot the bolt upon
him there
some hour later a man enter hi cell to the door of which he wa
escort by soldier bring him food and drink he wa on of the
cook and as it chanc a talk fellow
what pass in thi prison friend ask dirk look up that i see
peopl run to and fro across the courtyard and hear trampl and

free without wait for ani princ of orang magician thei must
bemagician and noth less
dirk interest wa excit put hi hand into hi pocket he drew
out a gold piec which he gave to the man
friend he said you cook my food do you not and look after me
well i have a few of these about me and if you prove kind thei mai as
well find their wai into your pocket as into those of your better do
you understand
the man nod took the monei and thank him
now went on dirk while you clean the room tell me about thi
escap for small thing amus those who hear no tide
well mynheer answer the man thi is the tale of it so far as i
can gather yesterdai thei captur two fellow heret i suppos who
made a good fight and did them much damag in a warehous i dont know
their name for i am a stranger to thi town but i saw them brought
in a young fellow who seem to be wound in the leg and neck and
a great redbeard giant of a man thei were put upon their trial thi
morn and afterward sent across the two of them togeth with
eight men to guard them to call upon the professory understand
dirk nod for thi professor wa well known in leyden and then he
ask
and then why mother in heaven thei came out that allth big
man strip and carri the other on hi back ye thei kill the
professor with the brand iron and out thei camelik ripe pea from
a pod
imposs said dirk
veri well perhap you know better than i do perhap it is imposs
also that thei should have push the door to let all those spanish
cock insid do what thei might and bolt them in perhap it is
imposs that thei should have spit the porter and got clean awai
through the outsid guard the big on still carri the other upon
hi back perhap all these thing ar imposs but theyr true
nevertheless and if you dont believ me after thei get awai from the
whippingpost just ask the bridg guard why thei ran so fast when thei
saw that great nake blueei fellow come at them roar like a
lion with hi big sword flash abov hi head oh there a pretti
todo i can tell you a pretti todo and in meal or malt we shall
all pai the price of it from the governor down inde some back ar
pai it now
but friend were thei not taken outsid the gaol
taken who wa to take them when the rascal mob made them an escort
five hundr strong as thei went down the street no thei ar far awai
from leyden now you mai swear to that i must be go but if there
is anyth youd like while your here just tell me and as you ar so
liber ill try and see that you get what you want
as the bolt were shot home behind the man dirk clasp hi hand and
almost laugh aloud with joi so martin wa free and foi wa free
and until thei could be taken again the secret of the treasur remain
safe montalvo would never have it of that he wa sure and as for hi
own fate well he care littl about it especi as the inquisitor
had decre that be a man of so much import he wa not to be
put to the question thi order howev wa prompt not by merci
but by discret sinc the fellow knew that like other of the holland
town leyden wa on the verg of open revolt and fear lest should
it leak out that on of the wealthiest and most respect of it
burgher wa actual be torment for hi faith sake the populac
might step over the boundari line
when adrian had seen the wound spanish soldier and their bearer
torn to piec by the rabbl and had heard the great door of the
gevangenhui close upon foi and martin he turn to go home with hi
evil new but for a long while the mob would not go home and had it
not been that the drawbridg over the moat in front of the prison wa
up and that thei had no mean of cross it probabl thei would have
attack the build then and there present howev rain began to
fall and thei melt awai wonder not too happili whether in
that time of daili slaughter the duke of alva would think a few common
soldier worth while make a stir about
adrian enter the upper room to tell hi tide sinc thei must
be told and found it occupi by hi mother alon she wa sit
straight upright in her chair her hand rest upon her knee stare
out of the window with a face like marbl
i cannot find him he began but foi and martin ar taken after a
great fight in which foi wa wound thei ar in the gevangenhui
i know all interrupt lysbeth in a cold heavi voic my husband is
taken also someon must have betrai them mai god reward him leav
me adrian
then adrian turn and crept awai to hi own chamber hi heart so full
of remors and shame that at time he thought that it must burst weak
as he wa wick as he wa he had never intend thi but now oh
heaven hi brother foi and the man who had been hi benefactor whom
hi mother love more than her life were through him given over to a
death wors than the mind could conceiv somehow that night wore awai
and of thi we mai be sure that it did not go half as heavili with
the victim in their dungeon as with the betray in hi free comfort
thrice dure it dark hour inde adrian wa on the point of
destroi himself onc even he set the hilt of hi sword upon the
floor and it edg against hi breast and then at the prick of steel
shrank back
better would it have been for him perhap could he have kept hi
courag at least he would have been spare much ad shame and miseri
so soon as adrian had left her lysbeth rose robe herself and took her
wai to the hous of her cousin van de werff now a success citizen
of middl ag and the burgomasterelect of leyden
you have heard the new she said
ala cousin i have he answer and it is veri terribl is it
true that thi treasur of hendrik brant is at the bottom of it all
she nod and answer i believ so
then could thei not bargain for their live by surrend it
secret
perhap that is foi and martin mightdirk doe not know it
whereaboutsh refus to know but thei have sworn that thei will die
first
why cousin
becaus thei promis as much to hendrik brant who believ that
if hi gold could be kept from the spaniard it would do some mighti
servic to hi countri in time to come and who ha persuad them all
that is so
then god grant it mai be true said van de werff with a sigh for
otherwis it is sad to think that more live should be sacrif for
the sake of a heap of pelf
i know it cousin but i come to you to save those live
how
how she answer fierc why by rais the town by attack
the gevangenhui and rescu them by drive the spaniard out of
leyden
and therebi bring upon ourselv the fate of mon would you see
thi place also given over to sack by the soldier of noircarm and don
freder
i care not what i see so long as i save my son and my husband she
answer desper
there speak the woman not the patriot it is better that three men
should die than a whole citi full
that is a strang argument to find in your mouth cousin the argument
of caiapha the jew
nai lysbeth be not wroth with me for what can i sai the spanish
troop in leyden ar not mani it is true but more have been sent for
from haarlem and elsewher after the troubl of yesterdai aris
out of the captur of foi and martin and in fortyeight hour at the
longest thei will be here thi town is not provis for a sieg
it citizen ar not train to arm and we have littl powder store
moreov the citi council is divid for the kill of the spanish
soldier we mai compound but if we attack the gevangenhui that is
open rebellion and we shall bring the armi of don freder down upon
us
what matter cousin it will come sooner or later
then let it come later when we ar more prepar to beat it off oh
do not reproach me for i can bear it ill i who am work dai and
night to make readi for the hour of trial i love your husband and your
son my heart bleed for your sorrow and their doom but at present
i can do noth noth you must bear your burden thei must bear
their i must bear mine we must all wander through the night not
know where we wander till god caus the dawn to break the dawn of
freedom and retribut
lysbeth made no answer onli she rose and stumbl from the hous while
van de werff sat down groan bitterli and prai for help and light
chapter xxii
a meet and a part
lysbeth did not sleep that night for even if her miseri would have let
her sleep she could not becaus of the physic fire that burnt in her
vein and the strang pang of agoni which pierc her head at first
she thought littl of them but when at last the cold light of the
autumn morn dawn she went to a mirror and examin herself and
there upon her neck she found a hard red swell of the size of a nut
then lysbeth knew that she had caught the plagu from the vrouw jansen
and laugh aloud a dreari littl laugh sinc if all she love were
to die it seem to her good that she should die also elsa wa ab
prostrat with grief and shut herself in her room lysbeth
suffer none to come near her except on woman who she knew had
recov from the plagu in past year but even to her she said
noth of her sick
about eleven oclock in the morn thi woman rush into her chamber
cry thei have escap thei have escap

van goorl would save the life of the man who is dearest to her she is
prai to veil herself and follow the bearer of thi letter for her own
safeti she need have no fear it is assur herebi
lysbeth thought awhil thi might be a trick veri probabl it wa
a trick to take her well if so what did it matter sinc she would
rather die with her husband than live on without him moreov why
should she turn asid from death she in whose vein the plagu wa
burn but there wa anoth thing wors than that she could guess
who had pen thi letter it even seem to her after all these mani
year that she recognis the write disguis though it wa could
she face him well why notfor dirk sake
and if she refus and dirk wa done to death would she not reproach
herself if she live to rememb it becaus she had left a stone
unturn
give me my cloak and veil she said to the woman and now go tell the
man that i am come
at the door she found the soldier who salut her and said
respectfulli follow me ladi but at a littl distanc
so thei start and through side street lysbeth wa led to a back
entranc of the gevangenhui which open and close behind her
mysteri leav her wonder whether she would ever pass that
gate again within a man wa waitingsh did not even notic what kind
of manwho also said follow me ladi and led her through gloomi
passag and variou door into a littl empti chamber furnish with a
tabl and two chair present the door open and shut then her whole
be shrank and sicken as though beneath the breath of poison for
there befor her still the same still handsom although so mar by
time and scar and evil stood the man who had been her husband juan
de montalvo but whatev she felt lysbeth show noth of it in her
face which remain white and stern moreov even befor she look
at him she wa awar that he fear her more than she fear him
it wa true for from thi woman ey went out a sword of terror that
seem to pierc montalvo heart back flew hi mind to the scene of
their betroth and the aw word that she had spoken then reecho
in hi ear how strang thing had come round for on that dai as
on thi the stake at issu wa the life of dirk van goorl in the old
time she had bought it pai as it price herself her fortun and
worst of all to a woman her lover scorn and wonder what would she
be prepar to pai now well fortun he need ask but littl of
her and yet hi soul mistrust him of these bargain with lysbeth
van hout for the life of dirk van goorl the first had end ill with a
sentenc of fourteen year in the gallei most of which he had serv

by wai of answer there seem to rise befor the ey of montalvo mind
a measureless black gulf and fall fall fall through it
infinit depth on miser figur a mere tini point that serv to

face as in a crystalit wa hi own
thi unpleas nightmar of the imagin came in an instant and in
an instant pass the next montalvo courteou and compos wa bow
befor hi visitor and prai her to be seat

lysbeth made no answer onli her mouth grew a trifl more stern
now on word more and i will come to the point let me congratul
you upon the gallant deed of a gallant son of cours hi courag and
dexter with that of the red giant martin have told against myself
have in short lost me a trick in the game but i am an old soldier
and i can assur you that the detail of their fight yesterdai at
the factori and of their marvel escap fromfromwel pain
surround thi morn have stir my blood and made my heart beat
fast
i have heard the tale do not troubl to repeat it said lysbeth it
is onli what i expect of them but i thank god that it ha pleas him
to let them live on so that in due cours thei mai fearfulli aveng a
belov father and master
montalvo cough and turn hi head with the idea of avoid that
ghastli nightmar of a piti littl man fall down a fathomless gulf
which had sprung up suddenli in hi mind again
well he went on a truce to compliment thei escap and i am
glad of it whatev murder thei mai contempl in the futur ye
notwithstand their great crime and manslai in the past i am
glad that thei escap although it wa my duti to keep them while i
couldand if i should catch them it will be my dutybut i neednt talk
of that to you of cours howev you know there is on gentleman who
wa not quit so fortun
my husband
ye your worthi husband who happili for my reput as captain of
on of hi majesti prison occupi an upstair room
what of him ask lysbeth
dear ladi dont be over anxiou there is noth so wear as
anxieti i wa come to the matter then with a sudden chang of
manner he ad it is need lysbeth that i should set out the
situat
what situat do you mean
well princip that of the treasur
what treasur
oh woman do not wast time in try to fool me the treasur the
vast the incalcul treasur of hendrik brant which foi van goorl
and martin who have escapedand he ground hi teeth togeth at the
anguish of the thoughtdispos of somewher in the haarlem meer
well what about thi treasur
i want it that is all
then you had best go to seek it
that is my intent and i shall begin the searchin the heart of
dirk van goorl he ad slowli crush the handkerchief he held with
hi long finger as though it were a live thing that could be choke
to death
lysbeth never stir she had expect thi
you will find it a poor mine to dig in she said for he know
noth of the whereabout of thi monei nobodi know anyth of it
now martin hid it as i understand and lost the paper so it will lie
there till the haarlem meer is drain
dear me do you know i have heard that stori befor ye from the
excel martin himselfand do you know i dont quit believ it
i cannot help what you believ or do not believ you mai rememb that
it wa alwai my habit to speak the truth
quit so but other mai be less conscienti see here and draw
a paper from hi doublet he held it befor her it wa noth less
than the deathwarr of dirk van goorl sign by the inquisitor duli
authoris thereto
mechan she read it and understood
you will observ he went on that the method of the crimin
execut is left to the good wisdom of our wellbelovedetc in plain
languag to me now might i troubl you so far as to look out of thi
littl window what do you see in front of you a kitchen quit so
alwai a home and pleasant sight in the ey of an excel housewif
like yourself anddo you mind bend forward a littl what do you
see up there a small bar window well let us suppos for the sake
of argument that a hungri man a man who grow hungrier and hungrier
sat behind that window watch the cook at their work and see the
meat carri into thi kitchen to come out an hour or two later as hot
steam savouri joint while he wast wast wast and starv
starv starv dont you think my dear ladi that thi would be a
veri unpleas experi for that man
ar you a devil gasp lysbeth spring back
i have never regard myself as such but if you seek a definit
i should sai that i am a hardwork necessit and somewhat
unfortun gentleman who ha been driven to rough method in order to
secur a comfort old ag i can assur you that i do not wish to
starv anybodi i wish onli to find hendrik brant treasur and if
your worthi husband wont tell me where it is why i must make him that
is all in six or eight dai under my treatment i am convinc that
he will becom quit fluent on the subject for there is noth that
should caus a fat burgher accustom to good live to open hi heart
more than a total lack of the victual which he can see and smell did
you ever hear the stori of an ancient gentleman call tantalu these
old fabl have a wonder wai of adapt themselv to the need and
circumst of us modern havent thei
then lysbeth pride broke down and in the abandon of her despair
fling herself upon her knee befor thi monster she beg for her
husband life beg in the name of god ye and even in the name
of montalvo son adrian so low had her miseri brought her that she
plead with the man by the son of shame whom she had born to him
he prai her to rise i want to save your husband life he said i
give you my word that if onli he will tell me what i desir to know i
will save it ye although the risk is great i will even manag hi
escap and i shall ask you to go upstair present and explain my
amiabl intent to him then he thought a moment and ad but
you mention on adrian prai do you mean the gentleman whose signatur
appear here and he hand her anoth document sai read it
quietli there is no hurri the good dirk is not starv yet i am
inform inde that he ha just made an excel breakfastnot hi
last by mani thousand let us hope
lysbeth took the sheet and glanc at them then her intellig
awok and she read on fierc until her ey came to the wellknown
signatur at the foot of the last page she cast the roll down with a
cry as though a serpent had sprung from it page and bitten her
i fear that you ar pain said montalvo sympathet and no
wonder for myself i have gone through such disillusion and know
how thei wound a gener natur that why i show you thi document
becaus i also am gener and wish to warn you against thi young
gentleman who i understand you alleg is my son you see the person
who would betrai hi brother might even go a step further and betrai hi
mother so if you take my advic you will keep an ey upon the young
man also i am bound to remind you that it is more or less your
own fault it is a most unlucki thing to curs a child befor it is
bornyou rememb the incid that curs ha come home to roost with
a vengeanc what a warn against give wai to the passion of the
moment
lysbeth heed him no longer she wa think as she had never thought
befor at that moment as though by an inspir there float into
her mind the word of the dead vrouw jansen the plagu i wish that i
had caught it befor for then i would have taken it to him in prison
and thei couldnt have treat him as thei did dirk wa in prison and
dirk wa to be starv to death for whatev montalvo might think he
did not know the secret and therefor could not tell it and shesh
had the plagu on her she knew it symptom well and it poison wa
burn in her everi vein although she still could think and speak and
walk
well why not it would be no crime inde if it wa a crime she
care littl it would be better that he should die of the plagu in
five dai or perhap in two if it work quickli as it often did with
the fullblood than that he should linger on starv for twelv or
more and perhap be torment besid
swiftli veri swiftli lysbeth came to her dread decis then she
spoke in a hoars voic
what do you wish me to do
i wish you to reason with your husband and to persuad him to
ceas from hi obstinaci and to surrend to me the secret of the
hidingplac of brant hoard in that event so soon as i have prove
the truth of what he tell me i undertak that he shall be set at
liberti unharm and that meanwhil he shall be well treat
and if i will not or he will not or cannot
then i have told you the altern and to show you that i am not
joke i will now write and sign the order then if you declin thi
mission or if it is fruitless i will hand it to the offic befor
your eyesand within the next ten dai or so let you know the result
or wit them if you wish
i will go she said but i must see him alon
it is unusu he answer but provid you satisfi me that you
carri no weapon i do not know that i need object
so when montalvo had written hi order and scatter dust on it from
the pouncebox for he wa a man of neat and method habit he
himself with everi possibl courtesi conduct lysbeth to her husband
prison have usher her into it with a cheer friend van goorl i
bring you a visitor he lock the door upon them and patient wait
outsid
it matter not what pass within whether lysbeth told her husband
of her dread yet sacr purpos or did not tell him whether he ever
learn of the perfidi of adrian or did not learn it what were their
part wordstheir part prayer all these thing matter not
inde the last ar too holi to be written let us bow our head and
pass them by in silenc and let the reader imagin them as he will
grow impati at length montalvo unlock the prison door and
open it to discov lysbeth and her husband kneel side by side in
the centr of the room like the figur on some ancient marbl monument
thei heard him and rose then dirk fold hi wife in hi arm in a
long last embrac and loos her held on hand abov her head in
bless as with the other he point to the door
so infinit pathet wa thi dumb show of farewel for no word
pass between them while he wa present that not onli hi barb
gibe but the question that he meant to ask di upon the lip of
montalvo try as he might he could not speak them here
come he said and lysbeth pass out
at the door she turn to look and there in the centr of the room
still stood her husband tear stream from hi ey down a face
radiant with an unearthli smile and hi right hand lift toward the
heaven and so she left him
present montalvo and lysbeth were togeth again in the littl room
i fear he said from what i saw just now that your mission ha

montalvo shine through hi flesh like some bale marshlight
through the mist it wa a thing which god had forgotten a thing that
had burst the kindli mould of it human and wrapt itself in the robe
and mask of such a wolf as might raven about the cliff of hell onli
there wa fear on the face of the wolf that inhuman face which thi

he wa no son of hi but the child of some rival he would sit there
in hi prison cell and while hi face fell in and hi bone grew daili
plainer till at length hi portli presenc wa as that of a live
skeleton he would sit there by the window watch the dish of
savouri food pass in and out beneath him and between the pang of hi
longdrawn hideou agoni put up hi prayer to god to pai back to him

customari with him when address hi inferior even then he notic
with the indign of on who dwell upon hi digniti that thi
server made him no bow but mere call hi order to someon in the
hous and turn hi back upon him began to speak to a man who wa
loiter near soon adrian becam awar that he wa the subject of that
convers for the two of them look at him out of the corner of
their ey and jerk their thumb toward him moreov first on
then two then quit a number of passersbi stop and join in the
convers which appear to interest them veri much boi came also
a dozen or more of them and women of the fishwif stamp and all of
these look at him out of the corner of their ey and from time to
time jerk their thumb toward him adrian began to feel uneasi and
anger but draw down hi bonnet and fold hi arm upon hi
breast he took no notic present the server thrust hi meal and
flagon of beer befor him with such clatter clumsi that some of
the liquor splash over upon the tabl

now adrian wa mind to be gone but he wa hungri and thirsti so
first thought he he would satisfi himself accordingli he lift the
tankard and took a long pull at it when suddenli someth struck the
bottom of the vessel jerk liquor over hi face and doublet he set
it down with an oath and lai hi hand upon hi sword hilt ask who
had done thi but the mob which by now number fifti or sixti and
wa gather about him in a tripl circl made no answer thei stood

now adrian understood all these peopl knew of hi infami the whole of
leyden knew that tale hi lip turn dry and the sweat broke out upon
hi bodi what should he do brave it out he sat down and the fierc
ring of silent face drew a pace or two nearer he tri to bid the man
to bring more meat but the word stuck in hi throat now the mob saw
hi fear and of a sudden seem to augur hi guilt from it and to pass
sentenc on him in their heart at least thei who had been so dumb

could not bear it he drew hi sword and turn to fly
stop him yell the mob whereon he lung at them wildli run a
small boi through the arm
the sight of blood and the screech of the wound lad settl the
question and those who were foremost came at him with a spring but
adrian wa swifter than thei and befor a hand could be laid upon him
amidst a shower of stone and filth he wa speed down the street
after him came the mob and then began on of the finest manhunt ever
known in leyden
from on street to anoth round thi turn and round that sped the
quarri and after him a swiftli grow pack came the hound some
women drew a washinglin across the street to trip him adrian jump
it like a deer four men got ahead and tri to cut him off he dodg
them down the bree straat he went and on hi mother door he saw a
paper and guess what wa written there thei were gain thei were

there wa but on chanc for him now near by ran the rhine and here
it wa wide and unbridg perhap thei would not follow him through the
water in he went have no choic and swam for hi life thei threw
stone and bit of wood at him and call for bow but luckili for
him by now the night wa fall fast so that soon he vanish from
their sight and heard them cry to each other that he wa drown
but adrian wa not drown for at that moment he wa drag himself
painfulli through the deep greasi mud of the oppos bank and hide
among the old boat and lumber which were pile there till hi breath
came to him again but he could not stai long for even if he had not
been afraid that thei would come and find him it wa too cold so he
crept awai into the dark

that there wa someth left in which he could take pleasur even if
it were but eat and drink when he had finish he told hi
stori or so much of it as he wish to tell and afterward went to bed
wonder whether hi host would murder him in hi sleep for the purs
of gold he carri half hope that thei might inde and slept for
twelv hour without stir
all that dai and until the even of the next adrian sat in the home
of hi spy host recov hi strength and brood over hi fear
fall black meg brought in new of what pass without thu he learn
that hi mother had sicken with the plagu and that the sentenc of
starvat wa be carri out upon the bodi of her husband dirk
van goorl he learn also the detail of the escap of foi and martin
which were the talk of all the citi in the ey of the common peopl
thei had becom hero and some local poet had made a song about them
which men were sing in the street two vers of that song were
devot to him adrian inde black meg repeat them to him word
by word with a suppress but malign joi ye thi wa what had
happen hi brother had becom a popular hero and he adrian who
in everi wai wa so infinit that brother superior an object of
popular execr and of all thi the man ramiro wa the caus
well he wa wait for ramiro that wa why he risk hi life by
stai in leyden sooner or later ramiro would be bound to visit thi
haunt of hi and thenher adrian drew hi rapier and lung and
parri and final with hiss breath drove it down into the wood of
the floor pictur in a kind of luxuri of the imagin that
the throat of ramiro wa between it point and the ground of cours
in the struggl that must come the said ramiro who doubtless wa a
skil swordsman might get the upper hand it might be hi adrian
throat which wa between the point and the ground well if so it
scarc matter he did not care at ani rate for thi onc he would
plai the man and then let the devil take hi own himself or ramiro or
both of them
on the afternoon of the second dai adrian heard shout in the street
and hagu simon came in and told him that a man had arriv with bad
new from mechlin what it wa he could not sai he wa go to find
out a coupl of hour went by and there wa more shout thi time
of a determin and order natur then black meg appear and inform
him that the new from mechlin wa that everyon in that unhappi town
had been slain by the spaniard that further the peopl of leyden had
risen and were march to attack the gevangenhui out she hurri
again for when the water were stormi then black meg must go afish
anoth hour went by and onc more the street door wa open with a
kei to be carefulli shut when the visitor had enter
simon or meg thought adrian but as he could not be sure he took the
precaut of hide himself behind the curtain the door of the room
open and not meg or simon but ramiro enter so hi opportun had
come
the master seem disturb he sat down upon a chair and wipe hi brow
with a silk handkerchief then aloud and shake hi fist in the air
he utter a most comprehens curs upon everybodi and everyth but
especi upon the citizen of leyden after thi onc more he laps
into silenc sit hi on ey fix upon vacanc and twist hi
wax moustach with hi hand
now wa adrian chanc he had onli to step out from behind the curtain
and run him through befor he could rise from hi seat the plan had
great charm and doubtless he might have put it into execut had not
adrian histrion instinct stai hi hand if he kill ramiro thu
he would never know why he had been kill and abov all thing adrian
desir that he should know he want not onli to wreak hi wrong
but to let hi adversari learn why thei were wreak also to do him
justic he prefer a fair fight to a secret stab deliv from
behind for gentlemen fought but assassin stab
still as there were no wit he might have been will to waiv
thi point if onli he could make sure that ramiro should learn the
truth befor he di he thought of spring out and wound him and
then after he had explain matter finish him off at hi leisur
but how could he be sure of hi swordthrust which might do too much
or too littl no come what would the matter must be conclud in the
proper fashion
choos hi opportun adrian step from behind the hang and
place himself between ramiro and the door the bolt of which he shot
adroitli that no on might interrupt their interview at the sound
ramiro start and look up in an instant he grasp the situat
and though hi bronz face pale for he knew that hi danger wa
great rose to it as might have been expect from a gentleman of hi
long and vari experi
the heer adrian call van goorl as i live he said my friend and
pupil i am glad to see you but if i might ask although the time ar
rough why in thi narrow room do you wave about a nake rapier in that
danger fashion
villain answer adrian you know why you have betrai me and
mine and i am dishonour and now i am go to kill you in payment
i see said ramiro the van goorl affair again i can never be clear
of it for half an hour even well befor you begin it mai interest you
to know that your worthi stepfath after a coupl of dai fast is
by now i suppos free for the rabbl have storm the gevangenhui
truth howev compel me to add that he is suffer badli from the
plagu which your excel mother with a resourc that doe
her credit manag to commun to him think thi end less
disagre on the whole than that which the law had appoint
thu spoke ramiro slowli and with purpos for all the while he wa
so manoeuvr that the light from the lattic fell full upon hi
antagonist leav himself in the shadow a posit which experi
taught him would prove of advantag in emerg
adrian made no answer but lift hi sword
on moment young gentleman went on ramiro draw hi own weapon
and put himself on guard ar you in earnest do you realli wish to
fight
ye answer adrian
what a fool you must be muse ramiro why at your ag should you
seek to be rid of life see that you have no more chanc against me
than a rat in a corner against a terrier dog look and suddenli he
lung most vicious straight at hi heart but adrian wa watch and
parri the thrust
ah continu ramiro i knew you would do that otherwis i should
not have let fly for all the angel know i do not wish to hurt you
but to himself he ad the lad is more danger than i thoughtmi
life hang on it the old fault friend too high too high
then adrian came at him like a tiger and for the next thirti second
noth wa heard in the room but the rasp of steel and the hard
breath of the two men
at first adrian had somewhat the better of it for hi assault wa
fierc and he forc the older and cooler man to be satisfi with
guard himself he did more inde for present thrust over
ramiro guard he wound him slightli in the left arm the sting
of hi hurt seem to stir ramiro blood at ani rate he chang
hi tactic and began to attack in turn now moreov hi skill and
season strength came to hi aid slowli but sure adrian wa driven
back befor him till hi retreat in the narrow confin of the room
becam continu suddenli half from exhaust and half becaus of a
stumbl he reel right across it to the further wall inde with a
guttur sound of triumph ramiro sprang after him to make an end of him
while hi guard wa down caught hi foot on a join stool which had
been overset in the struggl and fell prone to the ground
thi wa adrian chanc in an instant he wa on him and had the point
of hi rapier at hi throat but he did not stab at onc not from ani
compunct but becaus he wish hi enemi to feel a littl befor
he di for like all hi race adrian could be vindict and
bloodthirsti enough when hi hate wa rous rapidli ramiro consid
the posit in a physic sens he wa helpless for adrian had on
foot upon hi breast the other upon hi swordarm and the steel at hi
throat therefor if time were given him he must trust to hi wit
make readi you ar about to die said adrian
i think not repli the prostrat ramiro
why not ask adrian astonish
if you will be so kind as to move that swordpoint a littleit is
prick methank you now i will tell you why becaus it is not usual
for a son to stick hi father as though he were a farmyard pig
son father said adrian do you mean
ye i do mean that we have the happi of fill those sacr
relationship to each other
you lie said adrian
let me stand up and give me my sword young sir and you shall pai for
that never yet did a man tell the count juan de montalvo that he li
and live
prove it said adrian
in thi posit to which misfortun not skill ha reduc me i can
prove noth but if you doubt it ask your mother or your host or
consult the regist of the groot kerk and see whether on a date
which i will give you juan de montalvo wa or wa not marri to
lysbeth van hout of which marriag wa born on adrian man i will
prove it to you had i not been your father would you have been save
from the inquisit with other and should i not within the last five
minut had run you through twice over for though you fought well your
swordsmanship is no match for mine
even if you ar my father why should i not kill you who have forc
me to your will by threat of death you who wrong and shame me you
becaus of whom i have been hunt through the street like a mad dog
and made an outcast and adrian look so fierc and brought down hi
sword so close that hope sank veri low in ramiro heart
there ar reason which might occur to the religi he said but
i will give you on that will appeal to your own selfinterest if you
kill me the curs which follow the parricid will follow you to your
last hourof the beyond i sai noth
it would need to be a heavi on answer adrian if it wa wors
than that of which i know but there wa hesit in hi voic
for ramiro the skil player upon human heart had struck the right
string and adrian superstiti natur answer to the note
son went on ramiro be wise and hold your hand befor you do that
for which all hell itself would cry shame upon you you think that i
have been your enemi but it is not so all thi while i have striven
to work you good but how can i talk ly thu like a calf befor it
butcher take the sword both of them and let me sit up and i will
tell you all my plan for the advantag of us both or if you wish it
thrust on and make an end i will not plead for my life with you it is
not worthi of an hidalgo of spain moreov what is life to me who have
known so mani sorrow that i should seek to cling to it oh god
who seest all receiv my soul and i prai thee pardon thi youth hi
horribl crime for he is mad and foolish and will live to sorrow for
the deed
sinc it wa no further us to him ramiro had let the sword fall from
hi hand draw it toward him with the point of hi own weapon
adrian stoop and pick it up
rise he said lift hi foot i can kill you afterward if i
wish
could he have look into the heart of hi newfound parent as stiff and
ach he stagger to hi feet the execut would not have been long
delai
oh my young friend you have given me a nasti fright thought ramiro
to himself but it is over now and if i dont pai you out befor i
have done with you my sweet boi your name is not adrian
ramiro rose dust hi garment seat himself deliber and began
to talk with great earnest it will be suffici to summaris
hi argument first of all with the most convinc sincer he
explain that when he had made us of him adrian he had no idea that
he wa hi son of cours thi wa a statement that will not bear a
moment examin but ramiro object wa to gain time and adrian
let it pass then he explain that it wa onli after hi mother had
not by hi wish but accident seen the written evid upon which
her husband wa convict that he found out that adrian van goorl wa
her child and hi own howev as he hurri to point out all these
thing were now ancient histori that had no bear on the present
ow to the turbul violenc of the mob which had driven him from
hi post and fortress he ramiro wa in temporari difficulti and
ow to other circumst he adrian wa so far as hi own parti
and peopl were concern an absolut dishonour person in thi
state of affair he had a suggest to make let them join forc let
the natur relationship that exist between them and which had been
so nearli sever by a sword thrust that both must have regret
becom real and tender he the father had rank although it suit
him to sink it he had wide experi friend intellig and the
prospect of enorm wealth which of cours he could not expect to
enjoi for ever on the other side he the son had youth great beauti
of person agreeabl and distinguish manner a high heart the
educ of a young man of the world ambit and power of mind that
would carri him far and for the immedi futur an object to gain
the affect of a ladi whom all acknowledg to be as good as she wa
charm and as charm as she wa person attract
she hate me broke in adrian
ah laugh ramiro there speak the voic of small experi oh
youth so easili exalt and so easili depress joyou chequer
youth how mani happi marriag have i not known begin with such hate
as thi well there it is you must take my word for it if you want
to marri elsa brant i can manag it for you and if not why you can
leav it alon
adrian reflect then as hi mind had a practic side he put a
question

chapter xxv
the red mill
after a week experi of that delect dwell and it
neighbourhood adrian began to grow weari of the red mill nine or
ten dutch mile to the norwest of haarlem is a place call velsen
situat on the border of the sanddun to the south of what is
known todai as the north sea canal in the time of which thi page of
histori tell howev the canal wa repres by a great drainag
dyke and velsen wa but a desert villag inde hereabout all the
countri wa desert for some year befor a spanish forc had pass
through it burn slai lai wast so that few were left to
tend the windmil and repair the dyke holland is a countri won from
swamp and sea and if the water is not pump out of it and the
ditch ar not clean veri quickli it relaps into primev marsh
inde it is fortun if the ocean burst through the feebl
barrier rear by the industri of man doe not turn it into vast
lagoon of salt water
onc the red mill had been a pump station which when the huge sail
work deliv the water from the fertil meadow into the great
dyke whenc it ran through sluic gate to the north sea now although
the embank of thi dyke still held the meadow had gone back into
swamp rise out of thesefor it wa situat upon a low mound of
earth rais doubtless as a point of refug by marshdwel
who live and di befor histori began tower the wreck of a
narrowwaist windmil built of brick below and wood abov of veri
lonesom and command appear in it gaunt solitud there were no
hous near it no cattl graze about it foot it wa a dead thing in
a dead landscap to the left but separ from it by a wide and slimi
dyke whenc in time of flood the thick brackish water trickl to the
plain stretch an arid area of sanddun cloth with spars grass
that grew like bristl upon the back of a wild hog beyond these dune
the ocean roar and moan and whisper hungrili as the wind and
weather stir it depth in front not fifti pace awai ran the big
dyke like a rais road secur by embank and discharg dai by
dai it million of gallon of water into the sea but these embank
were weaken now and here and there could be seen a spot which look
as though a giant ploughshar had been drawn up them for a groov of
brown earth scar the face of green where in some winter flood the
water had pour over to find it level cut them like chees but
when it volum sank leav them still stand and as yet suffici
for their purpos
to the right again and behind were more marsh broken onli in the
distanc by the tower of haarlem and the spire of villag church
marsh where the snipe and bittern boom the heron fed and in
summer the frog croak all night long
such wa the refug to which ramiro and hi son adrian had been led by
hagu simon and black meg after thei had escap with their live from
leyden upon the night of the imagebreak in the church that omin
night when the abb domin gave up the ghost on the arm of the
lofti rood and adrian had receiv absolut and baptism from hi
consecr hand
on the journei hither adrian ask no question as to their destin
he wa too broken in heart and too shaken in bodi to be curiou life in
those dai wa for him too much of a hideou phantasmagoria of wast
and black out of which appear veng redhand figur out of
which echo dismal despair voic call him to doom
thei came to the place and found it great basement and the floor
abov or some of them furnish after a fashion the mill had been
inhabit and recent as adrian gather by smuggler or thiev
with whom meg and simon were in allianc or some such outcast
evildo who knew that here the arm of the law could not reach them
though inde while alva rule in the netherland there wa littl law
to be fear by those who were rich or who dare to worship god after
their own manner
why have we come herefath adrian wa about to add but the word
stuck in hi throat
ramiro shrug hi shoulder and look round him with hi on
criticis ey
becaus our guid and friend the worthi simon and hi wife assur
me that in thi spot alon our throat ar for the present safe and
by st pancra after what we saw in the church yonder i am inclin
to agre with them he look a poor thing up under the roof there the
holi father domin didnt he hang up like a black spider from the
end of hi cord bah my backbon ach when i think of him
and how long ar we to stop here
tilltil don freder ha taken haarlem and these fat holland or
those who ar left of them lick our boot for merci and he ground
hi teeth then ad son do you plai card good well let us have
a game here ar dice it will serv to turn our thought now then a
hundr guilder on it

when adrian shut the door behind him the late novemb dai wa draw
to it close and between the rift in the sullen snow cloud now
and again an arrow from the wester sun struck upon the tall
skeletonlik sail of the mill through which the wind rush with a
scream nois adrian had intend to walk on the marsh but find
it too sodden he cross the western dyke by mean of a board laid from
bank to bank and struck into the sanddun beyond even in the summer
when the air wa still and flower bloom and lark sang these dune
were fantast and almost unnatur in appear with their deep
windscoop hollow of pallid sand their sharp angl miniatur
cliff and their crest crown with coars grass but now beneath
the dull pall of the winter sky no spot in the world could have been
more lonesom or more desol for never a sign of man wa to be
seen upon them and save for a solitari curlew whose sad note reach
adrian ear as it beat up wind from the sea even the beast and bird
that dwelt there had hidden themselv awai onli the voic of natur
remain in all their majesti the drear scream and moan of the rush
wind and abov it now low and now volumin as the gale veer the
deep and constant roar of the ocean
adrian reach the highest crest of the ridg whenc the sea hidden
hitherto becam suddenli visibl a vast slatecolour expans
twist here and there into heap hollow here and there into vallei
and broken everywher with angri line and area of white in such
troubl for after it own fashion hi heart wa troubl some
tempera might have found a kind of consol in thi sight for
while we wit them at ani rate the throe and mood of natur in
their great declar a masteri of our sens and stun or hush to
silenc the petti turmoil of our soul thi at least is so with those
who have ey to read the lesson written on natur face and ear
to hear the messag which dai by dai she deliv with her lip gift
given onli to such as hold the cypherkei of imagin and prai for
grace to us it
in adrian case howev the weird of the sandhil and the
grandeur of the seascap with the bitter wind that blew between and the
solitud which brood over all serv onli to exasper nerv that
alreadi were strain well nigh to break
why had hi father brought him to thi hideou swamp border by a
sailless sea to save their live from the furi of the mob thi he
understood but there wa more in it than that some plot which he did
not understand and which the ruffian hagu simon and that shefiend
hi companion had gone awai to execut meanwhil he must sit here dai
after dai plai card with the wretch ramiro whom for no fault of
hi own god had chosen out to be hi parent by the wai why wa the
man so fond of plai card and what wa the mean of all that
nonsens about note of hand ye here he must sit and for compani he
had the sens of hi unalter shame the memori of hi mother face
as she spurn and reject him the vision of the woman whom he love
and had lost andth ghost of dirk van goorl
he shiver as he thought of it ye hi hair lift and hi lip
twitch involuntarili for to adrian rack nerv and distort
vision thi ghost of the good man whom he had betrai wa no child of
phantasi he had woken in the night and seen it stand at hi bedsid
plaguedefil and hungerwast and becaus of it he dread to sleep
alon especi in that creak rathaunt mill whose veri board
seem charg with some tale of death and blood heaven at thi veri
moment he thought he could hear that dead voic call down the
gale no it must be the curlew but at least he would be go home
homethat place homewith not even a priest near to confess to and be
comfort
thank be to the saint the wind had drop a littl but now in place
of it came the snow dens whirl white so dens inde that he
could scarc see hi path what an end that would be to be frozen to
death in the snow on these sandhil while the spirit of dirk van goorl
sat near and watch him die with those hollow hungri ey the sweat
came upon adrian forehead at the thought and he broke into a run
head for the bank of the great dyke that pierc the dune half a
mile or so awai which bank must he knew lead him to the mill he
reach it and trudg along what had been the towpath though now it
wa overgrown with weed and rush it wa not a pleasant journei for
the twilight had close in with speed and the thick flake that seem
to heap into hi face and sting him turn it into a dark
mottl with faint white still he stumbl forward with bent head and
closewrap cloak till he judg that he must be near to the mill and
halt stare through the gloom
just then the snow ceas for a while and light crept back to the cold
face of the earth show adrian that he had done well to halt in
front of where he stood within a few pace of hi feet inde for a
distanc of quit twenti yard the lower part of the bank had slip
awai wash from the stone core with which it wa face at thi
point by a slow and neglect percol of water had he walk on
therefor he would have fallen hi own height or more into a slough of
mud whenc he might or might not have been abl to extric himself
as it wa howev by such light as remain he could crawl upon the
cope of the stonework which wa still held in place with old strut
of timber that until thei had been denud by the slow and constant
leakag were buri and support in the vanish earthwork it wa not
a pleasant bridg for to the right lai the mudbottom gulf and to
the left almost level with hi feet were the black and peati water of
the rainf dyke pour onward to the sea
next flood thi will go thought adrian to himself and then the
marsh must becom a mere which will be bad for whomev happen to be
live in the red mill he wa on firm ground again now and there
loom tall and spectral against the gloom not five hundr yard
awai rose the gaunt sail of the mill to reach it he walk on six
score pace or more to the littl landingquai where a rais path ran
to the build as he drew near to it he wa astonish to hear the
rattl of oar work in rollock and a man voic sai
steadi here is the place prais the saint now then out passeng
and let us be gone
adrian whom event had made timid drew beneath the shadow of the bank
and watch while from the dim outlin of the boat aros three figur
or rather two figur aros drag the third between them
hold her said a voic that seem familiar while i give these men
their hire and there follow a nois of clink coin mingl with
some oath and grumbl about the weather and the distanc which were
abat with more coin then again the oar rattl and the boat wa

next moment thei were roll over and over each other upon the floor
struggl fierc for the knife which simon held
dure all her life elsa never forgot that scene behind her the howl
black of the night and the open door through which flake by flake
the snow leapt into the light in front the larg round room fashion
from the basement of the mill lit onli by the great fire of turf and a
singl horn lantern hung from the ceil that wa rib with beam

the point
no what is it
it is a sound titl to the inherit of the depart hendrik brant
that wealth we might it is true obtain by artific or by arm but how
much better that it should come into the famili in a regular fashion
therebi oust the claim of the crown thing in thi countri ar
disturb at present but thei will not alwai be disturb for in the
end somebodi must give wai and order will prevail then question might
be ask for person in possess of great rich ar alwai the mark
of envi but if the heiress is marri to a good cathol and loyal
subject of the king who can cavil at right sanctifi by the law of
god and man think it over my dear adrian think it over stepmoth
or wifey can take your choic
with impot rage with turmoil of heart and torment of conscienc
adrian did think it over all that night he thought toss on hi
rathaunt pallet while without the snow whirl and the wind beat if
he did not marri elsa hi father would and there could be no doubt as
to which of these altern would be best and happiest for her
elsa marri to that wick cynic devilpossess batter

prevent at ani cost with hi father her lot must be a hell with
himselfaft a period of storm and doubt perhapsit could scarc
be other than happi for wa he not young handsom sympathet
anddevot ah there wa the real point he love thi ladi with all
the earnest of which hi natur wa capabl and the thought of her
pass into the possess of anoth man gave him the acutest anguish
that the man should be foi hi halfbroth wa bad enough that it
should be ramiro hi father wa insupport

wild weather kept you awak last night as it did me although at your

adrian look out of the lattic at the snow which fell and fell
without paus then he turn and said

that such a crime will bring it own reward

vagari i observ that you have a foundat of commonsens just as the

met hi father at meal onli the rest of the dai he prefer to spend
out of door in the snow or hang about the old shed at the back of
the mill rather than endur the societi of thi terribl man thi
man of mock word and iron purpos who wa forc him into the
commiss of a great crime
it wa at breakfast on the follow morn that ramiro inquir of
black mag whether the jufvrouw brant had suffici recov from
the fatigu of her journei to honour them with her presenc the woman
repli that she absolut refus to leav her room or even to speak

then said ramiro as it is import that i should have a few word
with her be so good as to tell the young ladi with my homag that
i will do myself the honour of wait on her in the cours of the
forenoon
meg depart on her errand and adrian look up suspici

at all of which gibe adrian winc but he did not repli for by now he
had learn that he wa no match for hi father bitter wit
elsa receiv the messag as she receiv everyth els in silenc
three dai befor as after a fear ill dure which on sever
occas she wa at the veri door of death lysbeth van goorl had been
declar out of danger elsa her nurs ventur to leav her for a few
hour that even the town seem to stifl her and feel that she
need the air of the countri she pass the morsch poort and walk a
littl wai along the bank of the canal never notic poor girl that
her footstep were dog when it began to grow dusk she halt and
stood a while gaze toward the haarlem meer let her heart go
out to the lover who as she thought and hope within a dai or two
would be at her side
then it wa that someth wa thrown over her head and for a while all
wa black she awok to find herself ly in a boat and watch her
two wretch whom she recognis as those who had assail her when
first she came to leyden from the hagu
why have you kidnap me and where am i go she ask
becaus we ar paid to do it and you ar go to adrian van goorl
wa the answer
then she understood and wa silent
thu thei brought her to thi lonesom murderouslook place where
sure enough adrian wa wait for her wait with a lie upon hi
lip now doubtless the end wa at hand she who love hi brother
with all her heart and soul wa to be given forcibl in marriag to a
man whom she despis and loath the vain furioustemp traitor
who for reveng jealousi or greed she knew not which had not
hesit to send hi benefactor and mother husband to perish in the
fire of the inquisit
what wa she to do escap seem out of the question imprison as
she wa on the third stori of a lofti mill stand in a lone
snowshroud wilder cut off from the sight of everi friendli face
and spi on hour after hour by two fierceei women no there wa
onli on escap for herthrough the gate of death even thi would be
difficult for she had no weapon and dai and night the women kept guard
over her on stand sentinel while the other slept moreov she
had no mind to die be young and healthi with a love to live for
and from her childhood up she had been taught that selfslaught is a
sin no she would trust in god and overwhelm though it wa fight
her wai through thi troubl as best she might the helpless find
friend sometim therefor that her strength might be preserv elsa
rest and at of her food and drank the wine which thei brought to
her refus to leav the room or to speak more than she wa oblig
but watch everyth that pass
on the second morn of her imprison ramiro messag reach
her to which as usual she made no answer in due cours also ramiro
himself arriv and stood bow in the doorwai
have i your permiss to enter jufvrouw he ask then elsa
know that the moment of trial had come steel herself for the
encount
you ar master here she answer in a voic cold as the fall snow
without why then do you mock me
he motion to the women to leav the room and when thei had gone
repli
i have littl thought of such a thing ladi the matter in hand is too
seriou for smart sai and with anoth bow he sat himself down on
a chair near the hearth where a fire wa burn whereon elsa rose and
stood over against him for upon her feet she seem to feel stronger
will you be so good as to set out thi matter senor ramiro am i
brought here to be tri for heresi
even so for heresi against the god of love and the sentenc of the
court is that you must expiat your sin not at the stake but at the
altar
i do not understand
then i will explain my son adrian a worthi young man on the
wholey know that he is my son do you notha had the
misfortun or i should sai the good fortun to fall earnestli in
love with you wherea you have the bad tasteor perhap the good
tasteto give your affect elsewher under the circumst
adrian be a youth of spirit and resourc ha fallen back upon
primit method in order to bring hi suit to a success conclus
he is here you ar here and thi even i understand that the priest
will be here i need not dwell upon the obviou issu inde it is a
privat matter upon which i have no right to intrud except of cours
as a rel and a wellwish
elsa made an impati movement with her hand as though to brush asid
all thi web of word
why do you take so much troubl to forc an unhappi girl into a hate
marriag she ask how can such a thing advantag you
ah answer ramiro briskli i perceiv i have to do with a woman
of busi on who ha that rarest of giftscommon sens i will
be frank your esteem father di possess of a veri larg fortun
which todai is your properti as hi sole issu and heiress under the
marriag law which i myself think unjust that fortun will pass into
the power of ani husband whom you choos to take therefor so soon as
you ar made hi wife it will pass to adrian i am adrian father
and as it happen he is pecuniarili indebt to me to a consider
amount so that in the upshot as he himself ha point out more than
onc thi allianc will provid for both of us but busi detail
ar wearisom so i need not enlarg
the fortun you speak of senor ramiro is lost
it is lost but i have reason to hope that it will be found
you mean that thi is pure a matter of monei
so far as i am concern pure for adrian feel i cannot speak
sinc who know the mysteri of anoth heart
then if the monei were forthcomingor a clue to itther need be no
marriag
so far as i am concern none at all
and if the monei is not forthcom and i refus to marri the heer
adrian or he to marri mewhat then
that is a riddl but i think i see an answer at ani rate to half
of it then the marriag would still take place but with anoth
bridegroom
anoth bridegroom who
your humbl and devot ador
elsa shudder and recoil a step
ah he said i should not have bow you saw my white hairsto the
young a hate sight
elsa indign rose and she answer
it is not your white hair that i shrink from senor which in some
would be a crown of honour but
in my case suggest to you other reflect be gentl and spare me
them in a world of rough action what need to emphasis them with
rough word
for a few minut there wa silenc which ramiro glanc out of the
lattic broke by remark that the snowfal wa extraordinarili heavi
for the time of year then follow anoth silenc
i understood you just now dear ladi to make some sort of suggest
which might lead to an arrang satisfactori to both of us the exact
local of thi wealth is at present obscurey mention some clue
ar you in a posit to furnish such a clue
if i am in a posit what then
then perhap after a few dai visit to an interest but littl
explor part of holland you might return to your friend as you left
themin short as a singl woman
a struggl shook elsa and do what she would some trace of it appear
in her face
do you swear that she whisper
most certainli
do you swear befor god that if you have thi clue you will not forc
me into a marriag with the heer adrian or with yourselfthat you will
let me go unharm
i swear itbefor god
know that god will be reveng upon you if you break the oath you
still swear
i still swear why these needless repetit
thenthen and she leant toward him speak in a hoars whisper
believ that you even you will not dare to be fals to such
an oath for you even you must fear death a miser death and
vengeanc etern vengeanc i give you the clue it li in the hilt
of the sword silenc
the sword silenc what sword is that
the great sword of red martin
stir out of hi selfcontrol ramiro struck hi hand upon hi knee
and to think he said that for over twelv hour i had it hang
on the wall of the gevangenhui well i fear that i must ask you to be
more explicit where is thi sword
wherev red martin is that is all i know i can tell you no more the
plan of the hidingplac is there
or wa there well i believ you but to win a secret from the hilt of
the sword of the man who broke hi wai out of the torturechamb of the
gevangenhui is a labour that would have been not unworthi of hercul
first red martin must be found then hi sword must be taken which
i think will cost men their live dear ladi i am oblig for your
inform but i fear that the marriag must still go through
you swore you swore she gasp you swore befor god
quit so and i shall leaveth power you refer toto manag the
matter doubtless he can attend to hi own affairsi must attend to
mine i hope that about seven oclock thi even will suit you by
which time the priest anda bridegroom will be readi
then elsa broke down

then marsh jan profess himself quit will to sail to the red mill
which he said thei ought to reach by nightfal
all that afternoon thei sail and row till with the dark
befor ever the mill wa in sight the great flood came down upon them
and drove them hither and thither such a flood as had not been seen in
those district for a dozen year but marsh jan knew hi bear well
he had the instinct of local that is bred in those whose forefath
for gener have won a live from the fen and through it all he
held upon a straight cours
onc foi thought that he heard a voic call for help in the dark
but it wa not repeat and thei went forward at last the sky clear
and the moon shone out upon such a wast of water as noah might have
beheld from the ark onli there were thing float in them that noah
would scarc have seen hayrick dead and drown cattl household
furnitur and onc even a coffin wash from some graveyard while
beyond stretch the dreari outlin of the sand dune
the mill should be near said marsh jan let us put about so thei
turn row with weari arm for the wind had fallen
let us go back a littl elsa on escap from the scene of her mock
marriag fled to her room and bolt it door a few second later she
heard hand hammer at it and the voic of hagu simon and black meg
call to her to open she took no note the hammer ceas and then
it wa that for the first time she becam awar of a dread roar
nois a nois of mani water time pass as it pass in a nightmar
till suddenli abov the dull roar came sharp sound as of wood
crack and split and elsa felt that the whole fabric of the mill
had tilt beneath the pressur of the flood it had given where it
wa weakest at it narrow waist and now it red cap hung over like a
windlaid tree
terror took hold of elsa and run to the door she open it hope
to escap down the stair behold water wa creep up them she could
see it by the lantern in her handher retreat wa cut off but there
were other stair lead to the top storei of the mill that now lai at
a steep angl and along these she climb sinc the water wa pour
through her doorwai and there wa nowher els to go in the veri roof
of the place wa a manhol with a rotten hatch she pass through thi
to find herself upon the top of the mill just where on of the great
nake arm of the sail project from it her lantern wa blown out by
now but she clung to the arm and becam awar that the wooden cap of
the structur still anchor to it brick foundat lai upon it side
rock to and fro like a boat upon an angri sea the water wa near
her that she knew by it seeth and rush although she could not see
it but as yet it did not even wet her feet
the hour went by how mani she never learn till at length the
cloud clear the moon becam visibl and by it light she saw an
aw scene everywher around wa water it lap within a yard and
it wa rise still now elsa saw that in the great beam she clasp
were place short spoke for the us of those who set the sail abov
up these she climb as best she might till she wa abl to pass her
bodi between two of the vane and support her breast upon the flat
surfac of on of them as a person doe who lean out of a window from
her window there wa someth to see quit near to her but separ
by fifteen or twenti feet of yellow froth water a littl portion
of the swell shape of the mill stood clear of the flood to thi
foamlap island clung two human beingshagu simon and black meg
thei saw her also and scream for help but she had none to give
sure it wa a dreamnoth so aw could happen outsid a dream
the fabric of the mill tilt more and more the space to which the two
vile creatur hung grew less and less there wa no longer room for
both of them thei began to quarrel to curs and jibber at each other
their fierc bestial face not an inch apart as thei crouch there on
hand and knee the water rose a littl thei were kneel in it now
and the man put down hi bald head but at the woman almost
thrust her from her perch but she wa strong and activ she

black cat which elsa had seen wander about the mill but of black meg
there wa no trace
it wa dreadfulli cold up there hang to the sailbar for now that
the rain had finish it began to freez inde had it not chanc
that elsa wa dress in her warm winter gown with fur upon it and dry
from her head to her feet it is probabl that she would have fallen off
and perish in the water as it wa gradual her bodi becam numb and
her sens fade she seem to know that all thi matter of her forc
marriag of the flood and of the end of simon and meg wa noth but
a dream a veri evil nightmar from which she would awak present to
find herself snug and warm in her own bed in the bree straat of cours
it must be a nightmar for look there on the bare patch of board
beneath the hideou struggl repeat itself there lai hagu simon

knife fell between hi shoulder and now seesh wa grow tall
she had becom a giantess her face shot across the gulf of water and
swam upward through the shadow till it wa within a foot of her oh
she must fall but first she would scream for helpsur the dead
themselv could hear that cry better not have utter it it might
bring ramiro back better go to join the dead what did the voic sai

thi must be all part of her vision and as in dream or out of it
foi had a perfect right to kiss her if he chose she saw no reason to

wind to which anoth voic answer about threequart of an
hour

then after she had swallow someth elsa told her stori while the
three of them cluster round her forward of the sail and marsh jan
manag the helm when she had finish it martin whisper to foi
and as though by a common impuls all four of them kneel down upon the
board in the bottom of the boat and return thank to the almighti

manifold and terribl danger and thi by the hand of her own friend
and of the man to whom she wa affianc when thei had finish their

disfigur face shone with a light of inspir nor did thei who knew
her stori and still believ that the spirit of propheci could open the
ey of chosen seer deem it strang that vision of the thing to be
should visit her at the least thei took comfort from her word and for
a while were no more afraid
yet thei had much to fear by a fate accid thei had been deliv
from great danger onli to fall into danger greater still for as it
chanc on thi tenth of decemb 1572 thei sail straight into the
grasp of the thousand of the spanish armi which had been drawn like

and red martin the free frisian the mighti man of war whom god had
appoint to them as a shield of defenc
so thei smile on each other these two lover of long ago and sail
brave on to the close gate of haarlem
chapter xxviii
aton
seven month had gone by seven of the most dread month ever live
through by human be for all thi space of time through the frost
and snow and fog of winter through the ici wind of spring and now
deep into the heart of summer the citi of haarlem had been close
beleagu by an armi of thirti thousand spaniard most of them
veteran troop under the command of don freder the son of alva and
other gener against thi disciplin host were oppos the littl
garrison of four thousand holland and german aid by a few scotch
and english soldier togeth with a popul of about twenti
thousand old men women and children from dai to dai from week to
week from month to month the struggl wa wage between these
unequ forc mark on either side by the most heroic effort and by
cruelti that would strike our ag as monstrou for in those time the
captiv prison of war could expect no merci inde he wa fortun
if he wa not hung from a gibbet by the leg to die slowli within eyeshot
of hi friend
there were battl without number men perish in hecatomb among the
besieg armi alon over twelv thousand lost their live so that
the neighbourhood of haarlem becam on vast graveyard and the fish in
the lake were poison by the dead assault sorti ambuscad artific
of war combat to the death upon the ic between skateshod soldier
desper sea fight attempt to storm the explos of mine and
countermin that brought death to hundredsal these becam the
familiar incid of daili life
then there were other horror cold from insuffici fuel pestil
of variou sort such as alwai attend a sieg and wors of all for
the beleagu hunger week by week as the summer ag the food grew
less and less till at length there wa noth the weed that grew in
the street the refus of tanneri the last ounc of offal the mice
and the cat all had been devour on the lofti steepl of st bavon
for dai and dai had float a black flag to tell the princ of orang
in leyden that below it wa despair as black the last attempt at
succour had been made batenburg had been defeat and slain togeth
with the seigneur of clotingen and carloo and five or six hundr men
now there wa no more hope
desper expedi were suggest that the women children ag and
sick should be left in the citi while the ablebodi men cut a wai
through the battalion of their besieg on these noncombat it
wa hope that the spaniard would have mercya though the spaniard
could have merci he who afterward drag the wound and the ail
to the door of the hospit and there slaughter them in cold blood
ay and here and elsewher did other thing too dread to write
down sai the old chronicl but thi be understood by the
women thei assembl all togeth make the most piti cri and
lament that could be heard the which would have move a heart of
flint so as it wa not possibl to abandon them
next anoth plan wa form that all the femal and helpless should
be set in the centr of a squar of the fight men to march out
and give battl to the foe till everyon wa slain then the spaniard
hear thi and grow afraid of what these desper men might do
fell back on guil if thei would surrend the citizen of haarlem
were told and pai two hundr and forti thousand florin no punish
should be inflict so have neither food nor hope thei listen
to the voic of the tempter and surrend thei who had fought until
their garrison of four thousand wa reduc to eighteen hundr men
it wa noon and past on the fatal twelfth of juli the gate were open
the spaniard those who were left aliv of them don freder at their
head with drum beat banner fly and sword sharpen for
murder were march into the citi of haarlem in a deep nich between
two great brick pier of the cathedr were gather four peopl whom we
know war and famin had left them all aliv yet thei had born their
share of both in everi enterpris howev desper foi and martin
had march or stood or watch side by side and well did the
spaniard know the weight of the great sword silenc and the redhead
giant who wield it mother martha too had not been idl throughout
the sieg she had serv as the lieuten of the widow hassela who
with a band of three hundr women fought dai and night alongsid
of their husband and brother even elsa who although she wa too
delic and by natur timid and unfit to go out to battl had done
her part for she labour at the dig of mine and the build of
wall till her soft hand were rough and scar
how chang thei were foi whose face had been so youth look now
like a man on the wrong side of middl ag the huge martin might have
been a great skeleton on which hung cloth or rather rag and a
rent bull hide with hi blue ey shine in deep pit beneath the
massiv project skull elsa too had becom quit small like a
child her sweet face wa no longer pretti onli piti and all the
round of her figur had vanishedsh might have been an emaci
boi of the four of them martha the mare who wa dress like a man
show the least chang inde except that now her hair wa snowi
that her featur were rather more horselik that the yellow lipless
teeth project even further and the thin nervou hand had becom
almost like those of an egyptian mummi she wa much as she alwai had
been
martin lean upon the great sword and groan curs on them the
coward he mutter why did thei not let us go out and die fight
fool mad fool who would trust to the merci of the spaniard
oh foi said elsa throw her thin arm about hi neck you will
not let them take me will you if it come to the worst you will kill
me wont you otherwis i must kill myself and foi i am a coward i
am afraidto do that
i suppos so he answer in a harsh unnatur voic but oh god
if thou art have piti upon her oh god have piti
blasphem not doubt not broke in the shrill voic of martha ha
it not been as i told you last winter in the boat have you not been
protect and shall you not be protect to the end onli blasphem
not doubt not
the nich in which thei were stand wa out of sight of the great
squar and those who throng it but as martha spoke a band of
victori spaniard seven or eight of them came round the corner and
caught sight of the parti in the nook
there a girl said the sergeant in command of them who isnt bad
look pull her out men
some fellow step forward to do hi bid now foi went mad he did
not kill elsa as she had prai him he flew straight at the throat of
the brute who had spoken and next instant hi sword wa stand out
a foot behind hi neck then after him with a kind of low cry came
martin ply the great blade silenc and martha after him with her
long knife it wa all over in a minut but befor it wa done there
were five men down three dead and two sore wound
a tith and an offer mutter martha as bound forward she
bent over the wound men and their comrad fled round the corner of
the cathedr
there wa a minut paus the bright summer sunlight shone upon the
face and armour of the dead spaniard upon the nake sword of foi
who stood over elsa crouch to the ground in a corner of the nich her
face hidden in her hand upon the terribl blue ey of martin alight
with a dread fire of rage then there came the sound of march
men and a compani of spaniard appear befor them and at their
headramiro and adrian call van goorl
there thei ar captain said a soldier on of those who had fled
shall we shoot them
ramiro look carelessli enough at first then again a long
scrutinis look so he had caught them at last month ago he had
learn that elsa had been rescu from the red mill by foi and martin
and now after much seek the bird were in hi net
no he said i think not such desper charact must be reserv
for separ trial
where can thei be kept captain ask the sergeant sulkili
i observ friend that the hous which my son and i have taken as
our quarter ha excel cellar thei can be imprison there for the
presentthat is except the young ladi whom the senor adrian will look
after as it chanc she is hi wife
at thi the soldier laugh openli
i repeathi wife for whom he ha been search these mani month
said ramiro and therefor to be respect do you understand men
appar thei did understand at least no on made ani answer their
captain as thei had found wa not a man who love argument
now then you fellow went on ramiro give up your arm
martin thought a while evid he wa wonder whether it would not
be best to rush at them and die fight at that moment as he said
afterward inde the old sai came into hi mind a game is not
lost until it is won and rememb that dead men can never have
anoth chanc of win game he gave up the sword
hand that to me said ramiro it is a curiou weapon to which i have
taken a fanci
so sword silenc wa hand to him and he slung it over hi shoulder
foi look at the kneel elsa and he look at hi sword then an
idea struck him and he look at the face of adrian hi brother whom
he had last seen when the said adrian ran to warn him and martin at the
factori for though he knew that he wa fight with hi father among
the spaniard dure the sieg thei had never met even then in
that dire extrem with a sudden flash of thought he wonder how
it happen that adrian be the villain that he wa had taken the
troubl to come and warn them yonder in leyden therebi give them time
to make a veri good defenc in the shot tower
foi look up at hi brother adrian wa dress in the uniform of a
spanish offic with a breastplat over hi quilt doublet and a
steel cap from the front of which rose a frai and weatherworn plume
of feather the face had chang there wa none of the old pompos
about those handsom featur it look worn and cow like that of an
anim which ha been train to do trick by hunger and the us of the
whip yet through all the shame and degrad foi seem to catch
the glint of some kind of light a light of good desir shine behind
that piteou mask as the sun sometim shine through a sullen cloud
could it be that adrian wa not quit so bad after all that he wa
in fact the adrian that he foi had alwai believ him to be vain
silli passion exagger born to be a tool and think himself
the master but beneath everyth wellmean who could sai at the
worst too wa it not better that elsa should becom the wife of adrian
than that her life should ceas there and then and by her lover hand
these thing pass through hi brain as the lightn pass through
the sky in an instant hi mind wa made up and foi flung down hi sword
at the feet of a soldier as he did so hi ey met the ey of adrian
and to hi imagin thei seem to be full of thank and promis
thei took them all with gibe and blow the soldier hale them awai
through the tumult and the agoni of the fallen town and it doom
defend out of the rich sunlight thei led them into a hous that
still stood not greatli harm by the cannonshot but a littl wai
from the shatter ravelin and the gate which had been the scene of such
fear conflicta hous that wa the home of on of the wealthiest
merchant in haarlem here foi and elsa were part she struggl to
hi arm whenc thei tore her and drag her awai up the stair but
martin martha and foi were thrust into a dark cellar lock in and
left
a while later the door of the cellar wa unbar and some hand thei
could not see whose pass through it water and food good food such as
thei had not tast for month meat and bread and dri her more
than thei could eat of them
perhap it is poison said foi smell at it hungrili
what need to take the troubl to poison us answer martin let us
eat and drink for tomorrow we die
so like starv anim thei devour the food with thank and
then thei slept ye in the midst of all their miseri and doubt thei
slept
it seem but a few minut laterin fact it wa eight hourswhen the
door open again and there enter adrian carri a lantern in hi
hand
foi martin he said get up and follow me if you would save your
live
instantli thei were wide awak
follow youyou stammer foi in a choke voic
ye adrian answer quietli of cours you mai not escap but if
you stop here what chanc have you ramiro my father will be back
present and then
it is mad to trust ourselv to you interrupt martin and
adrian seem to winc at the contempt in hi voic
i knew that you would think that he answer humbl but what els
is to be done i can pass you out of the citi i have made a boat readi
for you to escap in all at the risk of my own life what more can i
do why do you hesit
becaus we do not believ you said foi besid there is elsa i
will not go without elsa
i have thought of that answer adrian elsa is here come elsa
show yourself
then from the stair elsa crept into the cellar a new elsa for she
too had been fed and in her ey there shone a light of hope a wild
jealousi fill foi heart why did she look thu but she she ran to
him she flung her arm about hi neck and kiss him and adrian did
noth he onli turn hi head asid
foi she gasp he is honest after all he ha onli been
unfortun come quickli there is a chanc for us come befor that
devil return now he is at a council of the offic settl with don
freder who ar to be kill but soon he will be back and then
so thei hesit no more but went
thei pass out of the hous none stop themth guard had gone to
the sack at the gate by the ruin ravelin there stood a sentri but
the man wa careless or drunken or bribe who know at least adrian
gave him a password and nod hi head he let them by a few
minut later thei were at the mere side and there among some reed lai
the boat
enter and be gone said adrian
thei scrambl into the boat and took the oar while martha began to
push off
adrian said elsa what is to becom of you
why do you troubl about that he ask with a bitter laugh i go

sail or weapon seem unlik

not so bad said martin row with hi left hand as he handl the
big ax with hi right but i wish that i had my sword silenc which
that accurs ramiro took from me and hung about hi neck i wonder
why he troubl himself with the thing it is too long for a man of hi
inch

at it hilt with a chisel which seem strang he alwai want that
sword dure the sieg he offer a larg reward to ani soldier who
could kill you and bring it to him

forgotten the map the map some wick villain must have told him that
the map of the treasur wa therethat is why he want the sword
who could have told him ask foi it wa onli known to you and
me and martha and we ar not of the sort to tell what give awai the
secret of hendrik brant treasur which he could die for and we were
sworn to keep to save our miser live shame upon the thought
martha heard and look at elsa a question look beneath which the
poor girl turn a fieri red though by good fortun in that light none
could see her blush still she must speak lest the suspicion should
lie on other
i ought to have told you befor she said in a low voic but i
forgoti mean that i have alwai been so dreadfulli asham it wa i
who betrai the secret of the sword silenc
you how did you know it ask foi
mother martha told me on the night of the church burn after you

martin grunt on woman to trust anoth and at her ag too what a
fool

well that then she should know where to look for a kei to the treasur
a woman kind of reason answer martin imperturb and a bad
on at that for if we had been finish off she must have found it
difficult to get hold of the sword but all thi is done with the point
is why did the jufvrouw tell ramiro
becaus i am a coward answer elsa with a sob you know foi i
alwai wa a coward and i never shall be anyth els i told him to
save myself
from what

terror at the thought of thi hate marriageher a groan burst
from the lip of adrian and someth like a chuckl from those of red

i did not wish to hurt adrian feel especi after he ha been
so good to us
never mind adrian feel and hi good but go on with the
stori interrupt foi

yourself from a veri dread thing therefor who can blame you
i can said martha ramiro might have torn me to piec with redhot
pincer befor i told him

light of the sink moon then shift the helm a point or two to port
and sat still
i am hungri again said martin present i feel as though i could
eat for a week without stop
adrian look up from over hi oar at which he wa labour
dejectedli and said
there ar food and wine in the locker i hid them there perhap elsa
could serv them to those who wish to eat
so elsa who wa do noth found the drink and victual and hand
them round to the rower who at and drank as best thei might with a
thank heart but without ceas from their task to men who have
starv for month the tast of wholesom provend and sound wine is a
delight that cannot be written in word
when at length thei had fill themselv adrian spoke
if it is your good will brother he said address foi as we do
not know what li in front nor how long ani of us have to live i who
am an outcast and a scorn among you wish to tell you a stori
speak on said foi
so adrian began from the begin and told them all hi tale he told
them how at the first he had been led astrai by superstit vaniti
and love how hi foolish confid had been written down by spi
how he had been startl and terrifi into sign them with result
of which thei knew then he told them how he wa hunt like a mad dog
through the street of leyden after hi mother had turn him from her
door how he took refug in the den of hagu simon and there had fought
with ramiro and been conquer by the man address and hi own horror
of shed a father blood he told them of hi admiss into
the roman faith of the dread scene in the church when martha had
denounc him of their flight to the red mill he told them of the
kidnap of elsa and how he had been quit innoc of it although
he love her dearli of how at last he wa driven into marri her
mean her no harm to save her from the grip of ramiro and know at
heart that it wa no marriag of how when the flood burst upon them
he had been hustl from the mill where sinc she could no longer be of
servic to him and might work him injuri as he discov afterward
ramiro had left elsa to her fate lastli in a broken voic he told
them of hi life dure the long sieg which so he said wa as the
life of a damn spirit and of how when death thin the rank of the
spaniard he had been made an offic among them and by the special
malic of ramiro forc to conduct the execut and murder of such
holland as thei took
then at last hi chanc had come ramiro think that now he could
never turn against him had given him elsa and left him with her while
he went about hi duti and to secur a share of the plunder mean
to deal with hi prison on the morrow so he adrian a man in
author had provid the boat and freed them that wa all he had to
sai except to renounc ani claim upon her who wa call hi wife and
to beg their forgiv
foi listen to the end then drop hi oar for a moment he put hi
arm about adrian waist and hug him sai in hi old cheeri voic
i wa right after all you know adrian i alwai stood up for you
notwithstand your temper and queer wai no i never would believ
that you were a villain but neither could i ever have believ that you
were quit such an ass
to thi outspoken estim of hi charact so fallen and crush wa
he hi brother had not the spirit to repli he could mere tug at hi
oar and groan while the tear of shame and repent ran down hi pale
and handsom face
never mind old fellow said foi consolingli it all went wrong
thank to you and thank to you i believ that it will all come right
again so we will cry quit and forget the rest
poor adrian glanc up at foi and at elsa sit on the thwart of the
boat by hi side
ye brother he answer for you and elsa it mai come right
but not for me in thi world for ii have sold myself to the devil
andgot no pai
after that for a while no on spoke all felt that the situat wa
too tragic for speech even the folli and inde the wicked of
adrian were cover up were blot out in the tragedi of hi utter
failur ye and redeem by the depth of hi aton
the grei light of the summer morn began to grow on the surfac of the
great inland sea far behind them thei beheld the sun rai break
upon the gilt crown that is set abov the tower of st bavon church
soar over the lost citi of haarlem and the doom patriot who lai
there present to meet their death at the murder sword thei look
and shudder had it not been for adrian thei would be prison now
and what that meant thei knew if thei had been in ani doubt what thei
saw around must have enlighten them for here and there upon the misti
surfac of the lake or strand in it shallow were the halfburnt
out hull of ship the remain of the conquer fleet of william
the silent a poor record of the last desper effort to reliev the
starv citi now and again too someth limp and soft would cumber
their oar the corps of a drown or slaughter man still clad
perchanc in it armour
at length thei pass out of these dismal remain of lost men and elsa
could look about her without shudder now thei were in fleet water
and in among the island whereon the lush summer growth of weed and the
beauti marsh flower grew as greenli and bloom as bright as though
no spaniard had trampl their root under foot dure all those winter
month of sieg and death these islet score and hundr of them
appear on everi side but between them all martha steer an uner
path as the sun rose she stood up in the boat and shade her ey
with her hand to shut out it level rai look befor her
there is the place she said point to a littl bulrushclad isl
from which a kind of natur causewai not more than six feet wide
project like a tongu among muddi shallow peopl by coot and
waterhen with their redbeak young
martin rose too then he look back behind him and said
i see the cap of a sail upon the skylin it is ramiro
without doubt answer martha calmli well we have the half of an
hour to work in pull bow oar pull we will go round the island and
beach her in the mud on the further side thei will be less like to
see us there and i know a place whenc we can push off in a hurri
chapter xxix
adrian come home again
thei land on the island wade to it through the mud which at thi
spot had a gravelli bottom all of them except elsa who remain on the
boat to keep watch follow otterpath through the thick rush thei
came to the centr of the islet some thirti yard awai here at a spot
which martha ascertain by a few hurri pace grew a dens tuft of
reed in the midst of these reed wa a duck nest with the young just
hatch out off which the old bird flew with terrifi quack
beneath thi nest lai the treasur if it were still there
at ani rate the place ha not been disturb late said foi then
even in hi frantic hast lift the littl fledglingsfor he
love all thing that had life and did not wish to see them hurth
deposit them where thei might be found again by the mother
noth to dig with mutter martin not even a stone thereon
martha push her wai to a willow bush that grew near and with the
smaller of the two ax which she held in her hand cut down the
thickest of it stem and ran back with them by the help of these
sharpen stake and with their ax thei began to dig furious till
at length the point of foi implement struck upon the head of a barrel
the stuff is still here keep to it friend he said and thei work
on with a will till three of the five barrel were almost free from the
mud
best make sure of these said martin help me master and between
them on by on thei roll them to the water edg and with great
effort elsa aid them lift them into the boat as thei approach
with the third cask thei found her stare whitefac over the top of
the featheri reed
what is it sweet ask foi
the sail the follow sail she answer
thei rest the barrel of gold upon the gunwal and look back across
the littl island ye there it came sure enough a tall white sail
not eight hundr yard awai and bear down straight upon the place
martin roll the barrel into posit
i hope that thei would not find it he said but martha draw map
well too well onc befor she marri she paint pictur and that
is why
what is to be done ask elsa
i dont know he answer and as he spoke martha ran up for she also
had seen the boat you see he went on if we try to escap thei will
catch us for oar cant race a sail
oh said elsa must we be taken after all
i hope not girl said martha but it is as god will listen
martin and she whisper in hi ear
good he said if it can be done but you must watch your chanc
come now there is no time to lose and you ladi come also for you
can help to roll the last two barrel
then thei ran back to the hole whenc foi and adrian with great toil
had just drag the last of the tub for thei too had seen the sail
and knew that time wa short
heer adrian said martin you have the crossbow and the bolt and
you us to be the best shot of all three of us will you help me to
hold the causewai
now adrian knew that martin said thi not becaus he wa a good shot
with the crossbow but becaus he did not trust him and wish to have
him close to hi hand but he answer
with all my heart as well as i am abl
veri good said martin now let the rest of you get those two cask
into the boat leav the jufvrouw hidden in the reed to watch by
it while you foi and martha come back to help us ladi if thei sail
round the island call and let us know
so martin and adrian went down to the end of the littl gravelli tongu
and crouch among the tall meadowsweet and grass while the other
work furious roll the two barrel to the wateredg and ship
them throw rush over them that thei might not catch the ey of the
spaniard
the sail boat drew on in the sternsheet of it sat ramiro an open
paper which he wa studi upon hi knee and still slung about hi
bodi the great sword silenc
befor i am half an hour older reflect martin for even now he did
not like to trust hi thought to adrian either i will have that sword
back again or i shall be a dead man but the odd ar great eleven of
them all tough fellow and we but three and two women
just then ramiro voic reach them across the still of the water
down with the sail he cri cheerili for without a doubt that is
the placether ar the six islet in a line there in front the other
island shape like a her and there the littl promontori mark
land place how well thi artist draw to be sure
the rest of hi remark were lost in the creak of the block as the
sail came down
shallow water ahead senor said a man in the bow sound with a
boat hook
good answer ramiro throw out the littl anchor we will wade
ashor
as he spoke the spanish soldier with the boathook suddenli pitch
head first into the water a quarrel from adrian crossbow through hi
heart
ah said ramiro so thei ar here befor us well there cant be
mani of them now then prepar to land
anoth quarrel whistl through the air and stuck in the mast do
no hurt after thi no more bolt came for in hi eager adrian had
broken the mechan of the bow by overwind it so that it becam
useless thei leap into the water ramiro with them and charg for
the land when of a sudden almost at the tip of the littl promontori
from among the reed rose the gigant shape of red martin clad in hi
tatter jerkin and bear in hi hand a heavi ax while behind him
appear foi and adrian
why by the saint cri ramiro there my weathercock son again
fight against us thi time well weathercock thi is your last
veer then he began to wade toward the promontori charg he cri
but not a man would advanc within reach of that ax thei stood here
and there in the water look at it doubtfulli for although thei were
brave enough there wa none of them but knew of the strength and deed
of the red frisian giant and halfstarv as he wa fear to meet him
face to face moreov he had a posit of advantag of that there
could be no doubt
can i help you to land friend said martin mock them no it is
no us look right or left the mud there is veri deep
an arquebu shoot him with an arquebu shout the men in front but
there wa no such weapon in the boat for the spaniard who had left in
a hurri and without expect to meet red martin had noth but their
sword and knive
ramiro consid a moment for he saw that to attempt to storm thi
littl landingplac would cost mani live even if it were possibl
then he gave an order back aboard the men obei with alacr out
oar and up anchor he cri
he is clever said foi he know that our boat must be somewher and
he is go to seek for it
martin nod and for the first time look afraid then as soon as
ramiro had begun to row round the islet leav martha to watch that
he did not return and rush the landingstag thei cross through the
reed to the other side and climb into their boat scarc were thei
there when ramiro and hi men appear and a shout announc that thei
were discov
on crept the spaniard as near as thei dare that is to within a dozen
fathom of them and anchor for thei were afraid to run their own
heavi sail cutter upon the mud lest thei might be unabl to get her
off again also for evid reason be without firearm and know
the charact of the defend thei fear to make a direct attack the
posit wa curiou and threaten to be prolong at last ramiro rose
and address them across the water
gentlemen and ladi of the enemi he said for i think that i see my
littl captiv of the red mill among you let us take counsel togeth
we have both of us made thi expedit for a purpos have we
notnam to secur certain filthi lucr which after all would be
of slight valu to dead men now as you or some of you know i am a
man oppos to violenc i wish to hurri the end of none nor even
to inflict suffer if it can be avoid but there is monei in the
question to secur which i have alreadi gone through a great deal of
inconveni and anxieti and to be brief that monei i must have
while you on the other hand ar doubtless anxiou to escap henc with
your live so i make you an offer let on of our parti come under safe
conduct on board your boat and search it just to see if anyth li
beneath those rush for instanc then if it is found empti we will
withdraw to a distanc and let you go or the same if full that is
upon it content be unladen into the mud
ar those all your term ask foi
not quit all worthi heer van goorl among you i observ a young
gentleman whom doubtless you have manag to carri off against hi
will to wit my belov son adrian in hi own interest for he will
scarc be a welcom guest in leyden i ask that befor you depart
you should place thi nobl cavali ashor in a posit where we can
see him now what is your answer
that you mai go back to hell to look for it repli martin rude
while foi ad
what other answer do you expect from folk who have escap out of your
clutch in haarlem
as he said the word at a nod from martin martha who by now had crept
up to them under cover of hi great form and of surround reed let
go the stern of the boat and vanish
plain word from plain uncultiv peopl not unnatur irrit
by the cours of polit event with which although fortun ha mix
me up in them i have noth whatev to do answer ramiro but
onc more i beg of you to consid it is probabl that you have no food
upon your boat wherea we have plenti also in due cours dark
will fall which must give us a certain advantag moreov i have
reason to hope for assist therefor in a wait game like thi
the card ar with me and as i think your poor prison adrian will
tell you i know how to plai a hand at card
about eight yard from the cutter in a thick patch of waterlili
just at thi moment an otter rose to take airan old dogott for it
wa greyhead on of the spaniard in the boat caught sight of the
ring it made and pick up a stone from the ballast threw it at it
idli the otter vanish
we have been seek each other a long while but have never come to
blow yet although be a brave man i know you would wish it
said red martin modestli senor ramiro will you do me the honour to
overlook my humbl birth and come ashor with me for a few minut man
against man the odd would be in your favour for you have armour and i
have noth but a worn bull hide also you have my good sword silenc
and i onli a woodman ax still i will risk it and what is more
trust to your good faith we ar will to wager the treasur of
hendrik brant upon the issu
so soon as thei understood thi challeng a roar of laughter went up
from the spaniard in the boat in which ramiro himself join heartili
the idea of anyon voluntarili enter upon a singl combat with the
terribl frisian giant who for month had been a name of fear among the
thousand that beleagu haarlem struck them as realli ludicr
but of a sudden thei ceas laugh and on and all stare with a
strang anxieti at the bottom of their boat much as terrier dog stare
at the earth beneath which thei hear invis vermin on the move then
a great shout aros among them and thei look eagerli over the
gunwal ye and began to stab at the water with their sword but all
the while through the tumult and voic came a steadi regular sound as
of a person knock heavili on the further side of a thick door
mother of heaven scream someon in the cutter we ar scuttl
and thei began to tear at the fals bottom of their boat while other
stab still more furious at the surfac of the mere
now rise on by on to the face of that quiet water could be seen
bubbl and the line of them ran from the cutter toward the row
boat present within six feet of it ax in hand rose the strang
and dread figur of a nake skeletonlik woman cover with mud and
green weed and bleed from great wound in the back and side
there it stood shake an ax at the terrorstricken spaniard and
scream in short gasp
paid back paid back ramiro now sink and drown you dog or come
visit red martin on the shore
well done martha roar martin as he drag her dy into the
boat while he spoke lo the cutter began to fill and sink
there is but on chanc for it cri ramiro overboard and at them

neck he began to wade toward the shore
push off cri foi and thei thrust and pull but the gold wa
heavi and their boat had settl far into the mud do what thei might
she would not stir then utter some strang frisian oath martin
sprang over her stern and put out all hi mighti strength thrust
at it to loos her still she would not move the spaniard came up now
the water reach onli to their thigh and their bright sword flash
in the sunlight
cut them down yell ramiro at them for your live sake
the boat trembl but she would not stir
too heavi in the bow scream martha and struggl to her feet
with on wild scream she launch herself straight at the throat of the
nearest spaniard she grip him with her long arm and down thei went
togeth onc thei rose then fell again and through a cloud of mud
might be seen struggl upon the bottom of the mere till present thei
lai still both of them
the lighten boat lift and in answer to martin mighti effort
glide forward through the cling mud again he thrust and she wa
clear
climb in martin climb in shout foi as he stab at a spaniard
by heaven no roar ramiro splash toward him with the face of a
devil
for a second martin stood still then he bent and the swordcut fell
harmless upon hi leather jerkin now veri suddenli hi great arm shot
out ye he seiz ramiro by the thigh and lift and there wa seen
the sight of a man thrown into the air as though he were a ball toss
by a child at plai to fall headlong upon the cask of treasur in the
skiff prow where he lai still
martin sprang forward and grip the tiller with hi outstretch hand
as it glide awai from him
row master row he cri and foi row madli until thei were clear
of the last spaniard clear by ten yard even elsa snatch a rollock
and with it struck a soldier on the hand who tri to stai them forc
him to loos hi grip a deed of valour she boast of with pride all
her life through then thei drag martin into the boat
now you spanish dog the great man roar back at them as he shook
the water from hi flame hair and beard go dig for brant treasur
and live on duck egg here till don freder send to fetch you
the island had melt awai into a mist of other island no live thing
wa to be seen save the wild creatur and bird of the great lake and
no sound wa to be heard except their call and the voic of the
wind and water thei were alonealon and safe and there at a distanc
toward the skylin rose the church tower of leyden for which thei
head
jufvrouw said martin present there is anoth flagon of wine in
that locker and we should be glad of a pull at it
elsa who wa steer the boat rose and found the wine and a horn mug
which she fill and hand first to foi
here a health said foi as he drank to the memori of mother
martha who save us all well she di as she would have wish to
die take a spaniard for compani and her stori will live on
amen said martin then a thought struck him and leav hi oar
for a minut for he row two as against foi and adrian on he
went forward to where ramiro lai stricken senseless on the keg of
speci and jewel in the bow and took from him the great sword
silenc but he strap the spaniard leg togeth with hi belt
that crack on the head keep him quiet enough he said in explan
but he might come to and give troubl or try to swim for it sinc
such cat have mani live ah senor ramiro i told you i would have my
sword back befor i wa half an hour older or go where i shouldnt want
on then he touch the spring in the hilt and examin the caviti
why he said here my legaci left in it safe and sound no wonder
my good angel made me mad to get that sword again
no wonder echo foi especi as you got ramiro with it and he
glanc at adrian who wa labour at the bow oar look now that
the excit of the fight had gone by most downcast and wretch
well he might see the welcom that as he fear await him in
leyden
for a while thei row on in silenc all that thei had gone through
dure the last four and twenti hour and the seven preced month of
war and privat had broken their nerv even now although thei
had escap the danger and won back the buri gold captur the
archvillain who had brought them so much death and miseri and their
home which for the present moment at ani rate wa a strong place of
refug lai befor them still thei could not be at eas where so
mani had di where the risk had been so fear it seem almost
incred that thei four should be live and hale though weari with
a prospect of continu to live for mani year
that the girl whom he love so dearli and whom he had so nearli lost
should be sit befor him safe and sound readi to becom hi wife
whensoev he might wish it seem to foi also a thing too good to
be true too good to be true wa it moreov that hi brother the
wayward passion weak poeticalmind adrian made by natur to be
the tool of other and bear the burden of their evil do should have
been drag befor it wa over late out of the net of the fowler
have repent of hi sin and folli and at the risk of hi own life
shown that he wa still a man no longer the base slave of passion and
selflov for foi alwai love hi brother and know him better than
ani other knew him had found it hard to believ that howev black
thing might look against him he wa at heart a villain
thu he thought and elsa too had her thought which mai be guess
thei were silent all of them till of a sudden elsa seat in the
sternsheet saw adrian suddenli let fall hi oar throw hi arm wide
and pitch forward against the back of martin ye and in place of where
he had sat appear the dread counten of ramiro stamp with a
grin of hideou hate such as satan might wear when soul escap him at
the last ramiro recov and sit up for to hi feet he could
not rise becaus of the sword strap in hi hand a thin deadlylook
knife
habet he said with a short laugh habe weathercock and he
turn the knife against himself
but martin wa on him and in five more second he lai truss like a
fowl in the bottom of the boat
shall i kill him said martin to foi who with elsa wa bend over
adrian
no answer foi grimli let him take hi trial in leyden oh what
accurs fool were we not to search him
ramiro face turn a shade more ghastli
it is your hour he said in a hoars voic you have won thank to
that dog of a son of mine who i trust mai linger long befor he di
as die he must ah well thi is what come of break my oath to the
virgin and again lift my hand against a woman he look at elsa and
shudder then went on it is your hour make an end of me at onc i
do not wish to appear thu befor those boor
gag him said foi to martin lest our ear be poison and martin
obei with good will then he flung him down and there the man lai
hi back support by the keg of treasur he had work so hard and
sin so deepli to win make as he knew well hi last journei to
death and to whatev mai lie beyond that solemn gate
thei were pass the island that mani year ago had form the
turn post of the great sledg race in which hi passeng had been
the fair leyden heiress lysbeth van hout ramiro could see her now as
she wa that dai he could see also how that race which he just fail
to win had been for him an auguri of disast had not the holland
again beaten him at the post and that hollanderlysbeth own son by
anoth fatherhelp to it by her son born of himself who now lai

him to lysbeth he knew it she would be hi judg that woman against
whom he had pile up injuri after injuri whom even when she seem
to be in hi power he had fear more than ani live be and
after he had met her ey for the last time then would come the end
what sort of an end would it be for the captain redhand from the
sieg of haarlem for the man who had brought dirk van goorl to
hi death for the father who had just plant a dagger between the
shoulder of hi son becaus at the last that son had chosen to be
true to hi own peopl and to deliv them from a dread doom
why did it come back to him that horribl dream which had risen in hi
mind when for the first time after mani year he met lysbeth face to
face there in the gevangenhui that dream of the piti littl man
fall fall through endless space and at the bottom of the gulf
two great hand hand hideou and suggest reach through the
shadow to receiv him
like hi son adrian ramiro wa superstiti more hi intellect hi
read which in youth had been consider hi observ of men
and women all led him to the conclus that death is a wall with mani
door in it that on thi side of the wall we mai not linger or sleep
but must pass each of us through hi appoint portal straight to the
domain prepar for us if so what would be hi lot and who would be
wait to greet him yonder oh terror mai attend the wick after
death but in the case of some thei do not tarri until death thei leap
forward to him whom it is decre must die forc attent with their
eager crave hand with their obscur and omin voic about
him the sweet breath of the summer afternoon the skim swallow
the meadow star with flower within him everi hell at which the
imagin can so much as hint
befor he pass the gate of leyden in those few short hour ramiro

leaguer of thi place i sent her and my mother to norwich in england
where thei mai sleep in peac
you were wise inde heer van goorl repli the princ with a sigh
but it seem that you stop behind

morn and learn from it for certain what we have heard befor that
you ar in sore want of monei for the defenc of leyden and the war at
larg therefor hear that you were still in the citi and believ
thi proclam of your to be the summon and clear command for which
we wait we have brought you hendrik brant treasur it is there
upon the cart
the princ put hi hand to hi forehead and reel back a step
you do not jest with me foi van goorl he said
inde no
but stai thi treasur is not your to give it belong to elsa
brant
sir the legal titl to it is in myself for my father wa brant
law heir and executor and i inherit hi right moreov although
a provis for her is charg upon it it is elsa desirei have
it written here under her hand and witnessedthat the monei should be
us everi ducat of it for the servic of the countri in such wai as i
might find good lastli her father hendrik brant alwai believ that
thi wealth of hi would in due season be of such servic here is a
copi of hi will in which he direct that we ar to appli the monei
for the defenc of our countri the freedom of religi faith and the
destruct of the spaniard in such fashion and at such time or time
as god shall reveal to us when he gave us charg of it also hi word
to me were i am certain that thousand and ten of thousand of our
folk will live to bless the gold of hendrik brant on that belief too
think that god put it into hi mind and would reveal hi purpos
in hi own hour we have act all of us and therefor for the sake of
thi stuff we have gone to death and tortur now it ha come about as
brant foretold now we understand why all these thing have happen
and why we live thi man and i to stand befor you sir todai
with the hoard unminish by a singl florin no not even by martin
legaci
man you jest you jest said orang
foi made a sign and martin go to the cart pull off the
sailcloth reveal the five mudstain barrel paint each of
them with the mark b there too readi for the purpos were a hammer
mallet and chisel rest the shaft of the cart upon a tabl martin
climb into it and with a few great blow of the mallet drove in
the head of a cask select at hazard beneath appear wool which he
remov not without fear lest there might be some mistak then as he
could wait no longer he tilt the barrel up and shot it content out
upon the floor
as it chanc thi wa the keg that contain the jewel into which
forese troublou dai from time to time brant had convert the
most of hi vast wealth now in on glitter stream of red and white
and blue and green break from their case and wrap that the
damp had rot save for those pearl the most valuabl of them all
which were in the watertight copper boxthei fell jingl to the open
floor where thei roll hither and thither like bean shot from a sack
in the stead
i think there is onli thi on tub of jewel said foi quietli the
rest which ar much heavier ar full of gold coin here sir is the
inventori so that you mai check the list and see that we have kept back
noth
but william of orang heed him not onli he look at the priceless
gem and mutter fleet of ship armi of men convoi of food
mean to bribe the great and bui goodwillay and the netherland
themselv wrung from the grip of spain the netherland free and rich
and happi o god i thank thee who thu hast move the heart of men to
the salvat of thi thy peopl from sore danger
then in the sudden ecstasi of relief and joi the great princ hid hi
face in hi hand and wept
thu it came about that the rich of hendrik brant when leyden lai
at her last gasp paid the soldier and built the fleet which in
due time driven by a great wind sent suddenli from heaven across
the flood meadow rais the dread sieg and sign the doom of
spanish rule in holland therefor it would seem that not in vain wa
hendrik brant stubborn and foresight that hi blood and the blood
of dirk van goorl were not shed in vain that not in vain also did
elsa suffer the worst torment of a woman fear in the red mill on the
marsh and foi and martin plai their part like men in the shottow
the gevangenhui and the sieg and mother martha the sword find a grave
and rest in the water of the haarlem meer
there ar other moral to thi stori also applic perhap to our
life todai but the reader is left to guess them
scene the second
leyden is safe at last and through the broken dyke foi and martin
with the rescu ship have sail shout and redhand into her
faminestricken street for the spaniard those that ar left of them
ar broken and have fled awai from their fort and flood trench
so the scene chang from war bloodstain triumphant holland to
the quiet citi of norwich and a quaint gabl hous in tombland almost
beneath the shadow of the tall spire of the cathedr which now for
about a year had been the home of lysbeth van goorl and elsa brant here
to norwich thei had come in safeti in the autumn of 1573 just befor
the first sieg of leyden wa begun and here thei had dwelt for twelv
long doubt anxiou month new or rather rumour of what wa
pass in the netherland reach them from time to time twice even
there came letter from foi himself but the last of these had been
receiv mani week ago just as the iron grip of the second leaguer wa
close round the citi then foi and martin so thei learn from the
letter were not in the town but with the princ of orang in delft
work hard at the fleet which wa be built and arm for it
relief
after thi there wa a long silenc and none could tell what had
happen although a horribl report reach them that leyden had been
taken sack and burnt and all it inhabit massacr thei live
in comfort here in norwich for the firm of munt and brown dirk van
goorl agent were honest and the fortun which he had sent over
when the cloud were gather thick had been well invest by them
and produc an ampl revenu but what comfort could there be for their
poor heart thu agonis by doubt and sicken fear
on even thei sat in the parlour on the ground floor of the hous or
rather lysbeth sat for elsa knelt by her her head rest upon the arm
of the chair and wept
oh it is cruel she sob it is too much to bear how can you be
so calm mother when perhap foi is dead
if my son is dead elsa that is god will and i am calm becaus
now as mani a time befor i resign myself to the will of god
not becaus i do not suffer mother can feel girl as well as
sweetheart
would that i had never left him moan elsa
you ask to leav child for my part i should have bide the best or
the worst in leyden
it is true it is becaus i am a coward also he wish it
he wish it elsa therefor it is for the best let us await the
issu in patienc come our meal is set
thei sat themselv down to eat these two lone women but at their
board were laid four cover as though thei expect guest yet none
were biddenonli thi wa elsa fanci
foi and martin might come she said and be vex if it seem that
we did not expect them so for the last three month or more she had
alwai set four cover at the tabl and lysbeth did not gainsai her in
her heart she too hope that foi might come
that veri night foi came and with him red martin the great sword
silenc still strap about hi middl
hark said lysbeth suddenli i hear my son footstep at the door
it seem elsa that after all the ear of a mother ar quicker than
those of a lover
but elsa never heard her for nownow at length she wa wrap in
the arm of foi the same foi but grown older and with a long pale scar
across hi forehead
yet went on lysbeth to herself with a faint smile on her white and
state face the son lip ar for the lover first
an hour later or two or three for who reckon time that night when
there wa so much to hear and tell while the other knelt befor her
foi and elsa hand in hand and behind them martin like a guardian giant
lysbeth put up her even prayer of prais and thanksgiv
almighti god she said in her slow sonor voic thy aw hand
that by my own faithless sin took from me my husband hath given back
hi son and mine who shall be to thi child a husband and for us as for
our countri over sea out of the night of desol is arisen a dawn of
peac abov us throughout the year is thy everlast will beneath
us when our year ar done shall by thy everlast arm so for the
bitter and the sweet for the evil and the good for the past and for
the present we thy servant render thee glori thank and prais o
god of our father that fashioneth us and all accord to thy desir
rememb those thing which we have forgotten and foreknow
those thing which ar not yet therefor to thee who through so mani
dread dai hast led us to thi hour of joi be glori and thank o
lord of the live and the dead amen
and the other echo to thee be glori and thank o lord of the live
and the dead amen
then their prayer end the live rose and with separ done
and fear appeas at last leant toward each other in the love and
hope of their beauti youth
but lysbeth sat silent in the new home far from the land where she wa
born and turn her stricken heart toward the dead
