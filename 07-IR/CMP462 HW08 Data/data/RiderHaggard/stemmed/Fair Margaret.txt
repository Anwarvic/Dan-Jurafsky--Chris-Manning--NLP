how peter met the spaniard
it wa a spring afternoon in the sixth year of the reign of king henri
vii of england there had been a great show in london for that dai hi
grace open the newli conven parliament and announc to hi
faith peoplewho receiv the new with much cheer sinc war is
ever popular at firsthi intent of invad franc and of lead
the english armi in person in parliament itself it is true the
gener enthusiasm wa somewhat dash when allus wa made to the
find of the need fund but the crowd without form for the
most part of person who would not be call upon to pai the monei did
not suffer that side of the question to troubl them so when their
graciou lieg appear surround by hi glitter escort of nobl
and menatarm thei threw their cap into the air and shout
themselv hoars
the king himself although he wa still young in year alreadi a weari
look man with a fine pinch face smile a littl sarcast at
their clamour but rememb how glad he should be to hear it who
still sat upon a somewhat doubt throne said a few soft word and
send for two or three of the leader of the peopl gave them hi
royal hand and suffer certain children to touch hi robe that thei
might be cure of the evil then have paus a while to receiv
petit from poor folk which he hand to on of hi offic to be
read amidst renew shout he pass on to the great feast that wa
made readi in hi palac of westminst
among those who rode near to him wa the ambassador de ayala
accredit to the english court by the spanish sovereign ferdinand and
isabella and hi follow of splendidli attir lord and secretari
that spain wa much in favour there wa evid from hi place in the
process how could it be otherwis inde see that alreadi four
year or more befor at the ag of twelv month princ arthur the
eldest son of the king had been formal affianc to the infanta
catherin daughter of ferdinand and isabella ag on year and nine
month for in those dai it wa thought well that the affect of
princ and princess should be direct earli into such path as their
royal parent and governor consid like to prove most profit
to themselv
at the ambassador left hand mount on a fine black hors and
dress richli but simpli in black velvet with a cap of the same
materi in which wa fasten a singl pearl rode a tall cavali he
wa about fiveandthirti year of ag and veri handsom have
pierc black ey and a stern cleancut face
in everi man it is said there can be found a resembl often far
off and fanci enough to some beast or bird or other creatur and
certainli in thi case it wa not hard to discov the man resembl an
eagl which whether by chanc or design wa the crest he bore upon
hi servant liveri and the trap of hi hors the unflinch
ey the hook nose the air of pride and masteri the thin long
hand the quick grace of movement all suggest that king of bird
suggest also as hi motto said that what he sought he would find
and what he found he would keep just now he wa watch the interview
between the english king and the leader of the crowd whom hi grace had
been pleas to summon with an air of mingl amus and contempt
you find the scene strang marqui said the ambassador glanc at
him shrewdli
seor here in england if it pleas your excel he answer
grave seor daguilar the marqui you mention live in spainan
accredit envoi to the moor of granada the seor daguilar a humbl
servant of holi church and he cross himself travel abroadupon
the church busi and that of their majesti
and hi own too sometim i believ answer the ambassador drili
but to be frank what i do not understand about you seor daguilar
as i know that you have abandon polit ambit is why you do not
enter my profess and put on the black robe onc and for all what
did i sayblack with your opportun and connect it might be
red by now with a hat to match
the seor daguilar smile a littl as he repli
you said i think that sometim i travel on my own busi well
there is your answer you ar right i have abandon worldli
ambitionsmost of them thei ar troublesom and for some peopl if
thei be born too high and yet not altogeth rightli veri danger
the acorn of ambit often grow into an oak from which men hang
or into a log upon which men head can be cut off seor i
congratul you you have the wisdom that grasp the substanc and let
the shadow flit it is realli veri rare
you ask why i do not chang the cut of my garment went on
daguilar without notic the interrupt excel to be frank
becaus of my own busi i have fail like other men for
instanc wealth is that substanc of which you spoke rule is the
shadow he who ha the wealth ha the real rule again bright ey mai
draw me or a hate mai seek it slake and these thing do not suit
robe black or red
yet mani such thing have been done by those who wore them repli
the ambassador with mean
ay excel to the discredit of holi church as you a priest
know better than most men let the earth be evil as it must but let the
church be like heaven abov it pure unstain the vault of prayer
the hous of merci and of righteou judgment wherein walk no sinner
such as i and again he cross himself
there wa a ring of earnest in the speaker voic that caus de
ayala who knew someth of hi privat reput to look at him
curious
a true fanat and therefor to us a us man he thought to
himself though on who know how to make the best of two world as
well as most of them but aloud he said no wonder that our church
rejoic in such a son and that her enemi trembl when he lift her
sword but seor you have not told me what you think of all thi
ceremoni and peopl
the peopl i know well excel for i dwelt among them in past
year and speak their languag and that is why i have left granada to
look after itself for a while and am here todai to watch and make
report he check himself then ad as for the ceremoni were i
a king i would have it otherwis why in that hous just now those
vulgar commonsfor so thei call them do thei notalmost threaten
their royal master when he humbl crave a tith of the countri wealth
to fight the countri war ye and i saw him turn pale and trembl at
the rough voic as though their echo shook hi throne i tell you
excel that the time will come in thi land when those common will
be king look now at that fellow whom hi grace hold by the hand
call him sir and master and yet whom he know to be as i do a
heret a jew in disguis whose sin if he had hi right should be
purg by fire why to my knowledg last night that israelit said
thing against the church
whereof the church or it servant doubtless made note to be us
when the time come broke in de ayala but the audienc is done and
hi high beckon us forward to the feast where there will be no
heret to vex us and as it is lent not much to eat come seor
for we stop the wai
three hour had gone by and the sun sank redli for even at that spring
season it wa cold upon the marshi land of westminst and there wa
frost in the air on the open space opposit to the banquetinghal in
front of which were gather squir and groom with hors stood and
walk mani citizen of london who their dai work done came to see
the king pass by in state among these were a man and a ladi the latter
attend by a handsom young woman who were all three suffici
strike in appear to attract some notic in the throng
the man a person of about thirti year of ag dress in a merchant
robe of cloth and wear a knife in hi girdl seem over six feet
in height while hi companion in her flow furtrim cloak wa
for a woman also of unusu statur he wa not strictli speak a
handsom man be somewhat too high of forehead and promin of
featur moreov on of hi cleanshaven cheek the right wa mar
by the long red scar of a swordcut which stretch from the templ to
the strong chin hi face howev wa open and manli if rather stern
and the grei ey were steadi and frank it wa not the face of a
merchant but rather that of on of good degre accustom to camp and
war for the rest hi figur wa wellbuilt and activ and hi voic
when he spoke which wa seldom clear and distinct to loud but
cultiv and pleasantagain not the voic of a merchant
of the ladi figur littl could be seen becaus of the long cloak that
hid it but the face which appear within it hood when she turn and
the dy sunlight fill her ey wa love inde for from her
birth to her deathdai margaret castellfair margaret as she wa
calledhad thi gift to a degre that is rare grant to woman
round and flowerlik wa that face most delic tint also
with rich and curv lip and a broad snowwhit brow but the wonder
of it what distinguish her abov everyth els from other beauti
women of her time wa to be found in her ey for these were not blue
or grei as might have been expect from her gener colour but
larg black and lustrou soft too as the ey of a deer and
overhung by curl lash of an ebon black the effect of these ey of
her shine abov those tint cheek and beneath the brow of ivori
white wa so strang as to be almost startl thei caught the
behold and held him as might the sudden sight of a rose in snow or
the morn star hang lumin among the mist of dawn also
although thei were so gentl and modest if that behold chanc to be
a man on the good side of fifti it wa often long befor he could forget
them especi if he were privileg to see how well thei match the
hair of chestnut shade into black that wave abov them and fell
tress upon tress upon the shape shoulder and down to the
slender waist
peter brome for he wa so name look a littl anxious about him at
the crowd then turn address margaret in hi strong clear voic
there ar rough folk around he said do you think you should stop
here your father might be anger cousin
here it mai be explain that in realiti their kinship wa of the
slightest a mere dash of blood that came to her through her mother
still thei call each other thu sinc it is a conveni titl that
mai mean much or noth
oh why not she answer in her rich slow tone that had in them
some foreign qualiti someth soft and sweet as the caress of a
southern wind at night with you cousin and she glanc approvingli
at hi stalwart soldierlik form i have noth to fear from men
howev rough and i do greatli want to see the king close by and so
doe betti dont you betti and she turn to her companion
betti dene whom she address wa also a cousin of margaret though
onli a distant connect of peter brome she wa of veri good blood
but her father a wild and dissolut man had broken her mother heart
and like that mother di earli leav betti depend upon
margaret mother in whose hous she had been brought up thi betti
wa in her wai remark both in bodi and mind fair splendidli
form strong with wide bold blue ey and ripe red lip such wa
the fashion of her in speech she wa careless and vigor fond of the

romant and vain betti at the ag of fiveandtwenti wa yet an
honest girl and well abl to take care of herself as more than on of
her admir had discov although her posit wa humbl at heart
she wa veri proud of her lineag ambiti also her great desir
be to rais herself by marriag back to the station from which her

you can find the word take a lesson from that spanish don and scrape
and bow and flatter and tell stori of the war and turn vers to her
ey and hair oh peter ar you a fool that i at my ag should have
to teach you how to court a woman
mayhap sir at least i can do none of these thing and poesi weari
me to read much more to write but i can ask a question and take
an answer
castel shook hi head impati
ask the question man if you will but never take the answer if it is
against you wait rather and ask it again
and went on peter without notic hi grei ey light with a
sudden fire if need be i can break that fine spaniard bone as
though he were a twig
ah said castel perhap you will be call upon to make your word
good befor all is done for my part i think hi bone will take some
break well ask in your own wayonli ask and let me hear the answer
befor tomorrow night now it grow late and i have still someth to

as he spoke the door at the far end of the hall open and through it
came that servingman who had been bidden to follow the spaniard
well said castel what tide
the man bow and said
i follow the don as you bade me to hi lodg which i reach
without hi see me though from time to time he stop to look about
him he rest near the palac of westminst in the same big hous
where dwell the ambassador de ayala and those who stood round lift
their bonnet to him

all night and follow them there call for a drink and listen to
their talk who know the spanish tongu well have work for five
year in your worship hous at sevil thei spoke of the frai
tonight and said that if thei could catch that longleg fellow
mean master brome yonder thei would put a knife into him sinc he

the best swordsman in their compani with a staff and then set hi
british bulldog on them i fell into talk with them sai that i wa
an english sailor from spain which thei were too drunk to question and
ask who might be the tall don who had interf in the frai befor
the king came thei told me he is a rich seor name daguilar but ill
to serv in lent becaus he is so strict a churchman although not
strict in other matter i answer that to me he look like a great
nobl whereon on of them said that i wa right that there wa no
blood in spain higher than hi but unfortun there wa a bend in
it stream also an inkpot had been upset into it
what doe that mean ask peter

is born illegitim and ha moorish blood in hi vein
then i ask what he wa do here and the man answer that i had
best put that question to the holi father and to the queen of spain
lastli after i had given the soldier anoth cup i ask where the don
live and whether he had ani other name he repli that he live at
granada for the most part and that if i call on him there i should
see some pretti ladi and other nice thing as for hi name it wa
the marqui of nichel i said that meant marqui of noth whereon the
soldier answer that i seem veri curiou and that wa just what he
meant to tell menoth also he call to hi comrad that he

drunk enough to do me a mischief
good said castel you ar watchman tonight thoma ar you not
see that all door ar bar so that we mai sleep without fear of
spanish thiev rest you well peter nai i do not come yet i have
letter to send to spain by the ship which sail tomorrow night
when peter had gone john castel extinguish all the lamp save on
thi he took in hi hand and pass from the hall into an apart that
in old dai when thi wa a nobl hous had been the privat chapel
there wa an altar in it and over the altar a crucifix for a few
moment castel knelt befor the altar for even now at dead of night
how knew he what ey might watch him then he rose and lamp in hand
glide behind it lift some tapestri and press a spring in the
panel beneath it open reveal a small secret chamber built in
the thick of the wall and without window a mere cupboard that onc
perhap had been a place where a priest might robe or keep the
sacr vessel
in thi chamber wa a plain oak tabl on which stood candl and an ark
of wood also some roll of parchment befor thi tabl he knelt down
and put up earnest prayer to the god of abraham for although hi
father had caus him to be baptiz into the christian church as a
child john castel remain a jew for thi good reason then he wa
so much afraid know that although hi daughter and peter knew
noth of hi secret there were other who did and that were it
reveal ruin and perhap death would be hi portion and that of hi
hous sinc in those dai there wa no greater crime than to ador god
otherwis than holi church allow yet for mani year he had taken the
risk and worship on as hi father did befor him
hi prayer finish he left the place close the springdoor behind
him and pass to hi offic where he sat till the morn light
first write a letter to hi correspond at sevil and then
painfulli translat it into cipher by aid of a secret kei hi task
done and the cipher letter seal and direct he burn the draft
extinguish hi lamp and go to the window watch the rise of
the sun in the garden beneath blackbird sang and the pale primros
were abloom
i wonder he said aloud whether when those flower come again i
shall live to see them almost i feel as though the rope were tighten
about my throat at last it came upon me while that accurs spaniard
cross himself at my tabl well so be it i will hide the truth while
i can but if thei catch me ill not deni it the monei is safe most of
it my wealth thei shall never get and now i will make my daughter safe
also as with peter she must be i would i had not put it off so long
but i hanker after a great marriag for her which be a christian
she well might make ill mend that fault befor tomorrow morn she
shall be plight to him and befor maydai hi wife god of my
father give us on month more of peac and safeti and then becaus i
have deni thee openli take my life in payment if thou wilt
befor john castel went to bed peter wa alreadi awakeinde he had
slept but littl that night how could he sleep whose fortun had
chang thu wondrous between sun set and rise yesterdai he wa but a
merchant assistanta poor trade for on who had been train to arm
and born them brave todai he wa a gentleman again owner of the
broad land where he wa bred and that had been hi forefath for
mani a gener yesterdai he wa a lover without hope for in himself
he had never believ that the rich john castel would suffer him a
landless man to pai court to hi daughter on of the loveliest and
wealthiest maid in london he had ask hi leav in past dai and
been refus as he had expect that he would be refus and
thenceforward be on hi honour as it were he had said no tender
word to margaret nor press her hand nor even look into her ey
and sigh yet at time it had seem to him that she would not have
been illpleas if he had done on of these thing or all that she
wonder inde that he did not and thought none the better of him
for hi abstin moreov now he learn that her father wonder
also and thi wa a strang reward of virtu
for peter love margaret with heart and soul and bodi sinc he a lad
had plai with her a child he love her and no other woman she wa
hi thought by dai and hi dream by night hi hope hi etern star
heaven he pictur as a place where for ever he would be with margaret
earth without her could be noth but a hell that wa why he had
stai on in castel shop bend hi proud neck to thi tradesman
yoke do the bid and take the rough word of chapmen and of
lordli custom fill in bill of exchang and cheapen bargain
all without a sign or murmur though oftentim he felt as though hi
gorg would burst with loath of the life inde that wa why he had
come there at all who otherwis would have been far awai hew a road
to fame and fortun or dig out a grave with hi broadsword for
here at least he could be near to margaret could touch her hand at morn
and even could watch the light shine in her beauteou ey and
sometim as she bent over him feel her breath upon hi hair and now
hi purgatori wa at an end and of a sudden the gate of joi were open
but what if margaret should prove the angel with the flame sword who
forbad him entranc to hi paradis he trembl at the thought well
if so so it must be he wa not the man to forc her fanci or call her
father to hi aid he would do hi best to win her and if he fail
why then he would bless her and let her go
peter could lie ab no longer but rose and dress himself although
the dawn wa not fulli come by hi open window he said hi prayer
thank god for merci past and prai that he would bless him in
hi great empris present the sun rose and there came a great
long on him to be alon in the countrysid he who wa countryborn
and hate town with onli the sky and the bird and the tree
for compani
but here in london wa no countri wherev he went he would meet men
moreov he rememb that it might be best that just now he should
not wander through the street unguard lest he should find spaniard
watch to take him unawar well there wa the garden he would go
thither and walk a while so he descend the broad oak stair and
unbolt a door enter thi garden which though not too well kept
wa larg for london cover an acr of ground perhap surround by
a high wall and have walk and at the end of it a group of ancient
elm beneath which wa a seat hidden from the hous in summer thi wa
margaret favourit bower for she too love natur and the land and
all the thing it bore inde thi garden wa her joi and the flower
that grew there were for the most part of her own plantingprimros
snowdrop violet and in the shadow of the tree long
hartstongu fern
for a while peter walk up and down the central path and as it
chanc margaret who also had risen earli and not slept too well
look through her window curtain saw him wander there and
wonder what he did at thi hour also why he wa dress in the
cloth he wore on sundai and holidai perhap she thought hi
weekdai garment had been torn or muddi in last night frai then she
fell to think how brave he had born him in that frai she saw it
all again the great redhead rascal toss up and whirl to the
earth by hi strong arm saw peter face that gleam steel with
noth but a staff saw the straight blow fall and the fellow go
reel to the earth slain with a singl stroke
ah her cousin peter brome wa a man inde though a strang on and
rememb certain thing that did not pleas her she shrug her
ivori shoulder turn red and pout why that spaniard had said
more civil word to her in an hour than had peter in two year and he
wa handsom and noblelook also but then the spaniard wasa
spaniard and other men wereoth men wherea peter waspet a
creatur apart on who care as littl for women as he did for trade
why then if he care for neither women nor trade did he stop here
she wonder to gather wealth she did not think it he seem to have
no lean that wai either it wa a mysteri still she could wish to
get to the bottom of peter heart just to see what wa hid there
sinc no man ha a right to be a riddl to hi love cousin ye and
on dai she would do it cost what it might
meanwhil she rememb that she had never thank peter for the brave
part which he had plai and inde had left him to walk home with
betti a journei that as she gather from her sprightli cousin talk
while she undress her neither of them had much enjoi for betti be
it said here wa angri with peter who it seem onc had told her
that she wa a handsom silli fool who thought too much of men and too
littl of her busi well sinc after the dai work had begun she
would find no opportun she would go down and thank peter now and
see if she could make him talk for onc
so margaret threw her furtrim cloak about her draw it hood over
her head for the april air wa cold and follow peter into the
garden when she reach it howev there wa no peter to be seen
whereon she reproach herself for have come to that damp place so
earli and medit return then think that it would look foolish if
ani had chanc to see her she walk down the path pretend to seek
for violet and found none thu she came to the group of great elm at
the end and glanc between their ancient bole saw peter stand
there now too she understood why she could find no violet for peter
had gather them all and wa engag awkwardli enough in try to
tie them and some leav into a littl posi by the help of a stem of
grass with hi left hand he held the violet with hi right on end of
the grass and sinc he lack finger to clasp the other thi he
attempt with hi teeth now he drew it tight and now the brittl
grass stem broke the violet were scatter and peter us word that
he should not have utter even when alon
i knew you would break it but i never thought you could lose your
temper over so small a thing peter said margaret and he in the
shadow look up to see her stand there in the sunlight fresh and
love as the spring itself
solemnli in sever reproof she shook her head from which the hood had
fallen back but there wa a smile upon her lip and laughter in her
ey oh she wa beauti and at the sight of her peter heart stood
still then rememb what he had just said and certain other thing
that master castel had said he blush so deepli that her own cheek
went red in sympathi it wa foolish but she could not help it for
about peter thi morn there wa someth strang someth that
bred blush
for whom ar you gather violet so earli she ask when you
ought to be prai for that scotchman soul
i care noth for hi soul answer peter testili if the brute had
on he can look after it himself and i wa gather the
violetsfor you
she stare peter wa not in the habit of make her present of
flower no wonder he had look strang
then i will help you to tie them do you know why i am up so earli it
is for your sake i behav badli to you last night for i wa cross
becaus you want to thwart me about see the king i never thank
you for all you did you brave peter though i thank you enough in my
heart do you know that when you stood there with that sword in the
middl of those englishmen you look quit nobl come out into the
sunlight and i will thank you properli
in hi agit peter let the remaind of the flower fall then an
idea struck him and he answer
look i cant if you ar realli grate for noth at all come in
here and help me to pick up these violetsa pest on their
short stalk
she hesit a littl then by degre drew nearer and bend down
began to find the flower on by on peter had scatter them wide so
that at first the pair were some wai apart but when onli a few
remain thei drew close now there wa but on violet left and both
stretch for it their hand met margaret held the violet and peter
held margaret finger thu link thei straighten themselv and
as thei rose their face were veri near togeth and oh most sweet were
margaret wonder ey while in the ey of peter there shone a
flame for a second thei look at each other and then of a sudden he

simpl childlik faith that the power which had brought them togeth
and taught them to love each other would bless them in that love and
protect them from all harm enemi and evil through mani a long

tempest and of rain apprehens got a hold of them thei were both
afraid of what thei could not guess
come she said it is time to go in my father will miss us
so without more word or endear thei rose and walk side by side
out of the shelter of the elm into the open garden their head were
bent for thei were lost in thought and thu it came about that
margaret saw her feet pass suddenli into the shadow of a man and

quick ey then turn the subject and ask if he would not breakfast
with them he declin howev sai that he must be about their

into holborn for it had pleas him to pai thi visit on foot and
unattend at the corner whom should he meet again but the tall
fairhair betti return from some errand which she had found it
conveni to fulfil just then
what he said you onc more the saint ar veri kind to me thi
morn come seora walk a littl wai with me for i would ask you a
few question
betti hesit then gave wai it wa seldom that she found the chanc
of walk through holborn with such a noblelook cavali
never look at your workingdress he said
with such a shape what matter the robe that cover ita compliment
at which betti blush for she wa proud of her fine figur
would you like a mantilla of real spanish lace for your head and
shoulder well you shall have on that i brought from spain with me
for i know no other ladi in the land whom it would becom better but
mistress betti you told me wrong about your master i went to the
chapel and he wa not there
he wa there seor she answer eager to set herself right with
thi most agreeabl and discrimin foreign for i saw him go in a
moment befor and he did not come out again
then seora where could he have hidden himself ha the place a
crypt
none that i have heard of but she ad there is a kind of littl
room behind the altar
inde how do you know that i saw no room
becaus on dai i heard a voic behind the tapestri seor and
lift it saw a slide door left open and master castel kneel
befor a tabl and sai hi prayer aloud
how strang and what wa there on the tabl
onli a queershap box of wood like a littl hous and two
candlestick and some roll of parchment but i forgot seor i
promis master castel to sai noth about that place for he turn
and saw me and came at me like a watchdog out of it kennel you wont
sai that i told you will you seor
not i your good master privat cupboard doe not interest me now i
want to know someth more why is that beauti cousin of your not
marri ha she no suitor
suitor seor ye plenti of them but she send them all about their
busi and seem to have no mind that wai
perhap she is in love with her cousin that longleg strongarm
woodenhead master brome
oh no seor i dont think so no ladi could be in love with himh
is too stern and silent
i agre with you seora then perhap he is in love with her
betti shook her head and repli
peter brome doesnt think anyth of women seor at least he never
speak to or of them
which show that probabl he think about them all the more well
well it is no affair of our is it onli i am glad to hear that there
is noth between them sinc your mistress ought to marri high and be
a great ladi not a mere merchant wife
ye seor though peter brome is not a merchant at least by birth he
is highborn and should be sir peter brome if hi father had not fought
on the wrong side and sold hi land he is a soldier and a veri brave
on thei sai as all might see last night
no doubt and perhap would make a great captain if he had the chanc
with hi stern face and silent tongu but seora betti sai how come
it that be so handsom and he bow you ar not marri either
i am sure it can be from no lack of suitor
again betti foolish girl flush with pleasur at the compliment
you ar right seor she answer i have plenti of them but i am
like my cousinthei do not pleas me although my father lost hi
fortun i come of good blood and i suppos that is why i do not care
for these lowborn men and would rather remain as i am than marri
on of them
you ar quit right said daguilar in hi sympathet voic do not
stain your blood marri in your own class or not at all which inde
should not be difficult for on so beauti and charm and he
look into her larg ey with tender admir
thi qualiti inde soon began to demonstr itself so activ for
thei were now in the field where few peopl wander that betti who
although vain wa proud and upright thought it wise to recollect that
she must be turn homeward so in spite of hi protest she left
him and depart walk upon air
how splendid and handsom thi foreign gentleman wa she thought to
herself realli a great cavali and sure he admir her truli why
should he not such thing had often been mani a rich ladi whom she
knew wa not half so handsom or so well born as herself and would make
him a wors wifethat is and the thought chill her somewhatif he
were not alreadi marri
from all of which it will be seen that daguilar had quickli succeed
in the plan which onli present itself to him a few hour befor betti
wa alreadi half in love with him not that he had ani desir to possess
thi beauti but foolish woman heart who saw in her onli a us
tool a steppingston by mean of which he might draw near to margaret
for with margaret it mai be said at onc he wa quit in love at the
sight of her sweet yet imperi beauti as he saw her first
dishevel angri frighten in the crowd outsid the king
banquetinghal hi southern blood had taken sudden fire finish
voluptuari though he wa the sensat he experienc then wa quit
new to him he long for thi woman as he had never long for ani
other and what is more he desir to make her hi wife why not
although there wa a flaw in it hi rank wa high and therefor she
wa beneath him but for thi her loveli would aton and she had
wit and learn enough to fill ani place that he could give her also
great as wa hi wealth hi wanton spendthrift wai of life had brought
him mani debt and she wa the onli child of on of the richest
merchant in england whose dower doubtless would be a fortun that
mani a royal princess might envi why not again he would turn inez and
those other adriftat ani rate for a whileand make her mistress of
hi palac there in granada instantli as is often the fashion of those
who have eastern blood in their vein daguilar had made up hi mind
ye befor he left her father tabl on the previou night he would
marri margaret and no other woman
yet at onc he had seen mani difficulti in hi path to begin with he
mistrust him of peter that strong quiet man who could kill a great
arm knave with hi stick and at a word call half london to hi side
peter he wa sure be human must be in love with margaret and he
wa a rival to be fear well if margaret had no thought of peter
thi matter noth and if she hadand what were thei do togeth
in the garden that morningpet must be got rid of that wa all it
wa easi enough if he chose to adopt certain mean there were mani of
those spanish fellow who would not mind stick a knife into hi back
in the dark
but sin as he wa at such step hi conscienc halt whatev
daguilar had done he had never caus a man to be actual murder
he who wa a bigot who aton for hi misdo by period of remors
and prayer in which he place hi purs and talent at the servic of
the church as he wa do at thi moment no murder must not be
thought of for how could ani absolut wash him clean of that stain
but there were other wai for instanc had not thi peter in
selfdef it is true kill on of the servant of an ambassador of
spain perhap howev it would not be necessari to make us of them
it had seem to him that the ladi wa not ill pleas with him and
after all he had much to offer he would court her fairli and if he
were reject by her or by her father then it would be time enough to
act meanwhil he would keep the sword hang over the head of peter
pretend that it wa he alon who had prevent it from fall and
learn all that he could as to castel and hi histori
here inde fortun in the shape of the foolish betti had favour
him without a doubt as he had heard in spain and been sure from the
moment that he first saw him castel wa still secretli a jew mistress
betti stori of the room behind the altar with the ark and the candl
and the roll of the law prove as much at least here wa evid
enough to send him to the fire of the inquisit in spain and
perhap to drive him out of england now if john castel the spanish
jew should not wish for ani reason to give him hi daughter in
marriag would not a hint and an extract from the commiss of their
majesti of spain and the holi father suffic to make him chang
hi mind
thu ponder daguilar regain hi lodg where hi first task
wa to enter in a book all that betti had told him and all that he had
observ in the hous of john castel
chapter v
castel secret
in john castel hous it wa the habit as in most other in those
dai for hi depend clerk and shopmen to eat their morn and
middai meal with him in the hall seat at two lower tabl all of
them save betti hi daughter cousin and companion who sat with them

ask where she might bea question that neither margaret nor peter
could answer

a cautiou man also went on castel with a twinkl in hi ey who
rememb that women have been known to chang their mind within an
hour after such long thought what sai you now margaret
that i am angri with peter she answer stamp her small foot
for if he doe not trust me for an hour how can he trust me for hi

your troth and my children i am glad of it for who know when those
tear of which margaret spoke mai come and then you can wipe awai each
other take now her hand peter and swear by the rood that symbol
which you worshipher peter glanc at him but he went onswear
both of you that come what mai togeth or separ through good
report or evil report through poverti or wealth through peac or
persecut through temptat or through blood through everi good or
ill that can befal you in thi world of bittersweet you will remain
faith to your troth until you be wed and after you ar wed faith
to each other till death do part you
these word he spoke to them in a voic that wa earnest almost to
passion search their face the while with hi quick ey as though
he would read their veri heart hi mood crept from him to them onc
again thei felt someth of that fear which had fallen on them in the
garden when thei pass into the shadow of the spaniard veri solemnli
then and with littl of true lover joi did thei take each other
hand and swear by the cross and him who hung on it that through these
thing and all other thei could not foretel thei would if need
were be faith to the death
and beyond it also ad peter while margaret bow her state head
in sweet assent
children said castel you will be richfew richer in thi
landthough mayhap it would be wise that you should not show all your
wealth at onc or ap the place of a great hous lest envi should fall
upon your head and crush you be content to wait and rank will find
you in it season or if not you your children peter i tell you now
lest i should forget it that the list of all my monei and other
possess in chattel or land or ship or merchandis is buri
beneath the floor of my offic just under where my chair stand lift
the board and dig awai a foot of rubbish and you will find a stone
trap and below an iron box with the deed inventori and some veri
preciou jewel also if by ani mischanc that box should be lost
duplic of nearli all these paper ar in the hand of my good friend
and partner in our inland british trade simon levett whom you know
rememb my word both of you
father broke in margaret in an anxiou voic why do you speak of
the futur thusi mean as though you had no share in it do you
fear aught
ye daughter much or rather i expect i do not fear who am
prepar and desir to meet all thing as thei come you have sworn that
oath have you not and you will keep it will you not
ay thei answer with on breath
then prepar you to feel the weight of the first of those trial
whereof it speak for i will no longer hold back the truth from you
children i whom for all these year you have thought of your own
faith am a jew as my forefath were befor me back to the dai
of abraham
the effect of thi declar upon it hearer wa remark peter
jaw drop and for the second time that dai hi face went white while
margaret sank down into a chair that stood near by and stare at him
helplessli in those time it wa a veri terribl thing to be a jew
castel look from on to the other and feel the insult of their
silenc grew angri
what he exclaim in a bitter voic ar you like all the other do
you scorn me also becaus i am of a race more ancient and honour
than those of ani of your mushroom lord and king you know my life
sai what have i done wrong have i caught christian children and
crucifi them to death have i defraud my neighbour or oppress the
poor have i mock your symbol of the host have i conspir against
the ruler of thi land have i been a fals friend or a cruel father
you shake your head then why do you stare at me as though i were a
thing accurs and unclean have i not a right to the faith of my
father mai i not worship god in my own fashion and he look at
peter a challeng in hi ey sir answer peter without a
doubt you mai or so it seem to me but then why for all these year
have you appear to worship him in our
at thi blunt question so characterist of the speaker castel seem
to shrink like a pinprick bladder or some bold fighter who ha
suddenli receiv a swordthrust in hi vital all courag went out of
the man hi fieri ey grew tame he appear to becom visibl
smaller and to put on someth of the air of those mendic of hi
own race who whine out their woe and beg alm of the passerbi when
next he spoke it wa as a suppliant for merci judgment at the hand
of hi own child and her lover
judg me not harshli he said think what it is to be a jewan
outcast a thing that the lowest mai spurn and spit at on beyond the
law on who can be hunt from land to land like a mad wolf and
tortur to death when caught for the sport of gentl christian who
first have strip him of hi gain and veri garment and then think
what it mean to escap all these woe and terror and by the dof
of a bonnet and the mumbl of certain prayer with the lip in
public to find sanctuari peac and protect within the wall of
mother church and thu foster to grow rich and great
he paus as though for a repli but as thei did not speak went on
moreov as a child i wa baptiz into your church but my heart
like that of my father remain with the jew and where the heart goe
the feet follow
that make it wors said peter as though speak to himself
my father taught me thu castel went on as though plead hi case
befor a court of law
we must answer for our own sin said peter again
then at length castel took fire
you young folk who as yet know littl of the terror of the world
reproach me with cold look and colder word he said but i wonder
should you ever come to such a pass as mine whether you will find the
heart to meet it half as brave why do you think that i have told you
thi secret that i might have kept from you as i kept it from your
mother margaret i sai becaus it is a part of my penanc for the sin
which i have sin ay i know well that my god is a jealou god and
that thi sin will fall back on my head and that i shall pai it price
to the last groat though when and how the blow will strike me i know
not go you peter or you margaret and denounc me if you will your
priest will speak well of you for the deed and open to you a shorter
road to heaven and i shall not blame you nor lessen your wealth by a
singl golden nobl
do not speak so madli sir said peter these matter ar between you
and god what have we to do with them and who made us judg over you
we onli prai that your fear mai come to noth and that you mai reach
your grave in peac and honour
i thank you for your gener word which ar such as befit your
natur said castel gentli but what sai margaret
i father she answer wildli oh i have noth to sai he is
right it is between you and god but it is hard that i must lose my
love so soon peter look up and castel answer
lose him why what did he swear but now
i care not what he swore but how can i ask him who is of nobl
christian birth to marri the daughter of a jew who all hi life ha
pass himself off as a worshipp of that jesu whom he deni
now peter held up hi hand
have done with such talk he said were your father juda himself
what is that to you and me you ar mine and i am your till death part
us nor shall the faith of anoth man stand between us for an hour
sir we thank you for your confid and of thi be sure that
although it make us sorrow we do not love or honour you the less
becaus now we know the truth
margaret rose from her chair look a while at her father then with a
sob threw herself suddenli upon hi breast
forgiv me if i spoke bitterli she said who not know that i wa
half a jewess have been taught to hate their race what is it to me of
what faith you ar who think of you onli as my dearest father
why weep then ask castel stroke her hair tenderli
becaus you ar in danger or so you sai and if anyth happen to
youoh what shall i do then
accept it as the will of god and bear the blow brave as i hope to
do should it fall he answer and kiss her left the chapel
it seem that joi and troubl go hand in hand said margaret look
up present
ye sweet thei were ever twin but provid we have our share of the
first do not let us quarrel with the second a pest on the priest and
all their bigotri sai i christ sought to convert the jew not to kill
them and for my part i can honour the man who cling to hi own faith

peter hesit misdoubt him of the wisdom of thi displai who if

tavern and receiv him in sober garment to a simpl meal
but castel who seem somewhat disturb that night who love
moreov to show hi wealth at time after the fashion of a jew began
to fume and ask if he must go himself so the end of it wa that peter
went shake hi head while urg to it by her father margaret
depart also to arrai herself
a few minut later castel in hi costliest feastdai robe greet
daguilar in the antehal and the two of them be alon ask him
how matter went as regard de ayala and the man who had been kill
well and ill answer daguilar doctor de puebla with whom i hope

i thank you for your courtesi seor you shall have the gold befor
you leav thi hous few would have trust a stranger thu far
daguilar wave hi hand
make no mention of such a trifl i would ask you to accept it as a
token of my regard for your famili onli that would be to affront so
wealthi a man but listen i have more to sai you ar or rather your
kinsman peter is still in the wood de ayala ha pardon him but
there remain the king of england whose law he ha broken well thi
dai i have seen the king who by the wai talk of you as a worthi
man sai that he had alwai thought onli a jew could be so wealthi
and that he knew you were not sinc you had been report to him as a
good son of the church and he paus look at castel
i fear hi grace magnifi my wealth which is but small answer
castel coolli leav the rest of hi speech unnot but what said
hi grace
i show him de ayala receipt and he answer that if hi excel
wa satisfi he wa satisfi and for hi part would not order ani
process to issu but he bade me tell you and peter brome that if he

especi if that tumult were between english and spaniard he would
hang him at onc with trial or without it all of which he said veri
angrili for the last thing which hi high desir just now is ani
nois between spain and england
that is bad answer castel for thi veri morn there wa near
to be such a tumult and he told the stori of how the two spaniard
had waylaid peter and on of them been knock down by the servingman
with a stone at thi new daguilar shook hi head
then that is just where the troubl li he exclaim i know it

virgin of sevil that befor thei leav thi land thei will have your

gold stud with smaller pearl from beneath which her gloriou
chestnutblack hair flow down in rippl wave almost to her knee
have her father bid so to do she had adorn herself thu that
she might look her fairest not in the ey of their guest but in those

now the light of the silver lamp she held on high flow over the two of
them daguilar and margaret and certainli thei seem a wellmatch
pair both were tall and cast by natur in a rich and splendid mould
both had that high air of breed which come with ancient bloodfor
what blood ar more ancient than those of the jew and the
easternboth were slow and state of movement lowvoic and
dignifi of speech castel note it and wa afraid he knew not
of what
peter enter the room by anoth door clad onli in hi grei cloth
for he would not put on gai garment for the spaniard note it also
and with the quick instinct of love knew thi magnific foreign for
a rival and an enemi but he wa not afraid onli jealou and angri
inde noth would have pleas him better then than that the
spaniard should have struck him in the face so that within five minut
it might be shown which of them wa the better man it must come to
thi he felt and veri glad would he have been if it could come at the
begin and not at the end so that on or the other of them might be
save much troubl then he rememb that he had promis to sai or
show noth of how thing stood between him and margaret and come
forward he greet daguilar quietli but coldli tell him that hi
hors had been stabl and hi retinu accommod
the spaniard thank him veri heartili and thei pass in to supper it
wa a strang meal for all four of them yet outwardli pleasant enough
forget hi care castel drank gaili and began to talk of the mani
chang which he had seen in hi life and of the rise and fall of
king daguilar talk also of the spanish war and polici for in the
first he had seen much servic and of the other he knew everi turn it

she answer daguilar is a great woman who know how to us the
temper of her time and so attain her end to the world she show a
tender heart but beneath it li hid an iron resolut
what ar those end ask margaret again
to bring all spain under her rule utterli to crush the moor and take
their territori to make the church of christ triumphant upon earth
to stamp out heresi to convert or destroi the jew he ad slowli
and as he spoke the word peter watch saw hi ey open and
glitter like a snakesto bring their bodi to the purifi flame
and their vast wealth into her treasuri and thu earn the prais of the
faith upon earth and for herself a throne in heaven
for a while there wa silenc after thi speech then margaret said
boldli
if heavenli throne ar built of human blood and tear what stone and
mortar do thei us in hell i wonder then without paus for an
answer she rose sai that she wa weari curtsei to daguilar her
father and peter each in turn and left the hall
when she had gone the talk flag and present daguilar ask for
hi men and hors and depart also sai as he went
friend castel you will repeat my new to your good kinsman here i
prai for all your sake that he mai bow hi head to what cannot be
help and thu keep it safe upon hi shoulder
what meant the man ask peter when the sound of the hors hoof
had di awai
castel told him of what had pass between him and daguilar befor
supper and show him de ayala receipt ad in a vex voic
i have forgotten to repai him the gold it shall be sent tomorrow
have no fear he will come for it answer peter coldli now if i
have my wai i will take the risk of these spaniard sword and king
henri rope and bide here
that you must not do said castel earnestli for my sake and
margaret if not for your would you make her a widow befor she is a
wife listen it is my wish that you travel down to essex to take
deliveri of your father land in the vale of dedham and see to the
repair of the mansion hous which i am told need it much then
when these spaniard ar gone you can return and at onc be marri
sai on short month henc
will not you and margaret come with me to dedham
castel shook hi head
it is not possibl i must wind up my affair and margaret cannot go
with you alon moreov there is no place for her to lodg i will
keep her here till you return
ye sir but will you keep her safe the cozen word of spaniard
ar sometim more deadli than their sword
i think that margaret ha a medicin against all such art answer
her father with a littl smile and left him
on the morrow when castel told margaret that her lover must leav her
for a while that nightfor thi peter would not do himselfsh prai
him even with tear that he would not send him so far from her or that
thei might all go togeth but he reason with her kindli show her
that the latter wa imposs and that if peter did not go at onc it
wa probabl that peter would soon be dead wherea if he went there
would be but on short month of wait till the spaniard had sail
after which thei might be marri and live in peac and safeti
so she came to see that thi wa best and wisest and gave wai but oh
heavi were those hour and sore wa their part essex wa no far
journei and to enter into land which onli two dai befor peter
believ he had lost for ever no sad errand while the promis that at
the end of a singl month he should return to claim hi bride hung
befor them like a star yet thei were sadheart both of them and
that star seem veri far awai
margaret wa afraid lest peter might be waylaid upon the road but he
laugh at her sai that her father wa send six stout men with
him as an escort and thu companion he fear no spaniard peter
for hi part wa afraid lest daguilar might make love to her while he
wa awai but now she laugh at him sai that all her heart wa hi
and that she had none to give to daguilar or ani other man moreov
that england wa a free land in which women who were no king ward
could not be led whither thei did not wish to go so it seem that thei
had naught to fear save the daili chanc of life and death and yet
thei were afraid
dear love said margaret to him after she had thought a while our
road look straight and easi and yet there mai be pitfal in it that
we cannot guess therefor you must swear on thing to me that whatev
you shall hear or whatev mai happen you will never doubt me as i
shall never doubt you if for instanc you should be told that i have
discard you and given myself to some other husband if even you
should believ that you see it sign by my hand or if you think that
you hear it told to you by my voicestil i sai believ it not
how could such a thing be ask peter anxious
i do not suppos that it could be i onli paint the worst that might
happen as a lesson for us both heretofor my life ha been calm as a
summer dai but who know when winter storm mai rise and often i
have thought that i wa born to know wind and rain and lightn as well
as peac and sunshin rememb that my father is a jew and that to the
jew and their children terribl thing chanc at time why all thi
wealth might vanish in an hour and you might find me in a prison or
clad in rag beg my bread now do you swear and she held toward
him the gold crucifix that hung upon her bosom
ay he said i swear it by thi holi token and by your lip and he
kiss first the cross and then her mouth ad shall i ask the same
oath of you
she laugh
if you will but it is not need peter i think that i know you too
well i think that your heart will never stir even if i be dead and you
marri to anoth and yet men ar men and women have wile so i will
swear thi that should you slip perchanc and i live to learn it i
will try not to judg you harshli and again she laugh she who wa
so certain of her empir over thi man heart and bodi
thank you said peter but for my part i will try to stand straight
upon my feet so should ani tale be brought to you of me sift them
well i prai you
then forget their doubt and dread thei talk of their marriag
which thei fix for that dai month and of how thei would dwell happili
in dedham vale also margaret who well knew the hous name the old
hall where thei should live for she had stai there as a child gave
him mani command as to the new arrang of it chamber and it
furnish which as there wa monei and to spare could be as costli
as thei will sai that she would send him down all thing by wain
so soon as he wa readi for them
thu then the hour wore awai until at length night came and thei
took their last meal togeth the three of them for it wa arrang
that peter should start at moonris when none were about to see him go
it wa not a veri happi meal and though thei made a brave show of
eat but littl food pass their lip now the hors were readi
and margaret buckl on peter sword and threw hi cloak about hi
shoulder and he have shaken castel by the hand and bade him guard
their jewel safe without more word kiss her in farewel and went
take the silver lamp in her hand she follow him to the anteroom
at the door he turn and saw her stand there gaze after him with
wide ey and a strain white face at the sight of her silent pain
almost hi heart fail him almost he refus to go then he
rememb and went
for a while margaret still stood thu until the sound of the hors
hoof had di awai inde then she turn and said
father i know not how it is but it seem to me that when peter and i
meet again it will be far off ye far off upon the stormi seabut
what sea i know not and without wait for an answer she climb the
stair to her chamber and there wept herself to sleep
castel watch her depart then mutter to himself
prai god she is not foresight like so mani of our race and yet why
is my own heart so heavi well accord to my judgment i have done my
best for him and her and for myself i care noth
chapter vii

word which she knew were alwai word of truth and the respect for
the gener upright of hi charact especi where her own sex
wa concern
in fact as ha been hint some littl time befor when peter had
first come to live with the castel betti think him a proper man
of gentl birth such a on inde as she would wish to marri had made
advanc to him which as he did not seem to notic them becam by
degre more and more mark what happen at last thei two knew alon
but it wa someth that caus betti to becom veri angri and to
speak of peter to her friend as a coldblood lout who thought onli of
work and gain the episod wa pass and soon forgotten by the ladi
in the press of other affair but the respect remain moreov on
on or two occas when the love of admir had led her into
grief peter had prove a good friend and what wa better a friend
who did not talk therefor she wish him back again especi now
when someth that wa more than mere vaniti and desir for excit
had taken hold of her and betti found herself be swept off her feet
into veri deep and doubt water
the shopmen and the servant miss him also for to him all disput
were brought for settlement nor provid it had not come about through
lack of honesti were ani pain too great for him to take to help them
in a troubl most of all castel miss him sinc until peter had gone
he did not know how much he had learn to reli upon him both in hi
busi and as a friend as for margaret her life without him wa on
long empti night
thu it chanc that in such a hous ani chang wa welcom and though
she like him littl enough margaret wa not even displeas when on
morn betti told her that the lord daguilar wa come to call on her
that dai and purpos to bring her a present
i do not seek hi present said margaret indiffer then ad
but how do you know that betti
the young woman colour and toss her head as she answer

older than you know enough of men to be abl to guard myself and can
keep them at a distanc
i am glad of it betti onli sometim i have thought that the distanc
wa scarc wide enough answer margaret and left the subject for
she wa think of other thing
that afternoon when margaret wa walk in the garden betti whose
face seem somewhat flush ran up to her and said that the lord
daguilar wa wait in the hall

daguilar await him
then she went into the hall and found daguilar look at an
illumin book of hour in which she had been read that wa

a perfect beast it prove to be inde gentl as a lamb and easi yet
veri spirit and swift
daguilar wa a pleasant cavali also talk of mani thing grave and
gai until at length even castel forgot hi thought and grew cheer
as thei canter forward through the fresh spring morn by heath and
hill and woodland listen to the sing of the bird and watch
the husbandmen at their labour thi ride wa but the first of sever
that thei took sinc daguilar knew their hour of exercis even when
thei chang them and whether thei ask him or not join or met them
in such a natur fashion that thei could not refus hi compani
inde thei were much puzzl to know how he came to be so well
acquaint with their movement and even with the direct in which
thei propos to ride but suppos that he must have it from the
groom although these were command to sai noth and alwai deni
have spoken with him that betti should speak of such matter or even
find opportun of do so never chanc to cross their mind who
did not guess that if thei rode with daguilar in the morn betti
often walk with him in the even when she wa suppos to be at
church or sew or visit her aunt upon the wharf at westminst
but of these walk the foolish girl said noth for her own reason
now as thei rode togeth although he remain veri courteou and
respect the manner of daguilar toward margaret grew ever more
close and intim thu he began to tell her stori true or fals of
hi past life which seem to have been strang and event enough to
hint too of a certain hidden great that pertain to him which he
did not dare to show and of high ambit which he had he spoke also
of hi loneli and hi desir to lose it in the companionship of a
kindr heart if he could find on to share hi wealth hi station
and hi hope while all the time hi dark ey fix on margaret
seem to sai the heart i seek is such a on as your at length
at some murmur word or touch she took affright and sinc she could
not avoid him abroad determin to stai at home and much as she love
the sport to ride no more till peter should return so she gave out
that she had hurt her knee which made the saddl pain to her and
the beauti spanish mare wa left idl in the stabl or mount onli
by the groom
thu for some dai she wa rid of daguilar and emploi herself in
read and work or in write long letter to peter who wa busi
enough at dedham and sent her thenc mani commiss to fulfil
on afternoon castel wa seat in hi offic deciph letter which
had just reach him the night befor hi best ship of over two
hundr ton burden which wa name the margaret after hi daughter
had come safe into the mouth of the thame from spain that even
she wa to reach her berth at gravesend with the tide when castel
propos to go aboard of her to see to the unload of her cargo thi
wa the last of hi ship which remain unsold and it wa hi plan to
reload and victual her at onc with good that were wait and send
her back to the port of sevil where hi spanish partner in whose
name she wa alreadi regist had agre to take her over at a fix
price thi done it wa onli left for him to hand over hi busi to
the merchant who had purchas it in london after which he would be
free to depart a veri wealthi man and spend the even of hi dai at
peac in essex with hi daughter and her husband as now he so greatli
long to do so soon as thei were within the river bank the captain of
thi ship smith by name had land the cargomast with letter and
a manifest of cargo bid him hire a hors and bring them to master
castel hous in holborn thi the man had done safe and it wa
these letter that castel read
on of them wa from hi partner bernaldez in sevil not in answer to
that which he had written on the night of the open of thi
historyfor thi there had been no timeyet deal with matter
whereof it treat in it wa thi passag
you will rememb what i wrote to you of a certain envoi who ha been
sent to the court of london who is call daguilar for as our cipher
is so secret and it is import that you should be warn i take the
risk of write hi name sinc that letter i have learn more
concern thi grande for such he is although he call himself plain
don daguilar in truth he is the marqui of morella and on on side
it is said of royal blood if not on both sinc he is report to be
the son born out of wedlock of princ carlo of viana the halfbroth
of the king the tale run that carlo the learn and gentl fell in
love with a moorish ladi of aguilar of high birth and great wealth for
she had rich estat at granada and elsewher and as he might not
marri her becaus of the differ of their rank and faith live with
her without marriag of which union on son wa born befor princ
carlo di or wa poison and while he wa still a prison at
morella he gave to or procur for thi boi the titl of marqui
choos from some fanci the name of morella that place where he had
suffer so much also he settl some privat land upon him after the
princ di the moorish ladi hi lover who had secretli becom a
christian took her son to live at her palac in granada where she di
also some ten year ago leav all her great wealth to him for she
never marri at thi time it is said that hi life wa in danger for
the reason that although he wa half a moor too much of the
bloodroy ran in hi vein but the marqui wa clever and persuad
the king and queen that he had no ambit beyond hi pleasur also
the church interced for him sinc to it he prove himself a faith
son persecut all heret especi the jew and even moor
although thei ar of hi own blood so in the end he wa confirm in
hi possess and left alon although he refus to becom a priest
sinc then he ha been made an agent of the crown at granada and
emploi upon variou embassi to london rome and elsewher on
matter connect with the faith and the establish of the holi
inquisit that is why he is again in england at thi moment be
charg to obtain the name and particular concern all marano
settl there especi if thei trade with spain i have seen the
name of those of whom he must inquir most close and that is why i
write to you so fulli sinc your is first upon the list i think
therefor that you do wise to wind up your busi with thi
countri and especi to sell your ship to us outright and quickli
sinc otherwis thei might be seizedlik yourself if you came here
my counsel to you ishid your wealth which will be great when we have
paid you all we ow and go to some place where you will be forgotten
for a while sinc that bloodhound daguilar for so he call himself
after hi mother birthplac ha not track you to london for
noth as yet thank be to god no suspicion ha fallen on ani of us
perhap becaus we have mani in our pai
when castel had finish transcrib all thi passag he read it
through carefulli then he went into the hall where a fire burn for
the dai wa cold and threw the translat on to it watch until it
wa consum after which he return to hi offic and hid awai the
letter in a secret cupboard behind the panel of the wall thi done
he sat himself in hi chair to think
my good friend juan bernaldez is right he said to himself
daguilar or the marqui morella doe not nose me and the other out
for noth well i shall not trust myself in spain and the monei
most of it except what is still to come from spain is put out where it
will never be found by him at good interest too all seem safe
enoughand yet i would to god that peter and margaret were fast
marri and that we three sat togeth out of sight and mind in the
old hall at dedham i have carri on thi game too long i should have
close my book a year ago but the trade wa so good that i could not
i wa wise also who in thi on lucki year have nearli doubl my
fortun and yet it would have been safer befor thei guess that i
wa so rich greedmer greedfor i do not need thi monei which mai
destroi us all greed the ancient pitfal of my race
as he thought thu there came a knock upon hi door snatch up a pen
he dip it in the inkhorn and call enter began to add a column
of figur on a paper befor him
the door open but he seem to take no heed so dilig did he
count hi figur yet although hi ey were fix upon the paper in
some wai that he could not understand he wa well awar that daguilar
and no other stood in the room behind him the truth be no doubt
that unconsci he had recognis hi footstep for a moment the

with the daughter ofa jew ye a marano and of a christian english
ladi of good famili but no more
castel lift hi hand as though to speak but daguilar went on
deni it not friend it is not worth while here in privat wa there
not a certain isaac of toledo who hard on fifti year ago left spain

not and as that isaac is long dead and hi son ha been a good
christian for nearli fifti year and had a christian wife and child who
will troubl himself about such a matter if he were openli a hebrew
now or wors still if pretend to be a christian he in secret

live hi wealth would be forfeit to it king whose ward hi daughter
would becom to be given in marriag where he will while he himself
be spanish born might perhap be hand over to the power of spain
there to make answer to these charg but we wander to strang matter
is that allianc still imposs seor
castel look him straight in the ey and answer
ye
there wa someth so bold and direct in hi utter of the word that
for a moment daguilar seem to be taken aback he had not expect
thi sharp denial
it would be courteou to give a reason he said present
the reason is simpl marqui my daughter is alreadi betroth and
will er long be wed
daguilar did not seem surpris at thi intellig
to that brawler your kinsman peter brome i suppos he said
interrog i guess as much and by the saint i am sorri for
her for he must be a dull lover to on so fair and bright while as a
husband and he shrug hi shoulder friend castel for her sake
you will break off thi match
and if i will not marqui
then i must break it off for you in the interest of all of us
includ of cours myself who love her and wish to lift her to a
great place and of yourself whom i desir should pass your old ag in
peac and wealth and not be hunt to your death like a mad dog
how will you break it marqui by
oh no seor answer daguilar not by other men swordsif that
is what you mean the worthi peter is safe from them so far as i am
concern though if he should come face to face with mine then let the
best man win have no fear friend i do not practis murder who valu
my own soul too much to soak it in blood nor would i marri a woman
except of her own free will still peter mai die and the fair margaret
mai still place her hand in mine and sai i choos you as my husband
all these thing and mani other mai happen marqui but i do not
think it like that thei will happen and for my part whilst thank
you for it i declin your honour offer believ that my daughter
will be more happi in her present humbl state with the man she ha
chosen have i your leav to return to my account and he rose
ye seor answer daguilar rise also but add an item to those
loss of which you spoke that of the friendship of carlo marqui de
morella and on the other side enter again that of hi hate man he
ad and hi dark handsom face turn veri evil as he spoke ar
you mad think of the littl tabernacl behind the altar in your chapel
and what it contain
castel stare at him then said
come let us see nai fear no trick like you i rememb my soul and
do not stain my hand with blood follow me so you will be safe
curios or some other reason prompt daguilar to obei and
present thei stood behind the altar
now said castel as he drew the tapestri and open the secret door
look daguilar peer into the place but where should have been
the tabl the ark the candlestick and the roll of the law of which
betti had told him were onli old dusti box fill with parchment and
some broken furnitur
what do you see ask castel
i see friend that you ar even a clever jew than i thought but
thi is a matter that you must explain to other in due season believ
me i am no inquisitor then without more word he turn and left him
when castel have shut the secret door and drawn the tapestri
hurri from the chapel it wa to find that the marqui had depart
he went back to hi offic much disturb and sat himself down there to
think truli fate that had so long been hi friend wa turn it
face against him thing could not have gone wors daguilar had
discov the secret of hi faith through hi spi and have by
some accurs mischanc fallen in love with hi daughter beauti wa
becom hi bitter enemi becaus he must refus her to him why must he
refus her the man wa of great posit and nobl blood she would
becom the wife of on of the first grande of spain on who stood
nearest to the throne perhapssuch a thing wa possiblesh might
live herself to be queen or the mother of king moreov that
marriag meant safeti for himself it meant a quiet ag a peaceabl
death in hi own bedfor were he fifti time a marano who would touch
the fatherinlaw of the marqui de morella why just becaus he had
promis her in marriag to peter brome and through all hi life as a
merchant he had never yet broken with a bargain becaus it went against
himself that wa the answer yet almost he could find it in hi heart
to wish that he had never made that bargain that he had kept peter who
had wait so long wait for anoth month well it wa too late
now he had pass hi word and he would keep it whatev the
cost might be
rise he call on of the servant and bade her summon margaret

though let thi be said for her she never dream that ani harm wa
meant toward her cousin margaret or that a lie had been told as to

the groom he told to lead the hors a littl wai along the bank till he
found an inn that stood there where he must await their return or
further order and to betti he suggest that she should go with him
as there wa but littl place left in the boat thi she wa will
enough to do think it all part of the plan for her carri off but
margaret would have none of it sai that unless her cousin came with

so soon as ever thei were seat side by side in the stern it wa push
off and row awai rapidli into the dark while on of the sailor
lit a lantern which he fasten to the bow and far out on the river as
though in answer to the signal anoth star of light appear toward

rower of her father state but the sailor their guid prai her
not to troubl them as the tide ran veri swiftli and thei must give all
their mind to their busi lest thei should overset so she wa

about ten oclock thei round the nore bank safe and here spoke a
fishingboat who told them that more than six hour befor thei had
seen the san antonio sail past them down channel and note two women

to catch sight of the spaniard but the san antonio wa a swift
caravel of 250 ton with much canva for she carri four mast and
although the margaret wa also a good sailer she had but two mast
and could not come up with her or for anyth thei knew thei might
have miss her on the sea on the afternoon of the fourth dai when
thei were off the lizard and creep along veri slowli under a light
breez the lookout man report a ship ly becalm ahead peter
who had the ey of a hawk climb up the mast to look at her and
present call down that he believ from her shape and rig she must
be the caravel though of thi he could not be sure as he had never seen
her then the captain smith went up also and a few minut later
return sai that without doubt it wa the san antonio
now there wa a great and joy stir on board the margaret everi man
see to hi sword and their long or cross bow of which there were
plenti although thei had no bombard or cannon that as yet were rare
on merchant ship their plan wa to run alongsid the san antonio and
board her for thu thei hope to recov margaret as for the anger of
the king which might well fall on them for thi deed sinc he would
think littl of the steal of a pair of englishwomen of that thei
must take their chanc
within half an hour everyth wa readi and peter pace to and fro
look happier than he had done sinc he rode awai to dedham the light
breez still held although if it reach the san antonio it did not
seem to move her and with the help of it by degre thei came to
within half a mile of the caravel then the wind drop altogeth and
there the two ship lai still the set of the tide or some current
seem to be draw them toward each other so that when the night
close in thei were not more than four hundr pace apart and the
englishmen had great hope that befor morn thei would close and be
abl to board by the light of the moon
but thi wa not to be sinc about nine oclock thick cloud rose up
which cover the heaven while with the cloud came strong wind
blow off the land and when at length the dawn broke all thei could
see of the san antonio wa her topmast as she rose upon the sea
fly southward swiftli thi inde wa the last sight thei had of
her for two long week
from ushant all across the bai the air were veri light and variabl
but when at length thei came off finisterr a gale sprang up from the
northeast which drove them forward veri fast it wa on the second
night of thi gale as the sun set that run out of some mist and
rain suddenli thei saw the san antonio not a mile awai and rejoic
for now thei knew that she had not made for ani port in the north of
spain as although she wa bound for cadiz thei fear she might have
done to trick them then the rain came on again and thei saw her
no more
all down the coast of portug the weather grew more heavi dai by dai
and when thei reach st vincent cape and bore round for cadiz it
blew a great gale now it wa that for the third time thei view the
san antonio labour ahead of them nor except at night did thei
lose sight of her ani more until the end of that voyag inde on the
next dai thei nearli came up with her for she tri to beat in to
cadiz but lose on of her mast in a fierc squall and see that
the margaret which sail better in thi tempest would soon be
aboard of her abandon her plan and ran for the strait of gibraltar
past tarifa point thei went have the coast of africa on their
right past the bai of algegira where the san antonio did not try to
harbour past gibraltar grei old rock where the signal fire were
burn and so at nightfal with not a mile between them out into the
mediterranean sea
here the gale wa furiou so that thei could scarc carri a rag of
canva and befor morn lost on of their topmast it wa an anxiou
night for thei knew not if thei would live through it moreov the
heart of castel and of peter were torn with fear lest the spaniard
should founder and take margaret with her to the bottom of the sea when
at length the wild stormi dawn broke howev thei saw her appar
in an evil case labour awai upon their starboard bow and by noon
came to within a furlong of her so that thei could see the sailor
crawl about on her high poop and stern ye and thei saw more than
thi for present two women ran from some cabin wave a white cloth
to them then were hustl back wherebi thei learn that margaret and
betti still live and knew that thei follow and thank god
present also there wa a flash and befor ever thei heard the
report a great iron bullet fell upon their deck and rebound
struck a sailor who stood by peter on the breast and dash him awai
into the sea the san antonio had fire the bombard which she carri
but as no more shot came thei judg that the cannon had broke it
lash or burst
a while after the san antonio two of whose mast were gone tri to
put about and run for malaga which thei could see far awai beneath the
snowcap mountain of the sierra but thi the spaniard could not
do for while she hung in the wind the margaret came right atop of
her and as her men labour at the sail everi on of the englishmen
who could be spare under the command of peter let loos on them with
their long shaft and crossbow and though the heav deck of the
margaret wa no good platform and the wind bent the arrow from their
line thei kill and wound eight or ten of them caus them to
loos the rope so that the san antonio swung round into the gale
again on the high tower of the caravel hi arm round the sternmost
mast stood daguilar shout command to hi crew peter fit an
arrow to hi string and wait until the margaret wa pois for a
moment on the crest of a great sea aim and loos make allow
for the wind
true to line sped that shaft of hi yet ala a span too high for
when a moment later daguilar leapt from the mast the arrow quiver in
it wood and pin to it wa the velvet cap he wore peter ground hi
teeth in rage and disappoint almost he could have wept for the
vessel swung apart again and hi chanc wa gone
five time out of seven he said bitterli can i send a shaft
through a bull ring at fifti pace to win a villag badg and now i
cannot hit a man to save my love from shame sure god ha
forsaken me
through all that afternoon thei held on shoot with their bow
whenev a spaniard show himself and be shot at in return though
littl damag wa done to either side but thi thei notedthat the
san antonio had sprung a leak in the gale for she wa sink deeper
in the water the spaniard knew it also and be awar that thei
must either run ashor or founder for the second time put about and
under the rain of english arrow came right across the bow of the
margaret head for the littl bai of calahonda that is the port of
motril for here the shore wa not much more than a leagu awai
now said jacob smith the captain of the margaret who stood under
the shelter of the bulwark with castel and peter up that bai li a
spanish town i know it for i have anchor there and if onc the san
antonio reach it goodby to our ladi for thei will take her to
granada not thirti mile awai across the mountain where thi marqui
of morella is a mighti man for there is hi palac sai then master
what shall we do in five more minut the spaniard will be across our
bow again shall we run her down which will be easi and take our
chanc of pick up the women or shall we let them be taken captiv to
granada and give up the chase
never said peter there is anoth thing that we can dofollow them
into the bai and attack them there on shore
to find ourselv among hundr of the spaniard and have our throat
cut answer smith the captain coolli
if we ran them down ask castel who had been think deepli all
thi while should we not sink also
it might be so answer smith but we ar built of english oak and
veri stout forward and i think not but she would sink at onc be
near to it alreadi and the odd ar that the women ar lock in the
cabin or between deck out of reach of the arrow and must go
with her
there is anoth plan said peter sternli and that is to grappl
with her and board her and thi i will do
the captain a stout man with a flat face that never chang lift hi
eyebrow which wa hi onli wai of show surpris
what he said in thi sea i have fought in some war but never
have i known such a thing
then friend you shall know it now if i can but find a dozen men to
follow me answer peter with a savag laugh what shall i see my
mistress carri off befor my ey and strike no blow to save her
rather will i trust in god and do it and if i die then die i must as
a man should there is no other wai
then he turn and call in a loud voic to those who stood around or
loos arrow at the spaniard
who will come with me aboard yonder ship those who live shall spend
their dai in eas thereaft that i promis and those who fall will
win great fame and heaven glori
the crew look at the wave run hill high and the waterlog
spaniard labour in the trough of them as she came round slowli in a
wide circl veri doubtfulli as well thei might and made no answer
then peter spoke again
there is no choic he said if we give that ship our stem we can
sink her but then how will the women be save if we leav her alon
mayhap she will founder and then how will the women be save or she
mai win ashor and thei will be carri awai to granada and how can we
snatch them out of the hand of the moor or of the power of spain but
if we can take the ship we mai rescu them befor thei go down or reach
land will none back me at thi inch
ay son said old castel i will
peter stare at him in surpris youat your year he said
ye at my year why not i have the fewer to risk
then as though he were asham of hi doubt on brawni sailorman
step forward and said that he wa readi for a cut at the spanish
thiev in foul weather as in fair next all castel household
servant came out in a bodi for love of him and peter and their ladi
and after them more sailor till nearli half of those aboard someth
over twenti in all declar that thei were readi for the ventur
wherein peter cri enough smith would have come also but castel
said no he must stop with the ship
then while the carack head wa laid so as to cut the path of the san
antonio circl round them slowli like a wound swan and the
boarder made readi their sword and knive for here archeri would not
avail them castel gave some order to the captain he bade him if
thei were cut down or taken to put about and run for sevil and there
deliv over the ship and her cargo to hi partner and correspond
prai them in hi name to do their best by mean of gold for which
the sale valu of the vessel and her good should be chargeabl or
otherwis to procur the releas of margaret and betti if thei still
live and to bring daguilar the marqui of morella to account for
hi crime thi done he call to on of hi servant to buckl on him
a light steel breastplat from the ship store but peter would wear
no iron becaus it wa too heavi onli an archer jerkin of bullhid
stout enough to turn a swordcut such as the other boarder put on also
with steel cap of both of which thei had a plenti in the cabin
now the san antonio have come round wa steer for the mouth of
the bai in such fashion that she would pass them within fifti yard
hoist a small sail to give hi ship wai the captain smith took the
helm of the margaret and steer straight at her so as to cut her
path while the boarder head by peter and castel gather near the
bowsprit lai down there under shelter of the bulwark and wait
chapter xi
the meet on the sea
for anoth minut or more the san antonio held on until she divin
the desper purpos of her foe then see that soon the carack
prow must crash into her frail side she shift her helm and came round
sever point so that in the end the margaret ran not into her but
alongsid of her grind against her plank and shear awai a
great length of her bulwark for a few second thei hung togeth thu
and befor the sea bore them apart grapnel were thrown from the
margaret whereof on forward got hold and brought them bow to bow
thu the end of the bowsprit of the margaret project over the high
deck of the san antonio
now for it said peter follow me all and spring up he ran to
the bowsprit and began to swarm along it
it wa a fear task on moment the great sea lift him high into
the air and the next down he came again till the massiv spar crash
on to the deck of the san antonio with such a shock that he nearli
flew from it like a stone from a sling yet he hung on and bide hi
chanc seiz a broken stayrop that dangl from the end of the
bowsprit like a lash from a whip and began to slide down it the gale
caught him and blew him to and fro the vessel pitch wildli jerk
him into the air the deck of the san antonio rose up and reced like
a thing aliv it wa nearnot a dozen feet beneath himand loos
hi hold he fell upon the forward tower without be hurt then gain
hi feet ran to the broken mast and fling hi left arm about it
with the other drew hi sword
next instanthow he never knewcastel wa at hi side and after him
came two more men but on of these roll from the deck into the sea
and wa lost as he vanish the chain of the grappl iron part
and the margaret swung awai from them leav those three alon in
the power of their foe nor do what she would could she make fast
again as yet howev there were no spaniard to be seen for the
reason that none had dare to stand upon thi high tower whereof the
bulwark were all gone while the bowsprit of the margaret crash
down upon it like a giant club and as she roll swept it with
it point
so there thei stood cling to the mast and wait for the end for
now their friend were a hundr yard awai and thei knew that their
case wa desper a shower of arrow came loos from other part of
the ship and on of these struck the man with them through the throat
so that he fell to the deck clasp at it and present roll into
the sea also anoth pierc castel through hi right forearm caus
hi sword to drop and slide awai from him peter seiz the arrow
snap it in two and drew it out but castel right arm wa now
helpless and with hi left he could do no more than cling to the
broken mast
we have done our best son he said and fail margaret will learn
that we would have save her if we could but we shall not meet
her here
peter ground hi teeth and look about him desper for he had no
word to sai what should he do leav castel and rush for the waist of
the ship and so perish or stai and die there nai he would not be
butcher like a bird on a bough he would fall fight
farewel he call through the gale god rest our soul then
wait till the ship steadi herself he ran aft and reach the
ladder that led to her tower stagger down it to the waist of the
vessel and at it foot halt hold to the rail
the scene befor him wa strang enough for there rang round the
bulwark were the spanish men who watch him curious whilst a few
pace awai rest against the mast stood daguilar who lift hi
hand in which there wa no weapon and address him
seor brome he shout do not move anoth step or you ar a dead
man listen to me first and then do what you will am i safe from your
sword while i speak
peter nod hi head in assent and daguilar drew nearer for even in
that more shelter place it wa hard to hear becaus of the howl of
the tempest
seor he said to peter you ar a veri brave man and have done a
deed such as none of us have seen befor therefor i wish to spare you
if i mai also i have work you bitter wrong driven to it by the
might of love and jealousi for which reason also i wish to spare you
to set upon you now would be but murder and whatev els i do i will
not murder first let me eas your mind your ladi and mine is aboard
here but fear not she ha come and will come to no harm from me or
from ani man while i live if for no other reason i do not desir to

what did you then when you snatch her from her home by some foul
trick ask peter fierc

amend
what amend will you give her back to me
no that i cannot do even if she should wish it of which i am not
sure nonev while i live

peter hope that hi word would reach margaret
but daguilar onli smile and shook hi head then went on
that i cannot either for it would give her pain still seor i will
repai the heavi debt that i ow to you and to you also seor and he
bow toward castel who unseen by peter had crept down the ladder
and now stood behind him stare at daguilar with cold rage and
indign you have wrought us much damag have you not hunt us
across the sea and kill sundri of us with your arrow and now you
have striven to board our ship and put us to the sword a design in
which god ha frustrat you therefor your live ar justli forfeit

do you take me for such a man as yourself ask peter with a bitter
laugh i do not leav thi ship aliv unless my affianc wife

i am not so sure said peter for i am more than thatan honest man
of england who never practis womanst still i will fight you

both ar dead but what is the stake and how do i know that some of
these and he point to the crew who were listen intent will

the oath do your worst against me master castel and then leav me to
do my worst against you seor brome the light grow bad and the water

peter nod hi head and thei step forward
on more word said daguilar drop hi swordpoint my friend
you have heard our compact do you swear to abid by it and if i fall
to set these two men and the two ladi free on their own ship or on the
land for the honour of chivalri and of spain
the captain of the san antonio and hi lieuten answer that thei
swore on behalf of all the crew
you hear seor brome now these ar the conditionsthat we fight to
the death but if both of us should be hurt or wound so that we
cannot despatch each other then no further harm shall be done to either
of us who shall be tend till we recov or die by the will of god
you mean that we must die on each other sword or not at all and if
ani foul chanc should overtak either other than by hi adversari
hand that adversari shall not dispatch him
ye seor for in our case such thing mai happen and he point to
the huge sea that tower over them threaten to engulf the
waterlog caravel we will take no advantag of each other who wish
to fight thi quarrel out with our own right arm
so be it said peter and master castel here is the wit to our
bargain
daguilar nod kiss the crosshilt of hi sword in confirm of
the pact bow courteous and put himself on hi defenc
for a moment thei stood face each other a wellmatch pairpet
lean fiercefac longarm a terribl man to see in the fieri light
that broke upon him from beneath the edg of a black cloud the spaniard
tall also and agil but to all appear as unconcern as though
thi were but a pleasur bout and not a duel to the death with a
woman fate hang on the hazard daguilar wore a breastplat of
goldinlaid black steel and a helmet while peter had but hi tunic of
bull hide and ironlin cap though hi straight cutandthrust sword
wa heavier and mayhap half an inch longer than that of hi foe
thu then thei stood while castel and all the ship compani save
the helmsman who steer her to the harbour mouth clung to the
bulwark and the cordag of the mainmast and forget of their own
peril watch in utter silenc
it wa peter who thrust the first straight at the throat but daguilar
parri deftli so that the sword point went past hi neck and befor
it could be drawn back again struck at peter the blow fell upon the
side of hi steel cap and glanc thenc to hi left shoulder but
be light did him no harm swiftli came the answer which wa not
light for it fell so heavili upon daguilar breastplat that he
stagger back after him sprang peter think that the game wa hi
but at that moment the ship which had enter the breaker of the
harbour bar roll terribl and sent them both reel to the
bulwark nor did she ceas her roll so that smite and thrust
wildli thei stagger backward and forward across the deck grip
with their left hand at anyth thei could find to steadi them till
at length bruis and breathless thei fell apart unwound and
rest awhil
an ill field thi to fight on seor gasp daguilar
i think that it will serv our turn said peter grimli and rush at
him like a bull it wa just then that a great sea came aboard the ship
a mass of green water which struck them both and wash them like straw
into the scupper where thei roll half drown peter rose the first
cough out salt water and rub it from hi ey to see daguilar
still upon the deck hi sword ly besid him and hold hi right
wrist with hi left hand
who gave you the hurt he ask i or your fall

wrist but i have still my left hand suffer me to aris and we will
finish thi frai
as the word pass hi lip a gust of wind more furiou than ani that
had gone befor concentr as it wa through a gorg in the
mountain struck the caravel at the veri mouth of the harbour and laid
her over on her beam end for a while it seem as though she must
capsiz and sink till suddenli her mainmast snap like a stick and
went overboard when reliev of it weight by slow degre she
right herself down upon the deck came the cross yard on end of it
crash through the roof of the cabin in which margaret and betti were
confin split it in two while a block attach to the other fell
upon the side of peter head and glanc from the steel cap struck
him on the neck and shoulder hurl him senseless to the deck where
still grasp hi sword he lai with arm outstretch
out of the ruin of the cabin appear margaret and betti the former
veri pale and frighten and the latter mutter prayer but as it
chanc both uninjur cling to the tangl rope thei crept
forward seek refug in the waist of the ship for the heavi spar
still work and roll abov them rest on the wreck of the cabin
and the bulwark whenc present it slid into the sea by the stump of
the broken mainmast thei halt their long lock stream in the gale
and here it wa that margaret caught sight of peter ly upon hi back
hi face red with blood and slide to and fro as the vessel roll
she could not speak but in mute appeal point first to him and then to
daguilar who stood near rememb as she did so her vision in the
hous at holborn which wa thu terribl fulfil hold to a rope
daguilar drew near to her and spoke into her ear ladi he said
thi is no deed of mine we were fight a fair fight for he had
board the ship when the mast fell and kill him blame me not for hi
death but seek comfort from god
she heard and look round her wildli perceiv her father
struggl toward her then with a bitter cry fell senseless on
hi breast
chapter xii
father henriqu
the night came down swiftli for a great stormcloud in which jag
lightn plai blot out the last rai of the sunk sun then with
roll thunder and torrent of rain the tempest burst over the sink
ship the marin could no longer see to steer thei knew not whither
thei were go onli the lessen sea told them that thei had enter
the harbour mouth present the san antonio struck upon a rock and
the shock of it threw castel who wa bend over the senseless shape
of margaret against the bulwark and daze him
there aros a great cry of the vessel founder and water seem to be
pour on the deck though whether thi were from the sea or from the
delug of the fall rain he did not know then came anoth cry of
get out the boat or we perish and a sound of men work in the
dark the ship swung round and round and settl down there wa a
flash of lightn and by it castel saw betti hold the unconsci
margaret in her strong arm she saw him also and scream to him to
come to the boat he start to obei then rememb peter peter might
not be dead what should he sai to margaret if he left him there to
drown he crept to where he lai upon the deck and call to a sailor
who rush by to help him the man answer with a curs and vanish
into the deep gloom so unaid castel essai the task of lift
thi heavi bodi but hi right arm be almost useless could do no
more than drag it into a sit postur and thu by slow degre
across the deck to where he imagin the boat to be
but here there wa no boat and now the sound of voic came from the
other side of the ship so he must drag it back again by the time he
reach the starboard bulwark all wa silent and anoth flash of
lightn show him the boat crowd with peopl upon the crest of a
wave fifti yard or more from him whilst other who had not been abl
to enter clung to it stern and gunwal he shout aloud but no
answer came either becaus none were left live on the ship or
becaus in all that turmoil thei could not hear him
then castel know that he had done everyth that he could drag
peter under the overhang deck of the forward tower which gave some
littl shelter from the rain and lai hi bleed head upon hi
knee so that it might be lift abov the wash of the water sat
himself down and began to sai prayer after the jewish fashion whilst
await hi end
that he wa about to die he had no doubt for the waist of the ship as
he could perceiv by the lightn wa almost level with the sea
which howev here in the harbour wa now much calmer than it had
been thi he knew for although the rain still fell steadili and the
wind howl abov no sprai broke over them deeper and deeper sank the
caravel as she drift onward till at length the water wash over her
deck from side to side so that castel wa oblig to seat himself on
the second step of the ladder down which peter had charg up on the
spaniard a while pass and he becam awar that the san antonio
had ceas to move and wonder what thi might mean the storm had
roll awai now and he could see the star also with it went the wind
the night grew warmer too which wa well for him for otherwis wet
as he wa he must have perish still it wa a long night the longest
that ever he had spent nor did ani sleep come to reliev hi miseri or
make hi end easier for the pain from the arrow wound in hi arm kept
him awak
so there he sat wonder if margaret wa dead as peter seem to be
dead and if so whether their spirit were watch him now watch
and wait till he join them he thought too of the dai of hi
prosper until he had seen the accurs face of daguilar and of all
the worthless wealth that wa hi and what would becom of it he hope
even that margaret wa gone better that she should be dead than live on
in shame and miseri if there were a god how came it that he could
allow such thing to happen in the world then he rememb how when
job sat in just such an evil case hi wife had invit him to curs god
and die and how the patriarch had answer to her what shall we
receiv good at the hand of god and shall we not receiv evil
rememb too after all hi troubl what had been the end of that
just man and therefrom took some littl comfort after thi a stupor
crept over him and hi last thought wa that the vessel had sunk and
he wa depart into the deep of death
listen a voic call and castel awok to see that it wa grow
light and that befor him support himself on the rail of the ladder
stood the tall form of peterpet with a ghastli bloodstain
counten chatter teeth and glaze unnatur ey
do you live john castel said that hollow voic or ar we both
dead and in hell
nai he answer i live yet we ar still thi side of doom
what ha chanc ask peter i have been lost in a great
black
castel told him briefli
peter listen till he had done then stagger to the bulwark rail and
look about him make no comment
i can see noth he said presentlyth mist is too deep but i
think we must lie near the shore come help me let us try to find
victual i am faint
castel rose stretch hi cramp limb and go to him place hi
uninjur arm round peter middl and thu support him toward the
stern of the ship where he guess that the main cabin would be thei
found and enter it a small place but richli furnish with a carv
crucifix screw to it sternmost wall a piec of pickl meat and some
of the hard wheaten cake such as sailor us lai upon the floor where
thei had been cast from the tabl while in a swing rack abov stood
flagon of wine and of water castel found a horn mug and fill it
with wine gave it to peter who drank greedili then hand it back to
him who also drank afterward thei cut off portion of the meat with
their knive and swallow them though peter did thi with great
difficulti becaus of the hurt to hi head and neck then thei drank
more wine and somewhat refresh left the place
the mist wa still so thick that thei could see noth and therefor
thei went into the wreck of that cabin which had been occupi by
margaret and betti sat themselv down upon the bed wherein thei had
slept and wait rest thu peter note that thi cabin had been
fit sumptuous as though for the occup of a great ladi for
even the vessel were of silver and in a wardrob whereof the door
were open hung beauti gown also there were a few written book
on the outer leav of on of which margaret had set down some note and
a prayer of her own make petit that heaven would protect her
that peter and her father might be live and learn the truth of what
had befallen and that it would pleas the saint to deliv her and to
bring them togeth again thi book peter thrust awai within hi jerkin
to studi at hi leisur
now the sun rose suddenli abov the eastern rang of the mountain
wherewith thei were surround leav the cabin thei climb to the
forecastl tower and gaze about them to find that thei were in a
landlock harbour and strand not more than a hundr yard from
the shore by ty a piec of iron to a rope and let it down into
the sea thei discov that thei lai upon a ridg and that there
were but four feet of water beneath their bow and have learn
thi determin to wade to the beach first howev thei went back to
the cabin and fill a leather bag thei found with food and wine then
by an afterthought thei search for the place where daguilar slept
and discov it between deck also a strongbox which thei made shift
to break open with an iron bar
in it wa a great store of gold place there no doubt for the payment
of the crew and with it some jewel the jewel thei left but the
monei thei divid and stow it about them to serv their need should
thei come safe ashor then thei wash each other wound and bound
them up and descend the ladder which had been thrown over the ship
side when the spaniard escap in the boat let themselv down into
the sea and bade farewel to the san antonio
by now the wind had fallen and the sun shone brightli warm their
chill blood also the water which wa quit calm did not rise much
abov their middl so that thei were ableth bottom be smooth and
sandyto wade without troubl to the shore as thei drew near to it
thei saw peopl gather there and guess that thei came from the
littl town of motril which lai up the river that here ran into the
bai also thei saw other thingsnam the boat of the san antonio
upon the shore and rejoic to know that it had come safe to land for
it rest upon it keel with but littl water in it bottom ly here
and there also were the corps of drown men five or six of them no
doubt those sailor who had swum after the boat or clung to it
gunwal but among these bodi none were those of women
when at length thei reach the shore veri few peopl were left there
for of the rest some had begun to wade out toward the ship to plunder
her whilst other had gone to fetch boat for the same purpos
therefor the compani who await them consist onli of women

and smile but come up to the villag seor where you can rest and
have your hurt attend to afterward we will talk
we had best go said castel in english to peter there ar no hors

peter nod and led by the priest whose name thei discov to be

then thei limp on over the hill and present saw the whitewal

street which he open with a kei

becom somewhat strict and expect that the outward form should be
observ as well inde when i wa a familiar of the holi offic at
sevil i have seen men burn for the neglect of them you have two
arm and a head seor also a knee that can be bent
pardon me answer castel to thi lectur i wa think of other
matter the carri off of my daughter at the hand of your patron
the marqui of morella for instanc
then make no repli the priest led them through hi sittingroom to a
bedchamb with high bar window that although it wa larg and
lofti remind them somehow of a prison cell here he left them sai
that he would go to find the local surgeon who it seem wa a barber
also if inde he were not engag in lighten the ship
recommend them meanwhil to take off their wet cloth and lie
down to rest
a woman have brought hot water and some loos garment in which to
wrap themselv while their own were dry thei undress and wash
and afterward utterli worn out threw themselv down and fell asleep
upon the bed have first hidden awai their gold in the food bag
which peter place beneath hi pillow two hour later or more thei were
awaken by the arriv of father henriqu and the barbersurgeon
accompani by the womanserv and who brought them back their
cloth clean and dri
when the surgeon saw peter hurt to the left side of hi neck and
shoulder which now were black swollen and veri stiff he shook hi
head and said that time and rest alon could cure it and that he must
have been born under a fortun star to have escap with hi life
which save for hi steel cap and leather jerkin he would never have
done as no bone were broken howev all that he could do wa to
dress the part with some sooth ointment and cover them with clean
cloth thi finish he turn to castel wound that wa through
the fleshi part of the right forearm and have syring it out with
warm water and oil bound it up sai that he would be well in a week
he ad drili that the gale must have been fiercer even than he
thought sinc it could blow an arrow through a man arma sai at
which the priest prick up hi ear
to thi castel made no answer but produc a piec of morella gold
offer it to him for hi servic ask him at the same time to
procur them mule or hors if he could the barber promis to try to
do so and be well pleas with hi fee which wa a great on for
motril said that he would see them again in the even and if he
could hear of ani beast would tell them of it then also he promis to
bring them some cloth and cloak of spanish make sinc those thei had
were not fit to travel in through that countri be soil and
bloodstain
after he had gone and the priest with him who wa busi see to the
divis of the spoil from the ship and make sure of hi own share
the servant a good soul brought them soup which thei drank then thei
lai down again upon the bed and talk togeth as to what thei
should do
castel wa downheart point out that thei were still as far from
margaret as ever who wa now onc more lost to them and in the hand of
morella whenc thei could scarc hope to snatch her it would seem
also that she wa be taken to the moorish citi of granada if she
were not alreadi there where christian law and justic had no power
when he had heard him out peter whose heart wa alwai stout
answer
god ha as much power in granada as in london or on the sea whenc he
ha save us i think sir that we have great reason to be thank to
god see that we ar both aliv todai who might so well have been
dead and that margaret is aliv also and as we believ unharm
further thi spanish thief of women is it would seem a strang man
that is if there be ani truth in hi word for although he could steal
her it appear that he cannot find it in hi heart to do her violenc
but is determin to win her onli with her own consent which i think
will not be had readili also he shrink from murder who when he
could have butcher us did not do so
i have known such men befor said castel who hold some sin
venial but other deadli to their soul it is a fruit of
superstit
then sir let us prai that morella superstit mai remain strong
and get us to granada as quickli as we can for there rememb you
have friend both among the jew and moor who have trade with the
place for mani year and these mai give us shelter therefor though
thing ar bad still thei might be wors
that is so answer castel more cheerfulli if inde she ha
been taken to granada and as to thi we will try to learn someth
from the barber or the father henriqu
i put no faith in that priest a sly fellow who is in the pai of
morella answer peter
then thei were silent be still veri weari and have noth more
to sai but much to think about
about sundown the doctor came back and dress their wound he brought
with him a stock of cloth of spanish make hat and two heavi cloak
fit to travel in which thei bought from him at a good price also he
said that he had two fine mule in the courtyard and castel went out
to look at them thei were sorri beast enough be poor and wayworn
but as no other were to be had thei return to the room to talk as to
the price of them and their saddl the chaffer wa long for he
ask twice their valu which castel said poor shipwreck men could
not pai but in the end thei struck a bargain under which the barber
wa to keep and feed the mule for the night and bring them round next
morn with a guid who would show them the road to granada meanwhil
thei paid him for the cloth but not for the beast
also thei tri to learn someth from him about the marqui of
morella but like the frai henriqu the man wa cun and kept hi
mouth shut sai that it wa ill for poor men like himself to chatter
of the great and that at granada thei could hear everyth so he went
awai leav some medicin for them to drink and shortli afterward
the priest appear
he wa in high goodhumour have secur those jewel which thei had
left behind in the iron coffer as hi share of the spoil of the ship
take note of him as he show and fondl them castel ad up the
man and conclud that he wa veri avarici on who hate the
poverti in which he had been rear and would do much for monei
inde when he spoke bitterli of the thiev who had been at the ship
strongbox and taken nearli all the gold castel determin that he
must never know who those thiev were lest thei should meet with some
accid on their journei
at length the trinket were put awai and the priest said that thei must
sup with him but lament that he had no wine to give them who wa
forc to drink water whereon castel prai him to procur a few
flask of the best at their charg which noth loth he sent hi
servant out to do
so dress in their new spanish cloth and have all the gold hidden
about them in two moneybelt that thei had bought from the barber at
the same time thei went in to supper which consist of a spanish dish
call olla podridaa kind of rich stewbread chees and fruit
also the wine that thei had bought wa there veri good and strong and
whilst take but littl of it themselv for fear thei should fever
their wound thei persuad father henriqu to drink heartili so that
in the end he forgot hi cun and spoke with freedom then see
that he wa in a ripe humour castel ask him about the marqui of
morella and how it happen that he had a hous in the moorish capit
of granada
becaus he is half a moor answer the priest hi father it is
said wa the princ of viana and hi mother a ladi of royal moorish
blood from whom he inherit great wealth and hi land and palac in
granada there too he love to dwell who although he is so good a
christian by faith ha mani heathen tast and like the moor
surround himself with a seraglio of beauti women as i know for
often i act as hi chaplain as in granada there ar no priest
moreov there is a purpos in all thi for be partli of their
blood he is accredit to the court of their sultan boabdil by
ferdinand and isabella in whose interest he work in secret for
stranger you should know if you do not know it alreadi that their
majesti have for long been at war against the moor and purpos to
take what remain of hi kingdom from him and make it christian as
thei have alreadi taken malaga and purifi it by blood and fire from
the accurs stain of infidel
ye said castel we heard that in england for i am a merchant who

draught that the doctor had given them said their prayer each in hi
own fashion lock the door and lai down to rest as well as their
wound and sore anxieti would allow them

let them out of the hous
the barber it wa sure enough and with him a oneei youth mount on
a poni who he said would guid them to granada so thei return with

unsaf thei would be taken captiv by the moor and thrown into a
dungeon with the christian prison no on could enter granada without
a passport he declar and so forth to all of which thei answer
that thei must go
now he appear to be much disturb and said final that thei would
bring him into troubl with the marqui of morellahow or why he would
not explain though peter guess that it might be lest the marqui
should learn from them that thi priest hi chaplain had been

imposs as in the dark thei would fall over precipic while
descend to the plain there wa a venta or inn near by he said
where thei could sleep start again at dawn
when castel said that thei did not wish to go to an inn he answer
that thei must sinc thei had eaten what food thei had and here on
the road there wa no fodder for the beast so reluctantli enough
thei consent know that unless thei were fed the mule would never

apart and ask if thei could have some supper the host assent and
call to the moorish servant to bring food then sat down also and
began to put question to them of a sort which show that their guid
had alreadi told all their stori
how did you learn of our shipwreck ask castel by wai of answer

degre and he left them
a while later their food camegood meat enough of it sortand with it

host said he had pour out of the flask himself that the crust of it
might not slip castel thank him and ask him to drink a cup to
their good journei but he declin answer that it wa a fast dai
with him on which he wa sworn to touch onli water now peter who had
said noth all thi time but note much just touch the wine with
hi lip and smack them as though in approb while he whisper
in english to castel
drink it not it is drug
what sai your son ask the host
he sai that it is delici but suddenli he ha rememb what i too
forgot that the doctor at motril forbad us to touch wine for fear lest
we should worsen the hurt that we had in the shipwreck well let it
not be wast give it to your friend we must be content with thinner
stuff and take up a jug of water that stood upon the tabl he
fill an empti cup with it and drank then pass it to peter while
the host look at them sourli
then as though by an afterthought castel rose and polit present
the jug of wine and the two fill mug to the men who were sit at a
tabl close by sai that it wa a piti that thei should not have the
benefit of such fine liquor on of these fellow as it chanc wa
their own guid who had come in from tend the mule thei took the
mug readili enough and two of them toss off their content whereon
with a smother oath the landlord snatch awai the jug and
vanish with it
castel and peter went on with their meal for thei saw their neighbour
eat of the same dish as did the landlord also who had return
and it seem to peter wa watch the two men who had drunk the
wine with an anxiou ey present on of these rose from the tabl
and go to a bench on the other side of the room flung himself down
upon it and becam quit silent while their oneei guid stretch
out hi arm and fell face forward so that hi head rest on an empti
plate where he remain appar insens the host sprang up and
stood irresolut and castel rise said that evid the poor lad
wa sleepi after hi long ride and as thei were the same would he be
so courteou as to show them to their room
he assent readili inde it wa clear that he wish to be rid of
them for the other men were stare at the guid and their companion
and mutter amongst themselv
thi wai seor he said and led them to the end of the place where
a broad stepladd stood go up it a lamp in hi hand he open a
trapdoor and call to them to follow him which castel did peter
howev first turn and said goodnight to the compani who were
watch them at the same moment as though by accid or
thoughtlessli half draw hi sword from it scabbard then he too
went up the ladder and found himself with the other in an attic
it wa a bare place the onli furnitur in it be two chair and two
rough wooden bedstead without head to them mere trestl inde that
stood about three feet apart against a board partit which appear
to divid thi room from some other attic beyond also there wa a hole
in the wall immedi beneath the eav of the hous that serv the
purpos of a window over which a sack wa nail we ar poor folk
said the landlord as thei glanc round thi comfortless garret but
mani great peopl have slept well here as doubtless you will also and
he turn to descend the ladder
it will serv answer castel but friend tell your men to leav
the stabl open as we start at dawn and be so good as to give me
that lamp
i cannot spare the lamp he grunt sulkili with hi foot alreadi on
the first step
peter strode to him and grasp hi arm with on hand while with the
other he seiz the lamp the man curs and began to fumbl at hi
belt as though for a knife whereon peter put out hi strength
twist hi arm so fierc that in hi pain he loos the lamp which
remain in peter hand the innkeep made a grab at it miss hi
foot and roll down the ladder fall heavili on the floor below
watch from abov to their relief thei saw him pick himself up and
heard him begin to revil them shake hi fist and vow vengeanc
then peter shut down the trapdoor it wa ill fit so that the edg
of it stood up abov the floor also the bolt that fasten it had
been remov although the stapl in which it us to work remain
peter look round for some stick or piec of wood to pass through these
stapl but could find noth then he bethought him of a short length
of cord that he had in hi pocket which serv to tie on of the
saddlebag in it place on hi mule thi he fasten from on stapl
to the other so that the trapdoor could not be lift more than an
inch or two
reflect that thi might be done and the cord cut with a knife
pass through the open he took on of the chair and stood it so
that two of it leg rest on the edg of the trapdoor and the other
two upon the board of the floor then he said to castel
we ar snare bird but thei must get into the cage befor thei wring
our neck that wine wa poison and if thei can thei will murder us
for our moneyor becaus thei have been told to do so by the guid we
had best keep awak tonight
i think so answer castel anxious listen thei ar talk down
below
talk thei were as though thei debat someth but after a while
the sound of voic di awai when all wa silent thei hunt round the
attic but could find noth that wa unusu to such place peter
look at the windowhol and as it wa larg enough for a man to pass
through tri to drag on of the bed beneath it think that if ani
such attempt were made he who lai thereon would have the thief at hi
merci onli to find howev that these were screw to the floor and
immov as there wa noth more that thei could do thei went and
sat upon these bed their bare sword in their hand and wait a long
while but noth happen
at length the lamp which had been flicker feebli for some time went
out lack oil and except for the light which crept through the
windowplac for now thei had torn awai the sack that hung over it
thei were in dark
a littl while later thei heard the sound of a hors hoof and the
door of the hous open and shut after which there wa more talk
below and mingl with it a new voic which peter seem to rememb
i have it he whisper to castel here is our late host father
henriqu come to see how hi guest ar fare
anoth halfhour and the wane moon rose throw a beam of light
into their chamber also thei heard hors hoof again go to the
window peter look out of it and saw the hors a fine beast be
held by the landlord then a man came and mount it and at some remark
of hi turn hi face upward toward their window it wa that of
father henriqu
the two whisper togeth for a while till the priest bless the
landlord in latin word and rode awai and again thei heard the door of
the hous close
he is off to granada to warn morella hi master of our come said
castel as thei reseat themselv upon the bed
to warn morella that we shall never come perhap but we will beat him
yet repli peter
the night wore on and castel who wa veri weari sank back upon the
bolster and began to doze when suddenli the chair that wa set upon the
trapdoor fell over with a great clatter and he sprang up ask what
that nois might be
onli a rat answer peter who saw no good in tell him the
truthnam that thiev or murder had tri to open the
trapdoor
then he crept down the room felt the cord to find that it wa still
uncut and replac the chair where it had been thi done peter came
back to the bed and threw himself down upon it as though he would
slumber though never wa he more wide awak the weari of castel
had overcom him again howev for he snore at hi side
for a long while noth further happen although onc the rai of
moonlight wa cut off and for an instant peter thought that he saw a
face at the window if so it vanish and return no more now from
behind their head came faint sound like those of stifl breath
like those of nake feet then a slight creak and scratch in the
walla mous tooth might have caus itand suddenli right in that
rai of moonlight a cruellook knife and a nake arm project
through the panel
the knife flicker for a second over the breast of the sleep castel
as though it were a live thing that chose the spot where it would
strike on secondonli onefor the next peter had drawn himself up
and with a sweep of the sword which lai unscabbard at hi side had
shorn that arm off abov the elbow just where it project from the

chapter xiv
inez and her garden
for two hour or more john castel and peter travel on the granada
road run when it wa smooth walk when it wa rough and
stop from time to time to get their breath and listen but the night
wa quit silent no on seem to be pursu them evid the
remain cutthroat had either taken anoth wai or have their fill
of thi adventur want to see no more of peter and hi sword
at length the dawn broke over the great misti plain for now thei were
cross the vega then the sun rose and dispel the vapour and a
dozen mile or more awai thei saw granada on it hill thei saw each
other also and a sorri sight thei were torn by the sharp thorn and
stain with blood from their scratch peter wa barehead too for
he had lost hi cap and almost besid himself now that the excit
had left him from lack of sleep pain and weari moreov as the
sun rose it grew fearfulli hot upon that plain and it fierc rai
strike full upon hi head seem to stupefi him so that at last thei
were oblig to halt and weav a kind of hat out of corn and grass
which gave him so strang an appear that some moor whom thei met
go to their toil thought that he must be a madman and ran awai
still thei crawl forward refresh themselv with water whenev
thei could find ani in the irrig ditch that these peopl us for
their crop but cover littl more than a mile an hour toward noon
the heat grew so dread that thei were oblig to lie down to rest
under the shade of some palmlik tree and here absolut outworn
thei sank into a kind of sleep
thei were awaken by a sound of voic and stagger to their feet
draw their sword for thei thought that the thiev from the inn had
overtaken them instead of these ruffianli murder howev thei saw
befor them a bodi of eight moor beautifulli mount upon white
hors and clad in turban and flow robe the like of which peter
had never yet beheld who sat there regard them grave with their
quiet ey and as it seem not without piti
put up your sword seor said the leader of these moor in

i thought that boabdil wa king of granada said castel
without doubt he is king seor and by the grace of allah will remain
so but the marqui is alli to him in blood also while the truce
last he is a repres of their majesti of spain in our citi
and at a sign two of the moor dismount and led forward their
hors hold the stirrup and offer to help them to the saddl
there is noth for it said peter we must go so awkwardli
enough for thei were veri stiff thei climb on to the beast and rode
awai with their captor
the sun wa sink now for thei had slept long and by the time thei
reach the gate of granada the muezzin were call to the sunset
prayer from the minaret of the mosqu
it wa but a veri dim and confus idea that peter gather of the great
citi of the moor as surround by their whiterob escort he rode
he knew not whither narrow wind street white hous shutter
window crowd of courteou somewhat silent peopl all men and all
clad in those same strang flow dress who look at them
curious and murmur word which afterward he came to learn meant
christian prison or sometim christian dog fret and
point arch and a vast fairylik build set upon a hill he wa
daze with pain and fatigu as a longleg bloodstain figur
crown with hi quaint hat of grass he rode through that wondrou
and imperi place
yet no man laugh at him absurd as he must have seem but perhap
thi wa becaus under the grotesqu of hi appear thei
recognis someth of hi qualiti or thei might have heard rumour of
hi swordplai at the inn and on the ship at ani rate their attitud
wa that of courteou dislik of the christian mingl with respect for
the brave man in misfortun
at length after mount a long rise thei came to a palac on a mount
face the vast redwal fortress which seem to domin the place
which he afterward knew as the alhambra but separ from it by a
vallei thi palac wa a veri great build set on three side of a
squar and surround by garden wherein tall cypresstre point to
the tender sky thei rode through the garden and sundri gatewai till
thei came to a courtyard where servant with torch in their hand
ran out to meet them somebodi help him off hi hors somebodi
support him up a flight of marbl step beneath which a fountain
splash into a great cool room with an ornament roof then peter

thei look into each other ey a while then peter ask is the
dona margaret realli dead
i do not know she answer i wa told so and as though she fear
lest she should betrai herself inez turn and left him quickli
the dai went by and through the slow degre of convalesc peter
grew strong again but thei brought him no ad knowledg he did not
know where he dwelt or why he wa there all he knew wa that he live a
prison in a sumptuou palac or as he suspect for of thi he could
not be sure sinc the arch window of on side of the build were
wall up in the wing of a palac nobodi came near to him except the
fair inez and a moor who either wa deaf or could understand noth
that he said to him in spanish there were other women about it is
true veri pretti women all of them who act as servant but none of
these were allow to approach him he onli saw them at a distanc
therefor inez wa hi sole companion and with her he grew veri
intim to a certain extent but no further on the occas that ha
been describ she had lift a corner of her veil which hid her true
self but a long while pass befor she enlarg her confid the
veil wa kept down veri close inde dai by dai he question her and
dai by dai without the slightest show of irrit or even annoy
she parri hi question thei knew perfectli well that thei were
match their wit against each other but as yet inez had the best of
the game which inde she seem to enjoi he would talk to her also
of all sort of thingsth state of spain the moorish court the
danger that threaten granada whereof the great sieg now drew near
and so forthand of these matter she would discours most
intellig with the result that he learn much of the state of
polit in castil and granada and greatli improv hi knowledg of
the spanish tongu
but when of a sudden as he did again and again he sprang some question
on her about morella or margaret or john castel that same subtl
chang would come over her face and the same silenc would seal
her lip
seor she said to him on dai with a laugh you ask me of secret
which i might reveal to youperhapsif you were my husband or my love
but which you cannot expect a nurs whose life hang on it to answer
not that i wish you to becom my husband or my lover she ad with a
littl nervou laugh
peter look at her with hi grave ey
i know that you do not wish that he said for how could i attract
on so gai and beauti as you ar

nettl voic
to have attract you mean as you tell me that she is dead he
answer and see her mistak inez bit her lip but he went on
i wa go to add though it mai have no valu for you that you have
attract me as your true friend
friend she said open her larg ey what talk is thi can the
woman inez find a friend in a man who is under sixti
it would appear so he answer and again with that grace littl
curtsei of her she went awai leav him veri puzzl two dai
later she appear in hi room evid much disturb
i thought that you had left me altogeth and i am glad to see you
for i tire of that deaf moor and of thi fine room i want fresh air

garden
he leapt for joi at her word and snatch at hi sword which had
been left to him buckl it on

i thought that i should not need it in yonder inn but i did he
answer whereat she laugh then turn put her hand upon hi
shoulder and spoke to him earnestli
see friend she whisper you want to walk in the fresh airdo you
notand to learn certain thingsand i wish to tell you them but i
dare not do it here where we mai at ani moment be surround by spi
for these wall have ear inde well when we walk in that garden
would it be too great a penanc for you to put your arm about my
waistyou who still need support
no penanc at all i assur you answer peter with someth like a
smile for after all he wa a man and young while the waist of inez
wa as pretti as all the rest of her but he ad it might be
misunderstood
quit so i wish it to be misunderstood not by me who know that you
care noth for me and would as soon place your arm round that
marbl column
peter open hi lip to speak but she stop him at onc
oh do not wast falsehood on me in which of a truth you have no
art she said with evid irrit why if you had the monei you
would offer to pai me for my nurs and who know i might take it
understand you must either do thi seem to plai the lover to me or
we cannot walk togeth in that garden
peter hesit a littl guess a plot while she bent forward till
her lip almost touch hi ear and said in a still lower voic
and i cannot tell you how perhapsi sai perhapsy mai come to see
the remain of the dona margaret and certain other matter ah she
ad after a paus with a littl bitter laugh now you will kiss me
from on end of the garden to the other will you not foolish man
doubt no more take your chanc it mai be the last
of what kiss you or the other thing
that you will find out she said with a shrug of her shoulder
come
then while he follow dubious she led him down the length of the
great room to a door with a spyhol in the top of it that wa set in a
moorish archwai at the corner
thi door she open and there beyond it a drawn scimitar in hi hand
stood a tall moor on guard inez spoke a word to him whereon he salut
with hi scimitar and let them pass across the land to a turret stair
that lai beyond which thei descend at it foot wa anoth door
whereon she knock four time bolt shot back kei turn and it wa
open by a black porter beyond whom stood a second moor also with
drawn sword thei pass him as thei had pass the first turn down a
littl passag to the right end in some step and came to a third
door in front of which she halt
now she said nerv yourself for the trial
what trial he ask support himself against the wall for he
found hi leg still weak
thi she answer point to her waist and these and she
touch her rich red lip with her taper fingerpoint would you
like to practis a littl my innoc english knight befor we go out
you look as though you might seem awkward and unconvinc
i think answer peter drili for the humour of the situat move
him that such practic is somewhat danger for me it might annoi
you befor i had done i will postpon my happi until we ar in
the garden
i thought so she answer but look now you must plai the part or
i shall suffer who am bear much for you
i think that i mai suffer also he murmur but not so low that she
did not catch hi word
no friend pedro she said turn on him it is the woman who
suffer in thi kind of farc she pai the man ride awai to plai
anoth and without more ado she open the door which prove to be
unlock and unguard
beyond the foot of some step lai a most love garden great taper
cypress grew about it with mani orangetre and flower shrub
that fill the soft southern air with odour also there were marbl
fountain into which water splash from the mouth of carven lion and
here and there arbour with stone seat whereon were laid soft cushion
of mani colour it wa a verit place of eastern delight and
dream such as peter had never known befor he look upon it on that
languor eveh who had not seen the sky or flower for so mani weari
week of sick it wa seclud also be surround by a high
wall but at on place the tall windowless tower of some other build
of red stone soar up between and beyond two lofti cypresstre
thi is the harem garden inez whisper where mani a paint
favourit ha flit for a few happi summer hour till winter came
and the butterfli wa broken and as she spoke she drop her veil
over her face and began to descend the stair

jewel band flow down about her shoulder and her hand rest on

when the marqui took us to see the wonder of thi palac and i went
think that perhap i might find some path by which afterward we

then you will rememb also that highwal garden in which we walk
where the great tower is and how the marqui and that hate priest

roof i think that you were follow me
the waitingwomen would not let me said betti so soon as you had
pass in thei shut the door and told me to bide where i wa till you
return i went near to pull the hair out of the head of on of them
over it sinc i wa afraid for you alon with those two men but she
drew her knife the cat and i had none
you must be care betti said margaret lest some of these heathen
folk should do you a mischief
not thei she answer thei ar afraid of me why the other dai i
bundl on of them whom i found listen at the door head first down
the stair she complain to the marqui but he onli laugh at her
and now she li ab with a plaster on her nose but tell me
your tale
we climb the tower said margaret and from it topmost room look
out through the window that face south at all the mountain and the
plain over which thei drag us from motril present the priest who
had gone to the north wall in which there ar no window and enter
some recess there came out with an evil smile upon hi face and
whisper someth to the marqui who turn to me and said
the father tell me of an even prettier scene which we can view
yonder come seora and look
so i went who wish to learn all that i could of the build thei
led me into a littl chamber cut in the thick of the stonework in
the wall of which ar slit like loophol for the shoot of arrow
wide within but veri narrow without so that i think thei cannot be
seen from below hidden as thei ar between the rough stone of
the tower
thi is the place said the marqui where in the old dai the king
of granada who were alwai jealou us to sit to watch their women in
the secret garden it is told that thu on of them discov hi
sultana make love to an astrolog and drown them both in the
marbl bath at the end of the garden look now beneath us walk a coupl
who do not guess that we ar the wit of their vow
so i look idli enough to pass the time and there i saw a tall man in
a moorish dress and with him for their arm were about each other a
woman as i wa turn my head awai who did not wish to spy upon them
thu the woman lift her face to kiss the man and i knew her for that
beauti inez who ha visit us here at time as a spy i think
present too the man after pai her back her embrac glanc
about him guiltili and i saw hi face also and knew it
who wa it ask betti for thi gossip of lover interest her
peter brome no other margaret answer calmli but with a note of
despair in her voic peter brome pale with recent sick but no
other man
the saint save us i did not think he had it in him gasp betti
with astonish
thei would not let me go went on margaret thei forc me to see it
all the pair tarri for a while beneath some tree by the bath and
were hidden there then thei came out again and sat them down upon a
marbl seat while the woman sang song and the man lean against her
lovingli so it went on until the dark fell and we went leav
them there now she ad with a littl sob what sai you
i sai answer betti that it wa not master peter who ha no
like for strang ladi and secret garden
it wa he and no other man betti
then cousin he wa drug or drunk or bewitch not the peter whom
we know
bewitch perchanc by that bad woman which is no excus for him
betti thought a while she could not doubt the evid but from her
face it wa clear that she took no sever view of the offenc
well at the worst she said men as i have known them ar men he
ha been shut up for a long while with that minx who is veri fair and
witch and it wa scarc right to watch him through a slit in a
tower if he were my lover i should sai noth about it
i will sai noth to him about that or ani other matter repli
margaret sternli i have done with peter brome
again betti thought and spoke
i seem to see a trick cousin margaret thei told you he wa dead did
thei not and then that new came to us that he wa not dead onli sick
and here so the lie fail now thei tell you and seem to show you
that he is faithless mai not all thi have been some part plai for a
purpos by the woman
it take two to plai such part betti if you had seen
if i had seen i should have known whether it wa but a part or love
made in good earnest but you ar too innoc to judg what said the
marqui all thi while and the priest
littl or noth onli smile at each other and at length when it
grew dark and we could see no more ask me if i did not think that it
wa time to gome whom thei had kept there all that while to be the
wit of my own shame
ye thei kept you theredid thei notand brought you there just at
the right timedid thei notand shut me out of the tower so that i
might not be with youoh and all the rest now if you have ani
justic in you cousin you will hear peter side of thi stori befor
you judg him
i have judg him answer margaret coldli and oh i wish that i
were dead
margaret rose from her seat and step to the windowplac in the
tower which wa built upon the edg of a hill search the giddi depth
beneath with her ey where two hundr feet below the white line of
a roadwai show faintli in the moonlight
it would be easi would it not she said with a strain laugh just
to lean out a littl too far upon thi stone and then on swift rush
and darknessor lightfor everwhich i wonder
light i think said betti jerk her back from the windowth
light of hell fire and plenti of it for that would be selfmurd
noth els and besid what would on look like on that road
cousin dont be a fool if you ar right it isnt you who ought to go
out of that window and if you ar wrong then you would onli make a bad
busi wors time enough to die when on must sai iwhich perhap
will be soon enough meanwhil if i were you i would try to speak to
master peter first if onli to let him know what i thought of him
mayhap answer margaret sink back into a chair but i
sufferhow can you know what i suffer
why should i not know ask betti ar you the onli woman in the
world who ha been fool enough to fall in love can i not be as much in
love as you ar you smile and think to yourself that the poor
relat betti cannot feel like her rich cousin but i doi do i
know that he is a villain but i love thi marqui as much as you hate
him or as much as you love peter becaus i cant help myself it is my
luck that all but i am not go to throw myself out of a window i
would rather throw him out and squar our reckon and that i swear
ill do in thi wai or the other even if it should cost me what i
dont want to losemi life and betti drew herself up beneath the
silver lamp with a look upon her handsom determin face which wa so
like margaret and yet so differ that could he have seen it might
well have made morella regret that he had chosen thi woman for a tool
while margaret studi her wonderingli she heard a sound and glanc up
to see stand befor them none other than the beauti spaniard or
moor for she knew not which she wa inez that same woman whom from
her hidingplac in the tower she had watch with peter in the garden
how did you come here she ask coldli
through the door seora that wa left unlock which is not wise of
those who wish to talk privat in such a place as thi she answer
with a humbl curtsei
the door is still unlock said margaret point toward it
nai seora you ar mistaken here is it kei in my hand i prai you
do not tell your ladi to put me out which be so strong she well
can do for i have word to sai to you and if you ar wise you will
listen to them
margaret thought a moment then answer
sai on and be brief
chapter xvi
betti show her teeth
seora said inez you think that you have someth against me
no answer margaret you arewhat you ar why should i blame
you
well against the seor brome then
perhap but that is between me and him i will not discuss it with
you
seora went on inez with a slow smile we ar both innoc of what
you thought you saw
inde then who is guilti
the marqui of morella
margaret made no answer but her ey said much
seora you do not believ me nor is it wonder yet i speak the
truth what you saw from the tower wa a plai in which the seor brome
took hi part badli enough as you mai have notic becaus i told him
that my life hung on it i have nurs him through a sore sick
seora and he is not ungrat
so i judg but i do not understand you
seora i am a slave in thi hous a discard slave perhap you can
guess the rest it is a common stori here i wa offer my freedom at a
price that i should weav myself into thi man heart i who am held
fair and make him my lover if i fail then perhap i should be sold
as a slaveperhap wors i acceptedwhi should i not it wa a small
thing to me on the on hand life freedom and wealth an hidalgo of
good blood and a gallant friend for a littl while and on the other
the last shame or black which doubtless await me nowif i am found
out seora i fail who in truth did not try hard to succe the man
look on me as hi nurs no more and to me he wa on veri sick no
more also we grew to be true friend and in thi wai or in that i
learn all hi stori learn also why the trap wa bait thusthat
you might be deceiv and fall into a deeper trap seora i could not
explain it all to him inde in that chamber where we were spi on i
had but littl chanc still it wa necessari that he should seem to be
what he is not so i took him into the garden and know well who
watch us made him act hi part well enough to deceiv you it
would seem
still i do not understand said margaret more softli you sai that
your life or welfar hung on thi shame busi then why do you
reveal it to me now
to save you from yourself seora to save my friend the seor brome
and to pai back morella in hi own coin
how will you do these thing
the first two ar done i think but the third is difficult it is of
that i come to speak with you at great risk inde had not my master
been summon to the court of the moorish king i could not have come
and he mai return at ani time

courtyard to a hous beyond a tumbledown place of moorish
architectur

and take care of the rat and beetl
then he led her down a ricketi stair which open out of the courtyard
into vault fill with vat of wine and have lit a taper through
these shut and lock sundri door behind him to what appear to
be a veri damp wall cover with cobweb and situat in a dark corner
of a winecav here he stop and tap again in hi peculiar
fashion whereon a portion of the wall turn outward on a pivot
leav an open through which thei could pass
well manag isnt it chuckl israel who would think of look
for an entranc here especi if he ow the old jew monei come in

seem to have no window wait here he said to inez point to a
couch on which she sat herself down while i fetch my lodger and he
vanish through some curtain at the end of the room
present these open again and israel reappear through them with
castel dress now in moorish robe and look somewhat pale from
hi confin underground but otherwis well enough inez rose and
stood befor him throw back her veil that he might see her face
castel search her for a while with hi keen ey that note
everyth then said

friend here ar you not prove it to me now by repeat my messag
inez obei tell him everyth
that is right he said but how do i know that i can trust you i

such an on he might well emploi as a spy to bring us all to ruin
is it not too late to ask such question seor if i am not to be
trust alreadi you and your peopl ar in the hollow of my hand
not at all not at all my dear said israel if we see the slightest
caus to doubt you why there ar mani great vat in thi place on of
which at a pinch would serv you as a coffin though it would be a
piti to spoil the good wine
inez laugh as she answer
save your wine and your time too morella ha cast me off and i hate
him and wish to escap from him and rob him of hi prize also i
desir monei to live on afterward and thi you must give to me or i
do not stir or rather the promis of it for you jew keep your word

the seor brome safe and free outsid the wall of granada and to
leav the marqui of morella marri to anoth woman

in the programm

your daughter rel the handsom betti
how will you manag that exclaim castel amaz
these cousin ar not unlik seor although the link of blood between
them is so thin listen now i will tell you and she explain the
outlin of her plan
a bold scheme enough said castel when she had finish but even
if it can be done would that marriag hold
i think so answer inez if the priest knewand he could be
bribedand the bride know but if not what would it matter sinc
rome alon can decid the question and long befor that is done the
fate of all of us will be settl
romeor death said castel and inez read what he wa afraid of in
hi ey
your betti take her chanc she repli slowli as mani a on ha
done befor her with less caus she is a woman with a mind as strong as
her bodi morella made her love him and promis to marri her then he
us her to steal your daughter and she learn that she had been no
more than a stalkingheif from behind which he would net the white
swan do you not think therefor that she ha someth to pai him
back she through whom her belov mistress and cousin ha been brought
into all thi troubl if she win she becom the wife of a grande of
spain a marchio and if she lose well she ha had her fling for
a high stake and perhap her reveng at least she is will to take
her chanc and meanwhil all of you can be gone
castel look doubtfulli at the jew israel who stroke hi white beard
and said
let the woman set out her scheme at ani rate she is no fool and it is
worth our hear though i fear that at the best it must be costli
i can pai said castel and motion to inez to proce
as yet howev she had not much more to sai save that thei must have
good hors at hand and send a messeng to sevil whither the
margaret had been order to proce bid her captain hold hi
ship readi to sail at ani hour should thei succe in reach him
these thing then thei arrang and a while later inez and israel
depart the former carri with her a bag of gold
that same night inez sought the priest henriqu of motril in that
hall of morella palac which wa us as a privat chapel sai that
she desir to speak with him under pretenc of make confess for
thei were old friendsor rather enemi
as it chanc she found the holi father in a veri ill humour it
appear that morella also wa in a bad humour with henriqu have
heard that it wa he who had possess himself of the jewel in hi
strongbox on the san antonio now he insist upon hi surrend
everyth and swore moreov that he would hold him respons for
all that hi peopl had stolen from the ship and thi becaus he said
that it wa hi fault that peter brome had escap the sea and come on
to granada
so father said inez you who thought yourself rich ar poor
again
ye my daughter and that is what chanc to those who put their faith
in princ i have serv thi marqui well for mani yearsto my soul
hurt i fear mehop that he who stand so high in the favour of the
church would advanc me to some great prefer but instead what doe
he do he rob me of a few trinket that had i not found them the sea
would have swallow or some thief would have taken and declar me hi
debtor for the rest of which i know noth
what prefer did you want father i see that you have on in your
mind
daughter a friend had written to me from sevil that if i have a
hundr gold doubloon to pai for it he can secur me the place of a
secretari in the holi offic where i serv befor as a familiar until
the marqui made me hi chaplain and gave the benefic of motril which
prove worth noth and mani promis that ar worth less now those
trinket would fetch thirti and i have save twenti and came here to
borrow the other fifti from the marqui to whom i have done so mani
good turnsa you know well inez you see the end of that quest
and he groan angrili
it is a piti said inez thoughtfulli sinc those who serv the
inquisit save mani soul do thei not includ their own for
instanc she ad and the priest winc at the word i rememb
that thei save the soul of my own sister and would have save mine had
i beenwhat shall i saymoremor prejud also thei get a
percentag of the good of wick heret and so becom rich and abl
to advanc themselv
that is so inez it wa the chanc of a lifetim especi to on
who like myself hate heret but why speak of it now when that
curs dissolut marqui and he check himself
inez look at him
father she ask if i happen to be abl to find you those hundr
gold doubloon would you do someth for me
the priest foxi face lit up
i wonder what there is that i would not do my daughter
even if it brought you into a quarrel with the marqui
onc i wa a secretari to the inquisit of sevil he would have
more reason to fear me than i him ay and fear me he should who bear
him no love answer the priest with a snarl
then listen father i have not made my confess yet i have not told
you for instanc that i also hate thi marqui and with good
causethough perhap you know that alreadi but rememb that if you
betrai me you will never see those hundr gold doubloon and some
other holi priest will be appoint secretari at sevil also wors
thing mai happen to you
proce my daughter he said unctuous ar we not in the
confessionalor near it
so she told him all the plot trust to the man avaric and other
matter to protect her for inez hate frai henriqu bitterli and knew
him from the crown of hi shaven head to the sole of hi er feet
as she had good caus to do onli she did not tell him whenc the monei
wa to come
that doe not seem a veri difficult matter he said when she had
finish if a man and a woman unw and outsid the prohibit
degre appear befor me to be marri i marri them and onc the ring
ha pass and the offic is said marri thei ar till death or the
pope part them
and suppos that the man think he is marri anoth woman father
the priest shrug hi shoulder
he should know whom he is marri that is hi affair not the
church or mine the name need not be spoken too loudli my daughter
but you would give me a write of the marriag with them set out
plain
certainli to you or to anybodi els why should i notthat is if i
were sure of thi wed fee
inez lift her hand and show beneath it a littl pile of ten
doubloon

he is a great villain as i have reason to know still i think i can
she answer while the cabbag is in front of the donkei nosei
mean until he ha got all the monei also he ha commit himself by
take some on account but befor we go further the question isdo
thi ladi plai and she point to betti

squeez flatlik some peopl and she glanc at the humblelook
inez so befor all is done it mai be uglier for him
when she had master the mean of thi speech the softvoic inez
lift her gentl ey in admir and murmur a spanish proverb as
to what is suppos to occur when satan encount beelzebub in a
highwal lane then be a ladi of resourc and experi the
plot have been final decid upon not altogeth with margaret
approv who fear for betti fate when it should be discov inez
began to instruct them both in variou practic expedi by mean of
which the undoubt gener resembl of these cousin might be
heighten and their differ tone down to thi end she promis to

the love margaret for even if thei chang skin who can make the
calf look like the fawn though thei chanc to feed in the same meadow
still bring your stuff and i will do my best but i think that a thick
veil and a shut mouth will help me more than ani of them also a long
gown to hide my feet
sure thei ar charm feet said inez polit ad to herself
to carri you whither you wish to go then she turn to margaret and
remind her that the marqui desir to see her and wait for

visibl at certain recollect
the gentl inez smile as she said
ye but sure you can seem jealou for that is natur to us all
and you can yield by degre and you can make a bargain as the price of
yourself in marriag

and that letter sign by that priest and announc the marriag
shall be deliv to the archbishop of sevil and to their majesti
king ferdinand and queen isabella also of cours you must arrang

window swear that thereaft at nightfal of the same dai you will
suffer the priest to do hi offic and make you morella wife by that
time thei should be well upon their road and after the rite is
celebr i will receiv the sign paper from the priest and follow
them leav the fals bride to plai her part as best she can

if onli for a littl while yet across their joi like the sound of a
funer bell at a merri feast came the thought of betti and that
fate marriag in which er now she must have plai her part inde
at last margaret knelt down and offer up prayer to heaven that the
saint might protect her cousin in the great peril which she had

thei rode on without accid for the most part over a fertil plain
water by sever river which thei cross at ford or over bridg
as night fell thei reach the old town of oxuna which for mani hour
thei had seen set upon it hill befor them and notwithstand their
moorish dress made their wai almost unobserv in the dark to that

thei had hope too that here at oxuna inez might overtak them as she
had promis to do if she could and give them tide of what had
happen sinc thei left granada but no inez came so comfort
themselv with the thought that howev hard she rode it would be
difficult for her to reach them who had some hour start thei left

hillsid on to a plain which separ them from more hill also cloth
with corktre thi plain wa about three mile wide and boggi in
place still thei kept well ahead of the brigand as thei took them to
be hope that thei would give up the pursuit or lose sight of them
amongst the tree as thei enter these howev to their dismai thei
saw drawn up in front of them and right across the road anoth band
of roughlook men perhap twelv in all
trap said peter we must ride through themit is our onli chanc
at the same time spur hi hors to the front and draw hi sword

easili enough but next second heard a cry from margaret and pull hi
hors round to see that her mare had fallen and that she and castel
were in the hand of the thiev inde alreadi rough men had hold of
her and on of them wa try to tear the veil from her face with a
shout of rage peter charg them and struck so fierc a blow that hi
sword cut through the fellow helmet into hi skull so that he fell

then thei rush at him five or six of them and although he wound
anoth man drag him from hi hors and as he lai upon hi back
sprang at him to finish him befor he could rise alreadi their knive
and sword were over him and he wa make hi farewel to life when
he heard a voic command them to desist and bind hi arm thi wa
quickli done and he wa suffer to rise from the ground to see befor
him not morella as he half expect but a man clad in fine armour
beneath hi rough cloak evid an offic of rank what kind of a
moor ar you he ask who dare to kill the soldier of the holi
hermandad in the heart of the king countri and he point to

chapter xix
betti pai her debt
betti dene wa not a woman afflict with fear or apprehens born
of good parent but in poverti for sixandtwenti year she had fought
her own wai in a rough world and made the best of circumst
healthi fullblood tough affection romant but honest in her
wai she wa well fit to meet the up and down of life to keep her
head abov the water of a turbul ag and to pai back as much as she
receiv from man or woman
yet those long hour which she pass alon in the high turret chamber
wait till thei summon her to plai the part of a fals bride were
the worst that she had ever spent she knew that her posit wa in a
sens shame and like to end in tragedi and now that she face it
in cold blood began to wonder why she had chosen so to do she had
fallen in love with the spaniard almost at first sight though it is
true that someth like thi had happen to her befor with other men
then he had plai hi part with her till quit deceiv she gave all
her heart to him in good earnest believ in her infatu that
notwithstand the differ of their place and rank he desir to
make her hi wife for her own sake
afterward came that bitter dai of disillus when she learn as
inez had said to castel that she wa but a stalk heifer us for
the take of the white swan her cousin and mistressthat dai when she
had been beguil by the letter which wa still hid in her garment and
for her pain heard herself call a fool to her face in her heart she
had sworn to be aveng upon morella then and now the hour had come in
which to fulfil her oath and plai him back trick for cruel trick
did she still love the man she could not sai he wa pleas to her as
he had alwai been and when that is so women forgiv much thi wa
certain howeverlov wa not her guid tonight wa it vengeanc then
that led her on perhap at least she long to be abl to sai to him
see what craft li hid even in the bosom of an outwit fool
yet she would not have done it for vengeanc sake alon or rather she
would have paid herself in some other fashion no her real reason wa
that she must discharg the debt due to margaret and peter and to
castel who had shelter her for year she it wa who had brought them
into all thi woe and it seem but just that she should bring them out
again even at the cost of her own life and womanli digniti or
perchanc all three of these power drove her onlov for the man if
it still linger the desir to be aveng upon him and the desir to
snatch hi prei from out hi maw at least she had set the game and she
would plai it out to it end howev aw that might be
the sun sank the dark close about her and she wonder whether
ever again she would see the dawn her brave heart quail a littl and
she grip the dagger hilt beneath her splendid borrow robe
think to herself that perhap it might be wisest to drive it into her
own breast and not wait until a balk madman did that offic for her
yet not so for it is alwai time to die when on must
a knock came at the door and her courag which had sunk so low burn
up again within her oh she would teach thi spaniard that the
englishwoman whom he had made believ wa hi desir mistress could

now some in the court exclaim

then the queen said

much seor brome but how know we that it is true for instanc you
said that the nobl marqui stole two ladi a deed of which i can
scarc think him capabl where then is the other
i believ answer peter that she is now the wife of the marqui of

then bernaldez stood forward state hi name and occup and that

now the governor of the prison stood forward and ask what wa to be
done with the captiv until the wit could be brought from
granada the queen answer that thei must remain in hi charg and be
well treat whereon peter prai that he might be given a better cell
with fewer rat and more light the queen smile and said that it
should be so but ad that it would be proper that he should still be
kept apart from the ladi to whom he wa affianc who could dwell with
her father then note the sad on their face she ad
yet i think thei mai meet daili in the garden of the prison
margaret curtsei and thank her whereon she said veri gracious
come here seora and sit by me a littl and she point to a
footstool at her side when i have done thi busi i desir a few
word with you
so margaret wa brought up upon the dai and sat down at her majesti
left hand upon the broider footstool and veri fair inde she look
place thu abov the crowd she whose beauti and whose bear were so
royal but castel and peter were led awai back to the prison though
see so mani gai lord about the latter went unwillingli enough a
while later when the case were finish the queen dismiss the court
save for certain offic who stood at a distanc and turn to
margaret said
now fair maiden tell me your stori as on woman to anoth and do
not fear that anyth you sai will be made us of at the trial of your

sai first ar you realli the affianc of that tall gentleman and ha
he realli your heart
all of it your majesti answer margaret and we have suffer much
for each other sake then in as few word as she could she told their
tale while the queen listen earnestli
a strang stori inde and if it be all true a shame she said
when margaret had finish but how come it that if morella desir to
forc you into marriag he is now wed to your companion and cousin
what ar you keep back from me and she glanc at her shrewdli
your majesti answer margaret i wa asham to speak the rest yet
i will trust you and do so prai your royal forgiv if you hold
that we who were in desper strait have done what is wrong my
cousin betti dene ha paid back morella in hi own fals gold he won
her heart and promis to marri her and at the risk of her own life she
took my place at the altar therebi secur our escap
a brave deed if a doubt said the queen though i question
whether such a marriag will be upheld but that is a matter for the
church to judg of and i must speak of it no more certainli it is hard
to be angri with ani of you what did you sai that morella promis you
when he ask you to marri him in london
your majesti he promis that he would lift me high perhap
evenand she hesitatedto that seat in which you sit
isabella frown then laugh and said as she look her up and down
you would fit it well better than i do in truth but what els did he
sai
your majesti he said that not everi on love the king hi uncl
that he had mani friend who rememb that hi father wa poison by
the father of the king who wa morella grandfath also that hi
mother wa a princess of the moor and that he might throw in hi lot
with their or that there were other wai in which he could gain
hi end
so so said the queen well though he is such a good son of the
church and my lord is so fond of him i never love morella and i
thank you for your warn but i must not speak to you of such high
matter though it seem that some have thought otherwis fair
margaret have you aught to ask of me
ye your majestythat you will deal gentli with my true love when he
come befor you for trial rememb that he is hot of head and
strong of arm and that such knight as hefor knightli is hi blood
cannot brook to see their ladi mishandl by rough men and the
wrap that shield them torn from off their bosom also i prai that
i mai be protect from morella that he mai not be allow to touch or
even to speak to me who for all hi rank and splendour hate him as
though he were some poison snake
i have said that i must not prejudg your case you beauti english
margaret the queen answer with a smile yet i think that neither of
those thing you ask will caus justic to slip the bandag that is
about her ey go and be at peac if you have spoken truth to me as
i am sure you have and isabella of spain can prevent it the seor
brome punish shall not be heavi nor shall the shadow of the
marqui of morella the baseborn son of a princ and of some royal
infidelthes word she spoke with much bitternessso much as fall
upon you though i warn you that my lord the king love the man as is
but natur and will not condemn him lightli tell me on thing thi
lover of your is brave is he not
veri brave answer margaret smile
and he can ride a hors and hold a lanc can he not at ani rate in
your quarrel
ay your majesti and wield a sword too as well as most knight
though he ha been but late sick some learn that on
bosworth field
good now farewel and she gave margaret her hand to kiss then
call two of her offic she bade them conduct her back to the
prison and sai that she should have liberti to send messag or to
write to her the queen if she should so desir
on the night of that same dai morella gallop into sevil inde he
should have been there long befor but misl by the stori of the moor
who had escort peter margaret and her father out of granada and seen
them take the malaga road he travel thither first onli to find no
trace of them in that citi then he return and track them to
sevil where he wa soon made acquaint with all that had happen
amongst other thing he discov that ten hour befor swift
messeng had been despatch to granada command hi attend and
that of betti with whom he had gone through the form of marriag
on the follow morn he ask an audienc with the queen but it wa
refus to him and the king hi uncl wa awai next he tri to win
admiss into the prison and see margaret onli to find that neither
hi high rank and author nor ani bribe would suffic to unlock it
door the queen had command otherwis he wa inform and knew
therefrom that in thi matter he must reckon with isabella as an enemi
then he bethought him of reveng and began a search for inez and the
priest henriqu of motril onli to find that the former had vanish
none knew whither and the holi father wa safe within the wall of the
inquisit whenc he wa care not to emerg and where no layman
howev highli place could enter to lai a hand upon on of it
offic so full of rage and disappoint he took counsel of
lawyer and friend and prepar to defend the suit which he saw would
be brought against him hope that chanc might yet deliv margaret
into hi hand on good card he held which now he determin to plai
castel as he knew wa a jew who for year had pose as a christian
and for such there wa no merci in sevil perhap for her father
sake he might yet be abl to work upon margaret whom now he desir to
win more fierc than ever befor
at least it wa certain that he would try thi or ani other mean
howev base rather than see her marri to hi rival peter brome
also there wa the chanc that thi peter might be condemn to
imprison or even to death for the kill of a soldier of the
hermandad
so morella made him readi for the great struggl as best he could and
sinc he could not stop her come await the arriv of betti
in sevil
chapter xxi
betti state her case
seven dai had pass dure which time margaret and her father had
rest quietli in the prison where inde thei dwelt more as guest
than as captiv thu thei were allow to receiv what visitor thei
would and among them juan bernaldez castel connect and agent
who told them of all that pass without through him thei sent
messeng to meet betti on her road and appris her of how thing
stood and of the trial in which her caus would be judg
soon the messeng return state that the marchio of morella
wa travel in state accompani by a great retinu that she
thank them for their tide and hope to be abl to defend herself
at all point
at thi new castel stare and margaret laugh for although she did
not know all the stori she wa sure that in some wai betti had the
masteri of morella and would not be easili defeat though how she
came to be travel with a great retinu she could not imagin still
fear lest she should be attack or otherwis injur she wrote a
humbl letter to the queen prai that her cousin might be defend
from all danger at the hand of ani on whomsoev until she had an
opportun of give evid befor their majesti
within an hour came the answer that the ladi wa under the royal
protect and that a guard had been sent to escort her and her parti
and to keep her safe from interfer of ani sort also that for her
greater comfort quarter had been prepar for her in a fortress
outsid of sevil which would be watch night and dai and whenc she
would be brought to the court
peter wa still kept apart from them but each dai at noon thei were
allow to meet him in the wall garden of the prison where thei
talk togeth to their heart content here too he exercis
himself daili at all manli game and especi at swordplai with some
of the other prison us stick for sword further he wa allow
the us of hi hors that he had ridden from granada on which he
joust in the yard of the castl with the governor and certain other
gentlemen prove himself better at that plai than ani of them these
thing he did vigor and with ardour for margaret had told him of
the hint which the queen gave her and he desir to get back hi full
strength and to perfect himself in the handl of everi arm which wa
us in spain
so the time went by until on afternoon the governor inform them that
peter trial wa fix for the morrow and that thei must accompani him
to the court to be examin also upon all these matter a littl later
came bernaldez who said that the king had return and would sit with
the queen and that alreadi thi affair had made much stir in sevil
where there wa much curios as to the stori of morella marriag of
which mani differ tale were told that margaret and her father would
be discharg he had littl doubt in which case their ship wa readi
for them but of peter chanc he could sai noth for thei depend
upon what view the king took of hi offenc and though unacknowledg
morella wa the king nephew and had hi ear
afterward thei went down into the garden and there found peter who
had just return from hi joust flush with exercis and look
veri manli and handsom margaret took hi hand and walk asid told
him the new
i am glad he answer for the sooner thi busi is begun the
sooner it will be done but sweet and here hi face grew veri
earnest morella ha much power in thi land and i have broken it
law so none know what the end will be i mai be condemn to death or
imprison or perhap if i am given the chanc with better luck i mai
fall fight in ani of which case we shall be separ for a while
or altogeth should thi be so i prai that you will not stai here
either in the hope of rescu me or for other reason sinc while
you ar in spain morella will not ceas from hi attempt to get hold
of you wherea in england you will be safe from him
when margaret heard these word she sob aloud for the thought that
harm might come to peter seem to choke her
in all thing i will do your bid she said yet how can i leav
you dear while you ar aliv and if perchanc you should die which
mai god prevent how can i live on without you rather shall i seek to
follow you veri swiftli
i do not desir that said peter i desir that you should endur
your dai till the end and come to meet me where i am in due season
and not befor i will add thi that if in afteryear you should meet
ani worthi man and have a mind to marri him you should do so for i
know well that you will never forget me your first love and that
beyond thi world lie other where there ar no marri or give in
marriag let not my dead hand lie heavi upon you margaret
yet she repli in gentl indign heavi must it alwai lie
sinc it is about my heart be sure of thi peter that if such
dread ill should fall upon us as you left me so shall you find me
here or hereaft
so be it he said with a sigh of relief for he could not bear to
think of margaret as the wife of some other man even after he wa gone
although hi honest simpl natur and fear lest her life might be made
empti of all joi caus him to sai what he had said
then behind the shelter of a flower bush thei embrac each other as
do those who know not whether thei will ever kiss again and the hour
of sunset have come part as thei must
on the follow morn onc more castel and margaret were led to the
hall of justic in the alcazar but thi time peter did not go with
them the great court wa alreadi full of counsellor offic
gentlemen and ladi who had come from curios and other folk
connect with or interest in the case as yet howev margaret
could not see morella or betti nor had the king and queen taken their
seat upon the throne peter wa alreadi there stand befor the bar
with guard on either side of him and greet them with a smile and a
nod as thei were usher to their chair near by just as thei reach
them also trumpet were blown and from the back of the hall walk
hand in hand appear their majesti of spain ferdinand and isabella
whereat all the audienc rose and bow remain stand till thei
were seat on the throne
the king whom thei now saw for the first time wa a thickset activ
man with pleasant ey a fair skin and a broad forehead but as
margaret thought somewhat slyfacedth face of a man who never forgot
hi own interest in those of anoth like the queen he wa
magnific attir in garment broider with gold and the arm of
aragon while in hi hand he held a golden sceptr surmount by a
jewel and about hi waist to show that he wa a warlik king he wore
hi long crosshandl sword smilingli he acknowledg the homag of
hi subject by lift hi hand to hi cap and bow then hi ey
fell upon the beauti margaret and turn he put a question to the
queen in a light sharp voic ask if that were the ladi whom morella
had marri and if so why in the name of heaven he wish to be
rid of her
isabella answer that she understood that thi wa the seora whom he
had desir to marri when he marri some on els as he alleg by
mistak but who wa in fact affianc to the prison befor them a
repli at which all who heard it laugh
at thi moment the marqui of morella accompani by hi gentlemen and
some longgown lawyer appear walk up the court dress in the
black velvet that he alwai wore and glitter with order upon hi
head wa a cap also of black velvet from which hung a great pearl and
thi cap he did not remov even when he bow to the king and queen for
he wa on of the few grande of spain who had the right to remain
cover befor their majesti thei acknowledg hi salut
ferdinand with a friendli nod and isabella with a cold bow and he too
took the seat that had been prepar for him just then there wa a
disturb at the far end of the court where on of it offic could
be heard call
wai make wai for the marchio of morella at the sound of thi
name the marqui whose ey were fix on margaret frown fierc
rise from hi seat as though to protest then at some whisper word
from a lawyer behind him sat down again
now the crowd of spectat separ and margaret turn to look
down the long hall saw a process advanc up the lane between them
some clad in armour and some in white moorish robe blazon with the
scarlet eagl the cognis of morella in the midst of them her
train support by two moorish women walk a tall and beauti ladi
a coronet upon her brow her fair hair outspread a purpl cloak hang
from her shoulder half hide that same splendid robe sewn with pearl
which had been morella gift to margaret and about her white bosom the
chain of pearl which he had present to betti in compens for
her injuri
margaret stare and stare again and her father at her side murmur
it is our betti truli fine feather make fine bird ye betti it
wa without a doubt though rememb her in her humbl woollen dress
at the old hous in holborn it wa hard to recognis the poor companion
in thi proud and magnific ladi who look as though all her life
she had trodden the marbl floor of court and consort with nobl
and with queen up the great hall she came state imperturb
look neither to the right nor to the left take no note of the
whisper about her no nor even of morella or of margaret till she
reach the open space in front of the bar where peter and hi guard
gaze with all their ey hasten to make place for her there she
curtsei thrice twice to the queen and onc to the king her consort
then turn bow to the marqui who fix hi ey upon the ground
and took no note bow to castel and peter and lastli advanc to
margaret gave her her cheek to kiss thi margaret did with becom
humil whisper in her ear
how fare your grace
better than you would in my shoe whisper betti back with ever so
slight a trembl of her left eyelid while margaret heard the king
mutter to the queen
a fine peacock of a woman look at her figur and those big ey
morella must be hard to pleas
perhap he prefer swan to peacock answer the queen in the same
voic with a glanc at margaret whose quieter and more refin beauti
seem to gain by contrast with that of her nobli built and
dazzlingskin cousin then she motion to betti to take the seat
prepar for her which she did with her suit stand behind her and
an interpret at her side
i am somewhat bewild said the king glanc from morella to
betti and from margaret to peter for evid the humour of the
situat did not escap him what is the exact case that we have
to try
then on of the legal assessor or alcald rose and said that the
matter befor their majesti wa a charg against the englishman at the
bar of kill a certain soldier of the holi hermandad but that there
seem to be other matter mix up with it
so i gather answer the king for instanc an accus of the
carri off of subject of a friendli power out of the territori of
that power a suit for nulliti of a marriag and a crosssuit for the
declar of the valid of the said marriageand the holi saint
know what besid well on thing at a time let us try thi tall
englishman
so the case wa open against peter by a public prosecutor who
restat it as it had been laid befor the queen the captain arrano
gave hi evid as to the kill of the soldier but in
crossexamin by peter advoc admit for evid he bore
no malic against the prison that the said soldier had roughli
handl the dona margaret and that the said peter be a stranger to
the countri might veri well have taken them for a troop of bandit or
even moor also he ad that he could not sai that the englishman
had intend to kill the soldier
then castel and margaret gave their evid the latter with much
modest sweet inde when she explain that peter wa her

by slow degre she came down to the war of the rose in which she

grant wa as nobl as ani in england
next she wa examin as to her relat with morella in london and

that in the end that also wa left unfinish so it wa with
everyth clever as morella advoc might be sometim in english
and sometim in the spanish tongu betti overwhelm him with word
and apt answer until abl to make noth of her the poor man sat

then the secretari were sworn and after them variou member of
morella household who although somewhat unwillingli confirm all
that betti had said as to hi embrac her with lift veil and the
rest so at length betti close her case reserv the right to address
the court after she had heard that of the marqui
now the king queen and their assessor consult for a littl while
for evid there wa a divis of opinion among them some think
that the case should be stop at onc and refer to anoth
tribun and other that it should go on at length the queen wa heard
to sai that at least the marqui of morella should be allow to make
hi statement as he might be abl to prove that all thi stori wa a
fabric and that he wa not even at granada at the time when the
marriag wa alleg to have taken place
the king and the alcald assent the marqui wa sworn and told hi
stori admit that it wa not on which he wa proud to repeat in
public he narrat how he had first met margaret betti and peter at a
public ceremoni in london and had then and there fallen in love with
margaret and accompani her home to the hous of her father the
merchant john castel
subsequ he discov that thi castel who had fled from spain
with hi father in childhood wa that lowest of mankind an unconvert
jew who pose as a christian at thi statement there wa a great
sensat in court and the queen face harden although it is true
that he had marri a christian ladi and that hi daughter had been
baptiz and brought up as a christian of which faith she wa a loyal
member nor did she knowa he believedthat her father remain a
jew sinc otherwis he would not have continu to seek her as hi
wife their majesti would be awar he went on that ow to reason
with which thei were acquaint he had mean of get at the truth of
these matter concern the jew in england as to which inde he
had alreadi written to them although ow to hi shipwreck and to the
pressur of hi privat affair he had not yet made hi report on hi
embassi in person
continu he said that he admit that he had made love to the
servingwoman betti in order to gain access to margaret whose father
mistrust him know someth of hi mission she wa a person of no
charact
here betti rose and said in a clear voic
i declar the marqui of morella to be a knave and a liar there is
more good charact in my littl finger than in hi whole bodi and
she ad than in that of hi mother befor himan allus at which
the marqui flush while satisfi for the present with thi
homethrust betti sat down
he had propos to margaret but she wa not will to marri him as he
found that she wa affianc to a distant cousin of her the seor
peter brome a swashbuckl who wa in troubl for the kill of a man
in london as he had kill the soldier of the holi hermandad in spain
therefor in hi despair be deepli enamour of her and know
that he could offer her great place and fortun he conceiv the idea
of carri her off and to do so wa oblig much against hi will to
abduct betti also
so after mani adventur thei came to granada where he wa abl to show
the dona margaret that the seor peter brome wa emploi hi
imprison in make love to that member of hi household inez who
had been spoken of but now could not be found
here peter who could bear thi no longer also rose and call him a
liar to hi face sai that if he had the opportun he would prove
it on hi bodi but wa order by the king to sit down and be silent
have been convinc of her lover unfaith the marqui went
on the dona margaret had at length consent to becom hi wife on
condit that her father the seor brome and her servant betti dene
were allow to escap from granada
where remark the queen you had no right to detain them marqui
except perhap the father john castel she ad significantli
where he admit with sorrow he had no right to detain them
therefor went on the queen acut there wa no legal or moral
consider for thi alleg promis of marriagea point at which
the lawyer nod approvingli
the marqui submit that there wa a consider that at ani rate
the dona margaret wish it on the dai arrang for the wed the
prison were let go disguis as moor but he now knew that through
the trickeri of the woman inez whom he believ had been bribe by
castel and hi fellowjew the dona margaret escap in place of her
servant betti with whom he subsequ went through the form of
marriag believ her to be margaret
as regard the embrac befor the ceremoni it took place in a shadow
room and he thought that betti face and hair must have been paint
and dy to resembl those of margaret for the rest he wa certain
that the ceremoni cup of wine that he drank befor he led the woman to
the altar wa drug sinc he onli rememb the marriag itself veri
dimli and after that noth at all until he woke upon the follow
morn with an ach brow to see betti sit by him as for the
power of administr which she produc be perfectli mad at the
time with rage and disappoint and sure that if he stop there ani
longer he should commit the crime of kill thi woman who had deceiv
him so cruelli he gave it that he might escap from her their
majesti would notic also that it wa in favour of the marchio of
morella as thi marriag wa null and void there wa no marchio of
morella therefor the document wa null and void also that wa the
truth and all he had to sai
chapter xxii
the doom of john castel
hi evid finish the marqui of morella sat down whereon the
king and queen have whisper togeth the head alcald ask betti
if she had ani question to put to him she rose with much digniti and
through her interpret said in a quiet voic
ye a great mani yet she would not debas herself by ask a singl
on until the stain which he had cast upon her wa wash awai which
she thought could onli be done in blood he had alleg that she wa a
woman of no charact and he had further alleg that their marriag
wa null and void be of the sex she wa she could not ask him to
make good hi assert at the sword point therefor as she
believ she had the right to do accord to all the law of honour
she ask leav to seek a championif an unfriend woman could find
on in a strang landto uphold her fair name against thi base and
cruel slander
now in the silenc that follow her speech peter rose and said
i ask the permiss of your majesti to be that champion your
majesti will note that accord to hi own stori i have suffer from
thi marqui the bitterest wrong that on man can receiv at the hand
of anoth also he ha li in sai that i am not true to my

the lie upon him lastli i declar that i believ the seora betti to
be a good and upright woman upon whom no shadow of shame ha ever
fallen and as her countryman and rel i desir to uphold her good
name befor all the world i am a foreign here with few friend or
none yet i cannot believ that your majesti will withhold from me the
right of battl which all over the world in such a case on gentleman
mai demand of anoth i challeng the marqui of morella to mortal
combat without merci to the fallen and here is the proof of it
then step across the open space befor the bar he drew the
leathern gauntlet off hi hand and threw it straight into morella
face think that after such an insult he could not choos but fight
with an oath morella snatch at hi sword but befor he could draw
it offic of the court threw themselv on him and the king stern
voic wa heard command them to ceas their brawl in the royal
presenc
i ask your pardon sire gasp morella but you have seen what thi
englishman did to me a grande of spain
ye broke in the queen but we have also heard what you a grande
of spain did to thi gentleman of england and the charg you brought
against him which it seem the dona margaret doe not believ
in truth no your majesti said margaret let me be sworn also and
i can explain much of what the marqui ha told to you i never wish
to marri him or ani man save thi on and she touch peter on the
arm and anyth that he or i mai have done we did to escap the evil
net in which we were snare
we believ it answer the queen with a smile then fell to
consult with the king and the alcald
for a long time thei debat in voic so low that none could hear what
thei said look now at on and now at anoth of the parti to thi
strang suit also some priest wa call into their council which
margaret thought a bad omen at length thei made up their mind and in
a low quiet voic and measur word her majesti as queen of castil
gave the judgment of them all address herself first to morella
she said
my lord marqui you have brought veri grave charg against the ladi
who claim to be your wife and the englishman whose affianc bride you
admit you snatch awai by fraud and forc thi gentleman on hi own
behalf and on behalf of these ladi ha challeng you to a combat to
the death in a fashion that none can mistak do you accept hi
challeng
i would accept it readili enough your majesti answer morella in
sullen tone sinc heretofor none have doubt my courag but i must
rememb that i amand he paus then addedwhat your majesti

scarc law for me to cross sword with a jewmerch clerk for

you could cross them with me on your ship the san antonio
exclaim peter bitterli why then ar you asham to finish what you
were not asham to begin moreov i tell you that in love or war i
hold myself the equal of ani womanthief and bastard in thi kingdom
who am on of a name that ha been honour in my own
now again the king and queen spoke togeth of thi question of rankno
small on in that ag and countri then isabella said
it is true that a grande of spain cannot be ask to meet a simpl
foreign gentleman in singl combat therefor sinc he ha thought fit
to rais it we uphold the object of the marqui of morella and
declar that thi challeng is not bind on hi honour yet we note
hi willing to accept the same and ar prepar to do what we can
to make the matter easi so that it mai not be said that a spaniard who
ha wrought wrong to an englishman and been ask openli to make the
amend of arm in the presenc of hi sovereign wa debar from so
do by the accid of hi rank seor peter brome if you will
receiv it at our hand as other of your nation have been proud to do
we propos believ you to be a brave and loyal man of gentl birth
to confer upon you the knighthood of the order of st jame and therebi
and therein the right to consort with as equal or to fight as equal
ani nobl of spain unless he should be of the right bloodroy to
which place we think the most puissant and excel marqui of morella
lai no claim
i thank your majesti said peter astonish for the honour that
you would do to me which had it not been for the fact that my father
chose the wrong side on bosworth field be of a race somewhat
obstin in the matter of loyalti i should not have need to accept
from your majesti as it is i am veri grate sinc now the nobl
marqui need not feel debas in settl our long quarrel as he would
desir to do
come hither and kneel down seor peter brome said the queen when he
had finish speak
he obei and isabella borrow hi sword from the king gave him the
accolad by strike him thrice upon the right shoulder and sai
rise sir peter brome knight of the most nobl order of saint iago
and by creation a don of spain
he rose he bow retreat backward as wa the custom and therebi
nearli fall off the dai which some peopl thought a good omen for
morella as he went the king said
our marshal sir peter will arrang the time and manner of your combat
with the marqui as shall be most conveni to you both meanwhil we
command you both that no unseemli word or deed should pass between you
who must soon meet face to face to abid the judgment of god in battl
loutranc rather sinc on of you must die so shortli do we
entreat you to prepar your soul to appear befor hi judgmentseat we
have spoken
now the audienc appear to think that the court wa end for mani of
them began to rise but the queen held up her hand and said
there remain other matter on which we must give judgment the seora
here and she point to betti ask that her marriag should be
declar valid or so we understand and the marqui of morella ask
that hi marriag with the said seora should be declar void or so
we understand now thi is a question over which we claim no power it
have to do with a sacrament of the church therefor we leav it to
hi holi the pope in person or by hi legat to decid accord
to hi wisdom in such manner as mai seem best to him if the parti
concern should choos to lai their suit befor him meanwhil we
declar and decre that the seora born elizabeth dene shall

shall make due provis for her mainten and that after hi death
should no decis have been come to by the court of rome upon her suit
she shall inherit and enjoi that proport of hi land and properti
which belong to a wife under the law of thi realm
now while betti bow her thank to their majesti till the jewel on
her bodic rattl and morella scowl till hi face look as black as
a thundercloud abov the mountain the audienc whisper to each
other onc more rose to dispers again the queen held up her hand for
the judgment wa not yet finish
we have a question to ask of the gallant sir peter brome and the dona

singl combat between the marqui of morella and sir peter brome
rememb dona margaret befor you answer that in thi event you mai
soon be made a widow and that if you postpon the ceremoni you mai
never be a wife
now margaret and peter spoke a few word togeth then the former
answer for them both

utter the word in either case my heart will be widow and broken
let me live out my dai therefor bear hi name that know my
deathless grief none mai thenceforth troubl me with their love who

some attempt should be made on you
she ceas whereon suddenli the king began speak in hi sharp thin
voic
have settl these matter of chivalri and marriag he said there
remain anoth which i will not leav to the gentl lip of our
sovereign ladi that ha to do with someth higher than either of
themnam the etern welfar of men soul and of the church of
christ on earth it ha been declar to us that the man yonder john
castel merchant of london is that accurs thing a jew who for the
sake of gain ha all hi life feign to be a christian and as such
deceiv a christian woman into marriag that he is moreov of our
subject have been born in spain and therefor amen to the civil
and spiritu jurisdict of thi realm
he paus while margaret and peter stare at each other affright
onli castel stood silent and unmov though he guess what must
follow better than either of them
we judg him not went on the king who claim no author in such
high matter but we do what we must dow commit him to the holi
inquisit there to take hi trial
now margaret cri aloud peter stare about him as though for help
which he knew could never come feel more afraid than ever he had
been in all hi life and for the first time that dai morella smile
at least he would be rid of on enemi but castel went to margaret and
kiss her tenderli then he shook peter by the hand sai
kill that thief and he look at morella as i know you will and
would if there were ten as bad at hi back and be a good husband to my
girl as i know you will also for i shall ask an account of you of
these matter when we meet where there is neither jew nor christian
priest nor king now be silent and bear what must be born as i do for
i have a word to sai befor i leav you and the world
your majesti i make no plea for myself and when i am question
befor your inquisit the task will be easi for i desir to hide

at least ar good enough christian from their birth shall be wed i
would ask you if ani spiritu crime or suppos crime of mine will be

noth of which you mai be convict shall affect them in person or
she ad slowli in properti

at our instanc or that of our offic let my word be written down

of spain and bring her great to the dust of death the tortur and
the miseri of those jew than whom you have no better or more faith
subject shall be aveng on the head of your children children for
so long as their blood endur
he finish speak and while someth that sound like a gasp of
fear rose from that crowd court as the mean of castel bold word
came home to hi auditor the crowd behind him separ and there
appear walk two by two a file of mask and hood monk and a
guard of soldier all of whom doubtless were in wait thei came to
john castel thei touch him on the shoulder thei close around him
hide him as it were from the world and in the midst of them he
vanish awai
peter memori of that strang dai in the alcazar at sevil alwai
remain somewhat dim and blur it wa not wonder within the
space of a few hour he had been tri for hi life and acquit he
had seen betti transform from a humbl companion into a magnific
and glitter marchio as a chrysali is transform into a
butterfli urg her strang suit against the husband who had trick
her and whom she had trick and for the while at ani rate more than
hold her own thank to her readi wit and nativ strength of charact
as her champion and that of margaret he had challeng morella to a
singl combat and when hi defianc wa refus on the ground of hi
lack of rank by the favour of the great isabella who wish to us him
as her instrument doubtless becaus of those secret ambit of
morella which margaret had reveal to her he had been suddenli
advanc to the high station of a knight of the order of st jame of
spain to which although he care littl for it otherwis he might
vainli have striven to come
more and better far the desir of hi heart would at length be
attain for now it wa grant to him to meet hi enemi the man whom
he hate with just caus upon a fair field without favour shown to on
or the other and to fight him to the death he had been promis
further that within some few dai margaret should be given to him as
wife although it well might be that she would keep that name but for a
singl hour and that until then thei both should dwell safe from
morella violenc and treacheri also that whatev chanc no suit
should lie against them in ani land for aught that thei did or had
done in spain
lastli when all seem safe save for that chanc of war whereof
have been bred to such thing he took but littl count when hi cup
empti at length of mire and sand wa brim full with the good red
wine of battl and of love when it wa at hi veri lip inde fate
had turn it to poison and to gall castel hi bride father and
the man he love had been hale to the vault of the inquisit
whenc he knew well he would come forth but onc more dress in a
yellow robe relax to the civil arm to perish slowli in the fire of
the quemadero the place of burn of heret
what would hi conquest over morella avail if heaven should give him
power to conquer what kind of a bridal would that be which wa seal
and consecr by the death of the bride father in the tortur
fire of the inquisit how would thei ever get the smell of the smoke

see her twice and found her brokenheart even the fact that thei
were to be wed upon the follow saturdai the dai fix also for the
combat between peter and morella brought her no joi or consol for
on the next dai the sundai there wa to be an act of faith an
autodaf in sevil when wick heret such as jew moor and
person who had spoken blasphemi were to suffer for their crimessom
by fire on the quemadero or place of burn outsid the citi some by

had the craft of a fox and the cruelti of a tiger she wa even
indign with margaret had not enough been done for her she ask
had she not even pass her royal word that no step should be taken to
depriv the accus of such properti as he might own in spain if he were
found guilti and that none of those penalti which accord to law
and custom fell upon the children of such infam person should
attach to her margaret wa she not to be publicli marri to her
lover and should he surviv the combat allow to depart with him in
honour without even be ask to see her father expiat hi iniqu

been in the dai when gladiat fought there over the main entranc
and opposit to the centr of the ring were place the king and queen
with their lord and ladi and between them but a littl behind her

a third time the trumpet sound and the two champion advanc from
their respect station drew rein side by side in front of their
majesti where the condit of the combat were read aloud to them by
the chief herald thei were short that the frai should be to the death

come about and fall upon the englishman befor he could recov himself
but the brute wa headi and would not be turn till he saw the wall of
face in front of him now thei were round both of them but peter had
no spear and no helm while the lanc of morella wa cumber with hi
adversari casqu that he strove to shake free from it but in vain
draw your sword shout voic to peterth english voic of smith
and hi sailorsand he put hi hand down to do so then bethought him
of some other counsel for he let it lie within it scabbard and
spur the white hors came at morella like a storm
the falcon will be spike thei scream the eagl winsth eagl

point the plume torn from hi own head he had judg well for up
flew those plume a littl a veri littl yet far enough to give him
space crouch on hi saddlebow to pass beneath the deadli spear
then as thei swept past each other out shot that long right arm of

the steel befor he could recov himself peter struck back but
morella bent hi knee and the stroke onli shore the black plume from

the englishman leapt to on side and the thrust went past him again
morella came at him and struck so mighti a blow that although peter

a strokea good stroke roar the crowd the falconth falcon
peter saw that fallen shield and whether for chivalri sake as
thought the cheer multitud or to free hi left arm he cast awai
hi own and grasp the sword with both hand rush on the spaniard
from that moment helmless though he wa the issu lai in doubt no
longer betti had spoken of peter as a stubborn swordsman and a hard
hitter and both of these he now show himself to be as fresh to all
appear as when he ran the first cours he rain blow after blow
upon the hapless spaniard till the sound of hi sword smite on the
good toledo steel wa like the sound of a hammer fall continu on
the smith red iron thei were fear blow yet still the tough steel
held and still morella do what he might stagger back beneath
them till at length he came in front of the tribun in which sat their
majesti and margaret out of the corner of hi ey peter saw the
place and determin in hi stout heart that then and there he would
end the thing parri a cut which the desper spaniard made at hi
head he thrust at him so heavili that hi blade bent like a bow and
although he could not pierc the black mail almost lift morella from

for an instant there wa silenc and in it a shrill woman voic that

then there aros a tumult of shout he is dead nai he stir
kill him spare him he fought well
peter lean upon hi sword look at the fallen foe then he glanc
upward at their majesti but these sat silent make no sign onli
he saw margaret try to rise from her seat and speak to be pull back
to it again by the hand of women a deep hush fell upon the watch
thousand who wait for the end peter look at morella ala he
still live hi sword and the stout helmet had broken the weight of
that stroke mighti though it had been the man wa but wound in three
place and stun what must i do ask peter in a hollow voic to
the royal pair abov him
now the king who seem move wa about to speak but the queen bent
forward and whisper someth to him and he remain silent thei
both were silent all the intent multitud wa silent know what thi
dread silenc meant peter cast down hi sword and drew hi dagger
wherewith to cut the lash of morella gorget and give the coup
de grce
just then it wa that for the first time he heard a sound far awai upon
the other side of the arena and look thither saw the strangest
sight that ever hi ey beheld over the rail of the pavilion
opposit to him a woman climb nimbl as a cat and from it like a
cat drop to the ground full ten feet below then gather up her
dress about her knee ran swiftli toward him it wa betti betti
without a doubt betti in her gorgeou garb with pearl and braid
hair fly loos behind her he stare amaz all stare amaz and
in half a minut she wa on them and stand over the fallen morella
gasp out
let him be i bid you let him be
peter knew not what to do or sai so advanc to speak with her whereon
with a swoop like that of a swallow she pounc upon hi sword that lai
in the sand and leap back to morella shook it on high shout
you will have to fight me first peter
inde she did more strike at him so shrewdli with hi own sword
that he wa forc to spring sidewai to avoid the stroke now a great
roar of laughter went up to heaven ye even peter laugh for no
such thing as thi had ever befor been seen in spain it di awai and
again betti who had no low voic shout in her villain spanish
he shall kill me befor he kill my husband give me my husband
take him for my part answer peter whereon let fall the
sword betti fill with the strength of despair lift the senseless
spaniard in her strong white arm as though he were a child and hi
bleed head ly on her shoulder strove to carri him awai but
could not
then while all that audienc cheer frantic peter with a gestur
of despair threw down hi dagger and onc more appeal to their
majesti the king rose and held up hi hand at the same time
motion to morella squir to take him from the woman which see
their cogniz betti allow them to do
marchio of morella said the king for the first time give her
that titl your honour is clear your champion ha conquer and
thi fierc frai wa to the death what have you to sai

with peter ha got hi desert for hi deed i sai i love him and if
peter wish to kill him he must kill me first
sir peter brome said the king the judgment li in your hand we
give you the man life to grant or to take
peter thought a while then answer
i grant him hi life if he will acknowledg thi ladi to be hi true

how can he do that you fool ask betti when you have knock all

it pleas him to break thi promis made on hi behalf to save him from

scorn proclaim it herald
so the herald blew their trumpet and on of them call out the
queen decre whereat the spectat cheer again shout that it
wa good and thei bore wit to that promis
then morella still senseless wa born awai by hi squir betti in
her bloodstain robe march at hi side and hi hors have been
brought to him again peter wound though he wa mount and gallop
round the arena amidst plaudit such as that place had never heard
till lift hi sword in salut suddenli he and hi gentlemen
vanish by the gate through which he had appear
thu strang enough end that combat which thereaft wa alwai
known as the frai of the eagl and the english hawk
chapter xxv
how the margaret won out to sea
it wa night peter faint with loss of blood and stiff with bruis
had bade hi farewel to their majesti of spain who spoke mani soft
word to him call him the flower of knighthood and offer him
high place and rank if he would abid in their servic but he thank
them and said no for in spain he had suffer too much to dwell there
so thei kiss hi bride the fair margaret who clung to her wound
husband like ivi to an oak and would not be separ from him even
for a moment that husband whom live she had scarc hope to clasp
again ye thei kiss her and the queen threw about her a chain from
her own neck as a part gift and wish her joi of so gallant a lord
ala your majesti said margaret her dark ey fill with tear
how can i be joyou who must think of tomorrow
thereon isabella set her face and answer
dona margaret brome be thank for what todai ha brought you and
forget tomorrow and that which it must justli take awai go now and
god be with you both
so thei went the littl knot of english sailormen who wrap in
spanish cloak had sat togeth in the amphitheatr and groan when
the eagl struck and cheer when the falcon swoop lead or
rather carri peter under cover of the fall night to a boat not far
from thi place of bull in thi thei embark unobserv for the
multitud and even peter own squir believ that he had return
with hi wife to the palac as he had given out that he would do so
thei were row to the margaret which straightwai made as though she
were about to sail and inde drop a littl wai down stream here
she anchor again just round a bend of the river and lai there for
the night
it wa a heavi night and in it there wa no place for love or lover
tender how could there be between these two who for so long had
been torment by doubt and fear and on thi dai had endur such
extrem of terror and such agoni of joi peter wound also wa deep
and wide though hi shield had broken the weight of morella sword
and it edg had caught upon hi shoulderpiec so that by good chanc
it had not reach down to the arteri or shorn into the bone yet he
had lost much blood and smith the captain who wa a better surgeon
than might have been guess from hi thick hand found it need to
wash out the cut with spirit that gave much pain and to stitch it up
with silk also peter had great bruis on hi arm and thigh and hi
back wa hurt by that fall from the white charger with morella in
hi arm
so it came about that most of that night he lai outworn halfsleep
and halfwak and when at sunris he struggl from hi berth it wa
but to kneel by the side of margaret and join her in her prayer that
her father might be rescu from the hand of these cruel priest
of spain
now dure the night smith had brought hi ship back with the tide and
laid her under the shelter of those hulk whereof peter had spoken
have first paint out her name of margaret and in it place set
that of the santa maria a vessel of about the same build and tonnag
which as thei had heard wa expect in port for thi reason or
becaus there were at that time mani ship in the river it happen
that none in author note her return or if thei did neglect to
report the matter as on of no moment therefor so far all went well
accord to the tale of henriqu confirm by what thei had learn
otherwis the great process of the act of faith would turn on to the
quai at about eight oclock and pass along it for a hundr yard or so
onli befor it wound awai down a street lead to the plaza where
the theatr wa prepar the sermon would be preach the mass
celebr and the relax place in cage to be carri to the
quemadero
at six in the morn smith muster those twelv men whom he had chosen
to help him in the enterpris and peter with margaret at hi side
address them in the cabin tell them all the plan and prai them
for the sake of their master and of the ladi margaret hi daughter to
do what men might to save on whom thei love and honour from so
horribl a death
thei swore that thei would everi on of them for their english blood
wa up nor did thei so much as speak of the great reward that had been
promis to those who live through thi adventur and to the famili
of those who fell then thei breakfast gird their sword and knive
about them and put on their spanish cloak though to speak truth
these lad of essex and of london made but poor spaniard now at
length the boat wa readi and peter although he could scarc stand
desir to be carri into it that he might accompani them but the
captain smith to whom perhap margaret had been speak set down hi
flat foot on the deck and said that he who command there would
suffer no such thing a wound man he declar would but cumber them
who had littl room to spare in that small boat and could be of no
servic either on land or water moreov master peter face wa
known to thousand who had watch it yesterdai and would certainli be
recognis wherea none would take note at such a time of a dozen
common sailor land from some ship to see the show lastli he would
do best to stop on board the vessel where if anyth went wrong thei
must be shorthand enough who if thei could ought to get her awai
to sea and across it with all speed
still peter would have gone till margaret throw her arm about him
ask him if he thought that she would be the better if she lost both
her father and her husband as if thing miscarri well might happen
then be in pain and veri weak he yield and smith have given
hi last direct to the mate and shaken peter and margaret by the
hand ask their prayer for all of them descend with hi twelv
men into the boat and drop down under shelter of the hulk row
to the shore as though thei came from some other vessel now the quai
wa not more than a bowshot from them and from a certain spot upon the
margaret there wa a good view of it between the stern of on hulk and
the bow of anoth here then peter and margaret sat themselv down
behind the bulwark and watch with fear such as cannot be told while
a sharpei seaman climb to the crowsnest on the mast whenc he
could see over much of the citi and even the old moorish castl that
wa then the holi hous of the inquisit present thi man report
that the process had start for he saw it banner and the peopl
crowd to the window and to the rooftop also the cathedr bell
began to toll slowli then came a long long wait dure which their
littl knot of sailor wear the spanish cloak appear upon the
quai and mingl with the few folk that were gather there sinc the
most of the peopl were collect by thousand on the great plaza or
in the adjac street
at length just as the cathedr clock struck eight the triumphant
march as it wa call began to appear upon the quai first came a
bodi of soldier with lanc then a crucifix born by a priest and
veil in black crape then a number of other priest clad in
snowwhit robe to symbolis their perfect puriti next follow men
carri wood or leather imag of some man or woman who by flight to a
foreign land or into the realm of death had escap the clutch of
the inquisit after these march other men in four each four of
them bear a coffin that contain the bodi or bone of some dead
heret which in the absenc of hi live person like the effigi
were to be commit to the flame as a token of what the inquisit
would have done to him if it couldto enabl it also to seiz
hi properti
then came mani penit their head shaven their feet bare and clad
some in darkcolour cloak some in yellow robe call the
sanbenito which were adorn with a red cross these were follow by
a melancholi band of relax heret doom to the fire or
strangul at the stake and cloth in zamarra of sheepskin
paint all over with devil and the portrait of their own face
surround by flame these poor creatur wore also flameadorn cap
call coroza shape like bishop mitr and were gag with
block of wood lest thei should contamin the populac by some
declar of their heresi while in their hand thei bore taper
which the monk who accompani them relight from time to time if thei
becam extinguish
now the heart of peter and margaret leap within them for at the end
of thi hideou troop rode a man mount on an ass cloth in a
zamarra and coroza but with a noos about hi neck so the frai
henriqu had told the truth for without doubt thi wa john castel
like peopl in a dream thei saw him advanc in hi garb of shame and
after him gorgeous attir civil offic inquisitor and
familiar of nobl rank member of the council of inquisit behind
whom wa born a flaunt banner call the holi standard of
the faith
now castel wa opposit to the littl group of seamen and or so it
seem someth went wrong with the har of the ass on which he
sat for it stop and a man in the garb of a secretari step to it
appar to attend to a strap thu bring all the process
behind to a halt while that in front proceed off the quai and round
the corner of a street whatev it might be that had happen it
necessit the dismount of the heret who wa pull roughli off
the brute back which as though in joi at thi riddanc of it
burden lift it head and brai loudli
men from the thin line of crowd that edg the quai came forward as
though to help and among them were sever in cape such as were worn
by the sailor of the margaret the offic and grande behind
shout forwardforward whereon those attend to the ass hustl
it and it rider a littl nearer to the water edg while the guard
ran back to explain what had happen then suddenli a confus aros
of which it wa imposs to distinguish the caus and next instant
margaret and peter still grip each other saw the man who had been
seat on the ass be drag rapidli down the step of the quai at
the foot of which lai the boat of the margaret
the mate at the helm saw also for he blew hi whistl a sign at which
the anchor wa slippedther wa no time to lift itand men who were
wait on the yard loos the lash of certain sail so that
almost immedi the ship began to move
now thei were fight on the quai the heret wa in the boat and
most of the sailor but other held back the crowd of priest and arm
familiar who strove to get at him on a priest with a sword in hi
hand slip past them and tumbl into the boat also at last all were
in save a singl man who wa attack by three adversariesjohn smith
the captain the oar were out but hi mate wait for him he struck
with hi sword and some on fell then he turn to run two mask
familiar sprang at him on land on hi back on cling to hi
neck with a desper effort he cast himself into the water drag
them with him on thei saw no more for smith had stab him the
other float up near the boat which alreadi wa some yard from the
quai and a sailor batter him on the head with an oar so that
he sank
smith had vanish also and thei thought he must be drown the
sailor thought it too for thei began to give wai when suddenli a
great brown hand appear and clasp the sternsheet while a
bullvoic roar
row on lad im right enough
row thei did inde till the ashen oar bent like bow onli two of
them seiz the offic who had sprung into the boat and flung him
scream into the river where he struggl a while for he could not
swim grip at the air with hi hand then disappear the boat wa
in midstream now and shape her cours round the bow of the first
hulk beyond which the prow of the margaret began to appear for the
wind wa fresh and she gather wai everi moment
let down the ladder and make readi rope shout peter
it wa done but not too soon for next instant the boat wa bump on
their side the sailor in her caught the rope and hung on while the
captain smith halfdrown clung to the sternsheet for the water
wash over hi head
save him first cri peter a man run down the ladder threw a
noos to him which smith seiz with on hand and by degre work
beneath hi arm then thei tackl on to it and drag him bodili
from the river to the deck where he lai gasp and spit out foam
and water by now the ship wa travel swiftli so swiftli that
margaret wa in an agoni of fear lest the boat should be tow under
and sink
but these sailor men knew their trade by degre thei let the boat drop
back till her bow wa abreast of the ladder then thei help castel
forward he grip it rung and eager hand grip him up he
stagger step by step till at length hi hideou fiendpaint cap
hi white face whenc the beard had been shave and hi open mouth in
which still wa fix the wooden gag appear abov the bulwark as
the mate said afterward like that of a devil escap from hell thei
lift him over and he sank faint in hi daughter arm then on
by on the sailor came up after himnon were miss though two had
been wound and were cover with blood no none were missinggod
had brought them everi on safe back to the deck of the margaret
smith the captain spat up the last of hi river water and call for a
cup of wine which he drank while peter and margaret drew the accurs
gag from her father mouth and pour spirit down hi throat shake
the water from him like a great dog but sai never a word smith
roll to the helm and took it from the mate for the navig of the
river wa difficult and none knew it so well as he now thei were
abreast the famou golden tower and a big gun wa fire at them but
the shot went wide look said margaret point to horsemen
gallop southward along the river bank
ye said peter thei go to warn the port god send that the wind
hold for we must fight our wai to sea
the wind did hold inde it blew ever more strongli from the north but
oh that wa a long evil dai hour after hour thei sped forward down
the widen river now past villag where knot of peopl wave
weapon at them as thei went now by desol marsh plain and bank
cloth with pine
when thei reach bonanza the sun wa low and when thei were off san
lucar it had begun to sink out into the wide river mouth where the
white water tumbl on the narrow bar row two great gallei to cut
them off veri swift gallei which it seem imposs to escap
margaret and castel were sent below the crew went to quarter and
peter crept stiffli aft to where the sturdi smith stood at the helm
which he would suffer no other man to touch smith look at the sky he
look at the shore and the safe open sea beyond then he bade them
hoist more sail all that she could carri and look grimli at the two
gallei lurk like deerhound in a pass that hung on their oar in
the strait channel with the tumbl breaker on either side through
which no ship could sail what will you do ask peter master
peter he answer between hi teeth when you fought the spaniard
yesterdai i did not ask you what you were go to do hold your
tongu and leav me to my own trade
the margaret wa a swift ship but never yet had she move so
swiftli behind her shrill the gale for now it wa no less her stout
mast bent like fish pole her rig creak and groan beneath
the weight of the belli canva her port bulwark slip along
almost level with the water so that peter must lie down on the deck
for stand he could not and watch it run by within three feet
of him
the gallei drew up right across her path half a mile awai thei lai bow
by bow know well that no ship could pass the foam shallow lai
bow by bow wait to board and cut down thi littl english crew when
the margaret shorten sail as shorten sail she must smith yell an
order to the mate and present red in the set sun out burst the
flag of england upon the mainmast top a sight at which the sailor
cheer he shout anoth order and up ran the last jib so that now
from time to time the port bulwark dip beneath the sea and peter
felt salt water sting hi sore back
thu did the margaret shorten sail and thu did she yield her to the
great gallei of spain
the captain of the gallei hung on wa thi foreign mad or ignor
of the river channel thei wonder that he would sink with everi soul
there upon the bar thei hung on wait for that leopard flag and
those burst sail to come down but thei never stir onli straight
at them rush the margaret like a bull she wa not two furlong
awai and she held dead upon her cours till at last those gallei saw
that she would not sink alon like a bull with shut ey she held
dead upon her furiou cours
confus aros upon the spanish ship whistl were blown men
shout overs ran down the plank flog the slave lift oar
shone red in the light of the dy sun as thei beat the water wildli
the prow began to back and separ five feet ten feet a dozen feet
perhap then straight into that tini streak of open water like a stone
from the hand of the slinger like an arrow from a bow rush the
windflung margaret
what happen go ask it of the fisher of san lucar and the pirat of
bonanza where the tale ha been told for gener the great oar
snap like reed the slave were thrown in crush and mangl heap
