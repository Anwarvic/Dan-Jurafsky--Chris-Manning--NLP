them their camp were set upon the seabeach and for mile around
there wa no room at the inn or in the privat hous where guest
slept upon the roof the couch the floor and in the garden the
great town hum like a hive of bee disturb after sunset and though
the louder sound of revel had di awai parti of feaster

their freedom inde by a kindli decre the king agrippa a man who
did not seek unnecessari bloodsh contrari to custom even the wound

under these circumst sinc life is sweet all had determin to
fight their best
in anoth divis of the great hall wa collect a veri differ
compani there were not more than fifti or sixti of these so the wide
arch of the surround cloister gave them suffici shelter and
even privaci with the except of eight or ten men all of them old

roman offici who in due cours had been banish to gaul where he
wa said to have commit suicid in hi dai pilat wa unpopular
in juda for he had taken the treasur of the templ at jerusalem to
build waterwork caus a tumult in which mani were kill now he
wa almost forgotten but veri strang the fame of thi crucifi
demagogu jesu seem to grow sinc there were mani who made a kind
of god of him preach doctrin in hi name that were contrari to the
law and offens to everi sect of the jew
pharise sadduce zealot levit priest all call out against
them all besought agrippa that he would be rid of them these apost

it messiah that heavenborn king who should break the roman yoke and
make jerusalem the capit of the world that thi messiah had come
alreadi in the guis of an itiner preacher and perish with other
malefactor by the death of shame
weari with their importun the king listen like the cultiv
roman with whom he associ agrippa had no real religion at
jerusalem he embellish the templ and made offer to jehovah at
berytu he embellish the templ and made offer there to jupit
he wa all thing to all men and to himselfnoth but a voluptu
timeserv as for these christian he never troubl himself about
them why should he thei were few and insignific no singl man of
rank or wealth wa to be found among them to persecut them wa easi
andit pleas the jew therefor he persecut them on jame a
discipl of the crucifi man call christ who had wander about the
countri with him he seiz and behead at jerusalem anoth call
peter a power preacher he threw into prison and of their follow

but the pick of the men were forc to fight as gladiat at berytu
and elsewher the women if young and beauti were sold as slave
but if matron or ag thei were cast to the wild beast in the circu
such wa the fate inde that wa reserv for these poor victim in
the prison on thi veri dai of the open of our histori after the
gladiat had fought and the other game had been celebr sixti
christian it wa announc old and useless men marri woman and
young children whom nobodi would bui were to be turn down in the
great amphitheatr then thirti fierc lion with other savag beast
made raven by hunger and mad with the smell of blood were to be let

it to be seen that he wa gentleheart sinc of hi kind he had
decre that ani whom the lion refus to eat were to be given cloth
a small sum of monei and releas to settl their differ with the
jew as thei might pleas
such wa the state of public feel and moral in the roman world of
that dai that thi spectacl of the feed of starv beast with live
women and children whose crime wa that thei worship a crucifi
man and would offer sacrific to no other god either in the templ
or elsewher wa much look forward to by the popul of csarea
inde great sum of monei were ventur upon the event by mean of
what todai would be call sweepstak under the regul of which
he who drew the ticket mark with the exact number of those whom the
lion left aliv would take the first prize alreadi some farse
gambler who had drawn low number had bribe the soldier and warden
to sprinkl the hair and garment of the christian with valerian water
a decoct which wa suppos to attract and excit the appetit of
these great cat other whose ticket were high paid handsom for
the employ of artific which need not be detail calcul to
induc in the lion avers to the subject that had been treat

scarc to be surpass her law is the foundat of the best of our
code of jurisprud art she borrow but appreci her militari
system is still the wonder of the world her great men remain great
among a multitud of subsequ competitor and yet how pitiless she
wa what a tigress amid all the ruin of her citi we find none of a
hospit none i believ of an orphan school in an ag that made mani
orphan the piou aspir and effort of individu seem never

intellig and splendour
king agrippa in practic wa a roman rome wa hi model her ideal
were hi ideal therefor he built amphitheatr in which men were
butcher to the exquisit delight of vast audienc therefor also
without the excus of ani conscienti motiv howev insuffici or
unsatisfactori he persecut the weak becaus thei were weak and their
suffer would give pleasur to the strong or to those who chanc to
be the major of the moment
the season be hot it wa arrang that the great game in honour of
the safeti of csar should open each dai at dawn and come to an end an

personag and for the christian compani of old men women and children
destin to the lion who it wa arrang were to sit in full view
of the audienc until the time came for them to take their share in the
spectacl
when rachel join the other captiv she found that a long rough tabl
had been set beneath the arcad and on it at interv piec of
bread and cup and vase contain wine of the countri that had been
purchas at a great price from the guard round thi tabl the elder
or the infirm among the compani were seat on a bench while the rest
of the number for whom there wa not room stood behind them at it
head wa an old man a bishop among the christian on of the five
hundr who had seen the risen lord and receiv baptism from the
hand of the belov discipl for some year he had been spare by the
persecutor of the infant church on account of hi ag digniti and
good reput but now at last fate seem to have overtaken him
the servic wa held the bread and wine mix with water were
consecr with the same text by which thei ar bless todai onli
the prayer were extempor when all had eaten from the platter and
drunk from the rude cup the bishop gave hi bless to the commun
then he address them thi he told them wa an occas of peculiar
joi a lovefeast inde sinc all thei who partook of it were about to
lai down the burden of the flesh and their labour and sorrow end
to depart into bliss etern he call to their memori the supper of
the passov which had taken place within the lifetim of mani of
them when the author and finish of their faith had declar to the
discipl that he would drink no more wine till he drank it new with
them in hi kingdom such a feast it wa that lai spread befor them
thi night let them be thank for it let them not quail in the hour
of trial the fang of the savag beast the shout of the still more
savag spectat the agoni of the quiver flesh the last terror of
their depart what were these soon veri soon thei would be done
the spear of the soldier would despatch the injur and those among
them whom it wa ordain should escap would be set free by the
command of the repres of csar that thei might prosecut the
work till the hour came for them to pass on the torch of redempt to
other hand let them rejoic therefor and be veri thank and
walk to the sacrific as to a wed feast do you not rejoic my
brethren he ask with on voic thei answer we rejoic ye
even the children answer thu
then thei prai again and again with uplift hand the old man
bless them in the holi triun name
scarc had thi servic as solemn as it wa simpl been brought
to an end when the head jailer whose blasphem jocos sinc hi
reproof by anna wa replac by a mien of sullen venom came forward and
command the whole band to march to the amphitheatr accordingli two
by two the bishop lead the wai with the saint woman anna thei
walk to the gate here a guard of soldier wa wait to receiv
them and under their escort thei thread the narrow darkl street
till thei came to that door of the amphitheatr which wa us by those
who were to take part in the game now at a word from the bishop thei
began to chant a solemn hymn and sing thu were thrust along the
passag to the place prepar for them thi wa not as thei expect
a prison at the back of the amphitheatr but as ha been said a spot
between the enclos wall and the podium rais a littl abov the
level of the arena here on the eastern side of the build thei were
to sit till their turn came to be driven by the guard through a littl
wicketg into the arena where the starv beast of prei would be
loos upon them
it wa now the hour befor sunris and the moon have set the vast
theatr wa plung in gloom reliev onli here and there by strai
torch and cresset of fire burn upon either side of the gorgeou
but as yet unoccupi throne of agrippa thi gloom seem to oppress
the audienc with which the place wa crowd at ani rate none of them
shout or sang or even spoke loudli thei address each other
in muffl tone with the result that the air seem to be full of
mysteri whisper had thi poor band of condemn christian
enter the theatr in daylight thei would have been greet with
iron cri and taunt of dog meat and with request that
thei should work a miracl and let the peopl see them rise again from
the belli of the lion but now as their solemn song broke upon the
silenc it wa answer onli by on great murmur which seem to shape
itself to the word the christian the doom christian
by the light of a singl torch the band took their place then onc
more thei sang and in that chasten hour the audienc listen with
attent almost with respect their chant finish the bishop stood
up and move thereto by some inspir began to address the mighti
throng whom he could not see and who could not see him strang
enough thei hearken to him perhap becaus hi speech serv to while
awai the weari time of wait

lord peopl roman jew syrian greek citizen of iduma of
egypt and of all nation here gather hearken to the word of an old
man destin and glad to die listen if it be your pleasur to the
stori of on whom some of you saw crucifi under pontiu pilat sinc

let him alon answer other voic we will hear thi stori of hi

thu encourag the old man spoke on with an eloqu so simpl and yet
so touch with a wisdom so deep that for full fifteen minut none
care even to interrupt him then a farawai listen cri
why must these peopl die who ar better than we
friend answer the bishop in ring tone which in that heavi
silenc seem to search out even the recess of the great and crowd
place we must die becaus it is the will of king agrippa to whom
god ha given power to destroi us mourn not for us becaus we perish
cruelli sinc thi is the dai of our true birth but mourn for king
agrippa at whose hand our blood will be requir and mourn mourn for
yourselv o peopl the death that is near to us perchanc is nearer
still to some of you and how will you awaken who perish in your sin
what if the sword of god should empti yonder throne what if the voic
of god should call on him who fill it to make answer of hi deed
soon or late o peopl it will call on him and you to pass henc some
natur in your ag other by the sharp and dread road of sword
pestil or famin alreadi those woe which he whom you crucifi
foretold knock at your door and within a few short year not on of
you who crowd thi place in thousand will draw the breath of life

declar that judgment is at hand ye even now although you see him
not the angel of the lord hang over you and write your name within
hi book now while there is time i would prai for you and for your

as he spoke those word the angel of the lord hang over you so great
wa the preacher power and in that weari dark so sharpli had he
touch the imagin of hi strang audienc that with a sound like
to the stir of rustl tree thousand of face were turn upward
as though in search of that dread messeng
look look scream a hundr voic while dim arm point to some
noiseless thing that float high abov them against the background
of the sky which grew grei with the come dawn it appear and
disappear appear again then seem to pass downward in the
direct of agrippa throne and vanish
it is that magician angel cri on and the multitud groan
fool said anoth it wa but a bird
then for agrippa sake shrill a new voic the god send that it
wa not an owl
thereat some laugh but the most were silent thei knew the stori of
king agrippa and the owl and how it had been foretold that thi spirit
in the form of a bird would appear to him again in the hour of hi
death as it had appear to him in the hour of hi triumph
see josephu antiqu of the jew book xvii

turn down a side street and paus in the shadow of the wall to think
what she should do so far thei were safe but even if her strength
would stand the strain it seem imposs that she should carri her
mistress through the crowd citi and avoid recaptur for some month
thei had both of them been prison and as it wa the custom of the
inhabit of csarea when thei had noth els to do to come to the
gate of their jail and through the bar to studi those within or
even by permiss of the guard to walk among them their appear
wa known to mani doubtless so soon as the excit caus by the
ill of the king had subsid soldier would be sent to hunt down
the fugit who had escap from the amphitheatr more especi
would thei search for her nehushta and her mistress sinc it would be
known that on of them had stab the warden of the gate a crime for
which thei must expect to die by tortur alsowher could thei go who
had no friend sinc all christian had been expel the citi
no there wa but on chanc for themto conceal themselv
nehushta look round her for a hidingplac and in thi matter as in
other on that dai fortun favour them thi street in the old dai
when csarea wa call strato tower had been built upon an inner
wall of the citi now long dismantl at a distanc of a few yard
from where nehushta had stop stood an ancient gatewai unus save
at time by beggar who slept under it which led nowher for the outer
arch of it wa brick up into thi gatewai nehushta bore her mistress
unobserv to find to her relief that it wa quit unten though
a still smoulder fire and a broken amphora contain clean water
show her that folk had slept there who could find no better lodg
so far so good but here it would be scarc safe to hide as the
tenant or other might come back nehushta look around in the thick
wall wa a littl archwai beneath which commenc a stair set
rachel on the ground she ran up it lightli as a cat at the top of
thirti step mani of them broken she found an old and massiv door
with a sigh of disappoint the libyan turn to descend again then
by an afterthought push at the door to her surpris it stir
again she push and it swung open within wa a larg chamber light
by loophol pierc in the thick of the wall for the us of
archer now howev it serv no militari purpos but wa us as a
storehous by a merchant of grain for there in a corner lai a heap of
mani measur of barlei and strewn about the floor were sack of skin
and other articl
nehushta examin the room no hidingplac could be betterunless the
merchant chanc to come to visit hi store well that must be risk
down she sped and with much toil and difficulti carri her still
swoon mistress up the step and into the chamber where she laid her
on a heap of sack
again by an afterthought she ventur to descend thi time to fetch
the broken jar of water then she close the door set it fast with
a piec of wood and began to chafe rachel hand and to sprinkl her
face from the jar present the dark ey open and her mistress sat
up
is it over and is thi paradis she murmur
i should not call the place by that name ladi answer nehushta
drili though perhap in contrast with the hell that we have left
some might think it so drink and she held the water to her lip
rachel obei her eagerli oh it is good she said but how came we
here out of that rush crowd
befor she answer mutter after the mistress the maid nehushta
swallow a deep draught of water in her turn which inde she need
sore then she told her all
oh nou said rachel how strong and brave you ar but for you i
should be dead
but for god you mean mistress for i hold that he sent that
knifepoint home
did you kill the man ask rachel
i think that he di by a daggerthrust as anna foretold she answer
evas and that remind me that i had better clean the knife sinc
blood on the blade is evid against it owner then draw the
dagger from it hidingplac she rub it with dust which she took
from a loophol and polish it bright with a piec of hide
scarc wa thi task accomplish to nehushta satisfact when her
quick ear caught a sound
for your life be silent she whisper and laid her face sidewai
to a crack in the cement floor and listen well might she listen for
below were three soldier search for her and her mistress
the old fellow swore that he saw a libyan woman carri a ladi down
thi street said on of them the petti offic in charg to hi
companion and there wa but a singl brownskin in the lot so if thei
arent here i dont know where thei can be
well grumbl on of the soldier thi place is as empti as a drum
so we mai as well be go therel be fun present which i dont want
to miss
it wa the black woman who knife our friend rufu wasnt itin the
theatr there ask the third soldier
thei sai so but as he wa trodden as flat as a roofboard and thei
had to take him up in piec it is difficult to know the truth of that
matter anyhow hi mate ar anxiou to get the ladi and i should be
sorri to die as she will when thei do or her mistress either thei
have leav to finish them in their own fashion
hadnt we best be go said the first soldier who evid wa
anxiou to keep some appoint
hullo exclaim the second a sharpei fellow there a stair we
had better just look up it
not much us answer the offic that old thief amram the
cornmerch ha a store there and he isnt on of the sort to leav
it unlock still just go and see
then came the sound of footstep on the stair and present a man could
be heard fumbl at the further side of the door rachel shut her ey
and prai nehushta draw the knife from her bosom crept toward
the doorwai like a tigress and place her left hand on the stick that
held it shut well it wa that she did so sinc present the soldier
gave a savag push that might easili have caus the wood to slip on the
cement floor now satisfi that it wa realli lock he turn and
went down the step
with a gasp of relief nehushta onc more set her ear to the crack
it fast enough report the man but perhap it might be as well
to get the kei from amram and have a look
friend said the offic i think that you must be in love with thi
black ladi or is it her mistress whom you admir i shall recommend
you for the post of christiancatch to the cohort now well try that
hous at the corner and if thei ar not there i am off to the palac
to see how hi godship is get on with that stomachach and whether
it ha move him to order payment of our arrear if he hasnt i tell
you flatli that i mean to help myself to someth and so do the rest
of the lad who ar mad at the stop of the game
it would be much better to get that kei from amram and have a look
upstair put in number two soldier reflect
then go to amram or to pluto and ask for the kei of hade for aught
i care repli hi superior with irrit he live about a leagu
off at the other end of the town
i do not wish for the walk said the conscienti soldier but as we
ar search for these escap christian by your leav i do think it
would have been much better to have got that kei from amram and peep
into the chamber upstair
thereon the temper of the offic alreadi ruffl by the event of
the morn and the long watch of the preced night gave wai and he
depart consign the christian escap or recaptur amram and
the kei hi subordin and even the royal agrippa who did not pai
hi debt to everi infern god of everi religion with which he wa
acquaint
nehushta lift her head from the floor
thank be to god thei ar gone she said
but nou will thei not come back oh i fear lest thei should come
back
i think not that sharpnos rat ha made the other angri and i
believ that he will find him some harder task than the seek of a kei
from amram still there is danger that thi amram mai appear himself to
visit hi store for in these dai of festiv he is sure to be sell
grain to the baker
scarc were the word out of her mouth when a kei rattl the door
wa push sharpli and the piec of wood slip and fell then the
hing creak and amramnon otherent and close the door
behind him lock it leav the kei in the lock

thu thei part
present the night breez began to flow off the land the great sail
wa hoist and with the help of oar work by slave the ship
clear the harbour and set her cours for joppa two hour later the
wind fail so that thei could proce onli by row over a dead and
oili sea beneath a sky that wa full of heavi cloud lack ani star
to steer by the captain wish to cast anchor but as the water prove
too deep thei proceed slowli till about an hour befor dawn a sudden
gust struck them which caus the gallei to lean over
the north wind the black north wind shout the steersman and the
sailor echo hi cry dismal for thei knew the terror of that wind
upon the syrian coast then the gale began to rage by daylight the
wave were run high as mountain and the wind hiss through the
rig drive them forward beneath a small sail nehushta crawl out
of the cabin and in the light of an angri dawn saw far awai the white
wall of a citi built near the shore
is not that appolonia she ask of the captain
ye he answer it is appolonia sure enough but we shall not
anchor there thi voyag now it is alexandria for us or noth
so thei rush past appolonia and forward climb the slope of the
rise sea
thu thing went on about middai the gale becam a hurrican and do
what thei would thei were driven forward till at length thei saw
the breaker form on the coast rachel lai sick and prostrat but
nehushta went out of the cabin to watch
ar we in danger she ask of a sailor
ye accurs christian he repli and you have brought it on us
with your evil ey
then nehushta return to the cabin where her mistress lai almost
senseless with seasick on board the ship the terror and confus
grew for a while thei were abl to beat out to sea until the mast
wa carri awai then the rudder broke and as the oar could not be
work in that fear tempest the gallei began to drive shoreward
night fell and who can describ the aw hour that follow all
control of the vessel be lost she drove onward whither the wind and
the wave took her the crew and even the oarslav flew to the wine
with which she wa partli laden and strove to drown their terror in
drink thu inflam twice some of them came to the cabin threaten
to throw their passeng overboard but nehushta bar the door and
call through it that she wa well arm and would kill the first
man who tri to lai a hand upon her so thei went awai and after the
second visit grew too drunken to be danger
again the dawn broke over the roar foam sea and reveal the
fate that await them not a mile awai lai the grei line of shore and
between them and it a cruel reef on which the breaker rage toward
thi reef thei were drive fast now the men grew sober in their fear
and began to build a larg raft of oar and timber also to make readi
the boat which the gallei carri befor all wa done she struck beak
first and wa lift on to a great flat rock where she wallow with
the water seeth round her then know that their hour wa come
the crew made shift to launch the boat and raft on the lee side and
began to clamber into them now nehushta came out of the cabin and
prai the captain to save them also whereon he answer her with an
oath that thi bad luck wa becaus of them and that if either she or
her mistress tri to enter the boat thei would stab them and cast them
into the sea as an offer to the stormgod
so nehushta struggl back to the cabin and kneel by the side of her
mistress with tear told her that these blackheart sailor had
left them alon upon the ship to drown rachel answer that she care
littl but onli desir to be free of her fear and miseri
as the word left her lip nehushta heard a sound of scream and
crawl to the bulwark look forth to see a dread sight the boat
and the raft laden with a great number of men who were fight for
place with each other have loos from the lee of the ship were
come among the breaker which threw them up as a child throw a ball at
plai even while nehushta gaze their craft were overturn cast
them into the water everi on there to be dash against the rock
or drown by the violenc of the wave so that not a man of all that
ship compani came live to the shore
like ten of thousand of other on thi coast in all ag thei
perish everi on of themand that wa the reward of their
wicked
give thank to god who had brought them out of that danger against
their will nehushta crept back to the cabin and told her mistress what
had pass
mai thei find pardon said rachel shudder but as for us it will
matter littl whether we ar drown in the boat or upon the gallei
i do not think that we shall drown answer nehushta
how ar we to escap it nou the ship li upon the rock where the
great wave will batter her to piec feel how she shake beneath their
blow and see the sprai fly over us
i do not know mistress but we shall not drown
nehushta wa right for after thei had remain fast a littl longer
thei were save thu suddenli the wind drop then it rose again in
a last furiou squall drive befor it a veri mountain of water thi
vast billow as it rush shoreward caught the gallei in it white
arm and lift her not onli off the rock whereon she lai but over the
further reef to cast her down again upon a bed of sand and shell
within a stone throw of the beach where she remain fast never to
shift more
now also as though it work were done the gale ceas and as is
common on the syrian coast the sea sank rapidli so that by nightfal
it wa calm again inde three hour befor sunset had both of them
been strong and well thei might have escap to the land by wade but
thi wa not to be for now what nehushta had fear befel and when
she wa least fit to bear it be worn out with anguish of mind and
weari of bodi pain took sudden hold of rachel of which the end wa
that befor midnight there in that broken vessel upon a barren coast
where no man seem to live a daughter wa born to her
let me see the child said rachel so nehushta show it to her by the
light of a lamp which burn in the cabin
it wa a small child but veri white with blue ey and dark hair that
curl rachel gaze at it long and tenderli then she said bring me
water while there is yet time
when the water wa brought she dip her trembl hand into it and
made the sign of the cross upon the babe forehead baptis her with
the name of miriam after that of her own mother to the servic and the
compani of jesu the christ
now she said whether she live an hour or an hundr year thi
child is a christian and whatev befal should she come to the ag
of understand see to it nou who ar henceforth the fostermoth
of her bodi and her soul that she doe not forget the rite and duti
of her faith lai thi charg on her also as her father command and

not a christian tell her that such wa the will of those who begat her
and that if she be obedi to it although thei ar dead and as it
seem strengthless yet shall their bless be upon her all her life
dai and with it the bless of the lord she serv
oh moan nehushta why do you speak thu

for which servic you have the mean to pai then when she is strong
enough and it is conveni travel not to tyrefor there my father
would bring up the child in the strictest rite and custom of the
jewsbut to the villag of the essen upon the shore of the dead sea

thu spoke rachel but in short and broken word then she began to
prai and prai fell asleep when she woke again the dawn wa
break sign to nehushta to bring her the child for now she could
no longer speak she scan it earnestli in the newborn light then
place her hand upon it head and bless it nehushta she bless also
thank her with her ey and kiss her then again she seem to
fall asleep and present when nehushta look at her rachel wa
dead
nehushta understood and gave a great and bitter cry sinc to her after
the death of her first mistress thi woman had been all her life as a
child she had nurs her as a maiden share her joi and sorrow as a
wife and widow toil dai and night fierc and faithfulli to consol
her in her desol and to protect her in the dread danger through
which she had pass now to end it all it wa her lot to receiv her
last breath and to take into her arm her newborn infant
then and there nehushta swore that as she had done by the mother she so
would do by the child till the dai when her labour end were it not
for thi child inde thei would have end now christian though she
wa sinc she wa crush with bitter sorrow and her heart seem void
of hope or joi all her dai had been hardsh who wa born to great
place among her own wild peopl far awai and snatch thenc to be a
slave set apart by her race and blood from those into whose citi she
wa sold she who would have naught to do with base men nor becom the
playth of those of higher birth she who had turn christian and
drunk deep of the tribul of the faith she who had centr all her
eager heart upon two belov women and lost them both all her dai had
been hard and here and now by the side of her dead mistress she would
have end them but the child remain and while it live she would
live if it di then perhap she would die also
meanwhil nehushta had no time for grief sinc the babe must be fed
and within twelv hour yet as she could not buri her and would not
throw her to the shark she wa mind to give her mistress a royal
funer after the custom of her own libyan folk here wa flame and
what pyre could be grander than thi great ship
lift the bodi from it couch nehushta carri it to the deck and
laid it by the broken mast close the ey and fold the hand
then she loosen from about the neck those token of which rachel had
spoken made some food and garment into a bundl and carri the
lamp with her went into the captain cabin amidship here a moneybox
wa open and in it gold and some jewel which thi man had abandon
in hi hast these she took ad them to her own store and secur
them about her thi done she fire the cabin and pass to the hold
broke a jar of oil and fire that also then she fled back again knelt
by her dead mistress and kiss her took the child wrap it warmli
in a shawl and by the ladder of rope which the sailor had us let
herself down into the quiet sea it water did not reach higher than
her middl and soon she wa stand on the shore and climb the
sandhil that lai beyond at their summit she turn to look and lo
yonder where the gallei wa alreadi a great pillar of fire shot up to
heaven for there wa much oil in the hold and it burnt furious
farewel she cri farewel
then weep bitterli nehushta walk on inland
chapter v

present nehushta found herself out of sight of the sea and among
cultiv land for here were vine and fig tree grown in garden
fenc with stone wall also patch of ripen barlei and of wheat

destroi by fire into thi villag she walk boldli and there the
first sight that met her ey wa that of sundri dead bodi upon which

so nehushta gave it to her and thu miriam wa nurtur at the breast
of on whose offspr had been murder becaus the head of the villag
had quarrel with a roman taxcollector such wa the world in the
dai when christ came to save it
after she had suckl the child the woman led nehushta to her hous a
humbl dwell that had escap the fire where thei found the husband

town to him she told as much of her stori as she thought well and
proffer him a gold piec which so she swore wa on of ten she had

and vine and thei start in the late autumn when the air wa cool
and pleasant
of their journei noth need be said save that thei accomplish it
without troubl be too humbl in appear to attract the notic of
the thiev who swarm upon the highwai or of the soldier who were
set to catch the thiev

descend into the vallei of the jordan through the desol hill by
which it is border camp that night outsid the town at daybreak
on the seventh morn thei start and by two hour after noon came to
the villag of the essen on it outskirt thei halt while nehushta
and the nurs bear with them the child that by now could wave it
arm and crow advanc boldli into the villag where it would appear
men dwelt onlyat least no women were to be seenand ask to be led
to the brother ithiel
the man to whom thei spoke who wa robe in white and engag in
cook outsid a larg build avert hi ey in answer as
though it were not law for him to look upon the face of a woman
he said veri civilli howev that brother ithiel wa work in the
field whenc he would not return till supper time
nehushta ask where these field were sinc she desir to speak with
him at onc the man answer that if thei walk toward the green
tree that line the bank of jordan which he point out to them thei
could not fail to find ithiel as he wa plough in the irrig land
with two white oxen the onli on thei had accordingli thei set out
again have the dead sea on their right and travel for the half of
a leagu through the thornscrub that grow in thi desert pass the
scrub thei came to land which were well cultiv and suppli with
water from the jordan by mean of wheel and long pole with a jar at
on end and a weight at the other which a man could work empti the
content of the jar again and again into an irrig ditch
in on of these field thei saw the two white oxen at their toil
and behind them the labour a tall man of about fifti year of ag
beard and have a calm face and ey that were veri deep and quiet
he wa clad in a rough robe of camel hair fasten about hi middl
with a leathern girdl and wore sandal on hi feet to him thei went
ask leav to speak with him whereon he halt the oxen and greet
them courteous but like the man in the villag turn hi ey awai
from the face of the women nehushta bade the nurs stand back out of
hear and bear the child in her arm said
sir tell me i prai you if i speak to ithiel a priest of high rank
among thi peopl of the essen and brother to the dead ladi miriam
wife of benoni the jew a merchant of tyre
at the mention of these name ithiel face sadden then grew calm
again
i am so call he answer and the ladi miriam is my sister who
now dwell in the happi and etern countri beyond the ocean with all
the blessedfor so the essen imagin that heaven to which thei went
when the soul wa freed from the vile bodi
the ladi miriam continu nehushta had a daughter rachel whose
servant i wa
wa he interrupt startl from hi calm ha she then been put to
death by those fierc men and their king as wa as her husband dema
nai sir but she di in childbirth and thi is the babe she bore
and she held the sleep littl on toward him at whom he gaze
earnestli ye and bent down and kiss itsinc although thei saw so
few of them the essen love children
tell me that sad stori he said
sir i will both tell it and prove it to be true and nehushta told
him all from the begin to the end produc to hi sight the token
which she had taken from the breast of her mistress and repeat her
last messag to him word for word when she had finish ithiel turn
awai and mourn a while then speak aloud he put up a prayer to
god for guidancefor without prayer these peopl would not enter upon
anyth howev simpleand came back to nehushta who stood by the
oxen
good and faith woman he said who it would seem ar not fickl
and lightheart or wors like the multitud of your sexperch
becaus your dark skin shield you from their temptationsy have set
me in a cleft stick and there i am held fast know that the rule of my
order is that we should have naught to do with femal young or old
therefor how can i receiv you or the child
of the rule of your order sir i know noth answer nehushta
sharpli sinc the word about the colour of her skin had not pleas
her but of the rule of natur i do know and someth of the rule
of god also for like my mistress and thi infant i am a christian
these tell me all of them that to cast out an orphan child who is of
your own blood and whom a cruel fortun ha thu brought to your door
would be an evil act and on for which you must answer to him who is
abov the rule of ani order
i mai not wrangl especi with a woman repli ithiel who seem
ill at eas but if my first word ar true thi is true also that
those same rule enjoin upon us hospit and abov all that we must
not turn awai the helpless or the destitut
clearli then sir least of ani must you turn awai thi child whose
blood is your blood and those dead mother sent her to you that she
might not fall into the power of a grandfath who ha dealt so cruelli
with those he should have cherish to be brought up among zealot as
a jew and taught to make offer of live thing and be anoint with
the oil and blood of sacrific
no no the thought is horribl answer ithiel hold up hi
hand it is better far better that she should be a christian than on
of that fanat and bloodspil faith thi he said becaus among
the essen the us of oil wa held to be unclean also abov all
thing thei loath the offer of life in sacrific to god who
although thei did not acknowledg christperhap becaus he wa never
preach to them who would listen to no new religionpractis the
most of hi doctrin with the greatest strict
the matter is too hard for me he went on i must lai it befor a
full court of the hundr curat and what thei decid that will
be done still thi is our rule to assist those who need and to show
merci to accord succour to such as deserv it and to give food to
those in distress therefor whatev the court which it will take
three dai to summon mai decid in the meanwhil i have the right to
give you and those with you shelter and provis in the guesthous
as it chanc it is situat in that part of the villag where dwell
the lowest of our brethren who ar permit to marri so there you
will find compani of your own sex
i shall be glad of it answer nehushta drili also i should call
them the highest of the brethren sinc marriag is a law of god which
god the father ha institut and god the son ha bless
i mai not wrangl i mai not wrangl repli ithiel declin the
encount but certainli that is a love babe look it ey ar
open and thei ar beauti as flower and again he bent down and
kiss the child then ad with a groan of remors ala sinner that
i am i am defil i must purifi myself and do penanc
why ask nehushta shortli
for two reason i have touch your dress and i have given wai to
earthli passion and embrac a childtwic therefor accord to our
rule i am defil
then nehushta could bear it no more
defil you puppet of a foolish rule it is the sweet babe that is
defil look you have foul it garment with your grimi hand and
made it weep by prick it with your beard would that your holi rule
taught you how to handl children and to respect honest women who ar
their mother without whom there would be no essen
i mai not wrangl said ithiel nervous for now woman wa appear
befor him in a new light not as an art and a fickl but as an
angri creatur reckless of tongu and not easi to be answer these
matter ar for the decis of the curat have i not told you so
come let us be go i will drive the oxen although it is not time
to loos them from the plough and do you and your companion walk at a
distanc behind me no not behindin front that i mai see that you do
not drop the babe or suffer it to come to ani harm truli it is sweet
to look at and mai god forgiv me i do not like to lose sight of it
face which it seem to me resembl that of my sister when she wa
also in arm
drop the babe began nehushta then understand that thi victim of
a rule alreadi love it dearli and would suffer much befor he part
with it piti hi weak she said onli be care that you do
not frighten it with your great oxen for you men who scorn women have
much to learn
then accompani by the nurs she stalk ahead in silenc while
ithiel follow after at a distanc lead the cattl by the hide
loop about their horn lest in their curios or eager to get
home thei should do some mischief to the infant or wake it from it
slumber in thi wai thei proceed to the lower part of the villag
till thei came to a good houseempti as it chancedwher guest were
accommod in the best fashion that thi kind and home folk could
afford here a woman wa summon the wife of on of the lower order of
the essen to whom ithiel spoke hold hi hand befor hi ey
as though she were not good to look at to her from a distanc he
explain the case bid her to provid all thing need and
to send a man to bring in the husband of the nurs with the beast of
burden and attend to hi want and their then warn nehushta to be
veri care of the infant and not to expos it to the sun he depart
to report the matter to the curat and to summon the great court
ar all of them like thi ask nehushta of the woman
contemptu
ye sister she answer fool everi on why of my own husband
i see littl and although be marri he rank but low among them
the man is forev tell me of the fault of our sex and how thei ar
a snare set for the feet of the righteou and given to the lead
of these same righteou astrai especi if thei be not their own
husband at time i am tempt inde to prove hi word true oh it
would not be difficult for all their high talk i have learn as much
as that for natur is apt to make a mock of those who deni natur and
there is no parchment rule that a woman cannot bring to noth yet
sinc thei mean well laugh at them and let them be sai i and now come
into the hous which is good although did women manag it it would be
better
so nehushta went into that hous with the nurs and her husband and
there for sever dai dwelt in great comfort inde there wa noth
that she or the child or those with them could want which wa not
provid in plenti messag reach her even through the woman to ask
if she would wish the room alter in ani wai and when she said that
there wa not light enough in that in which the child slept some of
the elder of the essen arriv and pierc a new window in the
wall work veri hard to finish the task befor sunset also even the
husband of the nurs wa not allow to attend to hi own beast which
were groom and fed for him till at length he grew so weari of do
noth that on the third dai he went out to plough with the essen
and work in the field till dark
it wa on the fourth morn that the full court gather in the great
meetinghous and nehushta wa summon to appear befor it bring
the babe with her thither she went accordingli to find the place
fill with a hundr grave and reverend men all clad in robe of the
purest white in the lower part of that larg chamber she sat alon upon
a chair while befor her upon bench rang on abov the other so
that all could see were gather the hundr curat
it seem that ithiel had alreadi set out the case sinc the presid
at onc began to question her on variou point of her stori all of
which she wa abl to explain to the satisfact of the court then
thei debat the matter among themselv some of them argu that
as the child wa a femal as well as it nurs neither of them could
properli be admit to the care of the commun especi as both
were of the christian faith and it wa stipul that in thi faith
thei should remain other answer that hospit wa their first
duti and that he would be weak inde who wa led asid from their rule
by a libyan woman of middl ag and an infant of a few month further
that the christian were a good peopl and that there wa much in
their doctrin which talli with their own next on made a strang
objectionnam that if thei adopt thi child thei would learn
to love it too much who should love god and their order onli to thi
anoth answer nai thei should love all mankind and especi the
helpless
mankind not womankind wa the repli for thi infant will grow into
a woman
now thei desir nehushta to retir that thei might take the vote
befor she went howev hold up the child that all could see it as
it lai smile in her arm she implor them not to reject the prayer
of a dead woman and so depriv thi infant of the care of the rel
whom that depart ladi had appoint to be it guardian and of the
guidanc and direct wisdom of their holi order lastli she remind
them that if thei thrust her out she must carri the infant to it
grandfath who if he receiv it at all would certainli bring it up
in the jewish faith and therebi perhap caus it to lose it soul
the weight of which sin would be upon their head
after thi nehushta wa led awai to anoth chamber and remain there
a long while till at length she wa brought back again by on of the
curat on enter the great hall her ey sought the face of ithiel
who had not been allow to speak sinc the matter have to do with a
greatniec of hi own it wa held that hi judgment might be warp
see that he smile and evid wa well pleas she knew her
caus wa won
woman said the presid by a great major of thi court we
have come to an irrevoc decis upon the matter that ha been laid
befor it by our brother ithiel it is for reason which i need not
explain that on thi point our rule mai be stretch so far as to admit
the child miriam to our care even though it be of the femal sex which
care is to endur until she come to a full ag of eighteen year when
she must depart from among us dure thi time no attempt will be made
to turn her from her parent faith in which she ha been baptis a
hous will be given you to live in and you will be suppli with the
best we have for the us of our ward miriam and yourself twice a week
a deput of the curat will visit the hous and stai there for
an hour to see that the health of the infant is good and that you ar
do your duti by it in which if you fail you will be remov it is
prai that you will not talk to these curat on matter which do not
concern the child when she grow old enough the maid miriam will be
admit to our gather and instruct also by the most learn
amongst us in all proper matter of letter and philosophi on which
occas you will sit at a distanc and not interfer unless your care
is requir
now that everi on mai know our decis we will escort you back to
your hous and to show that we have taken the infant under our care
our brother ithiel will carri it while you walk behind and give him such
instruct in thi matter as mai be need
accordingli a great process wa form head by the presid and
end by the priest in the centr of the line march ithiel bear
the babe miriam to hi evid delight and nehushta who instruct
him so vigor that at length he grew confus and nearli let it
fall thereon set thi detail of the judgment at defianc nehushta
snatch it from hi arm call him a clumsi and ignor clown onli
fit to handl an ox to thi ithiel made no answer nor wa he at
all wroth but finish the journei walk behind her and smile
foolishli
thu wa the child miriam who afterward came to be call the queen of
the essen royal escort to her home but littl did these good men
know that it wa not a hous which thei were give her but a throne
built of the pure gold of their own gentl heart
chapter vi
caleb
it mai be wonder whether ani girl who wa ever born into the world
could boast a stranger or a happier upbring than miriam she wa it
is true motherless but by wai of compens fate endow her with
sever hundr father each of whom love her as the appl of hi
ey she did not call them father inde a term which under the
circumst thei thought incorrect to her on and all thei went
by the design of uncl with their name ad if she happen to
know it if not as uncl simpli it cannot be said howev that miriam
brought peac to the commun of the essen inde befor she had
done with them she rent it with deep and abid jealousi to the
intens but secret delight of nehushta who although she becam a
person of great import among them as the on who had immedi
charg of their jewel could never forgiv them certain of their
doctrin or their habit of persist interfer
the domiciliari visit which took place twice a week and by special
subsequ resolut pass in full court on the sabbath also
were to begin with the subject of much covert bitter at first a
stand committe wa appoint to make these visit of whom ithiel
wa on befor two year had gone by howev much murmur aros
in the commun upon thi matter it wa point out in languag that
becam vehementfor an essenethat so much power should not be left in
the hand of on fix set of individu who might becom careless or
prejud or worst of all neglect of the welfar of the child who
wa the guest not of them onli but of the whole order it wa demand
therefor that thi committe should chang automat everi month
so that all might serv upon it in turn ithiel as the bloodrel
of miriam remain it onli perman member thi propos wa
oppos by the committe but as no on els would vote for them the
desir alter wa made further to be remov temporarili or
for good from it roster wa thenceforth recognis as on of the
punish of the order
inde the absurd to which it exist gave rise especi as
the girl grew in year sweet and beauti cannot be number thu
everi visit member must wash hi whole person and cloth himself in
clean garment befor he wa allow to approach the child lest he
should convei to her ani sick or impur substanc or odour
then there wa much troubl becaus some member were discov to
be ingrati themselv with miriam by secretli present her with
gift of playth some of them of great beauti which thei fashion
from wood shell or even hard stone moreov thei purvei articl
of food such as thei found the child love and thi it wa that led
to their detect for have eaten of them she wa ill thereupon
nehushta enrag disclos the whole plot us the most violent
languag and amidst murmur of shame on them design the
offend by name thei were remov from their offic and it wa
decre that henceforth ani gift made to the child must be offer to
her by the committe as a whole and not by a singl individu and
hand over in their name by ithiel her uncl
onc when she wa seven year old and the idol of everi brother among
the essen miriam fell ill with a kind of fever which often strike
children in the neighbourhood of jericho and the dead sea among the
brethren were sever skil and famou physician who attend her
night and dai but still the fever could not be abat and at last
with tear thei announc that thei fear for the child life then
inde there wa lament among the essen for three dai and three
night did thei wrestl in constant prayer to god that she might be
spare mani of them touch noth but water dure all that time
moreov thei sat about at a distanc from her hous prai and
seek tide if it wa bad thei beat their breast if good thei
gave thank never wa the sickb of a monarch watch with more
care or devot than that of thi littl orphan and never wa
a recoveryfor at length she did recoverreceiv with greater
thank and joi
thi wa the truth these pure and simpl men in obedi to the
strict rule thei had adopt were cut off from all the affect of
life yet the foundationston of their doctrin be love thei
who were human must love someth so thei love thi child whom thei
look upon as their ward and who as there wa none other of her ag
and sex in their commun had no rival in their heart she wa the
on joi of their labori and ascet hour she repres all the
sweet and youth of thi selfrenew world which to them wa so
grei and sapless moreov she wa a love maid who wherev she had
been place would have bound all to her
the year went by and the time came when in obedi to the first
decre miriam must be educ long were the discuss which ensu
among the curat of the essen at length three of the most learn
of their bodi were appoint to thi task and the teach began as
it chanc miriam prove an apt pupil for her memori wa good and
she had a great desir to learn mani thing more especi histori and
languag and all that ha to do with natur on of her tutor wa an
egyptian who brought up in the priest colleg at thebe when on
a journei to juda had fallen sick near jericho been nurs by the
essen and convert to their doctrin from him miriam learnt much
of their ancient civilis and even of the inner mysteri of the
egyptian religion and of it high and secret interpret which were
known onli to the priest the second theophilu by name wa a greek
who had visit rome and he taught her the tongu and literatur of
those countri the third all hi life long had studi beast and
bird and insect and the work of natur and the star and their
movement in which thing he instruct her dai by dai take her
abroad with him that exampl of each of them might be befor her ey
lastli when she grew older there wa a fourth master who wa an
artist he taught miriam how to model anim and even men in the clai
of the jordan and how to carv them out in marbl and someth of the
us of pigment also thi man who wa veri clever had a knowledg
of sing and instrument music which he impart to her in her odd
hour thu it came about that miriam grew learn and well acquaint
with mani matter of which most girl of her dai and year had never
even heard nor did she lack knowledg of the thing of her own faith
though in these the essen did not instruct her further than it
doctrin talli with their own of the rest nehushta told her
someth moreov on sever occas christian travel or
preacher visit thi countri to address the essen or the other jew
who dwelt there when thei learn her case these show themselv
veri eager to inform her of the christian doctrin among them wa on
old man who had heard the preach of jesu christ and been present
at hi crucifixion to all of which histori the girl listen with
eager rememb them to the last hour of her life
further and perhap thi wa the best part of her educ she live
in the daili compani of natur but a mile or two awai spread the dead
sea and along it melancholi and lifeless shore fring with the
white trunk of tree that had been brought down by jordan she would
often walk befor her dai by dai loom the mountain of moab while
behind her were the fantast and mysteri sandhil of the desert
back again by other mountain and that grei torment countri which
stretch between jericho and jerusalem quit near at hand also ran the
broad and muddi jordan whose fertil bank were cloth in spring
with the most delici greeneri and haunt by kingfish crane
wildfowl and mani other bird about these bank too stretch into
the desert land beyond the flower of the field grew by myriad at
differ period of the year carpet the whole earth with variou
colour brilliant as ar those of the rainbow these it wa her delight
to gather and even to cultiv in the garden of her hous
thu wisdom earthli and divin wa gather in miriam heart till
veri soon it light began to shine through her ey and face make
them ever more tender and beauti nor did she lack charm and grace of
person from the first in statur she wa small and delic pale also
in complexion but her dark hair wa plenteou and curl and her ey
were larg and of a deep and tender blue her hand and feet were veri
slender and her everi gestur quick and agil as that of a bird thu
she grew up love all thing and belov by all for even the flower
which she tend and the creatur that she fed seem in her to find a
friend
now of so much learn and all thi system of solemn order hour
nehushta did not approv for a while she bore with it but when miriam
wa about eleven year of ag she spoke her mind to the committe and
through them to the govern court of curat
wa it right that a child should be brought up thu she ask and
turn into a grave old woman whilst quit heedless of such thing
other of her ag were occupi with youth game the end of it might
be that her brain would break and she would die or becom crazi and
then what good would so much wisdom do her it wa necessari that
she should have more leisur and other children with whom she could
associ
whitebeard hermit she ad with point were not suitabl as
sole companion to a littl maid
thereon follow much debat and consult with the doctor who
agre that friend of her own year should be found for the child
thi howev prove difficult sinc among these essen were no other
girl therefor those friend must be of the male sex here too were
difficulti as at that time of the lad adopt by thi particular
commun which thei were destin to join in after dai there wa but
on of equal birth with miriam now so far as concern their own
order the essen thought littl of social distinct or even of the
differ of blood and race but miriam wa not of their order she
wa their guest no more to whom thei stood in the place of parent
and who would go from them out into the great world therefor
notwithstand their childlik simplic be mani of them men
experienc in life thei did not think it right that she should mix
with those of lower breed
thi on lad caleb by name wa born in the same year as miriam when
cuspiu fadu becam governor on the death of agrippa hi father wa
jew of veri high rank name hilliel who although he side from time
to time with the roman parti wa kill by them or perish among the
twenti thousand who were trampl to death at the feast of the passov
at jerusalem when cumanu the procur order hi soldier to
attack the peopl thereon the zealot who consid him a traitor
manag to get possess of all hi properti so that hi son caleb
whose mother wa dead wa brought in a destitut condit by on
of her friend to jericho there as she could not dispos of him
otherwis he wa given over to the essen to be educ in their
doctrin and should he wish it to enter their order when he reach
full ag thi lad it wa now decre should becom the playmat of
miriam a decis that pleas both of them veri well
caleb wa a handsom child with quick dark ey that watch everyth
without seem to watch and black hair which curl upon hi
shoulder he wa clever also and brave but though he did hi best to
control hi temper by natur veri passion and unforgiv moreov
that which he desir he would have if by ani mean it could be
obtain and wa faith in hi love as in hi hate of these hate
nehushta wa on with all the skill of a libyan whose onli book is
that of natur and men face she read the boi heart at onc and
said openli that he might come to be the first in ani causeif he did
not betrai itand that when god mix hi blood of the best lest csar
should find a rival he left out the salt of honesti and fill up the
cup with the wine of passion when these sai were repeat to caleb
by miriam who thought them to be a jest fit to teas her playmat
with he did not fly into on of hi temper as she had hope but onli
screw up hi eyelid after hi fashion in certain mood and look
black as the rainstorm abov mount nebo
did you hear caleb ask miriam somewhat disappoint
oh ye ladi miriam for so he had been order to call her i
heard do you tell that old black woman that i will lead more caus
than she ever thought of for i mean to be the first everywher also
that whatev god left out of my cup at least he mix it with a good
memori
when nehushta heard thi she laugh and said that it wa true enough
onli he that tri to climb sever ladder at onc gener fell to
the ground and that when a head had said goodby to it shoulder the
best of memori got lost between the two
miriam like caleb but she never love him as she did the old men her
uncl or nehushta who to her wa more than all perhap thi mai have
been becaus he never grew angri with her whatev she might sai or do
never even spoke to her roughli but alwai wait on her pleasur
and watch for her wish still of all companion he wa the best if
miriam desir to walk by the dead sea he would desir the same if
she want to go fish in the jordan he would make readi the bait or
net and take the fish off the hooka thing she hate if she sought
a rare flower caleb would hunt it out for dai although she knew well
that in himself he did not care for flower and when he had found it
would mark the spot and lead her there in triumph also there wa thi
about him as she wa soon quick enough to learn he worship her
whatev els might be fals that note in hi natur rang true if on
child could love anoth then caleb love miriam first with the love
of children then as a man love a woman onlyand thi wa the sorrow
of itmiriam never love caleb had she done so both their stori
would have been veri differ to her he wa a clever companion and no
more
what made the thing more strang wa that he love no on els except
mayhap himself in thi wai and in that the lad soon came to learn hi
own histori which wa sad enough with the result that if he hate the
roman who had invad the countri and trampl it beneath their heel
still more did he hate those of the jew who look upon hi father
as their enemi and had stolen all the land and good that were hi by
right as for the essen who rear and protect him so soon as
he came to an ag when he could weigh such matter he held them in
contempt and becaus of their continu habit of bath themselv and
purifi their garment call them the compani of washerwomen on
him their doctrin left but a shallow mark he thought as he explain
to miriam that peopl who were in the world should take the world as
thei found it without dream ceaselessli of anoth world to which
as yet thei did not belong a sentiment that to some extent nehushta
share
wish with the zeal of the young to make a convert miriam preach
to him the doctrin of christian but without success by blood caleb
wa a jew of the jew and could not understand or admir a god who
would consent to be trodden under foot and crucifi the messiah he
desir to follow must be a great conqueror on who would overthrow
the csar and take the throne of csar not a humbl creatur with
hi mouth full of maxim like the major of hi own and inde
of everi gener to the last dai of hi life caleb wa unabl to
divin that mind is greater than matter while spirit is greater
than mind and that in the end by mani slow advanc and after mani
disast seemingli irremedi spiritu will conquer all he
look to a sword flash from throne not to the word of truth spoken
by lowli lip in humbl street or upon the flank of desert trust
to the wind of grace to bear it into the heart of men and thu
regener their soul
such wa caleb and these thing ar said of him here becaus the child
is father to the man
swiftli the year went by there were tumult in juda and massacr in
jerusalem fals prophet such as theuda who pretend that he could
divid jordan attract thousand to their tinsel standard to be hewn
down poor folk by the roman legion csar rose and fell the great
templ wa at length almost complet in it glori and mani event
happen which ar rememb even to thi dai
but in the littl villag of the essen by the grei shore of the dead
sea noth seem to chang except that now and again an ag brother
di and now and again a new brother wa admit thei rose befor
daylight and offer their invoc to the sun thei went out to
toil in the field and sow their crop to reap them in due season
thank if thei were good still thank if thei were bad thei
wash thei prai thei mourn over the wicked of the world and
wove themselv white garment emblemat of a better also although
of thi miriam knew noth thei held higher and more secret servic
wherein thei invok the presenc of their angel and by art of
divin that were known to them foretold the futur an exercis
which brought them littl joi but as yet howev evil might be the
omen none came to molest their peac life which ran quietli
toward the great catastroph as often deep water swirl to the lip of a
precipic
at length when miriam wa seventeen year of ag the first stroke of
troubl fell upon them
from time to time the high priest at jerusalem who hate the essen
as heret had made demand upon them that thei should pai tith for
the support of the sacrific in the templ thi thei refus to do
sinc all sacrific were hate to them so thing went on until the
dai of the high priest anano who sent arm men to the villag of the
essen to take the tith these were refus to them whereon thei
broke open the granari and help themselv destroi a great deal
which thei could not carri awai as it chanc on that dai miriam
accompani by nehushta had visit jericho return in the afternoon
thei pass through a certain torrent bed in which were mani rock and
among them thicket of thorn tree here thei were met by caleb now
a noblelook youth veri strong and activ who carri a bow in hi
hand and on hi back a sheath of six arrow
ladi miriam he said well met i have come to seek you and to
warn you not to return by the road todai sinc on it you will meet
present those thiev sent by the high priest to plunder the store of
the order who perhap will offer you insult or mischief for thei ar
drunk with wine look on of them ha struck me and he point to a
bruis upon hi shoulder and scowl
what then shall we do ask miriam go back to jericho
nai for there thei will come too follow up thi gulli till you reach
the footpath a mile awai and by it walk to the villag so you will
miss these robber
that is a good plan said nehushta come ladi
whither ar you go caleb ask miriam linger sinc she saw
that he did not mean to accompani them
i oh i shall hide among the rock near by till the men ar pass
and then go to seek that hyena which ha been worri the sheep i have
track him down and mai catch him as he come from hi hole at sunset
that is why i have brought my bow and arrow
come broke in nehushta impati come the lad well know how to
guard himself
be care caleb that you get no hurt from the hyena said miriam
doubtfulli as nehushta seiz her by the wrist and drag her awai
it is strang she ad as thei went that caleb should choos thi
even to go hunt
unless i mistak it is a human hyena whom he hunt answer nehushta
shortli on of those men struck him and he desir to wash the wound
with hi blood
oh sure not nou that would be take vengeanc and reveng is
evil
nehushta shrug her shoulder caleb mai think otherwis as i do at
time wait and we shall see
as it chanc thei did see someth the footpath by which thei
return to the villag ran over a high ridg of ground and from it
crest although thei were a mile or more awai in that clear desert
air thei could easili discern the line of the high priest servant
straggl along drive befor them a score or so of mule laden with
wine and other produc which thei had stolen from the store present
the compani of them descend into that gulli along which the road ran
whenc a minut or two later rose a sound of distant shout then thei
appear on the further side run or ride their beast hither
and thither as though in search of some on while four of them carri
between them a man who seem to be hurt or dead
i think that caleb ha shot hi hyena said nehushta meaningli but
i have seen noth and if you ar wise you will sai noth i do not
like caleb but i hate these jewish thiev and it is not for you to
bring your friend into troubl
miriam look frighten but nod her head and no more wa said of
the matter
that even as miriam and nehushta stood at the door of their hous in
the cool by the light of the full moon thei saw caleb advanc toward
them down the road a sight that made miriam glad at heart for she
fear lest he might have come into troubl catch sight of them he
ask permiss to enter through the door which he close behind them
so that now thei stood in the littl garden within the wall
well said nehushta i see that you had a shot at your hyena did you
kill it
how do you know that he ask look at her suspici
a strang question to put to a libyan woman who wa brought up among
bowmen she repli you had six arrow in your quiver when we met
you and now i count but five also your bow wa newli wax and look
the wax is rub where the shaft lai
i shot at the beast and as i think hit it at least i could not
find the arrow again although i search long
doubtless you do not often miss you have a good ey and a steadi
hand well the loss of a shaft will not matter sinc i notic
also that thi on wa differ barb from the other and doubl
feather a true roman warshaft such as thei do not make here if
ani find your wound beast you will not get it hide sinc it is known
that you do not us such arrow then with a smile that wa full of
mean nehushta turn and enter the hous leav him stare
after her half in wrath and half in wonder at her wit
what doe she mean he ask miriam but in the voic of on who
speak to himself
she think that you shot at a man not at a beast repli miriam
but i know well that you could not have done thi sinc that would be
against the rule of the essen
even the rule of the essen permit a man to protect himself and hi
properti from thiev he answer sulkili
ye to protect himself if he is attack and hi propertyif he ha
ani but neither that faith nor mine permit him to aveng a blow
i wa on against mani he answer boldli my life wa on the
hazard it wa no coward act
were there then a troop of these hyena ask miriam innoc
i thought you said it wa a solitari beast that took the sheep
it wa a whole compani of beast who took the wine and smote those in
charg of it as though thei were street dog
hyena that took wine like the tame ap whom the boi make drunken over
yonder
why do you mock me broke in caleb who must know the truth or if
you do not know it here it is that thief beat me with hi staff and
call me the son of a dog and i swore that i would pai him back pai
him back i did for the head of that shaft which nehushta note stand
out a span beyond hi neck thei never saw who shot it thei never saw
me at all who thought at first that the man had fallen from hi hors
by the time thei knew the truth i wa awai where thei could not follow
now go and tell the stori if you will or let nehushta who hate me
tell it and give me over to be tortur by the servant of the high
priest or crucifi as a murder by the roman
neither nehushta nor i saw thi deed done nor shall we bear wit
against you caleb or judg you who doubtless were provok by violent
and lawless men yet caleb you told me that you came out to warn us
and it griev me to learn that the true wish of your heart wa to take
the life of a man
it is fals he answer angrili i said that i came to warn you and
afterward to kill a hyena to make you safethat wa my first thought
and until you were safe my enemi wa safe also miriam you know it
well
why should i know it to you caleb i think reveng is more than
friendship
perhap for i have few friend who am a penniless orphan brought up by
chariti but miriam to me reveng is not more thanlov
love she stammer turn crimson to her hair and step back a
pace what do you mean caleb
what i sai neither more nor less he answer sullenli as i have
work on crime todai i mai as well work two and dare to tell the
ladi miriam the queen of the essen that i love her though she love
not mea yet
thi is mad falter miriam
mayhap but it is a mad which began when first i saw youthat wa
soon after we learn to speaka mad which will continu until i
ceas to see you and that shall be soon befor i grow silent forev
listen miriam and do not think my word onli those of a foolish boi
for all my life shall prove them thi love of mine is a thing with
which you must reckon you love me nottherefor even had i the power
i would not forc myself upon you against your will onli i warn you
learn to love no other man for then it shall go ill either with him or
with me by thi i swear it and snatch her to him caleb kiss
her on the forehead then let her go sai fear not it is the first
and last time except by your own will or if you fear tell the stori
to the court of the essen andto nehushta who will right your
wrong
caleb she gasp stamp her foot upon the ground in anger caleb
you ar more wick than i dream and she ad as though to
herselfand greater

am more wick than you dream andgreat also miriam i love you
as you will never be love again farewel
chapter vii
marcu
that night those of the curat who were engag in prayer and fast
were disturb by the return of an offic of those jew that had
rob them who complain violent that a man of hi compani had been
murder by on of the essen thei ask how and when and were told
that the man had been shot down with an arrow in a gulli upon the road
to jericho by a person unknown thei repli that robber sometim met
with robber and ask to see the arrow which prove to be of a roman
make such as these men carri in their own quiver thi the essen
point out and at length grow angri at the unreason of
a complaint made by person of the worst charact drove him and hi
escort from their door bid them take their stori to the high
priest anano with the good which thei had stolen or if thei
prefer it to that still greater thief the roman procur

essen were command to send some of their head men to appear befor
albinu to answer the charg laid against them accordingli thei
dispatch ithiel and two other who were kept wait three month at
jerusalem befor thei could even obtain a hear at length the caus
came on and after some few minut of talk wa adjourn be but a
petti matter that same even ithiel wa inform by an intermediari
that if hi order would pai a certain larg sum of monei to albinu
noth more would be heard of the question thi the essen refus
to do as it wa against their principl sai that thei demand
noth but justic which thei were not prepar to bui so thei spoke
be ignor that on of their neophyt caleb had in fact aim the
fatal arrow
then albinu weari of the busi and find that there wa no
profit to be made out of the essen command them to be gone sai
that he would send an offic to make inquiri on the spot
anoth two month went by and at length thi offic arriv attend
by an escort of twenti soldier
as it chanc on a certain morn in the winter season miriam
with nehushta wa walk on the jericho road when suddenli thei saw
approach toward them thi littl bodi of arm men perceiv that
thei were roman thei turn out of the path to hide themselv among
the thorn of the desert thereon he who seem to be the offic
spur hi hors forward to intercept them

wa half jewish had been brought up among men and felt neither fear

while thei were still convers thu of a sudden the bush on their

the path
your friend is not civil said marcu as he watch him go inde

bird of prei
caleb ad miriam in excus doe not like stranger

garden by an irrig ditch and a live pomegran fenc cover at
thi season of the year with it golden globe of fruit that even

adventur wherein caleb plai some strang part in that dream the
captain marcu protect them from all these danger till at length
thei came to a calm sea on which float a singl white ship wherein
thei must embark have the sign of the cross woven in it sail then
she awok and found that it wa morn
of all the art she had been taught miriam wa fondest of that of
model in clai for which she had a natur gift inde so great
had her skill becom that these model which she made after thei had
been bake with fire were at her wish sold by the essen to ani who
took a fanci to them as to the monei which thei fetch it wa paid
into a fund to be distribut among the poor
thi art miriam carri on in a reedthatch shed in the garden where
by an earthen pipe water wa deliv into a stone basin which she
us to damp her clai and cloth sometim also with the help of
mason and the master who had taught her now a veri old man she copi
these model in marbl which the essen brought to her from the ruin
of a palac near jericho at the time that the roman came she wa
finish a work more ambiti than ani which she had undertaken as
yet name a lifes bust cut from the fragment of an ancient
column to the like of her greatuncl ithiel on the afternoon
follow the dai that she met marcu clad in her white workingrob
she wa occupi in polish thi bust with the assist of
nehushta who hand her the cloth and grindingpowd suddenli
shadow fell upon her and turn she beheld ithiel and the roman
daughter said ithiel smile at her confus i have brought the

admir would that more of your sex could be found thu delightfulli
emploi
ala sir she repli adroitli misunderstand him for miriam did
not lack readi in thi poor work there is littl to admir i am
asham that you should look on the rude fashion of a halftrain
girl you who must have seen all those splendid statu of which i have
been told

convict of hi earnest stare hard at the bust of ithiel befor
him as it chanc although i am not an artist i do know someth of
sculptur sinc i have a friend who is held to be the best of our
dai and often for my sin have sat as model to him well i tell you
thisnev did the great glaucu produc a bust like that
i daresai not said miriam smile i daresai the great glaucu would
go mad if he saw it
he wouldwith envi he would sai that it wa the work of on of the
gloriou greek and of no modern
sir said ithiel reprovingli do not make a jest of the maid who
doe the best she can it pain her andi not fit
friend ithiel repli marcu turn quit crimson you must inde
think that i lack manner who would come to the home of ani artist to
mock hi work i sai what i mean neither more nor less if thi bust

miriam would find herself famou within a week ye and he ran hi ey
quickli over variou statuett some of them bake and some in the raw
clai model for the most part of camel or other anim or bird
ye and it is the same with all the rest these ar the work of
geniu no less
at thi prais to them so exagger miriam pleas as she could not
help feel broke into clear laugher which both ithiel and nehushta
echo now so wroth wa he the face of marcu grew quit pale and
stern
it seem he said sever that it is not i who mock tell me ladi
what do you with these thing and he point to the statuett
i sir i sell them or at least my uncl do

much as a silver shekel onc inde for a group of camel with
their arabian driver i receiv four shekel but that took my niec
three month to do
about 2s 6d of english monei

that sir is not for sale it is a gift to my uncl or rather to my
uncl to be set up in their courtroom
an idea struck marcu i am here for a few week he said tell
me ladi if your uncl ithiel will permit it at what price will you
execut a bust of myself of the same size and qualiti
it would be dear said miriam smile at the notion for the marbl

began
chapter viii
marcu and caleb
on the morrow as he had promis ithiel brought thi question
of whether or no miriam wa to be allow to execut a bust of the
centurion marcu befor the court of the curat of the essen who
were accustom thu to consid question connect with their ward
welfar in solemn conclav there wa a divis of opinion some of
them saw no harm other more straitlac held that it wa scarc
correct that a roman whose principl doubtless were lax should be
allow to sit to the ladi whom thei fondli call their child inde
it seem dubiou whether the leav would be given until a curat
with more worldli wisdom than the rest suggest that as the captain
seem desir of have hi pictur taken in stone under the
circumst of hi visit which includ a commiss to make a
gener report upon their societi to the author it might be
scarc wise to deni hi wish final a compromis wa effect it
wa agre that miriam should be permit to do the work but onli
in the presenc of ithiel and two other curat on of them her own
instructor in art
thu it came about that when marcu present himself for the second
time at an hour fix by ithiel he found three whitebeard and
whiterob old gentlemen seat in a row in the workshop and behind
them a smile on her duski face nehushta as he enter thei rose and
bow to him a compliment which he return now miriam appear to
whom he made hi salut
ar these he said indic the elder wait their turn to be
model or ar thei critic
thei ar critic said miriam drili as she lift the damp cloth
from the rude lump of clai
then the work began as the three curat were seat in a line at
the end of the shed and did not seem to think it right to leav their
chair thei could see littl of it detail and as thei were earli
riser and the afternoon wa hot soon thei were asleep everi on of
them
look at them said marcu there is a subject for ani artist
miriam nod and take three lump of clai work deftli and
silent present produc to hi delight sight rough but excel
portrait of these admir men who when thei woke up laugh at
them veri heartili
thu thing went on from dai to dai each afternoon the elder attend
and each afternoon thei sank to slumber in their comfort chair an
exampl that nehushta follow or seem to follow leav miriam and
her model practic alon as mai be guess the model who like
convers did not neglect these opportun few were the subject
which the two of them fail to discuss he told her of all hi life
which had been vari and excit omit it is true certain
detail also of the war in which he had serv and the countri that
he had visit she in turn told him the simpl stori of her exist
among the essen which he seem to find of interest when these
subject were exhaust thei discuss other thingsth matter of
religion for instanc inde miriam ventur to expound to him the
principl of her faith to which he listen respectfulli and with
attent
it sound well he said at length with a sigh but how do such maxim
fit in with thi world of our see now ladi i am not old but alreadi
i have studi so mani religion first there ar the god of greec
and rome my own god you understandwel the less said of them the
better thei serv that is all then there ar the god of egypt as
to which i made inquiri and of them i will sai thi that beneath the
grotesqu cloak of their worship seem to shine some spark of a holi
fire next come the god of the phnician the father of a hideou
creed after them the flame worshipp and other kindr religion of
the east there remain the jew whose doctrin seem to me a savag
on at least it involv bloodsh with the daili offer of blood
also thei ar divid these jew for some ar pharise some
sadduce some essen lastli there ar you christian whose faith
is pure enough in theori but whom all unit against in hate what is
the worth of a belief in thi crucifi preacher who promis that he
will rais those who trust in him from the dead
that you will find out when everyth els ha fail you answer
miriam
ye it is a religion for those whom everyth els ha fail when
that chanc to the rest of us we commit suicid and sink from sight
and we she said proudli rise to life etern
it mai be so ladi it mai be so but let us talk of someth
more cheer and he sigh at present i hold that noth is
eternalexcept perhap such art as your
which will be forgotten in the first chang of tast or crumbl in
the first fire but see he is awak come here my master and work
thi nostril for it is beyond me
the old artist advanc and look at the bust with admir
maid miriam he said i us to have some skill in thi art and i
taught you it rudiment but now child i am not fit to temper your
clai deal with the nostril as you will i am but a hodman who bear the
brick you ar the heavenborn architect i will not meddl i will not
meddl yet perhap and he made a suggest
so said miriam touch the clai with her tool oh look it is
right now you ar clever my master
it wa alwai right i mai be clever but you have geniu and would
have found the fault without ani help from me
did i not sai so broke in marcu triumphantli
sir repli miriam you sai a great deal and much of it i think
you do not mean pleas be silent at thi moment i wish to studi your
lip and not your word
so the work went on thei did not alwai talk for soon thei found that
speech is not necessari to true companionship onc miriam began to
sing and sinc she discov that her voic pleas marcu and sooth
the slumber of the elder she sang often quaint sad song of the
desert and of the jordan fishermen also she told him tale and legend
and when she had done nehushta told otherswild stori of libya some
of them veri dark and bloodi other of magic black or white thu
these afternoon pass happili enough and the clai model be
finish after the mason among the brethren had rough hewn it for her
miriam began to fashion it in marbl
there wa on howev for whom these dai did not pass happilycaleb
from the time that he had seen miriam walk side by side with marcu
he hate the brilliantlook roman in whom hi instinct warn him
he had found a danger rival oh how he hate him so much inde
that even in the moment of first meet he could not keep hi rage and
envi in hi heart but suffer them to be written on hi face and
to shine like danger signal in hi ey which it mai be rememb
marcu did not neglect to note
of miriam caleb had seen but littl late she wa not angri with him
sinc hi offenc wa of a natur which a woman can forgiv but in
her heart she fear him of a sudden as it were the curtain had been
drawn and she had seen thi young man secret spirit and learn that
it wa a consum fire it had come home to her that everi word he
spoke wa true that he who wa orphan and not like even by the
gentl elder of the essen love but on be upon earthherself
wherea alreadi hi bosom seeth with mani hate she wa sure also
that ani man for whom she chanc to care if such an on should ever
cross her path would as caleb had promis go in danger at hi hand
and the thought frighten her most of all did it frighten her when she
saw him glower upon marcu although in truth the roman wa noth to
her yet as she knew caleb had judg otherwis
but if she saw littl of him of thi miriam wa sure enoughthat he
wa seldom far from her and that he found mean to learn from dai to
dai how she spent her hour inde marcu told her that wherev he
went he met that handsom young man with reveng ey who she had
said wa name caleb therefor miriam grew frighten and as the issu
will show not without caus
on afternoon while miriam wa at work upon the marbl and the three
elder were as usual sunk in slumber marcu said suddenli
i forgot i have new for you ladi i have found out who murder that
jewish thief whose end amongst other thing i wa sent to investig
it wa your friend caleb
miriam start so violent that her chisel gave an unexpect effect to
on of marcuss curl
hush she said glanc toward the sleeper on of whom had just
snore so loudli that he began to awak at the sound then ad in a
whisper thei do not know do thei
he shook hi head and look puzzl
i must speak to you of thi matter she went on with agit and in
the same whisper no not now or here but alon
when and where you will answer marcu smile as if the prospect
of a solitari convers with miriam did not displeas him although
thi evildo caleb wa to be it subject name the time and place
ladi
by now the snore elder wa awak and rise from hi chair with a
great nois which in turn rous the other nehushta also rose from
her seat and in do so as though by accid overset a copper trai
on which lai metal tool
in the garden on hour after sunset nehushta will leav the littl
lower door unlock
good answer marcu then ad in a loud voic not so ladi ye
god what a nois i think the curl improv by the slip it look less
as though it had been wax after the egyptian fashion sir why do
you disturb yourselv i fear that to you thi long wait must be as
tediou as to me it seem unnecessari
the sun wa down and the last red glow had fade from the western sky
which wa now lit onli by the soft light of a halfmoon all the
world lai bath in peac and beauti even the stern outlin of the
surround mountain seem soften and the pale water of the dead
sea and the ashen face of the desert gleam like silver new cast from
the mould from the oleand and lili which bloom along the edg
of the irrig channel and from the white flower of the glossi
goldenfruit orang tree float a perfum delici to the sens
while the silenc wa onli broken from time to time by the bark of a
wander dog or the howl of a jackal in the wilder
a veri pleasant nightto talk about caleb reflect marcu who had
reach the appoint spot ten minut befor the time as he stroll
from the narrow belt of tree that were plant along the high outer
wall into the more open part of the garden had marcu chanc to
notic that thi same caleb walk softli as a cat and keep with
great care in the shadow had follow him through the littl door which
he forgot to lock and wa now hidden among those veri tree he might
have rememb a proverb to the effect that snake hide in the greenest
grass and the prettiest flower have thorni stem but he thought of no
such thing who wa lost in happi anticip of a moonlight interview
with a love and cultur young ladi whose imag to speak truth had
taken so deep a hold upon hi fanci that sometim he wonder how he
would be abl to banish it thenc again at present he could think of
no better mean than that which at thi moment he wa follow
with delight meet in moonlit garden tend proverbi to
disenchant
present marcu caught the gleam of a white robe follow by a dark
on flit toward him through the dim and dewi garden and at the
sight hi heart stood still then began to beat again in a disorderli
fashion had he known it anoth heart a few yard behind him also
stood still and then began to beat like that of a man in a violent
rage it seem possibl also that a third heart experienc unusu
sensat
i wish she had left the old ladi behind mutter marcu no i
dont for then there ar brute who if thei knew might blame her
and luckili for himself he walk forward a few pace to meet the
white robe leav the littl belt of tree almost out of hear
now miriam stood befor him the moonlight shine on her delic face
and in her tranquil ey which alwai remind him of the blue depth
of heaven
sir she began
oh i prai you he broke in ceas from ceremoni and call me marcu
captain marcu she repeat dwell a littl on the unfamiliar
name i beg that you will forgiv me for disturb you at so
unseason an hour
certainli i forgiv you ladi miriam he repli also dwell on
her name and copi her accent in a fashion that made the grimfac
nehushta smile
she wave her hand in deprec the truth is that thi matter of
caleb
oh mai all the infern god take caleb as i have reason to believ
thei shortli will broke in marcu angrili
but that is just what i wish to prevent we have met here to talk of
caleb
well if you musttalk and let us be done with him what about caleb
miriam clasp her hand what do you know of him captain marcu
know why just thi a spy i have in my troop ha found out a countri
fellow who wa hunt for mushroom or somethingi forget whatin a
gulli a mile awai and saw thi interest youth hide himself there
and shoot that jewish plunder with a bow and arrow moreh ha found
anoth man who saw the said caleb an hour or two befor help himself
to an arrow out of on of the jew quiver which arrow appear to be
ident with or at ani rate similar to that which wa found in the
fellow gullet therefor it seem that caleb is guilti and that it
will be my duti tomorrow to place him under arrest and in due cours
to convei him to jerusalem where the priest will attend to hi littl
busi now ladi miriam is your curios satisfi about caleb
oh she said it cannot be it must not be the man had struck him
and he did but return a blow for a blow
an arrow for a blow you mean the point of a spear for the push of it
handl but ladi miriam you seem to be veri deep in the confid of
caleb how do you come to know all thi
i dont know i onli guess i daresai nai i am sure that caleb is
quit innoc
why do you take such an interest in caleb ask marcu suspici
becaus he wa my friend and playmat from childhood
umph he answer a strang couplea dove and a raven well i am
glad that you did not catch hi temper or you would be more danger
even than you ar now what do you want me to do
i want you to spare caleb you you youne not believ those
wit
to think of it said marcu in mock horror to think that on whom i
thought so good can prove so immor do you then wish to tempt me from
my duti
ye i suppos so at least the peasant round here ar great liar
ladi said marcu with stern convict caleb ha improv upon hi
opportun as a playmat he ha been make love to you i thought
so from the first
oh she answer how can you know that besid he promis that he
would never do it again
how can i know that why becaus caleb would have been a bigger fool
than i take him for if he had not and if it rest with me certainli
he never would do it again now be honest with me if a woman can on
such a matter and tell me true ar you in love with thi caleb
ii in love with caleb of cours not if you do not believ me ask
nehushta
thank you i will be content with your own repli you deni that you ar
in love with him and i inclin to believ you but on the other hand
i rememb that you would natur sai thi sinc you might think that
ani other answer would prejudic the caus of caleb with me
with you what can it matter to you sir whether or no i am in love
with caleb who to tell you the truth frighten me
and that i suppos is why you plead so hard for him
no she answer with a sudden stern i plead hard for him as in
like case i would plead hard for youbecaus he ha been my friend and
if he did thi deed he wa provok to it
well spoken said marcu gaze at her steadili inde she wa
worth look at as she stood there befor him her hand clasp her
breast heav her sweet pale face flush with emot and her love
ey aswim with tear of a sudden as he gaze marcu lost control of
himself passion for thi maiden and bitter jealousi of caleb aros like
twin giant in hi heart and possess him
you sai you ar not in love with caleb he said well kiss me and i
will believ you
how could such a thing prove my word she ask indignantli
i do not know and i do not care kiss me onc and i will believ
further that the peasant of these part ar all liar i feel myself
begin to believ it
and if i will not
then i am afraid i must refer the matter to a compet tribun at
jerusalem
nehushta nehushta you have heard what shall i do
what shall you do said nehushta drili well if you like to give the
nobl marcu a kiss i shall not blame you overmuch or tell on you but
if you do not wish it then i think you would be a fool to put yourself
to shame to save caleb
yet i will do itand to save caleb onli said miriam with a sob and
she bent toward him
to her surpris marcu drew back place hi hand befor hi face
forgiv me he said i wa a brute who wish to bui kiss in such
a fashion i forgot myself your beauti is to blame and your sweet
and everyth that is your i prai he ad humbl that you will
not think the wors of me sinc we men ar frail at time and now
becaus you ask me though i have no right i grant your prayer mayhap
those wit li at least the man sin if sin there be can be
excus he ha naught to fear from me
no broke in nehushta but i think you have much to fear from him
and i am sorri for that my lord marcu for you have a nobl heart
it mai be so the futur is on the knee of the god and that which
is fate will befal my ladi miriam i your humbl servant and friend
wish you farewel
farewel she answer ye nehushta is right you have a nobl
heart and she look at him in such a fashion that it flash across
hi mind that were he to proffer that request of hi again it might
not be refus but marcu would not do it he had tast of the joi of
selfconquest who hitherto after the manner of hi ag and race had
deni himself littl and as it seem to him a strang new power
wa stir in hi heartsometh purer higher nobler than he had
known befor he would cherish it a while
of all that were spoken there in the garden caleb the watcher could
catch no word the speaker did not rais their voic and thei stood
at a distanc so that although he crane hi head forward as far as he
dare in the shadow of the tree sharp and train as thei were naught
save a confus murmur reach hi ear but if these fail him hi
ey fed full so that he lost no move or gestur it wa a passion
love scene thi wa clear for nehushta stood at a littl distanc with
her back turn while the pair pour out their sweet speech to each
other then at length as he had expect came the climax ye oh
shameless womanthei were embrac a mist fell upon caleb ey in
which light flash like redhot sword lift and smite the blood
drum in hi ear as though hi rage jealou heart would burst
he would kill that roman now on the spot miriam should never kiss him
moreal
alreadi caleb had drawn the shortsword from it hidingplac in hi
ampl robe alreadi he had step out from the shadow of the tree
when of a sudden hi reason right itself like a ship that ha been
laid over by a furiou squall and caution came back to him if he
did thi that faithless guardian nehushta who without doubt had been
bought with roman gold would come to the assist of her patron and
thrust her dagger through hi back as she well could do or should he
escap that dagger on or other of them would rais the essen on
him and he would be given over to justic he wish to slai not to be
slain it would be sweet to kill the roman but if he himself were laid
dead across hi bodi leav miriam aliv to pass to some other man
what would he be advantag present thei must ceas from their
endear present hi enemi would return as he had come and then
he might find hi chanc he would wait he would wait
look thei had part miriam wa glide back to the hous and marcu
came toward him walk like a man in hi sleep onli nehushta
stood where she wa her ey fix upon the ground as though she were
reason with herself still like a man in a dream marcu pass him
within touch of hi outstretch hand caleb follow marcu open the
door went out of it and pull it to behind him caleb caught it
in hi hand slip through and close it a few pace down the
walleight or ten perhapswa anoth door by which marcu enter
the garden of the guesthous as he turn to shut thi caleb push
in after him and thei were face to face
who ar you ask the roman spring back
caleb who by now wa cool enough close the door and shot the bolt
then he answer caleb the son of hilliel who wish a word with
you
ah said marcu the veri man and as usual unless the light
deceiv me in an evil humour well caleb the son of hilliel what is
your busi with me
on of life and death marcu the son of emiliu he answer in such
a tone that the roman drew hi sword and stood watch him
be plain and brief young man he said
i will be both plain and brief i love that ladi from whom you have
just part and you also love or pretend to love her nai deni it
not i have seen all even to your kiss well she cannot belong to
both of us and i intend that in some futur dai she shall belong to
me if arm and ey do not fail me now therefor on of us must die
tonight
marcu step back overcom not with fear but with astonish
insol he said you lie there were no kiss and our talk wa of
your neck that i gave to her becaus she ask it which is forfeit for
the murder of the jew
inde sneer caleb now who would have thought that the nobl
captain marcu would shelter thu behind a woman robe for the rest
my life is my own and no other to give or to receiv guard yourself
roman sinc i would kill you in fair fight had i anoth mind you
would be dead by now never know the hand that struck you have no
fear i am your equal for my forefath were nobl when your were
savag
boi ar you mad ask marcu to think that i who have fought in
three war can fear a beardless youth howev fierc why if i fear
you i have but to blow upon thi whistl and my guard would hale you
henc to a felon death for your own sake it is that i prai you to
consid set asid my rank and your i will fight you if you will
and now yet think if i kill you there is an end and if by chanc you
should kill me you will be hunt down as a doubl murder as it is
i forgiv you becaus i know how bitter is the jealousi of youth
and becaus you struck no assassin blow when you might have done so
safe therefor i sai go in peac know that i shall not break my
word
ceas talk said caleb and come out into the moonlight
i am glad that is your wish repli marcu have done all i can
to save you i will add that i think you a danger cub of whom the
world the ladi miriam and i alik will be well rid now what weapon
have you a short sword and no mail well so have i in thi we ar
well match stai i have a steellin cap and you have none there
it goe to make our chanc equal wind your cloak about your left arm
as i do i have known wors shield good foothold but an uncertain
light now go
caleb need no encourag for on second thei stood face each
other veri type of the eastern and western world the romansturdi
honestei watch and fearless hi head thrown back hi feet
apart hi shield arm forward hi sword hand press to hi side from
which the steel project over against him wa the jew crouch like a
tiger about to spring hi ey half close as though to concentr the
light hi face work with rage and everi muscl quiver till hi
whole flesh seem to move upon hi bone like to that of a snake
suddenli utter a low cry he sprang and with that savag onslaught
the fight began and end
marcu wa readi moreov he knew what he would do as the man came
step swiftli to on side he caught the thrust of caleb sword in
the fold cloak and sinc he did not wish to kill him struck at hi
hand the blow fell upon caleb first finger and sever it cut
the other also so that it drop to the ground with the sword that
thei had held marcu put hi foot upon the blade and wheel round
young man he said sternli you have learnt your lesson and will bear
the mark of it till your death dai now begon
the wretch caleb ground hi teeth it wa to the death he said it
wa to the death you have conquer kill me and with hi bloodi hand
he tore open hi robe to make a path for the sword
leav such talk to playactor answer marcu begon and be sure
of thisthat if ever you try to bring treacheri on me or troubl on
the ladi miriam i will kill you sure enough
then with a sound that wa half curs and half sob caleb turn and
slunk awai with a shrug of the shoulder marcu also turn to go when
he felt a shadow fall upon him and swung round to find nehushta at hi
side
and prai where did you come from my libyan friend he ask
out of that pomegran fenc my roman lord whenc i have seen and
heard all that pass
inde then i hope that you give me credit for good swordplai and
good temper
the swordplai wa well enough though noth to boast of with such a
madman for a foe as for the temper it wa that of a fool
such soliloquis marcu is the reward of virtu but i am curiou
why
becaus my lord marcu thi caleb will grow into the most danger
man in juda and to none more danger than to my ladi miriam and
yourself you should have kill him while you had the chanc befor
hi turn come to kill you
perhap answer marcu with a yawn but friend nehushta i have
been associ with a christian and have caught someth of her
doctrin that seem a fine sword you had better keep it goodnight

befor her he kiss first her hand and next the hem of her robe then
he turn and went
that night watch from the roof of her hous by the light of the full
moon miriam saw marcu ride awai at the head of hi band of soldier
on the crest of a littl ridg of ground outsid the villag he halt
leav them to go on and turn hi hors head look backward
thu he stood awhil the silver rai of the moon shine on hi bright
armour and make him a point of light set between two vale of shadow
miriam could guess whither hi ey were turn and what wa in hi
heart it seem to her even that she could feel hi love thought
plai upon her and that with the ear of hi spirit he could catch the
answer of her own then suddenli he turn and wa lost in the gloom of
the night
now that he wa gone quit gone miriam courag seem to leav her
and lean her head upon the parapet she wept tear that were soft but
veri bitter suddenli a hand wa laid upon her shoulder and a voic
that of old nehushta spoke in her ear
mourn not it said sinc him whom you lose in the night you mai find
again in the daytim
in no dai that dawn from an earthli sun i fear me nou oh nou he
ha gone and taken my heart with him leav in it place a throb
pain which is more than i can bear
he will come back i tell you that he will come back she answer
almost fierc for your life and hi ar intertwinedy to the
enda singl cord bear a doubl destini i know it ask me not how
but be comfort for it is truth moreov though it be sharp your
pain is not more than you can bear els it would never be laid upon
you
but nou if he doe come back what will it help me who am built in
by thi strict command of them that begat me to break through which
would be to sin against and earn the curs of god and man
i do not know i onli know thi that in that wall as in other a
door will be found troubl not for the futur but leav it in the
hand of him who shape all futur suffici to the dai is the evil
thereof so he said accept the sai and be grate it is someth
to have gain the love of such a on as thi roman for unless the
wisdom which i have gain through mani year is at fault he is true
and honest and that man must be good at heart who can be rear in rome
and in the worship of it god and yet remain honest rememb these
thing and i sai be grate sinc there ar mani who go through their
live know no such joi even for an hour
i will try nou said miriam humbl still stare at the ridg whenc
marcu had vanish
you will try and you will succe now there is anoth matter of
which i must speak to you when the essen receiv us it wa solemnli
decre that if you live to reach the full ag of eighteen year you
must depart from among them that hour struck for you nearli a year ago
and although you heard noth of it thi decre wa debat by the
court now such decre mai not be broken but it wa argu that the
word full ag of eighteen year meant and were intend to mean
until you reach your nineteenth birthdai that isin a month from
now
then must we go nou ask miriam in dismai for she knew no other
world but thi villag in the desert and no other friend than these
vener men whom she call her uncl
it seem so especi as it is now guess that caleb fought the
captain marcu upon your account oh that tale is talk offor on
thing the young wildcat left a claw behind him which the garden
found
i trust then it is known also that the fault wa none of mine but
nou whither shall we go who have neither friend nor home nor monei
i know not but doubtless in thi wall also there is a door if the
worst come to the worst a christian ha mani brother moreov with
your skill in the art you need never lack for a live in ani great
citi in the world
it is true said miriam brighten that is if i mai believ
marcu and my old master
also continu nehushta i have still almost all the gold that the
phnician amram gave us when i fled with your mother and ad to it
that which i took from the strong box of the captain of the gallei on
the night when you were born so have no fear we shall not want nor
inde would the essen suffer such a thing now child you ar weari
go to rest and dream that you have your lover back again
it wa with a heavi heart that caleb defeat and shame shook the
dust of the villag of the essen off hi feet at dawn on the morn
after the night that he had fought the duel with marcu he also might
have been seen a staff in hi bandag hand and a bag of provis
over hi shoulder stand upon the littl ridg and gaze toward the
hous which shelter miriam in love and war thing had gone ill with
him so ill that at the thought of hi discomfitur he ground hi teeth
miriam care noth for him marcu had defeat him at the first
encount and given him hi life while worst of all these two
from whom he had endur so much love each other few perhap have
suffer more sharpli than he suffer in that hour for what agoni
ar there like those of disappoint love and the shame of defeat when
endur in youth with time most men grow accustom to disast and
rebuff the colt that seem to break it heart at the cut of a whip
will hobbl at last to the knacker unmov by a shower of blow
while caleb look the red rim of the sun rose abov the horizon
flood the world with light and life now bird began to chirp and
beast to move now the shadow fled awai caleb impression natur
answer to thi chang hope stir in hi breast even the pain of
hi maim hand wa forgotten
i will win yet he shout to the silent sky my troubl ar done
with i will shine like the sun i will rule like the sun and my
enemi shall whither beneath my power it is a good omen now i am glad
that the roman spare my life that in a dai to come i mai take hisand
miriam
then he turn and trudg onward through the gloriou sunlight
watch hi own shadow that stretch awai befor him
it goe far he said again thi also is a veri good omen
caleb thought much on hi wai to jerusalem moreov he talk with all
whom he met even with bandit and footpad whom hi poverti could not
tempt for he desir to learn how matter stood in the land arriv in
jerusalem he sought out the home of that ladi who had been hi mother
friend and who gave him over a helpless orphan to the care of the
essen he found that she wa dead but her son live a man of kind
heart and given to hospit who had heard hi stori and shelter
him for hi mother sake when hi hand wa heal and he procur some
good cloth and a littl monei from hi friend without sai anyth
of hi purpos caleb attend the court of gessiu floru the roman
procur at hi palac seek an opportun to speak with him
thrice did he wait thu for hour at a time on each occas to be
driven awai at last by the guard on hi fourth visit he wa more
fortun for floru who had note him befor ask why he stood
there so patient an offic repli that the man had a petit to
make
let me hear it then said the governor i sit in thi place to
administ justic by the grace and in the name of csar
accordingli caleb wa summon and found himself in the presenc of a
small darkei beetlebrow roman with crop hair who look what
he wason of the most evil ruler that ever held power in juda
what do you seek jew he ask in a harsh voic
what i am assur i shall find at your hand o most nobl floru
justic against the jewspur justic word at which the courtier
and guard titter and even floru smile
it is to be had at a price he repli
i am prepar to pai the price
then set out your case
so caleb set it out he told how mani year befor hi father had
been accident slain in a tumult and how he the son be but an
infant certain jew of the zealot had seiz and divid hi estat
on the ground that hi father wa a partisan of the roman leav him
the son to be brought up by charitywhich estat consist of tract
of rich land and certain hous properti in jerusalem and tyre wa
still in their possess or in that of their descend
the black ey of floru glisten as he heard
their name he said snatch at hi tablet but as yet caleb wa
not mind to give the name first he intim that he desir to
arriv at a formal agreement as to what proport of the properti if
recov would be hand over to him the heir then follow much
haggl but in the end it wa agre that as he had been rob
becaus hi father wa suppos to favour the roman the land and a
larg dwell with warehous attach at tyre togeth with onehalf
the back rent if recover should be given to the plaintiff
the governor or as he put it csar for hi share wa to retain
the properti in jerusalem and the other half of the rent in thi
arrang caleb prove himself as usual prescient hous as he
explain afterward could be burn or pull down but beyond the
crop on it land no man could injur then after the agreement had
been duli sign and wit he gave the name bring forward good
testimoni to prove all that he had said
within a week those jew who had commit the theft or their
descend were in prison whenc thei did not emerg till thei had
been strip not onli of the stolen properti but of everyth els
that thei possess either becaus he wa pleas at so great and
unexpect a harvest or perhap for the reason that he saw in caleb
an abl fellow who might be us in the futur floru fulfil hi
bargain with him to the letter
thu it came about that by a strang turn of the wheel of chanc within
a month of hi flight from the coloni of the essen caleb the outcast
orphan with hi neck in danger of the sword becam a man of influenc
have great possess hi sun had risen inde

consider in cash and bill befor you leav my hous now what of
these essen
onli thi said marcu thei ar a strang peopl who read the
futur i know not how on of them with whom i becam friendli
foretold that mighti troubl were about to fall upon thi land of
yoursslaught and pestil and famin such as the world ha not
seen
that is an old propheci of those accurs nazaren broke in benoni
call them not accurs friend said marcu in an odd voic for you
should do so least of all men nai hear me out it mai be a propheci of
the nazaren but it is also a propheci of the essen and i believ
it who watch the sign of the time now the elder told me thi that
there will be a great upris of the jew against the strength of
csar and that most of those who join in it shall perish he even gave
name and among them wa your friend benoni therefor becaus you
have lent me monei although i am a roman i have come to tyre to warn
you to keep clear of rebellion and other tumult
the old man listen quietli but not as on who disbeliev
all thi mai be so he said but if my name is written in that book
of the dead the angel of jehovah ha chosen me and i cannot escap hi
sword moreov i am ag andher hi ey flashedit is a good
end to die fight on countri enemi
how you jew do love us to be sure said marcu with a littl laugh
the nation that send a gessiu floru or even an albinu to rule it
alien subject must need be love repli benoni with bitter sarcasm
but let us be done with polit lest we grow angri it is strang but
a visitor ha just left me who wa brought up among these essen
inde said marcu stare vacantli into the sea
he told me that a young and beauti woman resid with them who is
name the queen of the essen did you chanc to see her my lord
instantli marcu becam veri wide awak oh ye i saw her and what
els did he tell you
he told me that thi ladi wa both beauti and learn
that is true said marcu with enthusiasm to my mind although she
is small i never saw on loveli nor do i know a sculptor who is her
equal if you will come with me to the ship i will open the case and
show you the bust she made of me but tell me did thi visitor of your
lack the forefing on on handhi right
he did
then i suppos that he is name caleb
ye but how do you know that
becaus i cut off hi forefing said marcu in a fair fight and
he ad savag he is a young rascal as murder as he is abl
whose life i did ill to spare
ah said benoni it seem that i have still some discern for
just so i judg him well what more do you know of the ladi
someth sinc in a wai i am affianc to her
inde well thi is strang for so as he told me is caleb
he told you that said marcu spring from hi chair then he li
and would that i had time to prove it on hi bodi she reject him i
have it from nehushta also i know it in other wai
then she did accept you my lord marcu
not quit he repli sadli but that wa onli becaus i am not a
christian she love me all the same he ad recov upon that
point there can be no doubt
caleb seem to doubt it suggest benoni
caleb is a liar repeat marcu with emphasi and on of whom you
will do well to bewar
why should i bewar of him
marcu paus a moment then answer boldli
becaus the ladi miriam is your granddaught and the heiress of your
wealth i sai it sinc if i did not caleb would probabl he ha done
so alreadi
for a moment benoni hid hi face in hi hand then he lift it and
said
i thought as much and now i am sure but my lord marcu if my blood
is her my wealth is my own
just so keep it if you will or leav it where you will it is miriam
i seek and not your monei
i think that caleb seek both miriam and my moneylik a prudent
man why should he not have them he is a jew of good blood he will i
think rise high
and i am a roman of better blood who will rise higher
ye a roman and i the grandfath am a jew who do not love you
roman
and miriam is neither jew nor roman but a christian brought up not by
you but by the essen and she love me although she will not marri
me becaus i am not a christian
benoni shrug hi shoulder as he answer
all of thi is a problem which i must ponder on and solv
marcu sprang from hi seat and stood befor the old man with menac in
hi air
look you benoni he said thi is a problem not to be solv by you
or by caleb but by miriam herself and none other do you understand
i understand that you threaten me
ay i do miriam is of full ag her sojourn with the essen must come
to an end doubtless you will take her to dwell with you well bewar
how you deal by her if she wish to marri caleb of her own free will
let her do so but if you forc her to it or suffer him to forc her
then by your god and by my god and by her god i tell you that i will
come back and take such a vengeanc upon him and upon you and upon all
your peopl that it shall be a stori for gener do you believ
me
benoni look up at the man who stood befor him in hi youth and
beauti hi ey on fire and hi form quiver with rage and look
shrank back a littl he did not know that thi lightheart roman had
such strength and purpos at command now he understood for the first
time that he wa a true son of the terribl race of conqueror who if
he were cross could be as merciless as the worst of them on whose
veri honesti and open made him to be fear the more
i understand that you believ what you sai whether when you ar back
at rome where there ar women as fair as the queen of the essen you
will continu to believ it is anoth matter
ye a matter for me to settl
quit sofor you to settl have you anyth to add to the command
you ar pleas to lai upon your humbl creditor benoni the merchant
ye two thing first that when i leav thi hous you will no longer
be my creditor i have brought monei to pai you off in full princip
and interest my talk of borrow wa but a plai and excus to learn
what you knew of miriam nai do not start though it mai seem strang
to you that i also can be subtl foolish man did you think that i with
my prospect should be left to lack for a miser halftal why
there at jerusalem i could have borrow ten or twenti if i would
promis my patronag by wai of interest my servant wait with the
gold without call them in present and pai yourself princip and
interest and someth for a bonu now for the second miriam is a
christian bewar how you tamper with her faith it is not mine but i
saybewar how you tamper with it you gave her father and her mother
your own daughter to be slaughter by gladiat and to be torn by
lion becaus forsooth thei did not think as you do lift on finger
against her and i will hale you into the amphitheatr at rome there
yourself to be slaughter by gladiat or to be torn by lion
although i am absent i shall know all that you do for i have friend
who ar good and spi that ar better moreov i return here shortli
now i ask you will you give me your solemn word swear it by that
god whom you worship first that you will not attempt to forc your
granddaught miriam into marriag with caleb the jew and secondli
that you will shelter her treat her with all honour and suffer
her to follow her own faith in freedom
benoni sprang from hi couch
no roman i will not who ar you who dare to dictat to me in my own
hous as to how i shall deal with my own grandchild pai what you ow
and get you gone and darken my door no more i have done with you
ah said marcu well perhap it is time that you should
travel those who travel and see strang countri and peopl grow
liberalmind which you ar not be pleas to read thi paper and
he laid a write befor him
benoni took it and read it wa word thu
to marcu the son of emiliu the captain in the name of csar
greet herebi we command you should you in your discret think
fit to seiz the person of benoni the jewish merchant a dweller in
tyre and to convei him as a prison to rome there to answer charg
which have been laid against him with the particular of which you ar
acquaint which said particular you will find await you in rome
of have conspir with certain other jew to overthrow the author
of csar in thi hi provinc of juda
sign gessiu floru procur
benoni have read sank back upon hi couch gasp hi white face
livid with surpris and fear then a thought seem to strike him
seiz the paper he tore it into fragment
now roman he said where is your warrant
in my pocket answer marcu that which i show you wa but a
copi nai do not ring do not touch that bell see thi and he drew
a silver whistl from hi robe outsid your gate stand fifti soldier
shall i sound it
not so answer benoni i will swear the oath though inde it is
needless why should you suppos that i could wish to forc thi maid
into ani marriag or to work her evil on account of matter of her
faith
becaus you ar a jew and a bigot you gave her father and her mother
to a cruel death why should you spare her also you hate me and all
my peopl why then should you not favour my rival although he is a
murder whose life i have twice spare at the prayer of miriam swear
now
so benoni lift hi hand and swore a solemn oath that he would not
forc hi granddaught miriam to marri caleb or ani other man
and that he would not betrai the secret of her faith or persecut her
becaus of it
it is not enough said marcu write it down and sign
so benoni went to the tabl and wrote out hi undertak and sign it
marcu sign also as a wit
now benoni he said as he took the paper listen to me that
warrant leav your take to my discret after i have made search
into the fact i have made such search and it seem that i am not
satisfi but rememb that the warrant is still aliv and can be
execut at ani moment rememb also that you ar watch and if
you lift a finger against the girl it will be put in forc for the
restif you desir that the propheci of the essen should not come
true it is my advic that you ceas from make plot against the
majesti of csar now bid your servant summon him who wait in the
antechamb that he mai discharg my debt and so farewel when and
where we shall meet again i do not know but be sure that we shall
meet then marcu left the portico
benoni watch him go and as he watch an evil look gather on hi
face
threaten trodden to the dirt outwit by that roman boi he
murmur is there ani cup of shame left for me to drink who is the
traitor and how much doe he know someth but not all els my
arrest could scarc have been left to the fanci of thi patrician
favourit though he be ye my lord marcu i too am sure that we shall
meet again but the fashion of that meet mai be littl to your tast
you have had your hour mine is to come for the rest i must keep my
oath sinc to break it would be too danger and might cut the hair
that hold the sword also why should i wish to harm the girl or to
wed her to thi rogu caleb than whom mayhap even the roman would be
better at least he is a man who doe not cheat or lie inde i long
to see the maid i will go at onc to jordan
then he sound hi bell and command that the servant of the lord
marcu should be admit

inde now that he had seen her so loth wa he to part with thi
newfound daughter that he would have done still more had it been ask
of him lest she should be spirit from hi sight as did he refus
might well happen
three dai later miriam bade farewel to her protector who accompani
her by hundr to the ridg abov the villag here thei stop and
see that the moment of separ wa at hand miriam tear began
to flow
weep not belov child said ithiel for though we part with you in

that i believ also said miriam and if it be so grandsir i will
repai love for love then she turn to the essen and thank them in
broken word
be not downheart said ithiel in a thick voic for i hope that
even in thi life we shall meet again
mai it be so answer miriam and thei part the essen return
sadli to their home and benoni take the road through jericho to
jerusalem
travel slowli at the even of the second dai thei set their camp
on open ground not far from the damascu gate of the holi citi but
within the new north wall that had been built by agrippa into the citi
itself benoni would not enter fear lest the roman soldier should
plunder them at moonris nehushta took miriam by the hand and led her
through the rest camel to a spot a few yard from the camp
there stand with her back to the second wall she point out to her
a cliff steep but of no great height in which appear littl cave
and ridg of rock that look at from thi distanc gave to it face
a rude resembl to a human skull
see she said solemnli yonder the lord wa crucifi
miriam heard and sank to her knee in prayer as she knelt there the
grave voic of her grandfath spoke behind her bid her rise
child he said it is true true is it also that sign and wonder
happen after the death of that fals messiah and that for me and mine
he left a curs behind him which it mai well be is not done with yet i
know your faith and i have promis to let you follow it in peac yet
i beseech of you do not make prayer to your god here in public where
with malefactor he suffer as a malefactor lest other less toler
should see you and drag you to your father death
miriam bow her head and return to the camp nor at that time did
ani further word pass between them on thi matter of her religion
thenceforward howev she wa care to do noth which could bring
suspicion on her grandfath
four dai later thei came to the rich and beauti citi of tyre and
miriam saw the sea upon which she had been born hitherto she had
fanci that it water were much like those of the dead lake upon
whose shore she had dwelt so mani year but when she perceiv the
billow rush onward whitecrest to break in thunder against the
wall of island tyre she clap her hand with joi inde from that
dai to the end of her life she love the sea in all it mood and
for hour at a time would find it suffici compani perhap thi wa
becaus the seeth of it wave wa the first sound that her ear had

after my arriv execut a formal testament leav to me all hi land

made a plan to return to juda for on reason and on aloneto be near
to you most sweet miriam at the last moment i wa stai by a veri
evil chanc that bust which you made of me i had manag to save from
the shipwreck and bring safe to romenow i wish it wa at the bottom of
the sea and you shall learn why
when i came into possess of thi hous in the via agrippa which is
larg and beauti i set it in a place of honour in the antechamb
and summon that sculptor glaucu of whom i have spoken to you and
other who follow the art to come and pass judgment upon the work thei
came thei wonder and thei were silent for each of them fear lest
in prais it he should exalt some rival when howev i told them
that it wa the work of a ladi in juda although thei did not believ
me sinc all of them declar that no woman had shape that marbl
know that thei had noth to fear from so distant an artist whoever
he might be thei began to prais the work with on voic and all that
even until the wine overcam them talk of noth els also thei
continu talk on the morrow until at length the fame of the thing
came to the ear of nero who also is an artist of music and other
thing the end of it wa that on dai without warn the emperor
visit my hous and demand to see the bust which i show to him
for mani minut he examin it through the emerald with which he aid
hi sight then ask
what land had the honour to bear the geniu who wrought thi work
i answer juda a countri by the wai of which he seem to know
littl except that some fanat dwelt there who refus to worship
him he said that he would make that artist ruler of juda i repli
that the artist wa a woman whereon he answer that he care
nothingsh should still rule juda or if thi could not be manag he
would send and bring her to rome to make a statu of him to be set up in
the templ at jerusalem for the jew to worship
now i saw that i had been foolish and know well what would have
been your fate my miriam had he onc set ey on you i sigh and
answer that ala it wa imposs sinc you were dead as i prove
to him by a long stori with which i will not troubl you moreov now
that he wa sure that you were dead i show him the littl statuett
of yourself look into water which you gave me whereon he burst
into tear at the thought that such an on had depart from the earth
while it wa still curs with so mani who ar wick old and ugli
still he did not go but remain admir the bust till at length on
of hi favourit who accompani him whisper in my ear that i must
present it to the emperor i refus whereon he whisper back that if
i did not assuredli befor long it would be taken and with it all my
other good and perhap my life so sinc i must i chang my mind
and prai him to accept it whereon he embrac first the marbl and
then me and caus it to be born awai then and there leav me mad
with rage

in a certain templ where those who would pleas their emperor were

attend twice weekli in the templ that all might see how the geniu of
a great artist is abl to make a thing of immort beauti from a coars
origin of flesh and blood oh miriam i have no patienc to write of

pomp that he held at the price of plai some fool part in a templ
to satisfi the whimsi of an imperi madman
caleb too had found fortun and in these tumultu time risen
suddenli to place and power all three of them were seat upon
pinnacl but as miriam felt thei were pinnacl of snow which for
aught she knew might be melt by the veri sun of their prosper she
wa young she had littl experi yet as miriam sat there watch
the chang sea there came upon her a great sens of the instabl
of thing and an instinct knowledg of their vaniti the men who

or die i have thrown in my lot with the jew and when we have cast out
the roman i shall rule
if you cast out the roman and if you live caleb i have no faith

while there is yet time
why miriam
becaus he whom your peopl crucifi and whom i serv prophesi it
end the roman will crush you caleb hi blood li heavi upon the
head of the jew and the hour of payment is at hand
caleb thought a while and when he spoke again the note of confid
had left hi voic

so thei abod on in tyre and a week later the storm burst
for mani dai it had not been safe for jew to show themselv in the
street of the citi sinc sever who crept out about their busi
or to fetch water or provis had been set upon and beaten to death
by the mob stir up to the work by roman emissari thi time benoni
had emploi in put hi hous which wa part of an ancient fortress
that had stood mani a sieg into a state of defenc and in suppli
it with an ampl store of victual also he sent messeng to caleb
who wa said to be in command of the jewish forc at joppa tell him
of their peril becaus it wa so strong mani of the princip jew in
tyre to the number of over a hundr inde had flock into benoni
palacefortress togeth with their wive and children sinc there
wa no other place in their power in the town which could be so easili
defend lastli in the outer court and galleri were station fifti
or more faith servant and slave who understood the us of arm
thu thing remain the syrian threaten them through the gate or
from the window of high hous and no more till on night miriam wa
awaken by a dread sound of scream she sprang from her bed and
instantli nehushta wa at her side
what happen she gasp as she dress herself hastili
those syrian dog attack the jew answer nehushta on the mainland
and in the lower citi come to the roof whenc we can see what pass
and hand in hand thei ran to the seaportico and up it steep step
the dawn wa just break but look from the wall roof thei had
no need of it light sinc everywher in the dim citi below and in
paltyru on the mainland hous flare like gigant torch in their
red glare thei could see the thousand of the attack drag out
their inmat to death or thrust them back into the flame while
the night wa made horribl with the shout of the madden mob the
cri of the victim and the crackl roar of burn hous
oh christ have merci on them sob miriam
why should he ask nehushta thei slew him and reject him
now thei pai the price he prophesi mai he have merci on us hi
servant
he would not have spoken thu said miriam indignantli
nai but justic speak those who take the sword shall perish by the
sword even so have these jew done to the greek and syrian in mani of
the citiesthei who ar blind and mad now it is their hour and mayhap
our come ladi these ar no sight for you though you might do well
to learn to bear them sinc if you escap you mai see mani such
come and if you wish we will prai for these jew especi for their
children who ar innoc and for ourselv
that dai at noon most of the poorer and least protect jew of
the citi have been kill the syrian began their attack upon the
fortifi palac of benoni now it wa that the defend learn that
thei had to deal with no mere rabbl but with savag hord mani
thousand strong direct by offic skill in war inde these men
might be seen move among them and from their armour and appear
it wa easi to guess that thei were roman thi in fact wa the case
sinc gessiu floru the wick and after him other offic made it
part of their polici to send roman to stir up the syrian against the
jew and to assist them in their slaughter
first an attack wa made upon the main gate but when it wa found that
these were too strong to be taken easili the assail retreat with
a loss of a score of men shot by the defend from the wall then other
tactic were adopt for the syrian possess themselv of the
neighbour hous began to gall the garrison with arrow from the
window thu thei drove them under cover but did littl more sinc
the palac wa all of marbl with cement roof and could not be fire
with the burn shaft thei sent down upon it
so the first dai pass and dure the night no attack wa made upon
them when dawn came thei learn the reason for there opposit to
the gate wa rear a great batteringram moreov out at sea a huge
gallei wa be row in as close to their wall as the depth of water
would allow that from her deck the sailor might hurl stone and sieg
arrow by mean of catapult and thu break down their defenc and
destroi them
then it wa that the real fight began the jew post on the roof
of the hous pour arrow on the men who strove to work the ram and
kill mani of them till thei were abl to push the instrument so close
that it could no longer be command now it got to work and with three
blow of the great baulk of timber of which the ram wa fashion
burst in the gate thereon the defend head by old benoni himself
rush out and put those who serv it to the sword then befor
thei could be overcom retreat across the ditch to the inner wall
break down the wooden bridg behind them now sinc the ram wa
of no further us as it could not be drag through the ditch the
gallei that wa anchor within a hundr pace began to hurl huge
stone and arrow at them knock down the wall and kill sever
includ two women and three children
thu matter went on till noon the besieg gall them with their
arrow from the land side and the gallei batter them from the sea
while thei could do littl or noth in return have no engin
benoni call a council and set out the case which wa desper
enough it wa evid he said that thei could not hold out anoth
dai sinc at nightfal the syrian would cross the narrow protect
ditch and set up a batteringram against the inner wall therefor
thei must do on of two thingssal out and attempt to cut their wai
through and gain open countri or fight on and at the last kill the
women and children and rush out those that were left of them to be
hack down by the besieg thousand as the first plan gave no hope
sinc cumber as thei were with helpless peopl thei could not expect
to escap the citi in their despair thei decid on the second all
must die therefor thei would perish by each other hand when thi
decis wa known a wail went up from the women and the children began
to scream with fright those of them who were old enough to understand
their doom
nehushta caught miriam by the arm
come to the highest roof she said it is safe from the stone and
arrow and thenc if need be we can hurl ourselv into the water and
die an easi death
so thei went and crouch there prai for their case wa desper
suddenli nehushta touch miriam and point to the sea she look and
saw anoth gallei approach fast as oar and sail could bring her
what of it she ask heavili it will but hasten the end
nai repli nehushta thi ship is jewish she doe not fly the
eagl or a phnician banner behold the syrian vessel is get up
her anchor and prepar for fight
it wa true enough for now the oar of the syrian shot out and she
forg ahead toward the newcom but just then the current caught
her lai her broadsid on whereon the jewish ship driven by the
follow wind shift her helm and amidst a mighti shout from sea
and shore drove down upon her strike her amidship with it beak so
that she heel over then there wa more tumult and miriam close her
ey to shut out the horrid sight
when she open them again the syrian gallei had vanish onli the
water wa spot with black dot which were the head of men
gallantli done scream nehushta see she anchor and put out her
boat thei will save us yet down to the waterg
on their wai thei met benoni come to seek them and with him won the
step which were alreadi crowd with fugit the two boat of the
gallei drew near and in the bow of the first of them stood a tall and
noblelook figur
it is caleb said miriam caleb who ha come to save us
caleb it wa inde at a distanc of ten pace from the step he halt
hi boat and call aloud
benoni ladi miriam and nehushta if you still live stand forward
thei stood forward
now wade into the sea he cri again and thei wade out until
the water reach their armpit when thei were seiz on by on and
drag into the boat mani follow them and were also drag in
until that boat and the other were quit full whereon thei turn and
were row to the gallei have embark them the two boat went
back and again were fill with fugit for the most part women and
children
again thei went but as thei lade for the third time the end of
ladder appear abov the encircl wall of the step and syrian
could be seen rush out upon the portico whenc thei began to lower
themselv with rope the end of that scene wa dread the boat
were full till the water inde began to overflow their gunwal
but mani still remain upon the step or rush into the water
women scream and hold their children abov their head and men
thrust them asid in the mad rush for life the boat row off some
who could swim follow them for the rest their end wa the sword in
all seventi soul were rescu
miriam flung herself downward upon the deck of the gallei and burst
into tear cry out
oh save them can no on save them while benoni seat at her side
the water run from hi bloodstain garment moan
my hous sack my wealth taken my peopl slain by the gentil
thank god who ha save us broke in old nehushta god and caleb and
as for you master blame yourself did not we christian warn you of
what wa to come well as it ha been in the begin so it shall be
in the end
just then caleb appear befor them proud and flush with triumph
as he well might be who had done great thing and save miriam from the
sword benoni rose and cast hi arm about hi neck embrac him
behold your deliver he said to miriam and stoop down he drew
her to her feet
i thank you caleb i can sai no more she murmur but in her
heart she knew that god had deliv her and that caleb wa but hi
instrument
i am well repaid answer caleb grave for me thi ha been a
fortun dai who on it have sunk the great syrian gallei and rescu
the womanwhom i love
oath or no oath broke in benoni bethink him of what he had
promis in the past the life you save is your and if i have my wai
you shall take her and such of her heritag as remain
is thi a time to speak of such thing said miriam look up see
yonder and she point to the scene in progress on the seashor thei
drive our friend and servant into the sea and drown them and onc
more she began to weep
caleb sigh ceas from useless tear miriam we have done our best
and it is the fortun of war i dare not send out the boat again even
if the marin would listen to my command nehushta lead your ladi to
the cabin and strip her of these wet garment lest she take cold in thi
bitter wind but first benoni what is your mind
to go to my cousin mathia the high priest at jerusalem answer the
old man who ha promis to give me shelter if in these dai ani can
be found
nai broke in nehushta sail for egypt
where also thei massacr the jew by thousand till the street of
alexandria run with their blood repli caleb with sarcasm ad
well to egypt i cannot take you who must bring thi ship to those who
await her on thi side of joppa whenc i am summon to jerusalem
whither and nowher els i will go said benoni to share in my
nation death or triumph if miriam will it i have told her she can
leav me
what i have said befor i sai again repli miriam that i will
never do
then nehushta took her to the cabin and present the oar began to
beat and the great gallei stood out of the harbour till in the silenc
of the sea the scream of the victim and the shout of the victor di
awai and as night fell naught could be seen of tyre but the flare from
the burn hous of the slaughter jew
save for the sob and cri of the fugit who had lost their friend
and good the night pass in quiet sinc although it wa winter the
sea wa calm and none pursu their ship at daybreak she anchor
and come from the cabin with nehushta in the light of the rise sun
miriam saw befor her a ridg of rock over which the water pour and
beyond it a littl bai back by a desol coast nehushta also saw and
sigh
what is thi place ask miriam
ladi it is the spot where you were born on yonder flat rock lai
the vessel and there i burn her mani year ago see those blacken
timber half buri in the sand upon the beach doubtless thei ar her
rib
it is strang that i should return hither and thu nou said miriam
sigh
strang inde but mayhap there is a mean in it befor you came
in storm to grow to womanhood in peac now perchanc you come on a
peac sea to pass through womanhood in storm
both journei began with death nou
as all journei end black behind and black in front and
between them a space of sunshin and shadowthat is the law yet have
no fear for dead anna who had the gift of propheci foretold that you
should live out your life though with me whose dai ar almost done
it mai be otherwis
miriam face grew troubl
i fear neither life nor death nou who am will to meet either as
mai chanc but to part with youah that thought make me fear
i think that it will not be yet awhil said nehushta for although
i am old i still have work to do befor i lai me down and sleep come
caleb call us we ar to disembark while the weather hold
so miriam enter the boat with her grandfath and other who had
escap for the face of all of them were set toward jerusalem and
wa row to the shore over that veri rock where first she drew her
breath here thei found jew who had been watch for the come of the
gallei these men gave them a kind recept and what thei need even
more food fire and some beast of burden for their journei
when all were gather on the beach caleb join them have hand
over the gallei to anoth jew who wa to depart in her with those
that wait on the shore upon some secret mission of intercept roman
cornship when these men heard what he had done at tyre at first thei
were inclin to be angri sinc thei said that he had no author to
risk the vessel thu but afterward see that he had succeed and
with no loss of men prais him and said that it wa a veri great deed
so the gallei put about and sail awai and thei to the number of some
sixti soul began their journei to jerusalem a littl while later thei
came to a villag the same where nehushta had found the peasant and hi
wife whose inhabit at the sight of them fled think that thei
were on of the compani of robber that hunt the land in pack
like wolv plunder or murder all thei met when thei learnt the
truth howev these peopl return and heard their stori in silenc
for in those dai such tale were common enough as it came to an end
a wither sunburn woman advanc to nehushta and lai on hand
upon her arm point with the other at miriam sai
tell me friend is that the babe i suckl
then nehushta know her to be the nurs who had travel with
them to the villag of the essen greet her and answer yea
whereupon the woman cast her arm about miriam and embrac her
dai by dai she said have i thought of you littl on and now
that my ey have seen you grown so sweet and fair i care noti whose
husband is dead and who have no childrenhow soon thei close upon the
world then she bless her and call upon her angel to protect her
yonder in jerusalem and found her food and an ass to ride and so thei
part to meet no more
as it happen thei were fortun upon that journei sinc with the
arm guard of twenti men who accompani caleb thei were too strong a
parti to be attack by the wander band of thiev and although
it wa report that titu and hi armi had alreadi reach csarea from
egypt thei met no roman inde their onli enemi wa the cold which
prove so bitter that when on the second night thei camp upon the
height over against jerusalem have no tent and fear to light
fire thei were oblig to walk about till daylight to keep their blood
astir then it wa that thei saw strang and terribl thing
in the clear sky over jerusalem blaze a great comet in appear like
a sword of fire it wa true that thei had seen it befor at tyre but
never befor had it shown so bright moreov there it had not the
appear of a sword thi thei thought to be an ill omen all of them
except benoni who said that the point of the sword stretch out over
csarea presag the destruct of the roman by the hand of god
toward dawn the pale unnatur lustr of the comet fade and the
sky grew overcast and stormi at length the sun came up when to their
marvel ey the fieri cloud took strang shape
look look said miriam grasp her grandfath by the arm there
ar armi in the heaven and thei fight togeth
thei look and sure enough it seem as though two great host
were there embattl thei could discern the legion the windblown
standard the charg chariot and the squadron of impetu hors
the firmament had becom a battleground and lo it wa red as with
the blood of the fallen while the air wa full of strang and dread
sound bred perhap of wind and distant thunder that came to them
like the wail of the vanquish and the dull roar of triumphant armi
so terrifi were thei at the sight that thei crouch upon the ground
and hid their face in their hand onli old benoni stand up hi
white beard and robe stain red by the omin light cri out that
thi celesti scene foretold the destruct of the enemi of god
ay said nehushta but which enemi
the tall caleb march on hi round of the camp echo
ye which enemi
suddenli the light grew all these fantast shape melt into a red
haze which sank down till jerusalem befor them seem as though she
float in an ocean of blood and fire then a dark cloud came up and for
a while the holi hill of zion vanish utterli awai it pass the blue
sky reappear and lo the clear light stream upon her marbl palac
and cluster hous and wa reflect from the golden roof of the
templ so calm and peac did the gloriou citi look that none would
have deem inde that she wa alreadi noth but a slaughterhous
where faction fought furious and dai by dai hundr of jew
perish beneath the knive of their own brethren
caleb gave the word to break their camp and with bodi shiver in
the cold and spirit terrifi by fear thei march across the rug
hill toward the joppa gate note as thei pass into the vallei
that the countri had been desol for but littl corn sprang in the
field and that wa trodden down while of flock and herd thei saw
none reach the gate thei found it shut and there were challeng by
soldier wildlook men with feroci face of the armi of simon of
gerasa that held the lower citi
who ar you and what is your busi these ask
caleb set out hi rank and titl and as these did not seem to satisfi
them benoni explain that the rest of them were fugit from tyre
where there had been a great slaughter of the jew
fugit alwai have monei best kill them said the captain of the
gate doubtless thei ar traitor and deserv to die
caleb grew angri and command them to open ask by what right thei
dare to exclud him a high offic who had done great servic in the
war
by the right of the strong thei answer those who let in simon
have to deal with simon if you ar of the parti of john or of eleaz
go to the templ and knock upon it door and thei point mockingli
to the gleam gate abov
ha it come to thi then ask benoni that jew eat jew in
jerusalem while the roman wolv raven round the wall man we ar
of no parti although as i think my name is known and honour by all
partiesth name of benoni of tyre i demand to be led not to simon
or to john or to eleaz but to my cousin mathia the high priest
who bid us here
mathia the high priest said the captain that is anoth matter
well thi mathia let us into the citi where we have found good
quarter and good plunder so as on turn deserv anoth we mai as
well let in hi friend pass cousin of mathia the high priest with
all your compani and he open the gate
thei enter and march up the narrow street toward the templ it
wa the hour of the dai when all men should be stir and busi with
their work but lo the place wa desolatey although so crowd it
still wa desol on the pavement lai bodi of men and women slain
in some midnight outrag from behind the lattic of the window thei
caught sight of the ey of hundr peep at them but none gave them
a goodmorrow or said on singl word the silenc of death seem to
brood upon the empti thoroughfar present it wa broken by a singl
wail voic that reach their ear from so far awai that thei could
not catch it mean nearer and nearer it came till at length in
the dark and narrow street thei caught sight of a thin whitebeard
figur nake to the waist as though to show the hideou scar and
rodweal with which it back and breast were score still fester
some of them thi wa the man who utter the cri and these were the
word he spoke
a voic from the east a voic from the west a voic from the four
wind a voic against jerusalem and against the templ a voic against
the bridegroom and the bride a voic against the whole peopl woe
woe to jerusalem
now he wa upon them ye and march through them as though he saw
them not although thei shrank to on side and the other of the narrow
street to avoid the touch of thi omin unclean creatur who scarc
seem to be a man
fellow what do these word mean cri benoni in angri fear but
take no heed hi pale ey fix upon the heaven the wander
answer onli woe woe to jerusalem woe to you who come up to
jerusalem
so he pass on still utter those aw word till at length thei
lost sight of hi nake form and the sound of hi cry grew faint and
di awai
what a fear greet is thi said miriam wring her hand
ay answer nehushta but the farewel will be wors the place is
doom and all in it
onli caleb said strive to look unconcern
have no fear miriam i know the man he is mad
where doe wisdom end and mad begin ask nehushta
then thei went on toward the gate of the templ alwai through the
same bloodstain empti street
chapter xiv

thei went on toward the gate of the templ but mani a long dai wa
destin to go by er miriam reach them the entranc by which thei
were told thei must approach if thei sought speech of the high priest
wa on of the two huldah gate on the south side of the royal cloister
and thither thei came across the vallei of tyropon as thei drew near
to them of a sudden that gate which stood most to the east wa flung
wide and out of it issu a thousand or more of arm men like ant
from a broken nest who shout and wave sword rush toward
their compani as it chanc at the moment thei were in the centr
of an open space that onc had been cover with hous but wa now
cumber with hundr of blacken and totter wall for fire had

instantli assault in turn by a soldier of simon sinc all desir
to kill but none care whom thei slew she saw her grandfath roll
over and over on the ground in the grip of a man who look like a
priest she saw women and children pierc with spear then nehushta
seiz her by the hand and plung a knife into the arm of a man who
would have stai them drag her awai thei fled an arrow sang past
her ear someth struck her on the foot still thei fled whither she
knew not till at length the sound of the tumult di awai but not yet
would nehushta stop for she fear that thei might be follow so on
thei went and on meet few and heed by none till at length miriam
sank to the ground worn out with fear and flight

i cannot she answer someth ha hurt my foot see it bleed
nehushta look about her and saw that thei were outsid the second
wall in the new citi of bezetha not far from the old damascu gate for
there to their right and a littl behind them rose the great tower of
antonia beneath thi wall were rubbishheap foulsmel and cover

poultic of crush herb and ti it about the ankl with a strip of
linen even befor she had finish her task so exhaust wa miriam
that she fell fast asleep nehushta watch her a while wonder

miriam greet them on and all and befor these greet were
finish thei brought her food to eat rough but wholesom also good
wine and sweet water then while she at she heard all their stori it
seem that more than a year ago the roman march on jericho had
fallen upon their villag and put a number of them to death seiz
other as slave thereon the remnant fled to jerusalem where mani more
perish for be peaceabl folk all the faction rob and slew
them see at last that to live at larg in the citi would be to
doom themselv to extinct and yet not dare to leav it thei
sought a refug in thi underground place of which as it chanc on
of their brethren had the secret thi he had inherit from hi father
so that it wa known to no other live man
here by degre thei laid up a great store of provis of all sort
of charcoal for burn and other necessari carri into the place
also cloth bed cook utensil and even some rough furnitur
these prepar be made the fifti of them who remain remov
themselv to the vault where now thei had alreadi dwelt three month
and here so far as wa possibl continu to practis the rule of
their order miriam ask how thei kept their health in thi dark
to which thei repli that sometim thei went out by that path
which she had just follow and mingl with the peopl in the citi
return to their hole at night ithiel and hi companion were on such
a journei when thei found her also thei had anoth passag to the
upper air which thei would show her later
when miriam had finish eat dress her hurt and rest a while
thei took her to explor the wonder of the place beyond thi great
cistern that wa their common room lai more to the number of six or
seven on of the smallest of which wa given to nehushta and herself
to dwell in other were fill with store enough to last them all for
month last of all wa a cave not veri larg but deep which alwai
held sweet water doubtless there wa a spring at the bottom of it
which when the other rainf tank grew dry still kept it suppli
from thi cistern that had been us for gener after the other
were abandon a littl stair ran upward worn smooth by the feet of
folk long dead who had come hither to draw water
where doe it lead ask miriam
to the ruin tower abov answer ithiel nai anoth time i will
show you now your place is made readi for you go let nehushta bath
your foot and sleep for you must need it sore
so miriam went and laid herself down to rest in the littl cement
vault which wa to be her home for four long month and be worn
out notwithstand the suffer she had pass and her fear for
her grandfath slept there as soundli as ever she had done in her
windswept chamber at the palac of tyre or in her hous at the villag
of the essen
when she awok and saw the dark all about her she thought that it
must be night then rememb that in thi place it wa alwai night
call to nehushta who uncov the littl lamp that burn in a
corner of the vault and went out to return present with the new
that accord to the essen it wa dai so she rose and put on her
robe and thei pass togeth into the great chamber here thei found
the essen at prayer and make their rever to the sun which thei
could not see after which thei at their morn meal now miriam spoke
to ithiel tell him of her troubl about her grandfath who if he
himself still live would think that she wa dead
on thing is certain repli her greatuncl that you shall not go
out to seek him nor must you tell him of your hidingplac sinc soon
or late thi might mean that all of us would be destroi if onli for
the sake of the food which we have hoard
miriam ask if she could not send a messag he answer
no sinc none would dare to take it in the end howev after she
had plead with him long and earnestli it wa agre that she should
write the word i am safe and well but in a place that i must not
tell you of and sign her name upon a piec of parchment thi letter
ithiel who purpos to creep out into the citi that even disguis
as a beggar to seek for tide said he would take and if might
be bribe some soldier to deliv it to benoni at the hous of the high
priest if he were there
so miriam wrote the letter and at nightfal ithiel and anoth brother
depart take it with them
on the follow morn thei return safe but with a dread tale
of the slaughter in the citi and in the templ court where the mad
faction still fought furious
your tide my uncl said miriam rise to meet him doe he
still live
be of good comfort he answer benoni reach the hous of mathia
in safeti and caleb also and now thei ar shelter within the templ
wall thi much i had from on of the high priest guard who for
the price of a piec of gold i gave him swore that he would deliv the
letter without fail but child i will take no more for that soldier
ei me curious and said it wa scarc safe for beggar to carri
gold
miriam thank him for hi good and hi new sai that thei
lift a weight from her heart
i have other tide that mai perhap make it lighter still went on
the old man look at her sidewai titu with a mighti host draw
near to jerusalem from csarea
there is no joi in that tale repli miriam for it mean that the
holi citi will be besieg and taken
nai but among that host is on who if all the stori ar true and
again he glanc at her face would rather take you than the citi
who she said press her hand against her heart and turn redder
than the lamplight
on of titu prefect of hors the nobl roman marcu whom in
byegon dai you knew by the bank of jordan
now the red blood fled back to miriam heart and she turn so faint
that had not the wall been near at hand she would have fallen
marcu she said well he swore that he would come yet it will
bring him littl nearer me and she turn and sought her chamber
so marcu had come sinc he sent the letter and the ring that wa upon
her hand and the pearl which were about her throat she had heard no
more of him twice she had written and forward the write by the
most trusti messeng whom she could find but whether thei reach him
she did not know for more than two year the silenc between them had
been that of death till inde at time she thought that he must be
dead and now he wa come back a command in the armi of titu who
march to punish the rebelli jew would she ever see him again
miriam could not tell yet she knelt and prai from her pure heart that
if it were onc onli she might speak with him face to face inde
it wa thi hope of meet that more than ani other support her
through all those dread dai
a week went by and although the hurt to her foot had heal like some
flower in the dark miriam droop and languish in those gloomi vault
twice she prai her uncl to be allow to creep to the mouth of the
hole behind the ridg of rock there to breath the fresh air and
see the bless sky but thi he would not suffer the thing wa
too danger he said for although none knew the secret of their
hidingplac alreadi two or three fugit had found their wai into
the quarri by other entranc and these it wa veri difficult to pass
unseen
so be it answer miriam and crept back to her cell
nehushta look after her anxious then said
if she cannot have air i think that she will soon die is there no
wai
on answer ithiel but i fear to take it the staircas from the
spring lead to an ancient tower that i am told onc wa a palac
of the king but now for these mani year ha been desert for it
entranc is brick up lest thiev should make it their home none can
come into that tower nor is it us for purpos of war not stand
upon ani wall and there she might sit at peac and see the sun yet i
fear to let her do so
it must be risk answer nehushta take me to visit thi place
so ithiel led her to the cistern and from the cistern up a flight of
step to a littl vault chamber into which thei enter through
a stone trapdoor made of the same substanc as the pave of the
chamber so that when it wa close none would guess that there wa
a passag beneath from thi old storeroom for such it doubtless wa
ran more step end to all appear in a blank wall come to
it ithiel thrust a piec of flat iron a foot or more in length into a
crack in thi wall lift some stone latch within and push whereon
a block of masonri of someth more than the height and width of a man
and quit a yard in thick swung outward nehushta pass through
the apertur follow by ithiel
see he said loos hi hold of the stone which without nois
instantli close so that behind them there appear to be noth but a
wall it is well hung is it not and to come hither without thi iron
would be danger here is the crack where it must be set to lift the
latch within
whoever live here guard their food and water well answer
nehushta
then ithiel show her the place it wa a massiv tower of a squar
of about forti feet whereof the onli doorwai as he told her had been
brick up mani year befor to keep the thiev and vagabond from
shelter there in height it must have measur nearli a hundr
feet and it roof had long ago rot awai the staircas which wa
of stone still remain howev lead to four galleri also
of stone perhap onc there were floor as well but if so these had
vanish onli the stone galleri and their balustrad remain
ithiel led nehushta up the stair which though narrow wa safe and
easi rest at each stori at length thei came to that galleri which
project from it side within ten feet of the top of the tower and
saw jerusalem and the countri round spread like a map beneath then
as it wa sunset thei return at the foot of the stair ithiel gave
nehushta the piec of iron and show her how to lift the secret latch
and pull upon the block of hewn stone that wa a door so that it open
to swing to again behind them
next morn befor it wa dawn in the world abov miriam arous
nehushta she had been promis that thi dai she should be taken up the
old tower and so great wa her long for the scent of the free air
and the sight of the blue sky that she had scarc close her ey thi
night
have patienc ladi said nehushta have patienc we cannot start
until the essen have finish their prayer to the sun which down in
thi black hole thei worship more earnestli than ever
so miriam wait though she would eat noth till at length ithiel
came and led them past the cistern up the stair to the store or
treasur chamber where the trapdoor stood wide sinc except in case
of some danger thei had no need to shut it next thei reach the door
of solid stone which ithiel show her how to open and enter the base
of the massiv build there far abov her miriam saw the sky again
red from the light of morn and at the sight of it clap her hand
and call aloud
hush said ithiel these wall ar thick yet it is not safe to rais
a voic of joi in jerusalem that home of a thousand miseri lest
perchanc some should hear it through a cleft in the masonri and caus
search to be made for the singer now if you will follow me
so thei went up and up till at last thei reach the topmost galleri
where the wall wa pierc with loophol and overhang platform
whenc stone and other missil could be hurl upon an attack
forc miriam look out eagerli walk round the galleri from
apertur to apertur
to the south lai the marbl court and glitter build of the
templ whenc although men fought daili in them the smoke of
sacrific still curl up to heaven behind these were the upper and the
lower citi crowd with thousand of hous pack everi on of them
with human be who had fled hither for refug or notwithstand
the danger of the time to celebr the passov to the east wa the
rug vallei of jehoshaphat and beyond it the mount of oliv green
with tree soon to be laid low by the roman to the north the new citi
of bezetha border by the third wall and the rocki land beyond not
far awai also but somewhat in front of them and to the left rose the
mighti tower of antonia now on of the stronghold of john of gischala
and the zealot while also to the west across the width of the citi
were the tower of hippicu phasl and mariamn back by the splendid
palac of herod besid these were wall fortress gate and palac
without number so intric and mani that the ey could scarc follow
or count them and between the numberless narrow street of jerusalem
these and mani other thing ithiel point out to miriam who listen
eagerli till he weari of the task then thei look downward through
the overhang platform of stone to the larg marketplac beneath and
to the front and upon the roof of the hous mostli of the humbler
sort that were built behind almost up to the wall of the old tower
whereon mani peopl were gather as though for safeti eat their
morn meal talk anxious togeth and even prai
whilst thei were thu engag nehushta touch miriam and point
to the road which ran from the vallei of thorn on the northeast
she look and saw a great cloud of dust that advanc swiftli and
present through the dust the sheen of spear and armour
the roman said nehushta quietli
she wa not the onli on who had caught sight of them for suddenli the
battlement of everi wall and tower the roof of everi lofti hous the
upper court of the templ and all high place becam crowd with
thousand and ten of thousand of head each of them stare toward
that advanc dust in silenc thei stare as though their multitud
were stricken dumb till present from far below out of the maze of
wind street float the wail of a singl voic
woe woe to jerusalem said the voic woe woe to the citi and the
templ
thei shudder and as it seem to them all the listen thousand
within reach of that mourn cry shudder also
ay repeat ithiel woe to jerusalem for yonder come her doom
now on the more rocki ground the dust grew thinner and through it thei
could distinguish the divis of the mighti armi of destroy first
came thousand of syrian alli and cloud of scout and archer who
search the countri far and wide next appear the roadmak and the
campsett the beast of burden with the gener baggag and it
great escort follow by titu himself hi bodyguard and offic
by pikemen and by horsemen then were seen strang and terriblelook
engin of war beyond count and with them the tribun and the
captain of cohort and their guard who preced the engin and that
abomin of desol the roman eagl surround by band of
trumpet who from time to time utter their loud defiant note
after them march the vast armi in rank six deep divid into legion
and follow by their campbear and squadron of hors lastli were
seen the pack of baggag and mercenari by thousand and ten of
thousand on the hill of saul the great host halt and began to
encamp an hour later a band of horsemen five or six hundr strong
emerg out of thi camp and march along the straight road to
jerusalem
it is titu himself said ithiel see the imperi standard goe
befor him
on thei came till from their lofti perch miriam who wa keensight
could see their separ armour and tell the colour of their hors
eagerli she search them with her ey for well she guess that
marcu would be on of those who accompani hi gener upon thi
servic that plume warrior might be he or that with the purpl cloak
or that who gallop out from near by the standard on an errand he wa
there she wa sure he wa there and yet thei were as far apart as when
the great sea roll between them
now as thei reconnoitr and were pass the tower of women of a
sudden the gate open and from allei and hous where thei had lain
in ambush were pour out thousand of jew right through the thin line
of horsemen thei pierc utter savag cri then doubl back upon
the sever end mani were cut down miriam could see them fall from
their hors the imperi standard sank then rose and sank again to
rise onc more now dust hid the combat and she thought that all the
roman must be slain but no for present thei began to appear beyond
the dust ride back by the wai thei had come though fewer than thei
were thei had charg through the multitud of jew and escap but
who had escap and who were left behind ah that she could not tell
and it wa with a sick and anxiou heart that miriam descend the step
of the tower into the dark of the cave
chapter xv
what pass in the tower
nearli four month had gone by perhap dure the whole histori of the
world there never ha been and never will be more cruel suffer than
wa endur by the inhabit of jerusalem dure that period or
rather by the survivor of the nation of the jew who were crowd
togeth within it wall forget their internecin quarrel in the
face of overwhelm danger too late the faction unit and fought
against the common foe with a feroc that ha been seldom equal
thei left noth undon which desper men could do again and again
thei salli forth against the roman slaughter thousand of them
thei captur their batteringram and catapult thei undermin the
great wooden tower which titu erect against their wall and burnt
them with vari success thei made salli upon salli titu took the
third wall and the new citi of bezetha he took the second wall and
pull it down then he sent josephu the historian to persuad the
jew to surrend but hi countrymen curs and stone him and the war
went on
at length as it seem to be imposs to carri the place by assault
titu adopt a surer and more terribl plan enclos the first
unconqu wall the templ and the fortress by anoth wall of hi
own make he sat down and wait for starvat to do it work then
came the famin at the begin befor the madden devilinspir
faction began to destroi each other and to prei upon the peac
peopl jerusalem wa ampli provis but each parti squander the
store that were within it reach and whenev thei could do so burnt
those of their rival so that the food which might have suppli the
whole citi for month vanish quickli in orgi of wanton wast and
destruct now all or almost all wa gone and by ten and hundr
of thousand the peopl starv
those who ar curiou about such matter those who desir to know how
much human be can endur and of what savageri thei can be capabl
when hunger drive them mai find these detail set out in the page of
josephu the renegad jewish historian it serv no good purpos and
will not help our stori to repeat them inde for the most part thei
ar too terribl to be repeat histori doe not record and the mind
of man cannot invent a cruelti which wa not practis by the famish
jew upon other jew suspect of the crime of have hidden food
to feed themselv or their famili now the fear propheci wa
fulfil and it came about that mother devour their own infant
and children snatch the last morsel of bread from the lip of their
dy parent if these thing were done between those who were of
on blood what dread torment wa there that wa not practis by
stranger upon stranger the citi went mad beneath the weight of it
abomin and obscen miseri thousand perish everi dai and everi
night thousand more escap or attempt to escap to the roman
who caught the poor wretch and crucifi them beneath the wall till
there wa no more wood of which to make the cross and no more ground
whereon to stand them
all these thing and mani other miriam saw from her place of outlook
in the galleri of the desert tower she saw the peopl ly dead
by hundr in the street beneath she saw the robber hale them from
their hous and tortur them to discov the hidingplac of the food
which thei were suppos to have hidden and when thei fail put them
to the sword she saw the vallei of the kidron and the lower slope of
the mount of oliv cover with captiv jew writh on their cross
there to die as the messiah whom thei had reject di she saw the
furiou attack the yet more furiou salli and the dread daili
slaughter till at length her heart grew so sick within her that
although she still took refug in the ruin tower to escap the gloom
beneath miriam would spend whole hour ly on her face her finger
thrust into her ear that she might shut out the sight and sound of
thi unutter woe
meanwhil the essen who still had store of food ventur forth but
rare lest the good condit of their bodi although their face
were white as death from dwell in the dark should tempt the
starv hord to seiz and tortur them in the hope of discov
the hidingplac of their nutriment inde to sever of the brethren
thi happen but in obedi to their oath as will be seen in the
instanc of the past presid theophiluswho went out and wa no more
heard ofthei endur all and di without a murmur have betrai
noth still notwithstand the danger driven to it by utter
weari of their confin in the dark and by the desir of
obtain new from time to time on of them would creep forth at night
to return again befor daybreak from these men miriam heard that
after the murder of the high priest mathia and hi son togeth with
sixteen of the sanhedrim on a charg of correspond with the roman
her grandfath benoni had been elect to that bodi in which he
exercis much influenc and caus mani to be put to death who were
accus of treason or of favour the roman caus caleb also wa in
the templ and foremost in everi fight he wa said to have sworn an
oath that he would slai the prefect of hors marcu with whom he had
an ancient quarrel or be slain himself it wa told inde that thei
had met onc alreadi and struck some blow at each other befor thei
were separ by an accid of war
the begin of august came at length and the wretch citi in
addit to it other miseri pant in the heat of a scorch summer
sun and wa poison by the stench from the dead bodi that fill the
street and were hurl in thousand from the wall now the roman
had set up their batter engin at the veri gate of the templ and
slowli but sure were win their wai into it outer court
on a certain night about an hour befor the dawn miriam woke nehushta
tell her that she wa stifl there in those vault and must ascend
the tower nehushta said that it wa folli whereon miriam answer that
she would go alon thi she would not suffer her to do so togeth
thei pass up the stair accord to custom and have gain the
base of the tower through the swing door of stone climb the step
that ran in the thick of the wall till thei reach the topmost
galleri here thei sat fan by the faint night wind and watch the
fire of the roman stretch far and wide around the wall and even
among the ruin of the hous almost beneath them sinc that part of
the citi wa taken
present the dawn broke a splendid fear dawn it wa as though the
angel of the daybreak had dip hi wing into a sea of blood and dash
it against the brow of night still crown with her fade star of a
sudden the heaven were fill with blot and thread of flame colour
lattic against the pale background of the twilight sky miriam watch
it with a kind of raptur let it glori and it peac sink into
her troubl soul while from below aros the sound of awaken camp
make readi for the daili battl soon a rai of burn light cast
like a spear from the crest of the mount of oliv across the vallei of
jehoshaphat struck full upon the goldroof templ and it court at
it come as though at a signal the northern gate were thrown wide
and through them pour a flood of gaunt and savag warrior thei came
on in thousand utter fierc warcri some picket of roman tri
to stai their rush in a minut thei were overcom and destroi now
thei were surg round the feet of a great wooden tower fill with
archer here the fight wa desper for the soldier of titu rush
up by compani to defend their engin but thei could not drive back
that onset and present the tower wa on fire and in a last mad
effort to save their live it defend were cast themselv
headlong from the lofti platform with shout of triumph the jew rush
through the breach in the second wall and leav what remain of
the castl of antonia on the left pour down into the maze of street
and ruin hous that lai immedi behind the old tower whenc
miriam watch
in front of thi build which the roman had never attempt to
enter sinc for militari purpos it wa useless to them lai the open
space onc no doubt part of it garden but of late year us as a
cattl market and a place where young men exercis themselv in arm
border the wast on it further side were strong fortif the
camp ground of the twelfth and fifteenth legion across thi open
space those who remain of the roman fled back toward their outer
line follow by swarm of furiou jew thei gain them such as
were not overtaken but the jew who pursu were met with so fierc
a charg deliv by the fresh troop behind the defenc that
thei were in turn swept back and took refug among the ruin hous
suddenli miriam attent becam concentr upon the mount offic
who led thi charg a gallantlook man clad in splendid armour
whose clear ring voic as he utter the word of command had
caught her ear even through the tumult and the shout the roman
onslaught have reach it limit began to fall back again like the
water from an exhaust wave upon a slope of sand at the moment the
jew were in no condit to press the enemi retreat so that the
mount offic who withdrew last of all had time to turn hi hors
and heedless of the arrow that sang about him to studi the ground
now strewn with the wound and the dead present he look up at the
desert tower as though wonder whether he could make us of it and
miriam saw hi face it wa marcu grown older more thought also
and alter somewhat by a short curl beard but still marcu and no
other
look look she said
nehushta nod ye it is he i thought so from the first and now
have seen him ladi shall we be go
go said miriam wherefor
becaus on armi or the other mai chanc to think that thi build
would be us to them and break open the walledup door also thei
might explor thi staircas and then
and then answer miriam quietli we should be taken what of it
if the jew find us we ar of their parti if the romanswel i do not
greatli fear the roman
you mean you do not fear on roman but who know but that he mai
present lie dead
oh sai it not answer miriam press her hand upon her heart
nai safe or unsaf i will see thi fight out look yonder is
caleby caleb himself shout to the jew how fierc is hi face
like that of a hyena in a snare nai now i will not gogo you and
leav me in peac to watch the end
sinc you ar too heavi and strong for my old arm to carri down those
steep step so be it answer nehushta calmli after all we have
food with us and our angel can guard us as well on the top of a tower
as in those dirti cistern also thi frai is worth the watch
as she spoke the roman have reform led by the prefect marcu and
other offic advanc from their entrench to be met halfwai by
the jew now reinforc from the templ among whom wa caleb there
in the open space thei fought hand to hand for neither forc would
yield an inch miriam watch through the stone bar from abov had
ey for onli two of all that multitud of menmarcu whom she love
and caleb whom she fear marcu wa attack by a jew who stab
hi hors to be instantli stab himself by a roman who came to the
rescu of hi command after thi he fought on foot caleb kill
first on soldier than anoth watch him miriam grew awar that he
wa cut hi wai toward some point and that the point wa marcu
thi marcu seem to know at least he also strove to cut hi wai
toward caleb nearer and nearer thei came till at length thei met and
began to rain blow upon each other but not for long for just then a
charg of some roman horsemen separ them after thi both parti
retir to their line take their wound with them
thu with paus sometim of two or three hour the fight went on
from morn to noon and from noon to sunset dure the latter part
of the time the roman made no more attack but were content with
defend themselv while thei await reinforc from without the
citi or perhap the result of some counterattack in anoth part
thu the advantag rest or seem to rest with the jew who held
all the ruin hous and swept the open space with their arrow now
it wa that nehushta fear were justifi for have a littl leisur
the jew took a beam of wood and batter in the walledup doorwai of
the tower
look said nehushta point down
oh nou miriam answer i wa wrong i have run you into danger
but inde i could not go what shall we do now
sit quiet until thei come to take us said nehushta grimli and then
if thei give us time explain as best we mai
as it chanc howev the jew did not come sinc thei fear that
if thei mount the stair some sudden rush of roman might trap such
of them as were within befor thei had time to descend again onli thei
made us of the base of the tower to shelter those of their wound
whose hurt were so desper that thei dare not move them
now the fight have ceas for a while the soldier of both side
amus themselv with shout taunt and insult at each other or
challeng to singl combat present caleb step forward from the
shelter of a wall and call out that if the prefect marcu would meet
him alon in the open space he had someth to sai which he would be
glad to hear thereupon marcu step out from hi defenc where
sever of hi offic seem to be strive to detain him answer
i will come and walk to the centr of the market where he wa met
by caleb
here the two of them spoke togeth alon but of what thei said miriam
and nehushta watch them from abov could catch no word
oh will thei fight said miriam
it seem like sinc each of them ha sworn to slai the other
answer nehushta
while she spoke marcu shake hi head as though to declin some
propos and point to the men of hi command who stood up watch
him turn to walk back to hi own line follow by caleb who
shout out that he wa a coward and did not dare to stand alon befor
him at thi insult marcu winc then went on again doubtless becaus
he thought it hi duti to rejoin hi compani whereon caleb draw
hi sword struck him with the flat of it across the back now the jew
laugh while the roman utter a shout of rage at the intoler
affront offer to their command as for marcu he wheel round
sword in hand and flew straight at caleb throat
but it wa for thi that the jew had been wait sinc he knew that no
roman and least of all marcu would submit to the indign of such a
blow as hi adversari came on made almost blind with furi he leapt
to on side lightli as a lion leap and with all the forc of hi long
sinewi arm brought down hi heavi sword upon the head of marcu the
helm wa good or the skull beneath must have been split in two by that
blow which as it wa shore through it and bit deepli into the bone
beneath the shock marcu stagger threw hi arm wide and let fall
hi sword with a shout caleb sprang at him to make an end of him but
befor he could strike the roman seem to recov himself and know
that hi weapon wa gone did the onli thing he could rush straight
at hi foe caleb sword fell on hi shoulder but the temper mail
withstood it and next instant marcu had grip him in hi arm down
thei came togeth to the earth roll over each other the jew try
to stab the roman the roman to choke the jew with hi bare hand then
from the roman line rose a cry of rescu and from the jew a cry of
take him
out pour the combat from either side of the marketplac by
hundr and by thousand and there in it centr round the struggl
form of caleb and of marcu began the fiercest fight of all that dai
where men stood there thei fell for none would give back sinc the
roman outnumb though thei were prefer to die rather than leav
a wound and belov captain a prison in the hand of cruel enemi
while the jew knew too well the valu of such a prize to let it escap
them easili so great wa the slaughter that present marcu and caleb
were hidden beneath the bodi of the fallen more and more jew rush
into the frai but still the roman push onward with steadi valour
fight shoulder to shoulder and shield to shield
then of a sudden with a savag yell a fresh bodi of jew three or
four hundr strong appear at the west end of the marketplac and
charg upon the roman take them in flank the offic in command
saw hi danger and know that it wa better that hi captain should
die than that the whole compani should be destroi and the arm of
csar suffer a grave defeat gave order for a retir steadili
as though thei were on parad and drag with them those of their
wound comrad who could not walk the legionari fell back heedless
of the storm of spear and arrow reach their own line befor the
outflank bodi of jew could get among them then see that there
wa noth more to be gain sinc to attempt to storm the roman work
wa hopeless the victori jew also retreat thi time not to the
hous behind the tower but onli to the old market wall thirti or forti
pace in front of it which thei proceed to hold and strengthen in the
fade light see that thei were lost such of the wound roman as
remain upon the field commit suicid prefer to fall upon their
own spear than into the hand of the jew to be tortur and crucifi
also for thi deed thei had anoth reason sinc it wa the decre of
titu that ani soldier who wa taken live should be publicli disgrac
by name and expel from the rank of the legion and if recaptur
in addit suffer death or banish
gladli would marcu have follow their exampl and therebythough he
knew it notsav himself much miseri and shame in the futur but he
had neither time nor weapon moreov so weak wa he with struggl
and the loss of blood that even as he and caleb were drag by savag
hand from among the fallen he faint at first thei thought that he
wa dead but on of the jew who chanc to be a physician by trade
declar that thi wa not so and that if he were left quiet for a
while he would come to himself again therefor as thei desir to
preserv thi prefect aliv either to be held as an hostag or to be
execut in sight of the armi of titu thei brought him into the old
tower clear it of their own wound except such of them as had
alreadi breath their last here thei set a guard over him though of
thi there seem to be littl need and went under the command of the
victori caleb to assist in strengthen the marketwal
all of these thing miriam watch from abov in such an agoni of fear
and doubt that at time she thought that she would die she saw her
lover and caleb fall lock in each other arm she saw the hideou
frai that rage around them she saw them drag from the heap of
slain and at the end of it all by the last light of dai saw marcu
live or dead she knew not which born into the tower and there laid
upon the ground
take comfort whisper nehushta piti her dread grief the
lord marcu live if he were dead thei would have strip him and
left hi bodi with the other he live and thei purpos to hold him
captiv els thei would have suffer caleb to put hi sword through
him as you note he wish to do so soon as he found hi feet
captiv answer miriam that mean that he will be crucifi like
the other whom we saw yesterdai upon the templ wall
nehushta shrug her shoulder
it mai be so she said unless he find mean to destroi himself
ori save
save how can he be save then in her woe the poor girl fell upon
her knee clasp her hand and murmur oh jesu christ whom i
serv teach me how to save marcu oh jesu i love him although he
is not a christian love him also becaus i love him and teach me how
to save him or if on must die take my life for hi oh take my life
for hi
ceas said nehushta for i think i hear an answer to your prayer
look now he is laid just where the stair start and not six feet from
the stone door that lead down into the cistern except for some dead
men the tower is empti also the two sentri stand outsid the breach
in the brickwork with which it wa wall up becaus there thei find
more light and their prison is unarm and helpless and cannot
attempt escap now if the roman live and can stand why should we not
open that door and thrust him through it
but the jew might see us and discov the secret of the hidingplac
of the essen whom thei would kill becaus thei have hidden food
onc we were the other side of the door thei could never come at them
even if thei have time to try answer nehushta befor ever thei
could burst the door the stone trap beneath can be close and the roof
of the stair that lead to it let down by knock awai the prop and
flood in such a fashion that a week of labour would not clear it out
again oh have no fear the essen know and have guard against thi
danger
miriam threw her arm about the neck of nehushta and kiss her
we will try nou we will try she whisper and if we fail why
then we can die with him
to you that prospect mai be pleas but i have no desir to die with
the lord marcu answer nehushta drili inde although i like him
well were it not for your sake i should leav him to hi chanc nai
do not answer or give wai to too much hope rememb perhap he is
dead as he seem to be
ye ye said miriam wildli we must find out shall we go now
ay while there is still a littl light for these step ar breakneck
in the dark no do you follow me
so on thei glide down the ancient darksom stairwai where owl hoot
and bat flitter in their face now thei were at the last flight
which descend to a littl recess set at right angl to the step and
flush with the floor of the basement for onc the door of the stairwai
had open here thu a person stand on the last stair could not be
seen by ani in the tower thei reach the step and halt then veri
stealthili nehushta went on to her hand and knee and thrust her head
forward so that she could look into the base of the tower it wa dark
as the grave onli a faint gleam of starlight reflect from hi armour
show where marcu lai so close that she could touch him with her
hand also almost opposit to her the gloom wa reliev by a patch
of faint grei light here it wa that the wall had been broken in for
nehushta could see the shadow of the sentri cross and recross
befor the rag open
she leant yet lower toward marcu and listen he wa not dead for he
breath more she heard him stir hi hand and thought that she could
see it move upward toward hi wound head then she drew back
ladi she whisper he live and i think he is awak now you must
do the rest as your wit mai teach you how for if i speak to him he will
be frighten but your voic he mai rememb if he ha hi sens
at these word all her doubt and fear seem to vanish from miriam
heart her hand grew steadi and her brain clear for natur told her
that if she wish to save her lover she would need both clear brain and
steadi hand the timid loverack girl wa transform into a woman
of iron will and purpos in her turn she kneel and crept a littl
forward from the stair so that her face hung over the face of marcu
then she spoke in a soft whisper
marcu awak and listen marcu but i prai of you do not stir or make
a nois i am miriam whom onc you knew
at thi name the dim form beneath her seem to quiver and the lip
mutter now i know that i am dead well it is better than i hope
for speak on sweet shade of miriam
nai marcu you ar not dead you ar onli wound and i am not a
spirit i am a woman that woman whom onc you knew down by the bank of
jordan i have come to save you i and nehushta if you will obei what i
tell you and if you have the strength to stand we can guid you into
a secret place where the essen ar hidden who for my sake will take
care of you until you ar abl to return to the roman if you do not
escap i fear that the jew will crucifi you
by bacchu so do i said the whisper beneath and that will be wors
than be beaten by caleb but thi is a dream i know it is a dream
if it were miriam i should see her or be abl to touch her it is but a
dream of miriam let me dream on and he turn hi head
miriam thought for a moment time wa short and it wa necessari to make
him understand well it wa not difficult slowli she bent a littl
lower and press her lip upon hi
marcu she went on i kiss you now to show you that i am no dream
and how need it is that you should be awaken had i light i could
prove to you that i am miriam by your ring which is upon my finger and
your pearl which ar about my neck
ceas he answer most belov i wa weak and wander now i
know that thi is not a dream and i thank caleb who ha brought us
togeth again against hi wish i think sai what must i do

perhap i am not sure i will try
nai wait nehushta come hither you ar stronger than i now while i
unlatch the secret door do you lift him up be swift i hear the guard

nehushta glide forward and knelt by the wound man place her arm

chapter xvi
the sanhedrim
the jewish soldier hale miriam roughli through dark and tortuou
street border by burntout hous and up steep stone slope deep
with the dbri of the sieg inde thei had need to hasten for lit
with the lamp of flame dwell behind them flow the tide of war
the roman driven back from thi part of the citi by that dai furiou
salli under cover of the night were reoccupi in overwhelm
strength the ground that thei had lost forc the jew befor them and
strive to cut them off from their stronghold in the templ and that
part of the upper citi which thei still held
the parti of jew who had miriam in their charg were return to the
templ enclosur which thei could not reach from the north or east
becaus the outer court and cloister of the holi hous were alreadi in
possess of the roman so it happen that thei were oblig to make
their wai round by the upper citi a long and tediou journei onc
dure that night thei were driven to cover until a great compani of
roman had march past caleb wish to attack them but the other
captain said that thei were too few and weari so thei lai hid for
nearli three hour then went on again after thi there were other
delai at gate still in the hand of their own peopl which on by on
were unbolt to them thu it wa not far from daylight when at length
thei pass over a narrow bridg that span some ravin and through
massiv door into a vast dim place which as miriam gather from the
talk of her captor wa the inner enclosur of the templ here at the
command of that captain who had order her to be slain she wa thrust
into a small cell in on of the cloister then the men in charg of her
lock the door and went awai
sink exhaust to the floor miriam tri to sleep but could not
for her brain seem to be on fire whenev she shut her ey there
sprang up befor them vision of some dread scene which she had
wit while in her ear echo now the shout of the victor now
the piti cry of the dy and now again the voic of the wound
marcu call her most belov wa thi inde so she wonder
wa it possibl that he had not forgotten her dure those year of
separ when there must have been so mani love ladi strive to
win him the rich highplac roman lord to be their lover or their
husband she did not know she could not tell perhap in such a
plight he would have call ani woman who came to save him hi most
belov ye even old nehushta and even then and there she smile a
littl at the thought yet hi voic rang true and he had sent her the
ring the pearl and the letter that letter which although she knew
everi word of it she still carri hidden in the bosom of her robe oh
she believ that he did love her and believ rejoic with all her
heart that it had pleas god to allow her to save hi life even at the
cost of her own she had forgotten there wa hi woundh might die of
it nai sure he would not die for her sake the essen who knew him
would treat him well and thei were skil healer also what better
nurs than nehushta could be found ah poor nou how she would griev
over her what sorrow must have taken hold of her when she heard the
rock door shut and found that her nursl wa cut off and captur by
the jew
happi inde wa it for miriam that she could not wit what had
chanc at the further side of that block of stone that she could not
see nehushta beat at it with her hand and strive to thrust her
thin finger to the latch which she had no instrument to lift until the
bone were strip of skin and flesh that she could not hear marcu
come to himself again but unabl to rise from off hi knee curs
and rave with agoni at her loss and becaus she the tender ladi whom
he love for hi sake had fallen into the hand of the relentless
jew ye that she could not hear him curs and rave in hi utter
helpless till at length the brain gave in hi shatter head and
he fell into a fever mad that for mani week wa unpierc by ani
light of reason or of memori all thi at least wa spare to her
well the deed wa done and she must pai the price for without a doubt
thei would kill her as thei had a right to do who had save a roman
gener from their clutch or if thei did not caleb would caleb
whose bitter jealousi as her instinct told her had turn hi love to
hate never would he let her live to fall perchanc as hi share of
the templ spoil into the hand of the roman rival who had escap him
it wa not too great a price becaus of the birth doom laid upon her
even if he sought it and fortun brought them back togeth again she
could never be a wife to marcu and for the rest she wa weari sick
with the sight and sound of slaughter and with the miseri that in these
latter dai as her lord had prophesi wa come upon the citi that
reject him and the peopl who had slain him their messiah miriam
wish to die to pass to that home of perfect and etern peac in
which she believ where mayhap it might be given to her in reward of
her suffer to watch from afar over the soul of marcu and to make
readi an abod for it to dwell in through all the ag of infin the
thought pleas her and lift hi ring she press it to her lip
which that veri night had been press upon hi lip then drew it off
and hid it in her hair she wish to keep that ring until the end if
so she might as for the pearl she could not hide them and though she
love them as hi giftwel thei must go to the hand of the spoiler
and to the neck of other women who would never know their tale
thi done miriam rose to her knee and began to prai with the vivid
simpl faith that wa given to the first children of the church she
prai for marcu that he might recov and not forget her and that
the light of truth might shine upon him for nehushta that her sorrow
might be sooth for herself that her end might be merci and her
awaken happi for caleb that hi heart might be turn for the dead
and dy that their sin might be forgiven for the littl children
that the lord of piti would have piti on their suffer for the
peopl of the jew that he would lift the rod of hi wrath from off
them ye and even for the roman though for these poor maid she
knew not what petit to put up
her prayer finish onc more miriam strove to sleep and doze a
littl to be arous by a curiou sound of feebl sigh which seem
to come from the further side of the cell by now the dawn wa stream
through the stone lattic work abov the doorwai and in it faint light
miriam saw the outlin of a figur with snowi hair and beard wrap
in a filthi robe that had onc been white at first she thought that
thi figur must be a corps thrust here out of the wai of the live
it wa so stirless but corps do not sigh as thi man seem to do
who could he be she wonder a prison like herself left to die as
perhap she would be left to die the light grew a littl sure there
wa someth familiar about the shape of that white head she crept
nearer think that she might be abl to help thi old man who wa
so sick and suffer now she could see hi face and the hand that lai
upon hi breast thei were those of a live skeleton for the bone
stood out and over them the yellow skin wa drawn like shrivel
parchment onli the deep sunk ey still shone round and bright oh she
knew the face it wa that of theophilu the essen a past presid
of the order inde who had been her friend from earliest childhood and
the master who taught her languag in those faroff happi year which
she spent in the villag by the dead sea thi theophilu she had found
dwell with the essen in their cavern home and none of them had
welcom her more warmli some ten dai ago against the advic of
ithiel and other he had insist on creep out to take the air and
gather new in the citi then he wa a stout and hale old man although
palefac from dwell in the dark from that journei he had not
return some said that he had fled to the countri other that he had
gone over to the roman and yet other that he had been slain by some
of simon men now she found him thu
miriam came and bent over him
master she said what ail you how came you here
he turn hi hollow vacant ey upon her face
who is it that speak to me thu gentli he ask in a feebl voic

ow you much now i theophilu who am about to die call down the
bless of god upon you and upon him also for your sake for your
sake the shield of god be over you in the slaughter and the sorrow
then he shut hi ey and either could not or would not speak again
miriam drank of the pitcher of water for her thirst wa great crouch
at the side of the old essen she watch him till at length the door
open and two gaunt savagelook men enter who went to where
theophilu lai and kick him brutal
what would you now he said open hi ey
wake up old man cri on of them see here is flesh and he
thrust a lump of some filthi carrion to hi lip smell it tast it
he went on ah is it not good well tell us where is that store of

hollow groan by tomorrow sunris i shall be dead and soon you

that from the cloister without went up flame and smoke thei seem to
be fight there for the air wa full of the sound of shout

against the massiv wall
thei took her into a great chamber support by pillar of white
marbl where mani starv folk some of them women who carri or led
hollowcheek children sat silent on the floor or wander to and

which my friend await us now we must go anoth
so be it said miriam but first give me that jar of water for my
throat is parch
he lift it to her lip and she drank deepli then thei went outsid
the cloister four men were wait two of them those doorkeep who
had search her in the morn the other soldier
you have been a long while with the pretti maid master said on of
them to caleb have you been receiv confess of her sin

back nor water for their stomach come on blue ey but first give
me that necklet of pearl which mai serv to bui a bit of bread or a
drink of wine and he thrust hi filthi hand into her breast
next instant a sword flash in the red light of the even to fall

brute said caleb with an angri snarl go to seek bread and wine in
gehenna the maid is doom to death not to be plunder by such as
you come forward
the companion of the fallen man stare at him then on laugh for
death wa too common a sight to excit piti or surpris and said
he wa ever a greedi fellow let us hope that he ha gone where there
is more to eat
then preced by caleb thei march through the long cloister pass
an inner door turn down more cloister on the right and follow
the base of the great wall came to it beauti centr gate nicanor
that wa adorn with gold and silver and stood between the court of
women and the court of israel over thi gatewai wa a squar build
fifti feet or more in height contain store chamber and place where
the priest kept their instrument of music on it roof which wa
flat were three column of marbl termin by gild spike by the
gate on of the sanhedrim wa wait for them that same relentless
judg simeon who had order miriam to be search
ha the woman confess where she hid the roman he ask of caleb

bring her up he went on sternli and thei pass through some
stone chamber to a place where there wa a staircas with a door of
cedarwood the judg unlock it lock it again behind them and
thei climb the stair till thei came to anoth littl door of stone
which be open miriam found herself on the roof of the gatewai
thei led her to the centr pillar to which wa fasten an iron chain
about ten feet in length here simeon command that her hand should
be bound behind her which wa done then he brought out of hi robe a
scroll written in larg letter and ti it on to her breast thi wa
the write on the scroll
miriam nazaren and traitress is doom here to die as god shall
appoint befor the face of her friend the roman
then follow sever signatur of member of the sanhedrim includ
that of her grandfath benoni who had thu been forc to show the
triumph of patriot over kinship
thi done the end of the chain wa made fast round her middl and
rivet with a hammer in such fashion that she could not possibl escap
it grip then all be finish the men prepar to leav first
howev simeon address her
stai here accurs traitress till your bone fall piecem from
that chain he said stai through storm and shine through light
and dark while roman and jew alik make merri of your suffer
which if my voic had been listen to would have been shorter but
more cruel daughter of satan go back to satan and let the son of the
carpent save you if he can
spare to revil the maid broke in caleb furious for curs ar
spear that fall on the head of those that throw them
had i my will answer the rabbi a spear should fall upon your
head insol who dare to rebuk your elder begon befor me and be
sure of thi that if you strive to return here it shall be for the last
time more is known about you caleb then you think and perhap you
also would make friend among the roman
caleb made no answer for he knew the venom and power of thi zealot
simeon who wa the chosen friend and instrument of the savag john of
gischala onli he look at miriam with sad ey and mutter you
would have it so i can do no more farewel left her to her fate
so there in the red light of the sunset with her hand bound a placard
set out her shame upon her breast and chain like a wild beast
to the column of marbl miriam wa left alon walk as near to the
littl battlement as the length of her chain would allow she look
down into the court of israel where mani of the zealot had gather to
catch sight of her so soon as thei saw her thei yell and hoot and
cast a shower of stone on of which struck her on the shoulder with a
littl cry of pain she ran back as far as she could reach on the further
side of the pillar henc she could see the great court of women whenc
the gate nicanor wa approach by fifteen step form the half of a
circl and fashion of white marbl thi court now wa noth but
a camp for the outer court of the gentil have been taken by the
roman their batter ram were work at it wall
then the night fell but brought no peac with it for the ram smote
continu and sinc thei were not strong enough to break through the
huge stone of the mighti wall the roman renew their attempt to take
them by storm in the hour of dark but inde it wa no dark
for the jew lit fire upon the top of the wall and by their light
drove off the attack roman again and again from her lofti perch
miriam could see the scale ladder appear abov the crest of the wall
then up them would come long line of men each hold a shield abov
hi head as the foremost of these scrambl on to the wall the wait
jew rush at them and cut them down with savag shout while other
jew seiz the rung of the ladder thrust it from the cope to fall
with it live load back into the ditch beneath onc there were great
cri of joi for two standardbear had come up the ladder carri
their ensign with them the men were overpow and the ensign
captur to be wave deris at the roman beneath who answer the
insult with sullen roar of rage
so thing went on till at length the legionari wear of thi
desper fight took anoth counsel hitherto titu had desir to
preserv all the templ even to the outer court and cloister but now
he command that the gate built of great beam of cedar and overlaid
with silver plate should be fire through a storm of spear and
arrow soldier rush up to them and thrust light brand into everi
joint and hing thei caught and present the silver plate ran down
their blaze surfac in molten stream of metal nor wa thi all for
from the gate the fire spread to the cloister on either side nor did
the outworn jew attempt to stai it ravag thei drew back sullenli
and seat in group upon the pave of the court of women watch the
circl of devour flame creep slowli on at length the sun rose now
the roman were labour to extinguish the fire at the gatewai and to
make a road over the ruin by which thei might advanc when it wa
done at last with shout of triumph the legionari command by titu
himself and accompani by a bodi of horsemen advanc into the court
of women back befor them fled the jew pour up the step of the
gate nicanor on the roof of which miriam wa chain to her pinnacl
but of her thei took no note none had time to think or even to look
at a singl girl bound there on high in punish for some offenc of
which the most of them knew noth onli thei man the wall to right
and left and held the gatewai but to the roof where miriam wa thei
did not climb becaus it parapet wa too low to shelter them from the
arrow of their assail
the roman saw her howev for she perceiv that some of hi offic
were point her out to a man on horseback clad in splendid armour
over which fell a purpl cloak whom she took to be titu himself also
on of the soldier shot an arrow at her which struck upon the spike
column abov her head and rebound fell at her feet titu note
thi for she saw the man brought befor him and by hi gestur
gather that the gener wa speak to him angrili after thi no
more arrow were shot at her and she understood that their curios
be stir by the sight of a woman chain upon a gatewai thei did
not wish to do her mischief
now the august sun shone out from a cloudless sky till the hot air
danc abov the roof of the templ and the pave of the court and
the thousand shut within their wall were glad to crowd into the shadow
to shelter from it fieri beam but miriam could not escap them
thu in the morn and again in the afternoon she wa abl inde by
creep round it to take refug in the narrow line of shade thrown by
the marbl column to which she wa made fast at middai howev it
flung no shadow so for all those dread hour she must pant in the
burn heat without a drop of water to allai her thirst still she bore
it till at length came even and it cool
that dai the roman made no attack nor did the jew attempt a salli
onli some of the lighter of the engin were brought into the court of
women whenc thei hurl their great stone and heavi dart into the
court of israel beyond miriam watch these missil as thei rush by
her onc or twice so close that the wind thei made stir her hair
the sight fascin her and took her mind from her own suffer
she could see the soldier work at the lever and pullei till the
string of the catapult or the board of the balista were drawn to their
place then the dart or the stone were set in the groov prepar to
receiv it a cord wa pull and the missil sped upon it wai make
an angri hum nois as it clove the air at first it look small
then approach it grew larg to becom small again to her follow
sight as it journei wa accomplish sometim the stone which did
more damag than the dart fell upon the pave and bound along it
mark their cours by fragment of shatter marbl and a cloud of
dust at other direct by an evil fate thei crash into group
of jew destroi all thei touch wander to and fro among these
peopl wa that craze man jesu the son of anna who had met them
with hi wild prophet cry as thei enter into jerusalem and whose
illomen voic miriam had heard again befor marcu wa taken at the
fight in the old tower to and fro he went none hinder him though
mani thrust their finger in their ear and look asid as he pass
wail forth woe woe to jerusalem woe to the citi and the templ
of a sudden as miriam watch he wa still for a moment then throw
up hi arm cri in a pierc voic woe woe to myself befor the
echo of hi word had di against the templ wall a great stone cast
from the court of women rush upon him through the air and fell him
to the earth on it went with vast bound but jesu the son of anna
lai still now in the hour of the accomplish of hi propheci hi
pilgrimag wa end
all the dai the cloister that surround the court of women burn
fierc but the jew whose heart wa out of them did not salli
forth and the roman made no attack upon the inner court of israel at
length the last rai of the set sun struck upon the slope of the
mount of oliv the white tent of the roman camp and the hundr
of cross each bear it ghastli burden that fill the vallei of
jehoshaphat and climb up the mountain side wherev space could be
found for them to stand then over the tortur famish citi down fell
the welcom night to none wa it more welcom than to miriam for with
it came a copiou dew which seem to condens upon the gild spike of
her marbl pillar whenc it trickl so continu that by lick
a littl channel in the marbl she wa enabl befor it ceas to
allai the worst pang of her thirst thi dew gather upon her hair
bare neck and garment so that through them also she seem to take
in moistur and renew her life after thi she slept a while expect
alwai to be awaken by some fresh conflict but on that night none
took place the fight wa for the morrow meanwhil there wa peac
miriam dream in her uneasi sleep and in thi dream mani vision came
to her she saw thi sacr hill of moriah whereon the templ stood as
it had been in the begin a rug spot cloth with ungraft carob
tree and oliv and inhabit not of men but by wild boar and the
hyna that prei upon their young almost in it centr lai a huge
black stone to thi stone came a man clad in the garb of the arab of
the desert and with him a littl lad whom he bound upon the stone as
though to offer him in sacrific then as he wa about to plung a
knife into hi heart a glori shone round the place and a voic cri
to him to hold hi hand that wa a vision of the offer of isaac it
pass and there came anoth vision
again she saw the sacr height of moriah and lo a templ stood upon
it a splendid build but not that which she knew and in front of
thi templ the same black rock on the rock where onc the lad had
been bound wa an altar and befor the altar a gloriou man clad
in priestli robe who offer sacrific of lamb and oxen and in a
sonor voic gave prais to jehovah in the presenc of a countless
host of peopl thi she knew wa the vision of solomon the king
it pass and lo by thi same black rock stood anoth man pale and
eagerfac with pierc ey who reproach the worshipp in the
templ becaus of the wicked of their heart and drove them from
befor him with a scourg of cord thi she knew wa a vision of jesu
the son of mari that messiah whom she worship for as he drove out
the peopl he prophesi the desol that should fall upon them and
as thei fled thei mock him
the pictur pass and again she saw the black rock but now it lai
beneath a gild dome and light fell upon it through paint window
about it move mani priest whose worship wa strang to her and so
thei seem to move for ag at length the door of that dome were
burst open and upon the priest rush fairfac statelylook men
clad in white mail and bear upon their shield and breastplat
the symbol of the cross thei slaughter the votari of the strang
worship and onc more the rock wa red with blood now thei were gone
in turn and other priest move beneath the dome but the cross had
vanish thenc and it pinnacl were crown with crescent
that vision pass and there came anoth of dim undistinguish
hord that tore down the crescent and slaughter the minist of the
strang faith and gave the dome templ to the flame
that vision pass and onc more the summit of mount moriah wa as it
had been in the begin the wild oliv and the wild fig flourish
among it desol terrac the wild boar roam beneath their shade
and there were none to hunt him onli the sunlight and the moonlight
still beat upon the ancient rock of sacrific
that vision pass and lo around the rock fill the vallei of
jehoshaphat and the vallei beyond and the mount of oliv and the
mountain abov ye and the empti air between earth and sky further
than the ey could reach stood rank upon rank all the countless
million million of mankind all the million that had been and were yet
to be gaze everi on of them anxious and in utter silenc upon
the scar and nake rock of sacrific now upon the rock there grew
a glori so bright that at the sight of it all the million of million
abas their ey and from the glori peal forth a voic of a trumpet
that seem to sai
thi is the end and the begin all thing ar accomplish in their
order now is the dai of decis
then in her dream the sun turn red as blood and the star seem
to fall and wind shook the world and dark cover it and in the
wind and the dark were voic and stand upon the rock it arm
stretch east and west a cross of fire and fill the heaven abov
the cross compani upon compani of angel thi last vision of judgment
pass also and miriam awok again from her haunt horrorbegotten
sleep to see the watchfir of the roman burn in the court of
women befor her and from the court of israel behind her where thei
were herd like cattl in the slaughter yard to hear the groan of
the starv jew who tomorrow were destin to the sword
chapter xviii
the deathstruggl of israel
now the light began to grow but that morn no sun rose upon the sight
of the thousand who wait for it come the whole heaven wa dark
with a grai mist that seem to drift up in billow from the sea
bring with it a salt damp for thi mist miriam wa thank
sinc had the sun shone hotli she knew not how she would have live
through anoth dai alreadi she grew veri weak who had suffer so
much and eaten so littl and whose onli drink had been the dew but she
felt that while the mist hid the sun her life would bide with her
to other also thi mist wa welcom under cover of it caleb approach
the gatewai and although he could not ascend it as the door were
lock and guard he cast on to it roof so cleverli that it fell
almost at miriam feet a linen bag in which wa a leathern bottl
contain wine and water and with it a mouldi crust of bread
doubtless all that he could find or bui or steal kneel down
miriam loos the string of the bag with her teeth and devour the
crust of bread again return thank that caleb had been move to thi
thought but from the bottl she could not drink for her hand be
bound behind her she wa abl neither to lift it nor to unti the thong
that made fast it neck therefor as notwithstand the dew which
she had lap she need drink sore and long also for the us of
her hand to protect herself from the torment attack of sting
gnat and carrion fli she set herself to try to free them
now the gilt spike that crown her pillar wa made fast with
angleiron let into the marbl and the edg of on of these iron
project somewhat and wa rough look at it the thought came into
miriam mind that it might serv to rub through the cord with which her
hand were bound so stand with her back to the pillar she began her
task to find that it must be done littl by littl sinc the awkward
movement weari her moreov her swollen arm chafe against the
marbl of the column becam intoler sore yet although the pain
made her weep from time to time she persev but night fell befor
the frai cord part
in the mist also the roman came near to the gate notwithstand the
risk for thei were veri curiou about her and call to her ask
why she wa bound there she repli in the latin languag which wa
understood by veri few of the jew that it wa becaus she had rescu
a roman from death befor thei could speak again those who question
her were driven back by a shower of arrow discharg from the wall but
in the distanc she thought that she saw on of them make report to an
offic who on receipt of it seem to give some order
meanwhil also under cover of the mist the jew were prepar
themselv for battl to the number of over four thousand men thei
gather silent in the court of israel then of a sudden the gate
were thrown open and among them that of nicanor the trumpet blew a
signal and out thei pour into the court of women drive in the roman
guard and outpost as stick and straw ar driven by a sudden flood
but the legionari beyond were warn and lock their shield
togeth stood firm so that the jew fell back from their iron line as
such a flood fall from an oppos rock yet thei would not retreat
but fought furious kill mani of the roman until at length titu
charg on them at the head of a squadron of hors and drove them back
headlong through the gate then the roman came on and put those whom
thei had captur to the sword but as yet thei did not attempt the
storm of the gate onli offic advanc as near to the wall
as thei dare and call to the jew to surrend sai that titu
desir to preserv their templ and to spare their live but the jew
answer them with insult taunt and mockeri and miriam listen
wonder what spirit had enter into these peopl and made them mad so
that thei chose death and destruct rather than peac and merci then
she rememb her strang vision of the night and in them seem to
find an answer
have repuls thi desper salli the roman offic set thousand
of men to work to attempt to extinguish the flame cloister sinc
notwithstand the answer of the jew titu still desir to save the
templ as for it defend beyond guard the wall of the court
of israel thei did no more gather in such place as were most
protect from the dart and stone thrown by the engin thei crouch
upon the ground some in sullen silenc some beat their breast and
rend their robe while the women and children wail in their
miseri and hunger throw dust upon their head the gate of nicanor
howev wa still held by a strong guard who suffer none to approach
it nor did ani attempt to ascend to it roof that caleb still live
miriam knew for she had seen him cover with dust and blood driven
back by the charg of roman hors up the step of the gatewai thi
inde he wa on of the last to pass befor it wa close and bar
to keep out the pursu roman after that she saw no more of him for
mani a month
so that dai also the last of the long sieg wore awai at nightfal
the thick mist clear and for the last time the rich rai of sunset
shone upon the gleam roof and burn pinnacl of the templ and
were reflect from the dazzl white of it wall never had it
look more beauti than it did in that twilight as it tower still
perfect abov the black ruin of the desol citi the clamour and
shout had di awai even the mourner had ceas their piti
cri except the guard the roman had withdrawn and were eat their
even meal while those who work the terribl engin ceas from
their destroi toil peac an omin peac brood on the place
and everywher save for the flame that crackl among the cedarwood
beam in the roof of the cloister wa deep silenc such as in tropic
land preced the burst of a cyclon to miriam who watch it
seem as though in the midst of thi unnatur quiet jehovah wa
withdraw himself from the hous where hi spirit dwelt and from the
peopl who worship him with their lip but reject him in their
heart her torment nerv shudder with a fear that wa not of the
bodi as she stare upward at the immens arch of the azur even
sky half expect that her mortal ey would catch some vision of
the depart wing of the angel of the lord but there she could see
noth except the shape of hundr of highpois eagl where the
carcas is there shall the eagl be gather togeth she mutter to
herself and rememb that these four bird were come to feast upon
the bone of the whole peopl of the jew and upon her own she shut her
ey and groan
then the light di on the templ tower and fade from the pale slope
of the mountain and in place of the wheel carrion bird bright
star shone out on by on upon the black mantl of the night
onc again set her teeth becaus of the agoni that the touch of the
marbl gave to her raw and swollen flesh miriam began to fret the cord
which bound her wrist against the rough edg of the angleiron she wa
sure that it wa nearli worn through but oh how could she endur the
agoni until it part still she did endur for at her feet lai the
bottl and burn thirst drove her to the deed suddenli her reward
came and she felt that her arm were free ye numb swollen and
bleed thei fell against her side wrench the stiffen muscl
of her shoulder back to their place in such a fashion that she
wellnigh faint with the pain still thei were free and present she
wa abl to lift them and with the help of her teeth to loos the end
of the cord so that the blood could run onc more through her blacken
wrist and hand again she wait till some feel had come back into
her finger which were numb and like to mortifi then she knelt down
and draw the leather bottl to her held it between her palm while
with her teeth she undid it thong the task wa hard for it wa well
ti but at length the knot gave and miriam drank so fear wa
her thirst that she could have empti the bottl at a draught but thi
she who had live in the desert wa too wise to do for she knew that
it might kill her also when that wa gone there wa no more so she
drank half of it in slow sip then ti the string as well as she wa
abl and set it down again
now the wine although it wa mix with water took hold of her who for
so long had eaten noth save a mouldi crust so that strang sound
drum in her ear and sink down against the column she becam
senseless for a while she awok again feel somewhat refresh and
though her head seem as though it did not belong to her well abl
to think her arm also were better and her finger had recov their
feel if onli she could loos that gall chain she thought to
herself she might escap for now death howev strong her faith wa
veri near and unlov also she suffer in mani wai to die and
pass quick to heaventhat would be well but to perish by inch of
starvat heat cold and cramp limb with pain within and without
and a swim sick of the head ah it wa hard to bear she knew
that even were she free she could not hope to descend the gatewai by
it staircas sinc the door were lock and bar and if she pass
them it would be but to find herself among the jew in the vault
chamber beneath but so she thought perhap she could drop from the
roof which wa not so veri high on to the pave in front of the first
stair and then if she wa unhurt run or crawl to the roman who
might give her shelter
so miriam tri to undo the chain onli to find that as well might she
hope to pull down the gate nicanor with her helpless hand at thi
discoveri she wept for now she grew weak well for miriam wa it that
she could not have her wish for certainli had she attempt to
drop down from the gatewai to the marbl pave or even on to the
battlement of the wall which ran up to it on either side her bone
would have been shatter like the shell of an egg and she must have
perish miser
while she griev thu miriam heard a stir in the court of israel and
by the dim starlight saw that men were gather to do what she knew
not present as she wonder the great gate were open veri softli
and out pour the jew upon their last salli miriam wa wit the
deathstruggl of the nation of israel at the foot of the marbl step
thei divid onehalf of them rush toward the cloister on the
right and the other to that upon the left their object as it seem
to her wa to slai those roman soldier who by the command of titu
were still engag in fight the flame that devour these beauti
build and then to surpris the camp beyond the scheme wa such as
a madman might have made see that the roman warn by the sorti
of the morn had thrown up a wall across the lower part of the court
of women and beyond that were protect by everi safeguard known to the
scienc of ancient war also the moment that the first jew set hi foot
upon the staircas watch sentri cri out in warn and trumpet
gave their call to arm
still thei reach the cloister and kill a few roman who had not
time to get awai follow those who fled thei came to the wall and
began to try to forc it when suddenli on it crest and to the rear
appear thousand of those men whom thei had hope to destroi everi
on of them wake arm and marshal the jew hesit and like
a live stream of steel the roman rank pour over the wall then of
a sudden terror seiz those unhappi men and with a melancholi cry of
utter despair thei turn to flee back to the court of israel but thi
time the roman were not content with drive them awai thei came on
with them some of them even reach the gate befor them up the marbl
step pour friend and foe togeth togeth thei pass the open
gate in their mad rush sweep awai those who had stai to guard it
and burst into the court of israel then leav some to hold the gate
and reinforc continu by fresh compani from the camp within and
without the templ court the roman ran on toward the door of the
holi hous cut down the fugit as thei went now none attempt
to stand there wa no fight made even the bravest of the jewish
warrior feel that their hour wa come and that jehovah had desert
hi peopl flung down their weapon and fled some to escap to the
upper citi more to perish on the roman spear
a few attempt to take refug in the holi hous itself and after these
follow some roman bear torch in their hand miriam watch
terrifi from the roof of the gate nicanor saw them go the torch
float on the duski air like point of windtoss fire then suddenli
from a certain window on the north side of the templ sprang out a flame
so bright that from where she stood upon the gate miriam could see
everi detail of the golden traceri a soldier mount on the shoulder
of anoth and not know in hi mad that he wa a destroi
angel had cast a torch into and fire the window up ran the bright
devour flame spread outward like a fan so that within some few
minut all that side of the templ wa but a roar furnac meanwhil
the roman were press through the gate nicanor in an unend stream
till present there wa a cry of make wai make wai
miriam look down to see a man barehead and with closecrop
hair whiterob also and unarmour as though he had risen from
hi couch ride on a great warhors an ivori wand in hi hand and
preced by an offic who bore the standard of the roman eagl it wa
titu itself who as he came shout to the centurion to beat back the
legionari and extinguish the fire but who now could beat them back
as well might he have attempt to restrain the host of gehenna burst
to the upper earth thei were mad with the lust of blood and the lust of
plunder and even to the voic of their dread lord thei paid no heed
new flame sprang up in other part of the vast templ it wa doom

jehovah god of the jew from chamber to chamber he pass ye even
into the holi of holi itself whenc by hi command were brought out

god had desert hi habit did ani harm come to him for that deed
now the templ which for on thousand on hundr and thirti year had
stood upon the sacr summit of mount moriah went upward in a sheet of
flame itself the greatest of the sacrific that had ever been offer
there while soldier strip it of it gold and ornament toss the
sacr vessel to each other and tear down the silken curtain of the
shrine nor were victim lack to that sacrific for in their blind
furi the roman fell upon the peopl who were crowd in the court of
israel and slew them to the number of more than ten thousand warrior
and priest citizen and woman and child togeth till the court swarm
with blood and the rock of offer wa black with the dead who had
taken refug there yet these did not perish quit unaveng for mani
of the roman their arm fill with priceless spoil of gold and
silver the treasur of immemori time sank down overcom by the
heat and where thei fell thei di
from the court of israel went up on mighti wail of those who sank
beneath the sword from the thousand of the roman went up a savag
shout of triumph the shout of those who put them to the sword from the
multitud of the jew who watch thi ruin from the upper citi went
up a ceaseless scream of utter agoni and domin all like the
accompani of some fear music rose the fierc triumphant roar of
fire in straight line and jag pinnacl the flame soar hundr
of feet into the still air leap higher and ever higher as the white
wall and gild roof fell in till all the templ wa but on gigant
furnac near which none could bide save the dead whose veri garment
took fire as thei lai upon the ground never wa such a sight seen
befor never perhap will such a sight be seen againon so awesom
yet so majest
now everi live be whom thei could find wa slain and the roman
drew back bear their spoil with them but the remaind of the jew

broke down behind them across the vallei into the upper citi whenc
that pierc sob wail echo without ceas miriam watch till
she could bear the sight no longer the glare blind her the heat of

turn brown she crouch behind the shelter of her pinnacl gasp
for breath she prai that she might die and could not now she
rememb the drink that remain in the leathern bottl and swallow
it to the last drop then she crouch down again against the pillar
and ly thu her sens left her
when thei came back it wa daylight and from the heap of ash that
had been the templ of herod and the most gloriou build in the whole
world rose a thick cloud of black smoke pierc here and there by
littl angri tongu of fire the court of israel wa strewn so thick
with dead that in place the soldier walk on them as on a carpet
or to be rid of them hurl them into the smoulder ruin upon the
altar that stood on the rock of sacrific a strang sight wa to be
seen for set up there wa an object like the shaft of a lanc wreath
with what seem to be twine snake and surmount by a globe on which
she stood a golden eagl with outspread wing gather in front of it
were a vast number of legionari who did obeis to thi object thei
were offer worship to the roman standard upon the ancient altar of
the god of israel present a figur rode befor them attend by
a glitter staff of offic to be greet with a mighti shout of
titu imper titu imper here on the sens of hi triumph
hi victori legion name their gener csar
nor wa the fight altogeth end for on the roof of some of
the burn cloister were gather a few of the most desper of the
survivor of the jew who as the cloister crumbl beneath them
retreat slowli toward the gate nicanor which still stood unharm
the roman weari with slaughter call to them to come down and
surrend but thei would not and miriam watch them to her horror
saw that on of these men wa none other than her grandfath benoni
as thei would not yield the roman shot at them with arrow so that
present everi on of them wa down except benoni whom no dart seem
to touch
ceas shoot cri a voic and bring a ladder that man is brave
and on of the sanhedrim let him be taken aliv
a ladder wa brought and rear against the wall near the gate nicanor
and up it came roman benoni retreat befor them till he stood upon
the edg of the gulf of advanc fire then he turn round and face
them as he turn he caught sight of miriam huddl at the base of her
column upon the roof of the gate and think that she wa dead wrung
hi hand and tore hi beard she guess hi grief but so weak and
parch wa she that she could call no word of comfort to him or do
more than watch the end with fascin ey
the soldier came on along the top of the wall till thei fear to
approach nearer to the fire lest thei should fall through the burn
rafter
yield thei cri yield fool befor you perish titu give you
your life
that he mai drag me an elder of israel in chain through the street
of rome answer the old jew scornfulli nai i will not yield and i
prai god that the same end which you have brought upon thi citi and it
children mai fall upon your citi and it children at the hand of men
even more cruel than yourselv
then stoop down he lift a spear which lai upon the wall and hurl
it at them so fierc that it transfix the buckler of on of the
soldier and the arm behind the buckler
would that it had been your heart heathen and the heart of all your
race he scream and lift hi hand as though in invoc
suddenli plung headlong into the flame beneath

next instant the soldier were on him and held him fast then it wa for
the first time that the captain caught sight of miriam crouch at the
foot of her pillar

hi strong arm as though she had been but a child and bid the
soldier bring the jew simeon with them slowli and with great care
descend the staircas up which miriam had been taken more than sixti
hour befor
pass through the outer door into the archwai where the great gate by
which the roman had gain access to the templ stood wide the captain

jew continu to hold the upper citi as it chanc howev in on of
the assault upon it that offic who had rescu miriam wa badli hurt

reason pass her lip
now mani would have weari of her and thrust her out to take her

would throw her arm about hi neck and call him uncl as in the
old dai she had name the essen moreov she learn to know the
soldier of that legion who becam fond of her and would bring her
offer of fruit and winter flower or of aught els that thei

pearl and on the pearl the ring which the slavewoman had found in
her hair and ti there for safeti she took off the ring and place it
back upon her finger then she walk to the rock sat down and tri
to think but for thi as yet her mind wa not strong enough for there
rose up in it vision after vision of blood and fire which crush and
overwhelm her all that went befor the sieg wa clear the rest on
red confus
while she sat thu the roman captain hobbl from hi pavilion rest

how you came to be upon that gatewai
so miriam began and told him all her tale while he listen patient
when she had done he rose and limp round the littl tabl bent over

by all the god of the roman greek christian jew and barbarian
nation you ar a nobleheart woman he said and that kiss is

call no ill name and who wa overwhelm through no fault of hi own
fight like a hero ha vanish
across the styx i fear me inde that would be best for him sinc no
roman must be taken prison and live
nai i think not or at the least i hope he live my servant
nehushta would nurs him for my sake and for my sake the essen
among whom i dwelt would guard him even to the loss of their own
live unless hi wound kill him i believ that marcu is aliv
todai
and if that is so you wish to commun with him
what els gallu sai what fate will befal me when i reach rome
you will be kept safe till titu come then accord to hi command
you must walk in hi triumph and after that unless he chang hi
mind which is not like sinc he pride himself upon never have
revers a decre howev hastili it wa made or even ad to or
taken from a judgment you must ala be set up in the forum and sold
as a slave to the highest bidder
sold as a slave to the highest bidder repeat miriam faintli that
is a poor fate for a woman is it not had it been that daughter of
your who di for instanc you would have thought it a poor fate for
her would you not
do not speak of it do not speak of it mutter gallu into hi
beard well in thi as in other thing let us hope that fortun will
favour you
i should like marcu to learn that i am to march in the triumph and
afterward to be set up in the forum and sold as a slave to the highest
bidder said miriam
i should like marcu to learnbut in the name of the godshow is he
to learn if he still live look you we sail tomorrow night what do
you wish me to do
i wish you to send a messeng to marcu bear a token from me to
him
a messeng what messeng who can find him i can despatch a
soldier but your marcu is with the essen who for their own sake
will keep him fast enough as a hostag if thei have cure him also the
essen live accord to your stori in some hynaburrow open out
of an underground quarri in jerusalem that is if thei have not been
discov and kill long ago how then will ani soldier find their
hidingplac
i do not think that such a man would find it answer miriam but i
have friend in thi citi and if i could come at them i might discov
on who would meet with better fortun you know that i am a christian
who wa brought up among the essen both of them persecut peopl
that have their secret if i find a christian or an essen he would
take my messag andunless he wa killeddeliv it
now gallu thought for a while then he said if i were to go out in
tyre ask for christian or essen none would appear as well might
a stork go out and call upon a frog but that old slavewoman who ha
tend on me and you she is cun in her wai and if i promis to
set her at liberti should she succe well perhap she might succe
stai i will summon her and he left the tent
some minut later he return bring the slave with him
i have explain the matter to thi woman miriam he said and i
think that she understand and can prove to ani who ar will to
visit you that thei will have a free pass in to and out of the camp
and need fear no harm tell her then where she is to go and whom she
must seek
so miriam told the woman sai tell ani essen whom you can find
that she who is call their queen bid hi presenc and if he ask
more give him thi wordth sun rise tell ani christian whom you
can find that miriam their sister seek hi aid and if he ask more
give him thi wordth dawn come do you understand
i understand answer the woman
then go said gallu and be back by nightfal rememb that if
you fail in place of liberti you travel to rome whenc you will return
no more
my lord i go answer the woman beat her forehead with her hand
and bow herself from their presenc
by nightfal she wa back again with the tide that no christian
seem to be left in tyre all had fled to pella or elsewher of the
essen howev she had found on a minor brother of the name of
samuel who on hear that miriam wa the captiv and receiv the
watchword said that he would visit the camp after dark although he
greatli fear that thi might be some snare set to catch him
after dark he came accordingli and wa led by the old woman who wait
outsid to meet him to the tent where miriam sat with gallu thi
samuel prove to be a brother of the lowest order of the essen whom
although he knew of her miriam had never seen he had been absent from
the villag by the jordan at the time of the flight of the sect have
come to tyre by leav of the court to bid farewel to hi mother who
wa on her deathb hear that the brethren had fled and hi mother
be still aliv he had remain in tyre instead of seek to rejoin
them at jerusalem thu escap the terror of the sieg that wa
all hi stori now have buri hi mother he desir to rejoin the
brotherhood if ani of them were left aliv
after gallu had left the tent sinc it wa not law that she should
speak of their secret in the presenc of ani man who wa not of the
order miriam have first satisfi herself that he wa in truth
a brother told thi samuel all she knew of the hidingplac of the
essen beyond the ancient quarri and ask him if he wa will to
try to seek it out he said ye for he desir to find them also he
wa bound to give her what help he could sinc should the brethren
discov that he had refus it he would be expel from their order
then have pledg him to be faith to her trust not by oath which
the essen held unlaw but in accord with their secret custom
which wa known to her she took from her hand the ring that marcu had
sent her bid him find out the essen and if their roman prison
wa yet aliv and among them to deliv it to him with a messag
tell him of her fate and whither she had gone if he wa dead or
not to be found anywher then he wa to deliv the ring to the libyan
woman name nehushta with the same messag if he could not find
her either then to her uncl ithiel or fail him to whoever wa
presid of the essen with the same messag prai ani or all of
them to succour her in her troubl should that be possibl at the
least thei were to let her have tide at the hous of gallu the
captain in rome where he propos to place her in charg of hi wife
until the time came for her to be hand over to titu and to walk in
the triumph moreov in case the brother should forget she wrote
a letter that he might deliv to ani of those for whom she gave the
messag in thi letter miriam set out briefli all that had befallen her
sinc that night of part in the old tower and by the help of gallu
whom she now recal to the tent the particular of her rescu and of
the judgment of csar upon her person end it with these word
if it be the will of god and your will o you who mai read thi letter
hast hast to help me that i mai escap the shame more sore than
death which await me yonder in rome
thi letter she sign miriam of the hous of benoni but she did
not write upon it the name of those to whom it wa address fear
lest it should fall into other hand and bring troubl upon them
then gallu ask the man samuel what monei he need for hi journei
and as a reward for hi servic he answer that it wa against hi
rule to take ani monei who wa bound to help those under the protect
of the order without reward or fee whereat gallu stare and said that
there were stranger folk in thi land than in ani other that he knew
and thei were mani
so samuel have bow befor miriam and press her hand in a certain
fashion in token of brotherhood and fidel wa led out of the camp
again nor did she ever see him more yet as it prove he wa a
faith messeng and she did well to trust him
next dai at the prayer of miriam gallu also wrote a letter which
gave him much troubl to a friend of hi who wa a brother offic
with the armi at jerusalem enclos on to be hand to marcu if
perchanc he should have rejoin the standard
now daughter he said we have done all that can be done and must
leav the rest to fate
ye she answer with a sigh we must leav the rest to fate as you
roman call god
in the even thei set sail for itali and with them much of the
captur treasur mani sick and wound men and a guard of soldier as
it chanc have taken the sea after the autumn gale and befor those
of midwint began thei had a swift and prosper voyag endur no
hardship save onc from want of water within thirti dai thei came to
rhegium whenc thei march overland to rome be receiv everywher
veri gladli by peopl who were eager for tide of the war
chapter xx
the merchant demetriu
when on that fate night in the old tower miriam sprang forward to
strike the lantern from the hand of the jew nehushta who wa bend
over the fallen marcu and drag at hi bodi did not even see that
she had left the door
with an effort the slope of the rocki passag beyond favour her she
halfdrew halflift the roman through the entranc then it wa as
she straighten herself a littl to take breath that she heard the
thud of the rock door close behind her still as it wa dark she did
not guess that miriam wa part from them for she said
ah into what troubl do not these men lead us poor women well just
in time and i think that none of them saw us
there wa no answer sound could not pierc that wall and the place wa
silent as a tomb
ladi in the name of christ where ar you ladi ask nehushta in
a pierc whisper and the echo of the galleri answeredwher ar
you ladi
just then marcu awok
what ha chanc what place is thi miriam he ask
thi ha chanc answer nehushta in the same aw voic we ar
in the passag lead to the vault miriam is in the hand of the jew
in the old tower and the door is shut between us accurs roman to
save your life she ha sacrif herself without doubt she sprang from
the door to dash the lantern from the hand of the jew and befor she
could return again it had swung home now thei will crucifi her becaus
she rescu youa roman
dont talk woman broke in marcu savag open the door i am
still a man i can still fight or he ad with a groan rememb
that he had no sword at the least i can die for her
i cannot gasp nehushta she had the iron that lift the secret
latch if you had kept your sword roman it might perhap have serv
but that ha gone also
break it down said marcu come i will help
ye ye roman you will help to break down three feet of solid
stone
then began that hideou scene whereof someth ha been said nehushta
strove to reach the latch with her finger marcu stand upon on
foot strove to shake the stone with hi shoulder the black silent
stone that never so much as stir yet thei work madli their breath
come in great gasp know that the work wa in vain and that even
if thei could open the door by now it would be to find miriam gone
or at the best to be taken themselv suddenli marcu ceas from hi
labour
lost he moan and for my sake o ye god for my sake then
down he fell hi har clatter on the rocki step and lai there
mutter and laugh foolishli
nehushta ceas also gasp the lord help you miriam for i cannot
oh after all these year to lose you thu and becaus of that man
and she glare through the dark toward the fallen marcu think
in her heart that she would kill him
nai she said to herself she love him and did she know it might
pain her better kill myself ye and if i were sure that she is dead
thi sin or no sin i would do
as she sat thu helpless hopeless she saw a light come up the stair
toward them it wa born by ithiel nehushta rose and face him
prais be to god there you ar at length he said thrice have i
been up thi stair wonder why miriam did not come
brother ithiel answer nehushta miriam will come no more she
is gone leav us in exchang thi man marcu the roman prefect of
hors
what do you mean what do you mean he gasp where is miriam
in the hand of the jew she answer then she told him all that
stori
there is noth to be done he moan when she had finish to open
the door now would be but to reveal the secret of our hidingplac to
the jew or to the roman either of whom would put us to the sword the
jew for food the roman becaus we ar jew we can onli leav her to
god and protect ourselv
had i my will answer nehushta i would leav myself to god and
still strive to protect her yet you ar right see that mani live
cannot be risk for the sake of on girl but what of thi man
we will do our best for him answer ithiel for so she who
sacrif herself for hi sake would have wish also year ago he wa
our guest and befriend us stai here a while and i will bring men to
carri him to the vault
so ithiel went awai to return with sundri of the brethren who lift
marcu and bore him down the stair and passag to that darksom
chamber where miriam had slept while other brethren shut the trapdoor
and loosen the roof of the passag block it with stone so that
without great labour none could pass that path for ever
here in thi silent sunless vault for mani mani dai marcu lai sick
with a brain fever of which had it not been for the skil nurs
of nehushta and of the leech among the essen he must certainli
have di but these leech who were veri clever doctor the deep
swordcut in hi head remov with littl iron hook the fragment of
bone which press upon hi brain and dress that wound and anoth
in hi knee with salv
meanwhil thei learn by their spi that both the templ and mount
sion had fallen also thei heard of the trial of miriam and of her
exposur on the gate nicanor but of what happen to her afterward
thei could gather noth so thei mourn her as dead
now their food be at length exhaust and the watch of the roman
have relax thei determin those who were left of them for some
had di and ithiel himself wa veri ill to attempt to escap from the
hate vault that had shelter them for all these month a question
aros as to what wa to be done with marcu now but a shadow of a man
who still wander somewhat in hi mind but who had pass the worst of
hi sick and seem like to live some were for abandon him some
for send him back to the roman but nehushta show that it would be
wise to keep him as a hostag so that if thei were attack thei might
produc him and in return for their care perhap bui their live in
the end thei agre upon thi cours not so much for what thei might
gain by it but becaus thei knew that it would have pleas the lost
maid whom thei call their queen who had perish to save thi man
so it came about that upon a certain night of rain and storm when none
were stir a number of men with face white as leper of the hue
inde of root that have push in the dark might have been seen
travel down the cavern quarri now tenant onli by the corps
of those who had perish there from starvat and so through the hole
beneath the wall into the free air with them went litter bear their
sick and among the sick ithiel and marcu none hinder their flight
for the roman had desert thi part of the ruin citi and were
encamp around the tower in the neighbourhood of mount sion where
some few jew still held out
thu it happen that by morn thei were well on the road to jericho
which alwai a desert countri wa now quit devoid of life on thei
went live on root and such littl food as still remain to them
to jericho itself where thei found noth but a ruin haunt by a
few starv wretch thenc thei travel to their own villag to
discov that for the most part thi also had been burnt but certain
cavern in the hillsid behind which thei us as storehous
remain and undiscov in them a secret stock of corn and wine that
gave them food
here then thei camp and set to work to sow the field which no
roman or robber had been abl to destroi and so live hardli but
unmolest till at length the first harvest came and with it plenti
in thi dry and wholesom air marcu recov rapidli who by natur
wa veri strong when first hi wit return to him he recognis
nehushta and ask her what had chanc she told him all she knew and
that she believ miriam to be dead tide which caus him to
fall into a deep melancholi meanwhil the essen treat him with
kind but let him understand that he wa their prison nor if he
had wish it and thei had given him leav to go could he have left
them at that time see that the slightest of hi hurt prove to be
the worst sinc the spear or swordcut have penetr to the joint
and let out the oil the wound in hi knee would heal onli by veri slow
degre and for mani week left him so lame that he could not walk
without a crutch so here he sat by the bank of the jordan mourn
the past and wellnigh hopeless for the futur
thu in solitud tend by nehushta who now had grown veri grim and
old and by the poor remnant of the essen marcu pass four or five
miser month as he grew stronger he would limp down to the villag
where hi host were engag in rebuild some of their dwell and
sit in the garden of the hous that wa onc occupi by miriam now it
wa but an overgrown place yet among the pomegran bush still stood
that shed which she had us as a workshop and in it ly here and
there as thei had fallen some of her unfinish marbl among them on
of himself which she began and cast asid befor she execut that bust
which nero had name divin and set him to guard in the templ at rome
to marcu it wa a sad place haunt by a thousand memori yet he
love it becaus those memori were all of miriam
titu said rumour have accomplish the utter destruct of
jerusalem had move hi armi to csarea or berytu where he pass the
winter season in celebr game in the amphitheatr these he made
splendid by the slaughter of vast number of jewish prison who were
forc to fight against each other or after the cruel roman fashion
expos to the attack of raven wild beast but although he thought
of do so marcu had no mean of commun with titu and wa
still too lame to attempt escap could he have found ani inde to
make us of them might have brought destruct upon the essen who
had treat him kindli and save hi life also among the roman it wa
a disgrac for a soldier and especi for an offic of high rank to
be made prison and he wa loth to expos hi own shame as gallu had
told miriam no roman should be taken aliv so marcu attempt to do
noth but wait sick at heart for whatev fate fortun might send
him inde had he been quit sure that miriam wa dead he who wa
disgrac and a captiv would have slain himself and follow her but
although none doubt her deathexcept nehushtahi spirit did not
tell him that thi wa so thu it came about that marcu live on among
the essen till hi health and strength came back to him as it wa
appoint that he should do until the time came for him to act at
length that time came
when samuel the essen left tyre bear the letter and the ring of
miriam he journei to jerusalem to find the holi citi but a heap
of ruin haunt by hyna and bird of prei that feast on the
innumer dead still faith to hi trust he strove to discov
that entranc to the cavern of which miriam had told him and to thi
end hover dai by dai upon the north side of the citi near to the old
damascu gate the hole he could not find for there were thousand of
stone behind which jackal had burrow and how wa he to know which
of these open led to cavern nor were there ani left to direct him
still samuel search and wait in the hope that on dai an essen
might appear who would guid him to the hidingplac of the brethren
but no essen appear for the good reason that thei had fled alreadi
in the end he wa seiz by a patrol of roman soldier who had observ
him hover about the place and question him veri strictli as to hi
busi he repli that it wa to gather herb for food whereon their
offic said that thei would find him food and with it some us
work so thei took him and press him into a gang of captiv who were
engag in pull down the wall that jerusalem might nevermor becom
a fortifi citi in thi gang he wa forc to labour for over four
month receiv onli hi daili bread in payment and with it mani
blow and hard word until at last he found an opportun to make hi
escap
now among hi fellowslav wa a man whose brother belong to the
order of the essen and from him he learn that thei had gone back
to jordan so thither samuel start have miriam ring still hidden
safe about hi person reach the place without further accid he
declar himself to the essen who receiv him with joi which wa
not to be wonder at sinc he wa abl to tell them that miriam whom
thei name their queen and believ to be dead wa still aliv he
ask them if thei had a roman prison call marcu hidden awai
among them and when thei answer that thi wa so said that he had
a messag from miriam which he wa charg to deliv to him then thei
led him to the garden where her workshop had been tell him that
there he would find the roman
marcu wa seat in the garden bask in the sunshin and with him
nehushta thei were talk of miriaminde thei spoke of littl
els

dead marcu wa sai it is not possibl that she could have live
through that night of the burn of the templ

did livea in your heart you believ also i do not think it wa
fate that ani christian should perish in that war sinc it ha been
prophesi otherwis
prove it to me woman and i should be inclin to becom a christian
but of propheci and such vagu talk i am weari
you will becom a christian when your heart is touch and not befor
answer nehushta sharpli that light is from within
as she spoke the bush part and thei saw the essen samuel stand
in front of them

i seek the nobl roman marcu he answer for whom i have a
messag is that he

open to the air lai ithiel the old man wa on hi deathb for ag
hardship and anxieti had done their work with him so that now he wa
unabl to stand but reclin upon a pallet await hi releas to him

maiden to be set up in the forum at rome and sold to the highest bidder
it would have been better that she perish on the gate nicanor
perhap thi same god answer ithiel with a faint smile will
deliv her from that fate as he ha deliv her from mani other
now what do you seek my lord marcu
i seek liberti which hitherto you have refus to me ithiel i must
travel to rome as fast as ship and hors can carri me i desir to
be present at that auction of the captiv at least i am rich and can
purchas miriamunless i am too late
purchas her to be your slave
nai to be my wife
she will not marri you you ar not a christian
then if she ask it to set her free man would it not be better that
she should fall into my hand than into those of the first passerbi who
chanc to take a fanci to her face
ye i think it is better answer ithiel though who am i that i
should judg let the court be summon and at onc thi matter must be
laid befor them if you should purchas her and she desir it do you
promis that you will set her free
i promis it
ithiel look at him strang and said good but in the hour of
temptat if it should come see that you do not forget your word
so the court wa call togeth not the full hundr that us to sit
in the great hall but a bare score of the survivor of the essen and
to them the brother samuel repeat hi tale to them also marcu made
hi petit for freedom that he might journei to rome with nehushta
and if it were possibl deliv miriam from her bond now some of
the more timid of the essen spoke against the releas of so valuabl
a hostag upon the chanc of hi be abl to aid miriam but ithiel
cri from hi litter
what would you allow our own advantag to prevail against the hope
that thi maiden who is love by everyon of us mai be save shame
upon the thought let the roman go upon hi errand sinc we cannot
so in the end thei agre to let him go and as he had none even
provid monei for hi fare out of their scanti secret store
trust that he might find opportun to repai it in time to come
that night marcu and nehushta bade farewel to ithiel
i am dy said the old essen befor ever you can set foot in rome
the breath will be out of my bodi and beneath the desert sand i shall
lie at peacewho desir peac yet sai to miriam my niec that my
spirit will watch over her spirit await it come in a land where
there ar no more war and tribul and that meanwhil i who love
her bid her to be of good cheer and to fear noth
so thei part from ithiel and travel upon hors to joppa marcu
disguis hi name and rank lest some offic among the roman
should detain him here by good fortun thei found a ship sail for
alexandria and in the port of alexandria a merchant vessel bound for
rhegium in which thei took passag none ask them who thei might be
upon the night of the burn of the templ caleb escap the
slaughter wa driven with simon the zealot across the bridg into the
upper citi which bridg thei broke down behind them onc he tri to
return in the mad hope that dure the confus he might reach the
gate nicanor and if she still live rescu miriam but alreadi the
roman held the head of the bridg and alreadi the jew were hack at
it timber so in that endeavour he fail and in hi heart made sure
that miriam had perish so bitterli did caleb mourn who fierc and
wayward as he wa by natur still love her more than all the world
besid that for six dai or more he sought death in everi desper
adventur which came to hi hand and thei were mani but death fled
him and on the seventh dai he had tide
a man who wa hidden among the ruin of the cloister manag to escap
to the upper citi from him caleb learn that the woman who wa said
to have been found upon the roof of the gate nicanor had been brought
befor titu who gave her over to the charg of a roman captain by
whom she had been taken without the wall he knew no more the stori
wa slight enough yet it suffic for caleb who wa certain that thi
woman must be miriam from that moment he determin to abandon the
caus of the jew which inde wa now hopeless and to seek out
miriam wherev she might be yet search as he would anoth fifteen
dai went by befor he could find hi opportun
at length caleb wa place in charg of a watch upon the wall and the
other member of hi compani fall asleep from faint and fatigu
contriv in the dark to let himself down by a rope which he had
secret drop from the end of it into the ditch in thi ditch he
found mani dead bodi and from on of them that of a peasant who
had di but recent took the cloth and a long winter cloak of
sheepskin which he exchang for hi own garment then keep onli
hi sword which he hid beneath the cloak he pass the roman picket
in the gloom and fled into the countri when daylight came caleb cut
off hi beard and trim hi long hair short after thi meet a
countryman with a load of veget which he had licenc to sell in the
roman camp caleb bought hi store from him for a piec of gold for he
wa well furnish with monei promis the simpl man that if he said
a word of it he would find him out and kill him then counterfeit the
speech and action of a peasant which he who had been brought up among
them down by the bank of jordan well could do caleb march boldli to
the nearest roman camp and offer hi ware for sale
now thi camp wa situat outsid the gate of gennat not far from the
tower hippicu therefor it is not strang that although in the cours
of hi bargain he made dilig inquiri as to the fate of the girl
who had been taken to the gate nicanor caleb could hear noth of her
see that she wa in a camp situat on the mount of oliv upon
the other side of jerusalem baffl for that dai caleb continu hi
inquiri on the next take a fresh suppli of veget which he
purchas from the same peasant to anoth bodi of soldier camp in
the vallei of himnon so he went on from dai to dai search the
troop which surround the citi and work from the vallei of himnon
northward along the vallei of the kedron till on the tenth dai he came
to a littl hospit camp pitch on the slope of the hill opposit to
the ruin which onc had been the golden gate here while proffer hi
veget he fell into talk with the cook who wa sent to chaffer with
him
ah said the cook handl the basket with satisfact it is a
piti friend that you did not bring thi stuff here a while ago when
we want it sore and found it hard to come by in thi barren
swordwast land
why ask caleb carelessli
oh becaus of a prison we had here a girl whose suffer had made
her sick in mind and bodi and whose appetit i never knew how to tempt
for she turn from meat and ever ask for fish of which of cours
we had none or fail that for green food and fruit
what were her name and stori ask caleb
as for her name i know it not we call her pearlmaiden becaus of a
collar of pearl she wore and becaus also she wa white and beauti
as a pearl oh beauti inde and so gentl and sweet even in her
sick that the roughest brute of a legionari with a broken head
could not choos but to love her much more then that old bear gallu
who watch her as though she were hi own cub
inde and where is thi beauti ladi now i should like to sell her
someth
gone gone and left us all mourn
not dead said caleb in a new voic of eager dismai oh not dead
the fat cook look at him calmli
you take a strang interest in our pearlmaiden cabbagesel he
said and now that i come to think of it you ar a strangelook
man for a peasant
with an effort caleb recov hi selfcommand
onc i wa better off than i am now friend he answer as you
know in thi countri the wheel of fortun ha turn rather quick of
late
ye ye and left mani crush flat behind it
the reason why i am interest went on caleb take no heed is
that i mai have lost a fine market for my good
well and so you have friend some dai ago the pearlmaiden depart
to tyre in charg of the captain gallu on her wai to rome perhap
you would wish to follow and sell her your onion there
perhap i should answer caleb when you roman have gone thi
seem like to becom a bad countri for garden sinc owl and
jackal do not bui fruit and you will leav no other live thing
behind you
true answer the cook csar know how to handl a broom and he ha
made a veri clean sweep and he point complac to the heapedup
ruin of the templ befor them but how much for the whole basket
full
take them friend said caleb and sell them to your mess for
the best price that you can get you need not mention that you paid
noth
oh no i wont mention it good morn mr cabbagegrow good
morn
then he stood still watch as caleb vanish quickli among the great
bole of the oliv tree what can stir a jew so much he reflect to
himself as to make him give someth for noth and especi to a
roman perhap he is pearlmaiden brother no that cant be from hi
eyesh lover more like well it is no affair of mine and although
he never grew them the veget ar good and fresh
that even when caleb still disguis as a peasant wa travel
through the grow twilight across the hill that border the road to
tyre he heard a mighti wail rise from jerusalem and knew that it wa
the deathcri of hi peopl now everywher abov such portion of the
beleagu citi as remain stand shot up tall spire and wreath
of flame titu had forc the wall and thousand upon thousand of
jew were perish beneath the sword of hi soldier or in the fire
of their burn home still some nineti thousand were left aliv
to be driven like cattl into the court of women here more than ten
thousand di of starvat while some were set asid to grace the
triumph some to be slaughter in the amphitheatr at csarea and
berytu but the most were transport to egypt there until thei di
to labour in the desert mine thu wa the last desol accomplish
and the propheci fulfil and the lord shall bring thee into egypt
again with ship and there ye shall sell yourselv unto your
enemi for bondmen and for bondwomen and no man shall bui you thu
did ephraim return to egypt whenc he came forth to sojourn in the
promis land until the cup of hi sin wa full now onc more that land
wa a desert without inhabit all it pleasant place were wast
all it fenc citi destroi and over their ruin and the bone of
their children flew csar eagl the war wa end there wa peac
in juda solitudinem faciunt pacem appel
when caleb reach tyre by the last light of the set sun he saw a
whitesail gallei beat her wai out to sea enter the citi he
inquir who went in the gallei and wa told gallu a roman captain in
charg of a number of sick and wound men mani of the treasur of the
templ and a beauti girl who wa said to be the granddaught of
benoni of that town
then know that he wa too late caleb groan in bitter of
spirit present howev he took thought now caleb wa wise in hi
gener for at the begin of thi long war he had sold all hi
land and hous for gold and jewel which to a veri great valu he
had left hidden in tyre in the hous of a man he trust an old servant
of hi father to thi store he had ad from time to time out of
the proce of plunder of trade and of the ransom of a rich roman
knight who wa hi captiv so that now hi wealth wa great go
to the man hous caleb claim and pack thi treasur in bale of
syrian carpet to resembl merchandis
then the peasant who had travel into tyre upon busi about a mule
wa seen no more but in place of him appear demetriu the egyptian
merchant who bought larg though alwai at night of the merchandis
of tyre and sail with it by the first ship to alexandria here thi
merchant bought much more good such as would find a readi sale in the
roman market enough to fill the half of a gallei inde which lai in
the harbour near the pharo lade for syracus and rhegium
at length the gallei sail mean to make crete but wa caught by
a winter storm and driven to papho in cypru where be afraid to
attempt the sea again let the merchant demetriu do what he would
to urg them forward the captain and crew of the gallei determin
to winter so thei beach her in the harbour and went up to the great
templ rejoic to pai their vow and offer gift to venu who had
deliv them from the furi of the sea that thei might swell the
number of her votari
but although he accompani them sinc otherwis thei might have
suspect that he wa a jew demetriu who sought anoth goddess
curs venu in hi heart know that had it not been for her delight
the sailor would have risk the weather still there wa no help for
it and no other ship by which he could sail so here he abod for more
than three month spend hi time in curium amatho and salami
trade among the rich nativ of cypru out of whom he made a
larg profit and ad wine and copper from tamasu to hi other
merchandis as much as there wa room for on the ship
in the end after the great spring festiv for the captain said that it
would not be fortun to leav until thi had been celebr thei
set sail and came by wai of rhode to the island of crete and thenc
touch at cythera to syracus in sicili and so at last to rhegium
here the merchant demetriu tranship hi good into a vessel that
wa sail to the port of centum cell and have reach that place

so for hard upon six month till midsumm inde miriam dwelt in the
hous of gallu and hi wife julia she wa not happi although to them
she becam as a daughter who could be happi even in the sunshin of
a peac present that walk her world between two such bank of
shadow behind wa the shadow of the terribl past in front black
and forbid rose the shadow of the futur which might be yet more
terribl the futur when she would be the slave of some man unknown
sometim walk with julia humbl dress and mingl with the
crowd her headdress arrang to hide her face as much as might be she
saw the rich lord of rome go by in chariot on horseback in litter
all sort and condit of them fat proud men with bold ey
hardfac statesmen or lawyer warworn cruellook captain
dissolut youth with foppish dress and perfum hair and shudder
wonder whether she wa appoint to ani on of these or wa it
perhap to that rich and greasi tradesman or to yon lowborn freedman
with a cun leer she knew not god alon knew and in him must be
her trust
onc as miriam wa walk thu gorgeous clad slave arm with rod
of offic appear burst a wai through the crowd street to an
accompani of oath and blow after these came lictor bear
the fasc on their shoulder then a splendid chariot drawn by white
hors and driven by a curl and scent chariot in it that he
might be the better seen stood a young man tall ruddyfac and clad
in royal attir who look downward as though from bash but
all the while scan the crowd out of the corner of hi dim blue ey
shade by lid devoid of lash for a moment miriam felt those ey
rest upon her and knew that she wa the subject of some jest which
their owner address to the exquisit chariot caus him to laugh
then a horror of that man took hold of her and when he had gone by
bow in answer to the shout of the peopl who as it seem to her
cheer from fear and not with joi she ask julia who he might be
who but domitian she answer the son of on csar and the brother
of anoth who hate both and would like to wear their crown he is
an evil man and if he should chanc to cross your path bewar of him
miriam
miriam shudder and said
as well mother might you bid the mous that is caught abroad to
bewar of the cat it meet at night
some mice find hole that cat cannot pass answer julia with
mean as thei turn their face homeward
dure all thi time although gallu made dilig inquiri among the
soldier who arriv from juda miriam could hear noth of marcu so
that at last she came to believ that he must be dead and with him the
belov and faith nehushta and to hope that if thi were so she
also might be taken still amongst all thi troubl she had on great
comfort under the mild rule of vespasian although their meetingplac
were known the christian had peac for a while therefor in compani
with julia and mani other of the brotherhood she wa abl to visit the
catacomb on the appian wai by night and there in those dismal endless
tomb to offer prayer and receiv the ministr of the church the
great apostl st peter and st paul had suffer martyrdom inde
but thei had left mani teacher behind them and the chief of these soon
grew to know and love the poor jewish captiv who wa doom to slaveri
therefor here also she found friend and consol of spirit
in time gallu came to learn that hi wife wa also of the faith and
for a while thi knowledg seem to cast him down in the end howev
he shrug hi shoulder and said that she wa certainli of an ag to
judg for herself and that he trust no harm might come of it inde
when the principl of the christian hope were explain to him he
listen to them eagerli enough who had lost hi onli child and until
now had never heard thi strang stori of resurrect and etern life
still although he listen and even from time to time wa present when
the brethren prai he would not be baptis who said that he wa too
sunk in year to throw incens on a new altar
at length titu came the senat which long befor hi arriv had
decre him a triumph meet him outsid the wall and there after
some ancient formal commun to him their decis moreov
it wa arrang that vespasian hi father should share in thi
triumph becaus of the great deed which he had done in egypt so that
it wa said everywher that thi would be the most splendid ceremoni
which rome had ever seen after thi titu pass to hi palac and
there live privat for sever week rest while the prepar
for the great event went forward
on morn earli gallu wa summon to the palac whenc he return
rub hi hand and try to look pleas with him as julia had
said a sure sign of evil tide
what is it husband she ask
oh noth noth he answer except that our pearlmaiden here
must accompani me after the middai meal into the august presenc of
vespasian and titu the csar wish to see her that thei mai decid
where she is to walk in the process if she is held to be beauti
enough thei will grant to her a place of honour by herself do you
hear that wifebi herself not far in front of the veri chariot of
titu as for the dress that she will wear he went on nervous sinc
neither of hi auditor seem delight with thi new it is to be
splendid quit splendid all of the purest white silk with littl disc
of silver sewn about it and a represent of the gate nicanor work
in gold thread upon the breast of the robe
at thi tide miriam broke down and began to weep
dry your tear girl he said roughli although the thick of hi
voic suggest that water and hi own ey were not far apart what
must be must be and now is the time for that god you worship to show
you some mark of favour sure he should do so see how long and
how often you prai to him in burrow that a jackal would turn from
i think he will answer miriam ceas her sob with a bold
uplift of her soul toward the light of perfect faith
i am sure he will ad julia gentli stroke miriam dark and
curl hair
then broke in gallu drive the point to it logic conclus
what have you to fear a long hot walk through the shout populac
who will do no harm to on so love and after that whatev good fate
your god mai choos for you come let us eat that you mai look your
best when you appear befor the csar
i would rather look my worst said miriam bethink her of domitian
and hi blear ey still to pleas gallu she tri to eat and
afterward accompani by him and by julia wa carri in a close
litter to the palac
too soon she wa there arriv a littl befor them and wa help
from the litter by slave wear the imperi liveri now she found
herself alon in a great marbl court fill with offic and nobl
await audienc
that is the pearlmaiden said on of them whereon thei all crowd
around her criticis her aloud in their idl curios
too short said on too thin said anoth too small in the foot
for her ankl said a third fool broke in a fourth a young man
with a fine figur and dark ring round hi ey what is the us
of try to cheapen thi piec of good thu in the ey of the
experienc i sai that thi pearlmaiden is as perfect as those pearl
about her own neck on a small scale perhap but quit perfect and
you will admit that i ought to know
luciu sai that she is perfect remark on of them in a tone of
acquiesc as though that verdict settl the matter
ye went on the critic luciu now to take on thing onli a
point so often overlook observ how fresh and firm her flesh is when
i press it thu and he suit the action to the word as i thought
my finger leav scarc ani mark
but my arm doe said a gruff voic besid him and next moment thi
scent judg of human be receiv the point of the elbow of gallu
between the ey just where the nose is set into the forehead with such
forc and skill wa the blow direct that next instant the critic wa
sprawl on hi back upon the pavement the blood gush from hi
nostril now most of them laugh but some murmur while gallu
said
wai there friend wai there i am charg to deliv thi ladi to the
csar and to certifi that while she wa in my care no man ha so
much as laid a finger on her wai there i prai you and as for that
whimper puppi on hi back if he wish it he know where to
find gallu my sword will mark him wors than my elbow if he want
bloodlet that i swear
now with jest and excus thei fell back on and all there were few
of them who did not know that lame as he might be now old gallu wa
still the fiercest and most dread swordsman of hi legion inde he
wa commonli report to have slain eighteen men in singl combat and
when young even to have face the most celebr gladiat of the dai
for sport or to win a privat bet and given him life as he lai at hi
merci
so thei pass on through long hall guard by soldier till at length
thei came to a wide passag close with splendid curtain where the
offic on duti ask them their busi gallu told him and he
vanish through the curtain whenc he return present beckon
them to advanc thei follow him down a corridor set with bust of
depart emperor and empress to find themselv in a round marbl
chamber veri cool and light from abov in thi chamber sat and
stood three men vespasian whom thei knew by hi strong quiet face and
grizzl hair titu hi son the darl of mankind thin activ

smile plai about the corner of hi mouth and domitian hi brother
who ha alreadi been describ a man taller than either of them by half
a head and more gorgeous attir in front of the august three wa a
master of ceremoni clad in a darkcolour robe who wa show them
draw of variou section of the triumphal process and take
their order as to such alter as thei wish
also there were present a treasur some offic and two or three of
the intim friend of titu

have a messag for your ear and it is that no shame shall come near

i hear the word of the lord spoken through the mouth of hi messeng
she said and henceforth i will strive to fear noth no not even
domitian
least of all domitian daughter that son of satan whom satan shall

then go to the door he summon julia and while gallu watch

then the litter wa brought into the courtyard with the guard that
were sent to accompani it and thei start for the gatheringplac
beyond the triumphal wai dark though it still wa all rome wa astir
on everi side shone torch from everi hous and street rose the murmur
of voic for the mighti citi made herself readi to celebr the
greatest festiv which her inhabit had seen even now at time the
press wa so dens that the soldier were oblig to forc a wai through
the crowd which pour outward to find good place along the line of
the triumph or to take up their station on stand of timber and in
hous thei had hire whose roof balconi and window command the
path of the pageant
thei cross the tiber thi miriam knew by the roar of the water
beneath and becaus the crush upon the narrow bridg wa so great
thenc she wa born along through countri compar open to the
gatewai of some larg build where she wa order to dismount from
the litter here offic were wait who took charg of her give to
gallu a written receipt for her person then either becaus he would
not trust himself to bid her farewel or becaus he did not think it
wise to do so in the presenc of the offic gallu turn and left
her without a word
come on girl said a man but a secretari look up from hi
tablet call to him
gentli there with that lot or you will hear about it she is
pearlmaiden the captiv who made the quarrel between the csar and
domitian of which all rome is talk gentli i tell you gentli for
mani free princess ar worth less todai
hear thi the man bow to miriam almost with rever and
beg her to follow him to a place that had been set apart for her she
obei pass through a great number of peopl of whom all she could
see in the gloom of the break dawn wa that like herself thei were
captiv to a littl chamber where she wa left alon watch the
light grow through the lattic and listen to the hum of voic
that rose without mingl now and again with sob and wail of grief
present the door open and a servant enter with bread on a platter
and milk in an earthenwar vessel these she took thankfulli know
that she would need food to support her dure the long dai but
scarc had she begun to eat when a slave appear clad in the imperi
liveri and bear a trai of luxuri meat serv in silver vessel
pearlmaiden he said my master domitian send you greet and
thi present the vessel ar your own and will be kept for you but he
bid me add that tonight you shall sup off dish of gold
miriam made no answer though on rose to her lip but after the man
had depart with her foot she overset the trai so that the silver
vase fell clatter to the floor where the savori meat were
spill then she went on eat the bread and milk till her hunger wa
satisfi
scarc had she finish her meal when an offic enter the cell and
led her out into a great squar where she wa marshal amongst mani
other prison by now the sun wa up and she saw befor her a splendid
build and gather below the build all the senat of rome in
their robe and mani knight on hors and nobl and princ from
everi countri with their retinuesa veri wonder and gallant sight
in front of the build were cloister befor which were set two ivori
chair while to right and left of these chair as far as the ey could
reach were drawn up thousand upon thousand of soldier the senat
the knight and the princ as she could see from the rise ground
whereon she stood be in front of them and of the chair present
from the cloister clad in garment of silk and wear crown of
laurel appear the csar vespasian and titu attend by domitian
and their staff as thei came the soldier saw them and set up a mighti
triumphant shout which sound like the roar of the sea that endur
while the csar sat themselv upon their throne up and up went
the sound of the continu shout till at length vespasian rose and
lift hi hand
then silenc fell and cover hi head with hi cloak he seem to
make some prayer after which titu also cover hi head with hi
cloak and offer a prayer thi done vespasian address the soldier
thank them for their braveri and promis them reward whereon thei
shout again until thei were march off to the feast that had been
made readi now the csar vanish and the offic began to order the
great process of which miriam could see neither the begin nor
the end all she knew wa that befor her in line eight wide were
marshal two thousand or more jewish prison bound togeth with
rope among whom immedi in front of her were a few women next
she came walk by herself and behind her also walk by himself a
dark sullenlook man clad in a white robe and a purpl cloak with
a gild chain about hi neck
look at him she wonder where she had seen hi face which seem
familiar to her then there rose befor her mind a vision of the court
of the sanhedrim sit in the cloister of the templ and of herself
stand there befor them she rememb that thi man wa seat next
to that simeon who had been so bitter against her and pronounc upon
her the cruel sentenc of death also that some on in the crowd had
address him as simon the son of giora none other than the savag
gener whom the jew had admit into the citi to make wai upon the
zealot john of gischala from that dai to thi she had heard noth
of him till now thei met again the judg and the victim caught in a
common net present in the confus thei were brought togeth and
he knew her
ar you miriam the granddaught of benoni he ask
i am miriam she answer whom you simon and your fellow doom
to a cruel death but who have been preserv
to walk in a roman triumph better that you had di maiden at
the hand of your own peopl
better that you had di simon at your own hand or at those of the
roman
that i am about to do he repli bitterli fear not woman you will
be aveng
i ask no vengeanc she answer nai cruel as you ar i griev that
you a great captain should have come to thi
i griev also maiden your grandsir old benoni chose the better
part
then the soldier separ them and thei spoke no more
an hour pass and the process began it march along the triumphal
wai of it miriam could see littl all she knew wa that in front there
were rank of fetter prison while behind men carri upon
trai and tabl the golden vessel of the templ the sevenbranch
candlestick and the ancient sacr book of the jewish law thei were
follow by other men who bore aloft imag of victori in ivori and
gold then although these did not join them till thei reach the porta
triumphali or the gate of pomp attend each of them by lictor
have their fasc wreath with laurel came the csar first went
vespasian csar the father he rode in a splendid golden chariot to
which were har four white hors led by libyan soldier behind
him stood a slave clad in a dull robe set there to avert the influenc
of the evil ey and of the enviou god who held a crown abov the head
of the imper and now and again whisper in hi ear the omin
word respic post te hominem memento te look back at me and
rememb thy mortal
after vespasian csar the father came titu csar the son but hi
chariot wa of silver and grave upon it front wa a pictur of the
holi hous of the jew melt in the flame like hi father he wa
attir in the toga picta and tunica palmata the goldembroid
overrob and the tunic lace with silver leav while in hi right
hand he held a laurel bough and in hi left a sceptr he also wa
attend by a slave who whisper in hi ear the messag of mortal
next to the chariot of titu alongsid of it inde and as littl
behind as custom would allow rode domitian glorious arrai and
mount on a splendid steed then came the tribun and the knight
on horseback and after them the legionari to the number of five
thousand everi man of them have hi spear wreath in laurel
now the great process wa across the tiber and follow it
appoint path down broad street and past palac and templ drew
slowli toward it object the shrine of jupit capitolinu that stood
at the head of the sacr wai beyond the forum everywher the side
path the window of hous the great scaffold of timber and the
step of templ were crowd with spectat never befor did miriam
understand how mani peopl could inhabit a singl citi thei pass them
by thousand and by ten of thousand and still far as the ey could
reach stretch the white sea of face ahead that sea would be quiet
then as the process pierc it it began to murmur present
the murmur grew to a shout the shout to a roar and when the csar
appear in their glitter chariot the roar to a triumphant peal
which shook the street like thunder and so on for mile and mile till
miriam ey were dim with the glare and glitter and her head swam at
the ceaseless sound of shout
often the process would halt for a while either becaus of a check
to on of the pageant in front or in order that some of it member
might refresh themselv with drink which wa brought to them then the
crowd ceas from it cheer would make joke and criticis whatev
person or thing thei chanc to be near greatli did thei criticis
miriam in thi fashion or at the least she thought so who must
listen to it all most of them she found knew her by her name of
pearlmaiden and point out to each other the necklac about her
throat mani too had heard someth of her stori and look eagerli
at the pictur of the gate nicanor blazon upon her breast but the
greater part concern themselv onli with her delic beauti pass
from mouth to mouth the gossip concern domitian hi quarrel with the
csar and the intent which he had announc of bui thi captiv
at the public sale alwai it wa the same talk sometim more brutal
and open than othersthat wa the onli differ
onc thei halt thu in the street of palac through which thei pass
near to the bath of agrippa here the endless comment began again but
miriam tri to shut her ear to it and look about her to her left
wa a noblelook hous built of white marbl but she notic that
it shutter were close also that it wa undecor with garland
and idli wonder why other wonder too for when thei had weari
of discuss her point she heard on plebeian ask anoth whose hous
that wa and why it had been shut up upon thi festal dai hi fellow
answer that he could not rememb the owner name but he wa a rich
nobl who had fallen in the jewish war and that the palac wa close
becaus it wa not yet certain who wa hi heir
at that moment her attent wa distract by a sound of groan and
laughter come from behind she look round to see that the wretch
jewish gener simon had sunk faint to the ground overcom by
the heat or the terror of hi mind or by the suffer which he wa
forc to endur at the hand of hi cruel guard who flog him as
he walk for the pleasur of the peopl now thei were beat him to
life again with their rod henc the laughter of the audienc and the
groan of the victim sick at heart miriam turn awai from thi horrid
sight to hear a tall man whose back wa toward her but who wa clad
in the rich robe of an eastern merchant ask on of the marshal of
the triumph in a foreign accent whether it wa true that the captiv
pearlmaiden wa to be sold that even in the auctionmart of the
forum the marshal answer ye such were the order as regard her
and the other women sinc there wa no conveni place to hous them
and it wa thought best to be rid of them and let their master take
them home at onc
doe she pleas you sir ar you go to bid he ad if so you
will find yourself in high compani
perhap perhap answer the man with a shrug of hi shoulder
then he vanish into the crowd
now for the first time that dai miriam spirit seem to fail her
the weari of her bodi the foul talk the fouler cruelti the cold
discuss of the sale of human be to the firstcom as though thei
were sheep or swine the fear of her fate that night press upon and
overcam her mind so that she felt inclin like simon the son of
giora to sink faint to the pavement and lie there till the cruel
rod beat her to her feet again hope sank low and faith grew dim while
in her heart she wonder vagu what wa the mean of it all and
why poor men and women were made to suffer thu for the pleasur of
other men and women wonder also what escap there could be for her
while she muse thu like a rai of light through the cloud a sens
of consol sweet as it wa sudden seem to pierc the dark
of her bitter thought she knew not whenc it came nor what it might
portend yet it exist and the sourc of it seem near to her she
scan the face of the crowd find piti in a few curios in
more but in most gross admir if thei were men or scorn of her
misfortun and jealousi of her loveli if thei were women not from
among these did that consol flow she look up to the sky half
expect to see there that angel of the lord into whose keep the
bishop cyril had deliv her but the ski were empti and brazen
as the face of the roman crowd not a cloud could be seen in them much
less an angel
as her ey sank earthward their glanc fell upon on of the window of
the marbl hous to her left if she rememb right some few minut
befor the shutter of that window had been close now thei were open
reveal two heavi curtain of blue embroid silk miriam thought
thi strang and without seem to do so kept her ey fix upon
the curtain present for her sight wa good she saw finger between
themlong darkcolour finger then veri slowli the curtain were
part and in the open thu made appear a face the face of an old
woman dark and nobl look and crown with snowwhit hair even at
that distanc miriam knew it in an instant
oh heaven it wa the face of nehushta nehushta whom she thought dead
or at least for ever lost for a moment miriam wa paralys wonder
whether thi wa not some vision born of the turmoil and excit of
that dread dai nai sure it wa no vision sure it wa nehushta
herself who look at her with love ey for see she made the sign
of the cross in the air befor her the symbol of christian hope and
greet then laid her finger upon her lip in token of secreci and
silenc the curtain close and she wa gone who not five second
befor had so mysteri appear
miriam knee gave wai beneath her and while the marshal shout
to the process to set forward she felt that she must sink to the
ground inde she would have fallen had not some woman in the crowd
step forward and thrust a goblet of wine into her hand sai
drink that pearlmaiden it will make your pale cheek even prettier
than thei ar
the word were coars but miriam look at the woman knew her for
on of the christian commun with whom she had worship in the
catacomb so she took the cup fear noth and drank it off then
new strength came to her and she went forward with the other on that
toilsom endless march
at length howev it did end an hour or so befor sunset thei had
pass mile of street thei had trodden the sacr wai border by
fane innumer and adorn with statu set on column and now
march up the steep slope that wa crown by the gloriou templ of
jupit capitolinu as thei began to climb it guard broke into their
line and seiz the chain that hung about the neck of simon drag
him awai
whither do thei take you ask miriam as he pass her
to what i desiredeath he answer and wa gone
now the csar dismount from their chariot took up their station
by altar at the head of the step while beneath them rank upon rank
gather all those who had share their triumph each compani in it
allot place then follow a long paus the multitud wait for
miriam knew not what present men were seen run from the forum up
a path that had been left open on of them carri in hi hand some
object wrap in a napkin arriv in face of the csar he threw
asid the cloth and held up befor them and in sight of all the peopl
the grizzli head of simon the son of giora by thi public murder of
a brave captain of their foe wa consumm the triumph of the roman
and at the sight of it red proof trumpet blew banner wave and from
half a million throat went up a shout of victori that seem to rend
the veri ski for the multitud wa drunk with the glori of it brutal
vengeanc
then silenc wa call and there befor the templ of jove the beast
were slain and the csar offer sacrific to the god that had given
them victori
thu end the triumph of vespasian and titu and with it the record
of the struggl of the jew against the iron beak and claw of the roman
eagl
chapter xxiii
the slaver
had miriam chanc to look out of her litter as she pass the templ
of isi escort by gallu and the guard befor dawn broke upon that
great dai of the triumph and had there been light to enabl her to see
she might have beheld two figur gallop into rome as fast as their
weari hors would carri them both rode after the fashion of men but
on of them wrap in an eastern garment that hid the face wa in
fact a woman
fortun favour us nehushta said the man in a strain voic at
least we ar in time for the triumph who might so easili have been
too late look yonder thei gather alreadi by octavian walk and
he point to the compani of soldier who hurri past them to the
meetingplac
ye ye my lord marcu we ar in time there go the eagl and
here come their prei and in her turn nehushta point to a guard
litterhad thei but known it the veri on that carri the belov
woman whom thei sought but whither now would you also march in the
train of titu
nai woman it is too late also i know not what would be my welcom
your welcom why you were hi friend and titu is faith to hi
friend
ay but perhap not to those who have been taken prison by the
enemi toward the commenc of the sieg that happen to a man i
knew he wa captur with a companion the companion the jew slew but
as he wa about to be behead upon the wall thi man slip from the
hand of the execution and leap from it escap with littl hurt
titu gave him hi life but dismiss him from hi legion why should i
fare better
that you were taken wa no fault of your who were struck senseless
and overwhelm
mayb but would that avail me the rule a good rule is that no roman
soldier should yield to an enemi if he is captur while insens
then on find hi wit he must slai himself as i should have striven
to do had i awaken to find myself in the hand of the jew but
thing fell out otherwis still i tell you nehushta that had it not
been for miriam i should not have turn my face to rome at ani rate
until i had receiv pardon and permiss from titu
what then ar your plan lord marcu
to go to my own hous near the bath of agrippa the triumph must pass
there and if miriam is among the captiv we shall see her if not
then either she is dead or alreadi sold or perchanc given as a present
to some friend of csar
now thei ceas talk for the peopl were so mani that thei could
onli forc their wai through the press ride on after the other thu
nehushta follow marcu thei cross the tiber and pass through
mani street decor most of them for the come pageant till at
length marcu drew rein in front of a marbl mansion in the via agrippa
a strang homecom he mutter follow me and he rode round the
hous to a sideentr
here he dismount and knock at the small door for some time without
avail at length it wa open a littl wai and a thin querul
voic speak through the crack said
begon whoever you ar no on live here thi is the hous of
marcu who is dead in the jewish war who ar you that disturb me
the heir of marcu
marcu ha no heir unless it be csar who doubtless will take hi
properti
open stephanu said marcu in a tone of command at the same time
push the door wide and enter fool he ad what kind of a
steward ar you that you do not know your master voic
now he who had kept the door a wither littl man in a scribe brown
robe peer at thi visitor with hi sharp ey then threw up hi
hand and stagger back sai
by the spear of mar it is marcu himself marcu return from the
dead welcom my lord welcom
marcu led hi hors through the deep archwai and when nehushta had
follow him into the courtyard beyond return close and lock the
door
why did you think me dead friend he ask
oh my lord answer the steward becaus all who have come home
from the war declar that you had vanish awai dure the sieg of the
citi of the jew and that you must either be dead or taken prison
now i knew well that you would never disgrac your ancient hous or
your own nobl name or the eagl which you serv by fall aliv
into the hand of the enemi therefor i wa sure that you were dead
marcu laugh bitterli then turn to nehushta said
you hear woman you hear if such is the judgment of my steward and
freedman what will be that of csar and my peer then he ad now
stephanu that what you thought impossiblewhat i myself should have
thought impossibleha happen i wa taken prison by the jew
though through no fault of mine
oh if so said the old steward hide it my lord hide it why two
such unhappi men who had surrend to save their live and were found
in some jewish dungeon have been condemn to walk in the triumph thi
dai their hand ar to be ti behind them in place of their sword
thei must wear a distaff and on their breast a placard with the word
written i am a roman who prefer dishonour to death you would not
wish their compani my lord
the face of marcu went first red then white
man he said ceas your illomen talk lest i should fall upon
my sword here befor your ey bid the slave make readi the bath and
food for we need both
slave my lord there ar none here save on old woman who attend
to me and the hous
where ar thei then ask marcu angrili
the most part of them i have sent into the countri think it better
that thei should work upon your estat rather than live here idl and
other who were not need i have sold
you were ever care stephanu then he ad by an afterthought
have you ani monei in the hous
the old steward look toward nehushta suspici and see that

she look at him sadli and answer

villag of the essen that thi is no matter of cast incens on an

quiver what need is there to insult a slave
the word seem to suggest a new train of thought to marcu
ye he said a slavemi slave whom i have bought at a great price
well why should i let you go i am mind to keep you
marcu you can keep me if you will but then your sin against your own
honour will be greater even than your sin against me
sin he said passion what sin you sai you cannot marri me
not becaus you do not wish it if i understand you right but for other
reason which have weight at ani rate with you but the dead give no
command as to whom you should love
no my love is my own but if it is not law it can be deni
why should it be deni he ask softli and come toward her is
there not much between you and me did not you brave and bless woman
that you ar risk your life for my sake in the old tower at jerusalem

drew her to hi breast
she did not struggl she had no strength onli she wrung her hand and

to draw her from the spirit if not from the letter of her duti so
great a coward ar you that you remind her even that she is your slave
and threaten to deal with her as you heathen deal with slave you put a
gloss upon the truth you try to filch the fruit you mai not pluck you
sai you mai not marri me but you ar my properti and therefor if you
give wai to your master it is no sin i tell you it is a sin doubli
a sin sinc you would bind the weight of it on her back as well as on
your own and a sin that in thi wai or in that would bring it reward
to both of you

from hi arm back upon the couch
no i have not finish i spoke of the fruit of evil now as my heart
prompt me i speak of the promis of good let thi woman go free as you
have the power to do strike the chain off her neck and take back the
price that you have paid for her sinc she ha properti which will
discharg it to the last farth which properti todai stand in her
name and can be convei to you then go search the scriptur and see
if you can find no messag in them if you find it well and good then
take her with a clean heart and be happi if you find it not well and
good then leav her with a clean heart and be sorrow for so it is

tonight is it not well nehushta you have the best of the argument
all you sai is quit true if a littl overcolour of cours miriam
is quit right not to marri me if she ha scrupl and of cours i
should be quit wrong to take advantag of the accid of my be abl

would do sinc no on know you belong to me i suppos that no formal
ceremoni will be necessari it is a manumiss inter amico as the

men he said take that woman and kill her no it might make a stir
as she wa on of tituss captiv dont kill her thrust her into the
street
the girl wa seiz by the arm and drag awai

the dread order wa obei and for a while noth wa heard save
the sound of heavi blow and the smother moan of the miser
saturiu
wretch yell the imperi brute you ar plai you do not hit
hard enough i will teach you how to hit and snatch a rod from on
of the slave he rush at hi prostrat chamberlain the other draw
back to allow their master to show hi skill in flog
saturiu saw domitian come and knew that unless he could chang hi
purpos in anoth minut the life would be batter out of him he
struggl to hi knee
princ he cri hearken er you strike you can kill me if you will
who ar justli anger and to die at your hand is an honour that i do
not merit yet dread lord rememb that if you slai me then you will
never find that pearlmaiden whom you desir
domitian paus for even in hi furi he wa cun doubtless he
thought the knave know where the girl is perhap even he ha hidden
her awai for himself
ah he said aloud quot the vulgar proverb the rod is the mother
of reason well can you find her
sure if i have time the man who can afford to pai two thousand
sestertia for a singl slave cannot easili be hidden
two thousand sestertia exclaim domitian astonish tell me that
stori slave give saturiu hi robe and fall backno not too far he
mai be treacher
the chamberlain threw the garment over hi bleed shoulder and
fasten it with a trembl hand then he told hi tale ad
oh my lord what could i do you have not enough monei at hand to pai
so huge a sum
do fool why you should have bought her on credit and left me
to settl the price afterward oh never mind titu i could have
outwit him but the mischief is done now for the remedi so far as
it can be remedi he ad grind hi teeth
that i must seek tomorrow lord
tomorrow and what will you do tomorrow
tomorrow i will find where the girl gone or try to and thenwhi
he who ha bought her might die andth rest will be easi
die he sure shall be who ha dare to rob domitian of hi darl
answer the princ with an oath well hearken saturiu for thi
night you ar spare but be sure that if you fail for the second time
you also shall die and after a wors fashion than i promis you now
go and tomorrow we will take counsel oh ye god why do you deal
so hardli with domitian my soul is bruis and must be comfort with
poesi rous that greek from hi bed and send him to me he shall read
to me of the wrath of achil when thei rob him of hi brisei for
the hero lot is mine
so thi new achil depart now that hi rage had left him weep
maudlin tear of disappoint passion to comfort hi bruis soul
with the immort line of homer for when he wa not mere a brute
domitian fanci himself a poet it wa perhap as well for hi peac
of mind that he could not see the face of saturiu as the chamberlain
comfort hi bruis shoulder with some servic ointment or hear
the oath which that us and industri offic utter as he sought
hi rest face downward sinc for mani dai thereaft he wa unabl
to lie upon hi back it wa a veri ugli oath sworn by everi god who
had an altar in rome with the divin of the jew and the christian
thrown in that in a dai to come he would aveng domitian rod with
dagger had the princ been abl to do so there might have risen in
hi mind some prescienc of a certain scene in which he must plai a
part on a faroff but destin night he might have beheld a vision of
himself bald corpul and thinleg but wear the imperi robe
of csar roll in a frantic struggl for life upon the floor of hi
bedchamb at death grip with on stephanu while an old chamberlain
name saturiu drove a dagger again and again into hi back cry at
each stroke
oho that for thy rod csar oho dost rememb the pearlmaiden
that for thy rod csar and thatand thatand that
but domitian weep himself to sleep over the tale of the wrong of
the godlik achil which did but foreshadow those of hi divin
self as yet thought noth of the rich reward that time should bring
him
on the morrow of the great dai of the triumph the merchant demetriu
of alexandria whom for mani year we have known as caleb sat in the
offic of the storehous which he had hire for the bestow of hi
good in on of the busiest thoroughfar of rome handsom inde
noblelook as he wa and must alwai be hi counten present
a sorri sight from hour to hour dure the previou dai he had fought a
path through the dens crowd that line the street of rome to keep as
near as might be to miriam while she trudg her long rout of splendid
shame
then came the even when with the other women slave she wa put
up to auction in the forum to prepar for thi sale caleb had turn
almost all hi merchandis into monei for he knew that domitian wa a
purchas and guess that the price of the beauti pearlmaiden of
whom all the citi wa talk would rule high the climax we know he
bid to the last coin that he possess or could rais onli to find that
other with still greater resourc were in the market even the agent
of the princ had been left behind and miriam wa at last knock down
to some mysteri stranger woman dress like a peasant the woman wa
veil and disguis she spoke with a feign voic and in a strang
tongu but from the begin caleb knew her incred as it might
seem that she should be here in rome he wa certain that she wa
nehushta and no other
that nehushta should bui miriam wa well but how came she by so vast a
sum of monei here in a faroff land in short for whom wa she bui
inde for whom would she bui he could think of on onlymarcu but
he had made inquiri and marcu wa not in rome inde he had everi
reason to believ that hi rival wa long dead that hi bone were
scatter among the ten of thousand which whiten the tumbl ruin
of the holi citi in juda how could it be otherwis he had last seen
him wound as he thought to deathand he should know for the stroke
fell from hi own handli senseless in the old tower in jerusalem
then he vanish awai and where marcu had been miriam wa found
whither did he vanish and if it wa true that she succeed in hide
him in some secret hole what chanc wa there that he could have
live on without food and unsuccour also if he live why had he
not appear long befor why wa not so wealthi a patrician and
distinguish a soldier ride in the triumphant train of titu
with black despair rage in hi breast he caleb had seen miriam
knock down to the mysteri basketladen stranger whom none could
recognis he had seen her depart togeth with the auction and
a servant also basketladen to the offic of the receiv hous
whither he had attempt to follow upon some pretext onli to be stop
by the watchman after thi he hung about the door until he saw the
auction appear alon when it occur to him that the purchas and
the purchas must have depart by some other exit perhap in order
to avoid further observ he ran round the build to find himself
confront onli by the empti starlit space of the forum search
them with hi ey for on instant it seem to him that far awai he
caught sight of a littl knot of figur climb a black marbl stair
in the dark shadow of some templ he sped across the open space he
ran up the great stair to find at the head of it a young man in whom he
recognis the auction clerk gaze along a wide street as empti
as wa the stair
the rest is known to us he follow and twice perceiv the littl
group of darkrob figur hurri round distant corner onc he
lost them altogeth but a passerbi on hi road to some feast told him
courteous enough which wai thei had gone on he ran almost at hazard
to be reward in the end by the sight of them vanish through a
narrow doorwai in the wall he came to the door and saw that it wa veri
massiv he tri it even it wa lock then he thought of knock
onli to rememb that to state hi busi would probabl be to meet
hi death at such a place and hour those who purchas beauti slave
might have a sword wait for the heart of an unsuccess rival who
dare to follow them to their haunt
caleb walk round the hous to find that it wa a palac which seem
to be desert although he thought that he saw light shine through
on of the shutter window now he knew the place again it wa here
that the process had halt and on of the roman soldier who had
commit the crime of be taken captiv escap the taunt of the
crowd by hurl himself beneath the wheel of a great pageant car ye
there wa no doubt of it for hi blood still stain the dusti stone
and by it lai a piec of the broken distaff with which in their
mockeri thei had gird the poor man thei were gentl folk these
roman why measur by thi standard some such doom would have fallen
upon hi rival marcu for marcu also wa taken prisonerbi himself
the thought made caleb smile sinc well he knew that no braver soldier
live then came other thought that press him closer somewher in
that great deadlook hous wa miriam as far off from him as though
she were still in juda there wa miriamand who wa with her the
newfound lord who had spent two thousand sestertia on her purchas the
thought of it almost turn hi brain
heretofor the life of caleb had been rule by two passionsambit
and the love of miriam he had aspir to be ruler of the jew perhap
their king and to thi end had plot and fought for the expuls of
the roman from juda he had taken part in a hundr desper battl
again and again he had risk hi life again and again he had escap
for on so young he had reach high rank till he wa number among
the first of their captain
then came the end the last hideou struggl and the downfal onc more
hi life wa left in him where men perish by the hundr thousand he
escap win safeti not through the desir of it but becaus of
the love of miriam which drove him on to follow her happili for himself
he had hidden monei which after the gift of hi race he wa abl to
turn to good account so that now he who had been a leader in war
and council walk the world as a merchant in eastern good all that
glitter past had gone from him he might becom wealthi but jew as
he wa he could never be great nor fill hi soul with the glori that
it crave there remain to him then noth but thi passion for
on woman among the million who dwelt beneath the sun the girl who had
been hi playmat whom he love from the begin although she had
never love him and whom he would love until the end
why had she not love him becaus of hi rival that accurs roman
marcu the man whom time upon time he had tri to kill but who had
alwai slip like water from hi hand well if she wa lost to him
she wa lost to marcu also and from that thought he would take such
comfort as he might inde he had no other for dure those dread
hour the fire of all gehenna rage in hi soul he had lostbut who
had found her
throughout the long night caleb tramp round the cold emptylook
palac suffer perhap as he had never suffer befor a thing to
be piti of god and men at length the dawn broke and the light crept
down the splendid street show here and there group of weari and
halfdrunken revel stagger homeward from the feast flush
men and dishevel women other appear also humbl and industri
citizen go to their daili toil among them were peopl whose
busi it wa to clean the road abroad earli thi morn for after
the great process thei thought that thei might find articl of valu
let fall by those who walk in it or by the spectat two of
these scaveng began sweep near the place where caleb stood and
lighten their toil by laugh at him ask him if he had spent hi
night in the gutter and whether he knew hi wai home he repli that he
wait for the door of the hous to be open
which hous thei ask the fortun hous and thei point to
the marbl palac of marcu which as caleb now saw for the first time
had these word blazon in gold letter on it portico
he nod
well said on of them you will wait for some time for that hous
is no longer fortun it owner is dead kill in the war and no
on know who hi heir mai be
what wa hi name he ask
marcu the favourit of nero also call the fortun
then with a bitter curs upon hi lip caleb turn and walk awai
chapter xxvi
the judgment of domitian
two hour had gone by and caleb with furi in hi heart sat brood in
the offic attach to the warehous that he had hire at that moment

escap and return to rome of that there could be no doubt he on
of the wealthiest of it patrician had furnish the vast sum which

then hi newli acquir properti had been taken to thi hous where he
await her thi then wa the end of their long rivalri for thi he
caleb had fought toil scheme and suffer oh rather than such a
thing should be in that dark hour of hi soul he would have seen her
cast to the foul domitian for domitian at least she would have hate
wherea marcu he knew she love
now there remain noth but reveng reveng he must be but how
he might dog marcu and murder him onli then hi own life would be
hazard sinc he knew well the fate that await the foreign and
most of all the jew who dare to lift hi hand against a roman nobl
and if he hire other to do the work thei might bear evid against
him now caleb did not wish to die life seem the onli good that he
had left also while he live he might still win miriamaft hi
rival had ceas to live doubtless then she would be sold with hi
other slave and he could bui her at the rate such tarnish good
command no he would do noth to run himself into danger he would
wait wait and watch hi opportun
it wa near at hand for of old as todai the king of evil wa ever
readi to aid those who call upon him with suffici earnest
inde even as caleb sat there in hi offic there came a knock upon
the door
open he cri savag and through it enter a small man with
closecrop hair and a keen hard face which seem familiar to him
just now howev that face wa somewhat damag for on of the
ey had been blacken and a wound upon the templ wa strap
with plaster also it owner walk lame and continu twitch hi
shoulder as though thei gave him uneasi the stranger open hi
lip to speak and caleb knew him at onc he wa the chamberlain of
domitian who had been outbid by nehushta in the slave ring

wai of eastern shawl for instanc
i thank you friend no i come to speak of shoulder not shawl and
he twitch hi ownwomen shoulder i mean a remark fine pair
for their size had that jewish captiv by the wai in whom you seem
to take an interest last nightto the consider extent inde of
fourteen hundr sestertia
ye said caleb thei were well shape
then follow a paus
perhap as i am a busi man suggest caleb present you would not
mind come to the point
certainli i wa but wait for your leav as you mai have heard i
repres a veri nobl person
who i think took an interest in the captiv to the extent of fifteen
hundr sestertia suggest caleb

i should sai that it is transfer
to the gentleman whose deep feel induc him to provid five hundr
more queri caleb

endow her son
suppos you put the matter plainli worthi saturiu
i will excel demetriu the great person to whom i have allud
wa so move when he heard of hi loss that he actual burst into
tear and even reproach me whom he love more dearli than hi
brother
he might easili do that if all report ar true said caleb drili
ad wa it then that you met with your accid
it wa overcom at the sight of my royal master grief i fell down
into a well i suppos sinc you manag to injur your ey your

how to get it without ani scandal do you think that in return he would
leav me the ladi hand you see i knew her in her youth and take a

caleb read and scrutinis the letter
the signatur of domitian and of yourself as wit seem much alik
he remark suspici
somewhat repli saturiu with an airi gestur in royal hous
it is customari for chamberlain to imit the handwrit of their
imperi master
and their moralsno thei have nonetheir manner also comment
caleb
at the least went on saturiu you will acknowledg the seal
which might be borrow well i will take the risk for if there is
anyth wrong about these paper i am sure that the princ domitian
would not like to see them exhibit in a court of law
good answer saturiu with a relief which he could not altogeth
conceal and now for the culprit name
the culprit name said caleb lean forward and speak slowli
is marcu who serv as on of titu csar prefect of hors in
the campaign of juda he bought the ladi miriam commonli known as
pearlmaiden by the agenc of nehushta an old libyan woman who
convei her to hi hous in the via agrippa which is known as the
fortun hous where doubtless she now is
marcu said saturiu why he wa report dead and the matter of
the success to hi great estat is now be debat for he wa the
heir of hi uncl caiu the proconsul who amass a vast fortun
in spain also after the death of the said caiu thi marcu wa a
favourit of the late divin nero who constitut him guardian of some
bust of which he wa enamour in short he is a great man if as
you sai he still live whom even domitian will find it hard to meddl
with but how do you know all thi
through my friend caleb caleb follow the black hag nehushta and
the beauti pearlmaiden to the veri hous of marcu which he saw
them enter marcu who wa her lover yonder in juda
oh never mind the rest of the stori i understand it all but you have
not yet shown that marcu wa in the hous and if he wa bad tast as
it mai have been to bid against the princ domitian well at a public
auction it is law
yee but if marcu ha commit a crime could he not be punish
for that crime
without doubt but what crime ha marcu commit
the crime of be taken prison by the jew and escap from them
with hi life for which by an edict of titu whose law ar those
of the mede and persian the punish is death or at the least
banish and degrad
well and who can prove all thi
caleb can becaus he took him prison
and where ask saturiu in exasper where is thi thrice
accurs cur caleb
here answer demetriu i am caleb o thrice bless chamberlain
saturiu
inde said saturiu well that make thing more simpl and
now friend demetriusy prefer that name do you notwhat do you
propos
i propos that the necessari document should be procur which to
your master will not be difficult that marcu should be arrest in
hi hous put upon hi trial and condemn under the edict of titu
and that the girl pearlmaiden should be hand over to me who will
at onc remov her from rome
good said saturiu titu have gone leav domitian in charg of
militari affair the thing as it chanc is easi though ani sentenc
that mai be pass must be confirm by csar himself and now again
farewel if our man is in rome he shall be taken tonight and
tomorrow your evid mai be want
will the girl be hand over to me then
i think so repli saturiu but of cours i cannot sai for certain
as there mai be legal difficulti in the wai which would hinder her
immedi resal howev you mai reli upon me to do the best i can
for you
it will be to your advantag answer caleb significantli shall we
sayfifti sestertia on receipt of the slave
oh if you wish it if you wish it for gift cement the heart of
friend on account well to a man with mani expens five sestertia
alwai come in us you know what it is in these palac so littl
pai and so much to keep up thank you dear demetriu i will give you
and the ladi a supper out of the moneywhen you get her he ad to
himself as he left the offic
when earli on the follow morn caleb came to hi warehous from the
dwell where he slept he found wait for him two men dress in
the liveri of domitian who demand that he would accompani them to the
palac of the princ
what for
to give evid in a trial thei said
then he knew that he had made no mistak that hi rival wa caught and
in the rage of hi burn jealousi such jealousi as onli an eastern
can feel hi heart bound with joi still as he trudg onward
through street glitter in the morn sunlight caleb conscienc
told him that not thu should thi rival be overcom that he who went
to accus the brave marcu of cowardic wa himself a coward and that
from the lie which he wa about to act if not to speak could spring no
fruit of peac or happi but he wa mad and blind he could think
onli of miriamth woman whom he love with all hi passion natur
and whose life he had preserv at the risk of hi ownfallen at last
into the arm of hi rival he would wrench her thenc ye even at the
price of hi own honour and of her lifelong agoni and if it might be
leav those arm cold in death as often alreadi he had striven to do
when marcu wa dead perhap she would forgiv him at the least he
would occupi hi place she would be hi slave to whom notwithstand
all that had been he would give the place of wife then after a littl
while see how good and tender he wa to her sure she must forget
thi roman who had taken her girlish fanci and learn to love him
now thei were pass the door of the palac in the outer hall saturiu
met them and motion to the slave to stand back
so you have them said caleb eagerli
ye or to be exact on of them the ladi ha vanish
caleb stagger back a pace
vanish where
i wish that i could tell you i thought that perhap you knew at
least we found marcu alon in hi hous which he wa about to leav
appar to follow titu but come the court await you
if she ha gone why should i come said caleb hang back
i realli dont know but you must here slave escort thi wit
then see that it wa too late to chang hi mind caleb wave them
back and follow saturiu present thei enter an inner hall lofti
but not larg at the head of it clad in the purpl robe of hi royal
hous sat domitian in a chair while to hi right and left were narrow
tabl at which were gather five or six roman offic those of
domitian own bodyguard barehead but arrai in their mail also
there were two scribe with their tablet a man dress in a lawyer
robe who seem to fill the offic of prosecutor and some soldier on
guard

earnestli to the lawyer glanc up he saw him and ask
is that the jew who give evid saturiu

wit wait without
good then bring in the accus
there wa a paus till present caleb heard footstep behind him
and look round to see marcu advanc up the hall with a proud and
martial air their ey met and for an instant marcu stop
oh he said aloud the jew caleb now i understand then he march
forward and gave the militari salut to the princ
domitian stare at him with hate in hi pale ey and said carelessli
is thi the accus what is the charg
the charg is said the lawyer that the accus marcu a prefect
of hors serv with titu csar in juda suffer himself to be taken
prison by the jew when in command of a larg bodi of roman troop
contrari to the custom of the armi and to the edict issu by titu
csar at the commenc of the sieg of jerusalem thi edict
command that no soldier should be taken aliv and that ani soldier
who wa taken aliv and subsequ rescu or who made good hi
escap should be deem worthi of death or at the least of degrad
from hi rank and banish my lord marcu do you plead guilti to the
charg
first i ask said marcu what court is thi befor which i am
put upon my trial if i am to be tri i demand that it shall be by my
gener titu
then said the prosecutor you should have report yourself to
titu upon your arriv in rome now he ha gone to where he mai not
be troubl leav the charg of militari matter in the hand of
hi imperi brother the princ domitian who with these offic is
therefor your law judg
perhap broke in domitian with bitter malic the lord marcu wa
too much occupi with other pursuit on hi arriv in rome to find
time to explain hi conduct to the csar titu
i wa about to follow him to do so when i wa seiz said marcu
then you put the matter off a littl too long now you can explain it

morrow neither she nor the old woman were found there the accus he
might add wa arrest just as he wa about to leav the hous as

depart from rome thi wa the case in brief and to prove it he
call a certain jew name caleb who wa now live in rome have
receiv an amnesti given by the hand of titu thi jew wa now a
merchant who trade under the name of demetriu
then caleb stood forward and told hi tale in answer to question that

which fought an action with the roman troop at a place call the old
tower a few dai befor the captur of the templ in the cours

chapter xxvii
the bishop cyril
on the morn follow the dai of the triumph julia the wife of
gallu wa seat in her bedchamb look out at the yellow water
of the tiber that ran almost beneath it window she had risen at dawn
and attend to the affair of her household and now retir to rest
and prai mingl with the roman crowd on the yesterdai she had seen
miriam whom she love march wearili through the street of rome
then abl to bear no more she went home leav gallu to follow the
last act of the drama about nine oclock that night he join her and
told her the stori of the sale of miriam for a vast sum of monei sinc
stand in the shadow beyond the light of the torch he had been a
wit of the scene at the slavemarket domitian had been outbid and
their pearlmaiden wa knock down to an old woman with a basket on
her back who look like a witch after which she vanish with her
purchas that wa all he knew for certain julia thought it littl
enough and reproach her husband for hi stupid in not learn
more still although she seem to be vex at heart she rejoic
into whoever hand the maid had fallen for a while at least she had
escap the vile domitian
now as she sat and prai gallu be abroad to gather more tide
if he could she heard the courtyard door open but took no notic
of it think that it wa but the servant who return from market
present howev as she knelt a shadow fell upon her and julia
look up to see miriam none other than miriam and with her a
darkskin ag woman whom she did not know
how come you here she gasp
oh mother answer the girl in a low and thrill voic mother
by the merci of god and by the help of thi nehushta of whom i have
often told you andof anoth i am escap from domitian and return
to you free and unharm
tell me that stori said julia for i do not understand the thing
sound incred
so miriam told her tale when it wa done julia said
heathen though he is thi marcu must be a nobleheart man whom mai
heaven reward
ye answer miriam with a sigh mai heaven reward him as i wish i
might
as you would have done had i not stai you put in nehushta her
voic wa sever but as she spoke someth that julia took to be a
smile wa seen for an instant on her grim featur
well friend well said julia we have all of us fallen into
temptat from time to time
pardon me ladi answer nehushta but speak for yourself i never
fell into ani temptationfrom a man i know too much of men
then friend repli julia return thank for the good armour of
your wisdom for my part i sai that like the lord marcu thi maid
ha act well and my prayer is that she also mai not lose her reward
mine is comment nehushta that marcu mai escap the payment which
he will doubtless receiv from the hand of domitian if he can hunt him
out a remark at which the face of miriam grew veri troubl
just then gallu return and to him the whole histori had to be told
anew
it is wonder he said wonder i never heard the like of it
two peopl who love each other and who when their hour come separ
over some question of faith or rather in obedi to a command laid
upon on of them by a ladi who di year and year ago wonderfuland
i hope wise though had i been the man concern i should have taken
anoth counsel
what counsel husband ask julia
wellto get awai from rome with the ladi as far as possibl and
without more delai than wa necessari it seem to me that under the
circumst it would have been best for her to consid her scrupl
in anoth land you see domitian is not a christian ani more than
marcu is and our maid here doe not like domitian and doe like
marcu no it is no good argu the thing is done but i think that
you christian might veri well add two new saint to your calendar and
now to breakfast which we all need after so much night duti
so thei went and at but dure that meal gallu wa veri silent as
wa hi custom when he set hi brain to work present he ask
tell me miriam did ani see you or your companion enter here
no i think not she answer for as it chanc the door of the
courtyard wa ajar and the servant ha not yet return
good he said when she doe return i will meet her and send her out
on a long errand
why ask hi wife
becaus it is as well that none should know what guest we have till
thei ar gone again
until thei ar gone again repeat julia astonish sure you
would not drive thi maid who ha becom to us as our daughter from
your door
ye i would wife for that dear maid sake and he took miriam
littl hand in hi great palm and press it listen now he went on
miriam the jewish captiv ha dwelt in our care these mani month
ha she not as is known to all is it not well if ani on want to
find her where will thei begin by look
ay where echo nehushta
why should ani on wish to find her ask julia she wa bought in
the slavemarket for a great price by the lord marcu who of hi own
will ha set her at liberti now therefor she is a free woman whom
none can touch
a free woman answer gallu with scorn is ani woman free in rome
upon whom domitian ha set hi mind sure you christian ar too
innoc for thi world peac now for there is no time to lose julia
do you cloak yourself and go seek that highpriest of your cyril who
also love thi maid tell the tale to him and sai that if he would
save her from great danger he had best find some secret hidingplac
among the christian for her and her companion until mean can be
found to ship them far from rome what think you of that plan my libyan
friend
i think that it is good but not good enough answer nehushta i
think that we had best depart with the ladi your wife thi veri hour
for who can tell how soon the dog will be laid upon our slot
and what sai you maid miriam ask gallu
i oh i thank you for your thought and i saylet us hide in ani
place you will even a drain or a stabl if it will save me from
domitian
two hour later in a humbl and dens peopl quarter of the citi
such as in our own dai we should call a slum where folk were emploi
make those articl which minist to the comfort or the luxuri of
the more fortun a certain mastercarpent known as septimu wa
seat at hi middai meal in a littl chamber abov hi workshop
hi hand were rough with toil and the dust of hi trade wa upon hi
garment and even powder over hi long grai beard so that at first
sight it would not have been easi to recognis in him that cyril who wa
a bishop among the christian yet it wa he on of the foremost of the
faith in rome
a woman enter the room and spoke with him in a low voic
the dame julia the wife of gallu and two other with her he said
well we need fear none whom she bring lead them hither
present the door open and julia appear follow by two veil
figur he rais hi hand to bless her then check himself
daughter who ar these he said
declar yourselv said julia and at her bid miriam and nehushta
unveil
at the sight of miriam face the bishop start then turn to studi
that of her companion
who vouch for thi woman he ask
i vouch for myself answer nehushta see that i am a christian
who receiv baptism a gener sinc at the hand of the holi john
and who stood to pai the price of faith in the arena at csarea
is thi so ask the bishop of miriam
it is so she answer thi libyan wa the servant of my
grandmoth she nurs both my mother and myself and mani a time ha
save my life have no fear she is faith
your pardon said the bishop with a grave smile and address
nehushta but you who ar old will know that the christian who
entertain stranger sometim entertain a devil then he lift up
hi hand and bless them greet them in the name of their master
so maid miriam he said still smile it would seem that i wa no
fals prophet and though you walk in the triumph and were sold in the
slaveringfor thi much i have heardstil the angel of the lord went
with you
father he went with me she answer and he lead me here
then thei told him all the tale and how miriam sought a refug from
domitian he look at her stroke hi long beard
is there anyth you can do he ask anyth us i mean but
perhap that is a foolish question see that womenespeci those
who ar wellfavoureddo not learn a trade
i have learnt a trade answer miriam flush a littl onc i
wa held of some account as a sculptor inde i have heard that your
emperor nero decre divin honour to a bust from my hand
the bishop laugh outright the emperor nero well the poor madman
ha gone to hi own place so let us sai no more of him but i heard of
that bust inde i saw it it wa a like of marcu fortunatu wa
it not and in it fashion a great work but our peopl do not make such
thing we ar artisan not artist
the artisan should be an artist said miriam set her mouth
perhap but as a rule he isnt do you think that you could mould
lamp
there is noth i should like better that is if i am not forc to
copi on pattern she ad as an afterthought
then said the bishop i think daughter that i can show you how to
earn a live where none ar like to seek for you
not a hundr pace awai from the carpent shop where the master
craftsman septimu work wa anoth manufactori in which vase
basin lamp and all such articl were design mould and bake
the custom who frequent the place wholesal merchant for the most
part note from and after the dai of thi interview a new workwoman
who so far as her rough blous permit them to judg seem to be
young and pretti seat in a corner apart beneath a window by the
light of which she labour later on thei observ also those of them
who had ani tast that among the lamp produc by the factori appear
some of singular and charm design so good inde that although the
maker reap littl extra benefit the middlemen found no difficulti
in dispos of these piec at a high price all dai long miriam sat
fashion them while old nehushta who had learnt someth of the
task year ago by jordan prepar and temper the clai and carri the
finish work to the furnac
now though none would have guess it in thi workshop all the
labour were christian and the product of their toil wa cast into
a common treasuri on the proce of which thei live take each of
them such share as their elder might decre and give the surplu to
brethren who had need or to the sick connect with these shop were
lodg hous mean enough to look at but clean within at the top
of on of them up three flight of narrow stair miriam and nehushta
dwelt in a larg attic that wa veri hot when the sun shone on the
roof and veri cold in the bitter wind and rain of winter in other
respect howev the room wa not unpleas sinc be so high
there were few smell and littl nois also the air that blew in at the
window wa fresh and odor of the open land beyond the citi
so there thei dwelt in peac for none came to search for the costli and
beauti pearlmaiden in those squalid court occupi by work
folk of the meaner sort by dai thei labour and at night thei rest
minist and minist to in the commun of christian brotherhood
and notwithstand their fear and anxieti for themselv and
anoth were happier than thei had been for year so the week went
by
veri soon tide came to them for these christian knew of all that
pass in the great citi also when thei met in the catacomb at night
as wa their custom especi upon the lord dai julia gave them
new from her thei learn that thei had done wise to flee her hous
within three hour of their departur inde befor julia had return
there offic arriv to inquir whether thei had seen anyth of the
jewish captiv name pearlmaiden who had been sold in the forum on the
previou night and as thei said escap from her purchas on whose
behalf thei search gallu receiv them and not be a christian
li boldli vow that he had seen noth of the girl sinc he gave
her over into the charg of the servant of csar upon the morn
of the triumph so suspect no guil thei depart and troubl hi
household no more
from the palac of domitian marcu wa taken to hi prison near the
templ of mar here becaus of hi wealth and rank becaus also he
made appeal to csar and wa therefor as yet uncondemn of ani crime
he found himself well treat two good room were given him to live in
and hi own steward stephanu wa allow to attend him and provid
him with food and all he need also upon give hi word that he would
attempt no escap he wa allow to walk in the garden between the
prison and the templ and to receiv hi friend at ani hour of the
dai hi first visitor wa the chamberlain saturiu who began by
condol with him over hi misfortun and most undeserv posit
marcu cut him short
why am i here he ask
becaus most nobl marcu you have been so unlucki as to incur the
displeasur of a veri power man
why doe domitian persecut me he ask again
how innoc ar you soldier said the chamberlain i will answer
your question by anoth why do you bui beauti captiv upon whom
royalti chanc to have set it heart
marcu thought a moment then said is there ani wai out of thi
troubl
my lord marcu i came to show you on nobodi realli believ that you
of all men fail in your duti out there in jerusalem why the thing
is absurd as even those carpetcaptain befor whom you were tri knew
well still your posit is most awkward there is evid against
youof a sort vespasian will not interfer for he is awar that thi
is some privat matter of domitian and have had on quarrel with
hi son over the captiv pearlmaiden he doe not wish for anoth
over the man who bought her no he will saythi prefect wa on of
the friend and offic of titu let titu settl the affair as it mai
pleas him when he return
at least titu will do me justic said marcu
ye without doubt but what will that justic be titu issu an
edict have you ever known him to go back upon hi edict even to save
a friend titu declar throughout hi own camp those roman who were
taken prison by the jew to be worthi of death or disgrac and two of
them common men and coward have been publicli disgrac in the ey
of rome you were taken prison by the jew and have return aliv
unfortun for yourself to incur the dislik of domitian who ha
rake up a matter that otherwis never would have been moot
now he sai to titusshow justic and no favour as you show in
the case of the captiv pearlmaiden whom you refus to the prayer
of your onli brother sai that she must be sold accord to your
decre even if he love you dearli as i believ he doe what my lord
marcu can titu answer to that argument especi as he also seek
no further quarrel with domitian
you said you came to show me a wai to safetyyet you tell me that my
feet ar set in the path of disgrac and death must thi wai of your
then be pave with gold
no answer saturiu drili with pearl oh i will be plain give
up that necklaceand it wearer what do you answer
now marcu understood and a sai that he heard on the lip of miriam
aros in hi mind though he knew not whenc it came
i answer he said with set face and flash ey that i will not
cast pearl befor swine
a pretti messag from a prison to hi judg repli the chamberlain
with a curiou smile but have no fear nobl marcu it shall not
be deliv i am not paid to tell my royal master the truth think
again
i have thought answer marcu i do not know where the maiden is
and therefor cannot deliv her to domitian nor would i if i could
rather will i be disgrac and perish
i suppos muse saturiu that thi is what thei call true love
and to speak plainli he ad with a burst of candour i find it
admir and worthi of a nobl roman my lord marcu my mission ha
fail yet i prai that the fate mai order your deliver from
your enemi and in reward for these persecut bring back to you
unharm that maiden whom you desir but whom i go to seek farewel
two dai later stephanu the steward of marcu who wait upon him in
hi prison announc that a man who said hi name wa septimu wish
speech with him but would sai noth of hi busi
admit him said marcu for i grow weari of my own compani and
let hi head fall upon hi hand he stare through the bar of hi
prison window
present he heard a sound behind him and look round to see an old
man clad in the robe of a masterworkman whose pure and nobl face
seem in a strang contrast to hi rough garment and toilscar
hand
be seat and tell me your busi said marcu courteous and with
a bow hi visitor obei
my busi my lord marcu he said in an educ and refin voic
is to minist to those who ar in troubl
then sir your feet have led you aright answer marcu with a
sad laugh for thi is the hous of troubl and you see i am it
inhabit
i know and i know the caus
marcu look at him curious ar you a christian sir he ask
nai do not fear to answer i have friend who ar christian and he
sigh nor could i harm you if i would who wish to harm none least
of all a christian
my lord marcu i fear hurt at no man hand also the dai of nero
have gone by and vespasian reign who molest us not i am cyril a
bishop of the christian in rome and if you will hear me i am come to
preach to you my faith which i trust mai yet be your
marcu stare at the man it wa to him a matter of amaz that thi
priest should take so much troubl for a stranger then a thought struck
him and he ask
what fee do you charg for these lesson in a new religion
the bishop pale face flush
sir he answer if you wish to reject my messag do it without
insult i do not sell the grace of god for lucr
again marcu wa impress
your pardon he said yet i have known priest take monei though it
is true thei were never of your faith who told you about me
on my lord marcu to whom you have behav well answer cyril
grave
marcu sprang from hi seat
do you meando you mean he began and paus look round him
fearfulli
ye repli the bishop in a whisper i mean miriam fear not she
and her companion ar in my charg and for the present safe seek to
know no more lest perchanc their secret should be wrung from you i
and her brethren in the lord will protect her to the last
marcu began to pour out hi thank
thank me not interrupt cyril for what is at onc my duti and my
joi
friend cyril said marcu the maid is in great danger i have just
learn that domitian spi hunt through rome to find her who when
she is found will be spirit to hi palac and a fate that you can
guess she must escap from rome let her fly to tyre where she ha
friend and properti there if she li hid a while she will be
molest by none
the bishop shook hi head
i have thought of it he said but it is scarc possibl the
offic at everi port have order to search all ship that sail with
passeng and detain ani woman on them who answer to the descript
of her who wa call pearlmaiden thi i know for certain for i also
have my offic more faith perhap than those of csar and he
smile
is there then no mean to get her out of rome and across the sea
i can think of onli on which would cost more monei than we poor
christian can command it is that a ship be bought in the name of some
merchant and man with sailor who can be trust such as i know how
to find then she could be taken aboard at night for on such a vessel
there would be no right of search nor ani to betrai
find the ship and trusti men and i will find the monei said marcu
for i still have gold at hand and the mean of rais more
i will make inquiri answer cyril and speak with you further on
the matter inde it is not necessari that you should give thi monei
sinc such a ship and her cargo if she come there safe should sell
at a great profit in the eastern port meanwhil have no fear in the
protect of god and her brethren the maid is safe
i hope so said marcu devoutli now if you have the time to spare
tell me of thi god of whom you christian speak so much but who seem
so far awai from man
but who in the word of the great apostl my master in truth is
not far from ani on of us answer cyril now hearken and mai your
heart be open
then he began hi labour of convers reason till the sun sank and
it wa time for the prison gate to close
come to me again said marcu as thei part i would hear more
of miriam or of my messag ask cyril with a smile
of both answer marcu
four dai went by befor cyril return thei were heavi dai for
marcu sinc on the morrow of the bishop visit he had learn that
as saturiu had foretold vespasian refus to consid hi case sai
that it must abid the decis of titu when he came back to rome
meanwhil he command that the accus offic should remain in
prison but that no judgment should issu against him here then
marcu wa doom to lie fret out hi heart like a lion in a cage
from cyril marcu learn that miriam wa well and sent him her
greet sinc she dare neither visit him nor write the bishop told
him also that he had found a certain grecian marin hector by name
a roman citizen who wa a christian and faith thi man desir
to sail for the coast of syria and wa compet to steer a vessel
thither also he thought that he could collect a crew of christian and
jew who might be trust lastli he knew of sever small gallei that
were for sale on of which name the luna wa a veri good ship and
almost new cyril told him moreov that he had seen gallu and hi
wife julia and that these good peopl have no more ti in rome
partli becaus thei desir to leav the citi and partli for love of
miriam though more the second reason than the first were will to
sell their hous and good and to sail with her to syria
marcu ask how much monei would be need and when cyril name the
sum sent for stephanu and command him to rais it and to pai it
over to the craftsman septimu take hi receipt in discharg thi
septimu promis to do readili enough by a certain dai believ that
the gold wa need for hi master ransom then have settl all as
well as might be cyril took up hi tale and preach to marcu of the
saviour of the world with great earnest and power
thu the dai went on and twice or thrice in everi week cyril visit
marcu give him tide and instruct him in the faith now the
ship luna wa bought and the most of her crew hire also a cargo of
such good as would be salabl in syria wa be laid into her hold at
ostia the greek hector give it out that thi wa a privat ventur
of hi own and some other merchant as the man wa well known for
a bold trader who had bought and sold in mani land hi tale caus
neither wonder nor suspicion none know that the capit wa
furnish by the steward of the prison marcu through him who pass
as the master craftsman and contractor septimu inde until the after
dai miriam did not know thi herself for it wa kept from her by the
special command of marcu and if nehushta guess the truth she held
her tongu
two full month had gone by marcu still languish in prison for
titu had not yet return to rome but as he learn from cyril
domitian weari somewhat of hi fruitless search for miriam although
he still vow vengeanc against the rival who had rob him the ship
luna wa laden and readi for sea inde if the wind and weather
were favour she wa to sail within a week gallu and julia have
wound up their affair had remov to ostia whither miriam wa to be
brought secretli on the night of the sail of the luna marcu wa
now at heart a christian but as yet had refus to accept baptism thu
matter stood when cyril visit the prison bring with him miriam
farewel messag to her lover it wa veri short
tell marcu she said that i go becaus he bid me and that i know
not whether we shall meet again sai that perhap it is best that we
should not meet sinc for reason which he know even if he should
still wish it we mai not marri sai that in life or death i am hi and
hi onli and that until my last hour my thought and prayer will be for
him mai he be deliv from all those troubl which as i fear i
have brought upon him through no will of mine mai he forgiv me for
them and let my love and gratitud make some amend for all that i have
done amiss
to thi marcu answer tell miriam that from my heart i thank her for
her messag and that my desir is that she should be gone from rome so
soon as mai be sinc here danger dog her step tell her that although
it is true that mine ha brought me shame and sorrow still i give her
love for love and that if i come live from my prison i will follow
her to tyre and speak further of these matter if i die i prai that
good fortun mai attend her and that from time to time she will make the
offer of an hour thought to the spirit which onc wa marcu

the lamp
if domitian at length slacken in hi fruitless search for miriam
caleb whose whole heart wa in the hunt prove more dilig still
he could find no trace of her at first he made sure that if she wa in
rome she would return to visit her friend and protector gallu
and hi wife and in the hope of thu discov her caleb caus a
constant watch to be kept on their abod but miriam never came there
nor although their footstep were dog from dai to dai did thei lead
him to her sinc in truth julia and miriam met onli in the catacomb
where he and hi spi dare not ventur soon howev gallu
discov that hi home wa kept under observ and it inmat
track from place to place it wa thi knowledg inde which more
than ani other circumst brought him to make up hi mind to depart
from rome and dwell in syria sinc he said that he would no longer live
in a citi where night by night he and hi were hunt like jackal but
when he left for ostia to wait there till the ship luna wa readi
caleb follow him and in that small town soon found out all hi plan
learn that he meant to sail with hi wife in the vessel then as he
could hear noth of miriam he return to rome
after all it wa by chanc that he discov her and not through hi
own clever need a lamp for hi chamber he enter a shop where
such thing were sold and examin those that the merchant offer to
him present he perceiv on of the strang design of two palm with
intertwin trunk and featheri head nod apart have a lamp
hang by a littl chain from the topmost frond of each of them the
shape of the tree struck him as familiar and he let hi ey run down
their stem until it reach the base which to support so tall a
piec wa larg ye the palm grew upon a littl bank and there
beneath the water rippl while between bank and water wa a long
smooth stone point at on end then in a flash caleb recognis the
place as well he might see that on mani and mani an even had
he and miriam sat side by side upon that stone angl for fish in the
muddi stream of jordan there wa no doubt about it and look half
hidden in the shadow of the stone lai a great fish the biggest that
ever he had caughth could swear to it for it back fin wa split
a mist came befor caleb ey and in it across the year he saw
himself a boi again there he stood hi rod of reed bent doubl and the
thin line strain almost to break while on the water of jordan a
great fish splash and roll
i cannot pull him in he cri the line will never bear it and the
bank is steep oh miriam we shall lose him
then there wa a splash and behold the girl at hi side had sprung
into the swiftli run river though it water reach to her neck
wash her down the stream she hug to her young breast that great
slipperi fish ye and grip it back fin between her teeth till
with the aid of hi reed rod he drew them both to land
i will bui that lamp said caleb present the design pleas me
what artist made it
the merchant shrug hi shoulder
sir i do not know he answer these good ar suppli to us with
mani other such as joineri and carv by on septimu who is a
contractor and thei sai a head priest among the christian emploi
mani hand at hi shop in the poor street yonder on or more of them
must be design of tast sinc of late we have receiv from him some
lamp of great beauti
then the man wa call awai to attend to anoth custom and caleb
paid for hi lamp
that even at dusk caleb bear the lamp in hi hand found hi

factori where lamp were mould wa alreadi close a girl who had just
shut the door see him stand perplex befor it ask civilli if
she could help him
maiden he answer i am in troubl who wish to find her who mould

work for the dai
ye said the maiden look at the lamp which evid she
recognis it is pretti is it not well cannot you return
tomorrow
ala no i expect to be leav rome for a while so i fear that i
must go elsewher
the girl reflect to herself that it would be a piti if the order were
lost and with it the commiss which she might divid with the maker
of the lamp it is against the rule but i will show you where she
live she said and if she is there which is probabl for i have
never seen her or her companion go out at night you can tell her your
wish
caleb thank the girl and follow her through sundri tortuou lane to
a court surround by old hous
if you go in there she said point to a certain doorwai and
climb to the top of the stair i forget whether there ar three or four
flight you will find the maker of the lamp in the roofroomsoh
sir i thank you but i expect noth goodnight
at length caleb stood at the head of the stair which were both steep
narrow and in the dark hard to climb befor him at the end of a
ricketi land a small illfit door stood ajar there wa light
within the room beyond and from it came a sound of voic caleb crept
up to the door and listen for as the floor below wa unten he
knew that none could see him bend down he look through the space
between the door and it framework and hi heart stood still there
stand full in the lamplight cloth in a pure white robe for her
rough work dress lai upon a stool besid her wa miriam herself
her elbow lean on the curtain windowplac she wa talk to
nehushta who her back bent almost doubl over a littl charcoal fire
wa engag in cook their supper
think she wa sai onli think nou our last night in thi
hate citi and then instead of that stifl workshop and the terror
of domitian the open sea and the fresh salt wind and nobodi to fear but
god luna is it not a beauti name for a ship i can see her all
silver
peac said nehushta ar you mad girl to talk so loud i though i
heard a sound upon the stair just now
it is onli the rat answer miriam cheerfulli no on ever come up
here i tell you that were it not for marcu i could weep with joi
caleb crept back to the head of the stair and down sever step which
he began to reascend noisili grumbl at their gloom and steep
then befor the women even had time to shut the door he thrust it wide
and walk straight into the room
your pardon he began then ad quietli why miriam when we
part on the gate nicanor who could have foretold that we should live
to meet again here in a roman attic and you nehushta why we were
separ in the frai outsid the templ wall though inde i
think that i saw you in a strang place some month ago name the
slaver on the forum
caleb ask miriam in a hollow voic what is your busi here
well miriam it began with a desir for a replica of thi lamp which
remind me of a spot familiar to my childhood do you rememb it now
that i have found who is the lamp maker

have smelt out the quarri well she is helpless but on is strong and
mai hi vengeanc fall upon your life and soul
suddenli nehushta voic that had risen to a scream di awai and
she stood befor him threaten him with her boni fist and search
hi face with her burn ey a vengeanc incarn
peac woman peac said caleb shrink back befor her spare
your reproach if i have sin much it is becaus i have love
more
and hate most of all ad nehushta
oh caleb broke in miriam if as you sai you love me why should you
deal thu with me you know well that i do not love you after thi sort
no and never can and even if you keep me from domitian who doe but
make a tool of you what would it advantag you to take a woman who
leav her heart elsewher also i mai never marri you for that same
reason that i mai not marri marcu becaus my faith is and must remain
apart from your would you make a base slave of your old playmat

miriam clasp her hand and for a moment stood look upward then a
light of purpos grew upon her face and she answer
caleb i have chosen do your worst the fate of marcu is not in my
hand or your hand but in the hand of god nor unless he will it
can on hair of hi head be harm by you or by domitian for is it not
written in the book of your own law that the king heart is in the
hand of the lord he turneth it whithersoev he will but my honour is
my own and to stain it would be a sin for which i alon must answer to
heaven and to marcu dead or livingmarcu who would curs and spit
upon me did i attempt to bui hi safeti at such a price
is that your last word miriam
it is if it pleas you by fals wit and by murder to destroi the
man who onc spare you then if such a thing be suffer have your
will and reap it fruit i make no bargain with you for myself or for
himdo your worst to both of us
so be it said caleb with a bitter laugh but i think that the ship
luna will lack her fairest passeng
miriam sank down upon a seat and cover her face with her hand a
piteou sight in her miseri and the terror which notwithstand her
bold word she could not conceal caleb walk to the door and paus
there while the whitehair nehushta stood by the brazier of charcoal
and watch them both with her fierc ey present caleb glanc
round at miriam crouch by the window and a strang new look came into
hi face
i cannot do it he said slowli each word fall heavili from hi
lip like singl raindrop from a cloud or the slow blood from a
mortal wound
miriam let her hand slip from her face and stare at him
miriam he said you ar right i have sin against you and thi
man marcu now i will expiat my sin your secret is safe with me and
sinc you hate me i will never see you more miriam we look upon
each other for the last time further if i can i will work for the
deliver of marcu and help him to join you in tyre whither the
luna is boundi she not farewel
onc again he turn to go but it would seem that hi ey were
blind or hi brain wa dull by the agoni that work within at
least caleb caught hi foot in the ancient uneven board stumbl and
fell heavili upon hi face instantli with a low hiss of hate and a
spring like that of a cat nehushta wa upon him thrust her knee
upon hi back she seiz the nape of hi neck with her left hand and
with her right drew a dagger from her bosom
forbear said miriam touch him with that knife and we part forev
nai i mean it i myself will hand you to the offic even if he hale
me to domitian
then nehushta rose to her feet
fool she said fool to trust to that man of doubl mood whose
merci tonight will be vengeanc tomorrow oh you ar undon ala
you ar undon
regain hi feet caleb look at her contemptu
had you stab she might have been undon inde he said now as
of old there is littl wisdom in that grai head of your nehushta nor
can your hate suffer you to understand the intermingl good and evil
of my heart then he advanc to miriam lift her hand and kiss it
with a sudden movement she proffer him her brow
nai he said tempt me not it is not for me farewel
anoth instant and he wa gone
it would seem that caleb kept hi word for three dai later the vessel
luna sail unmolest from the port of ostia in the charg of the
greek captain hector have on board miriam nehushta julia and
gallu
within a week of thi sail titu at length return to rome here in
due cours the case of marcu wa brought befor him by the prison
friend togeth with a demand that he should be grant a new and open
trial for the clear of hi honour titu who for hi own reason
refus to see marcu listen patient then gave hi decis
he rejoic he said to learn that hi close friend and trust offic
wa still aliv sinc he had long mourn him as dead he griev that
in hi absenc he should have been put upon hi trial on the charg of
have been taken captiv live by the jew which if marcu upon
hi arriv in rome had at onc report himself to him would not have
happen he dismiss all accus against hi militari honour and
courag as mere idl talk sinc he had a hundr time prove him to be
the bravest of men and knew moreov someth of the circumst
under which he wa captur but howev will he might be to do so
he wa unabl for public reason to disregard the fact that he had been
duli convict by a courtmarti under the princ domitian of have
broken the command of hi gener and suffer himself to be taken
prison aliv to do so would be to proclaim himself titu unjust
who had caus other to suffer for thi same offenc and to offer
insult to the princ hi brother who in the exercis of hi discret
as command in hi absenc had thought fit to order the trial still
hi punish should be of the lightest possibl he command that on
leav hi prison marcu should go straight to hi own hous by
night so that there might be no public talk or demonstr among hi
friend and there make such arrang of hi affair as seem good
to him further he command that within ten dai he should leav
itali to dwell or travel abroad for a period of three year unless
the time should be shorten by some special decre after the laps
of these three year he would be free to return to rome thi wa hi
judgment and it could not be alter
as it chanc it wa the chamberlain saturiu who first commun
the imperi decre to marcu hurri straight from the palac to the
prison he wa admit into the prison chamber
well said marcu look up what evil tide have you now
none none answer saturiu i have veri good tide and that is
why i run so fast you ar onli banish for three year thank to my
secret effort and he smile craftili even your properti is left to
you a fact which will i trust enabl you to reward your friend for
their labour on your behalf
tell me all and the rogu obei while marcu listen with a face
of stone
why did titu decid thu he ask when it wa finish speak
frankli man if you wish for a reward
becaus nobl marcu domitian had been with him beforehand and told
him that if he revers hi public judgment it would be a caus of open
quarrel between them thi csar who fear hi brother doe not seek
that is why he would not see you lest hi love for hi friend should
overcom hi reason
so the princ is still my enemi
ye and more bitter than befor sinc he cannot find the
pearlmaiden and is sure that you have spirit her awai be advis by
me and leav rome quickli lest wors thing befal you
ay said marcu i will leav rome quickli for how shall i abid
here who have lost my honour yet first it mai pleas your master to
know that by now the ladi whom he seek is far across the sea now get
you gone you fox for i desir to be alon
the face of saturiu becam evil
is that all you have to sai he ask am i to win no reward
if you stai longer said marcu you will win on which you do not
desir
then saturiu went but without the door he turn and shook hi fist
toward the chamber he had left
fox he mutter he call me fox and gave me noth well fox
mai find some pick on hi bone
the chamberlain road to the palac ran past the place of busi of
the merchant demetriu he stop and look at it perhap thi on
will be more liber he said to himself and enter
in hi privat offic he found caleb alon hi face buri in hi
hand seat himself he plung into hi tale end it with an
apolog to caleb for the light of the sentenc inflict upon
marcu
titu would do no more he said inde were it not for the fear
of domitian he could have not have been brought to do so much for he
love the man who ha been a prefect of hi bodyguard and wa deepli
griev that he must disgrac him still disgrac he is ay and he
feel it therefor i trust that you most gener demetriu who hate
him will rememb the servic of your servant in thi matter
ye said caleb quietli fear not you shall be well paid for you
have done your best
i thank you friend answer saturiu rub hi hand and after
all thing mai be better than thei seem that insol fool let out
just now that the girl about whom there is all thi bother ha been
smuggl awai somewher across the sea when domitian learn that he
will be so mad with anger that he mai be work up to take a littl
vengeanc of hi own upon the person of the nobl marcu who ha thu
contriv to trick him also marcu shall not get the pearlmaiden
for the princ will caus her to be follow and brought backto you
worthi demetriu
then answer caleb slowli he must seek for her not across the
sea but in it depth
what do you mean
i mean that i have tide that pearlmaiden escap in the ship luna
hard upon a month ago thi morn the captain and some marin of the
gallei imperatrix arriv in rome thei report that thei met a
great gale off rhegium and toward the end of it saw a vessel sink
afterward thei pick up a sailor cling to a piec of wood who told
them that the ship name wa luna and that she founder with all
hand
have you seen thi sailor
no he di of exhaust soon after he wa rescu but i have seen
the men of the gallei who brought me note of certain good consign to
me in her hold thei repeat thi stori to me with their own lip
so after all she whom so mani sought wa destin to the arm
of neptun as becam a pearl reflect saturiu well well as
domitian cannot be reveng upon neptun he will be the more wroth with
the man who sent her to that god now i go to tell him all these tide
and learn hi mind
you will return and acquaint me with it will you not ask caleb
look up
certainli and at onc our account is not yet balanc most gener
demetriu
no answer caleb our account ar not yet balanc
two hour later the chamberlain reappear in the offic
well said caleb how doe it go
ill veri ill for marcu and well veri well for those who hate him
as you and i do friend oh never have i seen my imperi master so
enrag inde when he learn that pearlmaiden had escap and wa
drown so that he could have no hope of her thi side the styx it wa
almost danger to be near to him he curs titu for the light of
hi sentenc he curs you he curs me but i turn hi wrath
into the right channel i show him that for all these ill marcu and
marcu alon is to blame marcu who is to pai the price of them with
a three year pleasant banish from rome which doubtless will be
remit present i tell you that domitian wept and gnash hi teeth
at the thought of it until i show him a better planknow that it
would pleas you friend demetriu
what plan
saturiu rose and have look round to see that the door wa
fasten came and whisper into caleb ear
look you after sunset tonight that is within two hour marcu is
to be put out of hi prison and conduct to the side door of hi own
hous that beneath the archwai where he is order to remain until
he leav rome in thi hous is no on except an old man the steward
stephanu and a slave woman well befor he get there certain trusti
fellow such as domitian know how to lai hi hand upon will have
enter the hous and have secur the steward and the woman will
await the come of marcu beneath the archwai you can guess the rest
is it not well conceiv
veri well answer caleb but mai there not be suspicion
none none who would dare to suspect domitian a privat crime
doubtless the rich have so mani enemi
what saturiu did not add wa that nobodi would suspect domitian becaus
the mask bravo were instruct to inform the steward and the slave
when thei had bound and gag them that thei were hire to do the deed
of blood by a certain merchant name demetriu otherwis caleb the jew
who had an ancient quarrel against marcu which alreadi he had tri
to satisfi by give fals evid befor the courtmarti
now went on saturiu i must be go for there ar on or two
littl thing which need attent and time press shall we balanc
that account friend demetriu
certainli said caleb and take a roll of gold from a drawer he
push it across the tabl
saturiu shook hi head sadli i laid it at twice as much he said
think how you hate him and how richli your hate will be fed first
disgrac unjustli he on of the best soldier and bravest captain in
the armi and then hack to death by cutthroat in the doorwai of hi
own hous what more could you want

fate have strang surpris for us mortal friend saturiu
dead he will be dead soon enough
good you shall have the rest of the monei when i have seen hi bodi
no i dont want ani bungl and that the best wai to make certain
i wonder thought saturiu as he depart out of the offic and
thi histori i wonder how i shall manag to get the balanc of my
fee befor thei have my jewish friend by the heel but it can be
arrangeddoubtless it can be arrang
when he had gone caleb who it would seem also had thing which
need attent and felt that time press took pen and wrote a short
letter next he summon a clerk and gave order that it wa to be
deliv two hour after sunsetnot befor
meanwhil he enclos it in an outer wrap so that the address wa
not seen thi done he sat still for a time hi lip move almost as
though he were engag in prayer then see that it wa the hour of
sunset he rose wrap himself in a long dark cloak such as wa worn
by roman offic and went out
chapter xxix

interview with the captain of the imperatrix then with a sorrow
heart he depart to the prison near the templ of mar here the warden
told him that marcu wish to see no on but answer friend my
busi will not wait he push past the man and enter the room
beyond marcu wa stand up in the centr of it in hi hand a
drawn sword of the short roman pattern which on catch sight of hi
visitor he cast upon the tabl with an exclam of impati it
fell besid a letter address to the ladi miriam in tyre to be given

friend answer marcu if you desir to know i wa about to fall
upon my sword on more minut and i should have been dead thei brought
it me with the cloak and other thing it wa thought of them and i
guess their mean
cyril lift the sword from the tabl and cast it into a corner of the
room
god be thank he said who led my feet here in time to save you
from thi sin why becaus it ha pleas him to take her life should
you seek to take your own
her life said marcu what dread word ar these her life whose

with all her compani
for a moment marcu stood swai to and fro like a drunken man then he
said
is it so inde well the more reason that i should make hast to
follow her begon and leav me to do the deed alon and he step
toward the sword
cyril set hi foot upon the shine blade
what is thi mad he ask if you did not know of miriam

becaus i have lost more than miriam man thei have rob me of my
honour by the decre of titu i marcu am brand as a coward ye
titu at whose side i have fought a score of battlestitu from whom

highborn men call you the fortun then christ appeal to you
in vain you put him by what had you to do with the crucifi carpent
of galile now by the plot of your foe you have fallen no longer
do you rank high in your trade of blood you ar dismiss it servic
and an exil the lesson of life ha come home to you therefor you
seek to escap from life rather than bide in it to do your duti through

verdict of your own conscienc let him whom you put by in your hour of
pomp come to you now carri your cross with your shame as he carri hi

the end her who ha been taken from you awhil ha my spirit spoken in
vain with your spirit dure all these mani week son marcu alreadi
you have told me that you believ and now at the first breath of
troubl will you go back upon that which you know to be the truth oh
onc more listen to me that your ey mai be open befor it is too
late
speak on i hear you said marcu with a sigh
so cyril plead with him in the passion of on inspir and as marcu
hearken hi heart wa soften and hi purpos turn
i knew it all befor i believ it all befor he said at length
but i would not accept your baptism and becom a member of your
church

thought and perhap i myself should have thought that i did it as onc
i offer to do to win her whom i desir abov all thing on earth
now she is dead and it is otherwis shrive me father and do your
offic
so there in the prison cell the bishop cyril took water and baptis the
roman marcu into the bodi of the christian church
what shall i do now marcu ask as he rose from hi knee onc
csar wa my master now you speak with the voic of csar command me

so present the gate were open as titu had command and thei went

street to the palac in the via agrippa
there is the door said the sergeant of the guard point to the
side entranc of the hous enter with your friend and nobl marcu

so thei went to the archwai and find the door ajar pass through
and shut it behind them
for a hous where there is much to steal thi is ill guard son in
rome an open gate ought to have a watchman said cyril as he grope hi
wai through the dark of the arch

who seem hard to wake ad marcu as he led the wai across the
courtyard to the door of the offic thi also prove to be open and
by it thei enter the room where the steward kept hi book and slept
upon the tabl a lamp wa burn that which thei had seen through the
casement it light show them a strang sight an ironbound box that

marcu snatch the lamp from the tabl and held it to the face of the
man in the corner
it is stephanu he said stephanu bound and gag but live
and the other is the slave woman hold the lamp while i loos them
and draw hi short sword he cut awai the bond first of the on and
then of the other speak man speak he said as stephanu struggl

for some moment the old steward stare at him with round frighten
ey then he gasp
oh my lord i thought you dead thei said that thei had come to kill

i know not four men whose face were mask thei said also that
though you must die thei were command to do me and thi woman no
harm onli to bind and silenc us thi thei did then have taken
what monei thei could find went out to waylai you afterward i heard
a scuffl in the arch and wellnigh di of sorrow for i who could
neither warn nor help you wa sure that you were perish beneath
their knive
for thi deliver thank god said cyril lift up hi hand
present present answer marcu first follow me and take
the lamp in hi hand he ran back to the archwai
beneath it a man lai upon hi faceh across whom marcu had stumbl
and about him blood flow from mani wound in silenc thei turn him
over so that the light fell upon hi featur then marcu stagger
back amaz for behold thei were caleb notwithstand the blood
and wound that mar them still dark and handsom in hi death sleep
why he said to stephanu thi is that veri man whose bloodi work
as thei told us the murder came to do it would seem that he ha
fallen into hi own snare
ar you certain son ask cyril doe not thi gash and gori
cheek deceiv you
draw that hand of hi from beneath the cloak answer marcu if i
am right the first finger will lack a joint
cyril obei and held up the stiffen hand it wa as marcu had said
caught in hi own snare repeat marcu well though i knew he
hate me and more than onc we have striven to slai each other in
battl and privat fight never would i have believ that caleb the jew
would sink to murder he is well repaid the treacher dog
judg not that ye be not judg answer cyril what do you know of
how or why thi man came by hi death he mai have been hurri here to
warn you
against hi own paid assassin no father i know caleb better onli
he wa viler than i thought
then thei carri the bodi into the hous and took counsel what thei
should do while thei reason togeth for everi path seem full of
danger there came a knock upon the archwai door thei hesit not
know whether it would be safe to open till the knock wa repeat
more loudli
i will go lord said stephanu for why need i fear who am of no
account to ani on
so he went present to return
what wa it ask marcu
onli a young man who said that he had been strictli charg by hi
master demetriu the alexandrian merchant to deliv a letter at thi
hour here is the letter
demetriu the alexandrian merchant said marcu as he took it why
under that name caleb who li there dead pass in rome
read the letter said cyril
so marcu cut the silk broke the seal and read
to the nobl marcu
in the past i have work you evil and often striven to take your life
now it ha come to my ear that domitian who hate you even wors than
i do if for less reason ha laid a plot to murder you on the threshold
of your own hous therefor by wai of amend for that evid which
i gave against you that stain the truth sinc no braver man ever
breath than you ar marcu it ha come into my mind to visit the
palac fortun wrap in such a cloak as you roman captain wear
there befor you read thi letter perhap we shall meet again still
mourn me not marcu nor speak of me as gener or nobl sinc
miriam is dead and i who have follow her through life desir to
follow her through death hope that there i mai find a kinder fortun
at her hand or if not forget you who will live long must
drink deep of memorya bitter cup marcu farewel sinc die i
must i would that it had been in open fight beneath your sword but
fate who ha given me fortun but no true favour appoint me to the
dagger of assassin that seek anoth heart so be it you tarri here
but i travel to miriam why should i grumbl at the road
caleb
written at rome upon the night of my death
a brave man and a bitter said marcu when he had finish read
know my father that i am more jealou of him now than ever i wa in
hi life dai had it not been for you and your preach he ad
angrili when he came to seek miriam he would have found me at her
side but now how can i tell
peac to your heathen talk answer the bishop is the land of
spirit then such as your poet pictur and do the dead turn to each
other with ey of earthli passion yet he ad more gentli i
should not blame you who like thi poor jew from childhood have been
steep in superstit have no fear of hi rivalri in the heavenli
field friend marcu where neither do thei marri or ar given in
marriag nor think that selfmurd can help a man what the end of
all thi tale mai be doe not yet appear still i am certain that yonder
caleb will take no gain in hurri down to death unless inde he did
it from a nobler motiv than he sai as i for on believ
i trust that it mai be so answer marcu although in truth that
anoth man should die for me give me no comfort rather would i that
he had left me to my doom
as god ha will so it ha befallen for man go ar of the
lord how then can a man understand hi own wai repli cyril with a
sigh now let us to other matter for time is short and it come upon
me that you will do well to be clear of rome befor domitian find that
caleb fell in place of marcu
nearli three more month had gone when at length on night as the sun
vanish a gallei crept wearili into the harbour of alexandria and cast
anchor just as the light of pharo began to shine across the sea her
passag through the winter gale had been hard and for week at a time
she had been oblig to shelter in harbour by the wai now short of
food and water she had come safe to her haven for which merci the
bishop cyril with the roman marcu and such other christian as were
aboard of her gave thank to heaven upon their knee in their littl
cabin near the forecastl for it wa too late to attempt to land that
night then thei went on deck and as all their food wa gone and thei
had no drink except some stink water lean upon the bulwark and
look hungrili toward the shore where gleam the thousand light of
the mighti citi near to them not a bowshot awai inde lai anoth
ship present as thei stare at her black outlin the sound of
sing float from her deck across the still starlit water of the
harbour thei listen to it idli enough at first till at length some
word of that song reach their ear caus them to look at each
other
that is no sailor ditti said marcu
no answer cyril it is a christian hymn and on that i know well
listen each vers end peac be still
then said marcu yonder must be a christian ship els thei would
not dare to sing that hymn the night is calm let us beg the boat and
visit it i am thirsti and those good folk mai have fresh water
if you wish answer cyril there too we mai get tide as well as
water
a while later the littl boat row to the side of the strang ship and
ask leav to board of the watchman
what sign do you give ask the offic
the sign of the cross answer cyril we have heard your hymn who
ar of the brotherhood of rome
then a rope ladder wa thrown down to them and the offic bade them
make fast and be welcom
thei climb upon the deck and went to seek the captain who wa in
the afterpart of the ship where an awn wa stretch in the space
enclos by thi awn which wa lit with lantern stood a woman in
a white robe who sang the refrain of the hymn in a veri sweet voic
other of the compani from time to time join in it chorus
from the dead am i arisen sang the voic and there wa someth in
the thrill note that went straight to the heart of marcu some tone
and qualiti which were familiar
side by side with cyril he climb onward across the row bench
and the nois of their stumbl footstep reach the singer ear
caus her to paus in her song then step forward a littl as
though to look she came under the lantern so that it light fell full
upon her face and see noth onc more took up her chant
oh ye faithless from the dead am i arisen
look look gasp marcu clutch cyril by the arm look it is
miriam or her spirit
anoth instant and he too had come into the circl of the lamplight
so that hi ey met the ey of the singer now she saw him and with a
littl cry sank senseless to the deck
so the long stori end afterward thei learn that the tale which had
been brought to rome of the loss of the ship luna wa fals she had
met the great gale inde but had shelter from it in a harbour
where the skill of her captain hector brought her safe then she
made her wai to sicili where she refit and so on to on of the
grecian port in which she lai for eight week wait for better
weather till a favour wind brought her somewhat slowli to
alexandria a port she won onli two dai befor the gallei of marcu
it would seem therefor that the vessel that had founder in sight
of the imperatrix wa either anoth ship also call the luna no
uncommon name or that the marin of the imperatrix had not heard
her titl rightli it mai have been even that the dy sailor who told
it to them wander in hi mind and forget how hi last ship wa
call gave her some name with which he wa familiar at the least
through the good work of provid that luna which bore miriam
and her compani escap the peril of the deep and in due time reach
the haven of alexandria
befor thei part that happi night all their tale wa told miriam
learn how caleb had kept the promis that he made to her although
when he thought her dead hi fierc and jealou heart would suffer him
to tell noth of it to marcu she learn also how it came about that
marcu had been save from death at hi own hand by cyril and enter
the compani of the christian brotherhood veri glad were both of them to
think in the after year that he had done thi believ her to be lost
to him in death now none could sai that he had chang hi faith to win
a woman nor could their own conscienc whisper to them that thi wa
possibl though even at the time he knew it not
so thei understood how through their mani trial danger and
temptat all thing had work togeth for good to them
on the morrow there in the ship luna marcu and miriam whom the
roman call pearlmaiden were wed by the bishop cyril the captain
gallu give the bride in marriag while the whitehair fierceei
nehushta stood at their side and bless them in the name of that dead
