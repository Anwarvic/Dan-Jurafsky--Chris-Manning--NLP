month of the outbreak of the zulu war in 1878 when cetywayo wa
alreadi show unfriendli to the english trader and other though
why the king did so thei knew not
on the occas of hi first and last interview with cetywayo hadden

hi arriv at the royal kraal a messeng came to inform him that
the eleph whose tread shook the earth had signifi that it wa
hi pleasur to see him accordingli he wa led through the thousand of

went down upon hi hand and knee and utter the royal salut of
bayt crawl forward to announc that the white man wa wait
let him wait said the king angrili and turn he continu the
discuss with hi counsellor
now as ha been said hadden thoroughli understood zulu and when
from time to time the king rais hi voic some of the word he spoke

stamp out these littl white men my impi shall eat them up i have
said
again the wither ag man interpos evid in the charact of
a peacemak hadden could not hear hi talk but he rose and point
toward the sea while from hi express gestur and sorrow mien
he seem to be prophesi disast should a certain cours of action
be follow
for a while the king listen to him then he sprang from hi seat hi
ey liter ablaz with rage
hearken he cri to the counsellor i have guess it for long and
now i am sure of it you ar a traitor you ar sompseu dog and
the dog of the natal govern and i will not keep anoth man dog
to bite me in my own hous take him awai

a slight involuntari murmur rose from the ring of induna but the
old man never flinch not even when the soldier who present would
murder him came and seiz him roughli for a few second perhap
five he cover hi face with the corner of the kaross he wore then he
look up and spoke to the king in a clear voic

ten dai had pass and on even hadden and hi escort were encamp
in a wild stretch of mountain countri ly between the blood and
unvunyana river not more than eight mile from that place of the
littl hand which within a few week wa to becom famou throughout
the world by it nativ name of isandhlwana for three dai thei had
been track the spoor of a small herd of buffalo that still inhabit
the district but as yet thei had not come up with them the zulu
hunter had suggest that thei should follow the unvunyana down toward
the sea where game wa more plenti but thi neither hadden nor the
captain nahoon had been anxiou to do for reason which each of them
kept secret to himself hadden object wa to work gradual down to
the buffalo river across which he hope to effect a retreat into natal
that of nahoon wa to linger in the neighbourhood of the kraal of
umgona which wa situat not veri far from their present camp
place in the vagu hope that he might find an opportun of speak
with or at least of see nanea the girl to whom he wa affianc who
within a few week must be taken from him and given over to the king
a more eerielook spot than that where thei were encamp hadden
had never seen behind them lai a tract of landhalfswamp and
halfbushin which the buffalo were suppos to be hide beyond in
lone grandeur rose the mountain of isandhlwana while in front wa an
amphitheatr of the most gloomi forest ring round in the distanc by
sheersid hill into thi forest there ran a river which drain the
swamp placidli enough upon the level but it wa not alwai level for
within three hundr yard of them it dash suddenli over a precipic
of no great height but veri steep fall into a boil rockbound
pool that the light of the sun never seem to reach
what is the name of that forest nahoon ask hadden
it is name emagudu the home of the dead the zulu repli
absent for he wa look toward the kraal of nanea which wa
situat at an hour walk awai over the ridg to the right
the home of the dead why
becaus the dead live there those whom we name the esemkofu the
speechless on and with them other spirit the amahlosi from whom
the breath of life ha pass awai and who yet live on
inde said hadden and have you ever seen these ghost
am i mad that i should go to look for them white man onli the dead
enter that forest and it is on the border of it that our peopl make
offer to the dead
follow by nahoon hadden walk to the edg of the cliff and look
over it to the left lai the deep and dreadfullook pool while close
to the bank of it place upon a narrow strip of turf between the cliff
and the commenc of the forest wa a hut
who live there ask hadden
the great isanusish who is name inyanga or doctoress she who
is name inyosi the bee becaus she gather wisdom from the dead who
grow in the forest
do you think that she could gather enough wisdom to tell me whether i
am go to kill ani buffalo nahoon
mayhap white man but he ad with a littl smile those who visit
the bee hive mai hear noth or thei mai hear more than thei wish
for the word of that bee have a sting
good i will see if she can sting me
so be it said nahoon and turn he led the wai along the cliff
till he reach a nativ path which zigzag down it face
by thi path thei climb till thei came to the sward at the foot of the
descent and walk up it to the hut which wa surround by a low fenc
of reed enclos a small courtyard pave with antheap earth beaten
hard and polish in thi courtyard sat the bee her stool be
place almost at the mouth of the round open that serv as a doorwai
to the hut at first all that hadden could see of her crouch as she
wa in the shadow wa a huddl shape wrap round with a greasi and
tatter catskin kaross abov the edg of which appear two ey
fierc and quick as those of a leopard at her feet smoulder a littl
fire and rang around it in a semicircl were a number of human
skull place in pair as though thei were talk togeth whilst
other bone to all appear also human were festoon about the hut
and the fenc of the courtyard
i see that the old ladi is set up with the usual properti thought
hadden but he said noth
nor did the witchdoctoress sai anyth she onli fix her beadi ey
upon hi face hadden return the compliment stare at her with all
hi might till suddenli he becam awar that he wa vanquish in thi
curiou duel hi brain grew confus and to hi fanci it seem that
the woman befor him had shift shape into the like of coloss
and horrid spider sit at the mouth of her trap and that these bone
were the relic of her victim
why do you not speak white man she said at last in a slow clear
voic well there is no need sinc i can read your thought you ar
think that i who am call the bee should be better name the spider
have no fear i did not kill these men what would it profit me when the
dead ar so mani i suck the soul of men not their bodi white man

white man you shall pai me later on when we meet again and onc more
she laugh let me look in your face let me look in your face she
continu rise and stand befor him
then of a sudden hadden felt someth cold at the back of hi neck and
the next instant the bee had sprung from him hold between her thumb
and finger a curl of dark hair which she had cut from hi head the
action wa so instantan that he had neither time to avoid nor to
resent it but stood still stare at her stupidli
that is all i need she cri for like my heart my magic is white
stayson of zomba give me also of your hair for those who visit the
bee must listen to her hum
nahoon obei cut a littl lock from hi head with the sharp edg
of hi assegai though it wa veri evid that he did thi not becaus
he wish to do so but becaus he fear to refus
then the bee slip back her kaross and stood bend over the fire
befor them into which she threw herb taken from a pouch that wa
bound about her middl she wa still a finelyshap woman and she
wore none of the abomin which hadden had been accustom to see
upon the person of witchdoctoress about her neck howev wa a
curiou ornament a small live snake red and grei in hue which her
visitor recognis as on of the most deadli to be found in that
part of the countri it is not unusu for bantu witchdoctor thu to
decor themselv with snake though whether or not their fang have
first been extract no on seem to know
present the herb began to smoulder and the smoke of them rose up in
a thin straight stream that strike upon the face of the bee clung
about her head envelop it as though with a strang blue veil then of
a sudden she stretch out her hand and let fall the two lock of
hair upon the burn herb where thei writh themselv to ash like
thing aliv next she open her mouth and began to draw the fume
of the hair and herb into her lung in great gulp while the snake
feel the influenc of the medicin hiss and uncoil itself
from about her neck crept upward and took refug among the black
saccaboola feather of her headdress
soon the vapour began to do their work she swai to and fro
mutter then sank back against the hut upon the straw of which her
head rest now the bee face wa turn upward toward the light
and it wa ghastli to behold for it had becom blue in colour and
the open ey were sunken like the ey of on dead whilst abov her
forehead the red snake waver and hiss remind hadden of the
uraeu crest on the brow of statu of egyptian king for ten second
or more she remain thu then she spoke in a hollow and unnatur
voic

chapter iii
the end of the hunt
the prayer of the bee notwithstand philip hadden slept ill that
night he felt in the best of health and hi conscienc wa not
troubl him more than usual but rest he could not whenev he close
hi ey hi mind conjur up a pictur of the grim witchdoctoress
so strang name the bee and the sound of her evilomen word as
he had heard them that afternoon he wa neither a superstiti nor a
timid man and ani supernatur belief that might linger in hi mind
were to sai the least of it dormant but do what he might he could
not shake off a certain eeri sensat of fear lest there should be
some grain of truth in the prophesi of thi hag what if it were
a fact that he wa near hi death and that the heart which beat so
strongli in hi breast must soon be still for everno he would not
think of it thi gloomi place and the dread sight which he saw that
dai had upset hi nerv the domest custom of these zulu were not
pleasant and for hi part he wa determin to be clear of them so soon
as he wa abl to escap the countri
in fact if he could in ani wai manag it it wa hi intent to make
a dash for the border on the follow night to do thi with a good
prospect of success howev it wa necessari that he should kill a
buffalo or some other head of game then as he knew well the hunter
with him would feast upon meat until thei could scarc stir and that
would be hi opportun nahoon howev might not succumb to thi
temptat therefor he must trust to luck to be rid of him if it came
to the worst he could put a bullet through him which he consid
he would be justifi in do see that in realiti the man wa hi
jailor should thi necess aris he felt inde that he could face
it without undu compunct for in truth he dislik nahoon at time
he even hate him their natur were antagonist and he knew that the
great zulu distrust and look down upon him and to be look down
upon by a savag nigger wa more than hi pride could stomach
at the first break of dawn hadden rose and rous hi escort who were
still stretch in sleep around the dy fire each man wrap in hi
kaross or blanket nahoon stood up and shook himself look gigant
in the shadow of the morn
what is your will umlungu white man that you ar up befor the
sun
my will muntumpofu yellow man is to hunt buffalo answer
hadden coolli it irrit him that thi savag should give him no
titl of ani sort
your pardon said the zulu read hi thought but i cannot call
you inkoo becaus you ar not my chief or ani man still if the
titl white man offend you we will give you a name
as you wish answer hadden briefli
accordingli thei gave him a name inhlizinmgama by which he wa
known among them thereaft but hadden wa not best pleas when he
found that the mean of those softsound syllabl wa black
heart that wa how the inyanga had address himonli she us
differ word
an hour later and thei were in the swampi bush countri that lai behind
the encamp search for their game within a veri littl while
nahoon held up hi hand then point to the ground hadden look
there press deep in the marshi soil and to all appear not ten
minut old wa the spoor of a small herd of buffalo
i knew that we should find game todai whisper nahoon becaus the
bee said so
curs the bee answer hadden below hi breath come on
for a quarter of an hour or more thei follow the spoor through thick
reed till suddenli nahoon whistl veri softli and touch hadden
arm he look up and there about two hundr yard awai feed
on some higher ground among a patch if mimosa tree were the
buffaloessix of theman old bull with a splendid head three cow a
heifer and a calf about four month old neither the wind nor the natur
of the veldt were favour for them to stalk the game from their
present posit so thei made a detour of half a mile and veri
carefulli crept toward them up the wind slip from trunk to trunk
of the mimosa and when these fail them crawl on their stomach
under cover of the tall tambuti grass at last thei were within forti
yard and a further advanc seem impractic for although he could
not smell them it wa evid from hi movement that the old bull
heard some unusu sound and wa grow suspici nearest to hadden
who alon of the parti had a rifl stood the heifer broadsid ona
beauti shot rememb that she would make the best beef he lift
hi martini and aim at her immedi behind the shoulder gentli
squeez the trigger the rifl explod and the heifer fell dead shot
through the heart strang enough the other buffalo did not at onc
run awai on the contrari thei seem puzzl to account for the sudden
nois and not be abl to wind anyth lift their head and
stare round them
the paus gave hadden space to get in a fresh cartridg and to aim
again thi time at the old bull the bullet struck him somewher in the
neck or shoulder for he came to hi knee but in anoth second wa up
and have caught sight of the cloud of smoke he charg straight at it
becaus of thi smoke or for some other reason hadden did not see him
come and in consequ would most certainli have been trampl or
gore had not nahoon sprung forward at the immin risk of hi own
life and drag him down behind an antheap a moment more and the
great beast had thunder by take no further notic of them
forward said hadden and leav most of the men to cut up the heifer
and carri the best of her meat to camp thei start on the blood spoor
for some hour thei follow the bull till at last thei lost the trail
on a patch of stoni ground thickli cover with bush and exhaust by
the heat sat down to rest and to eat some biltong or sundri flesh
which thei had with them thei finish their meal and were prepar
to return to the camp when on of the four zulu who were with them
went to drink at a littl stream that ran at a distanc of not more than
ten pace awai half a minut later thei heard a hideou grunt nois
and a splash of water and saw the zulu fly into the air all the
while that thei were eat the wound buffalo had been ly in
wait for them under a thick bush on the bank of the streamlet
knowingcun brute that he wasthat sooner or later hi turn would
come with a shout of constern thei rush forward to see the bull
vanish over the rise befor hadden could get a chanc of fire at him
and to find their companion dy for the great horn had pierc hi
lung
it is not a buffalo it is a devil the poor fellow gasp and
expir
devil or not i mean to kill it exclaim hadden so leav the
other to carri the bodi of their comrad to camp he start on
accompani by nahoon onli now the ground wa more open and the chase
easier for thei sight their quarri frequent though thei could not
come near enough to fire present thei travel down a steep cliff
do you know where we ar ask nahoon point to a belt of forest
opposit that is emagudu the home of the deadand look the bull
head thither
hadden glanc round him it wa true yonder to the left were the fall
the pool of doom and the hut of the bee
veri well he answer then we must head for it too
nahoon halt sure you would not enter there he exclaim
sure i will repli hadden but there is no need for you to do so
if you ar afraid
i am afraidof ghost said the zulu but i will come
so thei cross the strip of turf and enter the haunt wood it
wa a gloomi place inde the great widetop tree grew thick there
shut out the sight of the sky moreov the air in it which no
breez stir wa heavi with the exhal of rot foliag there
seem to be no life here and no soundonli now and again a loathsom
spot snake would uncoil itself and glide awai and now and again a
heavi rotten bough fell with a crash
hadden wa too intent upon the buffalo howev to be much impress
by hi surround he onli remark that the light would be bad for
shoot and went on
thei must have penetr a mile or more into the forest when the sudden
increas of blood upon the spoor told them that the bull wound wa
prove fatal to him
run now said hadden cheerfulli
nai hamba gachlego softli answer nahoon the devil is dy
but he will try to plai us anoth trick befor he di and he went on
peer ahead of him cautious
it is all right here anywai said hadden point to the spoor that
ran straight forward print deep in the marshi ground
nahoon did not answer but stare steadili at the trunk of two tree a
few pace in front of them and to their right look he whisper
hadden did so and at length made out the outlin of someth brown
that wa crouch behind the tree
he is dead he exclaim
no answer nahoon he ha come back on hi own path and is wait
for us he know that we ar follow hi spoor now if you stand
there i think that you can shoot him through the back between the tree
trunk
hadden knelt down and aim veri carefulli at a point just below the
bull spine he fire there wa an aw bellow and the next instant
the brute wa up and at them nahoon flung hi broad spear which sank
deep into it chest then thei fled thi wai and that the buffalo stood
still for a moment it fore leg straddl wide and it head down
look first after the on and then the other till of a sudden it
utter a low moan sound and roll over dead smash nahoon
assegai to fragment as it fell
there he finish said hadden and i believ it wa your assegai
that kill him hullo what that nois
nahoon listen in sever quarter of the forest but from how far
awai it wa imposs to tell there rose a curiou sound as of peopl
call to each other in fear but in no articul languag nahoon
shiver
it is the esemkofu he said the ghost who have no tongu and
who can onli wail like infant let us be go thi place is bad for
mortal
and wors for buffalo said hadden give the dead bull a kick
but i suppos that we must leav him here for your friend the
esemkofu as we have got meat enough and cant carri hi head
so thei start back toward the open countri as thei thread their
wai slowli through the tree trunk a new idea came into hadden head
onc out of thi forest he wa within an hour run of the zulu border
and onc over the zulu border he would feel a happier man than he did
at that moment as ha been said he had intend to attempt to escap
in the dark but the plan wa riski all the zulu might not
overeat themselv and go to sleep especi after the death of their
comrad nahoon who watch him dai and night certainli would not
thi wa hi opportunityther remain the question of nahoon
well if it came to the worst nahoon must die it would be easyh
had a load rifl and now that hi assegai wa gone nahoon had onli
a kerri he did not wish to kill the man though it wa clear to
him see that hi own safeti wa at stake that he would be ampli
justifi in so do why should he not put it to himand then be
guid by circumst
nahoon wa walk across a littl open space about ten space ahead of
him where hadden could see him veri well whilst he himself wa under
the shadow of a larg tree with low horizont branch run out from
the trunk
nahoon he said
the zulu turn round and took a step toward him
no do not move i prai stand where you ar or i shall be oblig
to shoot you listen now do not be afraid for i shall not fire without
warn i am your prison and you ar charg to take me back to the
king to be hi servant but i believ that a war is go to break out
between your peopl and mine and thi be so you will understand
that i do not wish to go to cetywayo kraal becaus i should either
come to a violent death there or my own brother will believ that i

forest and give me thi hour and a half startor will you stop here
with that ghost peopl of whom you talk do you understand no pleas

the king but most of all i desir to marri nahoon it mai be that i
shall not be abl to marri him but if that is so at least i will never
becom on of the king women
how will you prevent it nanea
there ar water in which a maid mai drown and tree upon which she
can hang she answer with a quick set of the mouth
that were a piti nanea you ar too fair to die
fair or foul yet i die inkoo
no no come with mei will find a wayand be my wife and he put
her arm about her waist and strove to draw her to him
without ani violenc of movement and with the most perfect digniti the
girl disengag herself from hi embrac
you have honour me and i thank you inkoo she said quietli
but you do not understand i am the wife of nahooni belong to nahoon
therefor i cannot look on ani other man while nahoon live it is not
our custom inkoo for we ar not as the white women but ignor
and simpl and when we vow ourselv to a man we abid by that vow
till death
inde said hadden and so now you go to tell nahoon that i have
offer to make you my wife
no inkoo why should i tell nahoon your secret i have said nai
to you not yea therefor he ha no right to know and she stoop
to lift the gourd of water
hadden consid the situat rapidli for hi repuls onli made
him the more determin to succe of a sudden under the emerg
he conceiv a scheme or rather it rough outlin it wa not a
nice scheme and some men might have shrunk from it but as he had
no intent of suffer himself to be defeat by a zulu girl he
decidedwith regret it is truethat have fail to attain hi end
by mean which he consid fair he must resort to other of more
doubt charact
nanea he said you ar a good and honest woman and i respect you
as i have told you i love you also but if you refus to listen to me
there is noth more to be said and after all perhap it would be
better that you should marri on of your own peopl but nanea you
will never marri him for the king will take you and if he doe not
give you to some other man either you will becom on of hi sister
or to be free of him as you sai you will die now hear me for it is
becaus i love you and wish your welfar that i speak thu why do you
not escap into natal take nahoon with you for there as you know you
mai live in peac out of reach of the arm of cetywayo
that is my desir inkoo but nahoon will not consent he sai that
there is to be war between us and you white men and he will not break
the command of the king and desert from hi armi
then he cannot love you much nahoon and at least you have to think of
yourself whisper into the ear of your father and fly togeth for be
sure that nahoon will soon follow you ay and i myself with fly with
you for i too believ that there must be war and then a white man in
thi countri will be as a lamb among the eagl
if nahoon will come i will go inkoo but i cannot fly without
nahoon it is better i should stai here and kill myself
sure then be so fair and love him so well you can teach him
to forget hi folli and to escap with you in four dai time we must
start for the king kraal and if you win over nahoon it will be
easi for us to turn our face southward and across the river that li
between the land of the amazulu and natal for the sake of all of us
but most of all for your own sake try to do thi nanea whom i have
love and whom i now would save see him and plead with him as you
know how but as yet do not tell him that i dream of flight for then i
should be watch

wait a while i maputa will roll that stone over i will throw that
bull upon it back when next the harvest ripen thi i promis that
neither nahoon nor umgona nor ani of hi kraal shall be left to gather

hadden pat the poni neck medit then lean forward he
look the chief in the ey and said
what will you give me maputa if i show you that wai a sure and
certain on wherebi you mai be aveng to the death upon nahoon whose
violenc i also have seen and upon umgona whose witchcraft brought
sore sick upon me
what reward do you seek white man ask maputa eagerli
a littl thing chief a thing of no account onli the girl nanea to
whom as it chanc i have taken a fanci
i want her for myself white man but he who sit at ulundi ha laid
hi hand upon her
that is noth chief i can arrang with him who sit at ulundi it
is with you who ar great here that i wish to come to term listen if
you grant my desir not onli will i fulfil your upon your foe but
when the girl is deliv into my hand i will give you thi rifl and
a hundr round of cartridg
maputa look at the sport martini and hi ey glisten
it is good he said it is veri good often have i wish for such a
gun that will enabl me to shoot game and to talk with my enemi from
far awai promis it to me white man and you shall take the girl if i
can give her to you
you swear it maputa
i swear it by the head of chaka and the spirit of my father
good at dawn on the fourth dai from now it is the purpos of umgona

drift that is call crocodil drift take their cattl with them and
fly from the king i also shall be of their compani for thei know
that i have learn their secret and would murder me if i tri to
leav them now you who ar chief of the border and guardian of that
drift must hide at night with some men among the rock in the shallow
of the drift and await our come first nanea will cross drive the
cow and calv for so it is arrang and i shall help her then will
follow umgona and nahoon with the oxen and heifer on these two you
must fall kill them and captur the cattl and afterward i will
give you the rifl
what if the king should ask for the girl white man
then you shall answer that in the uncertain light you did not recognis

to seiz the girl lest her cri should alarm the men and thei should
escap you

across the river
thu befor i enter the ford i will lai the rifl and cartridg upon
a stone by the bank tell nanea that i shall return to fetch them
when i have driven over the cattl
it is well white man i will not fail you
so the plot wa made and after some further convers upon point of
detail the two conspir shook hand and part
that ought to come off all right reflect hadden to himself as he
plung and float in the water of the stream but somehow i dont
quit trust our friend maputa it would have been better if i could
have reli upon myself to get rid of nahoon and hi respect unclea
coupl of shot would do it in the water but then that would be murder
and murder is unpleas wherea the other thing is onli the deliveri
to justic of two base desert a laudabl action in a militari
countri also person interfer upon my part might turn the girl
against me while after umgona and nahoon have been wipe out by maputa
she must accept my escort of cours there is a risk but in everi
walk of life the most cautiou have to take risk at time
as it chanc philip hadden wa correct in hi suspicion of hi
coadjutor maputa even befor that worthi chief reach hi own
kraal he had come to the conclus that the white man plan though
attract in some wai wa too danger sinc it wa certain that if
the girl nanea escap the king would be indign moreov the men
he took with him to do the kill in the drift would suspect someth
and talk on the other hand he would earn much credit with hi majesti
by reveal the plot sai that he had learn it from the lip of
the white hunter whom umgona and nahoon had forc to particip
in it and of whose covet rifl he must trust to chanc to possess
himself
an hour later two discreet messeng were bound across the plain
bear word from the chief maputa the warden of the border to the
great black eleph at ulundi
chapter v
the doom pool
fortun show itself strang favour to the plan of nahoon and
nanea on of the zulu captain perplex wa as to how he should
lull the suspicion and evad the vigil of hi own companion who
togeth with himself had been detail by the king to assist hadden in
hi hunt and to guard against hi escap as it chanc howev on
the dai after the incid of the visit of maputa a messeng arriv
from no less a person than the great militari induna tvingwayo ka
marolo who afterward command the zulu armi at isandhlwana order
these men to return to their regiment the umcityu corp which wa to
be place upon full war foot accordingli nahoon sent them sai
that he himself would follow with black heart in the cours of a few
dai as at present the white man wa not suffici recov from
hi hurt to allow of hi travel fast and far so the soldier went
doubt noth
then umgona gave it out that in obedi to the command of the king he
wa about to start for ulundi take with him hi daughter nanea to
be deliv over into the sigodhla and also those fifteen head
of cattl that had been lobolad by nahoon in consider of hi
forthcom marriag whereof he had been fine by cetywayo under
pretenc that thei requir a chang of veldt the rest of hi cattl
he sent awai in charg of a basuto herd who knew noth of their plan
tell him to keep them by the crocodil drift as there the grass wa
good and sweet
all prepar be complet on the third dai the parti start
head straight for ulundi after thei had travel some mile
howev thei left the road and turn sharp to the right pass
unobserv of ani through a great stretch of uninhabit bush their
path now lai not far from the pool of doom which inde wa close to
umgona kraal and the forest that wa call home of the dead but out
of sight of these it wa their plan to travel by night reach the
broken countri near the crocodil drift on the follow morn here
thei propos to lie hid that dai and through the night then have
first collect the cattl which had preced them to cross the river
at the break of dawn and escap into natal at least thi wa the
plan of hi companion but as we know hadden had anoth programm
whereon after on last appear two of the parti would plai no part
dure that long afternoon journei umgona who knew everi inch of the
countri walk ahead drive the fifteen cattl and carri in hi
hand a long travel stick of black and white umzimbeet wood for in
truth the old man wa in a hurri to reach hi journei end next came
nahoon arm with a broad assegai but nake except for hi moocha and
necklet of baboon teeth and with him nanea in her white beadbord
mantl hadden who brought up the rear notic that the girl seem
to be under the spell of an immin apprehens for from time to time
she clasp her lover arm and look up into hi face address him
with vehem almost with passion
curious enough the sight touch hadden and onc or twice he wa
shaken by so sharp a pang of remors at the thought of hi share in thi
tragedi that he cast about in hi mind seek a mean to unravel the
web of death which he himself had woven but ever that evil voic wa
whisper at hi ear it remind him that he the white inkoo had
been refus by thi duski beauti and that if he found a wai to save
him within some few hour she would be the wife of the savag gentleman
at her side the man who had name him black heart and who despis
him the man whom he had meant to murder and who immedi repaid hi
treacheri by rescu him from the jaw of the leopard at the risk of
hi own life moreov it wa a law of hadden exist never to deni
himself of anyth that he desir if it lai within hi power to take
ita law which had led him alwai deeper into sin in other respect
inde it had not carri him far for in the past he had not desir
much and he had won littl but thi particular flower wa to hi hand
and he would pluck it if nahoon stood between him and the flower so
much the wors for nahoon and if it should wither in hi grasp so much
the wors for the flower it could alwai be thrown awai thu it came
about that not for the first time in hi life philip hadden discard
the somewhat spasmod prick of conscienc and listen to that evil
whisper at hi ear
about halfpast five oclock in the afternoon the four refuge pass
the stream that a mile or so down fell over the littl precipic into
the doom pool and enter a patch of thorn tree on the further side
walk straight into the midst of twoandtwenti soldier who were

smoke of dakka or nativ hemp with these soldier seat on hi
poni for he wa too fat to walk wait the chief maputa

nahoon heard the word and sprang straight at the throat of hadden but
he did not reach it for the soldier pull him down nanea heard them

chapter vi
the ghost of the dead
when nanea leapt from the dizzi platform that overhung the pool of doom
a strang fortun befel her close in to the precipic were mani jag
rock and on these the water of the fall fell and thunder bound
from them in spout of sprai into the troubl depth of the foss
beyond it wa on these stone that the life wa dash out from the
bodi of the wretch victim who were hurl from abov but nanea it
will be rememb had not wait to be treat thu and as it chanc
the strong spring with which she had leapt to death carri her clear of
the rock by a veri littl she miss the edg of them and strike the
deep water head first like some practis diver she sank down and down
till she thought that she would never rise again yet she did rise
at the end of the pool in the mouth of the rapid along which she sped
swiftli carri down by the rush of the water fortun there were
no rock here and sinc she wa a skil swimmer she escap the
danger of be thrown against the bank
for a long distanc she wa born thu till at length she saw that she
wa in a forest for tree cut off the light from the water and their
droop branch swept it surfac on of these nanea caught with her
hand and by the help of it she drag herself from the river of death
whenc none had escap befor now she stood upon the bank gasp
but quit unharm there wa not a scratch on her bodi even her white
garment wa still fast about her neck
but though she had suffer no hurt in her terribl voyag so exhaust
wa nanea that she could scarc stand here the gloom wa that of
night and shiver with cold she look helplessli to find some
refug close to the water edg grew an enorm yellowwood tree
and to thi she staggeredthink to climb it and seek shelter in it
bough where as she hope she would be safe from wild beast again
fortun befriend her for at a distanc of a few feet from the ground
there wa a great hole in the tree which she discov wa hollow
into thi hole she crept take her chanc of it be the home of
snake or other evil creatur to find that the interior wa wide and
warm it wa dry also for at the bottom of the caviti lai a foot or
more of rotten tinder and moss brought there by rat or bird upon thi
tinder she lai down and cover herself with the moss and leav soon
sank into sleep or stupor
how long nanea slept she did not know but at length she wa awaken by
a sound as of guttur human voic talk in a languag that she could
not understand rise to her knee she peer out of the hole in the
tree it wa night but the star shone brilliantli and their light
fell upon an open circl of ground close by the edg of the river in
thi circl there burn a great fire and at a littl distanc from the
fire were gather eight or ten horriblelook be who appear to
be rejoic over someth that lai upon the ground thei were small in
statur men and women togeth but no children and all of them were
nearli nake their hair wa long and thin grow down almost to the
ey their jaw and teeth protrud and the girth of their black bodi
wa out of all proport to their height in their hand thei held
stick with sharp stone lash on to them or rude hatchetlik knive
of the same materi
now nanea heart shrank within her and she nearli faint with fear
for she knew that she wa in the haunt forest and without a doubt
these were the esemkofu the evil ghost that dwelt therein ye that
wa what thei were and yet she could not take her ey off themth
sight of them held her with a horribl fascin but if thei were
ghost why did thei sing and danc like men why did thei wave those
sharp stone aloft and quarrel and strike each other and why did thei
make a fire as men do when thei wish to cook food more what wa it
that thei rejoic over that long dark thing which lai so quiet upon
the ground it did not look like a head of game and it could scarc
be a crocodil yet clearli it wa food of some sort for thei were
sharpen the stone knive in order to cut it up
while she wonder thu on of the dreadfullook littl creatur
advanc to the fire and take from it a burn bough held it over
the thing that lai upon the ground to give light to a companion who
wa about to do someth to it with the stone knife next instant nanea
drew back her head from the hole a stifl shriek upon her lip she
saw what it wa nowit wa the bodi of a man ye and these were no
ghost thei were cannib of whom when she wa littl her mother had
told her tale to keep her from wander awai from home
but who wa the man thei were about to eat it could not be on of
themselv for hi statur wa much greater oh now she knew it must
be nahoon who had been kill up yonder and whose dead bodi the water
had brought down to the haunt forest as thei had brought her aliv
ye it must be nahoon and she would be forc to see her husband
devour befor her ey the thought of it overwhelm her that he
should die by order of the king wa natur but that he should be
buri thu yet what could she do to prevent it well if it cost her
her life it should be prevent at the worst thei could onli kill
and eat her also and now that nahoon and her father were gone be
untroubl by ani religi or spiritu hope and fear she wa not
greatli concern to keep her own breath in her
slip through the hole in the tree nanea walk quietli toward the
cannibalsnot know in the least what she should do when she reach
them as she arriv in line with the fire thi lack of programm came
home to her mind forcibl and she paus to reflect just then on of
the cannib look up to see a tall and state figur wrap in a
white garment which as the flamelight flicker on it seem now to
advanc from the dens background of shadow and now to reced into it
the poor savag wretch wa hold a stone knife in hi teeth when he
beheld her but it did not remain there long for open hi great
jaw he utter the most terrifi and pierc yell that nanea had
ever heard then the other saw her also and present the forest wa
ring with shriek of fear for a few second the outcast stood
and gaze then thei were gone thi wai and that burst their path
through the undergrowth like startl jackal the esemkofu of zulu
tradit had been rout in their own haunt home by what thei took to
be a spirit
poor esemkofu thei were but miser and starv bushmen who

forest after him came nahoon hi tongu hang from hi jaw like the
tongu of a wolf
now he wa in the shadow of the forest but still he sped on follow
the cours of the river till at length hi breath fail and he halt
on the further side of a littl glade beyond which a great tree grew
nahoon wa more than a spear throw behind him therefor he had time
to draw hi pistol and make readi
