oh kind is death that life long troubl close
yet at death come life shrink back affright
it see the dark handnot that it enclos
a cup of light
so oft the spirit see love draw nigh
as neath the shadow of destruct quak
for self dark tyrant of the soul must die
when love awak
ay let him die in dark but for thee
breath thou the breath of morn and be free

a mist wraith
the autumn afternoon wa fade into even it had been cloudi
weather but the cloud had soften and broken up now thei were lost
in slowli darken blue the sea wa perfectli and utterli still it
seem to sleep but in it sleep it still wax with the rise tide
the ey could not mark it slow increas but beatric stand upon
the farthest point of the dog rock idli note that the long brown
weed which clung about their side began to lift as the water took
their weight till at last the delic pattern float out and lai like
a woman hair upon the green depth of sea meanwhil a mist wa grow
dens and soft upon the quiet water it wa not blown up from the west
it simpli grew like the twilight make the silenc yet more silent and
blot awai the outlin of the land beatric gave up studi the
seawe and watch the gather of these fleeci host
what a curiou even she said aloud to herself speak in a low
full voic i have not seen on like it sinc mother di and that
is seven year ago iv grown sinc then grown everi wai and she
laugh somewhat sadli and look at her own reflect in the quiet
water
she could not have look at anyth more charm for it would have
been hard to find a girl of nobler mien than beatric granger as on thi
her twentysecond birthdai she stood and gaze into that misti sea
of rather more than middl height and model like a statu strength
and health seem to radiat from her form but it wa her face with the
stamp of intellect and power shadow it woman loveli that must
have made her remark among women even more beauti than herself
there ar mani girl who have rich brown hair like some autumn leaf
here and there just yellow into gold girl whose deep grei ey can
grow tender as a dove or flash like the stir water of a northern
sea and whose bloom can bear comparison with the wild rose but few
can show a face like that which upon thi dai first dawn on geoffrei
bingham to hi sorrow and hi hope it wa strong and pure and sweet as
the keen sea breath and look on it on must know that beneath thi
fair cloak lai a wit as fair and yet it wa all womanli here wa not
the hard sexless stamp of the cultur femal she who own it wa
capabl of mani thing she could love and she could suffer and if need
be she could dare or die it wa to be read upon that love brow and
face and in the depth of those grei eyesthat is by those to whom
the book of charact is open and who wish to studi it
but beatric wa not think of her loveli as she gaze into the
water she knew that she wa beauti of cours her beauti wa too
obviou to be overlook and besid it had been brought home to her in
sever more or less disagre wai
seven year she wa think sinc the night of the death fog
that wa what old edward call it and so it wa i wa onli so high
then and follow her thought she touch herself upon the breast
and i wa happi too in my own wai why cant on alwai be fifteen
and believ everyth on is told and she sigh seven year and
noth done yet work work and noth come out of the work and
everyth fade awai i think that life is veri dreari when on ha
lost everyth and found noth and love nobodi i wonder what it
will be like in anoth seven year
she cover her ey with her hand and then take them awai onc
more look at the water such light as struggl through the fog
wa behind her and the mist wa thicken at first she had some
difficulti in trace her own like upon the glassi surfac but
gradual she mark it outlin it stretch awai from her and it
appear wa as though she herself were ly on her back in the water
wrap about with the fleeci mist how curiou it seem she thought
what is it that reflect remind me of with the white all round it
next instant she gave a littl cry and turn sharpli awai she knew
now it recal her mother as she had last seen her seven year ago
chapter ii
at the bell rock
a mile or more awai from where beatric stood and saw vision and
further up the coastlin a second group of rock known from their
colour as the red rock or sometim for anoth reason as the bell
rock jut out between half and threequart of a mile into the
water of the welsh bai that li behind rumbal point at low tide
these rock ar bare so that a man mai walk or wade to their extrem
but when the flood is full onli on or two of the veri largest can from
time to time be seen project their weedwreath head through the
wash of the shorebound wave in certain set of the wind and tide thi
is a terribl and most danger spot in rough weather as more than
on vessel have learnt to their cost so long ago as 1780 a threedeck
manofwar went ashor there in a furiou winter gale and with on
except everi live soul on board of her to the number of seven
hundr wa drown the on except wa a man in iron who came
safe and seren ashor seat upon a piec of wreckag nobodi ever
knew how the shipwreck happen least of all the survivor in iron but
the tradit of the terror of the scene yet live in the district and
the spot where the bone of the drown men still peep grimli through
the sand is not unnatur suppos to be haunt ever sinc thi
catastroph a larg bell it wa origin the bell of the illfat
vessel itself and still bear her name hm thunder stamp upon
it metal ha been fix upon the highest rock and in time of storm
and at high tide send it solemn note of warn boom across the
deep
but the bell wa quiet now and just beneath it in the shadow of the
rock whereon it wa place a man half hidden in seawe with which he
appear to have purpos cover himself wa seat upon a piec of
wreck in appear he wa a veri fine man bigshould and broad
limb and hi ag might have been thirtyf or a littl more of hi
frame howev what between the mist and the unpleasantli damp seawe
with which he wa wreath not much wa to be seen but such light as
there wa fell upon hi face as he peer eagerli over and round the
rock and glint down the barrel of the doubl tenbor gun which he
held across hi knee it wa a strike counten with it brownish
ey dark peak beard and strong featur veri power and veri
abl and yet there wa a certain soft in the face which hover
round the region of the mouth like light at the edg of a dark cloud
hint at gentl sunshin but littl of thi wa visibl now geoffrei
bingham barristeratlaw of the inner templ ma wa engag with
a veri seriou occup he wa try to shoot curlew as thei pass
over hi hidingplac on their wai to the mud bank where thei feed
further along the coast
now if there is a thing in the world which call for the exercis of
man everi faculti it is curlew shoot in a mist perhap he mai
wait for an hour or even two hour and see noth not even an
oystercatch then at last from mile awai come the faint wild call
of curlew on the wing he strain hi ey the call come nearer but
noth can he see at last seventi yard or more to the right he
catch sight of the flicker of beat wing and like a flash thei
ar gone again a callth curlew ar flight he look and look in
hi excit struggl to hi feet and rais hi head incauti
far abov the shelter rock there thei come a great flock of
thirti or more bear straight down on him a hundr yard
offeightysixtynow up goe the gun but ala and ala thei catch
a glimps of the light glint on the barrel and perhap of the head
behind them and in anoth second thei have broken and scatter thi
wai and that wai twist off like a wisp of gigant snipe to vanish
with melancholi cri into the depth of mist
thi is bad but the ardent sportsman sit down with a groan and wait
listen to the soft lap of the tide and then at last virtu is
reward first of all two wild duck come over cleav the air like
arrow the mallard is miss but the left barrel reach the duck
and down it come with a full and satisfi thud hardli have the
cartridg been replac when the wild cry of the curlew is onc more
heardquit close thi time there thei ar loom larg against the
fog bang down goe the first and li flap among the rock like
a flash the second is awai to the left bang after him and caught
him too hark to the splash as he fall into the deep water fifti yard
awai and then the mist close in so dens that shoot is done with
for the dai well that right and left ha been worth three hour wait
in the wet seawe and the violent cold that mai followthat is to ani
man who ha a soul for true sport
just such an experi as thi had befallen geoffrei bingham he had
bag hi wild duck and hi brace of curlewthat is he had bag on
of them for the other wa float in the seawhen a sudden increas
in the densiti of the mist put a stop to further oper he shook
the wet seawe off hi rough cloth and have lit a short briar
pipe set to work to hunt for the duck and the first curfew he found
them easili enough and then walk to the edg of the rock up the
side of which the tide wa gradual creep peer into the mist to
see if he could find the other present the fog lift a littl and
he discov the bird float on the oili water about fifti yard
awai a littl to the left the rock ran out in a peak and he knew
from experi that the tide set toward the shore would carri the
curlew past thi peak so he went to it extrem sat down upon a
big stone and wait all thi while the tide wa rise fast though
intent as he wa upon bring the curlew to bag he did not pai much
heed to it forget that it wa cut him off from the land at
last after more than halfanhour of wait he caught sight of the
curlew again but as bad luck would have it it wa still twenti yard
or more from him and in deep water he wa determin howev to get
the bird if he could for geoffrei hate leav hi game so he pull
up hi trouser and set to work to wade toward it for the first few
step all went well but the fourth or fifth land him in a hole that
wet hi right leg nearli up to the thigh and gave hi ankl a sever
twist reflect that it would be veri awkward if he sprain hi ankl
in such a lone place he beat a retreat and bethought him unless
the curlew wa to becom food for the dogfish that he had better
strip bodili and swim for it thisfor geoffrei wa a man of determin
mindh decid to do and had alreadi taken off hi coat and waistcoat
to that end when suddenli some sort of a boath judg it to be a
cano from the slight of it shapeloom up in the mist befor
him an idea struck him the cano or it occup if anybodi could be
insan enough to come out cano in such water might fetch the curlew
and save him a swim
hi he shout in stentorian tone hullo there
ye answer a woman gentl voic across the water
oh he repli struggl to get into hi waistcoat again for the
voic told him that he wa deal with some befog ladi im sure
i beg your pardon but would you do me a favour there is a dead curlew
float about not ten yard from your boat if you wouldnt mind
a white hand wa put forward and the cano glide on toward the bird
present the hand plung downward into the misti water and the
curlew wa bag then while geoffrei wa still struggl with hi
waistcoat the cano sped toward him like a dream boat and in anoth
moment it wa beneath hi rock and a sweet dim face wa look up into
hi own
now let us go back a littl ala that the privileg should be peculiar
to the record of thing done and see how it came about that beatric
granger wa present to retriev geoffrei bingham dead curlew
immedi after the unpleas idea record in the last or to be
more accur in the first chapter of thi comedi had impress itself
upon beatric mind she came to the conclus that she had seen
enough of the dog rock for on afternoon thereon like a sensibl
person she set herself to quit them in the same wai that she had
reach them name by mean of a cano she got into her cano safe
enough and paddl a littl wai out to sea with a view of return
to the place whenc she came but the further she went out and it wa
necessari that she should go some wai on account of the rock and the
current the denser grew the fog sound came through it inde but
she could not clearli distinguish whenc thei came till at last well
as she knew the coast she grew confus as to whither she wa head
in thi dilemma while she rest on her paddl stare into the dens
surround mist and keep her grei ey as wide open as natur would
allow and that wa veri wide she heard the report of a gun behind her
to the right argu to herself that some wildfowl on the water
must have fire it who would be abl to direct her she turn the
cano round and paddl swiftli in the direct whenc the sound came
present she heard the gun again both barrel were fire in there to
the right but some wai off she paddl on vigor but now no more
shot came to guid her therefor for a while her search wa fruitless
at last howev she saw someth loom through the mist ahead it
wa the red rock though she did not know it and she drew near with
caution till geoffrei shout broke upon her ear
she pick up the dead bird and paddl toward the dim figur who wa
evid wrestl with someth she could not see what
here is the curlew sir she said
oh thank you answer the figur on the rock i am infinit
oblig to you i wa just go to swim for it i cant bear lose my
game it seem so cruel to shoot bird for noth
i dare sai that you will not make much us of it now that you have
got it said the gentl voic in the cano curlew ar not veri good
eat
that is scarc the point repli the cruso on the rock the point
is to bring them home apr cela
the birdstuff said the voic
no answer cruso the cook
a laugh came back from the canoeand then a question
prai mr bingham can you tell me where i am i have quit lost my
reckon in the mist
he start how did thi mysteri young ladi in a boat know hi name
you ar at the red rock there is the bell that grei thing
missmiss
beatric granger she put in hastili my father is the clergyman of
bryngelli i saw you when you and ladi honoria bingham look into the
school yesterdai i teach in the school she did not tell him howev
that hi face had interest her so much that she had ask hi name
again he start he had heard of thi young ladi somebodi had told him
that she wa the prettiest girl in wale and the cleverest but that
her father wa not a gentleman
oh he said take off hi hat in the direct of the cano isnt
it a littl riski miss granger for you to be cano alon in thi
mist
ye she answer frankli but i am us to it i go out cano in
all possibl weather it is my amus and after all the risk doe
not matter much she ad more to herself than to him
while he wa wonder what she meant by that dark sai she went on
quickli
do you know mr bingham i think that you ar in more danger than i
am it must be get near seven oclock and the tide is high at a
quarter to eight unless i am mistaken there is by now nearli half a
mile of deep water between you and the shore
my word he said i forgot all about the tide what between the
shoot and look for that curlew and the mist it never occur to
me that it wa get late i suppos i must swim for it that is all
no no she answer earnestli it is veri danger swim here
the place is full of sharp rock and there is a tremend current
well then what is to be done will your cano carri two if so
perhap you would kindli put me ashor
ye she said it is a doubl cano but i dare not take you ashor
here there ar too mani rock and it is imposs to see the rippl
on them in thi mist we should sink the cano no you must get in and
i must paddl you home to bryngelli that all now that i know where i
am i think that i can find the wai
realli he said you ar veri good
not at all she answer you see i must go myself anyhow so i shall
be glad of your help it is nearli five mile by water you know and
not a pleasant night
there wa truth in thi geoffrei wa perfectli prepar to risk a swim
to the shore on hi own account but he did not at all like the idea of
leav thi young ladi to find her own wai back to bryngelli through
the mist and gather dark and in that frail cano he would not
have like it if she had been a man for he knew that there wa great
risk in such a voyag so after make on more fruitless suggest
that thei should try and reach the shore take the chanc of rock
sunken or otherwis and then walk home to which beatric would not
consent he accept her offer
at the least you will allow me to paddl he said as she skilfulli
brought the cano right under hi rock which the tide wa now high
enough to allow her to do
if you like she answer doubtfulli my hand ar a littl sore
and of cours with a glanc at hi broad shoulder you ar much
stronger but if you ar not us to it i dare sai that i should get on
as well as you
nonsens he said sharpli i will not allow you to paddl me for five
mile
she yield without anoth word and veri gingerli shift her seat so
that her back wa toward the bow of the cano leav him to occupi
the paddl place opposit to her
then he hand her hi gun which togeth with the dead bird she
carefulli stow in the bottom of the frail craft next with great
caution he slid down the rock till hi feet rest in the cano
be care or you will upset us she said lean forward and
stretch out her hand for him to support himself by
then it wa as he took it that he for the first time realli saw her
face with the mist drop hang to the bent eyelash and knew how
beauti it wa
chapter iii
a confess of faith
ar you readi he said recov himself from the pleas shock of
thi sergedrap vision of the mist
ye said beatric you must head straight out to sea for a
littlenot too far for if we get beyond the shelter of rumbal point
we might founder in the rollersther ar alwai roller therethen
steer to the left i will tell you when and mr bingham pleas be
care of the paddl it ha been splice and wont bear rough usag
all right he answer and thei start gaili enough the light cano
glide swiftli forward beneath hi sturdi stroke
beatric wa lean back with her head bent a littl forward so that
he could onli see her chin and the sweet curv of the lip abov it but
she could see all hi face as it swai toward her with each motion of
the paddl and she watch it with interest it wa a new type of face
to her so strong and manli and yet so gentl about the mouthalmost
too gentl she thought what made him marri ladi honoria beatric
wonder she did not look particularli gentl though she wa such a
grace woman
and thu thei went on for some time each wonder about the other and
at heart admir the other which wa not strang for thei were a veri
proper pair but sai no word till at last after about a quarter of
an hour hard paddl geoffrei paus to rest
do you do much of thi kind of thing miss granger he said with a
gasp becaus it is rather hard work
she laugh ah she said i thought you would scarc go on
paddl at that rate ye i cano a great deal in the summer time it
is my wai of take exercis and i can swim well so i am not afraid
of an upset at least it ha been my wai for the last two year sinc a
ladi who wa stai here gave me the cano when she went awai befor
that i us to row in a boatthat is befor i went to colleg
colleg what colleg girton
oh no noth half so grand it wa a colleg where you get
certif that you ar qualifi to be a mistress in a board school
i wish it had been girton
do youyou ar too good for that he wa go to add but chang
it toi think you were as well awai i dont care about the girton
stamp those of them whom i have known ar so hard
so much the better for them she answer i should like to be hard
as a stone a stone cannot feel dont you think that women ought to
learn then

greek
i can read it fairli but i am not a greek scholar
mathemat
no i gave them up there is no human natur about mathemat thei
work everyth to a fix conclus that must result life is not like
that what ought to be a squar come out a right angl and x alwai
equal an unknown quantiti which is never ascertain till you ar
dead
good graciou thought geoffrei to himself between the stroke of the
paddl what an extraordinari girl a fleshandblood bluestock
and a love on into the bargain at ani rate i will bowl her out thi
time
perhap you have read law too he said with suppress sarcasm
i have read some she answer calmli i like law especi equiti
law it is so subtl and there is such a mass of it built upon such
a small foundat it is like an overgrown mushroom and the top will
fall off on dai howev hard the lawyer try to prop it up perhap
you can tell me
no im sure i cannot he answer im not a chanceri man i am
common law and i dont take all knowledg for my provinc you
posit alarm me miss granger i wonder that the cano doe not sink
beneath so much learn
do i she answer sweetli i am glad that i have live to frighten
somebodi i meant that i like equiti to studi but if i were a
barrist i would be common law becaus there is so much more life
and struggl about it exist is not worth have unless on is
struggl with someth and try to overcom it
dear me what a repos prospect said geoffrei aghast he had
certainli never met such a woman as thi befor
repos is onli good when it is earn went on the fair philosoph
and in order to fit on to earn some more otherwis it becom
idl and that is miseri fanci be idl when on ha such a
littl time to live the onli thing to do is to work and stifl thought
i suppos that you have a larg practic mr bingham
you should not ask a barrist that question he answer laugh
it is like look at the pictur which an artist ha turn to the
wall no to be frank i have not i have onli taken to practis in
earnest dure the last two year befor i wa a barrist in name and
that is all
then why did you suddenli begin to work
becaus i lost my prospect miss grangerfrom necess in short
oh i beg your pardon she said with a blush which of cours he
could not see i did not mean to be rude but it is veri lucki for you
is it not
inde some peopl dont think so why is it lucki
becaus you will now rise and becom a great man and that is more than
be a rich man
and why do you think that i shall becom a great man he ask
stop paddl in hi astonish and look at the dim form befor
him
oh becaus it is written on your face she answer simpli
her word rang true there wa no flatteri or artific in them geoffrei
felt that the girl wa sai just what she thought
so you studi physiognomi as well he said well miss granger it is
rather odd consid all thing but i will sai to you what i have
never said to ani on befor i believ that you ar right i shall
rise if i live i feel that i have it in me
at thi point it possibl occur to beatric that consid
the exceed breviti of their acquaint thei were drift into
somewhat confidenti convers at ani rate she quickli chang the
topic
i am afraid you ar grow tire she said but we must be get
on it will soon be quit dark and we have still a long wai to go look
there and she point seaward
he look the whole bank of mist wa break up and bear down on
them in enorm billow of vapour present these were roll over
them so darken the heavi air that though the pair were within four
feet of each other thei could scarc see on anoth face as yet
thei felt no wind the dens weight of mist choke the keen impel
air
i think the weather is break we ar go to have a storm said
beatric a littl anxious
scarc were the word out of her mouth when the mist pass awai from
them and from all the seaward expans of ocean not a wrack of it wa
left and in it place the strong seabreath beat upon their face far
in the west the angri disc of the sun wa sink into the foam a great
red rai shot from it bent edg and lai upon the awaken water like a
path of fire the omin light fell full upon the littl boat and full
upon beatric lip then it pass on and lost itself in the deep
mist which still swath the coast
oh how beauti it is she cri rais herself and point to
the glori of the dy sun
it is beauti inde he answer but he look not at the sunset
but at the woman face befor him glow like a saint in it golden
aureol for thi also wa most beautifulso beauti that it stir
him strang
it is like she began and broke off suddenli
what is it like he ask
it is like find truth at last she answer speak as much to
herself as to him why on might make an allegori out of it we wander
in mist and dark shape a vagu cours for home and then suddenli
the mist ar blown awai glori fill the air and there is no more
doubt onli befor us is a splendour make all thing clear and
light us over a deathless sea it sound rather too grand she
ad with a charm littl laugh but there is someth in it
somewher if onli i could express myself oh look
as she spoke a heavi stormcloud roll over the vanish rim of the
sun for a moment the light struggl with the eclips cloud turn
it dull edg to the hue of copper but the cloud wa too strong and the
light vanish leav the sea in dark
well he said your allegori would have a dismal end if you work it
out it is get as dark as pitch and there a good deal in that
if onli i could express myself
beatric drop poetri and came down to fact in a wai that wa veri
commend
there is a squall come up mr bingham she said you must paddl
as hard as you can i do not think we ar more than two mile from
bryngelli and if we ar lucki we mai get there befor the weather
break
ye if we ar lucki he said grimli as he bent himself to the
work but the question is where to paddl toit so dark had not we
better run for the shore
we ar in the middl of the bai now she answer and almost as far
from the nearest land as we ar from bryngelli besid it is all rock
no you must go straight on you will see the pois light beyond co
present you know co is four mile on the other side of bryngelli
so when you see it head to the left
he obei her and thei neither of them spoke ani more for some time
inde the rise wind made convers difficult and so far as
geoffrei wa concern he had littl breath left to spare for word he
wa a strong man but the unaccustom labour wa begin to tell on
him and hi hand were blister for ten minut or so he paddl on
through a dark which wa now almost total wonder where on earth
he wa wend for it wa quit imposs to see for all he knew
to the contrari he might be circl round and round he had onli on
thing to direct him the sweep of the continu rise wind and the
wash of the gather wave so long as these struck the cano which
now began to roll omin on the starboard side he must he thought
be keep a right cours but in the turmoil of the rise gale and the
confus of the night thi wa no veri satisfactori guid at length
howev a broad and brilliant flash sprung out across the sea almost
straight ahead of him it wa the pois light
he alter hi cours a littl and paddl steadili on and now the
squall wa break fortun it wa not a veri heavi on or their
frail craft must have sunk and thei with it but it wa quit seriou
enough to put them in great danger the cano rose to the wave like a
feather but she wa broadsid on and rise as she would thei began to
ship a littl water and thei had not seen the worst of it the weather
wa still thicken
still he held on though hi heart sank within him while beatric said
noth present a big wave came he could just see it white crest
gleam through the gloom then it wa on them the cano rose to it
gallantli it seem to curl right over her make the craft roll
till geoffrei thought that the end had come but she rode it out not
howev without ship more than a bucket of water without sai
a word beatric took the cloth cap from her head and lean forward
began to bale as best she could and that wa not veri well
thi will not do he call i must keep her head to the sea or we
shall be swamp
ye she answer keep her head up we ar in great danger
he glanc to hi right anoth white sea wa heav down on him
he could just see it glitter crest with all hi forc he dug the
paddl into the water the cano answer to it she came round just in
time to ride out the wave with safeti but the paddl snap it wa
alreadi sprung and the weight he put upon it wa more than it could
bear right in two it broke some nine inch abov that blade which at
the moment wa buri in the water he felt it go and despair took hold
of him
great heaven he cri the paddl is broken
beatric gasp
you must us the other blade she said paddl first on side and
then on the other and keep her head on
till we sink he answer
no till we ar savednev talk of sink
the girl courag shame him and he obei her instruct as best he
could by dint of continu shift what remain of the paddl from
on side of the cano to the other he did manag to keep her head on to
the wave that were now roll in apac but in their heart thei both
wonder how long thi would last
have you got ani cartridg she ask present
ye in my coat pocket he answer
give me two if you can manag it she said
in an interv between the come of two sea he contriv to slip hi
hand into a pocket and transfer the cartridg appar she knew
someth of the work of a gun for present there wa a flash and a
report quickli follow by anoth
give me some more cartridg she cri he did so but noth
follow
it is no us she said at length the cartridg ar wet i cannot
get the empti case out but perhap thei mai have seen or heard them
old edward is sure to be watch for me you had better throw the rest
into the sea if you can manag it she ad by wai of an afterthought
we mai have to swim present
to geoffrei thi seem veri probabl and whenev he got a chanc he
act on the hint till at length he wa rid of all hi cartridg
just then it began to rain in torrent though it wa not warm the
perspir wa stream from him at everi pore and the rain beat
on hi face refresh him somewhat also with the rain the wind drop
a littl
but he wa becom tire out and he knew it soon he would no longer be
abl to keep the cano straight and then thei must be swamp and in
all human probabl drown so thi wa to be the end of hi life
and it ambit befor anoth hour had run it cours he would be
roll to and fro in the arm of that angri sea what would hi wife
honoria sai when she heard the new he wonder perhap it would shock
her into some show of feel and effi hi dear littl sixyearold
daughter well thank god she wa too young to feel hi loss for long
by the time that she wa a woman she would almost have forgotten that
she ever had a father but how would she get on without him to guid
her her mother did not love children and a grow girl would
continu remind her of her grow year he could not tell he could
onli hope for the best
and for himself what would becom of him after the short sharp struggl
for life should he find endless sleep or what he wa a christian and
hi life had not been wors than that of other men inde though he
would have been the last to think it he had some redeem virtu but
now at the end the spiritu horizon wa as dark as it had been at the
begin there befor him were the gate of death but not yet would
thei roll asid and show the travel what lai beyond their frown
face how could he tell perhap thei would not open at all perhap he
now bade hi last farewel to conscious to earth and sky and sea

prospect at that moment geoffrei bingham in the last agoni of doubt
would gladli have exchang hi hope of life beyond for a certainti of
etern sleep that faith which enabl some of us to tread thi aw
wai with an utter confid is not a wide prerog and as yet
at ani rate it wa not hi though the time might come when he would
attain it there ar not veri mani even among those without reproach
who can lai them down in the arm of death know most certainli that
when the veil is rent awai the counten that thei shall see will
be that of the bless guardian of mankind ala he could not be
altogeth sure and where doubt exist hope is but a pinprick
bladder he sigh heavili murmur a littl formula of prayer that had
been on hi lip most night dure thirti yearsh had learnt it as
a child at hi mother kneeand then while the tempest roar around
him gather up hi strength to meet the end which seem inevit
at ani rate he would die like a man
then came a reaction hi vital forc rose again he no longer felt
fear he onli wonder with a strang imperson wonder as a man
wonder about the vital affair of anoth then from wonder about
himself he began to wonder about the girl who sat opposit to him with
the rain came a littl lightn and by the first flash he saw her
clearli her beauti face wa set and as she bent forward search
the dark with her wide ey it wore he thought an almost defiant
air
the cano twist round somewhat he dug hi broken paddl into the
water and onc more brought her head on to the sea then he spoke

no she answer i am not afraid
do you know that we shall probabl be drown

me that i should have tri to row you ashor as you said
never mind me a man must meet hi fate some dai do not think of
me but i cant keep her head on much longer you had better sai your
prayer
beatric bent forward till her head wa quit near hi own the wind had
blown some of her hair loos and though he did not seem to notic it at
the time he rememb afterward that a lock of it struck him on the
face
i cannot prai she said i have noth to prai to i am not a
christian
the word struck him like a blow it seem so aw to think of
thi proud and brilliant woman now balanc on the verg of what she
believ to be utter annihil even the courag that induc her at
such a moment to confess her hopeless state seem aw
try he said with a gasp
no she answer i do not fear to die death cannot be wors than
life is for most of us i have not prai for year not sincewel
never mind i am not a coward it would be cowardli to prai now becaus
i mai be wrong if there is a god who know all he will understand
that
geoffrei said no more but labour at the broken paddl gallantli and
with an everfail strength the lightn had pass awai and the
dark wa veri great for the hurri cloud hid the starlight
present a sound aros abov the turmoil of the storm a crash
thunder sound toward which the send of the sea gradual bore them
the sound came from the wave that beat upon the bryngelli reef
where ar we drift to he cri
into the breaker where we shall be lost she answer calmli give
up paddl it is of no us and try to take off your coat i have
loosen my skirt perhap we can swim ashor
he thought to himself that in the dark and breaker such an event wa
not probabl but he said noth and address himself to the task
of get rid of hi coat and waistcoatno easi on in that confin
space meanwhil the cano wa whirl round and round like a walnut
shell upon a flood gutter for some distanc befor the wave broke
upon the reef and rock thei swept in toward them with a steadi
foamless swell on reach the shallow howev thei push their
white shoulder high into the air curv up and fell in thunder on the
reef
the cano rode toward the breaker suck upon it cours by a
swell sea
goodby call geoffrei to beatric as stretch out hi wet hand
he found her own and took it for companionship make death a littl
easier
goodby she cri cling to hi hand oh why did i bring you
into thi
for in their last extrem thi woman thought rather of her companion
in peril than of herself
on more turn then suddenli the cano beneath them wa lift like a
straw and toss high into the air a mighti mass of water boil up
beneath it and around it then the foam rush in and vagu geoffrei
knew that thei were wrap in the curv of a billow
a swift and mighti rush of water crashand hi sens left him
chapter iv
the watcher at the door
thi wa what had happen just about the centr of the reef is a larg
flattop rockit mai be twenti feet in the squareknown to the
bryngelli fishermen as tabl rock in ordinari weather even at high
tide the water scarc cover thi rock but when there is ani sea
thei wash over it with great violenc on to thi rock geoffrei and
beatric had been hurl by the breaker fortun for them it wa
thickli overgrown with seawe which to some slight extent broke the
violenc of their fall as it chanc geoffrei wa knock senseless by
the shock but beatric whose hand he still held fell on to him and
with the except of a few bruis and a shake escap unhurt
she struggl to her knee gasp the water had run off the rock and
her companion lai quiet at her side she put down her face and call
into hi ear but no answer came and then she knew that he wa either
dead or senseless
at thi second beatric caught a glimps of someth white gleam in
the dark instinct she flung herself upon her face grip
the long tough seawe with on hand the other she pass round the
bodi of the helpless man besid her strain him with all her strength
against her side
then came a wild long rush of foam the water lift her from the rock
but the seawe held and when at length the sea had gone boil by
beatric found herself and the senseless form of geoffrei onc more
ly side by side she wa half choke desper she struggl up
and round look shoreward through the dark heaven there not
a hundr yard awai a light shone upon the water it wa a boat
light for it move up and down she fill her lung with air and sent
on long cry for help ring across the sea a moment pass and she
thought that she heard an answer but becaus of the wind and the roar
of the breaker she could not be sure then she turn and glanc
seaward again the foam terror wa rush down upon them again she
flung herself upon the rock and grasp the slipperi seawe twine her
left arm about the helpless geoffrei

then anoth wave roll forward and onc more she wa push down into
the cruel depth for with that dead weight hang to her she could
not keep abov them it flash into her mind that if she let him go she
might even now save herself but even in that last terror thi beatric
would not do if he went she would go with him
it would have been better if she had let him go

she had been dead i think that i must have di too oh god i thank

the idea that owen davi esq jp dl of bryngelli castl
absolut owner of that rise littl wateringplac and of on of
the largest and most prosper slate quarri in wale worth in all
somewher between seven and ten thousand a year wa unfit to black
her beauti sister boot wa not an idea that had struck elizabeth
granger had it struck her inde it would have move her to laughter
for elizabeth had a practic mind
what did strike her as she turn and watch the rich squir sturdi
form vanish through the doorwai into the dark beyond wa a certain
sens of wonder suppos she had never seen that shiver of return
life run up those white limb suppos that thei had grown colder
and colder till at length it wa evid that death wa so firmli
citadel within the silent heart that no human skill could beat hi
empir back what then owen davi love her sister thi she knew and
had known for year but would he not have got over it in time would
he not in time have been overpow by the sens of hi own utter
loneli and given hi hand if not hi heart to some other woman
and could not she who held hi hand learn to reach hi heart and to
whom would that hand have been given the hand and all that went
with it what woman would thi shy welsh hermit without friend or
relat have ever been thrown in with except herselfelizabethwho
love him as much as she could love anybodi which perhap wa not
veri much who at ani rate desir sore to be hi wife would not
all thi have come about if she had never seen that eyelid trembl
and that slight quiver run up her sister limb it wouldsh knew it
would
elizabeth thought of it as for a moment she stood in the passag and a
cold hungri light came into her neutral tint ey and shone upon her
pale face but she choke back the thought she wa scarc wick
enough to wish that her sister had not been brought back to life she
onli specul on what might have happen if thi had come about just
as on work out a game of chess from a given hypothet situat of
the piec
perhap too the same end might be gain in some other wai perhap
mr davi might still be wean from hi infatu the wall wa
difficult but it would have to be veri difficult if she could not find
a wai to climb it it never occur to elizabeth that there might be
an open gate she could not conceiv it possibl that a woman might
posit reject owen davi and hi seven or ten thousand a year and
that woman a person in an unsatisfactori and uncongeni almost in
a menial posit reject bryngelli castl with all it luxuri and
opportun of wealth and leisur no the sun would set in the east
befor such a thing happen the plan wa to prevent the occas from
aris the hungri light di on elizabeth face and she turn to
enter the sick room when suddenli she met her father come out
who wa that at the front he ask carefulli close the door
mr davi of bryngelli castl father
and what did mr davi want at thi time of night to know about
beatric
ye she answer slowli he came to ask after beatric or to be
more correct he ha been wait outsid for three hour in the rain to
learn if she recov
wait outsid for three hour in the rain said the clergyman
astonishedsquir davi stand outsid the hous what for
becaus he wa so anxiou about beatric and did not like to come in i
suppos
so anxiou about beatriceah so anxiou about beatric do you
think elizabethumy know there is no doubt beatric is veri well
favouredveri handsom thei sai
i do not think anyth about it father she answer and as for
beatric look thei ar a matter of opinion i have mine and now
dont you think we had better go to bed the doctor and betti ar go
to stop up all night with mr bingham and beatric
ye elizabeth i suppos that we had better go i am sure we have much
to be thank for tonight what a merci deliver and if poor
beatric had gone the parish must have found anoth schoolmistress and
it would have meant that we lost the salari we have a great deal to be
thank for elizabeth
ye said elizabeth veri deliber we have
chapter vi
owen davi at home
owen davi tramp along the cliff with a light heart the wild lash
of the rain and the roar of the wind did not disturb him in the
least thei were disagre but he accept them as he accept
exist and all it vaniti without remark or mental comment there
is a class of mind of which thi is the prevail attitud veri
earli in their span of life those endow with such a mind come to the
conclus that the world is too much for them thei cannot understand
it so thei abandon the attempt and as a consequ in their own
torpid wai thei ar among the happiest and most content of men
problem on which person of keener intellig and more aspir soul
fret and foam their live awai as rush water round a rock do not
even break the placid surfac of their dai such men slip past them
thei look out upon the star and read of the mysteri of the univers
speed on for ever through the limitless wast of space and ar not
astonish in their childhood thei were taught that god made the sun
and the star to give light on the earth that is enough for them and
so it is with everyth poverti and suffer war pestil and
the inequ of fate mad life and death and the spiritu
wonder that hedg in our be ar thing not to be inquir into but
accept so thei accept them as thei do their dinner or a tradesman
circular
in some case thi mental state ha it root in deep and simpl
religi convict and in some it spring from a preponder
of health anim instinct over the higher but more troublesom
spiritu part the ox chew the cud in the fresh meadow doe not
muse upon the past and futur and the gull blown like a foamflak out
against the sunset doe not know the splendour of the sky and sea
even the savag is not much troubl about the scheme of thing in the
begin he wa torn out of the reed and in the end he melt into
the unknown and for the rest there ar beef and wive and foe to
conquer but then oxen and gull ar not so far as we know troubl
with ani spiritu part at all and in the nobl savag such thing ar
not cultiv thei come with civil
but perhap in the major thi condit so necessari to the more
placid form of happi is born of a conjunct of physic and
religi develop so it wa at least with the rich and fortun
man whom we have seen trudg along the windswept cliff by natur and
educ he wa of a strongli and simpli religi mind as he wa in
bodi power placid and healthi to an exasper degre it mai be
said that it is easi to be religi and placid on ten thousand a year
but owen davi had not alwai enjoi ten thousand a year and on of
the most romant and beauti seat in wale from the time he wa
seventeen when hi mother death left him an orphan till he reach
the ag of thirti some six year from the date of the open of thi
histori he led about as hard a life as fate could find for ani man
some peopl mai have heard of sugar droger or sail brig which
trade between thi countri and the west indi carri coal outward
and sugar home
on board on of these owen davi work in variou capac for
thirteen long year he did hi drudgeri well but he made no friend
and alwai remain the same shy silent and piou man then suddenli
a relat di without a will and he found himself heirinlaw to
bryngelli castl and all it revenu owen express no surpris and
to all appear felt none he had never seen hi relat and never
dream of thi romant devolut of great estat upon himself
but he accept the good fortun as he had accept the ill and said
noth the onli peopl who knew him were hi shipmat and thei could
scarc be held to know him thei were acquaint with hi appear
and the sound of hi voic and hi method of do hi duti also thei
were awar although he never spoke of religion that he read a chapter
of the bibl everi even and went to church whenev thei touch at
a port but of hi intern self thei were in total ignor thi
did not howev prevent them from prophesi that davi wa a deep
on who now that he had got the cash would blue it in a wai which
would astonish them
but davi did not excel in azur feat the new of hi good
fortun reach him just as the brig on which he wa go to sail as
firstmat wa take in her cargo for the west indi he had sign
hi contract for the voyag and to the utter astonish of the
lawyer who manag the estat he announc that he should carri it
out in vain did the man of affair point out to hi client that with
the help of a chequ of 100 he could arrang the matter for him in
ten minut mr davi mere repli that the properti could wait
he should go the voyag and retir afterward the lawyer held up hi
hand and then suddenli rememb that there ar women in the west
indi as in other part of the world doubtless hi queer client had an
object in thi voyag as a matter of fact he wa total wrong owen
davi had never interchang a tender word with a woman in hi life he
wa a creatur of routin and it wa part of hi routin to carri out
hi agreement to the letter that wa all
as a last resourc the lawyer suggest that mr davi should make a
will
i do not think it necessari wa the slow and measur answer the
properti ha come to me by chanc if i die it mai as well go to
somebodi els in the same wai
the lawyer stare veri well he said it is against my advic but
you must pleas yourself do you want ani monei
owen thought for a moment ye he said i think i should like
to have ten pound thei ar build a theatr there and i want to
subscrib to it
the lawyer gave him the ten pound without a word he wa struck
speechless and in thi condit he remain for some minut after
the door had close behind hi client then he sprung up with a singl
ejacul mad mad like hi great uncl
but owen davi wa not in the least mad at ani rate not then he wa
onli a creatur of habit in due cours hi agreement fulfil he
sail hi brig home from the west indi for the captain wa drown
in a gale then he took a secondclass ticket to bryngelli where he
had never been in hi life befor and ask hi wai to the castl he
wa told to go to the beach and he would see it he did so leav hi
seachest behind him and there about two hundr pace from the land
and built upon a solitari mountain of rock measur half a mile or
so round the base he perceiv a vast mediv pile of fortifi
build with turret tower three hundr feet into the air and
edg with fire by the set sun he gaze on it with perplex
could it be that thi enorm island fortress belong to him and if
so how on earth did on get to it for some littl time he walk
up and down wonder too shy to go to the villag for inform
meanwhil though he did not notic her a wellgrown girl of about
fifteen remark for her great grei ey and the promis of her
beauti wa watch hi evid perplex from a seat beneath a rock
not without amus at last she rose and with the confid of
bold fifteen walk straight up to him
do you want to get the castl sir she ask in a low sweet voic
the echo of which owen davi never forgot
yesoh i beg your pardon for now for the first time he saw that he
wa talk to a young ladi
then i am afraid that you ar too latemr thoma will not show
peopl over after four oclock she is the housekeep you know
ah well the fact is i did not come to see over the place i came to
live there i am owen davi and the place wa left to me
beatric for of cours it wa she stare at him in amaz so thi
wa the mysteri sailor about whom there had been so much talk in
bryngelli
oh she said with embarrass frank what an odd wai to come
home well it is high tide and you will have to take a boat i will
show you where you can get on old edward will row you across for
sixpenc and she led the wai round a corner of the beach to where old
edward sat from earli morn to dewi ev upon the thwart of hi biggest
boat seek those whom he might row
edward said the young ladi here is the new squir mr owen davi
who want to be row across to the castl edward a gnarl and
twist specimen of the sailor tribe with small ey and a face that
remind the observ of on of those quaint counten on the handl
of a walk stick stare at her in astonish and then cast a look
of suspicion on the visitor
have he got paper of identif about him miss he ask in a
stage whisper
i dont know she answer laugh he sai that he is mr owen
davi
well prap he is and prap he aint anywai it isnt my affair and
sixpenc is sixpenc
all of thi the unfortun mr davi overheard and it did not add to
hi equanim
now sir if you pleas said edward sternli as he pull the littl
boat up to the edg of the breakwat a vision of mr thoma shot into
owen mind if the boatman did not believ in him what chanc had he
with the housekeep he wish he had brought the lawyer down with him
and then he wish that he wa back in the sugar brig
now sir said edward still more sternli put down hi hesit
to an impostor conscious of guilt
um said owen to the young ladi i beg your pardon i dont even know
your name and i am sure i have no right to ask it but would you mind
row across with me it would be so kind of you you might introduc
me to the housekeep
again beatric laugh the merri laugh of girlhood she wa too young to
be consciou of ani improprieti in the situat and inde there wa
none but her sens of humour told her that it wa funni and she becam
possess with a not unnatur curios to see the thing out
oh veri well she said i will come
the boat wa push off and veri soon thei reach the stone quai that
border the harbour of the castl about which a littl villag of
retain had grown up see the boat arriv some of these peopl
saunter out of the cottag and then think that a visitor had
come under the guidanc of miss beatric to look at the antiqu
of the castl which wa the show place of the neighbourhood saunter
back again then the pair began the zigzag ascent of the rock mountain
till at last thei stood beneath the mighti mass of build which
although it wa hoari with antiqu wa by no mean lack in the
comfort of modern civil the water for instanc be brought
in pipe laid beneath the sea from a mountain top two mile awai on the
mainland
isnt there a view here said beatric point to the vast stretch
of land and sea i think mr davi that you have the most beauti
hous in the whole world your greatuncl who di a year ago spent
more than fifti thousand pound on repair and refurbish it thei
sai he built the big drawingroom there where the stone is a littl
lighter it is fiftyf feet long just think fifti thousand pound
it is a larg sum said owen in an unimagin sort of wai while
in hi heart he wonder what on earth he should do with thi white
eleph of a mediv castl and it draw room fiftyf feet
long
he doe not seem much impress thought beatric to herself as she
tug awai at the postern bell i think he must be stupid he look
stupid
present the door wa open by an activelook littl old woman with
a high voic
mr thoma thought owen to himself she is even wors than i
expect
now you must pleas to go awai began the formid housekeep in
her shrillest kei it is too late to show visitor over why bless us
it you miss beatric with a strang man what do you want
beatric look at her companion as a hint that he should explain
himself but he said noth
thi is your new squir she said not without a certain pride i
found him wander about the beach he did not know how to get here so
i brought him over
lord miss beatric and how do you know it him said mr thoma
how do you know it aint a housebreak
oh im sure he cannot be answer beatric asid becaus he isnt
clever enough
then follow a long discuss mr thoma stoutli refus to admit
the stranger without evid of ident and beatric embrac hi
caus as stoutli press hi claim as for the law owner he made
occasion feebl attempt to prove that he wa himself but mr thoma
wa not to be impos upon in thi wai at last thei came to a dead
lock
yd better go back to the inn sir said mr thoma with scath
sarcasm and come up tomorrow with proof and your luggag
havent you got ani letter with you suggest beatric as a last
resourc
as it happen owen had a letter on from the lawyer to himself about
the properti and mention mr thomass name as be in charg
of the castl he had forgotten all about it but at thi interest
junctur it wa produc and read aloud by beatric mr thoma took
it and have examin it carefulli through her hornrim spectacl
wa constrain to admit it authent
im sure i apologis sir she said with a halfdoubt courtesi
and much tact but on cant be too care with all these trampses
about i never should have thought from the look of you sir how as you
wa the new squir
thi might be candid but it wa not flatter and it caus beatric
to snigger behind her handkerchief in true schoolgirl fashion howev
thei enter and were led by mr thoma with solemn pomp through
the great and littl hall the stone parlour and the oak parlour the
librari and the huge drawingroom in which the white head of marbl
statu protrud from the bag of brown holland wherewith thei were
wrap about in a manner ghastli to behold at length thei reach a
small octagonshap room that face south command a most gloriou
view of sea and land it wa call the ladi boudoir and join
anoth of about the same size which in it former owner time had
been us as a smokingroom
if you dont mind madam said the lord of all thi magnific i
should like to stop here i am get tire of walk and there he
stop for mani year the rest of the castl wa shut up he scarc
ever visit it except occasion to see that the room were properli
air for he wa a method man
as for beatric she went home still chuckl to receiv a sever
reproof from elizabeth for her forward but owen davi never
forgot the debt of gratitud he ow her in hi heart he felt convinc
that had it not been for her he would have fled befor mr thoma and
her hornrim eyeglass to return no more the truth of the matter
wa howev that young as wa beatric he fell in love with her then
and there onli to fall deeper and deeper into that drear abyss as year
went on he never said anyth about it he scarc even gave a hint
of hi hopeless condit though of cours beatric divin someth
of it as soon as she came to year of discret but there grew up in
owen silent lone breast a great and overmast desir to make
thi greyei girl hi wife he measur time by the interv that
elaps between hi vision of her no period in hi life wa so
wretch and utterli purposeless as those two year which pass while
she wa at her train colleg he wa a veri passiv lover as yet hi
gather passion did not urg him to extrem and he could never make
up hi mind to declar it the box wa in hi hand but he fear to
throw the dice
but he drew as near to her as he dare onc he gave beatric a flower
it wa when she wa seventeen and awkwardli express a hope that she
would wear it for hi sake the word were not much and the flower wa
not much but there wa a look about the man ey and a suppress
passion and energi in hi voic which told their tale to the
keenwit girl after thi he found that she avoid him and bitterli
regret hi bold for beatric did not like him in that wai to
a girl of her curiou stamp hi wealth wa noth she did not covet
wealth she covet independ and had the sens to know that
marriag with such a man would not bring it a cage is a cage whether
the bar ar of iron or gold he bore her she despis him for hi
want of intellig and enterpris that a man with all thi wealth and
endless opportun should wast hi life in such fashion wa to her a
thing intoler she knew if she had half hi chanc that she would
make her name ring from on end of europ to the other in short
beatric held owen as deepli in contempt as her sister elizabeth
studi him from anoth point of view held him in rever and
put asid ani human predilect beatric would never have marri
a man whom she despis she respect herself too much
owen davi saw all thi as through a glass darkli and in hi own slow
wai cast about for a mean of draw near he discov that beatric
wa passion fond of learn and also that she had no mean to
obtain the necessari book so he threw open hi librari to her it
wa on of the best in wale he did more he gave order to a london
booksel to forward him everi new book of import that appear
in certain class of literatur and all of these he place at her
dispos have first carefulli cut the leav with hi own hand thi
wa a bait beatric could not resist she might dread or even detest mr
davi but she love hi book and if she quarrel with him her
well of knowledg would simpli run dry for there were no circul
librari at bryngelli and if there had been she could not have
afford to subscrib to them so she remain on good term with him
and even smile at hi futil attempt to keep pace with her studi
poor man read did not come natur to him he wa much better at
cut leav he studi the time and certain religi work that
wa all but he wrestl manfulli with mani a detest tome in order to
be abl to sai someth to beatric about it and the worst of it wa
that beatric alwai saw through it and show him that she did it wa
not kind perhap but youth is cruel
and so the year wore on till at length beatric knew that a crisi
wa at hand even the tardiest and most retir lover must come to the
point at last if he is in earnest and owen davi wa veri much in
earnest of late to her dismai he had so far come out of hi shell
as to allow himself to be nomin a member of the school council of
cours she knew that thi wa onli to give him more opportun of
see her as a member of the council he could visit the school of
which she wa mistress as often as he chose and inde he soon learn
to take a live interest in villag educ about twice a week he
would come in just as the school wa break up and offer to walk home
with her seek for a favour opportun to propos hitherto she
had alwai ward off thi last event but she knew that it must happen
not that she wa actual afraid of the man himself he wa too much
afraid of her for that what she did fear wa the outburst of wrath
from her father and sister when thei learn that she had refus owen
davi it never occur to her that elizabeth might be plai a hand
of her own in the matter
from all of which it will be clear if inde it ha not becom so
alreadi that beatric granger wa a somewhat illregul young woman
born to bring troubl on herself and all connect with her had she
been otherwis she would have taken her good fortun and marri owen
davi in which case her histori need never have been written
chapter vii

the child obei and went ladi honoria stood and watch her go
tap her littl foot upon the floor and with a look upon her cold
handsom face that wa not altogeth agreeabl to see
it had sometim happen that in the cours of hi marri life
geoffrei return home with a littl of that ad fond which
absenc is fabl to beget on these occas he wa commonli so
unfortun as to find that ladi honoria beli the sai that she
greet him with arrear of grievanc and wa if possibl more frigid
than ever
wa thi to be repeat now that he had come back from what wa so
near to be the longest absenc of all it look like it he note
symptom of the rise storm symptom with which he wa but too well
acquaint and both for hi own sake and for hersfor abov all thing
geoffrei dread these bitter matrimoni bickeringstri to think of
someth kind to sai it must be own that he did not show much tact
in the subject he select though it wa on which might have stir
the sympathi of some women it is so difficult to rememb that on is
deal with a ladi honoria
if ever we have anoth child he began gentli
excus me interrupt you said the ladi with a suaviti which did
not howev convei ani idea of the speaker inward peac but it is
a kind to prevent you from go on in that line on darl is
ampl for me
well said the miser geoffrei with an effort even if you dont
care much about the child yourself it is a littl unreason to
object becaus she care for me and wa sorri when she thought that i
wa dead realli honoria sometim i wonder if you have ani heart at
all why should you be put out becaus effi got up earli to come and
see mean exampl which i must admit you did not set her and as to
her shoe he ad smile
you mai laugh about her shoe geoffrei she interrupt but you
forget that even littl thing like that ar no laugh matter now to
us the child shoe keep me awak at night sometim defoi ha
not been paid for i dont know how long i have a mind to get her
sabotsand as to heart
well broke in geoffrei reflect that bad as wa the emot side
of the question it wa better than the commerciala to heart
you ar scarc the person to talk of it that is all i wonder how
much of your you gave me
realli honoria he answer not without eager and hi mind
fill with wonder wa it possibl that hi wife had experienc some
kind of call and wa about to concern herself with hi heart on
wai or the other if so it wa strang for she had never shown the
slightest interest in it befor
ye she went on rapidli and with gather vehem you speak
about your heartwhich he had not doneand yet you know as well as i
do that if i had been a girl of no posit you would never have offer
me the organ on which you pretend to set so high a valu or did your
heart run wildli awai with you and drag us into love and a cottagea
flat i mean if so i should prefer a littl less heart and a littl
more common sens
geoffrei winc twice inde feel that her ladyship had hit him as
it were with both barrel for as a matter of fact he had not begun
with ani passion devot and again ladi honoria and he were now
just as poor as though thei had realli marri for love
it is hardli fair to go back on bygon and talk like thi he said
even if your posit had someth to do with it onli at first of
cours you must rememb that when we marri mine wa not without
attract two thousand a year to start on and a baronetci and eight
thousand a year in the near futur were notbut i hate talk about
that kind of thing why do you forc me to it nobodi could know that my
uncl who wa so anxiou that i should marri you would marri himself
at hi ag and have a son and heir it wa not my fault honoria
perhap you would not have marri me if you could have foreseen it
veri probabl not she answer calmli and it is not my fault that
i have not yet learn to live with peac of mind and comfort on seven
hundr a year it wa hard enough to exist on two thousand till your
uncl di and now
well and now honoria if you will onli have patienc and put up with
thing for a while you shall be rich enough i will make monei for you
as much monei as you want i have mani friend i have not done so badli
at the bar thi year
two hundr pound nineteen shill and sevenp minu
ninetyseven pound rent of chamber and clerk said ladi honoria with
a disparag accent on the sevenp
i shall doubl it next year and doubl that again the next and so on
i work from morn till night to get on that you mai havewhat you
live for he said bitterli
ah i shall be sixti befor that happi dai come and want noth but
scandal and a bath chair i know the bar and it moan she ad
with acid wit you dream you imagin what you would like to come true
but you ar deceiv me and yourself it will be like the stori of sir
robert bingham properti onc again we shall be beggar all our dai
i tell you geoffrei that you had no right to marri me
then at length he lost hi temper thi wa not the first of these
scenesthei had grown frequent of late and thi bitter water wa
constantli drop
right he said and mai i ask what right you had to marri me when you
dont even pretend you ever care on straw for me but just accept me
as you would have accept ani other man who wa a toler good match
i grant that i first thought of propos to you becaus my uncl wish
it but if i did not love you i meant to be a good husband to you and i
should have love you if you would let me but you ar cold and selfish
you look upon a husband mere as a steppingston to luxuri you have
never love anybodi except yourself if i had di last night i believ
that you would have care more about have to go into mourn than for
the fact of my disappear from your life you show no more
feel for me when you came in than you would have if i had been a
strangernot so much as some women might have for a stranger i wonder
sometim if you have ani feel left in you at all i should think
that you treat me as you do becaus you do not care for me and do care
for some other person did i not know you to be utterli incap of
care for anybodi do you want to make me hate you honoria
geoffrei low concentr voic and earnest manner told hi wife who
wa watch him with someth like a smile upon her clearcut lip
how deepli he wa move he had lost hi selfcontrol and expos hi
heart to hera thing he rare did and that in itself wa a triumph
which she did not wish to pursu at the moment geoffrei wa not a man
to push too far
if you have quit finish geoffrei there is someth i should like
to sai
oh curs it all he broke in
ye she said calmli and interrog and made a paus but as
he did not special appli hi remark to anybodi or anyth she
continu if these flower of rhetor ar over what i have to sai
is thi i do not intend to stai in thi horrid place ani longer i am
go tomorrow to my brother garsington thei ask us both you mai
rememb but for reason best known to yourself you would not go
you know my reason veri well honoria
i beg your pardon i have not the slightest idea what thei were said
ladi honoria with convict mai i hear them
well if you wish to know i will not go to the hous of a man who
haswel left my club as garsington left it and who had it not
been for my effort would have left it in an even more unpleas and
conspicu fashion and hi wife is wors than he is
i think you ar mistaken ladi honoria said coldli and with the air
of a person who shut the door of a room into which she doe not wish to
look and ani wai it all happen year ago and ha blown over but
i do not see the necess of discuss the subject further i suppos
that we shall meet at dinner tonight i shall take the earli train
tomorrow
do what suit you honoria perhap you would prefer not return at
all
thank you no i will not lai myself open to imput i shall join
you in london and will make the best of a bad busi thank heaven
i have learn how to bear my misfortun and with thi parthian shot
she left the room
for a minut or two her husband felt as though he almost hate her then
he thrust hi face into the pillow and groan
she is right he said to himself we must make the best of a bad
busi but somehow i seem to have made a mess of my life and yet i
love her oncefor a month or two
thi wa not an agreeabl scene and it mai be said that ladi honoria
wa a vulgar person but not even the advantag of have been brought
up on the knee of marchio is a specif against vulgar if
a ladi happen unfortun to set her heart what there is of it
meanli on mean thing

place is as full of dissent as a mackerelboat of fish and as for
get the titheswel i cannot that all if it wasnt for a bit
of farm that i do not but what the price ar down to noth and

with her idea and it wa a funni thing her hold you so tight but
i suppos provid arrang that goodby for the present mr
bingham and thi curiou specimen of a clergyman vanish leav
geoffrei quit breathless
it wa halfpast two oclock and the doctor had told him that he could
see miss granger at three he wish that it wa three for he wa tire
of hi own thought and compani and natur anxiou to renew hi
acquaint with the strang girl who had begun by impress him so
deepli and end by save hi life there wa complet quiet in the
hous betti the maidofallwork wa emploi in the kitchen both
the doctor had gone and elizabeth and her father were out todai
there wa no wind it had blown itself awai dure the night and the
sight of the sunbeam stream through the window made geoffrei long
to be in the open air he had no book at hand to read and whenev he
tri to think hi mind flew back to that hate matrimoni quarrel
it wa hard on him geoffrei thought that he should be call upon
to endur such scene he could no longer disguis the truth from
himselfh had buri hi happi on hi weddingdai look
back across the year he well rememb how differ a life he had
imagin for himself in those dai he wa tire of knock about
and of youth escapad even that kind of social success which must
attend a young man who wa handsom clever a good fellow and bless
with larg expect had at the ag of sixandtwenti entir
lost it attract therefor he had turn no deaf ear to hi
uncl sir robert bingham who wa then go on for seventi when he
suggest that it might be well of geoffrei settl down and introduc
him to ladi honoria
ladi honoria wa eighteen then and a beauti of the rather thin but
statuesqu type which attract men up to five or six and twenti and
then frequent bore if it doe not repel them moreov she wa
clever and well read and pretend to be intellectu and poetic
inclin as ladi not special favour by apollo sometim
dobefor thei marri cold she alwai wa nobodi ever heard of ladi
honoria stretch the bound of proprieti but geoffrei put thi down
to a sweet and becom modesti which would vanish or be transmut
in it season also she affect a charm innoc of all vulgar
busi matter which both deceiv and enchant him never but onc
did she allud to wai and mean befor marriag and then it wa to sai
that she wa glad that thei should be so poor till dear sir robert di
he had promis to allow them fifteen hundr a year and thei had
seven more between them as thi would enabl them to see so much more
of each other
at last came the happi dai and thi white virgin soul pass into
geoffrei keep for a week or so thing went fairli well and then
disenchant began he learn by slow but sure degre that hi wife
wa vain selfish and extravag and worst of all that she care
veri littl about him the first shock wa when he accident
discov four or five dai after marriag that honoria wa
intim acquaint with everi detail of sir robert bingham
properti and young as she wa had alreadi form a scheme to make it
more product after the old man death
thei went to live in london and there he found that ladi honoria
although by far too cold and prudent a woman to do anyth that could
bring a breath of scandal upon her name wa as fond of admir as
she wa heartless it seem to geoffrei that he could never be free
from the collect of young men who hung about her skirt some of them
were veri good fellow whom he like exceedingli still on the whole he
would have prefer to remain unmarri and associ with them at the
club also the continu round of societi and go out brought heavier
expens on him that he could well support and thu littl by littl
poor geoffrei dream of matrimoni bliss fade into thin air but
fortun for himself he possess a certain share of logic and
sweet reason in time he learnt to see that the fault wa not
altogeth with hi wife who wa by no mean a bad sort of woman in
her degre but her degre differ from hi degre she had marri for
freedom and wealth and to gain a larger scope wherein to exercis those
tast which inherit disposit and educ had given to her as
she believ that he had marri her becaus she wa the daughter of a
peer
ladi honoria like mani anoth woman of her stamp wa the overbr or
sometim the underbr product of a too civil ag and class those
primit passion and virtu on which her husband had reli to make
the happi of their marri life simpli did not exist for her the
passion had been bred and educ out of her for mani gener
thei have been found inconveni and disquiet attribut in woman
as for the old virtu such as love of children and the ordinari round
of domest duti thei simpli bore her on the whole though sharp of
tongu she rare lost her temper for her vice like her virtu
were of a somewhat neg order but the furi which seiz her when
she learn for certain that she wa to becom a mother wa a thing that
her unfortun husband never forgot and never wish to see again at
length the child wa born a fact for which geoffrei at least wa veri
thank
take it awai i do not want to see it said ladi honoria to the
scandalis nurs when the littl creatur wa brought to her wrap
in it long robe
give it to me nursei do said her husband
from that moment geoffrei gave all the pentup affect of hi bruis
soul to thi littl daughter and as the year went on thei grew veri
dear to each other but an activemind strongheart ablebodi
man cannot take a babe as the sole companion of hi exist probabl
geoffrei would have found thi out in time and might have drift into
some mode of life more or less undesir had not an accid occur
to prevent it in hi dotag geoffrei old uncl sir robert bingham
fell a victim to the wile of an adventuress and marri her then he
promptli di and eight month afterward a posthum son wa born
to geoffrei thi meant ruin hi allow stop and hi expect
vanish at on fell swoop he pull himself togeth howev as
a braveheart man doe under such a shock and go to hi wife he
explain to her that he must now work for hi live beg her to
break down the barrier that wa between them and give him her sympathi
and help she met him with tear and reproach the on thing that
touch her keenli the on thing which she fear and hate wa
poverti and all that poverti mean to women of her rank and natur but
there wa no help for it the charm hous in bolton steet had to be
given up and purgatori must be face in a flat near the edgwar road
ladi honoria wa miser inde had it not been that fortun for
herself she possess plenti of relat more or less grand whom she
might continu visit for week and even for month at a stretch she
could scarc have endur her alter life
but strang enough geoffrei soon found that he wa happier than he had
been sinc hi marriag to begin with he set to work like a man and
work is a great sourc of happi to all vigorousmind folk it is
not in truth a particularli cheer occup to pass endless dai
in hang about lawcourt amongst a crowd of unbrief junior and
mani night in read up the law on ha forgotten and thread the
mani intricaci of the judicatur act but it happen that hi father
a younger brother of sir robert had been a solicitor and though he
wa dead and all direct interest with the firm wa sever yet anoth
uncl remain in it and the partner did not forget geoffrei in hi
difficulti
thei sent him what work thei could without offend their stand
counsel and he did it well then by degre he built up quit a larg
gener practic of the kind known as devil now there ar few thing
more unsatisfactori than do anoth man work for noth but
everi case fought mean knowledg gain and what is more it is
advertis so it came to pass that within less than two year from
the date of hi monei misfortun geoffrei bingham dark handsom face
and squar strong form becam veri well known in the court
what is that man name said on wellknown qc to anoth still
more well known as thei sat wait for their chop in the bar grill
room and saw geoffrei hi wig push back from hi forehead stride
through the doorwai on the last dai of the sit which preced the
commenc of thi histori
bingham answer the other he onli begun to practis late
but hell be at the top of the tree befor he ha done he marri
veri well you know old garsington daughter a charm woman and
handsom too
he look like it grunt the first and as a matter of fact such wa
the gener opinion
for as beatric had said geoffrei bingham wa a man who had success
written on hi forehead it would have been almost imposs for him to
fail in whatev he undertook
chapter ix
what beatric dream
geoffrei lai upon hi back watch the still patch of sunshin and
listen to the tick of the clock as he pass all these and mani
other event in solemn review till the seri culmin in hi vivid
recollect of the scene of that veri morn
i am sick of it he said at last aloud sick and tire she make my
life wretch if it wasnt for effi upon my word id by jove it
is three oclock i will go and see miss granger she a woman not a
femal ghost at ani rate though she is a freethinkerwhich he ad
as he slowli struggl off the couch is a veri foolish thing to be
veri shakili for he wa sadli knock about geoffrei hobbl down the
long narrow room and through the door which wa ajar the opposit door
wa also set half open he knock softli and get no answer push
it wide and look in think that he had perhap made some mistak
as to the room on a sofa place about twothird down it length lai
beatric asleep she wa wrap in a kind of dressinggown of some
simpl blue stuff and all about her breast and shoulder stream her
love curl hair her sweet face wa toward him it pallor reliev
onli by the long shadow of the dark lash and the bent bow of the lip
on white wrist and hand hung down almost to the floor and beneath the
spread curtain of the sunlit hair her bosom heav softli in her sleep
she look so wondrous beauti in her rest that he stop almost
aw and gaze and gaze again feel as though a present sens and
power were still hi heart to silenc it is danger to look upon
such quiet loveli and veri danger to feel that pressur at the
heart a truli wise man feel it would have fled know that seed
sown in such silenc mai live to bloom upon a bitter dai and shed
their fruit into the water of desol but geoffrei wa not
wisewho would have been he still stood and gaze till the sight
stamp itself so deepli on the tablet of hi heart that through all
the year to come no heat of passion no frost of doubt and no sens
of loss could ever dull it memori
the silent sun shone on the silent woman slept and in silenc the
watcher gaze and as he look a great fear a prescienc of evil that
should come enter into geoffrei and took possess of him a cloud
without cross the rai of sunlight and turn it it waver for a
second it rest on hi breast flash back to her then went out and
as it flash and di he seem to know that henceforth for life till
death ay and beyond hi fate and that sleep woman were on
fate it wa but a momentari knowledg the fear shook him and wa gone
almost befor he understood it foolish but it had been with him
and in after dai he rememb it
just then beatric woke open her grei ey their dreami glanc fell
upon him look through him and beyond him rather than at him then
she rais herself a littl and stretch out both her arm toward
him spoke aloud
so have you have come back to me at last she said i knew that you
would come and i have wait
he made no answer he did not know what to sai inde he began to think
that he also must be dream for a littl while beatric still look
at him in the same absent manner then suddenli start up the red
blood stream to her brow
why mr bingham she said is it realli you what wa it that i
said oh prai forgiv me whatev it wa i have been asleep dream
such a curiou dream and talk in my sleep
do not alarm yourself miss granger he answer recov himself
with a jerk you did not sai anyth dread onli that you were glad
to see me what were you dream about
beatric look at him doubtfulli perhap hi word did not ring quit
true
i think that i had better tell you as i have said so much she
answer besid it wa a veri curiou dream and if i believ in
dream it would rather frighten me onli fortun i do not sit down
and i will tell it to you befor i forget it it is not veri long
he took the chair to which she point and she began speak in the
voic of on yet laden with the memori of sleep
i dream that i stood in space far to my right wa a great globe of
light and to my left wa anoth globe and i knew that the globe were
name life and death from the globe on the right to the globe on the
left and back again a golden shuttl in which two flame ey were
set wa shot continu and i knew also that thi wa the shuttl of
destini weav the web of fate present the shuttl flew leav
behind it a long silver thread and the ey in the shuttl were such as
your ey again the shuttl sped through space and thi time it ey
were like my ey and the thread it left behind it wa twist from a
woman hair half wai between the globe of life and death my thread
wa broken but the shuttl flew on and vanish for a moment the
thread hung in air then a wind rose and blew it so that it float
awai like a spider web till it struck upon your silver thread of life
and began to twist round and round it as it twist it grew larger and
heavier till at last it wa thick as a great tress of hair and the
silver line bent beneath the weight so that i saw it soon must break
then while i wonder what would happen a white hand hold a knife
slid slowli down the silver line and with the knife sever the
wrap of woman hair which fell and float slowli awai like a
littl cloud touch with sunlight till thei were lost in dark but
the thread of silver that wa your line of life sprang up quiver and
make a sound like sigh till at last it sigh itself to silenc
then i seem to sleep and when i woke i wa float upon such a
misti sea as we saw last night i had lost all sight of land and i
could not rememb what the star were like nor how i had been taught
to steer nor understand where i must go i call to the sea and ask
it of the star and the sea answer me thu
hope ha rent her raiment and the star ar set
i call again and ask of the land where i should go and the land
did not answer but the sea answer me a second time
child of the mist wander in the mist and in dark seek for
light
then i wept becaus hope had rent her starri garment and in dark i
must seek for light and while i still wept you rose out of the sea
and sat befor me in the boat i had never seen you befor and still
i felt that i had known you alwai you did not speak and i did not
speak but you look into my heart and saw it troubl then i look
into your heart and read what wa written and thi wa written
woman whom i knew befor the past began and whom i shall know when
the futur is end why do you weep
and my heart answer i weep becaus i am lost upon the water of
the earth becaus hope ha rent her starri robe and in everlast
dark i must seek for light that is not then your heart said i
will show you light and bend forward you touch me on the breast
and suddenli an agoni shook me like the agoni of birth and death
and the sky wa full of greatwing angel who roll up the mist as
a cloth and drew the veil from the ey of night and there her feet
upon the globe and her starset head pierc the firmament of heaven
stood hope breath peac and beauti she look north and south and
east and west then she look upward through the arch vault of
heaven and wherev she set her ey bright with holi tear the
dark shrivel and sorrow ceas and from corrupt aros the
incorrupt i gaze and worship and as i did so again the sea
spoke unquest
in dark thou hast found light in death seek for wisdom
then onc more hope rent her starri robe and the angel drew down a
veil over the ey of night and the sea swallow me and i sank till i
reach the deep foundat of mortal death and there in the hall of
death i sat for ag upon ag till at last i saw you come and on your
lip wa the word of wisdom that make all thing clear but what it wa
i cannot rememb then i stretch out my hand to greet you and woke
and that is all my dream
beatric ceas her grei ey set wide as though thei still strove to
trace their spiritu vision upon the air of earth her breast heav
and her lip apart
great heaven he said what an imagin you must have to dream
such a dream as that
imagin she answer return to her natur manner i have
none mr bingham i us to have but i lost it when i losteveryth
els can you interpret my dream of cours you cannot it is noth
but nonsensesuch stuff as dream ar made of that is all
it mai be nonsens i daresai it is but it is beauti nonsens he
answer i wish ladi had more of such stuff to give the world
ah well dream mai be wiser than wake and nonsens than learn
talk for all we know but there an end of it i do not know why i
repeat it to you i am sorri that i did repeat it but it seem so
real it shook me out of myself thi is what come of break in upon
the routin of life by be three part drown on find queer thing
at the bottom of the sea you know by the wai i hope that you ar
recov i do not think that you will care to go cano again with
me mr bingham
there wa an open for a compliment here but geoffrei felt that it
would be too much in earnest if spoken so he resist the temptat
what miss granger he said should a man sai to a ladi who but last
night save hi life at the risk inde almost at the cost of her
own
it wa noth she answer colour i clung to you that wa
all more by instinct than from ani motiv i think i had a vagu idea
that you might float and support me
miss granger the occas is too seriou for polit fib i know how
you save my life i do not know how to thank you for it
then dont thank me at all mr bingham why should you thank me i
onli did what i wa bound to do i would far rather die than desert a
companion in distress of ani sort we all must die but it would be
dread to die asham you know what thei sai that if you save a
person from drown you will do them an injuri afterward that is how
thei put it here in some part the sai is the other wai about but i
am not like ever to do you an injuri so it doe not make me unhappi
it wa an aw experi you were senseless so you cannot know how
strang it felt ly upon the slipperi rock and see those great
white wave rush upon us through the gloom with noth but the night
abov and the sea around and death between the two i have been lone
for mani year but i do not think that i ever quit understood what
loneli realli meant befor you see she ad by wai of an
afterthought i thought that you were dead and there is not much
compani in a corps
well he said on thing is it would have been loneli if we had
gone
do you think so she answer look at him inquiringli i dont
quit see how you make that out if you believ in what we have been

of me to speak like thi i have more advantag than ninetenth of
the world and i ought to make the best of them i dont know why i have
been speak as i have and to you whom i never saw till yesterdai
i never did it befor to ani live soul i assur you it is just like
the stori of the man who came here last year with the divin rod
there is a cottag down on the cliffit belong to mr davi who
live in the castl well thei have no drink water near and the new
tenant made a great fuss about it so mr davi hire men and thei dug
and dug and spent no end of monei but could not come to water at last
the tenant fetch an old man from some parish a long wai off who said
that he could find spring with a divin rod he wa a curiou old man
with a crutch and he came with hi rod and hobbl about till at last
the rod twitch just at the tenant back doorat least the divin
said it did at ani rate thei dug there and in ten minut struck a
spring of water which bubbl up so strongli that it rush into the
hous and flood it and what do you think after all the water wa
brackish you ar the man with the divin rod mr bingham and you
have made me talk a great deal too much and after all you see it is
not nice talk you must think me a veri disagre and wick young
woman and i daresai i am but somehow it is a relief to open on
mind i do hope mr bingham that you will seein short that you will
not misunderstand me
miss granger he answer there is between us that which will alwai
entitl us to mutual respect and confidenceth link of life and
death had it not been for you i should not sit here to listen to your
confid todai you mai tell me that a mere natur impuls prompt
you to do what you did i know better it wa your will that triumph
over your natur impuls toward selfpreserv well i will sai no
more about it except thi if ever a man wa bound to a woman by ti
of gratitud and respect i am bound to you you need not fear that i
shall take advantag of or misinterpret your confid here he rose
and stood befor her hi dark handsom face bow in proud humil
miss granger i look upon it as an honour done to me by on whom
henceforth i must rever among all women the life you gave back to
me and the intellig which direct it ar in duti bound to you and
i shall not forget the debt
beatric listen to hi word spoken in that deep and earnest voic
which in after year becam so familiar to her majesti judg and to
parliamentlisten with a new sens of pleasur rise in her heart
she wa thi man equal what he could dare she could dare where he
could climb she could followai and if need be show the path and
she felt that he acknowledg it in hi sight she wa someth more
than a handsom girl to be admir and defer to for her beauti
sake he had place her on anoth levelon perhap that few women
would have wish to occupi but beatric wa thank to him it wa
the first tast of supremaci that she had ever known
it is someth to stir the proud heart of such a woman as beatric
in that moment when for the first time she feel herself a conqueror
victori not through the vulgar advantag of her sex not by the
submiss of man coarser sens but rather by the overbalanc
weight of mind
do you know she said suddenli look up you make me veri proud
and she stretch out her hand to him
he took it and bend touch it with hi lip there wa no
possibl of misinterpret the action and though she colour
a littlefor till then no man had even kiss the tip of her
fingersh did not misinterpret it it wa an act of homag and that
wa all
and so thei seal the compact of their perfect friendship for ever and
a dai
then came a moment silenc it wa geoffrei who broke it
miss granger he said will you allow me to preach you a lectur a
veri short on
go on she said
veri well do not blame me if you dont like it and do not set me down
as a prig though i am go to tell you your fault as i read them in
your own word you ar proud and ambiti and the cramp line in
which you ar forc to live seem to strangl you you have suffer
and have not learn the lesson of sufferinghumil you have set
yourself up against fate and fate sweep you along like sprai upon
the gale yet you go unwil in your impati you have flown to
learn for refug and it ha complet your overthrow for it ha
induc you to reject as nonexist all that you cannot understand
becaus your finit mind cannot search infin becaus no answer ha
come to all your prayer becaus you see miseri and cannot read it
purpos becaus you suffer and have not found rest you have said there
is naught but chanc and becom an atheist as mani have done befor
you is it not true
go on she answer bow her head to her breast so that the long
rippl hair almost hid her face
it seem a littl odd geoffrei said with a short laugh that i
with all my imperfect heap upon me should presum to preach to
youbut you will know best how near or how far i am from the truth so
i want to sai someth i have live for thirtyf year and seen a
good deal and tri to learn from it and i know thi in the long run
unless we of our own act put awai the opportun the world give us
our due which gener is not much so much for thing tempor
if you ar fit to rule in time you will rule if you do not then
be content and acknowledg your own incapac and as for thing
spiritu i am sure of thisthough of cours on doe not like to talk
much of these mattersif you onli seek for them long enough in some
shape you will find them though the shape mai not be that which is
gener recognis by ani particular religion but to build a wall
deliber between oneself and the unseen and then complain that the
wai is bar is simpli childish
and what if on wall is built mr bingham
most of us have done someth in that line at differ time he
answer and found a wai round it
and if it stretch from horizon to horizon and is higher than the
cloud what then
then you must find wing and fly over it
and where can ani earthli woman find those spiritu wing she
ask and then sank her head still deeper on her breast to cover her
confus for she rememb that she had heard of wander in the
duski grove of human passion ye even mnad wander who had
suddenli come face to face with their own soul and that the cruel path
of earthli love mai yet lead the feet which tread them to the ivori
gate of heaven
and rememb these beauti myth though she had no experi of
love and knew littl of it wai beatric grew suddenli silent nor
did geoffrei give her an answer though he need scarc have fear to
do so
for were thei not discuss a pure abstract question
chapter x
ladi honoria make arrang
in anoth moment somebodi enter the room it wa elizabeth she had
return from her tith collect expeditionwith the tith the door
of the sittingroom wa still ajar and geoffrei had hi back toward
it so it happen that nobodi heard elizabeth rather catlik step
and for some second she stood in the doorwai without be perceiv
she stood quit still take in the whole scene at a glanc she
notic that her sister held her head down so that her hair shadow
her and guess that she did so for some reasonprob becaus she
did not wish her face to be seen or wa it to show off her love hair
she notic also the half shy half amus and altogeth interest
express upon geoffrei countenancesh could see that in the littl
giltedg lookingglass which hung over the fireplac nor did she
overlook the gener air of embarrass that pervad them both
when she came in elizabeth had been think of owen davi and of
what might have happen had she never seen the tide of life flow back
into her sister vein she had dream of it all night and had thought
of it all dai even in the excit of extract the back tith from
the recalcitr and rather coarsemind welsh farmer with strong
view on the subject of tith it had not been entir forgotten the
farmer wa a tenant of owen davi and when he call her a parson in
petticoat and wu and went on in delic refer to her power
of extract cash to liken her to a twoleg corkscrew onli
screwier she perhap not unnatur reflect that if everpac
beatricecertain thing should come about she would rememb that
farmer for elizabeth wa bless with a veri long memori as some
peopl had learnt to their cost and gener sooner or later she
paid her debt in full not forget the overdu interest
and now as she stood in the doorwai unseen and note these matter
someth occur to her in connect with thi domin idea
which like idea in gener had mani side issu at ani rate a look
of quick intellig shone for a moment in her light ey like a
sickli sunbeam on a faint decemb mist then she move forward and
when she wa close behind geoffrei spoke suddenli
what ar you both think about she said in her clear thin voic
you seem to have exhaust your convers
geoffrei made an exclam and fairli jump from hi chair a feat
which in hi bruis condit realli hurt him veri much beatric too
start violent she recov herself almost instantli howev
how quietli you move elizabeth she said
not more quietli than you sit beatric i have been wonder when
anybodi wa go to sai anyth or if you were both asleep
for her part beatric specul how long her sister had been in the
room their convers had been innoc enough but it wa not on
that she would wish elizabeth to have overheard and somehow elizabeth
had a knack of overhear thing
you see miss granger said geoffrei come to the rescu both our
brain ar still rather waterlog and that doe not tend to a flow of
idea
quit so said elizabeth my dear beatric why dont you tie up your
hair you look like a crazi jane not but what you have veri nice hair
she ad critic do you admir good hair mr bingham
of cours i do he answer gallantli but it is not common
onli beatric bit her lip with vexat i had almost forgotten about
my hair she said i must apologis for appear in such a state i
would have done it up after dinner onli i wa too stiff and while i wa
wait for betti i went to sleep
i think there is a bit of ribbon in that drawer i saw you put it there
yesterdai answer the precis elizabeth ye here it is if you
like and mr bingham will excus it i can tie it back for you and
without wait for an answer she pass behind beatric and gather
up the dens mass of her sister lock ti them round in such
fashion that thei could not fall forward though thei still roll down
her back
just then mr granger came back from hi visit to the farm he wa in
high good humour the pig had even surpass her former effort and
increas in a surpris manner to the number of fifteen inde
elizabeth thereon produc the two pound odd shill which she had
corkscrew out of the recalcitr dissent farmer and the sight
ad to mr granger satisfact
would you believ it mr bingham he said in thi miser paid
parish i have nearli a hundr pound ow to me a hundr pound in
tith there is old jone who live out toward the bell rock he ow
three year tithethirtyfour pound eleven and fourpenc he can pai
and he wont paysai he a baptist and is not go to pai parson
duesthough for the matter of that he is noth but an old beer tub of
a heathen
why dont you proce against him then mr granger
proce i have proceed iv got judgment and i mean to issu
execut in a few dai i wont stand it ani longer he went on
work himself up and shake hi head as he spoke till hi thin white
hair fell about hi ey i will have the law of him and the other
too you ar a lawyer and you can help me i tell you there a spirit
abroad which just come to justno man isnt to pai hi law debt
except of cours the parson and the squir thei must pai or go to the
court but there is law left and ill have it befor thei plai the
irish game on us here and he brought down hi fist with a bang upon
the tabl
geoffrei listen with some amus so thi wa the weak old man
sore pointmonei he wa clearli veri strong about thata strong as
ladi honoria inde but with more excus elizabeth also listen with
evid approv but beatric look pain
dont get angri father she said perhap he will pai after all
it is bad to take the law if you can manag ani other wayit breed so
much ill blood
nonsens beatric said her sister sharpli father is quit right
there onli on wai to deal with them and that is to seiz their
good i believ you ar socialist about properti as you ar about
everyth els you want to pull everyth down from the queen to the
law of marriag all for the good of human and i tell you that
your idea will be your ruin defi custom and it will crush you you ar
run your head against a brick wall and on dai you will find which
is the harder
beatric flush but answer her sister attack which wa all the
sharper becaus it had a certain spice of truth in it
i never express ani such view elizabeth so i do not see why you
should attribut them to me i onli said that legal proceed breed
bad blood in a parish and that is true
i did not sai you express them went on the vigor elizabeth
you look themthei ooz out of your word like water from a peat bog
everybodi know you ar a radic and a freethink and everyth els
that is bad and mad and contrari to that state of life in which it ha
pleas god to call you the end of it will be that you will lose the
mistresship of the schooland i think it is veri hard on father and me
that you should bring disgrac on us with your strang wai and immor
view and now you can make what you like of it
i wish that all radic were like miss beatric said geoffrei who
wa feel exceedingli uncomfort with a feebl attempt at polit
jocos but nobodi seem to hear him elizabeth who wa now fairli
in a rage a faint flush upon her pale cheek her light ey all
ashin and her thin finger clasp stood front her beauti
sister and breath spite at everi pore but it wa easi for geoffrei
who wa watch her to see that it wa not her sister view she wa
attack it wa her sister it wa that soft strong loveli and the
glori of that face it wa the deep gentl mind er from it veri
great and the bright intellect which lit it like a lamp it wa the
learn and the power that give them plai would set a world aflam
as easili as thei did the heart of the slowwit hermit squir whom
elizabeth covetedthes were the thing that elizabeth hate and
bitterli assail
accustom to observ geoffrei saw thi instantli and then glanc
at the father the old man wa frighten clearli he wa afraid of
elizabeth and dread a scene he stood fidget hi feet about and
try to find someth to sai as he glanc apprehens at hi
elder daughter through hi thin hang hair
lastli geoffrei look at beatric who wa inde well worth look
at her face wa quit pale and the clear grei ey shone out beneath
their dark lash she had risen draw herself to her full height
which her exquisit proport seem to increas and wa look at
her sister present she said on word and on onli but it wa enough
elizabeth
her sister open her lip to speak again but hesit and chang
her mind there wa someth in beatric manner that check her
well she said at length you should not irrit me so beatric
beatric made no repli she onli turn toward geoffrei and with a
grace littl bow said
mr bingham i am sure that you will forgiv thi scene the fact is
we all slept badli last night and it ha not improv our temper
there wa a paus of which mr granger took a hurri and rather
undignifi advantag
um ah he said by the wai beatric what wa it i want to sai
ah i knowhav you written i mean written out that sermon for next
sundai my daughter he ad address geoffrei in explanationum
copi my sermon for me she write a veri good hand
rememb beatric confid as to her sermon manufactur
function geoffrei felt amus at her father nave wai of
describ them and beatric also smile faintli as she answer that
the sermon wa readi just then the roll of wheel wa heard without
and the onli fly that bryngelli could boast pull up in front of the
door
here is the fly come for you mr bingham said mr grangerand as
i live her ladyship with it elizabeth see if there isnt some tea
readi and the old gentleman who had all the tradit love of the
lower middleclass englishman for a titl trot off to welcom her
ladyship
present ladi honoria enter the room a sweet if rather a set smile
upon her handsom face and with a grace mien that becam her tall
figur exceedingli well for to do ladi honoria justic she wa on
of the most ladylik women in the countri and so far as her person
appear went a veri perfect type of the class to which she belong
geoffrei look at her sai to himself that she had clearli recov
her temper and that he wa thank for it thi wa not wonder for
it is observ that the more aristocrat a ladi manner ar the
more disagre she is apt to be when she is cross
well geoffrei dear she said you see i have come to fetch you i
wa determin that you should not get yourself drown a second time on
your wai home how ar you nowbut i need not ask you look quit well
again
it is veri kind of you honoria said her husband simpli but it
wa doubt if she heard him for at the moment she wa engag in
search out the soul of beatric with on of the most penetr
and comprehens glanc that young ladi had ever enjoi the honour of
receiv there wa noth rude about the look it wa too quick but
beatric felt that quick as it might be it embrac her altogeth nor
wa she wrong
there is no doubt about it ladi honoria thought to herself she is
lovelylov everywher it wa clever of her to leav her hair down
it show the shape of her head so well and she is tall enough to stand
it that blue wrapper suit her too veri few women could show such a
figur as herslik a greek statu i dont like her she is differ
from most of us just the sort of girl men go wild about and women
hate
all thi pass through her mind in a flash for a moment ladi honoria
blue ey met beatric grei on and she knew that beatric like her
no better than she did beatric those ey were a trifl too honest
and like the deep clear water thei resembl apt to throw up shadow
of the pass thought abov
fals and cold and heartless thought beatric i wonder how a man
like that could marri her and how much he love her
thu the two women took each other measur at a glanc each find
the other want by her standard nor did thei ever chang that hastili
form judgment
it wa all done in a few secondsin that hesit moment befor the
word we summon answer on our lip the next ladi honoria wa sweep
toward her with outstretch hand and her most graciou smile
miss granger she said i ow you a debt i never can repaymi dear

ha it salt you know or in other word on mai alwai be upset
at that moment betti the awkward welsh serv lass with a forearm
about as shape as the hind leg of an eleph and a most unpleas
habit of snort audibl as she move shuffl in with the teatrai
in her wake came the slim elizabeth to whom ladi honoria wa
introduc
after thi convers flag for a while till ladi honoria feel
that thing were get a littl dull set the ball roll again
what a pretti view you have of the sea from these window she said in
her welltrain and monoton modul voic i am so glad to have
seen it for you know i am go awai tomorrow
beatric look up quickli
my husband is not go she went on as though in answer to an
unspoken question i am plai the part of the unduti wife and
run awai from him for exactli three week it is veri wick of

tiresom
geoffrei sip hi tea smile grimli behind the shelter of hi cup
she doe it uncommonli well he thought to himself
doe your littl girl go with you ladi honoria ask elizabeth
well no i think not i cant bear part with heryou know how hard
it is when on ha onli on child but i think she would be so bore
where i am go to stai for there ar no other children there and
besid she posit ador the sea so i shall have to leav her to
her father tender merci poor dear

i suppos that your husband is go to stai on at mr joness said
the clergyman
realli i dont know what ar you go to do geoffrei mr
joness room ar rather expens for peopl in our impoverish
condit besid i am sure that she cannot look after effi just
think she ha eight children of her own poor old dear and i must take
ann with me she is effi french nurs you know a perfect treasur
i am go to stai in a big hous and my experi of those big hous
is that on never get wait on at all unless on take a maid you

know how you will get on with the child geoffrei she take such a lot
of look after
oh dont troubl about that honoria he answer i daresai that
effi and i will manag somehow
here on of those peculiar gleam of intellig which mark the
advent of a new idea pass across elizabeth face she wa sit
next her father and bend whisper to him beatric saw it and made
a motion as though to interpos but befor she could do so mr granger
spoke
look here mr bingham he said if you want to move would you like
a room here term strictli moder but cant afford to put you up for
noth you know and live rough and readi youd have to take us as
you find us but there is a dressingroom next to my room where your
littl girl could sleep and my daughter would look after her between
them and be glad of the job
again beatric open her lip as though to speak but close them
without speak thu do our opportun pass befor we realis that
thei ar at hand
instinct geoffrei had glanc toward beatric he did not know if
thi idea wa agreeabl to her he knew that her work wa hard and
he did not wish to put extra troubl upon her for he guess that the
burden of look after effi would ultim fall upon her shoulder
but her face told him noth it wa quit passiv and appar
indiffer
you ar veri kind mr granger he said hesit i dont want to
go awai from bryngelli just at present and it would be a good plan in
some wai that is if the troubl to your daughter would not be too
much
i am sure that it is an excel plan broke in ladi honoria who
fear lest difficulti should aris as to her appropri of ann
servic how lucki that i happen to mention it there will be no
troubl about our give up the room at mr joness becaus i know
she ha anoth applic for them
veri well said geoffrei not like to rais object to a scheme
thu publicli advoc although he would have prefer to take time
to consid someth warn him that bryngelli vicarag would prove a
fate abod for him then elizabeth rose and ask ladi honoria if she
would like to see the room her husband and effi would occupi
she said she should be delight and went off follow by mr granger
fuss in the rear
dont you think that you will be a littl dull here mr bingham said
beatric
on the contrari he answer why should i be dull i cannot be so
dull as i should be by myself
beatric hesit and then spoke again we ar a curiou famili mr
bingham you mai have seen as much thi afternoon had you not better
think it over
if you mean that you do not want me to come i wont he said rather
bluntli and next second felt that he had made a mistak
i beatric answer open her ey i have no wish in the
matter the fact is that we ar poor and let lodgingsthat is what it
come to if you think thei will suit you you ar quit right to take
them
geoffrei colour he wa a man who could not bear to lai himself open
to the smallest rebuff from a woman and he had brought thi on himself
beatric saw it and relent
of cours mr bingham so far as i am concern i shall be the
gainer if you do come i do not meet so mani peopl with whom i care
to associ and from whom i can learn that i wish to throw a chanc
awai
i think you misunderstand me a littl he said i onli meant that
perhap you would not wish to be bother with effi miss granger
she laugh why i love children it will be a great pleasur to me to
look after her so far as i have time
just then the other return and their convers came to an end
it quit delight geoffreysuch funni oldfashion room i
realli envi you if there wa on thing in the world that ladi honoria
hate it wa an oldfashion room well and now we must be go

sure mr granger will give you hi arm
mr granger ambl forward and geoffrei have made hi adieu and
borrow a cleric hat mr granger concess to custom for in most
other respect he dress like an ordinari farmer wa safe convei
to the fly
and so end geoffrei first dai at bryngelli vicarag
chapter xi
beatric make an appoint
ladi honoria lean back in the cab and sigh a sigh of satisfact
that is a capit idea she said i wa wonder what arrang
you could make for the next three week it is ridicul to pai three
guinea a week for room just for you and effi the old gentleman onli
want that for board and lodg togeth for i ask him
i daresai it will do said geoffrei when ar we to shift
tomorrow in time for dinner or rather supper these barbarian eat
supper you know i go by the morn train you see so as to reach
garsington by teatim i daresai you will find it rather dull but you
like be dull the old clergyman is a low stamp of man and a bore
and as for the eldest daughter elizabeth she too awfulsh remind
me of a rat but beatric is handsom enough though i think her horrid
too youll have to consol yourself with her and i daresai you will
suit each other
why do you think her horrid honoria
oh i dont know she is clever and odd and i hate odd women why
cant thei be like other peopl think of her be strong enough
to save your life like that too she must have the muscl of an
amazonit downright unwomanli but there is no doubt about her
beauti she is as nearli perfect as ani girl i ever saw though too
independ look if onli on had a daughter like that how on might
marri her i would not look at anyth under twenti thousand a year
she is too good for that lumber welsh squir she engag tooth
man who live in the castlethough thei sai that he is fairli rich
engag said geoffrei how do you know that she is engag
oh i dont know it at all but i suppos she is if she isnt she
soon will be for a girl in that posit is not like to throw such
a chanc awai at ani rate he head over ear in love with her i saw
that last night he wa hang about for hour in the rain outsid
the door with a face like a ghost till he knew whether she wa dead or
aliv and he ha been there twice to inquir thi morn mr granger
told me but she is too good for him from a busi point of view she
might marri anybodi if onli she were put in the wai of it
somehow geoffrei live interest in beatric sensibl declin on the
receipt of thi intellig of cours it wa noth to him inde
he wa glad to hear that she wa in the wai of such a comfort
settlement but it is unfortun a fact that on cannot be quit as
much interest in a young and love ladi who is the potenti properti
of a lumber welsh squir as in on who belong to herself
the old adam still surviv in most men howev rightthink thei mai
be and thi is on of it method of selfassert
well he said i am glad to hear she is in such a good wai she
deserv it i think the welsh squir is in luck miss granger is a
remark woman
too remark by half said ladi honoria drili here we ar and
there is effi skip about like a wild thing as usual i think that
child is dement
on the follow morningit wa fridayladi honoria accompani by

at ani rate she would be free from the gall associ of
straighten meansfre to enjoi the luxuri and refin comfort to

everybodi ha hi or her ideal heaven if onli on could fathom it some
would choos a sublim intellectu leisur made happi by the best

she embrac effi with enthusiasm and her husband with a chasten

thing into the portmanteau and effi jump on them those which would
not go in thei bundl loos into the fly till that vehicl look like
an old cloth ship then as there wa no room left for them insid
thei walk down to the vicarag by the beach a distanc of about
threequart of a mile stop on their wai to admir the beauti
castl in on corner of which owen davi live and move

convers drop
present thei came to a boatsh place opposit the villag and
close to highwat mark here a man it wa old edward wa engag
in mend a cano geoffrei glanc at it and saw that it wa the
ident cano out of which he had so nearli been drown
look effi said he that is the boat out of which i wa upset
effi open her wide ey and stare at the frail craft
it is a horrid boat she said i dont want to look at it
your quit right littl miss said old edward touch hi cap
it aint safe and somebodi will be drown out of it on of these
dai i wish it had gone to the bottom i do but miss beatric she is
that foolhardi there aint no do noth with her
i fanci that she ha learnt a lesson said geoffrei
mai be mai be grumbl the old man but women folk ar hard to
teach thei never learn noth till it too late thei dont and
then when theyv been and done it theyr sorri but what the good o
that
meanwhil anoth convers wa in progress not more than a quarter
of a mile awai on the brow of the cliff stood the villag of bryngelli
and at the back of the villag wa a school a plain whitewash
build roof with stone which though ampli suffici and suitabl
to the want of the place wa littl short of an abomin in the
ey of her majesti school inspector who from time to time descend
upon bryngelli for purpos of examin and faultfind thei
yearn to see a state redbrick edific with all the latest
improv erect at the expens of the ratepay but as yet thei
yearn in vain the school wa support by voluntari contribut
and thank to beatric energi and good teach the dread board
with it fad and extravag had not yet clutch it
beatric had return to her duti that afternoon for a night rest
brought back it vigour to her strong young frame she had been greet
with enthusiasm by the children who love her as well thei might for
she wa veri gentl and sweet with them though few dare to disobei
her besid her beauti impress them though thei did not know it
beauti of a certain sort ha perhap more effect on children than on ani
other class heedless and selfish as thei often seem to be thei feel
it power it is an outward express of the thought and dream that
bud in their unknow heart and is somehow mix up with their idea
of god and heaven thu there wa in bryngelli a littl girl of ten a
veri clever and highli excit child jane llewellyn by name born of
parent of strict calvinist view as it chanc some month
befor the open of thi stori a tub thumper of high renown and
consider rude orator forc visit the place and treat hi
hearer to a live discours on the horror of hell
in the veri front row her ey wide with fear sat thi poor littl
child between her parent who listen to the minist with much
satisfact and a littl wai back sat beatric who had come out of
curios
present the preacher have dealt suffici in terrifi
gener went on to practic illustr for after the manner
of hi class he wa deliv an extemporari orat look at that
child he said point to the littl girl she look innoc doe
she not but if she doe not find salvat my brethren i tell you
that she is damn if she di tonight not have found salvat
she will go to hell her delic littl bodi will be torment for
ever and ever
here the unfortun child fell forward with a shriek
you ought to be asham of yourself sir said beatric aloud
she had been listen to all thi illjudg rant with grow
indign and now in her excit entir forgot that she wa in
a place of worship then she ran forward to the child who had swoon
poor littl unfortun she never recov the shock when she came to
herself it wa found that her fine strung mind had given wai and she
laps into a condit of imbecil but her imbecil wa not alwai
passiv occasion fit of passion terror would seiz upon her
she would cry out that the fiend were come to drag her down to
torment and dash herself against the wall in fear hideou to behold
then it wa found that there wa but on wai to calm her it wa to send
for beatric beatric would come and take the poor thin hand in her
and gaze with her calm deep ey upon the wast horrorstricken face
till the child grew quiet again and shiver sob herself to sleep
upon her breast
and so it wa with all the children her power over them wa almost
absolut thei love her and she love them all
and now the school wa almost done for the dai it wa beatric
custom to make the children sing some simpl song befor thei broke
up she stood in front of them and gave the time while thei sung and a
pretti sight it wa to see her do it on thi particular afternoon just
as the first vers wa finish the door of the room open and owen
davi enter bear some book under hi arm beatric glanc round
and saw him then with a quick stamp of her foot went on give the
time
the children sung lustili and in front of them stood beatric dress
in simpl white her grace form swai as she mark the music
time nearer and nearer drew owen davi till at length he stood quit
close hi lip slightli apart hi ey fix upon her like the ey
of on who dream and hi slow heavi face faintli lit with the glow of
strong emot
the song end the children at a word from their mistress file past
her head by the pupil teacher and then with a shout seiz their
cap ran forth thi wai and that welcom the free air when thei
were all gone and not till then beatric turn suddenli round
how do you do mr davi she said
he start visibl i did not know that you had seen me he answer
oh ye i saw you mr davi onli i could not stop the song to sai
how do you do by the wai i have to thank you for come to inquir
after me
not at all miss beatric not at all it wa a most dread accid
i cannot tell you how thank i ami cant inde
it is veri good of you to take so much interest in me said beatric
not at all miss beatric not at all whowho could help take
interest in you i have brought you some booksth life of darwinit
is in two volum i think that i have heard you sai that darwin
interest you
ye thank you veri much have you read it
no but i have cut it darwin doesnt interest me you know i think
that he wa a rather misguid person mai i carri the book home for
you
thank you but i am not go straight home i am go to old edward
shed to see my cano
as a matter of fact thi wa true but the idea wa onli that moment
born in her mind beatric had been go home as she want to see
that all thing were duli prepar for geoffrei and hi littl daughter
but to reach the vicarag she must pass along the cliff where there
were few peopl and thi she did not wish to do to be frank she
fear lest mr davi should take the opportun to make that offer of
hi hand and heart which hung over her like a nightmar now the wai to
edward shed lai through the villag and down the cliff and she knew
that he would never propos in the villag
it wa veri foolish of her no doubt thu to seek to postpon the evil
dai but the strongestmind women have their weak point and thi wa
on of beatric she hate the idea of thi scene she knew that when
it did come there would be a scene not that her resolut to refus
the man had ever falter but it would be pain and in the end it
must reach the ear of her father and elizabeth that she had actual
reject mr owen davi and then what would her life be worth she had
never suspect it it had never enter into her mind to suspect that
though her father might be vex enough noth on thi earth would
more delight the heart of elizabeth
present have fetch her hat beatric accompani by her admir
bear the life of darwin under hi arm start to walk down to the
beach thei went in silenc beatric just a littl ahead she ventur
some remark about the weather but owen davi made no repli he wa
think he want to sai someth but he did not know how to sai
it thei were at the head of the cliff now and if he wish to speak he
must do so quickli
miss beatric he said in a somewhat constrain voic
ye mr daviesoh look at that seagul it nearli knock my hat
off
but he wa not to be put off with the seagul miss beatric he said
again ar you go out walk next sundai afternoon
how can i tell mr davi it mai rain
but if it doe not rainpleas tell me you gener do walk on the
beach on sundai miss beatric i want to speak to you i hope you will
allow me i do inde
then suddenli she came to a decis thi kind of thing wa
unendur it would be better to get it over turn round so
suddenli that owen start she said
if you wish to speak to me mr davi i shall be in the amphitheatr
opposit the red rock at four oclock on sundai afternoon but i had
much rather that you did not come i can sai no more
i shall come he answer doggedli and thei went down the step to
the boatsh
oh look daddi said effi here come the ladi who wa drownd
with you and a gentleman and to beatric great relief the child ran
forward and met them
ah thought geoffrei to himself that is the man honoria said she wa
engag to well i dont think veri much of her tast
in anoth minut thei had arriv geoffrei shook hand with beatric
and wa introduc to owen davi who murmur someth in repli and
promptli took hi departur
thei examin the cano togeth and then walk slowli up to the
vicarag beatric hold effi by the hand opposit the reef thei
halt for a minut
there is the tabl rock on which we were thrown mr bingham said
beatric and here is where thei carri us ashor the sea doe not
look as though it would drown ani on tonight doe it seeand she
threw a stone into itth rippl run as evenli as thei do on a pond
she spoke idli and geoffrei answer her idli for thei were not
think of their word rather were thei think of the strang chanc
that had brought them togeth in an hour of deadli peril and now left
them togeth in an hour of peac perhap too thei were wonder to
what end thi had come about for agnost atheist or believ ar
we not most of us fatalist at heart
chapter xii
the write on the sand
geoffrei found himself veri comfort at the vicarag and as for
effi she posit revel in it beatric look after her
take her to bed at night and help her to dress in the morn and
beatric wa a great improv upon ann when geoffrei becam awar
of thi he remonstr sai that he had never expect her to act as
nurs to the child but she repli that it wa a pleasur to her to do
so which wa the truth in other wai too the place wa all that he
desir he did not like elizabeth but then he did not see veri much
of her and the old farmer clergyman wa amus in hi wai with hi
endless talk of tith and crop and the iniqu of the rebelli
jone on whom he wa go to distrain
for the first dai or two geoffrei had no more convers with
beatric most of the time she wa awai at the school and on the
saturdai afternoon when she wa free he went out to the red rock
curlew shoot at first he thought of ask her to come too but then
it occur to him that she might wish to go out with mr davi to
whom he still suppos she wa engag it wa no affair of hi yet he
wa glad when he came back to find that she had been out with effi and
not with mr davi
on sundai morn thei all went to church includ beatric it wa
a bare littl church and the congreg wa small mr granger went
through the servic with about as much liveli as a hors drive a
machin he ground it out prayer psalm litani lesson all in the
same depress wai till geoffrei felt inclin to go to sleep and
then took to watch beatric sweet face instead he wonder what
made her look so sad her wa alwai a sad face when in repos that he
knew but todai it wa particularli so and what wa more she look
worri as well as sad onc or twice he saw her glanc at mr davi
who wa sit opposit the solitari occup of an enorm pew and
he thought that there wa apprehens in her look but mr davi
did not return the glanc to judg from hi appear noth wa
troubl hi mind
inde geoffrei studi him in the same wai that he instinct
studi everybodi whom he met thought that he had never befor seen a
man who look quit so oxlik and absolut comfort and yet
he never wa more complet at fault the man seem stolid and cold
inde but it wa the cold of a volcano hi heart wa afir
all the human forc in him all the energi of hi sturdi life had
concentr themselv in a singl passion for the woman who wa so
near and yet so far from him he had never drawn upon the store had
never fritter hi heart awai thi woman strang and unusu as
it mai seem wa absolut the first whose glanc or voic had ever
stir hi blood hi passion for her had grown slowli for year
it had been grow ever sinc the greyei girl on the brink of
womanhood had conduct him to hi castl home it wa no fanci no
light desir to pass with the year which brought it owen had littl
imagin that soil from which love spring with the rank swift
of a tropic bloom to fade at the first chill breath of chang hi
passion wa an unalter fact it wa root like an oak on our stiff
english soil it fibr wrap hi heart and shot hi be through
and if so strong a gale should rise that it must fall then he too would
be overthrown
for year now he had thought of littl els than beatric to win her he
would have given all hi wealth ay thrice over if that were possibl
to win her to know her hi by right and hi alon ah that would be
heaven hi blood quiver and hi mind grew dim when he thought of it
what would it be to see her stand by him as she stood now and know
that she wa hi wife there is no form of passion more terribl than
thi it veri earthi make it aw
the servic went on at last mr granger mount the pulpit and began
to read hi sermon of which the text wa but the greatest of these is
chariti geoffrei notic that he bungl over some of the word
then suddenli rememb beatric had told him that she had written the
sermon and wa all attent he wa not disappoint notwithstand
mr granger infam read and hi habit of drop hi voic at
the end of a sentenc instead of rais it the beauti of the thought
and diction wa veri evid it wa inde a discours that might
equal well have been deliv in a mahomedan or a buddhist place of
worship there wa noth distinct christian about it it mere
appeal to the good in human natur but of thi neither the preacher
nor hi audienc seem to be awar inde few of the latter were
listen at all the sermon wa short and end with a passag of real
power and beautyor rather it did not end for close the ms sheet
mr granger follow on with a few impromptu remark of hi own
and now brethren he said i have been preach to you about
chariti but i wish to add on remark chariti begin at home there
is about a hundr pound of tith ow to me and some of it ha been
ow for two year and more if that tith is not paid i shall have to
put distraint on some of you and i thought that i had better take thi
opportun to tell you so
then he gave the benedict
the contrast between thi businesslik speech and the beauti
period which had gone befor wa so ridicul that geoffrei veri
nearli burst out laugh and beatric smile so did the rest of the
congreg except on or two who ow tith and owen davi who
wa think of other thing
as thei went through the churchyard geoffrei notic someth
beatric wa a few pace ahead hold effi hand present mr
davi pass him appar without see him and greet beatric
who bow slightli in acknowledg he walk a littl wai without
speak then geoffrei just as thei reach the church gate heard him
sai at four thi afternoon then again she bow her head and he
turn and went as for geoffrei he wonder what it all meant wa she
engag to him or wa she not
dinner wa a somewhat silent meal mr granger wa think about hi
tith also about a sick cow elizabeth thought pursu some dark and
deviou cours of their own not an altogeth agreeabl on to judg
from her face beatric look pale and worri even effi salli
did not do more than make her smile as for geoffrei himself he wa
engag in wonder in an idl sort of wai what wa go to happen at
four oclock
you is all veri dull said effi at last with a charm disregard of
grammar
peopl ought to be dull on sundai effi answer beatric with an
effort at least i suppos so she ad
elizabeth who wa aggress religi frown at thi remark she
knew her sister did not mean it
what ar you go to do thi afternoon beatric she ask suddenli
she had seen owen davi go up and speak to her sister and though she
had not been near enough to catch the word scent an assign from
afar
beatric colour slightli a fact that escap neither her sister nor
geoffrei
i am go to see jane llewellyn she answer jane llewellyn wa the
crazi littl girl whose tale ha been told up to that moment beatric
had no idea of go to see her but she knew that elizabeth would not
follow her there becaus the child could not endur elizabeth
oh i thought that perhap you were go out walk
i mai walk afterward answer beatric shortli
so there is an assign thought elizabeth and a cold gleam of
intellig pass across her face
shortli after dinner beatric put on her bonnet and went out ten
minut pass and elizabeth did the same then mr granger announc
that he wa go up to the farm there wa no servic till six to see
about the sick cow and ask geoffrei if he would like to accompani
him he said that he might as well if effi could come and have lit
hi pipe thei start
meanwhil beatric went to see the crazi child she wa not violent
todai and scarc knew her befor she had been in the hous ten
minut the situat develop itself
the cottag stood about twothird of the wai down a straggl street
which wa quit empti for bryngelli slept after dinner on sundai
at the top of thi street appear elizabeth a bibl in her hand as
though on district visit intent she look down the street and
see nobodi went for a littl walk then return onc more look
down the street thi time she wa reward the door of the llewellyn
cottag open and beatric appear instantli elizabeth withdrew to
such a posit that she could see without be seen and stand
as though irresolut await event beatric turn and took the road
that led to the beach
then elizabeth irresolut disappear she also turn and took the
road to the cliff walk veri fast pass behind the vicarag she
gain a point where the beach narrow to a width of not more than
fifti yard and sat down present she saw a man come along the
sand beneath her walk quickli it wa owen davi she wait and
watch seven or eight minut pass and a woman in a white dress
pass it wa beatric walk slowli
ah said elizabeth set her teeth as i thought rise she
pursu her path along the cliff keep three or four hundr yard
ahead which she could easili do by take short cut it wa a long
walk and elizabeth who wa not fond of walk got veri tire of it
but she wa a woman with a purpos and as such hard to beat so she
kept on steadili for nearli an hour till at length she came to the
spot known as the amphitheatr thi amphitheatr situat almost
opposit the red rock wa a halfr of cliff the side of which ran
in a semicircl almost down to the water edg that is at high tide
in the centr of the segment thu form wa a larg flat stone so
place that anybodi in certain posit on the cliff abov could
command a view of it though it wa screen by the project wall of
rock from observ from the beach elizabeth clamber a littl wai
down the slope side of the cliff and look on the stone hi back
toward her sat owen davi slip from stratum to stratum of the
broken cliff elizabeth drew slowli nearer till at length she wa
within fifti pace of the seat man here ensconc herself behind a
cleft rock she also sat down it wa not safe to go closer but in case
she should by ani chanc be observ from abov she open the bibl on
her knee as though she had sought thi quiet spot to studi it page
three or four minut pass and beatric appear round the project
angl of the amphitheatr and walk slowli across the level sand owen
davi rose and stretch out hi hand to welcom her but she did not
take it she onli bow and then seat herself upon the larg flat
stone owen also seat himself on it but some three or four feet awai
elizabeth thrust her white face forward till it wa almost level with
the lip of the cleft rock and strain her ear to listen ala she
could not hear a singl word

pain silenc i have come

her and wa veri elig he onli ask of her what most women ar
will enough to give under circumst so favour to their
wellbeingherself but she never like him he had alwai repel
her and she wa not a woman to marri a man whom she did not like
also dure the last week thi dislik and repuls had harden and
strengthen vagu as he plead with her beatric wonder why
and as she did so her ey fell upon the pattern she wa automat
prick in the sand it had taken the form of letter and the letter
were g e o f f r egreat heaven could that be the answer she flush
crimson with shame at the thought and pass her foot across the
telltal letter as she believ obliter them
owen saw the soften of her ey and saw the blush and misinterpret

think that marriag without love is the most unholi of our institut
and that is sai a good deal suppos i should sai ye to you

oh sai ye to thi it is a small request it cost you noth and it
give me hope without which i cannot live sai that i mai ask you onc

beatric thought for a moment such a promis could do her no harm and
in the cours of six month or a year he might get us to the idea of
live without her also it would prevent a scene it wa weak of her
but she dread the idea of her have refus owen davi come to her
father ear

often is and now goodby and beatric stretch out her hand
he touch it and she turn and went but owen did not go he sat upon
the rock hi head bow in miseri he had stake all hi hope upon
thi woman she wa the on desir thing to him the on star in
hi somewhat leaden sky and now that star wa eclips her word were
unequivoc thei gave but littl hope beatric wa scarc a woman to
turn round in six month or a year on the contrari there wa a fixiti
about her which frighten him what could be the caus of it how came
it that she should be so readi to reject him and all he had to offer
her after all she wa a girl in a small posit she could not be
look forward to a better match nor would the prospect move her on
wai or anoth there must be a reason for it perhap he had a rival
sure that must be the caus some enemi had done thi thing but who
at thi moment a woman shadow fell athwart him
oh have you come back he cri spring to hi feet
if you mean beatric answer a voiceit wa elizabethssh went
down to the beach ten minut ago i happen to be on the cliff and i
saw her

elizabeth sat down upon the rock where her sister had sat and see
the littl hole in the breach began indol to clear them of the
sand which beatric had swept over them with her foot thi wa no
difficult matter for the hole were deepli dug and it wa easi to
trace their posit present thei were nearli all clearthat is the
letter were legibl

in the beach which she had now clear of the sand of cours that is
possibl she is a curiou girl beatric is what ar those letter
mr davi
he look at them idli someth your sister wa write while i
talk to her i rememb see her do it
g e o f f r ewhi it must be meant for geoffrei ye of cours it
is possibl that there is somebodi els mr davi geoffreyhow
curiou
why is it curiou miss granger who is geoffrei
elizabeth laugh a disagre littl laugh that somehow attract
owen attent more than her word
how should i know it must be some friend of beatric and on of
whom she is think a great deal or she would not write hi name
unconsci the onli geoffrei that i know is mr geoffrei bingham
the barrist who is stai at the vicarag and whose life beatric
save she paus to watch her companion face and saw a new idea
creep across it stolid but of cours she went on it cannot be
mr bingham that she wa think of becaus you see he is marri
marri he said ye but he a man for all that and a veri
handsom on
ye i should call him handsomea fine man elizabeth answer
critic but as beatric said the other dai the great charm about
him is hi talk and power of mind he is a veri remark man and the
world will hear of him befor he ha done but howev all thi is
neither here nor there beatric is a curiou woman and ha strang
idea but i am sure that she would never carri on with a marri man
but he might carri on with her miss elizabeth
she laugh do you realli think that a man like mr bingham would try
to flirt with girl without encourag men like that ar as proud
as women and prouder the ladi must alwai be a step ahead but what
is the good of talk about such a thing it is all nonsens beatric
must have been think of some other geoffreyor it wa an accid of
someth why mr davi if you for on moment realli believ that
dear beatric could be guilti of such a shameless thing as to carri on
a flirtat with a marri man would you have ask her to marri you
would you still think of ask such a woman as she must be to becom
your wife
i dont know i suppos not he said doubtfulli
you suppos not i know you better than you know yourself you would
rather never marri at all than take such a woman as she would be prove
to be but it is no good talk such stuff if you have a rival you mai
be sure it is some unmarri man
owen reflect in hi heart that on the whole he would rather it wa a
marri on sinc a marri man at ani rate could not legal take
possess of beatric but elizabeth rigid moral alarm him and
he did not sai so
do you know i feel a littl upset miss elizabeth he answer i
think i will be go by the wai i promis to sai noth of thi to
your father i hope that you will not do so either
most certainli not said elizabeth and inde it would be the last
thing she would wish to do well goodby mr davi do not be
downheart it will all come right in the end you will alwai have me
to help you rememb
thank you thank you he said earnestli and went
elizabeth watch him round the wall of rock with a cold and ugli smile
set upon her face
you fool she thought you fool to tell me that you love her
dearli and want to marri her you want to get that sweet face of her
do you you never shall id spoil it first dear beatric she is not
capabl of carri on a love affair with a marri manoh certainli
not why she in love with him alreadi and he is more than half in
love with her if she hadnt been would she have put owen off not she
give them time and we shall see thei will ruin each otherthei must
ruin each other it wont be child plai when two peopl like that fall
in love thei will not stop at sigh there is too much human natur
about them it wa a good idea to get him into the hous and to see her
go on with that child effi just as though she wa it motherit make
me laugh ah beatric with all your wit you ar a silli woman and
on dai my dear girl i shall have the pleasur of expos you to
owen the idol will be unveil and there will be an end of your
chanc with him for he cant marri you after that then my turn will
come it is a question of timeonli a question of time

passion jealousi she love thi man owen davi as much as she
could love anybodi at the least she dearli love the wealth and
station of which he wa the visibl centr and she hate the sister
whom he desir if she could onli discredit that sister and show her

chapter xiii
geoffrei lectur
meanwhil beatric wa walk homeward with an uneasi mind the
troubl wa upon her she had it is true succeed in postpon it
a littl but she knew veri well that it wa onli a postpon owen
davi wa not a man to be easili shaken off she almost wish now that

and take her chanc on on point she wa howev quit clear she
would not marri owen davi she might be a fool for her pain but
she would not do it she respect herself too much to marri a man
she did not love a man whom she posit dislik no never she
exclaim aloud stamp her foot upon the shingl
never what said a voic within two yard of her
she start violent and look round there hi back rest against
a rock a pipe in hi mouth an open letter on hi knee and hi hat
drawn down almost over hi ey sat geoffrei he had left effi to go
home with mr granger and climb down a slope place in the cliff
had stroll along the beach the letter on hi knee wa on from hi
wife it wa short and there wa noth particular in it effi name
wa not even mention it wa to see if he had not overlook it that
he wa read the note through again no it mere relat to ladi
honoria safe arriv gave a list of the peopl stai at the halla

dislik among themand the number of brace of partridg which had
been kill on the previou dai then came an assur that honoria
wa enjoi herself immens and that the new french cook wa simpli
perfect the letter end with love
never what miss granger he said again as he lazili fold up the
sheet
never mind of cours she answer recov herself how you
startl me mr bingham i had no idea there wa anybodi on the beach
it is quit free is it not he answer get up i thought you
were go to trampl me into the pebbl it almost alarm when on
is think about a sundai nap to see a young ladi stride along then
suddenli stop stamp her foot and sai no never luckili i knew that
you were about or i should realli have been frighten
how did you know that i wa about beatric ask a littl defiantli
it wa no busi of hi to observ her movement
in two wai look he said point to a patch of white sand that
i think is your footprint
well what of it said beatric with a littl laugh
noth in particular except that it is your footprint he answer
then i happen to meet old edward who wa loaf along and he
inform me that you and mr davi had gone up the beach there is hi
footprintmr daviess i meanbut you dont seem to have been veri
sociabl becaus here is your right in the middl of it therefor you
must have been walk in indian file and a littl wai back in parallel
line with quit thirti yard between you
why do you take the troubl to observ thing so close she ask in
a half amus and half angri tone
i dont knowa habit of the legal mind i suppos on might make
quit a romanc out of those footprint on the sand and the littl
subsequ event but you have not heard all my thrill tale old
edward also inform me that he saw your sister miss elizabeth go
along the cliff almost level with you from which he conclud that you
had argu as to the shortest wai to the red rock and were put the
matter to the proof
elizabeth said beatric turn a shade paler what can she have
been do i wonder
take exercis probabl like yourself well i seat myself with my
pipe in the shadow of that rock when suddenli i see mr davi come
along toward bryngelli as though he were walk for a wager hi hat
fix upon the back of hi head liter he walk over my leg and
never saw me then you follow and ejacul no neverand that is
the end of my stori have i your permiss to walk with you or shall i
interfer with the develop of the plot
there is no plot and as you said just now the beach is free beatric
answer petulantli
thei walk on a few yard and then he spoke in anoth toneth
mean of the assign he had overheard in the churchyard grew clear
to him now
i believ that i have to congratul you miss granger he said
and i do so veri heartili it is not everybodi who is so fortun as
to
beatric stop and half turn face him
what do you mean mr bingham she said i do not understand your
dark sai
mean oh noth particular except that i wish to congratul you
on your engag
my engag what engag
it seem that there is some mistak he said and struggl as he might
to suppress it hi tone wa on of relief i understood that you had
becom engag to be marri to mr owen davi if i am wrong i am sure
i apologis
you ar quit wrong mr bingham i dont know who put such a notion
into your head but there is no truth in it
then allow me to congratul you on there be no truth in it you
see that is the beauti of nine affair matrimoni out of tenther
ar two or more side of them if thei come off the amiabl and
disinterest observ can look at the bright sidea in thi case
lot of monei romant castl by the sea gentleman of unexcept
anteced c c c if on the other hand thei dont caus can
still be found for thankfulnessladi might do better after all castl
by the sea rather draughti and cold in spring gentlemen most estim
but perhap a littl dull and so on you see
there wa a note of mockeri about hi talk which irrit beatric
exceedingli it wa not like mr bingham to speak so it wa not even
the wai that a gentleman out of hi teen should speak to a ladi on such
a subject he knew thi as well as she did and wa secretli asham of
himself but the truth must out though geoffrei did not admit it even
to himself he wa bitterli and profoundli jealou and jealou peopl
have no manner beatric could not howev be expect to know thi
and natur grew angri
i do not quit understand what you ar talk about mr bingham she
said put on her most dignifi air and beatric could look rather
alarm you have pick up a piec of unfound gossip and now you
take advantag of it to laugh at me and to sai rude thing of mr
davi it is not kind
oh no it wa the footstep miss granger and the gossip and the
appoint you made in the churchyard that i unwillingli overheard
not the gossip alon which led me into my mistak of cours i have now
to apologis
again beatric stamp her foot she saw that he wa still mock her
and felt that he did not believ her
there he went on stung into unkind by hi bite but
unacknowledg jealousi for she wa righton reflect he did
not quit believ what she said as to her not be engag how
unfortun i ami have said someth to make you angri again why did
you not walk with mr davi i should then have remain guiltless of
offenc and you would have had a more agreeabl companion you want to
quarrel with me what shall we quarrel about there ar mani thing on
which we ar diametr oppos let us start on
it wa too much for though hi word were noth the tone in which
he spoke gave them a sting beatric alreadi disturb in mind by the
scene through which she had pass her breast alreadi throb with
a vagu troubl of which she did not know the mean for onc in her
life lost control of herself and grew hyster her grei ey fill
with tear the corner of her sweet mouth drop and she look veri
much as though she were go to burst out weep
it is most unkind of you she said with a half sob if you knew how
much i have to put up with you would not speak to me like that i know
that you do not believ me veri well i will tell you the truth ye
though i have no busi to do it and you have no rightnon at
allto make me do it i will tell you the truth becaus i cannot bear
that you should not believ me mr davi did want me to marri him and
i refus him i put him off for a while i did thi becaus i knew that
if i did not he would go to my father it wa cowardli but my father
would make my life wretch and again she gave a halfchok sob
much ha been said and written about the effect produc upon men by
the sight of a ladi in or on the border line of tear and there is no
doubt that thi effect is consider man be in hi right mind
is deepli move by such a spectacl also he is frighten becaus he
dread a scene now most peopl would rather walk ten mile in their
dress shoe than have to deal with a young ladi in hyster howev
modifi put the peculiar circumst of the case asid geoffrei
wa no except to thi rule it wa all veri well to cross spear
with beatric who had quit an equal wit and wa veri capabl of
retali but to see her surrend at discret wa altogeth
anoth thing inde he felt much asham of himself
pleas dontdontb put out he said he did not like to us the
word cry i wa onli laugh at you but i ought not to have spoken
as i did i did not wish to forc your confid inde i did not i
never thought of such a thing i am so sorri
hi remors wa evid genuin and beatric felt somewhat appeas
perhap it did not altogeth griev her to learn that she could make
him feel sorri
you did not forc my confid she said defiantli quit forget
that a moment befor she had reproach him for make her speak
i told you becaus i did not choos that you should think i wa not
speak the truthand now let us chang the subject she impos no
reserv on him as to what she had reveal she knew that there wa no
necess to do so the secret would be between themanoth danger
link
beatric recov her composur and thei walk slowli on
tell me mr bingham she said present how can a woman earn her
livingi mean a girl like myself without ani special qualif
some of them get on
well he answer that depend upon the girl what sort of a live
do you mean you ar earn a live now of a kind
ye but sometim if onli i could manag it i think that i should
like to get awai from here and take anoth line someth bigger i
do not suppos that i ever shall but i like to think of it sometim
i onli know of two thing which a woman can turn to he said the
stage and literatur of cours he ad hastili the first is out of
the question in your case
and so is the other i am afraid she answer shake her head that
is if by literatur you mean imagin write and i suppos that
is the onli wai to get into notic as i told you i lost my
imaginationwel to be frank when i lost my faith at on time i us
to have plenti as i us to have plenti of faith but the on went with
the other i do not understand why
dont you i think i do a mind without religi sentiment is like a
star without atmospher brighter than other star but not so soft to
see religion poetri music imagin and even some of the
more exalt form of passion flourish in the same soil and ar i
sometim think differ manifest of the same thing do you know
it is ridicul to hear you talk of have lost your faith becaus i
dont believ it at the worst it ha gone to sleep and will wake
up again on dai possibl you mai not accept some particular form of
faith but i tell you frankli that to reject all religion simpli becaus
you cannot understand it is noth but a form of atroci spiritu
vaniti your mind is too big for you miss granger it ha run awai
with you but you know it is ti by a stringit cannot go far and now
perhap you will be angri again
no inde why should i be angri i daresai that you ar quit right
and i onli hope that i mai be abl to believ again i will tell you how
i lost belief i had a littl brother whom i love more than anyth
els in the world inde after my mother di he wa the onli thing i
realli had to love for i think that my father care more for elizabeth
than he doe for me she is so much the better at busi matter and
elizabeth and i never quit got on i daresai that the fault is mine
but the fact remainsw ar sister but we ar not intim well my
brother fell ill of a fever and for a long time he lai between life and
death and i prai for him as i never prai for anybodi or anyth
beforey i prai that i might die instead of him then he pass
through the crisi and got better and i thank god think that my
prayer had been answer oh how happi i wa for those ten dai and
then thi happenedmi brother got a chill a relaps follow and in
three dai he wa dead the last word that he spoke to me were oh
dont let me die beeh us to call me beepleas dont let me
die dear bee but he di di in my arm and when it wa over i
rose from hi side feel as though my heart wa dead also i prai
no more after that it seem to me as though my prayer had been mock
at as though he had been given back to me for a littl while in order
that the blow might be more crush when it fell
dont you think that you were a littl foolish in take such a view
said geoffrei have you not been amus sometim to read about the
earli christianshow the lead would not boil the martyr or the lion
would not eat him or the rain from a blue sky put out the fire and how
the pagan king at onc wa convert and accept a great mani
difficult doctrin without further delai the athanasian creed wa not
necessarili true becaus the fire would not light or the sword would not
cut nor excus me were all your old belief wrong becaus your prayer
wa unansw it is an ancient stori that we cannot tell whether the
answer of our petit will be good or ill for us of cours i do
not know anyth about such thing but it seem to me rash to suppos
that provid is go to alter the work of it etern law mere
to suit the pass wish of individualswish too that in mani
case would bring unforeseen sorrow if fulfil besid i daresai
that the poor child is happier dead than he would have been had he
live it is not an altogeth pleasant world for most of us
ye mr bingham i know and i daresai that i should have got over the
shock in time onli after that i began to read i read the histori of
the religion and compar them and i read the work of those writer
who have risen up to attack them i found or i thought that i found
the same spring of superstit in them allsuperstit aris from
elementari natur caus and hand on with variat from race to
race and time to time in some i found the same stori onli with a
slightli alter face and i learn moreov that each faith deni
the other and claim truth for itself alon
after that too i went to the colleg and there i fell in with a ladi
on of the mistress who wa the cleverest woman that i ever knew
and in her wai a good woman but on who believ that religion wa the
curs of the world and who spent all her spare time in attack it in
some form or other poor thing she is dead now and so you see what
between these caus and the continu spectacl of human miseri which
to my mind neg the idea of a merci and watch power at last
it came to pass that the onli altar left in my templ is an altar to the
unknown god
geoffrei like most men who have had to think on these matter did not
care to talk about them much especi to women for on thing he wa
consciou of a tendenc to speech less rever than hi thought but he
had not enter beatric church of dark inde he had turn
hi back on it for ever though like most peopl he had at differ
period of hi past life tarri an hour in it porch so he ventur on
an object
i am no theologian he said and i am not fond of discuss on such
matter but there ar just on or two thing i should like to sai it
is no argument to my mind at least to point to the exist of evil
and unhappi among men as a proof of the absenc of a superior merci
for what ar men that such thing should not be with them man
too must own some master if he ha doubt let him look up at the
marshal of the starri heaven and thei will vanish
no said beatric i fear not kant said so but befor that molir
had put the argument in the mouth of a fool the starri heaven no
more prove anyth than doe the run of the raindrop down the
windowpan it is not a question of size and quantiti
i might accept the illustr answer geoffrei on exampl of
law is as good as anoth for my purpos i see in it all the work of
a live will but of cours that is onli my wai of look at it not
your
no i am afraid said beatric all thi reason drawn from
materi thing doe not touch me that is how the pagan made their
religion and it is how palei strive to prove hi thei argu from
the out to the in from the materi to the spiritu it cannot be if
christian is true it must stand upon spiritu feet and speak with a
spiritu voic to be heard not in the thunderstorm but onli in the
heart of men the exist of creativ forc doe not demonstr the
exist of a redeem if anyth it tend to neg it for the
power that creat is also the power which destroi what doe touch me
howev is the thought of the multitud of the dead that is what we
care for not for an etern forc ever creat and destroi think
of them allal the soul of unheardof race almost anim who
pass awai so long ago can our endur more than their and do you
think that the spirit of an ethiopian who di in the time of mose is
anywher now
there wa room for them all on earth answer geoffrei the univers
is wide it doe not dismai me there ar mysteri in our natur the
natur we think we knowshal there be none in that which we know not
world die to live again when after million of ag the condit
becom onc more favour to life and why should not a man we
ar creatur of the world we reflect it everi light and shadow we
rejoic in it rejoic it everi featur ha a tini parallel in us
why should not our fate be as it fate and it fate is so far as we
know etern it mai chang from ga to chao from chao to activ
life from activ life to seem death then it mai onc more pass into
it element and from those element back again to concret be
and so on for ever alwai chang but alwai the same so much for
natur allegori it is not a perfect analog for man is a thing
apart from all thing els it mai be onli a hint or a type but it is
someth
now to come to the question of our religion i confess i draw quit a
differ conclus from your fact you sai that you trace the same
superstit in all religion and that the same spiritu myth ar in
some shape present in almost all well doe not thi suggest that the
same great truth underli them all take from time to time the
shape which is best suit to the spiritu develop of those
profess each everi great new religion is better than the last you
cannot compar osirian with buddhism or buddhism with christian
or mahomedan with the arabian idol worship take the old
illustrationtak a cut crystal and hold it in the sun and you
will see mani differ colour rai come from it facet thei look
differ but thei ar all born of the same great light thei ar all
the same light mai it not be so with religion let your altar be to the
unknown god if you likefor who can give an unalt like to
the power abov usbut do not knock your altar down
depend upon it miss granger all indic to the contrari
notwithstand there is a watch provid without the will of
which we cannot live and if we deliber reject that provid
set up our intellig in it place sorrow will come of it even
here for it is wiser than we i wish that you would try and look at
the question from anoth point of viewfrom a higher point of view i
think you will find that it will bear a great deal of examin and
that you will come to the conclus that the dictum of the wiseacr
who sai there is noth becaus he can see noth is not necessarili
a true on there that is all i have to sai and i wish that i could
sai it better
thank you said beatric i will why here we ar at home i must go
and put effi to bed
and here it mai be state that geoffrei advic wa not altogeth
thrown awai beatric did try look at the question again and if
faith did not altogeth come back to her at least hope did and the
greatest of these which is chariti had never desert her hope came
slowli back not by argument probabl but rather by exampl in the sea
of doubt she saw anoth buoi up if it were but on broken piec of
the ship thi encourag her geoffrei believ and shebeliev in
geoffrei inde is not thi the secret of woman philosophyeven
to some extent of that of such a woman as beatric let the faith or
unfaith of thi that or the other rabbi answer for me she saysit
is her last argument she believ in thi or that or some other
philosoph that is her creed and geoffrei wa the person in whom
beatric began to believ all the more wholli becaus she had never
believ in ani on befor whatev els she wa to lose thi at least
she won when she save hi life
chapter xiv
drift
on the dai follow their religi discuss an accid happen
which result in geoffrei and beatric be more than ever thrown
in the compani of each other dure the previou week two case of
scarlatina had been report among the school children and now it wa
found that the complaint had spread so much that it wa necessari to
close the school thi meant of cours that beatric had all her time
upon her hand and so had geoffrei it wa hi custom to bath befor
breakfast after which he had noth to do for the rest of the dai
beatric with littl effi also bath befor breakfast from the ladi
bathingplac a quarter of a mile off and sometim he would meet her
as she return glow with health and beauti like venu new risen
from the cyprian sea her halfdri hair hang in heavi mass down
her back then after breakfast thei would take effi down to the beach
and her aunti as the child learn to call beatric would teach her
lesson and poetri till she wa tire and ran awai to paddl in the sea
or look for prawn among the rock
meanwhil the child father and beatric would talknot about
religion thei spoke no more on that subject nor about owen davi
but of everyth els on earth beatric wa a merri woman when she wa
happi and thei never lack subject of convers for their mind
were veri much in tune in booklearn beatric had the advantag of
geoffrei for she had not onli read enorm she also rememb what
she read and could appli it her critic faculti too wa veri keen
he on the other hand had more knowledg of the world and in hi rich
dai had travel a good deal and so it came to pass that each could
alwai find someth to tell the other never for on second were thei
dull not even when thei sat for an hour or so in silenc for it wa
the silenc of complet companionship
so the long morn would wear awai all too quickli and thei would go
in to dinner to be greet with a cold smile by elizabeth and heartili
enough by the old gentleman who never thought of anyth out of hi
own circl of affair after dinner it wa the same stori either thei
went walk to look for fern and flower or perhap geoffrei took hi
gun and hid behind the rock for curlew send beatric who knew the
coast by heart a mile round or more to some headland in order to put
them on the wing then she would come back spring toward him from
rock to rock and crouch down beneath a neighbour seaweedcov
boulder and thei would talk togeth in whisper or perhap thei would
not talk at all for fear lest thei should frighten the flight bird
and geoffrei would first search the heaven for curlew or duck and
see none would let hi ey fall upon the pure beauti of beatric
face show so clearli against the tender sky and wonder what she wa
think about till suddenli feel hi gaze she would turn with a
smile as sweet as the first rosi blush of dawn upon the water and ask
him what he wa think about and he would laugh and answer you
whereon she would smile again and perhap blush a littl feel glad
at heart she knew not why
then came teatim and the quiet when thei sat at the open window
and geoffrei smoke and listen to the soft surg of the sea and
the harmoni whisper of the night air in the pine in the corner mr
granger slept in hi armchair or perhap he had gone to bed altogeth
for he like to go to bed at halfpast eight as the old herefordshir
farmer hi father had done befor him and at the far end of the room
sat elizabeth do her account by the light of a solitari candl
or if thei fail her read some book of a devot and inspir
charact but over the edg of the book or from the page of crab
account her ey would glanc continu toward the handsom pair in
the windowplac and she would smile as she saw that it went well onli
thei never saw the glanc or note the smile when geoffrei look that
wai which wa not often for elizabethold elizabeth as he alwai
call her to himselfdid not attract him all he saw wa her sharp but
capablelook form bend over her work and the light of the candl
gleam on her strawcolour hair and fall in gleam white
patch on her hard knuckl
and so the happi dai would pass and bedtim come and with it unbidden
dream
geoffrei thought no ill of all thi as of cours he ought to have
thought he wa not the raven lion of fictionso rare if ever to
be met with in real lifego about seek whom he might devour he
had absolut no design on beatric affect ani more than she
had on hi and he had forgotten that first fell prescienc of evil to
come onc or twice it is true qualm of doubt did cross hi mind in
the earlier dai of their intimaci but he put them by as absurd he
wa no believ in the tender helpless of fullgrown women hi
experi have been that thei ar ampli capableand for the most
part more than capableof look after themselv it seem to him
a thing ridicul that such a person as beatric who wa compet to
form opinion and a judgment upon all the import question of life
should be treat as a child and that he should remov himself from
bryngelli lest her young affect should becom entangl he felt
sure that thei would never be entrap in ani direct whatsoev
without her full consent
then he ceas to think about the matter at all inde the mere
idea of such a thing involv a supposit that would onli have been
accept to a conceit mannam that there wa a possibl of
thi young ladi fall in love with him what right had he to suppos
anyth of the sort it wa an impertin that there wa anoth
sort of possibilitynam of hi becom more attach to her than
wa altogeth desirabledid howev occur to him onc or twice but
he shrug hi shoulder and put it by after all it wa hi look out
and he did not much care it would do her no harm at the worst but veri
soon all these shadowi forebod of dawn troubl vanish quit
thei were lost in the broad sweet light of friendship byandbi when
friendship dai wa done thei might aris again call by other name
and wear a sterner face
it wa ridiculousof cours it wa ridicul he wa not go to fall
in love like a boi at hi time of life all he felt wa gratitud
and interestal she felt wa amus in hi societi as for the
intimacyfelt rather than expressedth intimaci that could alreadi
almost enabl the on to divin the other thought that could shape
her mood to hi and hi to her that could caus the same thing of
beauti to be a common joi and discov uniti of mind in opinion the
most oppositewhi it wa onli natur between peopl who had togeth
pass a peril terribl to think of so thei took the good the god
provid and drift softli onwhith thei did not stop to inquir
on dai howev a littl incid happen that ought to have open
the ey of both thei had arrang or rather there wa a tacit
understand that thei should go out togeth in the afternoon
geoffrei wa to take hi gun and beatric a book but it chanc that
just befor dinner as she walk back from the villag where she had
gone to bui some thread to mend effi cloth beatric came face to
face with mr davi it wa their first meet without wit sinc
the sundai of which the event have been describ and natur
therefor rather an awkward on owen stop short so that she could
not pass him with a bow and then turn and walk besid her after a
remark or two about the weather the spring of convers ran dry
you rememb that you ar come up to the castl thi afternoon he
said at length
to the castl she answer no i have heard noth of it
did not your sister tell you she made an engag for herself and you

then beatric rememb elizabeth had told her and she had thought it
best to accept the situat the whole thing had gone out of her mind

beatric went on home in a curious irrit condit of mind she
did not natur want to go to the castl and she did want to go out
with geoffrei howev there wa no help for it
when she came in to dinner she found that geoffrei wa not there he
had it seem gone to lunch with dr chamber whom he had met on the
beach befor he return thei were all three start for the castl
beatric leav a messag to thi effect with betti
about a quarter of an hour afterward geoffrei came back to fetch hi
gun and beatric but beatric wa gone and all that he could extract
from betti wa that she had gone to see mr davi
he wa perfectli furiou though all the while he knew how unreason
wa hi anger he had been look forward to the expedit and thi
sudden chang of plan wa too much for hi temper off he start
howev to pass a thoroughli miser afternoon he seem to miss
beatric more each step and gradual to grow more and more angri at
what he call her rude of cours it never occur to him that
what he wa realli angri at wa her go to see mr davi or that in
truth her societi had becom so delight to him that to be depriv
of it even for an afternoon wa to be wretch to top everyth he
onli got three good shot that afternoon and he miss them all which

unus room and show them the pictur but she had seen them befor
and though some of them were veri fine did not care to look at them

four thousand guinea hang on a wall
and so thei went on elizabeth ask question and owen answer them
by the help of the catalogu till to beatric relief thei came at
length to the end of the pictur then thei took some tea in the littl
sit room of the master of all thi magnific owen to her great
annoy sat opposit to beatric stare at her with all hi ey
while she drank her tea with effi sit in her lap and elizabeth
observ it bit her lip in jealousi she had thought it well to bring

after thei had return to the vicarag and beatric had heard effi her
prayer and tuck her up in her small white bed she went down to the
gate to be quiet for a littl while befor supper geoffrei had not yet
come in
it wa a love autumn even the sea seem to sleep and the littl
cloud from which the sunset fire had pale lai like wreath of
smoke upon the infinit blue sky why had not mr bingham come back
she wonder he would scarc have time to dress suppos that an
accid had happen to him nonsens what accid could happen he
wa so big and strong he seem to defi accid and yet had it not
been for her there would be littl enough left of hi strength todai
ah she wa glad that she had live to be abl to save him from death
there he came loom like a giant in the even mist
there wa a small handgat besid the larg on on which she leant
geoffrei stalk straight up to it as though he did not see her he saw
her well enough but he wa cross with her
she allow him to pass through the gate which he shut slowli perhap
to give her an opportun of speak if she wish to do so then
think that he did not see her she spoke in her soft music voic

chapter xv
onli goodnight
five more dai pass all too quickli and onc more mondai came round
it wa the 22nd of octob and the michaelma sit began on the
24th on the morrow tuesdai geoffrei wa to return to london there
to meet ladi honoria and get to work at chamber that veri morn
inde a brief the biggest he had yet receivedit wa mark thirti
guineashad been forward to him from hi chamber with a note from
hi clerk to the effect that the case wa expect to be in the special
juri list on the first dai of the sit and that the clerk had made
an appoint for him with the solicitor for 515 on the tuesdai the
brief wa sent to him by hi uncl firm and mark with you the
attorneygener and mr candleton qc the wellknown leader of the
probat and divorc court bar never befor had geoffrei found himself
in such honour compani that is on the back of a brief and not a
littl wa he elat therebi
but when he came to look into the case hi joi abat somewhat for
it wa on of the most perplex that he had ever known the will
contest which wa that of a yorkshir moneylend dispos of
properti to the valu of over 80000 and wa propound by a niec of
the testat who when he di if not actual weak in hi mind wa
in hi dotag and superstiti to the verg of insan the niec to
whom all the properti wa leftto the exclus of the son and daughter
of the deceas both marri and live awai from homestai with
the testat and look after him shortli befor hi death howev he
and thi niec had violent quarrel on account of an intimaci
which the latter had form with a marri man of bad reput who wa
a discharg lawyer clerk so seriou had been the quarrel that onli
three dai befor hi death the testat had sent for a lawyer and
formal by mean of a codicil depriv the niec of a sum of 2000
which he had left her all the rest of hi properti be divid
between hi son and daughter three dai afterward howev he duli
execut a fresh will in the presenc of two servant by which he
left all hi properti to the niec to the entir exclus of hi
own children thi will though veri short wa in proper form and
wa written by nobodi knew whom the servant state that the testat
befor sign it wa perfectli acquaint with it content for the
niec had made him repeat them in their presenc thei also declar
howev that he seem in a terribl fright and said twice it
behind me it behind me
within an hour of the sign of the will the testat wa found dead
appar from the effect of fear but the niec wa not in the room
at the time of death the onli other remark circumst in the case
wa that the disreput lover of the niec had been seen hang about
the hous at dusk the testat have di at ten oclock at night
there wa also a further fact the son on receiv a messag from
the niec that hi father wa serious wors had hurri with
extraordinari speed to the hous pass some on or somethingh
could not tell whatthat seem to be run appar from the
window of the sick man room which wa on the ground floor and
beneath which footmark were afterward found of these footmark two
cast had been taken of which photograph were forward with the
brief thei had been made by nake feet of small size and in each
case the littl joint of the third toe of the right foot seem to be
miss but all attempt to find the feet that made them had hitherto
fail the will wa contest by the next of kin for whom geoffrei wa
on of the counsel upon the usual ground of undu influenc and fraud
but as it seem at present with small prospect of success for though
the circumst were superstiti enough there wa not the slightest
evid of either thi curiou case of which the outlin ar here
written is briefli set out becaus it prove to be the foundat of
geoffrei enorm practic and reput at the bar
he read the brief through twice thought it over well and could make
littl of it it wa perfectli obviou to him that there had been foul
plai somewher but he found himself quit unabl to form a workabl
hypothesi wa the person who had been seen run awai concern
in the matterif it wa a person if so wa he the author of the
footprint of cours the exlawy clerk had someth to do with
it but what in vain did geoffrei cudgel hi brain everi idea that
occur to him broke down somewher or other
we shall lose thi he said aloud in despair suspici
circumst ar not enough to upset a will and then address
beatric who wa sit at the tabl work
here miss granger you have a smatter of law see if you can make
anyth of thi and he push the heavi brief toward her
beatric took it with a laugh and for the next threequart of an
hour her fair brow wa pucker up in a wai quaint to see at last she
finish and shut the brief up let me look at the photograph she
said
geoffrei hand them to her she veri carefulli examin first on and
then the other and as she did so a light of intellig broke out upon
her face
well portia have you got it he ask
i have got someth she answer i do not know if it is right
dont you see the old man wa superstiti thei frighten him first
of all by a ghostli voic or some such thing into sign the will and
then to death after he had sign it the lawyer clerk prepar the
willh would know how to do it then he wa smuggl into the room
under the bed or somewher dress up as a ghost perhap the send
for the son by the niec wa a blind the thing that wa seen run
awai wa a boythos footprint were made by a boi i have seen so mani
thousand on the sand here that i could swear to it he wa attract
to the hous from the road which wa quit near by catch sight
of someth unusu through the blind the brief sai there were no
curtain or shutter now look at the photograph of the footprint
see in no 1 found outsid the window the toe ar press down deepli
into the mud the owner of the feet wa stand on tipto to get a
better view but in no 2 which wa found near where the son thought
he saw a person run the toe ar spread out quit wide that is the
footprint of some on who wa in a great hurri now it is not probabl
that a boi had anyth to do with the testat death why then wa
the boi run so hard i will tell you becaus he wa frighten at
someth he had seen through the blind so frighten wa he that he
will not come forward or answer the advertis and inquiri find
a boi in that town who ha a joint miss on the third toe of the right
foot and you will soon know all about it
by jove said geoffrei what a crimin lawyer you would make i
believ that you have got it but how ar we to find thi boi with the
miss toejoint everi possibl inquiri ha alreadi been made and
fail nobodi ha seen such a boi whose defici would probabl be
known by hi parent or schoolfellow
ye said beatric it ha fail becaus the boi ha taken to
wear shoe which inde he would alwai have to do at school hi
parent if he ha ani would perhap not speak of hi disfigur
and no on els might know of it especi if he were a newcom in
the neighbourhood it is quit possibl that he took off hi boot in
order to creep up to the window and now i will tell you how i should
set to work to find him i should have everi bathingplac in the
river run through the townther is a rivercarefulli watch
by detect in thi weather the autumn wa an unusu warm on
boi of that class often paddl and sometim bath if thei watch
close enough thei will probabl find a boi with a miss toe joint
among the number
what a good idea said geoffrei i will telegraph to the lawyer at
onc i certainli believ that you have got the clue
and as it turn out afterward beatric had got it her supposit
were right in almost everi particular the boi who prove to be the son
of a pedlar who had recent come into the town wa found wade and
by a clever trick which need not be detail frighten into tell
the truth as he had previous frighten himself into hold hi
tongu he had even as beatric conjectur taken off hi boot to
creep up to the window and as he ran awai in hi fright had drop
them into a ditch full of water there thei were found and went far to
convinc the juri of the truth of hi stori thu it wa that beatric
quick wit laid the foundat of geoffrei great success
thi particular mondai wa a field dai at the vicarag jone had prove
obdur no power on earth could induc him to pai the 34 11 4d due
on account of tith therefor mr granger fortifi by a judgment duli
obtain had announc hi intent of distrain upon joness hai
and cattl jone had repli with insol defianc if ani bailiff
or auction or such peopl came to sell hi hai he would kill him or
them
so said jone and summon hi support mani of whom ow tith and
none of whom wish to pai it to do battl in hi caus for hi part
mr granger retain an auction of undoubt courag who wa to
arriv on thi veri afternoon support by six policemen and carri out
the sale beatric felt nervou about the whole thing but elizabeth
wa veri determin and the old clergyman wa now bombast and now
despond the auction arriv duli by the on oclock train he
wa a tall ablebodi man not unlik geoffrei in appear inde at
twenti yard distanc it would have been difficult to tell them apart
the sale wa fix for halfpast two and mr johnsonthat wa the
auction namew to the inn to get hi dinner befor proceed
to busi he wa inform of the hostil demonstr which await
him and that an english member of parliament had been sent down
especi to head the mob but be a man of mettl poohpooh the
whole affair
all bark sir he said to geoffrei all bark and no bite im not
afraid of these peopl why if thei wont bid for the stuff i will bui
it in myself
all right said geoffrei but i advis you to look out i fanci that
the old man is a rough custom
then geoffrei went back to hi dinner
as thei sat at the meal through a gap in the fir tree thei saw that
the great major of the popul of bryngelli wa stream up
toward the scene of the sale some to agit and some to see the fun
it is pretti well time to be off said geoffrei ar you come mr
granger
well answer the old gentleman i wish to do so but elizabeth
think that i had better keep awai and after all you know he ad
airili perhap it is as well for a clergyman not to mix himself up too
much in these tempor matter no i want to go and see about some
pig at the other end of the parish and i think that i shall take thi
opportun
you ar not go mr bingham ar you ask beatric in a voic
which betrai her anxieti

and so thei went leav beatric a prei to melancholi forebod
she wait in the hous for the best part of an hour make pretenc to
plai with effi then her anxieti got the better of her she put on her
hat and start leav effi in charg of the servant betti
beatric walk quickli along the cliff till she came in sight of
joness farm from where she stood she could make out a great crowd
of men and even when the wind turn toward her catch the nois of
shout present she heard a sound like the report of a gun saw the
crowd break up in violent confus and then cluster togeth again in
a dens mass
what could it mean beatric wonder
as the thought cross her mind she perceiv two men run toward
her with all their speed follow by a woman three minut more and
she saw that the woman wa elizabeth

sound of them no word came from her lip oh what should she do
where should she hide herself in her grief
a few yard from the path grew a stunt tree with a larg flat stone
at it root thither beatric stagger and sank upon the stone while
still the solid earth spun round and round
present her mind clear a littl and a keener pang of pain shot
through her soul she had been stun at first now she felt
perhap it wa not true perhap elizabeth had been mistaken or had
onli said it to torment her she rose she flung herself upon her
knee there by the stone and prai thi first time for mani
yearssh prai with all her soul oh god if thou art spare him
hi life and me thi agoni in her dread pang of grief her faith
wa thu reborn and as all human be must in their hour of mortal
agoni beatric realis her depend on the unseen she rose and
weak with emot sank back on to the stone the peopl were stream

peopl howev took it all goodnaturedli enough thei had a beauti
effigi of your father swing on a pole with a placard on hi breast
on which wa written the robber of the widow and the orphan and
thei were sing welsh song onli i saw jone who wa more than half
drunk curs and swear in welsh and english when the auction
began to sell jone went into the hous and bone went with him
after enough had been sold to pai the debt and while the mob wa still
laugh and shout suddenli the back door of the hous open and
out rush jone now quit drunk a gun in hi hand and bone hang

the face kill him dead that is all the stori
and quit enough too said beatric with a shudder what time we

geoffrei could not help smile at thi wai of look at thing
from which howev mr granger seem to draw a littl comfort from

rememb her onli as the companion of a rough adventur what did it

a faint regret she saw herself grow slowli old her beauti fade
yearli from her face and form companion onli by the love that grow
not old oh it wa bitter bitter and yet she would not have it
otherwis even in her pain she felt it better to have found thi deep

never to have look upon hi face if she could onli know that what she
gave wa given back again that he love her as she love him she would
be content she wa innoc she had never tri to draw him to her
she had us no touch or look no woman art or lure such as her

sea and how vast the heaven through which the star sail on
what wa it then thi love of her wa it mere earthli passion no
it wa more it wa someth grander purer deeper and quit undi
whenc came it then if she wa as she had thought onli a child of
earth whenc came thi deep desir which wa not of the earth had she
been wrong had she a soulsometh that could love with the bodi and
through the bodi and beyond the bodysometh of which the bodi with
it yearn wa but the envelop the hand or instrument oh now it
seem to beatric that thi wa so and that call into be by her
love she and her soul stood face to face acknowledg their uniti onc
she had held that it wa phantasi that such spiritu hope were but
exhal from a heart unsatisfi that when love escap us on the
earth in our despair we swear it is immort and that we shall find
it in the heaven now beatric believ thi no more love had kiss
her on the ey and at hi kiss her sleep spirit wa awaken and
she saw a vision of the truth
ye she love him and must alwai love him but she could never know
on earth that he wa her and if she had a spirit to be freed after
some few year would not hi spirit have forgotten her in that far
hereaft of their meet
she drop her brow upon her arm and softli sob what wa there left
for her to do except to sobtil her heart broke
elizabeth ly with wideopen ear heard the sob elizabeth peer
through the moonlight saw her sister form trembl in the convuls
of her sorrow and smile a smile of malic
the thing is done she thought she cri becaus the man is go
dont cry beatric dont cry we will get your playth back for you
oh with such a bait it will be easi he is as sweet on you as you on
him
there wa someth evil someth almost devilish in thi scene
of the on watch woman hold a clue to and enjoi the secret
tortur of the other plot the while to turn them to her innoc
rival destruct and her own advantag elizabeth jealousi wa
inde bitter as the grave
suddenli beatric ceas sob she lift her head and by a sudden
impuls threw out the passion of her heart with all her concentr
strength of mind toward the man she love murmur as she did so some
passion despair word which she knew
at thi moment geoffrei sleep soundli dream that he saw beatric
seat by her window and look at him with ey which no earthli
obstacl could blind she wa speak her lip move but though he
could hear no voic the word she spoke float into hi mind
be a god and hold me
with a charm
be a man and fold me
with thine arm

as i ought
i will speak thy speech love

i must buri sorrow
out of sight
must a littl weep love

and so fall asleep love

geoffrei heard them in hi heart then thei were gone the vision of
beatric wa gone and suddenli he awok
oh what wa thi flood of inarticul passionladen thought that beat
upon hi brain tell of beatric wave after wave it came utterli
overwhelm him like the heavi breath of flower stir by a night
windlik a messag from anoth world it wa real it wa no dream
no fanci she wa present with him though she wa not there her
thought mingl with hi thought her be beat upon hi own hi heart
throb hi limb trembl he strove to understand and could not but
in the mysteri of that dread communion the passion he had trodden down
and refus acknowledg took life and form within him it grew like
the indian magic tree from seed to blade from blade to bud and from
bud to bloom in that moment it becam clear to him he knew he love
her and know what such a love must mean for him if not for her
geoffrei sank back and groan
and beatric of a sudden she ceas speak to herself she felt
her thought flung back to her weight with anoth thought she had
broken through the barrier of earth the quick electr messag of her
heart had found a path to him she love and come back answer but in
what tongu wa that answer writ ala she could not read it ani more
than he could read the messag at first she doubt sure it wa
imagin then she rememb it wa absolut prove that peopl
dy could send a vision of themselv to other far awai and if that
could be why not thi no it wa truth a solemn truth she knew he
felt her thought she knew that hi life beat upon her life oh here
wa mysteri and here wa hope for if thi could be and it wa what
might not be if her blind strength of human love could so overstep the
boundari of human power and by the sheer might of it volit
mock the physic barrier that hem her in what had she to fear from
distanc from separ ay from death itself she had grasp a
clue which might on dai befor the seem end or afterwhat did it
matterlai strang secret open to her gaze she had heard a whisper
in an unknown tongu that could still be learn answer life
agon cry with a song of glori if onli he love her some dai all
would be well some dai the barrier would fall crumbl with the
flesh thei would fall and set her nake spirit free to seek it other
self and then have found her love what more wa there to seek what
other answer did she desir to all the problem of her life than thi of
uniti attain at lastun attain in death
and if he did not love her how could he answer her sure that messag
could not pass except along the golden chord of love which ever make
it sweetest music when pain strike it with a hand of fear
the troubl glori passedit throb itself awai the spiritu gust
of thought grew continu fainter till like the echo of a
dy harp like the breath of a fall gale thei slowli sank to
nothing then weari with an extrem of wild emot beatric
sought her bed again and present wa lost in sleep
when geoffrei woke on the next morn after a littl reflect he

chapter xvi
the flat near the edgwar road
geoffrei journei to town wa not altogeth a cheer on to begin
with effi wept copious at part with her belov aunti as she
call beatric and would not be comfort the prospect of rejoin
her mother and the volubl ann had no charm for effi thei all three
got on best apart geoffrei himself had also much to think about and
found littl satisfact in the think he threw hi mind back over
the event of the past few week he rememb how he had first seen
beatric face through the thick mist on the red rock and how her
beauti had struck him as no beauti ever had befor then he thought
of the adventur of their shipwreck and of the desper courag with
which she had save hi life almost at the cost of her own he thought
too of that scene when on the follow dai he had enter the room
where she wa asleep when the wander rai of light had waver from
her breast to hi own when that strang presenti of the ultim
intermingl of their live had flash upon him and when she had
awaken with an unearthli greet on her lip while effi slowli
sob herself to silenc in the corner opposit to him on by on he
recal everi phase and scene of their evergrow intimaci till the
review culmin in hi mysteri experi of the past night and
the memori of beatric part word
of all men geoffrei wa among those least inclin to ani sort of
superstit from boyhood he had been note for common sens and
a somewhat disbeliev turn of mind but he had intellect and
imagin which is simpli intellect etherealis without these with
hi peculiar mental constitut he would for instanc probabl have
been a religi sceptic have them he wa noth of the sort so
in thi matter of hi experi of the previou night and gener of
the strang and almost unnatur sympathi in which he found himself
with thi ladi common sens and the result of hi observ and
experi point to the whole thing be nonsenseth result of
propinqu sir propinqu and a pretti faceand noth more
but here hi intellect and hi imagin step in tell him
plainli that it wa not nonsens that he had not mere made a donkei
of himself over an hyster or possibl a lovesick girl thei told
him that becaus a thing is a mysteri it is not necessarili a folli
though mysteri ar for the most part dealt in by fool thei suggest
that there mai be mani thing and forc abov us and around us
invis as an electr current intang as light yet exist and
capabl of manifest under certain rare and favour condit
and wa it not possibl that such condit should unit in a woman
like beatric who combin in herself a beauti of bodi which wa onli
outpass by the beauti of her mind it wa no answer to sai that most
women could never inspir the unearthli passion with which he had been
shaken some ten hour past or that most men could never becom awar of
the inspir ha not human power and percept deni to the
cattl of the field and mai there not be men and women as far remov
from their fellow in thi respect as these ar from the cattl
but the weak point of mysteri occurr is that thei lead nowher
and do not materi alter the fact of life on cannot for instanc
plead a mysteri in a court of law so drop the imagin side of
the question as on beyond him geoffrei came to it practic aspect
onli to find it equal thorni
odd as it mai seem geoffrei did not to thi moment know the exact
posit which he occupi in the mind of beatric or that she occupi
in hi he wa not in love with her at least not in a wai in which he
had ever experienc the influenc of that on the whole inconveni
and disagre passion at ani rate he argu from the hypothesi that
he wa not in love with her thi he refus to admit now in the light
of dai though he had admit it fulli in the watch of the night it
would not do to admit it but he wa forc to acknowledg that she had
crept into hi life and possess it so complet that then and for
month afterward except in deep sleep or in hour of sever mental
strain not a singl half hour would pass without bring it thought
of beatric everyth that wa beauti or grand or elev
remind him of herand what higher compliment could a mistress have
if he listen to gloriou music the voic of beatric spoke to him
through the note if he watch the cloud roll in heavi pomp across
a broken sky he thought of beatric if some chanc poem or novel move
him why beatric wa in hi mind to share the pleasur all of which
wa veri interest and in some wai delight but under our current
system not otherwis than inconveni to a marri man
and now beatric wa gone and he must come back to hi daili toil
sweeten by honoria bitter complaint of their poverti and see her
no more the thought made geoffrei heart ach with a physic pain
but hi reason told him that it wa best so after all there were no
bone broken there had been no love scene no kiss no word that
cannot be recal whatev there wa lai beneath the surfac
and while appear were kept up all wa well no doubt it wa
an hypocrisi but then hypocrisi is on of the great pillar of
civil and how doe it matter what the heart sai while the lip
ar silent the record angel can alon read heart and he must often
find them singularli contradictori and untrustworthi write
die of them die of her dream no beatric would not die of them and
certainli he should not probabl in the end she would marri that piou
earthli lump owen davi it wa not pleasant to think of it wa even
dread but realli if she were to ask him hi opinion as a friend
he should tell her it wa the best thing that she could do of cours
it would be hypocrisi again the lip would give hi heart the lie but
when the heart rise in rebellion against the intellig it must be
suppress unfortun howev though a small member it is veri
strong
thei reach london at last and as had been arrang ann the french
bonn met them at the station to take effi home geoffrei notic
that she look smarter and less to hi tast than ever howev she
embrac effi with an enthusiasm which the child scarc respond
to and at the same time carri on an ocular flirtat with a ticket
collector although earli in the year for yellow fog london wa
plung in a dens gloom it had been misti that morn at bryngelli
and becom more and more so as the dai advanc but though it wa not
yet four oclock london wa dark as night luckili howev it is not
far from paddington to the flat near the edgwar road where geoffrei
live so have person instruct the cabman he left ann to
convoi effi and the luggag and went on to the templ by underground
railwai with an easi mind
shortli after geoffrei reach hi chamber in pump court the solicitor

unwellbut a partner to hi delight he then found that beatric
ghost theori wa perfectli accur the boi with the miss toejoint

be produc at the trialinde a proof of hi evid wa alreadi
forthcom also some specimen of the exlawy clerk handwrit
had been obtain and were declar by two expert to be ident with

to the effect that he hope mr bingham had made the most of such
unrival opportun ad with a deep sigh that no love young

the juri wa there if thi case wa not taken there wa no other with
which thei could go on c c
the court took the same view and lectur geoffrei sever everi
counsel in a case the court rememb when it wa at the bar us to
be abl to open that case at a moment notic and though thing had
it impli no doubt deterior to a consider extent sinc
those palmi dai everi counsel ought still to be prepar to do so on
emerg
of cours howev if he geoffrei told the court that he wa
absolut unprepar to go on with the case it would have no option
but to grant an adjourn
i am perfectli prepar to go on with it my lord geoffrei interpos
calmli
veri well said the court in a mollifi tone then go on i have no
doubt that the learn attorneygener will arriv present
then as is not unusu in a probat suit follow an argument as to
who should open it the plaintiff or the defend geoffrei claim
that thi right clearli lai with him and the oppos counsel rais no
great object think that thei would do well to leav the open
in the hand of a rather inexperienc man who would veri like
work hi side more harm than good so somewhat to the horror of
the solicitor who thought with long of the eloqu of the
attorneygener and the unrival experi and finess of mr
candleton geoffrei wa call upon to open the case for the defend
propound the first will
he rose without fear or hesit and with but on prayer in hi
heart that no untim attorneygener would put in an appear he
had got hi chanc the chanc for which mani abl men have to wait long
year and he knew it and meant to make the most of it natur
a brilliant speaker geoffrei wa not as so mani good speaker ar
subject to fit of nervous and he wa moreov thoroughli master
of hi case in five minut judg juri and counsel were all listen
to him with attent in ten thei were absorb in the lucid and
succinct statement of the fact which he wa unfold to them hi
ghost theori wa at first receiv with a smile but present counsel
on the other side ceas to smile and began to look uneasi if he could
prove what he said there wa an end of their case when he had been
speak for about forti minut on of the oppos counsel

ye mr bingham said hi lordship
then geoffrei went on with hi statement
at lunch time it wa a question whether anoth leader should be
brief geoffrei said that so far as he wa concern he could get on
alon he knew everi point of the case and he had got a friend to take
a note for him while he wa speak
after some hesit the solicitor decid not to brief fresh counsel
at thi stage of the case but to leav it entir in hi hand
it would be useless to follow the detail of thi remark will suit
which last two dai and attract much attent geoffrei won it and
won it triumphantli hi address to the juri on the whole case wa
long rememb in the court rise as it did to a veri high level of
forens eloqu few who saw it ever forgot the sight of hi handsom
face and command presenc as he crush the case of hi oppon
like an eggshel and then with calm and overwhelm forc denounc
the woman who with her lover had concoct the cruel plot that rob
her uncl of life and her cousin of their properti till at the last
point toward her with outstretch hand he brand her to the juri
as a murderess
few in that crowd court have forgotten the tragic scene that follow
when the trembl woman worn out by the long anxieti of the trial
and utterli unnerv by her accus brilliant invect rose from her
seat and cri
we did itit is true that we did it to get the monei but we did not
mean to frighten him to death and then fell faint to the groundor
geoffrei bingham quiet word as he sat down
my lord and gentlemen of the juri i do not think it necessari to carri
my case ani further
there wa no applaus the occas wa too dramat solemn but the
impress made both upon the court and the outsid public to whom such
a scene is peculiarli fit to appeal wa deep and last
geoffrei himself wa under littl delus about the matter he had no
conceit in hi composit but neither had he ani fals modesti he
mere accept the situat as realli power men do accept such
eventswith thank but without surpris he had got hi chanc
at last and like ani other abl man whatev hi walk of life he had
risen to it that wa all most men get such chanc in some shape or
form and ar unabl to avail themselv of them geoffrei wa on of
the except as beatric had said he wa born to succe as he sat
down he knew that he wa a made man
and yet while he walk home that night hi ear still full of the
congratul which had rain in on him from everi quarter he wa
consciou of a certain pride he will have felt as geoffrei felt that
night whose lot it ha been to fight long and strenuous against
circumst so advers as to be almost overwhelm know in hi
heart that he wa born to lead and not to follow and who at last by
on mental effort with no friendli hand to help and no friendli voic
to guid ha succeed in burst a road through the difficulti
which hem him in and ha suddenli found himself not abov
competit inde but still abl to meet it he will not have been
too proud of that endeavour it will have seem but a littl thing to
hima thing full of fault and imperfect and fall far short
of hi ideal he will not even have attach a great import to hi
success becaus if he is a person of thi calibr he must rememb
how small it is when all is said and done that even in hi dai there
ar those who can beat him on hi own ground and also that all worldli
success like the most perfect flower yet bear in it the element of
decai but he will have reflect with humbl satisfact on those long
year of patient strive which have at length lift him to an emin
whenc he can climb on and on scarc encumb by the jostl
crowd till at length worn out the time come for him to fall
so geoffrei thought and felt the thing wa to be done and he had done
it honoria should have monei now she should no longer be abl to twit
him with their poverti ye and a better thought still beatric would
be glad to hear of hi littl triumph
he reach home rather late honoria wa go out to dinner with a
distinguish cousin and wa alreadi dress geoffrei had declin
the invit which wa a short on becaus he had not expect to be
back from chamber in thi enthusiasm howev he went to hi wife
room to tell her of the event
well she said what have you been do i think that you might have
arrang to come out with me my go out so much by myself doe not
look well oh i forgot of cours you ar in that case
yesthat is i wa i have won the case here is a veri fair report of
it in the st jamess gazett if you care to read it
good heaven geoffrei how can you expect me to read all that stuff

i dont expect you to honoria onli as i sai i have won the case
and i shall get plenti of work now

mai miladi la robe va parfait
that is your opinion grumbl ladi honoria well it isnt mine but
it will have to do goodnight geoffrei i daresai that you will have
gone to bed when i get back and she wa gone
geoffrei pick up hi st jamess gazett with a sigh he felt
hurt and knew that he wa a fool for hi pain ladi honoria wa not a
sympathet person it wa not fair to expect it from her still he felt
hurt he went upstair and heard effi her prayer
where ha you beed daddyto the smoki town the templ wa
euphemist known to effi as the smoki town

suit the action to the word
geoffrei went from the littl room with a soften heart he dress and
at some dinner
then he sat down and wrote a long letter to beatric tell her all
about the trial and not spare her hi reason for adopt each
particular tactic and line of argument which conduc to the great
result
and though hi letter wa four sheet in length he knew that beatric
would not be bore at have to read it
chapter xviii
the rise star
as might be expect the memor case of parson and dous prove to
be the turn point in geoffrei career which wa thenceforward on
of brilliant and startl success on the veri next morn when he
reach hi chamber it wa to find three heavi brief await him and
thei prove to be but the herald of an uninterrupt flow of lucr
busi of cours he wa not a queen counsel but now that hi
great natur power of advocaci had becom gener known solicitor
frequent emploi him alon or gave him anoth junior so that he
might bring those power to bear upon juri now it wa too that
geoffrei reap the fruit of the arduou legal studi which he had
follow without cessat from the time when he found himself thrown
upon hi own resourc and which had made a sound lawyer of him as
well as a brilliant and effect advoc soon even with hi great
capac for work he had as much busi as he could attend to when
fortun give good gift she gener doe so with a lavish hand
thu it came to pass that about three week after the trial of parson
and dous geoffrei uncl the solicitor di and to hi surpris left
him twenti thousand pound believ he said in hi will which wa
date three dai befor the testat death that thi sum will assist
him to rise to the head of hi profess
now that it had dawn upon her that her husband realli wa a success
honoria manner toward him modifi veri consider she even becam
amiabl and onc or twice almost affection when geoffrei told her
of the twenti thousand pound she wa radiant
why we shall be abl to go back to bolton street now she said
and as luck will have it our old hous is to let i saw a bill in the
window yesterdai
ye he said you can go back as soon as you like
and can we keep a carriag
no not yet i am do well but not well enough for that next year
if i live you will be abl to have a carriag dont begin to grumbl
honoria i have got 150 to spare and if you care to come round to a
jewel you can spend it on what you like
oh you delight person said hi wife
so thei went to the jewel and ladi honoria bought ornament to
the valu of 150 and carri them home and hung over them as anoth
class of woman might hang over her firstborn child admir them with
a tender ecstasi whenev he had a sum of monei that he could afford
to part with geoffrei would take her thu to a jewel or a
dressmak and stand by coldli while she bought thing to it valu
ladi honoria wa delight it never enter into her mind that in a
sens he wa take a reveng upon her and that everi fresh exhibit
of her rejoic over the good thing thu provid ad to hi
contempt for her
those were happi dai for ladi honoria she rejoic in thi return of
wealth like a schoolboi at the come of the holidai or a halffrozen
wander at the rise of the sun she had been miser dure all
thi night of poverti as miser as her natur admit of now
she wa happi again as she understood happi for bred educ
civilizedwhat you willout of the more human passion ladi honoria
had replac them by thi idolworship of wealth or rather of what
wealth bring it gave her a posit physic satisfact her
beauti which had begun to fade came back to her she look five year
younger and all the while geoffrei watch her with an evergrow
scorn
onc it broke out the bolton street hous had been furnish he gave
her fifteen hundr pound to do it and with what thing thei own
she manag veri well on that thei move into it and honoria had set
herself up with a suffici suppli of grand dress and jewelleri
suitabl to her recov posit on dai howev it occur to her
that effi wa a child of remark beauti who if properli dress
would look veri nice in the drawingroom at teatim so she order a
love costum for herthi depon is not abl to describ it but
it consist larg of velvet and lace geoffrei heard noth of thi
dress but come home rather earli on afternoonit wa on a saturdai
he found the child be shown off to a room full of visitor and
dress in a strang and wonder attir with which not unnatur
she wa vastli pleas he said noth at the time but when at length
the drop fire of caller had ceas he ask who put effi into
that dress
i did said ladi honoria and a pretti penni it ha cost i can tell
you but i cant have the child come down so poorli cloth it doe not
look well
then she can stai upstair said geoffrei frown
what do you mean ask hi wife
i mean that i will not have her deck out in those fine cloth thei
ar quit unsuit to her ag there is plenti of time for her to take
to vaniti
i realli dont understand you geoffrei why should not the child be
handsom dress
why not great heaven honoria do you suppos that i want to see effi
grow up like you to lead a life of empti pleasureseek idl and
make a god of luxuri i had rather see herh wa go to add dead
first but check himself and saidhav to work for her live
dress yourself up as much as you like but leav the child alon
ladi honoria wa furiou but she wa also a littl frighten she
had never heard her husband speak quit like thi befor and there wa
someth underneath hi word that she did not quit understand still
less did she understand when on the mondai geoffrei suddenli told her
that he had fifti pound for her to spend as she like then accompani
her to a mantl shop and stood patient by smile coldli while she
invest it in lace and embroideri honoria thought that he wa make
repar for hi sharp word and so he wa but to himself and in
anoth sens everi time he gave her monei in thi fashion geoffrei
felt like a man who ha paid off a debt of honour she had taunt
him again and again with her povertyth poverti she said that he had
brought her for everi taunt he would heap upon her all those thing in
which her soul delight he would glut her with wealth as in her hour
of victori queen tomyri glut dead cyru with the blood of men
it wa an odd wai of take a reveng and on that suit ladi honoria
admir but though it victim felt no sting it gave geoffrei much
secret relief also he wa curiou he wish to see if there wa
ani bottom to such a woman desir for luxuri if it would not bring
satieti with it but ladi honoria wa a veri bad subject for such an
experi she never show the least sign of be satiat either
with fine thing with pleasur or with social delight thei were her
natur element and he might as soon have expect a fish to weari of
the water or an eagl of the rush air
the winter wore awai and the spring came on dai it wa in april
geoffrei who wa a moder liber by persuas casual announc
at dinner that he wa go to stand for parliament in the unionist
interest the represent of on of the few metropolitan divis
which had then return a home ruler had fallen vacant as it chanc he
knew the head unionist whip veri well thei had been friend sinc thei
were lad at school togeth and thi gentleman have heard geoffrei
make a brilliant speech in court wa suddenli struck with the idea that
he wa the veri man to lead a forlorn hope
the upshot of it wa that geoffrei wa ask if he would stand and
repli that he must have two dai to think it over what he realli
want the two dai for wa to enabl him to write to beatric and
receiv an answer from her he had an almost superstiti faith in her
judgment and did not like to act without it after carefulli weigh
the pro and con hi own view wa that he should do well to stand
probabl he would be defeat and it might cost him five hundr
pound on the other hand it would certainli make hi name known as a
politician and he wa now in a fair wai to earn so larg an incom that
he could well afford to risk the monei the onli great object which
he saw wa that if he happen to get in it must mean that he would
have to work all dai and all night too well he wa strong and the more
work he did the betterit kept him from think
in due cours beatric answer came her view coincid with hi own
she recommend him to take the opportun and point out that with
hi grow legal reput there wa no offic in the state to which
he might not aspir when he had onc prove himself a capabl member of
parliament geoffrei read the letter through then immedi sat
down and wrote to hi friend the whip accept the suggest of the
govern
the next fortnight wa a hard on for him but geoffrei wa as good a
man on the platform as in court and he had moreov the veri valuabl
knack of suit himself to hi audienc as hi canvass went on it wa
gener recognis that the seat which had been consid hopeless
wa now doubt a great amount of public interest wa concentr
on the elect both upon the unionist and the separatist side each
claim that the result of the poll would show to their advantag the
home rule parti strain everi nerv against him be most anxiou to
show that the free and independ elector of thi singl divis
and therefor of the countri at larg held the govern polici in
particular horror letter were obtain from great author and
freeli print irish member fresh from gaol were brought down to
detail their grievanc it wa even suggest that on of them should
appear on the platform in prison garbin short everi election
engin known to polit scienc wa brought to bear to forward the
fortun of either side
as time went on ladi honoria who had been somewhat indiffer at
first grew quit excit about the result for on thing she found that
the contest attach an import to herself in the ey of the truli
great which wa not without it charm on the dai of the poll she drove
about all dai in an open carriag under a bright blue parasol have
effi who had becom veri bore by her side and two nobl lord on
the front seat as a consequ the result wa univers declar by
a certain section of the press to be entir due to the effort of an
unprincipl but titl and love woman it wa even said that like
anoth ladi of rank in a past gener she kiss a butcher in
order to win hi vote but those who made the remark did not know ladi
honoria she wa incap of kiss a butcher or inde anybodi els
her inclin did not lie in that direct
in the end geoffrei wa return by a magnific major of ten vote
reduc on a scrutini to seven he took hi seat in the hous on the
follow night amidst loud unionist cheer in the cours of the
even debat a promin member of the govern made allus to
hi return as a proof of the triumph of unionist principl thereon a
veri lead member of the separatist opposit retort that it wa
noth of the sort that it wa a matter of common notorieti that the
honour member return wa ow to the unusu and most uncommon
abil displai by him in the cours of hi canvass aid as it wa
by artfulli appli and aristocrat feminin influenc thi wa a
delic allus to honoria and her blue parasol
as geoffrei and hi wife were drive back to bolton street after the
declar of the poll a littl incid occur geoffrei told the
coachman to stop at the first telegraph offic and get out of the
carriag wire to beatric in by ten vote
who have you been telegraph to geoffrei ask ladi honoria
i telegraph to miss granger he answer
ah so you still keep up a correspond with that pupil teacher
girl
ye i do i wish that i had a few more such correspond
inde you ar easi to pleas i thought her on of the most
disagre young women whom i ever met
then it doe not sai much for your tast honoria
hi wife made no further remark but she had her thought honoria
possess good point among other she wa not a jealou person she
wa too cold and too indiffer to be jealou but she did not like the
idea of anoth woman obtain an influenc over her husband who as
she now began to recognis wa on of the most brilliant men of hi
dai and who might well becom on of the most wealthi and power
clearli he exist for her benefit not for that of ani other woman
she wa no fool and she saw that a consider intimaci must
exist between the two otherwis geoffrei would not have thought of
telegraph to beatric at such a moment
within a week of hi elect geoffrei made a speech it wa not a long
speech nor wa it upon ani veri import issu but it wa exceedingli
good of it kind good enough to be report verbatim inde and those
listen to it recognis that thei had to deal with a new man who
would on dai be a veri big man there is no place where an abl person
find hi level quicker than in the hous of common compos as it is
for the most part of more or less wealthi or frantic mediocr but
geoffrei wa not a mediocr he wa an exceedingli abl and power
man and thi fact the hous quickli recognis
for the next few month geoffrei work as men rare work all dai
he wa at hi chamber or in court and at night he sat in the hous
get up hi brief when he could but he alwai did get them up
no solicitor had to complain that the interest of their client were
neglect by him also he still found time to write to beatric for
the rest he went out but littl and except in the wai of busi
associ with veri few inde he grew more and more silent and
reserv till at last he won the reput of be cold and hard not
that he wa realli so he threw himself head and soul into hi work
with a fix determin to reach the top of the tree he knew that he
should not care veri much about it when he got there but he enjoi the
struggl
geoffrei wa not a truli ambiti man he wa no mere selfseek
he knew the folli of ambit too well and it end wa alwai clearli
befor hi ey he often thought to himself that if he could have
chosen hi lot he would have ask for a cottag with a good garden
five hundr a year and somebodi to care for but perhap he would soon
have weari of hi cottag he work to stifl thought and to some
extent he succeed but he wa at bottom an affectionatenatur man
and he could not stifl the long for sympathi which wa hi secret
weak though hi pride would never allow him to show it what did he
care for hi triumph when he had nobodi with whom to share them all he
could share were their fruit and these he gave awai freeli enough it
wa but littl that geoffrei spent upon hi own gratif a certain
share of hi gain he put by the rest went in expens the hous in
bolton street wa a veri gai place in those dai but it master took
but littl part in it gaieti
and what wa the fact the longer he remain separ from beatric
the more intens did he long for her societi it wa of no us try as
he would he could not put that sweet face from hi mind it drew him as
a magnet draw a needl success did not bring him happi except in
the sens that it reliev him from monei care
peopl of coars tempera onli can find real satisfact in worldli
triumph and eat drink and be merri for tomorrow thei die men like
geoffrei soon learn that thi also is vaniti on the contrari as hi
mind grew more and more weari with the strain of work melancholi took
an ever stronger hold of it had he gone to a doctor he might have been
told that hi liver wa out of order which wa veri like true but
thi would not mend matter what a world he might have cri what
a world to live in when all the man happi depend upon hi liver
he contract an accurs habit of look on the black side of thing
troubl alwai caught hi ey
it wa no wonder case men of larg mind ar veri rare happi men
it is your littl animalmind individu who can be happi thu women
who reflect less ar as a class much happier and more content than
men but the largemind man see too far and guess too much of
what he cannot see he look forward and note the dusti end of hi
labori dai he look around and shudder at the unceas miseri of
a coars struggl world the sight of the piti beggar babe crave
bread on totter feet pierc hi heart he cannot consol himself
with a reflect that the child had no busi to be born or that if
he denud himself of hi last pound he would not materi help the
class which bred it
and abov the garish light of earthli joi and the dim reek of earthli
wretched he see the solemn firmament that veil hi race
destini for such a man in such a mood even religion ha terror as
well as hope and while the gloom gather about hi mind these ar
with him more and more what li beyond that arch mysteri to whose
horizon he daili draw more closewhos door mai even now be open
for him a hundr hand point out a hundr road to knowledgethei
ar lost half wai onli the cold spiritu firmament unlit by ani
guid star unbrighten by the flood of human dai and unshadow
by the veil of human night still bend abov hi head in aw
changeless and still hi weari feet draw closer to the portal of
the west
it is veri sad and wrong but it is not altogeth hi fault it is
rather a fault of the ag of overeduc of overstriv to be
wise cultiv the search spirit and it will grow and rend you the
spirit would soar it would see but the flesh weigh it down and
in all flesh there is littl light yet at time brood on some
unnatur height of thought it ey seem to be open and it catch
gleam of terrifi dai to come or perchanc discern the hopeless
gate of an immeasur night
oh for that simpler faith which ever reced farther from the ken of
the cultiv question mind there alon can peac be found and
for the foolish who discard it set up man wisdom at a sign soon
the human lot will be on long fear grown scientif and weari with
the weight of knowledg thei will reject their ancient god and no
smugfac positiv will bring them consol scienc here and
there illumin the gloom of destini with it poor electr light
cri out that thei ar guid star but thei ar no star and thei
will flare awai let us prai for dark more dark lest to our
bewild sight thei do but serv to show that which shall murder
hope
so think geoffrei and hi kin and in their unexpress dismai turn
seek refug from their physic and spiritu loneli but for the
most part find none natur still strong in them point to the dear
fellowship of woman and thei make the ventur to find a mate not
a companion but as it chanc in geoffrei case he did find such a
companion in beatric after he had by marriag built up an impass
wall between them
and yet he long for her societi with an intens that alarm him
he had her letter inde but what ar letter on touch of a belov
hand is worth a thousand letter in the midst of hi great success
geoffrei wa wretch at heart yet it seem to him that if he onc
more could have beatric at hi side though onli as a friend he would
find rest and happi
when a man heart is thu set upon an object hi reason is soon
convinc of it innoc even of it desir and a kindli fate
will gener contriv to give him the opportun of ruin which he so
ardent desir
chapter xix
geoffrei ha a visitor
and beatricehad she fare better dure these long month ala not
at all she had gone awai from the bryngelli station on that autumn
morn of farewel sick at heart and sick at heart she had remain
through all the long winter month sorrow and bitter had been her
portion and now in the happi of spring sorrow and bitter were
with her still she love him she long for hi presenc and it wa
deni to her she could not consol herself as can some women nor
did her deep passion wear awai on the contrari it seem to grow and
gather with everi pass week neither did she wish to lose it
she love too well for that it wa better to be thu torment by
conscienc and by hopeless than to lose her caus of pain
on consol beatric had and on onli she knew that geoffrei did
not forget her hi letter told her thi these letter inde were
everyth to hera woman can get so much more comfort out of a letter
than a man next to receiv them she love to answer them she wa a
good and even a brilliant letter writer but often and often she would
tear up what she had written and begin again there wa not much new
in bryngelli it wa difficult to make her letter amus also the
farcic natur of the whole proceed seem to paralys her it wa
ridicul have so much to sai to be abl to sai noth not that
beatric wish to indit loveletterssuch an idea had never cross
her mind but rather to write as thei had talk yet when she tri to
do so the result were not satisfactori to her the word look strang
on papersh could not send them
in geoffrei meteorlik advanc to fame and fortun she took the
keenest joi and interest far more than he did inde though like that
of most other intellig creatur her soul turn with loath
from the dreari fustian of polit she would religi search the
parliamentari column from begin to end on the chanc of find hi
name or the notic of a speech by him the law report also furnish
her with a happi huntingground in which she often found her game
but thei were miser month to rise in the morn to go through
the round of daili dutythink of geoffrei to come home weari and
final to seek refug in sleep and dream of himthi wa the sum of
them then there were other troubl to begin with thing had gone
from bad to wors at the vicarag the tith scarc came in at all
and everi dai their poverti pinch them closer had it not been for
beatric salari it wa difficult to see how the famili could have
continu to exist she gave it almost all to her father now onli
keep back a veri small sum for her necessari cloth and such
sundri as stamp and write paper even then elizabeth grumbl
bitterli at her extravag in continu to bui a daili paper ask
what busi she had to spend sixpenc a week on such a needless
luxuri but beatric would not make up her mind to dock the paper with
it occasion mention of geoffrei
again owen davi wa a perpetu anxieti to her hi infatu for
herself wa becom notori everybodi saw it except her father mr
granger mind wa so occupi with question connect with tith that
fortun for beatric littl els could find an entri owen dog
her about he would wait whole hour outsid the school or by the
vicarag gate mere to speak a few word to her sometim when at
length she appear he seem to be struck dumb he could sai noth
but would gaze at her with hi dull ey in a fashion that fill her
with vagu alarm he never ventur to speak to her of hi love inde
but he look it which wa almost as bad anoth thing wa that he
had grown jealou the seed which elizabeth had plant in hi mind had
brought forth abundantli though of cours beatric did not know that
thi wa her sister do
on the veri morn that geoffrei went awai mr davi had met her as
she wa walk back from the station and ask her if mr bingham had
gone when she repli that thi wa so she had distinctli heard him
murmur thank god thank god subsequ she discov also that he
bribe the old postman to keep count of the letter which she sent and
receiv from geoffrei
these thing fill beatric with alarm but there wa wors behind mr
davi began to send her present first such thing as prize pigeon
and fowl then jewelleri the pigeon and fowl she could not well
return without excit remark but the jewelleri she sent back by on
of the school children first came a bracelet then a locket with hi
photograph insid and lastli a case that when she open it which
her curios led her to do nearli blind her with light it wa a
diamond necklac and she had never seen such diamond befor but from
their size and lustr she knew that each stone must be worth hundr of
pound beatric put it in her pocket and carri it until she met him
which she did in the cours of that afternoon
mr davi she said befor he could speak and hand him the
packag thi ha been sent to me by mistak will you kindli take it
back
he took it abash
mr davi she went on look him full in the ey i hope that
there will be no more such mistak pleas understand that i cannot
accept present from you
if mr bingham had sent it you would have accept it he mutter
sulkili
beatric turn and flash such a look on him that he fell back and
left her but it wa true and she knew that it wa true if geoffrei
had given her a sixpenc with a hole in it she would have valu it
more than all the diamond on earth oh what a posit wa her
and it wa wrong too she had no right to love the husband of anoth
woman but right or wrong the fact remain she did love him
and the worst of it wa that as she well knew sooner or later all
thi about mr davi must come to the ear of her father and then what
would happen on thing wa certain in hi present povertystricken
condit he would move heaven and earth to bring about her marriag to
thi rich man her father never had been veri scrupul where monei wa
concern and the pinch of want wa not like to make him more so
nor we mai be sure did all thi escap the jealou ey of elizabeth
thing look black for her but she did not intend to throw up the
card on that account onli it wa time to lead trump in other word
beatric must be fatal compromis in the ey of owen davi if by
ani mean thi could be brought about so far thing had gone well for
her scheme beatric and geoffrei love each other of that elizabeth
wa certain but the exist of thi secret underhand affect would
avail her naught unless it could be ripen into act everybodi is free
to indulg in secret predilect but if onc thei ar given wai to
if onc a woman charact is compromis then the world avail itself
of it opportun and destroi her what man thought elizabeth
would marri a compromis woman if beatric could be compromis owen
davi would not take her to wifetherefor thi must be brought about
it sound wick and unnatur imposs that sister should so treat
sister the reader of thi histori mai sai think of her own and of
her affection and respect surround but it is not imposs
if you who doubt will studi the law report and no wors occup
can be wish to you you will find that such thing ar possibl
human natur can rise to strang height and it can also fall to depth
beyond your fathom becaus a thing is without parallel in your own
small experi it in no wai follow that it cannot be
elizabeth wa a veri remorseless person she wa moresh wa a woman
actuat by passion and by greed the two strongest motiv known to the
human heart but with her reckless she unit a consider degre
of intellig or rather of intellect had she been a savag she might
have remov her sister from her path by a more expediti wai be
what she wa she mere strove to effect the same end by a method not
punish by law in short by murder her reput would she be
respons if her sister went wrong and wa thu utterli discredit
in the ey of thi man who wish to marri her and whom elizabeth
wish to marri of cours not that wa beatric affair but she
could give her everi chanc of fall into temptat and thi it wa
her fix design to do
circumst soon gave her an opportun the need of monei becam
veri press at the vicarag thei had liter no longer the
wherewith to live the tith payer absolut refus to fulfil
their oblig as it happen jone the man who had murder the
auction wa never brought to trial he di shortli after hi arrest
in a fit of delirium tremen and nervou prostrat brought on by
the sudden cessat of a suppli of stimul and an exampl wa lost
that had he been duli hang might have been made of the result of
defi the law mr granger wa now too poor to institut ani further
proceed which in the state of public feel in wale might or
might not succe he could onli submit and submiss meant beggari
inde he wa alreadi a beggar in thi state of affair he took counsel
with elizabeth point out that thei must either get monei or starv
now the onli possibl wai to get monei wa by borrow it and mr
granger suggest wa that he should appli to owen davi who had
plenti inde he would have done so long ago but that the squir had
the reput of be an exceedingli closefist man
but thi proposit did not at all suit elizabeth book her great
object had been to conceal mr daviess desir as regard beatric from
her father and her daili dread wa that he might becom acquaint with
them from some outsid sourc she knew veri well that if her father
went up to the castl to borrow monei it would be lent or rather given
freeli enough but she also knew that the lender would almost certainli
take the opportun the veri favour opportun to unfold hi
wish as regard the borrow daughter the on thing would natur
lead to the otherth promis of her father support of owen suit
would be the consider for the monei receiv how gladli that
support would be given wa also obviou to her and with her father
push beatric on the on side and owen davi push her on the
other how could elizabeth be sure that she would not yield beatric
would be the veri person to be carri awai by an idea of duti their
father would tell her that he had got the monei on thi undertak and
it wa quit possibl that her pride might bring her to fulfil a bond
thu given howev distast the deed might be to her person no
her father must at all hazard be prevent from seek assist from
owen davi and yet the monei must be had from somewher or thei would
be ruin
ah she had itgeoffrei bingham should lend the monei he could well
afford it now and she shrewdli guess that he would not grudg the
coat off hi back if he thought that by give it he might directli or
indirectli help beatric her father must go up to town to see him she
would have no letterwrit on never know how a letter mai be read
he must see mr bingham and if possibl bring him down to bryngelli in
a moment everi detail of the plot becam clear to elizabeth mind and
then she spoke
you must not go to mr davi father she said he is a hard man
and would onli refus and put you in a fals posit you must go to
mr bingham listen he is rich now and he is veri fond of you and
of beatric he will lend you a hundr pound at onc you must go to
london by the earli train tomorrow and drive straight to hi chamber
and see him it will cost two pound to get there and back but that
cannot be help it is safer than write and i am sure that you will
not go for noth and see here father bring mr bingham back with
you for a few dai if you can it will be a littl return for hi
kind and i know that he is not well beatric had a letter from him
in which he said that he wa so overwork that he thought he must take
a littl rest soon bring him back for whitsundai
mr granger hesit demur and final yield the weak
querul old farmer clergyman worn out with mani daili care and quit
unsupport by mental resourc wa but a tool in elizabeth abl
hand he did not inde feel ani humili at the idea of try
to borrow the cash for hi natur wa not fine strung and monei
troubl had made him callou to the verg of unscrupul but he
did not like the idea of a journei to london where he had not been for
more than twenti year and the expenditur that it entail still he
act as elizabeth bade him even to keep the expedit secret
from beatric beatric as her sister explain to him wa proud as
lucif and might rais object if she knew that he wa go to
london to borrow monei of mr bingham thi inde she would certainli
have done
on the follow afternoonit wa the fridai befor whitsundai and
the last dai of the easter sittingsgeoffrei sat in hi chamber in
the worst possibl spirit thoroughli stale and worn out with work
there wa a consult go on and hi client a pighead norfolk
farmer who wa bent upon proceed to trial with some extraordinari
action for trespass against hi own landlord wa present with hi
solicitor geoffrei in a few short clear word had explain the
absurd of the whole thing and strongli advis him to settl for
the client had insist on see him refus to be put off with a
written opinion but the farmer wa not satisfi and the solicitor wa
now endeavour to let the pure light of law into the dark of hi
injur soul
geoffrei threw himself back in hi chair push the dark hair from hi
brow and pretend to listen but in a minut hi mind wa far
awai heaven how tire he wa well there would be rest for a few
daystil tuesdai when he had a matter that must be attend toth
hous had risen and so had the court what should he do with himself
honoria wish to go and stai with her brother lord garsington
and for a wonder to take effi with her he did not like it but he
suppos that he should have to consent on thing wa he would not
go he could not endur garsington dunstan and all their set should
he run down to bryngelli the temptat wa veri great that would be
happi inde but hi common sens prevail against it no it wa
better that he should not go there he would leav bryngelli alon if
beatric wish him to come she would have said so and she had never
even hint at such a thing and if she had he did not think that he
would have gone but he lack the heart to go anywher els he would
stop in town rest and read a novel for geoffrei when he found
time wa not abov thi frivol occup possibl under certain
circumst he might even have been capabl of write on at that
moment hi clerk enter and hand him a slip of paper with someth
written on it he open it idli and read
revd mr granger to see you told him you were engag but he said he
would wait
geoffrei start violent so violent that both the solicitor and the
obstin farmer look up
tell the gentleman that i will see him in a minut he said to the
retreat clerk and then address the farmer well sir i have
said all that i have to sai i cannot advis you to continu thi
action inde if you wish to do so you must realli direct your
solicitor to retain some other counsel as i will not be a parti to what
can onli mean a wast of monei good afternoon and he rose
the farmer wa convoi out grumbl in anoth moment mr granger
enter dress in a somewhat threadbar suit of black and hi thin
white hair hang as usual over hi ey geoffrei glanc at him
with apprehens and as he did so notic that he had ag greatli

mr granger woke up at onc befor he had been talk almost at
random the subject of hi daughter did not greatli interest him what

the poor narrowmind old man had thought about monei till he could
scarc find room for anyth els inde noth els realli touch

a paper from hi breast pocket with shake finger point out to
geoffrei how that hi cleric incom for the last six month had been

clergyman could not consid himself pass rich geoffrei listen and

chapter xx
back at bryngelli
geoffrei and mr granger reach bolton street about six oclock
the drawingroom wa still full of caller ladi honoria young men
muster in great forc in those dai thei were veri inoffens young
men and geoffrei had no particular object to them onli he found
it difficult to rememb all their name when geoffrei enter the
drawingroom there were no fewer than five of them to sai noth of
two strai ladi all superbl dress and sit metaphor at
honoria veri pretti feet otherwis their contribut to the gener
store of amus did not amount to much for her ladyship did most of
the talk
geoffrei introduc mr granger whom honoria could not at first
rememb nor did she receiv the announc that he wa go to dine
and stai the night with ani particular enthusiasm the young men melt
awai at geoffrei advent like mist befor a rise sun he greet
them civilli enough but with him thei had noth in common to tell
the truth thei were a littl afraid of him thi man with hi dark
handsom face seal with the stamp of intellect hi powerfullook
form ill dress accord to their standard and hi great and
grow reput wa a person with whom thei had no sympathi and
who thei felt had no sympathi with them we talk as though there is
on heaven and on hell for all of us but here must be some mistak an
impass gulf yawn between the differ class of mankind what ha
such a man as geoffrei to do with the feebl male and femal butterfli
of a london drawingroom there is onli on link between them thei live
on the same planet
when the fine young men and the two strai ladi had melt awai
geoffrei took mr granger up to hi room come downstair again he
found ladi honoria wait for him in the studi
is that individu realli go to dine and sleep here she ask
certainli honoria and he ha brought no dress cloth he answer
realli geoffrei it is too bad of you said the ladi with some
pardon irrit why do you bring peopl to dinner in thi
promiscu wai it will quit upset the tabl just fanci ask an old
welsh clergyman to dine who ha not the slightest pretens to be
a gentleman when on ha the prime minist and a bishop comingand a
clergyman without dress cloth too what ha he come for
he came to see me on busi and as to the peopl come to dinner
if thei dont like it thei can grumbl when thei go home by the wai
honoria i am go down to wale for a dai or two tomorrow i want a
chang
inde go to see the love beatric i suppos you had better be
care geoffrei that girl will get you into a mess and if she doe
there ar plenti of peopl who ar readi to make an exampl of you you
have enemi enough i can tell you i am not jealou it is not in my
line but you ar too intim with that girl and you will be sorri for
it on dai
nonsens said geoffrei angrili but nevertheless he felt that ladi
honoria word were word of truth it struck him moreov that she
must feel thi strongli or she would not have spoken in that tone
honoria did not pose as a household philosoph still he would not draw
back now hi heart wa set on see beatric
am i to understand went on hi wife that you still object to my
stai with the garsington i think it is a littl hard if i do not
make a fuss about your go to see your villag paragon that you
should refus to allow me to visit my own brother
geoffrei felt that he wa be bargain with it wa degrad but in
the extrem of hi folli he yield
go if you like he said shortli but if you take effi mind she is
properli look after that is all and he abruptli left the room
ladi honoria look after him slowli nod her handsom head ah
she said to herself i have found out how to manag you now you
have your weak point like other peopl master geoffreyand it spell
beatric onli you must not go too far i am not jealou but i am not
go to have a scandal for fifti beatric i will not allow you to
lose your reput and posit just imagin a man like that pine
for a villag girlsh is noth more and thei talk about hi be
so clever well he alwai like ladi societi that is hi fail
and now he ha burnt hi finger thei all do sooner or later
especi these clever men the women flatter them that it of
cours the girl is try to get hold of him and she might do wors
but so sure as my name is honoria bingham i will put a spoke in her
wheel befor she ha done bah and thei laugh at the power of women
when a man like geoffrei with all the world to lose grow lovesick
for a pretti face it is a veri pretti face by the wai i do believ
that if i were out of the wai he would marri her but i am in the wai
and mean to stai there well it is time to dress for dinner i onli
hope that old clown of a clergyman wont do someth ridicul i
shall have to apologis for him
dinnertim had come it wa a quarter past eight and the room wa
fill with highli bred peopl all more or less distinguish mr
granger had duli appear arrai in hi threadbar black coat
reliev howev by a pair of geoffrei dress shoe as might have
been expect the great folk did not seem surpris at hi presenc
or to take ani particular notic of hi attir the fact be that such
peopl never ar surpris a zulu chief in full war dress would onli
excit a friendli interest in their breast on the contrari thei
recognis vagu that the old gentleman wa someth out of the
common run and as such worth cultiv inde the prime minist
hear casual that he wa a clergyman from wale ask to be
introduc to him and at onc fell into convers about tith a
subject of which mr granger wa thoroughli master
present thei went down to dinner mr granger escort the wife
of the bishop a fat and somewhat apoplect ladi bless with an
excel appetit on hi other side wa the prime minist and
between the two he got on veri well especi after a few glass of
wine inde both the apoplect wife of the bishop and the head of her
majesti govern were subsequ heard to declar that mr granger
wa a veri entertain person to the former he relat with much
detail how hi daughter had save their host life and to the latter
he discours upon the subject of tith favour him with hi idea
of what legisl wa necessari to meet the question somewhat to hi
own surpris he found that hi view were receiv with attent and
even with respect in the main too thei receiv the support of the
bishop who likewis felt keenli on the subject of tith never befor
had mr granger had such a good dinner nor mingl with compani so
distinguish he rememb both till hi dy dai
next morn geoffrei and mr granger start befor ladi honoria
wa up into the detail of their long journei to wale in a crowd
thirdclass carriag we need not enter geoffrei had plenti to think
of but hi fear had vanish as fear sometim do when we draw near
to the object of them and had been replac by a curiou expect he
saw now or thought he saw that he had been make a mountain out of
a molehil probabl it meant noth at all there wa no real danger
beatric like him no doubt possibl she had even experienc a fit of
tender toward him such thing come and such thing go time is a
wonder healer of moral distemp and few young ladi endur the
chain of an undesir attach for a period of seven whole month
it made him almost blush to think that thi might be so and that the
gratuit extens of hi misfortun to beatric might be noth more
than the work of hi own unconsci vanitya vaniti which did she
know of it would move her to angri laughter
he rememb how onc when he wa quit a young fellow he had been
somewhat smitten with a certain ladi who certainli if he might judg
from her word and act reciproc the sentiment and he rememb
also how when he met that ladi some month afterward she treat him
with a cold indiffer inde almost with an insol that quit
bewild him make him wonder how the same person could show in such
differ light till at length mortifi and asham by hi mistak
he had gone awai in a rage and seen her face no more of cours he had
set it down to femal infidel he had serv her turn she had made
a fool of him and that wa all she want now he might enjoi
hi humili it did not occur to him that it might be simpl
cussed to borrow an energet american term or that she had not
realli chang but wa angri with him for some reason which she did
not choos to show it is difficult to weigh the motiv of women in the
scale of male experi and mani other men besid geoffrei have
been forc to give up the attempt and to consol themselv with the
reflect that the inexplic is gener not worth understand
ye probabl it would be the same case over again and yet and
yetwa beatric of that class had she not too much of a man
straightforward of aim to permit her to plai such trick in the
bottom of hi soul he thought that she had but he would not admit it
to himself the fact of the matter wa that half unknowingli he wa
try to drug hi conscienc he knew that in hi long to see her
dear face onc more he had undertaken a danger thing he wa about to
walk with her over an abyss on a bridg which might bear them ormight
break so long as he walk there alon it would be well but would it
bear them both ala for the frailti of human natur thi wa the
truth but he would not and did not acknowledg it he wa not go
to make love to beatric he wa go to enjoi the pleasur of her
societi in friendship there could be no harm
it is not difficult thu to still the qualm of an uneasi mind more
especi when the thing in question at it worst is rather an offenc
against local custom than against natur law in mani countri of the
worldin nearli all countri inde at differ epoch of their
historyit would have been no wrong that geoffrei and beatric should
love each other and human natur in strong temptat is veri apt to
overrid artifici barrier erect to suit the conveni or promot
the prosper of particular section of mankind but as we have heard
even though all thing mai be law yet all thing ar not expedi
to commit or even to condon an act becaus the principl that stamp it
as wrong will admit of argument on it merit is mere sophistri by the
aid of which we might prove ourselv entitl to defi the major
of law of all calibr law vari to suit the gener but each
gener must obei it own or confus will ensu a deed should
be judg by it fruit it mai even be innoc in itself yet if it
fruit ar evil the doer in a sens is guilti
thu in some countri to mention the name of your motherinlaw entail
the most unpleas consequ on that intim relat nobodi can
sai that to name the ladi is a thing wick in itself yet the man who
know the penalti which will ensu allow himself even in a fit of
passion against that rel to violat the custom and mention her by
name is doubtless an offend thu too the result of an entangl
between a woman and a man alreadi marri gener mean unhappi
and hurt to all concern more especi to the women whose prospect
ar perhap irretriev injur therebi it is useless to point to
the exampl of the patriarch some foreign royal famili and mani
respect turk it is useless to plead that the love is deep and
holi love for which a man or woman might well live and die or to show
extenu circumst in the fact of loneli need of sympathi
and that the exist marriag is a hollow sham the rule is clear a
man mai do most thing except cheat at card or run awai in action a
woman mai break halfadozen heart or try to break them and final
put herself up at auction and take no harm at allbut neither of them
mai in ani event do thi
not that geoffrei to do him justic had ani such intent most
men ar incap of plot of that natur if thei fall it is when the
voic of conscienc is lost in the whirlwind of passion and counsel
is darken by the tumultu plead of the heart their sin is
that thei will most of them allow themselv to be put in posit
favour to the develop of these disagre influenc it is
not safe to light cigarett in a powder factori if geoffrei had done
what he ought to have done he would never have gone to bryngelli and
there would have been no stori to tell or no more than there usual
is
at length mr granger and hi guest reach bryngelli there wa nobodi
to meet them for nobodi knew that thei were come so thei walk up
to the vicarag it wa strang to geoffrei onc more to pass by the
littl church through those wellrememb windtorn pine and see
that low long hous it seem wonder that all should still be just
as it wa that there should be no chang at all when he himself had
seen so much there wa beatric home where wa beatric
he pass into the hous like a man in a dream in anoth moment he
wa in the long parlour where he had spent so mani happi hour and
elizabeth wa greet him he shook hand with her and as he did so
notic vagu that she too wa utterli unchang her strawcolour
hair wa push back from the templ in the same wai the mouth wore
the same hard smile her light ey shone with the same cold look she
even wore the same brown dress but she appear to be veri pleas to

father kiss her hurriedli and bustl from the room to lock up hi

unchang at bryngelli

geoffrei hung about a littl then he lit hi pipe and stroll down to
the beach with a vagu unexpress idea of meet beatric he did not
meet beatric but he met old edward who knew him at onc

hid in the deepen shadowlook with wild ey of hope and fear and
love

she recov herself with an effort
then why did you frighten me so she ask it wa unkindoh i did
not mean to sai anyth cross what did i sai i forget i am so glad
that you have come and she put her hand to her forehead and look at
him again as on might gaze at a ghost from the grave

geoffrei shiver as he thought of the caus
oh thank you i have noth to complain of i am strong and well how
long do you stai here

beatric sigh happi is short she had not brought him here she
would not have lift a finger to bring him here but sinc he had come
she wish that he wa go to stai longer
it is supper time she said let us go in
so thei went in and at their supper it wa a happi meal mr granger
wa in almost boister spirit it is wonder what a differ the
possess of that two hundr pound made in hi demeanour he seem
anoth man it wa true that a hundr of it must go in pai debt
but a hundr would be left which meant at least a year respit for
him elizabeth too relax her habitu grim the two hundr
pound had it influenc on her also and there were other genial
influenc at work in her dark secret heart beatric knew noth of
the monei and sat somewhat silent but she too wa happi with the wild
unreal happi that sometim visit us in dream
as for geoffrei if ladi honoria could have seen him she would have
stare in astonish of late he had been a veri silent man mani
peopl inde had found him a dull companion but under the influenc
of beatric presenc he talk and talk brilliantli perhap he wa
unconsci strive to show at hi veri best befor her as a man
natur doe in the presenc of a woman whom he love so brilliantli
did he talk that at last thei all sat still and listen to him and
thei might have been wors emploi
at length supper wa done and elizabeth retir to her room present
too mr granger wa call out to christen a sick babi and went
grumbl and thei were left alon thei sat in the windowplac and
look out at the quiet night
tell me about yourself said beatric
so he told her he narrat all the step by which he had reach
hi present posit and show her how from it he might rise to the
topmost height of all she did not look at him and did not answer
him but onc when he paus think that he had talk enough about
himself she said go on tell me some more
at last he had told her all
ye she said you have the power and the opportun and you will
on dai be among the foremost men of your gener
i doubt it he said with a sigh i am not ambiti i onli work for
the sake of work not for what it will bring on dai i daresai that i
shall weari of it all and leav it but while i do work i like to be
among the first in my degre
oh no she answer you must not give it up you must go on and on
promis me she continu look at him for the first timepromis
me that while you have health and strength you will persever till you
stand alon and quit preemin then you can give it up
why should i promis you thi beatric
becaus i ask it of you onc i save your life mr bingham and it
give me some littl right to direct it cours i wish that the man
whom i save to the world should be among the first men in the world
not in wealth which is an accid but in intellect and forc promis
me thi and i shall be happi
i promis you he said i promis that i will try to rise becaus you
ask it not becaus the prospect attract me but as he spoke hi heart
wa wrung it wa bitter to hear her speak thu of a futur in which
she would have no share which as her word impli would be a thing
utterli apart from her as much apart as though she were dead
ye he said again you gave me my life and it make me veri unhappi
to think that i can give you noth in return oh beatric i will
tell you what i have never told to ani on i am lone and wretch
with the except of yourself i do not think that there is anybodi who
realli care fori mean who realli sympathis with me in the world
i daresai that it is my own fault and it sound a humili thing to
sai and in a fashion a selfish thing i never should have said it to
ani live soul but you what is the us of be great when there is
nobodi to work for thing might have been differ but the world is a
hard place if youif you
at thi moment hi hand touch her it wa accident but in the
tender of hi heart he yield to the temptat and took it then
there wa a moment paus and veri gentli she drew her hand awai and
thrust it in her bosom
you have your wife to share your fortun she said you have effi to
inherit it and you can leav your name to your countri
then came a heavi paus
and you he said break it what futur is there for you
she laugh softli women have no futur and thei ask none at least i
do not now though onc i did it is enough for them if thei can ever
so littl help the live of other that is their happi and their
reward isrest
just then mr granger came back from hi christen and beatric rose
and went to bed
look a littl pale doesnt she mr bingham said her father i
think she must be troubl in her mind the fact iswel there is no
reason why i should not tell you she think so much of you and you
might sai a word to brighten her upwel it about mr davi i
fanci you know that she like him and is vex becaus he doe not
come forward well you seeof cours i mai be mistaken but i have
sometim thought that he mai i have seen him look as if he wa
think of it though of cours it is more than beatric ha got ani
right to expect she onli got herself and her good look to give him
and he a rich man think of it mr bingham and the old gentleman
turn up hi ey piousli just think what a thing it would be for
her and inde for all of us if it should pleas god to send a chanc
like that in her wai she would be rich for life and such a posit
but it is possibl on never know he might take a fanci to her at
ani rate mr bingham i think you could cheer her up a littl there is
no need for her to give up hope yet
geoffrei burst into a short grim laugh the idea of beatric languish
for owen davi inde the ironi of the whole posit wa too much
for hi sens of humour
ye he said i daresai that it might be a good match for her but i
do not know how she would get on with mr davi
get on why well enough of cours women ar soft and can squeez
into most hole especi if thei ar well line besid he mai be
a bit heavi but i think she is pine for him and it a piti that
she should wast her life like that what ar you go to bed well
goodnightgoodnight
geoffrei did go to bed but not to sleep for a long while he lai awak
think he thought of the last night which he had spent in thi littl
room of it strang experi of all that had happen sinc and
of the meet of todai could he after that meet ani longer
doubt what were the feel with which beatric regard him it wa
difficult to so and yet there wa still room for error then he thought
of what old edward had said to him and of what mr granger had said
with refer to beatric and owen davi the view of both were
crude and even vulgarli express but thei coincid and what wa
more there wa truth in them and he knew it the idea of beatric
marri mr davi to put it mildli wa repuls to him but had he
ani claim to stand between her and so desir a settlement in life
clearli he had not hi conscienc told him so
could it be right moreov that thi kind of tie which exist between
them should be knit more close what would it mean troubl and
noth but troubl more especi to beatric who would fret her
dai awai to no end he had done wrong in come here at all he had
done wrong in take her hand he would make the onli repar in hi
power as though in such a case as that of beatric repar were now
possibl he would effac himself from her life and see her no more
then she might learn to forget him or at the worst to rememb him
with but a vagu regret ye cost what it might he would forc himself
to do it befor ani actual mischief ensu the onli question wa
should he not go further should he not tell her that she would do well
to marri mr davi
ponder over thi most pain question at last he went to sleep
when men in geoffrei unhappi posit turn penit and see the error
of their wai the prudent resolv that ensu ar apt to overshoot the
mark and to partak of an aggress natur not satisfi with leav
thing alon thei must need hasten to proclaim their newfound virtu
to the partner of their fault and advertis their infal specif
to be taken by the partner for restor the statu quo ant
sometim as a consequ of thi piou zeal thei find themselv
misunderstood or even succe in precipit the catastroph which
thei laudabl desir to prevent
the morrow wa whitsundai and a dai that geoffrei had occas to
rememb for the rest of hi life thei all met at breakfast and shortli
afterward went to church the servic be at halfpast ten by wai
of put into effect the good resolut with which he wa so busi
pave an inferno of hi own geoffrei did not sit by beatric but took
a seat at the end of the littl church close to the door and tri to
consol himself by look at her
it wa a curiou sullennatur dai and although there wa not veri
much sun the air wa as hot as though thei were in midsumm had thei
been in a volcan region geoffrei would have thought that such weather
preced a shock of earthquak as it wa he knew that the english
climat wa simpli indulg itself at the expens of the popul
but as up to the present the season had been cold thi knowledg did
not consol him inde he felt so choke in the stuffi littl church
that just befor the sermon which he happen to be awar wa not
written by beatric he took an opportun to slip out unobserv not
know where to go he stroll down to the beach on which there
wa nobodi to be seen for as ha been observ bryngelli slept on
sundai present howev a man approach walk rapidli and to
all appear aimlessli in whom he recognis owen davi he wa
talk to himself while he walk and swing hi arm geoffrei
step asid to let him pass and as he did so wa surpris and even
shock to see the chang in the man hi plump healthylook face had
grown thin and wore a half sullen half piti express there were
dark circl round hi blue ey onc so placid and hi hair would
have been the better for cut geoffrei wonder if he had had an
ill at that moment owen chanc to look round and saw him
how do you do mr bingham he said i heard that you were here thei
told me at the station last night you see thi is a small place and on
like to know who come and goe he ad as though in excus
he walk on and geoffrei walk with him
you do not look well mr davi he said have you been laid up
no no he answer i am quit right it is onli my mind that is
ill
inde said geoffrei think that he certainli did look strang
perhap you live too much alon and it depress you
ye i live alon becaus i cant help myself what is a man to do
mr bingham when the woman he love will not marri him wont look at
him treat him like dirt
marri somebodi els suggest geoffrei
oh it is easi for you to sai thatyou have never love anybodi and
you dont understand i cannot marri anybodi els i want her onli

seen her but she will not have me she hate me
realli said geoffrei
ye realli and do you know why shall i tell you why i will tell
you and he grasp him by the arm and whisper hoars in hi ear
becaus she love you mr bingham
i tell you what it is mr davi said geoffrei shake hi arm free
i am not go to stand thi kind of thing you must be off your head
dont be angri with me he answer it is true i have watch her
and i know that it is true why doe she write to you everi week why
doe she alwai start and listen when anybodi mention your name oh
mr bingham owen went on piteous be mercifuly have your wife

you dont i think that i shall go craze i have alwai love her ever
sinc she wa a child and now my love travel faster and grow stronger
everi dai and carri me awai with it like a rock roll down a hill
you can onli bring beatric to shame but i can give her everyth as
much monei as she want all that she want and i will make her a good
husband i will never leav her side
i have no doubt that would be delight for her answer geoffrei
but doe it not strike you that all thi is just a littl undignifi
these remark interest as thei ar should be made to miss granger
not to me mr davi
i know he said but i dont care it is my onli chanc and what do
i mind about be undignifi oh mr bingham i have never love ani
other woman i have been lone all my dai do not stand in my path
now if you onli knew what i have suffer how i have prai god night
after night to give me beatric you would help me sai that you will
help me you ar on of those men who can do anyth she will listen
to you if you tell her to marri me she will do so and i shall bless
you my whole life
geoffrei look upon thi abject suppliant with the most unmitig
scorn there is alwai someth contempt in the sight of on
man plead to anoth for assist in hi love affairsthat is a
busi which he should do for himself how much greater then is the
humili involv when the amor person ask the aid of on whom he
believ to be hi rivalhi success rivalin the ladi affect
do you know mr davi geoffrei said i think that i have had
enough of thi i am not in a posit to forc miss granger to accept
advanc which appear to be unwelcom accord to your account but if
i get an opportun i will do thi i will tell her what you sai
you realli must manag the rest for yourself good morn to you mr
davi
he turn sharpli and went while owen watch him go
i dont believ him he groan to himself he will try to make her
hi lover oh god help mei cannot bear to think of it but if he
doe and i find him out let him be care i will ruin him ye
i will ruin him i have the monei and i can do it ah he think me a
fool thei all think me a fool but i havent been quiet all these year
for noth i can make a nois if necessari and if he is a villain
god will help me to destroi him i have prai to god and god will help
me
then he went back to the castl owen davi wa a type of the class of
religi men who believ that thei can enlist the almighti on the side
of their desir provid onli that those desir receiv the sanction
of human law or custom
thu within twentyfour hour geoffrei receiv no less than three
appeal to help the woman whom he love to the arm of a distast
husband no wonder then that he grew almost superstiti about the
matter
chapter xxii
a night of storm
that afternoon the whole vicarag parti walk up to the farm to inspect
anoth litter of young pig it struck geoffrei rememb former
edit that the reproduct power of mr granger old sow were
someth littl short of marvel and he dreamili work out a
calcul of how long it would take her and her progeni to produc a
pig to everi squar yard of the area of plucki littl wale it seem
that the thing could be done in six year which wa absurd so he gave
up calcul
he had no word alon with beatric that afternoon inde a certain
cold seem to have sprung up between them with the almost
supernatur quick of a love woman intuit she had divin
that someth wa pass in hi mind inim to her most vital
interest so she shun hi compani and receiv hi convent
advanc with a polit which wa as cold as it wa crush thi
did not pleas geoffrei it is on thing in her own interest of
cours to make up your mind heroic to abandon a ladi whom you do
not wish to compromis and quit anoth to be snub by that ladi
befor the moment of final separ though he never put the idea into
word or even defin it in hi mindfor geoffrei wa far too anxiou
and unhappi to be flippant at ani rate in thoughth would at heart
have wish her to remain the same inde to wax ever tender till
the fatal time of part arriv and even to show appreci of hi
virtuou conduct
but to the utter destruct of most such hand as geoffrei held love
women never will plai accord to the book their conduct imperil
everyth for it is obviou that it take two to bring an affair of
thi natur to a dignifi conclus even when the stake ar highest
and the matter is on of life and death beatric after all wa veri
much of a woman and she did not behav much better than ani other woman
would have done she wa angri and suspici and she show it
with the result that geoffrei grew angri also it wa cruel of her he
thought consid all thing he forgot that she could know noth
of what wa in hi mind howev much she might guess also as yet he
did not know the boundless depth and might of her passion for him and
all that it meant to her had he realis thi he would have act veri
differ
thei came home and took tea then mr granger and elizabeth made readi
to go to even servic to geoffrei dismai beatric did the same he
had look forward to a quiet walk with herreal thi wa not to be
born fortun or rather unfortun she wa readi the first
and he got a word with her
i did not know that you were go to church he said i thought that
we might have had a walk togeth veri like i shall have to go awai
earli tomorrow morn
inde answer beatric coldli but of cours you have your work to
attend to i told elizabeth that i wa come to church and i must go
it is too sultri to walk there will be a storm soon
at thi moment elizabeth came in
well beatric she said ar you come to church father ha gone
on
beatric pretend not to hear and reflect a moment he would go awai
and she would see him no more could she let slip thi last hour oh
she could not do it
in that moment of reflect her fate wa seal
no she answer slowli i dont think that i am come it is too
sultri to go to church i daresai that mr bingham will accompani you
geoffrei hastili disclaim ani such intent and elizabeth start
alon ah she said to herself i thought that you would not come my
dear
well said geoffrei when she had well gone shall we go out
i think it is pleasant here answer beatric
oh beatric dont be so unkind he said feebli
as you like she repli there is a fine sunsetbut i think that we
shall have a storm
thei went out and turn up the lone beach the place wa utterli
desert and thei walk a littl wai apart almost without speak
the sunset wa magnific great flake of golden cloud were driven
continu from a home of splendour in the west toward the cold line
horizon of the land the sea wa still quiet but it moan like a thing
in pain the storm wa gather fast
what a love sunset said geoffrei at length
it is a fatal sort of loveli she answer it will be a bad
night and a wet morrow the wind is rise shall we turn
no beatric never mind the wind i want to speak to you if you will
allow me to do so
ye said beatric what about mr bingham
to make good resolut in a matter of thi sort is compar
easi but the carri of them out present some difficulti geoffrei
consciencestricken into priggish wish to tell her that she
would do well to marri owen davi and found the matter hard meanwhil
beatric preserv silenc
the fact is he said at length i most sincer hope you will
forgiv me but i have been think a great deal about you and your
futur welfar
that is veri kind of you said beatric with an omin humil
thi wa disconcert but geoffrei wa determin and he went on in
a somewhat flippant tone born of the most intens nervous and hatr
of hi task never had he love her so well as now in thi moment when
he wa about to counsel her to marri anoth man and yet he persev
in hi folli for as so often happen the shrewd insight and knowledg
of the world which distinguish geoffrei as a lawyer when deal with
the affair of other quit desert him in thi crisi of hi own life
and that of the woman who worship him
sinc i have been here he said i have had made to me no less than
three appeal on your behalf and by separ peoplebi your father
who fanci that you ar pine for owen davi by owen davi who is
certainli pine for you and by old edward interven as a kind of
domest amicu curi
inde said beatric in a voic of ic
all these three urg the same thingth desir of your marri
owen davi
beatric face grew quit pale her lip twitch and her grei ey
flash angrili
realli she said and have you ani advic to give on the subject
mr bingham
ye beatric i have i have thought it over and i think
thatforg me againthat if you can bring yourself to it perhap
you had better marri him he is not such a bad sort of man and he is
well off
thei had been walk rapidli and now thei were reach the spot known
as the amphitheatr that same spot where owen davi had propos to
beatric some seven month befor
beatric pass round the project edg of rock and walk some wai
toward the flat slab of stone in the centr befor she answer
while she did so a great and bitter anger fill her heart she saw
or thought she saw it all geoffrei wish to be rid of her he had
discern an element of danger in their intimaci and wa anxiou to
make that intimaci imposs by push her into a hate marriag
suddenli she turn and face himturn like a thing at bai the last
red rai of the sunset struck upon her love face made more love
still by it stamp of haughti anger thei lai upon her heav
breast full in the ey she look him with those wide angri ey of
hersnev befor had he seen her so imperi a mien her digniti and
the power of her presenc liter aw him for at time beatric
beauti wa of that royal stamp which when it hide a heart is a
compel forc conquer and born to conquer
doe it not strike you mr bingham she said quietli that you ar
take a veri great liberti doe it not strike you that no man who is
not a relat ha ani right to speak to a woman as you have spoken to
methat in short you have been guilti of what in most peopl would
be an impertin what right have you to dictat to me as to whom i
should or should not marri sure of all thing in the world that is my
own affair
geoffrei colour to the ey as would have been the case with most
men of hi class he felt her accus of have taken a liberti of
have presum upon an intimaci more keenli than ani which she could
have brought against him
forgiv me he said humbl i can onli assur you that i had no such
intent i onli spokeilljudgedli i fearbecausebecaus i felt
driven to it
beatric took no notic of hi word but went on in the same cold
voic
what right have you to speak of my affair with mr davi with an old
boatman or even with my father had i wish you to do so i should have
ask you by what author do you constitut yourself an intermediari
for the purpos of bring about a marriag which you ar so good as to
consid would be to my pecuniari interest do you not know that such a
matter is on which the woman concern the woman whose happi and
selfrespect ar at stake alon can judg of i have noth more to
sai except thi i said just now that you had been guilti of what would
in most peopl be an impertin well i will add someth in
thi case mr bingham there ar circumst which make ita cruel
insult
she stop speak then suddenli without the slightest warn
burst into passion weep as she did so the first rush of the
storm pass over them winnow the air as with a thousand eagl
wing and wa lost on the moan depth beyond
the light went out of the sky now geoffrei could onli see the faint
outlin of her weep face on moment he hesit and on onli then
natur prevail against him for the next she wa in hi arm
beatric scarc resist him her energi seem to fail her or
perhap she had spent them in her bitter word her head fell upon hi
shoulder and there she sob her fill present she lift it and
their lip met in a first long kiss it wa finish thi wa the end
of itand thu did geoffrei prosper owen daviess suit
oh you ar cruel cruel he whisper in her ear you must have
known i love you beatric that i spoke against myself becaus i
thought it to be my duti you must have known that to my sin and
sorrow i have alwai love you that you have never been an hour from
my mind that i have long to see your face like a sick man for the
light tell me did you not know it beatric
how should i know she answer veri softli i could onli guess
and if inde you love me how could you wish me to marri anoth man i
thought that you had learn my weak and took thi wai to reproach
me oh geoffrei what have we done what is there between you and
meexcept our love
it would have been better if we had been drown togeth at the
first he said heavili
no no she answer for then we never should have love on
anoth better first to love and then to die
do not speak so he said let us sit here and be happi for a littl
while tonight and leav troubl till tomorrow
and where on a bygon dai beatric had tarri with anoth wooer side
by side thei sat upon the great stone and talk such talk as lover
us
abov them moan the rise gale though shelter as thei were by
cliff it breath scarc stir their hair in front of them the long
wave boom upon the beach while far out to sea the crescent moon
drape in angri light seem to ride the water like a boat
and were thei alon with their great bliss or did thei onli dream nai
thei were alon with love and lover joi and all the truth wa told
and all their doubt were done now there wa an end of hope and fear
now reason fell and love usurp hi throne and at that royal come
heaven threw wide her gate oh sweetest and most dear oh dearest and
most sweet oh to have live to find thi happi houroh in thi hour
to die
see heavi is behind us see now we ar on blow you wind blow
out your stormi heart we know the secret of your strength you rush to
your desir fall deep water of the sea fall in thunder at the feet
of earth we hear the music of your plead
earth and sea and wind sing your great chant of love heaven and
space and time echo back the melodi for life ha call to us the
answer of hi riddl heart to heart we sit and lip to lip and
we ar more wise than solomon and richer than barbarian king for
happi is our
to thi end were we born dearest and most sweet and from all time
predestin to thi end sweetest and most dear do we live and die
in death to find complet uniti for here is that secret of the world
which wise men search and cannot find and here too is the gate of
heaven
look into my ey and let me gaze on your and listen how these thing
shall be the world is but a mockeri and a shadow is our flesh for
where onc thei were there shall be naught onli love is real love
shall endur till all the sun ar dead and yet be young
kiss me thou conqueror for destini is overcom sorrow is gone by and
the flame that we have hallow upon thi earthli altar shall still burn
brightli and yet more bright when yonder star have lost their fire
but ala word cannot give a fit form to such a song as thi let
music try but music also fold her wing for in so suprem an hour
a bolt is shot back somewher in our breast
and through that open door come sight and sound such as cannot be
written
thei tell us it is mad that thi unearthli glori is but the frenzi
of a passion gross in it veri essenc let those think it who will but
to dreamer let them leav their dream why then at such a time do
vision come to children of the world like beatric and geoffrei why do
their doubt vanish and what is that breath from heaven which thei seem
to feel upon their brow the intox of earthli love born of the
meet of youth and beauti so be it slave bring more such wine and
let us drinkto immort and to those dear ey that mirror forth a
spirit face
such love inde ar few for thei must be real and deep and natur
thu shape ar rare nor do thei often cross each other line of life
ye there ar few who can be born so high and none can breath
that ether long soon the wing which love lent them in hi hour of
revel will shrink and vanish and the borrow will fall back to
the level of thi world happi if thei escap uncrush perchanc
even in their lifedai thei mai find these spirit wing again
overshadow the altar of their vow in the hour of earthli marriag
if by some happi fate marriag should be within their reach or like
the holi pinion of the goddess nout fold about a coffin in the time
of earthli death but scant ar the occas and few there ar who
know them
thu soar beatric and geoffrei while the wild night beat around them
make a fit accompani to their stormi love and thu thei too fell
from heaven to earth
we must be go geoffrei it grow late said beatric oh
geoffrei geoffrei what have we done what can be the end of all thi
it will bring troubl on you i know that it must the old sai will
come true i save your life and i shall bring ruin on you
it is characterist of beatric that alreadi she wa think of the
consequ to geoffrei not of those to herself

world

career that is befor you what part of the world could you go to where

watch the lightn illumin the broad breast of the mountain behind
then look toward the door of beatric room he gaze at it with
the peculiar rever that sometim afflict peopl who ar veri much
in love and with a sigh turn and sought hi own

hi coars unprofit struggl with the world where there would be no
beatric to make him happi through it all and she what of her
the storm had lull a littl now it came back in strength herald
by the lightn he rose threw on a dressinggown and sat by a window
watch it it tumult and furi seem to eas hi heart of some littl
of it pain in that dark hour a quiet night would have madden him
in eight hourseight short hoursthi matter would be end so far as
concern their actual intercours it would be a secret lock for ever
in their two breast a secret eat at their heart cruel as the worm
that dieth not geoffrei look up and threw out hi heart thought
toward hi sleep love then onc more as in a bygon night there
broke upon hi brain and be that mysteri spiritu sens stronger
and more strong it grew beat on him in heavi unnatur wave
till hi reason seem to reel and sink and he rememb naught but
beatric knew naught save that her veri life wa with him now
he stretch out hi arm toward the place where she should be
beatric he whisper to the empti air beatric oh my love my
sweet my soul hear me beatric
there came a paus and ever the unearthli sympathi grew and gather in
hi heart till it seem to him as though separ had lost it power
and across divid space thei were mingl in on be
a great gust shook the hous and pass awai along the roar depth
oh what wa thi silent the door open and a white drape form
pass it threshold he rose gasp a terribl fear a terribl joi
took possess of him the lightn flare out wildli in the eastern
sky there in the fierc light she stood befor himsh beatric a
sight of beauti and of dread she stood with white arm outstretch
with white uncov feet her bosom heav softli beneath her

he rose aghast trembl like an aspen with doubt and fear trembl
at the sight of the conquer glori of the woman whom he worship

do
suddenli the draught of the great gale rush through the hous caught
the open door and crash it to

chapter xxiii
a dawn of rain
that crash of the close door did not awak beatric onli it awok
both elizabeth and mr granger elizabeth sat up in bed strain her
ey through the gloom to see what had happen thei fell on beatric
bedsurelysur
elizabeth slip up catlik she crept across the room and felt with
her hand at the bed beatric wa not there she sprang to the blind
and drew it let in such light as there wa and by it search the
room she spoke beatric where ar you

ahh said elizabeth aloud i understand at lastat last
what should see do should she go and call her father and put them to
an open shame no beatric must come back some time the knowledg wa
enough she want the knowledg to us if necessari she did not wish
to ruin her sister unless in selfdef or rather for the caus of
selfadvanc still less did she wish to injur geoffrei against
whom she had no grudg so she peep along the passag then return
crept back to her bed like a snake into a hole and watch
mr granger hear the crash thought that the front door had blown
open rise he lit a candl and went to see
but of all thi geoffrei knew noth and beatric natur less than
noth
she lai senseless in hi arm her head rest on hi shoulder her
heavi hair stream down hi side almost to hi knee he lift her
touch her on the forehead with hi lip and laid her on the bed what
wa to be done bring her back to life no he dare notnot here
while she lai thu her helpless protect her but if onc more she
wa a live love woman here and sooh how should thei escap he
dare not touch her or look toward hertil he had made up hi mind
it wa soon done here she must not bide and sinc of herself she could
not go why he must take her now thi moment howev far geoffrei fell
short of virtu stricter standard let thi alwai be rememb in
hi favour
he open the door and as he did so thought that he heard some
on stir in the hous and so he did it wa mr granger in the
sittingroom hear no more geoffrei conclud that it wa the wind
and turn grope hi wai to the bed where beatric lai as still as
death for on moment a horribl fear struck him that she might be dead
he had heard of case of somnambulist who on be startl from their
unnatur sleep onli woke to die it might be so with her hurriedli he
place hi hand upon her breast ye her heart stirredfaintli inde
but still it stir she had onli swoon then he set hi teeth
and place hi arm about her lift her as though she were a babe
beatric wa no slip of a girl but a wellgrown woman of full size he
never felt her weight it seem noth to him stealthili as on bent
on midnight murder he step with her to the door and through it into
the passag then support her with on arm he close the door with
hi left hand stealthili in the gloom he pass along the corridor hi
bare feet make no nois upon the board floor till he reach the
bisect passag lead from the sittingroom
he glanc up it apprehens and what he saw froze the blood in
hi vein for there come down it not eight pace from him wa mr
granger hold a candl in hi hand what could be done to get
back to hi room wa impossibleto reach that of beatric wa also
imposs with an effort he collect hi thought and like a flash
of light it pass into hi mind that the empti room wa not two pace
from him a stride and he had reach it oh where wa the handl and
oh if the room should be lock by a merci chanc it wa not he
step through the door knock beatric feet against the framework
as he did so close itto shut it he had no timeand stood gasp
behind it
the gleam of light drew nearer merci power he had been seenth
old man wa come in what could he sai tell the truth that wa
all but who would believ such a stori why it wa on that he should
scarc care to advanc in a court of law could he expect a father to
believ ita father find a man crouch like a thief behind a door
at the dead of night with hi love daughter senseless in hi arm he
had alreadi thought of go straight to mr granger but had abandon
the idea as hopeless who would believ thi tale of sleepwalk
for the first time in hi life geoffrei felt terribl afraid both for
beatric and himself the hair rose on hi head hi heart stood still
and a cold perspir start on to hi face
it veri odd he heard the old man mutter to himself i could almost
swear that i saw someth white go into that room where the handl
if i believ in ghostshullo my candl ha blown out i must go and
hunt for a match dont quit like go in there without a light
for the moment thei were save the fierc draught rush through the
open crack of the door from the illfit window had extinguish the
candl
geoffrei wait a few second to allow mr granger to reach hi room
and then onc more start on hi aw journei he pass out of the
room in safeti happili beatric show no sign of recoveri a few
quick step and he wa at her own door and now a new terror seiz him
what if elizabeth wa also walk the hous or even awak he thought
of put beatric down at the door and leav her there but
abandon the idea to begin with her father might see her and then
how could her presenc be account for or if he did not she would
certainli suffer ill effect from the cold no he must risk it and
at onc though he would rather have face a batteri of gun the door
fortun wa ajar geoffrei open it with hi foot enter and
with hi foot push it to again suddenli he rememb that he had
never been in the room and did not know which bed belong to beatric
he walk to the nearest a deepdrawn breath told him that it wa the
wrong on draw some faint consol from the fact that elizabeth
wa evid asleep he grope hi wai to the second bed through
the deep twilight of the room the cloth were thrown back he laid
beatric down and threw them over her then he fled
as he reach the door he saw mr granger light disappear into hi own
room and heard hi door close after that it seem to him that he took
but two step and wa in hi own place
he burst out laugh there wa as much hysteria in the laugh as a man
give wai to hi nerv were shatter by struggl love and fear and
sought relief in ghastli merriment somehow the whole scene remind
him of on in a comic opera there wa a ludicr side to it suppos
that the polit oppon who alreadi hate him so bitterli could
have seen him slink from door to door at midnight with an unconsci
ladi in hi armswhat would thei have said
he ceas laugh the fit passedinde it wa no laugh matter
then he thought of the first night of their strang communion that
night befor he had return to london the seed sown in that hour had
blossom and born fruit inde who would have dream it possibl
that he should thu have drawn beatric to him well he ought to have
known if it wa possibl that the word which float through her
mind could aris in hi as thei had done upon that night what wa
not possibl and were there not other word written by the same
masterhand which told of such thing as these
nownow the door is heard
hark the stair and near
nearerand here
now and at call the third
she enter without a word
like the door of a casket shrine
see on either side
her two arm divid
till the heart betwixt make sign
take me for i am thine
first i will prai do thou
that ownest the soul
yet wilt grant control
to anoth nor disallow
for a time restrain me now
did thei not run thu oh he should have known thi he could plead
and thi onlythat control had been grant to him
but how would beatric fare would she come to herself safe he
thought so it wa onli a faint fit but when she did recov what
would she do noth rash he prai and what could be the end of
it all who might sai how fortun that the sister had been so sound
asleep somehow he did not trust elizabethh fear her
well might geoffrei fear her elizabeth sleep wa that of a weasel
she too wa laugh at thi veri moment laugh not loud but
longth laugh of on who win
she had seen him enter hi burden in hi arm saw him come with it to
her own bedsid and had breath heavili to warn him of hi mistak
she had watch him put beatric on her bed and heard him sigh and turn
awai noth had escap her as soon as he wa gone she had risen and
crept up to beatric and find that she wa onli in a faint had left
her to recov know her to be in no danger elizabeth wa not a
nervou person then she had listen till at length a deep sigh told
her of the return of her sister conscious after thi there wa a
paus till present beatric long soft breath show that she had
glide from swoon to sleep
the slow night wore awai and at length the cold dawn crept through
the window elizabeth still watch for she wa not will to lose a
singl scene of a drama so entranc in itself and so import to her
interest saw her sister suddenli sit up in bed and press her hand
to her forehead as though she wa strive to recal a dream then
beatric cover her ey with her hand and groan heavili next she
look at her watch rose drank a glass of water and dress herself
even to the put on of an old grei waterproof with a hood to it for
it wa wet outsid
she is go to meet her lover thought elizabeth i wish i could be
there to see that too but i have seen enough
she yawn and appear to wake what beatric go out alreadi in
thi pour rain she said with feign astonish

bingham he goe by the earli train you knowbut perhap you will
see him out walk and appear to wake up thoroughli she rais
herself in bed and gave her sister on pierc look
beatric made no answer that look sent a thrill of fear through her
oh what had happen or wa it all a dream had she dream that she
stood face to face with geoffrei in hi room befor a great dark
struck her and overwhelm her or wa it an aw truth and if a
truth how came she here again she went to the pantri found a morsel
of bread and at it for faint still pursu her then feel
better she left the hous and set her face toward the beach

littl gust heavi with drive rain the sea wa sullen and grei and
grand it beat in thunder on the shore and flew over the sunken rock in
column of leaden sprai the whole earth seem on desol and all
it grief wa centr in thi woman broken heart
geoffrei too wa up how he had pass the remaind of that tragic
night we need not inquirenot too happili we mai be sure he heard the
front door close behind beatric and follow out into the rain
on the beach some half of a mile awai he found her gaze at the sea
a great white gull wheel about her head no word of greet pass
between them thei onli grasp each other hand and look into each
other hollow ey
come under the shelter of the cliff he said and she came she stood
beneath the cliff her head bow low her face hidden by the hood and
spoke

it is not well to linger over such a scene as thi after all too it
is noth onli anoth broken heart or so the world break so mani
thi wai and the other that it can have littl pleasur in gloat over
such stale scene of agoni
besid we must not let our sympathi carri us awai geoffrei and
beatric deserv all thei got thei had no busi to put themselv
into such a posit thei had defi the custom of their world
and the world aveng itself upon them and their petti passion what
happen to the worm that tri to burrow on the highwai grind
wheel and crush feet these ar it portion beatric and geoffrei
point a moral and adorn a tale so far as we can see and judg there wa
no need for them to have plung into that everrun river of human
pain let them struggl and drown and let those who ar on the bank
learn wisdom from the sight and hold out no hand to help them
geoffrei drew a ring from hi finger and gave it to hi love it wa a
common flatsid silver ring that had been taken from the grave of a
roman soldier on peculiar it had howev on it inner surfac
were roughli cut the word av atqu vale greet and farewel it
wa a fit gift to pass between peopl in their posit beatric
trembl sore whisper that she would wear it on her heart upon
her hand she could not put it yet awhileit might be recognis
then thrice did thei embrac there upon the desol shore onc as it
were for past joi onc for present pain and onc for futur hope
and part there wa no talk of after meetingsthei felt them to
be imposs at ani rate for mani year how could thei meet as
indiffer friend too much thei love for that it wa a final
part than which death had been less dreadfulfor hope sit ever by
the bed of deathand miseri crush them to the earth
he left her and happi went out of hi life as at nightfal the
daylight goe out of the dai well at least he had hi work to go to
but beatric poor woman what had she
geoffrei left her when he had gone some thirti pace he turn again
and gaze hi last upon her there she stood or rather leant her hand
rest against the wet rock look after him with her wide grei ey
even through the drizzl rain he could see the gleam of her rich
hair the mark of her love face and the carmin of her lip she
motion to him to go on he went and when he had travers a hundr
pace look round onc more she wa still there but now her face wa
a blur and again the great white gull hover about her head
then the mist swept up and hid her
ah beatric with all your brain you could never learn those simpl
principl necessari to the happi of woman principl inherit
through a thousand gener of savag and semicivil
ancestress to accept the situat and the master that situat
bring with itthi is the golden rule of wellb not to put out
the hand of your affect further than you can draw it back thi is
anoth at least not until you ar quit sure that it object is well
within your grasp if by misfortun or the anger of the fate you
ar endow with those deeper qualiti those extrem capac of
selfsacrif affect such as ruin your happi beatric
keep them in stock do not expos them to the world the world doe not
believ in them thei ar inconveni and undesir thei ar even
immor what the world want and veri rightli in a person of your
attract is quiet domest of charact not the exhibit of
attribut which though thei might qualifi you for the rank of heroin
in a greek drama ar nowadai onli like to qualifi you for the

what you would rather keep your love your reprehens love which
never can be satisfi and bear it sling and arrow and die hug
a shadow to your heart strain your ey into the dark of that
beyond whither you shall gomurmur with your pale lip that there
you will find reason and fulfil why it is folli what ground have
you to suppos that you will find anyth of the sort go and take the

he will smile tenderli and show you how those also ar an eman
from a crave heart and the innat superstit of mankind inde
he will laugh and illustr the absurd of the whole thing by a few
pungent exampl of what would happen if these earthli affect could
be carri beyond the grave take what you can now will be the burden
of hi song and for good sake do not wast your preciou hour in

chapter xxiv
ladi honoria take the field
geoffrei hurri to the vicarag to fetch hi baggag and sai goodby
he had no time for breakfast and he wa glad of it for he could not
have eaten a morsel to save hi life he found elizabeth and her father
in the sittingroom
why where have you been thi wet morn mr bingham said mr
granger
i have been for a walk with miss beatric she is come home by the
villag he answer i dont mind rain and i want to get as much
fresh air as i could befor i go back to the mill thank youonli a cup
of teai will get someth to eat as i go
how kind of him reflect mr granger no doubt he ha been speak
to beatric again about owen davi
oh by the wai he ad aloud did you happen to hear anybodi move
in the hous last night mr bingham just when the storm wa at it
height first of all a door slam so violent that i got up to see
what it wa and as i came down the passag i could almost have sworn
that i saw someth white go into the spare room but my candl went
out and by the time that i had found a light there wa noth to be
seen
a clear case of ghost said geoffrei indiffer it wa inde
a case of ghost and thei would he reflect haunt him for mani a
dai
how veri odd put in elizabeth vivaci her keen ey fix
intent on hi face do you know i thought that i twice saw the door
of our room open and shut in the most mysteri fashion i think that
beatric must have someth to do with it she is so uncanni in her
wai
geoffrei never move a muscl he wa train to keep hi counten
onli he wonder how much thi woman knew she must be silenc somehow
excus me for chang the subject he said but my time is short
and i have none to spare to hunt the vicarag ghost by the wai
there a good titl for somebodi mr granger i believ that i mai
speak of busi matter befor miss elizabeth
certainli mr bingham said the clergyman elizabeth is my right
hand and ha the best busi head in bryngelli
geoffrei thought that thi wa veri evid and went on i onli want
to sai thi if you get into ani further difficulti with your rascal
tithepay mind and let me know i shall alwai be glad to help you
while i can and now i must be go
he spoke thu for two reason first natur enough he meant to make
it hi busi to protect beatric from the pressur of poverti and
well knew that it would be useless to offer her direct assist
secondli he wish to show elizabeth that it would not be to the
advantag of her famili to quarrel with him if she had seen a ghost
perhap thi fact would make her retic on the subject he did not
know that she wa plai a much bigger game for her own hand a game
of which the stake were thousand a year and that she wa moreov mad
with jealousi and what in such a woman must pass for love
elizabeth made no comment on hi offer and befor mr granger profus
thank were nearli finish geoffrei wa gone
three week pass at bryngelli and elizabeth still held her hand
beatric pale and spiritless went about her duti as usual elizabeth
never spoke to her in ani sens that could awaken her suspicion and
the ghost stori wa or appear to be pretti well forgotten but at
last an event occur that caus elizabeth to take the field on dai
she met owen davi walk along the beach in the semiinsan wai which
he now affect he stop and without further ado plung into
convers
i cant bear it ani longer he said wildli throw up hi arm i
saw her yesterdai and she cut me short befor i could speak a word i
have prai for patienc and it will not come onli a voic seem
to sai to me that i must wait ten dai more ten short dai and then
beatric my beauti beatric would be my wife at last
if you go on in thi wai mr davi said elizabeth sharpli her
heart fill with jealou anger you will soon be off your head ar
you not asham of yourself for make such a fuss about a girl pretti
face if you want to get marri marri somebodi els
marri somebodi els he said dreamili i dont know anybodi els whom
i could marri except you and you ar not beatric
no answer elizabeth angrili i should hope that i have more
sens and if you want to marri me you would have to set about it in
a differ wai from thi i am not beatric thank heaven but i am
her sister and i warn you that i know more about her than you do as a
friend i warn you to be care suppos that beatric were not worthi
of you you would not wish to marri her would you
now owen davi wa at heart somewhat afraid of elizabeth like most
other peopl who had the privileg of her acquaint also apart from
matter connect with hi insan passion he wa veri fairli shrewd he
suspect elizabeth of someth he did not know of what
no no of cours not he said of cours i would not marri her if
she wa not fit to be my wifebut i must know that first befor i talk
of marri anybodi els good afternoon miss elizabeth it will soon
be settl now it cannot go on much longer now my prayer will be

you ar right there owen davi thought elizabeth as she look
after him with ineff bitter not to sai contempt your prayer
shall be answer in a wai that will astonish you you shall not marri
beatric and you shall marri me the fish ha been on the line long
enough now i must begin to pull in
curious enough it never realli occur to elizabeth that beatric
herself might prove to be the true obstacl to the marriag she plot
to prevent she knew that her sister wa fond of geoffrei bingham but
when it came to the point that she would absolut allow her affect
to interfer with so gloriou a success in life she never believ for
on moment of cours she thought it wa possibl that if beatric could
get possess of geoffrei she might prefer to do so but fail him
judg from her own low and vulgar standard elizabeth wa convinc
that she would take owen it did not seem possibl that what wa so
preciou in her own ey might be valueless and even hate to those of
her sister as for that littl midnight incid well it wa on thing
and marriag wa anoth peopl forget such event when thei marri
sometim even thei marri in order to forget them
ye she must strike but how elizabeth had feel like other peopl
she did not mind ruin her sister and rival but she would veri much
prefer it should not be known that her wa the hand to cut her down of
cours if the worst came to the worst she must do it meanwhil might
not a substitut be foundsomebodi in whom the act would seem not on
of vengeanc but of virtu ah she had it ladi honoria who could be
better for such a purpos than the cruelli injur wife but then how
should she commun the fact to her ladyship without involv
herself again she hit upon a devic much favour by such peopleun
vieux truc mai toujour bonth pristin on of an anonym letter
which ha the startl merit of not commit anybodi to anyth
an anonym letter to all appear written by a servant it wa the
veri thing most like it would result in a search inquiri by ladi
honoria in which event elizabeth of cours against her will would
be forc to sai what she knew almost certainli it would result in a
quarrel between husband and wife which might induc the former to show
hi hand or even to take some open step as regard beatric she wa
sorri for geoffrei against whom she had no ill feel but it could
not be help he must be sacrif
that veri even she wrote her letter and sent it to be post by
an old servant live in london it wa a masterpiec in it wai
especi phonet thi preciou epistl which wa most
exceedingli ill writ in a larg coars hand ran thu

the riter
in due cours thi charm commun reach ladi honoria bear
a london postmark she read and reread it and soon master it
mean then after a night thought she took the riter advic
and wrote to elizabeth send her a copi of the letter her own
vehement repudi all belief in it and ask for a repli that
should dissip thi foul slander from her mind for ever
the answer came by return it wa short and art
dear ladi honoria bingham it ran you must forgiv me if i declin
to answer the question in your letter you will easili understand that
between a desir to preserv a sister reput and an incapac to
be appreci by everi christian to speak other than the truthit
is possibl for a person to be place in the most cruel of positionsa
posit which i am sure will command even your sympathi though
under such circumst i have littl right to expect ani from a wife
believ herself to have been cruelli wrong let me add that noth
short of the compuls of a court of law will suffic to unseal my
lip as to the detail of the circumst which ar i trust
misunderstood allud to in the malici anonym letter of which you
inclos a copi
that veri even as the fate would have it ladi honoria and her
husband had a quarrel as usual it wa about effi for on most other
subject thei preserv an arm neutral it detail need not
be enter into but at last geoffrei who wa in a sadli irrit
condit of mind fairli lost hi temper
the fact is he said that you ar not fit to look after the child
you onli think of yourself honoria
she turn on him with a danger look upon her cold and handsom face
be care what you sai geoffrei it is you who ar not fit to have
charg of effi be care lest i take her awai from you altogeth as
i can if i like
what do you mean by that threat he ask
do you want to know then i will tell you i understand enough law to
be awar that a wife can get a separ from an unfaith husband
and what is more can take awai hi children
again i ask what you mean said geoffrei turn cold with anger
i mean thi geoffrei that welsh girl is your mistress she pass
the night of whitsundai in your room and wa carri from it in your
arm
it is a lie he said she is noth of the sort i do not know who
gave you thi inform but it is a slander lie and somebodi
shall suffer for it
nobodi will suffer for it geoffrei becaus you will not dare to stir
the matter upfor the girl sake if not for your own can you
deni that you were seen carri her in your arm from your room on
whitsundai night can you deni that you ar in love with her
and suppos that i am in love with her is it to be wonder at
see how you treat me and have treat me for year he answer
furious it is utterli fals to sai that she is my mistress
you have not answer my question said ladi honoria with a smile of
triumph were you seen carri that woman in your arm and from your
room at the dead of night of cours it meant noth noth at all
who would dare to aspers the charact of thi perfect love and
intellectu schoolmistress i am not jealou geoffrei
i should think not honoria see how thing ar
i am not jealou i repeat but pleas understand that i will not have
thi go on in your own interest and mine why what a fool you must
be dont you know that a man who ha risen as you have ha a hundr
enemi readi to spring on him like a pack of wolv and tear him to
piec why mani even of those who fawn upon you and flatter you to your
face hate you bitterli in secret becaus you have succeed where thei
have fail dont you know also that there ar paper here in london
which would give hundr of pound for the chanc of publish such a
scandal as thi especi against a power polit oppon let
it onc come out that thi obscur girl is your mistress
honoria i tell you she is noth of the sort it is true i carri
her from my room in a faint fit but she came there in her sleep
ladi honoria laugh realli geoffrei i wonder that you think it
worth while to tell me such nonsens keep it for the divorc court
if ever we get there and see what a juri sai to it look here be
sensibl i am not a moralist and i am not go to plai the outrag
wife unless you forc me to it i do not mean to take ani further notic
of thi interest littl tale as against you but if you go on with
it bewar i will not be made to look a fool if you ar go to be
ruin you can be ruin by yourself i warn you frankli that at
the first sign of it i shall put myself in the right by commenc
proceed against you now of cours i know thi that in the event
of a smash you would be glad enough to be rid of me in order that you
might welcom your dear beatric in my place but there ar two thing
to rememb first that you could not marri her suppos you to be
idiot enough to wish to do so becaus i should onli get a judici
separ and you would still have to support me secondli if i go
effi goe with me for i have a right to claim her at law and that
fact my dear geoffrei make me mistress of the situat becaus i
do not suppos that you would part with effi even for the sake of miss
beatric and now i will leav you to think it over
and with a littl nod she sail out of the room complet victori
she wa inde reflect geoffrei mistress of the situat
suppos that she brought a suit against him where would he be she
must have evid or she would not have known the stori the whole
drama had clearli been wit by someon probabl either by
elizabeth or the servant girl and that some on had betrai it to
honoria and possibl to other the thought made him sick he wa a
man of the world and a practic lawyer and though inde thei were
innoc he knew that under the circumst few would be found to
believ it at the veri best there must be a terribl and shock
scandal and beatric would lose her good name he place himself in the
posit of counsel for the petition in a like case and thought how
he would crush and crumpl such a defenc in hi address to the juri a
probabl tale forsooth
undoubtedli too honoria would be act wise from her point of view
public sympathi would be with her throughout he knew that as it wa
he wa believ gener to ow much of hi success to hi handsom and
highborn wife now it would be said that he had us her as a ladder
and then thrown her over with all thi howev he might cope he
could even bear with the vulgar attack of a vulgar press and the gibe
and jeer of hi polit and person enemi but to lose effi
he could not bear and if such a case were brought against him it wa
almost certain that he would lose her for if he wa worst custodi
of the child would be given to the injur wife
then there wa beatric to be consid the same malici tongu that
had reveal thi matter to honoria would probabl reveal it to the rest
of the world and even if he escap the worst penalti of outrag
moral thei would certainli be wreak upon her beatric
reput would be blast her employ lost and her life made a
burden to her ye decidedli honoria had the best of the posit
decidedli also she spoke word of weight and common sens
what wa to be done wa there no wai out of it all that night as
geoffrei sat in the hous hi arm fold on hi breast and to
appear intent listen to the long harangu of the opposit
thi question haunt him he argu the situat out thi wai and that
wai till at the last he came to a conclus either he must wait for
the scandal to leak out let beatric be ruin and direct hi effort
to the soften of honoria and gener to selfpreserv or he
must take the bull by the horn must abandon hi great career and hi
countri and seek refug in anoth land sai america take beatric
and effi with him onc the child wa out of the jurisdict of
cours no court could forc her from him
of the two cours even in so far as he himself wa concern what
between the urgenc of the matter and the unceas pressur of hi
passion geoffrei inclin to the latter the relat between himself
and honoria had for year been so strain so total differ
from those which should exist between man and wife that thei greatli
mitig in hi mind the appar iniqu of such a step nor would he
feel much compunct at remov the child from her mother for
there wa no love lost between the two and as time went on he guess
shrewdli there would be less and less for the rest he had some
seventeen thousand pound in hand he would take half and leav honoria
half he knew that he could alwai earn a live wherev he went and
probabl much more than a live and of whatev he earn a strict
moieti should be paid to honoria but first and abov everyth there
wa beatric to be consid she must be save even if he ruin
himself to save her
ladi honoria it is scarc necessari to sai had littl idea that she
wa drive her husband to such danger and determin council she
want to frighten geoffrei not to lose him and all he meant to her
thi wa the last thing that she would wish to do she did not greatli
care about the beatric incid but her shrewd common sens told her
that it might well be us as an engin to ruin them all therefor she
spoke as she did speak though in realiti matter would have to be bad
inde befor she sought the aid of a court of law where mani thing
concern herself might come to the light of dai which she would prefer
to leav in dark
nor did she stop here she determin to attack geoffrei posit in
anoth wai name through beatric herself for a long time honoria
hesit as to the method of thi attack she had some knowledg of the
world and of charact and from what she knew of beatric she came
to the sound conclus that she wa not a woman to be threaten but
rather on to be appeal to so after much thought she wrote to her
thu
a stori which i still hesit to believ ha come to me by mean of
anonym letter as to your conduct with my husband i do not wish
to repeat it now further than to sai that if true it establish
circumst which leav no doubt as to the exist of relat so
intim between you as to amount to guilt it mai not be true or it
mai in which latter event i wish to sai thi with your moral i have
noth to do it is your affair nor do i wish to plead to you as an
injur wife or to reproach you for there ar thing too wick for
mere reproach but i will sai thi if the stori is true i must presum
that you have some affect for the partner of your shame i put myself
out of the question and in the name of that affect howev guilti
it mai be i ask you to push matter no further to do so will be
to bring it object to utter ruin if you care for him sever all
connect with him utterli and for ever otherwis he will live to
curs and hate you should you neglect thi advic and should the fact
that i have heard becom public properti i warn you as i have alreadi
warn him that in selfpreserv and for the sake of selfrespect
i shall be forc to appeal to the law for my remedi rememb that hi
career is at stake and that in lose it and me he will lose also hi
child rememb that if thi come about it will be through you do
not answer thi it will do no good for i shall natur put no faith
in your protest but if you ar in ani wai or measur guilti of
thi offenc appeal to you as on woman to anoth and for the sake
of the man who is dear to both i sai do your best to redeem the
evil by make all further commun between yourself and him an
imposs hb
it wa a clever letter ladi honoria could not have devis on more
power to work on a woman like beatric the same post that took it to
her took anoth from geoffrei himself it wa long though guard and
need not be quot in it entireti but it put the whole posit befor
her in somewhat veil languag and end by sai marriag i cannot
give you onli lifelong love in other circumst to offer thi
would be an insult but if thing should be as a i fear it is worth
your consider i do not sai to you come i sai come if you
wish no beatric i will not put thi cruel burden of decis upon
you i sai come i do not command you to come becaus i promis to
leav you uninfluenc but i prai you to do so let us put an end to
thi wretched and count the world well lost as our price of love
come dearest beatriceto leav me no more till death i put my life
in your hand if you take it up whatev troubl you mai have to face
you will never lose my affect or esteem do not think of me think of
yourself you have given me your love as you onc gave me my life i
ow someth in return i cannot see you shame and make no offer of
repar inde so far as i am concern i shall think all i lose
as noth compar to what i gain in gain you will you come if
so we will leav thi countri and begin afresh elsewher after all it
matter littl and will matter less when everyth is said and done
my life ha for year been but as an unwholesom dream the on real
thing the on happi thing that i have found in it ha been our love do
not let us throw it awai beatric
by return of post he receiv thi answer written in pencil
no dear geoffrei thing must take their courseb
that wa all

room at bryngelli castl which serv it owner for all purpos except
that of sleep would have wit a veri strang sight owen davi
wa walk to and frowalk rapidli with wild ey and dishevel
hair at the turn of each length of the apart he would halt and
throw hi arm into the air ejacul
oh god hear me and give me my desir oh god answer me
for two long hour thu he walk and thu cri aloud till at length
he sank pant and exhaust into a chair suddenli he rais hi head
and appear to listen intent

occur on the fridai night it wa on the follow morn that
beatric the unfortun and innoc object of these amor
invoc receiv the two letter she had gone to the postoffic
on her wai to the school on the chanc of there be a note from
geoffrei poor woman hi letter were the on bright thing in her life
from motiv of prudenc thei were written in the usual semiform
style but she wa quick to read between the line and moreov thei
came from hi dear hand
there wa the letter sure enough and anoth in a woman write she
recognis the hand as that of ladi honoria which she had often seen on
envelop direct to geoffrei and a thrill of fear shot through her
she took the letter and walk as quickli as she could to the school
lock herself in her own littl room for it wa not yet nine oclock
and look at them with a gather terror what wa in them why did
ladi honoria write to her which should she read first in a moment
beatric had made up her mind she would face the worst at onc with
a set face she open ladi honoria letter unfold it and read we
alreadi know it content as her mind grasp them her lip grew ashi
white and by the time that the horribl thing wa done she wa nigh to
faint
anonym letter oh who could have done thi cruel thing elizabeth
it must be elizabeth who saw everyth and thu stab her in the
back wa it possibl that her own sister could treat her so she knew
that elizabeth dislik her she could never fathom the caus still she
knew the fact but if thi were her do then she must hate her and
most bitterli and what had she done to earn such hate and now geoffrei
wa in danger on her account danger of ruin and how could she prevent
it thi wa her first idea most peopl might have turn to their own
posit and been content to leav their lover to fight hi own battl
but beatric thought littl of herself he wa in danger and how could
she protect him why here in the letter wa the answer if you care for
him sever all connect with him utterli and for ever otherwis he
will live to curs and hate you no no geoffrei would never do that
but ladi honoria wa quit right in hi interest for hi sake she
must sever all connect with himsev it utterli and for ever but
howhow
she thrust the letter into her dressa viper would have been a more
welcom guestand open geoffrei
it told the same tale but offer a differ solut the tear
start to her ey as she read hi offer to take her to him for
good and all and go awai with her to begin life afresh it seem a
wonder thing to beatric that he should be will to sacrific
so much upon such a worthless altar as her lovea wonder and most
gener thing she press the senseless paper to her heart then
kiss it again and again but she never thought of yield to thi
great temptat never for on second he prai her to come but that
she would not do while her will remain what she bring geoffrei
to ruin no she had rather starv in the street or perish by slow
tortur how could he ever think that she would consent to such a
scheme inde she never would she had brought enough troubl on him
alreadi but oh she bless him for that letter how deepli must he
love her when he could offer to do thi for her sake
hark the children were wait she must go and teach the letter

thrust it in her breast with the other but closer to her heart and
went

troubl walk into the room like a lamb to the slaughter
ah beatric said her father we were just ask for you
she glanc round and with the quick wit of a human anim instantli
perceiv that some new danger threaten her
inde she said sink into a chair in an access of feebl born
of fear what is it father
mr granger look at owen davi and then took a step toward the door
it struck him forcibl that thi scene should be privat to the two
person princip concern
dont go said owen davi excitedli dont go either of you what i
have to sai had better be said befor you both i should like to sai it
befor the whole world to cry it from the mountain top
elizabeth glare at him fiercelyglar first at him and then at the
innoc beatric could he be go to propos to her then ah why
had she hesit why had she not told him the whole truth befor
but the heart of beatric who sat momentarili expect to be publicli
denounc grew ever fainter the water of desol were close in
over her soul
mr granger sat down firmli and work himself into the seat of hi
chair as though to secur an addit fixed of tenur elizabeth
set her teeth and lean her elbow on the tabl hold her hand so as
to shade her face beatric droop upon her seat like a fade lili or
a prison in the dock she wa opposit to them and owen davi hi
face alight with wild enthusiasm stood up and address them all like
the counsel for the prosecut
last autumn he began speak to mr granger who might have been
a judg uncertain as to the merit of the case i ask your daughter
beatric to marri me
beatric gave a sigh and collect her scatter energi the storm
had burst at last and she must face it
i ask her to marri me and she told me to wait a year i have wait
as long as i could but i could not wait the whole year i have prai a
great deal and i am bidden to speak
elizabeth made a gestur of impati she wa a person of strong
common sens and thi mixtur of religion and erotic disgust her

elizabeth made a movement as though to speak then chang her mind and
listen

there wa a paus beatric who had sat quit silent wa gather up
her strength to answer elizabeth watch her from beneath her
hand thought that she read upon her face irresolut soften into
consent what she realli saw wa but doubt as to the fittest and most
certain manner of refus like lightn it flash into elizabeth
mind that she must strike now or hold her hand for ever if onc
beatric spoke that fatal ye her revel might be of no avail
and beatric would speak it she wa sure she would it wa a golden
road out of her troubl

honest man to be deceiv
there wa an aw paus beatric broke it now she saw all the truth
and knew what wa at hand she place her hand upon her heart to still
it beat

mr granger sank back in hi chair thi savag plai of human passion
wa altogeth beyond hi experienceit overwhelm him as for
elizabeth she bit her thin finger and glare from on to the other
he reckon without me she thought he reckon without mei will
marri him yet
but beatric leant for a moment against the wall and shut her ey
to think oh she saw it allth great poster with her name and
geoffrei on them the shameless pictur of her in hi arm the
sicken detail the letter of the outrag matron the mother of
ten and the moralmind colonelsal all she heard the prurient
scream of everi male elizabeth in england the allus in the
houseth jeer the bitter attack of enemi and rival then ladi
honoria would begin her suit and it would all be drag up afresh
and geoffrei fault would be on everi lip till he wa ruin for
herself she did not care but could she bring thi on on whose onli
crime wa that she had learn to love him no no but neither could
she marri thi hate man and yet what escap wa there she flung
herself upon her woman wit and it did not fail her in a few second
she had thought it all out and made up her mind
how can i answer you at a moment notic mr davi she said i
must have time to think it over to threaten such reveng upon me is not
manli but i know that you love me and therefor i excus it still i
must have time i am confus
what anoth year no no he said you must answer
i do not ask a year or a month i onli ask for on week if you will
not give me that then i will defi you and you mai do your worst i
cannot answer now
thi wa a bold stroke but it told mr davi hesit
give the girl a week said her father to him she is not herself
veri well on week no more said he
i have anoth stipul to make said beatric you ar all to
swear to me that for that week no word of thi will pass your mouth
that for that week i shall not be annoi or interf with or spoken
to on the subject not by on of you if at the end of it i still refus
to accept your term you can do your worst but till then you must hold
your hand
owen davi hesit he wa suspici
rememb beatric went on rais her voic i am a desper
woman i mai turn at bai and do someth which you do not expect and
that will be veri littl to the advantag of ani of you do you swear
ye said owen davi
then beatric look at elizabeth and elizabeth look at her she saw
that the matter had taken a new form she saw what her jealou folli
had hitherto hidden from herthat beatric did not mean to marri owen
davi that she wa mere gain time to execut some purpos of
her own what thi might be elizabeth care littl so that it did not
utterli extinguish chanc that at the moment seem faint enough she
did not want to push matter against her sister or her lover geoffrei
beyond the boundari of her own interest beatric should have her
week and be free from all interfer so far as she wa concern she
realis now that it wa too late how great had been her error oh if
onli she had sought beatric confid at first but it had seem to
her imposs that she would realli throw awai such an opportun in
life
certainli i promis beatric she said mildli i do not swear
for swear not at all you know i onli did what i thought my duti in
warn mr davi if he choos to go on with the matter it is no
affair of mine i had no wish to hurt you or mr bingham i act
sole from my religi convict
oh stop talk religion elizabeth and practis it a littl
more said her father for onc in hi life stir out of hi feebl
selfish we have all undertaken to keep our mouth seal for thi
week
then beatric left the room and after her went owen davi without
anoth word
elizabeth said her father rise you ar a wick woman what did
you do thi for
do you want to know father she said coolli then i will tell you
becaus i mean to marri owen davi myself we must all look after
ourselv in thi world you know and that is a maxim which you never
forget for on i mean to marri him and though i seem to have fail
marri him i will yet and now you know all about it and if you ar
not a fool you will hold your tongu and let me be and she went also
leav him alon
mr granger held up hi hand in astonish he wa a selfish
moneyseek old man but he felt that he did not deserv to have such
a daughter as thi
chapter xxvi
what beatric swore
beatric went to her room but the atmospher of the place seem to
stifl her her brain wa reel she must go out into the airawai
from her tormentor she had not yet answer geoffrei letter and
it must be answer by thi post for there wa none on sundai it wa
halfpast fourth post went out at five if she wa go to write
she should do so at onc but she could not do so here besid she
must find time for thought ah she had it she would take her cano and
paddl across the bai to the littl town of co and write her letter
there the post did not leav co till halfpast six she put on her
hat and jacket and take a stamp a sheet of paper and an envelop
with her slip quietli from the hous down to old edward boathous
where the cano wa kept old edward wa not there himself but hi
son wa a boi of fourteen and by hi help beatric wa soon safe
launch the sea glitter like glass and turn southward
present she wa paddl round the shore of the island on which the
castl stood toward the open bai
as she paddl her mind clear and she wa abl to consid the
posit it wa bad enough she saw no light dark hem her in
but at least she had a week befor her and meanwhil what should she
write to geoffrei
then as she thought a great temptat assail beatric and for the
first time her resolut waver why should she not accept geoffrei
offer and go awai with himfar awai from all thi miseri gladli would
she give her life to spend on short year at hi dear side she had but
to sai the word and he would take her to him and in a month from now
thei would be togeth in some foreign land count the world well
lost as he had said doubtless in time ladi honoria would get a
divorc and thei might be marri a dai might even come when all thi
would seem like a forgotten night of storm and fear when surround by
the children of their love thei would wend peaceabl happili through
the even of their dai toward a bourn rob of half it terror by
the fact that thei would cross it handinhand
oh that would be well for her but would it be well for him when the
first month of passion had pass by would he not begin to think of
all that he had thrown awai for the sake of a woman love would not
the burst of shame and obloqui which would follow him to the remotest
corner of the earth wear awai hi affect till at last as ladi
honoria said he learn to curs and hate her and if it did notif
he still love her through it alla be what he wa he well might
docould she be the on to bring thi ruin on him oh it would have
been more kind to let him drown on that night of the storm when fate
first brought them togeth to their undo
no no onc and for all onc and for ever she would not do it
cruel as wa her strait heavi as wa her burden not on feather
weight of it should he carri if by ani mean in her poor power she
could hold it from hi back she would not even tell him of what had
happenedat ani rate not now it would distress him he might take
some desper step it wa almost certain that he would do so her
answer must be veri short
she wa quit close to co now and the water lai calm as a pond so
calm wa it that she drew the sheet of paper and the envelop from her
pocket and lean forward rest them on the arch cover of the
cano and pencil those word which we have alreadi read
no dear geoffrei thing must take their courseb
thu she wrote then she paddl to the shore a fisherman stand on
the beach caught her cano and pull it up leav it in hi charg
she went into the quaint littl town direct and post her letter
and bought some wool it wa an excus for have been there should ani
on ask question after that she return to her cano the fisherman
wa stand by it she offer him sixpenc for hi troubl but he
would not take it
no miss he said thank you kindlybut we dont often get a peep
at such sweet look it worth sixpenc to see you it is but miss
if i mai make so bold as to sai so it isnt safe for you to cruis
about in that craft ani wai not alon
beatric thank him and blush a littl vagu it occur to her
that she must have more than a common share of beauti when a rough man
could be so impress with it that wa what men love women for their
beauti as owen davi love and desir her for thi same caus and
thi onli
perhap it wa the same with geoffreyno she did not believ it he
love her for other thing besid her look onli if she had not been
beauti perhap he would not have begun to love her so she wa
thank for her ey and hair and form
could folli and infatu go further thi woman in the darkest hour
of her bottomless and unhorizon despair with conscienc gnaw at
her heart with present miseri press on her breast and shame to come
hang over her like a thunder cloud could yet feel thank that she
had won thi barren love the spring of all her woe or wa her folli
deep wisdom in disguisei there someth divin in a passion that
can so overrid and defi the worst agoni of life
she wa at sea again now and even wa fall on the water softli
as a dream well the letter wa post would it be the last she
wonder it seem as though she must write no more letter and what
wa to be done she would not marri owen daviesnev would she do
it she could not so shamelessli violat her feel for beatric wa
a woman to whom death would be prefer to dishonour howev legal
no for her own sake she would not be soil with that disgrac did she
do thi she would hold herself the vilest of the vile and still less
would she do it for geoffrei sake her instinct told her what he would
feel at such a thing though he might never sai a word sure he would
loath and despis her no that idea wa done withutterli done with
then what remain to her she would not fly with geoffrei sinc to
do so would be to ruin him she would not marri owen and not to do so
would still be to ruin geoffrei she wa no fool she wa innoc in
act but she knew that her innoc would inde be hard to proveeven
her own father did not believ in it and her sister would openli accus
her to the world what then should she do should she hide herself in
some remot halfcivilis place or in london it wa imposs she
had no monei and no mean of get ani besid thei would hunt
her out both owen davi and geoffrei would track her to the furthest
limit of the earth and would not the former think that geoffrei had
spirit her awai and at onc put hi threat into execut obvious
he would there wa no hope in that direct some other plan must be
found or her lover would still be ruin
so argu beatric still think not of herself but of geoffrei
of that belov on who wa more to her than all the world more a
thousand time than her own safeti or wellb perhap she overr
the matter owen davi ladi honoria and even elizabeth might have
done all thei threaten the first of them perhap the first two
of them certainli would have done so but still geoffrei might have
escap destruct public opinion or the sounder part of it is
sensibl enough hard to move in such a matter especi when the
person said to have been wrong is heart and soul on the side of him
who is said to have wrong her
moreov there might have been wai out of it of which she knew
noth but surround as she wa by threaten powersbi ladi
honoria threaten action in the court on on side by owen davi
threaten exposur on anoth by elizabeth readi and will to
give the most damn evid on the third to beatric the worst
consequ seem an absolut necessari sequenc then there wa her
own conscienc arrai against her thi particular charg wa a lie
but it wa not a lie that she love geoffrei and to her the two thing
seem veri much the same thing her wa not a mind to draw fine
distinct in such matter se posuit ut culpabilem she place
herself as guilti as the old court roll put it in miser latin
and thi sens of guilt disarm her she did not realis the enorm
differ recognis by the whole civilis world between thought and
act between dispos mind and inculp deed beatric look at the
question more from the scriptur point of view rememb that in
the bibl such fine divis ar expressli state to be distinct
without a differ
had she gone to geoffrei and told him her whole stori it is probabl
that he would have defi the conspiraci face it out and possibl
come off victori but with that deadli retic of which women
alon ar capabl thi she did not and would not do sweet love woman
that she wa she would not burden him with her sorrow she would bear
them alonelittl reckon that therebi she wa lai up a far far
heavier load for him to carri through all hi dai
so beatric accept the statement of the plaintiff attornei for
gospel truth and from that fals standpoint she drew her auguri
oh she wa weari how love wa the fall night see how it brood
on the sea and how clear were the watersther a fish pass by her
paddleand there the first start sprang into the sky if onli geoffrei
were here to see it with her geoffrei she had lost him she wa alon
in the world nowalon with the sea and the star well thei were
better than menbett than all men except on their wa a divin
companionship and it sooth her ah how hate had been elizabeth
face more hate even than the halfcraz cun of owen davi
when she stretch her hand toward her and call her a scarlet
woman it wa so like elizabeth thi mix up of bibl term with her
accus and after all perhap it wa truewhat wa it though thy
sin be as scarlet yet shall thei be white as snow but that wa onli
if on repent she did not repent not in the least conscienc it
is true reproach her with a breach of tempor and human law but her
heart cri that such love as she had given wa immort and divin and
therefor set beyond the littl bound of time and man at ani rate
she love geoffrei and wa proud and glad to love him the circumst
were unfortun but she did not make the world or it social
arrang ani more than she had made herself and she could not help
that the fact remain right or wrongsh love him love him
how clear were the water what wa that wild dream which she had
dreamt about herself sit at the bottom of the sea and wait for
himtil at last he came sit at the bottom of the seawhi did
it strike her so strangelywhat unfamiliar thought did it waken in her
mind well and why not it would be pleasant there better at ani rate
than on the earth but thing cannot be end so on is burden with
the flesh and on must wear it till it fail why must she wear it
wa not the sea larg enough to hide her bone look now she had but
to slip over the edg of the cano slip without a struggl into those
mighti arm and in a few short minut it would all be done and gone
she gasp as the thought struck home here wa the answer to her
question the same answer that is given to everi human troubl
to all earthli hope and fear and strive on stroke of that black
knife and everyth would be lost or found would it be so great a
thing to give her life for geoffreywhi she had well nigh done as much
when she had known him but an hour and now that he wa all in all
oh would it be so great a thing if she dieddi secretli swiftli
surelygeoffrei would be save thei would not troubl him then there
would be no on to troubl about owen davi could not marri her then
geoffrei could not ruin himself over her elizabeth could pursu her no
further it would be well to do thi thing for geoffrei and he would
alwai love her and beyond that black curtain there might be someth
better
thei said that it wa sin ye it might be sin to act thu for oneself
alon but to do it for anotherhow of that wa not the saviour whom
thei preach a man of sacrific would it be a sin in her to die for
geoffrei to sacrific herself that geoffrei might go free
oh it would be no great merit her life wa not so easi that she should
fear thi pure embrac it would be better far better than to marri
owen davi than to desecr their love and teach geoffrei to despis
her and how els could she ward thi troubl from him except by her
death or by a marriag that in her ey wa more dread than ani
death
she could not do it yet she could not die until she had onc more seen
hi face even though he did not see her no not tonight would
she seek thi swift solut she had word to sayor word to
writebefor the end alreadi thei rush in upon her mind
but if no better plan present itself she would do it she wa sure
that she would it wa a sinwel let it be a sin what did she care
if she sin for geoffrei he would not think the wors of her for it
and she had hope ye geoffrei had taught her to hope if there wa a
hell why it wa here and yet not all a hell for in it she had found
her love
it grew dark she could hear the whisper of the wave upon bryngelli
beach it grew dark the night wa close round she paddl to within
a few fathom of the shore and call in her clear voic
ay ay miss answer old edward from the beach come in on the next
wave
she came in accordingli and her cano wa caught and drag high and
dry
what miss beatric said the old man shake hi head and grumbl
at it again out all alon in that thing and he gave the cano a
contemptu kick and in the dark too you want a husband to look
after you you do youll never rest till your drown
no edward she answer with a littl laugh i dont suppos that i
shall there is no peac for the wick abov sea you know now do not
scold the cano is as safe as church in thi weather and in the bai
oh ye it safe enough in the calm and the bai he answer but
suppos it should come on to blow and suppos you should drift
beyond the shelter of rumbal point there and get the roller down on
youwhi you would be drown in five minut it wick miss that
what it is
beatric laugh again and went
she a funni on she is said the old man scratch hi head as he
look after her of all the woman folk as ever i know she is the
rummest i sometim think she want to get drown dash me if i
havent half a mind to stave a hole in the bottom of that there damn
cano and finish it
beatric reach home a littl befor supper time her first act wa
to call betti the servant and with her assist to shift her bed and
thing into the spare room with elizabeth she would have noth more
to do thei had slept togeth sinc thei were children now she had
done with her then she went in to supper and sat through it like a
statu speak no word her father and elizabeth kept up a strain
convers but thei did not speak to her nor she to them elizabeth
did not even ask where she had been nor take ani notic of her chang
of room
on thing howev beatric learnt her father wa go on the mondai
to hereford by an earli train to attend a meet of clergymen collect
to discuss the tith question he wa to return by the last train on
the tuesdai night that is about midnight beatric now discov
that elizabeth propos to accompani him evid she wish to see as
littl as possibl of her sister dure thi week of truceposs she
wa a littl afraid of her even elizabeth might have a conscienc
so she should be left alon from mondai morn till tuesdai night on
can do a good deal in forti hour
after supper beatric rose and left the room without a word and thei
were glad when she went she frighten them with her set face and
great calm ey but neither spoke to the other on the subject thei had
enter into a conspiraci of silenc
beatric lock her door and then sat at the window lost in thought
when onc the idea of suicid ha enter the mind it is apt to grow
with startl rapid she review the whole posit she went
over all the argument and search the moral horizon for some feasibl
avenu of escap but she could find none that would save geoffrei
except thi ye she would do it as mani anoth wretch woman had
done befor her not from cowardic inde for had she alon been
concern she would have face the thing out fight to the bitter
endbut for thi reason onli it would cut off the danger which
threaten geoffrei at their veri root and sourc of cours there must
be no scandal it must never be known that she had kill herself or
she might defeat her own object for the stori would be rake up but
she well knew how to avoid such a possibl in her extrem beatric
grew cun as a fox ye and there might be an inquest at which
awkward question would be ask but as she well knew also befor
an inquest can be held there must be someth to hold it on and that
someth would not be there
and so in the utter silenc of the night and in the loneli of her
chamber did beatric dedic herself to sacrific upon the altar of
her immeasur love she would face the last agoni of death when the
bloom of her youth strength and beauti wa but open as a rose in
june she would do more she would brave the threaten vengeanc of the
most high come befor him a self murderess and with but on plea for
pitythat she love so well quia multum amavit ye she would do
all thi would leav the warm world in the dawn summer of her dai
and alon go out into the darkalon would face those vision which
might comethos shape of terror and those thing of fear that
perchanc mai wait for sin human kind alon she would gooh hand
in hand with him it had been easi but thi must not be the door of
utter dark would swing to behind her and who could sai if in time
to come it should open to geoffrei follow feet or if he might ever
find the path that she had trod it must be done it should be done
beatric rose from her seat with bright ey and quickcom breath
and swore befor god if god there were that she would do it trust
to him for pardon and for piti or fail thesefor sleep
ye but first she must onc more look upon geoffrei dear faceand
then farewel
piti her poor mistaken woman make of her will a provid rush
to doom piti her but do not blame her overmuch or if you do then
blame judith and jephtha daughter and charlott cordai and all the
gloriou women who from time to time have risen on thi sordid world of
self and given themselv as an offer upon the altar of their love
their religion their honour or their countri
it wa finish now let her rest while she could see what wa
to come with a sigh for all that wa and all that might have been
beatric lai down and soon slept sweetli as a child
chapter xxvii
the hous of common
next dai wa sundai beatric did not go to church for on thing she
fear to see owen davi there but she took her sundai school class as
usual and long did the children rememb how kind and patient she wa
with them that dai and how beautifulli she told them the stori of
the jewish girl of long ago who went forth to die for the sake of her
father oath
nearli all the rest of the dai and even she spent in write that
which we shall read in timeonli in the late afternoon she went out for
a littl while in her cano anoth thing beatric did also she call
at the lodg of her assist the head school teacher and told
her it wa possibl that she would not be in her place on the tuesdai
mondai wa as it chanc a holidai if anybodi inquir as to her
absenc perhap she would kindli tell them that miss granger had an
appoint to keep and had taken a morn holidai in order to do
so she should howev be back that afternoon the teacher assent
without suspicion remark that if beatric could not take a morn
holidai she wa sure she did not know who could
next morn thei breakfast veri earli becaus mr granger and
elizabeth had to catch the train beatric sat through the meal in
silenc her calm ey look straight befor her and the other
gaze on them and at the love inscrut face felt an indefin
fear creep into their heart what did thi woman mean to do that wa
the question thei ask of themselv though not of each other that
she meant to do someth thei were sure for there wa purpos written
on everi line of her cold face
suddenli as thei sat think and make pretenc to eat a thought
flash like an arrow into beatric heart and pierc it thi wa
the last meal that thei could ever take togeth thi wa the last time
that she could ever see her father and her sister face for her
sister well it might passfor there ar some thing which even a
woman like beatric can never quit forgivebut she love her father

elizabeth made no answer thei were near the station for her father

silenc nor did he allud to the matter ani more
when thei were gone beatric set about her own prepar her wild
purpos wa to travel to london and catch a glimps of geoffrei face
in the hous of common if possibl and then return she put on her

thrust the letter which she had written on the previou dai a small
handbag with some sandwich and a brush and comb in it and a cloak
made up the total of her baggag
the train which did not stop at bryngelli left co at ten and co

porter to follow pra street till she reach the edgwar road then to

ey for beauti in distress had been stand close to her talk to
a constitu the constitu had depart to wherev constitu

local suitabl to the genu at least in their judgmentand the
member had overheard the convers and seen beatric ey fill with

mr everston answer beatric take the first that came into her
head the member look a littl disappoint he had vagu hope that
thi love creatur wa unappropri sure her marriag could not
be satisfactori or she would not look so sad
then came more stair and passag and formal till present
beatric found herself in a kind of birdcag crowd to suffoc
with everi sort of ladi
im afraidi am veri much afraid began her newfound friend
survei the mass with dismai
but at that moment a stout ladi in front feel faint with the heat
wa forc to leav the galleri and almost befor she knew where she
wa beatric wa instal in her place her friend had bow and
vanish and she wa left to all purpos alon for she never
heed those about her though some of them look at her hard enough
wonder at her form and beauti and who she might be
she cast her ey down over the crowd hous and saw a vision of hat
collar and leg and heard a tumult of sound the sharp voic of
a speaker who wa rapidli lose hi temper the plaudit of the
govern bench the interrupt from the oppositiony even
yell and hoot and nois that remind her remot of the crow
of cock possibl had she thought of it beatric would not have been
greatli impress with the digniti of an assembl at the door of
which so mani of it member seem to leav their manner with their
overcoat and stick it might even have suggest the idea of a bear
garden to her mind but she simpli did not think about it she search
the hous keenli enough but it wa to find on face and on onlyah
there he wa
and now the hous of common might vanish into the bottomless abyss
and take with it the hous of lord and what remain of the british
constitut and she would never miss them for at the best of time
beatricein common with most of her sexin all gratitud be it said
wa not an ardent politician
there geoffrei sat hi arm foldedth hat push slightli from hi
forehead so that she could see hi face there wa her own belov
whom she had come so far to see and whom tomorrow she would dare
so much to save how sad he lookedh did not seem to be pai
much attent to what wa go on she knew well enough that he wa
think of her she could feel it in her head as she had often felt it
befor but she dare not let her mind go out to him in answer for if
onc she did so she knew also that he would discov her so she sat
and fed her ey upon hi face take her farewel of it while round
her and beneath her the hum of the hous went on as ever present and
as unnot as the hum of bee upon a summer noon
present the gentleman who had been so kind to her sat down in
the next seat to geoffrei and began to whisper to him as he did so
glanc onc or twice toward the grate behind which she wa
she guess that he wa tell him the stori of the ladi who wa so
unaccount anxiou to hear the debat and how pretti she wa but it
did not seem to interest geoffrei much and beatric wa feminin enough
to notic it and to be glad of it in her gentl jealousi she did not
like to think of geoffrei as be interest in account of mysteri
ladi howev pretti
at length a speaker rosesh understood from the murmur of those around
her that he wa on of the leader of the opposit and commenc a
power and bitter speech she notic that geoffrei rous himself at
thi point and began to listen with attent
look said on of the ladi near her mr bingham is take note
he is go to speak nexth speak wonderfulli you know thei sai
that he is as good as anybodi in the hous except gladston and lord
randolph
oh answer anoth ladi ladi honoria is not here is she i dont
see her
no repli the first she is a dear creatur and so handsom
toojust the wife for a rise manbut i dont think that she take
much interest in polit ar not her dinner charm
at thi moment a vollei of applaus from the opposit bench drown
the murmur convers
thi speaker spoke for about threequart of an hour and then at last
geoffrei stood up on or two other member rose at the same time but
ultim thei gave wai
he began slowlyand somewhat tame as it seem to beatric whose
heart wa in her mouthbut when he had been speak for about five
minut he warm up and then began on of the most remark
orator displai of that parliament geoffrei had spoken well befor
and would speak well again but perhap he never spoke so well as he
did upon that night for nearli an hour and a half he held the hous in
chain even the hoot and interrupt di awai toward the end of
hi orat hi power presenc seem to tower in the place like
that of a giant among pigmi and hi dark handsom face lit with the
fire of eloqu shone like a lamp he lean forward with a slight
stoop of hi broad shoulder and address himself nomin to the
speaker but realli to the opposit he took their fact on by on
and with convinc logic show that thei were no fact amid a hiss of
anger he pulveris their argument and demonstr their motiv then
suddenli he drop them altogeth and address himself to the hous
at larg and the countri beyond the hous he struck anoth note and
broke out into that storm of patriot eloqu which confirm hi
grow reput both in parliament and in the constitu
beatric shut her ey and listen to the deep rich voic as it rose
from height to height and power to power till the whole place seem
full of it and everi contend sound wa hush
suddenli after an invoc that would have been passion had it
not been so restrain and strong he stop she open her ey and
look geoffrei wa seat as befor with hi hat on he had been
speak for an hour and a half and yet to her it seem but a few
minut sinc he rose then broke out a vollei of cheer in the midst
of which a leader of the opposit rose to repli not in the veri best
of temper for geoffrei speech had hit them hard
he began howev by compliment the honour member on hi
speech as fine a speech as he had listen to for mani year though
unfortun made from a mistaken standpoint and the wrong side of
the hous then he twit the govern with not have secur
the servic of a man so infinit abler than the major of their
item and excit a good deal of amus by state with some
sarcast humour that should it ever be hi lot to occupi the front
treasuri bench he should certainli make a certain propos to the
honour member after thi goodnatur badinag he drift off into
the consider of the question under discuss and beatric paid no
further attent to him but occupi herself in watch geoffrei drop
back into the same appar state of cold indiffer from which the
necess of action had arous him
present the gentleman who had found her the seat came up and spoke to
her ask her how she wa get on veri soon he began to speak of
geoffrei speech sai that it wa on of the most brilliant of the
session if not the most brilliant
then mr bingham is a rise man i suppos beatric said
rise i should think so he answer thei will get him into
the govern on the first opportun after thi he too good to
neglect veri few men can come to the fore like mr bingham we call him
the comet and if onli he doe not make a mess of hi chanc by
do someth foolish there is no reason why he should not be
attorneygener in a few year
why should he do anyth foolish she ask
oh for no reason on earth that i know of onli as i daresai you have
notic men of thi sort ar veri apt to do ridicul thing throw
up their career get into a public scandal run awai with somebodi or
someth not that there should be ani fear of such a thing where mr
bingham is concern for he ha a charm wife and thei sai that she
is a great help to him why there is the divis bell goodby mr

beatric shook her head i cannot she answer smile sadli i
am go on a long journei tomorrow and i shall not return here
goodby
in anoth second he wa gone more piqu and interest about thi
fair unknown than he had been about ani woman for year who could she
be and why wa she so anxiou to hear the debat there wa a mysteri
in it somewher and he determin to solv it if he could
meanwhil the divis took place and present the member flock
back and amidst ring ministeri cheer and counter opposit
cheer the victori of the govern wa announc then came the usual
formal and the member began to melt awai beatric saw the leader
of the hous and sever member of the govern go up to geoffrei
shake hi hand and congratul him then with on long look she
turn and went leav him in the moment of hi triumph that seem
to interest him so littl but which made beatric more proud at heart
than if she had been declar empress of the world
oh it wa well to love a man like that a man born to tower over
hi fellow menand well to die for him could she let her miser
exist interfer with such a life as hi should be never never
there should be no public scandal on her account
she drew her veil over her face and inquir the wai from the hous
present she wa outsid by on of the gatewai and in the shadow of
it pillar she stop watch the member of the hous stream past
her mani of them were talk togeth and onc or twice she caught
the sound of geoffrei name coupl with such word as splendid
speech and other term of admir
move on move on said a policeman to her lift her veil beatric
turn and look at him and mutter someth he move on himself
leav her in peac present she saw geoffrei and the gentleman who
had been so kind to her walk along togeth thei came through the
gatewai the lappet of hi coat brush her arm and he never saw her
closer she crouch against the pillar hide herself in it shadow
within six feet of her geoffrei stop and lit a cigar the light of
the match flare upon hi face that dark strong face she love so
well how tire he look a great long took possess of her to
step forward and speak to him but she restrain herself almost by
forc
her friend wa speak to him and about her
such a love woman he wa sai with the clearest and most
beauti grei ey that i ever saw but she ha gone like a dream i
cant find her anywher it is a most mysteri busi
you ar fall in love tom answer geoffrei absent as he threw
awai the match and walk on dont do that it is an unhappi thing to
do and he sigh
he wa go oh heaven she would never never see him more a cold
horror seiz upon beatric her blood seem to stagnat she trembl
so much that she could scarc stand lean forward she look after
him with such a face of woe that even the policeman who had repent
him of hi forbear and wa return to send her awai stood
astonish the two men had gone about ten yard when someth
induc beatric friend to look back hi ey fell upon the white
agonystricken face now in the full glare of the ga lamp
beatric saw him turn and understood her danger oh goodby
geoffrei she murmur for a second allow her heart to go forth
toward him then realis what she had done she drop her veil
and went swiftli the gentleman call tomsh never learnt hi
namestood for a moment dumbfound and at that instant geoffrei
stagger as though he had been struck by a shot turn quit white
and halt
why said hi companion there is that ladi again we must have
pass quit close to her she wa look after us i saw her face in
the gaslightand i never want to see such anoth
geoffrei seiz him by the arm where is she he ask and what wa

lost her nowi fanci she went toward the railwai station but i could
not see stop is that she and he point to a tall person walk
toward the abbei
quickli thei move to intercept her but the result wa not
satisfactori and thei retreat hastili from the object of their
attent
meanwhil beatric found herself opposit the entranc to the
westminst bridg station a hansom wa stand there she got into it
and told the man to drive to paddington
befor the pair had retrac their step she wa gone she ha
vanish again said tom and went on to give a descript of her to
geoffrei of her dress he had unfortun taken littl note it might
be on of beatric or it might not it seem almost inconceiv to
geoffrei that she should be masquerad about london under the name of
mr everston and yetand yeth could have swornbut it wa folli
suddenli he bade hi friend goodnight and took a hansom the mysteri
thicken said the astonish tom as he watch him drive awai
i would give a hundr pound to find out what it all mean oh that
woman faceit haunt me it look like the face of an angel bid
farewel to heaven
but he never did find out ani more about it though the despair ey
of beatric as she bade her mute farewel still sometim haunt hi
sleep
geoffrei reflect rapidli the thing wa ridicul and yet it wa
possibl beyond that brief line in answer to hi letter he had heard
noth from beatric inde he wa wait to hear from her befor
take ani further step but even suppos she were in london where
wa he to look for her he knew that she had no monei he could not
stai there long it occur to him there wa a train leav euston for
wale about four in the morn it wa just possibl that she might
be in town and return by thi train he told the cabman to drive to
euston station and on arriv close question a sleepi porter but
without satisfactori result
then he search the station there were no trace of beatric he did
more he sat down weari as he wa and wait for an hour and a
half till it wa time for the train to start there were but three
passeng and none of them in the least resembl beatric
it is veri strang geoffrei said to himself as he walk awai i
could have sworn that i felt her presenc just for on second it must
have been nonsens thi is what come of occult influenc and that
kind of thing the occult is a nuisanc
if he had onli gone to paddington
chapter xxviii
i will wait for you
beatric drove back to paddington and as she drove though her face did
not chang from it marbl cast of woe the great tear roll down it
on by on
thei reach the desertedlook station and she paid the man out of
her few remain shillingsse that she wa a stranger he insist
upon receiv halfacrown then disregard the astonish stare
of a night porter she found her wai to the wait room and sat down
first she took the letter from her breast and ad some line to it
in pencil but she did not post it yet she knew that if she did so
it would reach it destin too soon then she laid her head back
against the wall and utterli outworn drop to sleepher last sleep
upon thi earth befor the longest sleep of all
and thu beatric wait and slept at paddington while her lover wait
and watch at euston
at five she woke and the heavi cloud of sorrow past present and to
come rush in upon her heart take her bag she made herself as tidi
as she could then she step outsid the station into the desert
street and find a space between the hous watch the sun rise
over the wake world it wa her last sunris beatric rememb
she came back fill with such thought as might well strike the heart
of a woman about to do the thing she had decre the refresh bar
wa open now and she went to it and bought a cup of coffe and some
bread and butter then she took her ticket not to bryngelli or to co
but to the station on thi side of bryngelli and three mile from it
she would run less risk of be notic there the train wa shunt
up she took her seat in it just as it wa start an earli newspap
boi came along yawn beatric bought a copi of the standard out
of the on and threepenc that wa left of her monei and open it at
the sheet contain the lead articl the first on began the
most power close reason and eloqu speech made last night by
mr bingham the member for pillham will we feel certain produc as
great an effect on the countri as it did in the hous of common we
welcom it not onli on account of it valu as a contribut to the
polem of the irish question but as a posit proof of what ha
alreadi been suspect that the unionist parti ha in mr bingham a
young statesman of a veri high order inde and on whom remark and
rapid success at the bar ha not hamper as is too often the case in
the larger and less technic field of polit
and so on beatric put the paper down with a smile of triumph
geoffrei success wa splendid and unquest noth could stop
him now dure all the long journei she pleas her imagin by
conjur up pictur after pictur of that great futur of hi in which
she would have no share and yet he would not forget her she wa sure
of thi her shadow would go with him from year to year even to the
end and at time he might think how proud she would have been could she
be present to record hi triumph ala she did not rememb that when
all is lost which can make life beauti when the sun ha set and
the spirit gone out of the dai the poor garish light of our littl
victori can but ill aton for the glori that have been happi
and content ar frail plant which can onli flourish under fair
condit if at all certainli thei will not thrive beneath the gloom
and shadow of a pall and when the heart is dead no triumph howev
splendid and no reward howev great can compens for an utter and
irredeem loss she never guess poor girl that time upon time in
the decad to be geoffrei would gladli have laid hi honour down in
payment for on year of her dear and unforgotten presenc she wa too
unselfish she did not think that a man could thu prize a woman
love and took it for an axiom that to succe in life wa hi on real
objecta thing to which so divin a gift as she had given geoffrei is
as noth it wa therefor thi juggernaut of her lover career that
beatric would cast down her life littl know that therebi she must
turn the worldli and tempor success which he alreadi held so cheap
to bitter and ash
at chester beatric got out of the train and post her letter to
geoffrei she would not do so till then becaus it might have reach
him too soonbefor all wa finish now it would be deliv to him
in the hous after everyth had been accomplish in it order she
look at the letter it wa she thought the last token that could
ever pass between them on thi earth onc she press it to her heart
onc she touch it with her lip and then put it from her beyond
recal it wa done there wa no go back now and even as she stood
the postman came up whistl and open the box carelessli swept it
content into hi canva bag could he have known what lai among them he
would have whistl no more that dai
beatric continu her journei and by three oclock arriv safe at
the littl station next to bryngelli there wa a fair at co that dai
and mani peopl of the peasant class got in here amidst the confus
she gave up her ticket to a small boi who wa look the other wai at
the time and escap without be notic by a soul inde thing
happen so that nobodi in the neighbourhood of bryngelli ever knew that
beatric had been to london and back upon those dread dai
beatric walk along the cliff and in an hour wa at the door of
the vicarag from which she seem to have been awai for year she
unlock it and enter in the letterbox wa a postcard from her
father state that he and elizabeth had chang their plan and would
not be back till the train which arriv at halfpast eight on the

beatric inquiri
when she had eaten what she couldit wa not muchbeatric went to her
room undress herself bath and put on clean fresh thing then
she unbound her love hair and did it up in a coronet upon her head
it wa a fashion that she did not often adopt becaus it took too much
time but on thi dai of all dai she had a strang fanci to look
her best also her hair had been done like thi on the afternoon when
geoffrei first met her next she put on the grei dress onc more which
she had worn on her journei to london and take the silver roman ring

beatric gave it back to the weep parent and went her wai what a
splendid creatur said the doctor to himself as he look after her
she ha ey like fate and the face of motherhood incarn a great
woman if ever i saw on but differ from other women
meanwhil beatric made her wai to old edward boatsh as she
expect there wa nobodi there and nobodi on the beach old edward
and hi son were at tea with the rest of bryngelli thei would come
back after dark and lock up the boathous
she look at the sea there were no wave but the breez freshen
everi minut and there wa a long slow swell upon the water the
roller would be run beyond the shelter of rumbal point five mile
awai
the tide wa high it mount to within ten yard of the end of the
boathous she open the door and drag out her cano close
the door again after her the craft wa light and she wa strong for a
woman close to the boathous on of the timber breakwat which
ar common at seasid place ran down into the water she drag the
cano to it side and then push it down the beach till it bow wa
afloat next mount on the breakwat she caught hold of the littl
chain in the bow and walk along the timber baulk pull with all
her forc till the cano wa quit afloat on she went drag it
after her till the wave wash over the breakwat wet her shoe
then she brought the cano quit close and watch her opportun
step into it nearli fall into the water as she did so but she
recov her balanc and sat down in anoth minut she wa paddl
out to sea with all her strength
for twenti minut or more she paddl unceasingli then she rest
awhil onli keep the cano head on to the sea which without be
rough wa run more and more freshli there some mile awai wa
the dark mass of rumbal point she must be off it befor the night
close in there would be sea enough there no such craft as her could
live in it for five minut and the tide wa on the turn anyth
sink in those water would be carri far awai and never come back
to the shore of wale
she turn her head and look at bryngelli and the long familiar
stretch of cliff how fair it seem bath in the quiet light of
summer afternoon oh wa there ani afternoon where the child had gone
and where she wa follow fastor wa it all night black etern
night unbroken by the dram of dear rememb thing
there were the dog rock where she had stood on that misti autumn
dai and seen the vision of her coffin mother face sure it wa a
presag of her fate there beyond wa the bell rock where in that same
hour geoffrei and she had met and behind it wa the amphitheatr where
thei had told their love hark what wa that sound peal faintli at
interv across the deep it wa the great ship bell that stir
from time to time by the wash of the high tide solemnli toll her
pass soul
she paddl on the sound of that deathknel shook her nerv and made
her feel faint and weak oh it would have been easier had she been as
she wa a year ago befor she learn to love and hand in hand had
seen faith and hope rearis from the depth of her stir soul then
be but a heathen she could have met her end with all a heathen
strength know what she lost and believ too that she would
find but sleep and now it wa otherwis for in her heart she did not
believ that she wa about utterli to perish what could the bodi live
on in a thousand form chang inde but indestruct and immort
while the spiritu part with all it hope and love and fear melt
into nothing it could not be sure on some new shore she should
onc again greet her love and if it wa not how would thei meet her
in that under world come selfmurd her lifeblood on her hand
would her mother turn awai from her and the littl brother whom she
had love would he reject her and what voic of doom might strike her
into everlast hopeless
but be the sin what it might yet would she sin it for the sake of
geoffrei ay even if she must reap a harvest of etern woe she bent
her head and prai oh power that art abov from whom i come to
whom i go have merci on me oh spirit if inde thy name is love
weigh my love in thy balanc and let it lift the scale of sin oh god
of sacrific be not wroth at my deed of sacrific and give me pardon
give me life and peac that in a time to come i mai win the sight of
him for whom i die
a somewhat heathenish prayer inde and far too full of human passion
for on about to leav the human shore but thenwel it wa
beatric who prayedbeatric who could realis no heaven beyond the
limit of her passion who still thought more of her love than of save
her own soul aliv perhap it found a homeperhap like her who
prai it it wa lost upon the pitiless deep
then beatric prai no more short wa her time see there sank the
sun in glori and there the great roller swept along past the sullen
headland where the undertow met wind and tide she would think no more
of self it wa it seem to her so small thi mendic call on
the unseen not for other but for self aid for self wellb for
self salvat for selfthi do of good that good might come to
self she had made her prayer and if she prai again it should be for
geoffrei that he might prosper and be happythat he might forgiv the
troubl her love had brought into hi life that he might forget her she
could not prai she had prai her prayer and said her sai and it wa
done with let her be judg as it seem good to those who judg now
she would fix her thought upon her love and by it strength would she
triumph over the bitter of death her ey flash and her breast
heav further out to sea further yetsh would meet those roller
a knot or more from the point of the headland that no record might
remain
wa it her wrong if she love him she could not help it and she wa
proud to love him even now she would not undo the past what were
the line that geoffrei had read to her thei haunt her mind with a
strang persistencethei took time to the beat of her fall paddl
and would not leav her
of onc sown seed who knoweth what the crop is
ala my love love ey ar veri blind
what would thei have us do sunflow and poppi
stoop to the wind

ye ye love ey ar veri blind but in their blind there wa
more light than in all other earthli thing oh she could not live for
him and with himit wa deni to herbut she still could die for
him her darl her darl

the second letter wa a dummi that is to sai it purport to be such an
epistl as ani young ladi might have written to a gentleman friend
it began dear mr bingham and end your sincer beatric
granger wa fill with chitchat and express hope that he would
be abl to come down to bryngelli again later in the summer when thei
would go cano
it wa obviou thought beatric that if geoffrei wa accus by owen
davi or anybodi els of be concern with her mysteri end the
product of such a frank epistl written two dai previous would
demonstr the absurd of the idea poor beatric she wa full of
precaut
let him who mai imagin the effect produc upon geoffrei by thi
heartrend and astound epistl could beatric have seen hi face
when he had finish read it she would never have commit suicid
in a minut it becam like that of an old man as the whole truth sank
into hi mind such an agoni of horror of remors of unavail woe
and hopeless swept across hi soul that for a moment he thought hi
vital forc must give wai beneath it and that he should die as inde
in thi dark hour he would have rejoic to do oh how piti it
washow piti and how aw to think of thi love so passion
pure wast on hi own unworthi to think of thi divin woman
go down to lone death for hima strong man to pictur her
crouch behind that gatewai pillar and touch him as he pass
while he the thrice accurs fool knew noth till too late to
know that he had gone to euston and not to paddington to rememb the
matchless strength and beauti of the love which he had lost and that
face which he should never see again sure hi heart would break no
man could bear it
and of those coward who hound her to death if inde she wa alreadi
dead oh he would kill owen daviesy and elizabeth too were it not
that she wa a woman and as for honoria he had done with her scandal
what did he care for scandal if he had hi will there should be a
scandal inde for he would beat thi owen davi thi reptil who
did not hesit to us a woman terror to prosper the fulfil of
hi lusty and then drag him to the contin and kill him there
onli vengeanc wa left to him
stop he must not give wayperhap she wa not deadperhap that
horribl presag of evil which had struck him like a storm wa but a
dream could he telegraph no it wa too late the offic at bryngelli
would be closedit wa past eight now but he could go there wa a
train leav a littl after nineh should be there by halfpast six
tomorrow and effi wa illwel sure thei could look after her for
twentyfour hour she wa in no danger and he must gohe could not
bear thi tortur suspens great god how had she done the deed
geoffrei snatch a sheet of paper and tri to write he could not hi
hand shook so with a groan he rose and go to the refresh room
swallow two glass of brandi on after anoth the spirit took
effect on him he could write now rapidli he scribbl on a sheet of
paper
