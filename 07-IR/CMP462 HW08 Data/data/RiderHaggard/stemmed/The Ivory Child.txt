chapter i
allan give a shoot lesson
now i allan quatermain come to the stori of what wa perhap on of
the strangest of all the adventur which have befallen me in the cours
of a life that so far can scarc be call tame or humdrum
amongst mani other thing it tell of the war against the black kendah
peopl and the dead of jana their eleph god often sinc then i
have wonder if thi creatur wa or wa not anyth more than a mere
gigant beast of the forest it seem improb even imposs but
the reader of futur dai mai judg of thi matter for himself
also he can form hi opinion as to the religion of the white kendah and
their pretens to a certain degre of magic skill of thi magic
i will make onli on remark if it exist at all it wa by no mean
infal to take a singl instanc hart and mart were convinc
by divin that i and i onli could kill jana which wa why thei
invit me to kendahland yet in the end it wa han who kill him
jana nearli kill me
now to my tale
in anoth histori call the holi flower i have told how i came to
england with a young gentleman of the name of scroop partli to see him
safe home after a hunt accid and partli to try to dispos of
a uniqu orchid for a friend of mine call brother john by the white
peopl and dogeetah by the nativ who wa popularli suppos to be
mad but in fact wa veri sane inde so sane wa he that he pursu
what seem to be an absolut desper quest for over twenti year
until with some humbl assist on my part he brought it to a
curious success issu but all thi tale is told in the holi
flower and i onli allud to it here that is at present to explain
how i came to be in england
while in thi countri i stai for a few dai with scroop or rather
with hi fianc and her peopl at a fine hous in essex i call it
essex to avoid the place be identifi but realli it wa on of the
neighbour counti dure my visit i wa taken to see a much finer
place a splendid old castl with brick gatewai tower that had been
wonderfulli well restor and turn into a most luxuri modern
dwell let us call it ragnal the seat of a baron of that name
i had heard a good deal about lord ragnal who accord to all
account seem a kind of admir crichton he wa said to be
wonderfulli handsom a great scholarh had taken a doubl first at
colleg a great athleteh had been captain of the oxford boat at the
univers race a veri promis speaker who had alreadi made hi mark
in the hous of lord a sportsman who had shot tiger and other larg
game in india a poet who had publish a success volum of vers
under a pseudonym a good solid until he left the servic and lastli
a man of enorm wealth own in addit to hi estat sever
coal mine and an entir town in the north of england
dear me i said when the list wa finish he seem to have been
born with a whole case of gold spoon in hi mouth i hope on of them
will not choke him ad perhap he will be unlucki in love
that just where he is most lucki of all answer the young ladi to
whom i wa talkingit wa scroop fianc miss mannersfor he is
engag to a ladi that i am told is the loveliest sweetest cleverest
girl in all england and thei absolut ador each other
dear me i repeat i wonder what fate ha got up it sleev for
lord ragnal and hi perfect ladylov
i wa doom to find out on dai
so it came about that when on the follow morn i wa ask if
i would like to see the wonder of ragnal castl i answer ye
realli howev i want to have a look at lord ragnal himself if
possibl for the account of hi mani perfect had impress the
imagin of a poor colonist like myself who had never found an
opportun of set hi ey upon a kind of human angel human devil
i had met in plenti but never a singl angelat least of the male
sex also there wa alwai the possibl that i might get a glimps
of the still more angel ladi to whom he wa engag whose name
i understood wa the hon miss holm so i said that noth would
pleas me more than to see thi castl
thither we drove accordingli through the fine frosti air for the month
wa decemb on reach the castl mr scroop wa told that lord
ragnal whom he knew well wa out shoot somewher in the park but
that of cours he could show hi friend over the place so we went
in the three of us for miss manner to whom scroop wa to be marri
veri shortli had driven us over in her poni carriag the porter at the
gatewai tower took us to the main door of the castl and hand us over
to anoth man whom he address as mr savag whisper to me that
he wa hi lordship person attend
i rememb the name becaus it seem to me that i had never seen
anyon who look much less savag in truth hi appear wa that
of a duke in disguis as i imagin duke to be for i never set ey
on on hi dressh wore a black morn cutawai coatwa faultless
hi manner were exquisit polit to the verg of ironi but with a
hint of haughti pride in the background he wa handsom also with a
fine nose and a hawklik ey while a touch of bald ad to the
gener effect hi ag mai have been anyth between thirtyf and
forti and the wai he depriv me of my hat and stick to which i
strove to cling show i thought resolut of charact probabl i
reflect to myself he consid me an unusu sort of person who might
damag the pictur and other object of art with the stick and not
see hi wai how to ask me to give it up without suggest suspicion
ha hit upon the expedi of take my hat also
in after dai mr samuel savag inform me that i wa quit right
in thi surmis he said he thought that judg from my somewhat
unconvent appear i might be on of the danger class of whom
he had been read in the paper name a hanarchist i write the
word as he pronounc it for here come the curiou thing thi man
so flawless so well instruct in some respect had a fault which gave
everyth awai hi hs were uncertain three of them would come quit
right but the fourth let us sai would be conspicu either by
it utter absenc or by it unwant appear he could speak when
describ the ragnal pictur in rotund and flow period that
would scarc have disgrac the pen of gibbon then suddenli that
h would appear or disappear and the illus wa over it wa like a
sudden shock of cold water down the back i never discov the origin
of hi famili it wa a matter of which he did not speak perhap
becaus he wa vagu about it himself but if an earl of norman blood
had marri a handsom cocknei kitchenmaid of nativ abil i can
quit imagin that samuel savag might have been a child of the union
for the rest he wa a good man and a faith on for whom i have a
high respect
on thi occas he conduct us round the castl or rather it more
public room show us mani treasur and i should think at least
two hundr pictur by emin and depart artist which gave him an
opportun of exhibit a peculiar if somewhat errat knowledg of
histori to tell the truth i began to wish that it were a littl less
full in detail sinc on a decemb dai those larg apart felt
uncommonli cold scroop and miss manner seem to keep warm perhap
with the inward fire of mutual admir but as i had no on to
admir except mr savag a temperatur of about 35 degre produc it
natur effect upon me
at length we took a short cut from the larg to the littl galleri
through a warm and comfort room which i understood wa lord
ragnal studi halt for a moment by on of the fire i observ
a pictur on the wall over which a curtain wa drawn and ask mr
savag what it might be
that sir he repli with a kind of haughti reserv is the portrait
of her futur ladyship which hi lordship keep for hi privat hey
miss manner snigger and i said
oh thank you what an illomen kind of thing to do
then observ through an open door the hall in which my hat had been
taken from me i linger and as the other vanish in the littl
galleri slip into it recov my belong and pass out to
the garden purpos to walk there till i wa warm again and scroop
reappear while i march up and down a terrac on which i rememb
sever veri coldlook peacock were seat like conscienti
bird that knew it wa their duti to be ornament howev low the
temperatur i heard some shot fire appar in a clump of ilex
oak which grew about five hundr yard awai and reflect to myself
that thei seem to be those of a small rifl not of a shotgun
my curios be excit as to what wa to be an almost profession
matter i walk toward the grove make a circuit through a
shrubberi at length i found myself near to the edg of a glade and
perceiv stand behind the shelter of a magnific ilex two men
on of these wa a young keeper and the other from hi appear
i felt sure must be lord ragnal himself certainli he wa a
splendidlook man veri tall veri broad veri handsom with a
peak beard a kind and charm face and larg dark ey he wore a
cloak upon hi shoulder which wa thrown back from over a velvet coat
and except for the light doublebarrel rifl in hi hand look
exactli like a pictur by van dyck which mr savag had just inform me
wa that of on of hi lordship ancestor of the time of charl i
stand behind anoth oak i observ that he wa try to shoot
woodpigeon as thei descend to feed upon the acorn for which the
hard weather had made them greedi from time to time these beauti
blue bird appear and hover a moment befor thei settl whereon
the sportsman fire andthei flew awai bang bang went the
doublebarrel rifl and off fled the pigeon
damn said the sportsman in a pleasant laugh voic that the
twelfth i have miss charl
you hit hi tail my lord i saw a feather come out but my lord as
i told you there aint no man live what can kill pigeon on the wing
with a bullet even when thei seem to sit still in the air
i have heard of on charl mr scroop ha a friend from africa
stai with him who he swear could knock over four out of six
then my lord mr scroop ha a friend what li repli charl as
he hand him the second rifl
thi wa too much for me i step forward rais my hat polit
and said
sir forgiv me for interrupt you but you ar not shoot at those
woodpigeon in the right wai although thei seem to hover just befor
thei settl thei ar drop much faster than you think your keeper
wa mistaken when he said that you knock a feather out of the tail of
that last bird at which you fire two barrel in both case you shot at
least a foot abov it and what fell wa a leaf from the ilex tree
there wa a moment silenc which wa broken by charl who
ejacul in a thick voic
well of all the cheek
lord ragnal howev for it wa he look first angri and then
amus
sir he said i thank you for your advic which no doubt is
excel for it is certainli true that i have miss everi pigeon
which i tri to shoot with these confound littl rifl but if you
could demonstr in practic what you so kindli set out in precept the
valu of your counsel would be enhanc
thu he spoke mimick i have no doubt for he had a sens of
humour the manner of my address which nervous had made somewhat
pompou
give me the rifl i answer take off my greatcoat
he hand it me with a bow
mind what you ar about growl charl that there thing is full
cock and airtrigg
i wither or rather tri to wither him with a glanc but thi
unbeliev keeper onli stare back at me with insol in hi round
and birdlik ey never befor had i felt quit so angri with a
menial then a horribl doubt struck me suppos i should miss i knew
veri littl of the manner of flight of english woodpigeon which
ar not difficult to miss with a bullet and noth at all of these
particular rifl though a glanc at them show me that thei were
exquisit weapon of their sort and by a great maker if i muf
the thing now how should i bear the scorn of charl and the polit
amus of hi nobl master almost i prai that no more pigeon
would put in an appear and thu that the issu of my suppos skill
might be left in doubt
but thi wa not to be these bird came from far in on or two to
search for their favourit food and the fact that other had been
scare awai did not caus them to ceas from come present i heard
charl mutter
now then look out guvnor here your chanc of teach hi
lordship how to do it though he doe happen to be the best shot in
these counti
while he spoke two pigeon appear on a littl behind the other
come down veri straight as thei reach the open in the ilex grove
thei hover prepar to alight for of us thei could see noth on
at a distanc of about fifti and the other of sai seventi yard awai
i took the nearest got on to it allow for the drop and the angl
and touch the trigger of the rifl which fell to my shoulder veri
sweetli the bullet struck that pigeon on the crop out of which fell a
shower of acorn that it had been eat as it sank to the ground stone
dead number two pigeon realiz danger began to mount upward almost
straight i fire the second barrel and by good luck shot it head
off then i snatch the other rifl which charl had been load
automat from hi outstretch hand for at that moment i saw two
more pigeon come at the first i risk a difficult shot and hit it
far back knock out it tail but bring it still flutter to
the ground the other too i cover but when i touch the trigger
there wa a click no more
thi wa my opportun of come even with charl and i avail
myself of it
young man i said while he gape at me openmouth you should
learn to be care with rifl which ar danger weapon if you
give on to a shooter that is not load it show that you ar capabl
of anyth
then i turn and address lord ragnal ad
i must apolog for that third shot of mine which wa infam for
i commit a similar fault to that against which i warn you sir
and did not fire far enough ahead howev it mai serv to show your
attend the differ between the tail of a pigeon and an oak leaf
and i point to on of the feather of the poor bird which wa still
drift to the ground
well if thi here snipe of a chap aint the devil in boot exclaim
charl to himself
but hi master cut him short with a look then lift hi hat to me and
said
sir the practic much surpass the precept which is unusu i
congratul you upon a skill that almost partak of the marvel
unless inde chanc and he stop
it is natur that you should think so i repli but if more
pigeon come and mr charl will make sure that he load the rifl i
hope to undec you
at thi moment howev a loud shout from scroop who wa look for
me reinforc by a shrill cry utter by miss manner banish everi
pigeon within half a mile a fact of which i wa not sorri sinc who
know whether i should have it all or ani of the next three bird
i think my friend ar call me so i will bid you good morn i
said awkwardli
on moment sir he exclaim might i first ask you your name mine
is ragnalllord ragnal
and mine is allan quatermain i said
oh he answer that explain matter charl thi is mr
scroop friend the gentleman that you saidexagger i think you
had better apolog
but charl wa gone to pick up the pigeon i suppos
at thi moment scroop and the young ladi appear have heard our
voic and a gener explan ensu
mr quatermain ha been give me a lesson in shoot pigeon on the
wing with a smallbor rifl said lord ragnal point to the dead
bird that still lai upon the ground
he is compet to do that said scroop
painfulli compet repli hi lordship if you dont believ me
ask the underkeep
it is the onli thing i can do i explain modestli rifleshoot
is my trade and i have made a habit of practis at bird on the wing
with ball i have no doubt that with a shotgun your lordship would
leav me nowher for that is a game at which i have had littl
practic except when shoot for the pot in africa
ye interrupt scroop you wouldnt have ani chanc at that
allan against on of the finest shot in england
im not so sure said lord ragnal laugh pleasantli i have an
idea that mr quatermain is full of surpris howev with hi leav
well see if you have a dai to spare mr quatermain we ar go to
shoot through the home covert tomorrow which havent been touch
till now and i hope you will join us
it is most kind of you but that is imposs i answer with
firm i have no gun here
oh never mind that mr quatermain i have a pair of
breechloadersthes were new thing at that datewhich have been
sent down to me to try i am go to return them becaus thei ar much
too short in the stock for me i think thei would just suit you and you
ar quit welcom to the us of them
again i excus myself guess that the discomfit charl would
put all sort of stori about concern me and not wish to look
foolish befor a parti of grand stranger no doubt chosen for their
skill at thi particular form of sport
well allan exclaim scroop who alwai had a talent for sai the
wrong thing you ar quit right not to go into a competit with lord
ragnal over high pheasant
i flush for there wa some truth in hi blunder remark whereon
lord ragnal said with readi tact
i ask mr quatermain to shoot not to a shoot match scroop and
i hope hell come
thi left me no option and with a sink heart i had to accept
sorri i cant ask you too scroop said hi lordship when detail
had been arrang but we can onli manag seven gun at thi shoot but
will you and miss manner come to dine and sleep tomorrow even i
should like to introduc your futur wife to my futur wife he ad
colour a littl
miss manner be devour with curios as to the wonder miss
holm of whom she had heard so much but never actual seen accept
at onc befor her lover could get out a word whereon scroop
volunt to bring me over in the morn and load for me be
possess by a terror that i should be hand over to the care of the
unsympathet charl i repli that i should be veri grate and so
the thing wa settl
on our wai home we pass through a countri town of which i forget the
name and the sight of a gunsmith shop there remind me that i had
no cartridg so i stop to order some as fortun lord ragnal
had mention that the gun he wa go to lend me were twelvebor
the tradesman ask me how mani cartridg i want and when i repli
a hundr stare at me and said

these direct were given in a portent stage asid which we were
not suppos to hear thei caus scroop to snigger and charl to
grin but in me thei rais a feel of indign
i took on of the gun and look at it it wa a costli and beautifulli
made weapon of the period with an underlev action
there noth wrong with the gun sir rumbl red waistcoat if
you hold it straight it will do the rest but keep the muzzl up sir
keep it up for i know what the bore is without studi the same with
my ey also perhap you wont take it amiss if i tell you that here at
ragnal we hate a low pheasant i mention it becaus the last gentleman
who came from foreign partsh wa french he wasshot noth all dai
but on hen bird sit just on the top of the brush two beater hi
lordship hat and a starl
at thi point scroop broke into a roar of idiot laughter charl
from whom fortun decre that i wa not to escap after all turn
hi back and doubl up as though seiz with sudden pain in the
stomach and i grew absolut furiou
confound it mr keeper i explain what do you mean by lectur

at thi moment who should appear from behind the angl of some
buildingw were talk in the stableyard near the gunroombut lord
ragnal himself i could see that he had overheard the convers for
he look angri
jenkin he said address the keeper do what mr quatermain ha
said and attend to your own busi perhap you ar not awar that he
ha shot more lion eleph and other big game than you have cat

worst and most danger shot i ever saw howev on the other hand
he is the best rearer of pheasant in the counti so i put up with
him come in now wont you charl will look after your gun and
cartridg
so scroop and i were taken through a side entranc into the big hall
and there introduc to the other member of the shoot parti most of
whom were stai at the castl thei were famou shot inde i
had read of the prowess of some of them in the field a paper that i
alwai took in africa although often enough when i wa on my distant
expedit i did not see a copi of it for a year at a time
to my astonish i found that i knew on of these gentlemen we had
not it is true met for a dozen year but i seldom forget a face
and i wa sure that i could not be mistaken in thi instanc that mean
appear those small shifti grei ey that red point nose could
belong to nobodi except van koop so famou in hi dai in south africa
in connexion with certain gigant and most success fraud that the
law seem quit unabl to touch of which fraud i had been on of the
mani victim to the extent of 250 a larg sum for me
the last time we met there had been a stormi scene between us which
end in my declar in my wrath that if i came across him on the veld
i should shoot him at sight perhap that wa on of the reason why mr
van koop vanish from south africa for i mai add that he wa a cur
of the first water i believ that he had onli just enter the room
have driven over from wherev he live at some distanc from ragnal
at ani rate he knew noth of my presenc at thi shoot had he known
i am quit sure that he would have been absent he turn and see
me ejacul allan quatermain by heaven beneath hi breath but
in such a tone of astonish that it attract the attent of lord
ragnal who wa stand near
ye mr van koop i answer in a cheer voic allan quatermain
no other and i hope you ar as glad to see me as i am to see you
i think there is some mistak said lord ragnal stare at us thi
is sir juniu fortescu who us to be mr fortescu
inde i repli i dont know that i ever rememb hi be call
by that particular name but i do know that we ar oldfriend
lord ragnal move awai as though he did not wish to continu the
convers which no on els had overheard and van koop sidl up to
me
mr quatermain he said in a low voic circumst have chang
with me sinc last we met
so i gather i repli but mine have remain much the same and if
it is conveni to you to repai me that 250 you ow me with interest
i shall be much oblig if not i think i have a good stori to tell
about you
oh mr quatermain he answer with a sort of smile which made me
feel inclin to kick him you know i disput that debt
do you i exclaim well perhap you will disput the stori also
but the question is will you be believ when i give the proof
ever heard of the statut of limit mr quatermain he ask
with a sneer
not where charact is concern i repli stoutli now what ar
you go to do
he reflect for a moment and answer
look here mr quatermain you were alwai a bit of a sportsman and
ill make you an offer if i kill more bird than you do todai you
shall promis to hold your tongu about my affair in south africa and
if you kill more than i do you shall still hold your tongu but i will
pai you that 250 and interest for six year
i also reflect for a moment know that the man had someth up hi
sleev of cours i could refus and make a scandal but that wa not
in my line and would not bring me nearer my 250 which if i chanc
to win might find it wai back to me
all right done i said
what is your bet sir juniu ask lord ragnal who wa approach
again
it is rather a long stori he answer but to put it shortli year
ago when i wa travel in africa mr quatermain and i had a disput
as to a sum of 5 which he thought i ow him and to save argument
about a trifl we have agre that i should shoot against him for it
todai
inde said lord ragnal rather serious for i could see that
he did not believ van koop statement as to the amount of the bet
perhap he had heard more than we thought to be frank sir juniu i
dont much care for bettingfor that what it come toher also i
think mr quatermain said yesterdai that he had never shot pheasant in
england so the match seem scarc fair howev you gentlemen know
your own busi best onli i must tell you both that if monei is
concern i shall have to set someon whose decis will be final to
count your bird and report the number to me
agre said van koop or rather sir juniu but i answer noth
for to tell the truth alreadi i felt asham of the whole affair
as it happen lord ragnal and i walk togeth ahead of the other
to the first covert which wa half a mile or more awai
you have met sir juniu befor he said to me interrog
i have met mr van koop befor i answer about twelv year
sinc shortli after which he vanish from south africa where he wa a
wellknown and veri successfulspecul
to reappear here ten year ago he bought a larg properti in thi
neighbourhood three year ago he becam a baronet
how did a man like van koop becom a baronet i inquir
by purchas i believ
by purchas ar honour in england purchas
you ar delightfulli innoc mr quatermain as a hunter from africa
should be said lord ragnal laugh your friend
excus me lord ragnal i am a veri humbl person not so elev
inde as that gamekeep of your therefor i should not ventur to
call sir juniu late mr van koop my friend at least in earnest
he laugh again
well the individu with whom you make bet subscrib larg to the
fund of hi parti i am tell you what i know to be true though the
amount i do not know it ha been various state to be from fifteen
to fifti thousand pound and perhap by coincid subsequ wa
somehow creat a baronet
i stare at him
that all the stori he went on i dont like the man myself but he
is a wonder pheasant shot which pass him everywher shoot ha
becom a kind of fetish in these part mr quatermain for instanc it
is a tradit on thi estat that we must kill more pheasant than on
ani other in the countri and therefor i have to ask the best gun who
ar not alwai the best fellow it annoi me but it seem that i must
do what wa done befor me
under those circumst i should be inclin to give up the thing
altogeth lord ragnal sport as sport is good but when it becom a
busi it grow hate i know who have had to follow it as a trade
for mani year
that an idea he repli reflect meanwhil i do hope that
you will win back your5 from sir juniu he is so vain that i would
gladli give 50 to see you do so
there is littl chanc of that i said for as i told you i have
never shot pheasant befor still ill try as you wish it
that right and look here mr quatermain shoot well forward of
them you see i am ventur to advis you now as you advis me
yesterdai shot doe not travel so fast as ball and the pheasant is a
bird that is gener go much quicker than you think now here we
ar charl will show you your stand good luck to you
ten minut later the game began outsid of a long covert all the
seven gun be post within sight of each other so occupi wa i in
watch the preliminari which were quit new to me that i allow
first a hare and then a hen pheasant to depart without fire at them
which hen pheasant by the wai curv round and wa beautifulli kill
by van koop who stood two gun off upon my right
look here allan said scroop if you ar go to beat your african
friend you had better wake up for you wont do it by admir the
sceneri or that squirrel on a tree
so i woke up just at that moment there wa a cry of cock forward
i thought it meant a cock pheasant and wa astonish when i saw a
beauti brown bird with a long beak flit toward me through the
top of the oak tree
am i to shoot at that i ask
of cours it is a woodcock answer scroop
by thi time the brown bird wa rock past me within ten yard i
fire and kill it for where it had been appear noth but a cloud
of feather it wa a quick and clever shot or so i thought but when
charl step out and pick from the ground onli a beak and a head a
titter of laughter went down the whole line of gun and loader
i sai old chap said scroop if you will us no 3 shot let your
bird get a littl farther off you
the incid upset me so much that immedi afterward i miss three
easi pheasant in success while van koop ad two to hi bag
scroop shook hi head and charl groan audibl now that i wa not
in competit with hi master he had becom suddenli anxiou that i
should win for in some mysteri wai the new of that bet had spread
and my adversari wa not popular amongst the keeper class
here you come again said scroop point to an advanc pheasant
it wa an extraordinarili high pheasant flush i think outsid the
covert by a stop so high that as it travel down the line although
three gun fire at it includ van koop none of them seem to touch
it then i fire and rememb lord ragnal advic far in front
it flight chang still it travel through the air but with the
momentum of a stone to fall fifti yard to my right dead
that better said scroop while charl grin all over hi round
face mutter
wipe hi ey that time
thi shot seem to give me confid and i improv consider
though oddli enough i found that it wa the high and difficult
pheasant which i kill and the easi on that i wa apt to muff but
van koop who wa certainli a finish artist kill both
at the next stand lord ragnal who had been observ my somewhat
indiffer perform ask me to stand back with him behind the
other gun
i see the tall on ar your line mr quatermain he said and you
will get some here
on thi occas we were place in a dip between two long covert which
lai about three hundr yard apart that which wa be beaten prove
full of pheasant and the shoot of those pick gun wa realli a
thing to see i did quit well here nearli but not altogeth as well
as lord ragnal himself though that is sai a great deal for he wa
a love shot
bravo he said at the end of the beat i believ you have got a
chanc of win your 5 after all
when howev at luncheon more than an hour later i found that i
wa thirti pheasant behind my adversari i shook my head and so did
everybodi els on the whole that luncheon of which we partook in
a keeper hous wa a veri pleasant meal though van koop talk so
continu and in such a boast strain that i saw it irrit our
host and some of the other gentlemen who were veri pleasant peopl at
last he began to patron me ask me how i had been get on with
my elephantpot of late year
i repli fairli well
then you should tell our friend some of your famou stori which
i promis i wont contradict he said ad you see thei ar
differ from us and have no experi of biggam shoot
i did not know that you had ani either sir juniu i answer
nettl inde i thought i rememb your tell me in africa that
the onli big game you had ever shot wa an ox sick with the redwat
anywai shoot is a busi with me not an amus as it is to
you and i do not talk shop
at thi he collaps amid some laughter after which scroop the most
loyal of friend began to repeat exploit of mine till my ear tingl
and i rose and went outsid to look at the weather
it had chang veri much dure luncheon the fair promis of the
morn had depart the sky wa overcast and a wind blow in
strong gust wa rise rapidli drive befor it occasion scurri
of snow
my word said lord ragnal who had join me the lake
covertthat our great stand here you knowwil take some shoot
thi afternoon we ought to kill seven hundr pheasant in it with thi
team but i doubt if we shall get five now mr quatermain i am go
to stand sir juniu fortescu and you back in the covert where you
will have the best of it as a lot of pheasant will never face the lake
against thi wind what is more i am come with you if i mai as
six gun ar enough for thi beat and i dont mean to shoot ani more
todai
i fear that you will be disappoint i said nervous
oh no i shant he answer i tell you frankli that if onli you
could have a season practic in my opinion you would make the best
pheasant shot of the lot of us at present you dont quit understand
the wai of the bird that all also those gun ar strang to you
have a glass of cherri brandi it will steadi your nerv
i drank the cherri brandi and present off we went the covert we
were go to shoot into which we had been drive pheasant all the
morn must have been nearli a mile long at the top end it wa broad
narrow at the bottom to a width of about two hundr yard here it
ran into a horsesho shape piec of water that wa about fifti yard
in breadth four of the gun were place round the bow of thi water
but on it farther side in such a posit that the pheasant should
stream over them to yet anoth covert behind at the top of a slope van
koop and i howev were order to take our place he to the right
and i to the left about seventi yard up the tongu in littl glade in
the woodland have the lake to our right and our left respect
i notic with dismai that we were so set that the gun below us on
it farther side could note all that we did or did not do also that a
littl band of watcher among whom i recogn my friend the gunsmith
were gather in a place where without interf with us thei could
see the sport on our wai to the boat howev which wa to row us
across the water an incid happen that put me in veri good spirit
and earn some applaus
i wa walk with lord ragnal scroop and charl about sixti yard
clear of a belt of tall tree when from far awai on the other side of
the tree came a cry of partridg over in the hoars voic of the
redwaistco jenkin who wa engag in superintend the drive
in of some low scrub befor he join hi armi at the top of the covert
look out mr quatermain thei ar come thi wai said lord ragnal
while charl thrust a load gun into my hand
anoth moment and thei appear over the treetop a big covei of them
in a long straggl line travel at i know not what speed for a
fierc gust from the rise gale had caught them i fire at the first
bird which fell at my feet i fire again and anoth fell behind me
i snatch up the second gun and kill a third as it pass over me
high up then wheel round i cover the last retreat bird and
lo it too fell a veri long shot inde
by georg said scroop i never saw that done befor while ragnal
stare and charl whistl
but now i will tell the truth and expos all my weak the second
bird wa not the on i aim at i wa behind it and caught that which
follow and in my vaniti i did not own up at least not till that
even
the four dead partridgesther wa not a runner among themhav been
collect amidst mani congratul we went on and were punt across
the lake to the covert as we enter the boat i observ that in
addit to the great bag charl wa carri a box of cartridg
under hi arm and ask him where he got it from
he repli from mr pophamthat wa the gunsmith namewho had
brought it with him in case i should not have enough i made no remark
but as i knew i had quit half of my cartridg left out of the three
hundr and fifti that i had bought i wonder to myself what kind of a
shoot thi wa go to be
well we took up our stand and while we were do so suddenli the
wind increas to a tear gale which seem to me to blow from all
point of the compass in turn rook fly homeward and pigeon
disturb by the beater were swept over us like drift leav wild
duck of which i got on went by like arrow the great bare oak
toss their bough and groan while not far off a fir tree wa blown
down fall with a splash into the water
it a wild afternoon said lord ragnal and as he spoke van koop
came from hi stand look rather scare and suggest that the shoot
should be given up
lord ragnal ask me what i wish to do i repli that i would rather
go on but that i wa in hi hand
i think we ar fairli safe in these open place sir juniu he said
and as the pheasant have been so much disturb alreadi it doe not
much matter if thei ar blown about a bit but if you ar of anoth
opinion perhap you had better get out of it and stand with the other
over the lake ill send for my gun and take your place
on hear thi van koop chang hi mind and said that he would go on
so the beat began at first the wind blew from behind us and pheasant
in increas number pass over our head most of them rather low
to the gun on the farther side of the water who skill though thei
were did not make veri good work with them we had been instruct not
to fire at bird go forward so i let these be van koop howev
did not interpret the order in the same spirit for he loos at
sever kill on or two and miss other
that fellow is no sportsman i heard lord ragnal remark i suppos
it is the bet
then he sent charl to ask him to desist
shortli after thi the gale work round to the north and settl there
blow with everincreas violenc the pheasant howev still
flew forward in the shelter of the tree for thei were make for the
covert on the hill where thei had been bred but when thei got into the
open and felt the full forc of the wind quit four out of six of
them turn and came back at a most fear pace mani so high as to be
almost out of shot
for the next threequart of an hour or morea i think i have
explain the beat wa a veri long onei had such covert shoot as
i suppos i shall never see again high abov those shriek tree
or over the lake to my left flash the winddriven pheasant in an
endless process oddli enough i found that thi wild work suit me
for as time went on and the pheasant grew more and more imposs i
shot better and better on after anoth down thei came far behind me
with a crash in the brushwood or a splash in the lake till the
gun grew almost too hot to hold there were so mani of them that i
discov i could pick my shot also that nine out of ten were caught
by the wind and curv at a certain angl and that the time to fire wa
just befor thei took the curv the excit wa great and the
sport splendid as anyon will testifi who ha shot decemb pheasant
break back over the covert and in a tear gale van koop also
wa do veri well but the gun in front got compar littl
shoot thei were forc to stand there poor fellow and watch our
perform from afar
as the thing drew toward an end the bird came thicker and thicker and
i shot as i have said better and better thi mai be judg from the
fact that notwithstand their height and tremend pace i kill
my last thirti pheasant with thirtyf cartridg the final bird
of all a splendid cock appear by himself out of nothing when we
thought that all wa done i think it must have been flush from the
covert on the hill or been turn back just as it reach it by the
resistless strength of the storm over it came so high abov us that it
look quit small in the dark snowscud
too farno us said lord ragnal as i lift the gun
still i fire hold i know not how much in front and lo that
pheasant di in mid air fall with a mighti splash near the bank of
the lake but at a great distanc behind us the shot wa so remark
that everyon who saw it includ most of the beater who had pass
us by now utter a cheer and the redwaistco old jenkin who had
stop by us remark well bust me if that baint a master on
scroop made me angri by slap me so hard upon the back that it hurt
and nearli caus me to let off the other barrel of the gun charl
seem to becom on great grin and lord ragnal with a brief
congratulatori never enjoi a shoot so much in my life call to the
men who were post behind us to pick up all the dead pheasant be
care to keep mine apart from those of sir juniu fortescu
you should have a hundr and fortythre at thi stand he said
allow for everi possibl runner charl and i make the same total
i remark that i did not think there were mani runner as the no 3
shot had serv me veri well and get into the boat wa row to the
other side where i receiv more congratul then as all further
shoot wa out of the question becaus of the weather we walk back
to the castl to tea
as i empti my cup lord ragnal who had left the room return and
ask us to come and see the game so we went to find it laid out in
endless line upon the snowpowd grass in the quadrangl of the
castl arrang in on main and two separ lot
those ar your and sir juniuss said scroop i wonder which of you
ha won ill put a sovereign on you old fellow
then your a donkei for your pain i answer feel vex for at
that moment i had forgotten all about the bet
i do not rememb how mani pheasant were kill altogeth but the
total wa much smaller than had been hope for becaus of the gale
jenkin said lord ragnal present to red waistcoat how mani have
you to the credit of sir juniu fortescu
two hundr and seventyseven my lord twelv hare two woodcock
and three pigeon
and how mani to that of mr quatermain ad i must remind
you both gentlemen that the bird have been pick as carefulli as
possibl and kept unmix and therefor that the figur given by
jenkin must be consid as final
quit so i answer but van koop said noth then while we all
wait anxious came the amaz answer
two hundr and seventyseven pheasant my lord same number as those
of sir juniu bart fifteen hare three pigeon four partridg on
duck and a beaki mean a woodcock
then it seem you have won your 5 mr quatermain upon which i
congratul you said lord ragnal
stop a minut broke in van koop the bet wa as to pheasant the
other thing dont count
i think the term us wa bird i remark but to be frank when
i made it i wa think of pheasant as no doubt sir juniu wa also
therefor if the count is correct there is a dead heat and the
wager fall through
i am sure we all appreci the view you take of the matter said lord
ragnal for it might be argu anoth wai in these circumst sir
juniu keep hi 5 in hi pocket it is unlucki for you quatermain
he ad drop the mister that the last high pheasant you shot
cant be found it fell into the lake you rememb and i suppos
swam ashor and ran
ye i repli especi as i could have sworn that it wa quit
dead
so could i quatermain but the fact remain that it isnt there
if we had all the pheasant that we think fall dead our bag would
be much bigger than thei ar remark van koop with a look of great
relief upon hi face ad in hi horrid patron wai still
you shot uncommonli well quatermain id no idea you would run me so
close
i felt inclin to answer but didnt onli lord ragnal said
mr quatermain shot more than well hi perform in the lake covert
wa the most brilliant that i have ever seen when you went in there
togeth sir juniu you were thirti ahead of him and you fire
seventeen more cartridg at the stand
then just as we turn to go someth happen the roundei
charl ran puf into the quadrangl follow by anoth man with
a dog who had been special set to pick my bird and carri in hi
hand a muchbedraggl cock pheasant without a tail
iv got him my lord he gasp for he had run veri fast the
littl gentsi mean that which he kill in the cloud with the last
shot he fire it had gone right down into the mud and stuck there tom
and me fish him up with a pole
lord ragnal took the bird and look at it it wa almost cold but
evid freshli kill for the limb were quit flexibl
that turn the scale in favour of mr quatermain he said so sir
juniu you had better pai your monei and congratul him as i do
i protest exclaim van koop look veri angri and meaner than
usual how am i to know that thi wa mr quatermain pheasant the
sum involv is more than 5 and i feel it is my duti to protest
becaus my men sai so sir juniu moreov see the height from
which the bird fell their stori is obvious true
then he examin the pheasant further point out that it appear
to have onli on wounda shot through the throat almost exactli at the
root of the beak of which shot there wa no mark of exit what size
shot were you us sir juniu he ask
no 4 at the last stand
and you were us no 3 mr quatermain now wa ani other gun us
no 3
all shook their head
jenkin open that bird head i think the shot that kill it will be
found in the brain
jenkin obei us a penknif cleverli enough press against the
bone of the skull he found the shot
no 3 it is sure enough my lord he said
you will agre that settl the matter sir juniu said lord ragnal
and now as a bet ha been made here it had better be paid
i have not enough monei on me said van koop sulkili
i think your banker is mine said lord ragnal quietli so you can
write a chequ in the hous come in all of you it is cold in thi
wind
so we went into the smokingroom and lord ragnal who i could see
wa annoi instantli fetch a blank chequ from hi studi and hand
it to van koop in rather a point manner
he took it and turn to me said
i rememb the capit sum but how much is the interest sorri to
troubl you but i am not veri good at figur
then you must have chang a good deal dure the last twelv year
sir juniu i could not help sai still never mind the interest i
shall be quit satisfi with the princip
so he fill up the chequ for 250 and threw it down on the tabl
befor me sai someth about it be a bother to mix up busi
with pleasur
i took the draft saw that it wa correct though rather illeg and
proceed to dry it by wave it in the air as i did so it came into my
mind that i would not touch the monei of thi success scamp won back
from him in such a wai
yield to a perhap foolish impuls i said
lord ragnal thi chequ is for a debt which year ago i wrote off
as lost at luncheon todai you were talk of a cottag hospit for
which you ar try to get up an endow fund in thi neighbourhood
and in answer to a question from you sir juniu fortescu said that he
had not as yet made ani subscript to it fund will you allow me to
hand you sir juniuss subscriptionto be enter in hi name if you
pleas and i pass him the chequ which wa drawn to myself or
bearer
he look at the amount and see that it wa not 5 but 250
flush then ask
what do you sai to thi act of generos on the part of mr
quatermain sir juniu
there wa no answer becaus sir juniu had gone i never saw him
again for year ago the poor man di quit disgrac hi passion for
semifraudul specul reassert itself and he becam a bankrupt
in condit which caus him to leav the countri for america where
he wa kill in a railwai accid while travel as an immigr i
have heard howev that he wa not ask to shoot at ragnal ani more
the chequ wa pass to the credit of the cottag hospit but not as
i had request as a subscript from sir juniu fortescu a coupl
of year later inde i learn that thi sum of monei wa us to
build a littl room in that institut to accommod sick children
which room wa name the allan quatermain ward
now i have told thi stori of that decemb shoot becaus it wa the
begin of my long and close friendship with ragnal
when he found that van koop had gone awai without sai goodby lord
ragnal made no remark onli he took my hand and shook it
i have onli to add that although except for the element of competit
which enter into it i enjoi thi dai shoot veri much inde
when i came to count up it cost i felt glad that i had not been

chapter iii
miss holm
two and a half hour pass by most of which time i spent ly down to
rest and get rid of a headach caus by the continu rapid fire
and the roar of the gale or both also in rub my shoulder with
ointment for it wa sore from the recoil of the gun then scroop
appear as be unabl to find my wai about the long passag of
that great old castl i had ask him to do and we descend togeth
to the larg drawingroom
it wa a splendid apart onli us upon state occas light
i should think with at least two or three hundr wax candl which
threw a soft glow over the panel and pictur wall the priceless
antiqu furnitur and the bejewel ladi who were gather there to
my mind there never wa and never will be ani artifici light to equal
that of wax candl in suffici quantiti the compani wa larg i
think thirti sat down to dinner that night which wa given to introduc
lord ragnal futur wife to the neighbourhood whereof she wa
destin to be the leader
miss manner who wa look veri happi and charm in her jewel and
fine cloth join us at onc and inform scroop that she wa
just come the maid in the cloakroom had told her so
is she repli scroop indiffer well so long as you have come
i dont care about anyon els
then he told her she wa look beauti and stare at her with such
affect that i fell back a step or two and contempl a pictur of
judith vigor engag in cut off the head of holofern
present the larg door at the end of the room wa thrown open and the
immacul savag who wa act as a kind of master of the ceremoni
announc in wellbr but penetr tone ladi longden and the
honour miss holm i stare like everybodi els but for a while
her ladyship fill my ey she wa an ampl and to my mind rather
awfullook person clad in black satinsh wa a widowand veri
larg diamond her hair wa white her nose wa hook her dark ey
were penetr and she had a bad cold in her head that wa all i
found time to notic about her for suddenli her daughter came into my
line of vision
truli she wa a love girl or rather young woman for she must
have been two or threeandtwenti not veri tall her proport were
round and exquisit and her movement as grace as those of a doe
altogeth she wa doelik especi in the fine of her line
and her larg and liquid ey she wa a dark beauti with rich brown
wave hair a clear oliv complexion a perfectli shape mouth and veri
red lip to me she look more italian or spanish than anglosaxon and
i believ that as a matter of fact she had some southern blood in her
on her father side she wore a dress of soft rose colour and her onli
ornament were a string of pearl and a singl red camellia i could see
but on blemish if it were a blemish in her perfect person and that
wa a curiou white mark upon her breast which in it shape exactli
resembl the crescent moon
the face howev impress me with other than it physic qualiti
it wa bright intellig sympathet and just now happi but i
thought it more i thought it mystic someth that her mother said
to her probabl about her dress caus her smile to vanish for a
moment and then from beneath it as it were appear thi shadow of
innat mystic in a second it wa gone and she wa laugh again
but i who am accustom to observ had caught it perhap alon of all
that compani moreov it remind me of someth
what wa it ah i knew a look that sometim i had seen upon the face
of a certain zulu ladi name mameena especi at the moment of her
wonder and tragic death the thought made me shiver a littl i could
not tell why for certainli i reflect thi highplac and fortun
english girl had noth in common with that fatedriven child of storm
whose dark and imperi spirit dwelt in the woman call mameena thei
were as far apart as zululand is from essex yet it wa quit sure that
both of them had touch with hidden thing
lord ragnal look more like a splendid van dyck than ever in hi
even dress step forward to greet hi fianc and her mother with
a courtli bow and i turn again to continu my contempl of the
stalwart judith and the veri ugli head of holofern present i wa
awar of a soft voicea veri rich and thrill voiceask quit
close to me
which is he oh you need not answer dear i know him from the
descript
ye repli lord ragnal to miss holmesfor it wa sheyou ar
quit right i will introduc you to him present but love whom do
you wish to take you in to dinner i cantyour mother you know and
as there ar no titl here tonight you mai make your choic would

rest put togeth but luna why ar you alwai think and talk
about africa on might imagin that you were go to live there
so i mai on dai she answer dreamili who know where on ha
live or where on will live and again i saw that mystic look come
into her face
i heard no more of that convers which it is improb that anyon
whose ear had not been sharpen by a lifetim of listen in great
silenc would have caught at all to tell the truth i made myself
scarc slip off to the other end of the big room in the hope of
evad the kind intent of miss holm i have a great dislik
of be put out of my place and i felt that among all these local
celebr it wa not fit that i should be select to take in
the futur bride on an occas of thi sort but it wa of no us for
present lord ragnal hunt me up bring the young ladi with him
let me introduc you to miss holm quatermain he said she is
anxiou that you should take her in to dinner if you will be so kind
she is veri interest inin

in mr quatermain who i am told is on of the greatest hunter in
africa she correct me with a dazzl smile
i bow not know what to sai lord ragnal laugh and vanish
leav us togeth dinner wa announc present we were wend in
the centr of a long and glitter process across the central hall
to the banquet chamber a splendid room with a roof like a church
that wa said to have been built in the time of the plantagenet here
mr savag who evid had been look out for her futur ladyship
conduct us to our place which were upon the left of lord ragnal
who sat at the head of the broad tabl with ladi longden on hi right
then the old clergyman dr jeffrei a pompou and rather frowsi
ecclesiast said grace for grace wa still in fashion at such feast
in those dai ask heaven to make us truli thank for the dinner we
were about to consum
certainli there wa a great deal to be thank for in the eat and
drink line but of all i rememb littl except a gener vision of
silver dish champagn splendour and thing i did not want to eat
be constantli hand to me what i do rememb is miss holm and
noth but miss holm the charm of her convers the light of her
beauti ey the fragranc of her hair her most flatter interest
in my unworthi self to tell the truth we got on like fire in the
winter grass as the zulu sai and when that dinner wa over the grass
wa still burn
i dont think that lord ragnal quit like it but fortun ladi
longden wa a talk person first she convers about her cold in
the head sneez at interv poor soul and be reduc to send
for anoth handkerchief after the entr then she got off upon
busi matter to judg from the look of boredom on her host face
i think it must have been of settlement three time did i hear him
refer her to the lawyerswithout avail lastli when he thought he had
escap she embark upon a quit vigor argument with dr jeffrei
about church mattersi gather that she wa low and he wa
highin which she insist upon hi lordship act as refere
do try and keep your attent fix georg i heard her sai
sever to allow it to wander when high spiritu affair ar under
discuss sneez is scarc rever could you tell the man to shut
that door the draught is dread it is quit imposs for you to
agre with both of us as you sai you do see that metaphor dr
jeffrei is at on pole and i am at the other sneez
then i wish i were at the tropic of cancer i heard him mutter with a
groan
in vain he had to keep hi attent fix on thi point for the next
threequart of an hour so as miss manner wa at the other side
of me and scroop unhamp by the presenc of ani prospect
motherinlaw wa at the other side of her for all practic purpos
miss holm and i were left alon
she began by sai
i hear you beat sir juniu fortescu out shoot todai and won a lot
of monei from him which you gave to the cottag hospit i dont like
shoot and i dont like bet and it strang becaus you dont
look like a man who bet but i detest sir juniu fortescu and that is
a bond of union between us
i never said i detest him
no but i am sure you do your face chang when i mention hi name
as it happen you ar right but miss holm i should like you to
understand that you were also right when you said i did not look like a
bet man and i told her some of the stori of van koop and the 250
ah she said when i had finish i alwai felt sure he wa a
horror and my mother want me just becaus he pretend to be low
churchbut that a secret
then i congratul her upon her approach marriag sai what
a joy thing it wa now and again to see everyth go in real
happi storybook fashion beauti male and femal unit by love high
rank wealth troop of friend health of bodi a love and an ancient
home in a settl land where danger do not comeat presentrespect
and affect of crowd of depend the prospect of a high and us
career of a sort whereof the door is shut to most peopl everyth
in short that human be who ar not actual royalti could desir or
deserv inde after my second glass of champagn i grew quit eloqu
on these and kindr point be move thereto by memori of the
miseri that is in the world which form so great a contrast to the lot
of thi strike and brilliant pair
she listen to me attent and answer
thank you for your kind thought and wish but doe it not strike
you mr quatermain that there is someth illomen in such talk i
believ that it doe that as you finish speak it occur to you
that after all the futur is as much veil from all of us asa the
pictur which hang behind it curtain of rosecolour silk in lord
ragnal studi is from you
how did you know that i ask sharpli in a low voic for by the
strangest of coincid as i conclud my somewhat oldfashion
littl speech of compliment thi veri reflect had enter my
mind and with it the memori of the veil pictur which mr savag had
point out to me on the previou morn
i cant sai mr quatermain but i did know it you were think of
the pictur were you not
and if i wa i said avoid a direct repli what of it though
it is hidden from everybodi els he ha onli to draw the curtain and
seeyou
suppos he should draw the curtain on dai and see noth mr
quatermain
then the pictur would have been stolen that is all and he would have
to search for it till he found it again which doubtless sooner or later
he would do
ye sooner or later but where perhap you have lost a pictur or two
in your time mr quatermain and ar better abl to answer the question
than i am
there wa silenc for a few moment for thi talk of lost pictur
brought back memori which choke me
then she began to speak again low quickli and with suppress
passion but act wonderfulli all the while know that ey were on
her her gestur and the express of her face were such as might
have been those of ani young ladi of fashion who wa talk of everydai
affair such as danc or flower or jewel she smile and even
laugh occasion she plai with the golden saltcellar in front
of her and upset a littl of the salt threw it over her left
shoulder appear to ask me if i were a victim of that ancient habit
and so on
but all the while she wa talk deepli of deep thing such as i
should never have thought would pass her mind thi wa the substanc
of what she said for i cannot set it all down verbatim after so mani
year my memori fail me
i am not like other women someth move me to tell you so someth
veri real and power which push me as a strong man might it is odd
becaus i have never spoken to anyon els like that not to my mother
for instanc or even to lord ragnal thei would neither of them
understand although thei would misunderstand differ my mother
would think i ought to see a doctorand if you knew that doctor he
and she nod toward lord ragnal would think that my engag had
upset me or that i had grown rather more religi than i ought to be
at my ag and been reflect too muchwel on the end of all thing
from a child i have understood that i am a mysteri set in the midst of
mani other mysteri it all came to me on night when i wa about nine
year old i seem to see the past and the futur although i could
grasp neither such a long long past and such an infinit futur i
dont know what i saw and still see sometim it come in a flash and
is in a flash forgotten my mind cannot hold it it is too big for
my mind you might as well try to pack dr jeffrei there into thi
wineglass onli two fact remain written on my heart the first is
that there is troubl ahead of me curiou and unusu troubl and
the second that perman continu i or a part of me have
someth to do with africa a countri of which i know noth
except from a few veri dull book also by the waythi is a new
thoughtthat i have a great deal to do with you that is why i am
so interest in africa and you tell me about africa and yourself now
while we have the chanc and she end rather abruptli ad in a
louder voic you have live there all your life have you not mr
quatermain
i rather think your mother would be rightabout the doctor i mean i
said
you sai that but you dont believ it oh you ar veri
transpar mr quatermainat least to me
so hurriedli enough for these subject seem to be uncomfort
even danger in a sens i began to talk of the first thing about
africa that i rememberednam of the legend of the holi flower that
wa guard by a huge ap of which i had heard from a white man who wa
suppos to be rather mad who went by the name of brother john also i
told her that there wa someth in it as i had with me a specimen of
the flower

i repli that i fear i could not as it wa lock awai in a safe in
london whither i wa return on the morrow i promis howev to
send her a lifes watercolour draw of which i had caus sever
to be made she ask me if i were go to look for thi flower and
i said that i hope so if i could make the necessari arrang next
she ask me if there chanc to be ani other african quest upon which
i had set my mind i repli that there were sever for instanc i
had heard vagu through brother john and indirectli from on or
two other sourc of the exist of a certain tribe in east central
africaarab or semiarabswho were report to worship a child that
alwai remain a child thi child i took it wa a dwarf but as i
wa interest in nativ religi custom which were infinit in their
varieti i should much like to find out the truth of the matter
talk of arab she broke in i will tell you a curiou stori onc
when i wa a littl girl eight or nine year of ageit wa just befor
that kind of awaken of which i have spoken to youi wa plai in
kensington garden for we live in london at the time in the charg of
my nursegov she wa talk to some young man who she said wa
her cousin and told me to run about with my hoop and not to bother i
drove the hoop across the grass to some elm tree from behind on of
the tree came out two tall men dress in white robe and turban who
look to me like scriptur charact in a picturebook on wa an
elderli man with flash black ey hook nose and a long grei
beard the other wa much younger but i do not rememb him so well
thei were both brown in colour but otherwis almost like white men not
negro by ani mean my hoop hit the elder man and i stood still not
know what to sai he bow polit and pick it up but did not
offer to return it to me thei talk togeth rapidli and on of them
point to the moonshap birthmark which you see i have upon my
neck for it wa hot weather and i wa wear a lowcut frock it wa
becaus of thi mark that my father name me luna the elder of the two

wa find myself in the arm of the younger eastern with the nurs
and her cousin a stalwart person like a soldier stand in front of
us

i grew faint again and when i came to myself the two whiterob men

from stranger sai that if my parent came to know of it i should
be whip and sent to bed of cours i beg her not to tell them
and at last she consent do you know i think you ar the first to
whom i have ever mention the matter of which i am sure the gover

garden her cousin alwai came to look after us in the end i think
she marri him
you believ the sweet wa drug i ask
she nod there wa someth veri strang in it it wa a night
or two after i had tast it that i had what just now i call my
awaken and began to think about africa
have you ever seen these men again miss holm

remark for as lord ragnal pass on hi wai to the other end of the
tabl he said in a low voic and with rather a forc smile
well quatermain i hope your dinner ha not been as dull as mine
although your appetit seem so poor
then i reflect that i could not rememb have eaten a thing sinc
the first entr so overcom wa i that reject all scroop
attempt at convers i sat silent drink port and fill up
with date until not long afterward we went into the drawingroom
where i sat down as far from miss holm as possibl and look at a
book of view of jerusalem
while i wa thu engag lord ragnal piti my lone condit or
be instig thereto by miss holm i know not which came up and
began to chat with me about african biggam shoot also he ask me
what wa my perman address in that countri i told him durban and in
my turn ask why he want to know
becaus miss holm seem quit crazi about the place and i expect i
shall be drag out there on dai he repli quit gloomili it wa
a prophet remark
at thi moment our convers wa interrupt by ladi longden who
came to bid her futur soninlaw good night she said that she must go
to bed and put her feet in mustard and water as her cold wa so bad
which left me wonder whether she meant to carri out thi oper
in bed i recommend her to take quinin a suggest she acknowledg

suppos i sat up to all hour of the night in africa i repli that
frequent i did wait for the sun to rise next dai for that member
of the british aristocraci irrit me

that person so utterli differ in everi wai as ladi longden and her
daughter miss holm could be mother and child our bodi no doubt
we do inherit from our ancestor but not our individu these
come from far awai
a good mani of the guest went at the same time have long distanc
to drive on that cold frosti night although it wa onli just ten
oclock for as wa usual at that period even in fashion hous we
had dine at seven
chapter iv

after lord ragnal had seen hi guest to the door in the oldfashion
manner he return and ask me if i plai card or whether i

search ey as though he suspect him of be drunk and then ask

tone that two foreign individu in white cloth have arriv at
the castl state that thei wish to speak at onc with a mr
herecomeazani who is stai here i told them to go awai as the
butler said he could make noth of their talk but thei onli sat down

could see that he wa in a great fright when he had gone we set to
work and clear a space in the middl of the room in front of which we
arrang chair for the compani to sit on

melancholi music the sound of which seem to affect my backbon as

low song whereof i could not understand a word that rose and fell with
the music of the flute now he struck a match which seem incongru
in the midst of thi semimag ceremoni and take a pinch of the

from the bowl and with it a veri sweet odour not unlik that of the
tuberos garden grow in hothous but more search
now you breath smoke macumazana he said and tell us what you

took the bowl and held it under my nose while hart threw over my head
the antimacassar which he had us in the mango trick to keep in the
fume i suppos
at first these fume were unpleas but just as i wa about to drop
the bowl thei seem to becom agreeabl and to penetr to the inmost
recess of my be the gener affect of them wa not unlik that of
the laugh ga which dentist give with thi differ that wherea
the ga produc insens these fume seem to set the mind
on fire and to burn awai all limit of time and distanc thing
shift befor me it wa as though i were no longer in that room but
travel with inconceiv rapid
suddenli i appear to stop befor a curtain of mist the mist roll
up in front of me and i saw a wild and wonder scene there lai a lake
surround by dens african forest the sky abov wa still red with the
last light of sunset and in it float the full moon on the eastern
side of the lake wa a great open space where noth seem to grow and
all about thi space were the skeleton of hundr of dead eleph
there thei lai some of them almost cover with grei moss hang to
their bone through which their yellow tusk project as though thei
had been dead for centuri other with the rot hide still on them
i knew that i wa look on a cemeteri of eleph the place where
these great beast went to die as i have sinc been told the extinct
moa did in new zealand all my life as a hunter had i heard rumour
of these cemeteri but never befor did i see such a spot even in a
dream
see there wa on dy now a huge gaunt bull that look as though it
were sever hundr year old it stood there swai to and fro then
it lift it trunk i suppos to trumpet though of cours i could
hear noth and slowli sank upon it knee and so remain in the last
relax of death
almost in the centr of thi cemeteri wa a littl mound of waterwash
rock that had endur when the rest of the stoni plain wa denud in
past epoch suddenli upon that rock appear the shape of the most
gigant eleph that ever i beheld in all my long experi it had
on enorm tusk but the other wa deform and broken off short it
side were scar as though with fight and it ey shone red and
wickedli held in it trunk wa the bodi of a woman whose hair hung down
upon on side and whose feet hung down upon the other clasp in her
arm wa a child that seem to be still live
the rogu as a brute of thi sort is call for evid such it wa
drop the corps to the ground and stood a while flap it ear
then it felt for and pick up the child with it trunk swung it to and
fro and final toss it high into the air hurl it far awai after
thi it walk to the eleph that i had just seen die and charg
the carcass knock it over then have lift it trunk as though to
trumpet in triumph it shambl off toward the forest and vanish
the curtain of mist fell again and in it dimli i thought i sawwel
never mind who or what i saw then i awok
well did you see anyth ask a choru of voic
i told them what i had seen leav out the last part
i sai old fellow said scroop you must have been pretti clever to

gracefulli let the antimacassar fall over it and her head which it
drape as a wed veil might do a few second later she threw off the
antimacassar and cast the bowl in which the fire wa now out on to the

chapter v
the plot
the sequel to the event of thi even mai be told veri briefli and of
it the reader can form hi own judgment i narrat it as it happen
that night i did not sleep at all well it mai have been becaus of the
excit of the great shoot in which i found myself in competit
with anoth man whom i dislik and who had defraud me in the past
to sai noth of it physic strain in cold and heavi weather or it
mai have been that my imagin wa stir by the arriv of that
strang pair hart and mart appar in search of myself seven
thousand mile awai from ani place where thei can have known aught of an
insignific individu with a pure local reput or it mai have been
that the pictur which thei show me when under the influenc of
the fume of their tobaccoor of their hypnotismtook an undu
possess of my brain
or lastli the strang coincid that the beauti betroth of my
host should have relat to me a tale of her childhood of which she
declar she had never spoken befor and that within an hour the two
princip actor in that tale should have appear befor my ey and
her for i mai state that from the begin i had no doubt that
thei were the same men move me and fill me with quit natur
forebod or all these thing togeth mai have tend to a
concomit effect at ani rate the issu wa that i could not sleep
for hour after hour i lai think and in an irrit wai listen for
the chime of the ragnal stableclock which onc had adorn the tower
of the church and struck the quarter with a damnabl reiter i
conclud that messr hart and mart were a coupl of common arab
rogu such as i had seen perform at the african port then a
quarter struck and i conclud that the eleph cemeteri which i
beheld in the smoke undoubtedli exist and that i meant to collar those
thousand of pound worth of ivori befor i di then after anoth
quarter i conclud that there wa no eleph cemeteryalthough by
the wai my old friend dogeetah or brother john had mention such
a thing to mebut that probabl there wa a tribe as he had also
mention call the kendah who worship a babi or rather it
effigi
well now as had alreadi occur to me the old egyptian of whom i
wa alwai fond of read when i got a chanc also worship a child
horu the saviour and that child had a mother call isi symbol in
the crescent moon the great natur goddess the mistress of mysteri
to whose cult ten thousand priest were sworndo not herodotu and
other especi apuleiu tell us all about her and by a queer
coincid miss holm had the mark of a crescent moon upon her breast
and when she wa a child those two men or other veri like them had
point out that mark to each other and i had seen them stare hard
at it that night and in her vapourinvok dream the heavenli child
alia horu or the doubl of horu the ka i think the egyptian
call it had awaken at the sight of her and kiss her and given her
the necklac of the goddess andal the rest what did it mean
i went to sleep at last wonder what on earth it could mean till
present that confound clock woke me up again and i must go through
the whole busi onc more
by degre thi wa toward dawn i becam awar that all hope of rest
had vanish from me utterli that i wa most painfulli awak and what
is more oppress by a curiou fear to the effect that someth wa
go to happen to miss holm so vivid did thi fear becom that at
length i aros lit a candl and dress myself as it happen i knew
where miss holm slept her room which i had seen her enter wa on
the same corridor as mine though at the other end of it near the head
of a stair that ran i knew not whither in my portmanteau that had been
sent over from miss mannerss hous amongst other thing wa a small
doublebarrel pistol which from long habit i alwai carri with me
load except for the cap that were in a littl leather case with some
spare ammunit attach to the pistol belt i took it out cap it
and thrust it into my pocket then i slip from the room and stood
behind a tall clock in the corridor watch miss holmess door and
reflect what a fool i should look if anyon chanc to find me
half an hour or so later by the light of the set moon which
struggl through a window i saw the door open and miss holm emerg
in a kind of dressinggown and still wear the necklac which hart
and mart had given her of thi i wa sure for the light gleam upon
the red stone
also it shone upon her face and show me without doubt that she wa
walk in her sleep
glide as silent as a ghost she cross the corridor and vanish
i follow and saw that she had descend an ancient twist stairwai
which i had note in the castl wall i went after her my stocking
feet make no nois feel my wai carefulli in the dark of the
stair for i did not dare to strike a match beneath me i heard a nois
as of someon fumbl with bolt then a door creak on it hing and
there wa some light when i reach the doorwai i caught sight of the
figur of miss holm flit across a hollow garden that wa laid out
in the bottom of the castl moat which had been drain the garden as
i had observ when we walk through it on the previou dai on our wai
to the first covert that we shot wa border by a shrubberi through
which ran path that led to the back drive of the castl
across the garden glide the figur of miss holm and after it went i
crouch and take cover behind everi bush as though i were stalk
big game which inde i wa she enter the shrubberi move much
more swiftli now for as she went she seem to gather speed like a
stone which is roll down a hill it wa as though whatev might be
attract her for i felt sure that she wa be drawn by someth
act more strongli upon her sleep will as she drew nearer to it
for a while i lost sight of her in the shadow of the tall tree then
suddenli i saw her again stand quit still in an open caus by
the blow down in the gale of on of the avenu of elm that border
the back drive but now she wa no longer alon for advanc toward
her were two cloak figur in whom i recogn hart and mart
there she stood with outstretch arm and toward her stealthili as
lion stalk a buck came hart and mart moreov between the nake
bough of the fallen elm i caught sight of what look like the outlin
of a close carriag stand upon the drive also i heard a hors
stamp upon the frosti ground round the edg of the littl glade i ran
keep in the dark shadow as i went cock the pistol that wa in my
pocket then suddenli i dart out and stood between hart and mart and
miss holm
not a word pass between us i think that all three of us
subconsci were anxiou not to awak the sleep woman know
that if we did so there would be a terribl scene onli after motion
to me to stand asid of cours in vain hart and mart drew from their
robe curv and cruellook knive and bow for even now their
polit did not forsak them i bow back and when i straighten
myself those enterpris eastern found that i wa cover the heart
of hart with my pistol then with that percept which is part of the
mental outfit of the great thei saw that the game wa up sinc i could
have shot them both befor a knife touch me
you have won thi time o watcherbynight whisper hart softli
but anoth time you will lose that beauti ladi belong to us and
the peopl of the white kendah for she is mark with the holi mark of
the young moon the call of the child of heaven is heard in her heart
and will bring her home to the child as it ha brought her to us
tonight now lead her henc still sleep o brave and clever on so
well name watcherbynight
then thei were gone and present i heard the sound of hors be
driven rapidli along the drive
for a moment i hesit as to whether i would or would not run in and
shoot those hors two consider stai me the first wa that
if i did so my pistol would be empti or even if i shot on hors
and retain a barrel load with it i could onli kill a singl man
leav myself defenceless against the knife of the other the second
consider wa that now as befor i did not wish to wake up miss
holm
i crept to her and not know what els to do took hold of on of her
outstretch hand she turn and came with me at onc as though she
knew me remain all the while fast asleep thu we went back to the
hous through the still open door up the stairwai straight to her own
room on the threshold of which i loos her hand the room wa dark and
i could see noth but i listen until i heard a sound as of a person
throw herself upon the bed and draw up the blanket then know
that she wa safe for a while i shut the door which open outward
as door of ancient make sometim do and set against it a littl tabl
that stood in the passag
next after reflect for a minut the circumst be awkward in
mani wai i went to my room and lit a candl obvious it wa my
duti to inform lord ragnal of what had happen and that as soon as
possibl but i had no idea in what part of that huge build hi
sleep place might be nor for patent reason wa it desir
that i should disturb the hous and so creat talk in thi dilemma i
rememb that lord ragnal confidenti servant mr savag when he
conduct me to my room on the previou night which he made a point of
do perhap becaus he wish to talk over the matter of the snake
that had found their wai into hi pocket had shown me a bell in it
which he said rang outsid hi door he call it an emerg bell i
remark idli that it wa improb that i should have ani occas for
it us
who know sir said mr savag prophet there ar folk who sai
that thi old castl is haunt which after what i have seen tonight
i can well believ if you should chanc to meet a ghost look let us
sai like those black villain harum and scarum or whatev thei call
themselveswel sir two better compani than on
i consid that bell but wa loath to ring it for the reason i have
given then i went outsid the room and look as i had hope might be
the case there ran the wire on the face of the wall connect along it
length by other wire with the variou room it pass
i set to work and follow that wire it wa not an easi job inde
onc or twice it remind me of that stori of the old greek hero who
found hi wai through a labyrinth by mean of a silken thread i forget
whether it were a bull or a ladi he wa look for but with care and
persever he found on or the other or it mai have been both
down staircas and variou passag i went with my ey glu upon the
wire which occasion got mix up with other wire till at length
it led me through a swing door cover with red baiz into what appear
to be a modern annex to the castl here at last it termin on
the spring of an alarminglook and deepthroat bell that hung
immedi over a certain door
on thi door i knock hope that it might be that of mr savag and
prai earnestli that it did not enclos the chast restingplac of
the cook or ani other femal too late i mean after i had knock
it occur to me that if so my posit would be pain to a degre
howev in thi particular fortun stood my friend which doe not
alwai happen to the virtuou for present i heard a voic which i
recogn as that of mr savag ask not without a certain quaver
in it tone
who the devil is that
me i repli be fluster
me wont do said the voic me might be harum or it might be
scarum or it might be someon wors who me
allan quatermain you idiot i whisper through the keyhol
anna who well never mind go awai hanna ill talk to you in the
morn
then i kick the door and at length veri cautious mr savag
open it
good heaven sir he said what ar you do here sir dress
too at thi hour and with the handl of a pistol stick out of your
pocketor is itth head of a snake and he jump back a strang
and state figur in a long white nightshirt which appar he wore
over hi undercloth
i enter the room and shut the door whereon he polit hand me a
chair remark
is it ghost sir or ar you ill or is it harum and scarum of whom
i have been think all night veri cold too sir be afraid to pull
up the bedcloth for fear lest there might be more reptil in them
he point to hi dresscoat hang on the back of anoth chair with
both the pocket turn insid out ad tragic to think sir
that thi new coat ha been a nest of snake which i have hate like
poison from a child and me almost a teetotal
ye i said impati it harum and scarum as you call them take
me to lord ragnal bedroom at onc
ah sir burgl i suppos or mayhap wors he exclaim as he
threw on some miscellan garment and seiz a lifepreserv which
hung upon a hook now im readi onli i hope thei have left their
snake behind i never could bear the sight of a snake and thei seem to
know itth brute
in due cours we reach lord ragnal room which mr savag enter
and in answer to a stifl inquiri exclaim
mr allan quatermain to see you my lord
what is it quatermain he ask sit up in bed and yawn have
you had a nightmar
ye i answer and savag have left us and shut the door i told
him everyth as it is written down
great heaven he exclaim when i had finish if it had not been
for you and your intuit and courag
never mind me i interrupt the question iswhat should be done
now ar you go to try to arrest these men or will youhold your
tongu and mere caus them to be watch
realli i dont know even if we can catch them the whole stori would
sound so strang in a lawcourt and all sort of thing might be
suggest
ye lord ragnal it would sound so strang that i beg you will come
at onc to see the evid of what i tell you befor rain or snow
obliter them bring anoth wit with you ladi longden
perhap
ladi longden why on might as well write to the time i have it
there savag he is faith and can be silent
so savag wa call in and while lord ragnal dress himself
hurriedli told the outlin of hi stori under pain of instant dismiss
if he breath a word realli to watch hi face wa as good as a plai
so astonish wa he that all he could ejacul wa
the blackheart villain well thei aint friendli with snake for
noth
then have made sure that miss holm wa still in her room we went
down the twist stair and through the side doorwai lock the door
after us by now the dawn wa break and there wa enough light to
enabl me in certain place where the snow that fell after the gale
remain to show lord ragnal and savag the impress of the littl
bedroom slipper which miss holm wore and of my stocking feet
follow after
in the plantat thing were still easier for everi detail of the
movement of the four of us could be trace moreov on the back drive
wa the spoor of the hors and the mark of the wheel of the carriag
that had been brought for the purpos of the abduct also my great
good fortun for thi seem to prove my theori we found a parcel
wrap in nativ linen that appear to have fallen out of the carriag
when hart and mart made their hurri escap as on of the wheel had
gone over it it contain an eastern woman dress and veil intend
i suppos to be us in disguis miss holm who thenceforward
would have appear to be the wife or daughter of on of the abductor
savag discov thi parcel which he lift onli to drop it with a
yell for underneath it lai a torpid snake doubtless on of those that
had been us in the perform
of these discoveri and mani other detail on our return to the hous
lord ragnal made full note in a pocketbook that when complet were
sign by all three of us
there is not much more to tell that is of thi part of the stori the
matter wa put into the hand of detect who discov that the
eastern had driven to london where all trace of the carriag which
convei them wa lost thei howev embark upon a steamer call
the antelop togeth with two nativ women who probabl had been
provid to look after miss holm and sail that veri afternoon for
egypt thither of cours it wa useless to follow them in those dai
even if it had been advis to do so
to return to miss holm she came down to breakfast look veri
charm but rather pale again i sat next to her and took some
opportun to ask her how she had rest that night
she repli veri well and yet veri ill sinc although she never
rememb sleep more soundli in her life she had experienc all
sort of queer dream of which she could rememb noth at all a
circumst that annoi her much as she wa sure that thei were most
interest then she ad
do you know mr quatermain i found a lot of mud on my dressinggown
thi morn and my bedroom slipper were also a mass of mud and wet
through how do you account for that it is just as though i had been
walk about outsid in my sleep which is absurd as i never did such
a thing in my life
not feel equal to the invent of ani convinc explan of
these phenomena i upset the marmalad pot on to the tabl in such a wai
that some of it fell upon her dress and then cover my retreat with
profus apolog understand my dilemma for he had heard someth
of thi talk lord ragnal came to my aid with a startl statement of
which i forget the purport and thu that crisi pass
shortli after breakfast scroop announc to miss manner that her
carriag wa wait and we depart befor i went as it chanc
i had a few privat word with my host with miss holm and with the
magnific mr savag to the last by the wai i offer a tip which
he refus sai that after all we had gone through togeth he could
not allow monei to come between us by which he meant to pass from my
pocket to hi lord ragnal ask me for both my english and my african
address which he note in hi pocketbook then he said
realli quatermain i feel as though i had known you for year instead
of three dai if you will allow me i will add that i should like to
know a great deal more of you he wa destin to do so poor fellow
though neither of us knew it at the time if ever you come to england
again i hope you will make thi hous your headquart
and if ever you come to south africa lord ragnal i hope you will
make my fourroom shanti on the berea at durban your headquart you
will get a hearti welcom there and someth to eat but littl more
there is noth i should like better quatermain circumst have
put me in a certain posit in thi countri still to tell you the
truth there is a great deal about the life of which i grow veri tire
but you see i am go to be marri and that i fear mean an end
of travel sinc natur my wife will wish to take her place in
societi and the rest
of cours i repli for it is not everi young ladi who ha the luck
to becom an english peeress with all the etcetera is it still i
am not so sure but that miss holm will take to travel some dai
although i am sure that she would do better to stai at home
he look at me curious then ask
you dont think there is anyth realli seriou in all thi busi
do you
i dont know what to think i answer except that you will do well
to keep a good ey upon your wife what those eastern tri to do last
night and i think year ago thei mai try again soon or year henc
for evid thei ar patient and determin men with much to win
also it is a curiou coincid that she should have that mark upon her
which appeal so strongli to messr hart and mart and to be brief
she is in some wai differ from most young women as she said to
me herself last night lord ragnal we ar surround by mysteri
mysteri of blood of inherit spirit of thi world gener in
which it is probabl that we all descend from quit a few common
ancestor and beyond these ar other mysteri of the measureless
univers to which we belong that mai alreadi be exercis their strong
and secret influenc upon us as perhap did we know it thei have
done for million of year in the infinit whenc we came and whither we
go
i suppos i spoke somewhat solemnli for he said
do you know you frighten me a littl though i dont quit understand
what you mean then we part
with miss holm my convers wa shorter she remark
it ha been a great pleasur to me to meet you i do not rememb
anybodi with whom i have found myself in so much sympathyexcept on
of cours it is strang to think that when we meet again i shall be a
marri woman
i do not suppos we shall ever meet again miss holm your life is
here mine is in the wildest place of a wild land far awai
oh ye we shall she answer i learn thi and lot of other
thing when i held my head in that smoke last night
then we also part
lastli mr savag arriv with my coat goodby mr quatermain he
said if i forget everyth els i shall never forget you and those
villain harum and scarum and their snake i hope it wont be my lot
ever to clap ey on them again mr quatermain and yet somehow i dont
feel so sure of that
nor do i i repli with a kind of inspir after which follow
the episod of the reject tip
chapter vi
the bona fide gold mine
fulli two year had gone by sinc i bade farewel to lord ragnal and
miss holm and when the curtain draw up again behold me seat on the
stoep of my littl hous at durban plung in reflect and veri sad
inde why i wa sad i will explain present
in that interv of time i had heard onc or twice about lord ragnal
thu i receiv from scroop a letter tell of hi lordship marriag
with miss holm which it appear had been a veri fine affair
inde quit on of the event of the london season two royalti
attend the ceremoni a duke wa the best man and the present
accord to all account were superb and of great valu includ a
priceless pearl necklac given by the bridegroom to the bride a cut
from a societi paper which scroop enclos dwelt at length upon the
splendid appear of the bridegroom and the sweet loveli of the
bride also it describ her dress in languag which wa greek to me
on sentenc howev interest me intens
it ran the bride occas some comment by wear onli on ornament
although the ragnal famili diamond which have not seen the light for
mani year ar known to be some of the finest in the countri it wa
a necklac of what appear to be larg but rather roughli polish
rubi to which hung a small effigi of an egyptian god also fashion
from a rubi it must be ad that although of an unusu natur on
such an occas thi jewel suit her dark beauti well ladi ragnal
select of it howev from the mani she possess wa the caus of
much specul when ask by a friend why she had chosen it she is
report to have said that it wa to bring her good fortun
now why did she wear the barbar marriag gift of hart and mart in
prefer to all the other gem at her dispos i wonder the thing
wa so strang as to be almost uncanni
the second piec of inform concern thi pair reach me through
the medium of an old time newspap which i receiv over a year
later it wa to the effect that a son and heir had been born to lord
ragnal and that both mother and child were do well
so there the end to a veri curiou littl stori thought i to myself
well dure those two year mani thing befel me first of all in
compani with my old friend sir stephen somer i made the expedit to
pongoland in search of the wonder orchid which he desir to add
to hi collect i have alreadi written of that journei and our
extraordinari adventur and need therefor allud to it no more here
except to sai that dure the cours of it i wa sore tempt to
travel to the territori north of the lake in which the pongo dwelt
much did i desir to see whether messr hart and mart would in truth
appear to conduct me to the land where the wonder eleph which wa
suppos to be anim by an evil spirit wa wait to be kill by
my rifl howev i resist the impuls as inde our circumst
oblig me to do in the end we return safe to durban and here i
came to the conclus that never again would i risk my life on such mad
expedit
ow to circumst which i have detail elsewher i wa now in
possess of a consider sum of cash and thi i determin to lai
out in such a fashion as to make me independ of hunt and trade
in the wilder region of africa as usual when monei is forthcom an
opportun soon present itself in the shape of a gold mine which had
been discov on the border of zululand on of the first that wa
ever found in those district a jew trader name jacob brought it to
my notic and offer me a half share if i would put up the capit
necessari to work the mine i made a journei of inspect and convinc
myself that it wa inde a wonder proposit i need not enter into
the particular nor to tell the truth have i ani desir to do so for
the subject is still pain to me further than to sai that thi jew
and some friend of hi pan out visibl gold befor my ey and
then reveal to me the magnific quartz reef from which as thei
demonstr it had been wash in the bygon ag of the world the
new of our discoveri spread like wildfir and as whatev els i
might be everyon knew that i wa honest in the end a small compani
wa form with allan quatermain esq as the chairman of the bona fide
gold mine limit
oh that compani often to thi dai i dream of it when i have
indigest
our capit wa small 10000 of which the jew who wa well name
jacob and hi friend took half for noth of cours as the
purchas price of their right i thought the proport larg and said
so especi after i had ascertain that these right had cost them
exactli three dozen of squarefac gin a brokendown wagon four cow
past the bear ag and 5 in cash howev when it wa point out
to me that by their peculiar knowledg and geniu thei had locat and
provid the valu of a properti of enorm potenti worth moreov
that thi sum wa to be paid to them in scrip which would onli be
realiz when success wa assur and not in monei after a night of
anxiou consider i gave wai
person befor i consent to accept the chairmanship which carri
with it a salari of 100 a year which i never got i bought and paid
for in cash share to the valu of 1000 sterl i rememb that
jacob and hi friend seem surpris at thi act of mine as thei
had offer to give me five hundr of their share for noth in
consider of the guarante of my name these i refus sai that
i would not ask other to invest in a ventur in which i had no actual
monei stake whereon thei accept my decis not without enthusiasm
in the end the balanc of 4000 wa subscrib and we got to work work
is a good name for it so far as i wa concern for never in all my
dai have i gone through so harrow a time
we began by wash a certain patch of gravel and obtain result which
seem realli astonish so remark were thei that on public
the share rose to 10 premium jacob and co took advantag of
thi opportun to sell quit half of their bonu hold to eager
applic explain to me that thei did so not for person profit
which thei scorn but to broaden the basi of the undertak by
admit fresh blood
it wa shortli after thi boom that the gravel surround the rich
patch becam veri gravelli inde and it wa determin that we should
bui a small batteri and begin to crush the quartz from which the gold
wa suppos to flow in a pactolian stream we negoti for that
batteri through a cape town firm of engineersbut why follow the
melancholi busi in all it detail the share began to decreas in
valu thei shrank to their origin price of 1 then to 15 then
to 10 jacob he wa manag director explain to me that it
wa necessari to support the market as he wa alreadi do to an
enorm extent and that i as chairman ought to take a lead in thi
good work in order to show my faith in the concern
i took a lead to the extent of anoth 500 which wa all that i could
afford i admit that it wa a shock to such trust in human natur as
remain to me when i discov subsequ that the 1000 share
which i bought for my 500 had realli been the properti of jacob
although thei appear to be sold to me in variou other name
the crisi came at last for befor that batteri wa deliv our
avail fund were exhaust and no on would subscrib anoth
halfpenni debentur it is true had been issu and taken up to the
extent of about 1000 out of the 5000 offer though who bought them
remain at the time a mysteri to me ultim a meet wa call to
consid the question of liquid the compani and at thi meet
after three sleepless night i occupi the chair
when i enter the room to my amaz i found that of the five
director onli on wa present besid myself an honest old retir
sea captain who had bought and paid for 300 share jacob and the two
friend who repres hi interest had it appear taken ship that
morn for cape town whither thei were summon to attend variou
rel who had been seiz with ill
it wa a stormi meet at first i explain the posit to the best
of my abil and when i had finish wa assail with a number of
question which i could not answer to the satisfact of myself or
of anybodi els then a gentleman the owner of ten share who had
evid been drink suggest in plain languag that i had cheat
the sharehold by issu fals report
i jump up in a furi and although he wa twice my size ask him to
come and argu the question outsid whereon he promptli went awai thi
incid excit a laugh and then the whole truth came out a man with
colour blood in him stood up and told a stori which wa subsequ
prove to be true jacob had emploi him to salt the mine by mix
a heavi sprinkl of gold in the gravel we had first wash which the
colour man swore he did in innoc and subsequ had defraud
him of hi wage that wa all i sank back in my chair overcom then
some good fellow in the audienc who had lost monei himself in the
affair and whom i scarc knew got up and made a nobl speech which
went far to restor my belief in human natur
he said in effect that it wa well known that i allan quatermain
after work like a hors in the interest of the sharehold had
practic ruin myself over thi enterpris and that the real thief
wa jacob who had made track for the cape take with him a larg
cash profit result from the sale of share final he conclud by
call for three cheer for our honest friend and fellow suffer mr
allan quatermain
strang to sai the audienc gave them veri heartili inde i thank
them with tear in my ey sai that i wa glad to leav the room as
poor as i had ever been but with a reput which my conscienc as
well as their kind assur me wa quit unblemish
thu the windingup resolut wa pass and that meet came to
an end after shake hand with my deliver from a most unpleas
situat i walk homeward with the lightest heart in the world my
monei wa gone it wa true also my overconfid in other had led
me to make a fool of myself by accept as fact on what i believ
to be the evid of my ey that which i had not suffici expert
knowledg to verifi but my honour wa save and as i have again and
again seen in the cours of life monei is noth when compar with
honour a remark which shakespear made long ago though like mani other
truth thi is on of which a full appreci can onli be gain by
person experi
not veri far from the place where our meet had been held i pass a
side street then in embryo for it had onli on or two hous situat
in their garden and a rather larg and muddi sluit of water run
down on side at the edg of the footpath save for two peopl thi
street wa empti but that pair attract my attent thei were
a white man in whom i recogn the stout and halfintox
individu who had accus me of cheat the compani and then depart
and a wither old hottentot who at that distanc nearli a hundr
yard awai much remind me of a certain han
thi han i must explain wa origin a servant of my father who
wa a missionari in the cape coloni and had been my companion in
mani adventur thu in my youth he and i alon escap when dingaan
murder retief and hi parti of boer and he had been on of my
parti in our quest for the wonder orchid the record of which i have
written down in the holi flower
see the book call marieeditor
han had hi weak point among which must be count hi love of
liquor but he wa a gallant and resourc old fellow as inde he had
ampli prove upon that orchidseek expedit moreov he love me
with a love pass the love of women now have acquir some
monei in a wai i need not stop to describefor is it not written
elsewhereh wa settl as a kind of littl chief on a farm not veri
far from durban where he live in great honour becaus of the fame of
hi deed
the white man and han if han it wa were engag in violent
alterc whereof snatch float to me on the breez spoken in the
dutch tongu
you dirti littl hottentot shout the white man wave a stick
ill cut the liver out of you what do you mean by nose about after
me like a jackal and he struck at han who jump asid
son of a fat white sow scream han in answer for the moment i
heard hi voic i knew that it wa han did you dare to call the baa
a thief ye a thief o rooter in the mud o feeder on filth and worm
o hog of the gutterth baa the clip of whose nail is worth
more than you and all your famili he whose honour is as clear as the
sunlight and whose heart is cleaner than the white sand of the sea
ye i did roar the white man for he got my monei in the gold
mine
then hog why did you run awai why did you not wait to tell him so
outsid that hous
ill teach you about run awai you littl yellow dog repli the
other catch han a cut across the rib
oh you want to see me run do you said han skip back a few
yard with wonder agil then look
thu speak he lower hi head and charg like a buffalo fair
in the middl he caught that white man caus him to doubl up fly
backward and land with a most resound splash in the deepest part of
the muddi sluit here i mai remark that as hi shin ar the weakest
a hottentot head is by far the hardest and most danger part of him
inde it seem to partak of the natur of a cannon ball for
without more than temporari disturb to it possessor i have seen a
halfload wagon go over on of them on a muddi road
have deliv thi home thrust han bolt round a corner and
disappear while i wait trembl to see what happen to hi
adversari to my relief nearli a minut later he crept out of the sluit
cover with mud and drip with water and hobbl off slowli down the
street hi head so near hi feet that he look as though he had been
fold in two and hi hand press upon what i believ is medic
known as the diaphragm then i also went upon my wai roar with
laughter often i have heard hottentot call the lowest of mankind
but reflect i thei can at ani rate be good friend to those who
treat them wella fact of which i wa to have further proof er long
by the time i reach my hous and had fill my pipe and sat myself
down in the dilapid cane chair on the veranda that natur reaction
set in which so often follow rejoic at the escap from a great
danger it wa true that no on believ i had cheat them over that
thriceaccurs gold mine but how about other matter
i muse upon the bibl narr of jacob and esau with a new and veri
poignant sympathi for esau i wonder what would becom of my jacob
jacob i mean the origin prosper exceedingli as a result of
hi deal in porridg and as thought i probabl would hi art
descend who so appropri bore hi name as a matter of fact i do
not know what becam of him but bear hi talent in mind i think
it probabl that like van koop under some other patronym he ha now
been reward with a titl by the british govern at ani rate i
had eaten the porridg in the shape of worthless but dearli purchas
share after labour hard at the chase of the golden calf while
brother jacob had got my inherit or rather my monei probabl he
wa now count it over in sovereign upon the ship and snigger as
he thought of the sharehold meet with me in the chair well
he wa a thief and would run hi road to whatev end is appoint for
thiev so why should i bother my head more about him as i had kept my
honourlet him take my save
but i had a son to support and now what wa i to do with scarc three
hundr pound a good stock of gun and thi littl durban properti
left to me in the world commerc in all it shape i renounc onc
and for ever it wa too highor too lowfor me so it would seem that
there remain to me onli my old busi of profession hunt onc
again i must seek those adventur which i had forsworn when my evil
star shone so brightli over a gold mine what wa it to be eleph i
suppos sinc these ar the onli creatur worth kill from a monei
point of view but most of my old haunt had been more or less shot out
the competit of younger profession of wander backveld boer
and even of poach nativ who had obtain gun wa grow sever
if i went at all i should have to travel farther afield
whilst i medit thu turn over the compar advantag
or disadvantag of variou possibl hunt ground in my mind my
attent wa caught by a kind of cough that seem to proce from the
farther side of a larg gardenia bush it wa not a human cough but
rather resembl that made by a certain small buck at night probabl
to signal to it mate which of cours it could not be as there were no
buck within sever mile yet i knew it came from a human throat for
had i not heard it befor in mani an hour of difficulti and danger
draw near han i said in dutch and instantli out of a clump of
alo that grew in front of the pomegran hedg crept the wither
shape of the old hottentot as a big yellow snake might do why he
should choos thi method of advanc instead of that offer by the
garden path i did not know but it wa quit in accord with hi
secret natur inherit from a hundr gener of ancestor who
spent their live avoid the observ of murder foe
he squat down in front of me stare in a vacant wai at the fierc
ball of the wester sun without blink an eyelid just as a vultur
doe
you look to me as though you had been fight han i said the
crown of your hat is knock out you ar splash with mud and there is
the mark of a stick upon your left side
ye baa you ar right as usual baa i had a quarrel with a man
about sixpenc that he ow me and knock him over with my head
forget to take my hat off first therefor it is spoil for which
i am sorri as it wa quit a new hat not two year old the baa gave
it me he bought it in a store at utrecht when we were come back from
pongoland
why do you lie to me i ask you have been fight a white man
and for more than sixpenc you knock him into a sluit and the mud
splash up over you
ye baa that is so your spirit speak truli to you of the matter
yet it wander a littl from the path sinc i fought the white man for
less than sixpenc i fought him for love which is noth at all
then you ar even a bigger fool than i took you for han what do you
want now
i want to borrow a pound baa the white man will take me befor
the magistr and i shall be fine a pound or fourteen dai in the
trunk ie jail it is true that the white man struck me first but
the magistr will not believ the word of a poor old hottentot against
hi and i have no wit he will sai han you were drunk again
han you ar a liar and deserv to be flog which you will be next
time pai a pound and ten shill more which is the price of good
white justic or go to the trunk for fourteen dai and make basket
there for the great queen to us baa i have the price of the justic
which is ten shill but i want to borrow the pound for the fine
han i think that just now you ar better abl to lend me a pound than
i am to lend on to you my bag is empti han
is it so baa well it doe not matter if necessari i can make
basket for the great white queen to put her food in for fourteen dai
or mat on which she will wipe her feet the trunk is not such a bad
place baa it give time to think of the white man justic and to
thank the great on in the sky becaus the littl sin on did not do
have been found out and punish while the big sin on did do
such aswel never mind baashav not been found out at all your
reverend father the predik alwai taught me to have a thank
heart baa and when i rememb that i have onli been in the trunk
for three month altogeth who if all were known ought to have been
there for year i rememb hi word baa
why should you go to the trunk at all han when you ar rich and
can pai a fine even if it were a hundr pound
a month or two ago it is true i wa rich baa but now i am poor i
have noth left except ten shill
han i said sever you have been gambl again you have been
drink again you have sold your properti and your cattl to pai your
gambl debt and to bui squarefac gin
ye baa and for no good it seem though it is not true that i have
been drink i sold the land and the cattl for 650 baa and with
the monei i bought other thing
what did you bui i said
he fumbl first in on pocket of hi coat and then in the other and
ultim produc a crumpl and dirtylook piec of paper that
resembl a banknot i took and examin thi document and next minut
nearli faint it certifi that han wa the proprietor of i know not
how mani debentur or share i forget which thei were in the bona
fide gold mine limit that same compani of which i wa the unlucki
chairman in consider for which he had paid a sum of over six
hundr and fifti pound
han i said feebli from whom did you bui thi
from the baa with the hook nose baa he who wa name jacob after
the great man in the bibl of whom your father the predik us to
tell us that on who wa so slim and dress himself up in a goatskin
and gave hi brother meali porridg when he wa hungri after he had
come in from shoot buck baa and got hi farm and cattl baa and
then went to heaven up a ladder baa
and who told you to bui them han
sammi baa he who wa your cook when we went to pongoland he who hid
in the mealiepit when the slaver burn bezatown and came out half
cook like a fowl from the oven the baa jacob stop at sammi
hotel baa and told him that unless he bought bit of paper like thi
of which he had plenti you would be brought befor the magistr and
sent to the trunk baa so sammi bought some baa but not mani for
he had onli a littl monei and the baa jacob paid him for all he at
and drank with other bit of paper then sammi came to me and show me
what it wa my duti to do remind me that your reverend father the
predik had left you in my charg till on of us di whether you
were well or ill and whether you got better or got worsejust like a
white wife baa so i sold the farm and the cattl to a friend of the
baa jacob at a veri low price baa and that is all the stori
i heard and to tell the honest truth almost i wept sinc the thought
of the sacrific which thi poor old hottentot had made for my sake on
the instig of a rogu utterli overwhelm me
han i ask recov myself tell me what wa that new name which
the zulu captain mavovo gave you befor he di i mean after you had
fire bezatown and caught hassan and hi slaver in their own trap
han who had suddenli found someth that interest him extrem
out at sea perhap becaus he did not wish to wit my grief turn
round slowli and answer
mavovo name me lightindark and by that name the kafir know me
now baa though some of them call me lordofthefir
then mavovo name you well for inde han you shine like a light in
the dark of my heart i whom you think wise am but a fool han who
ha been trick by a vernuk a common cheat and he ha trick you
and sammi as well but as he ha shown me that man can be veri vile you
have shown me that he can be veri nobl and set the on against
the other my spirit that wa in the dust rise up onc more like a
wither flower after rain lightindark although if i had ten
thousand pound i could never pai you backsinc what you have given
me is more than all the gold in the world and all the land and all the
cattleyet with honour and with love i will try to pai you and i held
out my hand to him
he took it and press it against hi wrinkl old forehead then
answer
talk no more of that baa for it make me sad who am so happi how
often have you forgiven me when i have done wrong how often have you
not flog me when i should have been flog for be drunk and other
thingsy even when onc i stole some of your powder and sold it to
bui squarefac gin though it is true i knew it wa bad powder not fit
for you to us did i thank you then overmuch why therefor should you
thank me who have done but a littl thing not realli to help you but
becaus as you know i love gambl and wa told that thi bit of
paper would soon be worth much more than i gave for it if it had prove
so should i have given you that monei no i should have kept it myself
and bought a bigger farm and more cattl
han i said sternli if you lie so hard you will certainli go to
hell as the predik my father often told you
not if i lie for you baa or if i do it doesnt matter except that
then we should be separ by the big kloof written of in the book
especi as there i should meet the baa jacob as i veri much want to
do for a reason of my own
not wish to pursu thi somewhat unchristian line of thought i
inquir of him why he felt happi
oh baa he answer with a twinkl in hi littl black ey cant
you guess why now you have veri littl monei left and i have none at
all therefor it is plain that we must go somewher to earn monei
and i am glad of that baa for i am tire of sit on that farm out
there and grow meali and milk cow especi as i am too old
to marri baa as you ar tire of look for gold where there isnt
ani and sing sad song in that hous of meet yonder like you did
thi afternoon oh the great father in the ski knew what he wa about
when he sent the baa jacob our wai he beat us for our good baa as
he doe alwai if we could onli understand
i reflect to myself that i had not often heard the doctrin of the
church better or more concis put but i onli said
that is true han and i thank you for the lesson the second you have
taught me todai but where ar we to go to han rememb it must be
eleph
he suggest some place inde he seem to have come provid with a
list of them and i sat silent make no comment at length he finish
and squat there befor me chew a bit of tobacco i had given him
and look up at me interrog with hi head on on side for all
the world like a dilapid and inquisit bird
han i said do you rememb a stori i told you when you came to see
me a year or more ago about a tribe call the kendah in whose countri
there is said to be a great cemeteri of eleph which travel there
to die from all the land about a countri that li somewher to the
northeast of the lake island on which the pongo us to dwell
ye baa
and you said i think that you had never heard of such a peopl
no baa i never said anyth at all i have heard a good deal about
them
then why did you not tell me so befor you littl idiot i ask
indignantli
what wa the good baa you were hunt gold then not ivori why
should i make you unhappi and wast my own breath by talk about
beauti thing which were far beyond the reach of either of us far as
that sky
dont ask fool question but tell me what you know han tell me at
onc
thi baa when we were up at bezatown after we came back from
kill the gorillagod and the baa stephen your friend lai sick and
there wa noth els to do i talk with everyon i could find worth
talk to and thei were not mani baa but there wa on veri old
woman who wa not of the mazitu race and whose husband and children
were all dead but whom the peopl in the town look up to and fear
becaus she wa wise and made medicin out of herb and told fortun
i us to go to see her she wa quit blind baa and fond of talk
with mewhich show how wise she wa i told her all about the pongo
gorillagod of which alreadi she knew someth when i had done she
said that he wa as noth compar with a certain god that she
had seen in her youth seven ten of year ago when she becam
marriag i ask her for that stori and she spoke it thu
far awai to the north and east live a peopl call the kendah who ar
rule over by a sultan thei ar a veri great peopl and inhabit a most
fertil countri but all round their countri the land is desol and
manless peopl onli by game for the reason that thei will suffer none
to dwell there that is why nobodi know anyth about them he that
come across the wilder into that land is kill and never return
to tell of it
she told me also that she wa born of thi peopl but fled becaus
their sultan wish to place her in hi hous of women which she did
not desir for a long while she wander southward live on root
and berri till she came to desert land and at last worn out lai
down to die then she wa found by some of the mazitu who were on an
expedit seek ostrich feather for warplum thei gave her food
and see that she wa fair brought her back to their countri where
on of them marri her but of her own land she utter onli ly
word to them becaus she fear that if she told the truth the god who
guard it secret would be aveng on her though now when she wa near
to death she dread them no more sinc even the kendah god cannot
swim through the water of death that is all she said about her journei
becaus she had forgotten the rest
bother her journei han what did she sai about her god and the kendah
peopl
thi baa that the kendah have not on god but two and not on ruler
but two thei have a good god who is a childfetish here i start
that speak through the mouth of an oracl who is alwai a woman if
that woman di the god doe not speak until thei find anoth woman
bear certain mark which show that she hold the spirit of the god
befor the woman di she alwai tell the priest in what land thei ar
to look for her who is to come after her but sometim thei cannot find
her and then troubl fall becaus the child ha lost it tongu and
the peopl becom the prei of the other god that never di
and what is that god han
that god baa is an eleph here i start again a veri bad
eleph to which human sacrific is offer i think baa that it is
the devil wear the shape of an eleph at least that is what she
said now the sultan is a worshipp of the god that dwell in the
eleph jana here i posit whistl and so ar most of the
peopl inde all those among them who ar black for onc far awai
in the begin the kendah were two peopl but the lightercolour
peopl who worship the child came down from the north and conquer
the black peopl bring the child with them or so i understood her
baa thousand and thousand of year ago when the world wa young
sinc then thei have flow on side by side like two stream in the same
channel never mix for each keep it own colour onli she said
that stream which come from the north grow weaker and that from the
south more strong
then why doe not the strong swallow up the weak
becaus the weak ar still the pure and the wise baa or so the old
vrouw declar becaus thei worship the good while the other worship
the devil and as your father the predik us to sai good is the
cock which alwai win the fight at the last baa ye when he seem
to be dead he get up again and kick the devil in the stomach and
stand on him and crow baa also these northern folk ar mighti
magician through their childfetish thei give rain and fat season and
keep awai sick wherea jana give onli evil gift that have to do
with cruelti and war and so forth lastli the priest who rule through
the child have the secret of wealth and ancient knowledg wherea the
sultan and hi follow have onli the might of the spear thi wa the
song which the old woman sang to me baa
why did you not tell me of these matter when we were at bezatown and
i could have talk with her myself han
for two reason baa the first wa that i fear if i told you
you would wish to go on to find these peopl wherea i wa tire of
travel and want to come to natal to rest the second wa that
on the night when the old woman finish tell me her stori she wa
taken sick and di and therefor it would have been no us to bring
you to see her so i save it up in my head until it wa want
moreov baa all the mazitu declar that old woman to be the
greatest of liar
she wa not altogeth a liar han hear what i have learn and i
told him of the magic of hart and mart and of the pictur that i had
seem to see of the eleph jana and of the prayer that hart and
mart had made to me to all of which he listen quit stolidli it is
not easi to astonish a hottentot brain which often draw no accur
dividinglin between the possibl and what the modern world hold to be
imposs
ye baa he said when i had finish then it seem that the old
woman wa not such a liar after all baa when shall we start after
that hoard of dead ivori and which wai will you go by kilwa or through
zululand it should be settl soon becaus of the season
after thi we talk togeth for a long while for with pocket as
empti as mine were then the problem seem difficult if not insolubl
chapter vii
lord ragnal stori
that night han slept at my hous or rather outsid of it in the
garden or upon the stoep sai that he fear arrest if he went to
the town becaus of hi quarrel with the white man as it happen
howev the other parti concern never stir further in the
busi probabl becaus he wa too drunk to rememb who had knock
him into the sluit or whether he had gravit thither by accid
on the follow morn we renew our discuss debat in detail
everi possibl method of reach the kendah peopl by help of such
mean as we could command like that of the previou night it prove
somewhat abort obvious such a long and hazard expedit ought
to be properli financ andwher wa the monei at length i came
to the conclus that if we went at all it would be best in the
circumst for han and myself to start alon with a scotch cart
drawn by oxen and driven by a coupl of zulu hunter which we could
lade with ammunit and a few necessari
thu lightli equip we might work through zululand and thenc
northward to bezatown the capit of the mazitu where we were sure of
a welcom after that we must take our chanc it wa probabl that
we should never reach the district where these kendah were suppos to
dwell but at least i might be abl to kill some eleph in the wild
countri beyond zululand
while we were talk i heard the gun fire which announc the arriv
of the english mail and step to the end of the garden saw the
steamer ly at anchor outsid the bar then i went indoor to write a
few busi letter which sinc i had becom immers in the affair
of that unlucki gold mine had grown to be almost a daili task with me
i had got through sever with mani groan for none were agreeabl
in their tenor when han poke hi head through the window in a silent
kind of a wai as a big snake might do and said baa i think there
ar two baas out on the road there who ar look for you veri fine
baas whom i dont know
sharehold in the bona fide gold mine thought i to myself then
ad as i prepar to leav through the back door if thei come here
tell them i am not at home tell them i left earli thi morn for the
congo river to look for the sourc of the nile
ye baa said han collaps on to the stoep
i went out through the back door sorrow that i allan quatermain
should have reach a rung in the ladder of life whenc i shrank from
look ani stranger in the face for fear of what he might have to sai
to me then suddenli my pride assert itself after all what wa there
of which i should be asham i would face these irat sharehold as i
had face the other yesterdai
i walk round the littl hous to the front garden which wa plant
with orang tree and up to a big moonflow bush i believ datura

my domain from the road there a convers wa in progress if so it
mai be call

familiar to me for i never forget voic though i am unabl to place

drawingroom at ragnal castl and of an impos majordomo introduc
into it two whiterob arablook men

i recogn your voic on the road and came to see if i wa right
pleas walk in that is if it is i whom you wish to visit
as i spoke i studi them both and observ that while savag

surround the time that had pass sinc we met had chang lord

those whom no on that had seen him would ever forget but now hi
handsom face wa stamp with some new seal of suffer i felt at

to eat hi dinner and i ask lord ragnal where hi luggag wa he
repli that he had left it at the custom then i said i will send
a nativ with savag to arrang about get it up here if you do not

you have come to africa
disast he repli disast of the worst sort
is your wife dead lord ragnal

me
an idea leapt to my mind to the effect that she might have run awai with
somebodi els a thing which often happen in the world but fortun
i kept it to myself and onli said
she wa nearli lost onc befor wa she not
ye when you save her oh if onli you had been with us quatermain

i rememb her tell me that our great good fortun made her feel
afraid on dai last septemb when i wa out shoot she drove in a
littl poni cart we had with the nurs and the child but no man to

of the process march a larg bull eleph which i discov
afterward wa an illtemp brute that had alreadi kill a man and
should never have been allow upon the road the sight of the poni
cart or perhap a red cloak which my wife wa wear as she alwai
like bright colour for some unknown reason seem to have infuri

and overturn the cart right in front of the anim but appar
without hurt anybodi thenher he paus a moment and with
an effort continuedthat devil in beast shape cock it ear

tip of it trunk as though to make sure that it wa dead next onc
more it trumpet triumphantli and without attempt to harm my wife
or anybodi els walk quietli past the broken cart and continu it
journei until outsid the town it wa made fast and shot
what an aw stori i said with a gasp
ye but there is wors to follow my poor wife went off her head with
the shock i suppos for no physic injuri could be found upon her she
did not suffer in health or becom violent quit the revers inde
for her gentl increas she just went off her head for hour at
a time she would sit silent and smile plai with the stone of that
red necklac which those conjur gave her or rather count them
as a nun might do with the bead of her rosari at time howev she
would talk but alwai to the babi as though it lai befor her or she
were nurs it oh quatermain it wa piti piti
i did everyth i could she wa seen by three of the greatest
braindoctor in england but none of them wa abl to help the onli
hope thei gave wa that the fit might pass off as suddenli as it had
come thei said too that a thorough chang of scene would perhap be
benefici and suggest egypt that wa in octob i did not take
much to the idea i dont know why and person should not have
acced to it had it not been for a curiou circumst the last
consult took place in the big drawingroom at ragnal when it wa
over my wife remain with her mother at on end of the room while i and
the doctor talk togeth at the other as i thought quit out of her
earshot present howev she call to me sai in a perfectli
clear and natur voic
ye georg i will go to egypt i should like to go to egypt then
she went on plai with the necklac and talk to the imaginari
child
again on the follow morn as i came into her room to kiss her she
exclaim
when do we start for egypt let it be soon
with these sai the doctor were veri pleas declar that thei
show sign of a return interest in life and beg me not to
thwart her wish
so i gave wai and in the end we went to egypt togeth with ladi
longden who insist upon accompani us although she is a wretch
sailor at cairo a larg dahabeeyah that i had hire in advanc man
by an excel crew and a guard of four soldier wa await us in
it we start up the nile for a month or more all went well also to
my delight my wife seem now and again to show sign of return
intellig thu she took some interest in the sculptur on the wall
of the templ about which she had been veri fond of read when in
health i rememb that onli a few dai befor theth catastroph
she point out on of them to me it wa of isi and the infant horu
sai look georg the holi mother and the holi child and then
bow to it rever as she might have done to an altar at length
after pass the first cataract and the island of phil we came to
the templ of abu simbel opposit to which our boat wa moor on the
follow morn we explor the templ at daybreak and saw the sun
strike upon the four statu which sit at it farther end spend
the rest of that dai studi the coloss figur of rames that ar
carv upon it face and watch some cavalcad of arab mount upon
camel travel along the bank of the nile
my wife wa unusu quiet that afternoon for hour after hour she sat
still upon the deck gaze first at the mouth of the rockhewn templ
and the mighti figur which guard it and then at the surround
desert onli onc did i hear her speak and then she said beauti
beauti now i am at home we dine and as there wa no moon went
to bed rather earli after listen to the sudanes singer as thei sang
on of their weird chanti
my wife and her mother slept togeth in the state cabin of the
dahabeeyah which wa at the stern of the boat my cabin a small on
wa on on side of thi and that of the train nurs on the other the
crew and the guard were forward of the saloon a gangwai wa fix from
the side to the shore and over it a sentri stood or wa suppos to
stand dure the night a khamsin wind began to blow though lightli as
wa to be expect at thi season of the year i did not hear it for as
a matter of fact i slept veri soundli as it appear did everyon els
upon the dahabeeyah includ the sentri as i suspect
the first thing i rememb wa the appear of ladi longden just
at daybreak at the doorwai of my cabin and the frighten sound of her
voic ask if luna that is my wife wa with me then it transpir
that she had left her cabin clad in a fur cloak evid some
time befor as the bed in which she had been ly wa quit cold
quatermain we search everywher we search for four dai but from
that hour to thi no trace whatev of her ha been found
have you ani theori i ask
ye or at least all the expert whom we consult have a theori it is
that she slip down the saloon in the dark gain the deck and thenc
fell or threw herself into the nile which of cours would have carri
her bodi awai as you mai have heard the nile is full of bodi i
myself saw two of them dure that journei the egyptian polic
and other were so convinc that thi wa what had happen that
notwithstand the reward of a thousand pound which i offer for ani
valuabl inform thei could scarc be persuad to continu the
search
you said that a wind wa blow and i understand that the shore ar
sandi so i suppos that all footprint would have been fill in
he nod and i went on what is your own belief do you think she wa
drown
he counter my queri with anoth of
what do you think
i oh although i have no right to sai so i dont think at all i
am quit sure that she wa not drown that she is live at thi
moment
where
as to that you had better inquir of our friend hart and mart i
answer dryli
what have you to go on quatermain there is no clue
on the contrari i hold that there ar a good mani clue the whole
english part of the stori in which we were concern and the threat
those mysteri person utter ar the first and greatest of these
clue the second is the fact that your hire of the dahabeeyah
regardless of expens wa known a long time befor your arriv in
egypt for i suppos you did so in your own name which is not
exactli that of smith or brown the third is your wife sleepwalk
propens which would have made it quit easi for her to be drawn
ashor under some kind of mesmer influenc the fourth is that you had
seen arab mount on camel upon the bank of the nile the fifth is
the heavi sleep you sai held everybodi on board that particular night
which suggest to me that your food mai have been drug the sixth is
the apathi displai by those emploi in the search which suggest to
me that some person or person in author mai have been bribe as is
common in the east or perhap frighten with threat of bewitch
the seventh is that a night wa chosen when a wind blew which would
obliter all spoor whether of men or of swiftli travel camel
these ar enough to begin with though doubtless if i had time to think
i could find other you must rememb too that although the journei
would be long thi countri of the kendah can doubtless be reach
from the sudan by those who know the road as well as from southern or
eastern africa
then you think that my wife ha been kidnap by those villain hart
and mart
of cours though villain is a strong term to appli to them thei
might be quit honest men accord to their peculiar light as inde
i expect thei ar rememb that thei serv a god or a fetish or
rather as thei believ a god in a fetish who to them doubtless is
a veri terribl master especi when as i understand that god is
threaten by a rival god
why do you sai that quatermain
by wai of answer i repeat to him the stori which han said he had
heard from the old woman at beza the town of the mazitu lord ragnal
listen with the deepest interest then said in an agit voic
that is a veri strang tale but ha it struck you quatermain that
if your supposit ar correct on of the most terribl circumst
connect with my case is that our child should have chanc to come to
it dread death through the wicked of an eleph
that curiou coincid ha struck me most forcibl lord ragnal
at the same time i do not see how it can be set down as more than
a coincid sinc the eleph which slaughter your child wa
certainli not that call jana to suppos becaus there is a war
between an elephantgod and a childgod somewher in the heart of
africa that therefor anoth eleph can be so influenc that it
kill a child in england is to my mind out of all reason
that is what i said to him as i did not wish to introduc a new horror
into an affair that wa alreadi horribl enough but recollect that
these priest hart and mart believ the mother of thi murder
infant to be none other than the oracl of their worship though how
thi chanc pass my comprehens and therefor the great enemi
of the evil elephantgod i confess that at heart i felt afraid if ani
power of magic black or white or both were mix up with the matter
as my experi in england seem to suggest who could sai what might
be their exact limit as howev it ha been demonstr again and
again by the learn that no such thing as african magic exist thi
line of thought appear to be too foolish to follow so pass it by i
ask lord ragnal to continu
for over a month he went on i stop in egypt wait till
emissari who had been sent to the chief of variou tribe in the
sudan and elsewher return with the new that noth whatsoev had
been seen of a white woman travel in the compani of nativ nor
had thei heard of ani such woman be sold as a slave also through the
khediv on whom i wa abl to bring influenc to bear by help of
the british govern i caus mani harem in egypt to be visit
entir without result after thi leav the inquiri in the hand of
the british consul and a firm of french lawyer although in truth all
hope had gone i return to england whither i had alreadi sent ladi
longden brokenheart for it occur to me as possibl that my wife
might have drift or been taken thither but here too there wa no
trace of her or of anybodi who could possibl answer to her descript
so at last i came to the conclus that her bone must lie somewher at
the bottom of the nile and gave wai to despair
alwai a foolish thing to do i remark
you will sai so inde when you hear the end quatermain my
bereav and the sleepless which it caus prai upon me so
much for now that the child wa dead my wife wa everyth to me
that i will tell you the truth my brain becam affect and like job i
curs god in my heart and determin to die inde i should have di
by my own hand had it not been for savag i had procur the laudanum
and load the pistol with which i propos to shoot myself immedi
after it wa swallow so that there might be no mistak on night onli
a coupl of month or so ago quatermain i sat in my studi at ragnal
with the door lock as i thought write a few final letter befor
i did the deed the last of them wa just finish about twelv when
hear a nois i look up and saw savag stand befor me i ask
him angrili how he came there i suppos he must have had anoth kei to
on of the other door and what he want ignor the first part of
the question he repli
my lord i have been think over our troubleh wa with us in
egypti have been think so much that it ha got a hold of my sleep
tonight as you said you did not want me ani more and i wa tire i
went to bed earli and had a dream i dream that we were onc more in
the shrubberi as happen some year ago and that the littl african
gent who shot like a book wa show us the trace of those two black
men just as he did when thei tri to steal her ladyship then in my
dream i seem to go back to bed and that beastli snake which we found
ly under the parcel in the road seem to follow me when i had got
to sleep again all in the dream there it wa stand on it tail
at the end of the bed hiss till it woke me then it spoke in good
english and not in african as might have been expect
savag it said get up and dress yourself and go at onc and tell
hi lordship to travel to natal and find mr allan quatermain you mai
rememb that wa the african gentleman name my lord which with so
mani come and go in thi great hous i had quit forgotten until
i had the dream find mr allan quatermain that slimi reptil went
on open and shut it mouth for all the world like a christian
make a speech for he will have someth to tell him as to that
which ha made a hole in hi heart that is now fill with the seven
devil be quick savag and dont stop to put on your shirt or your
tiei have not my lord as you mai see he is shut up in the studi
but you know how to get into it if he will not listen to you let him
look round the studi and he will see someth which will tell him that
thi is a true dream
then the snake vanish seem to wriggl down the left bottom
bedpost and i woke up in a cold sweat my lord and did what it had
told me
those were hi veri word quatermain for i wrote them down afterward
while thei were fresh in my memori and you see here thei ar in my
pocketbook
well i answer him rather brusqu i am afraid for a craze man
who is about to leav the world under such circumst doe not show
at hi best when disturb almost in the veri act to the edg of which
long agoni ha brought him i told him that all hi dream of snake
seem ridicul which obvious it wa and wa about to send him
awai when it occur to me that the suggest it convei that i
should put myself in commun with you wa not ridicul in view
of the part you had alreadi plai in the stori
veri far from ridicul i interpol
to tell the truth went on lord ragnal i had alreadi thought of
do the same thing but somehow beneath the pressur of my immin
grief the idea wa squeez out of my mind perhap becaus you were so
far awai and i did not know if i could find you even if i tri paus
for a moment befor i dismiss savag i rose from the desk at which i
wa write and began to walk up and down the room think what i would
do i am not certain if you saw it when you were at ragnal but it is
a larg room fifti feet long or so though not veri broad it ha two
fireplac in both of which fire were burn on thi night and it
wa lit by four stand lamp besid that upon my desk now between
these fireplac in a kind of nich in the wall and a littl in the
shadow becaus none of the lamp wa exactli opposit to it hung a
portrait of my wife which i had caus to be paint by a fashion
artist when first we becam engag
i rememb it i said or rather i rememb it exist i did not
see it becaus a curtain hung over the pictur which savag told me
you did not wish to be look at by anybodi but yourself at the time
i remark to him or rather to myself that to veil the like of a
live woman in such a wai seem to me rather an illomen thing to
do though why i should have thought it so i do not quit know
you ar quit right quatermain i had that foolish fanci a lover
freak i suppos when we marri the curtain wa remov although the
brass rod on which it hung wa left by some oversight on my return to
england after my loss howev i found that i could not bear to
look upon thi lifeless like of on who had been taken from me so
cruelli and i caus it to be replac i did more in order that it
might not be disturb by some dust housemaid i myself made it fast
with three or four tintack which i rememb i drove through the velvet
stuff into the panel us a fireiron as a hammer at the time
i thought it a good job although by accid i struck the nail of the
third finger of my left hand so hard that it came off look it ha not
quit finish grow again and he show the finger on which the new
nail wa still in process of format
well as i walk up and down the room some impuls caus me to look
toward the pictur to my astonish i saw that it wa no longer
veil although to the best of my belief the curtain had been drawn
over it as late as that afternoon inde i could have sworn that thi
wa so i call to savag to bring the lamp that stood upon my tabl
and by it light made an examin the curtain wa drawn back veri
tidili be fasten in it place clear of the littl alcov by mean
of a thin brass chain also along on edg of it that which i had
nail to the panel the tintack were still in their place that
is three of them were the fourth i found afterward upon the floor
she look beauti doesnt she my lord said savag and pleas
god so we shall still find her somewher in the world
i did not answer him or even remark upon the withdraw of the
curtain as to which inde i never made an inquiri i suppos that
it wa done by some zealou servant while i wa pretend to eat my
dinnerther were on or two new on in the hous whose name and
appear i did not know what impress itself upon my mind wa that
the face which i had never expect to see again on the earth even in
a pictur wa onc more given to my ey it matter not how thi in
my excit state for laudanum wait to be swallow and a pistol at
full cock for fire do not induc calm in a man alreadi almost mad
at ani rate until thei have fulfil their offic did in truth appear
to me to be someth of the natur of a sign such as that spoken of
in savag idiot dream which i wa to find if i look round the
studi
savag i said i dont think much of your dream about snake that
talk to you but i do think that it might be well to see mr quatermain
todai is sundai and i believ that the african mail sail on fridai go
to town earli tomorrow and book passag
also i told him to see variou gunsmith and bid them send down a
select of rifl and other weapon for me to choos from as i
did not know whither we might wander in africa and to make further
necessari arrang all of these thing he did andher we ar
ye i answer reflect here you ar what is more here is
your luggag of which there seem to be enough for a regiment and i
point to a scotch cart pile up with baggag and follow by a
long line of kafir carri sundri packag upon their head that
marshal by savag had halt at my gate
chapter viii
the start
that even when the baggag had been dispos of and lock up in my
littl stabl and arrang were made for the deliveri of some case
contain tin food etc which had prove too heavi for the scotch
cart lord ragnal and i continu our convers first howev we
unpack the gun and check the ammunit of which there wa a larg
suppli with more to follow
a beauti batteri thei were of all sort from eleph gun down the
most costli and best finish that monei could bui at the time it made
me shiver to think what the bill for them must have been while their
appear when thei were put togeth and stood in a long line against
the wall of my sittingroom move old han to a kind of ecstasi for a
long while he contempl them pat the stock on after the other
and give to each a name as though thei were all aliv then exclaim
with such weapon as these the baa could kill the devil himself
still let the baa bring intombi with hima favourit old rifl of
mine and a mere toi in size that had howev done me good servic in
the past as those who have read what i have written in mari and
the holi flower mai rememb for baa after all the wife of on
youth often prove more to be trust than the fine young on a man
bui in hi ag also on know all her fault but who can sai how
mani there mai be hidden up in new women howev beautifulli thei ar
tattoo and he point to the elabor engrav upon the gun
i translat thi speech to lord ragnal it made him laugh at which
i wa glad for up till then i had not seen him even smile i should
add that in addit to these sport weapon there were no fewer than
fifti militari rifl of the best make thei were largebor snider
that had just then been put upon the market and with them pack in
tin case a great quantiti of ammunit although the regul
were not so strict then as thei ar now i met with a great deal of
difficulti in get all thi armament through the custom lord
ragnal howev had letter from the coloni offic to such author
as rule in natal and on our give a joint undertak that thei were
for defens purpos onli in unexplor territori and not for sale
thei were allow through fortun did it prove for us in after dai
that thi matter wa arrang
that night befor we went to bed i narrat to lord ragnal all the
histori of our search for the holi flower which he seem to find veri
entertain also i told him of my adventur to me far more terribl
as chairman of the bona fide gold mine and of their melancholi end
the lesson of which is he remark when i had finish that becaus
a man is master of on trade it doe not follow that he is master of
anoth you ar i should judg on of the finest shot in the
world you ar also a great hunter and explor but when it come to
compani quatermain still he went on i ought to be grate
to that bona fide gold mine sinc i gather that had it not been for
it and for your rascal friend mr jacob i should not have found you
here
no i answer it is probabl that you would not as by thi time
i might have been far in the interior where a man cannot be trace and
letter do not reach him
then he made a few point inquiri about the affair of the mine
note my answer down in hi pocketbook i thought thi odd but
conclud that he wish to verifi my statement befor enter into
a close companionship with me sinc for aught he knew i might be the
largest liar in the world and a swindler to boot so i said noth
even when i heard through a roundabout channel on the morrow that he had
sought an interview with the late secretari of the defunct compani
a few dai later for i mai as well finish with thi matter at onc the
astonish object of these inquiri wa made clear to me on morn
i found upon my tabl a whole pile of correspond at the sight
of which i groan feel sure that it must come from dun and be
connect with that infern mine curios and a desir to face the
worst howev led me to open the first letter which as it happen
prove to be from that veri sharehold who had propos a vote of
confid in me at the windingup meet by the time that it wa
finish my ey were swim and realli i felt quit faint it ran
honour siri knew that i wa put my monei on the right hors
when i said the other dai that you were on of the straightest that ever
ran well i have got the chequ sent me by the lawyer on your account
be payment in full for everi farth i invest in the bona fide
gold mine and i can onli sai that it is uncommonli us for that
busi had pretti well clean me out god bless you mr quatermain
i open anoth letter and anoth and anoth thei were all to the
same effect bewild i went on to the stoep where i found han with
an epistl in hi hand which he request me to be good enough to read
i read it it wa from a wellknown firm of local lawyer and said
on behalf of allan quatermain esq we beg to enclos a draft for
the sum of 650 be the valu of the interest in the bona fide gold
compani limit in liquid which stand in your name on the
book of the compani pleas sign enclos receipt and return same to
us
ye and there wa the draft for 650 sterl
i explain the matter to han or rather i translat the document
ad
you see you have got your monei back again but han i never sent it
i dont know where it come from
is it monei baa ask han survei the draft with suspicion it
look veri much like the other bit of paper for which i paid monei
again i explain reiter that i knew noth of the transact
well baa he said if you did not send it someon didperhap
your father the reverend predik who see that you ar in troubl and
wish to wash your name white again meanwhil baa pleas put that
bit of paper in your pocketbook and keep it for me for otherwis i
might be tempt to bui squarefac with it
no i answer you can now bui your land back or some other land
and there will be no need for you to come with me to the countri of the
kendah
han thought a moment and then veri deliber began to tear up the
draft inde i wa onli just in time to save it from destruct
if the baa is go to turn me off becaus of thi paper he said i
will make it small and eat it
you silli old fool i said as i possess myself of the chequ
then the convers wa interrupt for who should appear but sammi
my old cook who began in hi pompou languag
the perfect rectitud of your conduct mr quatermain move me to the
deepest gratitud though inde i wish that i had put someth into
the food of the knave jacob who beguil us all that would have caus
him intern pang of a sever if not of a danger order my hold
in the gold mine wa not extens but the unpaid bill of the said
jacob and hi friend
here i cut him short and fled sinc i saw yet anoth sharehold
gallop to the gate and behind him two more in a spider first i took
refug in my room my idea be to put awai that pile of letter in so
do i observ that there wa on still unopen half mechan
i took it from the envelop and glanc at it content thei were
word for word ident with those of that address to mr han
hottentot onli my name wa at the bottom of it instead of that of han
and the chequ wa for 1500 the amount i had paid for the share i
held in the ventur
feel as though my brain were in a meltingpot i depart from the
hous into a patch of nativ bush that in those dai still grew upon the
slope of the hill behind here i sat myself down as i had often
done befor when there wa a knotti point to be consid aimlessli
watch a love emerald cuckoo flash a jewel of light from tree
to tree while i turn all thi fairygodmoth busi over in my
mind
of cours it soon becam clear to me lord ragnal in thi case wa
the littl old ladi with the wand the touch of which could convert
worthless share certif into banknot of their face valu i
rememb now that hi wealth wa said to be phenomen and after
all the cash capit of the compani wa quit small but the question
wascould i accept hi bounti
i return to the hous where the first person whom i met wa lord
ragnal himself just arriv from some interview about the fifti snider
rifl which were still in bond i told him solemnli that i wish to
speak to him whereon he remark in a cheer voic
advanc friend and all well
i dont know that i need set out the detail of the interview he
wait till i had got through my halt speech of mingl gratitud and
expostul then remark
my friend if you will allow me to call you so it is quit true that i
have done thi becaus i wish to do it but it is equal true that to
me it is a small thingto be frank scarc a month incom what i
have save travel on that ship to natal would pai for it all also
i have weigh my own interest in the matter for i am anxiou that you
should start upon thi hazard journei of our up countri with a mind
absolut free from selfreproach or ani monei care for thu you will
be abl to do me better servic therefor i beg that you will sai no
more of the episod i have onli on thing to add name that i have
myself bought up at par valu a few of the debentur the price of them
will pai the lawyer and the liquid fee moreov thei give me a
statu as a sharehold which will enabl me to sue mr jacob for hi
fraud to which busi i have alreadi issu instruct for pleas
understand that i have not paid off ani share still stand in hi
name or in those of hi friend
here i mai add that noth ever came of thi action for the lawyer
found themselv unabl to serv ani writ upon that elus person
mr jacob who by then had probabl adopt the name of some other
patriarch
pleas put it all down as a rich man whim he conclud
i cant call that a whim which ha return 1500 odd to my pocket
that i had lost upon a gambl lord ragnal
do you rememb quatermain how you won 250 upon a gambl at my place
and what you did with it which sum probabl repres to you twenti
or fifti time what it would to me also if that argument doe not
appeal to you mai i remark that i do not expect you to give me your
servic as a profession hunter and guid for noth
ah i answer fix on thi point and ignor the rest now
we come to busi if i mai look upon thi amount as salari a veri
handsom salari by the wai paid in advanc you take the risk of my
dy or becom incapacit befor it is earn i will sai no more
of the matter if not i must refus to accept what is an unearn gift
i confess quatermain that i did not regard it in that light though i
might have been will to call it a retain fee howev do not let
us wrangl about monei ani more we can alwai settl our account when
the bill is ad up if ever we reach so far now let us come to more
import detail
so we fell to discuss the scheme rout and detail of our propos
journei expenditur be practic no object there were sever
plan open to us we might sail up the coast and go by kilwa as i had
done on the search for the holi flower or we might retrac the line of
our retreat from the mazitu countri which ran through zululand again
we might advanc by whatev road we select with a small armi of
drill and disciplin retain trust to forc to break a wai
through to the kendah or we might go practic unaccompani reli
on our nativ wit and good fortun to attain our end each of these
altern had so much to recommend it and yet present so mani
difficulti that after long hour of discuss for thi talk wa
renew again and again i found it quit imposs to decid upon
ani on of them especi as in the end lord ragnal alwai left the
choic with it heavi respons to me
at length in despair i open the window and whistl twice on a certain
low note a minut later han shuffl in shake the wet off the new
corduroi cloth which he had bought upon the strength of hi return to
affluenc for it wa rain outsid and squat himself down upon
the floor at a littl distanc in the shadow of the tabl which cut off
the light from the hang lamp he look i rememb exactli like
an enorm and antiqu toad i threw him a piec of tobacco which he
thrust into hi corncob pipe and lit with a match
the baa call me he said when it wa draw to hi satisfact
what doe baa want of han
light in dark i repli plai on hi nativ name and
proceed to set out the whole case to him
he listen without a word then ask for a small glass of gin which
i gave him doubtfulli have swallow thi at a gulp as though it were
water he deliv himself briefli to thi effect
i think the baa will do well not to go to kilwa sinc it mean
wait for a ship or hire on also there mai be more slavetrad
there by now who will bear him no love becaus of a lesson he taught
them a while ago on the other hand the road through zululand is open
though it be long and there the name of macumazana is on well known
i think also that the baa would do well not to take too mani men who
make march slow onli a wagon or two and some driver which might be
sent back when thei can go no farther from zululand messeng can be
dispatch to the mazitu who love you and bausi or whoever is king
there todai will order bearer to meet us on the road until which time
we can hire other bearer in zululand the old woman at bezatown told
me moreov as you will rememb that the kendah ar a veri great
peopl who live by themselv and will allow none to enter their land
which is border by desert therefor no forc that you could take
with you and feed upon a road without water would be strong enough to
knock down their gate like an eleph and it seem better that you
should try to creep through them like a wise snake although thei appear
to be shut in your face perhap also thei will not be shut sinc did
you not sai that two of their great doctor promis to meet you and
guid you through them
ye i interrupt i dare sai it will be easier to get in than to
get out of kendahland
last of all baa if you take mani men arm with gun the black part
of the kendah peopl of whom i told you will perhap think you come to
make war whatev the white kendah mai sai and kill us all wherea if
we be but a few perchanc thei will let us pass in peac i think that
is all baa let the baa and the lord igeza forgiv me if my word ar
foolish
here i should explain that igeza wa the name which the nativ
had given to lord ragnal becaus of hi appear the word mean a
handsom person in the zulu tongu savag thei call bena i dont
know why bena in zulu mean to push out the breast and it mai be
that the name wa a roundabout allus to the proud appear of the
dignifi savag or possibl it had some other recondit signif
at ani rate lord ragnal han and myself knew the splendid savag
thenceforward by the home appel of bean hi master said it
suit him veri well becaus he wa so green
the advic seem wise han go now no no more gin i answer
as a matter of fact care consider convinc us it wa so wise
that we act on it down to the last detail
so it came about that on fine afternoon about a fortnight later for
hurri as we would our prepar took a littl time we trek for
zululand over the sandi road that ran from the outskirt of durban
our baggag and store were stow in two halftent wagon veri good
wagon sinc everyth we had with us wa the best that monei could
bui the afterpart of which serv us as sleepingplac at night
han sat on the voorkiss or drivingseat of on of the wagon lord
ragnal savag and i were mount upon salt hors that is hors
which had recov from and were therefor suppos to be proof against
the dread sick valuabl and docil anim which were train to
shoot
at our start a littl contretemp occur to my amaz i saw
savag who insist upon continu to wear hi funer upper
servant cutawai coat engag with grim determin in mount hi
steed from the wrong side he got into the saddl somehow but there
wa wors to follow the hors astonish at such treatment bolt
a littl wai savag saw at it mouth lord ragnal and i canter
after it past the wagon fear disast all of a sudden it swerv
violent and savag flew into the air land heavili in a sit
postur
poor bean ejacul lord ragnal as we sped forward i expect
there is an end of hi journei
to our surpris howev we saw him leap from the ground with the most
marvel agil and begin to danc about slap at hi posterior
part and shout
take it off kill it
a few second later we discov the reason the hors had shi at
a sleep puff adder which wa curl up in the sand of that littl
frequent road and on thi puff adder savag had descend with
so much forc for he weigh thirteen stone that the creatur wa
squash quit flat and never stir again thi howev he did not
notic in hi agit be convinc inde that it wa hang to
him behind like a bulldog
snake my lord he exclaim when at last after care search we
demonstr to him that the adder had di befor it could come into
action
i hate em my lord and thei haunt he said aunt me if ever
i get out of thi ill go and live in ireland my lord where thei
sai there aint none but it isnt like that i shall he ad
mournfulli for the omen is horrid
on the contrari i answer it is splendid for you have kill the
snake and not the snake you the dog it wa that di savag
after thi the kafir gave savag a second veri long name which meant
hewhositsdownonsnakesandmakesthemflat have remount him
on hi hors which wa stand patient a few yard awai at
length we got off i linger a minut behind the other to give some
direct to my old griqua garden jack who snivel at part
with me and to take a last look at my littl home alack i fear it
might be the last inde know as i did that thi wa a danger
enterpris upon which i found myself embark i who had vow that i
would be done with danger
with a lump in my throat i turn from the contempl of that
peac dwell and happi garden in which each tree and plant wa dear
to me and wave a goodby to jack canter on to where ragnal wa
wait for me
i am afraid thi is rather a sad hour for you who ar leav your
littl boi and your home he said gentli to face unknown peril
not so sad as other i have pass i answer and peril ar my
daili bread in everi sens of the word moreov whatev it is for me
it is for you also
no quatermain for me it is an hour of hope a faint hope i admit
but the onli on left for the letter i got last night from egypt and
england report that no clue whatsoev ha been found and inde that
the search for ani ha been abandon ye i follow the last star left
in my sky and if it set i hope that i mai set also at ani rate to thi
world therefor i am happier than i have been for month thank to
you and he stretch out hi hand which i shook
it wa a token of friendship and mutual confid which i am glad to
sai noth that happen afterward ever disturb for a moment
chapter ix
the meet in the desert
now i do not propos to describ all our journei to kendahland or at
ani rate the first part thereof it wa interest enough in it wai
and we met with a few hunt adventur also some other but there is
so much to tell of what happen to us after we reach the place that
i have not the time even if i had the inclin to set all these
matter down let it be suffici then to sai that although ow
to polit event the countri happen to be rather disturb at the
time we trek through zululand without ani great difficulti for
here my name wa a power in the land and all parti unit to help me
thenc too i manag to dispatch three messeng halfbr border
men lean fellow and swift of foot forward to the king of the mazitu
as han had suggest that i should do advis him that hi old
friend macumazana watcherbynight and the yellow man who wa name
lightindark and lordofthefir were about to visit him again
as i knew we could not take the wagon beyond a certain point where
there wa a river call the luba unford by anyth on wheel i
request him moreov to send a hundr bearer with whatev escort
might be necessari to meet us on the bank of that river at a spot
which wa known to both of us these word the messeng promis to
deliv for a fee of five head of cattl apiec to be paid on their
return or to their famili if thei di on the road which cattl we
purchas and left in charg of a chief who wa their kinsman as it
happen two of the poor fellow did die on of them of cold in a swamp
through which thei took a short cut and the other at the teeth of a
hungri lion the third howev won through and deliv the messag
after rest for a fortnight in the northern part of zululand to give
time to our wayworn oxen to get some flesh on their bone in the warm
bushveld where grass wa plenti even in the dry season we trek
forward by a rout known to han and myself inde it wa the
same which we had follow on our journei from mazituland after our
expedit in search for the holi flower
we took with us a small armi of zulu bearer thi although thei were
difficult to feed in a countri where no corn could be bought prove
fortun in the end sinc so mani of our cattl di from tsets bite
that we were oblig to abandon on of the wagon which meant that
the good it contain must be carri by men at length we reach the
bank of the river and camp there on night by three tall peak
of rock which the nativ call the three doctor where i had
instruct the messeng to tell the mazitu to meet us for four dai
we remain here sinc rain in the interior had made the river quit
impass everi morn i climb the tallest of the doctor and
with my glass look over it broad yellow flood search the wide
bushclad land beyond in the hope of discov the mazitu advanc to
meet us not a man wa to be seen howev and on the fourth even
as the river had now becom fordabl we determin that we would cross
on the morrow leav the remain wagon which it wa imposs to
drag over it rocki bottom to be taken back to natal by our driver
here a difficulti aros no promis of reward would induc ani of our
zulu bearer even to wet their feet in the water of thi river luba
which for some reason that i could not extract from them thei declar
to be tagati that is bewitch to peopl of their blood when i
point out that three zulu had alreadi undertaken to cross it thei
answer that those men were halfbre so that for them it wa onli
half bewitch but thei thought that even so on or more of them would
pai the penalti of death for thi rash crime
it chanc that thi happen for as i have said two of the poor
fellow did die though not i think ow to the magic properti
of the water of the luba thi is how african superstit ar kept
aliv sooner or later some sai of the sort fulfil itself and then
the instanc is rememb and hand down for gener while
other instanc in which noth out of the common ha occur ar not
heed or ar forgotten
thi decis on the part of those stupid zulu put us in an awkward
fix sinc it wa imposs for us to carri over all our baggag and
ammunit without help therefor glad wa i when befor dawn on the
fifth morn the nocturn han crept into the wagon in the after
part of which ragnal and i were sleep and inform us that he heard
men voic on the farther side of the river though how he could hear
anyth abov that roar of water pass my comprehens
at the first break of dawn again we climb the tallest of the doctor
rock and stare into the mist at length it roll awai and there on
the farther side of the river i saw quit a hundr men who by their
dress and spear i knew to be mazitu thei saw me also and rais a
cheer dash into the water group of them hold each other round
the middl to prevent their be swept awai thereupon our silli zulu
seiz their spear and form up upon the bank i slid down the steep
side of the great doctor and ran forward call out that these were
friend who came
friend or foe answer their captain sullenli it is a piti that
we should walk so far and not have a fight with those mazitu dog
well i drove them off to a distanc not know what might happen if
the two peopl met and then went down to the bank by now the mazitu
were near and to my delight at the head of them i perceiv no other
than my old friend their chief gener babemba a oneei man with
whom han and i had share mani adventur through the water he plung
with great bound and reach the shore greet me liter with
raptur
o macumazana he said littl did i hope that ever again i should
look upon your face welcom to you a thousand welcom and to you
too lightindark lordofthefir cunningon whose wit save us
in the battl of the gate but where is dogeetah where is wazeela and
where ar the mother and the child of the flower
far awai across the black water babemba i answer but here ar
two other in place of them and i introduc him to ragnal and savag
by their nativ name of igeza and bena
he contempl them for a moment then said
thi point to ragnal is a great lord but thi point to
savag who wa much the better dress of the two is a cock of the
ashpit arrai in an eagl feather a remark i did not translat
but on which caus han to snigger vacuous
while we breakfast on food prepar by the cock of the ashpit who
amongst mani other merit had that of be an excel cook i heard
all the new bausi the king wa dead but had been succeed by on
of hi son also name bausi whom i rememb bezatown had been
rebuilt after the great fire that destroi the slaver and much more
strongli fortifi than befor of the slaver themselv noth more
had been seen or of the pongo either though the mazitu declar that
their ghost or those of their victim still haunt the island in the
lake that wa all except the ill tide as to two of our messeng
which the third who had return with the mazitu report to us
after breakfast i address and sent awai our zulu each with a
handsom present from the trade good give into their charg the
remain wagon and our servant none of whom somewhat to my relief
wish to accompani us farther thei sang their song of goodby
salut and depart over the rise still look hungrili behind them
at the mazitu and we were veri pleas to see the last of them without
bloodsh or troubl
when we had watch the white tilt of the wagon vanish we set to work
to get ourselv and our good across the river thi we accomplish
safe for the mazitu work for us like friend and not as do hire
men on the farther bank howev it took us two full dai so to divid
up the load that the bearer could carri them without be overladen
at length all wa arrang and we start of the month trek that
follow there is noth to tell except that we complet it without
notabl accid and at last reach the new bezatown which much
resembl the old where we were accord a great public recept
bausi ii himself head the process which met us outsid the south
gate on that veri mound which we had occupi in the great fight where
the bone of the gallant mavovo and my other hunter lai buri almost
did it seem to me as though i could hear their deep voic join in
the shout of welcom
that night while the mazitu feast in our honour we held an indaba
in the big new guest hous with bausi ii a pleasantfac young
man and old babemba the king ask us how long we meant to stai at
bezatown intim hi hope that the visit would be prolong i
repli but a few dai as we were travel far to the north to find
a peopl call the kendah whom we wish to see and hope that he
would give us bearer to carri our good as far as the confin of their
countri at the name of kendah a look of astonish appear upon
their face and babemba said
ha mad seiz you macumazana that you would attempt thi thing
oh sure you must be mad
you thought us mad babemba when we cross the lake to rica town yet
we came back safe
true macumazana but compar to the kendah the pongo were but as the
smallest star befor the face of the sun
what do you know of them then i ask but staybefor you answer
i will speak what i know and i repeat what i had learn from han
who confirm my word and from hart and mart leav out howev
ani mention of their deal with ladi ragnal
it is all true said babemba when i had finish for that old woman
of whom lightinthedark speak wa on of the wive of my uncl
and i knew her well hearken these kendah ar a terribl nation and
countless in number and of all the peopl the fiercest their king is
call simba which mean lion he who rule is alwai call simba
and ha been so call for hundr of year he is of the black kendah
whose god is the eleph jana but as lightindark ha said there
ar also the white kendah who ar arab men the priest and trader of
the peopl the kendah will allow no stranger within their door if on
come thei kill him by torment or blind him and turn him out into the
desert which surround their countri there to die these thing the
old woman who marri my uncl told me as she told them to
lightindark also i have heard them from other and what she
did not tell me that the white kendah ar great breeder of the beast
call camel which thei sell to the arab of the north go not near
them for if you pass the desert the black kendah will kill you and
if you escap these then their king simba will kill you and if you
escap him then their god jana will kill you and if you escap him
then their white priest will kill you with their magic oh long befor
you look upon the face of those priest you will be dead mani time
over
then why did thei ask me to visit them babemba
i know not macumazana but perhap becaus thei wish to make an
offer of you to the god jana whom no spear can harm no nor even
your bullet that pierc a tree
i am will to make trial of that matter i answer confid
and ani wai we must go to see these thing for ourselv
ye echo ragnal we must certainli go while even savag for i
had been translat to them all thi while nod hi head although he
look as though he would much rather stai behind
ask him if there ar ani snake there sir he said and foolishli
enough i put the question to give me time to think of other thing
ye o bena ye o cock of the ashpit repli babemba my uncl
kendar wife told me that on of the guardian of the shrine of the white
kendah is such a snake as wa never seen elsewher in the world
then sai to him sir said savag when i had translat almost
automat that shrine aint a church where i shall go to sai my
prayer
ala poor savag littl knew the futur and it gift
then we came to the question of bearer the end of it wa that after
some hesit bausi ii becaus of hi great affect for us
promis to provid us with these upon our solemnli undertak to
dismiss them at the border of the desert so that thei might escap
our doom as he remark cheerfulli
four dai later we start accompani by about on hundr and twenti
pick men under the command of old babemba himself who he explain
wish to be the last to see us aliv in the world thi wa depress
but other circumst connect with our start were calcul to
weigh even more upon my spirit thu the night befor we left han
arriv and ask me to write a paper for him i inquir what he
want me to put in the paper he repli that as he wa go to hi
death and had properti name the 650 that had been left in a bank to
hi credit he desir to make a white man will to be left in the
charg of babemba the onli provis of the said will wa that i wa to
inherit hi properti if i live if i di which he ad of cours
you must baa like the rest of us it wa to be devot to furnish
poor black peopl in hospit with someth comfort to drink instead
of the cow water that wa given to them there needless to sai
i turn him out at onc and that testamentari deposit remain
unrecord inde it wa unnecessari sinc as i remind him on my
advic he had alreadi made a will befor we left durban a circumst
that he had quit forgotten
the second event which occur about an hour befor our departur
wa that hear a mighti wail in the marketplac where onc han
and i had been ti to stake to be shot to death with arrow i went
out to see what wa the matter at the gatewai i wa greet by the
sight of about a hundr old women plaster all over with ash
engag in howl their loudest in a melancholi unison behind these
stood the entir popul of bezatown who chant a kind of choru
what the devil ar thei do i ask of han
sing our deathsong baa he repli stolidli as thei sai that
where we ar go no on will take the troubl to do so and it is
not right that great lord should die and the heaven abov remain
uninform that thei ar come
that cheer i remark and wheel round ask ragnal
straight out if he wish to persever in thi busi for to tell the
truth my nerv wa shaken
i must he answer simpli but there is no reason why you and han
should or savag either for the matter of that
oh im go where you go i said and where i go han will go
savag must speak for himself
thi he did and to the same effect be a veri honest and faith
man it wa the more to hi credit sinc as he inform me in privat
he did not enjoi african adventur and often dream at night of
hi comfort room at ragnal whenc he superintend the social
activ of that great establish
so we depart and march for the matter of a month or more through
everi kind of countri after we had pass the head of the great lake
wherein lai the island if it realli wa an island where the pongo us
to dwell on clear morn through my glass i discern the mountain
top that mark the former resid of the mother of the flower and by
contrast it made me feel quit homesick we struck up north follow
a rout known to babemba and our guid after thi we steer by the
star through a land with veri few inhabit timid and nondescript
folk who dwelt in scatter villag and scarc understood the art of
cultiv the soil even in it most primit form
a hundr mile or so farther on these villag ceas and thenceforward
we onli encount some nomad littl bushmen who live on game which
thei shot with poison arrow onc thei attack us and kill two
of the mazitu with those horrid arrow against the venom of which no
remedi that we had in our medicin chest prove of ani avail on thi
occas savag exhibit hi courag if not hi discret for rush
out of our thorn fenc after miss a bushmen with both barrel at a
distanc of five yardsh wa i think the worst shot i ever sawh
seiz the littl viper with hi hand and drag him back to camp how
savag escap with hi life i do not know for on poison arrow went
through hi hat and stuck in hi hair and anoth just graze hi leg
without draw blood
thi valor deed wa of great servic to us sinc we were abl
through han who knew someth of the bushmen languag to explain
to our prison that if we were shot at again he would be hung thi
inform he contriv to shout or rather to squeak and grunt to
hi amiabl tribe of which it appear he wa a kind of chief with the
result that we were no more molest later when we were clear of the
bushmen countri we let him depart which he did with great rapid
by degre the land grew more and more barren and utterli devoid of
inhabit till at last it merg into desert at the edg of thi
desert which roll awai without appar limit we came howev to
a kind of oasi where there wa a strong and beauti spring of water
that form a stream which soon lost itself in the surround sand
as we could go no farther for even if we had wish to do so and were
abl to find water there the mazitu refus to accompani us into the
desert not know what els to do we camp in the oasi and wait
as it happen the place wa a kind of hunter paradis sinc everi
kind of game larg and small came to the water to drink at night and
in the daytim brows upon the saltish grass that at thi season of the
year grew plentifulli upon the edg of the wilder
amongst other creatur there were eleph in plenti that travel
hither out of the bushland we had pass or sometim emerg from
the desert itself suggest that beyond thi wast there lai fertil
countri so numer were these great beast inde that for my part i
hope earnestli that it would prove imposs for us to continu our
journei sinc i saw that in a few month i could collect an enorm
amount of ivori enough to make me compar rich if onli i were
abl to get it awai as it wa we onli kill a few of them ten in all
to be accur that we might send back the tusk as present to bausi
ii to slaughter the poor anim uselessli wa cruel especi as
be unaccustom to the sight of man thei were as easi to approach as
cow even savag slew onebi carefulli aim at anoth five pace to
it left
for the rest we live on the fat of the land and as meat wa necessari
to us had as much sport as we could desir among the variou antelop
for fourteen dai or so thi went on till at length we grew thoroughli
tire of the busi as did the mazitu who were so gorg with flesh
that thei began to desir veget food twice we rode as far into the
desert as we dare for our hors remain to us and had grown fresh
again after the rest but onli to return without inform the place
wa just a vast wilder strewn with brown stone beautifulli polish
by the winddriven sand of ag and quit devoid of water
after our second trip on which we suffer sever from thirst we
held a consult old babemba said that he could keep hi men no
longer even for us as thei insist upon return home and inquir
what we meant to do and why we sat here like a stone i answer that
we were wait for some of the kendah who had bid me to shoot game
hereabout until thei arriv to be our guid he remark that the
kendah to the best of hi belief live in a countri that wa still
hundr of mile awai and that as thei did not know of our presenc
ani commun across the desert be imposs our proceed
seem to be foolish
i retort that i wa not quit so sure of thi sinc the kendah seem
to have remark wai of acquir inform
then macumazana i fear that you will have to wait by yourselv until
you discov which of us is right he said stolidli
turn to ragnal i ask him what he would do point out that
to journei into the desert meant death especi as we did not know
whither we were go and that to return alon without the store
which we must abandon through the countri of the bushmen to mazituland
would also be a riski proceed howev it wa for him to decid
now he grew much perturb take me apart again he dwelt earnestli
upon hi secret reason for wish to visit these kendah with which of
cours i wa alreadi acquaint as inde wa savag
i desir to stai here he end
which mean that we must all stai ragnal sinc savag will not
desert you nor will han desert me although he think us mad he point
out that i came to seek ivori and here about is ivori in plenti for the
troubl of take
i might remain alon quatermain he began but i look at him in
such a wai that he never finish the sentenc
ultim we came to a compromis babemba on behalf of the mazitu
agre to wait three more dai if noth happen dure that period
we on our part agre to return with them to a stretch of wellwat
bush about fifti mile behind us which we knew swarm with eleph
that by now were grow shy of approach our oasi where there wa so
much nois and shoot there we would kill as much ivori as we could
carri an oper in which thei were will to assist for the fun of
it and then go back with them to mazituland
the three dai went by and with everi hour that pass my spirit rose
as did those of savag and han while lord ragnal becam more and
more depress the third afternoon wa devot to a jubil pack of
load for in accord with the term of our bargain we were to start
backward on our spoor at dawn upon the morrow most happili did i lai
myself down to sleep in my littl bough shelter that night feel that
at last i wa rid of an uncommonli awkward adventur if i thought that
we could do ani good by stai on it would have been anoth matter
but as i wa certain that there wa no earthli chanc of our find
among the kendahif ever we reach themth ladi who had tumbl in
the nile in egypt well i wa glad that provid had been so good as
to make it imposs for us to commit suicid by thirst in a desert or
otherwis for notwithstand my former reason to the contrari
i wa now convinc that thi wa what had happen to poor ragnal
wife
that howev wa just what provid had not done in the middl of
the night to be precis at exactli two in the morn i wa awaken
by han who slept at the back of my shanti into which he had crept
through a hole in the faggot exclaim in a frighten voic
open your ey and look baa there ar two spook wait to see
you outsid baa
veri cautious i lift myself a littl and stare out into the
moonlight there seat about five pace from the open end of the hut
were the spook sure enough two whiterob figur squat silent
and immov on the ground at first i wa frighten then i bethought
me of thiev and felt for my colt pistol under the rug that serv me
as a pillow as i got hold of the handl howev a deep voic said
is it your custom o macumazana watcherbynight to receiv guest
with bullet
now thought i to myself who is there in the world who could see a man
catch hold of the handl of a pistol in the recess of a dark place and
under a blanket at night except the owner of that voic which i seem
to rememb hear in a certain drawingroom in england

order then hart went on in repli to your request o macumazana we
left england by a steamboat and in due cours after long journei we
reach our own countri we do not understand your allus to a place
call abusimbel on the nile whenc never have been there we have
taken no ladi inde we never meant to take that ladi to whom we sent
a necklac in england we onli meant to ask certain question of her as
she had the gift of vision when you appear and interrupt us what
should we want with white ladi who have alreadi far too mani of our
own
i dont know i repli but i do know that you ar the biggest liar
i ever met
at these word which some might have thought insult hart and mart
bow again as though to acknowledg a great compliment then hart
said

with men you ar here as we told you that you would be at a time when
you did not believ us and we here to meet you as we told you that
we would be how we knew that you were come and how we came do not

so your camel wait
on camel cannot carri four men i answer avoid the question
in courag and skill you ar more than mani men o macumazana yet in
bodi you ar but on and not four
if you think that i am go with you alon you ar much mistaken
hart and mart i exclaim here with me is my servant without whom
i do not stir and i point to han whom thei contempl grave
also there is the lord ragnal who in thi land is name igeza and
hi servant who here is name bena the man out of whom you drew snake
in the room in england thei also must accompani us
at thi new the impass counten of hart and mart show i
thought some sign of disturb thei mutter togeth in an unknown
tongu then hart said
our secret land is open to you alon o macumazana for on purpos
onlyto kill the eleph jana for which deed we promis you a great
reward we do not wish to see the other there
then you can kill your own eleph hart and mart for not on step
do i go with you why should i when there is as much ivori here as i
want to be had for the shoot
how if we take you o macumazana
how if i kill you both o hart and mart fool here ar mani brave
men at my command and if you or ani with you want fight it shall be
given you in plenti han bid the mazitu stand to their arm and summon
igeza and bena
stai lord said hart and put down that weapon for onc more i
had produc the pistol we would not begin our fellowship by shed
blood though we ar safer from you than you think your companion
shall accompani you to the land of the kendah but let them know that
thei do so at their own risk learn that it is reveal to us that if
thei go in there some of them will pass out again as spirit but not as
men
do you mean that you will murder them
no we mean that yonder ar some stronger than us or ani men who will
take their live in sacrific not your macumazana for that it is
decre is safe but those of two of the other which two we do not
know
inde hart and mart and how am i to be sure that ani of us ar
safe or that you do not but trick us to your countri there to kill us
with treacheri and steal our good
becaus we swear it by the oath that mai not be broken we swear it by
the heavenli child both of them exclaim solemnli speak with on
voic and bow till their forehead almost touch the ground
i shrug my shoulder and laugh a littl
you do not believ us went on hart who have not heard what happen
to those who break thi oath come now and see someth within five
pace of your hut is a tall antheap upon which doubtless you have been
accustom to stand and overlook the desert thi wa true but how
did thei guess it i wonder go climb that antheap onc more
perhap it wa rash but my curios led me to accept thi invit
out i went follow by han with a load doublebarrel rifl and
scrambl up the antheap which as it wa twenti feet high and there
were no tree just here command a veri fine view of the desert
beyond
look to the north said hart from it foot
i look and there in the bright moonlight five or six hundr yard
awai rang rank by rank upon a slope of sand and along the crest of
the ridg beyond i saw quit two hundr kneel camel and by each
camel a tall whiterob figur who held in hi hand a long lanc to
the shaft of which not far beneath the blade wa attach a littl
flag for a while i stare to make sure that i wa not the victim of an
illus or a mirag then when i had satisfi myself that these were
inde men and camel i descend from the antheap
you will admit macumazana said hart polit that if we had meant
you ani ill with such a forc it would have been easi for us to take a
sleep camp at night but these men come here to be your escort not
to kill or enslav you or your and macumazana we have sworn to
you the oath that mai not be broken now we go to our peopl in the
morn after you have eaten we will return again unarm and alon
then like shadow thei slip awai

and arm at first there were some sign of panic but these with the
help of babemba we manag to control set the men to make the
best prepar for defenc that circumst would allow and thu
occupi their mind for from the first we saw that except for the
three of us who had hors escap wa imposs that great camel

ten minut later the mazitu bearer had also salut us and gone
leav us seat in that desert camp surround by our baggag and
so far as i wa concern feel most lone anoth ten minut went
by which we occupi in pack our person belong then han who
wa now wash out the coffe kettl at a littl distanc look up
and said
here come the spookmen baa the whole regiment of them we ran and
look it wa true marshal in orderli squadron the camel with
their rider were sweep toward us and a fine sight the beast made
with their swai neck and long lurch gait about fifti yard awai
thei halt just where the stream from our spring enter the desert
and there proceed to water the camel twenti of them at a time two
men howev in whom i recogn hart and mart walk forward and
present were stand befor us bow obsequi

to me i know not why there wa someth horribl in all thi
jocos someth that gave me the creep as alwai doe the sight
of a cat plai with a mous i felt even then that it foreshadow
terribl thing how could these men know the detail of occurr
at which thei were not present and of which no on had told them did
that strang tobacco of their realli give them some clairvoy
power i wonder or had thei other secret method of obtain new
i glanc at poor savag and perceiv that he too felt as i did for
he had turn quit pale beneath hi tan even han wa affect for
he whisper to me in dutch these ar not men these ar devil baa
and thi journei of our is on into hell
onli ragnal sat stern silent and appar quit unmov inde
there wa someth almost sphinxlik about the set and express of
hi handsom face moreov i felt sure that hart and mart recogn
the man strength and determin and that he wa on with whom thei
must reckon serious beneath all their smile and courtesi i could
read thi knowledg in their ey also that it wa caus them grave
anxieti it wa as though thei knew that here wa on against whom their
power had no avail whose fate wa the master of their fate in a sens
hart admit thi to me for suddenli he look up and said in a
chang voic and in bantu
you ar a good reader of heart o macumazana almost as good as i am
but rememb that there is on who write upon the book of the heart
who is the lord of us who do but read and that what he write that
will befal strive as we mai for in hi hand is the futur
quit so i repli coolli and that is why i am go with you to
kendahland and fear you not at all
so it is and so let it be he answer and now lord ar you readi
to start for long is the road and who know what await us er we see
it end
ye i repli long is the road of life and who know what await us
er we see it endand after
three hour later i halt the splendid white ridingcamel upon which
i wa mount and look back from the crest of a wave of the desert
there far behind us on the horizon by the help of my glass i could
make out the site of the camp we had left and even the tall anthil
whenc i had gaze in the moonlight at our mysteri escort which
seem to have sprung from the desert as though by magic
thi wa the manner of our march a mile or so ahead of us went a picket
of eight or ten men mount on the swiftest beast doubtless to give
warn of ani danger next three or four hundr yard awai follow
a bodi of about fifti kendah travel in a doubl line and behind
these the baggag men mount like everyon els and lead behind
them string of camel laden with water provis tent of skin
and all our good includ the fifti rifl and the ammunit that
ragnal had brought from england then came we three white men and han
each of us ride as swift and fine a camel as africa can breed on
our right at a distanc of about half a mile and also on our left
travel other bodi of the kendah of the same numer strength
as that ahead while the rear wa brought up by the remaind of the
compani who drove a number of spare camel
thu we journei in the centr of a squar whenc ani escap would have
been imposs for i forgot to sai that our keeper hart and mart
rode exactli behind us at such a distanc that we could call to them if
we wish
at first i found thi method of travel veri tire as doe everyon
who is quit unaccustom to camelback inde the swing and the jolt
of the swift creatur beneath me seem to wrench my bone asund to
such an extent that at the begin i had onc or twice to be lift
from the saddl when after hour of tortur at length we camp for
the night poor savag suffer even more than i did for the motion
reduc him to a kind of jelli ragnal howev who i think had ridden
camel befor felt littl inconveni and the same mai be said of
han who rode in all sort of posit sometim sidewai like
a ladi and at other kneel on the saddl like a monkei on a
barrelorgan also be veri light and tough as rimpi the swai
motion did not seem to affect him
by degre all these troubl left us to such an extent that i could
cover my fifti mile a dai more or less without even feel tire
inde i grew to like the life in that pure and sparkl desert air
perhap becaus it wa so rest dai after dai we journei on across
the endless sandi plain watch the sun rise watch it grow high
watch it sink again night after night we at our simpl food with
appetit and slept beneath the glitter star till the new dawn broke
in glori from the bosom of the immeasur east
we spoke but littl dure all thi time it wa as though the silenc
of the wilder had got hold of us and seal our lip or perhap
each of us wa occupi with hi own thought at ani rate i know that
for my part i seem to live in a kind of dreamland think of the
past reflect much upon the innumer problem of thi pass show
call life but not pai much heed to the futur what did the futur
matter to me who did not know whether i should have a share of it even
for anoth month or week or dai surround as i wa by the shadow of
death no i troubl littl as to ani earthli futur although i admit
that in thi oasi of calm i reflect upon that state where past
present and futur will all be on also that those reflect which
were in their essenc a kind of unshap prayer brought much calm to my
spirit
with the regiment of escort we had practic no commun i think
that thei had been forbidden to talk to us thei were a veri silent set
of men finelymad capabl person of an arab type light rather than
dark in colour who seem for the most part to commun with each
other by sign or in lowmutt word evid thei look upon
hart and mart with great vener for ani order which either of
these brethren gave if thei were brethren wa obei without
disput or delai thu when i happen to mention that i had lost a
pocketknif at on of our campingplac two dai journei back three
of them much against my wish were order to return to look for it
and did so make no question eight dai later thei rejoin us much
exhaust and have lost a camel but with the knife which thei hand
to me with a low bow and i confess that i felt asham to take the
thing
nor did we exchang mani further confid with hart and mart up
to the time of our arriv at the boundari of the kendah countri our
onli talk with them wa of the incid of travel of where we should
camp of how far it might be to the next water for waterhol or old
well exist in thi desert of such bird as we saw and so forth as
to other and more import matter a kind of truce seem to prevail
still i observ that thei were alwai studi us and especi lord
ragnal who rode on dai after dai selfabsorb and stare straight
in front of him as though he look at someth we could not see
thu we cover hundr of mile not less than five hundr at the
least reckon our progress at onli thirti mile a dai includ
stoppag for occasion we stop at the waterhol or small
oas where the camel drank and rest inde these were so
conveni arrang that i came to the conclus that onc there must
have been some establish rout run across these wasteland to
the south of which the tradit knowledg remain with the kendah
peopl if so it had not been us for gener for save those of
on or two that had di on the outward march we saw no skeleton of
camel or other beast or inde ani sign of man the place wa an
absolut wilder where noth live except a few small mammal at
the oas and the bird that pass over it in the air on their wai to
more fertil region of these by the wai i saw mani that ar known
both to europ and africa especi duck and crane also stork
that for aught i can sai mai have come from faroff home holland
at last the charact of the countri began to chang grass appear on
it lowerli stretch then bush then occasion tree and among
the tree a few buck halt the caravan i crept out and shot two of
these buck with a right and left a feat that caus our grave escort to
stare in a fashion which show me that thei had never seen anyth of
the sort done befor
that night while we were eat the venison with relish sinc it wa
the first fresh meat that we had tast for mani a dai i observ that
the disposit of our camp wa differ from it common form thu it
wa smaller and place on an emin also the camel were not allow
to graze where thei would as usual but were kept within a limit area
while their rider were arrang in group outsid of them further the
store were pile near our tent in the centr with guard set over
them i ask hart and mart who were share our meal the reason of
these alter
it is becaus we ar on the border of the kendah countri answer
old hart four dai more march will bring us there macumazana
then why should you take precaut against your own peopl sure
thei will welcom you
with spear perhap macumazana learn that the kendah ar not on but
two peopl as you mai have heard befor we ar the white kendah but
there ar also black kendah who outnumb us mani time over though in
the begin we from the north conquer them or so sai our histori
the white kendah have their own territori but as there is no other
road to reach it we must pass through that of the black kendah where
it is alwai possibl that we mai be attack especi as we bring
stranger into the land
how is it then that the black kendah allow you to live at all hart
if thei ar so much the more numer
becaus of fear macumazana thei fear our wisdom and the decre of
the heavenli child spoken through the mouth of it oracl which if it
is offend can bring a curs upon them still if thei find us outsid
our border thei mai kill us if thei can as we mai kill them if we
find them within our border
inde hart then it look to me as though there were a war breed
between you
a war is breed macumazana the last great war in which either the
white kendah or the black kendah must perish or perhap both will die
togeth mayb that is the real reason why we have ask you to be our
guest macumazana and with their usual courteou bow both of them
rose and depart befor i could repli
you see how it stand i said to ragnal we have been brought here
to fight for our friend hart mart and co against their rebelli
subject or rather the king who reign jointli with them
it look like it he repli quietli but doubtless we shall find
out the truth in time and meanwhil specul is no good do you go to
bed quatermain i will watch till midnight and then wake you
that night pass in safeti next dai we march befor the dawn
pass through countri that grew continu better water and more
fertil though it wa still open plain but slope upward ever more
steepli on thi plain i saw herd of antelop and what in the distanc
look like cattl but no human be befor even we camp where
there wa good water and plenti of food for the camel
while the camp wa be set hart came and invit us to follow him to
the outpost whenc he said we should see a view we walk with him a
matter of not more than a quarter of a mile to the head of that rise up
which we had been travel all dai and thenc perceiv on of
the most gloriou prospect on which my ey have fallen in all great
africa from where we stood the land slope steepli for a matter of ten
or fifteen mile till final the fall end in a vast plain like to
the bottom of a gigant saucer that i presum in some far time of the
world histori wa onc an enorm lake a river ran east and west
across thi plain and into it fell tributari far beyond thi river
the contour of the countri rose again till mani mani mile awai
there appear a solitari hill tumulusshap which seem to be
cover with bush
beyond and surround thi hill wa more plain which with the aid of my
power glass wa we could see border at last by a rang of
great mountain look like a blue line pencil across the northern
distanc to the east and west the plain seem to be illimit
obvious it soil wa of a most fertil charact and support number
of inhabit for everywher we could see their kraal or villag
much of it to the west howev wa cover with dens forest with to
all appear a clear in it midst
behold the land of the kendah said hart on thi side of the river
tava live the black kendah on the farther side the white kendah
and what is that hill
that is the holi mount the home of the heavenli child where no man
mai set foother he look at us meaninglysav the priest of the
child
what happen to him if he doe i ask
he di my lord macumazana
then it is guard hart
it is guard not with mortal weapon macumazana but by the spirit
that watch over the child
as he would sai no more on thi interest matter i ask him as to
the number of the kendah peopl to which he repli that the black
kendah might number twenti thousand men of armbear ag but the
white kendah not more than two thousand
then no wonder you want spirit to guard your heavenli child i
remark sinc the black kendah ar your foe and with you warrior
ar few
at thi moment our convers wa interrupt by the arriv of a
picket on a camel who report someth to hart which appear to
disturb him i ask him what wa the matter
that is the matter he said point to a man mount on a rough poni
who just then appear from behind some bush about half a mile awai
gallop down the slope toward the plain he is on of the scout of
simba king of the black kendah and he goe to simba town in yonder
forest to make report of our arriv return to camp macumazana and
eat for we must march with the rise of the moon
as soon as the moon rose we march accordingli although the camel
mani of which were much worn with the long journei scarc had been
given time to fill themselv and none to rest all night we march
down the long slope onli halt for half an hour befor daylight to
eat someth and rearrang the load on the baggag beast which now
i notic were guard with extra care when we were start again
mart came to us and remark with hi usual smile on behalf of hi
brother hart who wa otherwis engag that it might be well if we
had our gun readi sinc we were enter the land of the eleph jana
and who knew but that we might meet him
or hi worshipp on two leg i suggest to which hi onli repli
wa a nod
so we got our repeat rifl some of the first that were ever made
servic but rather complic weapon that fire five cartridg
han howev with my permiss arm himself with the littl purdei
piec that wa name intombi the singebarrel muzzleload gun
which had done me so much servic in earlier dai and even on my last
journei to pongoland he said that he wa accustom to it and did not
understand these newfangl breechload also that it wa lucki i
consent as i did not think that it made much differ with what kind
of rifl han wa provid as a marksman he had thi peculiar up to
a hundr yard or so he wa an excel shot but beyond that distanc
no good at all
a quarter of an hour later as the dawn wa break we pass through
a kind of nek of rough stone border the flat land and emerg
into a compact bodi on to the edg of the grassi plain here the word
wa given to halt for a reason that becam clear to me so soon as i wa
out of the rock for there march rapidli not half a mile awai
were some five hundr whiterob men a larg proport of these
were mount the best be footsoldi of whom more were run
up everi minut appear out of bush that grew upon the hillsid
appar to disput our passag these peopl who were blackfac
with fuzzi hair upon which thei wore no headdress all seem to be
arm with spear
present from out of the mass of them two horsemen dash forward on
of whom bore a white flag in token that thei came to parlei our advanc
guard allow them to pass and thei gallop on dodg in and out
between the camel with wonder skill till at length thei came to
where we were with hart and mart and pull up their hors so
sharpli that the anim almost sat down on their haunch salut by
rais their spear thei were veri finelook fellow perfectli
black in colour with a negroid cast of counten and long frizzl
hair which hung down on to their shoulder their cloth wa light
consist of hide ride breech that resembl bath drawer
sandal and an arrang of tripl chain which seem to be made
of some silveri metal that hung from their neck across the breast and
back their arm consist of a long lanc similar to that carri by
the white kendah and a straight crosshandl sword suspend from
a belt thi as i ascertain afterward wa the regul cavalri
equip among these peopl the footmen carri a shorter spear a
round leather shield two throw javelin or assegai and a curv
knife with a horn handl
greet prophet of the child cri on of them we ar messeng
from the god jana who speak through the mouth of simba the king
sai on worshipp of the devil jana what word ha simba the king for
us answer hart
the word of war prophet what do you beyond your southern boundari of
the tava river in the territori of the black kendah that wa seal
to them by pact after the battl of a hundr year ago is not all
the land to the north as far as the mountain and beyond the mountain
enough for you simba the king let you go out hope that the desert
would swallow you but return you shall not
that we shall know present repli hart in a suav voic it
depend upon whether the heavenli child or the devil jana is the more
power in the land still as we would avoid bloodsh if we mai we
desir to explain to you messeng of king simba that we ar here
upon a peac errand it wa necessari that we should convei the white
lord to make an offer to the child and thi wa the onli road by
which we could lead them to the holi mount sinc thei come from the
south through the forest and the swamp that lie to the east and west
camel cannot travel
and what is the offer that the white men would make to the child
prophet oh we know well for like you we have our magic the offer
that thei must make is the blood of jana our god which you have brought
them here to kill with their strang weapon as though ani weapon could
prevail against jana the god now give to us these white men that we
mai offer them to the god and perchanc simba the king will let you go
through
why ask hart see that you declar that the white men cannot
harm jana to whom inde thei wish no harm to surrend them to you
that thei mai be torn to piec by the devil jana would be to break the
law of hospit for thei ar our guest now return to simba the
king and sai to simba that if he lift a spear against us the threefold
curs of the child shall fall upon him and upon you hi peopl the
curs of heaven by storm or by drought the curs of famin the curs
of war i the prophet have spoken depart
watch i could see that thi ultimatum deliv by hart in a most
impress voic and second as it wa by the sudden and simultan
lift of the spear of all our escort that were within hear
produc a consider effect upon the messeng their face grew
afraid and thei shrank a littl evid the threefold curs of the
child suggest calam which thei dread make no answer thei
wheel their hors about and gallop back to the forc that wa
gather below as swiftli as thei had come
we must fight my lord macumazana said hart and if we would live
conquer as i know that we shall do
then he issu some order of which the result wa that the caravan
adopt a wedgeshap format like to that of a great flock of
wildfowl on the wing hart station himself almost at the apex of the
triangl i with han and mart were about the centr of the line while
ragnal and savag were place opposit to us in the right line the
whole width of the wedg be between us the baggag camel and their
leader occupi the middl space between the line and were follow by
a small rearguard
at first we white men were inclin to protest at thi separ but
when mart explain to us that it object wa to give confid to the
two divis of the forc and also to minim the risk of destruct
or captur of all three of us of cours we had noth more to sai
so we just shook hand and with as much assur as we could command
wish each other well through the job
then we part poor savag look veri limp inde for thi wa hi
first experi of war ragnal howev who came of an old fight
stock seem to be happi as a king i who had known so mani battl
wa the revers of happi for inconveni enough there flash into
my mind at thi junctur the dy word of the zulu captain and seer
mavovo which foretold that i too should fall far awai in war and i
wonder whether thi were the occas that had been present to hi
forese mind
onli han seem quit unconcern inde i note that he took the
opportun of the halt to fill and light hi larg corncob pipe a bit
of bravado in the face of provid for which i could have kick him
had he not been perch in hi usual monkei fashion on the top of a veri
tall camel the act howev excit the admir of the kendah for
i heard on of them call to the other
look he is not a monkei after all but a manmor of a man than hi
master
the arrang were soon made within a quarter of an hour of the
departur of the messeng hart after bow thrice toward the holi
mountain rose in hi stirrup and shake a long spear abov hi head
shout a singl word
charg
chapter xi
allan is captur
the ride that follow wa realli quit exhilar the camel
notwithstand their long journei seem to have caught some of the
enthusiasm of the warhors as describ in the book of job inde i
had no idea that thei could travel at such a rate on we swung down the
slope keep excel order the forest of tall spear shine
and the littl lancerlik pennon flutter on the breez in a veri
gallant wai in silenc we went save for the thud of the hoof of
the camel and an occasion squeal of anger as some rider drove hi
lanc handl into their rib not until we actual join battl did
a singl man open hi lip then it is true there went up on
simultan and mighti roar of
the child death to jana the child the child
but thi happen a few minut later
as we drew near the enemi i saw that thei had mass their footmen in
a dens bodi six or eight line thick there thei stood to receiv the
impact of our charg or rather thei did not all stand for the first
two rank were kneel with long spear stretch out in front of them
i imagin that their appear must have greatli resembl that of the
greek phalanx or that of the swiss prepar to receiv cavalri in the
middl ag on either side of thi formid bodi which by now must
have number four or five hundr men and at a distanc perhap of
a quarter of a mile from them were gather the horsemen of the black
kendah divid into two bodi of nearli equal strength sai about a
hundr hors in each bodi
as we approach our triangl curv a littl no doubt under the
direct of hart a minut or so later i saw the reason it wa that
we might strike the footsoldi not full in front but at an angl it
wa an admir manoeuvr for when present we did strike we caught
them swiftli on the flank and crumpl them up my word we went through
those fellow like a knife through butter thei had as much chanc
against the rush of our camel as a brownpap screen ha against a
typhoon over thei roll in heap while the white kendah spit them
with their lanc
the child is top dog my monei on the child reflect i in irrever
ecstasi but that exult wa prematur for those black kendah were
by no mean all dead present i saw that score of them had appear
among the camel which thei were engag in stab or try
to stab in the stomach with their spear also i had forgotten the
horsemen as our charg slacken ow to the complic in front
these arriv on our flank like two thunderbolt we face about and
did our best to meet the onslaught of which the net result wa that
both our left and right line were pierc through about fifti yard
behind the baggag camel luckili for us the veri impetuos of the
black kendah rush depriv it of most of the fruit of victori sinc
the two squadron be unabl to check their hors end by charg
into each other and becom mix in inextric confus then i
do not know who gave the order we wheel our camel in and fell upon
them a struggl stationari mass with the result that mani of them
were spear or overthrown and trampl
i have said we but that is not quit correct at ani rate so far
as mart han i and about fifteen camelmen were concern how it
happen i could not tell in that dust and confus but we were
cut off from the main bodi and present found ourselv fight
desper in a group at which black kendah horsemen were charg
again and again we made the best stand we could by degre the
bewild camel sank under the repeat spearthrust of the enemi
all except on oddli enough that ridden by han which by some strang
chanc wa never touch the rest of us were thrown or tumbl off the
camel and continu the fight from behind their struggl bodi
that is where i came in up to thi time i had not fire a singl shot
partli becaus i do not like miss which it is so easi to do from the
back of a swai camel and still more for the reason that i had
not the slightest desir to kill ani of these savag men unless i wa
oblig to do so in selfdef now howev the thing wa differ
as i wa fight for my life lean against my camel which wa dy
and beat it head upon the ground groan horribl the while i
empti the five cartridg of the repeat into those black kendah
paus between each shot to take aim with the result that present
five riderless hors were gallop loos about the veld
the effect wa electr sinc our attack had never seen anyth
of the kind befor for a while thei all drew off which gave me time to
reload then thei came on again and i repeat the process for a second
time thei retreat and after consult which last for a minut or
more made a third attack onc more i salut them to the best of my
abil though on thi occas onli three men and a hors fell the
fifth shot wa a clean miss becaus thei came on in such a scatter
format that i had to turn from side to side to fire
now at last the game wa up for the simpl reason that i had no more
cartridg save two in my doublebarrel pistol it mai be ask why
the answer is want of foresight too mani cartridg in on pocket
ar apt to chafe on camelback and so is a belt full of them in those
dai also the engag were few in which a man fire over fifteen
i had forti or fifti more in a bag which bag savag with hi usual
polit had taken and hung upon hi saddl without sai a word to
me at the begin of the action i found thi out but could not then
get them from him as he wa separ from me han alwai careless in
small matter wa realli to blame as he ought to have seen that i had
the cartridg or at ani rate to have carri them himself in short
it wa on of those accid that will happen there is noth more to
be said
after a still longer consult our enemi advanc on us for the
fourth time but veri slowli meanwhil i had been take stock of the
posit the camel corp or what wa left of it oblivi of our
plight which the dust of conflict had hidden from them wa travel
on to the north more or less victori that is to sai it had cut it
wai through the black kendah and wa escap unpursu huddl up in
a mob with the baggag anim safe in it centr the black kendah
themselv were engag in kill our wound and succour their
own also in collect the bodi of the dead in short quit
unintention we were desert probabl if anybodi thought about us
at all in the turmoil of desper battl thei conclud that we were
among the slain
mart came up to me unhurt still smile and wave a bloodi spear
lord macumazana he said the end is at hand the child ha save the
other or most of them but us it ha abandon now what will you do
kill yourself or if that doe not pleas you suffer me to kill you or
shoot on until you must surrend
i have noth to shoot with ani more i answer but if we
surrend what will happen to us
we shall be taken to simba town and there sacrif to the devil
janai have not time to tell you how therefor i propos to kill
myself
then i think you ar foolish mart sinc onc we ar dead we ar
dead but while we ar aliv it is alwai possibl that we mai escap
from jana if the worst come to the worst i have a pistol with two
bullet in it on for you and on for me
the wisdom of the child is in you he repli i shall surrend with
you macumazana and take my chanc
then he turn and explain thing to hi follow who spoke togeth
for a moment in the end these took a strang and to my mind a veri
heroic decis wait till the attack kendah were quit close
to us with the except of three men who either becaus thei lack
courag or for some other reason stai with us thei advanc humbl
as though to make submiss a number of the black kendah dismount
and ran up i suppos to take them prison the men wait till
these were all round them then with a yell of the child thei sprang
forward take the enemi unawar and fight like demon inflict
great loss upon them befor thei fell themselv cover with wound
brave men inde said mart approvingli well now thei ar all at
peac with the child where doubtless we shall find them er long
i nod but answer noth to tell the truth i wa too much engag
in nurs the remain of my own courag to enter into convers
about that of other peopl
thi fierc and cun stratagem of desper men which had cost their
enemi so dear seem to infuri the black kendah
at us came the whole mob of themw were but six nowroar jana
jana and led by a greybeard who to judg from the number of silver
chain upon hi breast and hi other trap seem to be a great man
among them when thei were about fifti yard awai and i wa prepar
for the worst a shot rang out from abov and behind me at the same
instant greybeard threw hi arm wide and let fall the spear he
held pitch from hi hors evid stone dead i glanc back and
saw han the corncob pipe still in hi mouth and the littl rifl
intombi still at hi shoulder he had fire from the back of the
camel i think for the first time that dai and whether by chanc or
through good marksmanship i do not know had kill thi man
hi sudden and unexpect end seem to fill the black kendah with grief
and dismai halt in their charg thei gather round him while a
fiercelook middleag man also adorn with much barbar fineri
dismount to examin him
that is simba the king said mart and the slain on is hi uncl
goru the great gener who brought him up from a babe
then i wish i had anoth cartridg left for the nephew i began and
stop for han wa speak to me
goodby baa he said i must go for i cannot load intombi on
the back of thi beast if you meet your reverend father the predik
befor i do tell him to make a nice place readi for me among the
fire
then befor i could get out an answer han drag hi camel round
as i have said it wa quit uninjur urg it to a shambl gallop
with blow of the rifl stock he depart at a great rate not toward
the home of the child but up the hill into a brake of giant grass
mingl with thorn tree that grew quit close at hand here with
startl sudden both he and the camel vanish awai
if the black kendah saw him go of which i am doubt for thei all
seem to be lost in consult round their king and the dead gener
goru thei made no attempt to follow him anoth possibl is that
thei thought he wa try to lead them into some snare or ambush
i do not know what thei thought becaus i never heard them mention han
or the matter of hi disappear if inde thei ever realiz that
there wa such a person curious enough in the case of men who had
just shown themselv so brave thi last accid of the deceas of
goru come on the top of all their other casualti seem to take the
courag out of them it wa as though thei had come to the conclus
that we with our gun were someth more than mortal
for sever minut thei debat in evid hesit at last from out
of their arrai rode a singl man in whom i recogn on of the envoi
who had met us in the morn carri in hi hand a white flag as he
had done befor thereon i laid down my rifl in token that i would not
fire at him which inde i could not do have noth to fire see
thi he came to within a few yard and halt address mart
o second prophet of the child he said these ar the word of simba
the king your god ha been too strong for us todai though in a dai
to come it mai be otherwis i thought i had you in a pit that you were
the buck and i the hunter but though with loss you have escap out
of the pit and the speaker glanc toward our retreat forc which
wa now but a cloud of dust in the far distanc while i the hunter
have been gore by your horn and again he glanc at the dead that
were scatter about the plain the noblest of the buck the white bull
of the herd and he look at me who in ani other circumst
would have felt compliment and you o prophet mart and on or two
other besid those that i have slain ar howev still in the pit
and your horn is a magic horn here he point to my rifl which
pierc from afar and kill dead all by whom it is touch
so i caught those gentri well in the middl thought i to myself and
with softnos bullet
therefor i simba the king make you an offer yield yourselv and
i swear that no spear shall be driven through your heart and no knife
come near your throat you shall onli be taken to my town and there
be fed on the best and kept as prison till onc more there is peac
between the black kendah and the white if you refus then i will
ring you round and perhap in the dark rush on you and kill you all or
perhap i will watch you from dai to dai till you who have no water
die of thirst in the heat of the sun these ar my word to which
noth mai be ad and from which noth shall be taken awai
have finish thi speech he rode back a few yard out of earshot and
wait
what will you answer lord macumazana ask mart
i repli by anoth question is there ani chanc of our be rescu
by your peopl
he shook hi head none what we have seen todai is but a small part
of the armi of the black kendah on regiment of foot and on of hors
that ar alwai readi by tomorrow thousand will be gather mani
more than we can hope to deal with in the open and still less in their
stronghold also hart will believ that we ar dead unless the child
save us we shall be left to our fate
then it seem that we ar inde in a pit as that black brute of
a king put it mart and if he doe what he sai and rush us at
sundown everyon of us will be kill also i am thirsti alreadi and
there is noth to drink but will thi king keep hi word there ar
other wai of dy besid by steel
i think that he will keep hi word but as that messeng said he will
not add to hi word choos now for see thei ar begin to hedg us
round
what do you sai men i ask of the three who had remain with us
we sai lord that we ar in the hand of the child though we wish
now that we had di with our brother answer their spokesman
fatalist
so after mart and i had consult togeth for a littl as to the form
of hi repli he beckon to the messeng and said
we accept the offer of simba although it would be easi for thi lord
to kill him now where he stand name to yield ourselv as prison
on hi oath that no harm shall come to us for know that if harm doe
come the vengeanc will be terribl now in proof of hi good faith
let simba draw near and drink the cup of peac with us for we thirst
not so said the messeng for then that white lord might kill him
with hi tube give me the tube and simba shall come
take it i said magnanim hand him the rifl which he
receiv in a veri gingerli fashion after all i reflect there is
noth much more useless than a rifl without ammunit
off he went hold the weapon at arm length and present simba
himself accompani by some of hi men on of whom carri a skin of
water and anoth a larg cup hollow from an eleph tusk rode up
to us thi simba wa a fine and rather terrifi person with a larg
moustach and a chin shave except for a littl tuft of hair which
he wore at it point like an italian hi ey were big and dark
franklook yet now and again with sinist express in the corner
of them he wa not nearli so black as most of hi follow probabl
in bygon gener hi blood had been cross with that of the white
kendah he wore hi hair long without ani headdress held in place by a
band of gold which i suppos repres a crown on hi forehead wa
a larg white scar probabl receiv in some battl such wa hi
appear
he look at me with great curios and i have often wonder sinc
what kind of an impress i produc upon him my hat had fallen off
or i had knock it off when i fire my last cartridg into hi peopl
and forgotten to replac it and my intract hair which wa longer
than usual had not been recent brush my worn norfolk jacket wa
dy with blood from a wound or dy man who had tumbl against me
in the scrimmag when the cavalri charg us and my right leg and boot
were stain in a similar fashion from have rub against my camel
where a spear had enter it altogeth i must have appear a most
disreput object
some indic of hi opinion wa given howev in a remark which of
cours i pretend not to understand that i overheard him make to on
of hi offic
truli he said we must not alwai look to the strong for strength
and yet thi littl white porcupin is strength itself for see how much
damag he ha wrought us also consid hi ey that appear to pierc
everyth jana himself might fear those ey well time that grind
the rock will tell us all
all of thi i caught perfectli my ear be veri sharp although he
thought that he spoke out of my hear for after spend a month in
their compani i understood the kendah dialect of bantu veri well
have deliv himself thu he rode nearer and said
you prophet mart my enemi have heard the term of me simba the
king and have accept them therefor discuss them no more what i
have promis i will keep what i have given i give neither greater nor
less by the weight of a hair
so be it o king answer mart with hi usual smile which noth
ever seem to disturb onli rememb that if those term ar broken
either in the letter or in the spirit especi the spirit that is
the best render i can give of hi word the manifold curs of
the child will fall upon you and your ye though you kill us all by
treacheri still those curs will fall
mai jana take the child and all who worship it exclaim the king
with evid irrit
in the end o king jana will take the child and it followersor
the child will take jana and hi follow which of these thing must
happen is known to the child alon and perchanc to it prophet
meanwhil for everi on of those of the child i think that three of the
follow of jana or more lie dead upon thi field also the caravan
is now out of your reach with two of the white lord and mani of such
tube which deal death like that which we have surrend to you
therefor becaus we ar helpless do not think that the child is
helpless jana must have been asleep o king or you would have set your
trap better
i thought that thi coolli insol speech would have produc some
outburst but in fact it seem to have an opposit effect make no
repli to it simba said almost humbl
i come to drink the cup of peac with you and the white lord o
prophet afterward we can talk give me water slave
then a man fill the great ivori cup with water from the skin he
carri simba took it and have sprinkl a littl upon the ground
i suppos as an offer drank from the cup doubtless to show that it
wa not poison watch carefulli i made sure that he swallow what
he drank by studi the motion of hi throat then he hand the cup
with a bow to mart who with a still deeper bow pass it to me be
absolut parch i absorb about a pint of it and feel a new man
pass the horn to mart who swallow the rest then it wa fill
again for our three white kendah the king first tast the water as
befor after which mart and i had a second pull
when at length our thirst wa satisfi hors were brought to us
servic and docil littl beast with sheepskin for saddl and
loop of hide for stirrup on these we mount and for the next three
hour rode across the plain surround by a strong escort and with an
arm black kendah run on each side of our hors and hold in hi
hand a thong attach to the ring of the bridl no doubt to prevent ani
attempt to escap
our road ran past but not through some villag whenc we saw mani women
and children stare at us and through beauti crop of meali and
other sort of grain that in thi countri were now just ripen the
luxuri appear of these crop suggest that the rain must have
been plenti and the season all that could be desir from some of
the villag by the track aros a miser sound of wail evid
their inhabit had alreadi heard that certain of their menkind had
fallen in that morn fight
at the end of the third hour we began to enter the great forest which
i had seen when first we look down on kendahland it wa fill with
splendid tree most of them quit strang to me but perhap becaus of
the dens of their overshadow crown there wa compar
no undergrowth the gener effect of the place wa veri gloomi sinc
littl light could pass through the interlac foliag of the top of
those mighti tree
toward even we came to a clear in thi forest it mai have been
four or five mile in diamet but whether it wa natur or artifici
i am not sure i think howev that it wa probabl the former for
two reason the hollow natur of the ground which lai a good mani feet
lower than the surround forest and the wonder fertil of the
soil which suggest that it had onc been deposit upon an old
lake bottom never did i see such crop as those that grew upon that
clear thei were magnific
wend our wai along the road that ran through the tall corn for here
everi inch wa cultiv we came suddenli upon the capit of the
black kendah which wa known as simba town it wa a larg place
somewhat differ from ani other african settlement with which i
am acquaint inasmuch as it wa not onli stockad but complet
surround by a broad artifici moat fill with water from a stream
that ran through the centr of the town over which moat there were
four timber bridg place at the cardin point of the compass these
bridg were strong enough to bear hors or stock but so made that in
the event of attack thei could be destroi in a few minut
ride through the eastern gate a stout timber structur on the farther
side of the correspond bridg where the king wa receiv with
salut by an arm guard we enter on of the main street of the
town which ran from north to south and from east to west it wa broad
and on either side of it were the dwell of the inhabit set close
togeth becaus the space within the stockad wa limit these were
not hut but squar build of mud with flat roof of some kind of
cement evid thei were built upon the model of orient and north
african hous of which some debas tradit remain with these
peopl thu a stairwai or ladder ran from the interior to the roof of
each hous whereon it inhabit were accustom as i discov
afterward to sleep dure a good part of the year also to eat in the
cool of the dai mani of them were gather there now to watch us pass
men women and children all except the littl on decent cloth in
long garment of variou colour the women for the most part in white
and the men in a kind of bluish linen
i saw at onc that thei had alreadi heard of the fight and of the
consider loss which their peopl had sustain for their
recept of us prison wa most unfriendli inde the men shook
their fist at us the women scream out curs while the children
stuck out their tongu in token of deris or defianc most of these
demonstr howev were direct at mart and hi follow who
onli smile indiffer at me thei stare in wonder not unmix with
fear
a quarter of a mile or so from the gate we came to an inner enclosur
that answer to the south african cattl kraal surround by a dry
ditch and a timber palisad outsid of which wa plant a green fenc
of some shrub with long white thorn here we pass through more
gate to find ourselv in an oval space perhap five acr in extent
evid thi serv as a market ground but all around it were open
shed where hundr of hors were stabl no cattl seem to be kept
there except a few that with sheep and goat were driven in everi dai
for slaughter purpos at a shambl at the north end from the great
stock kraal built beyond the forest to the south where thei were safe
from possibl raid by the white kendah
a tall reed fenc cut off the southern end of thi marketplac outsid
of which we were order to dismount pass through yet anoth gate
we found within the fenc a larg hut or hous built on the same model
as the other in the town which mart whisper to me wa that of the
king behind it were smaller hous in which live hi queen and women
goodlook femal who advanc to meet him with obsequi bow to
the right and left were two more build of about equal size on of
which wa occupi by the royal guard and the other wa the guesthous
whither we were conduct
it prove to be a comfort dwell about thirti feet squar but
contain onli on room with variou hut behind it that serv for
cook and other purpos in on of these the three camelmen were
place immedi on our arriv food wa brought to us a lamb or kid
roast whole upon a wooden platter and some green mealiecob boil
upon anoth platter also water to drink and wash with in earthenwar
jar of sundri clai
i at heartili for i wa starv then as it wa useless to attempt
precaut against murder without ani talk to my fellow prison for
which we were both too tire i threw myself down on a mattress stuf
with corn husk in a corner of the hut drew a skin rug over me and
have commend myself to the protect of the power abov fell fast
asleep
chapter xii
the first curs
the next thing i rememb wa feel upon my face the sunlight that
pour through a windowplac which wa protect by immov wooden
bar for a while i lai still reflect as memori return to me upon
all the event of the previou dai and upon my present unhappi posit
here i wa a prison in the hand of a hord of fierc savag who had
everi reason to hate me for though thi wa done in selfdef had
i not kill a number of their peopl against whom person i had no
quarrel it wa true that their king had promis me safeti but what
relianc could be put upon the word of such a man unless someth
occur to save me without doubt my dai were number in thi wai
or in that i should be murder which serv me right for ever enter
upon such a busi
the onli satisfactori point in the stori wa that for the present at
ani rate ragnal and savag had escap though doubtless sooner or
later fate would overtak them also i wa sure that thei had escap
sinc two of the camelmen with us had inform mart that thei saw them
swept awai surround by our peopl and quit unharm now thei would
be griev over my death sinc none surviv who could tell them
of our captur unless the black kendah chose to do so which wa not
like i wonder what cours thei would take when ragnal found that
hi quest wa vain as of cours must happen try to get out of the
countri i suppos as i prai thei might succe in do though thi
wa most improb
then there wa han he of cours would attempt to retrac our road
across the desert if he had got clear awai have a good camel
a rifl and some ammunit it wa just possibl that he might win
through as he never forgot a path which he had onc travel though
probabl in a week time a few bone upon the desert would be all that
remain of him well as he had suggest perhap we should soon be
talk the event over in some far sphere with my fatherand other
poor old han
i open my ey and look about me the first thing i notic wa that
my doublebarrel pistol which i had place at full cock besid
me befor i went to sleep wa gone also my larg claspknif thi
discoveri did not tend to rais my spirit sinc i wa now quit
weaponless then i observ mart seat on the floor of the hut stare
straight in front of him and note that at length even he had ceas to
smile but that hi lip were move as though he were engag in prayer
or medit
mart i said someon ha been in thi place while we were asleep
and stolen my pistol and knife
ye lord he answer and my knife also i saw them come in the
middl of the night two men who walk softli as cat and search
everyth
then why did you not wake me
what would have been the us lord if we had caught hold of the men
thei would have call out and we should have been murder at onc it
wa best to let them take the thing which after all ar of no good to
us here
the pistol might have been of some good i repli significantli
ye he said nod but at the worst death is easi to find
do you think mart that we could manag to let hart and the other
know our plight that smoke which i breath in england for instanc
seem to show me faroff thingsif we could get ani of it
the smoke wa noth lord but some harmless burn powder which
cloud your mind for a minut and enabl you to see the thought that
were in our mind we drew the pictur at which you look also
here there is none
oh i said the old trick of suggest just what i imagin then
there an end of that and as the other will think that we ar
dead and we cannot commun with them we have no hope except in
ourselv
or the child suggest mart gentli
look here i said with irrit after you have just told me that
your smoke vision wa a mere conjur trick how do you expect me
to believ in your bless child who is the child what is the child
andthi is more importantwhat can it do as your throat is go to
be cut shortli you mai as well tell me the truth
lord macumazana i will who and what the child is i cannot sai becaus
i do not know but it ha been our god for thousand of year and we
believ that our remot forefath brought it with them when thei were
driven out of egypt at some time unknown we have write concern it
done up in littl roll but as we cannot read them thei ar of no us
to us it ha an hereditari priesthood of which hart my uncl for he
is my uncl is the head we believ that the child is god or rather
a symbol in which god dwell and that it can save us in thi world and
the next for we hold that man is an immort spirit we believ also
that through it oraclea priestess who is call guardian of the
childit can declar the futur and bring bless or curs upon men
especi upon our enemi when the oracl di we ar helpless
sinc the child ha no mouth and our enemi prevail against us thi
happen a long while ago and the last oracl have declar befor
her death that her successor wa to be found in england my uncl and i
travel thither disguis as conjur and made search for mani year
we thought that we had found the new oracl in the ladi who marri the
lord igeza becaus of that mark of the new moon upon her neck after
our return to africa howev for as i have spoken of thi matter i mai
as well tell you all here he stare me full in the ey and spoke in
a clear metal voic which somehow no longer convinc me we found
that we had made a mistak for the real oracl a mere girl wa
discov among our own peopl and ha now been for two year
instal in her offic without doubt the last guardian of the child
wa wander in her mind when she told us that stori befor her death
as to a woman in england a countri of which she had heard through
arab that is all
thank you i repli feel that it would be useless to show ani
suspicion of hi stori now will you be so good as to tell me who and
what is the god or the eleph jana whom you have brought me here to
kill is the eleph a god or is the god an eleph in either case
what ha it to do with the child
lord jana among us kendah repres the evil in the world as the
child repres the good jana is he whom the mohammedan call shaitan
and the christian call satan and our forefath the old egyptian
call set
ah thought i to myself now we have got it horu the divin child
and set the evil monster with whom it strive everlastingli
alwai went on mart there ha been war between the child and jana
that is between good and evil and we know that in the end on of them
must conquer the other
the whole world ha known that from the begin i interrupt but
who and what is thi jana
among the black kendah lord jana is an eleph or at ani rate hi
symbol is an eleph a veri terribl beast to which sacrific ar
made that kill all who do not worship him if he chanc to meet them
he live farther on in the forest yonder and the black kendah make us
of him in war for the devil in him obei their priest
inde and is thi eleph alwai the same
i cannot tell you but for mani gener it ha been the same for
it is known by it size and by the fact that on of it tusk is twist
downward
well i remark all thi prove noth sinc eleph certainli
live for at least two hundr year and perhap much longer also
after thei becom rogu thei acquir everi kind of wick and
unnatur habit as to which i could tell you lot of stori have you
seen thi eleph
no macumazana he answer with a shiver if i had seen it should
i have been aliv todai yet i fear i am fate to see it er long
not alon and again he shiver look at me in a veri suggest
manner
at thi moment our convers wa interrupt by the arriv of two
black kendah who brought us our breakfast of porridg and a boil
fowl and stood there while we at it for my part i wa not sorri as
i had learn all i want to know of the theolog opinion and
practic of the land and had come to the conclus that the terribl
devilgod of the black kendah wa mere a rogu eleph of unusu
size and feroc which under other circumst it would have given
me the greatest pleasur to try to shoot
when we had finish eat that is soon for neither of our appetit
wa good that morn we walk out of the hous into the surround
compound and visit the camelmen in their hut here we found them
squat on the ground look veri depress inde when i ask them
what wa the matter thei repli noth except that thei were men
about to die and life wa pleasant also thei had wive and children
whom thei would never see again
have tri to cheer them up to the best of my abil which i fear i
did without convict for in my heart i agre with their view of the
case we return to the guesthous and mount the stair which led to
the flat roof henc we saw that some curiou ceremoni wa in progress
in the centr of the marketplac at that distanc we could not make
out the detail for i forgot to sai that my glass had been stolen
with the pistol and knife probabl becaus thei were suppos to be
lethal weapon or instrument of magic
a rough altar had been erect on which a fire burn behind it the
king simba wa seat on a stool with variou councillor about him
in front of the altar wa a stout wooden tabl on which lai what
look like the bodi of a goat or a sheep a fantast dress man
assist by other men appear to be engag in inspect the insid
of thi anim with we gather unsatisfactori result for present
he rais hi arm and utter a loud wail then the creatur viscera
were remov from it and thrown upon the fire while the rest of the
carcass wa carri off
i ask mart what he thought thei were do he repli dejectedli
consult their oracl perhap as to whether we should live or die
macumazana
just then the priest in the strang feather attir approach the
king carri some small object in hi hand i wonder what it could
be till the sound of a report reach my ear and i saw the man begin
to jump round upon on leg hold the other with both hi hand at the
knee and howl loudli
ah i said that pistol wa full cock and the bullet got him in
the foot
simba shout out someth whereon a man pick up the pistol and
threw it into the fire round which the other gather to watch it
burn
you wait i said to mart and as i spoke the word the inevit
happen
off went the other barrel of the pistol which hop out of the fire
with the recoil like a live thing but as it happen on of the
assist priest wa stand in front of the mouth of that barrel and
he also hop onc but never again for the heavi bullet struck him
somewher in the bodi and kill him now there wa constern
everyon ran awai leav the dead man ly on the ground simba led
the rout and the headpriest brought up the rear skip along upon
on leg
have observ these event which fill me with an unholi joi we
descend into the hous again as there wa noth more to see also
becaus it occur to me that our presenc on the roof watch their
discomfitur might irrit these savag about ten minut later the
gate of the fenc round the guesthous wa thrown open and through it
came four men carri on a stretcher the bodi of the priest whom the
bullet had kill which thei laid down in front of our door then
follow the king with an arm guard and after him the befeath
divin with hi foot bound up who support himself upon the shoulder
of two of hi colleagu thi man i now perceiv wore a hideou
mask from which project two tusk in imit of those of an
eleph also there were other as mani as the space would hold
the king call to us to come out of the hous which have no choic
we did on glanc at him show me that the man wa frantic with fear
or rage or both
look upon your work magician he said in a terribl voic point
first to the dead priest then to the divin wound foot
it is no work of our king simba answer mart it is your own
work you stole the magic weapon of the white lord and made it angri so
that it ha reveng itself upon you
it is true said simba that the tube ha kill on of those who
took it awai from you and wound the other here wa luck inde
but it wa you who order it to do so magician now hark yesterdai
i promis you safeti that no spear should pierc your heart and no
knife come near your throat and drank the cup of peac with you but
you have broken the pact work us more harm and therefor it no
longer hold sinc there ar mani other wai in which men can die
listen again thi is my decre by your magic you have taken awai the
life of on of my servant and hurt anoth of my servant destroi
the middl toe of hi left foot if within three dai you do not give
back the life to him who seem to be dead and give back the toe to him
who seem to be hurt as you well can do then you shall join those whom
you have slain in the land of death how i will not tell you
now when i heard thi amaz sentenc i gasp within myself but
think it better to keep up my rle of understand noth of their
talk i preserv an immov counten and left mart to answer
thi to hi credit be it record he did with hi customari pleasant
smile
o king he said who can bring the dead back to life not even the
child itself at ani rate in thi world for there is no wai
then prophet of the child you had better find a wai or i repeat i
send you to join them he shout roll hi ey
what did my brother the great prophet promis to you but yesterdai
o king if you harm us ask mart wa it not that the three great
curs should fall upon your peopl learn now that if so much as on
of us is murder by you these thing shall swiftli come to pass i
mart who am also a prophet of the child have said it
now simba seem to go quit mad so mad that i thought all wa over he
wave hi spear and danc about in front of us till the silver chain
clank upon hi breast he vituper the child and it worshipp
who he declar had work evil on the black kendah for gener
he appeal to hi god jana to aveng these evil to pierc the child
with hi tusk to tear it with hi trunk and to trampl it with hi
feet all of which the wound divin abli second through hi horrid
mask
there we stood befor him i lean against the wall of the hous with
an air of studi nonchal mingl with mild interest at least that
is what i meant to do and mart smile sweetli and stare at the
heaven whilst i wa wonder what exact portion of my frame wa
destin to becom acquaint with that spear of a sudden simba gave it
up turn to hi follow he bade them dig a hole in the corner of
our littl enclosur and set the dead man in it with hi head out so
that he mai breath an order which thei promptli execut
then he issu a command that we should be well fed and tend and
remark that if the depart wa not aliv and healthi on the third
morn from that dai we should hear from him again he and hi compani
stalk off except those men who were occupi with the inter
soon thi wa finish also there sat the deceas buri to the neck
with hi face look toward the hous a most disagre sight
present howev matter were improv in thi respect by on of the
sexton fetch a larg earthenwar pot and sever smaller pot full
of food and water the latter thei set round the head i suppos for the
susten of the bodi beneath and then place the big vessel invert
over all to keep the sun off our sleep brother as i heard on sai
to the other
thi pot look innoc enough when all wa done like on of those
that garden in england put over forc rhubarb no more and yet
such is the strength of the imagin i think that on the whole i
should have prefer the object underneath nake and unadorn for
instanc i have forgotten to sai that the head of those of the white
kendah who had fallen in the fight had been set up on pole in front of
simba hous thei were unpleas to contempl but to my mind not
so unpleas as that pot
as a matter of fact thi precaut against injuri from the sun to the
late divin prove unnecessari sinc by some strang chanc from
that moment the sun ceas to shine quit suddenli cloud aros which
gradual cover the whole sky and the weather began to turn veri cold
unprecedentedli so mart inform me for the time of year which it
will be rememb in thi countri wa the season just befor harvest
obvious the black kendah thought so also sinc from our seat on the
roof whither we had retreat to be as far as possibl from the pot we
saw them gather in the marketplac stare at the sky and talk to
each other
the dai pass without ani further event except the arriv of our
meal for which we had no great appetit the night came earlier than
usual becaus of the cloud and we fell asleep or rather into a seri
of doze onc i thought that i heard someon stir in the hut
behind us but as it wa follow by silenc i took no more notic at
length the light broke veri slowli for now the cloud were denser
than ever shiver with the cold mart and i made a visit to the
cameldriv who were not allow to enter our hous on go into
their hut we saw to our horror that onli two of them remain seat
stonili upon the floor we ask where the third wa thei repli thei
did not know in the middl of the night thei said men had crept in
who seiz bound and gag him then drag him awai as there wa
noth to be said or done we return to breakfast fill with horrid
fear
noth happen that dai except that some priest arriv lift
the earthenwar pot examin their depart colleagu who by now had
becom an unencourag spectacl remov old dish of food arrang
more about him and went off also the cloud grew thicker and thicker
and the air more and more chilli till had we been in ani northern
latitud i should have said that snow wa pend from our perch on
the rooftop i observ the popul of simba town discuss the
weather with everincreas eager also that the peopl who were
go out to work in the field wore mat over their shoulder
onc more dark came and thi night notwithstand the cold we
spent wrap in rug on the roof of the hous it had occur to us
that kidnap would be less easi there as we could make some sort of
a fight at the head of the stairwai or if the worst came to the worst
dive from the parapet and break our neck we kept watch turn and turn
about dure my watch about midnight i heard a nois go on in the
hut behind us scuffl and a stifl cry which turn my blood cold
about an hour later a fire wa light in the centr of the marketplac
where the sheep had been sacrif and by the flare of it i could see
peopl move but what thei did i could not see which wa perhap as
well
next morn onli on of the camelmen wa left thi remain man wa
now almost crazi with fear and could give no clear account of what had
happen to hi companion
the poor fellow implor us to take him awai to our hous as he fear
to be left alon with the black devil we tri to do so but arm
guard appear mysteri and thrust him back into hi own hut
thi dai wa an exact repetit of the other the same inspect of
the deceas and renew of hi food the same cold cloud sky the
same agit confer in the marketplac
for the third time dark fell upon us in that horribl place onc
more we took refug on the roof but thi night neither of us slept
we were too cold too physic miser and too fill with mental
apprehens all natur seem to be big with impend disast the
sky appear to be sink down upon the earth the moon wa hidden yet
a faint and lurid light shone now in on quarter of the horizon now in
anoth there wa no wind but the air moan audibl it wa as though
the end of the world were near as i reflect probabl might be
the case so far as we were concern never perhap have i felt so
spiritu terrifi as i wa dure the dread inact of that
night even if i had known that i wa go to be execut at dawn i
think that by comparison i should have been lightheart but the worst
part of the busi wa that i knew noth i wa like a man forc to
walk through dens dark among precipic quit unabl to guess when
my journei would end in space but endur all the agoni of death at
everi step
about midnight again we heard that scuffl and stifl cry in the hut
behind us
he gone i whisper to mart wipe the cold sweat from my brow
ye answer mart and veri soon we shall follow him macumazana
i wish that hi face were visibl so that i could see if he still
smile when he utter those word
an hour or so later the usual fire appear in the marketplac round
which the usual figur flit dimli the sight of them fascin
me although i did not want to look fear what i might see luckili
howev we were too far off to discern anyth at night
while these unholi ceremoni were in progress the climax came that is
so far as the weather wa concern of a sudden a great gale sprang
up a gale of ici wind such as in southern africa sometim preced
a thunderstorm it blew for half an hour or more then lull now
lightn flash across the heaven and by the glare of it we
perceiv that all the popul of simba town seem to be gather in
the marketplac at least there were some thousand of them talk
gesticul point at the sky
a few minut later there came a great crash of thunder of which it
wa imposs to locat the sound for it roll from everywher then
suddenli someth hard struck the roof by my side and rebound to be
follow next moment by a blow upon my shoulder which nearli knock me
flat although i wa well protect by the skin rug
down the stair i call thei ar stone us and suit the action
to the word
ten second later we were both in the room crouch in it farther
corner for the stone or whatev thei were seem to be follow us
i struck a match of which fortun i had some togeth with my pipe
and a good pocket of tobaccomi onli solac in those daysand as
it burn up saw first that blood wa run down mart face
and secondli that these stone were great lump of ic some of them
weigh sever ounc which hop about the floor like live thing
hailstorm remark mart with hi accustom smile
hell storm i repli for whoever saw hail like that befor
then the match burnt out and convers came to an end for the reason
that we could no longer hear each other speak the hail came down with
a perpetu rattl roar that in it sum wa on of the most terribl
sound to which i ever listen and yet abov it i thought that i could
catch anoth still more terribl the wail of hundr of peopl in
agoni after the first few minut i began to be afraid that the roof
would be batter in or that the wall would crumbl beneath thi
perpetu fire of the musketri of heaven but the cement wa good and
the place well built
so it came about that the hous stood the tempest which had it been
roof with tile or galvan iron i am sure it would never have done
sinc the lump of ic must have shatter on and pierc the other
like paper inde i have seen thi happen in a bad hailstorm in
natal which kill my best hors but even that hail wa as snowflak
compar to thi
i suppos that thi natur phenomenon continu for about twenti
minut not more dure ten of which it wa at it worst then by
degre it ceas the sky clear and the moon shone out beautifulli
we climb to the roof again and look it wa sever inch deep in
jag ic while the marketplac and all the countri round appear in
the bright moonlight to be buri beneath a veil of snow
veri rapidli as the normal temperatur of that warm land reassert
itself thi snow or rather hail melt caus a flood of water which
where there wa ani fall began to rush awai with a gurgl sound also
we heard other sound such as that from the gallop hoof of mani
of the hors which had broken loos from their wreck stabl at
the north end of the marketplac where in great number thei had been
kill by the fall roof or had kick each other to death and a
wild univers wail that rose from everi quarter of the big town in
which quantiti of the worstbuilt hous had collaps further ly
here and there about the marketplac we could see score of dark shape
that we knew to be those of men women and children whom those sharp
missil hurl from heaven had caught befor thei could escap and
slain or wound almost to death for it will be rememb that perhap
not fewer than two thousand peopl were gather on thi marketplac
attend the horrid midnight sacrific and discuss the unnatur
weather when the storm burst upon them suddenli as an avalanch
the child is small yet it strength is great behold the first curs
said mart solemnli
i stare at him but as he chose to believ that a veri unusu
hailstorm wa a visit from heaven i did not think it worth while
argu the point onli i wonder if he realli did believ thi then
i rememb that such an event wa said to have afflict the old
egyptian in the hour of their pride becaus thei would not let the
peopl go well these blackguardedli black kendah were certainli wors
than the egyptian can ever have been also thei would not let us
go it wa not wonder therefor that mart should be the victim of
phantasi on the matter
not until the follow morn did we come to understand the full
extent of the calam which had overtaken the black kendah i think i
have said that their crop thi year were magnific and just ripen
to harvest from our roof on previou dai we could see a great area
of them stretch to the edg of the forest when the sun rose that
morn thi area had vanish and the ground wa cover with a
carpet of green pulp also the forest itself appear suddenli to have
experienc the full effect of a northern winter not a leaf wa left
upon the tree which stood their point their nake bough to heaven
no on who had not seen it could imagin the devast furi of that
storm for exampl the head of the divin who wa buri in the
courtyard await resurrect through our magic wa it mai be
recal cover with a stout earthenwar pot now that pot had
shatter into sherd and the head beneath wa noth but bit of
broken bone which it would have been imposs for the veri best magic
to reconstruct to the like of a human be
calam inde stalk nake through the land
chapter xiii
jana
no breakfast wa brought to us that morn probabl for the reason
that there wa none to bring thi did not matter howev see that
plenti of food accumul from supper and other meal stood in a corner
of the hous practic untouch so we at what we could and then
paid our usual visit to the hut in which the camelmen had been confin
i sai had been for now it wa quit empti the last poor fellow have
vanish awai like hi companion
the sight of thi vacuum fill me with a kind of furi
thei have all been murder i said to mart
no he repli with gentl accuraci thei have been sacrif to
jana what we have seen on the marketplac at night wa the rite of
their sacrific now it will be our turn lord macumazana
well i exclaim i hope these devil ar satisfi with jana
answer to their accurs offer and if thei try their fiendish
prank on us
doubtless there will be anoth answer but lord the question is
will that help us
dumb with impot rage i return to the hous where present the
remain of the reed gate open through it appear simba the king the
divin with the injur foot walk upon crutch and other of whom
the most were more or less wound presum by the hailston then
it wa that in my wrath i put off the pretenc of not understand
their languag and went for them befor thei could utter a singl word
where ar our servant you murder i ask shake my fist at
them have you sacrif them to your devilgod if so behold the
fruit of sacrific and i swept my arm toward the countri beyond
where ar your crop i went on tell me on what you will live thi
winter at these word thei quail in their imagin alreadi thei
saw famin stalk toward them why do you keep us here is it that
you wait for a wors thing to befal you why do you visit us here now
and i paus gasp with indign
we came to look whether you had brought back to life that doctor whom
you kill with your magic white man answer the king heavili
i step to the corner of the courtyard and draw asid a mat that
i had thrown there show them what lai beneath
look then i said and be sure that if you do not let us go as
yonder thing is so shall all of you be befor anoth moon ha been
born and di such is the life we shall give to evil men like you
now thei grew posit terrifi
lord said simba for the first time address me by a titl of
respect your magic is too strong for us great misfortun ha fallen
upon our land hundr of peopl ar dead kill by the iceston
that you have call down our harvest is ruin and there is but
littl corn left in the storepit now when we look to gather the new
grain messeng come in from the outli land tell us that nearli
all the sheep and goat and veri mani of the cattl ar slain soon we
shall starv
as you deserv to starv i answer nowwil you let us go
simba stare at me doubtfulli then began to whisper into the ear of
the lame divin i could not catch what thei said so i watch their
face that of the divin whose head i wa glad to see had been cut by
a hailston so that both end of him were now injur told me a good
deal hi mask had been ugli but now that it wa off the counten
beneath wa far uglier of a negroid type pendulouslip sensuou
and looseei he wa inde a hideou fellow yet veri cun and
cruellook as men of hi class ar apt to be humbl as he wa
for the moment i felt sure that he wa still plot evil against us
somewhat against the will of hi master the issu show that i wa
right at length simba spoke sai
we had intend lord to keep you and the priest of the child here as
hostag against mischief that might be work on us by the follow
of the child who have alwai been our bitter enemi and done us much
undeserv wrong although on our part we have faithfulli kept the pact
conclud in the dai of our grandfath it seem howev that fate
or your magic is too strong for us and therefor i have determin to
let you go tonight at sundown we will set you on the road which lead
to the ford of the river tava which divid our territori from that of
the white kendah and you mai depart where you will sinc our wish is
that never again mai we see your illomen face
at thi intellig my heart leapt in joi that wa altogeth
prematur but preserv my indign air i exclaim
tonight why tonight why not at onc it is hard for us to cross
unknown river in the dark
the water is low lord and the ford easi moreov if you start
now you would reach it in the dark wherea if you start at sundown you
will reach it in the morn lastli we cannot conduct you henc until
we have buri our dead
then without give me time to answer he turn and left the place
follow by the other onli at the gatewai the divin wheel round on
hi crutch and glare at us both mutter someth with hi thick
lip probabl it wa curs
at ani rate thei ar go to set us free i said to mart not
without exult when thei had all vanish
ye lord he repli but where ar thei go to set us free the
demon jana live in the forest and the swamp by the bank of the tava
river and it is said that he ravag at night
i did not pursu the subject but reflect to myself cheerfulli that
thi mystic rogueeleph wa a long wai off and might be circumv
wherea that altar of sacrific wa extrem near and veri difficult to
avoid
never did a thief with a rich booti in view or a wooer have an
assign with hi ladi wait for sundown more eagerli than i did that
dai hour after hour i sat upon the housetop watch the black kendah
carri off the dead kill by the hailston and gener try to
repair the damag done by the terrif tempest watch the sun also
as it climb down the cloudless sky and liter count the minut
till it should reach the horizon although i knew well that it would
have been wiser after such a night to prepar for our journei by ly
down to sleep
at length the great orb began to sink in majesti behind the tatter
western forest and punctual to the minut simba with a mount
escort of some twenti men and two led hors appear at our gate as
our prepar which consist onli of mart stuf such food as
wa avail into the breast of hi robe were alreadi made we walk
out of that accurs guesthous and at a sign from the king mount
the hors ride across the empti marketplac and past the spot where
the rough stone altar still stood with char bone protrud from
the ash of it extinguish firewer thei those of our friend the
cameldriv i wonderedw enter the north street of the town
here stand at the door of their hous were mani of the
inhabit who had gather to watch us pass never did i see hate more
savag than wa written on those face as thei shook their fist at us
and mutter curs not loud but deep
no wonder for thei were all ruin poor folk with noth to look
forward to but starvat until long month henc the harvest came again
for those who would live to gather it also thei were convinc that we
the white magician and the prophet of their enemi the child had brought
thi disast on them had it not been for the escort i believ thei
would have fallen on us and torn us to piec consid them i
understood for the first time how disagre real unpopular can
be but when i saw the actual condit of the fruit garden without
in the wane daylight i confess that i wa move to some sympathi with
their owner it wa appal not a hand of grain wa there left
to gather for the corn had been not onli laid but liter cut to
ribbon by the hail
after run for some mile through the cultiv land the road
enter the forest here it wa dark as pitch so dark that i wonder
how our guid found their wai in that black dread apprehens
seiz me for i becam convinc that we had been brought here to be
murder everi minut i expect to feel a knifethrust in my back i
thought of dig my heel into the hors side and try to gallop
off anywher but abandon the idea first becaus i could not desert
mart of whom i had lost touch in the gloom and secondli becaus i wa
hem in by the escort for the same reason i did not try to slip from
the hors and glide awai into the forest there wa noth to be done
save to go on and await the end
it came at last some hour later we were out of the forest now and
there wa the moon rise past her full but still veri bright her
light show me that we were on a wild moorland swampi with scatter
tree grow here and there across which what seem to be a game
track ran down hill that wa all i could make out here the escort
halt and simba the king said in a sullen voic
dismount and go your wai evil spirit for we travel no farther
across thi place which is haunt follow the track and it will lead
you to a lake pass the lake and by morn you will come to the river
beyond which li the countri of your friend mai it water swallow
you if you reach them for learn there is on who watch on thi road
whom few care to meet
as he finish speak men sprang at us and pull us from the
hors thrust us out of their compani then thei turn and in anoth
minut were lost in the dark leav us alon
what now friend mart i ask
now lord all we can do is to go forward for if we stai here simba
and hi peopl will return and kill us at the daylight on of them said
so to me
then come on macduff i exclaim step out briskli and
though he had never read shakespear mart understood and follow
what did simba mean about on on the road whom few care to meet i
ask over my shoulder when we had done half a mile or so
i think he meant the eleph jana repli mart with a groan
then i hope jana isnt at home cheer up mart the chanc ar that
we shall never meet a singl eleph in thi big place
yet mani eleph have been here lord and he point to the ground
it is said that thei come to die by the water of the lake and thi
is on of the road thei follow on their death journei a road that no
other live thing dare travel
oh i exclaim then after all that wa a true dream i had in the
hous in england
ye lord becaus my brother hart onc lost hi wai out hunt when
he wa young and saw what hi mind show you in the dream and what we
shall see present if we live to come so far
i made no repli both becaus what he said wa either true or fals
which i should ascertain present and becaus i wa engag in
search the ground with my ey he wa right mani eleph had
travel thi pathon quit recent i a hunter of those brute
could not be deceiv on thi point onc or twice also i thought that
i caught sight of the outlin of some tall creatur move silent
through the scatter thorn a coupl of hundr yard or so to our
right it might have been an eleph or a giraff or perhap noth
but a shadow so i said noth as i heard no nois i wa inclin
to believ the latter explan in ani case what wa the good of
speak unarm and solitari amidst unknown danger our posit wa
desper and as mart nerv wa alreadi give out to emphas it
horror to him would be mere foolish
on we trudg for anoth two hour dure which time the onli live
thing that i saw wa a larg owl which sail round our head as though
to look at us and then flew awai ahead
thi owl mart inform me wa on of jana spi that kept him
advis of all that wa pass in hi territori i mutter bosh
and tramp on still i wa glad that we saw no more of the owl for in
certain circumst such dark fear ar catch
we reach the top of a rise and there beneath us lai the most desol
scene that ever i have seen at least it would have been the most
desol if i did not chanc to have look on it befor in the
drawingroom of ragnal castl there wa no doubt about it below wa
the black melancholi lake a larg sheet of water surround by reed
around but at a consider distanc appear the tropic forest to
the east of the lake stretch a stoni plain at the time i could make
out no more becaus of the uncertain light and the distanc for we had
still over a mile to go befor we reach the edg of the lake
the aspect of the place fill me with trembl both becaus of it
utter uncanni and becaus of the inexplic truth that i had seen
it befor most peopl will have experienc thi kind of moral shock
when on go to some new land thei recogn a local as be quit
familiar to them in all it detail or it mai be the room of a hous
hitherto unvisit by them or it mai be a convers of which when
it begin thei alreadi foreknow the sequenc and the end becaus in
some dim state when or how who can sai thei have taken part in
that talk with those same speaker if thi be so even in cheer
surround and among our friend or acquaint it is easi to
imagin how much greater wa the shock to me a travel on such a
journei and in such a night
i shrank from approach the shore of thi lake rememb that as
yet all the vision wa not unrol i look about me if we went to
the left we should either strike the water or if we follow it edg
still bear to the left must ultim reach the forest where
probabl we should be lost i look to the right the ground wa strewn
with boulder among which grew thorn and rank grass impractic for
men on foot at night i look behind me medit retreat and there
some hundr of yard awai behind low scrubbi mimosa mix with
aloelik plant i saw someth brown toss up and disappear again that
might veri well have been the trunk of an eleph then anim
by the courag of despair and a desir to know the worst i began to
descend the eleph track toward the lake almost at a run
ten minut or so more brought us to the eastern head of the lake where
the reed whisper in the breath of the night wind like thing aliv
as i expect it prove to be a bare open space where noth seem
to grow ye and all about me were the decai remain of eleph
hundr of them some with their bone cover in moss that mai have
lain here for gener and other more newli dead thei were all
old beast as i could tell by the tusk whether male or femal inde
about me within a radiu of a quarter of a mile lai enough ivori to make
a man veri rich for life sinc although discolour much of it seem
to have kept quit sound like human teeth in a mummi case the sight
gave me a new zest for life if onli i could manag to surviv and carri
off that ivori i would in thi wai or in that i swore that i would
who could possibl die with so much ivori to be had for the take not
that old hunter allan quatermain
then i forgot about the ivori for there in front of me just where
it should be just as i had seen it in the dreampictur wa the bull
eleph dy a thin and ancient brute that had live it long life
to the last hour it search about as though to find a conveni
restingplac and when thi wa discov stood over it swai
to and fro for a full minut then it lift it trunk and trumpet
shrilli thrice sing it swansong after which it sank slowli to it
knee it trunk outstretch and the point of it worn tusk rest
on the ground evid it wa dead
i let my ey travel on and behold about fifti yard beyond the dead
bull wa a mound of hard rock i watch it with gasp expect
andy on the top of the mound someth slowli materi
although i knew what it must be well enough for a while i could not see
quit clearli becaus there were certain littl cloud about and on of
them had float over the face of the moon it pass and befor me
perhap a hundr and forti pace awai outlin clearli against the
sky i perceiv the devilish eleph of my vision
oh what a brute wa that in bulk and height it appear to be half
as big again as ani of it tribe which i had known in all my life
experi it wa enorm unearthli a survivor perhap of some
ancient speci that live befor the flood or at least a veri giant of
it kind it greyblack side were scar as though with fight on
of it huge tusk much worn at the end for evid it wa veri old
gleam white in the moonlight the other wa broken off about halfwai
down it length when perfect it had been malform for it curv
downward and not upward also rather out to the right
there stood thi mammoth thi leviathan thi monstrum horrendum
inform ingen as i rememb my old father us to call a certain
gigant and misshapen bull that we had on the station flap a pair
of ear that look like the side of a kafir hut and wave a trunk
as big as a weaver beamwhatev a weaver beam mai bean appal
and a petrifi sight
i squat behind the skeleton of an eleph which happen to be handi
and well cover with moss and fern and watch the beast fascin
wish that i had a largebor rifl in my hand what becam of mart i
do not exactli know but i think that he lai down on the ground
dure the minut or so that follow i reflect a good deal as we
do in time of emerg often after a useless sort of a fashion for
instanc i wonder why the brute appear thu upon yonder mound and
the thought suggest itself to me that it wa summon thither from
some neighbour lair by the trumpet call of the dy eleph it
occur to me even that it wa a kind of king of the eleph to
which thei felt bound to report themselv as it were in the hour
of their deceas certainli what follow gave some credenc to my
fantast notion which if there were anyth in it might account
for thi great graveyard at that particular spot
after stand for a while in the attitud that i have describ
test the air with it trunk jana for i will call him so lumber
down the mound and advanc straight to where the eleph that i had
thought to be dead wa kneel as a matter of fact it wa not quit
dead for when jana arriv it lift it trunk and curl it round
that of jana as though in affection greet then let it fall to
the ground again thereon jana did what i had seen it do in my dream or
vision at ragnal name attack it knock it over on to it side
where it lai motionless quit dead thi time
now i rememb that the vision wa not accur after all sinc in it
i had seen jana destroi a woman and a child who on the present occas
were want sinc then i have thought that thi wa becaus hart
clairvoyantli or telepath had convei to me as inde mart
declar a scene which he had wit similar to that which i wa
wit but not ident in it incid thu it happen
perhap that while the act of the woman and the child wa omit
in our case there wa anoth act of the plai to follow of which i had
receiv no inkl in my ragnal experi inde if i had receiv
it i should not have been there that night for no induc on earth
would have brought me to kendahland
thi wa the act jana have prod hi dead brother to hi
satisfact whether from vicious or to put it out of pain i
cannot sai stood over the carcass in an attitud of grief or piou
medit at thi time i should mention the wind which had been
rustl the hailstrip reed at the lake border had di awai
almost but not complet that is to sai onli a veri faint gust
blew now and again which with a hunter instinct i observ with
satisfact drew from the direct of jana toward ourselv thi i
knew becaus it struck on my forehead which wa wet with perspir
and cool the skin
present howev by a curs spite of fate on of these gustsa
veri littl onecam from some quarter behind us for i felt it in my
back hair that wa as damp as the rest of me just then i wa glanc
to my right where it seem to me that out of the corner of my ey i
had caught sight of someth pass among the stone at a distanc
of a hundr yard or so possibl the shadow of a cloud or anoth
eleph at the time i did not ascertain which it wa sinc a faint
rattl from jana trunk reconcentr all my faculti on him in a
painfulli vivid fashion
i look to see that all the contempl had depart from hi
attitud now as alert as that of a foxterri which imagin he ha
seen a rat hi vast ear were cock hi huge bulk trembl hi
enorm trunk snif the air
great heaven thought i to myself he ha wind us then i took
such consol as i could from the fact that the next gust onc more
struck upon my forehead for i hope he would conclud that he had made
a mistak
not a bit of it jana as far too old a birdor beastto make ani
mistak he grunt got himself go like a luggag train and with
great deliber walk toward us smell at the ground smell
at the air smell to the right to the left and even toward heaven
abov as though he expect that thenc might fall upon him vengeanc
for hi mani sin a dozen time as he came did i cover him with an
imaginari rifl mark the exact spot where i might have hope to
send a bullet to hi vital in a kind of automat fashion for all my
real brain wa contempl my own approach end
i wonder how it would happen would he drive that great tusk through
me would he throw me into the air or would he kneel upon my poor
littl bodi and aveng the death of hi kin that had fallen at my
hand mart wa speak in a rattl whisper
hi priest have told jana to kill us we ar about to die he said
befor i die i want to sai that the ladi the wife of the lord
silenc i hiss he will hear you for at that instant i took not
the slightest interest in ani ladi on the earth fierc i glare at
mart and note even then how piti wa hi counten there wa no
smile there now all it jovial round had vanish it had sunk in
it wa blue and ghastli with larg protrud ey like to that of a
man who had been three dai dead
i wa rightjana had heard low as the whisper wa through that
intens silenc it had penetr to hi almost preternatur sens
forward he came at a run for twenti pace or more with hi trunk held
straight out in front of him then he halt again perhap the length
of a cricket pitch awai and smelt as befor
the sight wa too much for mart he sprang up and ran for hi life
toward the lake purpos i suppos to take refug in the water
oh how he ran after him went jana like a railwai engineexpress thi
timetrumpet as he charg mart reach the lake which wa quit
close about ten yard ahead and plung into it with a bound began
to swim
now i thought he mai get awai if the crocodil dont have him for
that devil will scarc take to the water but thi wa just where i
made a mistak for with a mighti splash in went jana too also he wa
the better swimmer mart soon saw thi and swung round to the shore by
which manoeuvr he gain a littl as he could turn quicker than jana
back thei came jana just behind mart strike at him with hi great
trunk thei land mart flew a few yard ahead doubl in and out
among the rock like a hare and to my horror make for where i lai
whether by accid or in a mad hope of obtain protect i do not
know
it mai be ask why i had not taken the opportun to run also in the
opposit direct there ar sever answer the first wa that there
seem to be nowher to run the second that i felt sure if i did run
i should trip up over the skeleton of those eleph or the stone
the third that i did not think of it at onc the fourth that jana
had not yet seen me and i had no crave to introduc myself to him
person and the fifth and greatest that i wa so paralys with
fear that i did not feel as though i could lift myself from the ground
everyth about me seem to be dead except my power of observ
which were painfulli aliv
of a sudden mart gave up less than a stone throw from me he wheel
round and face jana hurl at him some fear and concentr
curs of which all that i could distinguish were the word the
child
oddli enough it seem to have an effect upon the furiou rogu which
halt in it rush and put it four feet togeth slid a few pace
nearer and stood still it wa just as though the beast had understood
the word and were consid them if so their effect wa to rous
him to perfect mad he scream terribl he lash hi side with
hi trunk hi red and wick ey roll foam flew from the cavern
of hi open mouth he danc upon hi great feet a sort of hideou
scottish reel then he charg
i shut my ey for a moment when i open them again it wa to see
poor mart higher in the air than ever he flew befor i thought that
he would never come down but he did at last with an awesom thud jana
went to him and veri gentli now that he wa dead pick him up in hi
trunk i prai that he might carri him awai to some hidingplac and
leav me in peac but not so with slow and state stride rock
the deceas mart up and down in hi trunk as a nurs might rock
a babi he march on to the veri stone where i lai behind which i
suppos he had seen or smelt me all the time
for quit a long while it seem more than a centuri he stood over me
studi me as though i interest him veri much the water of the lake
trickl in a refresh stream from hi great ear on to my back had
it not been for that water i think i should have faint but as it wa
i did the next best thingpretend to be dead perhap thi monster
would scorn to touch a dead man watch out of the corner of my ey i
saw him lift on vast paw that wa the size of an armchair and hold it
over me
now goodby to the world thought i then the foot descend as a
steamhamm doe but also as a steamhamm sometim doe when us
to crack nut stop as it touch my back and present came to
earth again alongsid of me perhap becaus jana thought the foothold
danger at ani rate he took anoth and better wai deposit the
remain of mart with the most tender care besid me as though the
nurs were put the child to bed he unwound hi yard of trunk and
began to feel me all over with it tip commenc at the back of my
neck oh the sensat of that clammi wriggl tip upon my spinal
column
down it went till it reach the seat of my trouser there it pinch
presum to ascertain whether or no i were maling a most
agon pinch like to that of a pair of blacksmith tong so sharp
wa it that although i did not stir who wa awar that the slightest
movement meant death it tore a piec out of the stout cloth of my
breech to sai noth of a portion of the skin beneath thi seem
to astonish the beast for it lift the tip of it trunk and shift
it head as though to examin the fragment by the light of the moon
now inde all wa over for when it saw blood upon that cloth i
put up on short piteou prayer to heaven to save me from thi terribl
end and lo it wa answer
for just as jana the result of the inspect be unsatisfactori
wa cock hi ear and make readi to slai me there rang out the
short sharp report of a rifl fire within a few yard glanc up
at the instant i saw blood spurt from the monster left ey where
evid the bullet had found a home
he felt at hi ey with hi trunk then utter a scream of pain
wheel round and rush awai
chapter xiv
the chase
i suppos that i swoon for a minut or two at ani rate i rememb
a long and veri curiou dream such a dream as is evolv by a patient
under laugh ga that is veri clear and vivid at the time but
immedi afterward slip from the mind grasp as water doe
from the clench hand it wa someth to the effect that all those
hundr of skeleton eleph rose and marshal themselv befor me
make obeis to me by bend their boni knee becaus as i quit
understood i wa the onli human be that had ever escap from jana
moreov on the foremost eleph skull han wa perch like a
mahout give word of command to their serri rank and explain
to them that it would be veri conveni if thei would carri their
tusk for which thei had no further us and pile them in a certain
placei forget wherethat must be near a good road to facilit their
subsequ transport to a land where thei would be made into billiard
ball and the back of ladi hairbrush next through the figment
of that retreat dream i heard the undoubt voic of han himself
which of cours i knew to be absurd as han wa lost and doubtless dead
sai
if you ar aliv baa pleas wake up soon as i have finish
reload intombi and it is time to be go i think i hit jana in the
ey but so big a beast will soon get over so littl a thing as that and
look for us and the bullet from intombi is too small to kill him baa
especi as it is not like that either of us could hit him in the
other ey
now i sat up and stare ye there wa han himself look just the
same as usual onli perhap rather dirtier engag in set a cap on
to the nippl of the littl rifl intombi
han i said in a hollow voic why the devil ar you here
to save you from the devil of cours baa he repli aptli then
rest the gun against the stone the old fellow knelt down by my side
and throw hi arm around me began to blubber over me exclaim
just in time baa onli just in time for as usual han made a mess of
thing and judg badlyil tell you afterward still just in time
thank be to your reverend father the predik oh if he had delai
me for on more minut you would have been as flat as my nose baa now
come quickli iv got the camel ti up there and he can carri two
be fat and strong after four dai rest with plenti to eat thi
place is haunt baa and that king of the devil jana will be back
after us present as soon as he ha wipe the blood out of hi ey
i didnt make ani remark have no tast for convers just then
but onli look at poor mart who lai by me as though he wa sleep
oh baa said han there is no need to troubl about him for
hi neck is broken and he quit dead also it is as well he ad
cheerfulli for as your reverend father doubtless rememb the
camel could never carri three moreov if he stop here perhap jana
will come back to plai with him instead of follow us
poor mart thi wa hi requiem as sung by han
with a last glanc at the unhappi man to whom i had grown attach in a
wai dure our time of joint captiv and trial i took the arm of the
old hottentot or rather leant upon hi shoulder for at first i felt
too weak to walk by myself and pick my path with him through the
stone and skeleton of eleph across the plateau eastward that
is awai from the lake about two hundr yard from the scene of our
tragedi wa a mound of rock similar to that on which jana had appear
but much smaller behind which we found the camel kneel as a
welltrain beast of the sort should do and tether to a stone
as we went in brief but suffici languag han told me hi stori
it seem that after he had shot the kendah gener it came into hi
cun forese mind that he might be of more us to me free than as
a companion in captiv or that if i were kill he might in that case
live to bring vengeanc on my slayer so he broke awai as ha been
describ and hid till nightfal on the hillsid then by the light
of the moon he track us avoid the villag and ultim found
a place of shelter in a kind of cave in the forest near to simba town
where no peopl live here he fed the camel at night conceal it
at dawn in the cave the dai he spent up a tall tree whenc he could
watch all that went on in the town beneath live meanwhil on some
food which he carri in a bag ti to the saddl help out by green
meali which he stole from a neighbour field
thu he saw most of what pass in the town includ the desol
wrought by the fear tempest of hail which be in their cave both
he and the camel escap without harm on the next even from hi
post of outlook up the tree where he had now some difficulti in hide
himself becaus the hail had strip off all it leav he saw mart
and myself brought from the guesthous and taken awai by the escort
descend and run to the cave he saddl the camel and start
in pursuit plung into the forest and hide there when he perceiv
that the escort were leav us
here he wait until thei had gone by on their return journei so close
did thei pass to him that he could overhear their talk which told him
thei expect or rather were sure that we should be destroi by the
eleph jana their devil god to whom the camelmen had been alreadi
sacrif after thei had depart he remount and follow us here i
ask him why he had not overtaken us befor we came to the cemeteri of
eleph as i presum he might have done sinc he state that he wa
close in our rear thi inde wa the case for it wa the head of the
camel i saw behind the thorn tree when i look back and not the trunk
of an eleph as i had suppos
at the time he would give me no direct answer except that he grew
muddl as he had alreadi suggest and thought it best to keep in the
background and see what happen long afterward howev he admit
to me that he act on a presenti
it seem to me baa he said that your reverend father wa tell
me that i should do best to let you two go on and not show myself sinc
if i did so we should all three be kill as on of us must walk whom
the other two could not desert wherea if i left you as you were on
of you would be kill and the other escap and that the on to be
kill would not be you baa all of which came about as the spirit
spoke in my head for mart wa kill who did not matter andyou
know the rest baa
to return to han stori he saw us march down to the border of the
lake and keep to our right took cover behind the knoll of rock
whenc he watch also all that follow when jana advanc to attack
us han crept forward in the hope a veri wild on of crippl him
with the littl purdei rifl inde he wa about to fire at the hind
leg when mart made hi run for life and plung into the lake then he
crawl on to lead me awai to the camel but when he wa within a few
yard the chase return our wai and mart wa kill
from that moment he wait for an opportun to shoot jana in the onli
spot where so soft a bullet would as he knew have the faintest chanc
of injur him vitallynam in the eyefor he wa sure that it
penetr would not be suffici to reach the vital through that
thick hide and the mass of flesh behind with an infinit and wonder
patienc he wait know that my life or death hung in the balanc
while jana held hi foot over me while he felt me with hi trunk still
han wait balanc the argument for and against fire upon the
scale of experi in hi clever old mind and in the end come to a
right and wise conclus
at length hi chanc came the brute expos hi ey and by the light
of the clear moon han alwai a veri good shot at a distanc when it
wa not necessari to allow for trajectori and wind let drive and hit
the bullet did not get to the brain as he had hope it had not strength
for that but it destroi thi left ey and gave jana such pain that
for a while he forgot all about me and everyth els except escap
such wa the hottentot tale as i pick it up from hi lacon
colourless dutch patoi sentenc then and afterward a veri
wonder tale i thought but for him hi fidel and hi bushman
cun where should i have found myself befor that moon set
we mount the camel after i had paus a minut to take a pull from
a flask of brandi which remain in the saddlebag although he love
strong drink so well han had save it untouch on the mere chanc
that it might some time be of servic to me hi master the monkeylik
hottentot sat in front and direct the camel while i accommod
myself as best i could on the sheepskin behind luckili thei were thick
and soft for jana pinch wa not exactli that of a lover
off we went pick our wai carefulli till we reach the eleph
track beyond the mound where jana had appear which in the light of
faith we hope would lead us to the river tava here we made better
progress but still could not go veri fast becaus of the hole made by
the feet of jana and hi compani soon we had left the cemeteri behind
us and lost sight of the lake which i devoutli trust i might never
see again
now the track ran upward from the hollow to a ridg two or three mile
awai we reach the crest of thi ridg without accid except that
on our road we met anoth ag eleph a cow with veri poor tusk
travel to it last rest place or so i suppos i dont know
which wa the more frighten the sick cow or the camel for camel
hate eleph as hors hate camel until thei get us to them the
cow bolt to the right as quickli as it could which wa not veri fast
and the camel bolt to the left with such convuls bound that we
were nearli thrown off it back howev be an equabl brute it
soon recov it balanc and we got back to the track beyond the cow
from the top of the rise we saw that befor us lai a sandi plain lightli
cloth in grass and to our joi about ten mile awai at the foot of
a veri gentl slope the moonlight gleam upon the water of a broad
river it wa not easi to make out but it wa there we were both sure
it wa there we could not mistak the waver silver flash on we
went for anoth quarter of a mile when someth caus me to turn
round on the sheepskin and look back
oh heaven at the veri top of the rise clearli outlin against
the sky stood jana himself with hi trunk lift next instant he
trumpet a furiou rattl challeng of rage and defianc
allemagt baa said han the old devil is come to look for
hi lost ey and ha seen us with that which remain he ha been
travel on our spoor
forward i answer bring my heel into the camel rib
then the race began the camel wa a veri good camel on of the real
run breed also as han said it wa compar fresh and mai
moreov have been awar that it wa near to the plain where it had
been bred lastli the go wa now excel soft to it spongi feet
but not too deep in sand nor were there ani rock over which it could
fall it went off like the wind make noth of our unit weight
which did not come to more than two hundr pound or a half of what
it could carri with eas be perhap urg to it top speed by the
knowledg that the eleph wa behind for mile after mile we rush
down the plain but we did not go alon for jana came after us like a
cruiser after a gunboat moreov swiftli as we travel he travel
just a littl swifter gain sai a few yard in everi hundr for the
last mile befor we came to the river bank half an hour later perhap
though it seem to be a week he wa not more than fifti pace to our
rear i glanc back at him and in the light of the moon which wa
grow low he bore a strang resembl to a mud cottag with broken
chimnei which were hi ear flap on each side of him and the
yard pump project from the upper window
we shall beat him now han i said look at the broad river which
wa now close at hand
ye baa answer han doubtfulli and in jerk thi is veri good
camel baa he run so fast that i have no insid left i suppos
becaus he smell hi wife over that river to sai noth of death
behind him but baa i am not sure that devil jana is still faster
than the camel and he want to settl for hi lost ey which make him
live also i see stone ahead which ar bad for camel then there
is the river and i dont know if camel can swim but jana can as mart
learn do you think baa that you could manag to sting him up
with a bullet in hi knee or that great trunk of hi just to give him
someth to think about besid ourselv
thu he prattl on i believ to occupi my mind and hi own till at
length grow impati i repli
be silent donkei can i shoot an eleph backward over my shoulder
with a rifl meant for springbuck hit the camel hit it hard
ala han wa right there were stone at the verg of the river
which doubtless it had wash out in period of past flood and
present we were among them now a camel so good on sand that is it
nativ heath is a worthless brute among stone over which it slip and
flounder but to jana these appear to offer littl or no obstacl at
ani rate he came over them almost if not quit as fast as befor by
the time that we reach the brink of the water he wa not more than ten
yard behind i could even see the blood run down from the socket of
hi ruin ey
moreov at the sight of the foam but shallow torrent the camel
a creatur unaccustom to water pull up in a mulish kind of wai and
for a moment refus to stir luckili at thi instant jana let off on
of hi archangel kind of trumpet which start our beast again
sinc it wa more afraid of eleph than it wa of water
in we went and were present flounder among the loos stone at the
bottom of the river which wa nowher over four feet deep with jana
splash after us not more than five yard behind i twist myself
round and fire at him with the rifl whether i hit him or no i could
not sai but he stop for a few second perhap becaus he rememb
the effect of a similar explos upon hi ey which gave us a trifl
start then he came on again in hi steamengin fashion
when we were about in the middl of the river the inevit happen
the camel fell pitch us over it head into the stream still
cling to the rifl i pick myself up and began half to swim half to
wade toward the farther shore catch hold of han with my free hand
in a moment jana wa on to that camel he gore it with hi tusk he
trampl it with hi feet he got it round the neck with hi trunk
drag nearli the whole bulk of it out of the water then he set to
work to pound it down into the mud and stone at the bottom of the river
with such a persist thorough that he gave us time to reach
the other bank and climb up a stout tree which grew there a slope
flattop kind of tree that wa fortun easi to ascend at least
for a man here we sat gasp perhap about thirti feet abov the
ground level and wait
present jana have finish with the camel follow us and
without ani difficulti locat us in that tree he walk all round it
consid the situat then he wound hi huge trunk about the bole
of the tree and put out hi strength tri to pull it over it wa
an anxiou moment but thi particular child of the forest had not grown
there for some hundr of year withstand all the shock of wind
weather and water in order to be laid low by an eleph howev
enorm it shook a littleno more abandon thi attempt as futil
jana next began to try to dig it up by drive hi tusk under it root
here too he fail becaus thei grew among stone which evid
jar him
ceas from these agricultur effort with a deep rumbl of rage he
adopt yet a third expedi rear hi huge bulk into the air he
brought down hi forefeet with all the tremend weight of hi great
bodi behind them on to the slope trunk of the tree just below where
the branch sprang perhap twelv or thirteen feet abov the ground
the shock wa so heavi that for a moment i thought the tree would be
uproot or snap in two thank heaven it held but the vibrat wa
such that han and i were nearli shaken out of the upper branch like
autumn appl from a bough inde i think i should have gone had not
the monkeylik han who had toe to cling with as well as finger
grip me by the collar
thrice did jana repeat thi manoeuvr and at the third onslaught i saw
to my horror that the root were loosen i heard some of them snap
and a crack appear in the ground not far from the bole fortun
jana never note these symptom for abandon a plan which he
consid unavail he stood for a while swai hi trunk and lost
in gentl thought
han i whisper load the rifl quick i can get him in the spine
or the other ey
wet powder wont go off baa groan han the water got to it in
the river
no i answer and it is all your fault for make me shoot at him
when i could take no aim
it would have been just the same baa for the rifl went under water
also when we fell from the camel and the cap would have been damp and
perhap the powder too also the shot made jana stop for a moment
thi wa true but it wa madden to be oblig to sit there with an
empti gun when if i had but on charg or even my pistol i wa sure
that i could have blind or crippl thi satan pachyderm
a few minut later jana plai hi last card come quit close to
the trunk of the tree he rear himself up as befor but thi time
stretch out hi foreleg so that these and hi bodi were support on
the broad bole then he elong hi trunk and with it began to break
off bough which grew between us and him
i dont think he can reach us i said doubtfulli to han that is
unless he bring a stone to stand on
oh baa prai be silent answer han or he will understand and
fetch on
although the idea seem absurd on the whole i thought it well to take
the hint for who knew how much thi experienc beast did or did not
understand then as we could go no higher we wriggl as far as we
dare along our bough and wait
present jana have finish hi clear oper began to
lengthen hi trunk to it full measur liter it seem to expand
like a telescop or an indiarubb ring out it came foot after foot
till it snap tip wa wave within a few inch of us just short
of my foot and han head or rather felt hat on final stretch and he
reach the hat which he remov with a flourish and thrust into the
red cavern of hi mouth as it appear no more i suppos he at it
thi loss of hi hat move han to furi hurl horribl curs at jana
he drew hi butcher knife and made readi
onc more the sinuou brown trunk elong itself evid jana had
got a better hold with hi hind leg thi time or perhap had actual
wriggl himself a few inch up the tree at ani rate i saw to my
dismai that there wa everi prospect of my make a second acquaint
with that snap tip the end of the trunk wa ly along my bough
like a huge brown snake and creep up up up
hell get us i mutter
han said noth but lean forward a littl hold on with hi left
hand next instant in the light of the rise sun i saw a knife flash
saw also that the point of it had been driven through the lower lip of
jana trunk pin it to the bough like a butterfli to a board
my word what a commot ensu up the trunk came a scream which
nearli blew me awai then jana with a wriggl motion tri to unnail
himself as gentli as possibl for it wa clear that the knife point
hurt him but could not do so becaus han still held the handl and had
driven the blade deep into the wood lastli he drag himself downward
with such energi that someth had to go that someth be the skin
and muscl of the lower lip which wa cut clean through leav the
knife erect in the bough
over he went backward a most imperi cropper then he pick himself
up thrust the tip of hi trunk into hi mouth suck it as on doe a
cut finger and final roar in defeat rage fled into the river
which he wade and back upon hi track toward hi own home ye off
he went han scream curs and demand that he should restor hi
hat to him and veri seldom in all my life have i seen a sight that i
thought more beauti than that of hi whisk tail
now baa chuckl han the old devil ha got a sore nose as well
as a sore ey by which to rememb us and baa i think we had better
be go befor he ha time to think and come back with a long stick to
knock us out of thi tree
so we went in doublequick time i can assur you or at ani rate as
fast as my stiff limb and gener condit would allow fortun
we had now no doubt as to our direct sinc stand up through the
mist of dawn with the sunbeam rest on it forestclad crest we
could clearli see the strang tumulusshap hill which the white
kendah call the holi mount the home of the child it appear to be
about twenti mile awai but in realiti wa a good deal farther for
when we had walk for sever hour it seem almost as distant as
ever
in truth that wa a dread trudg not onli wa i exhaust with all
the terror i had pass and our long midnight flight but the wound
where jana had pinch out a portion of my frame inflam by the
ride had now grown stiff and intoler sore so that everi step
gave me pain which sometim culmin in agoni moreov it wa
no us give in foodless as we were for mart had carri the
provis and with the chanc of jana return to look us up so i
stuck to it and said noth
for the first ten mile the countri seem uninhabit doubtless it
wa too near the border of the black kendah to be popular as a place
of resid after thi we saw herd of cattl and a few camel
appar untend perhap their guard were hidden awai in the long
grass then we came to some field of meali that were i notic
quit untouch by the hailstorm which it would seem had confin it
attent to the land of the black kendah of these we at thankfulli
enough a littl farther on we perceiv hut perch on an inaccess
place in a kloof also their inhabit perceiv us for thei ran awai
as though in a great fright
still we did not try to approach the hut not know how we should
be receiv after my sojourn in simba town i had becom possess of a
love of life in the open
for anoth two hour i limp forward with pain and griefbi now i wa
lean on han shoulderup an endless uncultiv rise cloth with
euphorbia and fernlik cycad at length we reach it top and found
ourselv within a rifl shot of a fenc nativ villag i suppos that
it inhabit had been warn of our come by runner from the hut
i have mention at ani rate the moment we appear the men to the
number of thirti or more pour out of the south gate arm with spear
and other weapon and proceed to ring us round and behav in a veri
threaten manner i notic at onc that although most of them were
compar light in colour some of these men partook of the negro
characterist of the black kendah from whom we had escap to such an
extent inde that thi blood wa clearli predomin in them still
it wa also clear that thei were deadli foe of thi peopl for when
i shout out to them that we were the friend of hart and those who
worship the child thei yell back that we were liar no friend
of the child thei said came from the countri of the black kendah who
worship the devil jana i tri to explain that least of all men in
the world did we worship jana who had been hunt us for hour but
thei would not listen
you ar spi of simba the smell of jana is upon you thi mai have
been true enough thei yell ad we will kill you whitefac
goat we will kill you littl yellow monkei for none who ar not
enemi come here from the land of the black kendah
kill us then i answer and bring the curs of the child upon you
bring famin bring hail bring war
these word were i think well chosen at ani rate thei induc a paus
in their murder intent for a while thei hesit all talk
togeth at onc at last the advoc of violenc appear to get the
upper hand and onc more a number of the men began to danc about us
wave their spear and cry out that we must die who came from the
black kendah
i sat down upon the ground for i wa so exhaust that at the time i
did not greatli care whether i di or live while han drew hi
knife and stood over me curs them as he had curs at jana by slow
degre thei drew nearer and nearer i watch them with a kind of
idl curios believ that the moment when thei came within actual
spearthrust would be our last but as i have said not greatli care
becaus of my mental and physic exhaust
i had alreadi close my ey that i might not see the flash of the
fall steel when an exclam from han caus me to open them
again follow the line of the knife with which he point i
perceiv a troop of men on camel emerg from the gate of the
villag at full speed in front of these hi white garment flutter
on the wind rode a beard and dignifi person in whom i recogn
hart hart himself wave a spear and shout as he came our
assail heard and saw him also then flung down their weapon as
though in dismai either at hi appear or hi word which i could
not catch hart guid hi rush camel straight at the man who i
presum wa their leader and struck at him with hi spear as though
in furi wound him in the shoulder and caus him to fall to the
ground as he struck he call out
dog would you harm the guest of the child
then i heard no more becaus i faint awai
chapter xv
the dweller in the cave
after thi it seem to me that i dream a long and veri troubl dream
concern all sort of curiou thing which i cannot rememb at last
i open my ey and observ that i lai on a low bed rais about three
inch abov the floor in an easternlook room larg and cool it
had windowplac in it but no window onli grass mat hung upon a
rod which i note inconsequ work on a rough wooden hing or
rather pin that enabl the curtain to be turn back against the wall
through on of these windowplac i saw at a littl distanc the slope
of the forestcov hill which remind me of someth to do with a
childfor the life of me i could not rememb what as i lai wonder
over the matter i heard a shuffl step which i recogn and
turn saw han twiddl a new hat made of straw in hi finger
han i said where did you get that new hat
thei gave it me here baa he answer the baa will rememb that
the devil jana at the other
then i did rememb more or less while han continu to twiddl the
hat i beg him to put it on hi head becaus it fidget me and then
inquir where we were
in the town of the child baa where thei carri you after you had
seem to die down yonder a veri nice town where there is plenti to
eat though have been asleep for three dai you have had noth
except a littl milk and soup which wa pour down your throat with a
spoon whenev you seem to half wake up for a while
i wa tire and want a long rest han and now i feel hungri tell
me ar the lord and bena here also or were thei kill after all
ye baa thei ar safe enough and so ar all our good thei were
both with hart when he save us down by the villag yonder but you
went to sleep and did not see them thei have been nurs you ever
sinc baa
just then savag himself enter carri some soup upon a wooden trai
and look almost as smart as he us to do at ragnal castl
good dai sir he said in hi best profession manner veri glad to
see you back with us sir and get well i trust especi after
we had given you and mr han up as dead
i thank him and drank the soup ask him to cook me someth more
substanti as i wa starv which he depart to do then i sent han
to find lord ragnal who it appear wa out walk in the town no
sooner had thei gone than hart enter look more dignifi than ever
and bow grave seat himself upon the mat in the eastern fashion
some strong spirit must go with you lord macumazana he said that
you should live todai after we were sure that you had been slain
that where you made a mistak your magic wa not of much servic to
you there friend hart
yet my magic as you call it though i have none wa of some servic
after all macumazana as it chanc i had no opportun of breath
in the wisdom of the child for two dai from the hour of our arriv
here becaus i wa hurt on the knee in the fight and so weari that i
could not travel up the mountain and seek light from the ey of the
child on the third dai howev i went and the oracl told me all
then i descend swiftli gather men and reach those fool in time
to keep you from harm thei have paid for what thei did lord
i am sorri hart for thei knew no better and hart although i
save myself or rather han save me we have left your brother behind
and with him the other
i know jana wa too strong for them you and your servant alon could
prevail against him
not so hart he prevail against us all we could do wa to injur
hi ey and the tip of hi trunk and escap from him
which is more than ani other have done for mani gener lord but
doubtless as the begin wa so shall the end be jana i think is
near hi death and through you
i dont know i repeat who and what is jana
have i not told you that he is an evil spirit who inhabit the bodi of
a huge eleph
ye and so did mart but i think that he is just a huge eleph with
a veri bad temper of hi own still whatev he is he will take some
kill and i dont want to meet him again by that horribl lake
then you will meet him elsewher lord for if you do not go to look
for jana jana will come to look for you who have hurt him so sore
rememb that henceforth wherev you go in all thi land it mai
happen that you will meet jana
do you mean to sai that the brute come into the territori of the white
kendah
ye macumazana at time he come or a spirit wear hi shape
come i know not which what i do know is that twice in my life i
myself have seen him upon the holi mount though how he came or how he
went none can tell
why wa he wander there hart
who can sai lord tell me why evil wander through the world and i
will answer your question onli i repeatlet those who have harm jana
bewar of jana
and let jana bewar of me if i can meet him with a decent gun in my
hand for i have a score to settl with the beast now hart there is
anoth matter just befor he wa kill mart your brother began to
tell me someth about the wife of the lord ragnal i had no time to
listen to the end of hi word though i thought he said that she wa
upon yonder holi mount did i hear aright
instantli hart face becam like that of a stone idol impenetr
impass
either you misunderstood lord he answer or my brother rave in
hi fear wherev she mai be that beauti ladi is not upon the
holi mount unless there is anoth holi mount in the land of death
moreov lord as we ar speak of thi matter let me tell you the
forest upon that mount must be trodden by none save the priest of
the child if other set foot there thei die for it is watch by a
guardian more terribl even than jana nor is he the onli on ask me
noth of that guardian for i will not answer and abov all if you
or your comrad valu life let them not seek to look upon him
understand that it wa quit useless to pursu thi subject farther
at the moment i turn to anoth remark that the hailstorm which
had smitten the countri of the black kendah wa the worst that i had
ever experienc
ye answer hart so i have learn that wa the first of the
curs which the child through my mouth promis to simba and hi
peopl if thei molest us upon our road the second you will rememb
wa famin which for them is near at hand see that thei have littl
corn in store and none left to gather and that most of their cattl ar
dead of the hail
if thei have no corn while as i note you have plenti which the storm
spare will not thei who ar mani in number but near to starv
attack you and take your corn hart
certainli thei will do so lord and then will fall the third curs
the curs of war all thi wa foreseen long ago macumazana and you
ar here to help us in that war among your good you have mani gun and
much powder and lead you shall teach our peopl how to us those gun
that with them we mai destroi the black kendah
i think not i repli quietli i came here to kill a certain
eleph and to receiv payment for my servic in ivori not to fight
the black kendah of whom i have alreadi seen enough moreov the gun
ar not my properti but that of the lord ragnal who perhap will ask
hi own price for the us of them
and the lord ragnal who came here against our will is as it
chanc our properti and we mai ask your own price for hi life now
farewel for a while sinc you who ar still sick and weak have
talk enough onli befor i go as your friend and that of those with
you i will add on word if you would continu to look upon the sun
let none of you try to set foot in the forest upon the holi mount
wander where you will upon it southern slope but strive not to pass
the wall of rock which ring the forest round
then he rose bow grave and depart leav me full of
reflect
shortli afterward savag and han return bring me some meat which
the former had cook in an admir fashion i at of it heartili and
just as thei were carri off the remain of the meal ragnal himself
arriv our greet wa veri warm as might be expect in the case of
two comrad who never thought to speak to each other again on thi side
of the grave as i had suppos he wa certain that han and i had been
cut off and kill by the black kendah as after we were miss some
of the camelmen assert that thei had actual seen us fall so he went
on or rather wa carri on by the rush of the camel griev sinc
it be imposs to attempt to recov our bodi or even to return
that wa the onli thing to do and in due cours reach the town of
the child without further accid here thei rest and mourn for
us till some dai later hart suddenli announc that we still live
though how he knew thi thei could not ascertain then thei salli
out and found us as ha been told in great danger from the ignor
villag who until we appear had not even heard of our exist
i ask what thei had done and what inform thei had obtain sinc
their arriv at thi place hi answer wa noth and none worth
mention the town appear to be a small on of not much over two
thousand inhabit all of whom were engag in agricultur pursuit
and in camelbreed the herd of camel howev thei gather for
the most part were kept at outli settlement on the farther side of
the coneshap mountain as thei were unabl to talk the languag the
onli person from whom thei could gain knowledg wa hart who spoke
to them in hi broken english and told them much what he had told me
name that the upper mountain wa a sacr place that might onli be
visit by the priest sinc ani uniniti person who set foot there
came to a bad end thei had not seen ani of these priest in the town
where no form of worship appear to be practis but thei had observ
men drive small number of sheep or goat up the flank of the
mountain toward the forest
of what went on upon thi mountain and who live there thei remain
in complet ignor it wa a case of stalem hart would not tell
them anyth nor could thei learn anyth for themselv he ad in
a depress wai that the whole busi seem veri hopeless and that
he had begun to doubt whether there wa ani tide of hi lost wife to
be gain among the kendah white or black
now i repeat to him mart dy word of which most unhappili i had
never heard the end these seem to give him new life sinc thei show
that tide there wa of some sort if onli it could be extract but
how might thi be done how how
for a whole week thing went on thu dure thi time i recov
my strength complet except in on particular which reduc me to
helpless the place on my thigh where jana had pinch out a bit of
the skin heal up well enough but the inflamm struck inward to
the nerv of my left leg where onc i had been injur by a lion with
the result that whenev i tri to move i wa tortur by pain of a
sciatic natur so i wa oblig to lie still and to content myself
with be carri on the bed into a littl garden which surround
the mudbuilt and whitewash hous that had been allot to us as a
dwellingplac
there i lai hour after hour stare at the holi mount which began
to spring from the plain within a few hundr yard of the scatter
township for a mile or so it slope were bare except for grass on
which sheep and goat were graze and a few scatter tree studi
the place through glass i observ that these slope were crown by
a vertic precipic of what look like lava rock which seem to
surround the whole mountain and must have been quit a hundr
feet high beyond thi precipic which to all appear wa of an
unclimb natur began a dens forest of larg tree cedar i
thought cloth it to the veri top that is so far as i could see
on dai when i wa consid the place hart enter the garden
suddenli and caught me in the act
the hous of the god is beauti he said is it not
veri i answer and of a strang format but how do those who
dwell on it climb that precipic
it cannot be climb he answer but there is a road which i
am about to travel who go to worship the child yet i have told you
macumazana that ani stranger who seek to walk that road find death if
thei do not believ me let them try he ad meaningli
then after mani inquiri about my health he inform me that new had
reach him to the effect that the black kendah were mad at the loss
of their crop which the hail had destroi and becaus of the near
prospect of starvat
then soon thei will be wish to reap your with spear i said
that is so therefor my lord macumazana get well quickli that you
mai be abl to scare awai these crow with gun for in fourteen dai
the harvest should begin upon our upland farewel and have no fear
for dure my absenc my peopl will feed and watch you and on the third
night i shall return again
after hart departur a deep depress fell upon all of us even
han wa depress while savag becam like a man under sentenc of
execut at a near but uncertain date i tri to cheer him up and
ask him what wa the matter
i dont know mr quatermain he answer but the fact is thi is
a at and unoli ol in hi agit he quit lost grip of hi
hs which wa alwai weak and i am sure that it is the last i shall
ever see except on
well savag i said jokingli at ani rate there dont seem to be ani
snake here
no mr quatermain that is i havent met ani but thei crawl about me
all night and whenev i see that prophet man he talk of them to me
ye he talk of them and noth els with a sort of cold look in hi
ey that make my back creep i wish it wa over i do who shall
never see old england again and he went awai i think to hide hi veri
pain and evid emot
that even han return from an expedit on which i had sent him
with instruct to try to get round the mountain and report what wa
on it other side it had been a complet failur as after he had gone
a few mile men appear who order him back thei were so threaten
in their demeanour that had it not been for the littl rifl intombi
which he carri under pretenc of shoot buck a weapon that thei
regard with great aw thei would he thought have kill him he
ad that he had been quit unsuccess in hi effort to collect
ani new of valu from man woman or child all of whom although veri
polit appear to have order to tell him noth conclud with the
remark that he consid the white kendah bigger devil than the black
kendah inasmuch as thei were more clever
shortli after thi abort attempt we debat our posit with
earnest and came to a certain conclus of which i will speak in
it place
if i rememb right it wa on thi same night of our debat after
hart return from the mountain that the first incid of interest
happen there were two room in our hous divid by a partit
which ran almost up to the roof in the lefthand room slept ragnal
and savag and in that to the right han and i just at the break of
dawn i wa awaken by hear some agit convers between savag
and hi master a minut later thei both enter my sleep place and
i saw in the faint light that ragnal look veri disturb and savag
veri frighten
what the matter i ask
we have seen my wife answer ragnal
i stare at him and he went on
savag woke me by sai that there wa someon in the room i sat up
and look and as i live quatermain stand gaze at me in such a
posit that the light of dawn from the windowplac fell upon her wa
my wife
how wa she dress i ask at onc
in a kind of white robe cut rather low with her hair loos hang to
her waist but carefulli comb and held outspread by what appear to
be a bent piec of ivori about a foot and a half long to which it wa
fasten by a thread of gold
is that all
no upon her breast wa that necklac of red stone with the littl
imag hang from it centr which those rascal gave her and she
alwai wore
anyth more
ye in her arm she carri what look like a veil child it wa so
still that i think it must have been dead
well what happen
i wa so overcom i could not speak and she stood gaze at me with
wideopen ey look more beauti than i can tell you she never
stir and her lip never movedthat i will swear and yet both of us
heard her sai veri low but quit clearli the mountain georg dont
desert me seek me on the mountain my dear my husband
well what next
i sprang up and she wa gone that all
now tell me what you saw and heard savag
what hi lordship saw and heard mr quatermain neither more nor less
except that i wa awak have had on of my bad dream about snake
and saw her come through the door
through the door wa it open then
no sir it wa shut and bolt she just came through it as if it
wasnt there then i call to hi lordship after she had been look
at him for half a minut or so for i couldnt speak at first there
on more thing or rather two on her head wa a littl cap that look
as though it had been made from the skin of a bird with a gold snake
rise up in front which snake wa the first thing i caught sight of
as of cours it would be sir also the dress she wore wa so thin that
through it i could see her shape and the sandal on her feet which were
fasten at the instep with stud of gold
i saw no feather cap or snake said ragnal
then that the oddest part of the whole busi i remark go
back to your room both of you and if you see anyth more call me i
want to think thing over
thei went in a bewild sort of fashion and i call han and spoke
with him in a whisper repeat to him the littl that he had not
understood of our talk for as i have said although he never spoke it
han knew a great deal of english
now han i said to him what is the us of you you ar no better
than a fraud you pretend to be the best watchdog in africa and yet
a woman come into thi hous under your nose and in the grei of the
morn and you do not see her where is your reput han
the old fellow grew almost speechless with indign then he
splutter hi answer
it wa not a woman baa but a spook who am i that i should be
expect to catch spook as though thei were thiev or rat as it
happen i wa wide awak half an hour befor the dawn and lai with my
ey fix upon that door which i bolt myself last night it never
open baa moreov sinc thi talk began i have been to look at it
dure the night a spider ha made it web from doorpost to doorpost
and that web is unbroken if you do not believ me come and see for
yourself yet thei sai the woman came through the doorwai and therefor
through the spider web oh baa what is the us of wast thought
upon the wai of spook which like the wind come and go as thei will
especi in thi haunt land from which as we have all agre we
should do well to get awai
i went and examin the door for myself for by now my sciatica or
whatev it mai have been wa so much better that i could walk a
littl what han said wa true there wa the spider web with the
spider sit in the middl also some of the thread of the web were
fix from post to post so that it wa imposs that the door could
have been open or if open that anyon could have pass through
the doorwai without break them therefor unless the woman came
through on of the littl windowplac which wa almost incred as
thei were high abov the ground or drop from the smokehol in the
roof or had been shut into the place when the door wa close on the
previou night i could not see how she had arriv there and if ani
on of these incred supposit wa correct then how did she get
out again with two men watch her
there were onli two solut to the problemnam that the whole
occurr wa hallucin or that in fact ragnal and savag had
seen someth unnatur and uncanni if the latter were correct i onli
wish that i had share the experi as i have alwai long to
see a ghost a real indisput ghost would be a great support to our
doubt mind that is if we knew it owner to be dead
butthi wa anoth thoughtif by ani chanc ladi ragnal were still
aliv and a prison upon that mountain what thei had seen wa no
ghost but a shadow or simulacrum of a live person project
conscious or unconsci by that person for some unknown purpos
what could the purpos be as it chanc the answer wa not difficult
and to it the word she wa report to have utter gave a cue onli a
few hour ago just befor we turn in inde as i have said we had
been discuss matter what i have not said is that in the end we
arriv at the conclus that our quest here wa wild and useless and
that we should do well to try to escap from the place befor we becam
involv in a war of extermin between two branch of an obscur
tribe on of which wa quit and the other semisavag
inde although ragnal still hung back a littl it had been arrang
that i should try to purchas camel in exchang for gun unless i
could get them for noth which might be less suspici and that we
should attempt such an escap under cover of an expedit to kill the
eleph jana
suppos such a vision to be possibl then might it not have come or
been sent to deter us from thi plan it would seem so
thu reflect i went to sleep worn out with useless wonder and
did not wake again till breakfast time that morn when we were alon
togeth ragnal said to me
i have been think over what happen or seem to happen last
night i am not at all a superstiti man or on given to vain
imagin but i am sure that savag and i realli did see and hear the
spirit or the shadow of my wife her bodi it could not have been as you
will admit though how she could utter or seem to utter audibl speech
without on is more than i can tell also i am sure that she is captiv
upon yonder mountain and came to call me to rescu her under these
circumst i feel that it is my duti as well as my desir to give
up ani idea of leav the countri and try to find out the truth
and how will you do that i ask see that no on will tell us
anyth
by go to see for myself
it is imposs ragnal i am too lame at present to walk half a
mile much less to climb precipic
i know and that is on of the reason why i did not suggest that you
should accompani me the other is that there is no object in all of
us risk our live i wish to face the thing alon but that good
fellow savag sai that he will go where i go leav you and han here
to make further attempt if we do not return our plan is to slip out
of the town dure the night wear white dress like the kendah of
which i have bought some for tobacco and make the best of our wai up
the slope by starlight that is veri bright now when dawn come we will
try to find the road through that precipic or over it and for the
rest trust to provid
dismai at thi intellig i did all i could to dissuad him from
such a mad ventur but quit without avail for never did i know a more
determin or more fearless man than lord ragnal he had made up
hi mind and there wa an end of the matter afterward i talk with
savag point out to him all the peril involv in the attempt but
likewis without avail he wa more depress than usual appar on
the ground that have seen the ghost of her ladyship he wa sure he
had not long to live still he declar that where hi master went he
would go as he prefer to die with him rather than alon
so i wa oblig to give in and with a melancholi heart to do what i
could to help in the simpl prepar for thi crazi undertak
realiz all the while that the onli real help must come from abov
sinc in such a case man wa powerless i should add that after
consult ragnal gave up the idea of adopt a kendah disguis
which wa certain to be discov also of start at night when the
town wa guard
that veri afternoon thei went go out of the town quit openli on the
pretext of shoot partridg and small buck on the lower slope of
the mountain where both were numer as hart had inform us we were
quit at liberti to do the farewel wa somewhat sad especi
with savag who gave me a letter he had written for hi old mother in
england request me to post it if ever again i came to a civil
land
i did my best to put a better spirit in him but without avail he onli
wrung my hand warmli said that it wa a pleasur to have known such a
real gentleman as myself and express a hope that i might get out of
thi hell and live to a green old ag amongst christian then he wipe
awai a tear with the cuff of hi coat touch hi hat in the orthodox
fashion and depart their outfit i should add wa veri simpl some
food in bag a flask of spirit two doublebarrel gun that would
shoot either shot or ball a bullsey lantern match and their
pistol
han walk with them a littl wai and leav them outsid the town
return
why do you look so gloomi han i ask
becaus baa he answer twiddl hi hat i had grown to be fond
of the white man bena who wa alwai veri kind to me and did not treat
me like dirt as lowborn white ar apt to do also he cook well and
now i shall have to do that work which i do not like
what do you mean han the man isnt dead is he
no baa but soon he will be for the shadow of death is in hi ey
then how about lord ragnal
i saw no shadow in hi ey i think that he will live baa
i tri to get some explan of these dark sai out of the
hottentot but he would add noth to hi word
all the follow night i lai awak fill with heavi fear which
deepen as the hour went on just befor dawn we heard a knock on
our door and ragnal voic whisper to us to open han did so while
i lit a candl of which we had a good suppli as it burn up ragnal
enter and from hi face i saw at onc that someth terribl had
happen he went to the jar where we kept our water and drank three
pannikin on after the other then without wait to be ask he
said
savag is dead and paus a while as though some aw recollect
overcam him listen he went on present we work up the
hillsid without fire although we saw plenti of partridg and on
buck till just as twilight wa close in we came to the cliff face
here we perceiv a track that ran to the mouth of a narrow cave
or tunnel in the lava rock of the precipic which look quit
unclimb while we were wonder what to do eight or ten
whiterob men appear out of the shadow and seiz us befor we
could make ani resist after talk togeth for a littl thei took
awai our gun and pistol with which some of them disappear then
their leader with mani bow indic that we were at liberti to
proce by point first to the mouth of the cave and next to the top
of the precipic sai someth about ingan which i believ
mean a littl child doe it not
i nod and he went on
after thi thei all depart down the hill smile in a fashion that
disturb me we stood for a while irresolut until it becam quit
dark i ask savag what he thought we had better do expect that he
would sai return to the town to my surpris he answer
go on of cours my lord dont let those brute sai that we white
men darent walk a step without our gun inde in ani case i mean to
go on even if your lordship wont
whilst he spoke he took a bullsey lantern from hi foodbag which
had not been interf with by the kendah and lit it i stare at him
amaz for the man seem to be anim by some tremend purpos
or rather it wa as though a forc from without had got hold of hi will
and were push him on to an unknown end inde hi next word show
that thi wa so for he exclaim
there is someth draw me into that cave my lord it mai be
death i think it is death but whatev it be go i must perhap you
would do well to stop outsid till i have seen
i step forward to catch hold of the man who i thought had gone mad
as perhap wa the case befor i could lai my hand on him he had
run rapidli to the mouth of the cave of cours i follow but when i
reach it entranc the star of light thrown forward by the bullsey
lantern show me that he wa alreadi about eight yard down the tunnel
then i heard a terribl hiss nois and savag exclaim oh my
god twice over as he spoke the lantern fell from hi hand but did
not go out becaus as you know it is made to burn in ani posit
i leapt forward and pick it from the ground and while i wa do so
becam awar that savag wa run still farther into the depth of
the cave i lift the lantern abov my head and look
thi wa what i saw about ten pace from me wa savag with hi arm
outstretch and dancingy dancingfirst to the right and then to
the left with a kind of horribl grace and to the tune of a hideou
hiss music i held the lantern higher and perceiv that beyond him
lift eight or nine feet into the air nearli to the roof of the tunnel
in fact wa the head of the hugest snake of which i have ever heard it
wa as broad as the bottom of a wheelbarrowwer it cut off i think
it would fill a larg wheelbarrowwhil the neck upon which it wa
support wa quit as thick as my middl and the undul bodi
behind it which stretch far awai into the dark wa the size of
an eighteengallon cask and glitter green and grei line and splash
with silver and with gold
it hiss and swai it great head to the right hold savag with
cold ey that yet seem to be on fire whereon he danc to the right
it hiss again and swai it head to the left whereon he danc to
the left then suddenli it rear it head right to the top of the cave
and so remain for a few second whereon savag stood still bend
a littl forward as though he were bow to the reptil next instant
like a flash it struck for i saw it white fang buri themselv in
the back of savag who with a kind of sigh fell forward on to hi face
then there wa a convuls of those shine fold follow by a sound
as of bone be ground up in a steamdriven mortar
i stagger against the wall of the cave and shut my ey for a moment
for i felt faint when i open them again it wa to see someth flat
misshapen elong like a reflect in a spoon someth that had
been savag ly on the floor and stretch out over it the huge
serpent studi me with it steeli ey then i ran i am not asham
to sai i ran out of that horribl hole and far into the night
small blame to you i said ad han give me some squarefac
neat for i felt as queer as though i also had been in that cave with
it guardian

the holland i lost my wai on the mountainsid and wander for mani
hour till at last i blunder up against on of the outermost hous
of the town after which thing were easi perhap i should add that

and rub my leg with the stuff to find that next morn all pain
had left me and that except for some local weak i wa practic
quit well i kept the rest of the salv for year and it prove a
perfect specif in case of sciatica and rheumat now ala it is
all us and no recip is avail from which it can be made up again
the next few dai pass uneventfulli as soon as i could walk i began
to go about the town which wa noth but a scatter villag much
resembl those to be seen on the eastern coast of africa nearli
all the men seem to be awai make prepar for the harvest i
suppos and as the women shut themselv up in their hous after the
orient fashion though the few that i saw about were unveil and
rather goodlook i did not gather ani intellig worth note
to tell the truth i cannot rememb be in a more uninterest place
than thi littl town with it extrem uncommun popul
which it seem to me live under a shadow of fear that prevent all
gaieti even the children of whom there were not mani crept about in
a depress fashion and talk in a low voic i never saw ani of them
plai game or heard them shout and laugh as young peopl do
in most part of the world for the rest we were veri well look after
plenti of food wa provid for us and everi thought taken for our
comfort thu a strong and quiet poni wa brought for me to ride becaus
of my lame i had onli to go out of the hous and call and it
arriv from somewher all readi saddl and bridl in charg of a
lad who appear to be dumb at ani rate when i spoke to him he would
not answer
mount on thi poni i took on or two ride along the southern slope
of the mountain on the old pretext of shoot for the pot han
accompani me on these occas but wa i note veri silent and
thought as though he were hunt someth up and down hi tortuou
intellig onc we got quit near to the mouth of the cave or tunnel
where poor savag had met hi horrid end as we stood studi it a
whiterob man whose head wa shave which made me think he must be
a priest came up and ask me mockingli why we did not go through the
tunnel and see what lai beyond ad almost in the word of hart
himself that none would attempt to interfer with us as the road wa
open to ani who could travel it by wai of answer i onli smile and
put him a few question about a veri beauti breed of goat with long
silki hair some of which he seem to be engag in herd he repli
that these goat were sacr be the food of on who dwelt in the
mountain who onli at when the moon chang
when i inquir who thi person wa he said with hi unpleas
smile that i had better go through the tunnel and see for myself an
invit which i did not accept
that even hart appear unexpectedli look veri grave and
troubl he wa in a great hurri and onli stai long enough to
congratul me upon the excel effect of hi ointment sinc no
man could fight jana on on leg
i ask him when the fight with jana wa to come off he repli
lord i go up to the mountain to attend the feast of the firstfruit
which is held at sunris on the dai of the new moon after the offer
the oracl will speak and we shall learn when there will be war with
jana and perchanc other thing
mai we not attend thi feast hart who ar weari of do noth
here
certainli he answer with hi grave bow that is if you come
unarm for to appear befor the child with arm is death you know the
road it run through yonder cave and the forest beyond the cave take
it when you will lord
then if we can pass the cave we shall be welcom at the feast
you will be veri welcom none shall hurt you there go or
return i swear it by the child oh macumazana he ad smile
a littl why do you talk folli who know well that on live in yonder
cave whom none mai look upon and love as bena learn not long ago you
ar think that perhap you might kill thi dweller in the cave with
your weapon put awai that dream see that henceforth those who
watch you have order to see that none of you leav thi hous carri
so much as a knife inde unless you promis me that thi shall be so
you will not be suffer to set foot outsid it garden until i return
again now do you promis
i thought a while and draw the two other asid out of hear
ask them their opinion
ragnal wa at first unwil to give ani such promis but han said
baa it is better to go free and unhurt without gun and knive than
to becom a prison onc as you were among the black kendah often
there is but a short step between the prison and the grave
both ragnal and i acknowledg the forc of thi argument and in the
end we gave the promis speak on by on
it is enough said hart moreov know lord that among us white
kendah he who break an oath is put across the river tava unarm to
make report thereof to jana father of li now farewel if we do
not meet at the feast of the firstfruit on the dai of the new moon
whither onc more i invit you we can talk togeth here after i have
heard the voic of the oracl
then he mount a camel which await him outsid the gate and depart
with an escort of twelv men also ride camel
there is some other road up that mountain quatermain said ragnal
a camel could sooner pass through the ey of a needl than through that
dread cave even if it were empti
probabl i answer but as we dont know where it is and i dare sai
it li mile from here we need not troubl our head on the matter
the cave is our onli road which mean that there is no road
that even at supper we discov that han wa miss also that he
had got possess of my kei and broken into a box contain liquor
for there it stood open in the cookinghut with the kei in the lock
he ha gone on the drink i said to ragnal and upon my soul i dont
wonder at it for sixpenc i would follow hi exampl
then we went to bed next morn we breakfast rather late sinc when
on ha noth to do there is no object in get up earli as i wa
prepar to go to the cookhous to boil some egg to our astonish
han appear with a kettl of coffe
han i said you ar a thief
ye baa answer han
you have been at the gin box and take that poison
ye baa i have been take poison also i took a walk and all is
right now the baa must not be angri for it is veri dull do noth
here will the baas eat porridg as well as egg
as it wa no us scold him i said that we would moreov there wa
someth about hi manner which made me suspici for realli he did
not look like a person who ha just been veri drunk
after we had finish breakfast he came and squat down befor me
have lit hi pipe he ask suddenli
would the baas like to walk through that cave tonight if so there
will be no troubl
what do you mean i ask suspect that he wa still drunk
i mean baa that the dwellerinthecav is fast asleep
how do you know that han
becaus i am the nurs who put him to sleep baa though he kick
and cri a great deal he is asleep he will wake no more baa i have
kill the father of serpent
han i said now i am sure that you ar still drunk although you do
not show it outsid
han ad ragnal to whom i had translat as much of thi as he
did not understand it is too earli in the dai to tell good stori
how could you possibl have kill that serpent without a gunfor you
took none with youor with it either for that matter
will the baas come and take a walk through the cave ask han with
a snigger
not till i am quit sure that you ar sober i repli then
rememb certain other event in thi worthi career ad han
if you do not tell us the stori at onc i will beat you
there isnt much stori baa repli han between long suck at hi
pipe which had nearli gone out becaus the thing wa so easi the
baa is veri clever and so is the lord baa why then can thei never
see the stone that lie under their nose it is becaus their ey ar
alwai fix upon the mountain between thi world and the next but
the poor hottentot who look at the ground to be sure that he doe not
stumbl ah he see the stone now baa did you not hear that man
in a night shirt with hi head shave sai that those goat were food for
on who dwelt in the mountain
i did what of it han
who would be the on who dwelt in the mountain except the father of
snake in the cave baa ah now for the first time you see the stone
that lai at your feet all the while and baa did not the bald man add
that thi on in the mountain wa onli fed at new and full moon and is
not tomorrow the dai of new moon and therefor would he not be veri
hungri on the dai befor new moon that is last night
no doubt han but how can you kill a snake by feed it
oh baa you mai eat thing that make you ill and so can a snake now
you will guess the rest so i had better go to wash the dish
whether i guess or do not guess i repli sage the latter be
the right hypothesi the dish can wait han sinc the lord there
ha not guess so continu
veri well baa in on of those box ar some pound of stuff which
when mix with water is us for preserv skin and skull
you mean the arsen crystal i said with a flash of inspir
i dont know what you call them baa at first i thought thei were
hard sugar and stole some onc when the real sugar wa left behind to
put into the coffeewithout tell the baa becaus it wa my fault
that the sugar wa left behind
great heaven i ejacul then why arent we all dead
becaus at the last moment baa i thought i would make sure so i put
some of the hard sugar into hot milk and when it had melt i gave it
to that yellow dog which onc bit me in the leg the on that came from
bezatown baa that i told you had run awai he wa a veri greedi dog
baa and drank up the milk at onc then he gave a howl twist about
foam at the mouth and di and i buri him at onc after that i
threw some more of the larg sugar mix with meali to the fowl that
we brought with us for cook two cock and a hen swallow them
by mistak for the corn present thei fell on their back kick a
littl and di some of the mazitu who were great thiev stole those
dead fowl baa after thi baa i thought it best not to us that
sugar in the coffe and later on bena told me that it wa deadli
poison well baa it came into my mind that if i could make that great
snake swallow enough of thi poison he too might die
so i stole your kei as i often do baa when i want anyth
becaus you leav them ly about everywher and to deceiv you first
open on of the box that ar full of squarefac and brandi and left
it open for i wish you to think that i had just gone to get drunk
like anybodi els then i open anoth box and got out two onepound
tin of the sugar which kill dog and fowl half a pound of it i
melt in boil water with some real sugar to make the stuff sweet
and put it into a bottl the rest i ti with string in twelv littl
packet in the soft paper which is in on of the box and put them in
my pocket then i went up the hill baa to the place where i saw those
goat ar kraal at night behind a reed fenc as i had hope no on
wa watch them becaus there ar no tiger so near thi town and
man doe not steal the goat that ar sacr i went into the kraal and
found a fat young ew which had a kid i drag it out and take it
behind some stone i made it leg fast with a bit of cord and pour
thi stuff out of the bottl all over it skin rub it in well
then i ti the twelv packet of hard poisonsugar everywher about it
bodi make them veri fast deep in the long hair so that thei could not
tumbl or rub off
after thi i unti the goat led it near to the mouth of the cave and
held it there for a time while it kept on bleat for it kid next i
took it almost up to the cave wonder how i should drive it in for i
did not wish to enter there myself baa as it happen i need not have
troubl about that when the goat wa within five yard of the cave it
stop bleat stood still and shiver then it began to go forward
with littl jump as though it did not want to go yet must do so
also baa i felt as though i wish to go with it so i lai down and
put my heel against a rock leav go of the goat
for now baa i did not care where that goat went so long as i could
keep out of the hole where dwelt the father of serpent that had eaten
bena but it wa all right baa the goat knew what it had to do and
did it jump straight into the cave as it enter it turn it head
and look at me i could see it ey in the starlight and baa thei
were dread i think it knew what wa come and did not like it at
all and yet it had to walk on becaus it could not help it just like a
man go to the devil baa
hold on to the stone i peer after it for i had heard someth
stir in the cave make a soft nois like a white ladi dress upon
the floor there in the black i saw two littl spark of fire which
were the ey of the serpent baa then i heard a sound of hiss like
four big kettl boil all at onc and a littl bleat from the goat
after thi there wa a nois as of men wrestl follow by anoth
nois as of bone break and lastli yet anoth suck nois as of
a pump that wont draw up the water then everyth grew nice and quiet
and i went some wai off sat down a littl to on side of the cave and
wait to see if anyth happen
it must have been nearli an hour later that someth did begin to
happen baa it wa as though sack fill with chaff were be beaten
against stone wall there in the cave ah thought i to myself your
stomach is begin to ach eaterupofbena and as that goat had
littl horn on it headto which i ti two of the bag of the poison
baasand like all snake no doubt you have spike in your throat
point downward you wont be abl to get it up again theni
expect thi wa after the poisonsugar had begun to melt nice in the
serpent stomach baasther wa a nois as though a whole compani of
girl were danc a wardanc in the cave to a music of hiss
and thenoh then baa of a sudden that father of serpent came out
i tell you baa that when i saw him in the bright starlight my hair
stood up upon my head for never ha there been such anoth snake in
the whole world those that live in tree and eat buck in zululand of
whose skin men make waistcoat and slipper ar but babi compar
to thi on he came out yard after yard of him he wriggl about he
stood upon hi tail with hi head where the top of a tree might be he
made himself into a ring he bit at stone and at hi own stomach while
i hid behind my rock prai to your reverend father that he might not
see me then at last he rush awai down the hill faster than ani hors
could gallop
now i hope that he had gone for good and thought of go myself
still i fear to do so lest i should meet him somewher so i made up
my mind to wait till daylight it wa as well baa for about half an
hour later he came back again onli now he could not jump he could onli
crawl never in my life did i see a snake look so sick baa into the
cave he went and lai there hiss by degre the hiss grew veri
faint till at length thei di awai altogeth i wait anoth
halfhour baa and then i grew so curiou that i thought that i would
go to look in the cave
i lit the littl lantern i had with me and hold it in on hand and
my stick in the other i crept into the hole befor i had crawl ten
pace i saw someth white stretch along the ground it wa the belli
of the great snake baa which lai upon it back quit dead
i know that it wa dead for i lit three wax match set them to
burn upon it tail and it never stir as ani live snake will do when
it feel fire then i came home baa feel veri proud becaus i
had outwit that greatgrandfath of all snake who kill bena my
friend and had made the wai clear for us to walk through the cave
that is all the stori baa now i must go to wash those dish and
without wait for ani comment off he went leav us marvel at
hi wit resourc and courag
what next i ask present
noth till tonight answer ragnal with determin when i am
go to look at the snake which the nobl han ha kill and whatev
li beyond the cave as you will rememb hart invit us to do
unmolest if we could
do you think hart will keep hi word ragnal
on the whole ye and if he doesnt i dont care anyth is better
than sit here in thi suspens
i agre as to hart becaus we ar too valuabl to be kill just now
if for no other reason also as to the suspens which is unendur
therefor i will walk with you to look at that snake ragnal and so no
doubt will han the exercis will do my leg good
do you think it wise he ask doubtfulli in your case i mean
i think it most unwis that we should separ ani more we had better
stand or fall altogeth further we do not seem to have ani luck
apart

enigmat as we depart rejoic for now we had learn that the
kendah did not yet know of the death of the serpent
an hour walk up the hill guid by han brought us to the mouth of
the tunnel to tell the truth i could have wish it had been longer
for as we drew near all sort of doubt assail me what if han realli
had been drink and invent thi stori to account for hi absenc
what if the snake had recov from a mere temporari indisposit
what if it had a wife and famili live in that cave everi on of them
thirst for vengeanc
well it wa too late to hesit now but secretli i hope that on
of the other would prefer to lead the wai we reach the place and
listen it wa silent as a tomb then that brave fellow han lit the
lantern and said
do you stop here baas while i go to look if you hear anyth
happen to me you will have time to run awai word that made me feel
somewhat asham of myself
howev know that he wa quick as a weasel and silent as a cat
we let him go a minut or two later suddenli he reappear out of the
dark for he had turn the metal shield over the bullsey of the
lantern and even in that light i could see that he wa grin
it is all right baa he said the father of serpent ha realli
gone to that land whither he sent bena where no doubt he is now
roast in the fire of hell and i dont see ani other come and look
at him
so in we went and there true enough upon the floor of the cave lai the
huge reptil stone dead and alreadi much swollen i dont know how long
it wa for part of it bodi wa twist into coil so i will onli sai
that it wa by far the most enorm snake that i have ever seen it is
true that i have heard of such reptil in differ part of
africa but hitherto i had alwai put them down as fabul creatur
transform into and worship as local god also thi particular
specimen wa i presum of a new varieti sinc accord to ragnal
it both struck like the cobra or the adder and crush like the
boaconstrictor it is possibl howev that he wa mistaken on thi
point i do not know sinc i had no time or inde inclin to
examin it head for the poison fang and when next i pass that wai
it wa gone
i shall never forget the stench of that cave it wa horribl which is
not to be wonder at see that probabl thi creatur had dwelt there
for centuri sinc these larg snake ar said to be as long live as
tortois and be sacr of cours it had never lack for food
everywher lai pile of cast bone amongst on of which i notic
fragment of a human skull perhap that of poor savag also the
project rock in the place were cover with great piec of snake
skin doubtless rub off by the reptil when onc a year it chang
it coat
for a while we gaze at the loathsom and still glitter creatur
then push on fear lest we should stumbl upon more of it kind
i suppos that it must have been solitari a kind of serpent rogu
as jana wa an eleph rogu for we met none and if the inform
which i obtain afterward mai be believ there wa no speci at
all resembl it in the countri what it origin mai have been i never
learn all the kendah could or would sai about it wa that it had
live in thi hole from the begin and that black kendah prison
or malefactor were sometim given to it to kill as white kendah
prison were given to jana
the cave itself prove to be not veri long perhap on hundr and
fifti feet no more it wa not an artifici but a natur hollow in
the lava rock which i suppos had onc been blown through it by an
outburst of steam toward the farther end it narrow so much that i
began to fear there might be no exit in thi i wa mistaken howev
for at it termin we found a hole just larg enough for a man to
walk in upright and so difficult to climb through that it becam clear
to us that certainli thi wa not the path by which the white kendah
approach their sanctuari
scrambl out of thi apertur with thank we found ourselv
upon the slope of a kind of huge ditch of lava which ran first downward
for about eighti pace then up again to the base of the great cone of
the inner mountain which wa cover with dens forest
i presum that the whole format of thi peculiar hill wa the result
of a violent volcan action in the earli ag of the earth but as i do
not understand such matter i will not dilat upon them further than to
sai that although compar small it bore a certain resembl
to other extinct volcano which i had met with in differ part of
africa
we climb down to the bottom of the ditch that from it gener
appear might have been dug out by some giant race as a protect to
their stronghold and up it farther side to where the forest began on
deep and fertil soil why there should have been rich earth here and
none in the ditch is more than we could guess but perhap the presenc
of spring of water in thi part of the mount mai have been a caus at
ani rate it wa so
the tree in thi forest were huge and of a varieti of cedar but did
not grow close togeth also there wa practic no undergrowth
perhap for the reason that their dens spread top shut out the
light as i saw afterward both trunk and bough were cloth with
long grei moss which even at middai gave the place a veri ghostli
appear the dark beneath those tree wa intens liter we
could not see an inch befor our face yet rather than stand still we
struggl on han lead the wai for hi instinct were quicker than
our the steep rise of the ground beneath our feet told us that we were
go uphil as we wish to do and from time to time i consult a
pocket compass i carri by the light of a match know from previou
observ that the top of the holi mount lai due north
thu for hour after hour we crept up and on occasion but into
the trunk of a tree or stumbl over a fallen bough but meet with
no other adventur or obstacl of a physic kind of moral or rather
mental obstacl there were mani sinc to all of us the atmospher
of thi forest wa as that of a haunt hous it mai have been the
embrac dark or the sough of the night wind amongst the bough
and moss or the sens of the immin danger that we had pass and
that still await us or it mai have been unknown horror connect
with thi place of which some spiritu essenc still surviv for
without doubt local preserv such influenc which can be felt by
the sensit among live thing especi in favour condit of
fear and gloom at ani rate i never experienc more subtl and yet more
penetr terror than i did upon that night and afterward ragnal
confess to me that my case wa hi own black as it wa i thought that
i saw apparit among them glare ey and that of the eleph
jana stand in front of me with hi trunk rais against the bole of a
cedar i could have sworn that i saw him nor wa i reassur when han
whisper to me below hi breath for here we did not seem to dare to
rais our voic
look baa is it jana glow like hot iron who stand yonder
dont be a fool i answer how can jana be here and if he were
here how could we see him in the night but as i said the word i
rememb hart had told us that jana had been met with on the holi
mount in the spirit or in the flesh howev thi mai be next instant
he wa gone and we beheld him or hi shadow no more also we thought
that from time to time we heard voic speak all around us now here
now there and now in the tree top abov our head though what thei
said we could not catch or understand
thu the long night wore awai our progress wa veri slow but guid by
occasion glimps at the compass we never stop but twice onc
when we found ourselv appar surround by tree bole and fallen
bough and onc when we got into swampi ground then we took the risk
of light the lantern and by it aid pick our wai through these
difficult place by degre the tree grew fewer so that we could see
the star between their top thi wa a help to us as i knew that on
of them which i had carefulli note shone at thi season of the year
directli over the cone of the mountain and we were enabl to steer
therebi
it must have been not more than half an hour befor the dawn that han
who wa leadingw were push our wai through thick bush at the
timehalt hurriedli sai
stop baa we ar on the edg of a cliff when i thrust my stick
forward it stand on noth
needless to sai we pull up dead and so remain without stir
an inch for who could sai what might be beyond us ragnal wish to
examin the ground with the lantern i wa about to consent though
doubtfulli when suddenli i heard voic murmur and through the
screen of bush saw light move at a littl distanc forti feet or
more below us then we gave up all idea of make further us of the
lantern and crouch still as mice in our bush wait for the dawn
it came at last in the east appear a faint pearli flush that by
degre spread itself over the whole arch of the sky and wa welcom
by the bark of monkei and the call of bird in the depth of the
dewsteep forest next a rai from the unrisen sun a singl spear
of light shot suddenli across the sky and as it appear from the
dark below us aros a sound of chant veri low and sweet to hear
it di awai and for a littl while there wa silenc broken onli by
a rustl sound like to that of peopl take their seat in a dark
theatr then a woman began to sing in a beauti contralto voic
but in what languag i do not know for i could not catch the word if
these were word and not onli music note
i felt ragnal trembl besid me and in a whisper ask him what wa
the matter he answer also in a whisper
i believ that is my wife voic
if so i beg you to control yourself i repli
now the ski began to flame and the light to pour itself into a misti
hollow beneath us like stream of manycolour gem into a bowl
drive awai the shadow by degre these vanish by degre we saw
everyth beneath us wa an amphitheatr on the southern wall of
which we were seat though it wa not a wall but a lava cliff between
forti and fifti feet high which serv as a wall the amphitheatr
itself howev almost exactli resembl those of the ancient which
i had seen in pictur and ragnal had visit in itali greec and
southern franc it wa oval in shape and not veri larg perhap the
flat space at the bottom mai have cover someth over an acr but
all round thi oval ran tier of seat cut in the lava of the crater
for without doubt thi wa the crater of an extinct volcano
moreov in what i will call the arena stood a templ that in it main
outlin although small exactli resembl those still to be seen in
egypt there wa the gatewai or pylon there the open outer court with
column round it support roof cloister which as we ascertain
afterward were us as dwellingplac by the priest there beyond
and connect with the first by a short passag wa a second rather
smaller court also open to the sky and beyond thi again built like
all the rest of the templ of lava block a roof erect measur
about twelv feet squar which i guess at onc must be the sanctuari
thi templ wa as i have said small but extrem well proport
everi detail of it be in the most excel tast though unorna
by sculptur or paint i have to add that in front of the sanctuari
door stood a larg block of lava which i conclud wa an altar and in
front of thi a stone seat and a basin also of stone support upon a
veri low tripod further behind the sanctuari wa a squar hous with
windowplac
at the moment of our first sight of thi place the court were empti
but on the bench of the amphitheatr were seat about three hundr
person male and femal the men to the north and the women to the
south thei were all clad in pure white robe the head of the men
be shave and those of the women veil but leav the face
expos lastli there were two roadwai into the amphitheatr on
run east and on west through tunnel hollow in the encircl
rock of the crater both of which road were close at the mouth of the
tunnel by massiv wooden doubl door seventeen or eighteen feet
in height from these roadwai and their door we learn two thing
first that the cave where had live the father of serpent wa as i
had suspect not the real approach to the shrine of the child but
onli a blind and secondli that the ceremoni we were about to wit
wa secret and might onli be attend by the priestli class or famili
of thi strang tribe
scarc wa it full daylight when from the cell of the cloister
round the outer court issu twelv priest head by hart himself who
look veri dignifi in hi white garment each of whom carri on a
wooden platter ear of differ kind of corn then from the cell of
the southern cloister issu twelv women or rather girl for all were
young and veri come who rang themselv alongsid of the men these
also carri wooden platter and on them bloom flower
at a sign thei struck up a religi chant and began to walk forward
through the passag that led from the first court to the second
arriv in front of the altar thei halt and on by on first a
priest and then a priestess set down the platter of offer pile
them abov each other into a cone next the priest and the priestess
rang themselv in line on either side of the altar and hart took
a platter of corn and a platter of flower in hi hand these he held
first toward that quarter of the sky in which swam the invis new
moon secondli toward the rise sun and thirdli toward the door of
the sanctuari make genuflexion and utter some chant prayer the
word of which we could not hear
a paus follow that wa succeed by a sudden outburst of song
wherein all the audienc took part it wa a veri sonor and beauti
song or hymn in some languag which i did not understand divid into
four vers the end of each vers be mark by the bow of everi
on of those mani singer toward the east toward the west and
final toward the altar
anoth paus till suddenli the door of the sanctuari were thrown wide
and from between them issuedth goddess isi of the egyptian as i
have seen her in pictur she wa wrap in close cling draperi
of materi so thin that the white of her bodi could be seen
beneath her hair wa outspread befor her and she wore a headdress
or bonnet of glitter feather from the front of which rose a littl
golden snake in her arm she bore what at that distanc seem to be
a nake child with her came two women walk a littl behind her
and support her arm who also wore feather bonnet but without the
golden snake and were clad in tightfit transpar garment
my god whisper ragnal it is my wife
then be silent and thank him that she is aliv and well i answer
the goddess isi or the english ladyin that excit i did not
reck whichstood still while the priest and priestess and all the
audienc who gather on the upper bench of the amphitheatr could
see her abov the wall of the inner court rais a thricerep and
triumphant cry of welcom then hart and the first priestess lift
respect an ear of corn and a flower from the two topmost platter
and held these first to the lip of the child in her arm and secondli
to her lip
thi ceremoni conclud the two attend women led her round the altar
to the stone chair upon which she seat herself next fire wa kindl
in the bowl on the tripod in front of the chair how i could not see
but perhap it wa alreadi smoulder there at ani rate it burnt up
in a thin blue flame on to which hart and the head priestess threw
someth that caus the flame to turn to smoke then isi for i
prefer to call her so while describ thi ceremoni wa caus to bend
her head forward so that it wa envelop in the smoke exactli as she
and i had done some year befor in the drawingroom at ragnal castl
present the smoke di awai and the two attend with the feather
headdress straighten her in the chair where she sat still hold
the babe against her breast as she might have done to nurs it but with
her head bent forward like that of a person in a swoon
now hart step forward and appear to speak to the goddess at some
length then fell back again and wait till in the midst of an intens
silenc she rose from her seat and fix her wide ey on the heaven
spoke in her turn for although we heard noth of what she said in
that clear morn light we could see her lip move for some minut
she spoke then sat down again upon the chair and remain motionless
stare straight in front of her hart advanc again thi time to
the front of the altar and take hi stand upon a kind of stone step
address the priest and priestess and all the encircl audienc in
a voic so loud and clear that i could distinguish and understand everi
word he said
the guardian of the heavenli child the nurs decre the appoint
nurtur she who is the shadow of her that bore the child she who in
her dai bear the symbol of the child and is consecr to it servic
from of old she whose heart is fill with the wisdom of the child and
who utter the decre of heaven ha spoken hearken now to the voic
of the oracl utter in answer to the question of me hart the head
priest of the etern child dure my lifedai thu sai the oracl
the guardian the nurtur mark like all who went befor her with
the holi mark of the new moon she on whom the spirit flit from
gener to gener ha alight for a while o peopl of the
white kendah worshipp of the child in thi land and descend of
those who for thousand of year worship the child in a more
ancient land until the barbarian drove it thenc with the remnant that
remain war is upon you o peopl of the white kendah jana the evil
on he whose other name is set he whose other name is satan he who
for thi while live in the shape of an eleph he who is worship
by the thousand whom onc you conquer and whom still you bridl by
my might come up against you the dark war against the daylight
the evil war against the good my curs ha fallen upon the peopl of
jana my hail ha smitten them their corn and their cattl thei have
no food to eat but thei ar still strong for war and there is food in
your land thei come to take your corn jana come to trampl your god
the evil come to destroi the good the night to devour the dai it is
the last of mani battl how shall you conquer o peopl of the child
not by your own strength for you ar few in number and jana is veri
strong not by the strength of the child for the child grow weak and
old the dai of it dominion ar almost done and it worship is almost
outworn here alon that worship linger but new god who ar still
the old god press on to take it place and to lead it to it rest
how then shall you conquer that when the child ha depart to it own
place a remnant of you mai still remain in on wai onlyso sai
the guardian the nurtur of the child speak with the voic of the
child by the help of those whom you have summon to your aid from far
there were four of them but on you have suffer to be slain in
the maw of the watcher in the cave it wa an evil deed o son and
daughter of the child for as the watcher is now dead so er long
mani of you who plan thi deed must die who had it not been for that
man blood would have live on a while why did you do thi thing
that you might keep a secret the secret of the theft of a woman that
you might continu to act a lie which fall upon your head like a stone
from heaven
thu saith the child lift no hand against the three who remain and
what thei shall ask that give for thu alon shall some of you be
save from jana and those who serv him even though the guardian and
the child be taken awai and the child itself return to it own
place these ar the word of the oracl utter at the feast of the
firstfruit the word that cannot be chang and mayhap it last
hart ceas and there wa silenc while thi portent messag sank
into the mind of hi audienc at length thei seem to understand it
omin natur and from them all there aros a univers simultan
groan as it di awai the two attend dress as goddess assist
the personif of the ladi isi to rise from her seat and open
the robe upon her breast point to someth beneath her throat
doubtless that birthmark shape like the new moon which made her so
sacr in their ey sinc she who bore it and she alon could fill her
holi offic
all the audienc and with them the priest and priestess bow befor
her she lift the symbol of the child hold it high abov her head
whereon onc more thei bow with the deepest vener then still
hold the effigi aloft she turn and with her two attend pass
into the sanctuari and doubtless thenc by a cover wai into the hous
beyond at ani rate we saw her no more
as soon as she wa gone the congreg if i mai call it so leav
their seat swarm down into the outer court of the templ through
it eastern gate which wa now open here the priest proceed to
distribut among them the offer taken from the altar give a grain
of corn to each of the men to eat and a flower to each of the women
which flower she kiss and hid in the bosom of her robe evid it
wa a kind of sacrament
ragnal lift himself a littl upon hi hand and knee and i saw that
hi ey glow and hi face wa veri pale
what ar you go to do i ask
demand that those peopl give me back my wife whom thei have stolen
dont try to stop me quatermain i mean what i sai
but but i stammer thei never will and we ar but three unarm
men
han lift up hi littl yellow face between us
baa he hiss i have a thought the lord baa wish to get the
ladi dress like a bird as to her head and like on for burial as to
her bodi who is he sai hi wife but for us to take her from among
so mani is imposs now what did that old witchdoctor hart declar
just now he declar speak for hi fetish that by our help alon
the white kendah can resist the host of the black kendah and that no
harm must be done to us if the white kendah would continu to live so
it seem baa that we have someth to sell which the white kendah
must bui name our help against the black kendah for if we will not
fight for them thei believ that thei cannot conquer their enemi and
kill the devil jana well now suppos that the baa sai that our
price is the white woman dress like a bird to be deliv over to us
when we have defeat the black kendah and kill janaaft which thei
will have no more us for her and suppos that the baa sai that if
thei refus to pai that price we will burn all our powder and cartridg
so that the rifl ar no us is there not a path to walk on here
perhap i answer someth of the sort wa work in my mind but
i had no time to think it out
turn i explain the idea to ragnal ad
i prai you not to be rash if you ar not onli mai we be kill which
doe not so much matter but it is veri probabl that even if thei spare
us thei will put an end to your wife rather than suffer on whom thei
look upon as holi and who is necessari to their faith in it last
struggl to be separ from her charg of the child
thi wa a fortun argument of mine and on which went home
to lose her now would be more than i could bear he mutter
then will you promis to let me try to manag thi affair and not to
interfer with me and show violenc
he hesit a moment and answer
ye i promis for you two ar clever than i am andi cannot trust
my judgment
good i said assum an air of confid which i did not feel now
we will go down to call upon hart and hi friend i want to have a
closer look at that templ
so behind our screen of bush we wriggl back a littl distanc till
we knew that the slope of the ground would hide us when we stood up
then as quickli as we could we made our wai eastward for someth over
a quarter of a mile and after thi turn to the north as i expect
beyond the ring of the crater we found ourselv on the rise
treeclad bosom of the mountain and thread our path through the
cedar came present to that track or roadwai which led to the eastern
gate of the amphitheatr thi road we follow unseen until present
the gatewai appear befor us we walk through it without attract
ani attent perhap becaus all the peopl were either talk
togeth or prai or perhap becaus like themselv we were wrap
in white robe at the mouth of the tunnel we stop and i call out
in a loud voic
the white lord and their servant have come to visit hart as he
invit them to do bring us we prai you into the presenc of hart
everyon wheel round and stare at us stand there in the shadow of
the gatewai tunnel for the sun behind us wa still low my word how
thei did stare a voic cri
kill them kill these stranger who desecr our templ
what i answer would you kill those to whom your highpriest ha
given safeconduct those moreov by whose help alon as your oracl
ha just declar you can hope to slai jana and destroi hi host
how do thei know that shout anoth voic thei ar magician
ye i remark all magic doe not dwell in the heart of the white
kendah if you doubt it go to look at the watcher in the cave whom your
oracl told you is dead you will find that it did not lie
as i spoke a man rush through the gate hi white rob stream on
the wind shout as he emerg from the tunnel
o priest and priestess of the child the ancient serpent is dead i
whose offic it is to feed the serpent on the dai of the new moon have
found him dead in hi hous
you hear i interpol calmli the father of snake is dead if you
want to know how i will tell you we look on it and it di
thei might have answer that poor savag also look on it with the
result that he di but luckili it did not occur to them to do so
on the contrari thei just stood still and stare at us like a flock of
startl sheep
present the sheep part and the shepherd in the shape of hart
appear look i reflect the veri pictur of abraham soften by
a touch of the melancholia of job that is as i have alwai imagin
those patriarch he bow to us with hi usual orient courtesi and
we bow back to him han bow i mai explain wa of the most peculiar
natur more like a skulpat as the boer call a landtortois
draw it wrinkl head into it shell and put it out again than
anyth els then hart remark in hi peculiar english which i
suppos the white kendah took for some tongu known onli to magician
so you get here eh why you get here how the devil you get here eh
we got here becaus you ask us to do so if we could i answer
and we thought it rude not to accept your invit for the rest we
came through a cave where you kept a tame snake an uglylook reptil
but veri harmless to those who know how to deal with snake and ar not
afraid of them as poor bena wa if you can spare the skin i should like
to have it to make myself a robe

then he issu some order as a result of which a guard form itself
about us and conduct us through the crowd and along the passag to the
second court of the templ which wa now empti here the guard left us
but remain at the mouth of the passag keep watch present women
brought us food and drink of which han and i partook heartili though
ragnal who wa so near to hi lost wife and yet so far awai could eat
but littl mingl joi becaus after these month of arduou search he
found her yet aliv and fear lest she should again be taken from him
for ever depriv him of all appetit
while we at priest to the number of about a dozen who i suppos had
been summon by hart were admit by the guard and gather out of
earshot of us between the altar and the sanctuari enter on an earnest
discuss with him watch their face i could see that there wa a
strong differ of opinion between them about half take on view
on the matter of which thei disput and half anoth at length hart
made some proposit to which thei all agre then the door of the
sanctuari wa open with a strang sort of kei which on of the priest
produc show a dark interior in which gleam a white object i
suppos the statu of the child hart and two other enter the door
be close behind them about five minut later thei appear again

the middl place while the priest rang themselv on either side
next hart have onc more open the door of the sanctuari took hi
stand a littl to the right of it and address us not in english but
in hi own languag paus at the end of each sentenc that i might
translat to ragnal
lord macumazana and igeza and yellow man who is name
lightindark he said we the head priest of the child
speak on behalf of the white kendah peopl with full author so to
do have taken counsel togeth and of the wisdom of the child as to the
demand which you make of us those demand ar first that after you
have kill jana and defeat the black kendah we should give over to
you the white ladi who wa born in a far land to fill the offic of
guardian of the child as is shown by the mark of the new moon upon
her breast but who becaus for the second time we could not take her
becam the wife of you the lord igeza secondli that we should conduct
you and her safe out of our land to some place whenc you can return
to your own countri both of these thing we will do becaus we know
from of old that if onc jana is dead we shall have no caus to fear the
black kendah ani more sinc we believ that then thei will leav their
home and go elsewher and therefor that we shall no longer need an
oracl to declar to us in what wai heaven will protect us from jana and
from them or if anoth oracl should becom necessari to us doubtless
in due season she will be found also we admit that we stole awai thi
ladi becaus we must although she wa the wife of on of you but if we
swear thi you on your part must also swear that you will stai with us
till the end of the war make our caus your caus and if need be
give your live for us in battl you must swear further that none of
you will attempt to see or to take henc that ladi who is name guardian
of the child until we hand her over to you unharm if you will not
swear these thing then sinc no blood mai be shed in thi holi place
here we will ring you round until you die of hunger and of thirst or if
you escap from thi templ then we will fall upon you and put you to
death and fight our own battl with jana as best we mai
and if we make these promis how ar we to know that you will keep
your i interrupt
becaus the oath that we shall give you will be the oath of the child
that mai not be broken
then give it i said for although i did not altogeth like the
secur obvious it wa the best to be had
so veri solemnli thei laid their right hand upon the altar and in the
presenc of the child and the name of the child and of all the white
kendah peopl repeat after hart a most solemn oath of which i
have alreadi given the substanc it call down on their head a veri
dread doom in thi world and the next should it be broken either in
the spirit or the letter the said oath howev to be onli bind if
we on our part swore to observ their term and kept our engag
also in the spirit and the letter
then thei ask us to fulfil our share of the pact and veri
consider drew out of hear while we discuss the matter hart
the onli on of them who understood a word of english retir behind
the sanctuari at first i had difficulti with ragnal who wa most
unwil to bind himself in ani wai in the end on my point out
that noth less than our live were involv and probabl that of hi
wife as well also that no other cours wa open to us he gave wai to
my great relief
han announc himself readi to swear anyth ad blandli that
word matter noth as afterward we could do whatev seem best
in our own interest whereon i read him a short moral lectur on the
heinous of perjuri which did not seem to impress him veri much
thi matter settl we call back the priest and inform them of our
decis hart demand that we should affirm it by the child which
we declin to do sai that it wa our custom to swear onli in the
name of our own god be a liberalmind man who had travel hart
gave wai on the point so i swore first to the effect that i would fight
for the white kendah to the finish in consider of the promis that
thei had made to us i ad that i would not attempt either to see or
to interfer with the ladi here known as the guardian of the child until
the war wa over or even to bring our exist to her knowledg end
up so help me god as i had done sever time when give evid
in a court of law
next ragnal with a great effort repeat my oath in english hart
listen carefulli to everi word and onc or twice ask me to explain
the exact mean of some of them
lastli han who seem veri bore with the whole affair swore also
repeat the word after me and finish on hi own account with
so help me the reverend predik the baass father a form that he
utterli declin to vari although it involv more explan when
press inde he show consider ingenu by point out to
the priest that to hi mind my poor father stood in exactli the same
relat to the power abov us as their oracl did to the child he
offer gener howev to throw in the spirit of hi grandfath
and grandmoth and some extraordinari divin thei worship i think
it wa a hare as an addit guarante of good faith thi propos
the priest accept grave whereon han whisper into my ear in
dutch
those fool do not rememb that when press by dog the hare often
doubl on it own spoor and that your reverend father will be veri
pleas if i can plai them the same trick with the white ladi that thei
plai with the lord igeza
i onli look at him in repli sinc the moral of han wa past
argument it might perhap be sum up in on sentenc to get the
better of hi neighbour in hi master servic honestli if possibl
if not by ani mean that came to hi hand down to that of murder at
the bottom of hi dark and mysteri heart han worship onli on
god name love not of woman or child but of my humbl self hi
principl were those of a rather sly but veri highclass and exclus
dog neither better nor wors still when all is said and done there
ar lower creatur in the world than highclass dog at least so
the master whom thei ador ar apt to think especi if their
watch and courag have often save them from death or disast
chapter xviii
the embassi
the ceremoni were over and the priest with the except of hart
and two who remain to attend upon him vanish probabl to inform
the male and femal hieroph of their result and through these the
whole peopl of the white kendah old hart stare at us for a littl
while then said in english which he alwai like to talk when ragnal
wa present perhap for the sake of practic
what you like do now eh prap wish fly back to town of child for
suppos thi how you come if so pleas take me with you becaus that
save long ride
oh no i answer we walk here through that hole where live the
father of snake who di of fear when he saw us and just mix with
the rest of you in the court of the templ
good lie said hart admiringli veri firstclass lie wonder how
you kill great snake which we all think never die for he live there
hundr hundr year our peopl find him there when first thei come
to thi countri and make him kind of god well he nasti beast and best
dead i sai you like see child if so come for you our brother now
onli pleas take off hat and not speak
i intim that we should like see child and led by hart we enter
the littl sanctuari which wa bare larg enough to hold all of us
in a nich of the end wall stood the sacr effigi which ragnal and i
examin with a kind of rever interest it prove to be the statu of
an infant about two feet high cut i imagin from the base of a singl
but veri larg eleph tusk so ancient that the yellowish ivori had
becom rotten and wa cover with a multitud of tini fissur inde
for it appear i made up my mind that sever thousand of year
must have pass sinc the beast di from which thi ivori wa taken
especi as it had i presum alwai been carefulli preserv under
cover
the workmanship of the object wa excel that of a fine artist who
i should think had taken some live infant for hi model perhap a
child of the pharaoh of the dai here i mai sai at onc that there could
be no doubt of it egyptian origin sinc on on side of the head wa a
singl lock of hair while the fourth finger of the right hand wa
held befor the lip as though to enjoin silenc both of these
peculiar it will be rememb ar characterist of the infant
horu the child of osiri and isi as portrai in bronz and templ
carv so at least ragnal who recent had studi mani such
effigi in egypt inform me later there wa noth els in the
place except an ancient stringseat chair of eboni adorn with
inlaid ivori pattern an effigi of a snake in porcelain show that
serpent worship wa in some wai mix up with their religion and two
roll of papyru at least that is what thei look like which were
laid in the nich with the statu these roll to my disappoint
hart refus to allow us to examin or even to touch
after we had left the sanctuari i ask hart when thi figur wa
brought to their land he repli that it came when thei came at what
date he could not tell us as it wa so long ago and that with it came
the worship and the ceremoni of their religion
in answer to further question he ad that thi figur which seem
to be of ivori contain the spirit which rule the sun and the moon
and through them the world thi said ragnal wa just a piec of
egyptian theologi preserv down to our own time in a remot corner
of africa doubtless by descend of dweller on the nile who had been
driven thenc in some nation catastroph and brought awai with them
their faith and on of the effigi of their god perhap thei fled at
the time of the persian invas by cambys
after we had emerg from thi deepli interest shrine which wa
lock behind us hart led us not through the passag connect it
with the stone hous that we knew wa occupi by ragnal wife in her
capac as guardian of the child or a latterdai personif of
isi ladi of the moon at which hous he cast mani long glanc but
back through the two court and the pylon to the gatewai of the templ
here on the road by which we had enter the place a fact which we did
not mention to him he paus and address us
lord he said now you and the peopl of the white kendah ar on
your end ar their end your fate is their fate their secret ar
your secret you lord igeza work for a reward name the person of
that ladi whom we took from you on the nile
how did you do that interrupt ragnal when i had interpret
lord we watch you we knew when you came to egypt we follow you
in egypt whither we had journei on our road to england onc more to
seek our oracl till the dai of our opportun dawn then at night
we call her and she obei the call as she must do whose mind we have
taken awayask me not howand brought her to dwell with us she who
is mark from her birth with the holi sign and wear upon her breast
certain charm stone and a symbol that for thousand of year have
adorn the bodi of the child and those of it oracl do you rememb
a compani of arab whom you saw ride on the bank of the great river
on the dai befor the night when she wa lost to you we were with that
compani and on our camel we bore her thenc happi and unharm to thi
our land as i trust when all is done we shall bear her back again and
you with her
i trust so also for you have wrought me a great wrong said ragnal
briefli perhap a greater wrong than i know at present for how came
it that my boi wa kill by an eleph
ask that question of jana and not of me hart answer darkli then
he went on you also lord macumazana work for a reward the countless
store of ivori which your ey have beheld ly in the burial place of
eleph beyond the tava river when you have slain jana who watch
the store and defeat the black kendah who serv him it is your and
we will give you camel to bear it or some of it for all cannot be
carri to the sea where it can be taken awai in ship as for the
yellow man i think that he seek no reward who soon will inherit all
thing
the old witchdoctor mean that i am go to die remark han
expector reflect well baa i am quit readi if onli jana
and certain other die first inde i grow too old to fight and travel
as i us to do and therefor shall be glad to pass to some land where
i becom young again
stuff and rubbish i exclaim then turn and listen to hart who
not understand our dutch convers wa speak onc more
lord he said these path which run east and west ar the real
approach to the mountain top and the templ not that which as i
suppos led you through the cave of the old serpent the road to
the west which wander round the base of the hill to a pass in those
distant mountain and thenc across the desert to the north is so easi
to stop that by it we need fear no attack with thi eastern road the
case is howev differ as i shall now show you if you will ride
with me
then he gave some order to two attend priest who depart at a run
and present reappear at the head of a small train of camel which
had been hidden i know not where we mount and follow the road
across a flat piec of ground found that not more than half a mile awai
wa anoth precipit ridg of rock which had presum onc form
the lip of an outer crater thi ridg howev wa broken awai for a
width of two or three hundr yard perhap by some outrush of lava
the road run through the centr of the gap on which schanz had
been built here and there for purpos of defenc look at these i
saw that thei were veri old and ineffici and ask when thei had been
erect hart repli about a centuri befor when the last war took
place with the black kendah who had been final driven off at thi
spot for then the white kendah were more numer than at present
so simba know thi road i said
ye lord and jana know it also for he fought in that war and still
at time visit us here and kill ani whom he mai meet onli to the
templ he ha never dare to come
now i wonder whether we had realli seen jana in the forest on the
previou night but come to the conclus that it wa useless to
investig the matter made no inquiri especi as these would
have reveal to hart the rout by which we approach the templ onli
i point out to him that proper defenc should be put up here without
delai that is if thei meant to make a stronghold of the mountain
we do lord he answer sinc we ar not strong enough to attack
the black kendah in their own countri or to meet them in pitch battl
on the plain here and in no other place must be fought the last fight
between jana and the child therefor it will be your task to build
wall cunningli so that when thei come we mai defeat jana and the host
of the black kendah
do you mean that thi eleph will accompani simba and hi soldier
hart
without doubt lord sinc he ha alwai done so from the begin
jana is tame to the king and certain priest of the black kendah whose
forefath have fed him for gener and will obei their order
also he can think for himself be an evil spirit and invulner
hi left ey and the tip of hi trunk ar not invulner i
remark though from what i saw of him i should sai there is no doubt
about hi be abl to think for himself well i am glad the brute is
come as i have an account to settl with him
as he lord who doe not forget ha an account to settl with you and
your servant lightindark comment hart in an unpleas and
suggest tone
then after we had taken a few measur and ragnal who understand
such matter had drawn a rough sketch of the place in hi pocketbook
to serv as data for our propos scheme of fortif we pursu
our journei back to the town where we had left all our store and there
were mani thing to be arrang it prove to be quit a long ride down
the eastern slope of the mountain which wa easi to negoti although
like the rest of thi strang hill it wa cover with dens cedar
forest that also seem to me to have defens possibl reach
it foot at length we were oblig to make a detour by certain wind
path to avoid ground that wa too rough for the camel so that in the
end we did not come to our own hous in the town of the child till about
middai
glad enough were we to reach it sinc all three of us were tire out
with our terribl night journei and the anxiou emot that we had
undergon inde after we had eaten we lai down and i rejoic to
see that notwithstand the state of mental excit into which the
discoveri of hi wife had plung him ragnal wa the first of us to
fall asleep
about five oclock we were awaken by a messeng from hart
who request our attend on import busi at a kind of
meetinghous which stood at a littl distanc on an open place where
the white kendah barter produc here we found hart and about twenti
of the headmen seat in the shade of a thatch roof while behind
them at a respect distanc stood quit a hundr of the white
kendah most of these howev were women and children for as i have
said the greater part of the male popul wa absent from the town
becaus of the commenc of the harvest
we were conduct to chair or rather stool of honour and when we two
had seat ourselv han take hi stand behind us hart rose and
inform us that an embassi had arriv from the black kendah which wa
about to be admit
present thei came five of them great truculentlook fellow of
a surpris black unarm for thei had not been allow to bring
their weapon in to the town but adorn with the usual silver chain
across their breast to show their rank and other savag fineri in the
man who wa their leader i recogn on of those messeng who had
accost us when first we enter their territori on our wai from the
south befor that fight in which i wa taken prison step forward
and address himself to hart he said
a while ago o prophet of the child i the messeng of the god jana
speak through the mouth of simba the king gave to you and your
brother mart a certain warn to which you did not listen now jana
ha mart and again i come to warn you hart
if i rememb right interrupt hart blandli i think that on that
occas two of you deliv the messag and that the child mark on
of you upon the brow if jana ha my brother sai where is your
we warn you went on the messeng and you curs us in the name
of the child
ye interrupt hart again we curs you with three curs the
first wa the curs of heaven by storm or drought which ha fallen upon
you the second wa the curs of famin which is fall upon you and
the third wa the curs of war which is yet to fall on you
it is of war that we come to speak repli the messeng
diplomat avoid the other two topic which perhap he found it
awkward to discuss
that is foolish of you repli the bland hart see that the
other dai you match yourselv against us with but small success mani
of you were kill but onli a veri few of us and the white lord whom
you took captiv escap out of your hand and from the tusk of jana
who i think now lack an ey if he is a god how come it that he
lack an ey and could not kill an unarm white man
let jana answer for himself as he will do er long o hart
meanwhil these ar the word of jana spoken through the mouth of simba
the king the child ha destroi my harvest and therefor i demand thi
of the peopl of the childthat thei give me threefourth of their
harvest reap the same and deliv it on the south bank of the
river tava that thei give me the two white lord to be sacrif to
me that thei give the white ladi who is guardian of the child to be a
wife of simba the king and with her a hundr virgin of your peopl
that the imag of the child be brought to the god jana in the presenc
of hi priest and simba the king these ar the demand of jana spoken
through the mouth of simba the king
watch i saw a thrill of horror shake the form of hart and of
all those with him as the full mean of these to them most impiou
request sank into their mind but he onli ask veri quietli
and if we refus the demand what then
then shout the messeng insol then jana declar war upon
you the last war of all war till everi on of your men be dead and the
child you worship is burnt to grei ash with fire war till your women
ar taken as slave and the corn which you refus is store in our grain
pit and your land is a wast and your name forgotten alreadi the host
of jana ar gather and the trumpet of jana call them to the fight
tomorrow or the next dai thei advanc upon you and er the moon is
full not on of you will be left to look upon her
hart rose and walk from under the shed turn hi back upon the
envoi and stare at the distant line of great mountain which stood out
far awai against the sky out of curios i follow him and observ
that these mountain were no longer visibl where thei had been wa
noth but a line of black and heavi cloud after look for a while
he return and address the envoi said quit casual
if you will be advis by me friend you will ride hard for the
river there is such rain upon the mountain as i have never seen
befor and you will be fortun if you cross it befor the flood come
down the greatest flood that ha happen in our dai
thi intellig seem to disturb the messeng for thei too step
out of the shed and stare at the mountain mutter to each other
someth that i could not understand then thei return and with a
fine appear of indiffer demand an immedi answer to their
challeng
can you not guess it answer hart then chang hi tone he drew
himself to hi full height and thunder out at them get you back
to your evil spirit of a god that hide in the shape of a beast of the
forest and to hi slave who call himself a king and sai to them thu
speak the child to hi rebelli servant the black kendah dog swim
my river when you can which will not be yet and come up against me
when you will for whenev you come i shall be readi for you you ar
alreadi dead o jana you ar alreadi dead o simba the slave you ar
scatter and lost o dog of the black kendah and the home of such
of you as remain shall be far awai in a barren land where you must dig
deep for water and live upon the wild game becaus there littl corn
will grow now begon and swiftli lest you stop here for ever
so thei turn and went leav me full of admir for the
histrion power of hart
i must add howev that be without doubt a keen observ of the
weather condit of the neighbourhood he wa quit right about
the rain upon the mountain which by the wai never extend to the
territori of the peopl of the child as we heard afterward the flood
came down just as the envoi reach the river inde on of them wa
drown in attempt it cross and for fourteen dai after thi it
remain impass to an armi
that veri even we began our prepar to meet an attack which wa
now inevit put asid the suppos rival power of the tribal
divin worship under the name of the child and jana which
while thei ad a kind of homer interest to the contest could we
felt scarc affect an issu that must be decid with cold steel
and other mortal weapon the posit of the white kendah wa seriou
inde as i think i have said in all thei did not number more than
about two thousand men between the ag of twenti and fiftyf or
includ lad between fourteen and twenti and old men still ablebodi
between fiftyf and seventi sai two thousand seven hundr capabl
of some sort of martial servic to these might be ad someth under
two thousand women sinc among thi dwindl folk oddli enough from
caus that i never ascertain the male outnumb the femal
which account for their marriag custom that were by comparison with
those of most african peopl monogam at ani rate onli the
rich among them had more than on wife while the poor or otherwis
inelig often had none at all sinc intermarriag with other race
and abov all with the black kendah dwell beyond the river wa so
strictli taboo that it wa punish with death or expuls
against thi littl band the black kendah could bring up twenti thousand
men besid boi and ag person who with the women would probabl
be left to defend their own countri that is not less than ten to on
moreov all of these enemi would be fight with the courag of
despair sinc quit threefourth of their crop with mani of their
cattl and sheep had been destroi by the terrif hailburst that
i have describ therefor sinc no other corn wa avail in the
surround land where thei dwelt alon encircl by desert either
thei must captur that of the white kendah or suffer terribl from
starvat until a year later when anoth harvest ripen
the onli point i could see in favour of the peopl of the child
were that thei would fight on the vantag ground of their mountain
stronghold a formid posit if properli defend also thei would
have the benefit of the skill and knowledg of ragnal and myself
lastli the enemi must face our rifl neither the white nor the
black kendah i should sai possess ani gun except a few antiqu
flintlock weapon that the former had captur from some nomad tribe
and kept as curios why thi wa the case i do not know sinc
undoubtedli at time the white kendah trade in camel and corn with
arab who wander as far as the sudan or egypt nomad tribe to whom
even then firearm were known although perhap rare us by them but
so it wa possibl becaus of some old law or prejudic which forbad
their introduct into the countri or mayhap of the difficulti of
procur powder and lead or for the reason that thei had none to teach
them the us of such newfangl weapon
now it will be rememb that on the chanc of their prove us
ragnal in addit to our own sport rifl had brought with him to
africa fifti snider rifl with an ampl suppli of ammunit the same
that i had troubl in pass through the custom at durban all of
which had arriv safe at the town of the child clearli our first
duti wa to make the best possibl us of thi invalu store to
that end i ask hart to select seventyf of the boldest and most
intellig young men among hi peopl and to hand them over to me and
han for instruct in musketri we had onli fifti rifl but i drill
seventyf men or fifti per cent more that some might be readi to
replac ani who fell
from dawn to dark each dai han and i work at try to convert
these kendah into sharpshoot it wa no easi task with men howev
will who till then had never held a gun especi as i must be
veri spare of the ammunit necessari to practic of which of cours
our suppli wa limit still we taught them how to take cover how to
fire and to ceas from fire at a word of command also to hold the
rifl low and wast no shot to make marksmen of them wa more than i
could hope to do under the circumst
with the except of these men nearli the entir male popul
were work dai and night to get in the harvest thi prove a veri
difficult busi both becaus some of the crop were scarc fit and
becaus all the grain had to be carri on camel to be store in and at
the back of the second court of the templ the onli place where it wa
like to be safe inde in the end a great deal wa left unreap
then the herd of cattl and breed camel which graze on the farther
side of the holi mount must be brought into place of safeti glen in
the forest on it slope and forag stack to feed them also it wa
necessari to provid scout to keep watch along the river
lastli the fortif in the mountain pass requir unceas
labour and attent thi wa the task of ragnal who fortun in
hi youth befor he succeed unexpectedli to the titl wa for
some year an offic in the royal engin and therefor thoroughli
understood that busi inde he understood it rather too well sinc
the result of hi somewhat complic and scientif scheme of defenc
wa a littl confus to the simpl nativ mind howev with the
assist of all the priest and of all the women and children who
were not engag in provis the mount he built wall after wall and
redoubt after redoubt if that is the right word to sai noth of the
shelter trench he dug and mani pitfal furnish at the bottom with
sharp stake which he hollow out wherev the soil could be easili
move to discomfit a charg enemi
inde when i saw the amount of work he had conclud in ten
dai which wa not until i join him on the mountain i wa quit
astonish
about thi time a disput aros as to whether we should attempt to
prevent the black kendah from cross the river which wa now run
down a plan that some of the elder favour at last the controversi
wa refer to me as head gener and i decid against anyth of the
sort it seem to me that our forc wa too small and that if i took
the riflemen a great deal of ammunit might be expend with poor
result also in the event of ani revers or when we were final driven
back which must happen there might be difficulti about remount the
camel our onli mean of escap from the horsemen who would possibl
gallop us down moreov the tava had sever ford ani on of which
might be select by the enemi so it wa arrang that we should make
our first and last stand upon the holi mount
on the fourteenth night from new moon our swift camelscout who were
post in relai between the tava and the mount report that the black
kendah were gather in thousand upon the farther side of the river
where thei were engag in celebr magic ceremoni on the
fifteenth night the scout report that thei were cross the river
about five thousand horsemen and fifteen thousand foot soldier and
that at the head of them march the huge godeleph jana on which
rode simba the king and a lame priest evid my friend whose foot
had been injur by the pistol who act as a mahout thi part of the
stori i confess i did not believ sinc it seem to me imposs that
anyon could ride upon that mad rogu jana yet as subsequ event
show it wa in fact true i suppos that in certain hand the beast
becam tame or perhap it wa drug
two night later for the black kendah advanc but slowli spread
themselv over the countri in order to collect such crop as had not
been gather through lack of time or becaus thei were still unrip
we saw flame and smoke aris from the town of the child beneath us
which thei had fire now we knew that the time of trial had come and
until near midnight men women and children work feverishli finish
or try to finish the fortif and make everi prepar in
our power
our posit wa that we held a veri strong post that is strong
against an enemi unprovid with big gun or even firearm which as
all other possibl approach had been block wa onli assail by
direct frontal attack from the east in the pass we had three main line
of defenc on arrang behind the other and separ by distanc of
a few hundr yard our last refug wa furnish by the wall of the
templ itself in the rear of which were camp the whole white kendah
tribe save a few hundr who were emploi in watch the herd of
camel and stock in almost inaccess posit on the northern slope
of the mount
there were perhap five thousand peopl of both sex and everi ag
gather in thi camp which wa so well provid with food and water
that it could have stood a sieg of sever month if howev our
defenc should be carri there wa no possibl of escap sinc
we learn from our scout that the black kendah who by tradit and
through spi were well acquaint with everi featur of the countri
had detach a parti of sever thousand men to watch the western road
and the slope of the mountain in case we should try to break out by
that rout the onli on remain that which ran through the cave
of the serpent we had taken the precaut of block up with great
stone lest through it our flank should be turn
in short we were rat in a trap and where we were there we must either
conquer or dieunless inde we chose to surrend which for most of
us would mean a fate wors than death
chapter xix
allan quatermain miss
i had made my last round of the littl corp that i faceti name
the sharpshoot though to tell the truth at shoot thei were
anyth but sharp and seen that each man wa in hi place behind a
wall with a reserv man squat at the rear of everi pair of them
wait to take hi rifl if either of these should fall also i had
made sure that all of them had twenti round of ammunit in their skin
pouch more i would not serv out fear lest in excit or in
panic thei might fire awai to the last cartridg uselessli as befor
now even disciplin white troop have been known to do therefor i had
arrang that certain old men of stand who could be trust should
wait in a place of compar safeti behind the line carri all our
reserv ammunit which amount allow for what had been expend
in practic to nearli sixti round per rifl thi thei were instruct
to deliv from their wallet to the fire line in small lot when thei
saw that it wa necessari and not befor
it wa i admit an arrang apt to miscarri in the heat of desper
battl but i could think of none better sinc it wa absolut
necessari that no shot should be wast
after a few word of exhort and caution to the nativ who act
as sergeant to the corp i return to a bough shelter that had been
built for us behind a rock to get a few hour sleep if that were
possibl befor the fight began
here i found ragnal who had just come in from hi inspect thi
wa of a much more extens natur than my own sinc it involv go
round some furlong of the rough wall and trench that he had prepar
with so much thought and care and see that the variou compani of
the white kendah were readi to plai their part in the defenc of them
he wa tire and rather excit too much so to sleep at onc so we
talk a littl while first about the prospect of the morrow battl
as to which we were to sai the least of it dubiou and afterward of
other thing i ask him if dure hi stai in thi place while i wa
below at the town or later he had heard or seen anyth of hi wife
noth he answer these priest never speak of her and if
thei did hart is the onli on of them that i can realli understand
moreov i have kept my word strictli and even when i had occas
to see to the block of the western road made a circuit on the
mountaintop in order to avoid the neighbourhood of that hous where i
suppos she live oh quatermain my friend my case is a hard on as
you would think if the woman you love with your whole heart were shut
up within a few hundr yard of you and no commun with her
possibl after all thi time of separ and agoni what make it
wors is as i gather from what hart said the other dai that she is
still out of her mind
that ha some consol i repli sinc the mindless do not
suffer but if such is the case how do you account for what you
and poor savag saw that night in the town of the child it wa not
altogeth a phantasi for the dress you describ wa the same we saw
her wear at the feast of the firstfruit
i dont know what to make of it quatermain except that mani strang
thing happen in the world which we mock at as insult to our limit
intellig becaus we cannot understand them veri soon i wa to
have anoth proof of thi remark but what ar you drive at you
ar keep someth back
onli thi ragnal if your wife were utterli mad i cannot conceiv
how it came about that she search you out and spoke to you even in
a visionfor the thing wa not an individu dream sinc both you and
savag saw her nor did she actual visit you in the flesh as the door
never open and the spider web across it wa not broken so it come
to thi either some part of her is not mad but can still exercis
suffici will to project itself upon your sens or she is dead and
her disembodi spirit did thi thing now we know that she is not
dead for we have seen her and hart ha confess as much therefor
i maintain that whatev mai be her temporari state she must still
be fundament of a reason mind as she is of a natur bodi for
instanc she mai onli be hypnot in which case the spell will break
on dai
thank you for that thought old fellow it never occur to me and
it give me new hope now listen if i should come to grief in thi
busi which is veri like and you should surviv you will do your
best to get her home will you not here is a codicil to my will which i
drew up after that night of dream duli wit by savag and han
it leav to you whatev sum mai be necessari in thi connexion
and someth over for yourself take it it is best in your keep
especi as if you should be kill it ha no valu
of cours i will do my best i answer as i put awai the paper in
my pocket and now dont let us take ani more thought of be kill
which mai prevent us from get the sleep we want i dont mean to be
kill if i can help it i mean to give those beggar the black kendah
such a do as thei never had befor and then start for the coast with
you and ladi ragnal as god will we shall do good night
after thi i slept like a top for some hour as i believ ragnal did
also when i awok which happen suddenli and complet the first
thing that i saw wa han seat at the entranc to my littl shelter
smoke hi corncob pipe and nurs the singlebarrel rifl
intombi on hi knee i ask him what the time wa to which he repli
that it lack two hour to dawn then i ask him why he had not been
sleep he repli that he had been asleep and dream a dream idli
enough i inquir what dream to which he repli
rather a strang on baa for a man who is about to go into battl i
dream that i wa in a larg place that wa full of quiet it wa light
there but i could not see ani sun or moon and the air wa veri soft
and tast like food and drink so much so baa that if anyon had
offer me a cup quit full of the best cape smoke i should have told
him to take it awai then baa suddenli i saw your reverend father
the predik stand besid me and look just as he us to look
onli younger and stronger and veri happi and so of cours knew at onc
that i wa dead and in hell onli i wonder where the fire that doe
not go out might be for i could not see it present your reverend
father said to me good dai han so you have come here at last now
tell me how ha it gone with my son the baa allan have you look
after him as i told you to do
i answer i have look after him as well as i could o reverend
sir littl enough have i done still not onc or twice or three time
onli have i offer up my life for him as wa my duti and yet we both
have live and that i might be sure he heard the best of me as wa
but natur i told him the time baa make a big stori out of small
thing although all the while i could see that he knew exactli just
where i began to lie and just where i stop from ly still he did
not scold me baa inde when i had finish he said
well done o good and faith servant word that i think i have
heard him us befor when he wa aliv baa and us to preach to us
for such a long time on sundai afternoon then he ask and how goe
it with baa allan my son now han to which i repli
the baa allan is go to fight a veri great battl in which he mai
well fall and if i could feel sorri here which i cant i should
weep o reverend sir becaus i have di befor that battl began and
therefor cannot stand at hi side in the battl and be kill for him
as a servant should for hi master
you will stand at hi side in the battl said your miss line
in print versionjb do as it is fit that you should and
afterward han you will make report to me of how the battl went and
of what honour my son ha won therein moreov know thi han that
though while you live in the world you seem to see mani other thing
thei ar but dream sinc in all the world there is but on real
thing and it name is love which if it be but strong enough the star
themselv must obei for it is the king of everi on of them and all
who dwell in them worship it dai and night under mani name for ever and
for ever amen
what he meant by that i am sure i dont know baa see that i have
never thought much of women at least not for mani year sinc my last
old vrouw went and drank herself to death after ly in her sleep on
the babi which i love much better than i did her baa
well befor i could ask him or about hell either he wa gone like a
whiff of smoke from a rifl mouth in a strong wind
han paus puf at hi pipe spat upon the ground in hi usual
reflect wai and ask
is the baa tire of the dream or would he like to hear the rest
i should like to hear the rest i said in a low voic for i wa
strang move
well baa while i wa stand in that place which wa so full of
quiet turn my hat in my hand and wonder what work thei would set
me to there among the devil i look up there i saw come toward
me two veri beauti women baa who had their arm round each other
neck thei were dress in white with the littl hard thing that ar
found in shell hang about them and bright stone in their hair
and as thei came baa wherev thei set a foot flower sprang up veri
pretti flower so that all their path across the quiet place wa mark
with flower bird too sang as thei pass at least i think thei were
bird though i could not see them
what were thei like han i whisper
on of them baa the taller i did not know but the other i knew well
enough it wa she whose name is holi not to be mention yet i must
mention that name it wa the missi mari herself as last we saw
her aliv mani mani year ago onli grown a hundr time more
beauti
see the book call mari by h rider haggard
now i groan and han went on
the two white on came up to me and stood look at me with ey
that were more soft than those of buck then the missi mari said to
the other thi is han of whom i have so often told you o star
here i groan again for how did thi hottentot know that name or
rather it sweet render
then she who wa call star ask how goe it with on who is the
heart of all three of us o han ye baa those shine on join
me the dirti littl hottentot in my old cloth and smell of
tobacco with themselv when thei spoke of you for i knew thei were
speak of you baa which made me think i must be drunk even there
in the quiet place so i told them all that i had told your reverend
father and a veri great deal more for thei seem never to be tire of
listen and onc when i mention that sometim while pretend
to be asleep i had heard you prai aloud at night for the missi
mari who di for you and for anoth who had been your wife whose
name i did not rememb but who had also di thei both cri a littl
baa their tear shone like crystal and smelt like that stuff in a
littl glass tube which hart said that he brought from some far land
when he put a drop or two on your handkerchief after you were faint
from the pain in your leg at the hous yonder or perhap it wa the
flower that smelt for where the tear fell there sprang up white
lili shape like two babe hand held togeth in prayer
hear thi i hid my face in my hand lest han should see human tear
unscent with attar of rose and bade him continu
baa the white on who wa call star ask me of your son the
young baa harri and i told her that when last i had seen him he wa
strong and well and would make a bigger man than you were whereat she
sigh and shook her head then the missi mari said tell the baa
han that i also have a child which he will see on dai but it is not
a son
after thi thei too said someth about love but what it wa
i cannot rememb sinc even as i repeat thi dream to you it is
begin to slip awai from me fast as a swallow skim the water
their last word howev i do rememb thei were sai to the baa
that we who never met in life but who here ar as twin sister wait
and count the year and count the month and count the dai and count
the hour and count the minut and count the second until onc more he
shall hear our voic call to him across the night that what thei
sai baa then thei were gone and onli the flower remain to show
that thei had been stand there
now i set off to bring you the messag and travel a veri long wai
at a great rate if jana himself had been after me i could not have gone
more fast at last i got out of that quiet place and among mountain
where there were dark kloof and there in the kloof i heard zulu impi
sing their warsong ye thei sang the ingoma or someth veri
like it now suddenli in the pass of the mountain along which i sped
there appear befor me a veri beauti woman whose skin shone like
the best copper coffe kettl after i have polish it baa she wa
dress in a leopardlik moocha and wore on her shoulder a fur kaross
and about her neck a circlet of blue bead and from her hair there rose
on crane feather tall as a walkingstick and in her hand she held a
littl spear no flower sprang beneath her feet when she walk toward
me and no bird sang onli the air wa fill with the sound of a royal
salut which roll among the mountain like the roar of thunder and
her ey flash like summer lightn
now i let my hand fall and stare at him for well i knew what wa
come
stand yellow man she said and give me the royal salut
so i gave her the bayt though who she might be i did not know
sinc i did not think it wise to stai to ask her if it were her of
right although i should have like to do so then she said the old
man on the plain yonder and those two pale white on have talk to you
of their love for your master the lord macumazana i tell you littl
yellow dog that thei do not know what love can be there is more love
for him in my ey alon than thei have in all that make them fair sai
it to the lord macumazana that as i know well he goe down to battl
and that the ladi mameena will be with him in the battl as though he
saw her not she ha been with him in other battl and will be with
him till the river of time ha run over the edg of the world and is
lost beyond the sun let him rememb thi when jana rush on and death
is veri near to him todai and let him lookfor then perchanc he
shall see me begon now yellow dog to the heel of your master and
plai your part well in the battl for of what you do or leav undon
you shall give account to me sai that mameena send her greet to
the lord macumazana and that she add thi that when the old man and
the white on told you that love is the secret blood of the world
which make them to be thei did not lie love reign and i mameena am
it priestess and the heart of macumazana is my holi hous
then baa i tumbl off a precipic and woke up here and baa as
we mai not light a fire i have kept some coffe hot for you buri in
warm ash and without anoth word he went to fetch that coffe
leav me shaken and amaz
for what kind of a dream wa it which reveal to an old hottentot all
these mysteri and hidden thing about person whom he had never seen
and of whom i had never spoken to him my father and my wife mari might
be explain for with these he had been mix up but how about stella
and abov all mameena although of cours it wa possibl that he had
heard of the latter who made some stir in her time but to hit her off
as he had done in all her pride splendour and dominion of desir
well that wa hi stori which perhap fortun i lack time to
analys or brood upon sinc there wa much in it calcul to unnerv
a man just enter the crisi of a desper frai inde a minut or
so later as i wa swallow the last of the coffe messeng arriv
about some busi i forget what sent by ragnal i think who had
risen befor i woke i turn to give the pannikin to han but he had
vanish in hi snakelik fashion so i threw it down upon the ground
and devot my mind to the question rais in ragnal messag
next minut scout came in who had been watch the camp of the black
kendah all night
these were sleep not more than half a mile awai in an open place on
the slope of the hill with picket thrown out round them intend to
advanc upon us it wa said as soon as the sun rose sinc becaus of
their number thei fear lest to march at night should throw them into
confus and in case of their fall into an ambush bring about a
disast such at least wa the stori of two spi whom our peopl had
captur
there had been some question as to whether we should not attempt a night
attack upon their camp of which i wa rather in favour after full
debat howev the idea had been abandon ow to the few of
our number the dislik which the white kendah share with the black of
attempt to oper in the dark and the well chosen posit of our
enemi whom it would be imposs to rush befor we were discov by
their outpost what i hope in my heart wa that thei might try to
rush us notwithstand the stori of the two captur spi and in
the gloom after the moon had sunk low and befor the dawn came becom
entangl in our pitfal and outli entrench where we should be
abl to destroi a great number of them onli on the previou afternoon
that cun old fellow han had point out to me how advantag
such an event would be to our caus and while agre with him i
suggest that probabl the black kendah knew thi as well as we did as
the prison had told us
yet that veri thing happen and through han himself thu old hart
had come to me just on hour befor the dawn to inform me that all
our peopl were awak and at their station and to make some last
arrang as to the cours of the defenc also about our final
concentr behind the last line of wall and in the first court of
the templ if we should be driven from the outer entrench he
wa tell me that the oracl of the child had utter word at the
ceremoni that night which he and all the priest consid were of the
most favour import new to which i listen with some impati
feel as i did that thi busi had pass out of the rang of the
child and it oracl as he spoke suddenli through the silenc that
preced the dawn there float to our ear the unmistak sound of
a rifl ye a rifl shot half a mile or so awai follow by the
roar murmur of a great camp unexpectedli alarm at night
who can have fire that i ask the black kendah have no gun
he repli that he did not know unless some of my fifti men had left
their post
while we were investig the matter scout rush in with the
intellig that the black kendah think appar that thei were
be attack had broken camp and were advanc toward us we pass
a warn all down the line and stood to arm five minut later as i
stood listen to that approach roar fill with everi kind of fear
and melancholi forebod such as the hour and the occas might well
have evok through the gloom which wa dens the moon be hidden
behind the hill i thought i caught sight of someth run toward
me like a crouch man i lift my rifl to fire but reflect that
it might be no more than a hyena and fear to provok a fusilad from
my halftrain compani did not do so
next instant i wa glad inde for immedi on the other side of the
wall behind which i wa stand i heard a wellknown voic gasp out
dont shoot baa it is i
what have you been do han i said as he scrambl over the wall
to my side limp a littl as i fanci
baa he puf i have been pai the black kendah a visit i crept
down between their stupid outpost who ar as blind in the dark as a
bat in daytim hope to find jana and put a bullet into hi leg or
trunk i didnt find him baa although i heard him but on of their
captain stood up in front of a watchfir give a good shot my bullet
found him baa for he tumbl back into the fire make the spark
fly thi wai and that then i ran and as you see got here quit
safe
why did you plai that fool trick i ask see that it ought to
have cost you your life
i shall die just when i have to die not befor baa he repli in
the interv of reload the littl rifl also it wa the trick of a
wise man not of a fool see that it ha made the black kendah think
that we were attack them and caus them to hurri on to attack us
in the dark over ground that thei do not know listen to them come
as he spoke a roar of sound told us that the great charg had swept
round a turn there wa in the pass and wa head toward us up
the straight ivori horn brai captain shout order the veri
mountain shook beneath the beat of thousand of feet of men and
hors while in on great yell that echo from the cliff and forest
went up the battlecri of jana janaa mix tumult of nois which
contrast veri strang with the utter silenc in our rank
thei will be among the pitfal present snigger han shift
hi weight nervous from on leg on to the other hark thei ar go
into them
it wa true scream of fear and pain told me that the front rank
had begun to fall hors and foot togeth into the cunningli devis
snare of which with so much labour we had dug mani conceal them
with earth spread over thin wickerwork or rather interlac
bough into them went the forerunn to be pierc by the sharp
fireharden stake set at the bottom of each pit vainli did those who
were near enough to understand their danger call to the rank behind to
stop thei could not or would not comprehend and had no room to extend
their front forward surg the human torrent thrust all in front of
it to death by wound or suffoc in those deadli hole till on by
on thei were fill level with the ground by struggl men and hors
over whom the armi still rush on
how mani perish there i do not know but after the battl wa over we
found scarc a pit that wa not crowd to the brim with dead truli
thi devic of ragnal for if i had conceiv the idea which
wa unfamiliar to the kendah it wa he who had carri it out in so
masterli a fashion had serv us well
still the enemi surg on sinc the pit were onli larg enough to hold
a tith of them till at length horsemen and footmen mix up togeth
in inextric confus their mighti mass becam faintli visibl
quit close to us a blacker blot upon the gloom
then my turn came when thei were not more than fifti yard awai from
the first wall i shout an order to my riflemen to fire aim low
and set the exampl by loos both barrel of an eleph gun at the
thickest of the mob at that distanc even the most inexperienc shot
could not miss such a mark especi as those bullet that went high
struck among the oncom troop behind or caught the horsemen lift
abov their fellow inde of the first few round i do not think that
on wa wast while often singl ball kill or injur sever men
the result wa instantan the black kendah who be it rememb
were total unaccustom to the effect of rifl fire and imagin that
we onli possess two or three gun in all stop their advanc as
though paralyz for a few second there wa silenc except for the
intermitt crackl of the rifl as my men load and fire next came
the cri of the smitten men and hors that were fall everywher
and thenth unmistak sound of a stamped
thei have gone that wa too warm for them baa chuckl han
exultingli
ye i answer when i had at length succeed in stop the
fire but i expect thei will come back with the light still that
trick of your ha cost them dear han
by degre the dawn began to break it wa i rememb a particularli
beauti dawn resembl a gigant and vivid rose open in the
east or a cup of bright from which mani colour wine were pour
all athwart the firmament veri peac also for not a breath of wind
wa stir but what a scene the first rai of the sun reveal upon
that narrow stretch of pass in front of us everywher the pitfal and
trench were fill with still surg heap of men and hors while
all about lai dead and wound men the red harvest of our rifl fire
it wa dread to contrast the heavenli peac abov and the hellish
horror beneath
we took count and found that up to thi moment we had not lost a singl
man on onli have been slightli wound by a thrown spear as is
common among semisavag thi fact fill the white kendah with an
undu exult think that as the begin wa so the end must
be thei cheer and shout shake each other hand then fell to
eat the food which the women brought them with appetit chatter
incessantli although as a gener rule thei were a veri silent peopl
even the grave hart who arriv full of congratul seem as
highspirit as a boi till i remind him that the real battl had not
yet commenc
the black kendah had fallen into a trap and lost some of their number
that wa all which wa fortun for us but could scarc affect the
issu of the struggl sinc thei had mani thousand left ragnal who
had come up from hi line agre with me as he said these peopl
were fight for life as well as honour see that most of the corn
which thei need for their susten wa store in great heap either
in or to the rear of the templ behind us therefor thei must come on
until thei won or were destroi how with our small forc could we hope
to destroi thi multitud that wa the problem which weigh upon our
heart
about a quarter of an hour later two spi that we had set upon the
top of the precipit cliff whenc thei had a good view of the pass
beyond the bend came scrambl down the rock like monkei by a rout
that wa known to them these boi for thei were no more report that
the black kendah were reform their armi beyond the bend of the pass
and that the cavalri were dismount and send their hors to the
rear evid becaus thei found them useless in such a place a
littl later solitari men appear from behind the bend carri
bundl of long stick to each of which wa attach a piec of white
cloth a proceed that excit my curios
soon it object becam appar swiftli these men of whom in the end
there mai have been thirti or forti ran to and fro test the ground
with spear in search for pitfal i think thei onli found a veri few
that had not been broken into but in front of these and also of those
that were alreadi full of men and hors thei set up the flag as a
warn that thei should be avoid in the advanc also thei remov a
number of their wound
we had great difficulti in restrain the white kendah from rush out
to attack them which of cours would onli have led us into a trap in
our turn sinc thei would have fled and conduct their pursuer into
the arm of the enemi nor would i allow my riflemen to fire as the
result must have been mani miss and a great wast of ammunit which
er long would be badli want i howev did shoot two or three then
gave it up as the remaind took no notic whatev
when thei had thoroughli explor the ground thei retir until a
littl later the black kendah armi began to appear march in serri
regiment and excel order round the bend till perhap eight or ten
thousand of them were visibl a veri fierc and aweinspir impi
their front rank halt between three and four hundr yard awai
which i thought farther off than it wa advis to open fire on them
with snider rifl held by unskil troop then came a paus which
at length wa broken by the blow of horn and a sound of exult
shout beyond the turn of the pass
now from round thi turn appear the strangest sight that i think my
ey had ever seen ye there came the huge eleph jana at a slow
shambl trot on hi back and head were two men in whom with my
glass i recogn the lame priest whom i alreadi knew too well and
simba the king of the black kendah himself gorgeous apparel and
wave a long spear seat in a kind of wooden chair round the brute
neck were a number of bright metal chain twelv in all and each of
these chain wa held by a spearman who ran alongsid six on on side
and six on the other lastli ingeni fasten to the end of hi
trunk were three other chain to which were attach spike knob of
metal
on he came as docil as ani indian eleph us for carri teak
log pass through the centr of the host up a wide lane which had
been left i suppos for hi conveni and intellig avoid the
pitfal fill with dead i thought that he would stop among the first
rank but not so slacken hi pace to a walk he march forward
toward our fortif now of cours i saw my chanc and made
sure that my doublebarrel eleph rifl wa readi and that han
held a second rifl also doublebarrel and of similar calibr
fullcock in such a posit that i could snatch it from him in a
moment
i am go to kill that eleph i said let no on els fire stand
still and you shall see the god jana die
still the enorm beast flounder forward up to that moment i had
never realiz how truli huge it wa not even when it stood over me in
the moonlight about to crush me with it foot of thi i am sure that
none to equal it ever live in africa at least in ani time of which i
have knowledg
fire baa whisper han it is near enough
but like the frenchman and the cock pheasant i determin to wait until
it stop wish to finish it with a singl ball if onli for the
prestig of the thing
at length it did stop and open it cavern of a mouth lift it
great trunk and trumpet while simba stand up in hi chair began
to shout out some command to us to surrend to the god jana the
invinc the invulner
i will show you if you ar invulner my boi said i to myself
glanc round to make sure that han had the second rifl readi and
catch sight of ragnal and hart and all the white kendah stand
up in their trench breathlessli await the end as were the black
kendah a few hundr yard awai never could there have been a fairer
shot and on more certain to result in a fatal wound the brute head
wa up and it mouth wa open all i had to do wa to send a hardtip
bullet crash through the palat to the brain behind it wa so easi
that i would have made a bet that i could have finish him with on
hand ti behind me
i lift the heavi rifl i got the sight dead on to a certain spot at
the back of that red cave i press the trigger the charg boomedand
noth happen i heard no bullet strike and jana did not even take
the troubl to close hi mouth
an exclam of ooh went up from the watcher befor it had
di awai the second bullet follow the first with the same result
or rather lack of result and anoth louder ooh aros then jana
tranquilli shut hi mouth have finish trumpet and as though
to give me a still better target turn broadsid on and stood quit
still
with an inward curs i snatch the second rifl and aim behind the
ear at a spot which long experi told me cover the heart let drive
again first on barrel and then the other
jana never stir no bullet thud no mark of blood appear upon
hi hide the horribl thought overcam me that i allan quatermain
i the famou shot the renown elephanthunt had four time miss
thi haystack of a brute from a distanc of forti yard so great wa
my shame that i think i almost faint through a kind of mist i heard
variou ejacul
great heaven said ragnal
allemagt remark han
the child help us mutter hart
all the rest of them stare at me as though i were a freak or a lunat
then somebodi laugh nervous and immedi everybodi began to
laugh even the distant armi of the black kendah becam convuls with
roar of unholi merriment and i allan quatermain wa the centr of
all thi mockeri till i felt as though i were go mad suddenli the
laughter ceas and onc more simba the king began to roar out someth
about jana the invinc and invulner to which the white kendah
repli with cri of magic and bewitch bewitch
ye yell simba no bullet can touch jana the god not even those
of the white lord who wa brought from far to kill him
han leap on to the top of the wall where he danc up and down like
an intox monkei and scream
then where is jana left ey did not my bullet put it out like a
lamp if jana is invulner why did my bullet put out hi left ey
han ceas from danc on the wall and steadi himself lift the
littl rifl intombi shout
let us see whether after all thi beast is a god or an eleph
then he touch the trigger and simultan with the report i heard
the bullet clap and saw blood appear on jana hide just by the veri
spot over the heart at which i had aim without result of cours the
soft ball driven from a smallbor rifl with a light charg of powder
wa far too weak to penetr to the vital probabl it did not do much
more than pierc through the skin and an inch or two of flesh behind it
still it effect upon thi invulner god were of a mark order
he whip round he lift hi trunk and scream with rage and pain
then off he lumber back toward hi own peopl at such a pace that
the attend who held the chain on either side of him were thrown
over and forc to leav go of him while the king and the priest upon
hi back could onli retain their seat by cling to the chair and the
rope about hi neck
the result wa satisfactori so far as the dispel of magic
illus went but it left me in a wors posit than befor sinc

chapter xx
allan weep
on thei came slowli and steadili preced by a cloud of skirmishersa
thousand or more of thesewho kept as open an order as the narrow
ground would allow and carri each of them a bundl of throw
spear arrang in loop or socket at the back of the shield when
these men were about a hundr yard awai we open fire and kill a
great number of them also some of the marshal troop behind but
thi did not stop them in the least for what could fifti rifl do
against a hord of brave barbarian who it seem had no fear of
death present their spear were fall among us and a few casualti
began to occur not mani becaus of the protect wall but still
some again and again we load and fire sweep awai those in front
of us but alwai other came to take their place final at some word
of command these light skirmish vanish except whose who were dead
or wound take shelter behind the advanc regiment which now were
within fifti yard of us
then after a momentari paus anoth command wa shout out and the
first regiment charg in three solid rank we fire a vollei point
blank into them and as it wa hopeless for fifti men to withstand such
an onslaught bolt dure the temporari confus that ensu take
refug as it had been arrang that we should do at a point of vantag
farther down the line of fortif whenc we maintain our
gall fire
now it wa that the main bodi of the white kendah came into action under
the leadership of ragnal and hart the enemi scrambl over the first
wall which we had just vacat to find themselv in a network of
other wall held by our spearmen in a narrow place where number gave no
great advantag
here the fight wa terribl and the loss of the attack great for
alwai as thei carri on entrench thei found anoth a few yard
in front of them out of which the defend could onli be driven at
much cost of life
two hour or more the battl went on thu in spite of the desper
resist which we offer the multitud of the black kendah who i
must sai fought magnific storm wall after wall leav hundr
of dead and wound to mark their difficult progress meanwhil i and
my riflemen rain bullet on them from certain posit which we had
select beforehand until at length our ammunit began to run low
at halfpast eight in the morn we were driven back over the open
ground to our last entrench a veri strong on just outsid of the
eastern gate of the templ which it will be rememb wa set in
a tunnel pierc through the natur lava rock thrice did the black
kendah come on and thrice we beat them off till the ditch in front of
the wall wa almost full of fallen as fast as thei climb to the top
of it the white kendah thrust them through with their long spear or we
shot them with our rifl the natur of the ground be such that onli
a direct frontal attack wa possibl
in the end thei drew back sullenli have as we hope given up the
assault as it turn out thi wa not so thei were onli rest
and wait for the arriv of their reserv it came up shout and
sing a warsong two thousand strong or more and present onc more
thei charg like a flood of water we beat them back thei reform and
charg a second time and we beat them back
then thei took anoth counsel stand among the dead and dy at the
base of the wall which wa built of loos stone and earth where we
could not easili get at them becaus of the shower of spear which
were rain at anyon who show himself thei began to undermin it
lever out the bottom stone with stake and batter them with
pole
in five minut a breach appear through which thei pour
tumultu it wa hopeless to withstand that onslaught of so vast a
number fight desper we were driven down the tunnel and through
the door that were open to us into the first court of the templ
by furiou effort we manag to close these door and block them
with stone and earth but thi did not avail us long for bring
brushwood and dry grass thei built a fire against them that soon caught
the thick cedar wood of which thei were made
while thei burn we consult togeth further retreat seem
imposs sinc the second court of the templ save for a narrow
passag wa fill with corn which allow no room for fight
while behind it were gather all the women and children more than two
thousand of them here or nowher we must make our stand and conquer
or die up to thi time compar with what which we had inflict upon
the black kendah of whom a coupl of thousand or more had fallen our
loss wa compar slight sai two hundr kill and as mani more
wound most of such of the latter as could not walk we had manag to
carri into the first court of the templ lai them close against the
cloister wall whenc thei watch us in a grisli ring
thi left us about sixteen hundr ablebodi men or mani more than we
could emploi with effect in that narrow place therefor we determin
to act upon a plan which we had alreadi design in case such an
emerg as our should aris about three hundr and fifti of the
best men were to remain to defend the templ till all were slain the
rest to the number of over a thousand were to withdraw through the
second court and the gate beyond to the camp of the women and children
these thei were to conduct by secret path that were known to them to
where the camel were kraal and mount as mani as possibl of
them on the camel to fly whither thei could our hope wa that the
victori black kendah would be too exhaust to follow them across the
plain to the distant mountain it wa a dread determin but we
had no choic
what of my wife ragnal ask hoars
while the templ stand she must remain in the templ repli hart
but when all is lost if i have fallen do you white lord go to the
sanctuari with those who remain and take her and the ivori child and
flee after the other onli i lai thi charg on you under pain of the
curs of heaven that you do not suffer the ivori child to fall into the
hand of the black kendah first must you burn it with fire or grind it
to dust with stone moreov i give thi command to all in case of
the priest in charg of it should fail me that thei set flame to the
brushwood that is built up with the stack of corn so that after all
those of our enemi who escap mai die of famin
instantli and without murmur for never did i see more perfect
disciplin than that which prevail among these poor peopl the order
given by hart who in addit to hi offic as head priest wa a kind
of presid of what wa in fact a republ were put in the wai of
execut compani by compani the men appoint to escort the women and
children depart through the gatewai of the second court each compani
turn in the gatewai to salut us who remain by rais their
spear till all were gone then we the three hundr and fifti who
were left marshal ourselv as the greek mai have done in the pass
of thermopyl
first stood i and my riflemen to whom all the remain ammunit wa
serv out it amount to eight round per man then rang across
the court in four line came the spearmen arm with lanc and sword
under the immedi command of hart behind these near the gate of the
second court so that at the last thei might attempt the rescu of the
priestess were fifti pick men captain by ragnal who i forgot
to sai wa wound in two place though not badli have receiv
a spear thrust in the left shoulder and a sword cut to the left thigh
dure hi desper defenc of the entrench
by the time that all wa readi and everi man had been given to drink
from the great jar of water which stood along the wall the massiv
wooden door began to burn through though thi did not happen for quit
half an hour after the enemi had begun to attempt to fire them thei
fell at length beneath the batter of pole leav onli the mound of
earth and stone which we had pile up in the gatewai after the close
of the door thi the black kendah who had rake out the burn
ember set themselv to dig awai with hand and stick and spear a
task that wa made veri difficult to them by about a score of our peopl
who stab at them with their long lanc or dash them down with
stone kill and disabl mani but alwai the dead and wound were
drag off while other took their place so that at last the gatewai
wa practic clear then i call back the spearmen who pass into
the rank behind us and made readi to plai my part
i had not long to wait with a rush and a roar a great compani of the
black kendah charg the gatewai just as thei began to emerg into the
court i gave the word to fire send fifti snider bullet tear into
them from a distanc of a few yard thei fell in a heap thei fell like
corn befor the scyth not a man won through quickli we reload and
wait for the next rush in due cours it came and the dread scene
repeat itself now the gatewai and the tunnel beyond were so choke
with fallen men that the enemi must drag these out befor thei could
charg ani more it wa done under the fire of myself han and a few
pick shotssomehow it wa done
onc more thei charg and onc more were mown down so it went on
till our last cartridg wa spent for never did i see more magnific
courag than wa shown by those black kendah in the face of terrif
loss then my peopl threw asid their useless rifl and arm
themselv with spear and sword fell back to rest leav hart and
hi compani to take their place for half an hour or more rage that
aw struggl sinc the spot be so narrow charg as thei would
the black kendah could not win through the spear of despair
warrior defend their live and the sanctuari of their god nor the
encircl cliff be so sheer could thei get round ani other wai
at length the enemi drew back as though defeat give us time to drag
asid our dead and wound and drink more water for the heat in the
place wa now overwhelm we hope against hope that thei had given up
the attack but thi wa far from the case thei were but make a new
plan
suddenli in the gatewai there appear the huge bulk of the eleph
jana rush forward at speed and be urg on by men who prick it
with spear behind it swept through the defend as though thei were
but dry grass batter those in front of it with it great trunk
from which swung the iron ball that crush all on whom thei fell and
pai no more heed to the lanc thrust than it might have done to the
bite of gnat on it came trumpet and trampl and after it in a
flood flow the black kendah upon whom our spearmen flung themselv
from either side
at the time i follow by han wa just return from speak with
ragnal at the gate of the second court a littl befor i had retir
exhaust from the fierc and fear fight whereon he took my place
and repel sever of the black kendah charg includ the last in
thi frai he receiv a further injuri a knock on the head from a stick
or stone which stun him for a few minut whereon some of our peopl
had carri him off and set him on the ground with hi back against on
of the pillar of the second gate be told that he wa hurt i ran
to see what wa the matter find to my joi that it wa noth veri
seriou i wa hurri to the front again when i look up and saw that
devil jana charg straight toward me the throng of arm men part
on each side of him as rough water doe befor the leap prow of a
stormdriven ship
to tell the truth although i wa never fond of unnecessari risk i
rejoic at the sight not even all the excit of that hideou and
prolong battl had obliter from my mind the burn sens of shame
at the exhibit which i had made of myself by miss thi beast with
four barrel at forti yard
now thought i to myself with a kind of exult thrill now jana
i will wipe out both my disgrac and you thi time there shall be no
mistak or if there is let it be my last
on thunder jana whirl the iron ball among the soldier who fled
to right and left leav a clear path between me and him to make quit
sure of thing for i wa trembl a littl with fatigu and somewhat
sick from the continu sight of bloodsh i knelt down upon my right
knee us the other as a prop for my left elbow and sinc i could
not make certain of a head shot becaus of the continu whirl of
the huge trunk got the sight of my biggam rifl dead on to the beast
where the throat join the chest i hope that the heavi conic
bullet would either pierc through to the spine or cut on of the larg
arteri in the neck or at least that the tremend shock of it
impact would bring him down
at about twenti pace i fire and hitnot jana but the lame priest who
wa fulfil the offic of mahout perch upon hi shoulder mani
feet abov the point at which i had aim ye i hit him in the head
which wa shatter like an eggshel so that he fell lifeless to the
ground
in perfect desper again i aim and fire when jana wa not more
than thirti feet awai thi time the bullet must have gone wide to
the left for i saw a chip fly from the end of the anim broken and
deform tusk which stuck out in that direct sever feet clear of
it side
then i gave up all hope there wa no time to gain my feet and escap
inde i did not wish to do so who felt that there ar some failur
which can onli be absolv by death i just knelt there wait for the
end
in an instant the giant creatur wa almost over me i rememb look
up at it and think in a queer sort of a wayperhap it wa some
ancestr memorythat i wa a littl apelik child about to be slain
by a primordi eleph thrice as big as ani that now inhabit the
earth then someth appear to happen which i onli repeat to show how
at such moment absurd and imposs thing seem real to us
the reader mai rememb the strang dream which han had relat to me
that morn
on incid of thi phantasi wa that he had met the spirit of the zulu
ladi mameena whom i knew in bygon year and that she bade him tell me
she would be with me in the battl and that i wa to look for her when
death drew near to me and jana thunder on for then perchanc i
should see her
well no doubt in some lightn flash of thought the memori of these
word occur to me at thi junctur with the ridicul result that
my subject intellig if that is the right term actual creat
the scene which thei describ as clearli or perhap more clearli than
ever i saw anyth els in my life i appear to behold the beauti
mameena in her fur cloak and her blue bead stand between jana and
myself with her arm fold upon her breast and look exactli as she
did in the tremend moment of her death befor king panda i even
note how the faint breez stir a loos end of her outspread hair
and how the sunlight caught a particular point of a copper bangl on her
upper arm
so she stood or rather seem to stand quit still and as it
happen at that moment the giant jana either becaus someth had
frighten him or perhap ow to the shock of my bullet strike on
hi tusk have jar the brain suddenli pull up slide along a
littl with all hi four feet togeth till i thought he wa go to
sit down like a perform eleph then it appear to me as though
mameena turn round veri slowli bent toward me whisper someth
which i could not hear although her lip move look at me sweetli
with those wonder ey of her and vanish awai
a fraction of a second later all thi vision had gone and someth that
wa no vision took it place jana had recov himself and wa at me
again with open mouth and lift trunk i heard a dutch curs and saw
a littl yellow form saw han for it wa he thrust the barrel of
my second eleph rifl almost into that red cave of a mouth which
howev thei could not reach and fire first on barrel then the
other
anoth moment and the mighti trunk had wrap itself about han and
hurl him through the air to fall on to hi head and arm thirti or
forti feet awai
jana stagger as though he too were about to fall recov himself
swerv to the right perhap to follow han stumbl on a few pace
miss me altogeth then again came to a standstil i wriggl
myself round and seat on the pavement of the court watch what
follow and glad am i that i wa abl to do so for never shall i
behold such anoth scene
first i saw ragnal run up with a rifl and fire two barrel at the
brute head of which he took no notic whatsoev then i saw hi
wife who in thi land wa known as the guardian of the child issu
from the portal of the second court dress in her goddess robe
wear the cap of bird feather attend by the two priestess also
dress as goddess as we had seen her on the morn of sacrific
and hold in front of her the statu of the ivori child
on she came quit quietli her wide empti ey fix upon jana as she
advanc the monster seem to grow uneasi turn hi head he lift
hi trunk and thrust it along hi back until it grip the ankl of the
king simba who all thi while wa seat there in hi chair make no
movement
with a slow steadi pull he drag simba from the chair so that he fell
upon the ground near hi left foreleg next veri composedli he wound hi
trunk about the bodi of the helpless man whose horrifi ey i can see
to thi dai and began to whirl him round and round in the air gentli
at first but with a motion that grew ever more rapid until the bright
chain on the victim breast flash in the sunlight like a silver
wheel then he hurl him to the ground where the poor king lai a mere
shatter pulp that had been human
now the priestess wa stand in front of the beastgod appar
quit without fear though her two attend had fallen back ragnal
sprang forward as though to drag her awai but a dozen men leapt on to
him and held him fast either to save hi life or for some secret reason
of their own which i never learn
jana look down at her and she look up at jana then he scream
furious and shoot out hi trunk snatch the ivori child from her
hand whirl it round as he had whirl simba and at last dash it
to the stone pavement as he had dash simba so that it substanc
grown brittl on the passag of the ag shatter into ten thousand
fragment
at thi sight a great groan went up from the men of the white kendah
the women dress as goddess shriek and tore their robe and hart
who stood near fell down in a fit or faint
onc more jana scream then slowli he knelt down beat hi trunk and
the clatter metal ball upon the ground thrice as though he were
make obeis to the beauti priestess who stood befor him
shiver throughout hi mighti bulk and roll overdead
the fight ceas the black kendah who all thi while had been
press into the court of the templ saw and stood stupefi it wa
as though in the presenc of event to them so pregnant and terribl men
could no longer lift their sword in war
a voic call the god is dead the king is dead jana ha slain simba
and ha himself been slain shatter is the child spilt is the blood
of jana fly peopl of the black kendah fly for the god ar dead and
your land is a land of ghost
from everi side wa thi wail echo fly peopl of the black kendah
for the god ar dead
thei turn thei sped awai like shadow carri their wound with
them nor did ani attempt to stai them thirti minut later save for
some desper hurt or dy men not on of them wa left in the
templ or the pass beyond thei had all gone leav none but the dead
behind them
the fight wa finish the fight that had seem lost wa won
i drag myself from the ground as i gain my totter feet for now
that all wa over i felt as if i were made of run water i saw the
men who held ragnal loos their grip of him he sprang to where hi
wife wa and stood befor her as though confus much as jana had
stood jana against whose head he rest hi left hand hold to the
brute gigant tusk for i think that he also wa weak with toil
terror loss of blood and emot
luna he gasp luna
lean on the shoulder of a kendah man i drew nearer to see what
pass between them for my curios overcam my faint for quit a
long while she stare at him till suddenli her ey began to chang it
wa as though a soul were aris in their empti as the moon aris
in the quiet even sky give them light and life at length she
spoke in a slow hesit voic the tone of which i rememb well
enough sai
oh georg that dread brute and she point to the dead eleph
ha kill our babi look at it look at it we must be everyth to
each other now dear as we were befor it cameunless god send us
anoth
then she burst into a flood of weep and fell into hi arm after
which i turn awai so to their honour be it said did the kendah
leav the pair alon behind the bulk of dead jana
here i mai state two thing first that ladi ragnal whose bodili
health had remain perfect throughout entir recov her reason
from that moment it wa as though on the shatter of the ivori child
some spell had been lift off her what thi spell mai have been i am
quit unabl to explain but i presum that in a dim and unknown wai she
connect thi effigi with her own lost infant and that while she held
and tend it her intellect remain in abey if so she must also
have connect it destruct with the death of her own child which
strang enough it will be rememb wa likewis kill by an
eleph the first death that occur in her presenc took awai her
reason the second seem death which also occur in her presenc
brought it back again
secondli from the moment of the destruct of her boi in the street
of the english countri town to that of the shatter of the ivori child
in central africa her memori wa an utter blank with on except
thi except wa a dream which a few dai later she narrat to
ragnal in my presenc that dream wa that she had seen him and savag
sleep togeth in a nativ hous on night in view of a certain
incid record in thi histori i leav the reader to draw hi own
conclus as to thi curiou incid i have none to offer or if i
have i prefer to keep them to myself
leav ragnal and hi wife i stagger off to look for han and found
him ly senseless near the north wall of the templ evid he wa
beyond human help for jana seem to have crush most of hi rib in
hi iron trunk we carri him to on of the priest cell and there i
watch him till the end which came at sundown
befor he di he becam quit consciou and talk with me a good deal
dont griev about miss jana baa he said for it wasnt you who
miss him but some devil that turn your bullet you see baa he
wa bewitch against you white men when you look at him close you
will find that the lord igeza miss him also strang as it mai seem
thi prove to be the case and when you manag to hit the tip of hi
tusk with the last ball the magic wa wear off him that all
but baa those black kendah wizard forgot to bewitch him against
the littl yellow man of whom thei took no account so i hit him sure
enough everi time i fire at him and i hope he like the tast of my
bullet in that great mouth of hi he knew who had sent them there veri
well that why he left you alon and made for me as i had hope he
would oh baa i die happi quit happi sinc i have kill jana and
he caught me and not you me who wa nearli finish anyhow for baa
though i didnt sai anyth about it a thrown spear struck my groin
when i went down among the black kendah thi morn it wa onli a
small cut which bled littl but as the fight went on someth gave
wai and my insid began to come through it though i ti it up with a
bit of cloth which of cours mean death in a dai or two subsequ
examin show me that hanss stori of thi wound wa perfectli
true he could not have live for veri long
baa he went on after a paus no doubt i shall meet that zulu ladi
mameena tonight tell me is she realli entitl to the royal salut
becaus if not when i am as much a spook as she is i will not give it
to her again she never gave me my titl which ar good on in their
wai so why should i give her the bayt unless it is her by right
of blood although i am onli a littl yellow dog as she chose to call
me
as thi ridicul point seem to weigh upon hi mind i told him that
mameena wa not even of royal blood and in nowis entitl to the salut
of king
ah he said with a feebl grin then now i shall know how to deal
with her especi as she cannot pretend that i did not plai my part
in the battl as she bade me do did you see anyth of her when jana
charg baa becaus i thought i did
i seem to see someth but no doubt it wa onli a fanci
a fanci explain to me baa where truth end and fanci begin and
whether what we think ar fanci ar not sometim the real truth
onc or twice i have thought so of late baa
i could not answer thi riddl so instead i gave him some water which
he ask for and he continu
baa have you ani messag for the two shine on for her whose
name is holi and her sister and for the child of her whose name is
holi the missi mari and for your reverend father the predik if
so tell it quickli befor my head grow too empti to hold the word
i will confess howev foolish it mai seem that i gave him certain
messag but what thei were i shall not write down let them remain
secret between me and him ye between me and him and perhap those to
whom thei were to be deliv for after all in hi own word who
can know exactli where fanci end and truth begin and whether at time
fanci ar not the verit truth in thi univers mysteri of which
the individu life of each of us is so small a part
han repeat what i had spoken to him word for word as a nativ doe
repeat it twice over after which he said he knew it by heart and
remain silent for a long while then he ask me to lift him up in
the doorwai of the cell so that he might look at the sun set for
the last time for baa he ad i think i am go far beyond the
sun
he stare at it for a while remark that from the look of the sky
there should be fine weather come which will be good for your
journei toward the black water baa with all that ivori to carri
i answer that perhap i should never get the ivori from the graveyard
of the eleph as the black kendah might prevent thi
no no baa he repli now that jana is dead the black kendah will
go awai i know it i know it
then he wander for a space speak of sundri adventur we had
share togeth till quit befor the last inde when hi mind
return to him
baa he said did not the captain mavovo name me lightindark
and is not that my name when you too enter the dark look for that
light it will be shine veri close to you
he onli spoke onc more hi word were
baa i understand now what your reverend father the predik meant
when he spoke to me about love last night it had noth to do with
women baa at least not much it wa someth a great deal bigger
baa someth as big as what i feel for you
then han di with a smile on hi wrinkl face
i wept
chapter xxi
homeward
there is not much more to write of thi expedit or if that statement
be not strictli true not much more that i wish to write though i have
no doubt that ragnal if he had a mind that wai could make a good and
valuabl book concern mani matter on which confin myself to the
histori of our adventur i have scarc touch all the affin
between thi central african worship of the heavenli child and
it guardian and that of horu and isi in egypt from which it wa
undoubtedli descend for instanc also the part which the great
serpent plai therein as it mai be seen plai a part in everi tomb
upon the nile and inde plai a part in our own and other religion
further our journei across the desert to the red sea wa veri
interest but i am tire of describ journeysand of make them
the truth is that after the death of han like to queen sheba when she
had survei the wonder of solomon court there wa no more spirit in
me for quit a long while i did not seem to care at all what happen
to me or to anybodi els we buri him in a place of honour exactli
where he shot jana befor the gatewai of the second court and when the
earth wa thrown over hi littl yellow face i felt as though half my
past had depart with him into that hole poor drunken old han where
in the world shall i find such anoth man as you were where in the
world shall i find so much love as fill the cup of that strang heart
of your
i dare sai it is a form of selfish but what everi man desir is
someth that care for him alon which is just why we ar so fond
of dog now han wa a dog with a human brain and he care for me
alon often our vaniti make us think that thi ha happen to some of
us in the instanc of on or more women but honest and quiet reflect
mai well caus us to doubt the truth of such suppos the woman who
as we believ ador us sole ha probabl in the cours of her career
ador other or at ani rate other thing
to take but on instanc that of mameena the zulu ladi whom han
thought he saw in the shade she i believ did me the honour to be
veri fond of me but i am convinc that she wa fonder still of her
ambit now han never care for ani live creatur or for ani human
hope or object as he care for me there wa no man or woman whom
he would not have cheat or even murder for my sake there wa no
earthli advantag down to that of life itself that he would not and
in the end did not forgo for my sake wit the case of hi littl
fortun which he invest in my rotten gold mine and thought noth of
losingfor my sake
that is love in excelsi and the man who ha succeed in inspir
it in ani creatur even in a low bibul old hottentot mai feel
proud inde at least i am proud and as the year go by the pride
increas as the hope grow that somewher in the quiet of that great
plain which he saw in hi dream i mai find the light of hanss love
burn like a beacon in the dark as he promis i should do and
that it mai guid and warm my shiver newborn soul befor i dare the
adventur of the infinit
meanwhil sinc the sublim and the ridicul ar so veri near akin
i often wonder how he and mameena settl that question of her right to
the royal salut perhap i shall learn on dayinde alreadi i have
had a hint of it if so even in the blaze of a new and univers truth
i am certain that their stori will differ wildli
han wa quit right about the black kendah thei clear out probabl
in search of food where i do not know and i do not care though whether
thi were a temporari or perman move on their part remain and so
far as i am concern is like to remain veil in obscur thei
were great blackguard though extraordinarili fine soldier and what
becam of them is a matter of complet indiffer to me on thing is
certain howev a veri larg percentag of them never migrat at all
for someth over three thousand of their bodi did our peopl have to
buri in the pass and about the templ a purpos for which all the pit
and trench we had dug came in veri us our loss by the wai wa
five hundr and three includ those who di of wound it wa a
great fight and except for those who perish in the pitfal dure
the first rush all practic hand to hand
jana we inter where he fell becaus we could not move him within a
few feet of the bodi of hi slayer han i have alwai regret that
i did not take the exact measur of thi brute as i believ the
record eleph of the world but i had no time to do so and no rule or
tape at hand i onli saw him for a minut on the follow morn just
as he wa be tumbl into a huge hole togeth with the remain of
hi master simba the king i found howev that the sole wound upon
him save some cut and scratch from spear were those inflict by
hansnam the loss of on ey the punctur through the skin over
the heart made when he shot at him for the second time with the littl
rifl intombi and two neat hole at the back of the mouth through which
the bullet from the eleph gun had driven upward to the base of the
brain caus hi death from hmorrhag on that organ
i ask the white kendah to give me hi two enorm tusk unequal
i suppos in size and weight in africa although on wa deform
and broken but thei refus these i presum thei wish to keep
togeth with the chain off hi breast and trunk as memento of their
victori over the god of their foe at ani rate thei hew the former
out with ax and remov the latter befor tumbl the carcass into
the grave from the worndown state of the teeth i conclud that thi
beast must have been extraordinarili old how old it is imposs to
sai
that is all i have to tell of jana mai he rest in peac which
certainli he will not do if han dwell anywher in hi neighbourhood
in the region which the old boi us to call that of the fire that
do not go out becaus of my horribl failur in connect with thi
beast the veri memori of which humili me i do not like to think of
it more than i can help
for the rest the white kendah kept faith with us in everi particular in
a curiou and semireligi ceremoni at which i wa not present ladi
ragnal wa absolv from her high offic of guardian or nurs to a god
whereof the symbol no longer exist though i believ that the priest
collect the tini fragment of ivori or as mani of them as could be
found and preserv them in a jar in the sanctuari after thi had
been done women strip the nurs of her hallow robe of the ancient
origin of which by the wai i believ that none of them except perhap
hart had ani idea ani more than thei knew that the child repres
the egyptian horu and hi ladi guardian the moongoddess isi then
dress in some nativ garment she wa hand over to ragnal and
thenceforth treat as a strangerguest like ourselv be allow
howev to live with her husband in the same hous that she had
occupi dure all the period of her strang captiv here thei abod
togeth lost in the mutual bliss of thi wonder reunion to which
thei had attain through so much bodili and spiritu dark and
miseri until a month or so later we start upon our journei across the
mountain and the great desert that lai beyond them
onli onc did i find ani real opportun of privat convers with
ladi ragnal
thi happen after her husband had recov from the hurt he receiv
in the battl on an occas when he wa oblig to separ from her
for a dai in order to attend to some matter in the town of the child
i think it had to do with the rifl us in the battl which he had
present to the white kendah so leav me to look after her he
went unwillingli enough who seem to hate lose sight of hi wife
even for an hour
i took her for a walk in the wood to that veri point inde on the lip
of the crater whenc we had watch her plai her part as priestess at
the feast of the firstfruit after we had stood there a while we went
down among the great cedar try to retrac the last part of our
march through the dark of that anxiou night whereof now for the
first time i told her all the stori
grow tire of scrambl among the fallen bough at length ladi
ragnal sat down and said
do you know mr quatermain these ar the first word we have realli
had sinc that parti at ragnal befor i wa marri when as you mai
have forgotten you took me in to dinner
i repli that there wa noth i recollect much more clearli which
wa both true and the right thing to sai or so i suppos
well she said slowli you see that after all there wa someth in
those fanci of mine which at the time you thought would best be dealt
with by a doctorabout africa and the rest i mean
ye ladi ragnal though of cours we should alwai rememb that
coincid account for mani thing in ani case thei ar done with
now
not quit mr quatermain even as you mean sinc we have still a long
wai to go also in anoth sens i believ that thei ar but begun
i do not understand ladi ragnal
nor do i but listen you know that of anyth which happen dure
those month i have no memori at all except of that on dream when i
seem to see georg and savag in the hut i rememb my babi be
kill by that horribl circu eleph just as the ivori child wa
kill or rather destroi by jana which i suppos is anoth of your
coincid mr quatermain after that i rememb noth until i woke
up and saw georg stand in front of me cover with blood and you
and jana dead and the rest
becaus dure that time your mind wa gone ladi ragnal
ye but where had it gone i tell you mr quatermain that although
i rememb noth of what wa pass about me then i do rememb a
great deal of what seem to be pass either long ago or in some time
to come though i have said noth of it to georg as i hope you will
not either it might upset him
what do you rememb i ask
that the troubl i cant tell you what wa onc veri clear to me
ha for the most part becom vagu and formless when my mind tri to
grasp it it slip awai it wa anoth life to thi quit a differ
life and there wa a great stori in it of which i think what we have
been go through is either a sequel or a prologu i see or saw
citi and templ with peopl move about them georg and you among
them also that old priest hart you will laugh but my recollect
is that you stood in some relationship to me either that of father or
brother
or perhap a cousin i suggest
or perhap a cousin she repeat smile or a great friend at ani
rate someth veri intim as for georg i dont know what he wa
or hart either but the odd thing is that littl yellow man han whom
i onli saw onc live for a few minut that i can rememb come more
clearli back to my mind than ani of you he wa a dwarf much stouter
than when i saw him the other dai but veri like i recal him curious
dress with feather and hold an ivori rod seat upon a stool
at the feet of a great personagea king i think the king ask him
question and everyon listen to hi answer that is all except
that the scene seem to be flood with sunlight
which is more than thi place is i think we had better be move ladi
ragnal or you will catch a chill under these damp cedar
i said thi becaus i did not wish to pursu the convers i
consid it too excit under all her circumst especi as i
perceiv that mystic look gather on her face and in her beauti
ey which i rememb note befor she wa marri
she read my thought and answer with a laugh
ye it is damp but you know i am veri strong and damp will not hurt
me for the rest you need not be afraid mr quatermain i did not lose
my mind it wa taken from me by some power and sent to live elsewher
now it ha been given back and i do not think it will be taken again in
that wai
of cours it wont i exclaim confid whoever dream of such
a thing
you did she answer look me in the ey now befor we go i
want to sai on more thing hart and the head priestess have made me a
present thei have given me a box full of that herb thei call tobacco
but of which i have discov the real name is taduki it is the same
that thei burn in the bowl when you and i saw vision at ragnal
castl which vision mr quatermain by anoth of your coincid
have sinc been translat into fact
i know we saw you breath that smoke again as priestess when you
utter the propheci as oracl of the child at the feast of the
firstfruit but what ar you go to do with thi stuff ladi
ragnal i think you have had enough of vision just at present
so do i though to tell you the truth i like them i am go to keep
it and do nothinga yet still i want you alwai to rememb on
thingdont laugh at meher again she look me in the eyesthat
there is a time come some wai off i think when i and youno on
els mr quatermainwil breath that smoke again togeth and see
strang thing
no no i repli i have given up tobacco of the kendah varieti it
is too strong for me
ye ye she said for someth that is stronger than the kendah
tobacco will make you do itwhen i wish
did hart tell you that ladi ragnal
i dont know she answer confusedli i think the ivori child
told me it us to talk to me often you know that child isnt realli
destroi like my reason that seem to be lost it ha onli gone
backward or forward where you and i shall see it again you and i and
no othersunless it be the littl yellow man i repeat that i do not
know when that will be perhap it is written in those roll of papyru
which thei have given me also becaus thei said thei belong to me
who am the first priestess and the last thei told me howev or
perhap she ad pass her hand across her forehead it wa the
child who told me that i wa not to attempt to read them or have them
read until after a great chang in my life what the chang will be i
do not know
and had better not inquir ladi ragnal sinc in thi world most
chang ar for the wors
i agre and shall not inquir now i have spoken to you like thi
becaus i felt that i must do so also i want to thank you for all you
have done for me and georg probabl we shall not talk in such a wai
again as i am situat the opportun will be lack even if the
wish is present so onc more i thank you from my heart until we meet
againi mean realli meetgoodby and she held her right hand to me
in such a fashion that i knew she meant me to kiss it
thi i did veri rever and we walk back to the templ almost in
silenc
that month of rest or rather the last three week of it sinc for the
first few dai after the battl i wa quit prostrat i occupi in
variou wai amongst other in a journei with hart to simba town thi
we made after our spi had assur us that the black kendah were
realli gone somewher to the southwest in which direct fertil and
unoccupi land were said to exist about three hundr mile awai it
wa with veri strang feel that i retrac our road and look onc
more upon that windbent tree still score with the mark of jana
huge tusk in the bough of which han and i had taken refug from the
monster furi cross the river quit low now i travel up the
slope down which we race for our live and came to the melancholi lake
and the cemeteri of dead eleph
here all wa unchang there wa the littl mount worn by hi feet on
which jana wa wont to stand there were the rock behind which i had
tri to hide and near to them some crush human bone which i knew to
be those of the unfortun mart these we buri with due rever on
the spot where he had fallen i meanwhil thank god that my own bone
were not be inter at their side as but for han would have been
the caseif thei were ever inter at all all about lai the skeleton
of dead eleph and from among these we collect as much of the best
ivori as we could carri name about fifti camel load of cours there
wa much more but a great deal of the stuff had been expos for so
long to sun and weather that it wa almost worthless
have sent thi ivori back to the town of the child which wa be
rebuilt after a fashion we went on to simba town through the forest
dispatch picket ahead of us to search and make sure that it wa
empti empti it wa inde never did i see such a place of desol
the black kendah had left it just as it stood except for a pile of
corps which lai around and over the altar in the marketplac where
the three poor camelmen were sacrif to jana doubtless those of
wound men who had di dure or after the retreat the door of the
hous stood open mani domest articl such as great jar resembl
that which had been set over the head of the dead man whom we were
command to restor life and other furnitur lai about becaus thei
could not be carri awai so did a great quantiti of spear and variou
weapon of war whose owner be kill would never want them again
except a few starv dog and jackal no live creatur remain in the
town it wa in it own wai as wast and even more impress than the
graveyard of eleph by the lone lake
the curs of the child work well said hart to me grimli first
the storm the hunger then the battl and now the miseri of flight and
ruin
it seem so i answer yet that curs like other came back to
roost for if jana is dead and hi peopl fled where ar the child and
mani of it peopl what will you do without your god hart
repent us of our sin and wait till the heaven send us anoth as
doubtless thei will in their own season he repli veri sadli
i wonder whether thei ever did and if so what form that new divin
put on
i slept or rather did not sleep that night in the same guesthous in
which mart and i had been imprison dure our dread dai of fear
reconstruct in my mind everi event connect with them onc more i
saw the fire of sacrific flare upon the altar and heard the roar of
the danc hail that proclaim the ruin of the black kendah as loudli
as the trumpet of a destroi angel veri glad wa i when the morn
came at length and have look my last upon simba town i cross
the moat and set out homeward through the forest whereof the strip
bough also spoke of death though in the spring these would grow green
again
ten dai later we start from the holi mount a caravan of about a
hundr camel of which fifti were laden with the ivori and the rest
ridden by our escort under the command of hart and our three selv
but there wa an evil fate upon thi ivori as on everyth els that
had to do with jana some week later in the desert a great sandstorm
overtook us in which we bare escap with our live at the height of
the storm the ivoryladen camel broke loos fly befor it probabl
thei fell and were buri beneath the sand at ani rate of the fifti we
onli recov ten
ragnal wish to pai me the valu of the remain load which ran
into thousand of pound but i would not take the monei sai it
wa outsid our bargain sometim sinc then i have thought that i
wa foolish especi when on glanc at that codicil to hi will in
after dai the same which he had given me befor the battl i found
that he had set me down for a legaci of 10000 but in such matter
everi man must follow hi own instinct
the white kendah an unemot peopl especi now when thei were
mourn for their lost god and their dead watch us go without ani
demonstr of affect or even of farewel onli those priestess
who had attend upon the person of ladi ragnal while she plai a
divin part among them wept when thei part from her and utter
prayer that thei might meet her again in the presenc of the child
the pass through the great mountain prove hard to climb as the
foothold for the camel wa bad but we manag it at last most of the
wai on foot paus a littl while on their crest to look our last for
ever at the land which we had left where the mount of the child wa
still dimli visibl then we descend their farther slope and enter
the northern desert
dai after dai and week after week we travel across that endless
desert by a wai known to hart on which water could be found the onli
live thing in all it vast meet with no accid save that
of the sandstorm in which the ivori wa lost i wa much alon dure
that time sinc hart spoke littl and ragnal and hi wife were
wrap up in each other
at length month later we struck a littl port on the red sea of
which i forget the arab name a place as hot as the infern region
shortli afterward by great good luck two trade vessel put in for
water on bound for aden in which i embark en rout for natal and
the other for the port of suez whenc ragnal and hi wife could travel
overland to alexandria
our part wa so hurri at the last as is often the wai after long
fellowship that beyond mutual thank and good wish we said littl
to on anoth i can see them now stand with their arm about each
other watch me disappear concern their futur there is so much
to tell that of it i shall sai noth at ani rate here and now except
that ladi ragnal wa right we did not part for the last time
as i shook old hart hand in farewel he told me that he wa go on
to egypt and i ask him why
perchanc to look for anoth god lord macumazana he answer
grave whom now there is no jana to destroi we mai speak of that
matter if we should meet again
such ar some of the thing that i rememb about thi journei but to
tell truth i paid littl attent to them and mani other
for oh my heart wa sore becaus of han
