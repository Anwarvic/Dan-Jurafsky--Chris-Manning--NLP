lend it enchant and these gallant brethren would have

still let us hold otherwis though we grow grei and know the
world for what it is let us for a littl time think as we
thought while we were young when faith knew no fear for
anyth and death had not knock upon our door when you

which lead to the bless kingdom of romanc
at the least i am sure and i believ that you my sister will

a pictur howev faint and broken of the long war between
cross and crescent wage among the syrian plain and desert of
christian knight and ladi also and their love and suffer

salaheddin command of the faith the king strong to aid
sovereign of the east sat at night in hi palac at damascu and
brood on the wonder wai of god by whom he had been lift
to hi high estat he rememb how when he wa but small in
the ey of men noureddin king of syria forc him to
accompani hi uncl shirkuh to egypt whither he went like
on driven to hi death and how against hi own will there he
rose to great he thought of hi father the wise ayoub and
the brethren with whom he wa brought up all of them dead now
save on and of hi sister whom he had cherish most of all
did he think of her zobeid who had been stolen awai by the
knight whom she love even to the loss of her own souly by
the english friend of hi youth hi father prison sir
andrew darci who led astrai by passion had done him and hi
hous thi grievou wrong he had sworn he rememb that he
would bring her back even from england and alreadi had plan
to kill her husband and captur her when he learn her death
she had left a child or so hi spi told him who if she still
live must be a woman nowhi own niec though half of nobl
english blood
then hi mind wander from thi old halfforgotten stori to the
woe and blood in which hi dai were set and to the last great
struggl between the follow of the prophet jesu and mahomet
that jihad holi war for which he made readyand he sigh for
he wa a merci man who love not slaughter although hi
fierc faith drove him from war to war
salaheddin slept and dream of peac in hi dream a maiden
stood befor him present when she lift her veil he saw
that she wa beauti with featur like hi own but fairer
and knew her sure for the daughter of hi sister who had fled
with the english knight now he wonder why she visit him
thu and in hi vision prai allah to make the matter clear
then of a sudden he saw thi same woman stand befor him on a
syrian plain and on either side of her a countless host of
saracen and frank of whom thousand and ten of thousand were

hi squadron scimitar aloft but she held up her hand and
stai him

peac to your sin soul o king and with that outstretch
hand she drew down hi keenedg scimitar until it rest on her
breast
salaheddin awok and marvel on hi dream but said noth
of it to ani man the next night it return to him and the
memori of it went with him all the dai that follow but still he
said noth
when on the third night he dream it yet again even more
vividli then he wa sure that thi thing wa from god and

shed a sea of blood and bring rest upon the land we charg
you therefor draw thi ladi to your court and keep her ever
by your side sinc if she escap you her peac goe with her
salaheddin said that thi interpret wa wise and true for
thu also he had read hi dream then he summon a certain
fals knight who bore the cross upon hi breast but in secret
had accept the koran a frankish spy of hi who came from that
countri where dwelt the maiden hi niec and from him learn
about her her father and her home with him and anoth spy
who pass as a christian palmer by the aid of princ hassan
on of the greatest and most trust of hi emir he made a
cun plan for the captur of the maiden if she would not come
willingli and for her bear awai to syria
moreoverthat in the ey of all men her digniti might be worthi
of her high blood and fatebi hi decre he creat her the
niec whom he had never seen princess of baalbec with great
possessionsa rule that her grandfath ayoub and her uncl
izzeddin had held befor her also he purchas a stout gallei

these thing did yusuf salaheddin and wait patient till it
should pleas god to accomplish the vision with which god had

chapter on by the water of death creek
from the seawal on the coast of essex rosamund look out
across the ocean eastward to right and left but a littl
behind her like guard attend the person of their sovereign
stood her cousin the twin brethren godwin and wulf tall and
shape men godwin wa still as a statu hi hand fold over
the hilt of the long scabbard sword of which the point wa
set on the ground befor him but wulf hi brother move
restlessli and at length yawn aloud thei were beauti to
look at all three of them as thei appear in the splendour of
their youth and health the imperi rosamund darkhair and
ei ivori skin and slenderwaist a posi of marsh flower

at the sound of that unstifl yawn rosamund turn her head
with the slow grace which mark her everi movement
would you sleep alreadi wulf and the sun not yet down she
ask in her rich low voic which perhap becaus of it
foreign accent seem quit differ to that of ani other
woman

time and now that you have finish gather those yellow
flower which we rode so far to seek the timei somewhat
long
shame on you wulf she said smile look upon yonder sea and
sky at that sheet of bloom all gold and purpl
i have look for hard on half an hour cousin rosamund also at
your back and at godwin left arm and sidefac till in truth i
thought myself kneel in stangat priori stare at my father
effigi upon hi tomb while prior john patter the mass why
if you stood it on it feet it is godwin the same cross hand
rest on the sword the same cold silent face stare at the
sky
godwin as godwin will no doubt on dai be or so he hopesthat
is if the saint give him grace to do such deed as did our
sire interrupt hi brother
wulf look at him and a curiou flash of inspir shone in
hi blue ey

greater but sure you will lie wrap not in a shirt of mail
but with a monk cowl at the lastunless a woman rob you of it
and the quickest road to heaven tell me now what ar you
think of you twofor i have been wonder in my dull wai
and am curiou to learn how far i stand from truth rosamund
speak first nai not all the trutha maid thought ar her
ownbut just the cream of it that which rise to the top and
should be skim
rosamund sigh i i wa think of the east where the sun
shine ever and the sea ar blue as my girdl stone and men
ar full of strang learn
and women ar men slave interrupt wulf still it is
natur that you should think of the east who have that blood in
your vein and high blood if all tale be true sai
princessand he bow the knee to her with an affect of
mockeri which could not hide hi earnest reverencesai
princess my cousin granddaught of ayoub and niec of the
mighti monarch yusuf salaheddin do you wish to leav thi
pale land and visit your dominion in egypt and in syria
she listen and at hi word her ey seem to take fire the
state form to erect itself the breast to heav and the thin
nostril to grow wider as though thei scent some sweet
rememb perfum inde at that moment stand there on
the promontori abov the sea rosamund look a veri queen
present she answer him with anoth question
and how would thei greet me there wulf who am a norman darci
and a christian maid
the first thei would forgiv you sinc that blood is none so
ill either and for the secondwhi faith can be chang
then it wa that godwin spoke for the first time

there ar thing that should not be said even as a silli jest
see you i love my cousin here better than aught els upon the
earth
there at least we agre broke in wulf
better than aught els on the earth repeat godwin but by
the holi blood and by st peter at whose shrine we ar i would
kill her with my own hand befor her lip kiss the book of the
fals prophet
or ani of hi follow mutter wulf to himself but
fortun perhap too low for either of hi companion to
hear aloud he said you understand rosamund you must be
care for godwin ever keep hi word and that would be but a
poor end for so much birth and beauti and wisdom
oh ceas mock wulf she answer lai her hand lightli

choic mai ever be forc upon you or me or your belov
brotherwho inde in such a case would do right to slai me

prize than life

as though those within it watch us
fisherfolk answer wulf carelessli i saw their net

but six month gonetold me that it wa come fast even now
the sultan saladin sit at damascu summon hi host from
far and wide while hi priest preach battl amongst the tribe
and baron of the east and when it come brother shall we not
be there to share it as were our grandfath our father our
uncl and so mani of our kin shall we rot here in thi dull
land as by our uncl wish we have done these mani year ye
ever sinc we were home from the scottish war and count the kine
and plough the field like peasant while our peer ar charg
on the pagan and the banner wave and the blood run red upon
the holi sand of palestin
now it wa wulf turn to take fire
by our ladi in heaven and our ladi hereand he look at
rosamund who wa watch the pair of them with her quiet
thought eyesgo when you will godwin and i go with you
and as our birth wa on birth so if it is decre let our
death be on death and suddenli hi hand that had been plai
with the swordhilt grip it fast and tore the long lean
blade from it scabbard and cast it high into the air flash
in the sunlight to catch it as it fell again while in a voic
that caus the wild fowl to rise in thunder from the salt
beneath wulf shout the old warcri that had rung on so mani a
fielda darci a darci meet darci meet death then he
sheath hi sword again and ad in a shame voic ar we
children that we fight where no foe is still brother mai we
find him soon
godwin smile grimli but answer noth onli rosamund said
so my cousin you would be awai perhap to return no more
and that will part us butand her voic broke
somewhatsuch is the woman lot sinc men like you ever love
the bare sword best of all nor should i think well of you were
it otherwis yet cousin i know not whyand she shiver a
littleit come into my heart that heaven often answer such
prayer swiftli oh wulf your sword look veri red in the
sunlight but now i sai that it look veri red in the sunlight
i am afraidof i know not what well we must be go for we
have nine mile to ride and the dark is not so far awai but
first my cousin come with me into thi shrine and let us prai
st peter and st chad to guard us on our journei home
our journei said wulf anxious what is there for you to fear
in a ninemil ride along the shore of the blackwat
i said our journei home wulf and home is not in the hall at
steepl but yonder and she point to the quiet brood sky
well answer said godwin in thi ancient place whenc so
mani have journei home all the roman who ar dead when it
wa their fortress and the saxon who came after them and
other without count
then thei turn and enter the old churchon of the first
that ever wa in britain roughbuilt of roman stone by the veri
hand of chad the saxon saint more than five hundr year
befor their dai here thei knelt a while at the rude altar and
prai each of them in hi or her own fashion then cross
themselv and rose to seek their hors which were ti in the
shed hard by
now there were two road or rather track back to the hall at
steepleon a mile or so inland that ran through the villag
of bradwel and the other the shorter wai along the edg of
the salt to the narrow water known as death creek at the
head of which the travel to steepl must strike inland
leav the priori of stangat on hi right it wa thi latter
path thei chose sinc at low tide the go there is good for
horseswhich even in the summer that of the inland track wa
not also thei wish to be at home by suppertim lest the old
knight sir andrew darci the father of rosamund and the uncl
of the orphan brethren should grow anxiou and perhap come out
to seek them
for the half of an hour or more thei rode along the edg of the
salt for the most part in silenc that wa broken onli by
the cry of curlew and the lap of the turn tide no human
be did thei see inde for thi place wa veri desol and
unvisit save now and again by fishermen at length just as
the sun began to sink thei approach the shore of death
creeka sheet of tidal water which ran a mile or more inland
grow ever narrow but wa here some three hundr yard in
breadth thei were well mount all three of them inde
rosamund hors a great grei her father gift to her wa
famou in that countrysid for it swift and power also
becaus it wa so docil that a child could ride it while those
of the brethren were heavybuilt but welltrain war steed
taught to stand where thei were left and to charg when thei
were urg without fear of shout men or flash steel
now the ground lai thu some seventi yard from the shore of
death creek and parallel to it a tongu of land cover with
scrub and a few oak ran down into the salt it point
end on their path beyond which were a swamp and the broad
river between thi tongu and the shore of the creek the track
wend it wai to the upland it wa an ancient track inde
the reason of it exist wa that here the roman or some
other long dead hand had built a narrow mole or quai of rough
stone forti or fifti yard in length out into the water of the
creek doubtless to serv as a conveni for fisher boat
which could lie alongsid of it even at low tide thi mole had
been much destroi by centuri of wash so that the end of
it lai below water although the landward part wa still almost
sound and level
come over the littl rise at the top of the wood tongu the
quick ey of wulf who rode firstfor here the path along the
border of the swamp wa so narrow that thei must go in singl
filecaught sight of a larg empti boat moor to an iron ring
set in the wall of the mole
your fishermen have land rosamund he said and doubtless
gone up to bradwel
that is strang she answer anxious sinc here no
fishermen ever come and she check her hors as though to
turn
whether thei come or not certainli thei have gone said
godwin crane forward to look about him so as we have noth
to fear from an empti boat let us push on
on thei rode accordingli until thei came to the root of the
stone quai or pier when a sound behind them caus them to look
back then thei saw a sight that sent the blood to their heart
for there behind them leap down on by on on to that narrow
footwai were men arm with nake sword six or eight of them
all of whom thei note had strip of linen pierc with eyelet
hole ti beneath their helm or leather cap so as to conceal
their face
a snare a snare cri wulf draw hi sword swift
follow me up the bradwel path and he struck the spur into hi
hors it bound forward to be drag next second with all
the weight of hi power arm almost to it haunch god
merci he cri there ar more of them and more there were
for anoth band of men arm and linenhood like the first
had leapt down on to that bradwel path amongst them a stout
man who seem to be unarm except for a long crook knife
at hi girdl and a coat of ring mail which show through the
open of hi loos tunic
to the boat shout godwin whereat the stout man laugheda
light penetr laugh which even then all three of them heard
and note
along the quai thei rode sinc there wa nowher els that thei
could go with both path bar and swamp and water on on side
of them and a steep wood bank upon the other when thei
reach it thei found why the man had laugh for the boat wa
made fast with a strong chain that could not be cut more her
sail and oar were gone
get into it mock a voic or at least let the ladi get
in it will save us the troubl of carri her there
now rosamund turn veri pale while the face of wulf went red
and white and he grip hi swordhilt but godwin calm as
ever rode forward a few pace and said quietli
of your courtesi sai what you need of us if it be monei we
have nonenoth but our arm and hors which i think mai
cost you dear
now the man with the crook knife advanc a littl accompani
by anoth man a tall supplelook knave into whose ear he
whisper
my master sai answer the tall man that you have with you
that which is of more valu than all the king golda veri fair
ladi of whom someon ha urgent need give her up now and go
your wai with your arm and hors for you ar gallant young
men whose blood we do not wish to shed
at thi it wa the turn of the brethren to laugh which both of
them did togeth
give her up answer godwin and go our wai dishonour
ay with our breath but not befor who then ha such urgent
need of the ladi rosamund
again there wa whisper between the pair
my master sai wa the answer he think that all who see her
will have need of her sinc such loveli is rare but if you
wish a name well on come into hi mind the name of the
knight lozel
the knight lozel murmur rosamund turn even paler than
befor as well she might for thi lozel wa a power man
and essexborn he own ship of whose do upon the sea and
in the east evil tale were told and onc had sought rosamund
hand in marriag but be reject utter threat for which
godwin as the elder of the twin had fought and wound him
then he vanishednon knew where
is sir hugh lozel here then ask godwin mask like you
common coward if so i desir to meet him to finish the work i
began in the snow last christma twelvemonth
find that out if you can answer the tall man but wulf
said speak low between hi clench teeth
brother i see but on chanc we must place rosamund between
us and charg them
the captain of the band seem to read their thought for again
he whisper into the ear of hi companion who call out
my master sai that if you try to charg you will be fool
sinc we shall stab and hamstr your hors which ar too
good to wast and take you quit easili as you fall come then
yield as you can do without shame see there is no escap
and that two men howev brave cannot stand against a crowd
he give you on minut to surrend
now rosamund spoke for the first time
my cousin she said i prai you not to let me fall live
into the hand of sir hugh lozel or of yonder men to be taken
to what fate i know not let godwin kill me then to save my
honour as but now he said he would to save my soul and strive
to cut your wai through and live to aveng me
the brethren made no answer onli thei look at the water and
then at on anoth and nod it wa godwin who spoke again
for now that it had come to thi struggl for life and their
ladi wulf whose tongu wa commonli so readi had grown
strang silent and fiercefac also
listen rosamund and do not turn your ey said godwin
there is but on chanc for you and poor as it is you must
choos between it and captur sinc we cannot kill you the
grei hors you ride is strong and true turn him now and spur
into the water of death creek and swim it it is broad but the
incom tide will help you and perchanc you will not drown
rosamund listen and move her head backward toward the boat
then wulf spokefew word and sharp begon girl we guard the
boat
she heard and her dark ey fill with tear and her state
head sank for a moment almost to her hors mane
oh my knight my knight and would you die for me well if
god will it so it must be but i swear that if you die that
no man shall be aught to me who have your memori and if you
live and she look at them confusedli then stop
bless us and begon said godwin
so she bless them in word low and holi then of a sudden
wheel round the great grei hors and strike the spur into
it flank drove straight at the deep water a moment the
stallion hung then from the low quayend sprang out wide and
clear deep it sank but not for long for present it rider
head rose abov the water and regain the saddl from which
she had float rosamund sat firm and head the hors straight
for the distant bank now a shout of wonder went up from the
woman thiev for thi wa a deed that thei had never thought a
girl would dare but the brethren laugh as thei saw that the
grei swam well and leap from their saddl ran forward a
few paceseight or tenalong the mole to where it wa
narrowest as thei went tear the cloak from their shoulder
and sinc thei had none throw them over their left arm to
serv as buckler
the band curs sullenli onli their captain gave an order to hi
spokesman who cri aloud
cut them down and to the boat we shall take her befor she
reach shore or drown
for a moment thei waver for the tall twin warrior who bar
the wai had ey that told of wound and death then with a rush
thei came scrambl over the rough stone but here the
causewai wa so narrow that while their strength last two men
were as good as twenti nor becaus of the mud and water could
thei be got at from either side so after all it wa but two to
two and the brethren were the better two their long sword
flash and smote and when wulf wa lift again onc more it
shone red as it had been when he toss it high in the sunlight
and a man fell with a heavi splash into the water of the creek
and wallow there till he di godwin foe wa down also
and as it seem sped
then at a mutter word not wait to be attack by other
the brethren sprang forward the huddl mob in front of them
saw them come and shrank back but befor thei had gone a yard
the sword were at work behind thei swore strang oath thei
caught their feet among the rock and roll upon their face
in their confus three of them were push into the water
where two sank in the mud and were drown the third onli
drag himself ashor while the rest made good their escap
from the causewai but two had been cut down and three had
fallen for whom there wa no escap thei strove to rise and
fight but the linen mask flap about their ey so that
their blow went wide while the long sword of the brother
smote and smote again upon their helm and har as the hammer
of smith smite upon an anvil until thei roll over silent and
stirless
back said godwin for here the road is wide and thei will
get behind us
so back thei move slowli with their face to the foe stop
just in front of the first man whom godwin had seem to kill
and who lai face upward with arm outstretch
so far we have done well said wulf with a short laugh ar
you hurt
nai answer hi brother but do not boast till the battl is
over for mani ar left and thei will come on thu no more prai
god thei have no spear or bow
then he turn and look behind him and there far from the
shore now swam the grei hors steadili and there upon it back
sat rosamund ye and she had seen sinc the hors must swim
somewhat sidewai with the tide for look she took the kerchief
from her throat and wave it to them then the brethren knew
that she wa proud of their great deed and thank the saint
that thei had live to do even so much as thi for her dear sake
godwin wa right although their leader command them in a
stern voic the band sank from the reach of those aw sword
and instead sought for stone to hurl at them but here lai
more mud than pebbl and the rock of which the causewai wa
built were too heavi for them to lift so that thei found but
few which when thrown either miss the brethren or did them
littl hurt now after some while the man call master
spoke through hi lieuten and certain of them ran into the
thorn thicket and thenc appear again bear the long oar of
the boat
their counsel is to batter us down with the oar what shall we
do now brother ask godwin
what we can answer wulf it matter littl if rosamund is
spare by the water for thei will scarc take her now who
must loos the boat and man it after we ar dead
as he spoke wulf heard a sound behind him and of a sudden godwin
threw up hi arm and sank to hi knee round he sprang and
there upon hi feet stood that man whom thei had thought dead
and in hi hand a bloodi sword at him leapt wulf and so fierc
were the blow he smote that the first sever hi sword arm and
the second shore through cloak and mail deep into the thief
side so that thi time he fell never to stir again then he
look at hi brother and saw that the blood wa run down hi
face and blind him
save yourself wulf for i am sped murmur godwin
nai or you could not speak and he cast hi arm round him and
kiss him on the brow
then a thought came into hi mind and lift godwin as though
he were a child he ran back to where the hors stood and
heav him onto the saddl
hold fast he cri by mane and pommel keep your mind and
hold fast and i will save you yet
pass the rein over hi left arm wulf leapt upon the back of
hi own hors and turn it ten second more and the pirat
who were gather with the oar where the path join at the

in hi stall there pardon me but in truth my children i am
jealou of you why when i found you ly in each other arm
i could have wept for rage to think that such a frai had been
within a leagu of my own door and i not in it
i know noth of all that stori said godwin
no in truth how can you who have been senseless thi month or
more but rosamund know and she shall tell it you speak on
rosamund lai you back godwin and listen
the tale is your my cousin and not mine said rosamund
you bade me take the water and into it i spur the grei
hors and we sank deep so that the wave close abov my head
then up we came i float from the saddl but i regain it
and the hors answer to my voic and bridl and swam out for
the further shore on it swam somewhat slantwis with the tide
so that by turn my head i could see all that pass upon the
mole i saw them come at you and men fall befor your sword i
saw you charg them and run back again lastli after what
seem a veri long while when i wa far awai i saw wulf lift
godwin into the saddlei knew it must be godwin becaus he set
him on the black horseand the pair of you gallop down the
quai and vanish
by then i wa near the home shore and the grei grew veri weari
and sank deep in the water but i cheer it on with my voic
and although twice it head went beneath the wave in the end it
found a foot though a soft on after rest awhil it
plung forward with short rush through the mud and so at
length came safe to land where it stood shake with fear and
weari so soon as the hors got it breath again i press
on for i saw them loos the boat and came home here as the
dark close in to meet your uncl watch for me at the gate
now father do you take up the tale
there is littl more to tell said sir andrew you will
rememb nephew that i wa against thi ride of rosamund to
seek flower or i know not what at st peter shrine nine
mile awai but as the maid had set her heart on it and there
ar but few pleasur here why i let her go with the pair of
you for escort you will mind also that you were start
without your mail and how foolish you thought me when i call
you back and made you gird it on well my patron saintor
yoursput it into my head to do so for had it not been for
those same shirt of mail you were both of you dead men todai
but that morn i had been think of sir hugh lozelleif
such a fals pirat rogu can be call a knight not but that
he is stout and brave enoughand hi threat after he recov
from the wound you gave him godwin how that he would come back
and take your cousin for all we could do to stai him true we
heard that he had sail for the east to war against saladinor
with him for he wa ever a traitorbut even if thi were so
men return from the east therefor i bade you arm have some
foresight of what wa to come for doubtless thi onslaught must
have been plan by him
i think so said wulf for as rosamund here know the tall
knave who interpret for the foreign whom he call hi
master gave us the name of the knight lozel as the man who
sought to carri her off
wa thi master a saracen ask sir andrew anxious
nai uncl how can i tell see that hi face wa mask like
the rest and he spoke through an interpret but i prai you go
on with the stori which godwin ha not heard
it is short when rosamund told her tale of which i could make
littl for the girl wa craze with grief and cold and fear
save that you had been attack upon the old quai and she had
escap by swim death creekwhich seem a thing
incrediblei got togeth what men i could then bid her
stai behind with some of them to guard her and nurs herself
which she wa loth to do i set out to find you or your bodi
it wa dark but we rode hard have lantern with us as we
went rous men at everi stead until we came to where the road
join at moat there we found a black horseyour hors
godwinso badli wound that he could travel no further and i
groan think that you were dead still we went on till we
heard anoth hors whinni and present found the roan also
riderless stand by the pathsid with hi head down
a man on the ground hold him cri on and i sprang from
the saddl to see who it might be to find that it wa you the
pair of you lock in each other arm and senseless if not
dead as well you might be from your wound i bade the
countryfolk cover you up and carri you home and other to run
to stangat and prai the prior and the monk stephen who is a
doctor come at onc to tend you while we press onward to
take vengeanc if we could we reach the quai upon the creek
but there we found noth save some bloodstain andthi is
strangeyour sword godwin the hilt set between two stone and
on the point a write
what wa the write ask godwin
here it is answer hi uncl draw a piec of parchment
from hi robe read it on of you sinc all of you ar
scholar and my ey ar bad
rosamund took it and read what wa written hurriedli but in a
clerkli hand and in the french tongu it ran thu the sword of
a brave man buri it with him if he be dead and give it back to
him if he live as i hope my master would wish me to do thi
honour to a gallant foe whom in that case he still mai meet
sign hugh lozel or anoth
anoth then not hugh lozel said godwin sinc he cannot
write and if he could would never pen word so knightli
the word mai be knightli but the writer deed were base
enough repli sir andrew nor in truth do i understand thi
scroll
the interpret spoke of the short man as hi master suggest
wulf
ay nephew but him you met thi write speak of a master
whom godwin mai meet and who would wish the writer to pai him a
certain honour
perhap he wrote thu to blind us
perchanc perchanc the matter puzzl me moreov of whom
these men were i have been abl to learn noth a boat wa seen
pass toward bradwellinde it seem that you saw it and
that night a boat wa seen sail southward down st peter
sand toward a ship that had anchor off foul point but
what that ship wa whenc she came and whither she went none
know though the tide of thi frai have made some stir
well said wulf at the least we have seen the last of her
crew of womenthiev had thei meant more mischief thei would
have shown themselv again er now
sir andrew look grave as he answer
so i trust but all the tale is veri strang how came thei to
know that you and rosamund were ride that dai to st
petersonthewal and so were abl to waylai you sure some
spy must have warn them sinc that thei were no common pirat
is evid for thei spoke of lozel and bade you two begon
unharm as it wa rosamund whom thei need also there is the
matter of the sword that fell from the hand of godwin when he wa
hurt which wa return in so strang a fashion i have known
mani such deed of chivalri done in the east by paynim men
well rosamund is half an eastern broke in wulf carelessli
and perhap that had someth to do with it all
sir andrew start and the colour rose to hi pale face then in
a tone in which he show he wish to speak no more of thi
matter he said
enough enough godwin is veri weak and grow weari and befor
i leav him i have a word to sai that it mai pleas you both to
hear young men you ar of my blood the nearest to it except
rosamundth son of that nobl knight my brother i have ever
love you well and been proud of you but if thi wa so in the
past how much more is it thu todai when you have done such
high servic to my hous moreov that deed wa brave and
great noth more knightli ha been told of in essex thi mani
a year and those who wrought it should no longer be simpl
gentlemen but veri knight thi boon it is in my power to grant
to you accord to the ancient custom still that none mai
question it while you lai sick but after it wa believ that
godwin would live which at first we scarc dare to hope i
journei to london and sought audienc of our lord the king
have told him thi tale i prai him that he would be pleas
to grant me hi command in write that i should name you
knight
my nephew he wa so pleas and here i have the brief seal
with the royal signet command that in hi name and my own i
should give you the accolad publicli in the church of the priori
at stangat at such season as mai be conveni therefor
godwin the squir hast you to get well that you mai becom sir
godwin the knight for you wulf save for the hurt to your leg
ar well enough alreadi
now godwin white face went red with pride and wulf drop hi
bold ey and look modest as a girl
speak you he said to hi brother for my tongu is blunt and
awkward
sir said godwin in a weak voic we do not know how to thank
you for so great an honour that we never thought to win till we
had done more famou deed than the beat off of a band of
robber sir we have no more to sai save that while we live we
will strive to be worthi of our name and of you
well spoken said hi uncl ad as though to himself thi
man is courtli as he is brave
wulf look up a flash of merriment upon hi open face
i my uncl whose speech is i fear me not courtli thank you
also i will add that i think our ladi cousin here should be
knight too if such a thing were possibl for a woman see
that to swim a hors across death creek wa a greater deed than
to fight some rascal on it quai
rosamund answer the old man in the same dreami voic her
rank is high enoughtoo high far too high for safeti and
turn he left the littl chamber
well cousin said wulf if you cannot be a knight at least
you can lessen all thi danger rank of your by becom a
knight wife whereat rosamund look at him with indign
which struggl with a smile in her dark ey and murmur that
she must see to the make of godwin broth follow her father
from the place
it would have been kinder had she told us that she wa glad
said wulf when she wa gone
perhap she would answer hi brother had it not been for
your rough jest wulf which might have a mean in them
nai i had no mean why should she not becom a knight
wife
ay but what knight would it pleas either of us brother
if as mai well chanc he should be some stranger
now wulf swore a great oath then flush to the root of hi
fair hair and wa silent
ah said godwin you do not think befor you speak which it
is alwai well to do
she swore upon the quai yonderbrok in wulf
forget what she swore word utter in such an hour should not
be rememb against a maid
god truth brother you ar right as ever my tongu run
awai with me but still i cant put those word out of my mind
though which of us

dream of we won it too and now both of us ar aliv and a
knighthood for each

though you would never have done less but as for fortun path
it is on that ha mani rough turn and perhap befor all is
done she mai lead us round some of them
you talk like a priest not like a squir who is to be knight
at the cost of a scar on hi head for my part i will kiss
fortun while i mai and if she jilt me afterward
wulf call rosamund from without the curtain ceas
talk of kiss at the top of your voic i prai you and
leav godwin to sleep for he need it and she enter the
littl chamber bear a bowl of broth in her hand
thereon sai that ladi should not listen to what did not
concern them wulf seiz hi crutch and hobbl from the place

hi squir scion of the nobl hous of salcot and of dengi
after them rode yet more knight squir tenant of variou
degre and servant surround by a great number of peasantri
and villein who walk and ran with their women folk and
children
follow the road through the villag the process turn to
the left at the great arch which mark the boundari of the
monk land and head for stangat abbei some two mile
awai by the path that ran between the arabl land and the salt
marsh which ar flood at high tide at length thei came to
the stone gate of the abbei that gave the place it name of
stangat here thei were met by a compani of the cluniac monk
who dwelt in thi wild and lone spot upon the water edg
head by their prior john fitz brien he wa a vener
whitehair man clad in widesleev black robe and preced
by a priest carri a silver cross now the process
separ godwin and wulf with certain of the knight and their
esquir be led to the priori while the main bodi of it
enter the church or stood about outsid it door
arriv in the hous the two knight elect were taken to a room
where their hair wa cut and their chin were shave by a barber
who await them then under the guidanc of two old knight
name sir anthoni de mandevil and sir roger de merci thei were
conduct to bath surround with rich cloth into these

sign of the cross next thei were dress again and preced by
minstrel led to the church at the porch of which thei and
their esquir were given wine to drink
here in the presenc of all the compani thei were cloth first
in white tunic to signifi the white of their heart next
in red robe symbol of the blood thei might be call upon
to shed for christ and lastli in long black cloak emblem of
the death that must be endur by all thi done their armour
wa brought in and pile befor them upon the step of the altar
and the congreg depart homeward leav them with their
esquir and the priest to spend the long winter night in orison
and prayer
long inde it wa in that lonesom holi place lit onli by a
lamp which swung befor the altar wulf prai and prai until
he could prai no more then fell into a half dream state that
wa haunt by the face of rosamund where even her face should
have been forgotten godwin hi elbow rest against the tomb
that hid hi father heart prai also until even hi
earnest wa outworn and he began to wonder about mani
thing
that dream of hi for instanc in hi sick when he had
seem to be dead and what might be the true duti of man to be
brave and upright sure to fight for the cross of christ
against the saracen sure if the chanc came hi wai what
more to abandon the world and to spend hi life mutter
prayer like those priest in the dark behind him could that
be need or of servic to god or man to man perhap becaus
such folk tend the sick and fed the poor but to god wa he
not sent into the world to bear hi part in the worldto live
hi full life thi would mean a halflifeon into which no
woman might enter to which no child might be ad sinc to
monk and even to certain brotherhood all these thing which
natur decre and heaven had sanctifi were deadli sin
it would mean for instanc that he must think no more of
rosamund could he do thi for the sake of the welfar of hi
soul in some futur state
why at the thought of it even in that solemn place and hour of
dedic hi spirit reel for then and there for the first
time it wa born in upon him that he love thi woman more than
all the world besidemor than hi life more perhap than hi
soul he love her with all hi pure young heartso much that it
would be a joi to him to die for her not onli in the heat of
battl as late had almost chanc on the death creek quai but
in cold blood of set purpos if there came need he love her
with bodi and with spirit and after god here to her he
consecr hi bodi and hi spirit but what valu would she put
upon the gift what if some other man
by hi side hi elbow rest on the altar rail hi ey
fix upon the beam armour that he would wear in battl knelt
wulf hi brothera mighti man a knight of knight fearless
nobl openheart such a on as ani woman might well love and
he also love rosamund of thi godwin wa sure and oh did not
rosamund love wulf bitter jealousi seiz upon hi vital ye
even then and there black envi got hold of godwin and rent him
so sore that cold as wa the place the sweat pour from hi
brow and bodi
should he abandon hope should he fly the battl for fear that he
might be defeat nai he would fight on in all honesti and
honour and if he were overcom would meet hi fate as a brave
knight shouldwithout bitter but without shame let destini
direct the matter it wa in the hand of destini and stretch
out hi arm he threw it around the neck of hi brother who
knelt besid him and let it rest there until the head of the
weari wulf sank sleepili upon hi shoulder like the head of an
infant upon it mother breast
oh jesu godwin moan in hi poor heart give me strength to
fight against thi sin passion that would lead me to hate the
brother whom i love oh jesu give me strength to bear it if he
should be prefer befor me make me a perfect knightstrong
to suffer and endur and if need be to rejoic even in the
joi of my supplant
at length the grei dawn broke and the sunlight pass through
the eastern window like a golden spear pierc the dusk of the
long church which wa built to the shape of a cross so that
onli it transept remain in shadow then came a sound of
chant and at the western door enter the prior wear all
hi robe attend by the monk and acolyt who swung censer
in the centr of the nave he halt and pass to the
confession call on godwin to follow so he went and knelt
befor the holi man and there pour out all hi heart he
confess hi sin thei were but few he told him of the vision
of hi sick on which the prior ponder long of hi deep
love hi hope hi fear and hi desir to be a warrior who
onc as a lad had wish to be a monk not that he might shed
blood but to fight for the cross of christ against the paynim
end with a cry of
give me counsel o my father give me counsel
your own heart is your best counsellor wa the priest
answer go as it guid you know that through it it is god
who guid nor fear that you will fail but if love and the joi
of life should leav you then come back and we will talk again
go on pure knight of christ fear noth and sure of the
reward and take with you the bless of christ and of hi
church
what penanc must i bear father
such soul as your inflict their own penanc the saint forbid
that i should add to it wa the gentl answer
then with a lighten heart godwin return to the altar rail
while hi brother wulf wa summon to take hi place in the
confession of the sin that he had to tell we need not speak
thei were such as ar common to young men and none of them veri
grievou still befor he gave him absolut the good prior
admonish him to think less of hi bodi and more of hi spirit
less of the glori of feat of arm and more of the true end to
which he should enter on them he bade him moreov to take hi
brother godwin as an earthli guid and exampl sinc there live
no better or wiser man of hi year and final dismiss him
prophesi that if he would heed these counsel he would come
to great glori on earth and in heaven
father i will do my best answer wulf humbl but there
cannot be two godwin and father sometim i fear me that our
path will cross sinc two men cannot win on woman
i know the troubl answer the prior anxious and with
less noblenatur men it might be grave but if it should come
to thi then must the ladi judg accord to the wish of her
own heart and he who lose her must be loyal in sorrow as in
joi be sure that you take no base advantag of your brother in
the hour of temptat and bear him no bitter should he win
the bride
i think i can be sure of that said wulf also that we who
have love each other from birth would die befor we betrai
each other
i think so also answer the prior but satan is veri
strong
then wulf also return to the altar rail and the full mass wa
sung and the sacrament receiv by the two neophyt and the
offer made all in their appoint order next thei were led
back to the priori to rest and eat a littl after their long
night vigil in the cold church and here thei abod awhil
think their own thought seat alon in the prior chamber
at length wulf who seem to be ill at eas rose and laid hi
hand upon hi brother shoulder sai
i can be silent no more it wa ever thu that which is in my
mind must out of it i have word to sai to you
speak on wulf said godwin
wulf sat himself down again upon hi stool and for a while
stare hard at noth for he did not seem to find it easi to
begin thi talk now godwin could read hi brother mind like a
book but wulf could not alwai read godwin although be
twin who had been togeth from birth their heart were for the
most part open to each other without the need of word
it is of our cousin rosamund is it not ask godwin
present
ay who els
and you would tell me that you love her and that now you ar a
knightalmostand hard on fiveand twenti year of ag you
would ask her to becom your affianc wife
ye godwin it came into my heart when she rode the grei hors
into the water there upon the pier and i thought that i should
never see her ani more i tell you it came into my heart that
life wa not worth live nor death worth dy without her
then wulf answer godwin slowli what more is there to sai
ask on and prosper why not we have some land if not mani
and rosamund will not lack for them nor do i think that our
uncl would forbid you if she will it see that you ar the
properest man and the bravest in all thi countri side
except my brother godwin who is all these thing and good and
learn to boot which i am not repli wulf musingli then
there wa silenc for a while which he broke
godwin our illluck is that you love her also and that you
thought the same thought which i did yonder on the quayhead
godwin flush a littl and hi long finger tighten their
grip upon hi knee
it is so he said quietli to my grief it is so but rosamund
know noth of thi and should never know it if you will keep
a watch upon your tongu moreov you need not be jealou of
me befor marriag or after
what then would you have me do ask wulf hotli seek her
heart and perchancethough thi i doubtlet her yield it to
me she think that you care naught for her
why not ask godwin again with a sigh it might save her
some pain and you some doubt and make my own path clearer
marriag is more to you than to me wulf who think sometim
that my sword should be my spous and duti my onli aim
who think have a heart of gold that even in such a thing as
thi you will not bar the path of the brother whom you love nai
godwin as i am a sin man and as i desir her abov all
thing on earth i will plai no such coward game nor conquer
on who will not lift hi sword lest he should hurt me sooner
would i bid you all farewel and go to seek fortun or death in
the war without word spoken
leav rosamund to pine perchanc oh could we be sure that
she had no mind toward either of us that would be bestto
begon togeth but wulf we cannot be sure sinc at time to
be honest i have thought she love you
and at time to be honest godwin i have been sure that she
love you although i should like to try my luck and hear it from
her lip which on such term i will not do
what then is your plan wulf
my plan is that if our uncl give us leav we should both
speak to heryou first as the elder set out your case as
best you can and ask her to think of it and give you your
answer within a dai then befor that dai is done i also should
speak so that she mai know all the stori and plai her part in
it with open ey not deem as otherwis she might that we
know each other mind and that you ask becaus i have no will
that wai
it is veri fair repli godwin and worthi of you who ar the
most honest of men yet wulf i am troubl see you my
brother have ever brethren love each other as we do and now
must the shadow of a woman fall upon and blight that love which
is so fair and preciou
why so ask wulf come godwin let us make a pact that it
shall not be thu and keep it by the help of heaven let us show
the world that two men can love on woman and still love each
other not know as yet which of them she will chooseif
inde she choos either for godwin we ar not the onli
gentlemen whose ey have turn or yet mai turn toward the
highborn rich and love ladi rosamund is it your will that
we should make such a pact
godwin thought a littl then answer
ye but if so it must be on so strong that for her sake and
for both our sake we cannot break it and live with honour
so be it said wulf thi is man work not child
makebeliev
then godwin rose and go to the door bade hi squir who
watch without prai the prior john to come to them as thei
sought hi counsel in a matter so he came and stand befor
him with downcast head godwin told him all the tale which
inde he who knew so much alreadi wa quick to understand and
of their purpos also while at a question from the prior wulf
answer that it wa well and truli said noth have been
kept back then thei ask him if it wa law that thei should
take such an oath to which he repli that he thought it not
onli law but veri good
so in the end kneel togeth hand in hand befor the rood that
stood in the chamber thei repeat thi oath after him both of
them togeth
we brethren godwin and wulf darci do swear by the holi cross
of christ and by the patron saint of thi place st mari
magdalen and our own patron saint st peter and st chad
stand in the presenc of god of our guardian angel and of
you john that be both of us enamour of our cousin
rosamund darci we will ask her to wife in the manner we have
agre and no other that we will abid by her decis should
she choos either of us nor seek to alter it by tempt her
from her troth or in ani fashion overt or covert that he of us
whom she refus will thenceforth be a brother to her and no
more howev satan mai tempt hi heart otherwis that so far as
mai be possibl to us who ar but sin men we will suffer
neither bitter nor jealousi to come between our love becaus
of thi woman and that in war or peac we will remain faith
comrad and brethren thu we swear with a true heart and
purpos and in token thereof know that he who break thi
oath will be a knight dishonour and a vessel fit for the wrath
of god we kiss thi rood and on anoth
thi then these brethren said and did and with light mind and
joy face receiv the bless of the prior who had
christen them in infanc and went down to meet the great
compani that had ridden forth to lead them back to steepl where
their knight should be done
so to steepl preced by the squir who rode befor them

with grei ey that dream and wulf with the blue ey that shine

neither is it certain when all is done that she will guess best
for her own peac would it not be wiser then that i should
forbid them to ask thi riddl he ad as though to himself

though some might have read it otherwis
godwin enter the church walk softli on the rush with

while lift her ey from the ground she smile a littl in
greet

chapter five the wine merchant
godwin laid down the letter and all of them stare at on
anoth in amaz
sure said wulf thi is some fool trick plai off upon
our uncl as an evil jest
by wai of answer sir andrew bade him lift the silk that hid the
content of the coffer and see what lai there wulf did so and
next moment threw back hi head like a man whom some sudden light
had blind as well he might for from it came such a flare of
gem as essex had rare seen befor red green and blue thei
sparkl and among them were the dull glow of gold and the white
sheen of pearl
oh how beauti how beauti said rosamund
ay mutter godwin beauti enough to maze a woman mind
till she know not right from wrong
wulf said noth but on by on drew it treasur from the
chestcoronet necklac of pearl breast ornament of rubi
girdl of sapphir jewel anklet and with them veil
sandal robe and other garment of goldembroid purpl
silk moreov among these also seal with the seal of
salaheddin hi vizier offic of state and secretari
wa that patent of which the letter spoke set out the full
titl of the princess of baalbec the extent and boundari of
her great estat and the amount of her annual revenu which
seem more monei than thei had ever heard of
i wa wrong said wulf even the sultan of the east could not
afford a jest so costli
jest broke in sir andrew it is no jest as i wa sure from
the first line of that letter it breath the veri spirit of
saladin though he be a saracen the greatest man on all the
earth as i who wa a friend of hi youth know well ay and he
is right in a sens i sin against him as hi sister sin
our love compel us jest nai no jest but becaus a vision
of the night which he believ the voic of god or perhap some
oracl of the magician ha deepli stir that great soul of hi
and led him on to thi wild adventur
he paus awhil then look up and said girl do you know what
saladin ha made of you why there ar queen in europ who
would be glad to own that rank and those estat in the rich
land abov damascu i know the citi and the castl of which
he speak it is a mighti place upon the bank of litani and
oront and after it militari governorfor that rule he would
not give a christiany will be first in it beneath the seal
of saladinth surest titl in all the earth sai will you go
and queen it there
rosamund gaze at the gleam gem and the write that made
her royal and her ey flash and her breast heav as thei
had done by the church of st peter on the essex coast thrice
she look while thei watch her then turn her head as from
the bait of some great temptat and answer on word
onlynai
well spoken said her father who knew her blood and it
long at least had the nai been yea you must have gone
alon give me ink and parchment godwin
thei were brought and he wrote
to the sultan saladin from andrew darci and hi daughter
rosamund
we have receiv your letter and we answer that where we ar
there we will bide in such state as god ha given us
nevertheless we thank you sultan sinc we believ you honest
and we wish you well except in your war against the cross as
for your threat we will do our best to bring them to noth
know the custom of the east we do not send back your gift
to you sinc to do so would be to offer insult to on of the
greatest men in all the world but if you choos to ask for them
thei ar yoursnot our of your dream we sai that it wa but an
empti vision of the night which a wise man should forgetyour
servant and your niec
then he sign and rosamund sign after him and the write
wa done up wrap in silk and seal
now said sir andrew hide awai thi wealth sinc were it
known that we had such treasur in the place everi thief in
england would be our visitor some of them bear high name i
think
so thei laid the goldembroid robe and the priceless set of
gem back in their coffer and have lock it hid it awai in
the great ironbound chest that stood in sir andrew sleep
chamber
when everyth wa finish sir andrew said listen now
rosamund and you also my nephew i have never told you the
true tale of how the sister of saladin who wa known as
zobeid daughter of ayoub and afterward christen into our
faith by the name of mari came to be my wife yet you should
learn it if onli to show how evil return upon a man after the
great nureddin took damascu ayoub wa made it governor then
some threeandtwenti year ago came the captur of harenc in
which my brother fell here i wa wound and taken prison
thei bore me to damascu where i wa lodg in the palac of
ayoub and kindli treat here too it wa while i lai sick that
i made friend with the young saladin and with hi sister
zobeid whom i met secretli in the garden of the palac the
rest mai be guess although she number but half my year she
love me as i love her and for my sake offer to chang her
faith and fly with me to england if opportun could be found
which wa hard
now as it chanc i had a friend a dark and secret man name
jebal the young sheik of a terribl peopl whose cruel rite no
christian understand thei ar the subject of on mahomet in
persia and live in castl at masyaf on lebanon thi man had
been in allianc with the frank and onc in a battl i save
hi life from the saracen at the risk of my own whereon he
swore that did i summon him from the end of the earth he would
come to me if i need help moreov he gave me hi signetr
as a token and by virtu of it so he said power in hi
dominion equal to hi own though these i never visit you
know it and hold up hi hand sir andrew show them a heavi
gold ring in which wa set a black stone with red vein run
across the stone in the exact shape of a dagger and beneath the
dagger word cut in unknown charact
so in my plight i bethought me of jebal and found mean to send
him a letter seal with hi ring nor did he forget hi promis
for within twelv dai zobeid and i were gallop for beirut on
two hors so swift that all the cavalri of ayoub could not
overtak them we reach the citi and there were marri
rosamund there too your mother wa baptis a christian thenc
sinc it wa not safe for us to stai in the east we took ship
and came safe home bear thi ring of jebal with us for i
would not give it up as hi servant demand that i should do
except to him alon but befor that vessel sail a man
disguis as a fisherman brought me a messag from ayoub and hi
son saladin swear that thei would yet recaptur zobeid the
daughter of on of them and sister of the other
that is the stori and you see that their oath ha not been
forgotten though when in after year thei learn of my wife
death thei let the matter lie but sinc then saladin who in
those dai wa but a nobl youth ha becom the greatest sultan
that the east ha ever known and have been told of you
rosamund by that traitor lozel he seek to take you in your
mother place and daughter i tell you that i fear him
at least we have a year or longer in which to prepar ourselv
or to hide said rosamund hi palmer must travel back to the
east befor my uncl saladin can have our answer
ay said sir andrew perhap we have a year
what of the attack on the quai ask godwin who had been
think the knight lozel wa name there yet if saladin had
to do with it it seem strang that the blow should have come
befor the word
sir andrew brood a while then said
bring in thi palmer i will question him
so the man nichola who wa found still eat as though hi
hunger would never be satisfi wa brought in by wulf he bow
low befor the old knight and rosamund studi them the while
with hi sharp ey and the roof and the floor and everi other
detail of the chamber for those ey of hi seem to miss
noth
you have brought me a letter from far awai sir palmer who ar
name nichola said sir andrew
i have brought you a chest from damascu sir knight but of it
content i know noth at least you will bear me wit that
it ha not been tamper with answer nichola
i find it strang went on the old knight that on in your
holi garb should be chosen as the messeng of saladin with whom
christian men have littl to do
but saladin ha much to do with christian men sir andrew thu
he take them prison even in time of peac as he did me
did he then take the knight lozel prison
the knight lozel repeat the palmer wa he a big
redfac man with a scar upon hi forehead who alwai wore a
black cloak over hi mail
that might be he
then he wa not taken prison but he came to visit the sultan
at damascu while i lai in bond there for i saw him twice or
thrice though what hi busi wa i do not know afterward he
left and at jaffa i heard that he had sail for europ three
month befor i did
now the brethren look at each other so lozel wa in
england but sir andrew made no comment onli he said tell me
your stori and be care that you speak the truth
why should i not who have noth to hide answer nichola
i wa captur by some arab as i journei to the jordan upon a
pilgrimag who when thei found that i had no good to be
rob of would have kill me thi inde thei were about to
do had not some of saladin soldier come by and command
them to hold their hand and give me over to them thei did so
and the soldier took me to damascu there i wa imprison
but not close and then it wa that i saw lozel or at least
a christian man who had some such name and as he seem to be
in favour with the saracen i beg him to interced for me
afterward i wa brought befor the court of saladin and have
question me the sultan himself told me that i must either
worship the fals prophet or die to which you can guess my
answer so thei led me awai as i thought to death but none
offer to do me hurt
three dai later saladin sent for me again and offer to spare
my life if i would swear an oath which oath wa that i should
take a certain packag and deliv it to you or to your daughter
name the ladi rosamund here at your hall of steepl in essex
and bring back the answer to damascu not wish to die i said
that i would do thi if the sultan pass hi word which he
never break that i should be set free afterward
and now you ar safe in england do you purpos to return to
damascu with the answer and if so why
for two reason sir andrew first becaus i have sworn to do
so and i do not break my word ani more than doe saladin
secondli becaus i continu to wish to live and the sultan
promis me that if i fail in my mission he would bring about
my death wherev i might be which i am sure he ha the power to
do by magic or otherwis well the rest of the tale is short
the chest wa hand over to me as you see it and with it monei
suffici for my fare to and fro and someth to spare then
i wa escort to joppa where i took passag on a ship bound to
itali where i found anoth ship name the holi mari sail for
calai which we reach after be nearli cast awai thenc i
came to dover in a fish boat land there eight dai ago
and have bought a mule join some travel to london and
so on here
and how will you return
the palmer shrug hi shoulder
as best i mai and as quickli is your answer readi sir
andrew
ye it is here and he hand him the roll which nichola hid
awai in the fold of hi great cloak then sir andrew ad you
sai you know noth of all the busi in which you plai thi
part
noth or rather onli thisth offic who escort me to
jaffa told me that there wa a stir among the learn doctor and
divin at the court becaus of a certain dream which the sultan
had dream three time it had to do with a ladi who wa half of
the blood of ayoub and half english and thei said that my
mission wa mix up with thi matter now i see that the nobl
ladi befor me ha ey strang like those of the sultan
saladin and he spread out hi hand and ceas
you seem to see a good deal friend nichola
sir andrew a poor palmer who wish to preserv hi throat
unslit must keep hi ey open now i have eaten well and i am
weari is there ani place where i mai sleep i must be gone at
daybreak for those who do saladin busi dare not tarri and
i have your letter
there is a place answer sir andrew wulf take him to it
and tomorrow befor he leav we will speak again till then
farewel holi nichola
with on more search glanc the palmer bow and went when
the door close behind him sir andrew beckon godwin to him and
whisper
tomorrow godwin you must take some men and follow thi
nichola to see where he goe and what he doe for i tell you i
do not trust himai i fear him much these embassi to and
from saracen ar strang traffic for a christian man also
though he sai hi life hang on it i think that were he honest
onc safe in england here he would stop sinc the first priest
would absolv him of an oath forc from him by the infidel
were he dishonest would he not have stolen those jewel ask
godwin thei ar worth some risk what do you think rosamund
i she answer oh i think there is more in thi than ani of
us dream
i think she ad in a voic of distress and with an
involuntari wring motion of the hand that for thi hous and
those who dwell in it time is big with death and that sharpei
palmer is it midwif how strang is the destini that wrap us
all about and now come the sword of saladin to shape it and
the hand of saladin to drag me from my peac state to a
digniti which i do not seek and the dream of saladin of whose
kin i am to interweav my life with the bloodi polici of syria
and the unend war between cross and crescent that ar both
of them my heritag then with a woeful gestur rosamund
turn and left them
her father watch her go and said
the maid is right great busi is afoot in which all of us
must bear our part for no littl thing would saladin stir
thush who brace himself as i know well for the last struggl
in which christ or mahomet must go down rosamund is right on
her brow shine the crescent diadem of the hous of ayoub and at
her heart hang the black cross of the christian and round her
struggl creed and nation what wulf doe the man sleep
alreadi
like a dog for he seem outworn with travel
like a dog with on ey open perhap i do not wish that he
should give us the slip dure the night as i want more talk
with him and other thing of which i have spoken to godwin
no fear of that uncl i have lock the stabl door and a
saint palmer will scarc leav us the present of such a
mule
not he if i know hi tribe answer sir andrew now let us
sup and afterward take counsel togeth for we shall need it
befor all is done
an hour befor the dawn next morn godwin and wulf were up and
with them certain trust men who had been warn that their
servic would be need present wulf bear a lantern in
hi hand came to where hi brother stood by the fire in the
hall
where have you been godwin ask to wake the palmer
no to place a man to watch the road to steepl hill and
anoth at the creek path also to feed hi mule which is a veri
fine beasttoo good for a palmer doubtless he will be stir
soon as he said that he must be up earli
godwin nod and thei sat togeth on the bench besid the
fire for the weather wa bitter and doze till the dawn began
to break then wulf rose and shook himself sai
he will not think it uncourt if we rous him now and
walk to the far end of the hall he drew a curtain and call
out awak holi nichola awak it is time for you to sai your
prayer and breakfast will soon be cook
but no nichola answer
of a truth grumbl wulf as he came back for hi lantern
that palmer sleep as though saladin had alreadi cut hi
throat then have lit it he return to the guest place
godwin he call present come here the man ha gone
gone said godwin as he ran to the curtain gone where
back to hi friend saladin i think answer wulf look that
is how he went and he point to the shutter of the
sleepingplac that stood wide open and to an oaken stool
beneath by mean of which the saint nichola had climb up to
and through the narrow window slit
he must be without groom the mule which he would never have
left said godwin
honest guest do not part from their host thu answer wulf
but let us go and see
so thei ran to the stabl and found it lock and the mule safe
enough within northough thei lookedcould thei find ani
trace of the palmernot even a footstep sinc the ground wa
frostbound onli on examin the door of the stabl thei
discov that an attempt had been made to lift the lock with
some sharp instrument
it seem that he wa determin to be gone either with or
without the beast said wulf well perhap we can catch him
yet and he call to the men to saddl up and ride with him to
search the countri
for three hour thei hunt far and wide but noth did thei
see of nichola
the knave ha slip awai like a night hawk and left as littl
trace report wulf now my uncl what doe thi mean
i do not know save that it is of a piec with the rest and
that i like it littl answer the old knight anxious here
the valu of the beast wa of no account that is plain what the
man held of account wa that he should be gone in such a fashion
that none could follow him or know whither he went the net is
about us my nephew and i think that saladin draw it string
still less pleas would sir andrew have been could he have seen
the palmer nichola creep round the hall while all men slept
er he gird up hi long gown and ran like a hare for london
yet he had done thi by the light of the bright star take
note of everi window slit in it more especi of those of the
solar of the plan of the outbuild also and of the path that
ran to steepl creek some five hundr yard awai
from that dai forward fear settl on the placefear of some
blow that none were abl to forese and against which thei could
not guard sir andrew even talk of leav steepl and of
take up hi abod in london where he thought that thei might
be safer but such foul weather set in that it wa imposs to
travel the road and still less to sail the sea so it wa
arrang that if thei move at alland there were mani thing
against it not the least of which were sir andrew weak health
and the lack of a hous to go toit should not be till after new
year dai
thu the time went on and noth happen to disturb them the
friend of whom the old knight took counsel laugh at hi
forebod thei said that so long as thei did not wander about
unguard there wa littl danger of ani fresh attack upon them
and if on should by chanc be made with the aid of the men thei
had thei could hold the hall against a compani until help wa
summon moreov at heart none of them believ that saladin
or hi emissari would stir in thi busi befor the spring
or more probabl until anoth year had pass still thei
alwai set guard at night and besid themselv kept twenti
men sleep at the hall also thei arrang that on the light
of a signal fire upon the tower of steepl church their
neighbour should come to succour them
so the time went on toward christma befor which the weather
chang and becam calm with sharp frost
it wa on the shortest dai that prior john rode up to the hall
and told them that he wa go to southminst to bui some wine
for the christma feast sir andrew ask what wine there wa at
southminst the prior answer that he had heard that a ship
laden amongst other thing with wine of cypru of wonder
qualiti had come into the river crouch with her rudder broken
he ad that as no shipwright could be found in london to
repair it till after christma the chapman a cypriot who wa
in charg of the wine wa sell as much as he could in
southminst and to the hous about at a cheap rate and
deliv it by mean of a wain that he had hire
sir andrew repli that thi seem a fair chanc to get fine
liquor which wa hard to come by in essex in those time the
end of it wa that he bade wulf whose tast in strong drink wa
nice to ride with the prior into southminst and if he like
the stuff to bui a few cask of it for them to make merri with at
christmasalthough he himself becaus of hi ailment now
drank onli water
so wulf went noth loth in thi dark season of the year when
there wa no fish it grew veri dull loiter about the hall
and sinc he did not read much like godwin sit for long
hour by the fire at night watch rosamund go to and fro
upon her task but not speak with her overmuch for
notwithstand all their pretens of forget some sort of
veil had fallen between the brethren and rosamund and their
intercours wa not so open and familiar as of old she could not
but rememb that thei were no more her cousin onli but her
lover also and that she must guard herself lest she seem to
show prefer to on abov the other the brethren for their
part must alwai bear in mind also that thei were bound not to
show their love and that their cousin rosamund wa no longer a
simpl english ladi but also by creation as by blood a
princess of the east whom destini might yet lift beyond the
reach of either of them
moreov as ha been said dread sat upon that rooftre like a
croak raven nor could thei escap from the shadow of it
wing far awai in the east a mighti monarch had turn hi
thought toward thi english home and the maid of hi royal
blood who dwelt there and who wa mingl with hi vision of
conquest and of the triumph of hi faith driven on by no dead
oath by no mere fanci or imperi desir but by some spiritu
hope or need he had determin to draw her to him by fair mean
if he could if not by foul alreadi mean both foul and fair
had fail for that the attack at death creek quai had to do
with thi matter thei could no longer doubt it wa certain also
that other would be tri again and again till hi end wa won
or rosamund wa deadfor here if even she would go back upon
her word marriag itself could not shield her
so the hous wa sad and saddest of all seem the face of the
old knight sir andrew oppress as he wa with sick with
memori and fear therefor wulf could find pleasur even in
an errand to southminst to bui wine of which in truth he
would have been glad to drink deepli if onli to drown hi

he offer also to go with the prior and wulf to where hi ship

he and wulf told of all their deal with thi man sir andrew
laugh at the stori show them how thei had been persuad by

had land mani year befor and stai awhil and of the
gorgeou court of it emperor and of it inhabit these
were he said the cunningest trader in the worldso cun
inde that no jew could overmatch them bold sailor also
which thei had from the phoenician of holi writ who with the
greek were their forefath ad that what thei told him of
thi georgio accord well with the charact of that peopl
thu it came to pass that no suspicion of georgio or hi ship
enter the mind of ani on of them which inde wa scarc
strang see how well hi tale held togeth and how plain
were the reason of hi presenc and the purpos of hi deal
in wine and silk
chapter six the christma feast at steepl

i fought against them i have known mani a good mussulman nor do
i think it necessari to spit at the name of mahomet who to my
mind wa a great man deceiv by the artific of satan

should fight the enemi of the cross and prai for their soul
not spit at them
the merchant look at them curious finger the silver
crucifix that hung upon hi breast the captor of the holi citi

the hors were har to the wain the merchant bore hole in
the littl cask of wine and set spigot in them bid them all

on them for their kind and liber he made hi salaam in
the eastern fashion and depart accompani by wulf
within five minut there wa a sound of shout and wulf wa
back again sai that the wheel of the wain had broken at the
first turn so that now it wa ly upon it side in the
courtyard sir andrew and godwin went out to see to the matter
and there thei found georgio wring hi hand as onli an

turn upon other matter such as the differ between the
creed of the greek and latin churchesa subject upon which he
seem to be an expertand the fear of the christian in cypru
lest saladin should attempt to captur that island
at length five oclock came and georgio have first been taken

but as she spoke godwin head fell forward on the board while
wulf rose half drew hi sword then threw hi arm about the neck
of the priest and sank with him to the ground as it wa with

sank to sleep everyon of them save the merchant georgio who
rose to call anoth toast

world princess of baalbec and niec to my royal master yusuf
salaheddin who send me to lead her to him
oh father shriek rosamund the wine wa drug and we ar

as the word pass her lip there rose a sound of run feet
and through the open door at the far end of the hall burst in a
score or over of arm men then at last sir andrew saw and
understood
with a roar of rage like that of a wound lion he seiz hi
daughter and drag her back with him down the passag into the
solar where a fire burn and light had been lit readi for their
retir fling to and bolt the door behind them

escap but at least i can die fight for you give me my
mail
she snatch hi hauberk from the wall and while thei thunder
at the door did it on to himai and hi steel helm also and
gave him hi long sword and hi shield
now he said help me and thei thrust the oak tabl forward
and overset it in front of the door throw the chair and
stool on either side that men might stumbl on them
there is a bow he said and you can us it as i have taught
you get to on side and out of reach of the sword sweep and
shoot past me as thei rush it mai stai on of them oh that
godwin and wulf were here and we would still teach these paynim
dog a lesson
rosamund made no answer but there came into her mind a vision of
the agoni of godwin and of wulf should thei ever wake again to
learn what had chanc to her and them she look round against
the wall stood a littl desk at which godwin wa wont to write
and on it lai pen and parchment she seiz them and as the door

then as the stout door at length crash in rosamund turn what
she had written face downward on the desk and seiz the bow
set an arrow to it string now it wa down and on rush the mob
up the six feet of narrow passag at the end of it in front of
the overturn tabl thei halt suddenli for there befor

throat of the speaker so that he went down grab at it and
spoke no more for ever
as he fell clatter to the floor sir andrew cri in a great
voic
we yield not to pagan dog and poison a darci a darci
meet darci meet death
thu for the last time did old sir andrew utter the warcri of hi
race which he had fear would never pass hi lip again hi
prayer had been heard and he wa to die as he had desir
down with him seiz the princess said a voic it wa that of
georgio no longer humbl with a merchant obsequi whine
but speak in tone of cold command and in arab for a moment
the swarthi mob hung back as well thei might in face of that
glitter sword then with a cry of salaheddin
salaheddin on thei surg with flash spear and
scimitar the overthrown tabl wa in front of them and on
leapt upon it edg but as he leapt the old knight all hi
year and sick forgotten now sprang forward and struck
downward so heavi a blow that in the darkl mouth of the
passag the spark stream out and where the saracen head had
been appear hi heel back sir andrew step again to win
space for hi swordplai while round the end of the tabl broke
two fiercefac men at on of them rosamund shot with her bow
and the arrow pierc hi thigh but as he fell he struck with
hi keen scimitar and shore the end off the bow so that it wa
useless the second man caught hi foot in the bar of the oak
chair which he did not see and went down prone while sir
andrew take no heed of him rush with a shout at the crowd
who follow and catch their blow upon hi shield rain
down other so desper that be hamper by their veri
number thei gave befor him and stagger back along the
passag
guard your right father cri rosamund he sprang round to
see the saracen who had fallen on hi feet again at him he
went nor did the man wait the onset but turn to fly onli to
find hi death for the great sword caught him between neck and
shoulder now a voic cri we make poor sport with thi old
lion and lose men keep clear of hi claw and whelm him with
spear cast
but rosamund who understood their tongu sprang in front of
him and answer in arab
ay through my breast and go tell that tale to saladin
then clear and calm wa heard the command of georgio he who
harm a hair of the princess di take them both live if you
mai but lai no hand on her stai let us talk
so thei ceas from their onslaught and began to consult
togeth
rosamund touch her father and point to the man who lai upon
the floor with an arrow through hi thigh he wa struggl to
hi knee rais the heavi scimitar in hi hand sir andrew
lift hi sword as a husbandman lift a stick to kill a rat
then let it fall again sai
i fight not with the wound drop that steel and get you back
to your own folk
the fellow obei himy and even touch the floor with hi
forehead in salaam as he crawl awai for he knew that he had
been given hi life and that the deed wa nobl toward him who
had plan a coward stroke then georgio step forward no
longer the same georgio who had sold poison wine and eastern
broideri but a proudlook highbrow saracen clad in the
mail which he wore beneath hi merchant robe and in place of
the crucifix wear on hi breast a great starshap jewel the
emblem of hi hous and rank
sir andrew he said hearken to me i prai you nobl wa that
act and he point to the wound man be drag awai by hi
fellow and nobl ha been your defencewel worthi of your
lineag and your knighthood it is a tale that my master and he
bow as he said the word will love to hear if it pleas allah
that we return to him in safeti also you will think that i have
plai a knave trick upon you overcom the might of those
gallant knight sir godwin and sir wulf not with sword blow
but with drug wine and treat all your servant in like
fashion sinc not on of them can shake off it fume befor
tomorrow light so inde it isa veri scurvi trick which i
shall rememb with shame to my life end and that perchanc
mai yet fall back upon my head in blood and vengeanc yet
bethink you how we stand and forgiv us we ar but a littl
compani of men in your great countri hidden as it were in a
den of lion who if thei saw us would slai us without merci
that inde is a small thing for what ar our live of which
your sword ha taken tith and not onli your but those of the
twin brethren on the quai by the water
i thought it broke in sir andrew contemptu inde that
deed wa worthi of youtwenti or more men against two
georgio held up hi hand
judg us not harshli he said speak slowli who for hi
own end wish to gain time you who have read the letter of
our lord see you these were my command to secur the ladi
rose of the world as best i might but if possibl without
bloodsh now i wa reconnoitr the countri with a troop of
the sailor from my ship who ar but poor fighter and a few of
my own peopl when my spi brought me word that she had ridden
out attend by onli two men and sure i thought that alreadi
she wa in my hand but the knight foil me by strategi and
strength and you know the end of it so afterward my messeng
present the letter which inde should have been done at
first the letter fail also for neither you nor the
princessand he bow to rosamundcould be bought more the
whole countri wa awaken you were surround with arm men

upon our track and men live must pai the price of such soft

for a moment the dy man wa silent until hi face lit up as

voic belov wife i hear you o god i come
then though hi ey stai open and the smile still rest on
hi face hi jaw fell
thu di sir andrew darci
still kneel on either side of him the brethren watch the

godwin
godwin took the parchment and read

sure we will follow you rosamund he cri aloud follow
you through life to death or victori
then he threw down the paper and call for the chaplain to
come to watch the bodi thei ran into the hall by thi time
about half of the folk were awak from their drug sleep
whilst other who had been doctor by the man ali in the barn
stagger into the hallwildei whitefac and hold
their hand to their head and heart thei were so sick and
bewild inde that it wa difficult to make them understand
what had chanc and when thei learn the truth the most of
them could onli groan still a few were found strong enough in
wit and bodi to grope their wai through the dark and the
fall snow to stangat abbei to southminst and to the
hous of their neighbour although of these there were none
near prai that everi true man would arm and ride to help them
in the hunt also wulf curs the priest matthew and himself
that he had not thought of it befor call him from hi prayer
by their dead uncl and charg him to climb the church tower as
swiftli as he could and set light to the beacon that wa laid
readi there
awai he went take flint steel and tinder with him and ten
minut later the blaze wa flare furious abov the roof of
steepl church warn all men of the need for help then thei
arm saddl such hors as thei had amongst them the three
that had been left there by the merchant georgio and gather
all of them who were not too sick to ride or run in the
courtyard of the hall but as yet their hast avail them
littl for the moon wa down snow fell also and the night wa
still black as deathso black that a man could scarc see the
hand he held befor hi face so thei must wait and wait thei
did eat their heart out with grief and rage and bath
their ach brow in ici water
at length the dawn began to break and by it first grei light
thei saw men mount and afoot feel their wai through the
snow shout to each other as thei came to know what dread
thing had happen at steepl quickli the tide spread among
them that sir andrew wa slain and the ladi rosamund snatch
awai by paynim while all who feast in the place had been
drug with poison wine by a man whom thei believ to be a
merchant so soon as a band wa got togetherperhap thirti men
in alland there wa light to stir by thei set out and began
to search though where to look thei knew not for the snow had
cover up all trace of their foe
on thing is certain said godwin thei must have come by
water
ay answer wulf and land near by sinc had thei far to
go thei would have taken the hors and must run the risk also
of lose their path in the dark to the staith let us try
steepl staith
so on thei went across the meadow to the creek it lai but three
bowshot distant at first thei could see noth for the snow
cover the stone of the littl pier but present a man cri
out that the lock of the water hous in which the brethren kept
their fishingboat wa broken and next minut that the boat
wa gone
she wa small she would hold but six men cri a voic so
great a compani could never have crowd into her
fool on answer there mai have been other boat
so thei look again and beneath the thin coat of rime found
a mark in the mud by the staith made by the prow of a larg
boat and not far from it a hole in the earth into which a peg
had been driven to make her fast
now the thing seem clear enough but it wa to be made yet
clearer for present even through the drive snow the quick
ey of wulf caught sight of some glitter thing which hung to
the edg of a clump of dead reed a man with a lanc lift it
out at hi command and gave it to him
i thought so he said in a heavi voic it is a fragment of
that starwrought veil which wa my christma gift to rosamund
and she ha torn it off and left it here to show us her road to
st petersonthewal to st peter i sai for there the
boat or ship must pass and mayb that in the dark thei have
not yet won out to sea
so thei turn their hors head and those of them that were
mount rode for st peter by the inland path that run through
steepl st lawrenc and bradwel town while those who were
not start to search along the salt and the river bank on
thei gallop through the fall snow godwin and wulf lead
the wai whilst behind them thunder an evergath train of
knight squir and yeomen who had seen the beacon flare on
steepl tower or learn the tale from messengersy and even
of monk from stangat and trader from southminst
hard thei rode but the lane were heavi with fallen snow and mud
beneath and the wai wa far so that an hour had gone by befor
bradwel wa left behind and the shrine of st chad lai but half
a mile in front now of a sudden the snow ceas and a strong
northerli wind spring up drove the thick mist befor it and
left the sky hard and blue behind still ride in thi mist
thei press on to where the old tower loom in front of them
then drew rein and wait
what is that said godwin present point to a great dim
thing upon the vapourhidden sea
as he spoke a strong gust of wind tore awai the last veil of
mist reveal the red face of the risen sun and not a hundr
yard awai from themfor the tide wa highth tall mast of a
gallei creep out to sea beneath her bank of oar as thei
stare the wind caught her and on the mainmast rose her
belli sail while a shout of laughter told them that thei
themselv were seen thei shook their sword in the mad of
their rage know well who wa aboard that gallei while to the
fore peak ran up the yellow flag of saladin stream there
like gold in the golden sunlight
nor wa thi all for on the high poop appear the tall shape of
rosamund herself and on on side of her clad now in coat of
mail and turban the emir hassan whom thei had known as the
merchant georgio and on the other a stout man also clad in
mail who at that distanc look like a christian knight
rosamund stretch out her arm toward them then suddenli she
sprang forward as though she would throw herself into the sea
had not hassan caught her by the arm and held her back whilst
the other man who wa watch slip between her and the
bulwark
in hi furi and despair wulf drove hi hors into the water till
the wave broke about hi middl and there sinc he could go no
further sat shake hi sword and shout
fear not we follow we follow in such a voic of thunder
that even through the wind and across the everwiden space of
foam hi word mai have reach the ship at least rosamund
seem to hear them for she toss up her arm as though in
token
but hassan on hand press upon hi heart and the other on hi
forehead onli bow thrice in courteou farewel
then the great sail fill the oar were drawn in and the
vessel swept awai swiftli across the danc wave till at
length she vanish and thei could onli see the sunlight plai
on the golden banner of saladin which float from her truck
chapter eight the widow masouda
mani month had gone by sinc the brethren sat upon their hors
that winter morn and from the shrine of st
petersonthewal at the mouth of the blackwat in essex
watch with anguish heart the gallei of saladin sail
southward their love and cousin rosamund stand a prison
on the deck have no ship in which to follow herand thi
inde it would have been too late to dothei thank those who
had come to aid them and return home to steepl where thei
had matter to arrang as thei went thei gather from thi man
and that tide which made the whole tale clear to them
thei learn for instanc then and afterward that the gallei
which had been thought to be a merchantman put into the river
crouch by design feign an injuri to her rudder and that on
christma ev she had move up with the tide and anchor in the
blackwat about three mile from it mouth thenc a great boat
which she tow behind her and which wa afterward found
abandon had row in the dusk keep along the further shore
to avoid observ to the mouth of steepl creek which she
descend at dark make fast to the staith unseen of ani her
crew of thirti men or more guid by the fals palmer nichola
next hid themselv in the grove of tree about fifti yard from
the hous where trace of them were found afterward wait
for the signal and if that were necessari readi to attack and
burn the hall while all men feast there but it wa not
necessari sinc the cun scheme of the drug wine which
onli an eastern could have devis succeed so it happen
that the on man thei had to meet in arm wa an old knight of
which doubtless thei were glad as their number be few thei
wish to avoid a desper battl wherein mani must fall and
if help came thei might be all destroi
when it wa over thei led rosamund to the boat felt their wai
down the creek tow behind them the littl skiff which thei
had taken from the waterhouseladen with their dead and
wound thi inde prove the most peril part of their
adventur sinc it wa veri dark and came on to snow also
twice thei ground upon mud bank still guid by nichola who
had studi the river thei reach the gallei befor dawn and
with the first light weigh anchor and veri cautious row
out to sea the rest is known
two dai later sinc there wa no time to spare sir andrew wa
buri with great pomp at stangat abbei in the same tomb where
lai the heart of hi brother the father of the brethren who had
fallen in the eastern war after he had been laid to rest amidst
much lament and in the presenc of a great concours of
peopl for the fame of these strang happen had travel
far and wide hi will wa open then it wa found that with
the except of certain sum of monei left to hi nephew a
legaci to stangat abbei and anoth to be devot to mass for
the repos of hi soul with some gift to hi servant and the
poor all hi estat wa devis to hi daughter rosamund the
brethren or the survivor of them howev held it in trust on
her behalf with the charg that thei should keep watch and ward
over her and manag her land till she took a husband
these land togeth with their own the brethren place in the
hand of prior john of stangat in the presenc of wit to
administ for them subject to the provis of the will take
a tith of the rent and profit for hi pain the priceless
jewel also that had been sent by saladin were given into hi
keep and a receipt with a list of the same sign in
duplic deposit with a clerk at southminst thi inde
wa necessari see that none save the brethren and the prior
knew of these jewel of which be of so great a valu it wa
not safe to speak their affair arrang have first made
their will in favour of each other with remaind to their
heirsatlaw sinc it wa scarc to be hope that both of them
would return aliv from such a quest thei receiv the
communion and with it hi bless from the hand of the prior
john then earli on morn befor ani were astir thei rode
quietli awai to london
on the top of steepl hill send forward the servant who led
the mule laden with their baggagethat same mule which had been
left by the spy nicholasth brethren turn their hors head
to look in farewel on their home there to the north of them lai
the blackwat and to the west the parish of mayland toward
which the laden barg crept along the stream of steepl creek
below wa the wide flat plain outlin with tree and in it
mark by the plantat where the saracen had hid the hall and
church of steepl the home in which thei had grown from
childhood to youth and from youth to man estat in the compani
of the fair lost rosamund who wa the love of both and whom
both went forth to seek that past wa all behind them and in
front a dark and troublou futur of which thei could not read
the mysteri nor guess the end
would thei ever look on steepl hall again were thei who stood
there about to match their strength and courag against all the
might of saladin doom to fail or glorious to succe
through the dark that shroud their forward path shone on
bright star of lovebut for which of them did that star shine
or wa it perchanc for neither thei knew not how could thei
know aught save that the ventur seem veri desper inde
the few to whom thei had spoken of it thought them mad yet thei
rememb the last word of sir andrew bid them keep a high
heart sinc he believ that thing would yet go well it seem
to them in truth that thei were not quit alonea though hi
brave spirit companion them on their search guid their
feet with ghostli counsel which thei could not hear
thei rememb also their oath to him to on anoth and to
rosamund and in silent token that thei would keep them to the
death press each other hand then turn their hors
southward thei rode forward with light heart not care what
befel if onli at the last live or dead rosamund and her
father should in hi own word find no caus to be asham of
them
through the hot haze of a juli morn a dromon as certain
merchant vessel of that time were call might have been seen
drift befor a light breez into st georg bai at beirut
on the coast of syria cypru whenc she had sail last wa
not a hundr mile awai yet she had taken six dai to do the
journei not on account of stormsof which there were none at
thi time of year but through lack of wind to move her still

pilgrim of all nationsthank god for so prosper a
voyagefor in those time he who cross the sea without

among these passeng were godwin and wulf travel as their
uncl had bidden them unattend by squir or by servant upon
the ship thei pass themselv off as brother name peter and
john of lincoln a town of which thei knew someth have
stai there on their wai to the scottish war simpl gentlemen

overland shrug their shoulder for these brethren look
what thei were knight of high degre and consid their
great statur long sword and the coat of mail thei alwai
wore beneath their gambeson none believ them but plain
gentlefolk bent on a piou errand inde thei nicknam them
sir peter and sir john and as such thei were known throughout
the voyag
the brethren were seat togeth in a littl place apart in the
bow of the ship and engag godwin in read from an arab
translat of the gospel made by some egyptian monk and wulf
in follow it with littl eas in the latin version of the
former tongu inde thei had acquir much in their youth
sinc thei learn it from sir andrew with rosamund although
thei could not talk it as she did who had been taught to lisp it
as an infant by her mother know too that much might hang
upon a knowledg of thi tongu thei occupi their long journei
in studi it from such book as thei could get also in
speak it with a priest who had spent mani year in the east
and instruct them for a fee and with certain syrian merchant
and sailor
shut the book brother said wulf there is lebanon at last
and he point to the great line of mountain reveal
themselv dimli through their wrap of mist glad i am to

thank god that the time ha come to act though how we ar to set
about it is more than i can sai

hush said wulf for just then some merchant and with them a
number of pilgrim their travelworn face full of raptur at
the thought that the terror of the voyag were done and that
thei were about to set foot upon the ground their lord had
trodden crowd forward to the bow to obtain their first view of
it and there burst into prayer and song of thanksgiv
inde on of these mena trader known as thoma of
ipswichwa thei found stand close to them and seem as
though he listen to their talk
the brethren mingl with them while thi same thoma of ipswich
who had visit the place befor or so it seem point out
the beauti of the citi of the fertil countri by which it wa
surround and of the distant cedarclad mountain where as he
said hiram king of tyre had cut the timber for solomon
templ
have you been on them ask wulf

nor saracen visit without an invit which is seldom given
again thei inquir why not

worth travel in
then boat came out to greet them from the shorefor at that
time beirut wa in the hand of the franksand in the shout
and confus which follow thei saw no more of thi merchant
thoma nor did thei seek him out again sinc thei thought it
unwis to show themselv too curiou about the sheik aljeb
inde it would have been useless sinc that trader wa ashor
two full hour befor thei were suffer to leav the ship from
which he depart alon in a privat boat
at length thei stood in the motlei eastern crowd upon the quai
wonder where thei could find an inn that wa quiet and of
cheap charg sinc thei did not wish to be consid person
of wealth or import as thei linger here somewhat
bewild a tall veil woman whom thei had note watch
them drew near accompani by a porter who led a donkei thi
man without more ado seiz their baggag and help by other
porter began to fasten it upon the back of the donkei with great
rapid and when thei would have forbidden him point to the
veil woman

french but thi man

and comfortableth which i heard you sai you requir just
now did i not she answer in a sweet voic also speak in
good french
godwin look at wulf and wulf at godwin and thei began to
discuss togeth what thei should do when thei had agre that
it seem not wise to trust themselv to the care of a strang
woman in thi fashion thei look up to see the donkei laden
with their trunk be led awai by the porter
too late to sai no i fear me said the woman with a laugh so
you must be my guest awhil if you would not lose your baggag
come after so long a journei you need to wash and eat follow
me sir i prai you
then she walk through the crowd which thei note part for
her as she went to a post where a fine mule wa ti loos
it she leap to the saddl without help and began to ride
awai look back from time to time to see that thei were
follow her as inde thei must
whither go we i wonder said godwin as thei trudg through
the sand of beirut with the hot sun strike on their head
who can tell when a strang woman lead repli wulf with a
laugh
at last the woman on the mule turn through a doorwai in a wall
of unburnt brick and thei found themselv befor the porch of
a white rambl hous which stood in a larg garden plant
with mulberri orang and other fruit tree that were strang
to them and wa situat on the border of the citi
here the woman dismount and gave the mule to a nubian who wa
wait then with a quick movement she unveil herself and
turn toward them as though to show her beauti beauti she
wa of that there could be no doubt with her grace swai
shape her dark and liquid ey her round featur and
strang impass counten she wa young alsoperhap

here without leav ask we ar sure that you will treat us who

as kindli as you wishi mean as you can pai for said the
woman nai i will settl with the porter he would cheat you
then follow a wrangl five minut long between thi curiou
handsom stillfac woman and the porter who after the eastern
fashion lash himself into a frenzi over the sum she offer
and at length began to call her by ill name
she stood look at him quit unmov although godwin who
understood all but pretend to understand noth wonder at
her patienc present howev in a perfect foam of passion he
said or rather spat out no wonder masouda the spy that after
hire me to do your evil work you take the part of these

instantli the woman seem to stiffen like a snake about to

your pardon widow masouda he said i forgot that you ar a

me go to pilgrim who will reward me better
she gave him the sum ad in her quiet voic go and if you
love life keep better watch over your word
then the porter went and now so humbl wa hi mien that in hi
dirti turban and long tatter robe he look wulf thought
more like a bundl of rag than a man mount on the donkei
back also it came into hi mind that their strang hostess had
power not possess by innkeep in england when she had
watch him through the gate masouda turn to them and said in
french
forgiv me but here in beirut these saracen porter ar
extortion especi toward us christian he wa deceiv
by your appear he thought that you were knight not simpl
pilgrim as you avow yourselv who happen to be dress and
arm like knight beneath your gambeson and she ad
fix her ey upon the line of white hair on godwin head
where the sword had struck him in the frai on death creek quai
show the wound of knight though it is true that a man might
come by such in ani brawl in a tavern well you ar to pai me a
good price and you shall have my best room while it pleas you
to honour me with your compani ah your baggag you do not wish
to leav it slave come here
with startl sudden the nubian who had led awai the mule
appear and took up some of the packag then she led them
down a passag into a larg sparselyfurnish room with high
window in which were two bed laid on the cement floor and
ask them if it pleas them
thei said ye it will serv read what pass in their
mind she ad have no fear for your baggag were you as
rich as you sai you ar poor and as nobl as you sai you ar

would be hard for a woman to choos between peter and john who
must both of them be hungri so i go to prepar their food
a strang hostess said wulf laugh when she had left the
room but i like her though she net us so fine i wonder
why what is more brother godwin she like you which is as
well sinc she mai be us but friend peter do not let it
go too far sinc like that porter i think also that she mai be

thi hous as there is latticework over the door to let in the
air do not be afraid i onli heard the voic of john not what

further whether that ladi ha chanc to come to palestin
she shook her head
of that he told me noth and i have heard noth now
listen my guest you think it strang that i should know so
much but it is not strang sinc here in syria knowledg is
the busi of some of us did you then believ o foolish
children that two knight like you who have plai a part in a
veri great stori whereof alreadi whisper run throughout the
east could travel by land and sea and not be known did you then
think that none were left behind to watch your movement and to
make report of them to that mighti on who sent out the ship of
war charg with a certain mission well what he know i know
have i not said it is my busi to know now why do i tell you
thi well perhap becaus i like such knight as you ar and i
like that tale of two men who stood side by side upon a pier
while a woman swam the stream behind them and afterward sore
wound charg their wai through a host of foe in the east we
love such deed of chivalri perhap also becaus i would warn
you not to throw awai live so gallant by attempt to win
through the guard gate of damascu upon the maddest of all
quest
what you still stare at me and doubt good i have been tell
you li i wa not await you upon the quai and that porter
with whom i seem to quarrel wa not charg to seiz your
baggag and bring it to my hous no spi watch your movement
from england to beirut onli sinc you have been at dinner i
visit your room and read some write which foolishli you
and john have left among your baggag and open some book in
which other name than peter and john were written and drew a
great sword from it scabbard on which wa engrav a motto
meet darci meet death and heard peter call john wulf and
john call peter godwin and so forth
it seem said wulf in english that we ar fli in a web
and that the spider is call the widow masouda though of what
us we ar to her i know not now brother what is to be done
make friend with the spider
an ill alli answer godwin then look her straight in the
face he ask hostess who know so much tell me why amongst
other name did that donkei driver call you daughter of
aljeb
she start and answer
so you understand arab i thought it why do you ask what
doe it matter to you
not much except that as we ar go to visit aljeb of
cours we think ourselv fortun to have met hi daughter
go to visit aljeb ye you hint as much upon the ship
did you not perhap that is why i came to meet you well your
throat will be cut befor ever you reach the first of hi
castl
i think not said godwin and put hi hand into hi
breast he drew thenc a ring with which he began to plai
carelessli
whenc that ring she said with fear and wonder in her ey
it is and she ceas
from on to whom it wa given and who ha charg us with a
messag now hostess let us be plain with on anoth you know
a great deal about us but although it ha suit us to call
ourselv the pilgrim peter and john in all thi there is
noth of which we need be asham especi as you sai that
our secret is no secret which i can well believ now thi
secret be out i propos that we remov ourselv from your
roof and go to stai with our own peopl at the castl where i
doubt not we shall be welcom tell them that we would bide
no longer with on who is call a spy whom we have discov
also to be a daughter of aljeb after which perhap you
will bide no longer in beirut where as we gather spi and
the daughter of aljeb ar not welcom
she listen with an impass face and answer doubtless you
have heard that on of us who wa so name wa burn here
recent as a witch
ye broke in wulf who now learn thi fact for the first
time we heard that
and think to bring a like fate upon me why foolish men i can
lai you both dead befor ever those word pass your lip
you think you can said godwin but for my part i am sure that
thi is not fate and am sure also that you do not wish to harm
us ani more than we wish to harm you to be plain then it is
necessari for us to visit aljeb as chanc ha brought us
togetherif it be chancewil you aid us in thi as i think
you can or must we seek other help
i do not know i will tell you after four dai if you ar not
satisfi with that go denounc me do your worst and i will
do mine for which i should be sorri
where is the secur that you will not do it if we ar
satisfi ask wulf bluntli
you must take the word of a daughter of aljeb i have none
other to offer she repli
that mai mean death said wulf
you said just now that wa not fate and although i have sought
your compani for my own reason i have no quarrel with youa
yet choos your own path still i tell you that if you go who
chanc to know arab have learn my secret you die and
that if you stai you ar safeat least while you ar in thi
hous i swear it on the token of aljeb and bend forward
she touch the ring in godwin hand but rememb that for the
futur i cannot answer

i think that we will trust you and stai word at which she
smile a littl as though she were pleas then said
now if you wish to walk abroad guest peter and john i will
summon the slave to guid you and in four dai we will talk
more of thi matter of your journei which until then had best
be forgotten
so the man came arm with a sword and led them out clad in
their pilgrim robe through the street of thi eastern town
where everyth wa so strang that for awhil thei forgot
their troubl in studi the new life about them thei note
moreov that though thei went into quarter where no frank
were to be seen and where fiercelook servant of the prophet
stare at them sourli the presenc of thi slave of masouda
seem to be suffici to protect them from affront sinc on
see him even the turban saracen nudg each other and
turn asid in due cours thei came to the inn again have
met no on whom thei knew except two pilgrim who had been their
fellowpasseng on the dromon these men were astonish when
thei said that thei had been through the saracen quarter of the
citi where although thi town wa in the hand of the
christian it wa scarc thought safe for frank to ventur
without a strong guard
when the brethren were back in their chamber seat at the far
end of it and speak veri low lest thei should be overheard
thei consult togeth long and earnestli as to what thei should
do thi wa clearthei and someth of their mission were
known and doubtless notic of their come would soon be given
to the sultan saladin from the king and great christian lord in
jerusalem thei could expect littl help sinc to give it might
be to bring about an open ruptur with saladin such as the
frank dread and for which thei were ill prepar inde if
thei went to them it seem like that thei would be prevent
from stir in thi danger search for a woman who wa the
niec of saladin and for aught thei knew thrown into prison or
ship back to europ true thei might try to find their wai to
damascu alon but if the sultan wa warn of their come
would he not caus them to be kill upon the road or cast into
some dungeon where thei would languish out their live the more
thei spoke of these matter the more thei were perplex till at
length godwin said
brother our uncl bade us earnestli to seek out thi
aljeb and though it seem that to do so is veri danger i
think that we had best obei him who mai have been given foresight
at the last when all path ar full of thorn what matter which
you tread
a good sai answer wulf i am weari of doubt and
troubl let us follow our uncl will and visit thi old
man of the mountain to do which i think the widow masouda is
the woman to help us if we die on that journei well at least
we shall have done our best
chapter nine the hors flame and smoke
on the follow morn when thei came into the eatingroom of
the inn godwin and wulf found thei were no longer alon in the
hous for sundri other guest sat there partak of their
morn meal among them were a grave merchant of damascu
anoth from alexandria in egypt a man who seem to be an arab
chief a jew of jerusalem and none other than the english trader
thoma of ipswich their fellowpasseng who greet them
warmli
truli thei seem a strang and motlei set of men consid
them as the young and state widow masouda move from on to the
other talk to each in turn while she attend to their want
it came into godwin mind that thei might be spi meet there
to gain or exchang inform or even to make report to their
hostess in whose pai perhap thei were still if so of thi
thei show no sign inde for the most part thei spoke in
french which all of them understood on gener matter such as
the heat of the weather the price of transport anim or
merchandis and the citi whither thei purpos to travel
the trader thoma it appear had intend to start for
jerusalem that morn with hi good but the ride mule he had
bought prove to be lame from a prick in the hoof nor were all
hi hire camel come down from the mountain so that he must
wait a few dai or so he said
under these circumst he offer the brethren hi compani in
their rambl about the town thi thei thought it wise not to
refus although thei felt littl confid in the man
believ that it wa he who had found out their stori and true
name and reveal them to masouda either through talk
or with a purpos
howev these thing might be thi thoma prove of servic to
them sinc although he wa but just land he seem to know
all that had pass in syria sinc he left it and all that wa
pass then thu he told them how gui of lusignan had just made
himself king in jerusalem on the death of the child baldwin and
how raymond of tripoli refus to acknowledg him and wa about
to be besieg in tiberia how saladin also wa gather a
great host at damascu to make war upon the christian and mani
other thing fals and true
in hi compani then and sometim in that of the other guest
none of whom show ani curios concern them though
whether thi wa from good manner or for other reason thei
could not be sureth brethren pass the hour profit
enough
it wa on the third morn of their stai that their hostess
masouda with whom as yet thei had no further privat talk ask
them if thei had not said that thei wish to bui hors on
their answer ye she ad that she had told a certain man
to bring two for them to look at which were now in the stabl
beyond the garden thither thei went accompani by masouda to
find a grave arab wrap in a garment of camel hair and
carri a spear in hi hand stand at the door of the cave
which serv the purpos of a stabl as is common in the east
where the heat is so great as thei advanc toward him masouda
said
if you like the hors leav me to bargain and seem to
understand noth of my talk
the arab who took no notic of them salut masouda and said
to her in arab
is it then for frank that i have been order to bring the two
priceless on
what is that to you my uncl son of the sand she ask let
them be led forth that i mai know whether thei ar those for
which i sent
the man turn and call into the door of the cave
flame come hither as he spoke there wa a sound of hoof
and through the low archwai leapt the most beauti hors that
ever their ey had seen it wa grei in colour with flow
mane and tail and on it forehead wa a black star not over
tall but with a barrellik shape of great strength
smallhead largeei widenostril bigbon but fine
beneath the knee and roundhoof out it sprang snort then
see it master the arab check itself and stood still by
him as though it had been turn to stone
come hither smoke call the arab again and anoth hors
appear and rang itself by the first in size and shape it wa
the same but the colour wa coalblack and the star upon it
forehead white also the ey wa more fieri
these ar the hors said the arab masouda translat thei
ar twin seven year old and never back until thei were
rise six cast at a birth by the swiftest mare in syria and of
a pedigre that can be count for a hundr year
hors inde said wulf hors inde but what is the price
of them
masouda repeat the question in arab whereon the man repli
in the same tongu with a slight shrug of the shoulder
be not foolish you know thi is no question of price for thei
ar beyond price sai what you will
he sai said masouda that it is a hundr gold piec for
the pair can you pai as much
the brethren look at each other the sum wa larg
such hors have save men live er now ad masouda and
i do not think that i can ask him to take less see that did
he but know it in jerusalem thei could be sold for thrice as
much but if you wish i could lend you monei sinc doubtless
you have jewel or other articl of valu you could give as
securitythat ring in your breast for instanc peter
we have the gold itself answer wulf who would have paid to
hi last piec for those hors
thei bui said masouda
thei bui but can thei ride ask the arab these hors ar
not for children or pilgrim unless thei can ride well thei
shall not have themno not even if you ask it of me
godwin said that he thought soat least thei would try then
the arab leav the hors stand there went into the
stabl and with the help of two of the inn servant brought out
bridl and saddl unlik ani thei had seen thei were but
thicklyquilt pad stretch far back upon the hors loin
with strong hide girth strap with wool and chase stirrup
fashion like half hoof the bit also were onli snaffl
without curb
when all wa readi and the stirrup had been let down to the
length thei desir the arab motion to them to mount as thei
prepar to do so howev he spoke some word and suddenli
those meek quiet hors were turn into two devil which
rear up on their hind leg and threaten them with their teeth
and their front hoof that were shod with thin plate of iron
godwin stood wonder but wulf who wa angri at the trick got
behind the hors and watch hi chanc put hi hand upon
the flank of the stallion name smoke and with on spring leapt
into the saddl masouda smile and even the arab mutter
good while smoke feel himself back came to the ground
again and becam quiet as a sheep then the arab spoke to the
hors flame and godwin wa allow to vault into the saddl
also
where shall we go he ask
masouda said thei would show them and accompani by her and
the arab thei walk the hors until thei were quit clear of
the town to find themselv on a road that had the sea to the
left and to the right a stretch of flat land some of it
cultiv abov which rose the steep and stoni side of hill
here on thi road the brethren trot and canter the hors to
and fro till thei began to be at home in their strang saddl
who from childhood had ridden bareback in the essex marsh
and to learn what pressur on the bit wa need to check or turn
them when thei came back to where the pair stood masouda said
that if thei were not afraid the seller wish to show them that
the hors were both strong and swift
we fear no ride that he dare to take himself answer wulf
angrili whereon the arab smile grimli and said someth in a
low voic to masouda then place hi hand upon smoke flank
he leapt up behind wulf the hors never stir
sai peter ar you mind to take a companion for thi ride
ask masouda and as she spoke a strang look came into her
ey a wild look that wa new to the brethren
sure answer godwin but where is the companion
her repli wa to do as the arab had done and seat herself
straddleleg behind godwin to clasp him around the middl
truli you look a pretti pilgrim now brother said wulf
laugh aloud while even the grave arab smile and godwin
mutter between hi teeth the old proverb woman on croup devil
on bow but aloud he said i am inde honour yet friend
masouda if harm should come of thi do not blame me
no harm will cometo you friend peter and i have been so
long coop in an inn that i who am desertborn wish for a
gallop on the mountain with a good hors beneath me and a brave
knight in front listen you brethren you sai you do not fear
then leav your bridl loos and whereer we go and whateer we
meet seek not to check or turn the hors flame and smoke now
son of the sand we will test these nag of which you sing so
loud a song awai and let the ride be fast and far
on your head be it then daughter answer the old arab
prai allah that these frank can sit a hors
then hi sombr ey seem to take fire and grip the
encircl saddl girth he utter some word of command at
which the stallion threw up their head and began to move at a
long swing gallop toward the mountain a mile awai at first
thei went over cultiv land off which the crop had been
alreadi cut take two or three ditch and a low wall in their
stride so smoothli that the brethren felt as though thei were
seat upon swallow then came a space of sandi sward half a
mile or more where their pace quicken after which thei began
to breast the long slope of a hill pick their wai amongst it
stone like cat
ever steeper it grew till in place it wa so sheer that godwin
must clutch the mane of flame and masouda must cling close to
godwin middl to save themselv from slip off behind yet
notwithstand the doubl weight thei bore those gallant
steed never seem to falter or to tire at on spot thei
plung through a mountain stream godwin note that not fifti
yard to their right thi stream fell over a littl precipic
cut it wai between cliff which were full eighteen feet from
bank to bank and thought to himself that had thei struck it
lower down that ride must have end beyond the stream lai a
hundr yard or so of level ground and abov it still steeper
countri up which thei push their wai through bush till at
length thei came to the top of the mountain and saw the plain
thei had left ly two mile or more below them
these hors climb hill like goat wulf said but on thing
is certain we must lead them down
now on the top of the mountain wa a stretch of land almost flat
and stoneless over which thei canter forward gather speed
as the hors recov their wind till the pace grew fast
suddenli the stallion threw themselv on to their haunch and
stop as well thei might for thei were on the verg of a
chasm at whose far foot a river brawl in foam for a moment
thei stood then at some word from the arab wheel round and
bear to the left began to gallop back across the tableland
until thei approach the edg of the mountainsid where the
brethren thought that thei would stop
but masouda cri to the arab and the arab cri to the hors
and wulf cri to godwin in the english tongu show no fear
brother where thei go we can go
prai god that the girth mai hold answer godwin lean
back against the breast of masouda behind him as he spoke thei
began to descend the hill slowli at first afterward faster and
yet more fast till thei rush downward like a whirlwind
how did those hors keep their foot thei never knew and
certainli none that were bred in england could have done so yet
never fall never stumbl even on thei sped take great
rock in their stride till at length thei reach the level
piec of land abov the stream or rather abov the cleft full
eighteen feet in width at the foot of which that stream ran
godwin saw and turn cold were these folk mad that thei would
put doubleladen hors at such a jump if thei hung back if
thei miss their stride if thei caught hoof or sprang short
swift death wa their portion
but the old arab seat behind wulf onli shout aloud and
masouda onli tighten her round arm about godwin middl and
laugh in hi ear the hors heard the shout and seem to
see what wa befor them stretch out their long neck and
rush forward over the flat ground
now thei were on the edg of the terribl place and like a man
in a dream godwin note the sharp sheer lip of the cliff the
gulf between them and the white foam of the stream a score of
yard beneath then he felt the brave hors flame gather itself
togeth and next instant fly into the air like a bird
alsoand wa thi dream inde or even as thei sped over that
horribl pit did he feel a woman lip press upon hi cheek
he wa not sure who could have been at such a time with death
beneath them perchanc it wa the wind that kiss him or a
lock of her loos hair which struck across hi face
inde at the moment he thought of other thing than women
lipsthos of the black and yawn gulf for instanc
thei swoop through the air the white foam vanish thei were
safe no the hind feet of flame had miss their foot thei
fell thei were lost a struggl how tight those arm clung
about him how close that face wa press against hi own lo
it wa over thei were speed down the hill and alongsid of
the grei hors flame race the black hors smoke wulf on it
back with ey that seem to be start from hi head wa
shout a darci a darci and behind him turban gone and
white burnou float like a pennon on the air the grimvisag
arab who also shout
swifter and yet swifter did ever hors gallop so fast swifter
and yet swifter till the air sang past them and the ground
seem to fly awai beneath the slope wa done thei were on the
flat the flat wa past thei were in the field the field were
left behind and behold side by side with hang head and
pant flank the hors smoke and flame stood still upon the
road their sweat hide dy red in the light of the sink
sun
the grip loosen from about godwin middl it had been close
on masouda round and nake arm were the print of the steel
shirt beneath hi tunic for she slip to the ground and stood
look at them then she smile on of her slow thrill
smile gasp and said you ride well pilgrim peter and
pilgrim john ride well also and these ar good hors and oh
that ride wa worth the ride even though death had been it
end son of the sand my uncl what sai you
that i grow old for such gallopstwo on on hors with
noth to win
noth to win said masouda i am not so sure and she
look at godwin well you have sold your hors to pilgrim
who can ride and thei have prove them and i have had a chang
from my cook in the inn to which i must now get me back
again
wulf wipe the sweat from hi brow shook hi head and mutter
i alwai heard the east wa full of madmen and devil now i
know that it is true
but godwin said noth
thei led the hors back to the inn where the brethren groom
them down under the direct of the arab that the gallant
beast might get us to them which after carri them upon
that fear ride thei did readili enough then thei fed them
with chop barlei ear and straw togeth and gave them water
to drink that had stood in the sun all dai to warm in which the
arab mix flour and some white wine
next morn at the dawn thei rose to see how flame and smoke
fare after that journei enter the stabl thei heard the
sound of a man weep and hidden in the shadow saw by the low
light of the morn that it wa the old arab who stood with hi
back to them an arm around the neck of each hors which he
kiss from time to time moreov he talk aloud in hi own
tongu to them call them hi children and sai that rather
would he sell hi wife and hi sister to the frank
but he ad she ha spokenwhi i know notand i must
obei well at least thei ar gallant men and worthi of such
steed half i hope that you and the three of us and my niec
masouda the woman with the secret face and ey that have look
on fear might perish in the cleft of the stream but it wa not
will of allah so farewel flame and farewel smoke
children of the desert who ar swifter than arrow for never
more shall i ride you in battl well at least i have other of
your matchless blood
then godwin touch wulf on the shoulder and thei crept awai
from the stabl without the arab know that thei had been
there for it seem shame to pry upon hi grief when thei
reach their room again godwin ask wulf
why doe thi man sell us those nobl steed
becaus hi niec masouda ha bid him so to do he answer
and why ha she bidden him
ah repli wulf he call her the woman with the secret
face and ey that have look on fear didnt he well for
reason that have to do with hi famili perhap or with her
secret or us with whom she plai some game of which we know
neither the begin nor the end but brother godwin you ar
wiser than i why do you ask me these riddl for my part i do
not wish to troubl my head about them all i know is that the
game is a brave on and i mean to go through with it especi
as i believ that thi plai will lead us to rosamund
mai it lead us nowher wors answer godwin with someth
like a groan for he rememb that dream of hi which he
dream in midair between the edg of black rock with the
bubbl foam beneath
but to wulf he said noth of thi dream
when the sun wa fulli up thei prepar to go out again take
with them the gold to pai the arab but on open the door of
their room thei met masouda appar about to knock upon it
whither go you friend peter and john and so earli she
ask look at them with a smile upon her beauti face that
wa so thrill and seem to hide so much mysteri
godwin thought to himself that it wa like anoth smile that on
the face of the womanhead stone sphinx which thei had seen
set up in the market place of beirut
to visit our hors and pai your uncl the arab hi monei
answer wulf
inde i thought i saw you do the first an hour ago and as for
the second it is useless son of the sand ha gone
gone with the hors
nai he ha left them behind
did you pai him then ladi ask godwin
it wa easi to see that masouda wa pleas at thi courteou
word for her voic which in gener seem a littl hard
soften as she answer for the first time give him hi own
titl
why do you call me ladi sir godwin darci who am but an
innkeep for whom sometim men find hard name well
perhap i wa a ladi onc befor i becam an innkeep but now
i amth widow masouda as you ar the pilgrim peter still i
thank you for thisbad guess of your then step back a
foot or two toward the door which she had close behind her
she made him a curtsei so full of digniti and grace that ani who
saw it must be sure that wherev she might dwell masouda wa
not bred in inn
godwin return the bow dof hi cap their ey met and in
her he learn that he had no treacheri to fear from thi woman
whatev els he might have to fear inde from that moment
howev black and doubt seem the road he would have trust
hi life to her for thi wa the messag written there a
messag which she meant that he should read yet at hi heart he
felt terribl afraid
wulf who saw someth of all thi and guess more also wa
afraid he wonder what rosamund would have thought of it if
she had seen that strang and turbul look in the ey of thi
woman who had been a ladi and wa an innkeep of on whom men
call spy and daughter of satan and child of aljeb to hi
fanci that look wa like a flash of lightn upon a dark night
which for a second illumin some magic unguess landscap
after which come the night again blacker than befor
now the widow masouda wa sai in her usual somewhat hard
voic
no i did not pai him at the last he would take no monei but
have pass it neither would he break hi word to knight who
ride so well and boldli so i made a bargain with him on behalf
of both of you which i expect that you will keep sinc my good
faith is pledg and thi arab is a chief and my kinsman it is
thi that if you and these hors should live and the time
come when you have no more need of them you will caus it to be
cri in the marketplac of whatev town is nearest to you by
the voic of the public crier that for six dai thei stand to be
return to him who lent them then if he come not thei can be
sold which must not be sold or given awai to ani on without
thi proclam do you consent
ay answer both of them but wulf ad onli we should like
to know why the arab sonofthesand who is your kinsman
trust hi gloriou hors to us in thi fashion
your breakfast is serv my guest answer masouda in tone
that rang like the clash of metal so steeli were thei whereon
wulf shook hi head and follow her into the eatingroom which
wa now empti again as it had been on the afternoon of their
arriv
most of that dai thei spent with their hors in the even
thi time unaccompani by masouda thei rode out for a littl
wai though rather doubtfulli sinc thei were not sure that
these beast which seem to be almost human would not take the
bit between their teeth and rush with them back to the desert
whenc thei came but although from time to time thei look
about them for their master the arab whinni as thei look
thi thei did not do or show vice of ani kind inde two
iadi palfrei could not have been more quiet so the brethren
brought them home again groom fed and fondl them while
thei prick their ear snif them all over as though thei
knew that these were their new lord and wish to make friend
of them
the morrow wa a sundai and attend by masouda slave
without whom she would not suffer them to walk in the town the
brethren went to mass in the big church which onc had been a
mosqu wear pilgrim robe over their mail
do you not accompani us who ar of the faith ask wulf

so thei went alon and mingl with a crowd of humbl person
at the back of the church which wa larg and dim watch the
knight and priest of variou nation struggl for preced
of place beneath the dome also thei heard the bishop of the town
preach a sermon from which thei learnt much he spoke at length
of the great come war with saladin whom he name antichrist
moreov he prai them all to compos their differ and
prepar for that aw struggl lest in the end the cross of
their master should be trampl under foot of the saracen hi
soldier slain hi fane desecr and hi peopl slaughter
or driven into the seaword of warn that were receiv in
heavi silenc

to make thing readi see i prai of you that the hors flame
and smoke ar saddl by sunset
at sundown accordingli the brethren stood wait in their
room thei were fulli arm beneath their rough pilgrim robe
even to the buckler which had been hidden in their baggag also
the saddlebag of carpet which masouda had given them were
pack with such thing as thei must take the rest have been
hand over to her keep
present the door open and a young man stood befor them
cloth in the rough camelhair garment or burnou which is
common in the east
what do you want ask godwin
i want you brother peter and john wa the repli and thei
saw that the slim young man wa masouda what you english
innoc do you not know a woman through a camelhair cloak
she ad as she led the wai to the stabl well so much the
better for it show that my disguis is good henceforth be
pleas to forget the widow masouda and until we reach the land
of aljeb to rememb that i am your servant a halfbre
from jaffa name david of no religionor of all
in the stabl the hors stood saddl and near to them
anothera good araband two laden cyprian mule but no
attend wa to be seen thei brought them out and mount
masouda ride like a man and lead the mule of which the
head of on wa ti to the tail of the other five minut later
thei were clear of beirut and through the solemn twilight hush
follow the road whereon thei had tri the hors toward the
dog river three leagu awai which masouda said thei would
reach by moonris
soon it grew veri dark and she rode alongsid of them to show
them the path but thei did not talk much wulf ask her who
would take care of the inn while she wa absent to which she
answer sharpli that the inn would take care of itself and no
more pick their wai along the stoni road at a slow ambl
thei cross the bed of two stream then almost dry till at
length thei heard run water sound abov that of the slow
wash of the sea to their left and masouda bade them halt so
thei wait until present the moon rose in a clear sky
reveal a wide river in front the pale ocean a hundr feet
beneath them to the left and to the right great mountain along
the face of which their path wa cut so bright wa it that
godwin could see strang shape carven on the sheer face of the
rock and beneath them write which he could not read
what ar these he ask masouda
the tablet of king she answer whose name ar written in
your holi book who rule syria and egypt thousand of year ago
thei were great in their dai when thei took thi land greater
even than salaheddin and now these seal which thei set upon
thi rock ar all that is left of them
godwin and wulf stare at the weatherworn sculptur and in the
silenc of that moonlit place there aros in their mind a vision
of the mighti armi of differ tongu and peopl who had
stood in their pride on thi road and look upon yonder river
and the great stone wolf that guard it which wolf so said the
legend howl at the approach of foe but now he howl no
more for he lai headless beneath the water and there he li
to thi dai well thei were dead everyon of them and even
their deed were forgotten and oh how small the thought of it
made them feel these two young men bent upon a desper quest
in a strang and danger land masouda read what wa pass in
their heart and as thei came to the brink of the river point
to the bubbl that chase each other toward the sea burst
and form again befor their ey
such ar we she said briefli but the ocean is alwai yonder
and the river is alwai here and of fresh bubbl there will
alwai be a plenti so danc on life water while you mai in
the sunlight in the moonlight beneath the storm beneath the
star for ocean call and bubbl burst now follow me for i
know the ford and at thi season the stream is not deep pilgrim
peter ride you at my side in case i should be wash from the
saddl and pilgrim john come you behind and if thei hang back
prick the mule with your sword point
thu then thei enter the river which mani might have fear
to do at night and although onc or twice the water rose to
their saddl and the mule were stubborn in the swift stream in
the end gain the further bank in safeti thenc thei pursu
their path through mountain till at length the sun rose and thei
found themselv in a lone land where no on wa to be seen
here thei halt in a grove of oak offsaddl their anim
tether and fed them with barlei which thei had brought upon a
mule and at of the food that masouda had provid then have
secur the beast thei lai down to sleep all three of them
sinc masouda said that here there wa noth to fear and be
weari slept on till the heat of noon wa past when onc more
thei fed the hors and mule and have dine themselv set
forward upon their wai
now their roadif road it could be call for thei could see
noneran ever upward through rough mountain countri where
seem to dwell neither man nor beast at sunset thei halt
again and at moonris went forward till the night turn
toward morn when thei came to a place where wa a littl
cave
befor thei reach thi spot of a sudden the silenc of those
lone hill wa broken by a sound of roar not veri near to
them but so loud and so long that it echo and reecho from
the cliff at it the hors flame and smoke prick their ear
and trembl while the mule strove to break awai and run back
what is that ask wulf who had never heard it like
lion answer masouda we draw near the countri where there
ar mani of them and therefor shall do well to halt present
sinc it is best to pass through that land in daylight
so when thei came to the cave have heard no more of the lion
or lion thei unsaddl there purpos to put the hors into
it where thei would be safe from the attack of ani such raven
beast but when thei tri to do thi smoke and flame spread out
their nostril and set their feet firm befor them refus
to enter the place about which there wa an evil smell
perhap jackal have been here said masouda let us tether
them all in the open
thi then thei did build a fire in front of them with dry
wood that lai about in plenti for here grew sombr cedar tree
the brethren sat by thi fire but the night be hot masouda
laid herself down about fifteen pace awai under a cedar tree
which grew almost in front of the mouth of the cave and slept
be tire with long ride wulf slept also sinc godwin had
agre to keep watch for the first part of the night
for an hour or more he sat close by the hors and note that
thei fed uneasili and would not lie down soon howev he wa
lost in hi own thought and as he heard no more of the lion
fell to wonder over the strang of their journei and of
what the end of it might be he wonder also about masouda who
she wa how she came to know so much why she befriend them if
she realli wa a friend and other thingsfor instanc of that
leap over the sunken stream and whetherno sure he had been
mistaken her ey had never look at him like that why he wa
sleep at hi post and the ey in the dark yonder were
not those of a woman women ey were not green and gold thei
did not grow larg then lessen and vanish awai
godwin sprang to hi feet as he thought thei were no ey he
had dream that wa all so he took cedar bough and threw them
on to the fire where soon thei flare glorious which done he
sat himself down again close to wulf who wa lost in heavi
slumber
the night wa veri still and the silenc so deep that it press
upon him like a weight he could bear it no longer and rise
began to walk up and down in front of the cave draw hi sword
and hold it in hi hand as sentri do masouda lai upon the
ground with her head pillow on a saddlebag and the moonlight
fell through the cedar bough upon her face godwin stop to
look at it and wonder that he had never note befor how
beauti she wa perhap it wa but the soft and silveri light
which cloth those delic featur with so much mysteri and
charm she might be dead not sleep but even as he thought
thi life came into her face colour stole up beneath the pale
olivehu skin the red lip open seem to mutter some
word and she stretch out her round arm as though to clasp
a vision of her dream
godwin turn asid it seem not right to watch her thu
although in truth he had onli come to know that she wa safe he
went back to the fire and lift a cedar bough which blaze
like a torch in hi left hand wa about to lai it down again on
the centr of the flame when suddenli he heard the sharp and
terribl cry of a woman in an agoni of pain or fear and at the
same moment the hors and mule began to plung and snort in an
instant the blaze bough still in hi hand he wa back by the
cave and lo there befor him the form of masouda hang from
it jaw stood a great yellow beast which although he had
never seen it like he knew must be a lioness it wa head
for the cave then catch sight of him turn and bound awai
in the direct of the fire purpos to reenter the wood
beyond
but the woman in it mouth cumber it and run swiftli
godwin came face to face with the brute just opposit the fire
he hurl the burn bough at it whereon it drop masouda
and rear itself straight upon it hind leg stretch out it
claw and seem about to fall on him for thi godwin did not
wait he wa afraid inde who had never befor fought lion
but he knew that he must do or die therefor he charg straight
at it and with all the strength of hi strong arm drove hi long
sword into the yellow breast till it seem to him that the
steel vanish and he could see noth but the hilt
then a shock a sound of furiou snarl and down he went to
earth beneath a soft and heavi weight and there hi sens left
him
when thei came back again someth soft wa still upon hi face
but thi prove to be onli the hand of masouda who bath hi
brow with a cloth dip in water while wulf chafe hi hand
godwin sat up and in the light of the new risen sun saw a dead
lioness ly befor him it breast still transfix with hi
own sword
so i save you he said faintli
ye you save me answer masouda and kneel down she
kiss hi feet then rise again with her long soft hair
wipe awai the blood that wa run from a wound in hi arm
chapter ten on board the gallei
rosamund wa led from the hall of steepl across the meadow down
to the quai at steepl creek where a great boat waitedthat of
which the brethren had found the impress in the mud in thi the
band embark place their dead and wound with on or two
to tend them in the fish skiff that had belong to her
father thi skiff have been made fast to the stern of the
boat thei push off and in utter silenc row down the creek
till thei reach the tidal stream of the blackwat where thei
turn their bow seaward through the thick night and the
fall snow slowli thei felt their wai along sometim row
sometim drift while the fals palmer nichola steer them
the journei prove danger for thei could scarc see the
shore although thei kept as close to it as thei dare
the end of it wa that thei ground on a mud bank and do what
thei would could not thrust themselv free now hope rose in
the heart of rosamund who sat still as a statu in the middl of
the boat the princ hassan at her side and the arm mentwenti
or thirti of themal about her perhap she thought thei
would remain fast there till daybreak and be seen and rescu
when the brethren woke from their drug sleep but hassan read
her mind and said to her gentli enough
be not deceiv ladi for i must tell you that if the worst
come to the worst we shall place you in the littl skiff and go
on leav the rest to take their chanc
as it happen at the full tide thei float off the bank and
drift with the ebb down toward the sea at the first break of
dawn she look up and there loom larg in the mist lai a
gallei anchor in the mouth of the river give thank to
allah for their safe arriv the band brought her aboard and led
her toward the cabin on the poop stood a tall man who wa
command the sailor that thei should get up the anchor as she
came he advanc to her bow and sai
ladi rosamund thu you find me onc more who doubtless you
never thought to see again
she look at him in the faint light and her blood went cold it

pai of saladin
in the pai of anyon who lead me to you rosamund then
see the emir hassan approach he turn to give some order to
the sailor and she pass on to the cabin and in her agoni fell
upon her knee
when rosamund rose from them she felt that the ship wa move
and desir to look her last on essex land went out again upon
the poop where hassan and sir hugh place themselv on upon
either side of her then it wa that she saw the tower of st
petersonthewal and her cousin seat on horseback in front
of it the light of the risen sun shine upon their mail also
she saw wulf spur hi hors into the sea and faintli heard hi
great cry of fear not we follow we follow
a thought came to her and she sprang toward the bulwark but
thei were watch and held her so that all that she could do
wa to throw up her arm in token
now the wind caught the sail and the ship went forward swiftli
so that soon she lost sight of them then in her grief and rage
rosamund turn upon sir hugh lozel and beat him with bitter
word till he shrank befor her
coward and traitor she said so it wa you who plan thi
know everi secret of our home where often you were a guest
you who for paynim gold have murder my father not dare to
show your face befor hi sword but hang like a thief upon

master satan and she paus trembl with her righteou
wrath while hassan stare at her and mutter

hi rage ye and she ha hi veri ey
but sir hugh answer in a thick voic
let them followon or both i fear them not and out there my
foot will not slip in the snow
then i sai that it shall slip in the sand or on a rock she
answer and turn fled to the cabin and cast herself down
and wept till she thought that her heart would break
well might rosamund weep whose belov sire wa slain who wa
torn from her home to find herself in the power of a man she
hate yet there wa hope for her hassan eastern trickster as
he might be wa her friend and her uncl saladin at least
would never wish that she should be shame most like he knew
noth of thi man lozel except as on of those christian
traitor who were ever readi to betrai the cross for gold but
saladin wa far awai and her home lai behind her and her cousin
and lover were eat out their heart upon that fade shore
and sheon woman alonewa on thi ship with the evil man
lozel who thu had kept hi promis and there were none save

food with hi own hand but she loath it who onli desir to
die the dai turn to night the night turn to dai again and
alwai hassan brought her food and strove to comfort her till at
length she rememb no more
then came a long long sleep and in the sleep dream of her
father stand with hi face to the foe and sweep them down
with hi long sword as a sickl sweep cornof her father fell
by the pilgrim knave dy upon the floor of hi own hous and
sai god will guard you hi will be done dream of godwin
and wulf also fight to save her plight their troth and
swear their oath and between the dream black
rosamund awok to feel the sun stream warmli through the
shutter of her cabin and to see a woman who held a cup in her
hand watch hera stout woman of middl ag with a not
unkindli face she look about her and rememb all so she
wa still in the ship

is a clever doctor told me so
so rosamund slept and from that time forward float on the
calm mediterranean sea her strength began to come back again
rapidli who wa young and strong in bodi and constitut
three dai later she wa help to the deck where the first man
she saw wa hassan who came forward to greet her with mani
eastern salut and joi written on hi dark wrinkl face
i give thank to allah for your sake and my own he said for

face with him often wa hi jackal the fals palmer nichola
who crawl about her like a snake and strove to flatter her
but to thi man she would never speak a word

and then lozel found hi opportun rosamund strove to keep
her cabin to avoid him but the heat of the summer sun in the
mediterranean drove her out of it to a place beneath an awn on

we reach hi court and judg between the word of the princess of
baalbec and of hi hire servant the fals frank and pirat sir

with mean then ad have you aught els to sai to me
princ hassan becaus if not i must be attend to the
busi of my ship which you suppos that i wa about to
abandon to win a ladi smile
onli thi that the ship is the sultan and not your for he
bought it from you and that henceforth thi ladi will be guard
dai and night and doubli guard when we come to the shore of
cypru where it seem that you have friend understand and
rememb
i understand and certainli i will rememb repli lozel
and so thei part
i think said rosamund when he had gone that we shall be
fortun if we land safe in syria
that wa in my mind also ladi i think too that i have
forgot my wisdom but my heart rose against thi man and be
still weak from sick i lost my judgment and spoke what wa
in my heart who would have done better to wait now perhap it
will be best to kill him if it were not that he alon ha the
skill to navig the ship which is a trade that he ha follow
from hi youth nai let it go as allah will he is just and
will bring the matter to judgment in due time
ye but to what judgment ask rosamund
i hope to that of the sword answer hassan as he bow and
left her
from that time forward arm men watch all the night through
befor rosamund cabin and when she walk the deck arm men
walk after her nor wa she troubl by lozel who sought to
speak with her no more or to hassan either onli with the man
nichola he spoke much
at length upon on golden eveningfor lozel wa a skil
pilot on of the best inde who sail those seasthei came
to the shore of cypru and cast anchor befor them stretch
along the beach lai the white town of limazol with palm tree
stand up amidst it garden while beyond the fertil plain
rose the mighti mountain rang of trooido sick and weari of the
endless ocean rosamund gaze with raptur at thi green and
beauteou shore the home of so much histori and sigh to think
that on it she might set no foot lozel saw her look and heard
her sigh and as he climb into the boat which had come out to
row him into the harbour mock her sai
will you not chang your mind ladi and come with me to visit
my friend the emperor isaac i swear that hi court is gai not
pack full of sour saracen or pilgrim think of their soul
in cypru thei onli make pilgrimag to papho yonder where
venu wa born from out the foam and ha reign sinc the
begin of the worldai and will reign until it end
rosamund made no answer and lozel descend into the boat
wa row shoreward through the breaker by the darkskin
cyprian oarsmen who wore flower in their hair and sang as thei
labour at the oar
for ten whole dai thei roll off limazol although the weather
wa fair and the wind blew straight for syria when rosamund
ask why thei bide there so long hassan stamp hi foot and
said it wa becaus the emperor refus to suppli them with more
food or water than wa suffici for their daili need unless
he hassan would land and travel to an inland town call
nicosia where hi court lai and there do homag to him thi
scent a trap he fear to do nor could thei put out to sea
without provis
cannot sir hugh lozel see to it ask rosamund
doubtless if he will answer hassan grind hi teeth
but he swear that he is powerless
so there thei bode dai after dai bake by the swelter summer
sun and rock to and fro on the long ocean roller till their
heart grew sick within them and their bodi also for some of
them were seiz with a fever common to the shore of cypru of
which two di now and again some offic would come off from
the shore with lozel and a littl food and water and bargain
with them sai that befor their want were suppli the
princ hassan must visit the emperor and bring with him the fair
ladi who wa hi passeng whom he desir to see
hassan would answer no and doubl the guard about rosamund for
at night boat appear that cruis round them in the daytim
also band of men fantast dress in silk and with them
women could be seen ride to and fro upon the shore and stare
at them as though thei were strive to make up their mind to
attack the ship
then hassan arm hi grim saracen and bade them stand in line
upon the bulwark drawn scimitar in hand a sight that seem to
frighten the cypriotesat least thei alwai rode awai toward
the great squar tower of colossi
at length hassan would bear it no more on morn lozel came
off from limazol where he slept at night bring with him
three cyprian lord who visit the shipnot to bargain as thei
pretend but to obtain sight of the beauteou princess
rosamund thereon the common talk began of homag that must be
paid befor food wa grant fail which the emperor would bid
hi seamen captur the ship hassan listen a while then
suddenli issu an order that the lord should be seiz
now he said to lozel bid your sailor haul up the anchor
and let us begon for syria
but answer the knight we have neither food nor water for
more than on dai
i care not answer hassan as well die of thirst and
starvat on the sea as rot here with fever what we can bear
these cyprian gallant can bear also bid the sailor lift the
anchor and hoist the sail or i loos my scimitar among them
now lozel stamp and foam but without avail so he turn
to the three lord who were pale with fear and said
which will you do find food and water for thi ship or put to
sea without them which is but to die
thei answer that thei would go ashor and suppli all that wa
need
nai said hassan you bide here until it come
in the end then thi happen for on of the lord chanc to
be a nephew of the emperor who when he learn that he wa
captiv sent suppli in plenti thu it came about that the
cyprian lord have been sent back with the last empti boat
within two dai thei were at sea again
now rosamund miss the hate face of the spy nichola and told
hassan who made inquiri to findor so said lozellethat he
went ashor and vanish there on the first dai of their land
in cypru though whether he had been kill in some brawl or
fallen sick or hidden himself awai he did not know hassan
shrug hi shoulder and rosamund wa glad enough to be rid of
him but in her heart she wonder for what evil purpos nichola
had left the ship
when the gallei wa on dai out from cypru steer for the
coast of syria thei fell into a calm such as is common in those
sea in summer thi calm last eight whole dai dure which
thei made but littl progress at length when all were weari of
stare at the oillik sea a wind sprang up that grew gradual
to a gale blow toward syria and befor it thei fled along
swiftli wors and stronger grew that gale till on the even
of the second dai when thei seem in no littl danger of be
poop thei saw a great mountain far awai at the sight of which
lozel thank god aloud
ar those the mountain near antioch ask hassan
nai he answer thei ar more than fifti mile south of
them between ladikiya and jebela there by the merci of heaven
is a good haven for i have visit it where we can lie till
thi storm is past
but we ar steer for darbesak not for a haven near jebela
which is a frankish port answer hassan angrili
then put the ship about and steer there yourself said lozel
and i promis you thi that within two hour everi on of you
will be dead at the bottom of the sea
hassan consid it wa true for then the wave would strike
them broadsid on and thei must fill and sink
on your head be it he answer shortli
the dark fell and by the light of the great lantern at their
prow thei saw the white sea hiss past as thei drove shoreward
beneath bare mast for thei dare hoist no sail
all that night thei pitch and roll till the stoutest of them
fell sick prai god and allah that thei might have light by
which to enter the harbour at length thei saw the top of the
loftiest mountain grow lumin with the come dawn although
the land itself wa still lost in shadow and saw also that it
seem to be tower almost over them
take courag cri lozel i think that we ar save and
he hoist a second lantern at hi mastheadwhi thei did not
know
after thi the sea began to fall onli to grow rough again for a
while as thei cross some bar to find themselv in calm water
and on either side of them what appear in the dim uncertain
light to be the bushclad bank of a river for a while thei ran
on till lozel call in a loud voic to the sailor to let the
anchor go and sent a messeng to sai that all might rest now
as thei were safe so thei laid them down and tri to sleep
but rosamund could not sleep present she rose and throw on
her cloak went to the door of the cabin and look at the beauti
of the mountain rosi with the newborn light and at the misti
surfac of the harbour it wa a lone placeat least she
could see no town or hous although thei were ly not fifti
yard from the treehidden shore as she stood thu she heard
the sound of boat be row through the mist and perceiv
three or four of these approach the ship in silenc perceiv
also that lozel who stood alon upon the deck wa watch
their approach now the first boat made fast and a man in the
prow rose up and began to speak to lozel in a low voic as he
did so the hood fell back from hi head and rosamund saw the
face it wa that of the spy nichola for a moment she stood
amaz for thei had left thi man in cypru then understand
came to her and she cri aloud
treacheri princ hassan there is treacheri
as the word left her lip fierc wildlook men began to
scrambl aboard at the low waist of the gallei to which boat
after boat made fast the saracen also tumbl from the bench
where thei slept and ran aft to the deck where rosamund wa all
except on of them who wa cut off in the prow of the ship
princ hassan appear too scimitar in hand clad in hi
jewel turban and coat of mail but without hi cloak shout
order as he came while the hire crew of the ship flung
themselv upon their knee and beg for merci to him rosamund
cri out that thei were betrai and by nichola whom she had
seen then a great man wear a white burnou and hold a
nake sword in hi hand step forward and said in arab
yield you now for you ar outnumb and your captain is
captur and he point to lozel who wa be held by two
men while hi arm were bound behind him
in whose name do you bid me yield ask the princ glare
about him like a lion in a trap
in the dread name of sinan in the name of the lord aljeb o
servant of salaheddin
at these word a groan of fear went up even from the brave
saracen for now thei learn that thei had to do with the
terribl chief of the assassin
is there then war between the sultan and sinan ask hassan
ay there is alwai war moreov you have on with you and
he point to rosamund who is dear to salaheddin whom

thei answer with a fierc guttur cry then as rosamund fled
to the cabin the frai began a hideou frai on came the
assassin with sword and dagger strive to storm the deck
again and again thei were beaten back till the waist seem full
of their corps as man by man thei fell beneath the curv
scimitar and again and again thei charg these men who when
their master order knew neither fear nor piti but more
boatload came from the shore and the saracen were but few
worn also with storm and sick so at last rosamund peep
beneath her hand saw that the poop wa gain
here and there a man fought on until he fell beneath the cruel
knive in the midst of the circl of the dead among them the
warriorprinc hassan watch him with fascin ey as he
strove alon against a host rosamund wa put in mind of anoth
scene when her father also alon had striven thu against that
emir and hi soldier and even then she bethought her of the
justic of god

er he could rise again thei had thrown cloak over him these
fierc silent men who even with their live at stake
rememb the command of their captain to take him live so

struck them down had never struck back at him lest the command
of sinan should be broken
rosamund note it and rememb that hi command wa also that

violenc to fear at the hand of these cruel murder from thi
thought and becaus hassan still live she took such comfort as

to see you upon the ground with thi yellow beast crouch on the
top of you like a hen on a nest egg i thought that it wa aliv
and smote it with my sword which had i been fulli awak i
doubt if i should have found the courag to do look and he
push the lionesss head with hi foot whereon it twist round
in such a fashion that thei perceiv for the first time that it

so have shown them the skin of the lion that thei might know
it wa but a dead thing at the sight of which thei snort and
trembl thei pack it upon on of the mule and rode off
slowli into a vallei some five mile awai where wa water but no
tree here sinc godwin need rest thei stop all that dai
and the night which follow see no more of lion though
thei watch for them sharpli enough the next morn have
slept well he wa himself again and thei start forward
through a broken countri toward a deep cleft on either side of
which stood a tall mountain

so on thei rode till at length perch upon the side of the
cleft thei saw a castl a great build with high wall to
which thei came at sunset it seem that thei were expect in
thi place for men hasten to meet them who greet masouda
and ei the brethren curious especi after thei had heard
of the adventur with the lion these took them not into the
castl but to a kind of hostelri at it back where thei were
furnish with food and slept the night
next morn thei went on again to a hilli countri with beauti
and fertil vallei through thi thei rode for two hour
pass on their wai sever villag where sombreei peopl
were labour in the field from each villag as thei drew
near to it horsemen would gallop out and challeng them whereon

upon a marvel scene below them stretch a vast plain full
of villag cornfield olivegrov and vineyard in the
centr of thi plain some fifteen mile awai rose a great
mountain which seem to be wall all about within the wall

a good counsel answer godwin and thei rode forward in
silenc
thei cross the plain and toward even came to the wall of
the outer citi halt in front of it great gatewai here as
at the first castl a band of solemnlook mount men came
out to meet them and have spoken a few word with masouda
led them over the drawbridg that span the first rockcut
moat and through tripl gate of iron into the citi then thei
pass up a street veri steep and narrow from the roof and
window of the hous on either side of which hundr of
peoplemani of whom seem to be engag at their even
prayerwatch them go by at the head of thi street thei
reach anoth fortifi gatewai on the turret of which so
motionless that at first thei took them to be statu cut in
stone stood guard wrap in long white robe after parlei
thi also wa open to them and again thei rode through tripl
door
then thei saw all the wonder of that place for between the outer
citi where thei stood and the castl with it inner town which
wa built around and beneath it yawn a vast gulf over nineti
feet in depth across thi gulf built of block of stone quit
unrail and not more than three pace wide ran a causewai some
two hundr yard in length which causewai wa support upon
arch rear up at interv from the bottom of the gulf
ride on and have no fear said masouda your hors ar
train to height and the mule and mine will follow
so godwin show noth in hi face of the doubt that he felt
in hi heart pat flame upon the neck and after hang back
a littl the hors start lift it hoof high and glanc
from side to side at the terribl gulf beneath where flame went
smoke knew that it could go and came on brave but snort a
littl while the mule that did not fear height so long as the
ground wa firm beneath their feet follow onli masouda
hors wa terrifi back and strove to wheel round till she
drove the spur into it when of a sudden it start and came over
at a gallop
at length thei were across and pass under anoth gatewai
which had broad terrac on either side of it rode up the long
street beyond and enter a great courtyard around which stood
the castl a vast and frown fortress here a whiterob
offic came forward greet them with a low bow and with him
servant who assist them to dismount these men took the hors
to a rang of stabl on on side of the courtyard whither the
brethren follow to see their beast groom and fed then the
offic who had stood patient by the while conduct them
through doorwai and down passag to the guest chamber larg
stoneroof room where thei found their baggag readi for
them here masouda said that she would see them again on the
follow morn and depart in compani with the offic
wulf look round the great vault chamber which now that the
dark had fallen wa lit by flicker lamp set in iron
bracket upon the wall and said
well for my part i had rather pass the night in a desert among
the lion than in thi dismal place
scarc were the word out of hi lip when curtain swung asid
and beauti women enter clad in gauzi veil and bear
dish of food these thei place upon the ground befor them
invit them to eat with nod and smile while other brought
basin of scent water which thei pour over their hand then
thei sat down and at the food that wa strang to them but veri
pleasant to the tast and while thei at women whom thei could
not see sang sweet song and plai upon harp and lute wine
wa offer to them also but of thi rememb masouda
word thei would not drink ask by sign for water which wa
brought after a littl paus
when their meal wa done the beauti women bore awai the
dish and black slave appear these men led them to bath
such as thei had never seen where thei wash first in hot
water then in cold afterward thei were rub with
spicysmel oil and have been wrap in white robe
conduct back to their chamber where thei found bed spread for
them on these be veri weari thei lai down when the
strang sweet music broke out afresh and to the sound of it
thei fell asleep
when thei awok it wa to see the light stream through the
high lattic window
did you sleep well godwin ask wulf
well enough answer hi brother onli i dream that
throughout the night peopl came and look at me
i dream that also said wulf moreov i think that it wa
not all a dream sinc there is a coverlet on my bed which wa
not there when i went to sleep
godwin look at hi own where also wa anoth coverlet ad
doubtless as the night grew colder in that high place
i have heard of enchant castl he said now i think that
we have found on
ay repli wulf and it is well enough while it last
thei rose and dress themselv put on clean garment and
their best cloak that thei had brought with them on the mule
after which the veil women enter the room with breakfast and
thei at when thi wa finish have noth els to do thei
made sign to on of the women that thei wish for cloth
wherewith to clean their armour for as thei had been bidden
thei pretend to understand no word of arab she nod and
present return with a companion carri leather and past
in a jar nor did thei leav them but sit upon the ground
whether the brethren will it or no took the shirt of mail and
rub them till thei shone like silver while godwin and wulf
polish their helm spur and buckler cleans their sword
and dagger also and sharpen them with a stone which thei
carri for that purpos
now as these women work thei began to talk to each other in a
low voic and some of their talk though not all the brethren
understood
a handsom pair truli said the first we should be fortun
if we had such men for husband although thei ar frank and
infidel
ay answer the other and from their like thei must be
twin now which of them would you choos
then for a long while thei discuss them compar them featur
by featur and limb by limb until the brethren felt their face
grow red beneath the sunburn and scrub furious at their
armour to show a reason for it at length on of the women said
it wa cruel of the ladi masouda to bring these bird into the
master net she might have warn them
masouda wa ever cruel answer the other who hate all men
which is unnatur yet i think if she love a man she would love
him well and perhap that might be wors for him than her hate
ar these knight spi ask the first
i suppos so wa the answer silli fellow who think that
thei can spy upon a nation of spi thei would have done better
to keep to fight at which doubtless thei ar good enough
what will happen to them
what alwai happen i supposea pleasant time at first then
if thei can be put to no other us a choic between the faith
and the cup or perhap as thei seem men of rank thei mai be
imprison in the dungeon tower and held to ransom ye ye it
wa cruel of masouda to trick them so who mai be but travel
after all desir to see our citi
just then the curtain wa drawn and through it enter masouda
herself she wa dress in a white robe that had a dagger work
in red over the left breast and her long black hair fell upon
her shoulder although it wa half hid by the veil open in
front which hung from her head never had thei seen her look so
beauti as she seem thu
greet brother peter and john is thi fit work for
pilgrim she said in french point to the long sword which
thei were sharpen
ay answer wulf as thei rose and bow to her for pilgrim

the women who were clean the mail bow also for it seem
that here masouda wa a person of import she took the
hauberk from their hand

don them fool that is the shirt of the greyei knight give
it me i will be hi squir and she snatch the hauberk from
their hand whereat when her back wa turn thei glanc at

now she said when thei were fulli arm and had don their
mantl you brethren look as pilgrim should listen i have a
messag for you the masterand she bow her head as did the
women guess of whom she spokewil receiv you in an hour
time till when if it pleas you we can walk in the garden

so thei went out with her and as thei pass toward the curtain
she whisper
for your live sake rememb all that i have told youabov
everyth about the wine and the ring for if you dream the
drinkdream you will be search speak no word to me save of
common matter
in the passag beyond the curtain whiterob guard were
stand arm with spear who turn and follow them without
a word first thei went to the stabl to visit flame and smoke
which whinni as thei drew near these thei found wellf and
tendedinde a compani of groom were gather round them
discuss their point and beauti who salut as the owner of
such steed approach leav the stabl thei pass through
an archwai into the famou garden which were said to be the
most beauti in all the east beauti thei were inde
plant with tree shrub and flower such as ar seldom seen
while between fernclad rock flow rill which fell over deep
cliff in waterfal of foam in place the shade of cedar lai
so dens that the bright of dai wa chang to twilight but
in other the ground wa open and carpet with flower which
fill the air with perfum everywher grew rose myrtl and
tree laden with rich fruit while from all side came the sound
of coo dove and the voic of mani brightwing bird which
flash from palm to palm
on thei walk down the sandstrewn path for a mile or more
accompani by masouda and the guard at length pass through
a brake of whisper reedlik plant of a sudden thei came to
a low wall and saw yawn black and wide at their veri feet
that vast cleft which thei had cross befor thei enter the
castl
it encircl the inner citi the fortress and it ground
said masouda and who live todai that could throw a bridg
across it now come back
so follow the gulf round thei return to the castl by
anoth path and were usher into an anteroom where stood a
watch of twelv men here masouda left them in the midst of the
men who stare at them with stoni ey present she return
and beckon to them to follow her walk down a long passag
thei came to curtain in front of which were two sentri who
drew these curtain as thei approach then side by side thei
enter a great hall long as stangat abbei church and pass
through a number of peopl all crouch upon the ground beyond
these the hall narrow as a chancel doe
here sat and stood more peopl fierceei turban men who
wore great knive in their girdl these as thei learn
afterward were call the fedai the sworn assassin who live
but to do the command of their lord the great assassin at the
end of thi chancel were more curtain beyond which wa a
guard door it open and on it further side thei found
themselv in full sunlight on an unwal terrac surround by
the mighti gulf into which it wa built out on the right and
left edg of thi terrac sat old and beard men twelv in
number their head bow humbl and their ey fix upon the
ground these were the dai or councillor
at the head of the terrac under an open and beautifulli carv
pavilion of wood stood two gigant soldier have the red
dagger blazon on their white robe between them wa a black
cushion and on the cushion a black heap at first stare out
of the bright sunlight at thi heap in the shadow the brethren
wonder what it might be then thei caught sight of the glitter
of ey and knew that the heap wa a man who wore a black turban
on hi head and a black bellshap robe clasp at the breast
with a red jewel the weight of the man had sunk him down deep
into the soft cushion so that there wa noth of him to be
seen save the fold of the bellshap cloak the red jewel and
the head he look like a coiledup snake the dark and
glitter ey also were those of a snake of hi featur in
the deep shade of the canopi and of the wide black turban thei
could see noth
the aspect of thi figur wa so terribl and inhuman that the
brethren trembl at the sight of him thei were men and he wa a
man but between that huddl beadyei heap and those two tall
western warrior clad in their gleam mail and colour
cloak helm on brow buckler on arm and long sword at side the
contrast wa that of death and life
chapter twelv the lord of death
masouda ran forward and prostrat herself at full length but
godwin and wulf stare at the heap and the heap stare at them
then at some motion of hi chin masouda aros and said
stranger you stand in the presenc of the master sinan lord
of death kneel and do homag to the master
but the brethren stiffen their back and would not kneel thei
lift their hand to their brow in salut but no more
then from between the black turban and the black cloak came a
hollow voic speak in arab and sai
ar these the men who brought me the lion skin well what
seek ye frank thei stood silent
dread lord said masouda these knight ar but now come from
england over sea and do not understand our tongu

of salaheddin and as he di bade us seek you out what time
had he to tell us of ani ring
the head sank upon the breast
i hope said sinan to masouda that thei had the ring and it
wa for thi reason woman that i allow you to lead these
knight hither after you had report of them and their quest to

signet in the world and he who went befor me when he lai
dy charg me to recov hi if that were possibl let them
go back to their own land and return to me with the ancient ring
and i will help them

as i shall show you how and we will talk again
when thei heard thi sai wulf said to godwin in english
i think that we had best go i do not like thi compani but
godwin made no answer
as thei stood silent thu not know what to sai a man enter
through the door and throw himself on hi hand and knee
crawl toward the cushion through the doubl line of
councillor or dai
your report said sinan in arab
lord answer the man i acquaint you that your will ha been
done in the matter of the vessel then he went on speak in a
low voic so rapidli that the brethren could scarc hear and
much less understand him
sinan listen then said
let the fedai enter and make hi own report bring with him
hi prison
now on of the dai he who sat nearest the canopi rose and
point toward the brethren said
touch these frank what is your will
the beadi ey which seem to search out their soul fix
themselv upon them and for a long while sinan consid thei
trembl know that he wa pass some judgment concern
them in hi heart and that on hi next word much might
hangeven their live
let them stai here he said at length i mai have question to
ask them
for a time there wa silenc sinan lord of death seem to be
lost in thought under the black shade of hi canopi the doubl
line of dai stare at nothing across the passag wai the
giant guard stood still as statu masouda watch the brethren
from beneath her long eyelash while the brethren watch the
sharp edg of the shadow of the canopi on the marbl floor thei
strove to seem unconcern but their heart were beat fast
within them who felt that great thing were about to happen
though what these might be thei knew not
so intens wa the silenc so dread seem that inhuman
snakelik man so strang hi ag passionless councillor and
the place of council surround by a dizzi gulf that fear took
hold of them like the fear of an evil dream godwin wonder if
sinan could see the ring upon hi breast and what would happen
to him if he did see it while wulf long to shout aloud to do
anyth that would break thi deathli sunlit quiet to them
those minut seem like hour inde for aught thei knew
thei might have been hour
at length there wa a stir behind the brethren and at a word
from masouda thei separ fall apart a pace or two and
stood opposit each other and sidewai to sinan stand thu
thei saw the curtain drawn through them came four men carri
a stretcher cover with a cloth beneath which thei could see
the outlin of a form that lai there stirless the four men
brought the stretcher to the front of the canopi set it on the
ground prostrat themselv and retir walk backward
down the length of the terrac
again there wa silenc while the brethren wonder whose corps
it wa that lai beneath the cloth for a corps it must sure
be though neither the lord of the mountain nor hi dai and
guard seem to concern themselv in the matter again the
curtain part and a process advanc up the terrac first
came a great man clad in a white robe blazon with the bleed
dagger after whom walk a tall woman shroud in a long veil
who wa follow by a thickset knight clad in frankish armour
and wear a cape of which the cowl cover hi head as though
to keep the rai of the sun from beat on hi helm lastli
walk four guard up the long place thei march through the
doubl line of dai while with a strang stir in their
breast the brethren watch the shape and movement of the
veil woman who step forward rapidli not see them for
she turn her head neither to the right nor left the leader of
the littl band reach the space befor the canopi and
prostrat himself by the side of the stretcher lai still she
who walk behind him stop also and see the black heap
upon the cushion shudder
woman unveil command the voic of sinan
she hesit then swiftli undid some fasten so that her
draperi fell from her head the brethren stare rub their
ey and stare again
befor them stood rosamund
ye it wa rosamund worn with sick terror and travel
rosamund herself beyond all doubt at the sight of her pale
queenli beauti the heap on the cushion stir beneath hi black
cloak and the beadi ey were fill with an evil eager light
even the dai seem to wake from their contempl and
masouda bit her red lip turn pale beneath her oliv skin and
watch with devour ey wait to read thi woman heart
rosamund cri the brethren with on voic
she heard as thei sprang toward her she glanc wildli from
face to face then with a low cry flung an arm about the neck of
each and would have fallen in the ecstaci of her joi had thei not
held her inde her knee touch the ground as thei stoop
to lift her it flash into godwin mind that masouda had told
sinan that thei were her brethren the thought wa follow by
anoth if thi were so thei might be left with her wherea
otherwis that blackrob devil
listen he whisper in english we ar not your cousinsw
ar your brother your halfbroth and we know no arab
she heard and wulf heard but the watcher thought that thei were
but welcom each other for wulf began to talk also random
word in french such as greet sister well found
sister and kiss her on the forehead
rosamund open her ey which had close and gain her
feet gave on hand to each of the brethren then the voic of
masouda wa heard interpret the word of sinan
it seem ladi that you know these knight
i dowel thei ar my brother from whom i wa stolen when
thei were drug and our father wa kill
how is that ladi see that you ar said to be the niec of
salaheddin ar these knight then the nephew of
salaheddin
nai answer rosamund thei ar my father son but of
anoth wife
the answer appear to satisfi sinan who fix hi ey upon the
pale beauti of rosamund and ask no more question while he
remain thu think a nois aros at the end of the terrac
and the brethren turn their head saw that the thickset
knight wa strive to thrust hi wai through the guard who
stood by the curtain and bar hi path with the shaft of
their spear
then it came into godwin mind that just befor rosamund
unveil he had seen thi knight suddenli turn and walk down the
terrac
the lord sinan look up at the sound and made a sign thereon
two of the dai sprang to their feet and ran toward the curtain
where thei spoke with the knight who turn and came back with
them though slowli as on who is unwil now hi hood had
fallen from hi head and godwin and wulf stare at him as he
advanc for sure thei knew those great shoulder those round
black ey those thick lip and that heavi jowl
lozel it is lozel said godwin
ay echo rosamund it is lozel the doubl traitor who
betrai me first to the soldier of saladin and becaus i
would have none of hi love next to thi lord sinan
wulf heard and as lozel drew near to them sprang forward
with an oath and struck him across the face with hi mail hand
instantli guard thrust themselv between them and sinan ask
through masouda
why do you dare to strike thi frank in my presenc
becaus lord answer wulf he is a rogu who ha brought

so follow by their escort thei rode in the garden take
note without seem to do so of the posit of the tall rock
and of how it could be approach from everi side then thei went
in again and wait for some sign or word of rosamund but in
vain that night there wa no feast and their meal wa brought
to them in the guesthous while thei sat at it masouda appear
for a moment to tell them that thei had leav to ride the bridg
in the moonlight and that their escort would await them at a
certain hour
the brethren ask if their sister rosamund wa not come to

have stabl their hors the brethren wander into the
garden and avoid the cupbear women and the men thei

knee touch the ground and take her hand he kiss it and
said in hi gentl voic

and what he did wulf did also
mayhap she answer sadli two ladiesbut on love
then thei went and creep through the bush to the path
wander about awhil among the revel and came to the
guesthous safe
onc more it wa night and high abov the mountain fortress of
masyaf shone the full summer moon light crag and tower as
with some vast silver lamp forth from the guesthous gate rode
the brethren side by side upon their splendid steed and the
moonrai sparkl on their coat of mail their polish
buckler blazon with the cogniz of a grin skull their
closefit helm and the point of the long tough lanc
that had been given them round them rode their escort while in
front and behind went a mob of peopl
the nation of the assassin had thrown off it gloom thi night
for the while it wa no longer oppress even by the fear of
attack from saladin it mighti foe to death it wa accustom
death wa it watchword death in mani dread form it daili

still greater festiv when their sultan and their god took to

soon weari of her and thei would be call togeth to see her
cast from some topmost tower and hear her frail bone break on
the cruel rock below ora had happen to the last queento
watch her writh out her life in the pang of poison upon a
charg of sorceri it wa inde a night of festiv a night
fill full of promis of rich joi to come
on rode the brethren with stern impass face but wonder
in their heart whether thei would live to see anoth dawn the
shout crowd surg round them break through the circl of
their guard a hand wa thrust up to godwin in it wa a letter
which he took and read by the bright moonlight it wa written in
english and brief

godwin hand the paper to wulf and as he did so saw that the
guard had caught it bearer a wither greyhair woman thei
ask her some question but she shook her head then thei cast
her down trampl the life out of her beneath their hors
hoof and went on laugh the mob laugh also
tear that paper up said godwin wulf did so sai
our rosamund ha a brave heart well we ar of the same blood
and will not fail her
now thei were come to the open space in front of the narrow
bridg where tier on tier the multitud were rang kept back
from it centr by line of guard on the flat roof hous
also thei were crowd thick as swarm bee on the circl
wall and on the battlement that protect the far end of the
bridg and the hous of the outer citi befor the bridg wa a
low gatewai and upon it roof sat the aljeb clad in hi
scarlet robe of festiv and by hi side the moonlight gleam
on her jewel rosamund in front drape in a rich garment a

so a dai stand by himself cast lot upon the ground and
have read them announc that lozel must run the first

pike and he will kill you both befor her ey to whet hi
appetit
but the brethren answer noth
the black hors of lozel grew dim in the distanc of the
moonlit bridg and vanish beneath the farther archwai that led
to the outer citi then a herald cri masouda translat hi
word which anoth herald echo from beyond the gulf
thrice will the trumpet blow at the third blast of the
trumpet the knight shall charg and meet in the centr of the
bridg thenceforward thei mai fight as it pleas them ahors

but er the next stroke could fall wulf arm were about
lozel and the fight for life begun
to and fro thei reel and stagger whirl round and round
till none could tell which of them wa wulf or which hi foe now
thei were on the edg of the abyss and in that last dread
strain for masteri seem to stand there still as stone then
on man began to bend down see hi head hung over further and
further he bent but hi arm could not be loosen
thei will both go cri the multitud in their joi
look a dagger flash onc twice thrice it gleam and those
wrestler fell apart while from deep down in the gulf came the
thud of a fallen bodi
whichoh which cri rosamund from her battlement
sir hugh lozel answer godwin in a solemn voic
then the head of rosamund fell forward on her breast and for a
while she seem to sleep
wulf went to hi hors turn it about on the bridg and
throw hi arm around it neck rest for a space then he
mount and walk slowli toward the inner gate push through
the guard and offic godwin rode out to meet him
brave done brother he said when thei came face to face

littl space befor the archwai there aljeb spoke by
masouda

while he spoke godwin stare upward had note a littl
wander cloud float across the moon slowli it cover it
and the place grew dim
now he whisper and bow to the aljeb thei push
their hors through the open gate where the mob close in on
them thu for a littl while hold back the escort from
follow on their heel thei spoke to flame and smoke and the
good hors plung onward side by side separ the crowd as
the prow of boat separ the water in ten pace it grew thin
in thirti it wa behind them for all folk were gather about
the archwai where thei could see and none beyond forward thei
canter till the broad road turn to the left and in that
faint light thei were hidden
awai said godwin shake hi rein
forward leapt the hors at speed again godwin turn take
that road which ran round the citi wall and through the garden
leav the guestcastl to the left wherea their escort
follow that wherebi thei had come which pass along the main
street of the inner town think that thei were ahead of them
three minut more and thei were in the lone garden in which
that night no women wander and no neophyt dream in the
pavilion
wulf said godwin as thei swept forward skim the turf
like swallow draw your sword and be readi rememb the secret
cave mai be guard and if so we must kill or be kill
wulf nod and next instant two long blade flash in the
moonlight for the littl cloud had pass awai within a
hundr pace of them rose the tall rock but between it and the
mound were two mount guard these heard the beat of hors
hoof and wheel about stare to see two arm knight
sweep down upon them like a whirlwind thei call to them to
stop hesit then rode forward a few pace as though
wonder whether thi were not a vision
in a moment the brethren were on them the soldier lift their
lanc but er thei could thrust the sword of godwin had caught
on between neck and shoulder and sunk to hi breast bone while
the sword of wulf us as a spear had pierc the other through
and through so that those men fell dead by the door of the
mound never know who had slain them
the brethren pull upon their bridl and spoke to flame and
smoke halt them within a score of yard then thei wheel
round and sprang from their saddl on of the dead guard still
held hi horsess rein and the other beast stood by snort
godwin caught it befor it stir then hold all four of
them threw the kei to wulf and bade him unlock the door soon it
wa done although he stagger at the task then he held the
hors while on by on godwin led them in and that without
troubl for the beast thought that thi wa but a cavehewn
stabl of a kind to which thei were accustom
what of the dead men said wulf
thei had best keep us compani answer godwin and run
out he carri in first on and then the other
swift he said as he threw down the second corps shut the
door i caught sight of horsemen ride through the tree nai
thei saw noth
so thei lock the massiv door and bar it and with beat
heart wait in the dark expect everi moment to hear
soldier batter at it timber but no sound came the
searcher if such thei were had pass on to seek elsewher
now while wulf made shift to fasten up the hors near the mouth
of the cave godwin gather stone as larg as he could lift
and pile them up against the door till thei knew that it would
take mani men an hour or more to break through
for thi door wa band with iron and set fast in the live
rock
chapter fifteen the flight to emesa
then came the weariest time of wait the brethren had ever
known or were to know although at first thei did not feel it so
long and heavi water trickl from the wall of thi cave and
wulf who wa parch with thirst gather it in hi hand and
drank till he wa satisfi then he let it run upon hi head to
cool it ach and godwin bath such of hi brother hurt
and bruis as could be come at for he did not dare to remov
the hauberk and so gave him comfort
when thi wa done and he had look to the saddl and
trap of the hors wulf told of all that had pass between
him and lozel on the bridg how at the first onset hi spear
had caught in the link of and torn awai the headpiec of hi
foe who if the lace had not burst would have been hurl to
death while that of lozel struck hi buckler fair and
shatter on it rend it from hi arm how thei push past
each other and for a moment the fore hoof of smoke hung over
the abyss so that he thought he wa sure sped how at the next
cours lozel spear pass beneath hi arm while hi
strike full upon sir hugh breast brought down the black
hors and hi rider as though a thunderbolt had smitten them and
how smoke that could not check it furiou pace leapt over
them as a hors leap ahunt how he would not ride down
lozel but dismount to finish the frai in knightli fashion
and be shieldless receiv the full weight of the great
sword upon hi mail so that he stagger back and would have
fallen had he not struck against the hors
then he told of the blow that follow and of hi last that
wound lozel shear through hi mail and fell him as an
ox is fell by the butcher how also when he sprang forward to
kill him thi mighti and brutal man had prai for merci prai
it in the name of christ and of their own mother whom as a child
he knew in essex how he could not slaughter him be helpless
but turn awai sai that he left him to be dealt with by
aljeb whereupon thi traitor dog sprang up and strove to
knife him he told also of their last fear struggl and how
shaken as he wa by the blow upon hi back although the point of
the dagger had not pierc hi mail he strove with lozel man
to man till at length hi youth great natur strength and the
skill he had in wrestl learnt in mani a villag bout at home
enabl him to prevail and while thei hung togeth on the
peril edg of the gulf to free hi right hand draw hi
poniard and make an end
yet ad wulf never shall i forget the look of that man
ey as he fell backward or the whistl scream which came
from hi pierc throat
at least there is a rogu the less in the world although he wa
a brave on in hi own knavish fashion answer godwin
moreov my brother he ad place hi arm about wulf
neck i am glad it fell to you to fight him for at the last
grip your might overcam where i who am not so strong should
have fail further i think you did well to show merci as a
good knight should that therebi you have gain great honour
and that if hi spirit can see through the dark our dead
uncl is proud of you now as i am my brother
i thank you repli wulf simpli but in thi hour of
torment who can think of such thing as honour gain
then lest he should grow stiff who wa sore bruis beneath
hi mail thei began to walk up and down the cave from where the
hors stood to where the two dead assassin lai by the door the
faint light gleam upon their stern dark featur ill compani
thei seem in that silent lone place
the time crept on the moon sank toward the mountain
what if thei do not come ask wulf
let us wait to think of it till dawn answer godwin
again thei walk the length of the cave and back
how can thei come the door be bar ask wulf
how did masouda come and go answer godwin oh question me
no more it is in the hand of god
look said wulf in a whisper who stand yonder at the end of
the cavether by the dead men
their spirit perchanc answer godwin draw hi sword
and lean forward then he look and true enough there stood
two figur faintli outlin in the gloom thei glide toward
them and now the level moonlight shone upon their white robe
and gleam in the gem thei wore
i cannot see them said a voic oh those dead soldierswhat
do thei portend
at least yonder stand their hors answer anoth voic
now the brethren guess the truth and like men in a dream
step forward from the shadow of the wall
rosamund thei said
oh godwin oh wulf she cri in answer oh jesu i thank
thee i thank theethe and thi brave woman and cast her
arm about masouda she kiss her on the face
masouda push her back and said in a voic that wa almost
harsh it is not fit princess that your pure lip should
touch the cheek of a woman of the assassin
but rosamund would not be repuls
it is most fit she sob that i should give you thank
who but for you must also have becom a woman of the assassin
or an inhabit of the hous of death
then masouda kiss her back and thrust her awai into the
arm of wulf said roughli
so pilgrim peter and john your patron saint have brought you
through so far and john you fight right well nai do not stop
for our stori if you wish us to live to tell it what you have
the soldier hors with your own well done i did not credit
you with so much wit now sir wulf can you walk ye so much
the better it will save you a rough ride for thi place is
steep though not so steep as on you know of now set the
princess upon flame for no cat is surerfoot than that hors
as you mai rememb peter i who know the path will lead it
john take you the other two peter do you follow last of all
with smoke and if thei hang back prick them with your sword
come flame be not afraid flame where i go you can come and
masouda thrust her wai through the bush and over the edg of
the cliff talk to the snort hors and pat it neck
a minut more and thei were scrambl down a mountain ridg so
steep that it seem as though thei must fall and be dash to
piec at the bottom yet thei fell not for made as it had been
to meet such hour of need thi road wa safer than it appear
with ridg cut in the rock at the worst place
down thei went and down till at length pant but safe thei
stood at the bottom of the darksom gulf where onli the starlight
shone for here the rai of the low moon could not reach
mount said masouda princess stai you on flame he is the
surest and the swiftest sir wulf keep your own hors smoke
your brother and i will ride those of the soldier though not
veri swift doubtless thei ar good beast and accustom to
such road then she leapt to the saddl as a woman born in the
desert can and push her hors in front
for a mile or more masouda led them along the rocki bottom of the
gulf where becaus of the stone thei could onli travel at a
foot pace till thei came to a deep cleft on the left hand up
which thei began to ride by now the moon wa quit behind the
mountain and such faint light as came from the star began to
be obscur with drift cloud still thei stumbl on till
thei reach a littl glade where water ran and grass grew
halt said masouda here we must wait till dawn for in thi
dark the hors cannot keep their foot on the stone
moreov all about us lie precipic over on of which we might
fall
but thei will pursu us plead rosamund
not until thei have light to see by answer masouda or at
least we must take the risk for to go forward would be mad
sit down and rest a while and let the hors drink a littl and
eat a mouth of grass hold their rein in our hand for we
and thei mai need all our strength befor tomorrow sun is set

to eat and drink
the rest is short befor the two hour were gone a messeng
came sai that the aljeb bade me do what he had command

present alon as it is command
then i threw thi cloak about her and bade her be brave and if
we fail to choos whether she would take sinan or death for
lord next i took the ring you had the signet of the dead
aljeb who gave it to your kinsman and held it befor the
slave who bow and let me pass we came to the guard and to
them again i show the ring thei bow also but when thei saw
that we turn down the passag to the left and not to the
right as we should have done to come to the door of the inner
palac thei would have stop us
acknowledg the signet i answer dog what is it to you
which road the signet take then thei also let us pass
now follow the passag we were out of the guest hous and
in the garden and i led her to what is call the prison tower
whenc run the secret wai here were more guard whom i bade
open in the name of sinan
thei said we obei not thi place is shut save to the signet
itself
behold it i answer the offic look and said it is

secretli from the palac woe to you if he doe not find hi ladi
there
it is the signet that he must have sent sure enough the
captain said again to disobei which is death
ye open open whisper hi companion
so thei open though doubtfulli and we enter and i bar
the door behind us then to be short through the dark of
the tower basement guid ourselv by the wall we crept to
the entranc of that wai of which i know the secret ay and
along all it length and through the rock door of escap at the
end of which i set so that none can turn it save skill mason
with their tool and into the cave where we found you it wa no
great matter have the signet although without the signet it
had not been possibl tonight when everi gate is guard
no great matter gasp rosamund oh godwin and wulf if you
could know how she thought of and made readi everyth if you
could have seen how all those cruel men glare at us search
out our veri soul if you could have heard how high she answer
them wave that ring befor their ey and bid them to obei

though i do not piti them who were wick nai thank me not i
have done what i promis to do neither less nor more andi
love danger and a high stake tell us your stori sir godwin
so seat there on the grass in the dark he told them of
their mad ride and of the slai of the guard while rosamund
rais her hand and thank heaven for it merci and that
thei were without those accurs wall
you mai be within them again befor sunset said masouda
grimli
ye answer wulf but not aliv now what plan have you to
ride for the coast town
no repli masouda at least not straight sinc to do so we
must pass through the countri of the assassin who by thi dai
light will be warn to watch for us we must ride through the
desert mountain land to emesa mani mile awai and cross the
oront there then down into baalbec and so back to beirut
emesa said godwin why saladin hold that place and of
baalbec the ladi rosamund is princess
which is best ask masouda shortli that she should fall
into the hand of salaheddin or back into those of the master
of the assassin choos which you wish
i choos salaheddin broke in rosamund for at least he is
my uncl and will do me no wrong nor know the case did
the other gainsai her
now at length the summer dai began to break and while it wa
still too dark to travel godwin and rosamund let the hors
graze hold them by their bridl masouda also take off
the hauberk of wulf doctor hi bruis as best she could with
the crush leav of a bush that grew by the stream have
first wash them with water and though the time wa short
eas him much then so soon as the dawn wa grei have drunk
their fill and as thei had noth els eaten some watercress
that grew in the stream thei tighten their saddl girth and
start scarc had thei gone a hundr yard when from the
gulf beneath that wa hidden in grei mist thei heard the sound
of hors hoof and men voic
push on said masouda aljeb is on our track
upward thei climb through the gather light skirt the
edg of dread precipic which in the gloom it would have been
imposs to pass till at length thei reach a great tabl
land that ran to the foot of some mountain a dozen mile or
more awai among those mountain soar two peak set close
togeth to these masouda point sai that their road ran
between them and that beyond lai the vallei of the oront
while she spoke far behind them thei heard the sound of men
shout although thei could see noth becaus of the dens
mist
push on said masouda there is no time to spare and thei
went forward but onli at a hand gallop for the ground wa
still rough and the light uncertain
when thei had cover some six mile of the distanc between them
and the mountain pass the sun rose suddenli and suck up the
mist thi wa what thei saw befor them lai a flat sandi
plain behind the stoni ground that thei had travers and
ride over it two mile from them some twenti men of the
assassin
thei cannot catch us said wulf but masouda point to the
right where the mist still hung and said
yonder i see spear
present it thin and there a leagu awai thei saw a great
bodi of mount soldiersperhap there were four hundr
look she said thei have come round dure the night as i
fear thei would now we must cross the path befor them or be
taken and she struck her hors fierc with a stick she had
cut at the stream half a mile further on a shout from the great
bodi of men to their right which wa answer by anoth shout
from those behind told them that thei were seen
on said masouda the race will be close so thei began to
gallop their best
two mile were done but although that behind wa far off the
great cloud of dust to their right grew ever nearer till it
seem as though it must reach the mouth of the mountain pass
befor them then godwin spoke
wulf and rosamund ride on your hors ar swift and can outpac
them at the crest of the mountain pass wait a while to breath
the beast and see if we come if not ride on again and god be
with you
ay said masouda ride and head for the emesa bridgeit can
be seen from farand there yield yourselv to the offic of
salaheddin
thei hung back but in a stern voic godwin repeat
ride i command you both
for rosamund sake so be it answer wulf
then he call to smoke and flame and thei stretch
themselv out upon the sand and pass thenc swifter than
swallow soon godwin and masouda toil behind saw them enter
the mouth of the pass
good she said except those of their own breed there ar no
hors in syria that can catch those two thei will come to
emesa have no fear
who wa the man who brought them to us ask godwin as thei
gallop side by side their ey fix upon the evernear
cloud of dust in which the spear point sparkl
my father brothermi uncl as i call him she answer
he is a sheik of the desert who own the ancient breed that
cannot be bought for gold
then you ar not of the assassin masouda
no i mai tell you now that the end seem near my father wa
an arab my mother a nobl frank a french woman whom he found
starv in the desert after a fight and took to hi tent and
made hi wife the assassin fell upon us and kill him and her
and captur me as a child of twelv afterward when i grew
older be beauti in those dai i wa taken to the harem of
sinan and although in secret i had been bred up a christian by
my mother thei swore me of hi accurs faith now you will
understand why i hate him so sore who murder my father and my
mother and made me what i am why i hold myself so vile also

aveng upon him

in the ey in such a fashion that he drop hi head befor her
burn gaze who hold you dear sir godwin for whose sake i
have dare these thing although i am nought to you nai speak
not the ladi rosamund ha told me all that storyexcept it
answer
now thei were off the sand over which thei had been race side
by side and begin to breast the mountain slope nor wa
godwin sorri that the clatter of their hors hoof upon the
stone prevent further speech between them so far thei had
outpac the assassin who had a longer and a rougher road to
travel but the great cloud of dust wa not seven hundr yard
awai and in front of it shake their spear rode some of the
best mount of their soldier
these hors still have strength thei ar better than i thought
them cri masouda thei will not gain on us across the
mountain but afterward
for the next leagu thei spoke no more who must keep their
hors from fall as thei toil up the steep path at length
thei reach the crest and there on the veri top of it saw
wulf and rosamund stand by flame and smoke
thei rest godwin said then he shout mount mount the foe
is close
so thei climb to their saddl again and all four of them
togeth began to descend the long slope that stretch to the
plain two leagu beneath far off across thi plain ran a broad
silver streak beyond which from that height thei could see the
wall of a citi
the oront cri masouda cross that and we ar safe but
godwin look first at hi hors then at masouda and shook hi
head
well might he do so for stoutheart as thei were the beast
were much distress that had gallop so far without draw
rein down the steep road thei plung pant inde at time
it wa hard to keep them on their feet
thei will reach the plainno more said godwin and masouda
nod
the descent wa almost done and not a mile behind them the
whiterob assassin stream endlessli godwin pli hi spur
and masouda her whip although with littl hope for thei knew
that the end wa near down the last decliv thei rush till
suddenli as thei reach it foot masouda hors reel
stop and sank to the ground while godwin pull up besid
it
ride on he cri to rosamund and wulf in front but thei
would not he storm at them but thei repli nai we will
die togeth
masouda look at the hors flame and smoke which seem but
littl troubl
so be it she said thei have carri doubl befor and must
again mount in front of the ladi sir godwin and sir wulf
give me your hand and you will learn what thi breed can do
so thei mount forward start flame and smoke with a long
swing gallop while from the assassin abov who thought that
thei held them went up a shout of rage and wonder
their hors ar also tire and we mai beat them yet call
the dauntless masouda but godwin and wulf look sadli at the
ten mile of plain between them and the river bank
on thei went and on a quarter of it wa done half of it wa
done but now the first of the fedai hung upon their flank not
two hundr yard behind littl by littl thi distanc
lessen at length thei were scarc fifti yard awai and on
of them flung a spear in her terror rosamund sob aloud
spur the hors knight cri masouda and for the first time
thei spur them
at the sting of the steel flame and smoke sprang forward as
though thei had but just left their stabl door and the gap
between pursuer and pursu widen two more mile were done
and scarc seven furlong from them thei saw the broad mouth of
the bridg while the tower of emesa beyond seem so close that
in thi clear air thei could discern the watchmen outlin
against the sky then thei descend a littl vallei and lost
sight of bridg and town
at the rise of the oppos slope the strength of flame and smoke
at last began to fail beneath their doubl burden thei pant
and trembl and save in short rush no longer answer to
the spur the assassin saw and came on with wild shout nearer
and nearer thei drew and the sound of their hors hoof beat
on the sand wa like the sound of thunder now onc more thei
were fifti yard awai and now but thirti and again the spear
began to flash though none struck them
masouda scream to the hors in arab and gallantli did thei
struggl plung up the hill with slow convuls bound
godwin and wulf look at each other then at a signal check
their speed leapt to earth and turn drew their sword
on thei cri and lighten of their weight onc more the
reel hors plung forward
the assassin were upon them wulf struck a mighti blow and
empti the saddl of the first then wa swept to earth as he
fell from behind him he heard a scream of joi and struggl to
hi knee look round lo from over the crest of the rise
rush squadron upon squadron of turban cavalri who as thei
came set their lanc in rest and shout

saracen
to wulf too a hors wa brought but he could not struggl to
it saddl thrice he strove then fell backward and lai upon
the sand wave hi sword and shout where he lai while
masouda stood by him a dagger in her hand and with her rosamund
upon her knee
now the pursuer were the pursu and dread wa the reckon
that thei must pai their hors were outworn and could not fly
at speed some of the fedai were cut down upon them some
dismount and gather themselv in littl group fought
brave till thei were slain while a few were taken prison
of all that great troup of men not a score won back aliv to
masyaf to make report to their master of how the chase of hi
lost bride had end
a while later and wulf from hi seat upon the ground saw godwin
ride back toward him hi red sword in hi hand with him rode
a sturdi brightei man gorgeous apparel at the sight of
whom rosamund sprang to her feet then as he dismount ran
forward and with a littl cry cast her arm about him

the emir look at her her long hair loos her face stain

hassan shook hi head and answer

he look meaningli at wulf and godwin and my order were to
rescu the princess and no more well she ha been rescu and

so the bearer came and lift up wulf and help godwin from
hi horsefor now that all wa over he could scarc standand
with him rosamund and masouda place them in the litter thei
carri them escort by cavalri across the bridg of the
oront into the citi of emesa where thei lodg them in the
citadel
here also after give them a drink of barlei gruel and rub
their back and leg with ointment thei led the hors smoke and
flame slowli and with great troubl for these could hardli
stir and laid them down on thick bed of straw tempt them
with food which after awhil thei at the fourrosamund
masouda godwin and wulfat also of some soup with wine in
it and after the hurt of wulf had been tend by a skill
doctor went to their bed whenc thei did not rise again for
two dai
chapter sixteen the sultan saladin
in the third morn godwin awok to see the rai of sunris
stream through the lattic window
thei fell upon anoth bed nearbi where wulf still lai sleep
a bandag on hi head that had been hurt in the last charg
against the assassin and other bandag about hi arm and
bodi which were much bruis in the fight upon the dread
bridg
wondrou wa it to godwin to watch him ly there sleep
healthili notwithstand hi injuri and to think of what
thei had gone through togeth with so littl harm to think
also of how thei had rescu rosamund out of the veri mouth of
that earthli hell of which he could see the peak through the
open windowplaceout of the veri hand of that fiend it
ruler reckon the tale dai by dai he reflect on their
adventur sinc thei land at beirut and saw how heaven had
guid their everi step
in face of the warn that were given them to visit the
aljeb in hi stronghold had seem a mad yet there
where none could have thought that she would be thei had found
rosamund there thei had been aveng upon the fals knight sir
hugh lozel who had betrai her first to saladin then to
sinan and sent him down to death and judgment and thenc thei
had rescu rosamund
oh how wise thei had been to obei the dy word of their
uncl sir andrew who doubtless wa given foresight at the end
god and hi saint had help them who could not have help
themselv and hi minist had been masouda but for masouda
rosamund would by now be lost or dead and thei if their live
were still left to them would be wander in the great land of
syria seek for on who never could be found
why had masouda done these thing again and again put her
own life upon the hazard to save their and the honour of anoth
woman as he ask himself the question godwin felt the red blood
rise to hi face becaus she hate sinan who had murder her
parent and degrad her she said and doubtless that had to do
with the matter but it wa no longer possibl to hide the truth
she love him and had love him from the first hour when thei
met he had alwai suspect itin that wild trial of the hors
upon the mountain side when she sat with her arm about him and
her face press against hi face when she kiss hi feet after
he had save her from the lion and mani anoth time
but as thei follow wulf and rosamund up the mountain pass while
the host of the assassin thunder at their heel and in broken
gasp she had told him of her sad histori then it wa that he
grew sure then too he had said that he held her not vile but
nobl as inde he did and think their death upon them she
had answer that she held him dear and look on him as a woman
look upon her onli lovea messag in her ey that no man could
fail to read yet if thi were so why had masouda save
rosamund the ladi to whom she knew well that he wa sworn
rear among those cruel folk who could wade to their desir
through blood and think it honour would she not have left her
rival to her doom see that oath do not hold beyond the
grave
an answer came into the heart of godwin at the veri thought of
which he turn pale and trembl hi brother wa also sworn to
rosamund and she in her soul must be sworn to on of them wa
it not to wulf wulf who wa handsom and more strong than he
to wulf the conqueror of lozel had rosamund told masouda
thi nai sure not
yet women can read each other heart pierc veil through
which no man mai see and perchanc masouda had read the heart of
rosamund she stood behind her dure the dread duel at the
gate and watch her face when wulf death seem sure she
might have heard word that broke in agoni from her lip in those
moment of torment
oh without doubt it wa so and masouda had protect rosamund
becaus she knew that her love wa for wulf and not for him the
thought wa veri bitter and in it pain godwin groan aloud
while a fierc jealousi of the brave and handsom knight who
slept at hi side dream doubtless of the fame that he had
won and the reward by which it would be crown grip hi
vital like the ici hand of death then godwin rememb the
oath that thei two had sworn far awai in the priori at stangat
and the love pass the love of woman which he bore toward thi
brother and the duti of a christian warrior whereto he wa
vow and hide hi face in hi pillow he prai for strength
it would seem that it came to himat least when he lift hi
head again the jealousi wa gone and onli the great grief
remain fear remain alsofor what of masouda how should he
deal with her he wa certain that thi wa no fanci which would
passuntil her life pass with it and beauti as she wa
and nobl as she wa he did not wish her love he could find no
answer to these question save thisthat thing must go on as
thei were decre for himself he godwin would strive to do
hi duti to keep hi hand clean and await the end whatev
that might be
wulf woke up stretch hi arm exclaim becaus that action
hurt him grumbl at the bright of the light upon hi ey
and said that he wa veri hungri then he aros and with the
help of godwin dress himself but not in hi armour here
with the yellowco soldier of saladin gravefac and
watch pace befor their doorfor night and dai thei were
trebli guard lest assassin should creep inther wa no need
for mail in the fortress of masyaf inde where thei were also
guard it had been otherwis wulf heard the step of the
sentri on the cement pavement without and shook hi great
shoulder as though he shiver
that sound make my backbon cold he said for a moment as
my ey open i thought that we were back again in the guest
chamber of aljeb where folk crept round us as we slept and
murder march to and fro outsid the curtain finger
their knifepoint well whatev there is to come thank the
saint that is done with i tell you brother i have had enough
of mountain and narrow bridg and assassin henceforth i
desir to live upon a flat with never a hill in sight amidst
honest folk as stupid as their own sheep who go to church on

that same afternoon thei start for damascu a great armi of

notwithstand hi hurt wulf would not be carriedth
brethren mount upon ambl palfrei after them led by
slave came the charger flame and smoke recov now but
still walk somewhat stiffli and then rank upon rank of
turban saracen through the open curtain of her litter
rosamund beckon to the brethren who push alongsid of her

thei look and there bath in the glori of the sink sun
saw the mountain crown far far awai with the impregn citi
and fortress of masyaf and below it the slope down which thei
had ridden for their live nearer to them flash the river
border by the town of emesa set at interv along it wall

and the next we have done with it
ye ad godwin in hi thought voic still out of that
evil place we won good for there we found rosamund and there
my brother you conquer in such a frai as you can never hope to
fight again gain great glori and perhap much more
then rein in hi hors godwin fell back behind the litter
while wulf wonder and rosamund watch him with dream ey
that even thei camp in the desert and next morn
surround by wander tribe of bedouin mount on their
camel march on again sleep that night in the ancient

solemn turban men who had been command so to do by
messeng from the sultan brought her the kei of the gate on
a cushion minstrel and soldier march befor her whilst
crowd the wall and run alongsid came the citizen in
their thousand thu she went on through the open gate past
the tower column of ruin templ onc a home of the worship
of heathen god through court and vault to the citadel
surround by it garden that in dead ag had been the
acropoli of forgotten roman emperor
here in the portico rosamund turn her hors and receiv the
salut of the multitud as though she also were on of the
world ruler inde it seem to the brethren watch her as
she sat upon the great white hors and survei the shout
bend crowd with flash ey splendid in her bear and
beauti to see a princ at her stirrup and an armi at her
back that none of those who had trod that path befor her could
have seem greater or more gloriou in the hour of their pride
than did thi english girl who by the whim of fate had suddenli
been set so high truli by blood and natur she wa fit to be
a queen yet as rosamund sat thu the pride pass from her face
and her ey fell
of what ar you think ask godwin at her side
that i would we were back among the summer field at steepl
she answer for those who ar lift high fall low princ
hassan give the captain and peopl my thank and bid them be
gone i would rest
thu for the first and last time did rosamund behold her ancient
fief of baalbec which her grandsir the great ayoub had rule
befor her

and sing and minstrelsi and the danc of fair women and the
give of gift for baalbec where birth and beauti were ever
welcom did honour to it ladi the favour niec of the mighti
salaheddin yet there were some who murmur that she would
bring no good fortun to the sultan or thi hi citi who wa not
all of the blood of ayoub but half a frank and a cross
worshipp though even these prais her beauti and her royal
bear the brethren thei prais also although these were
unbeliev and the tale of how wulf had fought the traitor
knight upon the narrow wai and of how thei had led their
kinswoman from the haunt fortress of masyaf wa pass from
mouth to mouth at dawn the next dai on order receiv from
the sultan thei left baalbec escort by the armi and mani of
the notabl of the town that afternoon thei drew rein upon the
height which overlook the citi of damascu bride of the earth
set amidst it seven stream and ring about with garden on
of the most beauti and perhap the most ancient citi in the
world then thei rode down to the bounteou plain and as night
fell have pass the encircl garden were escort through
the gate of damascu outsid of which most of the armi halt
and encamp
along the narrow street border by yellow flatroof hous
thei rode slowli look now at the motlei manycolour
crowd who watch them with grave interest and now at the
state build dome mosqu and tower minaret which
everywher stood out against the deep blue of the even sky
thu at length thei came to an open space plant like a garden
beyond which wa seen a huge and fantast castl that hassan
told them wa the palac of salaheddin in it courtyard thei
were part rosamund be led awai by offic of state whilst
the brethren were taken to chamber that had been prepar
where after thei had bath thei were serv with food
scarc had thei eaten it when hassan appear and bade them
follow him pass down variou passag and across a court thei
came to some guard door where the soldier demand that thei
should give up their sword and dagger
it is not need said hassan and thei let them go by next
came more passag and a curtain beyond which thei found
themselv in a small dome room lit by hang silver lamp
and pave in tessel marbl strewn with rich rug and
furnish with cushion couch
at a sign from hassan the brethren stood still in the centr of
thi room and look about them wonder the place wa empti
and veri silent thei felt afraidof what thei knew not
present curtain upon it further side open and through them
came a man turban and wrap in a dark robe who stood awhil
in the shadow gaze at them beneath the lamp
the man wa not veri tall and slight in build yet about him wa
much majesti although hi garb wa such as the humblest might
have worn he came forward lift hi head and thei saw that
hi featur were small and fine cut that he wa beard and
beneath hi broad brow shone thought yet at time pierc
ey which were brown in hue now the princ hassan sank to hi
knee and touch the marbl with hi forehead and guess
that thei were in the presenc of the mighti monarch saladin the
brethren salut in their western fashion present the sultan
spoke in a low even voic to hassan to whom he motion that he
should rise sai
i can see that you trust these knight emir and he point to
their great sword
sire wa the answer i trust them as i trust myself thei ar
brave and honour men although thei be infidel
the sultan stroke hi beard
ay he said infidel it is a piti yet doubtless thei

the sultan stare at them in surpris

saladin stroke hi beard and consid them while hassan
smile a littl
then knight he said present tell me which of you doe

that sire is known to her alon when the time come she will

i perceiv said saladin that behind thi riddl hide a
stori if it is your good pleasur be seat and set it out to

so thei sat down on the divan and obei keep noth back
from the begin to the end nor although the tale wa long
did the sultan weari of listen
a great stori truli he said when at length thei had
finish and on in which i seem to see the hand of allah sir
knight you will think that i have wrong youai and your

certainli die and that if she escap from me and i recaptur
her then she shall die these thing i have told her alreadi
and i swear them in the name of allah here she is and in my
hous she must abid until the vision be fulfil
now in their dismai the brethren look at each other for thei
seem further from their desir than thei had been even in the
castl of sinan then a light broke upon the face of godwin and
he stood up and answer
dread lord of all the east we hear you and we know our risk
you have given us your friendship we accept it and ar

then he wave hi hand to show that the audienc wa end
chapter seventeen the brethren depart from damascu
at the court of saladin godwin and wulf were treat with much
honour a hous wa given them to dwell in and a compani of
servant to minist to their comfort and to guard them mount
on their swift hors flame and smoke thei were taken out into
the desert to hunt and had thei so will it would have been
easi for them to outdist their retinu and companion and
ride awai to the nearest christian town inde no hand would
have been lift to stai them who were free to come or go but
whither were thei to go without rosamund
saladin thei saw often for it pleas him to tell them tale of
those dai when their father and uncl were in the east or to
talk with them of england and the frank and even now and again
to reason with godwin on matter of religion moreov to show
hi faith in them he gave them the rank of offic of hi own
bodyguard and when weari of idl thei ask it of him
allow them to take their share of duti in the guard of hi
palac and person thi at a time when peac still reign
between frank and saracen the brethren were not asham to do
who receiv no payment for their servic
peac reign inde but godwin and wulf could guess that it
would not reign for long damascu and the plain around it were
on great camp and everi dai new thousand of wild tribesmen
pour in and took up the quarter that had been prepar for
them thei ask masouda who knew everyth what it meant she
answer
it mean the jihad the holi war which is be preach in
everi mosqu throughout the east it mean that the great
struggl between cross and crescent is at hand and then
pilgrim peter and john you will have to choos your standard
there can be littl doubt about that said wulf
none repli masouda with on of her smile onli it mai
pain you to have to make war upon the princess of baalbec and her
uncl the command of the faith
then she went still smile for thi wa the troubl of it
rosamund their cousin and their love had in truth becom the
princess of baalbecfor them she live in great state and
freedom as saladin had promis that she should live in hi
letter to sir andrew darci no insult or violenc were offer
to her faith no suitor wa thrust upon her but she wa in a
land where women do not consort with men especi if thei be
highplac as a princess of the empir of saladin she must
obei it rule even to veil herself when she went abroad and
exchang no privat word with men godwin and wulf prai
saladin that thei might be allow to speak with her from time to
time but he onli answer shortli
sir knight our custom ar our custom moreov the less you
see of the princess of baalbec the better i think it will be for
her for you whose blood i do not wish to have upon my hand
and for myself who await the fulfil of that dream which the
angel brought
then the brethren left hi presenc sore at heart for although
thei saw her from time to time at feast and festiv rosamund
wa as far apart from them as though she sat in steepl
hallai and further also thei came to see that of rescu her
from damascu there wa no hope at all she dwelt in her own
palac whereof the wall were guard night and dai by a compani
of the sultan mameluk who knew that thei were answer for
her with their live within it wall again live trust
eunuch under the command of a cun fellow name mesrour
and her retinu of women all of them spi and watch how
could two men hope to snatch her from the heart of such a host
and to spirit her out of damascu and through it encircl
armi
on comfort howev wa left to them when she reach the
court rosamund had prai of the sultan that masouda should not
be separ from her and thi becaus of the part she had
plai in hi niec rescu from the power of sinan he had
grant though doubtfulli moreov masouda be a person of
no account except for her beauti and a heret wa allow to
go where she would and to speak with whom she wish so as she
wish to speak often with godwin thei did not lack for tide
of rosamund
from her thei learn that in a fashion the princess wa happi
enoughwho would not be that had just escap from
aljebalyet weari of the strang eastern life of the
restraint upon her and of her aimless dai vex also that she
might not mix with the brethren dai by dai she sent them her
greet and with them warn to attempt nothingnot even
to see hersinc there wa no hope that thei would succe so
much afraid of them wa the sultan rosamund said that both she
and thei were watch dai and night and of ani folli their live
would pai the price when thei heard all thi the brethren began
to despair and their spirit sank so low that thei care not
what should happen to them
then it wa that a chanc came to them of which the issu wa to
make them still more admir by saladin and to lift masouda to
honour on hot morn thei were seat in the courtyard of
their hous besid the fountain stare at the passersbi
through the bar of the bronz gate and at the sentri who

with the blood of their own peopl weari too of the hopeless
task to which thei were sworn rosamund wa on of thi
multitud she wa the princess of baalbec half an eastern by
her blood and grow more eastern dai by dayor so thei
thought in their bitter as well might two saracen hope to
snatch the queen of england from her palac at westminst as
thei to drag the princess of baalbec out of the power of a
monarch more absolut than ani king of england
so thei sat silent sinc thei had noth to sai and stare now
at the pass crowd and now at the thin stream of water fall
continu into the marbl basin

woman wrap in a long cloak talk with the guard who with a

knife flash and the soldier step back still laugh and
open the wicket the woman came in it wa masouda thei rose
and bow to her but she pass befor them into the hous

it wa near midnight and the brethren stood in the small dome
antechamb from which a door open into the sleep room of
saladin the guard of eight mameluk had left them to be met by
their relief in the courtyard accord to custom but no relief
had as yet appear in the antechamb
it would seem that masouda tale is true said godwin and
go to the door he lock it and hid the kei beneath a
cushion
then thei took their stand in front of the lock door befor
which hung curtain stand in the shadow with the light from
the hang silver lamp pour down in front of them here thei
wait awhil in silenc till at length thei heard the tramp of
men and eight mameluk clad in yellow abov their mail march
in and salut
stand said godwin and thei stood a minut then began to edg
forward
stand said both the brethren again but still thei edg
forward
stand son of sinan thei said a third time draw their
sword
then with a hiss of disappoint rage the fedai came at them
a darci a darci help for the sultan shout the brethren
and the frai began
six of the men attack them and while thei were engag with
these the other two slip round and tri the door onli to
find it fast then thei also turn upon the brethren think
to take the kei from off their bodi at the first rush two of
the fedai went down beneath the sweep of the long sword but
after that the murder would not come close and while some
engag them in front other strove to pass and stab them from
behind inde a blow from on of their long knive fell upon
godwin shoulder but the good mail turn it
give wai he cri to wulf or thei will best us
so suddenli thei gave wai befor them till their back were
against the door and there thei stood shout for help and
sweep round them with their sword into reach of which the
fedai dare not come now from without the chamber rose a cry and
tumult and the sound of heavi blow fall upon the gate that
the murder had bar behind them while upon the further side
of the door which he could not open wa heard the voic of the
sultan demand to know what pass
the fedai heard these sound also and read in them their doom
forget caution in their despair and rage thei hurl
themselv upon the brethren for thei thought that if thei could
get them down thei might still break through the door and slai
salaheddin befor thei themselv were slain but for awhil
the brethren stop their rush with point and buckler wound
two of them sore and when at length thei close in upon them
the gate were burst and hassan and the outer guard were at
hand
a minut later and but littl hurt godwin and wulf were lean
on their sword and the fedai some of them dead or wound and
some of them captiv lai befor them on the marbl floor
moreov the door had been open and through it came the
sultan in hi nightgear
what ha chanc he ask look at them doubtfulli
onli thi lord answer godwin these men came to kill you
and we held them off till help arriv
kill me my own guard kill me
thei ar not your guard thei ar fedai disguis as your
guard and sent by aljeb as he promis
now salaheddin turn pale for he who fear noth els wa
all hi life afraid of the assassin and their lord who thrice
had striven to murder him
strip the armour from those men went on godwin and i think
that you will find truth in my word or if not question such
of them as still live
thei obei and there upon the breast of on of them burnt into
hi skin wa the symbol of the bloodr dagger now saladin
saw and beckon the brethren asid
how knew you of thi he ask search them with hi
pierc ey
masouda the ladi rosamund wait woman warn us that you
lord and we were to be murder tonight by eight men so we
made readi
why then did you not tell me
becaus answer wulf we were not sure that the new wa
true and did not wish to bring fals tide and be made
foolish becaus also my brother and i thought that we could
hold our own awhil against eight of sinan rat disguis as
soldier of saladin
you have done it well though your wa a mad counsel answer
the sultan then he gave hi hand first to on and next to the
other and said simpli
sir knight salaheddin ow hi life to you should it ever
come about that you ow your live to salaheddin he will
rememb thi
thu thi busi end on the morrow those of the fedai who
remain aliv were question and confess freeli that thei
had been sent to murder salaheddin who had rob their master
of hi bride the two frank who had carri her off and the
woman masouda who had guid them thei were put to death cruelli
enough also mani other in the citi were seiz and kill on
suspicion so that for awhil there wa no more fear from the
assassin
now from that dai forward saladin held the brethren in great
friendship and press gift upon them and offer them honour
but thei refus them all sai that thei need but on thing
of him and he knew what it wasan answer at which hi face
sank
on morn he sent for them and except for the presenc of
princ hassan the most favourit of hi emir and a famou
imaum or priest of hi religion receiv them alon
listen he said briefli address godwin i understand that
my niec the princess of baalbec is belov by you good

also she mai be led to the true faith whom i have sworn not to

thu he spoke but godwin onli stare at him with ey set wide
in wonder and answer

sad that superstit should thu blind so brave and good a man
now sir wulf it is your turn what sai you to my offer will
you take the princess and her dominion with my love thrown in as
a marriag portion
wulf thought a moment and as he thought there aros in hi mind
a vision of an autumn afternoon that seem year and year ago
when thei two and rosamund had stood by the shrine of st chad on
the shore of essex and jest of thi veri matter of a chang
of faith then he answer with on of hi great laugh
ay sire but on my own term not on your for if i took these
i think that my marriag would lack bless nor inde would
rosamund wish to wed a servant of your prophet who if it pleas
him might take other wive
saladin leant hi head upon hi hand and look at them with
disappoint ey yet not unkindli
the knight lozel wa a crossworshipp he said but you
two ar veri differ from the knight lozel who accept the
faith when it wa offer to him
to win your trade said godwin bitterli
i know not answer saladin though it is true the man seem
to have been a christian among the frank who here wa a
follow of the prophet at least he is dead at your hand and
though he sin against me and betrai my niec to sinan
peac be with hi soul now i have on more thing to sai to you

brethren do you fight for me or against me or will you give up
your sword and bide here as my prison
we ar the servant of the cross answer godwin and cannot

with wulf and ad as to your second question whether we
should bide here in chain it is on that our ladi rosamund must
answer for we ar sworn to her servic we demand to see the
princess of baalbec
send for her emir said saladin to the princ hassan who
bow and depart
a while later rosamund came look beauti but as thei saw
when she threw back her veil veri white and weari she bow to
saladin and the brethren who were not allow to touch her
hand bow to her devour her face with eager ey
greet my uncl she said to the sultan and to you my
cousin greet also what is your pleasur with me
saladin motion to her to be seat and bade godwin set out the

here rosamund look up wonder and wulf broke in
tell her the price tell her that she wa ask to wed either of
us who would bow the knee to mahomet and to be the head of hi
harem and i think that she will not blame us
never would i have spoken again to him who answer otherwis

jesu and hi saint which shall protect you in the hour of
battl and bring us togeth again
so spoke rosamund and threw her veil befor her face that she
might hide her tear
then godwin and wulf step to where she stood by the throne of
saladin bent the knee befor her and take her hand kiss
it in farewel nor did the sultan sai them nai but when she wa
gone and the brethren were gone he turn to the emir hassan and
to the great imaum who had sat silent all thi while and said
now tell me you who ar old and wise which of those men doe
the ladi love speak hassan you who know her well
but hassan shook hi head on or the other both or neitheri
know not he answer her counsel is too close for me
then saladin turn to the imauma cun silent man
when both the infidel ar about to die befor her face as i
still hope to see them do we mai learn the answer but unless
she will it never befor he repli and the sultan note hi
sai
next morn have been warn that thei would pass there by
masouda rosamund watch through the lattic of on of her
palac window saw the brethren go by thei were fulli arm
and mount on their splendid charger flame and smoke look
gloriou men as follow by their escort of swarthi turban
mameluk thei rode proudli side by side the sunlight glint
on their mail opposit to her hous thei halt awhil and
know that rosamund watch although thei could not see her
drew their sword and lift them in salut then sheath them
again thei rode forward in silenc and soon were lost to
sight
littl did rosamund guess how differ thei would appear when
thei three met again inde she scarc dare to hope that
thei would ever meet for she knew well that even if the war went
in favour of the christian she would be hurri awai to some
place where thei would never find her she knew well also that
from damascu her rescu wa imposs and that although
saladin love them as he love all who were honest and brave he
would receiv them no more as friend for fear lest thei should
rob him of her whom he hope in some wai unforeseen would enabl
him to end hi dai in peac moreov the struggl between
cross and crescent would be fierc and to the death and she wa
sure that where wa the closest fight there in the midst of it
would be found godwin and wulf well might it chanc therefor
that her ey had look their last upon them
oh she wa great gold wa her with gem more than she could
count and few were the week that did not bring her ad wealth
or gift she had palac to dwell inalon garden to wander
inalon eunuch and slave to rule overalon but never a
friend had she save the woman of the assassin to whom she
clung becaus she masouda had save her from sinan and who
clung to her why rosamund could not be sure for there wa a
veil between their spirit
thei were gonethei were gone even the sound of their hors
hoof had di awai and she wa desol as a child lost in a
citi full of folk oh and her heart wa fill with fear for
them and most of all for on of them if he should not come back
into it what would her life be
rosamund bow her head and wept then hear a sound behind
her turn to see that masouda wa weep also
why do you weep she ask
the maid should copi her mistress answer masouda with a hard
laugh but ladi why do you weep at least you ar belov
and come what mai noth can take that from you you ar not
of less valu than the good hors between the rider knee or
the faith hound that run at hi side
a thought rose in rosamund minda new and terribl thought
the ey of the two women met and those of rosamund ask
which anxious as onc in the moonlight she had ask it with
her voic from the gate abov the narrow wai between them stood
a tabl inlaid with ivori and pearl whereon the dust from the
street had gather through the open lattic masouda lean
over and with her forefing wrote a singl arab letter in the
dust upon the tabl then pass her hand across it
rosamund breast heav twice or thrice and wa still then she
ask
why did not you who ar free go with him
becaus he prai me to bide here and watch over the ladi whom
he love so to the deathi watch
slowli masouda spoke and the heavi word seem like blood
drop from a death wound then she sank forward into the arm
of rosamund
chapter eighteen wulf pai for the drug wine
mani a dai had gone by sinc the brethren bade farewel to
rosamund at damascu now on burn juli night thei sat upon
their hors the moonlight gleam on their mail still as
statu thei sat look out from a rocki mountain top across
that grei and arid plain which stretch from near nazareth to
the lip of the hill at whose foot li tiberia on the sea of
galile beneath them camp around the fountain of seffurieh
were spread the host of the frank to which thei did sentinel
thirteen hundr knight twenti thousand foot and hord of
turcopolesthat is nativ of the countri arm after the
fashion of the saracen two mile awai to the southeast
glimmer the white hous of nazareth set in the lap of the
mountain nazareth the holi citi where for thirti year live
and toil the saviour of the world doubtless thought godwin
hi feet had often trod that mountain whereon thei stood and in
the water vale below hi hand had sped the plow or reap the
corn long long had hi voic been silent yet to godwin ear
it still seem to speak in the murmur of the vast camp and to
echo from the slope of the galilean hill and the word it said
were i bring not peac but a sword
tomorrow thei were to advanc so rumour said across yonder
desert plain and give battl to saladin who lai with all hi
power by hattin abov tiberia
godwin and hi brother thought that it wa a mad for thei
had seen the might of the saracen and ridden across that thirsti
plain beneath the summer sun but who were thei two wander
unattend knight that thei should dare to lift up their voic
against those of the lord of the land skill from their birth
in desert warfar yet godwin heart wa troubl and fear took
hold of him not for himself but for all the countless armi that
lai asleep yonder and for the caus of christendom which stake
it last throw upon thi battl
i go to watch yonder bide you here he said to wulf and
turn the head of flame rode some sixti yard over a shoulder
of the rock to the further edg of the mountain which look
toward the north here he could see neither the camp nor wulf
nor ani live thing but inde wa utterli alon dismount
and bid the hors stand which it would do like a dog he
walk forward a few step to where there wa a rock and
kneel down began to prai with all the strength of hi pure
warrior heart
o lord he prai who onc wast man and a dweller in these
mountain and knowest what is in man hear me i am afraid for
all the thousand who sleep round nazareth not for myself who
care noth for my life but for all those thy servant and my
brethren ye and for the cross upon which thou didst hang and
for the faith itself throughout the east oh give me light oh
let me hear and see that i mai warn them unless my fear ar
vain
so he murmur to heaven abov and beat hi hand against hi
brow prai ever prai as he had never prai befor that
wisdom and vision might be given to hi soul
it seem to godwin that a sleep fell on himat least hi mind
grew cloud and confus then it clear again slowli as
stir water clear till it wa bright and still yet anoth
mind to that which wa hi servant dai by dai which never could
see or hear those thing he saw and heard in that strang hour
lo he heard the spirit pass whisper as thei went
whisper and as it seem to him weep also for some great
woe which wa to be weep yonder over nazareth then like
curtain the veil were lift from hi ey and as thei swung
asid he saw further and yet further
he saw the king of the frank in hi tent beneath and about him
the council of hi captain among them the fierceei master of
the templar and a man whom he had seen in jerusalem where thei
had been dwell and knew for count raymond of tripoli the
lord of tiberia thei were reason togeth till present
in a rage the master of the templar drew hi sword and dash
it down upon the tabl
anoth veil wa lift and lo he saw the camp of saladin the
mighti endless camp with it ten thousand tent amongst which
the saracen cri to allah through all the watch of the night
he saw the royal pavilion and in it the sultan walk to and fro
alonenon of hi emir not even hi son were with him he wa
lost in thought and godwin read hi thought
it wa behind me the jordan and the sea of galile into which
if my flank were turn i should be driven i and all my host
in front the territori of the frank where i have no friend
and by nazareth their great armi allah alon can help me if
thei sit still and forc me to advanc across the desert and
attack them befor my armi melt awai then i am lost if thei
advanc upon me round the mountain tabor and by the water land
i mai be lost but ifoh if allah should make them mad and
thei should strike straight across the desertthen then thei
ar lost and the reign of the cross in syria is forev at an
end i will wait here i will wait here
look near to the pavilion of saladin stood anoth tent close
guard and in it on a cushion bed lai two women on wa
rosamund but she slept sound and the other wa masouda and she
wa wake for her ey met hi in the dark
the last veil wa withdrawn and now godwin saw a sight at which
hi soul shiver a fireblacken plain and abov it a
frown mountain and that mountain thick thick with dead
thousand and thousand and thousand of dead among which the
hyena wander and the nightbird scream he could see their
face mani of them he knew again as those of live men whom he
had met in jerusalem and elsewher or had note with the armi
he could hear also the moan of the few who were yet aliv
about that fieldy and in the camp of saladin where lai more
deadhi bodi seem to wander search for someth he knew
not what till it came to him that it wa the corps of wulf for
which he sought and found it notnai nor hi own either then
onc more he heard the spirit passa veri great compani for to
them were gather all those deadheard them pass awai wail
ever more faintli wail for the lost caus of christ wail
over nazareth
godwin awok from hi dream trembl mount hi hors and
rode back to wulf beneath as befor lai the sleep camp
yonder stretch the brown desert and there sat wulf watch
both
tell me ask godwin how long is it sinc i left you
some few minutesten perhap answer hi brother
a short while to have seen so much repli godwin then wulf
look at him curious and ask
what have you seen
if i told you wulf you would not believ
tell me and i will sai
so godwin told him all and at the end ask him what think
you
wulf consid awhil and answer
well brother you have touch no wine todai so you ar not
drunk and you have done noth foolish so you ar not mad
therefor it would seem that the saint have been talk to you
or at least so i should think of ani other man whom i knew to
be as good as you ar yet it is folk like you that see vision
and those vision ar not alwai true for sometim i believ
the devil is their showman our watch is end for i hear the
hors of the knight who come to reliev us listen thi is my
counsel in the camp yonder is our friend with whom we travel
from jerusalem egbert the bishop of nazareth who march with
the host let us go to him and lai thi matter befor him for he
is a holi man and learn no fals selfseek priest
godwin nod in assent and present when the other knight
were come and thei had made their report to them thei rode off
togeth to the tent of egbert and leav their hors in
charg of a servant enter
egbert wa an englishman who had spent more than thirti year of
hi life in the east whereof the sun had tan hi wrinkl

so the three of them came forward and at godwin prayer the
bishop egbert told of the vision that had come to him not more
than an hour ago while he kept watch upon the mountain top at
first on or two of the baron seem dispos to laugh but when
thei look at godwin high and spiritu face their laughter
di awai for it did not seem wonder to them that such a man
should see vision inde as the tale of the rocki hill and the
dead who were stretch upon it went on thei grew white with

knight went to the object and draw the veil reveal a
broken blacken cross set around with jewel that stood
about the height of a man abov the ground for all the

true foreshadow of what will come about should we advanc upon

the bishop drew back the cover over the cross and in silenc
the council took their seat again about the tabl now the king
wa veri pale and fear inde a gloom lai upon all of them
it would seem he said that here a messeng ha been sent to
us from heaven dare we disobei hi messag

but the king held up hi hand and bade him be silent

how do you know that sir godwin
i know it becaus in the vision of which you have been told i
saw her sleep in a tent in the camp of saladin
now the council began to laugh but godwin with a set white
face went on
ay my lord templar and near that veri blazon tent i saw
score of the templar and of the hospital ly dead
rememb it when the dread hour come and you see them also
now the laughter di awai and a murmur of fear ran round the
board mix with such word as wizardri he ha learnt it
from the paynim a black sorcer without doubt

gave him the lie with hi ey
you do not believ me said godwin nor will you believ me
when i sai that while i wa on guard on yonder hilltop i saw you

but godwin onli shrug hi shoulder and said noth and the
master went on take no heed
king we await your word and it must be spoken soon for in
four hour it will be dawn do we march against saladin like

then count raymond of tripoli rose and said

then there aros a tumult through which everi man shout to hi
fellow some sai on thing and some anoth while the king
sat at the head of the board hi face hidden in hi hand
present he lift it and said
i command that we march at dawn if the count raymond and these
brethren think the word unwis let them leav us and remain
here under guard until the issu be known
now follow a great silenc for all there knew that the word
were fate in the midst of which count raymond said
nai i go with you while godwin echo and we go also to
show whether or not we ar the spi of saladin
of these speech none of them seem to take heed for all were
lost in their own thought on by on thei rose bow to the
king and left the tent to give their command and rest awhil
befor it wa time to ride godwin and wulf went also and with
them the bishop of nazareth who wrung hi hand and seem ill
at eas but wulf comfort him sai
griev no more father let us think of the joi of battl not
of the sorrow by which it mai be follow
i find no joi in battl answer the holi egbert
when thei had slept awhil godwin and wulf rose and fed their
hors after thei had wash and groom them thei test and
did on their armour then took them down to the spring to drink
their fill as their master did also wulf who wa cun in
war brought with him four larg wineskin which he had provid
against thi hour and fill them with pure water fasten two
of them with thong behind the saddl of godwin and two behind
hi own further he fill the waterbottl at their
saddlebow sai
at least we will be among the last to die of thirst
then thei went back and watch the host break it camp which it
did with no light heart for mani of them knew of the danger in
which thei stood moreov the tale of godwin vision had been
spread abroad not know where to go thei and egbert the
bishop of nazarethwho wa unarm and rode upon a mule for
stai behind he would notjoin themselv to the great bodi of
knight who follow the king as thei did so the templar five
hundr strong came up a fierc and gallant band and the
master who wa at their head saw the brethren and call out
point to the wineskin which were hung behind their saddl
what do these watercarri here among brave knight who trust
in god alon
wulf would have answer but godwin bade him be silent sai
fall back we will find less illomen compani
so thei stood on on side and bow themselv as the cross went
by guard by the mail bishop of acr then came reginald of
chatillon saladin enemi the caus of all thi woe who saw
them and cri
sir knight whatev thei mai sai i know you for brave men
for i have heard the tale of your do among the assassin
there is room for you among my suitefollow me
as well him as anoth said godwin let us go where we ar
led so thei follow him
by the time that the armi reach kenna where onc the water wa
made wine the juli sun wa alreadi hot and the spring wa so
soon drunk dry that mani men could get no water on thei push
into the desert land below which lai between them and tiberia
and were border on the right and left by hill now cloud of
dust were seen move across the plain and in the heart of them
bodi of saracen horsemen which continu attack the
vanguard under count raymond and as continu retreat befor
thei could be crush slai mani with their spear and arrow
also these came round behind them and charg the rearguard
where march the templar and the lightarm troop name
turcopol and the band of reginald de chatillon with which
rode the brethren
from noon till near sundown the long harass line broken now
into fragment struggl forward across the rough stoni plain
the burn heat beat upon their armour till the air danc
about it as it doe befor a fire toward even men and hors
becam exhaust and the soldier cri to their captain to
lead them to water but in that place there wa no water the
rearguard fell behind worn out with constant attack that must
be repel in the burn heat so that there wa a great gap
between it and the king who march in the centr messag
reach them to push on but thei could not and at length camp
wa pitch in the desert near a place call marescalcia and
upon thi camp raymond and hi vanguard were forc back as
godwin and wulf rode up thei saw him come in bring hi
wound with him and heard him prai the king to push on and at
all hazard to cut hi wai through to the lake where thei might
drinkai and heard the king sai that he could not sinc the
soldier would march no more that dai then raymond wrung hi
hand in despair and rode back to hi men cry aloud
ala ala oh lord god ala we ar dead and thy kingdom is
lost
that night none slept for all were athirst and who can sleep
with a burn throat now also godwin and wulf were no longer
laugh at becaus of the waterskin thei carri on their
hors rather did great nobl come to them and almost on their
knee crave for the boon of a singl cup have water their
hors sparingli from a bowl thei gave what thei could till at
length onli two skin remain and on of these wa spilt by a
thief who crept up and slash it with hi knife that he might
drink while the water ran to wast after thi the brethren drew
their sword and watch swear that thei would kill ani man
who so much as touch the skin which wa left all that long
night through there aros a confus clamour from the camp of
which the burden seem to be water give us water while from
without came the shout of the saracen call upon allah here
too the hot ground wa cover with scrub dri to tinder by the
summer drought and to thi the saracen set fire so that the
smoke roll down on the christian host and choke them and the
place becam a hell
dai dawn at last and the armi wa form up in order of
battl it two wing be thrown forward thu thei struggl
on those of them that were not too weak to stir who were
slaughter as thei lai nor as yet did the saracen attack them
sinc thei knew that the sun wa stronger than all their spear
on thei labour toward the northern well till about middai
the battl began with a flight of arrow so thick that for awhil
it hid the heaven
after thi came charg and countercharg attack and repuls
and alwai abov the nois of war that dread cry for water
what chanc godwin and wulf never knew for the smoke and dust
blind them so that thei could see but a littl wai at length
there wa a last furiou charg and the knight with whom thei
were clove the dens mass of saracen like a serpent of steel
leav a broad trail of dead behind them when thei pull rein
and wipe the sweat from their ey it wa to find themselv
with thousand of other upon the top of a steep hill of which
the side were thick with dry grass and bush that alreadi wa
be fire
the rood the rood ralli round the rood said a voic and
look behind them thei saw the black and jewel fragment of
the true cross set upon a rock and by it the bishop of acr
then the smoke of the burn grass rose up and hid it from their
sight
now began on of the most hideou fight that is told of in the
histori of the world again and again the saracen attack in
thousand and again and again thei were driven back by the
desper valour of the frank who fought on their jaw agap
with thirst a blackbeard man stumbl up to the brethren hi
tongu protrud from hi lip and thei knew him for the master
of the templar
for the love of christ give me to drink he said recogn
them as the knight at whom he had mock as watercarri
thei gave him of the littl thei had left and while thei and
their hors drank the rest themselv saw him rush down the
hill refresh shake hi red sword then came a paus and
thei heard the voic of the bishop of nazareth who had clung to
them all thi while sai as though to himself
and here it wa that the saviour preach the sermon on the
mount ye he preach the word of peac upon thi veri spot
oh it cannot be that he will desert usit cannot be
while the saracen held off the soldier began to put up the
king pavilion and with it other tent around the rock on
which stood the cross
do thei mean to camp here ask wulf bitterli
peac answer godwin thei hope to make a wall about the
rood but it is of no avail for thi is the place of my dream
wulf shrug hi shoulder at least let us die well he
said
then the last attack began up the hillsid rose dens volum of
smoke and with the smoke came the saracen thrice thei were
driven back thrice thei came on at the fourth onset few of the
frank could fight more for thirst had conquer them on thi
waterless hill of hattin thei lai down upon the dry grass with
gape jaw and protrud tongu and let themselv be slain or
taken prison a great compani of saracen horsemen broke
through the ring and rush at the scarlet tent it rock to and
fro then down it fell in a red heap entangl the king in it
fold
at the foot of the cross rufinu the bishop of acr still
fought on brave suddenli an arrow struck him in the throat
and throw hi arm wide he fell to earth then the saracen
hurl themselv upon the rood tore it from it place and with
mockeri and spit bore it down the hill toward their camp
as ant mai be seen carri a littl stick into their nest
while all who were left aliv of the christian armi stare
upward as though thei await some miracl from heaven but no
angel appear in the brazen sky and know that god had
desert them thei groan aloud in their shame and
wretched

seen enough it is time to die look yonder below us ar the
mameluk our old regiment and amongst them saladin for i see
hi banner have had water we and our hors ar still fresh
and strong now let us make an end of which thei will tell in

wulf nod and side by side thei sped down the hill scimitar
flash at them arrow struck upon their mail and the shield
blazon with the deathshead darci crest through it all thei
went unscath and while the armi of the saracen stare at the
foot of the horn of hattin turn their hors head straight
for the royal standard of saladin on thei struggl fell or
ride down a foe at everi stride on still on although flame
and smoke bled from a score of wound
thei were among the mameluk where their line wa thin by
heaven thei were through them and ride straight at the
wellknown figur of the sultan mount on hi white hors with
hi young son and hi emir the princ hassan at hi side

thereupon saladin spoke a word and while certain of hi mameluk
engag godwin in front keep out of reach of that red and
terribl sword other crept up behind and spring on him
seiz hi arm and drag him to the ground where thei bound
him fast
meanwhil wulf had fare otherwis for it wa hi hors smoke

life when we were friend give the frank to drink that the fight

so thei gave wulf a cup of which he drank and when he had done

these brethren who had been their offic and prais the
fierc charg that thei had dare to make alon
hassan sprang to the ground sai

smile
then thei face each other and oh the scene wa strang up on
the slope of hattin the fight still rage there amidst the
smoke and fire of the burn grass littl compani of soldier
stood back to back while the saracen wheel round them
thrust and cut at them till thei fell here and there

other drove or led mob of prison among them the king and
hi chosen knight
the wilder wa red with blood the air wa rent with shout
of victori and cri of agoni or despair and there in the midst
of it all ring round with grave courteou saracen stood the
emir clad abov hi mail in hi white robe and jewel turban
face the great christian knight with har hack and
redden the light of battl shine in hi fierc ey and a
smile upon hi stain featur
for those who watch the battl wa forgottenor rather it
interest wa centr on thi point
it will be a good fight said on of them to godwin whom thei
had suffer to rise for though your brother is the younger and
the heavier man he is hurt and weari wherea the emir is fresh
and unwound ah thei ar at it
hassan had struck first and the blow went home fall upon the
point of wulf steel helm the heavi razoredg scimitar
glanc from it and shore awai the link from the flap which hung
upon hi shoulder caus the frank to stagger again he struck
thi time upon the shield and so heavili that wulf came to hi
knee
your brother is sped said the saracen captain to godwin but
godwin onli answer

as he spoke wulf twist hi bodi out of reach of a third blow
and while hassan stagger forward with the weight of the miss
stroke place hi hand upon the ground and spring to hi
feet ran backward six or eight pace
he fli cri the saracen but again godwin said wait
nor wa there long to wait
for now throw asid hi buckler and grasp the great sword
in both hi hand with a shout of a darci a darci wulf
leapt at hassan as a wound lion leap the sword wheel and
fell and lo the shield of the saracen wa sever in two again
it fell and hi turban helm wa cloven a third time and the
right arm and shoulder with the scimitar that grasp it seem
to spring from hi bodi and hassan sank dy to the ground
wulf stood and look at him while a murmur of grief went up
from those who watch for thei love thi emir hassan beckon
to the victor with hi left hand and throw down hi sword to
show that he fear no treacheri wulf came to him and knelt
besid him
a good stroke hassan said faintli that could shear the
doubl link of damascu steel as though it were silk well as i
told you long ago i knew that the hour of our meet in war
would be an ill hour for me and my debt is paid farewel brave
knight would i could hope that we should meet in paradis take
that star jewel the badg of my hous from my turban and wear

then while wulf held him in hi arm saladin came up and spoke
to him till he fell back and wa dead
thu di hassan and thu end the battl of hattin which
broke the power of the christian in the east
chapter nineteen befor the wall of ascalon
when hassan wa dead at a sign from saladin a captain of the
mameluk name abdullah unfasten the jewel from the emir
turban and hand it to wulf it wa a gloriou starshap
thing made of great emerald set round with diamond and the
captain abdullah who like all eastern love such ornament
look at it greedili and mutter
ala that an unbeliev should wear the enchant star the
ancient luck of the hous of hassan a sai that wulf

none in my armi will rais a blood feud against you on that
score
then dismiss the matter with a wave of hi hand he turn to
receiv a great bodi of christian prison that pant and
stumbl like overdriven sheep were be thrust on toward
the camp with curs blow and mockeri by the victori
saracen
among them the brethren rejoic to see egbert the gentl and
holi bishop of nazareth whom thei had thought dead also

also he ad sadli all the vision is not done and
turn he look toward a blazon tent which with the
sultan great pavilion and not far behind it wa be
pitch by the arab campsett the master saw and rememb
godwin vision of the dead templar

you speak of me as wizard and murder he went on becaus
some angel brought me a vision which had you believ it
templar would have save ten of thousand from a bloodi death

it captor had set up upon a rock not far awai with a dead
knight ti to it black arm you sir templar ar the
murder who by your mad and ambit have brought ruin on
the caus of christ as wa foretold by the count raymond

then saracen guard drag him awai and thei were part
by now the pavilion wa up and saladin enter it sai
bring befor me the king of the frank and princ arnat he who
is call reginald of chatillon
then a thought struck him and he call to godwin and wulf
sai
sir knight you know our tongu give up your sword to the
officerthei shall be return to youand come be my
interpret
so the brethren follow him into the tent where present were
brought the wretch king and the greyhair reginald de
chatillon and with them a few other great knight who even in
the midst of their miseri stare at godwin and wulf in
wonder saladin read the look and explain lest their
presenc should be misunderstood
king and nobl be not mistaken these knight ar my
prison as you ar and none have shown themselv braver
todai or done me and mine more damag inde had it not been
for my guard within the hour i should have fallen beneath the
sword of sir godwin but as thei know arab i have ask them
to render my word into your tongu do you accept them as
interpret if not other must be found
when thei had translat thi the king said that he accept
them ad to godwin
would that i had also accept you two night gone as an
interpret of the will of heaven
the sultan bade hi captain be seat and see their terribl
thirst command slave to bring a great bowl of sherbet made of
rosewat cool with snow and with hi own hand gave it to
king gui he drank in great gulp then pass the bowl to
reginald de chatillon whereon saladin cri out to godwin
sai to the king it is he and not i who give thi man to drink
there is no bond of salt between me and the princ arnat
godwin translat sorrowfulli enough and reginald who knew the
habit of the saracen answer
no need to explain sir knight those word ar my
deathwarr well i never expect less
then saladin spoke again
princ arnat you strove to take the holi citi of mecca and to
desecr the tomb of the prophet and then i swore to kill you
again when in a time of peac a caravan came from egypt and
pass by eshshobek where you were forget your oath you
fell upon them and slew them thei ask for merci in the name of
allah sai that there wa truce between saracen and frank but
you mock them tell them to seek aid from mahomet in whom
thei trust then for the second time i swore to kill you yet i
give you on more chanc will you subscrib the koran and
embrac the faith of islam or will you die
now the lip of reginald turn pale and for a moment he swai
upon hi seat then hi courag came back to him and he answer
in a strong voic
sultan i will have none of your merci at such a price nor do i
bow the knee to your dog of a fals prophet who perish in the
faith of christ and be weari of the world am content to go
to him
saladin sprang to hi feet hi veri beard bristl with wrath
and draw hi sabr shout aloud
you scorn mahomet behold i aveng mahomet upon you take him
awai and he struck him with the flat of hi scimitar
then mameluk leapt upon the princ drag him to the entranc
of the tent thei forc him to hi knee and there behead him
in sight of the soldier and of the other prison
thu brave enough di reginald de chatillon whom the
saracen call princ arnat in the hush that follow thi
terribl deed king gui said to godwin
ask the sultan if it is my turn next
nai answer saladin king do not kill king but that
trucebreak ha met with no more than hi desert
then came a scene still more dread saladin went to the door
of hi tent and stand over the bodi of reginald bade them
parad the captiv templar and hospital befor him thei
were brought to the number of over two hundr for it wa easi
to distinguish them by the red and white cross on their
breast
these also ar faithbreak he shout and of their
unclean tribe will i rid the world ho my emir and doctor of
the law and he turn to the great crowd of hi captain about

now the emir hung back for though fanat thei were brave and
love not thi slaughter of defenceless men and even the
mameluk murmur aloud
but saladin cri again

himself be slain
sultan said godwin we cannot wit such a crime we ask
that we mai die with them
nai he answer you have eaten of my salt and to kill you
would be murder get you to the tent of the princess of baalbec
yonder for there you will see noth of the death of these

so the brethren turn and led by a mameluk fled aghast for the
first time in their live past the long line of templar and
hospital who in the last red light of the dy dai knelt
upon the sand and prai while the emir came up to kill them
thei enter the tent none forbid them and at the end of it
saw two women crouch togeth on some cushion who rose
cling to each other then the women saw also and sprang
forward with a cry of joi sai

master me by hi skill and quick at least we part
friend look he gave me thi and he show her the great
emerald badg which the dy princ had given him
masouda who all thi while had sat veri quiet came forward and
look at it

on of the children of the prophet and to bring good fortun to

then follow by the sound of masouda mock laughter thei

the sultan messeng led them forward across ground strewn
with the bodi of the murder templar and hospital ly
as godwin had seen them in hi dream on the mountain top near
nazareth over on of these corps godwin stumbl in the
gloom so heavili that he fell to hi knee he search the
face in the starlight to find it wa that of a knight of the
hospital of whom he had made a friend at jerusalema veri
good and gentl frenchman who had abandon high station and
larg land to join the order for the love of christ and
chariti such wa hi reward on earthto be struck down in cold

saladin call godwin and wulf to him that thei might interpret

so godwin rose and told them and thei answer not a word who
had lost all hope and courag
afterward he ask whether he and hi brother were also to be
sent to damascu
saladin repli no he would keep them for awhil to
interpret then thei might go their wai without ransom
on the morrow accordingli the captiv were sent to damascu

run great peril tell me now honestli why do you do thi
as he spoke the lightn flash and show her face as she
stood there against a background of green leav and red lili
flower there wa a strang look upon ita look that made
godwin feel afraid he knew not of what
why did i take you into my inn yonder in beirut when you were
the pilgrim peter and john why did i find you the best hors
in syria and guid you to the aljeb why did i often dare
death by torment for you there why did i save the three of you
and why for all thi weari while have iwho after all am
nobli bornbecom the mock of soldier and the tirewoman of the
princess of baalbec

begin becaus i wa the agent of sinan charg to betrai
such knight as you ar into hi hand and afterward becaus my
heart wa fill with piti and love forth ladi rosamund
again the lightn flash and thi time that strang look had
spread from masouda face to the face of godwin
masouda he said in a whisper oh think me no vain fool but
sinc it is best perhap that both should know full sure tell
me is it as i have sometim
fear broke in masouda with her littl mock laugh sir
godwin it is so what doe your faith teachth faith in which

my life and someth came from you to me and ith castoff
playth of sinanlov you love you love youto my own
doom ye and rejoic that it wa so and still rejoic that it

learn that there is a mean in thi life and that there is
an answer to it in live to be otherwher if not here nai
speak not i know your oath nor would i tempt you to it
break but sir godwin a woman such as the ladi rosamund
cannot love two men and as she spoke masouda strove to search
hi face while the shaft went home
but godwin show neither surpris nor pain
so you know what i have known for long he said so long that
my sorrow is lost in the hope of my brother joi moreov it
is well that she should have chosen the better knight
sometim said masouda reflect sometim i have watch
the ladi rosamund and said to myself what do you lack you ar
beauti you ar highborn you ar learn you ar brave and
you ar good then i have answer you lack wisdom and true
sight els you would not have chosen wulf when you might have
taken godwin or perchanc your ey ar blind also

you said godwin in a vex voic
by which you mean whose arm is perhap a littl stronger and
who at a pinch could cut down a few more saracen well it take
more than strength to make a manyou must add spirit
masouda went on godwin take no note of her word although
we mai guess her mind our ladi ha said noth yet also wulf
mai fall and then i fill hi place as best i can i am no free
man masouda
the lovesick ar never free she answer
i have no right to love the woman who love my brother to her
ar due my friendship and my reverenceno more
she ha not declar that she love your brother we mai guess
wrongli in thi matter thei ar your wordsnot mine
and we mai guess rightli what then
then answer masouda there ar mani knightli order or
monasteri for those who desir such placesa you do in your
heart nai talk no more of all these thing that mai or mai not
be back to your tent sir godwin where i will send abdullah to
you to receiv the jewel so farewel farewel
he took her outstretch hand hesit a moment then lift it
to hi lip and went it wa cold as that of a corps and fell
against her side again like the hand of a corps masouda shrank
back among the flower of the garden as though to hide herself
from him and all the world when he had gone a few pace eight
or ten perhap godwin turn and glanc behind him and at that
moment there came a great blaze of lightn in it fierc and
fieri glare he saw masouda stand with outstretch arm pale
upturn face close ey and part lip illumin by the
ghastli sheen of the levin her face look like that of on new
dead and the tall red lili which climb up her dark
palllik robe to her throaty thei look like stream of
freshsh blood
godwin shudder a littl and went hi wai but as she slid
thenc into the black embrac night masouda said to herself
had i plai a littl more upon hi gentl and piti i think
that he would have offer me hi heartaft rosamund had done
with it and in payment for my servic nai not hi heart for
he ha none on earth but hi hand and loyalti and be
honour he would have kept hi promis and i who have
pass through the harem of aljeb might yet have becom the
ladi darci and so live out my life and nurs hi babe nai
sir godwin when you love menot befor and you will never love
meuntil i am dead
snatch a bloom of the lili into her hand the hand that he
had kiss masouda press it convuls against her breast
till the red juic ran from the crush flower and stain her
like a wound then she glide awai and wa lost in the storm and
the dark
chapter twenti the luck of the star of hassan
an hour later the captain abdullah might have been seen walk
carelessli toward the tent where the brethren slept also had
there been ani who care to watch someth els might have been
seen in that low moonlight for now the storm and the heavi rain
which follow it had pass name the fat shape of the eunuch
mesrour slip after him wrap in a dark camelhair cloak
such as wa commonli worn by camp follow and take shelter
cunningli behind everi rock and shrub and rise of the ground
hidden among some picket dromedari he saw abdullah enter the
tent of the brethren then wait till a cloud cross the
moon mesrour ran to it unseen and throw himself down on it
shadow side lai there like a drunken man and listen with
all hi ear but the thick canva wa heavi with wet nor would
the rope and the trench that wa dug around permit him who did
not love to lie in the water to place hi head against it also
those within spoke low and he could onli hear singl word such
as garden the star princess
so import did these seem to him howev that at length
mesrour crept under the cord and although he shudder at it
cold drew hi bodi into the trench of water and with the sharp
point of hi knife cut a littl slit in the taut canva to thi
he set hi ey onli to find that it serv him noth for
there wa no light in the tent still men were there who talk
in the dark
good said a voiceit wa that of on of the brethren but
which he could not tell for even to those who knew them best
thei seem to be the same good then it is settl tomorrow
at the hour arrang you bring the princess to the place agre
upon disguis as you have said in payment for thi servic i
hand you the luck of hassan which you covet take it here it is
and swear to do your part sinc otherwis it will bring no luck
to you for i will kill you the first time we meety and the
other also
i swear it by allah and hi prophet answer abdullah in a
hoars trembl voic
it is enough see that you keep the oath and now awai it is
not safe that you should tarri here
then came the sound of a man leav the tent pass round it
cautious he halt and open hi hand look at it
content to make sure that no trick had been plai upon him in
the dark mesrour screw hi head round to look also and
saw the light gleam faintli on the surfac of the splendid jewel
which he too desir so eagerli in so do hi foot struck a
stone and instantli abdullah glanc down to see a dead or
drunken man ly almost at hi feet with a swift movement he
hid the jewel and start to walk awai then bethink him that
it would be well to make sure that thi fellow wa dead or
sleep he turn and kick the prostrat mesrour upon the
back and with all hi strength inde he did thi thrice
put the eunuch to the greatest agoni
i thought i saw him move abdullah mutter after the third
kick it is best to make sure and he drew hi knife
now had not terror paralys him mesrour would have cri out
but fortun for himself befor he found hi voic abdullah
had buri the knife three inch deep in hi fat thigh with an
effort mesrour bore thi also know that if he show sign of
life the next stroke would be in hi heart then satisfi that
thi fellow whoever he might be wa either a corps or
insens abdullah drew out the knife wipe it on hi victim
robe and depart
not long afterward mesrour depart also toward the sultan
hous bellow with rage and pain and vow vengeanc
it wa not long delai
that veri night abdullah wa seiz and put to the question in
hi suffer he confess that he had been to the tent of the
brethren and receiv from on of them the jewel which wa found
upon him as a bribe to bring the princess to a certain garden
outsid the camp but he name the wrong garden further when
thei ask which of the brethren it wa who bribe him he said
he did not know as their voic were alik and their tent wa
in dark moreov that he believ there wa onli on man in
itat least he heard or saw no other he ad that he wa
summon to the tent by an arab man whom he had never seen
befor but who told him that if he wish for what he most
desir and good fortun he wa to be there at a certain hour
after sunset then he faint and wa put back in prison till
the morn by the command of saladin
when the morn came abdullah wa dead who desir no more
torment with doom at the end of them have made shift to
strangl himself with hi robe but first he had scrawl upon
the wall with a piec of charcoal
mai that accurs star of hassan which tempt me bring better
luck to other and mai hell receiv the soul of mesrour
thu di abdullah as faith as he could be in such sore
strait sinc he had betrai neither masouda nor hi son both
of whom were in the plot and said that onli on of the brethren
wa present in the tent wherea he knew well that the two of
them were there and which of these spoke and gave him the jewel
veri earli that morn the brethren who were ly wake
heard sound without their tent and look out saw that it wa
surround by mameluk
the plot is discov said godwin to wulf quietli but with
despair in hi face now my brother admit noth even under
tortur lest other perish with us

but godwin answer
nai it would serv us noth to kill a few brave men
then an offic enter the tent and command them to give up

had been laid against them both nor would he sai ani more so
thei went as prison and after wait awhil were usher

enough that she knew noth of the plot and had not thought of
thi flight masouda also swore that she now heard of it for the
first time after thi the secretari announc that there wa no
more evid and prai of the sultan to give judgment in the
matter
against which of us ask godwin see that both the dead

now behind saladin stood that old and famou imaum who had been
with him and hassan when he command the brethren to depart from
damascu who all thi while had listen to everyth that
pass with a sour smile lean forward he whisper in hi
master ear who consid a moment then answer him

bridegroom might have worn in a fashion inde he wa happi
whose troubl were done with who had few sin to mourn whose

but he plead in vain for saladin answer onli i have said
a while pass and godwin hear the sweep of robe look
up and saw the tall shape of a veil woman stand in the
corner of the vault where the shadow wa so deep that the
torchlight onli glimmer faintli upon her royal ornament
thei told me that you were sick princess sick with sorrow as

she heard and stretch out her arm and none forbid him
godwin walk to where she stood without lift her veil she
bent forward and kiss him first upon the brow and next upon
the lip then with a low moan cry she turn and fled from
that gloomi place nor did saladin seek to stai her onli to
himself the sultan wonder how it came about that if it wa wulf
whom rosamund love she still kiss godwin thu upon the lip
as he walk back to the deathplac godwin wonder also first
that rosamund should have spoken no singl word and secondli
becaus she had kiss him thu even in that hour why or
wherefor he did not know but there rose in hi mind a memori
of that wild ride down the mountain steep at beirut and of lip
which then had touch hi cheek and of the odour of hair that
then wa blown about hi breast with a sigh he thrust the
thought asid blush to think that such memori should come
to him who had done with earth and it delight knelt down
befor the headsman and turn to the bishop said
bless me father and bid them strike
then it wa that he heard a wellknown footstep and look up to
see wulf stare at him
what do you here godwin ask wulf ha yonder fox snare
both of us and he nod at saladin
let the fox speak said the sultan with a smile know sir
wulf that your brother wa about to die in your place and of
hi own wish but i refus such sacrific who yet have made us
of it to teach my niec the princess that should she continu
in her plot to escap or allow you to continu in them

also knight you ar brave men whom i prefer to kill in war
good hors stand without take them as my gift and ride with
these foolish citizen of jerusalem we mai meet again within it
street nai thank me not i thank you who have taught
salaheddin how perfect a thing can be the love of brother
the brethren stood awhil bewild for it is a strang thing
thu to come back from death to life each of them had made sure
that he must die within some few minut and pass through the
black which wall man in to find he knew not what and now
behold the road that led to that black turn again at it
veri edg and ran forward through the familiar thing of earth
to some end unknown thei were brave both of them and
accustom to face death daili as in such a place and time all
men must be moreov thei had been shriven and look to see
the gate of paradis open on their newborn sight
yet sinc no man love that journei it wa veri sweet to know
it done with for a while and that thei still might hope to dwell
in thi world for mani year littl wonder then that their
brain swam and their ey grew dim as thei pass from the
shadow to the light again it wa wulf who spoke the first
a nobl deed godwin yet on for which i should not have
thank you had it been accomplish who then must have live on
by grace of your sacrific sultan we ar grate for your boon
of life though had you shed thi innoc blood sure it would
have stain your soul mai we bid farewel to our cousin
rosamund befor we ride
nai answer saladin sir godwin ha done that alreadylet
it serv for both tomorrow she shall learn the truth of the
stori now go and return no more
that must be as fate will answer godwin and thei bow and
went
outsid that gloomi place of death their sword were given them
and two good hors which thei mount henc guid led them to
the embassi from jerusalem that wa alreadi in the saddl who
were veri glad to welcom two such knight to their compani
then have bid farewel to the bishop egbert who wept for joi
at their escap escort for a while by saladin soldier thei
rode awai from ascalon at the fall of night
soon thei had told each other all there wa to tell when he
heard of the woe of rosamund wulf wellnigh shed tear
we have our live he said but how shall we save her while
masouda stai with her there wa some hope but now i can see
none
there is none except in god answer godwin who can do all
thingseven free rosamund and make her your wife also if
masouda is at liberti we shall hear from her er long so let us
keep a good heart
but though he spoke thu the soul of godwin wa oppress with a
fear which he could not understand it seem as though some
great terror came veri close to him or to on who wa near and
dear deeper and deeper he sank into that pit of dread of he knew
not what until at length he could have cri aloud and hi brow
wa bath with a sweat of anguish wulf saw hi face in the
moonlight and ask
what ail you godwin have you some secret wound
ye brother he answer a wound in my spirit ill fortun
threaten usgreat ill fortun
that is no new thing said wulf in thi land of blood and
sorrow let us meet it as we have met the rest
ala brother exclaim godwin i fear that rosamund is in
sore dangerrosamund or anoth
then answer wulf turn pale sinc we cannot let us
prai that some angel mai deliv her
ay said godwin and as thei rode through the desert sand
beneath the silent star thei prai to the bless mother and
to their saint st peter and st chadprai with all their
strength yet the prayer avail not sharper and sharper grew
godwin agoni till as the slow hour went by hi veri soul
reel beneath thi spiritu pain and the death which he had
escap seem a thing desir
the dawn wa break and at it first sign the escort of
saladin soldier had turn and left them sai that now thei
were safe in their own countri all night thei had ridden fast
and far the plain wa behind them and their road ran among
hill suddenli it turn and in the flame light of the
newborn dai show them a sight so beauti that for a moment
all that littl compani drew rein to gaze for yonder befor
them though far awai as yet throne upon her hill stood the
holi citi of jerusalem there were her wall and tower and
there stain red as though with the blood of it worshipp
soar the great cross upon the mosqu of omarthat cross which
wa so soon to fall
ye yonder wa the citi for which throughout the ag men had
di by ten and hundr of thousand and still must die until
the doom wa done saladin had offer to spare her citizen if
thei consent to surrend but thei would not thi embassi had
told him that thei had sworn to perish with the holi place and
now look at it in it splendour thei knew that the hour wa
near and groan aloud
godwin groan also but not for jerusalem oh now the last
terror wa upon him black surg round him and in the
black sword and a sound as of a woman voic murmur hi
name clutch the pommel of hi saddl he swai to and fro
till suddenli the anguish pass a strang wind seem to blow
about him and lift hi hair a deep unearthli peac sank into
hi spirit the world seem far awai and heaven veri near
it is over he said to wulf i fear that rosamund is dead
if so we must make hast to follow her answer wulf with a
sob
chapter twentyon what befel godwin
at the villag of bittir some seven mile from jerusalem the
embassi dismount to rest then again thei press forward down
the vallei in the hope of reach the zion gate befor the
middai heat wa upon them at the end of thi vallei swell the
shoulder of a hill whenc the ey could command it length and
on the crest of that shoulder appear suddenli a man and a
woman seat on beauti hors the compani halt fear
lest these might herald some attack and that the woman wa a man
disguis to deceiv them while thei wait thu irresolut the
pair upon the hill turn their hors head and
notwithstand it steep began to gallop toward them veri
swiftli wulf look at them curious and said to godwin
now i am put in mind of a certain ride which onc we took
outsid the wall of beirut almost could i think that yonder
arab wa he who sat behind my saddl and yonder woman she who
rode with you and that those two hors were flame and smoke
reborn note their whirlwind pace and strength and stride
almost as he finish speak the stranger pull up their
steed in front of the compani to whom the man bow hi
salut then godwin saw hi face and knew him at onc as
the old arab call son of the sand who had given them the
hors flame and smoke
sir said the arab to the leader of the embassi i have come
to ask a favour of yonder knight who travel with you which i
think that thei who have ridden my hors will not refus me
thi woman and he point to the closelyveil shape of hi
companion is a rel of mine whom i desir to deliv to
friend in jerusalem but dare not do so myself becaus the
hilldwel between here and there ar hostil to my tribe she
is of the christian faith and no spy but cannot speak your
languag within the south gate she will be met by her rel
i have spoken
let the knight settl it said the command shrug hi
shoulder impati and spur hi hors
sure we will take her said godwin though what we shall do
with her if her friend ar want i do not know come ladi
ride between us
she turn her head to the arab as though in question and he
repeat the word whereon she fell into the place that wa
shown to her between and a littl behind the brethren
perhap went on the arab to godwin by now you have learn
more of our tongu than you knew when we met in past dai at
beirut and rode the mountain side on the good hors flame and
smoke still if so i prai you of your knightli courtesi disturb
not thi woman with your word nor ask her to unveil her face
sinc such is not the custom of her peopl it is but an hour
journei to the citi gate dure which you will be troubl with
her thi is the payment that i ask of you for the two good
hors which as i am told bore you none so ill upon the narrow
wai and across plain and mountain when you fled from sinan also
on the evil dai of hattin when you unhors salaheddin and slew
hassan
it shall be as you wish said godwin and son of the sand we
thank you for those hors
good when you want more let it be known in the market place
that you seek me and he began to turn hi hors head
stai said godwin what do you know of masouda your niec is
she with you
nai answer the arab in a low voic but she bade me be in a
certain garden of which you have heard near ascalon at an
appoint hour to take her awai as she is leav the camp of
salaheddin so thither i go farewel then with a rever
to the veil ladi he shook hi rein and depart like an arrow
by the road along which thei had come
godwin gave a sigh of relief if masouda had appoint to meet
her uncl the arab at least she must be safe so it wa no
voic of her which seem to whisper hi name in the dark of
the night when terror had ahold of himterror born perhap of
all that he had endur and the shadow of death through which he
had so late pass then he look up to find wulf stare
back at the woman behind him and reprov him sai that he
must keep to the spirit of the bargain as well as to the letter
and that if he might not speak he must not look either
that is a piti answer wulf for though she is so ti up
she must be a tall and nobl ladi by the wai she sit her hors
the hors too is nobl own cousin or brother to smoke i
think perhap she will sell it when we get to jerusalem
then thei rode on and becaus thei thought their honour in it
neither spoke nor look more at the companion of thi adventur
though had thei known it she look hard enough at them
at length thei reach the gate of jerusalem which wa crowd
with folk await the return of their ambassador thei all
pass through and the embassi wa escort thenc by the chief
peopl most of the multitud follow them to know if thei
brought peac or war
now godwin and wulf stare at each other wonder whither thei
were to go and where to find the rel of their veil
companion of whom thei saw noth out of the street open an
archwai and beyond thi archwai wa a garden which seem to be
desert thei rode into it to take counsel and their companion
follow but as alwai a littl behind them
jerusalem is reach and we must speak to her now said wulf
if onli to ask her whither she wish to be taken
godwin nod and thei wheel their hors round
ladi he said in arab we have fulfil our charg be
pleas to tell us where ar those kindr to whom we must lead
you
here answer a soft voic
thei stare about the desert garden in which stone and sack
of earth had been store readi for a sieg and find no on
said
we do not see them
then the ladi let slip her cloak though not her veil reveal
the robe beneath
by st peter said godwin i know the broideri on that dress
masouda sai is it you masouda
as he spoke the veil fell also and lo befor them wa a woman
like to masouda and yet not masouda the hair wa dress like
her the ornament and the necklac made of the claw of the
lion which godwin kill were her the skin wa of the same rich
hue there even wa the tini mole upon her cheek but as the head
wa bent thei could not see her ey suddenli with a littl
moan she lift it and look at them
rosamund it is rosamund herself gasp wulf rosamund
disguis as masouda
and he fell rather than leapt from hi saddl and ran to her
murmur god i thank thee
now she seem to faint and slid from her hors into hi arm
and lai there a moment while godwin turn asid hi head
ye said rosamund free herself it is i and no other yet
i rode with you all thi wai and neither of you knew me
have we ey that can pierc veil and woollen garment ask
wulf indignantli but godwin said in a strang strain voic
you ar rosamund disguis as masouda who then wa that woman
to whom i bade farewel befor saladin while the headsman await
me a veil woman who wore the robe and gem of rosamund
i know not godwin she answer unless it were masouda clad
in my garment as i left her nor do i know anyth of thi
stori of the headsman who await you i thoughti thought it
wa for wulf that he waitedoh heaven i thought that
tell us your tale said godwin hoars
it is short she answer after the cast of the lot of
which i shall dream till my deathdai i faint when i found my
sens again i thought that i must be mad for there befor me
stood a woman dress in my garment whose face seem like my
face yet not the same
have no fear she said i am masouda who amongst mani
other thing have learn how to plai a part listen there is
no time to lose i have been order to leav the camp even now
my uncl the arab wait without with two swift hors you
princess will leav in my place look you wear my robe and my
facealmost and ar of my height and the man who guid you
will know no differ i have seen to that for although a
soldier of salaheddin he is of my tribe i will go with you
to the door and there bid you farewel befor the eunuch and
the guard with weep and who will guess that masouda is the
princess of baalbec and that the princess of baalbec is
masouda
and whither shall i go i ask
my uncl son of the sand will give you over to the embassi
which ride to jerusalem or fail that will take you to the
citi or fail that will hide you in the mountain among hi
own peopl see here is a letter that he must read i place it
in your breast
and what of you masouda i ask again
of me oh it is all plan a plan that cannot fail she
answer fear not i escap tonighti have no time to tell
you howand will join you in a dai or two also i think that
you will find sir godwin who will bring you home to england
but wulf what of wulf i ask again he is doom to die
and i will not leav him
the live and the dead can keep no compani she answer
moreov i have seen him and all thi is done by hi most
urgent order if you love him he bid that you will obei
i never saw masouda i never spoke such word i knew noth of
thi plot exclaim wulf and the brethren look at each other
with white face
speak on said godwin afterward we can debat
moreov continu rosamund bow her head masouda ad
these word i think that sir wulf will escap hi doom if you
would see him again obei hi word for unless you obei you can
never hope to look upon him live go now befor we ar both
discov which would mean your death and mine who if you go
am safe
how knew she that i should escap ask wulf
she did not know it she onli said she knew to forc rosamund
awai answer godwin in the same strain voic and then
and thenoh have wulf express command then i went like
on in a dream i rememb littl of it at the door we kiss
and part weep and while the guard bow befor her she
bless me beneath her breath a soldier step forward and
said follow me daughter of sinan and i follow him none
take ani note for at that hour although perhap you did not
see it in your prison a strang shadow pass across the sun of
which all folk were afraid think that it portend evil
either to saladin or ascalon
the eclips which overshadow palestin and caus much
terror at jerusalem on 4th septemb 1187 the dai of the
surrend of ascalon author
in the gloom we came to a place where wa an old arab among
some tree and with him two led hors the soldier spoke to the
arab and i gave him masouda letter which he read then he put
me on on of the led hors and the soldier mount the other
and we depart at a gallop all that even and last night we
rode hard but in the dark the soldier left us and i do not
know whither he went at length we came to that mountain shoulder
and wait there rest the hors and eat food which the
arab had with him till we saw the embassi and among them two
tall knight
see said the old arab yonder come the brethren whom you
seek see and give thank to allah and to masouda who ha not
li to you and to whom i must now return
oh my heart wept as though it would burst and i wept in my
joywept and bless god and masouda but the arab son of the
sand told me that for my life sake i must be silent and keep
myself close veil and disguis even from you until we reach
jerusalem lest perhap if thei knew me the embassi might refus
escort to the princess of baalbec and niec of saladin or even
give me up to him
then i promis and ask what of masouda he said that he
rode back at speed to save her also as had been arrang and
that wa why he did not take me to jerusalem himself but how
that wa to be done he wa not sure as yet onli he wa sure that
she wa hidden awai safe and would find a wai of escap when
she wish it andandy know the rest and here by the
grace of god we three ar togeth again
ay said godwin but where is masouda and what will happen to
her who ha dare to ventur such a plot as thi oh know you
what thi woman did i wa condemn to die in place of
wulfhow doe not matter you will learn it afterwardsand the
princess of baalbec wa brought to sai me farewel there under
the veri ey of saladin masouda plai her part and mimick
you so well that the sultan wa deceiv and i even i wa
deceiv ye when for the first and last time i embrac her i
wa deceiv although it is true i wonder also sinc then a
great fear ha been with me although here again i wa deceiv
for i thought i fearedfor you
now hark you wulf take rosamund and lodg her with some ladi
in thi citi or better still place her in sanctuari with the
nun of the holi cross whenc none will dare to drag her and
let her don their habit the abbess mai rememb you for we have
met her and at least she will not refus rosamund a refug
ye ye i mind me she ask us new of folk in england but
you where do you go godwin said hi brother
i i ride back to ascalon to find masouda
why ask wulf cannot masouda save herself as she told her
uncl the arab she would do and ha he not return thither to
take her awai
i do not know answer godwin but thi i do know that for
the sake of rosamund and perhap for my sake also masouda ha
run a fear risk bethink you what will be the mood of saladin
when at length he find that she upon whom he had built such
hope ha gone leav a wait woman deck out in her
attir
oh broke in rosamund i fear it but i awok to find myself
disguis and she persuad me that all wa well also that thi
wa done by the will of wulf whom she thought would escap
that is the worst of if said godwin to carri out her plan
she held it necessari to lie as i think she li when she said
that she believ we should both escap though it is true that
so it came about i will tell you why she li it wa that she
might give her life to set you free to join me in jerusalem
now rosamund who knew the secret of masouda heart look at
him strang wonder within herself how it came about that
think wulf dead or about to die she should sacrific herself
that she rosamund might be sent to the care of godwin sure
it could not be for love of her although thei love each other
well from love of godwin then how strang a wai to show it
yet now she began to understand so true and high wa thi great
love of masouda that for godwin sake she wa readi to hide
herself in death leav himnow that as she thought hi
rival wa removedto live on with the ladi whom he love ay
and at the price of her own life give that ladi to hi arm
oh how nobl must she be who could thu plan and act and
whatev her past had been how pure and high of soul sure if
she live earth had no grander woman and if she were dead
heaven had won a saint inde
rosamund look at godwin and godwin look at rosamund and
there wa understand in their ey for now both of them saw
the truth in all it glori and all it horror
i think that i should go back also said rosamund
that shall not be answer wulf saladin would kill you for
thi flight as he ha sworn
that cannot be ad godwin shall the sacrific of blood be
offer in vain moreov it is our duti to prevent you
rosamund look at him again and stammer
ififthat dread thing ha happen godwinif the
sacrificeoh what will it serv
rosamund i know not what ha chanc i go to see i care not
what mai chanc i go to meet it through life through death
and if there be need through all the fire of hell i ride on
till i find masouda and kneel to her in homag
and in love exclaim rosamund as though the word broke from
her lip against her will
mayhap godwin answer speak more to himself than to her
then see the look upon hi face the set mouth and the
flash ey neither of them sought to stai him further
farewel my liegeladi and cousin rosamund godwin said my
part is plai now i leav you in the keep of god in heaven
and of wulf on earth should we meet no more my counsel is that
you two wed here in jerusalem and travel back to steepl there
to live in peac if it mai be so brother wulf fare you well
also we part todai for the first time who from our birth have
live togeth and love togeth and done mani a deed togeth
some of which we can look back upon without shame go on your
cours rejoic take the love and glad that heaven ha
given you and live a good and christian knight mind of the
end which draw on apac and of etern beyond
oh godwin speak not thu said wulf for in truth it break
my heart to hear such fate word moreov we do not part
thu easili our ladi here will be safe enough among the
nunsmor safe than i can keep her give me an hour and i will
set her there and join you both of us ow a debt to masouda and
it is not right that it should be paid by you alon
nai answer godwin look upon rosamund and think what is
about to befal thi citi can you leav her at such a time
then wulf drop hi head and trust himself to speak no more
word godwin mount hi hors and without so much as look
back rode into the narrow street and out through the gatewai
till present he wa lost in the distanc and the desert
wulf and rosamund watch him go in silenc for thei were choke
with tear
littl did i look to part with my brother thu said wulf at
length in a thick and angri voic by god wound i had more
gladli di at hi side in battl than leav him to meet hi doom

and leav me to meet my doom alon murmur rosamund then
ad oh i would that i were dead who have live to bring all

you alon ar left to me come let us ceas complain sinc
to dwell upon these grief cannot help us and be thank that
for a while at least we ar free follow me rosamund and we
will ride to thi nunneri to find you shelter if we mai
so thei rode on through the narrow street that were crowd with
scare peopl for now the new wa spread that the embassi had
reject the term of saladin he had offer to give the citi
food and to suffer it inhabit to fortifi the wall and to
hold them till the follow whitsuntid if should no help reach
them thei would swear to surrend then but thei had answer
that while thei had life thei would never abandon the place where
their god had di
so now war wa befor themwar to the end and who were thei
that must bear it brunt their leader were slain or captiv
their king a prison their soldier skeleton on the field of
hattin onli the women and children the sick the old and the
wound remainedperhap eighti thousand soul in allbut few
of whom could bear arm yet these few must defend jerusalem
against the might of the victori saracen littl wonder that
thei wail in the street till the cry of their despair went up
to heaven for in their heart all of them knew that the holi
place wa doom and their live were forfeit
push their path through thi sad multitud who took littl
note of them at length thei came to the nunneri on the sacr
via dolorosa which wulf had seen when godwin and he were in
jerusalem after thei had been dismiss by saladin from damascu
it door stood in the shadow of that arch where the roman pilat
had utter to all gener the word behold the man
here the porter told him that the nun were at prayer in their
chapel wulf repli that he must see the ladi abbess upon a
matter which would not delai and thei were shown into a cool and
lofti room present the door open and through it came the
abbess in her white robesa tall and state englishwoman of
middl ag who look at them curious
ladi abbess said wulf bow low my name is wulf darci do

while she listen amaz when thei had finish she said
ala my daughter how can we save you whose own live ar at
stake that belong to god alon still what we can we will do
gladli and here at least you mai rest for some short while at

counsel that you be enrol upon our book as a novic and don

on the face of wulf the ladi rosamund need not wear it alwai
unless such should be her wish not everi novic proce to the
final vow
long have i been deck in goldembroid silk and priceless
gem answer rosamund and now i seem to desir that white
robe of your more than anyth on earth
so thei led rosamund to the chapel and in sight of all their
order and of priest who had been summon at the altar there
upon that holi spot where thei said that onc christ had answer
pilat thei place her hand and gave her sanctuari and threw
over her tire head the white veil of a novic there too wulf
left her and ride awai report himself to balian of ibelin
the elect command of the citi who wa glad enough to welcom
so stout a knight where knight were few
oh weari weari wa that ride of godwin beneath the sun
beneath the star behind him the brother who had been hi
companion and closest friend and the woman whom he had love in
vain and in front he knew not what what went he forth to seek
anoth woman who had risk her life for them all becaus she
love him and if he found her what then must he wed her and
did he wish thi nai he desir no woman on the earth yet what
wa right that he would do and if he found her not what then
well at least he would give himself up to saladin who must
think ill of them by whom he had dealt well and tell him that of
thi plot thei had no knowledg inde to him he would go
first if it were but to beg forgiv for masouda should she
still be in hi hand thenfor he could not hope to be believ
or pardon a second timethen let death come and he would
welcom it who greatli long for peac
it wa even and godwin tire hors stumbl slowli through
the great camp of the saracen without the wall of fallen
ascalon none hinder him for have been so long a prison he
wa known by mani while other thought that he wa but on of
the surrend christian knight so he came to the great
hous where saladin lodg and bade the guard take hi name to
the sultan sai that he crave audienc of him present he
wa admit and found saladin seat in council among hi
minist
sir godwin he said sternli see how you have dealt by me
what bring you back into my camp i gave you brethren your
live and you have rob me of on whom i would not lose
we did not rob you sire answer godwin who knew noth of
thi plot nevertheless as i wa sure that you would think thu
i am come from jerusalem leav the princess and my brother
there to tell the truth and to surrend myself to you that i
mai bear in her place ani punish which you think fit to
inflict upon the woman masouda
why should you bear it ask saladin
becaus sultan answer godwin sadli and with bent head
whatev she did she did for love of me though without my
knowledg tell me is she still here or ha she fled
she is still here answer saladin shortli would you wish to
see her
godwin breath a sigh of relief at least masouda still live
and the terror that had struck him in the night wa but an evil
dream born of hi own fear and suffer
i do he answer onc if no more i have word to sai to
her
doubtless she will be glad to learn how her plot prosper
said saladin with a grim smile in truth it wa well laid and
boldli execut
call to on of hi council that same old imaum who had
plan the cast of the lot the sultan spoke with him asid
then he said
let thi knight be led to the woman masouda tomorrow we will
judg him
take a silver lamp from the wall the imaum beckon to godwin
who bow to the sultan and follow as he pass wearili
through the throng in the audienc room it seem to godwin that
the emir and captain gather there look at him with piti in
their ey so strong wa thi feel in him that he halt in
hi walk and ask
tell me lord do i go to my death
all of us go thither answer saladin in the silenc but
allah ha not written that death is your tonight
thei pass down long passag thei came to a door which the
imaum who hobbl in front unlock
she is under ward then said godwin
ay wa the answer under ward enter and he hand him the
lamp i remain without
perchanc she sleep and i shall disturb her said godwin as
he hesit upon the threshold
did you not sai she love you then doubtless even if she
sleep she who ha dwelt at masyaf will not take your visit
ill who have ridden so far to find her said the imaum with a
sneer laugh enter i sai
so godwin took the lamp and went in and the door wa shut behind
him sure the place wa familiar to him he knew that arch
roof and these rough stone wall why it wa here that he had
been brought to die and through that veri door the fals
rosamund had come to bid him farewel who now return to greet
her in thi same darksom den well it wa emptydoubtless she
would soon come and he wait look at the door it did not
stir he heard no footstep noth broke that utter silenc he
turn again and stare about him someth glint on the
ground yonder toward the end of the vault just where he had
knelt befor the execution a shape lai there doubtless it wa
masouda imprison and asleep
masouda he said and the sound echo from the arch wall
answer back masouda
he must awaken her there wa no choic ye it wa she asleep
and she still wore the royal robe of rosamund and a clasp of
rosamund still glitter on her breast
how sound masouda slept would she never wake he knelt down
besid her and put out hi hand to lift the long hair that hid
her face
now it touch her and lo the head fell over
then with horror in hi heart godwin held down the lamp and
look oh those robe were red and those lip were ashen it
wa masouda whose spirit had pass him in the desert masouda
slain by the headsman sword thi wa the evil jest that had
been plai upon him and thusthu thei met again
godwin rose to hi feet and stood over her still shape as a man
stand in a dream while word broke from hi lip and a fountain
in hi heart wa unseal
masouda he whisper i know now that i love you and you
onli henceforth and forev o woman with a royal heart wait
for me masouda wherev you mai dwell
while the whisper word left hi lip it seem to godwin that
onc more as when he rode with wulf from ascalon the strang
wind blew about hi brow bring with it the presenc of
masouda and that onc more the unearthli peac sank into hi
soul
then all wa past and over and he turn to see the old imaum
stand at hi side
did i not tell you that you would find her sleep he said
with hi bitter chuckl laugh call on her sir knight call
on her love thei sai can bridg great gulfseven that between
sever neck and bosom
with the silver lamp in hi hand godwin smote and the man went
down like a fell ox leav him onc more in silenc and in
dark
for a moment godwin stood thu till hi brain wa fill with
fire and he too fellfel across the corps of masouda and
there lai still
chapter twentytwo at jerusalem
godwin knew that he lai sick but save that masouda seem to
tend him in hi sick he knew no more for all the past had
gone from him there she wa alwai clad in a white robe and
look at him with ey full of ineff calm and love and he
note that round her neck ran a thin red line and wonder how
it came there
he knew also that he travel while he wa ill for at dawn he
would hear the camp break up with a mighti nois and feel hi
litter lift by slave who bore him along for hour across the
burn sand till at length the even came and with a hum
sound like the sound of hive bee the great armi set it
bivouac then came the night and the pale moon float like a
boat upon the azur sea abov and everywher the bright etern
star to which went up the constant cry of allahu akbar allahu
akbar god is the greatest there is none but he
it is a fals god he would sai tell them to cry upon the
saviour of the world
then the voic of masouda would seem to answer
judg not no god whom men worship with a pure and singl heart
is wholli fals mani be the ladder that lead to heaven judg
not you christian knight
at length that journei wa done and there aros new nois as of
the roar of battl order were given and men march out in
thousand then rose that roar and thei march back again
mourn their dead
at last came a dai when open hi ey godwin turn to rest
them on masouda and lo she wa gone and in her accustom
place there sat a man whom he knew wellegbert onc bishop of
nazareth who gave him to drink of sherbet cool with snow ye
the woman had depart and the priest wa there
where am i he ask
outsid the wall of jerusalem my son a prison in the camp
of saladin wa the answer
and where is masouda who ha sat by me all these dai
in heaven as i trust came the gentl answer for she wa a
brave ladi it is i who have sat by you
nai said godwin obstin it wa masouda
if so answer the bishop again it wa her spirit for i
shrove her and have prai over her open graveh spirit which
came to visit you from heaven and ha gone back to heaven now
that you ar of the earth again
then godwin rememb the truth and groan fell asleep
afterward as he grew stronger egbert told him all the stori
he learn that when he wa found ly senseless on the bodi of
masouda the emir wish saladin to kill him if for no other
reason becaus he had dash out the ey of the holi imaum with a
lamp but the sultan who had discov the truth would not
for he said that it wa unworthi of the imaum to have mock hi
grief and that sir godwin had dealt with him as he deserv
also that thi frank wa on of the bravest of knight who had
return to bear the punish of a sin which he did not commit
and that although he wa a christian he love him as a friend
so the imaum lost both hi ey and hi vengeanc
thu it had come about that the bishop egbert wa order to
nurs him and if possibl to save hi life and when at last
thei march upon jerusalem soldier were told off to bear hi
litter and a good tent wa set apart to cover him now the sieg
of the holi citi had begun and there wa much slaughter on both
side
will it fall ask godwin
i fear so unless the saint help them answer egbert ala
i fear so
will not saladin be merci he ask again
why should he be merci my son sinc thei have refus hi
term and defi him nai he ha sworn that as godfrei took the
place nigh upon a hundr year ago and slaughter the mussulmen
who dwelt there by thousand men women and children togeth
so will he do to the christian oh why should he spare them
thei must die thei must die and wring hi hand egbert left
the tent
godwin lai still wonder what the answer to thi riddl might
be he could think of on and on onli in jerusalem wa
rosamund the sultan niec whom he must desir to recaptur
abov all thing not onli becaus she wa of hi blood but
sinc he fear that if he did not do so hi vision concern
her would come to noth
now what wa thi vision that through rosamund much slaughter
should be spare well if jerusalem were save would not ten
of thousand of moslem and christian live be save also oh
sure here wa the answer and some angel had put it into hi
heart and now he prai for strength to plant it in the heart of
saladin for strength and opportun
thi veri dai godwin found the opportun as he lai doze in
hi tent that even be still too weak to rise a shadow
fell upon him and open hi ey he saw the sultan himself
stand alon by hi bedsid now he strove to rise to salut
him but in a kind voic saladin bade him lie still and seat
himself began to talk
sir godwin he said i am come to ask your pardon when i
sent you to visit that dead woman who had suffer justli for
her crime i did an act unworthi of a king but my heart wa
bitter against her and you and the imaum he whom you smote put
into my mind the trick that cost him hi ey and almost cost a
wornout and sorrow man hi life i have spoken
i thank you sire who were alwai nobl answer godwin
you sai so yet i have done thing to you and your that you can
scarc hold as nobl said saladin i stole your cousin from
her home as her mother had been stolen from mine pai back
ill with ill which is against the law and in hi own hall my
servant slew her father and your uncl who wa onc my friend
well these thing i did becaus a fate drove me onth fate of
a dream the fate of a dream sai sir godwin is that stori
which thei tell in the camp true that a vision came to you
befor the battl of hattin and that you warn the leader of
the frank not to advanc against me
ye it is true answer godwin and he told the vision and
of how he had sworn to it on the rood
and what did thei sai to you
thei laugh at me and hint that i wa a sorcer or a
traitor in your pai or both
blind fool who would not hear the truth when it wa sent to
them by the pure mouth of a prophet mutter saladin well
thei paid the price and i and my faith ar the gainer do you
wonder then sir godwin that i also believ my vision which
came to me thrice in the night season bring with it the
pictur of the veri face of my niec the princess of baalbec
i do not wonder answer godwin
do you wonder also that i wa mad with rage when i learn that
at last yonder brave dead woman had outwit me and all my spi
and guard and thi after i had spare your live do you wonder
that i am still so wroth believ as i do that a great occas
ha been taken from me
i do not wonder but sultan i who have seen a vision speak to
you who also have seen a visiona prophet to a prophet and i
tell you that the occas ha not been takenit ha been
brought ye to your veri door and that all these thing have
happen that it might thu be brought
sai on said saladin gaze at him earnestli
see now salaheddin the princess rosamund is in jerusalem she
ha been led to jerusalem that you mai spare it for her sake and
thu make an end of bloodsh and save the live of folk
uncount
never said the sultan spring up thei have reject my
merci and i have sworn to sweep them awai man woman and
child and be aveng upon all their unclean and faithless race
is rosamund unclean that you would be aveng upon her will her
dead bodi bring you peac if jerusalem is put to the sword she
must perish also
i will give order that she is to be savedthat she mai be
judg for her crime by me he ad grimli
how can she be save when the stormer ar drunk with slaughter
and she but on disguis woman among ten thousand other
then he answer stamp hi foot she shall be brought or
drag out of jerusalem befor the slaughter begin
that i think will not happen while wulf is there to protect
her said godwin quietli
yet i sai that it must be soit shall be so
then without more word saladin left the tent with a troubl
brow
within jerusalem all wa miseri all wa despair there were
crowd thousand and ten of thousand of fugit women and
children mani of them whose husband and father had been slain
at hattin or elsewher the fight men who were left had few
command and thu it came about that soon wulf found himself
the captain of veri mani of them
first saladin attack from the west between the gate of st
stephen and of david but here stood strong fortress call the
castl of the pisan and the tower of tancr whenc the
defend made salli upon him drive back hi stormer so he
determin to chang hi ground and move hi armi to the east
camp it near the vallei of the kedron when thei saw the tent
be struck the christian thought that he wa abandon the
sieg and gave thank to god in all their church but lo next
morn the white arrai of these appear again on the east and
thei knew that their doom wa seal
there were in the citi mani who desir to surrend to the
sultan and fierc grew the debat between them and those who
swore that thei would rather die at length it wa agre that an
embassi should be sent so it came under safe conduct and wa
receiv by saladin in presenc of hi emir and counsellor he
ask them what wa their wish and thei repli that thei had
come to discuss term then he answer thu
in jerusalem is a certain ladi my niec known among us as the
princess of baalbec and among the christian as rosamund darci
who escap thither a while ago in the compani of the knight sir
wulf darci whom i have seen fight brave among your
warrior let her be surrend to me that i mai deal with her
as she deserv and we will talk again till then i have no more
to sai
now most of the embassi knew noth of thi ladi but on or two
said thei thought that thei had heard of her but had no
knowledg of where she wa hidden
then return and search her out said saladin and so dismiss
them
back came the envoi to the council and told what saladin had
said
at least exclaim heracliu the patriarch in thi matter it
is easi to satisfi the sultan let hi niec be found and
deliv to him where is she
now on declar that wa known by the knight sir wulf darci
with whom she had enter the citi so he wa sent for and came
with armour rent and red sword in hand for he had just beaten
back an attack upon the barbican and ask what wa their
pleasur
we desir to know sir wulf said the patriarch where you have
hidden awai the ladi known as the princess of baalbec whom you
stole from the sultan
what is that to your holi ask wulf shortli
a great deal to me and to all see that saladin will not
even treat with us until she is deliv to him
doe thi council then propos to hand over a christian ladi
to the saracen against her will ask wulf sternli
we must answer heracliu moreov she belong to them
she doe not belong answer wulf she wa kidnap by
saladin in england and ever sinc ha striven to escap from
him
wast not our time exclaim the patriarch impati we
understand that you ar thi woman lover but howev that mai
be saladin demand her and to saladin she must go so tell us
where she is without more ado sir wulf
discov that for yourself sir patriarch repli wulf in
furi or if you cannot send on of your own women in her
place
now there wa a murmur in the council but of wonder at hi
bold rather than of indign for thi patriarch wa a
veri evil liver
i care not if i speak the truth went on wulf for it is known
to all moreov i tell thi man that it is well for him that he
is a priest howev shame for otherwis i would cleav hi
head in two who ha dare to call the ladi rosamund my lover
then still shake with wrath the great knight turn and
stalk from the council chamber
a danger man said heracliu who wa white to the lip a
veri danger man i propos that he should be imprison
ay answer the lord balian of ibelin who wa in suprem
command of the citi a veri danger manto hi foe as i can
testifi i saw him and hi brother charg through the host of
the saracen at the battl of hattin and i have seen him in the
breach upon the wall would that we had more such danger men
just now
but he ha insult me shout the patriarch me and my holi
offic
the truth should be no insult answer balian with mean
at least it is a privat matter between you and him on account
of which we cannot spare on of our few captain now as regard
thi ladi i like not the busi
as he spoke a messeng enter the room and said that the
hidingplac of rosamund had been discov she had been
admit a novic into the commun of the virgin of the holi
cross who had their hous by the arch on the via dolorosa
now i like it still less balian went on for to touch her
would be sacrileg
hi holi heracliu will give us absolut said a
mock voic
then anoth leader roseh wa on of the parti who desir
peaceand point out that thi wa no time to stand on
scrupl for the sultan would not listen to them in their sore
plight unless the ladi were deliv to him to be judg for her
offenc perhap be hi own niec she would in fact suffer
no harm at hi hand and whether thi were so or not it wa
better that on should endur wrong or even death than mani
with such word he overpersuad the most of them so that in
the end thei rose and went to the convent of the holi cross
where the patriarch demand admiss for them which inde
could not be refus the state abbess receiv them in the
refectori and ask their pleasur
daughter said the patriarch you have in your keep a ladi
name rosamund darci with whom we desir to speak where is
she
the novic rosamund answer the abbess prai by the holi
altar in the chapel
now on murmur she ha taken sanctuari but the patriarch
said
tell us daughter doe she prai alon
a knight guard her prayer wa the answer
ah as i thought he ha been beforehand with us also
daughter sure your disciplin is somewhat lax if you suffer
knight thu to invad your chapel but lead us thither
the danger of the time and of the ladi must answer for it
the abbess repli boldli as she obei
present thei were in the great dim place where the lamp
burn dai and night there by the altar built it wa said
upon the spot where the lord stood to receiv judgment thei saw
a kneel woman who clad in the robe of a novic grasp the
stonework with her hand without the rail also kneel wa
the knight wulf still as a statu on a sepulchr hear them
he rose turn him about and drew hi great sword
sheath that sword command heracliu
when i becam a knight answer wulf i swore to defend the
innoc from harm and the altar of god from sacrileg at the
hand of wick men therefor i sheath not my sword
take no heed of him said on and heracliu stand back in
the aisl address rosamund
daughter he cri with bitter grief we ar come to ask of
you a sacrific that you should give yourself for the peopl as
our master gave himself for the peopl saladin demand you as a
fugit of hi blood and until you ar deliv to him he will
not treat with us for the save of the citi come forth then
we prai you
now rosamund rose and face them with her hand rest upon the
altar
i risk my life and i believ anoth gave her life she said
that i might escap from the power of the moslem i will not
come forth to return to them
then our need be sore we must take you answer heracliu
sullenli
what she cri you the patriarch of thi sacr citi would
tear me from the sanctuari of it holiest altar oh then inde
shall the curs fall upon it and you henc thei sai our sweet
lord wa hale to sacrific by the command of an unjust judg
and thereaft jerusalem wa taken by the sword must i too be
drag from the spot that hi feet have hallow and even in
these weedsand she point to her white robethrown as an
offer to your foe who mayhap will bid me choos between
death and the koran if so i sai assuredli that offer will be
made in vain and assuredli your street shall run red with the
blood of those who tore me from my sanctuari
now thei consult togeth some take on side and some the
other but the most of them declar that she must be given up to
saladin
come of your own will i prai you said the patriarch sinc
we would not take you by forc
by forc onli will you take me answer rosamund
then the abbess spoke
sir will you commit so great a crime then i tell you that it
cannot go without it punish with thi ladi i sayand she
drew up her tall shapethat it shall be paid for in your blood
and mayhap in the blood of all of us rememb my word when the
saracen have won the citi and ar put it children to the
sword
i absolv you from the sin shout the patriarch if sin it
is
absolv yourself broke in wulf sternli and know thi i am
but on man but i have some strength and skill if you seek but
to lai a hand upon the novic rosamund to hale her awai to be
slain by saladin as he ha sworn that he would do should she
dare to fly from him befor i die there ar those among you who
have look the last upon the light
then stand there befor the altar rail he lift hi great
blade and settl the skullblazon shield upon hi arm
now the patriarch rave and storm and on among them cri
that thei would fetch bow and shoot wulf down from a distanc
and thu broke in rosamund add murder to sacrileg oh
sir bethink what you doai and rememb thi that you do it
all in vain saladin ha promis you noth except that if you
deliv me to him he will talk with you and then you mai find
that you have sin for noth have piti on me and go your
wai leav the issu in the hand of god
that is true cri some saladin made no promis
now balian the guardian of the citi who had follow them to
the chapel and stand in the background heard what pass
there step forward and said
my lord patriarch i prai you let thi thing be sinc from such
a crime no good could come to us or ani that altar is the
holiest and most note place of sanctuari in all jerusalem will
you dare to tear a maiden from it whose onli sin is that she a
christian ha escap the saracen by whom she wa stolen do
you dare to give her back to them and death for such will be her
doom at the hand of saladin sure that would be the act of
coward and bring upon us the fate of coward sir wulf put up
your sword and fear noth if there is ani safeti in jerusalem
your ladi is safe abbess lead her to her cell
nai answer the abbess with fine sarcasm it is not fit
that we should leav thi place befor hi holi
then you have not long to wait shout the patriarch in furi
is thi a time for scrupl about altar is thi a time to
listen to the prayer of a girl or to threat of a singl knight
or the doubt of a superstiti captain well take your wai and
let your live pai it cost yet i sai that if saladin ask for
half the nobl maiden in the citi it would be cheap to let him
have them in payment for the blood of eighti thousand folk and
he stalk toward the door
so thei went awai all except wulf who stai to make sure that
thei were gone and the abbess who came to rosamund and embrac
her sai that for the while the danger wa past and she might
rest quiet
ye mother answer rosamund with a sob but oh have i done
right should i not have surrend myself to the wrath of
saladin if the live of so mani hang upon it perhap after all
he would forget hi oath and spare my life though at best i
should never be suffer to escap again while there is a castl
in baalbec or a guard harem in damascu moreov it is hard
to bid farewel to all on love forev and she glanc
toward wulf who stood out of hear
ye answer the abbess it is hard as we nun know well
but daughter that sore choic ha not yet been thrust upon you
when saladin sai that he set you against the live of all thi
city then you must judg
ay repeat rosamund then imust judg
the sieg went on from terror to terror it went on the
mangonel hurl their stone unceasingli the arrow flew in
cloud so that none could stand upon the wall thousand of the
cavalri of saladin hover round st stephen gate while the
engin pour fire and bolt upon the doom town and the
saracen miner work their wai beneath the barbican and the
wall the soldier within could not salli becaus of the
multitud of the watch horsemen thei could not show

thousand dart and thei could not build up the breach of the
crumbl wall as dai wa ad to dai the despair grew ever
deeper in everi street might be met long process of monk

then saladin sat still and thought a while hi head bow upon
hi breast
chapter twentythre saint rosamund
from the dai when he saw saladin godwin began to grow strong
again and as hi health came back so he fell to think
rosamund wa lost to him and masouda wa dead and at time he
wish that he were dead also what more had he to do with hi
life which had been so full of sorrow struggl and bloodsh
go back to england to live there upon hi land and wait until
old ag and death overtook him the prospect would have pleas
mani but it did not pleas godwin who felt that hi dai were
not given to him for thi purpos and that while he live he
must also labour
as he sat think thu and wa veri unhappi the ag bishop
egbert who had nurs him so well enter hi tent and note
hi face ask
what ail you my son
would you wish to hear said godwin
am i not your confessor with a right to hear answer the
gentl old man show me your troubl
so godwin began at the begin and told it allhow as a lad he
had secretli desir to enter the church how the old prior of
the abbei at stangat counsel him that he wa too young to
judg how then the love of rosamund had enter into hi life
with hi manhood and he had thought no more of religion he told
him also of the dream that he had dream when he lai wound
after the fight on death creek of the vow which he and wulf had
vow at the time of their knight and of how by degre he
had learn that rosamund love wa not for him lastli he told
him of masouda but of her egbert who had shriven her knew
alreadi
the bishop listen in silenc till he had finish then he
look up sai
and now
now answer godwin i know not yet it seem to me that i
hear the sound of my own feet walk upon cloister stone and
of my own voic lift up in prayer befor the altar
you ar still young to talk thu and though rosamund be lost to
you and masouda dead there ar other women in the world said
egbert
godwin shook hi head
not for me my father
then there ar the knightli order in which you might rise
high
again he shook hi head
the templar and the hospital ar crush moreov i
watch them in jerusalem and the field and love them not
should thei chang their wai or should i be need to fight
against the infidel i can join them by dispens in dai to
come but counsel mewhat shall i do now
oh my son the old bishop said hi face light up if god
call you come to god i will show you the road
ye i will come godwin answer quietli i will come and
unless the cross should onc more call me to follow it in war i
will strive to spend the time that is left to me in hi servic
and that of men for i think my father that to thi end i wa
born
three dai later godwin wa ordain a priest there in the camp
of saladin by the hand of the bishop egbert while around hi
tent the servant of mahomet triumphant at the approach
downfal of the cross shout that god is great and mahomet hi
onli prophet
saladin lift hi head and look at balian
tell me he said what of the princess of baalbec whom you
know as the ladi rosamund darci i told you that i would speak
no more with you of the safeti of jerusalem until she wa
deliv to me for judgment yet i see her not
sultan answer balian we found thi ladi in the convent of
the holi cross wear the robe of a novic of that order she
had taken the sanctuari there by the altar which we deem so
sacr and inviol and refus to come
saladin laugh
cannot all your menatarm drag on maiden from an altar
stoneunless inde the great knight wulf stood befor it
with sword aloft he ad
so he stood answer balian but it wa not of him that we
thought though assuredli he would have slain some of us to do
thi thing would have been an aw crime which we were sure
must bring down the vengeanc of our god upon us and upon the
citi
what of the vengeanc of salaheddin
sore as is our case sultan we still fear god more than
saladin
ay sir balian but salaheddin mai be a sword in the hand of
god
which sword sultan would have fallen swiftli had we done thi
deed
i think that it is about to fall said saladin and again wa
silent and stroke hi beard
listen now he said at length let the princess my niec
come to me and ask it of my grace and i think that i will grant
you term for which in your plight you mai be thank
then we must dare the great sin and take her answer balian
sadli have first slain the knight wulf who will not let her
go while he is aliv
nai sir balian for that i should be sorri nor will i suffer
it for though a christian he is a man after my own heart thi
time i said let her come to me not let her be brought ay
come of her own free will to answer to me for her sin against
me understand that i promis her noth who in the old dai
promis her much and kept my word then she wa the princess of
baalbec with all the right belong to that great rank to
whom i had sworn that no husband should be forc upon her nor
ani chang of faith now i take back these oath and if she
come she come as an escap crossworship slave to whom i
offer onli the choic of islam or of a shame death
what highborn ladi would take such term ask balian in
dismai rather i think would she choos to die by her own hand
than by that of your hangman sinc she can never abjur her
faith
and therebi doom eighti thousand of her fellow christian who
must accompani her to that death answer saladin sternli
know sir balian i swear it befor allah and for the last time
that if my niec rosamund doe not come of her own free will
unforc by ani jerusalem shall be put to sack
then the fate of the holi citi and all it inhabit hang
upon the nobl of a singl woman stammer balian
ay upon the nobl of a singl woman as my vision told me
it should be if her spirit is high enough jerusalem mai yet be
save if it be baser than i thought as well mai chanc then
assuredli with her it is doom i have no more to sai but my
envoi shall ride with you bear a letter which with their own
hand thei must present to my niec the princess of baalbec
then she can return with them to me or she can bide where she
is when i shall know that i saw but a ly vision of peac and
merci flow from her hand and will press on thi war to it
bloodi end
within an hour balian rode to the citi under safe conduct take
with him the envoi of saladin and the letter which thei were
charg to deliv to rosamund
it wa night and in their lamplit chapel the virgin of the
holi cross upon bend knee chant the slow and solemn
miserer from their heart thei sang to whom death and
dishonour were so near prai their lord and the merci
mother of god to have piti and to spare them and the
inhabit of the hallow town where he had dwelt and suffer
and to lead them safe through the shadow of a fate as aw as
hi own thei knew that the end wa near that the wall were
totter to their fall that the defend were exhaust and
that soon the wild soldier of saladin would be surg through
the narrow street
then would come the sack and the slaughter either by the sword
of the saracen or perchanc if these found time and thei were
not forgotten more mercifulli at the hand of christian men who
thu would save them from the worst
their dirg end the abbess rose and address them her
bear wa still proud but her voic quaver
my daughter in the lord she said the doom is almost at our
door and we must brace our heart to meet it if the command
of the citi do what thei have promis thei will send some here
to behead us at the last and so we shall pass happili to glori
and be ever with the lord but perchanc thei will forget us who
ar but a few among eighti thousand soul of whom some fifti
thousand must thu be kill or their arm mai grow weari or
themselv thei mai fall befor ever thei reach thi houseand
what my daughter shall we do then
now some of the nun clung togeth and sob in their affright
and some were silent onli rosamund drew herself to her full
height and spoke proudli
my mother she said i am a newcom among you but i have
seen the slaughter of hattin and i know what befal christian
women and children among the unbeliev therefor i ask your
leav to sai my sai
speak said the abbess
thi is my counsel went on rosamund and it is short and
plain when we know that the saracen ar in the citi let us set
fire to thi convent and get us to our knee and so perish
well spoken it is best mutter sever but the abbess
answer with a sad smile
high counsel inde such as might be look for from high
blood yet it mai not be taken sinc selfslaught is a deadli
sin
i see littl differ between it said rosamund and the
stretch out of our neck to the sword of friend yet
although for other i cannot judg for myself i do judg who am
bound by no final vow i tell you that rather than fall into the
hand of the paynim i will dare that sin and leav them noth
but the vile mould which onc held the spirit of a woman
and she laid her hand upon the dagger hilt that wa hidden in her
robe
then again the abbess spoke
to you daughter i cannot forbid the deed but to those who
have fulli sworn to obei me i do forbid it and to them i show
anoth if a more piteou wai of escap from the last shame of
womanhood some of us ar old and wither and have naught to
fear but death but other ar still young and fair to these i
sai when the end is nigh let them take steel and score face and
bosom and seat themselv here in thi chapel red with their own
blood and made loathsom to the sight of man then will the end
come upon them quickli and thei will pass henc unstain to be
the bride of heaven
now a great groan of horror went up from those miser women
who alreadi saw themselv seat in stain robe and hideou
to behold there in the carv chair of their choir await
death by the sword of furiou and savag men as in a dai to
come their sister of the faith were to await it in the doom
convent of the virgin of st clare at acr
those who ar curiou to know the stori of the end of those
holi heroin the virgin of st clare i think in the year
1291 mai read it in my book a winter pilgrimag pp 270 and
271author
yet on by on except the ag among them thei came up to the
abbess and swore that thei would obei her in thi as in
everyth while the abbess said that herself she would lead
them down that dread road of pain and mutil ye save
rosamund who declar that she would die undisfigur as god had
made her and two other novic thei swore it on by on lai
their hand upon the altar
then again thei got them to their knee and sang the miserer
present abov their mourn chant the sound of loud
insist knock echo down the vault roof thei sprang up
scream
the saracen ar here give us knive give us knive
rosamund drew the dagger from it sheath
wait awhil cri the abbess these mai be friend not foe

the sister an ag woman obei with totter step and
reach the massiv portal undid the guichet or lattic and
ask with a quaver voic

strang still and small in the space of that tomblik
church

and what would you with us o queen the right of sanctuari

let her not fear went on the silveri voic for no harm shall

then the abbess said let us receiv the queen with such digniti
as we mai motion to the nun to take their appoint seat
in the choir she place herself in the great chair at the head of
them whilst behind her at the rais altar stood rosamund the
bare knife in her hand

the bishop in hi visit but she would have none of it
nai said the queen mock me with no honour seat who come

by the sound of the weep of the multitud toward the camp of
saladin two strang and lonesom figur in the moonlight
at last these lament could be heard no more and there on
the outskirt of the moslem line an escort met them and
bearer with a litter
but into thi rosamund would not enter so thei walk onward up
the hill till thei came to the great squar in the centr of the
camp upon the mount of oliv beyond the grei tree of the
garden of gethseman there await them at the head of the
squar sat saladin in state while all about rank upon rank in
thousand and ten of thousand wa gather hi vast armi who

chapter twenti four the dreg of the cup
saladin look at them but gave them no greet then he
spoke

sultan said wulf i counsel the ladi rosamund that she
should comenot that she need such counseland have given
it i accompani her by right of blood and of justic sinc her
offenc against you is mine also her fate is my fate
i have no quarrel against you whom i forgav therefor you must
take your own wai to follow the path she goe
doubtless answer wulf be a christian among mani son of
the prophet it will not be hard to find a friendli scimitar to
help me on that road i ask of your good that her fate mai be
my fate
what said saladin you ar readi to die with her although

i grant the boon your fate shall be her fate wulf darci you
shall drink of the cup of my slave rosamund to it last
bitterest dreg
i desir no less said wulf coolli
now saladin look at rosamund and ask
woman why have you come here to brave my vengeanc speak on if
you have aught to ask
then rosamund rose from her knee and stand befor him
said
i am come o my mighti lord to plead for the peopl of
jerusalem becaus it wa told me that you would listen to no
other voic than that of thi your slave see mani moon ago
you had a vision concern me thrice you dream in the night
that i the niec whom you had never seen by some act of mine

therefor you tore me from my home and brought my father to a
bloodi death as you ar about to bring hi daughter and after
much suffer and danger i fell into your power and wa treat
with great honour still i who am a christian and who grew
sick with the sight of the daili slaughter and outrag of my kin
strove to escap from you although you had warn me that the
price of thi crime wa death and in the end through the wit
and sacrific of anoth woman i did escap
now i return to pai that price and behold your vision is
fulfilledor at the least you can fulfil it if god should
touch your heart with grace see that of my own will i am come
to prai you salaheddin to spare the citi and for it blood
to accept mine as a token and an offer
oh my lord as you ar great be merci what will it avail
you in the dai of your own judgment that you have ad anoth
eighti thousand to the talli of your slain and with them mani
more thousand of your own folk sinc the warrior of jerusalem
will not die unaveng give them their live and let them go
free and win therebi the gratitud of mankind and the
forgiv of god abov
so rosamund spoke and stretch out her arm toward him wa
silent

saladin why should i grant them now that thei ar conquer
my lord strongtoaid said rosamund do you who ar so
brave blame yonder knight and soldier becaus thei fought on

no blow to save it oh i am outworn i can sai no more but onc

of merci and let not your triumph be dy red with the blood of
women and of littl children
then cast herself upon her face rosamund clasp the hem of
hi royal robe with her hand and press it to her forehead
so for a while she lai there in the shimmer moonlight while
utter silenc fell upon all that vast multitud of arm men as
thei wait for the decre of fate to be utter by the
conqueror lip but saladin sat still as a statu gaze at
the dome and tower of jerusalem outlin against the deep blue
sky
rise he said at length and know niec that you have plai
your part in a fashion worthi of my race and that i
salaheddin am proud of you know also that i will weigh your

and point upward to the sky
then a murmur rose from the multitud and the sound of it seem
to shape itself into on word merci
still saladin made no sign and thei were led awai to their
prison
among the thousand who watch thi strang and most thrill
scene were two men wrap in long cloak godwin and the bishop
egbert thrice did godwin strive to approach the throne but it
seem that the soldier about him had their command for thei

stop and look around her but saw no on for the guard
hem her in so she went on wonder if perchanc it wa
godwin voic which she had heard or whether an angel or onli
some frankish prison had spoken
godwin stood wring hi hand while the bishop strove to
comfort him sai that he should not griev sinc such death

the term of saladin had been accept with rejoic becaus
their live were spare but with woe and lament becaus the
holi citi had fallen again into the hand of the moslem the
peopl of jerusalem made readi to leav the street and seek new
home elsewher the great golden cross wa torn from the mosqu
elaksa and on everi tower and wall float the yellow banner
of saladin all who had monei paid their ransom and those who
had none beg and borrow it as thei could and if thei could
not gave themselv over to despair and slaveri onli the
patriarch heracliu forget the miseri of these wretch
on carri off hi own great wealth and the gold plate of the
church
then saladin show hi merci for he freed all the ag without
charg and from hi own treasur paid the ransom of hundr of
ladi whose husband and father had fallen in battl or lai in
prison in other citi
so for forti dai head by queen sybilla and her ladi that
sad process of the vanquish march through the gate and
there were mani of them who as thei pass the conqueror seat
in state halt to make a prayer to him for those who were left
behind a few also who rememb rosamund and that it wa
becaus of her sacrific that thei continu to look upon the
sun implor him that if thei were not alreadi dead he would
spare her and her brave knight
at length it wa over and saladin took possess of the citi
have purg the great mosqu wash it with rosewat he
worship in it after hi own fashion and distribut the
remnant of the peopl who could pai no ransom as slave among hi
emir and follow thu did the crescent triumph aver the cross
in jerusalem not in a sea of blood as nineti year befor the
cross had triumph over the crescent within it wall but with
what in those dai pass for gentl peac and merci
for it wa left to the saracen to teach someth of their own
doctrin to the follow of christ
dure all those forti dai rosamund and wulf lai in their
separ prison await their doom of death the letter of
godwin wa brought to wulf who read it and rejoic to learn
that hi brother live then it wa taken from him to rosamund
who although she rejoic also wept over it and wonder a
littl what it might mean of on thing she wa sure from it
wordingthat thei had no hope of life
thei knew that jerusalem had fallen for thei heard the shout of
triumph of the moslem and from far awai through their prison
bar could see the endless multitud of fugit pass the
ancient gate laden with baggag and lead their children by
the hand to seek refug in the citi of the coast at thi
sight although it wa so sad rosamund wa happi know also
that now she would not suffer in vain
at length the camp broke up saladin and mani of the soldier
enter jerusalem but still the pair were left languish in
their dismal cell which were fashion from old tomb on
even while rosamund wa kneel at prayer befor she sought
her bed the door of the place wa open and there appear a
glitter captain and a guard of soldier who salut her and
bade her follow him
is it the end she ask
ladi he answer it is the end so she bow her head
meekli and follow without a litter wa readi in which thei
place her and bore her through the bright moonlight into the
citi of jerusalem and along the wai of sorrow till thei halt
at a great door which she knew again for by it stood the
ancient arch
thei have brought me back to the convent of the holi cross to
kill me where i ask that i might be buri she murmur to
herself as she descend from the litter
then the door were thrown open and she enter the great
courtyard of the convent and saw that it wa decor as though
for a festiv for about it and in the cloister round hung mani
lamp more these cloister and the space in front of them were
crowd with saracen lord wear their robe of state while
yonder sat saladin and hi court

again then a littl cry broke from her lip for there in front
of the throne of saladin the moonlight and the lampblaz
shine on hi armour stood a tall christian knight at that cry
he turn hi head and she grew sure that it wa wulf wast
somewhat and grown pale but still wulf

right and rosamund to the left and she went with a pale face and
high head to meet her execution wonder if she would see
godwin er she di thei led her to a chamber where women wait
but no swordsman that she could see and shut the door upon her
perchanc i am to be strangl by these women thought
rosamund as thei came toward her so that the blood royal mai
not be shed
yet it wa not so for with gentl hand but in silenc thei
unrob her and wash her with scent water and braid her
hair twist it up with pearl and gem then thei clad her in
fine linen and put over it gorgeou broider garment and a

about her head a gauzi veil work with golden star it wa just
such a veil as wulf gift which she had worn on the night when
hassan drag her from her home at steepl she note it and
