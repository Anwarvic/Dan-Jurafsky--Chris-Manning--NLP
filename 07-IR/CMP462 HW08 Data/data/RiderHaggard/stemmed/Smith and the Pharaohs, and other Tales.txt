thei demonstr conclus that there is noth in man which the
dissectingt will not explain that hi aspir toward anoth
life have their root in the fear of death or sai other of them in
that of earthquak or thunder that hi affin with the past ar
mere inherit from remot ancestor who live in that past perhap a
million year ago and that everyth nobl about him is but the fruit
of expedi or of a veneer of civilis while everyth base must
be attribut to the instinct of hi domin and primev natur man
in short is an anim who like everi other anim is final subdu
by hi environ and take hi colour from hi surround as cattl

at time we ar inclin to agre with these sage especi after it

as the matter of the univers
an incid in the career of mr jame ebenez smith might well
occas such reflect were ani acquaint with it detail which
until thi it set forth wa not the case mr smith is a person
who know when to be silent still undoubtedli it gave caus for
thought to on individualnam to him to whom it happen inde
jame ebenez smith is still think over it think veri hard
inde
j e smith wa well born and well educ when he wa a goodlook
and abl young man at colleg but befor he had taken hi degre
troubl came to him the particular of which do not matter and he wa
thrown penniless also friendless upon the rocki bosom of the world
no not quit friendless for he had a godfath a gentleman connect
with busi whose christian name wa ebenez to him as a last
resourc smith went feel that ebenez ow him someth in return
for the aw appel wherewith he had been endow in baptism
to a certain extent ebenez recognis the oblig he did noth
heroic but he found hi godson a clerkship in a bank of which he wa
on of the directorsa modest clerkship no more also when he di a
year later he left him a hundr pound to be spent upon some souvenir
smith be of a practic turn of mind instead of adorn himself
with memori jewelleri for which he had no us invest the hundr
pound in an exceedingli promis specul as it happen he wa
not misinform and hi talent return to him multipli by ten he
repeat the experi and be in a posit to know what he wa
do with consider success by the time that he wa thirti he
found himself possess of a fortun of someth over twentyf
thousand pound then and thi show the wise and practic natur of
the man he stop specul and put out hi monei in such a fashion
that it brought him a safe and clear four per cent
by thi time smith be an excel man of busi wa well up in
the servic of hi banka yet onli a clerk it is true but on who
drew hi four hundr pound a year with prospect in short he wa in
a posit to marri had he wish to do so as it happen he did not
wishperhap becaus be veri friendless no ladi who attract him
cross hi path perhap for other reason
shy and reserv in tempera he confid onli in himself none not
even hi superior at the bank or the board of manag knew how
well off he had becom no on visit him at the flat which he wa
understood to occupi somewher in the neighbourhood of putnei he
belong to no club and possess not a singl intim the blow which
the world had dealt him in hi earli dai the harsh repuls and the
rough treatment he had then experienc sank so deep into hi sensit
soul that never again did he seek close convers with hi kind in fact
while still young he fell into a condit of oldbachelorhood of a
refin type
soon howev smith discoveredit wa after he had given up
speculatingthat a man must have someth to occupi hi mind he tri
philanthropi but found himself too sensit for a busi which
so often resolv itself into rude inquiri as to the affair of other
peopl after a struggl therefor he compromis with hi conscienc
by set asid a liber portion of hi incom for anonym
distribut among deserv person and object
while still in thi vacant frame of mind smith chanc on dai when the
bank wa close to drift into the british museum more to escap the
vile weather that prevail without than for ani other reason wander
hither and thither at hazard he found himself in the great galleri
devot to egyptian stone object and sculptur the place bewild
him somewhat for he knew noth of egyptolog inde there remain
upon hi mind onli a sens of wonder not unmix with aw it must
have been a great peopl he thought to himself that execut these
work and with the thought came a desir to know more about them yet
he wa go awai when suddenli hi ey fell on the sculptur head of a
woman which hung upon the wall
smith look at it onc twice thrice and at the third look he fell in
love needless to sai he wa not awar that such wa hi condit
he knew onli that a chang had come over him and never never could
he forget the face which that carven mask portrai perhap it wa not
realli beauti save for it wondrou and mystic smile perhap the
lip were too thick and the nostril too broad yet to him that face
wa beauti itself beauti which drew him as with a cartrop and awok
within him all kind of wonder imagin some of them so strang
and tender that almost thei partook of the natur of memori he stare
at the imag and the imag smile back sweetli at him as doubtless it
or rather it originalfor thi wa but a plaster casthad smile at
nothing in some tomb or hidinghol for over thirti centuri and
as the woman whose like it wa had onc smile upon the world
a short stout gentleman bustl up and in tone of author
address some workmen who were arrang a base for a neighbour
statu it occur to smith that he must be someon who knew about
these object overcom hi natur diffid with an effort he
rais hi hat and ask the gentleman if he could tell him who wa the
origin of the mask
the officialwho in fact wa a veri great man in the museumglanc
at smith shrewdli and see that hi interest wa genuin answer
i dont know nobodi know she ha been given sever name but none
of them have author perhap on dai the rest of the statu mai
be found and then we shall learnthat is if it is inscrib most
like howev it ha been burnt for lime long ago
then you cant tell me anyth about her said smith
well onli a littl to begin with that a cast the origin is in
the cairo museum mariett found it i believ at karnac and gave it
a name after hi fashion probabl she wa a queenof the eighteenth
dynasti by the work but you can see her rank for yourself from the
broken uraeu smith did not stop him to explain that he had not
the faintest idea what a uraeu might be see that he wa utterli
unfamiliar with the snakehead crest of egyptian royalti you should
go to egypt and studi the head for yourself it is on of the most
beauti thing that ever wa found well i must be off good dai
and he bustl down the long galleri
smith found hi wai upstair and look at mummi and other thing
somehow it hurt him to reflect that the owner of yonder sweet allur
face must have becom a mummi long long befor the christian era
mummi did not strike him as attract
he return to the statuari and stare at hi plaster cast till on of
the workmen remark to hi fellow that if he were the gent hed go and
look at a liveun for a chang
then smith retir abash
on hi wai home he call at hi booksel and order all the
best work on egyptolog when a dai or two later thei arriv in
a packingcas togeth with a bill for thirtyeight pound he wa
somewhat dismai still he tackl those book like a man and be
clever and industri within three month had a fair work knowledg
of the subject and had even pick up a smatter of hieroglyph
in januarythat wa at the end of those three monthssmith astonish
hi board of director by appli for ten week leav he who had
hitherto been content with a fortnight in the year when question he
explain that he had been suffer from bronchiti and wa advis to
take a chang in egypt
a veri good idea said the manag but im afraid youll find it
expens thei fleec on in egypt
i know answer smith but iv save a littl and have onli myself
to spend it upon
so smith went to egypt and saw the origin of the beauteou head and
a thousand other fascin thing inde he did more attach
himself to some excav who were glad of hi intellig assist
he actual dug for a month in the neighbourhood of ancient thebe but
without find anyth in particular
it wa not till two year later that he made hi great discoveri that
which is known as smith tomb here it mai be explain that the state
of hi health had becom such as to necessit an annual visit to
egypt or so hi superior understood
howev as he ask for no summer holidai and wa alwai readi to do
anoth man work or to stop overtim he found it easi to arrang for
these winter excurs
on thi hi third visit to egypt smith obtain from the
directorgener of antiqu at cairo a licenc to dig upon hi
own account be alreadi well known in the countri as a skill
egyptologist thi wa grant upon the usual termsnam that the
depart of antiqu should have a right to take ani of the object
which might be found or all of them if it so desir
such preliminari matter have been arrang by correspond smith
after a few dai spent in the museum at cairo took the night train
to luxor where he found hi headman an exdragoman name mahomet
wait for him and hi fellaheen labour alreadi hire there were
but forti of them for hi wa a compar small ventur three
hundr pound wa the amount that he had made up hi mind to expend
and such a sum doe not go far in excav
dure hi visit of the previou year smith had mark the place where
he meant to dig it wa in the cemeteri of old thebe at the wild spot
not far from the templ of medinet habu that is known as the vallei of
the queen here separ from the restingplac of their royal lord
by the bold mass of the interven hill some of the greatest ladi of
egypt have been laid to rest and it wa their tomb that smith desir
to investig as he knew well some of these must yet remain to be
discov who could sai fortun favour the bold it might be that he
would find the holi grave of that beauteou unknown royalti whose face
had haunt him for three long year
for a whole month he dug without the slightest success the spot that
he select had prove inde to be the mouth of a tomb after
twentyf dai of labori explor it wa at length clear out
and he stood in a rude unfinish cave the queen for whom it had been
design must have di quit young and been buri elsewher or she
had chosen herself anoth sepulchr or mayhap the rock had prove
unsuit for sculptur
smith shrug hi shoulder and move on sink trial pit and
trench here and there but still find noth twothird of hi
time and monei had been spent when at last the luck turn on dai
toward even with some halfdozen of hi best men he wa return
after a fruitless morn of labour when someth seem to attract
him toward a littl wadi or bai in the hillsid that wa fill
with tumbl rock and sand there were score of such place and thi
on look no more promis than ani of the other had prove to be
yet it attract him thoroughli dispirit he walk past it twenti
pace or more then turn
where go you sah ask hi headman mahomet
he point to the recess in the cliff
no good sah said mahomet no tomb there bedrock too near top too
much water run in there dead queen like keep dry
but smith went on and the other follow obedi
he walk down the littl slope of sand and boulder and examin the
cliff it wa virgin rock never a tool mark wa to be seen alreadi the
men were go when the same strang instinct which had drawn him to
the spot caus him to take a spade from on of them and begin to shovel
awai the sand from the face of the clifffor here for some unexplain
reason were no boulder or debri see their master to whom thei
were attach at work thei began to work too and for twenti minut
or more dug on cheerfulli enough just to humour him sinc all were
sure that here there wa no tomb at length smith order them to
desist for although now thei were six feet down the rock remain of
the same virgin charact
with an exclam of disgust he threw out a last shovel of sand
the edg of hi spade struck on someth that project he clear
awai a littl more sand and there appear a round ledg which seem
to be a cornic call back the men he point to it and without a
word all of them began to dig again five minut more of work made it
clear that it wa a cornic and half an hour later there appear the
top of the doorwai of a tomb
old peopl wall him up said mahomet point to the flat stone set
in mud for mortar with which the doorwai had been close and to the
undecipher impress upon the mud of the scarab seal of the offici
whose duti it had been to close the last restingplac of the royal dead
for ever
perhap queen all right insid he went on receiv no answer to hi
remark
perhap repli smith briefli dig man dig dont wast time in
talk
so thei dug on furious till at length smith saw someth which caus
him to groan aloud there wa a hole in the masonryth tomb had been
broken into mahomet saw it too and examin the top of the apertur
with hi skill ey
veri old thief he said look he try build up wall again but run
awai befor he have time finish and he point to certain flat stone
which had been roughli and hurriedli replac
digdig said smith
ten minut more and the apertur wa clear it wa onli just big
enough to admit the bodi of a man
by now the sun wa set swiftli swiftli it seem to tumbl down
the sky on minut it wa abov the rough crest of the western hill
behind them the next a great ball of glow fire it rest on their
topmost ridg then it wa gone for an instant a kind of green spark
shone where it had been thi too went out and the sudden egyptian
night wa upon them
the fellaheen mutter among themselv and on or two of them wander
off on some pretext the rest threw down their tool and look at
smith men sai thei no like stop here thei afraid of ghost too
mani afreet live in these tomb that what thei sai come back finish
tomorrow morn when it light veri foolish peopl these common
fellaheen remark mahomet in a superior tone
quit so repli smith who knew well that noth that he could
offer would tempt hi men to go on with the open of a tomb after
sunset let them go awai you and i will stop and watch the place till
morn
sorri sah said mahomet but i not feel quit well insid think i
got fever i go to camp and lie down and prai under plenti blanket
all right go said smith but if there is anyon who is not a
coward let him bring me my big coat someth to eat and drink and
the lantern that hang in my tent i will meet him there in the vallei
mahomet though rather doubtfulli promis that thi should be done
and after beg smith to accompani them lest the spirit of whoever
slept in the tomb should work him a mischief dure the night thei
depart quickli enough
smith lit hi pipe sat down on the sand and wait half an hour later
he heard a sound of sing and through the dark which wa dens
saw light come up the vallei
my brave men he thought to himself and scrambl up the slope to
meet them
he wa right these were hi men no less than twenti of them for with
a fewer number thei did not dare to face the ghost which thei believ
haunt the vallei after nightfal present the light from the lantern
which on of them carri not mahomet whose sick had increas too
suddenli to enabl him to come fell upon the tall form of smith who
dress in hi white work cloth wa lean against a rock down
went the lantern and with a howl of terror the brave compani turn and
fled
son of coward roar smith after them in hi most vigor arab
it is i your master not an afreet
thei heard and by degre crept back again then he perceiv that in
order to account for their number each of them carri some articl
thu on had the bread anoth the lantern anoth a tin of sardin
anoth the sardineopen anoth a box of match anoth a bottl
of beer and so on as even thu there were not enough thing to go
round two of them bore hi big coat between them the first hold it
by the sleev and the second by the tail as though it were a stretcher
put them down said smith and thei obei now he ad run for
your live i thought i heard two afreet talk up there just now
of what thei would do to ani follow of the prophet who mock their
god if perchanc thei should meet them in their holi place at night
thi kindli counsel wa accept with much eager in anoth minut
smith wa alon with the star and the dy desert wind
collect hi good or as mani of them as he want he thrust them
into the pocket of the greatcoat and return to the mouth of the
tomb here he made hi simpl meal by the light of the lantern and
afterward tri to go to sleep but sleep he could not someth
alwai woke him first it wa a jackal howl amongst the rock next
a sandfli bit him in the ankl so sharpli that he thought he must have
been stung by a scorpion then notwithstand hi warm coat the
cold got hold of him for the cloth beneath were wet through with
perspir and it occur to him that unless he did someth he
would probabl contract an intern chill or perhap fever he rose and
walk about
by now the moon wa up reveal all the sad wild scene in it everi
detail the mysteri of egypt enter hi soul and oppress him how
much dead majesti lai in the hill upon which he stood were thei all
realli dead he wonder or were those fellaheen right did their
spirit still come forth at night and wander through the land where onc
thei rule of cours that wa the egyptian faith accord to which
the ka or doubl etern haunt the place where it earthli
counterpart had been laid to rest when on came to think of it beneath
a mass of unintellig symbol there wa much in the egyptian faith
which it wa hard for a christian to disbeliev salvat through a
redeem for instanc and the resurrect of the bodi had he smith
not alreadi written a treatis upon these point of similar which he
propos to publish on dai not under hi own name well he would not
think of them now the occas seem scarc fittingthei came home
too pointedli to on who wa engag in violat a tomb
hi mind or rather hi imaginationof which he had plentyw off at
a tangent what sight had thi place seen thousand of year ago onc
thousand of year ago a process had wound up along the roadwai
which wa doubtless buri beneath the sand whereon he stood toward
the dark door of thi sepulchr he could see it as it pass in and
out between the rock the priest shavenhead and robe in leopard
skin or some of them in pure white bear the mystic symbol of
their offic the funer sledg drawn by oxen and on it the great
rectangular case that contain the outer and the inner coffin and
within them the mummi of some depart majesti in the egyptian formula
the hawk that had spread it wing and flown into the bosom of
osiri god of death behind the mourner rend the air with their
lament then those who bore the funer furnitur and offer
then the high offic of state and the first priest of amen and of
the other god then the sister queen lead by the hand a wonder
child or two then the son of pharaoh young men carri the emblem
of their rank
lastli walk alon pharaoh himself in hi ceremoni robe hi
apron hi doubl crown of linen surmount by the golden snake hi
inlaid bracelet and hi heavi tinkl ear pharaoh hi head
bow hi feet travel wearili and in hi heartwhat thought
sorrow perhap for her who had depart yet he had other queen and
fair women without count doubtless she wa sweet and beauti but
sweet and beauti were not given to her alon moreov wa she not
wont to cross hi will and to question hi divin no sure it
is not onli of her that he think her for whom he had prepar thi
splendid tomb with all thing need to unit her with the god sure
he think also of himself and that other tomb on the farther side of the
hill whereat the artist labour dai by dayy and have labour these
mani year that tomb to which befor so veri long he too must travel in
just thi fashion to seek hi place beyond the door of death who lai
hi equal hand on king and queen and slave
the vision pass it wa so real that smith thought he must have been
dream well he wa awak now and colder than ever moreov the
jackal had multipli there were a whole pack of them and not far
awai look on cross in the ring of the lamplight a slink yellow
beast that smelt the remain of dinner or perhap it smelt himself
moreov there were bad charact who haunt these mountain and he
wa alon and quit unarm perhap he ought to put out the light which
advertis hi whereabout it would be wise and yet in thi particular
he reject wisdom after all the light wa some compani
sinc sleep seem to be out of the question he fell back upon poor
human other anodyn work which ha the incident advantag of
gener warmth seiz a shovel he began to dig at the doorwai of
the tomb whilst the jackal howl louder than ever in astonish
thei were not us to such a sight for thousand of year as the old
moon abov could have told no man or at least no solitari man had
dare to rob tomb at such an unnatur hour
when smith had been dig for about twenti minut someth tinkl
on hi shovel with a nois which sound loud in that silenc
a stone which mai come in handi for the jackal he thought to
himself shake the sand slowli off the spade until it appear there
it wa and not larg enough to be of much servic still he pick it
up and rub it in hi hand to clear off the encrust dirt when he
open them he saw that it wa no stone but a bronz
osiri reflect smith buri in front of the tomb to hallow the
ground no an isi no the head of a statuett and a jolli good
on tooat ani rate in moonlight seem to have been gild and
reach out for the lamp he held it over the object
anoth minut and he found himself sit at the bottom of the hole
lamp in on hand and statuett or rather head in the other
the queen of the mask he gasp the sameth same by heaven the
veri same
oh he could not be mistaken there were the ident lip a littl
thick and pout the ident nostril curv and quiver but a
littl wide the ident arch eyebrow and dreami ey set somewhat
far apart abov all there wa the ident allur and mysteri
smile onli on thi masterpiec of ancient art wa set a whole crown of
uraei surround the entir head beneath the crown and press back
behind the ear wa a fullbottom wig or royal headdress of which
the end descend to the breast the statuett that have been
gilt remain quit perfect and uncorrod wa broken just abov the
middl appar by a singl violent blow for the fractur wa veri
clean
at onc it occur to smith that it had been stolen from the tomb by
a thief who thought it to be gold that outsid of the tomb doubt had
overtaken him and caus him to break it upon a stone or otherwis the
rest wa clear find that it wa but goldwash bronz he had thrown
awai the fragment rather than be at the pain of carri them thi
wa hi theori probabl not a correct on as the sequel seem to show
smith first idea wa to recov the other portion he search quit a
long while but without success neither then nor afterward could it
be found he reflect that perhap thi lower half had remain in the
thief hand who in hi vexat had thrown it far awai leav
the head to lie where it fell again smith examin thi head and more
close now he saw that just beneath the breast wa a delic cut
cartouch
be by thi time a master of hieroglyph he read it without
troubl it ran mame great royal ladi belov of here the
cartouch wa broken awai
mame or it might be mami he reflect i never heard of a queen
call mame or mami or mamu she must be quit new to histori i
wonder of whom she wa belov amen or horu or isi probabl of
some god i have no doubt at least i hope so
he stare at the beauti portrait in hi hand as onc he had stare
at the cast on the museum wall and the beauti portrait emerg
from the dust of ag smile back at him there in the solemn moonlight
as onc the cast had smile from the museum wall onli that had been but
a cast wherea thi wa real thi had slept with the dead from whose
featur it had been fashion the dead who lai or who had lain
within
a sudden resolut took hold of smith he would explor that tomb at
onc and alon no on should accompani him on thi hi first visit
it would be a sacrileg that anyon save himself should set foot there
until he had look on what it might contain
why should he not enter hi lamp of what is call the hurrican
brand wa veri good and bright and would burn for mani hour
moreov there had been time for the foul air to escap through the
hole that thei had clear lastli someth seem to call on him to
come and see he place the bronz head in hi breastpocket over hi
heart and thrust the lamp through the hole look down here there
wa no difficulti sinc sand had drift in to the level of the bottom
of the apertur through it he struggl to find himself upon a bed of
sand that onli just left him room to push himself along between it and
the roof a littl farther on the passag wa almost fill with mud
mahomet had been right when from hi knowledg of the bedrock he said
that ani tomb made in thi place must be flood it had been flood
by some ancient rainstorm and smith began to fear that he would find
it quit fill with soil cake as hard as iron so inde it wa to
a certain depth a result that appar had been anticip by those
who hollow it for thi entranc shaft wa left quit undecor
inde as smith found afterward a hole had been dug beneath the
doorwai to allow the mud to enter after the burial wa complet onli a
miscalcul had been made the natur level of the mud did not quit
reach the roof of the tomb and therefor still left it open
after crawl for forti feet or so over thi cake mud smith suddenli
found himself on a rise stair then he understood the plan the tomb
itself wa on a higher level
here began the paint here the queen mame wear her crown and
dress in diaphan garment wa present to god after god between
her figur and those of the divin the wall wa cover with
hieroglyph as fresh todai as on that when the artist had limn them
a glanc told him that thei were extract from the book of the dead
when the thief of bygon ag had broken into the tomb probabl not
veri long after the inter the mud over which smith had just crawl
wa still wet thi he could tell sinc the clai from the rascal
feet remain upon the stair and that upon hi finger had stain the
paint on the wall against which he had support himself inde
in on place wa an exact impress of hi hand show it shape and
even the line of the skin
at the top of the flight of step ran anoth passag at a higher
level which the water had never reach and to right and left were the
begin of unfinish chamber it wa clear to him that thi queen
had di young her tomb as she or the king had design it wa never
finish a few more pace and the passag enlarg itself into a hall
about thirti feet squar the ceil wa decor with vultur their
wing outspread the loop cross of life hang from their talon
on on wall her majesti mame stood expect while anubi weigh her
heart against the feather of truth and thoth the record wrote down
the verdict upon hi tablet all her titl were given to her here
such asgreat royal heiress royal sister royal wife royal mother
ladi of the two land palmbranch of love beautifulexceedingli
smith read them hurriedli and note that nowher could he see the name
of the king who had been her husband it would almost seem as though
thi had been purpos omit on the other wall mame accompani
by her ka or doubl made offer to the variou god or utter
propitiatori speech to the hideou demon of the underworld declar
their name to them and forc them to sai pass on thou art pure
lastli on the end wall triumphant all her trial done she the
justifi osiri or spirit wa receiv by the god osiri saviour of
spirit
all these thing smith note hurriedli as he swung the lamp to and fro
in that hallow place then he saw someth els which fill him with
dismai on the floor of the chamber where the coffin had beenfor thi
wa the burial chamberlai a heap of black fragment char with fire
instantli he understood after the thief had done hi work he had burn
the mummycas and with them the bodi of the queen there could be
no doubt that thi wa so for look among the ash lai some calcin
human bone while the roof abov wa blacken with the smoke and
crack by the heat of the conflagr there wa noth left for him
to find
oppress with the close of the atmospher he sat down upon a
littl bench or tabl cut in the rock that evid had been meant
to receiv offer to the dead inde on it still lai the scorch
remain of some votiv flower here hi lamp between hi feet he
rest a while stare at those calcin bone see yonder wa the
lower jaw and in it some teeth small white regular and but littl
worn ye she had di young then he turn to go for disappoint
and the holi of the place overcam him he could endur no more of
it that night
leav the burial hall he walk along the paint passag the lamp
swing and hi ey fix upon the floor he wa dishearten and the
paint could wait till the morrow he descend the step and came to
the foot of the mud slope here suddenli he perceiv project from
some sand that had drift down over the mud what seem to be the
corner of a reed box or basket to clear awai the sand wa easi
andy it wa a basket a foot or so in length such a basket as
the old egyptian us to contain the funer figur which ar call
ushapti or other object connect with the dead it look as
though it had been drop for it lai upon it side smith open
itnot veri hopefulli for sure noth of valu would have been
abandon thu
the first thing that met hi ey wa a mummi hand broken off at the
wrist a woman littl hand most delic shape it wa wither
and paperwhit but the contour still remain the long finger were
perfect and the almondshap nail had been stain with henna as wa
the embalm fashion on the hand were two gold ring and for those
ring it had been stolen smith look at it for a long while and hi
heart swell within him for here wa the hand of that royal ladi of
hi dream
inde he did more than look he kiss it and as hi lip touch
the holi relic it seem to him as though a wind cold but scent blew
upon hi brow then grow fear of the thought that aros within
him he hurri hi mind back to the world or rather to the examin
of the basket
here he found other object roughli wrap in fragment of mummycloth
that had been torn from the bodi of the queen these it is needless to
describ for ar thei not to be seen in the gold room of the museum
label bijouteri de la rein mame xviiiem dynasti thebe
smith tomb it mai be mention howev that the set wa
incomplet for instanc there wa but on of the great gold ceremoni
ear fashion like a group of pomegran bloom and the most
beauti of the necklac had been torn in twohalf of it wa miss
it wa clear to smith that onli a portion of the preciou object which
were buri with the mummi had been place in thi basket why had these
been left where he found them a littl reflect made that clear also
someth had prompt the thief to destroi the desecr bodi and it
coffin with fire probabl in the hope of hide hi evil handiwork
then he fled with hi spoil but he had forgotten how fierc mummi
and their trap can burn or perhap the thing wa an accid he
must have had a lamp and if it flame chanc to touch thi bitumin
tinder
at ani rate the smoke overtook the man in that narrow place as he began
to climb the slipperi slope of clai in hi hast he drop the basket
and dare not return to search for it it could wait till the morrow
when the fire would be out and the air pure onli for thi desecr of
the royal dead that morrow never came as wa discov afterward
when at length smith struggl into the open air the star were pale
befor the dawn an hour later after the sky wa well up mahomet
recov from hi sick and hi myrmidon arriv
i have been busi while you slept said smith show them the mummi
hand but not the ring which he had remov from the shrunk finger
and the broken bronz but not the priceless jewelleri which wa hidden
in hi pocket
for the next ten dai thei dug till the tomb and it approach were quit
clear in the sand at the head of a flight of step which led down to
the doorwai thei found the skeleton of a man who evid had been
buri there in a hurri fashion hi skull wa shatter by the blow
of an ax and the shaven scalp that still clung to it suggest that he
might have been a priest
mahomet thought and smith agre with him that thi wa the person who
had violat the tomb as he wa escap from it the guard of the holi
place surpris him after he had cover up the hole by which he had
enter and purpos to return there thei execut him without trial
and divid up the plunder think that no more wa to be found or
perhap hi confeder kill him
such at least were the theori advanc by mahomet whether thei were
right or wrong none will ever know for instanc the skeleton mai not
have been that of the thief though probabl appear to point the
other wai
noth more wa found in the tomb not even a scarab or a mummybead
smith spent the remaind of hi time in photograph the pictur
and copi the inscript which for variou reason prove to be of
extraordinari interest then have rever buri the char bone
of the queen in a secret place of the sepulchr he hand it over to
the care of the local guardian of antiqu paid off mahomet and the
fellaheen and depart for cairo with him went the wonder jewel

the director clasp the imag tenderli and hold it to the light
read the broken cartouch beneath the breast
mame great royal ladi belov of belov of whom well of
smith for on take it monsieur and hide it awai at onc lest soon
there should be anoth mummi in thi collect a modern mummi call

smith produc a cigarbox in it wa the hand wrap in cotton wool
ah said the director a pretti wellbr hand no doubt thi
mame wa the real heiress to the throne as she describ herself
the pharaoh wa somebodi of inferior birth halfbrothersh is call
royal sister you rememberson of on of the pharaoh slavewomen
perhap odd that she never mention him in the tomb it look as
though thei didnt get on in life and that she wa determin to have
done with him in death those were the ring upon that hand were thei
not
he replac them on the finger then took off on a royal signet in a
cartouch and read the inscript on the other be ank ank be
be the live the live be
your mame had some human vaniti about her he ad be among
other thing as you know wa the god of beauti and of the adorn
of women she wore that ring that she might remain beauti and that
her dress might alwai fit and her roug never cake when she wa
danc befor the god also it fix her period pretti close but
then so do other thing it seem a piti to rob mame of her pet ring
doe it not the royal signet will be enough for us
with a littl bow he gave the hand back to smith leav the be ring
on the finger that had worn it for more than three thousand year at
least smith wa so sure it wa the be ring that at the time he did not
look at it again
then thei part smith promis to return upon the morrow which
ow to event to be describ he did not do
ah said the master to himself as the door close behind hi visitor
he in a hurri to be gone he ha fear lest i should chang my mind
about that ring also there is the bronz monsieur smith wa ruse
there it is worth a thousand pound that bronz yet i do not believ
he wa think of the monei i believ he is in love with that mame
and want to keep her pictur mon dieu a wellestablish affect
at least he is what the english call an odd fish on whom i could never
make out and of whom no on seem to know anyth still honest i
am surequit honest why he might have kept everi on of those jewel
and no on have been the wiser and what thing what a find ciel
what a find there ha been noth like it for year benedict on
the head of oddfish smith
then he collect the preciou object thrust them into an inner
compart of hi safe which he lock and doublelock and as
it wa nearli five oclock depart from the museum to hi privat
resid in the ground there to studi smith copi and photograph
and to tell some friend of the great thing that had happen
when smith found himself outsid the sacr door and had present it
vener guardian with a baksheesh of five piastr he walk a few
pace to the right and paus a while to watch some nativ labour
who were drag a huge sarcophagu upon an improvis tramwai as thei
drag thei sang an echo rhythmic song whereof each line end with
an invoc to allah
just so reflect smith had their forefath sung when millennium
ago thei drag that veri sarcophagu from the quarri to the nile
and from the nile to the tomb whenc it reappear todai or when thei
slid the case block of the pyramid up the great causewai and smooth
slope of sand and laid them in their dizzi restingplac onli then
each line of the immemori chant of toil end with an invoc to
amen now transform to allah the east mai chang it master and
it god but it custom never chang and if todai allah wore the
feather of amen on wonder whether the worshipp would find the
differ so veri great
thu thought smith as he hurri awai from the sarcophagu and those
bluerob darkskin fellaheen down the long galleri that is fill
with a thousand sculptur for a moment he paus befor the wonder
white statu of queen amenarta then rememb that hi time wa
short hasten on to a certain room on of those which open out of
the galleri
in a corner of thi room upon the wall amongst mani other beauti
object stood that head which mariett had found whereof in past year
the cast had fascin him in london now he knew whose head it wa
to him it had been given to find the tomb of her who had sat for that
statu her veri hand wa in hi pockety the hand that had touch
yonder marbl point out it defect to the sculptor or perhap
swear that he flatter her smith wonder who that sculptor wa
sure he must have been a happi man also he wonder whether the
statuett wa also thi master work he thought so but he wish to
make sure
near to the end of the room he stop and look about him like a
thief he wa alon in the place not a singl student or tourist could
be seen and it guardian wa somewher els he drew out the box
that contain the hand from the hand he slip the ring which the
directorgener had left there as a gift to himself he would much have
prefer the other with the signet but how could he sai so especi
after the episod of the statuett
replac the hand in hi pocket without look at the ringfor hi
ey were watch to see whether he wa observedh set it upon hi
littl finger which it exactli fit mame had worn both of them
upon the third finger of her left hand the be ring as a guard to the
signet he had the fanci to approach the effigi of mame wear a
ring which she had worn and that came straight from her finger to hi
own
smith found the head in it accustom place week had gone by sinc he
look upon it and now to hi ey it had grown more beauti
than ever and it smile wa more mystic and live he drew out the
statuett and began to compar them point by point oh no doubt wa
possibl both were like of the same woman though the statuett
might have been execut two or three year later than the statu to
him the face of it look a littl older and more spiritu perhap
ill or some premonit of her end had then thrown it shadow on
the queen he compar and compar he made some rough measur
and sketch in hi pocketbook and set himself to work out a canon of
proport
so hard and earnestli did he work so lost wa hi mind that he never
heard the accustom warn sound which announc that the museum
is about to close hidden behind an altar as he wa in hi distant
shadow corner the guardian of the room never saw him as he cast
a last perfunctori glanc about the place befor depart till the
saturdai morn for the morrow wa fridai the mohammedan sabbath
on which the museum remain shut and he would not be call upon to
attend so he went everybodi went the great door clang were lock
and bolt and save for a watchman outsid no on wa left in all
that vast place except smith in hi corner engag in sketch and in
measur
the difficulti of see ow to the increas of shadow first call
hi attent to the fact that time wa slip awai he glanc at hi
watch and saw that it wa ten minut to the hour
soon be time to go he thought to himself and resum hi work
how strang silent the place seem not a footstep to be heard or the
sound of a human voic he look at hi watch again and saw that
it wa six oclock not five or so the thing said but that wa
imposs for the museum shut at five evid the desert sand had
got into the work the room in which he stood wa that known as room
i and he had notic that it arab custodian often frequent room k or
the galleri outsid he would find him and ask what wa the real time
pass round the effigi of the wonder hathor cow perhap the finest
exampl of an ancient sculptur of a beast in the whole world smith
came to the doorwai and look up and down the galleri not a soul to
be seen he ran to room k to room h and other still not a soul to be
seen then he made hi wai as fast as he could go to the great entranc
the door were lock and bolt
watch must be right after all im shut in he said to himself
howev there sure to be someon about somewher probabl the
sall de vent is still open shop dont shut till thei ar
oblig
thither he went to find it door as firmli close as a door can be he
knock on it but a sepulchr echo wa the onli answer
i know he reflect the director must still be in hi room it will
take him a long while to examin all that jewelleri and put it awai
so for the room he head and after lose hi path twice found it
by help of the sarcophagu that the arab had been drag which now
stood as desert as it had done in the tomb a lonesom and impress
object in the gather shadow the director door wa shut and again
hi knock produc noth but an echo he start on a tour round
the museum and have search the ground floor ascend to the
upper galleri by the great stairwai
present he found himself in that devot to the royal mummi and
be tire rest there a while opposit to him in a glass case in
the middl of the galleri repos rames ii near to on shelv in
a side case were rames son meneptah and abov hi son seti
ii while in other case were the mortal remain of mani more of the
royalti of egypt he look at the proud face of rames and at the
littl fring of white lock turn yellow by the embalm spice
also at the rais left arm he rememb how the director had told
him that when thei were unrol thi mighti monarch thei went awai
to lunch and that present the man who had been left in charg of the
bodi rush into the room with hi hair on end and said that the dead
king had lift hi arm and point at him
back thei went and there true enough wa the arm lift nor were
thei ever abl to get it quit into it place again the explan
given wa that the warmth of the sun had contract the wither
muscl a veri natur and correct explan
still smith wish that he had not recollect the stori just at thi
moment especi as the arm seem to move while he contempl it
a veri littl but still to move
he turn round and gaze at meneptah whose hollow ey stare at him
from between the wrap carelessli thrown across the parchmentlik
and ashen face there probabl lai the counten that had frown
on mose there wa the heart which god had harden well it wa
hard enough now for the doctor said he di of ossif of the
arteri and that the vessel of the heart were full of lime
smith stood upon a chair and peep at seti ii abov hi weaker
counten wa veri peac but it seem to wear an air of reproach
in get down smith manag to upset the heavi chair the nois it
made wa terrif he would not have thought it possibl that the fall
of such an articl could produc so much sound satisfi with hi
inspect of these particular king who somehow look quit differ
now from what thei had ever done beforemor real and immin so to
speakh renew hi search for a live man
on he went mummi to hi right mummi to hi left of everi style
and period till he began to feel as though he never wish to see
anoth dri remnant of mortal he peep into the room where lai
the relic of iouiya and touiyou the father and mother of the great
queen taia cloth had been drawn over these and realli thei look
wors and more suggest thu drape than in their frigid and unadorn
black he came to the coffin of the priestk of the twentieth
dynasti formid paint coffin with human face there seem to be
a vast number of these priestk but perhap thei were better
than the gold mask of the great ptolema ladi which glint at him
through the gather gloom
realli he had seen enough of the upper floor the statu downstair
were better than all these dead although it wa true that accord to
the egyptian faith everi on of those statu wa haunt etern by
the ka or doubl of the person whom it repres he descend
the great stairwai wa it fanci or did someth run across the bottom
step in front of himan anim of some kind follow by a swiftmov
and indefinit shadow if so it must have been the museum cat hunt
a museum mous onli then what on earth wa that veri peculiar and
unpleas shadow
he call puss puss puss for he would have been quit glad of it
compani but there came no friendli miau in respons perhap it wa
onli the ka of a cat and the shadow wasoh never mind what the
egyptian worship cat and there were plenti of their mummi about
on the shelv but the shadow
onc he shout in the hope of attract attent for there were no
window to which he could climb he did not repeat the experi for
it seem as though a thousand voic were answer him from everi
corner and roof of the gigant edific
well he must face the thing out he wa shut in a museum and the
question wa in what part of it he should camp for the night moreov
as it wa grow rapidli dark the problem must be solv at onc he
thought with affect of the lavatori where befor go to see
the director onli that afternoon he had wash hi hand with the
assist of a kindli arab who watch the door and gracefulli accept
a piastr but there wa no arab there now and the door like everi
other in thi confound place wa lock he march on to the
entranc
here opposit to each other stood the red sarcophagi of the great
queen hatshepu and her brother and husband thotm iii he look at
them why should not on of these afford him a night lodg thei
were deep and quiet and would fit the human frame veri nice for a
while smith wonder which of these monarch would be the more like
to take offenc at such a us of a privat sarcophagu and act on
gener principl conclud that he would rather throw himself on the
merci of the ladi
alreadi on of hi leg wa over the edg of that solemn coffer and he
wa squeez hi bodi beneath the massiv lid that wa prop abov
it on block of wood when he rememb a littl nake wither
thing with long hair that he had seen in a side chamber of the tomb
of amenhotep ii in the vallei of king at thebe thi caricatur of
human mani thought and he agre with them to be the actual bodi of
the mighti hatshepu as it appear after the robber had done with it
suppos now that when he wa ly at the bottom of that sarcophagu
sleep the sleep of the just thi littl personag should peep over
it edg and ask him what he wa do there of cours the idea wa
absurd he wa tire and hi nerv were a littl shaken still the
fact remain that for centuri the hallow dust of queen hatshepu had
slept where he a modern man wa propos to sleep
he scrambl down from the sarcophagu and look round him in despair
opposit to the main entranc wa the huge central hall of the museum
now the cement roof of thi hall had he knew gone wrong with the
result that veri extens repair had becom necessari so extens
were thei inde that the directorgener had inform him that thei
would take sever year to complet therefor thi hall wa board
up onli a littl doorwai be left by which the workmen could enter
certain statu of seti ii and other too larg to be move were
also roughli board over as were some great funer boat on either
side of the entranc the rest of the place which might be two hundr
feet long with a proportion breadth wa empti save for the colossi
of amenhotep iii and hi queen taia that stood beneath the galleri at
it farther end
it wa an appal place in which to sleep but better reflect
smith than a sarcophagu or those mummi chamber if for instanc
he could creep behind the deal board that enclos on of the funer
boat he would be quit comfort there lift the curtain he
slip into the hall where the gloom of even had alreadi settl
onli the skylight and the outlin of the tower colossi at the far
end remain visibl close to him were the two funer boat which he
had note when he look into the hall earlier on that dai stand at
the head of a flight of step which led to the sunk floor of the centr
he grope hi wai to that on the right as he expect the project
plank were not quit join at the bow he crept in between them and
the boat and laid himself down
presum be altogeth tire out smith did ultim fall
asleep for how long he never knew at ani rate it is certain that if
so he woke up again he could not tell the time becaus hi watch
wa not a repeat and the place wa as black as the pit he had some
match in hi pocket and might have struck on and even have lit hi
pipe to hi credit be it said howev he rememb that he wa the
sole tenant of on of the most valuabl museum in the world and hi
respons with refer to fire so he refrain from strike
that match under the keel of a boat which had becom veri dry in the
cours of five thousand year
smith found himself veri wide awak inde never in all hi life did he
rememb be more so not even in the hour of it great catastroph
or when hi godfath ebenez after much hesit had promis him
a clerkship in the bank of which he wa a director hi nerv seem
strung tight as harpstr and hi everi sens wa painfulli acut
thu he could even smell the odour of mummi that float down from the
upper galleri and the earthi scent of the boat which had been buri
for thousand of year in sand at the foot of the pyramid of on of the
fifth dynasti king
moreov he could hear all sort of strang sound faint and farawai
sound which at first he thought must eman from cairo without soon
howev he grew sure that their origin wa more local doubtless the
cement work and the case in the galleri were crack audibl as is
the unpleas habit of such thing at night
yet why should these common manifest be so univers and affect
him so strang realli it seem as though peopl were stir all
about him more he could have sworn that the great funer boat beneath
which he lai had becom repeopl with the crew that onc it bore
he heard them at their busi abov him there were tramp and a
sound as though someth heavi were be laid on the deck such for
instanc as must have been made when the mummi of pharaoh wa set there
for it last journei to the western bank of the nile ye and now he
could have sworn again that the priestli crew were get out the oar
smith began to medit flight from the neighbourhood of that place when
someth occur which determin him to stop where he wa
the huge hall wa grow light but not as at first he hope with the
rai of dawn thi light wa pale and ghostli though veri penetr
also it had a blue ting unlik ani other he had ever seen at first
it aros in a kind of fan or fountain at the far end of the hall
illumin the step there and the two nobl colossi which sat abov
but what wa thi that stood at the head of the step radiat glori
by heaven it wa osiri himself or the imag of osiri god of the
dead the egyptian saviour of the world
there he stood in hi mummycloth wear the feather crown and
hold in hi hand which project from an open in the wrap
the crook and the scourg of power wa he aliv or wa he dead smith
could not tell sinc he never move onli stood there splendid and
fear hi calm benign face stare into nothing
smith becam awar that the dark between him and the vision of
thi god wa peopl that a great congreg wa gather or had
gather there the blue light began to grow long tongu of it shot
forward which join themselv togeth illumin all that huge
hall
now too he saw the congreg befor him rank upon rank of them
stood the king and queen of egypt as though at a given signal thei
bow themselv to the osiri and er the tinkl of their ornament
had di awai lo osiri wa gone but in hi place stood anoth
isi the mother of mysteri her deep ey look forth from beneath
the jewel vulturecap again the congreg bow and lo she wa
gone but in her place stood yet anoth a radiant love be who
held in her hand the sign of life and wore upon her head the symbol of
the shine dischathor goddess of love a third time the congreg
bow and she too wa gone nor did ani other appear in her place
the pharaoh and their queen began to move about and speak to each
other their voic came to hi ear in on low sweet murmur
in hi amaz smith had forgotten fear from hi hidingplac he watch
them intent some of them he knew by their face there for instanc
wa the longneck khuenaten talk somewhat angrili to the
imperi rames ii smith could understand what he said for thi power
seem to have been given to him he wa complain in a high weak
voic that on thi the on night of the year when thei might meet
the god or the magic imag of the god who were put up for them to
worship should not includ hi god symbol by the aten or the
sun disc
i have heard of your majesti god repli rames the priest us

interest in the question of plural marriag goodby i wish to have
a word with my grandfath rames i he wa fond of me as a littl
boi
at thi moment smith interest in that queer convers di awai
for of a sudden he beheld none other than the queen of hi dream
mame oh there she stood without a doubt onli ten time more
beauti than he had ever pictur her she wa tall and somewhat
faircomplexion with slumbrou dark ey and on her face gleam
the mystic smile he love she wore a robe of simpl white and a
purplebroid apron a crown of golden uraei with turquois ey
wa set upon her dark hair as in her statu and on her breast and arm
were the veri necklac and bracelet that he had taken from her tomb
she appear to be somewhat moodi or rather thought for she lean
by herself against a balustrad watch the throng without much
interest
present a pharaoh a blackbrow vigor man with thick lip drew
near
i greet your majesti he said
she start and answer oh it is you i make my obeis to your

of mockeri in her movement

other matter face to face in light and open as we were wont to do
when we were men then henc to thebe there to celebr our yearli
festiv is such your will
such is our will thei answer
it seem to smith that dens dark fell upon the place and with
it a silenc that wa aw for a time that he could not reckon that
might have been year or might have been moment he sat there in the
utter dark and the utter silenc
at length the light came again first as a blue spark then in upward
pour rai and lastli pervad all there stood mene on the step
and there in front of him wa gather the same royal throng
the mysteri ar finish said the old king now if ani have aught
to sai let it be said openli
a young man dress in the robe and ornament of an earli dynasti came
forward and stood upon the step between the pharaoh mene and all those
who had reign after him hi face seem familiar to smith as wa
the side lock that hung down behind hi right ear in token of hi youth
where had he seen him ah he rememb onli a few hour ago ly in
on of the case of the museum togeth with the bone of the pharaoh
una
your majesti he began i am the king metesuphi the matter that
i wish to lai befor you is that of the violat of our sepulchr by
those men who now live upon the earth the mortal bodi of mani who ar
gather here tonight lie in thi place to be stare at and mock
by the curiou i myself am on of them jawless broken hideou to
behold yonder dai by dai must my ka sit watch my desecr
flesh torn from the pyramid that with cost and labour i rais up to
be an etern hous wherein i might hide till the hour of resurrect
other of us lie in far land thu as he can tell you my predecessor
mankaura he who built the third of the great pyramid the pyramid of
her sleep or rather wake in a dark citi call london across the
sea a place of murk where no sun shine other have been burnt with
fire other ar scatter in small dust the ornament that were our
ar stole awai and sold to the greedi our sacr write and our
symbol ar their jest soon there will not be on holi grave in egypt
that remain undefil
that is so said a voic from the compani but four month gone the
deep deep pit wa open that i had dug in the shadow of the pyramid of
cephren who begat me in the world there in my chamber i slept alon
two hand of white bone sinc when i di thei did not preserv
the bodi with wrap and with spice now i see those bone of mine
besid which my doubl ha watch for these five thousand year hid in
the black of a great ship and toss on a sea that is strewn with
ic
it is so echo a hundr other voic
then went on the young king turn to mene i ask of your majesti
whether there is no mean wherebi we mai be aveng on those who do us
thi foul wrong
let him who ha wisdom speak said the old pharaoh
a man of middl ag short in statur and of a thought brow who held
in hi hand a wand and wore the feather and insignia of the heir to the
throne of egypt and of a high priest of amen move to the step smith
knew him at onc from hi statu he wa khaemua son of rames the
great the mightiest magician that ever wa in egypt who of hi own
will withdrew himself from earth befor the time came that he should sit
upon the throne
i have wisdom your majesti and i will answer he said the time
draw on when in the land of death which is life the land that we
call amenti it will be given to us to lai our wrong as to thi matter
befor those who judg know that thei will be aveng on thi night
of the year also when we resum the shape we were we have certain
power of vengeanc or rather of execut justic but our time is
short and there is much to sai and do befor the sungod ra aris
and we depart each to hi place therefor it seem best that we should
leav these wick on in their wicked till we meet them face to
face beyond the world
smith who had been follow the word of khaemua with the closest
attent and consider anxieti breath again thank heaven
that the engag of these depart monarch were so numer and
press still as a matter of precaut he drew the cigarbox which
contain mame hand from hi pocket and push it as far awai from
him as he could it wa a most unlucki act perhap the cigarbox grate
on the floor or perhap the fact of hi touch the relic put him into
psychic commun with all these spirit at ani rate he becam
awar that the ey of that dread magician were fix upon him and
that a bone had a better chanc of escap the search of a rontgen rai
than he of hide himself from their bale glare
as it happen howev went on khaemua in a cold voic i now
perceiv that there is hidden in thi place and spy on us on of
the worst of these vile thiev i sai to your majesti that i see him
crouch beneath yonder funer barg and that he ha with him at thi
moment the hand of on of your majesti stolen by him from her tomb at
thebe
now everi queen in the compani becam visibl agit smith who wa
watch mame saw her hold up her hand and look at them while all
the pharaoh point with their finger and exclaim togeth in a
voic that roll round the hall like thunder
let him be brought forth to judgment
khaemua rais hi wand and hold it toward the boat where smith
wa hidden said
draw near vile on bring with thee that thou hast stolen
smith tri hard to remain where he wa he sat himself down and set
hi heel against the floor as the reader know he wa alwai shy and
retir by disposit and never had these weak oppress him
more than thei did just then when a child hi favourit nightmar had
been that the foreman of a juri wa in the act of proclaim him
guilti of some dread but unstat crime now he understood what that
nightmar foreshadow he wa about to be convict in a court of
which all the king and queen of egypt were the juri mene wa
chief justic and the magician khaemua plai the role of
attorneygener
in vain did he sit down and hold fast some power took possess of him
which forc him first to stretch out hi arm and pick up the cigarbox
contain the hand of mame and next drew him from the friendli
shelter of the deal board that were about the boat
now he wa on hi feet and walk down the flight of step opposit to
those on which mene stood far awai now he wa among all that throng
of ghost which part to let him pass look at him as he went with
cold and wonder ey thei were veri majest ghost the ag that
had gone by sinc thei laid down their sceptr had taken noth from
their royal digniti moreov save on none of them seem to have ani
piti for hi plight she wa a littl princess who stood by her mother
that same littl princess whose mummi he had seen and piti in the
director room with a lotu flower thrust beneath her bandag as he
pass smith heard her sai
thi vile on is frighten be brave vile on
smith understood and pride came to hi aid he a gentleman of the
modern world would not show the white feather befor a crowd of ancient
egyptian ghost turn to the child he smile at her then drew
himself to hi full height and walk on quietli here it mai be
state that smith wa a tall man still compar young and veri
goodlook straight and spare in frame with dark pleasant ey and
a littl black beard
at least he is a wellfavour thief said on of the queen to
anoth
ye answer she who had been address i wonder that a man with
such a nobl air should find pleasur in disturb grave and steal
the offer of the dead word that gave smith much caus for
thought he had never consid the matter in thi light
now he came to the place where mame stood the blackbrow pharaoh
who had been her husband at her side on hi left hand which held the
cigarbox wa the gold be ring and that box he felt constrain to
carri press against him just over hi heart
as he went by he turn hi head and hi ey met those of mame she
start violent then she saw the ring upon hi hand and again start
still more violent
what ail your majesti ask the pharaoh
oh naught she answer yet doe thi earthdwel remind you of
anyon

pharaoh
then smith pass on and heard no more now he stood befor the
vener mene some instinct caus him to bow to thi pharaoh who
bow back to him then he turn and bow to the royal compani and
thei also bow back to him coldli but veri grave and courteous
dweller on the world where onc we had our place and therefor brother

violat our sepulchr and desecr our ash he declar moreov
that at thi veri moment you have with you a portion of the mortal flesh

in answer in the same sweet tongu
o king thei ar true and not true hear me ruler of egypt it is
true that i have search in your grave becaus my heart ha been
drawn toward you and i would learn all that i could concern you
for it come to me now that onc i wa on of youno king inde
yet perchanc of the blood of king alsofor i would hide noth even
if i couldi search for on tomb abov all other

becaus a face drew me a love face that wa cut in stone
now all that great audienc turn their ey toward him and listen
as though hi word move them
did you find that holi tomb ask mene if so what did you find
therein
ay pharaoh and in it i found these and he took from the box the
wither hand from hi pocket the broken bronz and from hi finger

place articl of jewelleri that i seem to see tonight upon on who is
present here among you
is the face of thi figur the face you sought ask the judg
it is the love face he answer
mene took the effigi in hi hand and read the cartouch that wa
engrav beneath it breast
if there be here among us he said present on who long after
my dai rule as queen in egypt on who wa name mame let her draw
near
now from where she stood glide mame and took her place opposit to
smith

garment he stand befor you horu or the doubl of horu he who cut
the imag when i rule in egypt is he who found the imag and the man
who stand befor you or mayhap hi doubl cast in the same mould
the pharaoh mene turn to the magician khaemua and said
ar these thing so o seer
thei ar so answer khaemua thi dweller on the earth is he who
long ago wa the sculptor horu but what shall that avail he onc
more a live man is a violat of the hallow dead i sai therefor
that judgment should be execut on hi flesh so that when the light
come here tomorrow he himself will again be gather to the dead
mene bent hi head upon hi breast and ponder smith said noth to
him the whole plai wa so curiou that he had no wish to interfer with
it develop if these ghost wish to make him of their number let
them do so he had no ti on earth and now when he knew full sure
that there wa a life beyond thi of earth he wa quit prepar to
explor it mysteri so he fold hi arm upon hi breast and await
the sentenc
but mame did not wait she rais her hand so swiftli that the
bracelet jingl on her wrist and spoke out with bold
royal khaemua princ and magician she said hearken to on who
like you wa egypt heir centuri befor you were born on also who
rule over the two land and not so illwhich princ never wa your
lot answer me is all wisdom centr in your breast answer me do you
alon know the mysteri of life and death answer me did your god amen
teach you that vengeanc went befor merci answer me did he teach
you that men should be judg unheard that thei should be hurri by
violenc to osiri er their time and therebi separ from the dead
on whom thei love and forc to return to live again upon thi evil
earth
listen when the last moon wa near her full my spirit sat in my tomb
in the buryingplac of queen my spirit saw thi man enter into my
tomb and what he did there with bow head he look upon my bone
that a thief of the priesthood had rob and burnt within twenti year
of their burial in which he himself had taken part and what did thi
man with those bone he who wa onc horu i tell you that he hid them
awai there in the tomb where he thought thei could not be found again
who then wa the thief and the violat he who rob and burnt my
bone or he who buri them with rever again he found the jewel
that the priest of your brotherhood had drop in hi flight when the
smoke of the burn flesh and spice overpow him and with them the
hand which that wick on had broken off from the bodi of my majesti
what did thi man then he took the jewel would you have had him leav
them to be stolen by some peasant and the hand i tell you that he
kiss that poor dead hand which onc had been part of the bodi of my
majesti and that now he treasur it as a holi relic my spirit saw
him do these thing and made report thereof to me i ask you therefor
princ i ask you all royalti of egyptwheth for such deed thi
man should die
now khaemua the advoc of vengeanc shrug hi shoulder and
smile meaningli but the congreg of king and queen thunder an
answer and it wa
no
mame look to mene to give judgment befor he could speak the
darkbrow pharaoh who had name her wife strode forward and address
them
her majesti heiress of egypt royal wife ladi of the two land ha
spoken he cri now let me speak who wa the husband of her majesti
whether thi man wa onc horu the sculptor i know not if so he wa
also an evildo who by my decre di in banish in the land
of kush whatev be the truth as to that matter he admit that he
violat the tomb of her majesti and stole what the old thiev had
left her majesti sai alsoand he doe not deni itthat he dare to
kiss her hand and for a man to kiss the hand of a wed queen of egypt
the punish is death i claim that thi man should die to the world
befor hi time that in a dai to come again he mai live and suffer in
the world judg o mene
mene lift hi head and spoke sai
repeat to me the law o pharaoh under which a live man must die
for the kiss of a dead hand in my dai and in that of those who went
befor me there wa no such law in egypt if a live man who wa not
her husband or of her kin kiss the live hand of a wed queen of
egypt save in ceremoni then perchanc he might be call upon to die
perchanc for such a reason a certain horu onc wa call upon to die
but in the grave there is no marriag and therefor even if he had
found her aliv within the tomb and kiss her hand or even her lip
why should he die for the crime of love
hear me all thi is my judgment in the matter let the soul of that
priest who first violat the tomb of the royal mame be hunt down
and given to the jaw of the destroy that he mai know the last depth
of death if so the god declar but let thi man go from among us
unharm sinc what he did he did in rever ignor and becaus
hathor goddess of love guid him from of old love rule thi world
wherein we meet tonight with all the world whenc we have gather
or whither we still must go who can defi it power who can refus it
rite now henc to thebe
there wa a rush sound as of a thousand wing and all were gone
no not all sinc smith yet stood befor the drape colossi and the
empti step and besid him gloriou unearthli gleam the vision of
mame
i too must awai she whisper yet er i go a word with you who
onc were a sculptor in egypt you love me then and that love cost you
your life you who onc dare to kiss thi hand of mine that again you
kiss in yonder tomb for i wa pharaoh wife in name onli understand
me well in name onli sinc that titl of royal mother which thei gave
me is but a graven lie horu i never wa a wife and when you di
swiftli i follow you to the grave oh you forget but i rememb
i rememb mani thing you think that the priestli thief broke thi
figur of me which you found in the sand outsid my tomb not so i
broke it becaus dare greatli you had written thereon belov
not of horu the god as you should have done but of horu the
man so when i came to be buri pharaoh know all took the imag
from my wrap and hurl it awai i rememb too the cast of
that imag and how you threw a gold chain i had given you into the
crucibl with the bronz sai that gold alon wa fit to fashion me
and thi signet that i bearit wa you who cut it take it take it
horu and in it place give me back that which is on your hand the be
ring that i also wore take it and wear it ever till you die again and
let it go to the grave with you as onc it went to the grave with me
now hearken when ra the great sun aris again and you awak you will
think that you have dream a dream you will think that in thi dream
you saw and spoke with a ladi of egypt who di more than three thousand
year ago but whose beauti carv in stone and bronz ha charm
your heart todai so let it be yet know o man who onc wa name
horu that such dream ar ofttim a shadow of the truth know that
thi glori which shine befor you is mine inde in the land that is
both far and near the land wherein i dwell etern and that what is
mine ha been is and shall be your for ever god mai chang their
kingdom and their name men mai live and die and live again onc more
to die empir mai fall and those who rule them be turn to forgotten
dust yet true love endur immort as the soul in which it wa
conceiv and from it for you and me the night of woe and separ
done at the daybreak which draw on there shall be born the splendour
and the peac of union till that hour foredoom seek me no more
though i be ever near you as i have ever been till that most bless
hour horu farewel
she bent toward him her sweet lip touch hi brow the perfum
from her breath and hair beat upon him the light of her wondrou ey
search out hi veri soul read the answer that wa written there
he stretch out hi arm to clasp her and lo she wa gone
it wa a veri cold and a veri stiff smith who awok on the follow
morn to find himself exactli where he had lain downnam on a
cement floor beneath the keel of a funer boat in the central hall of
the cairo museum he crept from hi shelter shiver and look at
thi hall to find it quit as empti as it had been on the previou
even not a sign or a token wa there of pharaoh mene and all those
king and queen of whom he had dream so vividli
reflect on the strang phantasi that weari and excit nerv
can summon to the mind in sleep smith made hi wai to the great door
and wait in the shadow prai earnestli that although it wa the
mohammedan sabbath someon might visit the museum to see that all wa
well
as a matter of fact someon did and befor he had been there a
minutea watchman go about hi busi he unlock the place
carelessli look over hi shoulder at a kite fight with two
nest crow in an instant smith who wa not mind to stop and
answer question had slip past him and wa glide down the portico
from monument to monument like a snake between boulder still keep
in the shadow as he head for the gate
the attend caught sight of him and utter a yell of fear then
sinc it is not good to look upon an afreet appear from whenc no
mortal man could be he turn hi head awai when he look again smith
wa through those gate and had mingl with the crowd in the street
beyond
the sunshin wa veri pleasant to on who wa consciou of have
contract a chill of the worst egyptian order from long contact with a
damp stone floor smith walk on through it toward hi hotelit wa
shepheard and more than a mile awaymak up a stori as he went
to tell the hallport of how he had gone to dine at mena hous by the
pyramid miss the last tram and stop the night there
whilst he wa thu engag hi left hand struck somewhat sharpli against
the corner of the cigarbox in hi pocket that which contain the
relic of the queen mame the pain caus him to glanc at hi finger
to see if thei were injur and to perceiv on on of them the ring he
wore sure sure it wa not the same that the directorgener had
given him that ring wa engrav with the imag of the god be
on thi wa cut the cartouch of her majesti mame and he had
dreamedoh he had dream
to thi dai smith is wonder whether in the hurri of the moment he
made a mistak as to which of those ring the directorgener had given
him as part of hi share of the spoil of the royal tomb he discov
in the vallei of queen afterward smith wrote to ask but the
directorgener could onli rememb that he gave him on of the two
ring and assur him that that inscrib be ank ank be wa
with mame other jewel in the gold room of the museum
also smith is wonder whether ani other bronz figur of an old
egyptian royalti show so high a percentag of gold as on analysi the
broken imag of mame wa prove to do for had she not seem to tell
him a tale of the melt of a golden chain when that effigi wa cast
wa it all onli a dream or wa itsometh morebi dai and by night
he ask of nothing
but be she near or far no answer come from the queen mame whose
proud titl were her majesti the good god the justifi dweller in
osiri daughter of amen royal heiress royal sister royal wife royal
mother ladi of the two land wearer of the doubl crown of the white
crown of the red crown sweet flower of love beauti etern
so like the rest of us smith must wait to learn the truth concern
mani thing and more particularli as to which of those two circl of
ancient gold the directorgener gave him yonder at cairo
it seem but a littl matter yet it is more than all the world to him
to the astonish of hi colleagu in antiquarian research smith ha
never return to egypt he explain to them that hi health is quit
restor and that he no longer need thi annual chang to a more
temper clime
now which of the two royal ring did the directorgener return to
smith on the mummi hand of her late majesti mame
magepa the buck
in a prefac to a stori of the earli life of the late allan quatermain
known in africa as macumazahn which ha been publish under the name
of mari mr curti the brother of sir henri curti tell of how
he found a number of manuscript that were left by mr quatermain in hi
hous in yorkshir of these mari wa on but in addit to it and
sundri other complet record i the editor to whom it wa direct
that these manuscript should be hand for public have found
a quantiti of unclassifi note and paper some of these deal with
matter that have to do with sport and game or with histor event
and some ar memoranda of incid connect with the career of the
writer or with remark occurr that he had wit of which he
doe not speak elsewher
on of these notesit is contain in a book much soil and worn that
evid it owner had carri about with him for yearsremind me of
a convers that i had with mr quatermain long ago when i wa hi
guest in yorkshir the note itself is short i think that he must have
jot it down within an hour or two of the event to which it refer it
run thu
i wonder whether in the land beyond ani recognit is grant
for act of great courag and unselfish devotiona kind of spiritu
victoria cross if so i think it ought to be accord to that poor old
savag magepa as it would be if i had ani voic in the matter upon my
word he ha made me feel proud of human and yet he wa noth but a
nigger as so mani call the kaffir
for a while i the editor wonder to what thi entri could allud
then of a sudden it all came back to me i saw myself as a young man
seat in the hall of quatermain hous on even after dinner with
me were sir henri curti and captain good we were smoke and the
convers had turn upon deed of heroism each of us detail such
act as he could rememb which had made the most impress on him
when we had finish old allan said
with your leav ill tell you a stori of what i think wa on of the
bravest thing i ever saw it happen at the begin of the zulu war
when the troop were march into zululand now at that time as you
know i wa turn an honest penni transportrid for the govern
or rather for the militari author i hire them three wagon with
the necessari voorloop and driver sixteen good salt oxen to each
wagon and myself in charg of the lot thei paid me well never mind
how muchi am rather asham to mention the amount the truth is that
the imperi offic bought in a dear market dure that zulu war
moreov thing were not alwai straight i could tell you stori of
folk not all of them coloni who got rich quicker than thei ought
commiss and that kind of thing but perhap these ar better
forgotten as for me i ask a good price for my wagon or rather for
the hire of them of a veri wellsatisfi young gentleman in uniform
who had been exactli three week in the countri and to my surpris
got it but when i went to those in command and warn them what would
happen if thei persist in their wai of advanc then in their pride
thei would not listen to the old hunter and transportrid but
polit bow me out if thei had there would have been no isandhlwana
disast
he brood awhil for as i knew thi wa a sore subject with him on
on which he would rare talk although he escap himself quatermain
had lost friend on that fatal field he went on
to return to old magepa i had known him for mani year the first time
we met wa in the battl of the tugela i wa fight for the king
son umbelazi the handsom in the rank of the tulwana regimenti mean
to write all that stori for it should not be lost well as i have told
you befor the tulwana were wipe out of the three thousand or so of
them i think onli about fifti remain aliv after thei had annihil
the three of cetewayo regiment that set upon them but as it chanc
magepa wa on who surviv
i met him afterward at old king panda kraal and recognis him
as have fought by my side whilst i wa talk to him the princ
cetewayo came by to me he wa civil enough for he knew how i chanc
to be in the battl but he glare at magepa and said
why macumazahn is not thi man on of the dog with which you tri
to bite me by the tugela not long ago he must be a cun dog also
on who can run fast for how come it that he live to snarl when so
mani will never bark again ow if i had my wai i would find a strip
of hide to fit hi neck
not so i answer he ha the king peac and he is a brave man
braver than i am anywai princ see that i ran from the rank of
the tulwana while he stood where he wa
you mean that your hors ran macumazahn well sinc you like thi
dog i will not hurt him and with a shrug he went hi wai
yet soon or late he will hurt me said magepa when the princ had
gone ucetewayo ha a memori long as the shadow thrown by a tree at
sunset moreov as he know well it is true that i ran macumazahn
though not till all wa finish and i could do no more by stand
still you rememb how after we had eaten up the first of cetewayo
regiment the second charg us and we at that up also well in that
fight i got a tap on the head from a kerri it struck me on my man
ring which i had just put on for i think i wa the youngest soldier in
that regiment of veteran the ring save me still for a while i lost
my mind and lai like on dead when i found it again the fight wa over
and cetewayo peopl were search for our wound that thei might
kill them present thei found me and saw that there wa no hurt on me
here is on who sham dead like a stinkcat said a big fellow
lift hi spear
then it wa that i sprang up and ran who wa but just marri and
desir to live he struck at me but i jump over the spear and
the other that thei threw miss me then thei began to hunt me but
macumazahn i who am name the buck becaus i am swifter of foot than
ani man in zululand outpac them all and got awai safe
well done magepa i said still rememb the sai of your
peopl at last the strong swimmer goe with the stream and the swift
runner is run down
i know it macumazahn he answer with a nod and perhap in a dai
to come i shall know it better
i took littl heed of hi word at the time but more than thirti year
afterward i rememb them
such wa my first acquaint with magepa now friend i will tell
you how it wa renew at the time of the zulu war
as you know i wa attach to the centr column that advanc into
zululand by rork drift on the buffalo river befor war wa declar
or at ani rate befor the advanc began while it might have been and
mani thought it would be avert i wa emploi transportrid
good to the littl rork drift station that which becam so famou
afterward and incident in collect what inform i could of
cetewayo intent hear that there wa a kraal a mile or so
the other side of the river of which the peopl were said to be veri
friendli to the english i determin to visit it you mai think thi
wa rash but i wa so well known in zululand where for mani year
by special leav of the king i wa allow to go whither i would quit
unmolest and inde under the royal protect that i felt no fear
for myself so long as i went alon
accordingli on even i cross the drift and head for a kloof in
which i wa told the kraal stood ten minut ride brought me in sight
of it it wa not a larg kraal there mai have been six or eight hut
and a cattl enclosur surround by the usual fenc the situat
howev wa veri pretti a knoll of rise ground back by the wood
slope of the kloof as i approach i saw women and children run
to the kraal to hide and when i reach the gatewai for some time
no on would come out to meet me at length a small boi appear who
inform me that the kraal wa empti as a gourd
quit so i answer still go and tell the headman that macumazahn
wish to speak with him
the boi depart and present i saw a face that seem familiar to
me peep round the edg of the gatewai after a care inspect it
owner emerg
he wa a tall thin man of indefinit ag perhap between sixti and
seventi with a finelycut face a littl grei beard kind ey and veri
wellshap hand and feet the finger which twitch incessantli
be remark long
greet macumazahn he said i see you do not rememb me well
think of the battl of the tugela and of the last stand of the tulwana
and of a certain talk at the kraal of our fatherwhoisdead that is
king panda and of how he who sit in hi place he meant cetewayo
told you that if he had hi wai he would find a hide rope to fit the
neck of a certain on
ah i said i know you now you ar magepa the buck so the runner
ha not yet been run down
no macumazahn not yet but there is still time i think that mani
swift feet will be at work er long
how have you prosper i ask him
well enough macumazahn in all wai except on i have three wive
but my children have been few and ar dead except on daughter who is
marri and live with me for her husband too is dead he wa kill
by a buffalo and she ha not yet marri again but enter and see
so i went in and saw magepa wive old women all of them also at
hi bid hi daughter whose name wa gita brought me some maa
or curdl milk to drink she wa a wellform woman veri like
her father but sadfac perhap with a prescienc of evil to come
cling to her finger wa a beauti boi of someth under two year
of ag who when he saw magepa ran to him and threw hi littl arm
about hi leg the old man lift the child and kiss him tenderli
sai
it is well that thi toddler and i should love on anoth
macumazahn see that he is the last of my race all the other
children here ar those of the peopl who have come to live in my
shadow
where ar their father i ask pat the littl boi who hi
mother told me wa name sinala upon the cheek an attent that he
resent
thei have been call awai on duti answer magepa shortli and i
chang the subject
then we began to talk about old time and i ask him if he had ani
oxen to sell sai that thi wa my reason for visit the kraal
nai macumazahn he answer in a mean voic thi year all the
cattl ar the king
i nod and repli that as it wa so i had better be go
whereon as i half expect magepa announc that he would see me safe
to the drift so i bade farewel to the wive and the widow daughter
and we start
as soon as we were clear of the kraal magepa began to open hi heart to
me
macumazahn he said look up at me earnestli for i wa mount
and he walk besid my hors there is to be war cetewayo will not
consent to the demand of the great white chief from the capeh
meant sir bartl frereh will fight with the english onli he will
let them begin the fight he will draw them on into zululand and then
overwhelm them with hi impi and stamp them flat and eat them up and
i who love the english am veri sorri ye it make my heart bleed
if it were the boer now i should be glad for we zulu hate the boer
but the english we do not hate even cetewayo like them still he will
eat them up if thei attack him
inde i answer and then as in duti bound i proceed to get what
i could out of him and that wa not a littl of cours howev i did
not swallow it all sinc that i suspect that magepa wa feed me
with new that he had been order to dissemin
present we came to the mouth of the kloof in which the kraal stood
and here for greater conveni of convers we halt for i
thought it as well that we should not be seen in close talk on the open
plain beyond the path here i should add ran past a clump of green
bush i rememb thei bore a white flower that smelt sweet and were
back by some tall grass elephantgrass i think it wa among which
grew mimosa tree
magepa i said if in truth there is to be fight why dont you
move over the river on night with your peopl and cattl and get into
natal
i would if i could macumazahn who have no stomach for thi war
against the english but there i should not be safe sinc present the
king will come into natal too or send thirti thousand assegai as hi
messeng then what will happen to those who have left him
oh if you think that i answer laugh you had better stai
where you ar
also macumazahn the husband of those women at my kraal have been
call up to their regiment and if their wive fled to the english thei
would be kill again the king ha sent for nearli all our cattl to
keep them safe he fear lest we border zulu might join our peopl in
natal and that is why he is keep our cattl safe
life is more than cattl magepa at least you might come
what and leav my peopl to be kill macumazahn you did not us
to talk so still hearken macumazahn will you do me a servic i will
pai you well for it i would get my daughter gita and my littl grandson
sinala into safeti if i and my wive ar wipe out it doe not matter
for we ar old but her i would save and the boi i would save so
that on mai live who will rememb my name now if i were to send them
across the drift sai at the dawn not tomorrow and not the next dai
but the dai after would you receiv them into your wagon and deliv
them safe to some place in natal i have monei hidden fifti piec of
gold and you mai take half of these and also half of the cattl if ever
i live to get them back out of the keep of the king
never mind about the monei and we will speak of the cattl
afterward i said i understand that you wish to send your daughter
and your littl grandson out of danger and i think you wise veri wise
when onc the advanc begin if there is an advanc who know what mai
happen war is a rough game magepa it is not the custom of you black
peopl to spare women and children and there will be zulu fight on
our side as well as on your do you understand
ow i understand macumazahn i have known the face of war and seen
mani a littl on like my grandson sinala assegai upon hi mother
back
veri good but if i do thi for you you must do someth for me
sai magepa doe cetewayo realli mean to fight and if so how oh
ye i know all you have been tell me but i want not word but truth
from the heart
you ask secret said the old fellow peer about him into the
gather gloom still a spear for a spear and a shield for a
shield as our sai run i have spoken no lie the king doe mean
to fight not becaus he want to but becaus the regiment swear that
thei will wash their assegai thei who have never seen blood sinc that
battl of the tugela in which we two plai a part and if he will not
suffer it well there ar more of hi race also he mean to fight
thu and he gave me some veri us inform that is inform
which would have been us if those in author had deign to pai
ani attent to it when i pass it on
just as he had finish speak i thought that i heard a sound in the
dens green bush behind us it remind me of the nois a man make
when he tri to stifl a cough and frighten me for if we had been
overheard by a spy magepa wa as good as dead and the sooner i wa
across the river the better
what that i ask
a bush buck macumazahn there ar lot of them about here
not be satisfi though it is true that buck do cough like thi
i turn my hors to the bush seek an open thereon someth
crash awai and vanish into the long grass in those shadow of
cours i could not see what it wa but such light as remain glint
on what might have been the polish tip of the horn of an antelop
oran assegai
i told you it wa a buck macumazahn said magepa still if you
smell danger let us come awai from the bush though the order ar that
no white man is to be touch as yet
then while we walk on toward the ford he set out with great
detail as kaffir do the exact arrang that he propos to make
for the hand over of hi daughter and her child into my care i
rememb that i ask him why he would not send her on the follow
morn instead of two morn later he answer becaus he expect
an outpost of scout from on of the regiment at hi kraal that night
who would probabl remain there over the morrow and perhap longer
while thei were in the place it would be difficult if not imposs
for him to send awai gita and her son without excit suspicion
near the drift we part and i return to our provision camp and
wrote a beauti report of all that i had learn of which report i
mai add no on took the slightest notic
i think it wa the morn befor that whereon i had arrang to meet
gita and the littl boi at the drift that just about dawn i went down to
the river for a wash have taken my dip i climb on to a flat rock
to dress myself and look at the billow of beauti pearli mist
which hid the face of the water and consideredi almost said listen
toth great silenc for as yet no live thing wa stir
ah if i had known of the hideou sight and sound that were destin
to be heard er long in thi same haunt of perfect peac inde at
that moment there came a kind of hint or premonit of them sinc
suddenli through the utter quiet broke the bloodcurdl wail of
a woman it wa follow by other wail and shout distant and yet
distinct then the silenc fell again
now i thought to myself that nois might veri well have come from old
magepa kraal luckili howev sound ar decept in mist
well the end of it wa that i wait there till the sun rose the
first thing on which it bright beam struck wa a mighti column of
smoke rise to heaven from where magepa kraal had stood
i went back to my wagon veri sadso sad that i could scarc eat my
breakfast while i walk i wonder hard whether the light had glint
upon the tip of a buck horn in that patch of green bush with the
sweetsmel white flower a night or two ago or had it perchanc
fallen upon the point of the assegai of some spy who wa watch my
movement in that event yonder column of smoke and the horribl cri
that preced it were easi to explain for had not magepa and i talk
secret togeth and in zulu
on the follow morn at dawn i attend at the drift in the faint
hope that gita and her boi might arriv there as arrang but nobodi
came which wa not wonder see that gita lai dead stab
through and through as i saw afterward she made a good fight for
the child and that her spirit had gone to wherev go the soul of the
braveheart be thei white or black onli on the farther bank of the
river i saw some zulu scout who seem to know my errand for thei
call to me ask mockingli where wa the pretti woman i had come to
meet
after that i tri to put the matter out of my head which inde wa
full enough of other thing sinc now definit order had arriv as to
the advanc and with these mani troop and offic
it wa just then that the zulu began to fire across the river at such
of our peopl as thei saw upon the bank at these thei took aim and
as a result hit nobodi a raw kaffir with a rifl in my experi is
onli danger when he aim at noth for then the bullet look after
itself and mai catch you to put a stop to thi nuisanc a regiment of
the friendli nativesther mai have been sever hundr of themwa
direct to cross the river and clear the kloof and rock of the zulu
skirmish who were hidden among them i watch them go off in fine
style and in the cours of the afternoon heard a good deal of shout
and bang of gun on the farther side of the river
toward even someon told me that our impi as he call it
grandiloqu wa return victori have at the moment noth
els to do i walk down to the river at a point where the water wa
deep and the bank were high here i climb to the top of a pile of
boulder whenc with my fieldglass i could sweep a great extent of
plain which stretch awai on the zululand side till at length it merg
into hill and bush
present i saw some of our nativ march homeward in a scatter
and disorganis fashion but evid veri proud of themselv for
thei were wave their assegai and sing scrap of warsong a few
minut later a mile or more awai i caught sight of a man run
watch him through the glass i note three thing first that
he wa tall secondli that he ran with extraordinari swift and
thirdli that he had someth ti upon hi back it wa evid
further that he had good reason to run sinc he wa be hunt by
a number of our kaffir of whom more and more continu join the
chase from everi side thei pour down upon him try to cut him off
and kill him for as thei got nearer i could see the assegai which thei
threw at him flash in the sunlight
veri soon i understood that the man wa run with a definit object
and to a definit point he wa try to reach the river i thought the
sight veri piti thi on poor creatur be hunt to death by so
mani also i wonder why he did not free himself from the bundl on
hi back and came to the conclus that he must be a witchdoctor and
that the bundl contain hi preciou charm or medicin
thi wa while he wa yet a long wai off but when he came nearer
within three or four hundr yard of a sudden i caught the outlin of
hi face against a good background and knew it for that of magepa
my god i said to myself it is old magepa the buck and the bundl
in the mat will be hi grandson sinala
ye even then i felt certain that he wa carri the child upon hi
back
what wa i to do it wa imposs for me to cross the river at
that place and long befor i could get round by the ford all would be
finish i stood up on my rock and shout to those brute of kaffir
to let the man alon thei were so excit that thei did not hear
my word at least thei swore afterward that thei thought i wa
encourag them to hunt him down
but magepa heard me at the moment he seem to be fail but the
sight of me appear to give him fresh strength he gather himself
togeth and leapt forward at a realli surpris speed now the river
wa not more than three hundr yard awai from him and for the first
two hundr of these he quit outdistanc hi pursuer although thei
were most of them young men and compar fresh then onc more hi
strength began to fail
watch through the glass i could see that hi mouth wa wide open
and that there wa red foam upon hi lip the burden on hi back wa
drag him down onc he lift hi hand as though to loos it then
with a wild gestur let them fall again
two of the pursuer who had outpac the other crept up to himlank
lean men of not more than thirti year of ag thei had stab spear
in their hand such as ar us at close quarter and these of cours
thei did not throw on of them gain a littl on the other
now magepa wa not more than fifti yard from the bank with the first
hunter about ten pace behind him and come up rapidli magepa glanc
over hi shoulder and saw then put out hi last strength for forti
yard he went like an arrow run straight awai from hi pursuer
until he wa within a few feet of the bank when he stumbl and fell
he done i said and upon my word if i had had a rifl in my hand
i think i would have stop on or both of those bloodhound and taken
the consequ
but no just as the first man lift hi broad spear to stab him
through the back on which the bundl lai magepa leapt up and wheel
round to take the thrust in the chest evid he did not wish to be
spear in the backfor a certain reason he took it sure enough for
the assegai wa wrench out of the hand of the striker still as he
wa reel backward it did not go through magepa or perhap it hit a
bone he drew out the spear and threw it at the man wound him then
he stagger on back and back to the edg of the littl cliff
it wa reach at last with a cry of help me macumazahn magepa
turn and befor the other man could spear him leapt straight into
the deep water he rose ye the brave old fellow rose and struck out
for the other bank leav a littl line of red behind him
i rush or rather sprang and roll down to the edg of the stream to
where a point of shingl ran out into the water along thi i clamber
and beyond it up to my middl now magepa wa be swept past me i
caught hi outstretch hand and pull him ashor
the boi he gasp the boi is he dead
i sever the lash of the mat that had cut right into the old
fellow shoulder insid of it wa littl sinala splutter out
water but veri evid aliv and unhurt for present he set up a
yell
no i said he live and will live
then all is well macumazahn a paus it wa a spy in the
bush not a buck he overheard our talk the king slayer came gita
held the door of the hut while i took the child cut a hole through the
straw with my assegai and crept out at the back she wa full of spear
befor she di but i got awai with the boi till your kaffir found
me i lai hid in the bush hope to escap to natal then i ran for the
river and saw you on the farther bank i might have got awai but
that child is heavi a paus give him food macumazahn he must
be hungri a paus farewel that wa a good sai of yoursth
swift runner is outrun at last ah yet i did not run in vain
anoth paus the last then he lift himself upon on arm and
with the other salut first the boi sinala and next me mutter
rememb your promis macumazahn
that is how magepa the buck di i never saw anyon carri weight
who could run quit so well as he and quatermain turn hi head awai
as though the memori of thi incid affect him somewhat
what becam of the child sinala i ask present
oh i sent him to an institut in natal and afterward wa abl
to get some of hi properti back for him i believ that he is be
train as an interpret

i
in hi regiment familiarli thei call him bottl nobodi quit knew
why it wa howev rumour that he had been call bottl at
harrow on account of the shape of hi nose not that hi nose wa
particularli like a bottl but at the end of it wa round and larg and
thick in realiti howev the sobriquet wa more ancient than that
for it had belong to the hero of thi stori from babyhood now when
a man ha a nicknam it gener impli two thing first that he is
goodtemp and secondli that he is a good fellow bottl alia
john georg peritt of a regiment it is unnecessari to name ampli
justifi both these definit for a kindliertemp or better
fellow never breath but unless a thick round nose a pair of small
lightcolour ey set under bushi brow and a larg but not badli
shape mouth can be said to constitut beauti he wa not beauti
on the other hand howev he wa big and wellform and a
pleasantmann if a rather silent companion
mani year ago bottl wa in love all the regiment knew it he wa so
veri palpabl and complet in love over hi bed in hi tidi quarter
hung the photograph of a young ladi who wa known to be the young

bottl did not go to bed till late that night long after sir eustac
who alwai care of hi health never stop up late if he could
avoid ithad vanish yawn hi brother sat smoke pipe after pipe
and think he had sat mani time in the same wai on a wagonbox in
the african veld or up where the moonlight turn the fall of the
zambesi into a rush cataract of silver or alon in hi tent when all
the camp wa sleep round him it wa a habit of thi queer silent
man to sit and think for hour at night and aros to a great
extent from an incapac to sleep that wa the weak point in hi
constitut
as for hi medit thei were variou but mostli the outcom of a
curiou specul side to hi natur which he never reveal to the
outsid world dream of a happi of which heretofor hi hard life
had given him no glimps semimyst religi medit upon
the great unknown around us and grand scheme for the regener of
mankindal form part of them
but there wa on central thought the fix star of hi mind round
which all the other continu revolv take their light and colour
from it and that wa the thought of madelin croston the woman to whom
he had been engag year and year had pass sinc he had seen
her face and yet it wa alwai present to him beyond the occasion
mention of her name in some societi papersever of which by the
wai he took in for year and conscienti search on the chanc
of find ittil thi even he had never even seen it or heard
it spoken and yet with all the tenac of hi strong deep natur he
clung to her dear memori that she had left him to marri anoth man
weigh as noth in the balanc of hi love onc she had love
him and therebi he wa repaid for the devot of hi life he had
no ambit madelin had been hi great ambit and when that had
fallen all the other had fallen with it even to the dust he simpli
did hi duti whatev it might be as well as in him lai without fear
of blame or hope of praiseshun men and never if he could avoid
it speak to a woman content to earn hi livelihood and for the
rest render colourless by hi secret and pathet passion
and now it appear that madelin wa a widow which meantand hi
heart beat fast at the thoughtthat she wa a free woman madelin wa
a free woman and he wa within a few minut walk of her no thousand
of mile of ocean roll between them now he rose went to the tabl
and consult a red book that lai on it there wa the addressa hous
in grosvenor street overcom by an uncontrol impuls he went out
of the room go to hi own he found hi mackintosh and a round hat
and softli left the hous it wa then past two in the morn pour
with rain and blow hard
he had been a littl in london as a lad and rememb the main
thoroughfar so had no great difficulti in find hi wai up
piccadilli till he came to park lane into which the red book told him
grosvenor squar open but to find grosvenor street itself wa a more
difficult matter and at such a time on such a night there wa natur
nobodi to askleast of all a policeman at last he found it and
hurri on down the street with a quicken puls what he wa hurri
to he could not tell but that overmast impuls forc him on
quicker and quicker yet
suddenli he halt and examin the number of on of the hous by the
faint and struggl light from the nearest lamp it wa her hous
now there wa noth between them but a few feet of space and fourteen
inch of brickwork he cross over to the other side of the street
and look up at the hous but could scarc make it out through the
drive rain there wa no light in the hous and no sign of life about
the street but there were both light and life in the heart of thi
watcher all the puls of hi blood were astir keep time with the
commot of hi mind he stood there in the shadow gaze at the murki
hous heedless of the bitter wind and pelt rain and felt hi life
and spirit pass out of hi control into an unknown dominion the storm
that rage around him wa noth to the convuls of hi inner self in
that hour of mad which wa yet happi yet as it had arisen thu
suddenli so with equal swift it di awai and left him stand
there with a chill sens of folli in hi mind and of the bitter weather
in hi bodi for on such a night a mackintosh and a dress coat were not
adapt to keep the most ardent lover warm he shiver and turn
made hi wai back to albani feel heartili asham of himself and
hi midnight expedit and heartili glad that no on knew of it except
himself
on the follow dai bottlesfor conveni sake we still call him
by hi old nicknamewa oblig to see a lawyer with refer to the
monei which he had inherit and to search for a box which had gone
astrai aboard the steamer also to bui a tall hat such as he had not
worn for fourteen year so that between on thing and anoth it wa
halfpast four befor he got back to the albani here he don the new
hat which did not fit veri well and a new black coat which fit
so well that it seem to cut into hi larg frame in everi possibl
direct and depart furious struggl with a pair of glove
also new for grosvenor street
a quarter of an hour walk for he knew the road thi time brought him
to the hous glanc for a while at the spot where he had stood on the
previou night he walk up the step and pull the bell though
he look bold enough outwardlyinde rather impos than
otherwisewith hi broad shoulder and the great scar on hi bronz
face hi breast wa full of terror in these howev he had not
much time to indulg for a footman still deck in the trap of
vicari grief open the door with the most startl promptitud
and he wa usher upstair into a small but richli furnish room
madelin wa not in the room though to judg from the lace handkerchief
ly on the floor by a low chair and the open novel on a littl wicker
tabl alongsid she had not left it long the footman depart sai
in a magnific underton that her ladyship should be inform and
left our hero to enjoi hi sensat be on of those peopl whom
suspens of ani sort make fidgeti he emploi himself in look at
the pictur and china even go so far as to walk to a pair of veri
heavi blue velvet curtain that appar commun with anoth
room and peep through them at a much larger apart of which the
furnitur wa done up in ghostlylook bag
retreat from thi melancholi sight final he took up a posit
on the hearthrug and wait would she be angri with him for come he
wonder would it recal thing she had rather forget but perhap she
had alreadi forgotten themit wa so long ago would she be veri much
chang perhap he should not know her perhapsbut here he happen
to lift hi ey and there stand between the two blue velvet
curtain wa madelin now a woman in the full splendour of a
remark beauti and show as yet at ani rate in that dull novemb
twilight no trace of her year there she stood her larg dark ey
fix upon him with a look of wist curios her shape lip just
part to speak and her bosom gentli heav as though with troubl
poor bottl on look wa enough there wa no chanc of hi attain
the bless haven of disillusion in five second he wa farther
out to sea than ever when she knew that he had seen her she drop her
ey a littleh saw the long curv lash appear against her cheek
and move forward
how do you do she said softli extend her slim cool hand
he took the hand and shook it but for the life of him could think of
noth to sai not on of the littl speech he had prepar would
come into hi mind yet the desper necess of sai someth
forc itself upon him
how do you do he ejacul with a jerk itit veri cold isnt

thi remark wa such an utter and ludicr fiasco that ladi croston
could not choos but laugh a littl

he shift hi leg uneasili consid the fact of the case her
dream frighten him which wa not strang fortun at that moment
the impress footman arriv with the teath and ask whether he
should light the lamp
no said ladi croston put some wood on the fire she knew that she
look her veri best in those halflight
then when she had given him hi tea delight him by rememb that
he did not like sugar she fell to draw him out about the wild life
he had been lead
by the wai she said present perhap you can tell mea few dai
ago i bought a book for my boysh had two childrenal about brave
deed and that sort of thing and in it there wa a stori of a volunt
offic in south africa the name wa not mention which interest
me veri much did you ever hear of it it wa thi the offic wa in
command of a fort contain a forc that wa oper against a nativ
chief while he wa awai the chief sent a flag of truce down to the
fort which wa fire on by some of the volunt in the fort becaus
there wa a man among the truce parti against whom thei had a spite
just afterward the offic return and wa veri angri that such a
thing had been done by englishmen whose duti it wa he said to teach
all the world what honour meant
now come the brave part of the stori without sai ani more
and notwithstand the entreati of hi men who knew that in all
probabl he wa go to a death by tortur for he wa so brave that
the nativ had set a great price upon him wish to kill him and us
hi bodi for medicin which thei thought would make them as brave as
he wa that offic rode out far awai into the mountain with onli
an interpret and a white handkerchief till he came to the chief
stronghold but when the nativ saw him come hold up hi white
handkerchief thei did not fire at him as hi men had fire at them
becaus thei were so astonish at hi braveri that thei thought he
must be mad or inspir so he came straight on to the wall of the
stronghold call to the chief and beg hi pardon for what had
happen and then rode awai again unharm shortli afterward the
chief have captur some of the offic volunt whom in the
ordinari cours of affair he would have tortur to death sent them
back again untouch with a messag to the effect that he would show
the english offic that he wa not the onli man who could behav like
a gentleman i should like to know that man do you know who he wa
bottl look uncomfort as well he might for it wa an incid
in hi own career but her prais and enthusiasm sent a flush of pride
into hi face
i believ it wa some fellow in the basuto war he said prevar
with peculiar awkward
oh then it is a true stori
yesthat is it is partial true there wa noth heroic about it
it wa a necessari act if our honour as fair oppon wa to continu
to be worth anyth
but who wa the man she ask fix her dark ey on him
suspici
the man he stammer oh the manwel in short and he
stop
in short georg she put in for the first time call him by hi
christian name that man wa you and i am so proud of you georg
it wa veri hate to him in a wai for he loath that kind of
person adul even from her he wa so intens modest he had
never even report the incid in question it had come out in some
roundabout wai yet he could not but feel happi that she had found him
out it wa a great deal to him to have move her and her sparkl
ey and heav bosom show that she wa somewhat move
he look up and hi ey caught her the room wa nearli dark now but
the bright flame from the wood the servant had put on the fire plai
upon her face hi ey caught her and there wa a look in them from
which he could not escap even if he had wish to do so she had
thrown her head back so that the coronet of her glossi hair rest upon
the back of her low seat and thu without strain could look straight
up into hi face he had risen and wa stand by the mantelpiec a
slow sweet smile grew upon the perfect face and the dark ey becam
soft and lumin as though thei shone through tear
in anoth second it had end as she thought that it would end and had
intend that it should end the great strong man wa downy down
on hi knee befor her on trembl hand catch at the arm of
her chair and the other clasp her taper finger there wa no
hesit or awkward about him now the great of hi longpent
passion inspir him and he told her all without let or stopal that
he had suffer for her sake throughout those lone year all hi
wretch hopeless keep noth back
much she did not understand such a passion as thi wa too deep to
be fathom by her shallow line too soar for her to net in her
worldstraiten imagin onc or twice even hi exalt notion
made her smile it seem ridicul know the world as she did that
ani man should think thu of ani woman nor when at length he had
finish did she attempt an answer feel that her strength lai in
silenc for she had a poor case at least the onli argument that she
us wa a pure feminin on but perfectli effect she bent her
beauti face toward him and he kiss it again and again
iv
the revuls of feel experienc by bottl as he hurri back to
the albani to dress for dinnerfor he wa to dine with hi brother at
on of hi club that nightwa so extraordinari and overwhelm that
it took him figur speak off hi leg as yet hi mind so
long accustom to perpetu misfortun in thi the rule passion of
hi life could not quit grasp hi luck that he should after all
have won back hi lost madelin seem altogeth too good to be true
as it happen sir eustac had ask on or two men to meet him
amongst them an undersecretari for the coloni who have to prepar
for a sever crossexamin in the hous upon south african affair
had jump at the opportun of suck the brain of a man thoroughli
acquaint with the subject but the expect undersecretari wa
destin to meet with a grievou disappoint for out of bottl
came no good thing for the most part of the dinner he sat silent onli
speak when directli address and then answer so much at random
that the undersecretari quickli came to the conclus that sir
eustac brother wa either a fool or that he had drunk too much
sir eustac himself saw that hi brother taciturn had spoilt hi
littl dinner and hi temper wa not improv therebi he wa not
accustom to have hi dinner spoil and felt that so far as the
undersecretari wa concern he had put himself into a fals posit
my dear georg he said in a tone of bland exasper when thei had
got back to the albani i wonder what can be the matter with you i
told atherleigh that you would be abl to post him up thoroughli about
all thi bechuana mess and he could not get a word out of you
hi brother absent fill hi pipe befor he answer
the bechuana oh ye i know all about them i live among them for a
year
then why on earth didnt you tell him what you knew you put me in
rather a fals posit
i am veri sorri eustac he answer humbl i will go and see him
if you like and explain the thing to him tomorrow the fact of the
matter is i wa think of someth els
sir eustac interrog him with a look
i wa think he went on slowli about madabout ladi croston
oh
i went to see her thi afternoon and i think i hope that i am go
to marri her
if bottl expect that thi great new would be receiv by hi
elder brother as such new ought to be receivedwith congratulatori
rejoicingh wa destin to be disappoint
good heaven ejacul sir eustac shortli let hi eyeglass
drop
why do you sai that eustac bottl ask uneasili
becausebecaus answer hi brother in the emphat tone which wa
hi equival for strong languag you must be mad to think of such a
thing
why must i be mad
becaus you still a young man with all your life befor you
deliber propos to tie yourself up to a middleag and passe
womansh is extrem passe by daylight let me tell youwho
ha alreadi treat you like a dog and is burden with a coupl of
children and who if she marri again will bring you veri littl
except her luxuri tast but i expect thi i thought she would
try to catch you with those languish black ey of her you ar not
the first i know her of old
if said hi brother rise in dudgeon you ar go to abus
madelin to me i think i had better sai good night for we shall
quarrelwhich i would not do for anyth
sir eustac shrug hi shoulder those whom the god wish to destroi
thei first make mad he mutter as he lit hi hand candl thi is
what come of a cours of south africa
but sir eustac wa an amen man hi favourit motto wa live and
let live and have given the matter hi best consider dure the
lengthi process of shave himself on the follow morn he came to
the conclus reluctantli enough it must be own that it wa evid
that hi brother meant to have hi own wai and therefor the best thing
to be done wa to fall in with hi view and trust to the chapter
of accid to bring the thing to naught sir eustac for all hi
appar worldli and cynic wa a good fellow at heart and
cherish a warm affect for hi awkward taciturn brother he
also cherish a great dislik for ladi croston whose charact he
thoroughli understood he saw a good deal of her it is true becaus he
happen to be on of the executor of her husband will and sinc he
had come into the baronetci it had struck him that she had develop a
consider partial for hi societi
the idea of a marriag between hi brother and hi brother old flame
wa in everi wai distast to him in the first place under her
husband will madelin would bring compar speak rel
littl with her should she marri again that wa on object anoth
and still more forcibl on from sir eustac point of view wa that
at her time of life she wa not like to present the hous of peritt
with an heir now sir eustac had not the slightest intent of
marri matrimoni wa he consid an excel institut and
necessari to the carri on of the world in a respect manner but
it wa not on with which he wa anxiou to identifi himself therefor
if hi brother marri at all it wa hi earnest desir that the union
should bring children to inherit the titl and estat promin abov
both these excel reason stood hi intens distrust and dislik of
the ladi
need must howev when the devil by whom he understood madelin
drive he wa not go to quarrel with hi onli brother and
presumpt heir becaus he chose to marri a woman who wa not to hi
tast so he shrug hi shouldershav finish hi shave and hi
reflect togetherand determin to put the best possibl face on
hi disappoint
well georg he said to hi brother at breakfast so you ar go
to marri ladi croston
bottl look up surpris ye eustac he answer if she will
marri me
sir eustac glanc at him i thought the affair wa settl he said
bottl rub hi big nose reflect as he answer well no
i dont think that marriag wa mention but i suppos she mean to
marri me in short i dont see how she could mean anyth els
sir eustac breath more freeli guess what had taken place so
there wa as yet no actual engag
when ar you go to see her again
tomorrow she is engag all todai
hi brother took out a pocketbook and consult it then i am more
fortun than you ar he said i have an appoint with ladi
croston thi even after dinner dont look jealou old fellow it is
onli about some executor busi i think i told you that i am on
of her husband executor bless on hi memori she is a peculiar
woman your inamorata and swear that she wont trust her lawyer so
i have to do all the dirti work myself wors luck you had better come
too
shant i be in the wai ask bottl doubtfulli struggl feebli
against the bribe
it is evid my dear fellow that you cannot be de trop i shall
present my paper for signatur and vanish you ought to be infinit
oblig to me for give you such a chanc we will consid that
settl we will dine togeth and go round to grosvenor street
afterward
bottl agre could he have seen the littl scheme that wa dawn in
hi brother brain perhap he would not have assent so readili
when her old lover went awai reluctantli to dress for dinner on the
previou dai madelin croston sat down to have a good think and the
result wa not entir satisfactori it had been veri pleasant to
see him and hi passion declar of endur love thrill her
through and through and even woke an echo in her own breast it made
her proud to think that thi man who notwithstand hi ugli and
awkward wa yet her instinct told her worth half a dozen smart
london fashion still love her and had never ceas to love her
poor bottl she had been veri fond of him onc thei had grown up
togeth and it realli gave her some cruel hour when a sens of what
she ow to herself and her famili had forc her to discard him
she rememb as she sat there thi even how at the time she had
wonder if it wa worth itif life would not be brighter and happier
if she made up her mind to fight through it by her honest lover side
well she could answer that question now it had been well worth it she
had not like her husband it is true but on the whole she had enjoi
a good time and plenti of monei and the power that monei bring the
wisdom of her later dai had confirm the judgment of her youth as
regard bottl himself she had soon got over that fanci for year
she had scarc thought of him till sir eustac told her that he wa
come home and she had that curiou dream about him now he had come
and made love to her not in a civilis philand sort of a wai
such as she wa accustom to but with a passion and a fire and an
utter selfabandon which while it thrill her nerv with a
curiou sensat of mingl pleasur and pain not unlik that she onc
experienc at a spanish bullfight when she saw a man toss wa yet
extrem awkward to deal with and rather alarm
now too the old question had come up again and what wa to be done
she had sheer him off the question that afternoon but he would want
to marri her she felt sure of that if she consent what were thei to
live on her own junctur in the event of her remarriag would be cut
down to a thousand a yearsh had four now and wa pinch on that
and as for bottl she knew what he hadeight hundr for sir eustac
had told her he wa next heir to the baronetci it wa true but sir
eustac look as though he would live for ever and besid he might
marri after all
for a few minut ladi croston contempl the possibl of exist
on eighteen hundr a year and what chanceri would give her as guardian
of her children in a poki hous somewher down at kensington soon she
realis that the thing wa not to be done
unless sir eustac will do someth for him it is veri clear that we
cannot be marri she said to herself with a sigh howev i need
not tell him that just yet or he will be rush back to south africa
or someth
v
sir eustac and hi brother carri out their programm thei dine
togeth and about halfpast nine drove round to grosvenor street
here thei were shown into the drawingroom by the solemn footman who
inform sir eustac that her ladyship wa upstair in the nurseri and
had left a messag for him that she would be down present
all right there is no hurri said sir eustac absent and the man
went downstair
bottl be nervou wa fidget round the room as usual and hi
brother be veri much at eas wa stand with hi back to the
fire and stare about him present hi glanc lit upon the blue
velvet curtain which shut off the room thei were in from the larger
saloon that had not been us sinc ladi croston widowhood and an
idea which had been float about in hi brain suddenli took definit
shape and form he wa a prompt man and in anoth second he had act
up to that idea
georg he said in a quick low voic listen to me and for heaven
sake dont interrupt for a minut you know that i do not like the idea
of your marri ladi croston you know that i think her worthlessno
wait a minut dont interrupti am onli sai what i think you
believ in her you believ that she is in love with you and will marri
you and have good reason to believ it have you not
bottl nod

is perfectli readi to marri somebodi elsemyself for instancewould
you still believ in her
bottl turn pale the thing is imposs he said
that is not the question would you still believ in her and would you
still marri her

imposs said bottl again besid if she did you dont want to
marri her

scrape as best i canalwai suppos my view of the ladi is correct

have you ever been on affection term with madelin
never on my honour
and yet you think she will marri you if you ask her even after what
took place with me yesterdai

eight thousand a year and you have eight hundredbecaus i have a titl

two will i fear not make up for those defici
bottl with a motion of hi hand wave hi brother courtli compliment
awai as it were and turn on him with a set white face
i do not believ you eustac he said do you understand what you
make out thi ladi to be when you sai that she could kiss me and tell me
that she love mefor she did both yesterdayand promis to marri you
todai
sir eustac shrug hi shoulder i think that the ladi in question
ha done someth like that befor georg

even she wa much shock and made up her mind to go home earli to

i
the rev thoma bull wa a man of rocklik charact with no more
imagin than a rock of good birth good abil good principl
and good reput realli he ought to have been name not thoma but john
bull be as he wa a typic repres of the british middl
class by natur a realli religi man and ow to the balanc of hi
mind not subject to most of the weak which often afflict other
veri earli in hi career he determin that thing spiritu were of far
greater import than thing tempor and that as etern is much
longer than time it wa wise to devot himself to the spiritu and
leav the tempor to look after itself there ar quit a number
of good peopl earnest believ in the doctrin of reward and
punish who take that practic view with such
repaid a thousandfold shall be
is a favourit line of a favourit hymn
it is true that hi idea of the spiritu wa limit perhap it would
be more accur to sai that it wa unlimit sinc he accept without
doubt or question everyth that wa to be found within the four
corner of what he had been taught as a boi he had been note for hi
prowess in swallow the largest pill
dont think he would sai to hi weaker brother and sister
especi on of the latter whose throat seem to be so constitut
that she wa oblig to cut up these bolus with a pair of scissor
dont think but gulp em down
so it wa with everyth els in life thoma did not think he gulp
it down thu in these matter of faith if other young folk ventur to
talk of allegori or even to cast unhallow doubt upon such point
as those of the exact method of the appear on thi earth of their
mother ev or whether the sun actual did stand still at the bid
of joshua or the ark fill with countless pair of live creatur
float to the top of ararat or jonah defi digest juic in
fact abod three dai in the interior of a whale thoma look on them
with a piti smile and remark that what had been written by mose
and other accept prophet wa enough for him
inde a stori wa told of him when he wa a boi at school which well
exemplifi thi attitud by wai of lighten their labour a veri
note geologist who had the art of interest youth audienc and
make the rock of the earth tell their own secular stori wa brought
to lectur to hi hous thi emin man lectur extrem well he
show how beyond a doubt the globe we inhabit on speck of matter
float in the sea of space had exist for million upon million of
year and how by the evolutionari chang of countless ag it had
at length becom fit to be the habit of men who probabl
themselv had live and move and had their be there for at least a
million of year perhap much longer
at the conclus of the entranc stori the boi were invit to ask
question thoma bull a larg beetlebrow youth rose at onc
and inquir of their titl and ag visitor a man of worldwid
reput why he thought it funni to tell them fairi tale the old
gentleman greatli interest put on hi spectacl and while the rest
of the school gasp and the head master and other pedagogu stare
amaz studi thi strang lad then said
i am outspoken myself and i like those who speak out when thei do so
from convict but my young friend why do you consid that iwel
exagger
becaus the bibl sai so repli thoma unabash the bibl tell
us that the world wa made in six dai not in million of year and
that the sun and the moon and the star were put in the sky to light it
also that man wa creat four thousand year bc therefor either you
ar wrong sir or the bibl is and i prefer the bibl
the emin scientist took off hi spectacl and carefulli put them
awai remark
most logic and conclus prai young gentleman do not allow
ani humbl deduct of my own or other to interfer with your
convict onli i believ it wa archbishop ussher not the bibl who
said that the world began about 4000 bc i think that on dai you mai
becom a great manin your own wai meanwhil i might suggest that a
certain sugar of manner sweeten controversi
after thi no more question were ask and the meet broke up in
confus
from all of which it will be gather that sinc none of us is perfect
even in thoma there were weak point for instanc he had what is
known as a temper also he wa bless with a good idea of himself and
hi own abil and had a share of that intoler by which thi is
so often accompani
in due cours thoma bull becam a theolog student rare wa there
such a student he turn neither to left nor right work eight hour
a dai when he did not work ten and took the highest possibl degre on
everi subject then he wa ordain about thi time he chanc to hear
a seri of sermon by a coloni bishop that direct hi mind toward
the missionfield thi wa after he had serv as a deacon in an east
end parish and becom acquaint with savageri in it western form
he consult with hi friend and hi superior as to whether hi true
call were not to the far part of the earth unanim thei answer
that thei thought so so unanim that a mild fellowlabour whom
he bulli wa stung to the uncharit remark that almost it look as
though thei want to be rid of him perhap thei did perhap thei held
that for energi so gigant there wa no fit outlet in thi narrow
land
but as it chanc there wa anoth to be consult for by thi time
the rev thoma bull had becom engag to the onli daughter of a
deceas london traderin fact he had been a shopkeep upon a larg
scale thi worthi citizen had remarri late in life choos or
be chosen by a handsom and rather fashion ladi of a somewhat
higher class than hi own who wa herself a widow by her he had no
issu hi daughter dorca be the child of hi first marriag mr
humphrei for that wa hi name made a somewhat peculiar will leav
all hi fortun which wa consider to hi young widow charg
howev with an annuiti of 300 pound settl on hi daughter dorca
on the dai befor hi death howev he ad a codicil which anger
mr humphrei veri much when she saw it to the effect that if she
remarri threefourth of the fortun were to pass to dorca at onc
and that she or her heir were ultim to receiv it all upon the
deceas of hi wife
the result of these testamentari disposit wa that on hous
although it chanc to be larg prove too small to hold mr humphrei
and her stepdaught dorca the latter wa a mild and timid littl
creatur with a turnedup nose lightcolour fluffi hair and
an indetermin mouth still there wa a degre of annoy and
fashion scorn at which her spirit rose the end of it wa that she
went to live on her three hundr a year and to practis good work in
the east end be laudabl determin to make a career for herself
which she wa not in the least fit to do
thu it wa that dorca came into contact with the rev thoma bull
from the first time she saw her futur husband he domin and
fascin her he wa in the pulpit and realli look veri handsom
there with hi burli form hi larg black ey and hi determin
cleanshaven face moreov he preach well in hi own vigor
fashion
on thi occas he wa engag in denounc the vice and petti of
modern womanupperclass modern womanof whom he knew noth at
all a topic that appeal to an east end congreg he show how
worthless wa thi luxuri stamp of femal what a deal thei thought
of dress and of other more evil delight he compar them to the
florentin whom savonarola in hi heart thoma saw resembl
between himself and that great if narrow man scourg till thei wept in
repent and pile up their jewel and fripperi to be burn
what do thei do with their live he ask is there on in ten thousand
of them who would abandon her luxuri and go forth to spread the light
in the dark place of earth or would even pinch herself to support
other who did and so on for thirti minut
dorca listen and reflect on her stepmoth thought how
marvel true it all wa had he known her person which so far
as she wa awar wa not the case the preacher could not have describ
her better also it wa certain that mr humphrei and her friend had
not the slightest intent of spread ani kind of light unless it
were that of their own ey and jewel or of go anywher to do so
except perhap to mont carlo in the spring
how nobl too wa the pictur he paint of the life of selfsacrific
and high endeavour that lai open to her sex she would like to lead
that higher life be in truth a goodheart littl thing full of
righteou impuls onli unfortun she did not know how for her
present mild and tent effort had been somewhat disappoint in
their fruit
then an inspir seiz her she would consult mr bull
she did so with result that might have been anticip within three
month she and her mentor were engag and within six marri
it wa dure those fervid week of engag that the pair agre not
without a littl hesit upon the part of dorca that in due cours
he would becom a missionari and set forth to convert the heathen in
what he call blackest africa first howev there wa much to be
done he must go through a long cours of train he must acquaint
himself with variou savag languag such as swahili and zulu and so
must she
oh how poor dorca who wa not veri clever and had no gift of tongu
came to loath those barbar dialect still she work awai at them
like a heroin confin herself ultim with a wise and practic
prescienc to learn word and sentenc that dealt with domest
affair as as light the fire put the kettl on to boil sister
have you chop the wood ceas make so much nois in the
kitchenhut wake me if you hear the lion eat our cow and so
forth
for more than a year after their marriag these preliminari continu
while thoma work like a hors though it is true that dorca
slacken her attent to swahili and zulu grammar in the pressur of
more immedi affair especi wa thi so after the babi wa born
a girl flaxenhair like her mother whom thoma christen by the
name of tabitha and who in after year becam the littl flower of
thi histori then as the time of departur drew near anoth thing
happen her stepmoth mr humphrei insist upon go to a ball
in lent where she caught a chill that develop into inflamm of
the lung and kill her
the result of thi visit of provid as thoma call it wa
that dorca suddenli found herself a rich woman with an incom of quit
2000 pound a year for her father had been wealthier than she knew
now temptat took hold of her why she ask herself should thoma
depart to africa to teach black peopl when with hi gift and her
mean he could stop at home comfort and befor veri long becom a
bishop or at the least a dean
greatli dare she propound thi matter to her husband onli to find
that she might better have tri to knock down a stone wall with
her head than induc him to chang hi plan he listen to her
patientlyunless overirrit a perfectli exasper patienc wa
on of hi giftsthen said in a cold voic that he wa astonish at
her
when you were poor he went on you vow yourself to thi servic
and now becaus we ar rich you wish to turn traitor and becom a seeker
after the fleshpot of egypt never let me hear you mention the matter
again
but there is the babi she exclaim africa is hot and might not
agre with her
heaven will look after the babi he answer
that just what i am afraid of wail dorca
then thei had their first quarrel in the cours of which be it
admit she said on or two spite thing for instanc she
suggest that the real reason he wish to go abroad wa becaus he wa
so unpopular with hi brother clergymen at home and especi with hi
superior to whom he wa fond of administ lectur and reproof
it end of cours in her be crush as flat as is a brokenwing
butterfli that come in the path of a garden roller he stood up and
tower over her
dorca he said do what you will stai here if you wish and enjoi
your monei and your luxuri i sail on the first of next month for
africa becaus you ar weak do i ceas to be strong
i think not she repli sob and gave in
so thei sail first classthi wa a concess for he had intend
to go thirdbut without a nurs on that point he stood firm
you must learn to look after your own children he said a remark at
which she made a littl face that meant more than he knew
ii
the career of mr and mr bull dure the next eight year call for
but littl comment partli becaus tabitha wa delic at first and
must be within reach of doctor thei live for the most part at variou
coast citi in africa where thoma work with hi usual fervour
and earnest acquir languag which he learn to speak with
consider perfect though dorca never did and acquaint
himself thoroughli with the local condit in so far as thei affect
missionari enterpris
he took no interest in anyth els not even in the histori of the
nativ or their peculiar form of cultur sinc for the most part
thei have a secret cultur of their own all that wa done with he
said a turn page of the black and barbar past it wa hi busi
to write new thing upon a new sheet perhap it wa for thi reason
that thoma bull never realli came to understand or enter into the heart
of a zulu or a basuto or a swahili or inde of ani darkskin man
woman or child to him thei were but brand to be snatch from the
burn desper and disagre sinner who must be save and he
set to work to save them with fear vigour
hi wife although her vocabulari wa still extrem limit and much
ek out with english or dutch word got on much better with them
you know thoma she would sai thei have all sort of fine idea
which we dont understand and ar not so bad in their wai onli you
must find out what their wai is
i have found out he said grimli it is a veri evil wai the wai of
destruct i wish you would not make such a friend of that sly black
nursegirl who tell me a lie onc out of everi three time she open
her mouth
for the rest dorca wa fairli comfort as with their mean she
wa alwai abl to have a nice hous in whatev town thei might be
station where she could give tenni parti and even littl lunch
and dinner that is if her husband chanc to be awai as often he
wa visit upcountri district or take the duti there for anoth
missionari who wa sick or on leav inde in these condit she
came to like africa fairli well for she wa a chilli littl thing who
love it ampl allpervad sunshin and made a good mani friend
especi among young men to whom her helpless and rather forlorn
littl face appeal
the women too like her for she wa kindli and alwai readi to help
in case of poverti or other distress luckili in a wai she wa her
own mistress sinc her fortun came to her unfett by ani marriag
settlement moreov it wa in the hand of truste so that the
princip could not be alien therefor she had her own account and
her own chequebook and us her spare monei as she like more than on
poor missionari wife knew thi and call her bless as through her
bounti thei onc again look upon the shore of england or were abl
to send a sick child home for treatment but of these good deed dorca
never talk least of all to her husband if he suspect them after
on encount upon some such matter in which she develop a hidden
strength and purpos he had the sens to remain silent
so thing went on for year not unhappili on the whole for as thei
roll by the child tabitha grew acclimatis and much stronger by thi
time although dorca love her husband as all wive should obei him
in all or at ani rate in most thing she had come to recognis that he
and she were veri differ constitut of cours she knew that
he wa infinit her superior and inde that of most peopl like
everybodi els she admir hi upright hi fixiti of purpos and
hi devour energi and believ him to be destin to great thing
still to tell the truth which she often confess with penit
upon her knee on the whole she felt happier or at ani rate more
comfort dure hi occasion absenc to which allus ha been
made when she could have her friend to tea and indulg in human gossip
without be call worldli
it onli remain to add that her littl girl tabitha a name she
shorten into tabbi wa her constant joi especi as she had no
other children tabbi wa a bright fairhair littl thing clever
too with resourc and a will of her own an improv edit of
herself but in everi wai utterli unlik her father a fact that
secretli annoi him everybodi love tabitha and tabitha love
everybodi not except the nativ who ador her between the
kaffir and tabitha there wa some strong natur bond of sympathi thei
understood on anoth
at length came the blow
it happen thu not far from the border of zululand but in the
countri that is vagu known as portugues territori wa a certain
tribe of mix zulu and basuto blood who were call the amasisa that
is the peopl of the sisa now sisa in the zulu tongu ha a peculiar
mean which mai be translat as sent awai it is said that thei
acquir thi name becaus the zulu king when thei exercis dominion
over all that district were in the habit of despatch larg herd of
the royal cattl to be look after by these peopl or in their own
idiom to be sisad ie agist as we sai in english of stock that
ar entrust to anoth to graze at a distanc from the owner home
some howev gave anoth reason in the territori of thi tribe wa
a certain spot of which we shall hear more later where these same
zulu king were in the habit of caus offend against their law or
custom to be execut such also like the cattl were sent awai
and from on of these two caus whichev it mai have been or perhap
from both the tribe origin deriv it name
it wa not a larg tribe perhap there were three hundr and fifti
head of famili in it or sai someth under two thousand soul in
all descend probabl of a mild peacelov industri basuto
stock on to which had been graft a certain number of the domin
warlik zulu who perhap had kill out the men and possess
themselv of the basuto women and their cattl the result wa that
among thi small peopl there were two strain on of the bellicos
type who practic remain zulu and the other of the milder and
more progress basuto stamp who were in the major
among these sisa missionari had been at work for a number of year
with result that on the whole were satisfactori more than half of
them had been baptis and were christian of a sort a church had been
built a more or less modern system of agricultur had been introduc
and the most of the popul wore trouser or skirt accord to
sex recent howev troubl had arisen over the old question of
polygami the missionari would not toler more than on wife while
the zulu section of the tribe insist upon the old prerog of
plural marriag
the disput had end in someth like actual fight in the cours
of which the church and the school were burnt also the missionari
hous becaus of these troubl thi excel man wa forc to camp
out in the wet for it wa the raini season and catch a chill di
suddenli of heartfailur follow rheumat fever just after he had
move into hi new habit which consist of some rather glorifi
nativ hut
subsequ to these event there came a petit from the chief of the
tribe a man call kosa whose name probabl deriv from the zulu word
koo which mean chief or captain address to the church author
and ask that a new teacher might be sent to take the place of him who
had di also to rebuild the church and the school if thi were not
done said the messeng the tribe would relaps into heathen
sinc the zulu and antichristian parti head by an old witchdoctor
name menzi wa strong and gain ground
thi wa an appeal that could not be neglect sinc hitherto the sisa
had been a spot of light in a dark place as most of the surround
peopl who were of the old zulu stock remain heathen if that light
went out the chanc were that thei would continu to be so wherea if
it went on burn anoth result might be hope sinc from a spark a
great fire mai come therefor earnest search wa made for a suitabl
person to deal with so difficult and delic a situat with the
result that the lot fell upon the rev thoma bull
onc hi name wa mention it wa acclaim by all he wa the veri
man thei said bold determin fill with a jesuit fieri zeal
although it need scarc be explain that he hate jesuit as a cat
doe mustard on whom no witchdoctor would daunt on moreov
who be bless with thi world good would ask no pai but on the
contrari would perhap contribut a handsom sum toward the rebuild
of the church thi it mai be explain as the mission itself scarc
possess a spare penni with which to bless itself wa a point that
could not be overlook
so thoma wa sent for and offer the post after it difficulti and
drawback had been fairli but diplomat explain to him he did
not hesit a minut or at ani rate five minut he took it at onc
feel that hi call had come also that it wa the veri thing for
which he had been seek up in that seclud spot in portugues
territori he would he reflect be entir on hi own a sort of
littl bishop with no on to interfer with him and abl to have hi
own wai about everyth which in more civilis region he found he
could not do here a set of older gentlemen who were alwai appeal
to their experi of nativ continu put a spoke into hi wheel
bring hi boldest plan to naught there it would be differ
he would fashion hi own wheel and grind the witchdoctor with hi
follow to dust beneath it iron rim he said that he would go at
onc and what is more he promis a donat of 1000 pound toward
the rebuild of the church and other burntout edific
that is veri gener of bull remark the dean when he had left the
room

of him bull sound as he is and splendid as he is in mani wai doe
not it seem to me quit understand nativ or that it is easier to
lead them than to drive them

follow week thoma wa so preoccupi that he scarc seem to
notic hi wife affection greet even the fact that both she

ask a few young peopl offic and maiden of the place ala as
it chanc among them were no clergi or their wive and daughter to
plai tenni that afternoon and some of them to stop to supper now she
wa wonder how her auster spous would take the new he might

ooh and where is that is it anywher near durban or perhap
maritzburg
i dont exactli know at present though i understand that it is
about six dai trek from eshow in zululand but over the border in
portugues territori inde i am not sure that on can trek all the
wai at least when the river ar in flood then it is necessari to
cross on of them in a basket slung upon a rope or if the river is not
too full in a punt at thi season the basket is most us
great heaven thoma do you propos to put me and tabbi in a basket
like st paul and did you rememb that we have just taken on thi
hous for anoth year
of cours i do the famili of missionari must expect to face
hardship from which it is true circumst have reliev you up to
the present it is therefor onli right that thei should begin now when
tabitha ha becom as strong as ani child of her ag that i know as for
the hous i had forgotten all about it it must be relet or fail
that we must bear the loss which fortun we can well afford
dorca look at him and said noth becaus word fail her so he
went on hurriedli
by the wai love i have taken a slight liberti with your name it
appear that the church at sisa which i understand wa quit a nice on
built with subscript obtain in england by on of my predecessor
who chanc to have influenc or connect at home ha been recent
burnt down togeth with the missionhous now the hous can wait
sinc of cours we can make shift for a year or two in some nativ
hut but obvious we must have a church and as the societi is
overdrawn it cannot help in the matter under these circumst i
ventur to promis a gift of 1000 pound which it is estim will
cover the reerect of both church and hous
he paus await a repli but as dorca still said noth continu
you will rememb that you told me quit recent that you found you
had 1500 pound to your credit therefor i felt quit sure that
you would not grudg 1000 pound of it to enabl me to fulfil thi
dutythi semidivin duti
oh said dorca as a matter of fact i intend to spend that 1000
pound or much of it otherwis there ar some peopl here whom i
want to help but fortun i had not mention thi to them so
thei will have to do without the monei and their holidai also the
children cannot be sent to school and by the wai how is tabbi to be
educ in thi farawai place
i am sorri dear but after all privat luxuri includ that of
benevol must give wai to sacr need so i will write to the dean
that the monei will be forthcom when it is need as for tabitha
educ of cours we will undertak it between us at ani rate for
the next few year
ye thoma sinc you have pass your word or rather my word the
monei will be forthcom but meanwhil if you can spare me the odd
500 pound i suggest that i should stai here with tabbi who could
continu to attend the colleg as a dayscholar while you get us some
place readi to live in among these savag the sneezer or whatev
thei ar call
my dear answer thoma consid what you ask you ar in perfect
health and so is our child would it not then be a downright scandal
that you should stop here in luxuri while your husband went out to
confront grave difficulti among the sisasnot the sneezersfor i mai
tell you at onc that the difficulti ar veri grave there is a note
witchdoctor amongst thi peopl name menzi who i understand is
suspect of have burn down the missionhous and probabl the
church also becaus he said that it wa ridicul that an unmarri
man like the late priest should have so larg a dwell to live alon
thi of cours wa but a cun excus for hi savag malevol
but if anoth appar celib arriv he might repeat the argument
and it applic also often these barbarian consid that a man who
is not marri must be insan therefor it is absolut necessari
that you and the child should be present with me from the first
oh is it said dorca turn veri pink well i am sorri to sai
that just now it is absolut necessari that i should be absent from
you sinc i have a tenni parti thi afternoonth offic of the
garrison ar come and about half a dozen girlsand i must go to
arrang about the tea
a tenni parti a tenni parti to those godless offic and probabl
equal godless girl exclaim her husband i am asham of you
dorca you should be occupi with higher thing
then at last the worm turn
do you know thoma she answer spring up that i am inclin
to be asham of you too who i think should be occupi in keep your
temper you have accept some strang mission without consult me
you have promis 1000 pound of my monei without consult me and
now you scold me becaus i have a few young peopl to plai tenni and
stop to supper it is unchristian it is uncharit it istoo bad
and sit down again she burst into tear
the rev thoma who by now wa in a realli regal rage not know what
to sai or do glare about him by illluck hi ey fell upon a box of
cigarett that stood upon the mantelpiec
what ar those thing do here he ask i do not smoke so thei
cannot be for me is our moneyi beg pardonyour monei which is
so much need in other direct to be wast in provid such
unnecessariesfor offic andidl girl ohbless it all and
seiz the offend cigarett he hurl them through the open window
a scatter shower of white tube which some kaffir outsid instantli
proceed to collect
then he rush from the hous and dorca went to get readi for her
parti but first she sent a servant to bui anoth box of cigarett it
wa her first act of rebellion against the iron rule of the rev thoma
bull
iii
in the end as mai be guess dorca who wa a good and faith
littl soul accompani her husband to the sisa countri tabitha went
also rejoic have learn that in thi happi land there wa no
school dorca found the journei aw but realli had she but known
it it wa most fortun inde ideal her husband who wa a littl
anxiou on the point had made the best arrang that were possibl
on such an expedit
the wagon in which thei trek wa good and comfort and although
it wa still the raini season fortun favour them in the matter
of weather so that when thei came to the formid river thei were
actual abl to trek across it with the help of some oxen borrow
from a missionari in that neighbourhood without have recours to the
dread ropeslung basket or even to the punt
beyond the river thei were met by some christian kaffir of the sisa
tribe who were sent by the chief kosa to guid them through the hundr
mile or so of difficult countri which still lai between them and their
goal these men were pleasantspoken but rather depress folk clad in
muchworn european cloth that somehow becam them veri ill thei gave
a melancholi account of the spiritu condit of the sisa who sinc
the death of their last pastor thei said were relaps rapidli into
heathen under the pernici influenc of menzi the witchdoctor
therefor kosa sent hi greet and prai the new teacher to hurri to
their aid and put a stop to thi state of thing
fear noth said thoma in a loud voic speak in zulu which by
now he knew veri well i will put a stop to it
then thei ask him hi name he repli that it wa thoma bull which
after the nativ fashion have found out what bull meant in english
thei translat into a long appel which strictli render meant
roaringleaderoftheholyherd when he found thi out thoma flatli
declin ani such unchristian titl with the result that anxiou to
oblig thei christen him tombool and as tombool thenceforward
he wa known dorca object to thi name but tabitha remark sage
that at ani rate it wa better than tomfool
thi wa to hi face but behind hi back thei call him inkunzi
which mean bull and in order to keep up the idea design poor
dorca isidanda that be interpret signifi a gentlenatur
cow to tabitha thei gave a prettier name call her imba or littl
flower
at first dorca wa quit pleas with her titl which sound nice
but when she came to learn what it meant it wa otherwis
how can you expect me thoma to live among a peopl who call me a
mild cow she ask indignantli
never mind my dear he answer in their symbol wai thei
ar onli signifi that you will feed them with the milk of human
kind a repli which did not sooth her at all in fact of the
three the child alon wa pleas becaus she said that open
flower wa a prettier name than tabbi which remind her of cat
thenceforward follow a track for it could not be call a road
thei advanc slowli first over a mountain pass on the farther side of
which the wagon nearli upset and then across a great bushclad plain
where there wa much game and the lion roar round them at night
necessit great fire to frighten them awai these lion terrifi
dorca a townbr woman who had never seen on of them except in the
zoo so much that she could scarc sleep but oddli enough tabitha wa
not disturb by them
god will not let us be eaten by a lion will he father she ask in
her simpl faith
certainli not he answer and if the brute tri to do so i shall
shoot it
id rather trust to god father becaus you know you can never hit
anyth repli tabitha
fortun howev it never becam necessari for thoma to show hi
skill as a marksman for when thei got through the bushveld there were
no more lion
on the fourth dai after thei left the river thei found themselv upon
gentl slope veld that by degre led them upward to high land where
it wa cold and healthi and there were no mosquito for two dai thei
trek over these high land which seem to be quit uninhabit save
by herd of feed buck till at length thei attain their crest and
below them saw a beauti mimosaclad plain which the guid told them
wa the sisa countri
the promis land at last it make me feel like anoth mose said
thoma wave hi arm
oh isnt it love exclaim tabitha
ye dear answer her mother butbut i dont see ani town
thi inde wa the case becaus there wa none the sisa kraal for it
could not be dignifi by ani other name be round a project
ridg and out of sight for the rest the prospect wa veri fair be
parklik in charact with dot clump of tree among which ran
or rather wound a silver stream that seem to issu from between two
rocki koppi in the distanc
these koppi the guid told them were the gate of sisa town thei
neglect to add that it lai in a hot and unhealthi hillring hollow
beyond them the site have origin been chosen becaus it wa
difficult to attack be onli approach through certain pass
therefor it wa a veri suitabl place in which to kraal the cattl
of the zulu king in time of danger that dai thei travel down the
decliv into the plain where thei camp by the follow afternoon
thei came to the koppi through which the river ran and ask it
name the answer wa ukufa
ukufa said thoma why that mean death
ye wa the repli becaus in the old dai thi river wa the river
of death where evildo were sent to be slain
how horribl said dorca for unfortun she had overheard and
understood thi convers
by the side of the river wa a kind of shelf of rock that wa us as a
road and over thi thei bump in their wagon till present thei were
past the koppi and could see their futur home beyond it wa a plain
some mile across and entir surround by precipit hill the
river enter it through a gorg to the north in the centr of thi
plain wa anoth larg koppi of which the river ukufa or death
wash on side around thi koppi amid a certain area of cultiv
land stood the town of the christian branch of the sisa it consist
of group of hut ten or a dozen group in all set on low ground near
the river which suggest that the popul might number anyth
between seven hundr and a thousand soul
at the time that our parti first saw it the sun wa sink and had
disappear behind the western portion of the barricad of hill
therefor the vallei if it mai be so call wa plung in a gloom
that seem almost unnatur when compar with the brilliant sky abov
across which the radiant light of an african sunset alreadi sped like
arrow or rather like red and omin spear of flame
what a dread place exclaim dorca is our home to be here
i suppos so answer thoma who to tell the truth for onc wa
himself somewhat dismai it doe look a littl gloomi but after
all it is veri shelter and home is what on make it he ad
sententi
here the convers wa interrupt by the arriv of the chief and
some of the christian portion of the sisa tribe who have been warn
of it approach by messeng to the number of a hundr and fifti or so
had advanc to meet the parti
thei were a motlei crowd clad in everi kind of garment rang from a
motheaten gener tunic to practic noth at all inde on
tall thin fellow sport onli a batter helmet of rusti steel that
had drift here from some european armi a moocha or waistbelt of
catskin and a pair of decai tennissho through which hi toe
appear with them came what were evid the remain of the church
choir when there wa a church for thei wore dirti fragment of
surplic and sang what seem to be a hymn tune to the strain of a
decad accordion
the tune wa long and end in a kind of howl like to that of a
disappoint jackal when at length it wa finish the chief kosa
appear he wa a middleag man becom prematur old becaus he
had live too fast in hi prechristian dai or so report said now he
had a somewhat imbecil appear for hi finger twitch and when he
spoke hi mouth jerk up at the corner also he kept look over hi
shoulder as though he were afraid of someth behind him altogeth he
inspir thoma with no confid whatev els he might be clearli
he wa not a staff for a crusad to lean upon
still he came forward and made a veri nice speech as a highbr
nativ nobl such as he wa can almost invari do with mani piou
express he welcom the new teacher sai that he and hi peopl
that is those of them who were christian would do their best to make
him happi
thoma thank him in appropri languag ad that he on hi part
would do hi best to promot their welfar and to save their soul
kosa repli that he wa glad to hear it becaus these need save
sinc most of the sisa peopl were now servant of the devil sinc the
last umfundisi or teacher di thei had been walk the road
to hell at a veri great pace marri mani wive drink gin and
practis all kind of witchcraft under the guidanc of the isanusi
or doctor menzi thi man he ad had burn down the church and the
missionhous by hi magic though these had seem to be destroi by
lightn
with a proud gestur thoma announc that he would soon settl menzi
and all hi work and that meanwhil as the dark wa come on
he would be glad if kosa would lead them to the place where thei were to
sleep
so thei start the accordionman plai execr lead the wai
and trek for about a mile and a half till thei came to the koppi in
the centr of the plain reach it by follow the left bank of the
river that wash it western face
pass between a number of tumbl wall built of loos stone that
onc in bygon gener had shelter the cattl of chaka and other
zulu king thei reach a bai in the side of the koppi that mai
have cover four acr of ground here by the edg of the river but
stand a littl abov it were the burntout ruin of a build that
by it shape had evid been a church and near to it other ruin of
a school and of a hous which onc wa the missionst
as thei approach thei heard swell from within those crack and
melancholi wall the sound of a fierc defiant chant which thoma
guess must be some ancient zulu warsong as inde it wa it wa
a veri impress song chant by mani peopl which inform the
listen that those who sung it were the king oxen born to kill
the king enemi and to be kill for the king and so forth a
deepnot savag song that thrill the blood at the first sound of
which the accordion gave a feebl wail and metaphor expir
isnt that beauti music father i never heard anyth like that
befor exclaim tabitha
befor thoma could answer out from the ruin doorwai of the church
issu a band of menther might have been a hundr of themclad in
all the magnific panopli of oldtim zulu warrior with tall plume
upon their head larg shield upon their arm kilt about their
middl and fring of oxtail hang from their knee and elbow
thei form into a doubl line and advanc wave broadblad
assegai then at a signal thei halt by the wagon and utter a
deepthroat salut
in front of their line wa a littl wither old fellow who carri
neither shield nor spear but onli a black rod to which wa bound the
tail of a wildebeest except for hi moocha he wa almost nake
and into hi grei hair wa woven a polish ring of black gum from
which hung sever littl bladder upon hi scraggi neck wa a necklac
of baboon teeth and amulet whilst abov the moocha wa twist a
snake that might have been either aliv or stuf
hi face though ag and shrunken wa finefeatur and full of
breed while hi hand and feet were veri small hi ey were
brood the ey of a mystic but when hi interest wa excit their
glanc wa as sharp as a bradawl just now it wa fix on thoma who
felt as if it were pierc him through and through the owner of the
ey as thoma guess at onc wa menzi a witchdoctor veri famou
in those part
why ar these men arm with spear it is against the law for kaffir
to carri spear he said to the chief
thi is portugues territori there is no law in portugues territori
answer kosa with a vacant stare
then we might be all murder here and no notic taken exclaim
thoma
ye teacher mani peopl have been murder here my father wa
murder and i dare sai i shall be
who by
kosa made no answer but hi vacant ey rest for a littl while on
menzi
good god what a countri said thoma to himself look at dorca
who wa frighten then he turn to meet menzi who wa advanc
toward them
cast a glanc of contempt at kosa of whom he took no further notic
menzi salut the newcom by lift hi hand abov hi head then
with the utmost polit he drew a snuffbox fashion from the tip of
a buffalohorn out of a slit in the lobe of hi left ear extract the
wooden stopper and offer thoma some snuff
thank you but i do not take that nasti said thoma
menzi sigh as though in disappoint and have help himself to
a littl restopp the horn and thrust it back into the lobe of hi
ear next he said speak in a gentl and refin voic
greet teacher who the messeng tell us ar call tombool in
your own languag and in our inkunzi a good name for in truth you
look like a bull i am glad to see that you ar made much more robust
than wa the last teacher and therefor will live longer in thi place
than he did though as for the ladyteach and he glanc at the
delicatelook dorca
thoma stare at thi man to whom alreadi he had taken a strong
dislik then move thereto either by a veri natur outburst of temper
or perchanc by a flash of inspir he repli
ye i shall live longer than did my brother who di here and ha
gone to heaven and longer i think than you will
thi person remark seem to take menzi aback inde for a moment he
look frighten recov himself howev he said
i perceiv teacher tombool that like myself you ar a witchdoctor
and a prophet at present i do not know which of us will live the
longer but i will consult my spirit and tell you afterward
prai do not troubl to do so on my account for i do not believ in
your spirit
of cours you do not teacher no doctor believ in anoth doctor
spirit sinc each ha hi own and there ar more spirit than there
ar doctor teacher tombool i greet you and tell you at onc that we
ar at war over thi matter of spirit thi tribe teacher is a cleft
log ye it is split into two the chief there kosa sit on on half
of the log with hi christian i sit on the other half with the rest
who ar as our father were so if you wish to fight i shall fight with
such weapon as i have no do not look at the spearsnot with spear
but if you leav me and my follow alon we shall leav you alon
if you ar wise i think that you will do well to walk your own road and
suffer us to walk our
on the contrari answer thoma i intend that all the sisa peopl
shall walk on road the road that lead to heaven
is it so teacher menzi repli with a mysteri smile
then he turn hi head and look at the darkl river that just here
where it ran beneath an overhang ledg of the koppi wa veri deep
and still thoma felt that there wa a world of mean in hi look
though what it might be he did not know suddenli he rememb that
thi river wa name death
after menzi had look quit a long while onc more he salut as
though in farewel search the face of the three white peopl
especi tabitha with hi dreami ey and let them fall
search the ground also near to where he stood grew a number of veld
flower such as appear in their glori after the rain in africa among
these wa a rare and beauti white lili thi lili menzi pluck and
step forward present it to tabitha sai
a flower for the flower a gift to a child from on who is childless
her father saw and medit interfer but he wa too late tabitha
had alreadi taken the lili and wa thank menzi in hi own tongu
which she knew well enough have been brought up by zulu nurs he
smile at her sai
all spirit black or white love flower
then for a third time he salut not the other but tabitha with more
hearti than befor and turn depart follow by hi spearmen
who also salut tabitha as thei file in front of her
it wa a strang sight to see these great plume men lift their broad
spear to the beauti brighthair child who stood there hold the
tall white lili in her hand as though it were a sceptr
iv
when menzi and hi compani had depart vanish round the corner of
the koppi thoma again ask the chief where thei were to sleep an
urgent matter as dark wa now approach
kosa answer with hi usual vagu that he suppos in the hut where
the late teacher had di after the missionhous wa burnt down so
thei trek on a littl wai pass beneath the shelf of rock that ha
been mention as project from that side of the koppi which overhung
the stream where there wa just room for a wagon to travel between the
cliff and the water
what a dark road said dorca and on of the christian nativ
who understood some english have been the bodyserv of the late
missionaryit wa he with the accordionrepli in zulu
ye ladi thi rock is call the rock of evildo becaus onc
those accus of witchcraft and other were thrown from it by the order
of the king to be eaten by the crocodil in that pool but he ad
brighten up do not be afraid for there ar no more zulu king and
we have hunt awai the crocodil though it is true that there ar
still plenti of wizard who ought to be thrown from the rock and he
look over hi shoulder in the direct menzi had taken ad in a
low voic you have just seen the greatest of them ladi
how horribl said dorca for the second time
a few yard farther on thei emerg from thi tunnellik roadwai and
found themselv travel along the northern face of the koppi here
surround by a fenc stood the chief kraal and just outsid of it
a larg thatch hut with on or two smaller hut at it back it wa
a good hut of it sort be built after the basuto fashion with a
project roof and a doorwai and have a kind of verandah floor
with beaten lime
thi wa the teacher hous said kosa as the wagon halt
i should like to look insid it at onc remark dorca doubtfulli
ad why what that and she point to a suspiciouslook
oblong mound that wa cover with weed over which she had almost
stumbl
that is the grave of the late teacher ladi we buri him here becaus
menzi peopl took up the bone of those who were in the churchyard and
threw them into the river explain kosa
dorca look as though she were go to faint but thoma rise to
the occas remark
come on dear the dead ar alwai with us and what better compani
could we have than the dust of our saint predecessor
i would rather have hi room murmur dorca and gather herself
togeth proceed to the hut
somebodi open the door with difficulti and as it seem to be veri
dark within thoma struck a match by the light of which dorca peer
into the interior next second she fell back into hi arm with a littl
scream
take me awai she said the place is full of rat
he stare it wa quit true there sit up upon the dead
missionari bed wa a singularli larg rat that did not seem in the
least frighten by their appear whilst other creatur of the same
tribe scuttl about the floor and up the wall
dorca slept or did not sleep that night in the wagon with tabitha
while thoma took hi rest beneath it as well as a drizzl rain that
wa fall would allow
such wa the begin of the life of the bull famili in sisaland
not an encourag begin it will be admit though no wors and
perhap much better than that which mani missionari and their famili
ar call upon to face in variou region of the earth what horror is
there that missionari have not been call upon to endur st paul
tell us of hi trial but thei ar parallel if not surpass even
in the present dai
missionari howev good mai not alwai be wise folk the reader
might even think the rev thoma bull to be no perfect embodi of
wisdom sympathi or perhap manner but take them as a class thei ar
certainli heroic folk who endur mani thing for small reward as we
reckon reward in noth perhap do thei show their heroism and faith
more greatli than in their persist habit of convei women and young
children into the most imposs place of the earth there to suffer
mani thing not exclus occasion of martyrdom at least the
protest section of their call doe thi the roman cathol ar
wiser in renounc marriag these save themselv from mani agoni
and have onli their own live and health at stake ar perhap better
fit to face rough work in rough place
even thoma bull not a particularli sensit person wa tempt more
than onc to arriv at similar conclus dure hi period of servic
in sisaland although neither he nor hi wife or child wa call upon
to face the aw extrem that have confront other of hi cloth
for instanc anoth thoma on owen who wa a missionari in zululand
at the time when dingaan the king massacr retief and hi boer
beneath hi ey
on the follow morn thoma crept out from beneath hi wagon not
refresh it is true but fill with a renew and even more fieri
zeal dure those damp hour of unrest he had reflect much and
brought the whole posit into perspect a clear if a narrow
perspect the chief with whom he had to deal evid wa a fool if
not an imbecil and the christian who remain after a gener of
teach were for the most part poor creatur the weakkne amongst
thi mixedblood tribe probabl those of the milder basuto origin
such strength as remain in the peopl who were after all but a
dwindl hand maroon in a distant spot wa to be found among
those of the old zulu stock thei were descend of the men sent
by the king chaka and dingaan to keep an ey upon the humbl basuto
slave whose duti it wa to herd the royal cattl the men too to
whom wa entrust the proud but hate busi of carri out
the execut of person that for on reason or anoth it wa not
desir to kill at home
the individu detail for these duti were for the most part of high
blood inconveni person perhap whom it wa desir to move to
a distanc thu as thoma bull soon learn menzi wa said to be
no less a man than the grandson of the king dingaan himself on whose
father had develop troublesom ambit but whose life had been
spare becaus hi mother wa a favourit with the king
henc some of the grandson pride which wa enhanc by the fact that
in hi youth he had been train in medicin and magic by a certain
zikali alia openerofroad who wa said to have been the greatest
witchdoctor that ever live in zululand and through him had acquir
or perhap develop inher psychic gift that were in ani case
consider
in the end howev he had return to hi petti tribe neglect
larger opportun as thoma learn becaus of some woman to whom
he wa attach at home it seem howev that he might as well have
stai awai sinc on hi arriv he found that thi woman had becom
on of the chief wive for which reason he afterward kill that
chief kosa father and possess himself of the woman who di
immedi afterward as menzi suspect by poison it wa
princip for thi reason that he hate kosa hi enemi son and all
who clung to him and partli becaus of that hatr and the fear that it
engend kosa and hi peopl had turn christian hope to protect
themselv thu against menzi and hi wizardri also for thi dead
woman sake menzi had never marri again
thoma did not learn all these detail and other that need not be
mention at onc but by the time he crept out from under that wagon
he had guess enough to show that he wa face to face with a veri tough
proposit and be the man he wa he gird hi loin to meet it
vow that he would conquer menzi or die in the attempt
that veri morn he call a council of the christian and set to work
with a will the first thing to do wa to make the late missionari
hut habit which did not take long and the next to commenc the
rebuild of the church thoma true to hi principl insist on
begin with the church and let the missionhous stand over
although dorca small blame to her complain at be oblig to live
for an indefinit time in a hut like a kaffir woman howev as usual
she wa oblig to give wai
as it chanc here there wa littl difficulti about build
oper for stone and wood and tambuki grass for thatch were
all at hand in plenti also the basuto section of the sisa as is common
among that race were clever mason and carpent some of them have
follow those trade in natal and the more settl place in zululand
where dwell had to be erect moreov thei possess wagon and
now that the dry season wa approach were abl to fetch store of
everi kind from the border of natal lastli thank to dorcass bank
account monei wa by comparison no object an unusu circumst
where missionari ar concern
so all the week thoma labour at these matter and at make himself
acquaint with hi congreg and all sundai he held openair
servic or taught in the ruin of the old church
thu in the midst of so mani new interest matter went on not
uncomfort and dorca becam more or less reconcil to her life
still she could never get over her loath of the place which she
believ to be illomen perhap becaus of it gloomi aspect coupl
with the name of the river and the us to which it had been put after
all not so veri long ago natur also thi distast wa accentu
by the unlucki circumst of their arriv
tabitha too wa realli happi sinc she love thi wild free life and
have been brought up amongst kaffir and talk their languag almost
as well as she did her own soon she made mani friend
perhap it wa a sens that the inform would not be well receiv
by her father that prevent her from mention that the greatest of
those friend wa the old witchdoctor menzi whom she often met when
she wa rambl about the place or it mai have been pure accid
sinc thoma wa too busi to bother about such trifl while her
mother who of cours knew kept her own counsel the truth is that
though he wa a heathen witchdoctor dorca like old menzi better than
ani other nativ in the district becaus she said quit truli that he
wa a gentleman howev sin and hardheart he might be moreov
with a woman percept she felt that if onli he were a friend at a
pinch he might be worth all the other put togeth while if he were an
enemi convers the same appli
so it came about that in the end there aros a veri strang state of
affair menzi hate thoma and did all he could to thwart him he like
dorca and did all he could to help her while the child tabitha he came
to worship for some reason he never reveal which wa hidden in the
depth of hi secret soul inde er long had she been hi own daughter
he could not have love her more it wa he who amongst mani other
thing gave her the pretti carv walkingstick of black and white
umzimbeet wood also the two young blue crane and the kid that
afterward were such pet of her and with them the beauti white
feather of a cock ostrich that had been kill on the veld in the same
wai it wa he who sent milk and egg to dorca when she wa at her wit
end for both which more than onc were found mysteri at the door
of their hut and not ani of hi christian flock as thoma fondli
imagin
thu thing went on for a while
meanwhil thoma found thi same menzi a stumblingblock and a rock
of offenc whenev he tri to convert man woman or child he wa
confront with menzi or the shadow of menzi thu those with whom he
wa argu would ask him why he could not work miracl like menzi let
him show them pictur in the fire or tell them who had stolen their
good or where thei would find their strai cattl and perhap thei
would believ him and so forth
at length thoma grew exasper and announc publicli that he
credit noth of thi magic and that menzi wa onli a common cheat
who threw dust into their ey if menzi could perform marvel let
him show these marvel to him thoma and to hi wife that thei might
judg of them for themselv
appar thi challeng wa repeat to the witchdoctor at least on
morn a few dai later when thoma went out accompani by dorca
and tabitha to meet the chief kosa and other and to discuss with them
whether ultim the missionhous should be rebuilt upon the old site
or elsewher he found a great concours of peopl all or nearli all
the tribe inde assembl on a level place where in the old dai stood
on of the great kraal design to hold the king cattl out of the
crowd emerg kosa look rather sillier than usual and of him thoma
inquir why it wa gather wa it to consult with him about the
missionhous
no teacher answer the chief menzi ha heard that you call him a
cheat and ha come to show that he is none assembl all the peopl
that thei mai judg between you and him
i do not want to see hi trick said thoma angrili tell him to go
awai
oh teacher repli kosa that would not be wise for then everyon
would believ that menzi magic is so great that you ar afraid even to
look upon it it is better to let him try perhap if you prai hard he
will fail for hi spirit will not alwai come when he call them
thoma hesit then be bold by natur determin that he would
see the thing through after all menzi wa an impostor and noth
els and could work no more magic than he could himself here wa a
providenti opportun to expos him so follow by the other he
advanc into the crowd which made wai for him
in an open space in it centr sat menzi wear all hi witchdoctor
trap bladder in hi hair snakeskin ti about him and
the rest but even in thi grotesqu attir still manag to look
dignifi with him were sever acolyt or attend on of them an
old woman also peculiarli arrai and carri hide bag that contain
their master medicin he rose as thei came salut thoma and
smile at dorca and tabitha veri sweetli at the latter
o teacher he said my ear hear that you sai that i am a liar and a
cheat who have no wonder at my command to whom the spirit never speak
and who deceiv the peopl now teacher i have come here that it mai
be seen whether you ar right or i am right if your magic is greater
than mine then i can do noth and i will eat the dust befor you
but if mine prevail then perhap all these will sai that you ar the
cheat not i also it is true that i am not a great magician as wa my
master zikali the openerofroad and cannot show you thing worthi
to be seen nor will i smell out evildo witch and wizard sinc
then the peopl might kill them and i think that there ar some here
who deserv to die in the ancient fashion no i will not do thi sinc
it is not right that those with you here he glanc at dorca and
tabitha should look upon the sight of blood even in thi land where
the whiteman law ha no power still there ar littl thing that
mai serv to amus you for an hour and hurt no on have ani of you lost
anyth for instanc
ye i have said tabitha with a laugh
is it so littl flower then be silent and do not sai what you have
lost have you told ani what you have lost
no answer tabitha becaus i wa afraid i should be scold
there imba there littl flower even that is too much becaus you
see the old cheat might guess someth from your word ye he might
guess that it is someth of valu that you have lost such as a
bracelet of gold or the thing that tick on which you white peopl
read the time nai be silent and do not let your face move lest i
should read it now let us see what it is that you have lost
then he turn to hi confeder as thoma call them and began to
ask them question which need not be set out in detail wa it an anim
that the littl flower had lost no it wa not an anim the spirit
told him that it wa not wa it an articl of dress no thei did not
think it wa an articl of dress yet the spirit seem to suggest that
it had someth to do with dress wa it a shoe wa it scissor wa
it a comb wa it a needl no but it wa someth that had to do with
needl what had to do with needl thread wa it thread no but
someth that had to do with thread wa it a silver shield which
push the needl that drew the thread
here tabitha could contain herself no longer but clap her hand and
cri out delightedli
ye that it it my thimbl
oh veri well said menzi but it is easi to discov what is lost
and hard to find it
then follow anoth long examin of the assessor or acolyt or
witchdoctor choru by which it wa establish at length that the
thimbl had been lost three dai befor when tabitha wa sit on a
stone sew that she believ it had fallen into a crevic of rock
and so forth
after thi the choru wa silent and menzi himself took up the game
appar ask question of the sky and put hi ear to the ground
for an answer
at length he announc 1 that the thimbl wa not among the rock
2 that it wa not lost at all
but it is it is you silli old man cri tabitha excitedli i have
hunt everywher and i cri about it becaus i havent got anoth

take thi knife and cut the line of your dress where you feel the
hard thing ah there is the silver shield which you have been carri
about with you all these dai
the crowd murmur approv dorca exclaim well i never and
thoma look first puzzl then angri then suspici

a plot togeth ask menzi can a sweet flower make plot and tell
li like the old doctor well well it is noth now let us try
someth better my bag my bag
thoma made as though he would go awai but menzi stop him sai
no doubter must stai to see the end of their doubt what shall i do
ah i have it
then from on of the bag he drew out a number of crook black stick
that look like bent eboni ruler and built them up crisscross in a
littl pile upon the ground next he found some bundl of fine dri
grass which he thrust into the interstic between the stick as he
did so bid on of hi servant to run to the nearest hut and bring a
coal of fire upon a sherd
a match will not do he said white men have touch it
present the burn ember arriv and mutter someth menzi blew
upon it as though to keep it alight
now white teacher he said in a voic that had suddenli becom
command think of someth think of what you will and i will show
it to you

make good your word
menzi thrust the ember into the haylik fibr and blew thei caught and
blaze up fierc make an extraordinarili larg flame consid
the small amount of the kindl the ebonylik stick also began to
blaze menzi grew excit

to be dead leapt up after them in a fierc blaze again he drop hi
hand and the fire di awai then he move hi arm to and fro and it
came back follow the motion of hi arm as though he drew it by a
string
have you thought white teacher have you thought he ask good
aris smoke
behold instead of the clear flame appear a fanshap column of dens
white smoke behind which menzi vanish all except hi outstretch
hand
look on to the smoke white peopl and do you littl flower tell me
what you see there he call from behind thi vapor veil
tabitha stare thei all stare then she cri out
i see a room i see an old man in a clergyman coat read a letter

thoma turn awai and utter someth like a groan for inde he
had thought of the dean and of the letter he had written to him a month
befor
the teacher is not satisfi said menzi if he had seen all he
thought of be so good and honest he would tell us there is some
mistak my spirit must have deceiv me think of someth els

go to think of it with a belfri spire roof with red tile and a
clock in the tower and i am go to think of the clock as point
to the exact hour of noon do you all understand it is imposs that
thi man should know of how i mean to build that spire and about the

thei return and stood in front of the fire and in obedi to
menzi motion onc more the fan of smoke aros on it grew someth
nebul someth uncertain that by degre took the form of a church
it wa not veri clear perhap becaus thoma found it difficult to
conceiv the exact shape of the church as it would be when it wa
finish or onli conceiv it bit by bit on thing howev wa veri
distinct in hi mind and that wa the propos spire and the clock as
a result there wa the spire stand at the end of the shadowi church
vivid and distinct and there wa the clock with it two copper hand

by degre the smoke melt awai and there on the ground were the ten
or twelv crook piec of eboni that thei had seen consum now to

v
a year had gone by dure which time by the most heroic exert
thoma bull had at length succeed in rebuild the church there
it stood a veri nice missionchurch construct of sundri brick
neatli plaster over cool and spaciou within for the thatch roof
wa lofti beautifulli furnish the font and the pulpit had been
import from england and finish off with the spire and clock of hi
dream the latter also import from england and especi adjust
for a hot climat
moreov there wa a sweet and loudthroat bell upon which the clock
struck with space allow for the addit of other that must
wait till thoma could make up hi mind to approach dorca as to the
provis of the necessari fund ye the church wa finish and the
bishop of those part had made a special journei to consecr it at
the hottest season of the year and as a reward for hi energi had
contract fever and nearli been wash awai in a flood river
onli on thing wa lack a suffici congreg to fill thi fine
church which secretli the bishop who wa a sensibl man thought would
have been of greater valu had it been erect in ani of sever
other local that he could have suggest for ala the christian
commun of sisaland did not increas occasion thoma succeed
in convert on of menzi follow and occasion menzi snatch
a lamb from the flock of thoma with the result that the scale
remain even neither go up nor down
the truth wa of cours that the matter wa chiefli on of race those
of the sisa in whom the basuto blood preponder becam christian
while those who were of the stubborn zulu stock strengthen and
inspir by their prophet menzi remain unblushingli heathen
still thoma did not despair on dai he told himself there would be a
great chang a verit landslid and he would see that church fill
with everi zulu in the district needless to sai he wish him no ill
but menzi wa an old man and befor long it might pleas provid to
gather that accurs wizard to hi father for that he wa a wizard of
some sort thoma no longer doubt a person directli descend from the
witch of endor or from some other of her compani who were mention
in the bibl there wa ampl author for wizard and if thei exist
then why should thei thei not continu to do so sinc he could not
explain it thoma swallow the magic much as in hi boyhood he us
to swallow the pill
ye if onli menzi were remov by the will of heaven which realli
thought thoma must be outrag by such proceed hi opportun
would come and menzi herd as the heathen were call in
sisaland would be ad to hi own the bishop it is true wa not
equal sanguin but said noth to discourag zeal so laudabl and so
uncommon
it wa while hi lordship wa recov from the sharp bout of fever
which he had develop in a new and mosquitohaunt hut with a damp
floor that had been especi erect for hi accommod that at
last the question of the rebuild of the missionhous came to a
head which it could not do while all the avail local labour to sai
noth of some hire from afar wa emploi upon the church
thoma it wa true wish to postpon it further point out that
a school wa most necessari and that after all thei had grown quit
accustom to the hut and were fairli comfort in them
on thi point howev dorca wa firm inde it would not be too
much to sai that have alreadi been disappoint onc she struck with
all the vigour of a tradeunionist she explain that the situat of
the hut on the brink of the river wa low and most unhealthi and that
in them she wa becom a victim to recurr attack of fever he
thoma might be feverproof as inde she thought he wa it wa true
also that tabitha had been extraordinarili well and grown much ever
sinc she came to sisaland which puzzl her inasmuch as the place
wa notori unhealthi for children even if thei were of nativ
blood inde in her agit she ad an unwis remark to the
effect that she could onli explain their daughter peculiar health
by suppos that menzi had laid a good charm upon her as all the
nativ believ and he announc publicli that he had done
thi made thoma veri angri admittedli not without caus forget
hi convers to a belief in the realiti of menzi magic he talk
in a loud voic about the disgrac of be infect with vile heathen
superstit such as he had never thought to hear utter by hi
wife christian lip dorca howev stuck to her point and enforc
it by a domest exampl ad that the creatur which in polit
societi ar call bedpest that haunt the straw of the hut
torment her while tabitha never had so much as a singl bite
the end of it wa that the matter of missionhous versu hut wa
refer to the bishop for hi opinion as the teeth of hi lordship
were chatter with agu result he knew full well from the fever
he had contract in the said hut dorca found in him a most valuabl
alli he agre that a missionhous ought to be built befor the school
or anyth els and suggest that it should be place in a higher
and better situat abov the mist that rose from the river and the
height to which mosquito fly
bow to the judgment of hi superior which realli he heard with
gratitud although in hi zeal and unselfish he would have
postpon hi own comfort and that of hi famili till other duti had
been fulfil thoma repli that he knew onli on such place which
would be near enough to the chief town it wa on the koppi itself
about fifti feet abov the level of and overhang the river where he
had note there wa alwai a breez even on the hottest dai sinc the
conform of thi hill seem to induc an unceas draught of air
he ad that if hi lordship were well enough thei might go to look at
the site
so thei went all of them ascend a slope ancient path that wa
never precipit thei came to the place a flat tableland that perhap
measur an acr and a half which by some freak of natur had been
scoop out of the side of the koppi and wa back by a precipit
cliff in which were cave the front part of thi plateau that which
approach to and overhung the river wa of virgin rock but the
acr or so behind wa fill with veri rich soil that in the cours of
centuri had been wash down from the side of the koppi or result
from the decomposit of it materi
the veri place said the bishop the access is easi the hous would
stand hereno need to dig deep foundat in thi stone and behind
when those tree have been clear awai you could have a beauti and
fertil garden where anyth will grow also look there is a stream
of pure water run from some spring abov it is an ideal site for a
hous not more than three minut walk from the church below the best
i should sai in the whole vallei and then consid the view
everyon agre and thei were leav the place in high spirit

but my good man said the bishop what you sai is nonsens these

christian have no belief in ghost or if thei exist we ar protect

none at all interpos thoma boldli and speak in zulu thi man

witchdoctor and hi rubbish even if he doe deal with satan with your

quit right of cours quit right said the bishop though within
himself he reflect that evid the associ of the spot were
disagre and that were he person concern perhap he should
be inclin to consid an altern site howev it wa a matter
for mr bull to decid
i hear that tombool will not be turn from hi purpos i hear that he
will still build hi hous upon thi rock so be it let him do so and
see but thi i sai that imba the floweret shall not be haunt by

man i repeat if we could see all hi heart we should know lot of
thing and understand more about these peopl than we do at present ha
it ever struck you mr bull how littl we white peopl do understand
of the black man soul perhap a child can see farther into it than
we can what is the sayinga littl child shall lead them is it
not perhap we do not make enough allow faith hope and chariti
these three but the greatest of these is charityor love which is
the same thing howev of cours you ar quit right not to have been
frighten by hi silli talk about the isitunzi it would never do to
show fear or hesit still i am glad that mr bull did not hear
it you mai have notic that she had gone on ahead and if i were you
i should not repeat it to her sinc ladi ar so nervou tabitha my
dear dont tell your mother anyth of all thi
no bishop answer tabitha i never tell her all the queer thing
that menzi sai to me when i meet him or at least not mani of them
i wish i had ask him if he had a cure for your local fever said the
bishop with a laugh for against it although i have taken so much that
my ear buzz quinin cannot prevail
he ha given me on in a gourd bishop repli tabitha
confidenti but i have never taken ani becaus you see i have had
no fever and i havent told mother for if i did she would tell father
thoma had stridden ahead and wa out of hear and he might be
angri becaus he doesnt like menzi though i do will you have some
bishop it is well cork up with clai and menzi said it would keep for
year

all sort of queer thing in mr menzi medicin still he told you to
drink it if necessari and i am absolut certain that he doe not
wish to poison you so perhap i might have a try for realli i feel
uncommonli ill
so later on with much secreci the gourd wa produc and the bishop
had a try by some strang coincid he felt so much better after it
that he beg for the rest of the stuff to comfort him on hi homeward
journei which ultim he accomplish in the best of health
that most admir and widemind prelat depart and so far as
histori record wa no more seen in sisaland but thoma remain
and set about the build of the hous with hi usual vigour upon the
death rock as it wa call in cours of time he erect an excel
and most servic dwell not too larg but larg enough have
everi comfort and conveni that hi local experi could suggest
and monei could suppli sinc in thi matter the chequebook of the
suffer dorca wa entir at hi servic
at length the hous wa finish and with much rejoic the bull
famili desert their squalid hut move into it at the commenc
of the hot season after the first agit of the chang and of the
arrang of the furnitur newlyarriv by wagon thei settl down
veri comfort direct all their energi toward the develop
of the garden which had alreadi been brought into some rough order
dure the build of the hous
on difficulti howev aros at onc for some mysteri reason thei
found that not a singl nativ servant would sleep in the place no not
even tabitha person attend who ador her everi soul of them
suddenli develop a sick mother or other rel who would instantli
expir if depriv of the comfort of their societi after dark or els
thei themselv becam ail at that hour sai thei could not sleep
upon a cliff like a rockrabbit
at ani rate for on caus or anoth off thei went the veri moment that
the sun vanish behind the western hill nor did thei reappear until
it wa well up abov those that face toward the east
at least thi happen for on night on the follow dai howev a
pleasantlook woman name ivana whom thei knew to be of good
reput though of doubt religion as sometim she came to church
and sometim she did not appear and offer her servic as
nightdogthat is what she call itto tabitha sai that she did
not mind sleep on a height sinc it wa inconveni to have no on
about the place from dark to dawn and dorca did not approv of tabitha
be left to sleep alon the woman whose charact wa guarante
by the chief kosa and the elder of the church wa taken on at an
indefinit wage to the matter of pecuniari reward inde she seem
to be entir indiffer
for the rest she roll herself in blanket nativ fashion and slept
across tabitha door keep so good a watch that onc when her father
wish to enter the room to fetch someth after the child wa sleep
she would not allow even him to do so when he tri to forc a wai past
her suddenli ivana becam so threaten that he thought she wa about
to spring at him after thi he want to dismiss her but dorca said
it onli show that she wa faith and that she had better be left
where she wa especi as there wa no on to take her place
so thing went on till the dai of full moon on that night ivana
appear to be much agit and insist that tabitha should go to bed
earlier than wa usual also after she wa asleep dorca notic that
ivana walk continu to and fro in front of the door of the child
room and up and down the veranda on to which it window open drone
some strang song and wave a wand
howev at the appoint hour have said their prayer dorca and
her husband went to bed
i wonder if there is anyth strang about thi place remark
dorca it is so veri odd that no nativ will stop here at night except
that halfwild ivana
oh i dont know repli thoma with a yawn real or feign these
peopl get all sort of idea into their silli head do stop twist
about and go to sleep
at last dorca did go to sleep onli to wake up again suddenli and with
great complet just as the church clock below struck three
the sound of which she suppos must have rous her the brilliant
moonlight flood the room and as for some reason she felt creepi and
disturb dorca tri to occupi her mind by reflect how comfort
it look with it new import furnish veri differ from that
horribl hut in which thei had live so long
then her thought drift to more gener matter she wa heartili
tire of sisaland and wish earnestli that her husband could get
a chang of station which the bishop had hint to her would not be
impossiblesomewher nearer to civilis ala he wa so obstin
that she fear noth would move him at ani rate until he had
convert menzi herd who were also obstin and remain as
heathen as ever inde why with their ampl mean should thei be
condemn to perpetu exil in these barbar place wa there not
plenti of work to be done at home where thei might make friend and
live decent
put herself and her own wish asid thi exist wa not fair to
tabitha who as she saw watch her with a mother ey wa becom
impregn with the nativ atmospher she who ought to be at a
christian school now talk more zulu than she did english and wa
begin to look at thing from the zulu point of view and to us their
idiom and metaphor even when speak her own tongu she had becom
a kind of littl chieftai among these folk also christian and
heathen alik inde now most of them spoke of her as the maiden
inkosikazi or chieftai and accept her slightest wish or order
as law which wa by no mean the case where dorca herself and even
thoma were concern
in fact on or twice thei had been driven to make a request through
the child notabl upon an import occas that had to do with the
transportrid of their furnitur to avoid it be left for a
coupl of month on the farther side of a flood river the detail
do not matter but what happen wa that when tabitha interven
that which had been declar to be imposs prove possibl and the
furnitur arriv with wonder celer moreov tabitha made no
request as dorca knew though she hid it from thoma she sent for the
headmen and when thei were seat on the ground befor her after their
fashion menzi among them issu an order sai
what ar my parent and i to live like dog without a kennel or cattl
that lack a winter kraal becaus you ar idl inspan the wagon and
fetch the thing or i shall be angri hambago
thereon thei rose and went without argument onli lift their
right hand abov their head and murmur ikosikaa umam
chieftai mother we hear you ye thei call tabitha mother
it wa all veri wrong thought dorca but she suppos be a piou
littl person that she must bear her burden and trust to provid to
free her from it and she close her ey to wipe awai a tear
when dorca open them again someth veri strang seem to have
happen she felt wide awak and yet knew that she must be dream
becaus the room had disappear there wa noth in sight except the
bare rock upon which the hous stood for instanc she could see the
gorg behind as it us to be befor thei made it into a garden for she
recognis some of the veri tree that thei had cut down moreov
from on of the cave at the end of it issu a process a horribl
process of fiercelook savag warrior with spear and
knobkerri who between them half drag half carri a young woman
and an elderli man
thei advanc thei pass within a few feet of her and observ
the condit of the woman and the man she saw that these must be led
becaus for a certain reason thei could not see where to gooh never
mind what she saw
the process reach the edg of the rock where the rail wa onli
now the rail had gone like the hous then for the first time dorca
heard for hitherto all had seem to happen in silenc
die umtakati die you wizard as the king command and feed the
riverdwel said a deep voic
there follow a struggl a horribl twist of shape and the
elderli man vanish over the cliff while a moment later from below
came the nois of a great splash
next the girl wa hale forward and the word of doom were repeat
she seem to break from her murder and stagger to the edg of the
precipic cry out
o father i come
then with on bloodcurdl shriek she vanish also and again
there follow the sound of a great splash that slowli echo itself to
silenc
all had pass awai leav dorca paralys with terror and wet with
it dew so that her nightgear clung to her bodi the room wa just
as it had been fill with the soft moonlight and look veri
comfort
thoma gasp hi wife wake up
i am awak he answer in hi deep voic which shook a littl i
have had a bad dream
what did you dream did you see two peopl thrown from the cliff
someth of that sort
oh thoma thoma i have been in hell thi place is haunt dont
talk to me of dream tabitha will have seen and heard too she will be
driven mad come to her
i think not answer thoma
still he came
at the door of tabitha room thei found the woman ivana wideei
solemn silent
have you seen or heard anyth ivana ask thoma
ye teacher she answer i have seen what i expect to see and
heard what i expect to hear on thi night of full moon but i am
guard and do not fear
the child the child said dorca
the inkosikazi imba sleep disturb her not
take no heed thei thrust past her into the room there on her littl
white bed lai tabitha fast asleep and look like an angel in her
sleep for a sweet smile plai about her mouth and while thei watch
she laugh in her dream then thei look at each other and went back
to their own chamber to spend the rest of the night as mai be imagin
next morn when thei emerg veri shaken and upset the first person
thei met wa ivana who wa wait for them with their coffe
i have a messag for you teacher and ladi never mind who send it i
have a messag for you to which you will do well to give heed sleep no
more in thi hous on the night of full moon though all other night
will be good for you onli the littl chieftai imba ought to sleep
in thi hous on the night of full moon
so inde it prove to be no suburban villa could have been more
commonplac and less disturb than wa their dwell for twentyseven
night of everi month but on the twentyeighth thei found a chang of
air desir onc it is true the stalwart thoma like ajax defi
the lightn or rather other thing that come from aboveor from
below but befor morn he appear at the hut beneath the koppi
announc that he had come to see how thei were get on and shake
as though he had a bout of fever
dorca ask him no question afterward she gather that he had
been favour with quit a new and veri vari midnight programm but
tabitha smile in her slow wai for tabitha knew all about thi busi
as she knew everyth that pass in sisaland moreov she laugh
at them a littl and said that she wa not afraid to sleep in the
missionhous on the night of full moon
what is more she did so which wa naughti of her for on on such
occas she slip back to the hous when her parent were asleep
follow onli by her nightdog the watch ivana and return
at dawn just as thei had discov that she wa miss sing and
laugh and jump from stone to stone with the agil of her own pet
goat
i slept beautifulli she cri and dream i wa in heaven all
night
thoma wa furiou and rate her till she wept then suddenli ivana
becam furiou too and rate him
should he be wrath with the littl chieftai imba she ask him
becaus the isitunzi the spirit of the dead love her as did
everyth els did thei not understand that the floweret wa unlik
them on ador of dead and live on to be cherish even in her
dream on whom heaven abov togeth with those who had gone
below built round with a wall of spellsand more of such talk
which thoma thought so horribl and blasphem that he fled befor it
torrent
but when he came back calmer he said no more to tabitha about her
escapad
it wa a long while afterward at the begin of the great drought
that anoth terribl thing happen on a certain calm and beauti
dai tabitha who still grew and flourish had taken some of the
christian children to a spot on the farther side of the koppi where
stood an old fortif origin built for purpos of defenc
here among the ancient wall with the assist of the nativ she
had made a kind of summerhous as children love to do and in thi
hous like some learn eastern pundit in a cell a veri pretti pundit
crown with a wreath of flower she sat upon the ground and instruct
the infant mind of sisaland
she wa suppos to be tell them bibl stori to prepar them
for their sundai school examin which inde she did with
embellish and in their own poetic and metaphor fashion the
particular tale upon which she wa engag by a strang coincid
wa that from the act which narrat how st paul wa bitten by a viper
upon the island of melita and how he shook it off into the fire and
took no hurt
he must have been like menzi said ivana who wa present whereon
tabitha other attend who wa also with her as it wa daytim
start an argument for be a christian she wa no friend to menzi
whom she call a dirti old witchdoctor
tabitha who wa us to these disput listen smile and while
she listen amus herself by try to thrust a stone into a hole in
the side of her summerhous which wa form by on of the origin
wall of the old kraal
present she utter a scream and snatch her arm out of the hole to
it or rather to her hand wa hang a great hood snake of the cobra
varieti such as the boer call ringhal she shook it off and the
reptil after sit up spit hiss and expand it hood
glide back into the wall tabitha sat still stare at her lacer
finger which ivana seiz and suck
then bid on of the oldest of the children to take her place
and continu suck ivana ran to a high rock a few yard awai which
overlook menzi kraal that lai upon a plain at a distanc of about a
quarter of a mile and call out in the low ring voic that kaffir
can command which carri to an enorm distanc

meanwhil the christian nurs had rush off over the crest of the
koppi to fetch thoma and dorca or either of them as it chanc she
met them both walk to join tabitha in her bower and thu it came
about that thei reach the place at the same moment as did old menzi
bound up the rock like a klipspring buck or a mountain sheep
hear him thoma turn in the narrow gatewai of the kraal and ask
wildli
what ha happen witchdoctor
thi ha happen whiteman answer menzi the floweret ha been
bitten by a hood snake and is about to die look at her and he

dorca look at tabitha she wa turn blue and her teeth were

then dorca fire up meeknatur though she wa and accustom though

rememb the goat i will not see my child die as a sacrific to your
pride
i have made up my mind answer thoma if she di it is so
decre and the spell and filth of a heathen cannot save her
dorca tri to thrust him asid with her feebl strength but big and
burli he stood in the path like a rock block the wai with the
stone entranc wall of the littl pleasurehous on either side of him
suddenli the old zulu menzi becam rather terribl he drew himself
up he seem to swell in size hi thin face grew set and fierc
out of the path whiteman he said or by chaka head i will kill
you and from somewher he produc a long thinblad knife of nativ
iron fix on a buck horn
kill on wizard shout thoma kill if you can
listen said dorca if our daughter di becaus of you then i have
done with you we part for ever do you understand
ye i understand he answer heavili so be it
tabitha behind them made some convuls nois thoma turn and look
at her she wa slowli sink down upon her side hi face chang all
the rage and obstinaci went out of it
my child oh my child he cri i cannot bear thi love is
stronger than all when i come up for judgment mai it be rememb
that love is stronger than all
then he step out of the gatewai and sat down upon a stone hide hi
ey with hi hand
menzi threw down the knife and leapt in follow by hi servant who
bore hi medicin and the woman ivana he did hi offic he utter
hi spell and invoc he rub dawa into the wound and prise
open the child clench teeth thrust more of it a great deal more
down her throat while all three of them rub her cold limb
about half an hour afterward he came out of the place follow by
ivana who carri tabitha in her strong arm tabitha wa veri weak
but smile and with the colour return to her cheek of thoma he
took no notic but to dorca he said
ladi i give you back your daughter she is save let her drink milk
and sleep
then thoma whose judgment and chariti were shaken for a while spoke
sai
as a man and a father i thank you witchdoctor but know that as a
priest i swear that i will never have more to do with you who i am
sure by your art can command these reptil to work your will and
have plan all thi to shame me no not even if you lai dy would i
come to visit you
thu storm thoma in hi wrath and humili believ that he had
been the victim of a plot and not know that he would live bitterli to
regret hi word
i see that you hate me teacher said menzi and though here i do not
find the gentl you preach i do not wonder it is quit
natur were i you i should do the same but you ar littl flower
fatherstrang that she should have grown from such a seedand though
we fight for that reason i cannot hate you be not disturb perhap
it wa the suck of the wound and the grass ti round her finger
which save her not my spell and medicin no no i cannot hate you
although we fight for masteri and you pelt me with vile word sai
that i charm a deadli immamba to bite littl flower whom i love
that i might cure her and make a mock of you yet i do hate that snake
which bit the maiden imba of it own wicked the hood immamba
that you believ to be my familiar and it shall die man here he
turn to hi servant and you ivana and the other pull down that
wall
thei leapt to do hi bid and present discov the ringhal in
it hole heedless of it fang and writh menzi sprang at it with
a zulu curs and seiz it proceed to kill it in a veri slow and
cruel fashion
vi
the great drought fell upon sisaland like a curs from heaven for
month after month the sun beat fierc the sky wa as brass and no
rain fell even the dew seem to depart the spring dri up the
river ukufa the river call death ceas to flow so that water
could onli be found in it deepest hollow the pool beneath the rock
of evildo the death rock sank till the bone of those who had been
murder there mani year befor appear as the crocodil had left
them cattl di becaus there wa no grass cow ceas to give their
milk even where thei could be partial fed and water so that the
littl children di also even in the dampest situat the crop
wither till at last it becam certain that unless rain fell within a
month befor anoth cold season had gone by there would be starvat
everywher for the drought wa widespread and therefor corn could not
be sent from other district even if there were cattl to draw it
everi dai thoma put up prayer for rain in the church and on two
occas held special servic for thi purpos these were better
attend than ani other had ever been becaus hi congreg felt
that the matter wa extrem urgent affect them all and that now
wa the time when whatev happen to the heathen good christian
like themselv should be reward
howev thi did not chanc sinc the drought went on as fierc as
befor
menzi wa of cours a raindoctor a heavenherd of the highest
distinct on who it wa reput could by hi magic caus the
most brazen sky to melt in tear hi servic had been call in by
neighbour tribe with the result it wa rumour that those tribe
had been reward with partial shower also with great ceremoni he had
gone through hi rite for the benefit of the heathen section of the
sisa peopl behold by some curiou accid on the follow dai
a thunderstorm had come up and with it a short delug of rain which
suffic to make it certain that the crop in those field on which it
fell would keep aliv at ani rate for a while
but mark what happen as is not uncommon in the case of thunder
shower thi rain fell upon the land which the heathen cultiv on
on side of the koppi wherea those that belong to the christian
section upon the other side receiv not a singl drop the unjust were
bedew the just were left dry as bone all that thei receiv wa the
lightn which kill an old man on of the best christian in the
place the limit of the torrent might have been mark off with a line
when it had pass to the heathen right stood pool of water to the
christian left there wa noth but blow dust
now these christian weakkne some of them began to murmur
especi those who have pass through a similar experi in
their youth rememb what starvat meant in that countri religion
thei reflect wa all veri well but without meali thei could
not live and without kaffir corn there would be no beer inde
metaphor befor long thei pass from murmur to shout
and their shout said thi menzi must be invit to celebr a
rainservic in hi own fashion for the benefit of the entir tribe
thoma argu in vain he grew angri he call them name which
doubtless thei deserv he said that thei were spiritu outcast by
thi time be frantic hi flock did not care what he said either
menzi must come thei explain or thei would turn heathen the great
on in the sky could work as well through menzi as through him tombool
or anybodi els menzi must come
thoma threaten to excommun them all a menac which did not
amount to much as thei were alreadi excommun themselv and when
thei remain obstin told them that he would have noth to do with
thi rainmak busi which wa unholi and repugn to him he
told them moreov that he wa certain that their wicked would
bring some judgment upon them in which he prove to be right
the end of it wa that menzi wa summon and arriv with a triumphant
smile sai that he wa certain he could put everyth in order and
that soon thei would have plenti of rain that is if thei all attend
hi invoc and made him present suitabl to so great an occas
the result wa that thei did attend them man woman and child seat
in a circl in that same old kraal where the witchdoctor had so
marvel shown pictur upon the smoke each of them also brought
hi gift in hi hand or if it were a live thing drove it befor
him
thoma went down and address them in the midst of a sullen silenc
call them wick and repeat hi belief that thei would bring a
judgment on their own head thei who were worship baal and make
offer to hi priest
after he had talk himself hoars menzi said mildli that if the
teacher tombool had finish he would get to busi why should the
teacher be angri becaus he menzi offer to do what the teacher could
notsav the land from starv and as for the gift to himself did
not white teacher also receiv pai and offer at certain feast
then make a gestur of despair thoma return to hi hous and
with dorca and tabitha watch the savag ceremoni from the edg of
the cliff that overhung the river or rather what had been the river
he could not see much of it becaus thei were too far awai but he
perceiv those apost christian prostrat themselv at menzi
order probabl he reflect to make prayer to the devil in fact
thei were not do thi but onli repeat menzi magic chant with
appropri gestur as for countless ag their forefath had done
upon similar occas
next an unfortun black goat wa drag forward by the horn a veri
thin black goat and it throat wa cut over a littl fire a sacrific
that suggest necrom of the most satan sort
after thi thoma and hi famili went back into the hous and shut the
window that thei might not hear the unholi shout of the misguid
mob when thei went out again menzi had depart and so had the other
the place wa empti
the follow dai wa sundai and thoma lock the church on the
inner side and read the servic with dorca and tabitha for sole
congreg it wa a melancholi busi for some sens of evil
seem to hang over all three of them also over everybodi els for the
christian went about with deject look and not on person spoke to
them onli ivana came at night as usual to sleep with tabitha though
even she said noth
next morn thei woke up to find the heaven black with cloud heavi
omin cloud the truth be that the drought wa draw to it
natur end thoma note thi and reflect bitterli how hard it wa
that thi end should not have come twentyfour hour earlier but so
event had been decre and he wa helpless
by middai it began to rain lightli at first and from hi rock he could
see the peopl look unnatur and distort in that strang gloom
for the cloud had descend almost to the earth rush about hold
out their hand as though to clasp the bless moistur and talk
excitedli on to the other soon thei were driven into their hut for
the rain turn into a kind of waterspout never had such rain been
known in sisaland
all that afternoon it pour and all the night with everincreas
violenc ye and all the follow morn so that by noon
thomass raingaug show that over twelv inch had fallen in about
twentyfour hour and it wa still rain water rush down from the
koppi even their wellbuilt hous could not keep out the wet and to
the despair of dorca sever of the room were flood and some of
the new furnitur wa spoil the river beneath had becom a rage
torrent and wa rise everi hour alreadi it wa over it bank and
the water had got into the hut of the chief kraal and the villag
round it so that their occup were oblig to seek safeti upon the
lower rock of the koppi where thei sat shiver in the wet
night came at last and through the dark thei heard cri as of
peopl in distress the long hour wore awai till dawn a melancholi

bitter for as he went it came into hi mind that thi must be a
farewel to that cherish church rear with so much love cost and

outsid the build on a patch of higher land an upthrown plateau of
rock where present all gather beyond the reach of the water stood
menzi and tabitha thoma look at him and said
doubtless you think that your spell have work well witchdoctor
for see the ruin about us yet i hold otherwis and sai wait till the

the place where it had been it collaps and the nois of it were
terribl so terribl that the christian gather on the rock utter
a heartrend wail of woe the spire be built upon a deeper bed
becaus of it weight stood longer than the rest of the fabric but
present it went also
thrice it seem to bow toward them then it fell like a child
castl reckon it height with hi ey thoma saw that it could not
reach them where thei stood and so did the other therefor no on
stir as the tower collaps the clock sound the first stroke of
the hour then suddenli becam silent for ever and vanish beneath the
water a mass of broken metal
but the bell on which it had struck wa hurl forward by the swai of
the fall like a stone from a sling it sped toward them through the
air a great dark object men ran thi wai and that so that it fell
upon the rock where none stood it fell it flew to piec like an
explod shell and it fragment hurtl over them with a scream
sound yet as it chanc the tongu or clapper of it took a lower
cours perhap becaus it wa heavier and rush onward like a
thrown spear struck menzi full upon the chest crush in hi breast
bone
thei bore him up to the missionhous sinc there wa nowher els
whither he could be taken here thei laid him on a bed leav the
woman ivana to watch him for thei had no skill to deal with such
injuri as hi inde thei thought him dead
for a long while menzi lai senseless but after night had fallen hi
mind return to him and he bade ivana bring tabitha to him tabitha and
no on els if she could not or would not come then ivana must bring
no on els for if she did he would curs her and die at onc
there were discuss and remonstr but in the end tabitha wa
allow to go for after all a fellowcreatur wa dy and thi wa
hi last wish she came and menzi receiv her smile ye he smile
and salut her with shake but uplift arm name her inkosikazi
and umam or mother
welcom maiden imba welcom littl flower he said i wish to sai
goodby to you and to bless you also to endow you with my spirit that
it mai guard you throughout your life till you ar as i am i have hate
some of the other but i have alwai love you littl flower
and i have love you too menzi said tabitha with a sob
i know i know we witchdoctor read heart but do not weep littl
flower why should you for such as i a black man a mere savag cheat
as your father name me yet i have not been altogeth a cheat o imba
though sometim i us trick like other doctor for i have a strength
of my own which your white peopl will never understand becaus thei
ar too young to understand it onli come to the old folk who have
been sinc the begin of the world and remain as thei were at the
begin i have been wick littl flower accord to your white
law i have kill men and done mani other thing that ar accord to
the law of my own peopl and by that law i look for judgment yet o
imba i will sai thisthat i believ your law to be higher and better
than my law ha it not been shown todai sinc of all that were
gather on the rock yonder i alon wa struck down and in the hour of
my victori the strongest law must be the best law is it not so tell
me littl flower would it pleas you if i di a christian
ye veri much said tabitha fix upon thi point at onc and by
instinct avoid all the other veri doubt disput i will
bring my father
nai nai littl flower your father the teacher tombool swore in hi
wrath that he would not come to visit me even if i lai dy and now
that i am dy he shall keep hi oath and repent of it dai by dai till
he too is dy if i am to die a christian you must make me on thi
moment you and no other otherwis i go henc a heathen as i have
live if you bring your father here i will die at onc befor he can
touch me as i have power to do
then tabitha who although so young had strength and understand and
knew if she thwart him that menzi would do as he threaten took
water and made a certain sign upon the brow of that old witchdoctor
utter also certain word that she had often heard us in church at
baptism
perhap she wa wrong perhap she transgress and took too much upon
her still be by natur courag she ran the risk and did these
thing as afterward ivana testifi to the follow of menzi
thank you littl flower said menzi i do not suppos that thi
christian magic will do me ani good but that you wish it is enough
it will be a rope to tie us togeth littl flower also i have anoth
thought when it is known that i becam a christian at the last then if
you bid them littl flower the heathenherd will follow where the
bull menzi went befor them thei ar but broken sherd and scorch
stick ie rubbish but thei will follow and that will pleas you
littl flower and your father also
here menzi breath fail but recov it he continu
hearken o imba i give my peopl into your hand now let your hand
bend the twig as you would have it grow make them christian if you
will or leav them heathen if you will i care noth thei ar your
to drive upon whatev path you choos to set their feet your o
imba not tombool also i who lack heir give you my cattl all of
them ivana make known my word and with them the curs of menzi the
king child the umazisi the seer on ani who dare to disobei sai
to those of my hous and to my peopl that henceforth the maiden imba is
their ladi and their mother
again he paus a littl then went on
now i charg my spirit to watch over you littl flower till you die
and we come to talk over these matter otherwher and my spirit as it
depart tell me that it will watch well and that you will be a veri
happi woman littl flower
he shut hi ey and lai still a while then he open them again and
said
o imba tell your father the teacher tombool from me that he doe not
understand us black peopl whom he think so common as you understand
us littl flower and that he would be wise to go to minist to white
on
after thi onc more he smile at tabitha and then shut hi ey again
for the last time and that wa the end of the witchdoctor menzi
it mai be ad that after he had rebuilt the church for the second
time and number all the menziherd among hi congreg which he
did now that the bull of the herd wa dead as menzi had foretold that
he would if tabitha whom he had wrap with hi blanket decre
it thoma took the sage advic of hi depart enemi
now in the after year he is the must respect if somewhat fear
bishop of white settler in a remot dominion of the crown
thoma todai know more than he us to know but on thing he ha
never learn name that it wa the hand of a maid ye the littl
hidden hand of tabitha that drove all menzi herd into the gate of
the heavenli kraal as some of them name hi church
for tabitha knew when to be silent perhap the kaffir whose mind she
could read as an open book taught her thi or perhap it wa on of
the best gift to her of old menzi spirit into whose care he pass
her with so much formal
thi is the stori of the great fight between thoma bull the missionari
and menzi the witchdoctor who wa led by hi love of a littl child
whither he never wish to go not for hi own soul sake but just
becaus of that littl child
menzi did not care about hi soul but be so strang a man for some
reason that he never explain for tabitha hi littl flower he
care veri much inde that wa why he becam a christian at the last
sinc in hi darken spellbound heart he believ that if he did not
when she too went down he would never find her again
onli a dream
footprintsfootprintsth footprint of on dead how ghastli thei
look as thei fall befor me up and down the long hall thei go and i
follow them pit pat thei fall those unearthli step and beneath
them start up that aw impress i can see it grow upon the marbl a
damp and dread thing
tread them down tread them out follow after them with muddi shoe
and cover them up in vain see how thei rise through the mire who can
tread out the footprint of the dead
and so on up and down the dim vista of the past follow the sound of
the dead feet that wander so restlessli stamp upon the impress that
will not be stamp out rave on wild wind etern voic of human
miseri fall dead footstep etern echo of human memori stamp miri
feet stamp into forget that which will not be forgotten

esteem it wa veri differ when i marri my first wife i rememb
but then that match wa not satisfactoryjust a lovematch no more

the cream jug and the electropl urn will hiss awai behind them
both also the chase sugar basin will be in front full of sugar and
behind everyth will be my second wife
my dear she will sai will you have anoth cup of tea and
probabl i shall have anoth cup
well it is veri curiou to notic what idea will come into a man

unexpect moment thei come and he grow awar of the issu of
hi mysteri life and hi heart shake and shiver like a
lightningshatt tree in that drear light all earthli thing seem
far and all unseen thing draw near and take shape and aw him and he
know not what is true and what is fals neither can he trace the edg
that mark off the spirit from the life then it is that the footstep

great rush of air snatch it from my hand and swept it wide the black
cloud had broken a littl overhead and there wa a patch of blue
rainwash sky with just a star or two glimmer in it fitfulli for
a moment i could onli see thi bit of sky but by degre i made out the
accustom outlin of the great tree swing furious against it
and the rigid line of the cope of the garden wall beneath them then a
whirl leaf hit me smartli on the face and instinct i drop

everi part of thi veil and dress the water fell in heavi drop
the figur bore a small basket on her left arm and her handsuch a
poor thin littl handgleam white in the moonlight i notic that
on the third finger wa a red line show that a weddingr had
onc been there the other hand wa stretch toward me as though in
entreati

far to see you and i cannot stop look look and she began to pluck
feverishli with her poor thin hand at the black veil that enshroud
her at last it came off and as in a dream i saw what in a dim frozen
wai i had expect to seeth white face and pale yellow hair of my
dead wife unabl to speak or to stir i gaze and gaze there wa no
mistak about it it wa she ay even as i had last seen her white

that pool with the old on my left foot would be wet through now let
me thank god for these new boot oh how can i when i rememb that
the price of them should have been spent in milk for the poor babi if
i were realli a christian i ought to take them off and walk barefoot
as the old pilgrim us to do thei sai it is healthi and i tri

he stumbl on for a hundr yard or more vacuous almost drunkenli
for the hideou agoni that he wa endur half paralys hi brain and
by it veri excess wa bring him some temporari relief he look at
the rage sea to hi right and in a vagu fashion wish that it had
swallow him he look at the kind earth of the plough field to hi

he had found a plover nest with two egg in it fifti year ago when
he wa a boi and had taken on egg and left the other or rather had
restor it becaus the old bird scream so pitifulli about him in
some strang manner that littl longforgotten act of righteous

deal so by him
in it wai the even wa veri beauti the cold novemb dai wa
dy into night clear clear wa the sky save for some black and heavi
snow cloud that float on it driven befor the easterli wind that
pipe through the sere grass and blew the plover over him as though
thei were dead leav where the sun had vanish long bar of purpl
lai abov the horizon to hi excit fanci thei look like the gatewai
of anoth and a better world set as the old egyptian dream abov
the uttermost pylon of the west what lai there beyond the sun oh
what lai beyond the sun perhap even now barbara knew
a figur appear stand upon a sand dune between the pathwai and the
sea septimu wa shortsight and could not tell who it wa but in
thi place at thi hour doubtless it must be a parishion perhap

that a pug tail wa so long when it is quit uncurl but the footman

the red dragon and left the pug outsid
and here endeth aunt maria and all her work said anthoni who want
to talk of other thing

in fact she went on so far as im concern it ought to run here
beginneth aunt maria you see i have got to go and live with her

who have half live upon her alm and old cloth for so mani year
and in short dad and my mother thought it best that i should go sinc
joyc can take my place and at ani rate it will be a mouth less to feed

rememb that the rest of us had to walk barefoot in the mud and snow
becaus there wa no monei to bui us boot and onli some of us could
go out at onc becaus we had no cloak to put on well all thi mai

we have if my father di anthoni or even wa taken ill and he is
not veri strong what would becom of us unless aunt thompson chose to

that i love you that i have alwai love you and that i alwai shall
love you untiluntilth moon ceas to shine and he point to that
orb which had appear abov the sea
thei sai that it is dead alreadi and no doubt will come to an end like
everyth els remark barbara seek to gain time
then for a while she sought noth more who found herself lost in her
lover arm
so there thei plight their troth that wa thei swore more endur
than the moon for inde thei so believ
noth shall part us except death he said
why should death part us she answer look him brave in the
ey i mean to live beyond death and while i live and wherev i live
death shall not part us if youll be true to me
ill not fail in that he answer
and so their soul melt into raptur and were lift up beyond the
world the song of the nightingal wa heavenli music in their ear
and the moon silver rai upon the sea were the road by which their
link soul travel to the throne of him who had lit their lamp of
love and there made petit that through all life accid and
death dark it might burn etern
for the love of these two wa deep and faith and alreadi seem to
them as though it were a thing thei had lost awhil and found onc
more a veri preciou jewel that from the begin had shone upon their
breast a guidingstar to light them to that end which is the dawn of
endless
who will not smile at such thought as these
the wai of the man with the maid and the wai of the maid with the man
and the moon to light them and the bird to sing the epithalamium of
their heart and the great sea to murmur of etern in their open
ear natur at her sweet work beneath the gentl nightwho is there
that will not sai that it wa noth more

chapter iv

of the arriv of thi morn caller
the man bow and depart and as he went barbara notic an omin
twinkl in the pleasant blue ey of the hon charl russel
the rest of the interview mai be sum up in a few word mr russel
wa eloqu passion and convinc he assur barbara that she wa
the onli woman he had ever love with such forc and convict that in
the end she almost believ him but thi belief if it exist did not
in the least shake her absolut definit determin to have noth
whatsoev to do with her wouldb lover

of five energet young sister who nearli devour her with kiss
so happi wa that greet inde that in it she almost forgot her
sorrow in truth as she reflect why should she be sorri at all
she wa clear of a suitor whom she did not wish to marri and of an aunt
whose veri kind wa oppress and whose temper wa terribl she
had fifti pound in her pocket and a good stock of cloth to sai
noth of the pearl and other jewelleri wealth inde if measur by

the reverend septimu shook hi head sadli he wa not a worldlymind
man still to have a presumpt peer for a soninlaw who would
doubtless also becom an ambassador wa a prospect that at heart he
relinquish with regret also thi young arnott busi seem veri
vagu and unsatisfactori and there were the other girl and their
futur to be consid no wonder then that he shook hi kindli grei
head and look somewhat depress

heart and you see barbara is a woman now onc you rememb i had
to face someth of the same sort and i do not think dear

chapter v
wed
next dai oh joi of joi barbara and anthoni met onc more after some
fifteen month of separ anthoni wa now in hi twentyfourth
year a fine young man with wellcut featur brown ey and a pleasant
smile muscularli too he wa veri strong as wa shown by hi athlet
record at cambridg whether hi strength extend to hi constitut
wa anoth matter mr walrond notic hi unvari colour which
she thought unduli high and the transpar charact of hi skin
spoke to her husband upon the matter
in hi turn septimu spoke to the old local doctor who shrug
hi shoulder and remark that the arnott had been delic for
gener lungi he call it notic that mr walrond look
seriou and know someth of how matter stood between anthoni and
barbara he hasten to add that so far as he knew there wa no caus
for alarm and that if he were moder care he thought that
anthoni would live to eighti
but it is otherwis with hi brother he ad significantli and for
the matter of that with the old man also
then he went awai and there wa someth in the manner of hi
go which seem to suggest that he did not wish to continu the
convers
from anthoni howev barbara soon learn the truth as to hi brother
hi lung were gone for the chill he took in the crimea had settl on
them and now there wa left to him but a littl time to live thi wa
sad new and mar the happi of their meet sinc both of them
were far too unworldli to consid it effect upon their own prospect
or that it would make easi that which had hitherto seem imposs
ar you nurs him she ask
ye more or less i took him to the south of england for two month
but it did no good
i am glad the thing is not catch she remark glanc at him
oh no he repli carelessli i never heard that it wa catch
though some peopl sai it run in famili i hope not i am sure as
the poor old chap insist upon my sleep in hi room whenev i am at
home as we us to do when we were boi
then their talk wander elsewher for thei had so much to sai to each
other that it seem doubt if thei would ever get to the end of it
all anthoni wa particularli anxiou to learn what bless circumst
had caus barbara sudden reappear at eastwich she fenc for a
while then told him all the truth
so you gave up thi brilliant marriag for me a fellow with scarc a
halfpenni and a veri few prospect he exclaim stare at her
of cours what would you have expect me to domarri on man while
i love anoth as for the rest it must take it chanc and while the
word were on her lip for the first time it came into barbara mind
that perhap anthoni had no need to troubl about hi worldli fortun
for if it were inde true that captain arnott wa doom who els
would succe to the estat
i think you ar an angel he said still overcom by thi wondrou
instanc of fidel and of courag in the face of ladi thompson
anger
if i had done anyth els i think anthoni that you might veri well
have call mewhatev is the revers of an angel
and thu the link of their perfect love were drawn even closer than
befor
onli three dai later mr walrond wa summon hastili to the hall when
he return from hi ministr it wa to announc in a sad voic
that captain arnott wa sink fast befor the follow morn he
wa dead
a month or so after the grave had close over captain arnott the
engag of anthoni and barbara wa announc formal and by
the express wish of mr arnott the old gentleman had for year been
partial paralys and in a delic state of health which the
sad loss of hi elder son had done much to render wors he sent for
barbara whom he had known from her childhood and told her that the
sooner she and anthoni were marri the better he would be pleas
you see my dear he ad i do not wish the old name to die out
after we have been in thi place for three hundr year and you
walrond ar a healthi stock which is more than we can sai now worn
out i suppos worn out in fact he went on look at her sharpli
it is for you to consid whether you care to take the risk of come
into thi famili for whatev the doctor mai or mai not sai i think
it my duti to tell you straight out that in my opinion there is some
risk
if so i do not fear it mr arnott and i hope you will not put ani
such idea into anthoni head if you do he might refus to marri me
and that would break my heart
no i dare sai you do not fear it but there ar otherwel thing
must take their cours if we were alwai think of the futur no on
would dare to stir
then he told her that when first he heard of their mutual attach he
had been much disturb as he did not see how thei were to marri
but poor georg death ha chang all that he said sinc now
anthoni will get the estat which is practic the onli properti we
have and it ought alwai to produc enough to keep you go and to
maintain the place in a modest wai
lastli he present her with a valuabl set of diamond that had
belong to hi mother sai he might not be aliv to do so when the
time of her marriag came and dismiss her with hi bless
in due cours all these tide includ that of the diamond came
to the ear of aunt thompson and wondrous soften that ladi anger
inde she wrote to barbara in veri affection term to wish her
everi happi and sai how glad she wa to hear that she wa settl
herself so well in life she ad that she should make a point of be
present at the wed a postscript inform her that mr russel wa
about to be marri to an italian countess a widow
barbara wed wa fix for octob at the begin of that month
howev anthoni wa seiz with some unaccount kind of ill in
which cough plai a consider part so sever were it effect
that it wa thought desir to postpon the ceremoni the doctor
order him awai for a chang of air on the morn of hi departur he
spoke serious to barbara
i dont know what is the matter with me he said and i dont think
it is veri much at present but dear i have a kind of presenti
that i am go to becom an invalid my strength is noth like
what it wa and at time it fail me in a most unaccount manner
barbara it break my heart to sai it but i doubt whether you ought to
marri me
if you were go to be a perman invalid which i do not believ for
on moment answer barbara steadili you would want a nurs and who
could nurs you so well as your wife therefor unless you had ceas to
care for me i should certainli marri you
then as still he seem to hesit she flung her arm about him and
kiss him which wa an argument that he lack strength to resist
a dai or two afterward her father also spoke to barbara
i dont like thi ill of anthoni my dear the doctor doe not
seem to understand it or at ani rate so he pretend and sai he ha
no doubt it will pass off but i cannot help rememb the case of hi
brother georg also that of hi mother befor him in short barbara
do you thinkwel that it would be wise to marri him i know that
to break it off would be dread but you see health is so veri
import
barbara turn on her father almost fierc
whose health she ask if you mean mine it is in no danger and if
it were i should care noth what good would health be to me if i lost
anthoni who is more to me than life but if you mean hi health then
the greatest happi i can have is to nurs him
ye ye i understand dear but you see there might beother
if so father thei must run their risk as we do that is if there ar
ani risk for them to run which i doubt
i dare sai you ar quit right dear inde i feel almost sure that
you ar right onli i thought it my duti to mention the matter which i
hope you will forgiv me for have done and now i mai tell you i have
a letter from anthoni sai that he is ever so much better and ask
if the fifteenth of novemb will suit us for the wed
on the fifteenth of novemb accordingli anthoni and barbara were made
man and wife by the bride father with the assist of the clergyman
of the next parish ow to the recent death of the bridegroom
brother and the condit of mr arnott health the wed wa
extrem quiet still in it own wai it wa as charm as it wa
happi all her five sister act as barbara bridesmaid and mani
gather in that church said thei were the most beauti bevi of
maiden that ever had been seen but if so barbara outshon them all
perhap becaus of her jewel and fine cloth and the radianc on her
love face
anthoni who seem to be quit well again also look extrem
handsom while aunt thompson who by now had put off her mourn
shone in that dim church as the sun shine through a morn mist
in short all went as merrili as it should save that the bride mother
seem depress and wept a littl
thi said her sister to someon in a loud voic wa in her opinion
noth short of wick what busi she ask ha a woman with
six portionless daughter to cry becaus on of them is make a good
marriag though it is true she ad drop her voic to a
confidenti whisper that had barbara chosen she might have made a
better on ye i dont mind tell you that she might have been a
peeress instead of the wife of a mere countri squir
in truth mr walrond wa ill at eas about thi marriag why she
did not know someth in her heart seem to tell her that her dear
daughter happi would not be of long continu bear in mind
hi famili histori she fear for anthoni health inde she fear
a hundr thing that she wa quit unabl to defin howev at the
littl breakfast which follow she seem quit to recov her spirit
and laugh as merrili as anyon at the speech which ladi thompson
insist upon make in which she describ barbara as her darl
beauti and most accomplish niec who inde wa almost her
daughter
chapter vi
part
hard inde would it be to find a happier marriag than that of anthoni
and barbara thei ador each other never a shadow came between them
almost might it be said that their thought were on thought and their
heart on heart it is common to hear of twin soul but how often ar
thei to be met with in the actual experi of life here howev
thei realli might be found or so it would seem had thei been on
ancient entiti divid long ago by the work of fate and now brought
togeth onc more through the power of an overmast attract
their union could not have been more complet to the ey of the
observ and inde to their own ey it show neither seam nor flaw
thei were on and indivis
about such happi as thi there is someth alarm someth
omin mr walrond felt it from the first and thei the two person
concern felt it also
our joi frighten me said anthoni to barbara on dai i feel like
that persian monarch who threw hi most treasur ring into the sea
becaus he wa too fortun you rememb the sea refus the offer
for the royal cook found it in the mouth of a fish
then dear he wa doubli fortun for he made hi sacrific and kept
hi ring
anthoni see that barbara had never heard the stori and it end
did not tell it to her but she read someth of what wa pass in
hi mind as veri often she had the power to do
dearest she said earnestli i know what you think you think that
such happi as our will not be allow to last for long that
someth evil will overtak us well it mai be so but if it is at
least we shall have had the happi which have been will remain
for ever a part of you a part of me a templ of our love not built
with hand in which we shall offer thank etern here andbeyond
and she nod toward the glori of the sunset sky then turn and
kiss him
as it chanc that cruel devour sea which rage at the feet of
all mankind wa destin er long to take the offer that wa most
preciou to these two onli thi wa flung to it water not by their
hand but by that of fate nor did it return to them again
after their marriag anthoni and barbara hire a charm littl
georgian hous at chelsea near to the river the drawback to
the dwell wa that it stood quit close to a place of public
entertain call the garden veri well known in those dai as
the nightli haunt of person who were not alwai as respect as thei
might have been dure their sojourn in london thei never enter these
garden but often in the summer even thei pass them when out for
the walk which thei took togeth sinc anthoni spent most of hi dai
at the templ studi law in the chamber of a lead barrist thu
their somewhat fantast gatewai becam impress upon barbara mind
as did the charact of the peopl who frequent them as howev
their proxim reduc the rent of their own and neighbour hous
by about onehalf person thei were grate to these garden sinc
the nois of the band and the danc did not troubl them much and
those who danc could alwai be avoid
when thei had been marri nearli a year a littl daughter wa born to
them a sweet babi with violet ey like to those of barbara now inde
their bliss wa complet but it wa not fate that it should remain
sinc the hungri sea took it sacrific the summer wa veri hot in
london and mani infant sicken there of some infantil complaint
among them their own child like hundr of other it di when onli a
few month old and left them desol
perhap anthoni wa the more crush of the two sinc here barbara
vivid faith came to her aid
we have onli lost her for a littl while she said choke back her
tear as she laid some flower on the littl grave we shall find her
again i know that we shall find her again and meanwhil she will be
happier than she could have been with us in thi sad world
then thei walk back home push their wai through the paint crowd
that were gather at the gate of the garden and listen to the
strain of the gai music that jar upon their ear
in due cours have been call to the bar anthoni enter the
chamber of an emin common law leader although hi prospect
were now good and he wa er long like to be independ of the
profess he wa anxiou to follow it and make a name and fortun for
himself thi inde he would have found littl difficulti in do
sinc soon he show that he had studi to good purpos moreov hi
gift were decidedli forens he spoke well and without nervous
hi memori wa accur and hi mind logic moreov he had someth
of that imagin and sympathet power which bring an advoc
success with juri
alreadi he had been entrust with a few case which he held as devil
for somebodi els when two event happen which between them brought
hi career as a lawyer to an end in the novemb after the death of
their babi hi father suddenli di on receiv the new of hi fatal
ill anthoni hurri to eastwich without even return home to
fetch a warm coat and as a result took a sever cold dure the winter
follow the funer thi cold settl on hi lung at last toward
the spring the crisi came he wa taken serious ill and on hi
partial recoveri sever doctor held a consult over him their
verdict wa that he must give up hi profess which fortun now
he wa in a posit to do live in the countri and as much in the open
air as possibl spend the worst month of the winter either in the
south of england or in some warmer land these grave and learn men
told him outright that hi lung were serious attack and that he
must choos between follow their advic and a speedi departur from
the world
anthoni would have defi them for that wa hi natur he wish to
go on with hi work and take the risk but barbara persuad him to
obedi she said she agre with him that the matter of hi health
wa greatli exagger at the same time she point out that as thei
were now veri well off she saw no reason why he should continu to slave
at a profess which might or might not bring him an adequ return
fifteen or twenti year later she ad that person she detest
london and would like noth better than to live at eastwich near her
own peopl also she show him that hi rather extens estat need
person attent and could be much improv in valu if he were there
to care for it
the end mai be guess anthoni gave up the bar and the hous in
chelsea after stai at torquai for a few of the winter month
where hi health improv enorm thei move to eastwich dure the
follow mai here their welcom wa warm inde not onli from the
rectori parti who rejoic to have barbara back among them but from
the entir neighbourhood includ the tenant and labour on the
properti
the ensu summer wa on of the happiest of their marri life
anthoni becam so much better that barbara began to believ he had
thrown off hi lung weak certain repair and rearrang of
their old elizabethan hous agreeabl occupi their time and to crown
all on christma ev barbara gave birth to a son an extraordinarili
fine and vigor child redhair blueei and so far as could be
seen at that earli ag entir unlik either of hi parent
the old doctor who usher him into the world remark that he had never
seen a more splendid and perfect boi nor on who appear to possess a
robust constitut
in due cours mr walrond christen him by the name of anthoni after
hi father and a dinner wa given to the tenant and labour in
honour of the event
that same month there be a dearth of suitabl men with an adequ
knowledg of the law anthoni who alreadi wa a magistr though so
young wa elect a deputychairman of quarter session for hi counti
thi local honour pleas him veri much sinc now he knew that
hi legal educ would not be wast and that he would have an
opportun of turn it to us as a judg of minor case
yet thi grate and conciliatori appoint in the end brought him
evil and not good the first quarter session at which he wa call
upon to presid in on of the court fell in februari when he ought
to have been out of the east of england the calendar wa heavi and
anthoni acquit himself veri well in the trial of some difficult
case earn the compliment of all concern but on leav the hot
court after a long dai he caught a heavi cold which awok hi latent
complaint and from that time forward he began to go down hill
still watch fought against by barbara it progress wa slow the
winter month thei spent in warmer climat onli resid in eastwich
from mai to novemb dure the summer anthoni occupi himself on
matter connect with the estat and princip with the cultiv
of the home farm inde as time went on and increas weak forc
him to withdraw himself more and more from the world and it affair
the interest of thi farm loom ever larger in hi ey as larg
inde as though he depend upon it alon for hi daili bread
moreov it brought him into touch with natur and now that thei were
so near to part hi friendship with her grew veri close
thi wa on of hi troubl that when he di and he knew that befor
veri long he must die even if he continu to live in some other form
he must bid farewel to the natur that he knew
of cours there wa much of her her cruel side that he would rejoic
to lose he could scarc conceiv a futur exist frame upon those
line of struggl which in it work involv pain and cruelti and
death put asid sport and it pleasur which he had abandon
becaus of the suffer and extinct entail upon the shot or hunt
creatur to him it seem inexpress sad that even hi honest
farm oper at least where the beast were concern should
alwai culmin in death why should the faith hors be knock on
the head when it grew old or the poor cow go to the butcher as a reward
for it long career of us and profit
what relentless power had thu decre in ani higher life sure thi
decre would be rescind and of that side of natur he had seen more
than enough upon the earth it wa her gentler and harmless aspect from
which he did not wish to partfrom the flower and the fruit from the
spring blade and the ripen corn from the beauti that brood
over sea and land from the glori of the spread firmament aliv with
light and the wind that blew beneath it and the rain that wash
the face of earth from the majest passag of the glitter star
shed their sweet influenc through the night to bid farewel to
such thing as these must to hi mind inde be terribl
onc he said as much to barbara who thought a while and answer him
why should we be taken beyond all thing if seem scarc reason
i know we have not much to go on but did not the christ speak of
drink the fruit of the vine new with you in my father kingdom
therefor sure there must be a grow plant that produc the fruit
and a process direct by intellig that turn it into wine there
must be husbandmen or farmer there must be mansion or abid place
also for thei ar spoken of and flower and all thing that ar
beauti and us a new earth inde but not on so differ to
the old as to be utterli unfamiliar
anthoni said no more of the matter at thi time but it must have
remain in hi mind at ani rate a month or two later when he woke up
on morn he said to barbara
will you laugh veri much if i tell you of a dream that came to me last
nightif it wa a dream for i seem to be still awak
why should i laugh at your dream she ask kiss him i often
think that there is as much truth in dream as in anyth els tell it
to me
i dream that i saw a mighti landscap which i knew wa not of the
earth it came to me like a pictur and a great still brood over
it at the back of thi landscap stood a tower cliff of stern rock
thousand of feet high set at interv along the edg of the cliff
were golden figur mighti and immov whether thei were live
guard or onli statu i do not know for i never came near to them
here and there mile apart stream from the land beyond pour
over the edg of the cliff in huge cascad of foam that becam rage
torrent when thei reach it lowest slope on of these river fed
a lake which lai in a chasm on the slope and from either end of thi
lake pour two river which seem to me about twenti mile apart as
we should judg thei ran through grove of cedar and larg group
of forest tree not unlik to enorm oak and pine and yet not the
same
on river that to the right if i look toward the lake wa veri
broad so broad that after it reach the plain and flow slowli
great ship could have sail upon it the other that to the left wa
smaller and more rapid but it also wander awai across the plain
till my sight could follow it no farther i observ that the broad
righthand river evid inund it bank in season of flood much
as the nile doe and that all along those bank were field fill with
rich crop of what sort i do not know the plain itself which i take
it wa a kind of delta the gift of the great river wa limitless it
stretch on and on broken onli by forest along the edg of which
move mani anim
when first i saw thi landscap it wa suffus with a sweet and pearli
light that came not from sun or moon or star but from a lumin bodi
in shape like a fold fan of which the handl rest on the earth by
degre thi fan began to open i suppos that it wa the hour of dawn
it rib of gorgeou light spread themselv from on side of heaven
to the other and were join togeth by web of a thousand colour
of such stuff as the rainbow onli a hundr time more beauti the
reflect from these rainbow web lai upon the earth divid by
and sometim mingl with those from the bar of light and made it
gloriou
all these thing i saw from an emin on which i stood that rose
between the river at the head of the plain at length overcom by the
splendour drunk as it were with beauti i turn to look behind me and
there quit close in the midst of state garden with terrac and
tree and fountain and bank of flower i saw a hous andnow inde
you will laughfor so far as i can recollect it in gener style it
wa not unlik our own that is to sai it architectur seem to be
more or less elizabethan if on who wa acquaint with elizabethan
build had gone to that land and built a hous from memori but
with more beauti materi he might have produc such a on as i
imagin in my dream
present from the door of the hous emerg two figur on of these
wa my brother georg and the other barbara wa our babi grown to a
littl fairhair child the child perceiv me first and ran to
me through the flower it leapt into my arm and kiss me then my
brother came and saidi do not mean he spoke but hi mean wa
convei to me
you see we ar make your home readi we hope that you will like it
when you come but if not you can chang it as you wish
then i woke up or went to sleepi do not know which
barbara made light of anthoni dream which seem to her to be after
all but a reflect or an echo of earthli thing trick out with some
bizarr imagin wa not thi obviou the hous a vagu replica of
hi own hous the river someth copi from the nile delta and all
the waterfal niagara on a larger scale the great tree doubtless
their counterpart grew in america the brother and the babewould he
not natur be think of hi brother and hi babe the thing stood
selfconvict echo echo echo flung back in mockeri of our agonis
plead from the cliff of the beyond
and yet thi dream haunt her especi as it return to him more
than onc alwai with a few ad detail thei often talk of thi
supernatur landscap and of the great radiant fan which close at
night and open itself by dai wherewith it wa illumin barbara
thought it strang that anthoni should have imagin so splendid a
thing and yet why should he not have done so if she could pictur it
in her own mind why should he not be abl to origin it in hi
she told him all thi onli avoid allus to the child the babi
barbara whom thei had lost for of thi child although she long
to ask him detail as to her suppos appear she could not bring
herself to speak suppos that he were right suppos that their
daughter wa realli grow up yonder toward some celesti womanhood
and wait for him and wait for her the mother upon whose breast
she had lain the poor bereav mother oh then would not all be worth
while
anthoni listen and said that he agre with her as a lawyer he had
analys the dream and found in it noth at all noth more for
instanc than on analysi is to be found in ani and everi religion
and yet he ad with that pleasant smile of hi which wa begin
to grow so painfulli sweet and plaintiv in it charact and yet it
is veri odd how real that landscap and that hous ar becom to me
do you know barbara that the other night i seem to be sit in
it in a great cool room look out at the river and the vast fertil
plain then you came in my dear clad in a beauti robe embroid
with violet ye you came in glanc round you timidli like on who
had lost her wai and saw me and cri aloud

chapter vii
barbara sin
the month follow anthoni death were to barbara as a bad dream
like on in a dream she saw that open wintri grave beneath the tall
church tower about whose battlement the windblown rook wheel on
their homeward wai she note a littl yellow aconit that had open
it bloom prematur in the shadow of the wall and the sight of it
brought her some kind of comfort he had love aconit and plant mani
of them though becaus of hi winter absenc year had gone by sinc
he had seen on with hi ey at ani rate in england that thi flower
among them all should bloom on that dai and in that place seem to her
a messag and a consol the onli on that she could find
hi sad offic over her father accompani her home pour into her
ear the word of faith and hope that he wa accustom to us to those
broken by bereav and with him came her mother but soon she
thank them gentli and bade them leav her to herself then thei
brought her son to her think that the sight of him would thaw her
heart for a while the child wa quiet and subdu for there wa that
about hi mother face which aw him at last weari of be still
he swung round on hi heel after a fashion that he had and said
cook sai that now father is dead im master here and everyon will
have to do what i tell them
barbara lift her head and look at him and someth in her
fawnlik ey a mute reproach pierc to the boi heart at ani
rate he began to whimper and left the room
there wa littl in the remark which wa such as a vulgar servant might
well make thoughtlessli yet it brought home to barbara the grim fact
of her loss more complet perhap than anyth had done her belov
husband wa dead of no more account in the world than those who had
pass from it at eastwich a thousand year ago he wa dead and soon
would be forgotten by all save her and she wa alon in her heart
utterli alon
the summer came and everyon grew cheer aunt thompson arriv at
the hall to stai and urg barbara to put awai past thing and resign
herself to the will of providencea she had done in the case of the
depart samuel
after all she said it might have been wors you might have been
call upon to nurs an invalid for twenti year and when at last he
went have found the best part of your life gone as i did and she
sigh heavili as it is you still look quit a girl have kept your
figur so well you ar comfort off and have a good posit and in
short there is no know what mai happen in the futur you must come
up and stai with me thi winter dear instead of poke yourself awai
in thi damp old hous where everybodi seem to die of consumpt
realli it is a sort of famili vault and if you stop here long enough
you will catch someth too
barbara thank her with a sad littl smile and answer that she would
think over her kind invit and write to her later but in the end
she never went to london at least not to stai perhap it remind her
too vividli of her life there with anthoni at eastwich she could bear
such memori but for some unexplain reason it wa otherwis in
london
inde in the cours of time her aunt gave up the attempt to persuad
her and devot herself to forward the fortun of her other pretti
niec barbara sister two of whom it should be said alreadi she
had settl comfort in life also she took a fanci to the boi in
whose rough energet natur she found someth akin to her own
i am sick of women she said it is a comfort to have to do with a
male thing
so it came about that after he went to school young anthoni spent a
larg share of hi holidai at hi greataunt london hous it mai be
ad that he got no good from these visit sinc ladi thompson spoilt
him and let him have hi wai in everyth also she gave him more monei
than a boi ought to have as a result or partli so barbara found that
her son grew more and more uncontrol he mix with groom and low
charact and when check flew into fit of passion which frighten
her
oddli enough dure these paroxysm which were gener follow by
two or three dai of persist sulk the onli person who seem
to have ani control over him wa a certain underhousemaid name bess
cotton the daughter of a small farmer in the neighbourhood thi girl
who wa onli about three year older than anthoni wa remark for
her handsom appear and vigour of bodi and mind her hair and larg
ey were so dark that probabl the local belief that she had gipsi or
other foreign blood in her vein wa true her complexion howev wa
pure english and her charact had all the coars of those
who have live for gener in the fen whenc her father came
uncontrol by higher influenc such as the fellowship of gentlebr
and educ folk
bess wa an excel and capabl servant on moreov who soon
obtain a sort of masteri in the household on a certain occas the
young squir as thei call him wa in on of the worst of hi rage
have been forbidden by hi mother to go to a cours meet which
he wish to attend in thi state he shut himself up in the librari
swear that he would do a mischief to anyon who came near him a
promis which be veri strong for hi year he wa quit capabl of
keep the manserv wa told to go in and bring him out but hung
back
bless you said bess i aint afraid and without hesit walk
into the room and shut the door behind her
barbara listen afar off heard a shout of get out follow by
a fear crash and trembl for all violenc wa abomin to her
natur
he will injur that poor girl she said to herself and rose
propos to enter the librari and face her son
as she hurri down the long elizabethan corridor howev she heard
anoth sound that came to her through an open window that of anthoni
laugh in hi jolliest and most uproari manner and of the housemaid
bess laugh with him she stai where she wa and listen bess had
left the librari and wa come across the courtyard where on of the
other servant met her and ask some question that barbara did not
catch the answer in besss ring voic wa clear enough
lord she said thei alwai gave me the wild colt to break upon the
farm it is a matter of ey and handl that all he nearli got me
with that plaster thing so i went for him and box hi ear till he
wa daze then i kiss him afterward till he laugh and hell never
be ani more troubl at least with me that mother of hi dont know how
to handl him she anoth breed
ye said the question the mistress is a ladi she is and gentl
like the squir who gone but how did thei get such a on as master
anthoni
dont know repli bess but father sai that when he wa a boi
in the fen theyd have told that the fairi folk chang him at birth
anywai i like him well enough for he suit me
barbara went back to her sittingroom where not long afterward the boi
came to her as he enter the doorwai she note how handsom he look
with hi massiv head and squarejaw face and how utterli unlik ani
arnott or walrond known to her person or by tradit had he been
a changel such as the girl bess spoke of he could not have seem
more differ
he came and stood befor her hi hand in hi pocket and a smile upon
hi face for he could smile veri pleasantli when he chose
well anthoni she said what is it
noth mother dear except that i have come to beg your pardon you
were quit right about the cours meet thei ar a low lot and i
oughtnt to mix with them but i had bet on some of the dog and want
to go awfulli then when you said i mustnt i lost my temper
that wa veri evid anthoni
ye mother i felt as though i could have kill someon i did try
to kill bess with that bust of plato but she dodg like a cat and the
thing smash against the wall then she came for me straight and gave
me what i deserv for she wa too mani for me and present all my
rage went and i found that i wa laugh while she tidi my cloth
i wish you could do the same mother
do you anthoni well i cannot
i know where did i get my temper from mother not from you or my
father from all i have heard and rememb of him
your grandfath would sai it wa from the devil anthoni
ye and perhap he is right onli then it is rather hard luck on me
isnt it i cant help itit come
then make it go anthoni you ar to be confirm soon chang your
heart
ill try but mother dear though i am so bad to you you ar the onli
on who will ever chang me when that wildcat of a girl got the better
of me just now it wa you i thought of not her if i lost you i dont
know what would becom of me
we have to stand or fall alon anthoni
perhap mother i dont know i am not old enough still dont leav
me alon for if you do then i am sure which i shall do and bend
down he kiss her and left the room
after thi scene anthoni behaviour improv veri much hi report
from school were good for he wa quick and clever and hi great skill
in athlet made him a favourit also hi grandfath who prepar
him for confirm announc that the lad natur seem to have
soften
so thing remain for some time to be accur for just so long as
the girl bess wa a servant at the hall
anthoni might talk about hi mother influenc over him and without
doubt when he wa in hi normal state thi wa consider also it
serv to prevent him from break out but when he did break out bess
catton alon could deal with him natur it would be thought that
there wa some mutual attract between these young peopl yet thi
wa not so at ani rate on the part of the girl who had been overheard
to tell anthoni to hi face that she hate the sight of him and would
cut him to ribbon if she were hi mother
at ani rate there were other or on other of whom bess did not hate
the sight and in the end her behaviour caus such scandal that barbara
wa oblig to send her out of the hous
all right maam she said ill go and be glad of a chang you mai
ring your own bullcalf now and i wish you joi of the job sinc there
none but me that can lead him
a few dai later anthoni return from school with him came a letter
from the head master who wrote that he did not wish to make ani
scandal and therefor had not expel the boi still he would be
oblig if hi mother would refrain from send him back as he did not
consid him a suitabl member of a public school he suggest in
the lad own interest that it might be wise to place him in some
establish where a special wa made of the train of unruli
youth he ad that he wrote thi with the more regret sinc anthoni
father and grandfath had been scholar at in their dai and her
son possess no mean intellectu abil thi would be shown by
the fact that he wa at the head of hi class and might doubtless under
other circumst have risen to a high place in the sixth form
then follow the detail of hi misdo of which on need onli be
mention he had fought anoth boi who it mai be ad wa older
than himself and beaten him but the matter did not end there sinc
after hi adversari had given up the fight anthoni flew at him and
maltreat him so feroci befor thei could be separ that for a
while the poor lad wa actual in danger of collaps
when reproach he express no penit but said onli that he wish
that he had kill him thi he repeat to hi mother face moreov
he wa furiou when he found that bess catton had been sent awai and
demand her return when told that thi wa imposs he announc
quietli that he would make the place a hell and kept hi word
for a year or more befor thi date barbara had not been well she
suffer from persist cold which she wa unabl to shake off and
with these came great depress of spirit now in her miseri the poor
woman went to her room and fall on her knee prai with all her
heart that she might die the burden laid upon her wa more than she
could bear onli on consol could she find that her belov
husband had not live to share it for she knew it would have crush
him as it crush her
her father wa now veri old and so feebl that everyon screen him
from troubl so far as might be but thi particular troubl could not
be hid and barbara told him all
do not give wai my dearest daughter he said and abov all do not
seek to fly from your trial which doubtless is sent to you for some
good purpos troubl that we strive to escap nearli alwai recoil
upon our head wherea if thei ar face often thei melt awai if you
remain in the world to watch and help him your son natur bad as it
seem to be mai yet alter for after all i know that he love you but
if you give up and leav the world who can tell what will happen to him
when he is quit uncontrol and in possess of hi fortun
barbara recognis the truth of her father word and while he live
tri to act up to them but as it happen mr walrond did not live
long for on even he wa found dead in the church whither he often
went to prai
about thi time the doctor told barbara that her condit of health
wa somewhat seriou it seem that her lung also show sign of
be affect perhap she had contract the diseas from her husband
and now that she wa so broken in spirit it assert itself thei
ad howev that if she took certain precaut and abov all went
awai from eastwich there wa everi reason to hope that she would quit
recov her health
in the end barbara did not go awai at the time anthoni wa be
instruct by a tutor who resid at the hall to prepar him for
the univers and ultim for the armi needless to sai she wa
emploi continu in try to compos the differ between him
and thi tutor how then could she go awai and leav that poor gentleman
and her old mother who when she wa not stai with on of her other
marri daughter now made her home at the hall
thu she argu to herself but the truth wa that she did not wish
to go her dearest associ were in the churchyard yonder the
churchyard where she hope er long she would be laid she hate life
she sought and crave for death thi wa her sin
night by night she lai awak and thought of anthoni her darl her
belov she rememb that dream of hi about a home that await him
in anoth world and she love to fanci him as dwell in that place
of peac and make readi for her come
nobodi thought of him now except herself and hi old dog nell the dog
thought of him she wa sure for it would sleep beneath hi empti bed
and at time sit up look at it and whine then it would come and rest
it head upon her as she slept and she would wake to find it look at
her with a question in it ey on night in the dark it did thi
then left her and broke into a joyou whimper such as it us to
make when it master wa go to take it out she even heard it jump
up as though to paw at him and wonder dreamili what it could mean
when she woke in the morn she saw the poor beast ly stiff and cold
upon the bed that had been anthoni and though she wept over it her
tear were perhap those of envi rather than of sorrow for she wa sure
that it had found anthoni
more and more barbara threw out her soul toward anthoni across the
void of nothing she sent it travel nor did it return with
empti hand someth of anthoni had greet it though she could
not rememb the greet had spoken with it though she could not
interpret the word of thi at least she wa sure she had been near to
anthoni
onc she seem to see him in the infinit infinit distanc million
of mile awai the sky open as it were there in the open wa
anthoni talk with on whom she knew for their daughter the babi that
had di talk of her in a minut thei were gone but she had seen
them she wa sure that she had seen them and the knowledg warm her
heart
so there wa no error the bibl wa true more or less faith wa not
built on run water or on sand life wa not a mere hellish mockeri
where tiara turn to crown of thorn and joi wa but an inch rule by
which to measur the alp of human pain life wa a door a gatewai
the door dread the gate peril if you will but beyond it lai no
dream no empti black beyond it stretch the promis land peopl
with the lost who soon would be the found
barbara last ill wa rapid when she began to go she went swiftli
cant you save her ask her son of on of the doctor
the diseas ha gone too far he answer moreov it is imposs
to save on who seek to die
why doe she seek to die blurt anthoni glare at him
perhap young gentleman you ar in a better posit to answer that
question than i am repli the doctor who knew of anthoni cruel
conduct to hi mother and had reproach him with it not onc but on
sever occas
you mean that i have kill her said anthoni savag
no repli the doctor she is dy of tuberculosi of the lung
what were the primari caus which induc that diseas i cannot be
sure all i said wa that she appear to welcom it or rather it
issu and i will add thi on my own account that when she doe die the
world will lose on of the sweetest women that ever walk upon it good
morn
i know what he mean said anthoni to himself as he watch the
retreat form he mean that i have murder her and perhap i
have she is sick of me and want to get back to my father who wa
so differ that why she wont go on live when she might she is
commit suicideof a holi sort well what made me a brute and her
an angel and when she gone how will the brute get on without the
angel why should i be fill with furi and wicked and she of whom
i wa born with sweet and light let god or the devil answer that
if thei can my mother oh my mother and thi violent sinist youth
hid hi face in hi hand and wept
barbara sank down and down into a veri whirlpool of nothing bend
over it as it were she saw the face of her ag mother the face of
some of her dear sister the face of the kindli doctor and lastli the
agonis face of her handsom son
mother dont leav me mother mother for god sake come back to me
mother or we shall never meet again come back to save me
these were the last word that barbara heard
chapter viii
the aton
now these ar the thing that seem to happen to barbara after her
earthli death or rather some of the thing for most of them have fade
awai and been lost to her mortal memori
conscious return to her but at first it wa conscious in an
utter dark everywher wa black and in it she wa quit alon the
whole univers seem to centr in her solitari soul still she felt no
fear onli a kind of wonder at thi infinit blank through which she wa
be born for million and million of mile
light began to shine in the black like to those of pass ship
upon a midnight sea now she wa at rest and the rest wa long and
sweet everi fear and sad thought everi sensat of pain or discomfort
left her peac flow into her
present she becam awar of a weight upon her knee and wonder by
what it could be caus for it remind her of someth becam awar
also that there wa light about her at length her ey open and she
perceiv the light though dimli and that it wa differ to ani she
had known purer more radiant she perceiv also that she lai upon
a low couch and that the weight upon her knee wa caus by someth
shape like the head of a dog nai it wa the head of a dog and on
she knew well anthoni dog that had di upon hi bed now she wa
sure that she dream and in her dream she tri to speak to the dog
the word that her mind form were
nell is that you nell but she could not utter them
still thei were answer for it appear to her that the dog thought
and that she could read it thought which wa
ye it is i who though but a dog have been the last to leav you
am allow to be the first to greet you and it lift it head and
look at her with ey full of a wonder love
her heart went out toward the faith beast in a kind of raptur and
her intellig form anoth question it wa
where am i and if you a creatur ar here where ar the other
be patient i onli watch you till thei come wa the answer
till thei come till who come she murmur
someth within told her to inquir no more but oh wa it possibl
wa the earth dream come true
a long while went by she look about her and understood that she wa
ly in a great and beauti room beneath a dome which seem to be
fashion of transluc ivori or alabast at the end of the room were
curtain woven of some glitter stuff that gave out light at length
these curtain were drawn and through them bear a cup in her hand
pass a shape like to that of a mortal woman onli so radiant that
barbara knew that had she been aliv with the old life she would have
felt afraid
thi shape also wa clad in garment that gave out light and in it
hair were jewel flower it glide to her side and look at her with
love mysteri ey then it held the cup to her lip and said or
rather thought for the speech of that land declar itself in thought
and vision
drink of thi new wine
she drank of the wine and a wonder life fell upon her like a glori
who ar you o vision she ask and by wai of answer there rose up
within her a pictur of herself barbara lean over a cot and look
at the white face of a dead child in a certain room in london then she
knew that thi wa her daughter and stretch out her arm toward her
and receiv her in her arm
present she look again and there around the bed appear four other
shape of beauti
you have forgotten us barbara said on of them but we ar your
sister who di in infanc
for the third time she look and behold kneel at her side just as
he had been found kneel in the church wa her ador father grown
more young onc more she look and last of all breath ineff
love came her lost darl anthoni himself
from heart to heart flash their swift thought like lightn from
cloud to cloud till all her be wa a veri sea of joi now the great
room wa full of presenc and now the curtain were gone and all space
beyond wa full of presenc and from that gloriou compani of a sudden
there aros a song of welcom and beneath the burden of it sweet
she swoon to sleep
barbara dwelt in joi with those she love and learn mani thing she
learn that thi sweet new life of her wa what she had fashion on
the earth with her prayer and strive that the seed of love and
suffer sown down in the world rank soil had here blossom to
thi perfect flower now she knew what wa meant by the sai that the
kingdom of heaven is within you and by the other sai that as man
sow so shall he reap she learn that in thi world beyond the world
and that yet itself wa but a rung in the ladder of mani univers up
which ladder all soul must climb to the ultim judgment there wa
sorrow as well as bliss there were both suffer and delight
here the sin were brought face to face with the nake horror of their
sin and from it fled wail and aghast here the cruel the covet
the lust and the liar were as creatur drag from black cavern
of dark into the burn light of dai these yearn back to their
dark and attain sometim to other cover of a mortal flesh or
to some land of which she had no knowledg for such wa their fate if
in them there wa no spark of repent spirit that in thi new world
could be fan to flame
upward or downward such is the law of the univers in which noth
can stand still up from the earth which barbara had left came the
spirit shape of all that live and could die even to that of the
flower but down to the earth it seem that much of it wa whirl
again to ascend onc more in an ag to come sinc though the stream of
life puls continu forward it ha it backwash and it eddi
barbara learn that though it is bless to die young and sinless like
to that gloriou child of her with whom she walk in thi heavenli
creation and whose task it wa to instruct her in it simpler
mysteri to live and to repent is yet more bless in thi life or
in that all have sin but not all have repent and therefor it
appear to barbara again and again such must know the burden of the
flesh
also she saw mani wonder and learn mani secret of that vast
spiritu univers into which thi world of our pour itself dai by
dai but if she rememb anyth of these she cannot tell them
oh happi wa her life with anthoni for there though now sex as we
know it had ceas to be spirit grew ever closer to spirit and as
below thei dream and hope their union had inde becom an altar on
which love perfect fire flame an offer to heaven happi too wa
her communion with those other soul that had been mingl in her lot
and with mani more whom she had known aforetim and elsewher and long
forgotten for barbara learn that life is an ancient stori of which we
spell out the chapter on by on
yet amidst all thi joi and all the bless labour of a hallow world
in which idl wa not known nor ani weari in welldo a
certain shadow met barbara whichev wai she turn
what is it ask anthoni who felt her troubl
our son she answer and show him all the tale or so much of it
as he did not know end and i chose to leav him that i might take
my chanc of find you i di when i might have live on if i had so
will that is my sin and it haunt me
we ar not the parent of hi soul which is as ancient as our own
barbara
no but for a while it wa given into my hand and i desert it and
now i am afraid how can i tell what ha chanc to the soul of thi
son of our here there is no time i know not if i bade it farewel
yesterdai or ten thousand year ago long long sinc it mai have pass
through thi world where it would seem we dwell onli with those whom we
seek or who seek us or it mai abid upon the earth and there grow foul
and hate let us search out the truth anthoni there ar those who
can open it gate to us if the aim be pure and good
after i di barbara i strove to learn how thing went with you and
strove in vain
not altogeth anthoni for sometim you were veri near to me or so
i dream moreov the case wa differ
those who search sometim find more than thei seek barbara
doubtless still it is laid on me someth drive me on
so by the mean appoint thei sought to know the truth as to thi son
of their and it wa decre that the truth should be known to them
in a dream a vision or perchanc in truthwhich thei never knewthei
were drawn to the world that thei had left and the reek of it sin and
miseri pierc them like a spear
thei stood in the street of london near to a certain fantast gatewai
that wa familiar to them the gatewai of the garden from within
came sound of music and revel for the season wa that of summer

handsom barbara knew her at onc for the girl bess catton who alon
could control her son in hi rage and whom she had dismiss for her
bad conduct she enter the place and thei enter with her although
