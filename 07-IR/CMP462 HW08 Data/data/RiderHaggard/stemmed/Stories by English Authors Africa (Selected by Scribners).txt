to elicit from my companion some clue as to hi intent but hi onli
answer wa let us hurri on jack who know how mani have heard of
wharton adventur by thi time let us hurri on or we mai not be
first in the field
well sir we struggl on through the hill for a matter of ten mile
till at last after descend a crag we saw open out in front of
us a ravin so sombr and dark that it might have been the gate of
hade itself cliff mani hundr feet shut in on everi side the gloomi
boulderstud passag which led through the haunt defil into
kaffirland the moon rise abov the crag threw into strong relief
the rough irregular pinnacl of rock by which thei were top while
all below wa dark as erebu
the sasassa vallei said i
ye said tom
i look at him he wa calm now the flush and feverish had pass
awai hi action were deliber and slow yet there wa a certain
rigid in hi face and glitter in hi ey which show that a crisi
had come
we enter the pass stumbl along amid the great boulder suddenli i
heard a short quick exclam from tom that the crag he cri
point to a great mass loom befor us in the dark now jack
for ani favour us your ey were about a hundr yard from that
cliff i take it so you move slowli toward on side and ill do the
same toward the other when you see anyth stop and call out dont
take more than twelv inch in a step and keep your ey fix on the
cliff about eight feet from the ground ar you readi
ye i wa even more excit than tom by thi time what hi intent
or object wa i could not conjectur beyond that he want to examin
by daylight the part of the cliff from which the light came yet the
influenc of the romant situat and my companion suppress
excit wa so great that i could feel the blood cours through my
vein and count the puls throb at my templ
start cri tom and we move off he to the right i to the left
each with our ey fix intent on the base of the crag i had move
perhap twenti feet when in a moment it burst upon me through the
grow dark there shone a small ruddi glow point the light
from which wane and increas flicker and oscil each chang
produc a more weird effect than the last the old kaffir superstit
came into my mind and i felt a cold shudder pass over me in my
excit i step a pace backward when instantli the light went out
leav utter dark in it place but when i advanc again there
wa the ruddi glare glow from the base of the cliff tom tom i
cri
ay ay i heard him exclaim as he hurri over toward me
there it isther up against the cliff
tom wa at my elbow i see noth said he
why there there man in front of you i step to the right as i
spoke when the light instantli vanish from my ey
but from tom ejacul of delight it wa clear that from my former
posit it wa visibl to him also jack he cri as he turn and
wrung my handjack you and i can never complain of our luck again
now heap up a few stone where we ar stand that right now we
must fix my signpost firmli in at the top there it would take a
strong wind to blow that down and we onli need it to hold out till
morn o jack my boi to think that onli yesterdai we were talk of
becom clerk and you sai that no man knew what wa await him
too by jove jack it would make a good stori
by thi time we had firmli fix the perpendicular stick in between the
two larg stone and tom bent down and peer along the horizont on
for fulli a quarter of an hour he wa altern rais and depress
it until at last with a sigh of satisfact he fix the prop into
the angl and stood up look along jack he said you have as
straight an ey to take a sight as ani man i know of
i look along there beyond the farther sight wa the ruddi
scintil speck appar at the end of the stick itself so
accur had it been adjust
and now my boi said tom let have some supper and a sleep
there noth more to be done tonight but well need all our wit
and strength tomorrow get some stick and kindl a fire here and then
well be abl to keep an ey on our signalpost and see that noth
happen to it dure the night
well sir we kindl a fire and had supper with the sasassa demon
ey roll and glow in front of us the whole night through not
alwai in the same place though for after supper when i glanc along
the sight to have anoth look at it it wa nowher to be seen the
inform did not howev seem to disturb tom in ani wai he mere
remark it the moon not the thing that ha shift and coil
himself up went to sleep
by earli dawn we were both up and gaze along our pointer at the
cliff but we could make out noth save the on dead monoton
slati surfac rougher perhap at the part we were examin than
elsewher but otherwis present noth remark
now for your idea jack said tom donahu unwind a long thin cord
from round hi waist you fasten it and guid me while i take the
other end so sai he walk off to the base of the cliff hold
on end of the cord while i drew the other taut and wound it round the
middl of the horizont stick pass it through the sight at the end
by thi mean i could direct tom to the right or left until we had our
string stretch from the point of attach through the sight and
on to the rock which it struck about eight feet from the ground tom
drew a chalk circl of about three feet diamet round the spot and
then call to me to come and join him weve manag thi busi
togeth jack he said and well find what we ar to find
togeth the circl he had drawn embrac a part of the rock smoother
than the rest save that about the centr there were a few rough
protuber or knob on of these tom point to with a cry of
delight it wa a roughish brownish mass about the size of a man
close fist and look like a bit of dirti glass let into the wall of
the cliff that it he criedthat it
that what
why man a diamond and such a on as there isnt a monarch in
europ but would envi tom donahu the possess of up with your
crowbar and well soon exorcis the demon of sasassa vallei
i wa so astound that for a moment i stood speechless with surpris
gaze at the treasur which had so unexpectedli fallen into our hand
here hand me the crowbar said tom now by us thi littl round
knob which project from the cliff here as a fulcrum we mai be abl to
lever it off ye there it goe i never thought it could have come so
easili now jack the sooner we get back to our hut and then down to
cape town the better
we wrap up our treasur and made our wai across the hill toward
home on the wai tom told me how while a law student in the middl
templ he had come upon a dusti pamphlet in the librari by on jan
van hounym which told of an experi veri similar to our which
had befallen that worthi dutchman in the latter part of the seventeenth
centuri and which result in the discoveri of a lumin diamond thi
tale it wa which had come into tom head as he listen to honest dick
wharton ghoststori while the mean which he had adopt to verifi
hi supposit sprang from hi own fertil irish brain
well take it down to cape town continu tom and if we cant
dispos of it with advantag there it will be worth our while to ship
for london with it let us go along to madison first though he know
someth of these thing and can perhap give us some idea of what we
mai consid a fair price for our treasur
we turn off from the track accordingli befor reach our hut and
kept along the narrow path lead to madison farm he wa at lunch
when we enter and in a minut we were seat at each side of him
enjoi south african hospit
well he said after the servant were gone what in the wind now
i see you have someth to sai to me what is it

envelop it there he said put hi crystal on the tabl what
would you sai wa a fair price for that
madison took it up and examin it critic well he said lai

twelv shill cri tom start to hi feet dont you see what
it is

rocksalt be dd a diamond
tast it said madison
tom put it to hi lip dash it down with a dread exclam and
rush out of the room
i felt sad and disappoint enough myself but present rememb
what tom had said about the pistol i too left the hous and made for
the hut leav madison openmouth with astonish when i got in
i found tom ly in hi bunk with hi face to the wall too dispirit
appar to answer my consol anathematis dick and madison
the sasassa demon and everyth els i stroll out of the hut and
refresh myself with a pipe after our wearisom adventur i wa about
fifti yard from the hut when i heard issu from it the sound which
of all other i least expect to hear had it been a groan or an oath
i should have taken it as a matter of cours but the sound which
caus me to stop and take the pipe out of my mouth wa a hearti roar of
laughter next moment tom himself emerg from the door hi whole face
radiant with delight game for anoth tenmil walk old fellow
what for anoth lump of rocksalt at twelv shill a ton
no more of that hal an you love me grin tom now look here
jack what bless fool we ar to be so floor by a trifl just sit
on thi stump for five minut and ill make it as clear as daylight
youv seen mani a lump of rocksalt stuck in a crag and so have i
though we did make such a mull of thi on now jack did ani of
the piec you have ever seen shine in the dark brighter than ani
firefli
well i cant sai thei ever did
id ventur to prophesi that if we wait until night which we wont
do we would see that light still glimmer among the rock therefor
jack when we took awai thi worthless salt we took the wrong crystal
it is no veri strang thing in these hill that a piec of rocksalt
should be ly within a foot of a diamond it caught our ey and
we were excit and so we made fool of ourselv and left the real
stone behind depend upon it jack the sasassa gem is ly within
that magic circl of chalk upon the face of yonder cliff come old
fellow light your pipe and stow your revolv and well be off befor
that fellow madison ha time to put two and two togeth
i dont know that i wa veri sanguin thi time i had begun in fact
to look upon the diamond as a most unmitig nuisanc howev rather
than throw a damper on tom expect i announc myself eager to
start what a walk it wa tom wa alwai a good mountain but hi
excit seem to lend him wing that dai while i scrambl along
after him as best i could
when we got within half a mile he broke into the doubl and never
pull up until he reach the round white circl upon the cliff poor
old tom when i came up hi mood had chang and he wa stand
with hi hand in hi pocket gaze vacantli befor him with a rueful
counten
look he said look and he point at the cliff not a sign of
anyth in the least resembl a diamond there the circl includ
noth but a flat slatecolour stone with on larg hole where we
had extract the rocksalt and on or two smaller depress no sign
of the gem
iv been over everi inch of it said poor tom it not there some
on ha been here and notic the chalk and taken it come home jack
i feel sick and tire oh had ani man ever luck like mine
i turn to go but took on last look at the cliff first tom wa
alreadi ten pace off
hollo i cri dont you see ani chang in that circl sinc
yesterdai

must have wrench it off in us the lever let have a look at what
it made of
accordingli at the foot of the cliff we search about among the loos
stone
here you ar jack weve done it at last were made men
i turn round and there wa tom radiant with delight and with the
littl corner of black rock in hi hand at first sight it seem to
be mere a chip from the cliff but near the base there wa project
from it an object which tom wa now exultingli point out it
look at first someth like a glass ey but there wa a depth and
brillianc about it such as glass never exhibit there wa no mistak
thi time we had certainli got possess of a jewel of great valu
and with light heart we turn from the vallei bear awai with us
the fiend which had so long reign there

long odd by h rider haggard
the stori which is narrat in the follow page came to me from the
lip of my old friend allan quatermain or hunter quatermain as we us
to call him in south africa he told it to me on even when i wa
stop with him at the place he bought in yorkshir shortli after
that the death of hi onli son so unsettl him that he immedi
left england accompani by two companion hi old fellowvoyag
sir henri curti and captain good and ha now utterli vanish into the
dark heart of africa he is persuad that a white peopl of which he
ha heard rumour all hi life exist somewher on the highland in the
vast still unexplor interior and hi great ambit is to find them
befor he di thi is the wild quest upon which he and hi companion
have depart and from which i shrewdli suspect thei never will return
on letter onli have i receiv from the old gentleman date from a
mission station high up the tana a river on the east coast about
three hundr mile north of zanzibar in it he sai that thei have gone
through mani hardship and adventur but ar aliv and well and have
found trace which go far toward make him hope that the result of
their wild quest mai be a magnific and unexampl discoveri i
greatli fear howev that all he ha discov is death for thi
letter came a long while ago and nobodi ha heard a singl word of the
parti sinc thei have total vanish
it wa on the last even of my stai at hi hous that he told the
ensu stori to me and captain good who wa dine with him he had
eaten hi dinner and drunk two or three glass of old port just to
help good and myself to the end of the second bottl it wa an unusu
thing for him to do for he wa a most abstemi man have conceiv
as he us to sai a great horror of drink from observ it
effect upon the class of colonistshunt transportrid
and othersamongst whom he had pass so mani year of hi life
consequ the good wine took more effect on him than it would have
done on most men send a littl flush into hi wrinkl cheek and
make him talk more freeli than usual
dear old man i can see him now as he went limp up and down the
vestibul with hi grai hair stick up in scrubbingbrush fashion
hi shrivel yellow face and hi larg dark ey that were as keen
as ani hawk and yet soft as a buck the whole room wa hung with
trophi of hi numer hunt expedit and he had some stori
about everi on of them if onli he could be got to tell it gener
he would not for he wa not veri fond of narrat hi own adventur
but tonight the port wine made him more commun
ah you brute he said stop beneath an unusu larg skull of
a lion which wa fix just over the mantelpiec beneath a long row of
gun it jaw distend to their utmost width ah you brute you have
given me a lot of troubl for the last dozen year and will i suppos
to my dy dai
tell us the yarn quatermain said good you have often promis to
tell me and you never have
you had better not ask me to he answer for it is a longish on
all right i said the even is young and there is some more
port
thu adjur he fill hi pipe from a jar of coarsecut boer tobacco
that wa alwai stand on the mantelpiec and still walk up and
down the room began
it wa i think in the march of 69 that i wa up in sikukuni
countri it wa just after old sequati time and sikukuni had got into
poweri forget how anywai i wa there i had heard that the bapedi
peopl had brought down an enorm quantiti of ivori from the interior
and so i start with a waggonload of good and came straight awai
from middelburg to try and trade some of it it wa a riski thing to
go into the countri so earli on account of the fever but i knew that
there were on or two other after that lot of ivori so i determin
to have a try for it and take my chanc of fever i had becom so tough
from continu knock about that i did not set it down at much well
i got on all right for a while it is a wonderfulli beauti piec of
bush veldt with great rang of mountain run through it and round
granit koppi start up here and there look out like sentinel
over the roll wast of bush but it is veri hothot as a
stewpanand when i wa there that march which of cours is autumn
in thi part of africa the whole place reek of fever everi morn
as i trek along down by the oliph river i us to creep from the
waggon at dawn and look out but there wa no river to be seenonli a
long line of billow of what look like the finest cottonwool toss
up lightli with a pitchfork it wa the fever mist out from among the
scrub too came littl spiral of vapour as though there were hundr
of tini fire alight in itreek rise from thousand of ton of
rot veget it wa a beauti place but the beauti wa the
beauti of death and all those line and blot of vapour wrote on great
word across the surfac of the countri and that word wa fever
it wa a dread year of ill that i came i rememb to on
littl kraal of knobnos and went up to it to see if i could get some
maa curdl buttermilk and a few meali as i got near i wa
struck with the silenc of the place no children began to chatter and
no dog bark nor could i see ani nativ sheep or cattl the place
though it had evid been recent inhabit wa as still as the
bush round it and some guineafowl got up out of the prickli pear
bush right at the kraal gate i rememb that i hesit a littl
befor go in there wa such an air of desol about the spot
natur never look desol when man ha not yet laid hi hand upon her
breast she is onli love but when man ha been and ha pass awai
then she look desol
well i pass into the kraal and went up to the princip hut in
front of the hut wa someth with an old sheepskin kaross rug
thrown over it i stoop down and drew off the rug and then shrank
back amaz for under it wa the bodi of a young woman recent dead
for a moment i thought of turn back but my curios overcam me so
go past the dead woman i went down on my hand and knee and crept
into the hut it wa so dark that i could not see anyth though
i could smell a great deal so i lit a match it wa a tandstickor
match and burnt slowli and dimli and as the light gradual increas
i made out what i took to be a famili of peopl men women and
children fast asleep present it burnt up brightli and i saw that
thei too five of them altogeth were quit dead on wa a babi i
drop the match in a hurri and wa make my wai out of the hut as
hard as i could go when i caught sight of two bright ey stare
out of a corner think it wa a wild cat or some such anim i
redoubl my hast when suddenli a voic near the ey began first to
mutter and then to send up a success of aw yell hastili i lit
anoth match and perceiv that the ey belong to an old woman
wrap up in a greasi leather garment take her by the arm i drag
her out for she could not or would not come by herself and the
stench wa overpow me such a sight as she wasa bag of bone
cover over with black shrivel parchment the onli white thing
about her wa her wool and she seem to be pretti well dead except for
her ey and her voic she thought that i wa a devil come to take her
and that is why she yell so well i got her down to the waggon
and gave her a tot of cape smoke and then as soon as it wa readi
pour about a pint of beeftea down her throat made from the flesh
of a blue vilderbeest i had kill the dai befor and after that she
brighten up wonderfulli she could talk zuluinde it turn out
that she had run awai from zululand in tchaka timeand she told
me that all the peopl whom i had seen had di of fever when thei had
di the other inhabit of the kraal had taken the cattl and
gone awai leav the poor old woman who wa helpless from ag and
infirm to perish of starvat or diseas as the case might be she
had been sit there for three dai among the bodi when i found her
i took her on to the next kraal and gave the headman a blanket to look
after her promis him anoth if i found her well when i came back i
rememb that he wa much astonish at my part with two blanket for
the sake of such a worthless old creatur why did i not leav her in
the bush he ask those peopl carri the doctrin of the surviv of
the fittest to it extrem you see
it wa the night after i had got rid of the old woman that i made my
first acquaint with my friend yonder and he nod toward the
skull that seem to be grin down at us in the shadow of the wide
mantelshelf i had trek from dawn till eleven oclocka long
trekbut i want to get on and then had turn the oxen out to
graze send the voorloop to look after them mean to inspan
again about six oclock and trek with the moon till ten then i got
into the waggon and had a good sleep till halfpast two or so in the
afternoon when i rose and cook some meat and had my dinner wash
it down with a pannikin of black coffe for it wa difficult to get
preserv milk in those dai just as i had finish and the driver a
man call tom wa wash up the thing in come the young scoundrel
of a voorloop drive on ox befor him
where ar the other oxen i ask
koo he said koo chief the other oxen have gone awai i turn
my back for a minut and when i look round again thei were all gone
except kaptein here who wa rub hi back against a tree
you mean that you have been asleep and let them strai you villain i
will rub your back against a stick i answer feel veri angri for
it wa not a pleasant prospect to be stuck up in that fevertrap for a
week or so while we were hunt for the oxen off you go and you too
tom and mind you dont come back till you have found them thei have
trek back along the middelburg road and ar a dozen mile off by
now ill be bound now no word go both of you
tom the driver swore and caught the lad a hearti kick which he
richli deserv and then have ti old kaptein up to the disselboom
with a riem thei took their assegai and stick and start i would
have gone too onli i knew that somebodi must look after the waggon and
i did not like to leav either of the boi with it at night i wa in a
veri bad temper inde although i wa pretti well us to these sort
of occurr and sooth myself by take a rifl and go to kill
someth for a coupl of hour i poke about without see anyth
that i could get a shot at but at last just as i wa again within
seventi yard of the waggon i put up an old impala ram from behind a
mimosathorn he ran straight for the waggon and it wa not till he wa
pass within a few feet of it that i could get a decent shot at him
then i pull and caught him halfwai down the spine over he went
dead as a doornail and a pretti shot it wa though i ought not to sai
it thi littl incid put me into rather a better temper especi
as the buck had roll right against the after part of the waggon so i
had onli to gut him fix a riem round hi leg and haul him up by the
time i had done thi the sun wa down and the full moon wa up and
a beauti moon it wa and then there came that wonder hush which
sometim fall over the african bush in the earli hour of the night
no beast wa move and no bird call not a breath of air stir the
quiet tree and the shadow did not even quiver thei onli grew it wa
veri oppress and veri lone for there wa not a sign of the cattl
or the boi i wa quit thank for the societi of old kaptein who
wa ly down contentedli against the disselboom chew the cud with
a good conscienc
present howev kaptein began to get restless first he snort
then he got up and snort again i could not make it out so like a
fool i got down off the waggonbox to have a look round think it
might be the lost oxen come
next instant i regret it for all of a sudden i heard a roar and saw
someth yellow flash past me and light on poor kaptein then came
a bellow of agoni from the ox and a crunch as the lion put hi teeth
through the poor brute neck and i began to understand what had
happen my rifl wa in the waggon and my first thought wa to get
hold of it and i turn and made a bolt for it i got my foot on the
wheel and flung my bodi forward on to the waggon and there i stop as
if i were frozen and no wonder for as i wa about to spring up i heard
the lion behind me and next second i felt the brute ay as plainli as
i can feel thi tabl i felt him i sai snif at my left leg that
wa hang down
my word i did feel queer i dont think that i ever felt so queer
befor i dare not move for the life of me and the odd thing wa that
i seem to lose power over my leg which develop an insan sort
of inclin to kick out of it own mere motionjust as hyster
peopl want to laugh when thei ought to be particularli solemn well
the lion snif and snif begin at my ankl and slowli nose
awai up to my thigh i thought that he wa go to get hold then but
he did not he onli growl softli and went back to the ox shift my
head a littl i got a full view of him he wa about the biggest lion
i ever sawand i have seen a great mani and he had a most tremend
black mane what hi teeth were like you can seelook there pretti big
on aint thei altogeth he wa a magnific anim and as i lai
sprawl on the fore tongu of the waggon it occur to me that he
would look uncommonli well in a cage he stood there by the carcass of
poor kaptein and deliber disembowel him as neatli as a butcher
could have done all thi while i dare not move for he kept lift
hi head and keep an ey on me as he lick hi bloodi chop when
he had clean kaptein out he open hi mouth and roar and i am not
exagger when i sai that the sound shook the waggon instantli there
came back an answer roar
heaven i thought there is hi mate
hardli wa the thought out of my head when i caught sight in the
moonlight of the lioness bound along through the long grass and
after her a coupl of cub about the size of mastiff she stop
within a few feet of my head and stood and wave her tail and fix
me with her glow yellow ey but just as i thought that it wa all
over she turn and began to feed on kaptein and so did the cub there
were the four of them within eight feet of me growl and quarrel
rend and tear and crunch poor kaptein bone and there i
lai shake with terror and the cold perspir pour out of me
feel like anoth daniel come to judgment in a new sens of the
phrase present the cub had eaten their fill and began to get
restless on went round to the back of the waggon and pull at
the impala buck that hung there and the other came round my wai and
commenc the snif game at my leg inde he did more than that
for my trouser be hitch up a littl he began to lick the bare
skin with hi rough tongu the more he lick the more he like it to
judg from hi increas vigour and the loud pur nois he made then
i knew that the end had come for in anoth second hi filelik tongu
would have rasp through the skin of my legwhich wa luckili pretti
toughand have drawn the blood and then there would be no chanc
for me so i just lai there and thought of my sin and prai to the
almighti and thought that after all life wa a veri enjoy thing
and then all of a sudden i heard a crash of bush and the shout
and whistl of men and there were the two boi come back with the
cattl which thei had found trek along all togeth the lion
lift their head and listen then without a sound bound offand i
faint
the lion came back no more that night and by the next morn my
nerv had got pretti straight again but i wa full of wrath when i
thought of all that i had gone through at the hand or rather nose
of those four lion and of the fate of my afterox kaptein he wa a
splendid ox and i wa veri fond of him so wroth wa i that like a
fool i determin to attack the whole famili of them it wa worthi of
a greenhorn out on hi first huntingtrip but i did it nevertheless
accordingli after breakfast have rub some oil upon my leg which
wa veri sore from the cub tongu i took the driver tom who did not
half like the job and have arm myself with an ordinari doubl no
12 smoothbor the first breechload i ever had i start i took
the smoothbor becaus it shot a bullet veri well and my experi
ha been that a round ball from a smoothbor is quit as effect
against a lion as an express bullet the lion is soft and not a
difficult anim to finish if you hit him anywher in the bodi a buck
take far more kill
well i start and the first thing i set to work to do wa to try to
make out whereabout the brute lai up for the dai about three hundr
yard from the waggon wa the crest of a rise cover with singl
mimosatre dot about in a parklik fashion and beyond thi wa
a stretch of open plain run down to a dry pan or waterhol which
cover about an acr of ground and wa dens cloth with reed
now in the sear and yellow leaf from the farther edg of thi pan the
ground slope up again to a great cleft or nullah which had been cut
out by the action of the water and wa pretti thickli sprinkl with
bush among which grew some larg tree i forget of what sort
it at onc struck me that the dry pan would be a like place to find
my friend in as there is noth a lion is fonder of than ly up
in reed through which he can see thing without be seen himself
accordingli thither i went and prospect befor i had got halfwai
round the pan i found the remain of a blue vilderbeest that had
evid been kill within the last three or four dai and partial
devour by lion and from other indic about i wa soon assur
that if the famili were not in the pan that dai thei spent a good deal
of their spare time there but if there the question wa how to get
them out for it wa clearli imposs to think of go in after
them unless on wa quit determin to commit suicid now there wa a
strong wind blow from the direct of the waggon across the reedi
pan toward the bushclad kloof or donga and thi first gave me the
idea of fire the reed which as i think i told you were pretti dry
accordingli tom took some match and began start littl fire to the
left and i did the same to the right but the reed were still green
at the bottom and we should never have got them well alight had it not
been for the wind which grew stronger and stronger as the sun climb
higher and forc the fire into them at last after half an hour
troubl the flame got a hold and began to spread out like a fan
whereupon i went round to the farther side of the pan to wait for the
lion stand well out in the open as we stood at the cops todai
where you shot the woodcock it wa a rather riski thing to do but i
us to be so sure of my shoot in those dai that i did not so much
mind the risk scarc had i got round when i heard the reed part
befor the onward rush of some anim now for it said i on it came
i could see that it wa yellow and prepar for action when instead
of a lion out bound a beauti rietbok which had been ly in
the shelter of the pan it must by the wai have been a rietbok of a
peculiarli confid natur to lai itself down with the lion like the
lamb of propheci but i suppos the reed were thick and that it kept a
long wai off
well i let the rietbok go and it went like the wind and kept my
ey fix upon the reed the fire wa burn like a furnac now the
flame crackl and roar as thei bit into the reed send spout
of fire twenti feet and more into the air and make the hot air danc
abov it in a wai that wa perfectli dazzl but the reed were
still half green and creat an enorm quantiti of smoke which came
roll toward me like a curtain ly veri low on account of the wind
present abov the crackl of the fire i heard a startl roar
then anoth and anoth so the lion were at home
i wa begin to get excit now for as you fellow know there
is noth in experi to warm up your nerv like a lion at close
quarter unless it is a wound buffalo and i got still more so when
i made out through the smoke that the lion were all move about on the
extrem edg of the reed occasion thei would pop their head out
like rabbit from a burrow and then catch sight of me stand
about fifti yard out draw them back again i knew that it must be
get pretti warm behind them and that thei could not keep the game
up for long and i wa not mistaken for suddenli all four of them broke
cover togeth the old blackman lion lead by a few yard i never
saw a more splendid sight in all my hunt experi than those four
lion bound across the veldt overshadow by the dens pall of smoke
and back by the fieri furnac of the burn reed
i reckon that thei would pass on their road to the bushi kloof
within about five and twenti yard of me so take a long breath i
got my gun well on to the lion shoulderth blackman oneso as to
allow for an inch or two of motion and catch him through the heart
i wa on dead on and my finger wa just begin to tighten on the
trigger when suddenli i went blinda bit of reedash had drift into
my right ey i danc and rub and succeed in clear it more or
less just in time to see the tail of the last lion vanish round the
bush up the kloof
if ever a man wa mad i wa that man it wa too bad and such a shot
in the open too howev i wa not go to be beaten so i just
turn and march for the kloof tom the driver beg and implor
me not to go but though as a gener rule i never pretend to be veri
brave which i am not i wa determin that i would either kill those
lion or thei should kill me so i told tom that he need not come unless
he like but i wa go and be a plucki fellow a swazi by birth
he shrug hi shoulder mutter that i wa mad or bewitch and
follow doggedli in my track
we soon got to the kloof which wa about three hundr yard in length
and but spars wood and then the real fun began there might be a
lion behind everi bushther certainli were four lion somewher the
delic question wa where i peep and poke and look in everi
possibl direct with my heart in my mouth and wa at last reward
by catch a glimps of someth yellow move behind a bush at the
same moment from anoth bush opposit me out burst on of the cub and
gallop back toward the burnedout pan i whip round and let drive a
snapshot that tip him head over heel break hi back within two
inch of the root of the tail and there he lai helpless but glare
tom afterward kill him with hi assegai i open the breech of the
gun and hurriedli pull out the old case which to judg from what
ensu must i suppos have burst and left a portion of it fabric
stick to the barrel at ani rate when i tri to get in the new case
it would onli enter halfwai andwould you believ itthi wa the
moment that the lioness attract no doubt by the outcri of her cub
chose to put in an appear there she stood twenti pace or so from
me lash her tail and look just as wick as it is possibl to
conceiv slowli i step backward try to push in the new case and
as i did so she move on in littl run drop down after each run
the danger wa immin and the case would not go in at the moment
i oddli enough thought of the cartridgemak whose name i will not
mention and earnestli hope that if the lion got me some condign
punish would overtak him it would not go in so i tri to pull it
out it would not come out either and my gun wa useless if i could
not shut it to us the other barrel i might as well have had no gun
meanwhil i wa walk backward keep my ey on the lioness who wa
creep forward on her belli without a sound but lash her tail
and keep her ey on me and in it i saw that she wa come in a
few second more i dash my wrist and the palm of my hand against the
brass rim of the cartridg till the blood pour from themlook there
ar the scar of it to thi dai
here quatermain held up hi right hand to the light and show us four
or five white cicatric just where the wrist is set into the hand
but it wa not of the slightest us he went on the cartridg would
not move i onli hope that no other man will ever be put in such an
aw posit the lioness gather herself togeth and i gave myself
up for lost when suddenli tom shout out from somewher in my rear
you ar walk on to the wound cub turn to the right
i had the sens daze as i wa to take the hint and slew round at
right angl but still keep my ey on the lioness i continu my
backward walk
to my intens relief with a low growl she straighten herself
turn and bound off farther up the kloof
come on inkoo said tom let get back to the waggon
all right tom i answer i will when i have kill those three
other lion for by thi time i wa bent on shoot them as i never
rememb be bent on anyth befor or sinc you can go if you
like or you can get up a tree
he consid the posit a littl and then he veri wise got up a
tree i wish that i had done the same
meanwhil i had found my knife which had an extractor in it and
succeed after some difficulti in haul out the case which had so
nearli been the caus of my death and remov the obstruct in the
barrel it wa veri littl thicker than a postagestamp certainli not
thicker than a piec of writingpap thi done i load the gun
bound a handkerchief round my wrist and hand to staunch the flow of
the blood and start on again
i had notic that the lioness went into a thick green bush or rather
cluster of bush grow near the water for there wa a littl stream
run down the kloof about fifti yard higher up and for thi i made
when i got there howev i could see noth so i took up a big stone
and threw it into the bush i believ that it hit the other cub for
out it came with a rush give me a broadsid shot of which i promptli
avail myself knock it over dead out too came the lioness like a
flash of light but quick as she went i manag to put the other bullet
into her rib so that she roll right over three time like a shot
rabbit i instantli got two more cartridg into the gun and as i did
so the lioness rose again and came crawl toward me on her fore paw
roar and groan and with such an express of diabol furi on
her counten as i have not often seen i shot her again through the
chest and she fell over on to her side quit dead
that wa the first and last time that i ever kill a brace of lion
right and left and what is more i never heard of anybodi els do
it natur i wa consider pleas with myself and have again
load up i went on to look for the blackman beauti who had kill
kaptein slowli and with the greatest care i proceed up the kloof
search everi bush and tuft of grass as i went it wa wonderfulli
excit work for i never wa sure from on moment to anoth but that
he would be on me i took comfort howev from the reflect that
a lion rare attack a manrar i sai sometim he doe as you
will seeunless he is corner or wound i must have been nearli an
hour hunt after that lion onc i thought i saw someth move in a
clump of tambouki grass but i could not be sure and when i trod out
the grass i could not find him
at last i work up to the head of the kloof which made a culdesac
it wa form of a wall of rock about fifti feet high down thi rock
trickl a littl waterfal and in front of it some seventi feet from
it face wa a great piledup mass of boulder in the crevic and on
the top of which grew fern grass and stunt bush thi mass wa
about twentyf feet high the side of the kloof here were also veri
steep well i came to the top of the nullah and look all round no
sign of the lion evid i had either overlook him farther down or
he had escap right awai it wa veri vexati but still three lion
were not a bad bag for on gun befor dinner and i wa fain to be
content accordingli i depart back again make my wai round the
isol pillar of boulder begin to feel as i did so that i wa
pretti well done up with excit and fatigu and should be more so
befor i had skin those three lion when i had got as nearli as i
could judg about eighteen yard past the pillar or mass of boulder
i turn to have anoth look round i have a pretti sharp ey but i
could see noth at all
then on a sudden i saw someth suffici alarm on the top
of the mass of boulder opposit to me stand out clear against the
rock beyond wa the huge blackman lion he had been crouch there
and now aros as though by magic there he stood lash hi tail
just like a live reproduct of the anim on the gatewai of
northumberland hous that i have seen a pictur of but he did not stand
long befor i could firebefor i could do more than get the gun to my
shoulderh sprang straight up and out from the rock and driven by the
impetu of that on mighti bound came hurtl through the air toward
me
heaven how grand he look and how aw high into the air he flew
describ a great arch just as he touch the highest point of hi
spring i fire i did not dare to wait for i saw that he would clear
the whole space and land right upon me without a sight almost without
aim i fire as on would fire a snapshot at a snipe the bullet told
for i distinctli heard it thud abov the rush sound caus by the
passag of the lion through the air next second i wa swept to the
ground luckili i fell into a low creeperclad bush which broke the
shock and the lion wa on the top of me and the next those great
white teeth of hi had met in my thighi heard them grate against the
bone i yell out in agoni for i did not feel in the least benumb
and happi like dr livingstonewhom by the wai i knew veri
welland gave myself up for dead but suddenli at that moment the
lion grip on my thigh loosen and he stood over me swai to and
fro hi huge mouth from which the blood wa gush wide open then
he roar and the sound shook the rock
to and fro he swung and then the great head drop on me knock
all the breath from my bodi and he wa dead my bullet had enter in
the centr of hi chest and pass out on the right side of the spine
about half wai down the back
the pain of my wound kept me from faint and as soon as i got my
breath i manag to drag myself from under him thank heaven hi great
teeth had not crush my thighbon but i wa lose a great deal of
blood and had it not been for the time arriv of tom with whose aid
i got the handkerchief from my wrist and ti it round my leg twist
it tight with a stick i think that i should have bled to death
well it wa a just reward for my folli in try to tackl a famili
of lion singlehand the odd were too long i have been lame ever
sinc and shall be to my dy dai in the month of march the wound
alwai troubl me a great deal and everi three year it break
out raw i need scarc add that i never trade the lot of ivori at
sikukuni anoth man got ita germanand made five hundr pound
out of it after pai expens i spent the next month on the broad of
my back and wa a crippl for six month after that and now iv told
you the yarn so i will have a drop of holland and go to bed
king bemba point a west african stori by j lander
we were for the most part a queer lot out on that desol southwest
african coast in charg of the variou trade station that were
scatter along the coast from the gaboon river past the mouth of the
mighti congo to the portugues citi of st paul de loanda a mixtur of
all sort especi bad sort brokendown clerk men who could not
succe anywher els sailor youth and some whose charact would
not have born ani investig and we veri nearli all drank hard and
those who didnt drink hard took more than wa good for them
i dont know exactli what induc me to go out there i wa young
for on thing the countri wa unknown the berth wa vacant and the
condit of it easi
imagin a high rocki point or headland stretch out sidewai into
the sea and at it base a small river wind into a countri that
wa seemingli a blank in regard to inhabit or cultiv a land
continu for mile and mile as far as the ey could see on expans
of long yellow grass dot here and there with group of bastard
palm in front of the headland roll the lone south atlant and
as if such condit were not dispirit enough to exist upon the
point there wa yet anoth featur which at time gave the place a
still more ghastli look a long wai off the shore the heav surfac
of the ocean began in anyth like bad weather to break upon the
shoal of the coast view from the top of the rock the sea at such
time look for at least two mile out as if it were score over with
line of white foam but lower down near the beach each roller could
be distinctli seen and each roller had a curv of mani feet and wa an
enorm mass of water that hurl itself shoreward until it curl and
broke
when i first arriv on the point there wa i mai sai onli on hous
upon it and that belong to messr flint brother of liverpool it
wa occupi by on solitari man name jackson he had had an assist
but the assist had di of fever and i wa sent to replac him
jackson wa a man of fifti at least who had been a sailor befor he
had becom an african trader hi face bore testimoni to the wind
and weather it had encount and wore habitu a grave if not
melancholi express he wa rough but kind to me and though strict
wa just which wa no common featur in an old african hand to on who
had just arriv on the coast
he kept the factoryw call all hous on the coast factoriesa
neat and clean as if it had been a ship he had the floor of the portion
we dwelt in holyston everi week and numberless littl rack and
shelv were fit up all over the hous the outsid wall glitter
with paint and the yard wa swept clean everi morn and everi
sundai at eight oclock and sunset the ensign wa hoist and lower
and an old cannon fire at the word of command order and rule were with
jackson observ from habit and were strictli enforc by him on all
the nativ emploi in the factori
although i have said the countri look as if uninhabit there were
numer villag hidden awai in the long grass and brushwood invis
at a distanc be hut of thatch or mud and not so high as the
grass among which thei were place from these villag came most of our
servant and also the middlemen who act as broker between us the
white men and the negro who brought ivori and gum and indiarubb
from the far interior for sale our trade wa princip in ivori
and when an unusu larg number of eleph tusk arriv upon the
point for sale it would be crowd with bushmen strang and uncouth
and hideous ugli and arm and then we would be veri busi for
sometim as mani as two hundr tusk would be brought to us at the
same time and each of these had to be bargain for and paid for by
exchang of cotton cloth gun knive powder and a host of small
ware
for some time after my arriv our factori along with the other on
the coast belong to messr flint brother wa veri well suppli
by them with good for the trade but by degre their shipment becam
less frequent and small when thei did come in spite of repeat
letter we could gain no reason from the firm for thi fact nor could
the other factori and gradual we found ourselv with an empti
storehous and nearli all our good gone then follow a weari
interv dure which we had noth whatev to do and dai succeed
dai through the long hot season it wa now that i began to feel that
jackson had becom of late more silent and reserv with me than ever
he had been i notic too that he had contract a habit of wander
out to the extrem end of the point where he would sit for hour gaze
upon the ocean befor him in addit to thi he grew moros and
uncertain in hi temper toward the nativ and sometim he would fall
asleep in the even on a sofa and talk to himself at such a rate
while asleep that i would grow frighten and wake him when he would
stare about him for a littl until he gather conscious and then
he would stagger off to bed to fall asleep again almost immedi
also hi hand trembl much and he began to lose flesh all thi
troubl me for hi own sake as well as my own and i resolv to ask
him to see the doctor of the next mailsteam that came with thi
idea i went on dai to the end of the point and found him in hi usual
attitud seat on the long grass look seaward he did not hear me
approach and when i spoke he start to hi feet and demand fierc
why i disturb him i repli as mildli as i could for i wa rather
afraid of the glitter look that wa in hi ey that i wish to ask
him if he did not feel ill
he regard me with a steadi but soften glanc for a littl and then
said
my lad i thank you for your troubl but i want no doctor do you
think im look ill
inde you ar i answer ill and thin and do you know i hear
you talk to yourself in your sleep nearli everi night
what do i sai he ask eagerli
that i cannot tell i repli it is all rambl talk the same
thing over and over again and nearli all about on personluci
boi he cri out as if in pain or as if someth had touch him
to the quick sit you down and ill tell you why i think of hersh
wa my wife
he move nearer to the edg of the cliff and we sat down almost over
the restless sea beneath us
she live in my memori he continu speak more to himself than
to me and look far out to the horizon beneath which the set
sun had begun to sink in spite of all i can do or think of to make
her appear base in my ey for she left me to go with anoth mana
scoundrel thi wa how it wa he ad quickli i marri her and
thought her as pure as a flower but i could not take her to sea with
me becaus i wa onli the mate of a vessel so i left her among her
own friend in the villag where she wa born in a littl cottag by
herself i settl her comfort and happi as i thought god how
she hung round my neck and sob when i went awai the first time
and yetyetwithin a year she left me and he stop for sever
minut rest hi head upon hi hand at first i could get no trace
of her he resum her friend knew noth more of her than that
she had left the villag suddenli gradual i found out the name of the
scoundrel who had seduc her awai he had bribe her friend so that
thei were silent but i overbrib them with the last monei i had and
i follow him and my wife on foot i never found them nor did i ever
know why she had desert me for him if i had onli known the reason if
i could have been told of my fault if she had onli written to sai that
she wa tire of me that i wa too old too rough for her soft waysi
think i could have born the heavi stroke the villain had dealt me
better the end of my search wa that i drop down in the street of
liverpool whither i thought i had track them and wa carri to
the hospit with brainfev upon me two month afterward i came out
cure and the sens of my loss wa deaden within me so that i
could go to sea again which i did befor the mast under the name of
jackson in a bark that trade to thi coast here and the old sailor
rose to hi feet and turn abruptli awai leav me sit alon
i saw that he did not wish to be follow so i stai where i wa and
watch the grai twilight creep over the face of the sea and the night
quickli succe to it not a cloud had been in the sky all dai long and
as the dark increas the star came out until the whole heaven
were stud with glitter gem
suddenli low down close to the sea a point of light flicker and
disappear shone again for a moment waver and went out onli to
reappear and shine steadili a steamer masthead light i thought
and ran to the hous to give the new but jackson had alreadi seen
the light and pronounc that she had anchor until the morn at
daybreak there she wa dip her side to the swell of the sea as
it roll beneath her it wa my duti to go off to her in on of the
surfboat belong to the factori and so i scrambl down the cliff
to the littl strip of smooth beach that serv us for a landingplac
when i arriv there i found that the whitecrest breaker were
heavier than i had thought thei would be howev there wa the boat
ly on the beach with it prow toward the wave and round it were the
boatboi with their loincloth gird readi to start so i clamber
into the stern or ratherfor the boat wa shape alik at stem and
sternth end from which the steersman or patrao us hi long oar
with a shout the boi laid hold of the side of the boat and the next
moment it wa danc on the spent wave next to the beach the patrao
kept it head steadi and the boi jump in and seiz the oar and
began pull with a will stand up to their stroke slowli the
heavi craft gather wai and approach a dark and unbroken roller that
hasten toward the beach then the patrao shout to the crew and thei
lai on their oar and the wave with a roar burst right in front of the
boat send the sprai of it crest high abov our head
rema rema forca row strongli now shout the patrao speak
portugues as mostli all african coast nativ do and the crew gave
wai the next roller we had to meet in it strength and save for the
steadi forc of the patrao oar i believ it would have toss us
asid and we would have been swept under it curv wall of water as
it wa the good boat gave a mighti bound as it felt it forc and it
stem pitch high into the air as it slid down it broad back into the
deep
anoth and yet anoth wave were pass and we could now see them
break behind us shut out the beach from view then the last
roller wa overcom and there wa noth but the long heav of the
deep sea to contend against present we arriv at the steamer whose
side tower abov usan iron wall
a shout came to me pitch and lurch with the boat far below come
on board at onc but to come on board wa onli to be done by watch
a chanc as the boat rose on the top of a roller take such a on i
seiz the siderop swung a moment in midair and the next wa on
the streamer clean white deck befor me stood a tall man with black
hair and whisker and dark pierc ey who ask me if i wa the
agent for flint brother i answer that the agent wa on shore and
that i wa hi assist whereupon he inform me that he had been
appoint by the firm to liquid all their station and busi on
the coast and he would be oblig by my get hi luggag into the
boat thi wa said in a peremptori sort of wai as if he had spoken to
a servant and veri much against the grain i obei hi order
that the man wa new to the coast wa evid and my consol wa
that he would be veri soon sick of it and pretti well frighten befor
he even got on shore for the weather wa freshen rapidli a fact
of which he appear to take no heed not so the boatboi who were
anxiou to be off at last we start and i soon had my reveng as
we drew near the shore the roller becam higher and higher and i
perceiv that my gentleman clutch the gunwal of the boat veri
tightli and when the first wave that show sign of break overtook
us he grew veri white in the face until it had pass
the next on or two breaker were small much to hi relief i could see
though he said noth befor he had well recov hi equanim
howev a tremend wave approach us somewhat suddenli appal by
it threaten aspect he sprang from hi seat and seiz the arm of
the patrao who roughli shook him off
my god he cri we ar swamp and for the moment it realli
look like it but the patrao with a dexter sweep of hi long oar
turn the boat head toward the roller it broke just as it reach
us and gave us the benefit of it crest which came in over the
topsid of the boat as it pass by and delug everi on of us
i laugh although it wa no laugh matter at the plight the
liquid wa now in he wa chang in a moment from the spruce and
natti personag into a miser and draggl be from everi part of
him the salt water wa stream and the curl wa complet taken out
of hi whisker he could not speak from terror which the boatboi
soon saw for none ar quicker than negro to detect sign of fear
in those whom thei ar accustom to consid superior to themselv
familiar with the surf and full of mischiev fun thei began to shout
and gesticul with the settl purpos of make matter appear wors
than thei were and of enjoi the white man discomfitureal but
the patrao who wa an old hand and on whom depend the safeti of
us all he kept a steadi lookout seaward and stood upright and firm
grasp hi oar with both hand with him it wa a point of honour to
bring the white men intrust to hi care safe through the surf
we wait for more than half an hour bow on meet each roller as it
came to us and by the end of that time the unfortun liquid had
evid given up all hope of ever reach the shore luckili the
worst wa soon to pass after on last tremend wave there wa a lull
for a few moment and the patrao who had watch for such a chanc
swiftli turn the boat round and give the word to the crew thei
pull lustili toward the shore in a few minut we were again in
safeti the boat ground on the beach the oar were toss into the
sea the crew sprang overboard some of them seiz the new arriv i
clamber on the back of the patrao a crowd of negro who had been
wait on the beach laid hold of the towrop of the boat and it and
we were land simultan on the dry sand
onc on shore mr bransom for that wa the new man name rapidli
recov hi presenc of mind and manner and by wai of cover hi
past confus remark that he suppos the surf wa seldom so bad as
it then wa i repli in an offhand wai mean to make fun of him
that what he had pass through wa noth and appeal to the patrao
to confirm what i had said that negro see the joke grin all
over hi black face and mr bransom perceiv that he wa be
laugh at snatch a goodsiz stick from a nativ stand near and
struck the patrao repeatedli over the back
in vain sooka for that wa the patrao name protest and demand
to know what wrong thing he had done the agent wa furiou and
shower hi blow upon the black equal in vain i shout that sooka
had done well by us and that he mr bransom wa make an enemi of
a man who would have him now and then in hi power at length sooka
took to hi heel and sure enough when he had got a littl wai off he
began to threaten vengeanc for what he had receiv i sympathis with
him for i knew what a loss to hi digniti it wa to be beaten without
caus befor hi fellow and i fear that mr bransom would inde be
sorri sooner or later for what he had done
i now suggest to him by wai of divert hi thought from poor
sooka that stand on the beach in wet cloth wa the veri wai to
catch the coastfev straight off and he instantli suffer himself to
be carri up the factori there jackson receiv him in a sort of
who on earth ar you manner and mr bransom clear hi throat
announc himself and hi author ad that he intend to make the
factori a point of departur to all the other on the coast then
veri abruptli he request jackson to prepar quarter for him without
delai
the chang that came over jackson face as he learn the qualiti of
the stranger and hi request wa great the old salt who had been king
of hi hous and of the point for so long a time had evid
never even thought of the probabl of such an intrus as wa now
present to him and he wa amaz at what he consid to be the
unwarrant assur of the stranger howev he recov himself
smartli and ask the new man if he had ani written credenti
certainli repli he pull out a document all wet with salt water
here is a letter from messr flint brother of which no doubt you
will have a copi in your mailbag
jackson took the letter and open it and seem to read it slowli to
himself all at onc he start look at the new agent advanc a
step or two toward him mutter bransom bransom then stop
and ask him in a strang constrain voic is your name bransom
ye repli the latter astonish at the old man question
i knew a bransom onc said jackson steadili and he wa a
scoundrel
for a moment the two men look at each otherjackson with a gleam of
hatr in hi ey while bransom had a curious frighten express
on hi face which blanch slightli but he quickli resum hi
composur and peremptori wai and said show me a room i must get
these wet thing off me
as howev he address himself thi time to me rather than to
jacksonwho inde regard him no longer but stood with the letter
loos in hi hand look at the floor of the room as if in deep
meditationi show him into my own room where i order hi trunk
to be brought these of cours were wet but he found some thing in
the middl of them that were not more than slightli damp and with the
help of a pair of old canva trouser of mine he manag to make hi
appear at dinnertim
jackson wa not at the meal he had left the hous shortli after hi
interview with the new agent and had i fanci gone on on of hi
solitari rambl at ani rate he did not return until late that night
i thought mr bransom seem to be somewhat reliev when he saw
that the old man wa not come and he becam more affabl than i had
expect him to be and relinquish hi arrog style altogeth when
he began to question me about jacksonwho he wa what had he been
how long he had live on the coast to all which question i return
cautiou answer rememb that i wa under a promis to the old man
not to repeat hi stori
by the next morn to my surpris jackson appear to have becom
reconcil to the fact that he had been supersed by a man who knew
noth of the coast and of hi own accord he offer to tell mr
bransom the clue to the letterlock on the door of the variou
storeroom for we on the coast us none but letterlock which
ar lock that do not requir a kei to open them but mr bransom
express most polit a wish that jackson should consid himself
still in charg of the factori at ani rate until the whole estat of
the unfortun flint brother could be wound up and he trust that
hi presenc would make no differ to him
thi wa a chang on the part of both men from the manner of the
previou dai and yet i could not help think that each but ill
conceal hi avers to the other
month now slip awai and mr bransom wa occupi in go up and
down the coast in a littl steamer shut up factori after factori
transfer their good to our and get himself much dislik by
all the european under him and hate by the nativ especi by
the boatboi who were a race or tribe by themselv come from on
particular part of the coast he had of cours been oblig to order
the dismiss of mani of them and thi wa on reason why thei hate
him but the chief caus wa hi treatment of sooka the patrao that
man never forgav mr bransom for beat him so unjustli and the
new of the deed had travel veri quickli as new doe in savag
countri so that i think nearli all of sooka countrymen knew of the
act and resent it
mr bransom wa quit unawar of the antipathi he had thu creat
toward himself except so far as sooka wa concern and him he never
emploi when he had to go off to vessel or land from them but alwai
went in the other boat belong to the factori which wa steer by a
much younger negro in addit to humbl sooka in thi wai bransom
took the opportun of disgrac him whenev he could do so
therefor on dai when two piec of cloth from the cargoroom were
found in the boatmen hut it wa no surpris to me that sooka wa at
onc fasten upon by mr bransom as the thief who had stolen them
and that he wa ti to the floggingpost in the middl of the yard and
sentenc to receiv fifti lash with the cat that wa kept for such
a purpos and all without ani inquiri be made in vain did the
unfortun man protest hi innoc a swarthi krootboi from cape
coast laid the cat on hi brown shoulder right willingli for he also
wa an enemi of sooka and in a few minut the poor fellow flesh
wa cut and score as if by a knife
after the flog wa over mr bransom amus himself by get out
hi rifl and fire fanci shot at sooka still ti to the post that
is he tri to put the bullet as close to the poor wretch as he could
without actual wound him to a negro with hi dread of firearm
thi wa littl short of absolut tortur and at each discharg sooka
writh and crouch as close to the ground as he could while hi
wideopen ey and mouth and face of almost a slate colour show
how terribl frighten he wa to mr bransom it appear to be
fine sport for he fire at least twenti shot at the man befor he
shoulder hi rifl and went indoor jackson said noth to thi
stupid exhibit of temper but as soon as it wa over he had sooka
releas and i knew he attend to hi wound himself and pour
friar balsam into them and cover hi back with a soft shirtfor
all which no doubt the negro wa afterward grate whether mr
bransom got to know of thi and wa offend at it i do not know but
shortli afterward he ceas to live with us
there wa between the factori and the sea and a littl to the right of
the former a small wooden cottag which had been allow to fall into a
dilapid state from want of some on to live in it thi mr bransom
gave order to the nativ carpent to repair and make weathertight
and when thei had done so he caus a quantiti of furnitur to be
brought from st paul de loanda and place within in it then he
transfer himself and hi baggag to the cottag
jackson displai complet indiffer to thi chang on the part of
the agent in fact there had been ever sinc the arriv of the latter
upon the point and in spite of appar friendli a percept
breach widen daili between the two men as to the reason of thi i
had my own suspicion for i had made the discoveri that jackson had for
some time past been drink veri heavili
in addit to the brandi which we white men had for our own us i had
to my horror found out that he wa secretli drink the coars
and fieri rum that wa sold to the nativ and as i rememb the
mutter and moan that had formerli alarm me i wonder that i
had not guess the caus of them at the time but until the arriv of
mr bransom jackson had alwai kept charg of the spirit himself and
he wa such a secret old fellow that there wa no know what he had
then taken now that i wa awar of hi fail i wa veri sorri for
the old sailor for on such a coast and in such a climat there wa onli
on end to it and although i could not actual prevent him from take
the liquor i resolv to watch him and if such symptom as i had seen
befor again appear to tell mr bransom of them at all hazard but
i wa too late to prevent what speedili follow my discoveri it had
come about that the same mailsteam that had brought out mr bransom
had again anchor off the point and again the weather wa coars and
lower a stiff breez had blown for some dai which made the roller
wors than thei had been for a long while both mr bransom and jackson
watch the weather with eager look but each wa differ affect
by it bransom appear to be anxiou and nervou while jackson wa
excit and pace up and down the veranda and kept strang to sai
for it wa contrari to hi late habit a watch upon bransom everi
movement
everi now and then too he would rub hi hand togeth as if in eager
expect and would chuckl to himself as he glanc seaward of hi
own accord he gave order to sooka to get both the surfboat readi for
launch and to make the boi put on their newest loincloth and
then when everyth wa in readi he ask bransom if he wa
go off to the steamer
i fear i must said bransom but ii dont like the look of those
curs roller
at thi jackson laugh and said someth about be afraid of veri
littl
the beach is perfectli good he ad sooka know and sooka is the
oldest patrao on the point
and sooka who wa stand by made a low obeis to the agent and
said that the beach live for well which wa hi wai of express in
english that the sea wa not heavi
at that moment a gun wa fire from the steamer as a signal to be quick
and bransom said i will go but not in that black blackguard boat
it need not come and he went down to the beach
it wa on of jackson rule that when a boat went through the surf
there should be some on to watch it so i walk to the end of the
point to see the agent put off he got awai safe and i see
sooka boat ly on the beach and think that it would be as well
to have it haul up under the boatsh wa on the point of return
to the factori to give the necessari order when to my surpris i saw
the boat crew rush down the beach to the boat and begin to push it
toward the sea
i wave my arm as a signal to them to stop but thei paid no attent
to me and i saw them run the boat into the water jump into her and
pull off all sing a song to their stroke in their own languag
the sound of which came faintli up to the top of the point stupid
fellow i mutter to myself thei might have known that the boat
wa not want and i wa again about to turn awai when i wa suddenli
seiz from behind and carri to the veri edg of the cliff and then
as suddenli releas
i sprang to on side and turn round saw jackson with a look of such
savag furi on hi face that i retreat a step or two in astonish
at him he perceiv my alarm and burst out into a fit of laughter
which instead of reassur me had the opposit effect it wa
so demoniac in charact ha ha he laugh again ar you
frighten and advanc toward me he put hi face close to mine
peer into it with bloodshot ey while hi breath reek of
spirit pour into my nostril
involuntarili i put up my arm to keep him off he clutch it and
point with hi other hand to the sea whisper hoars what do
you hear of the surf will the breaker be heavier befor sundown see
how thei begin to curv listen how thei alreadi thunder thunder
on the beach i tell you thei ar impatientthei seek some on he
shout do you know he continu lower hi voic again and
speak almost confidenti sooner or later some on is drown
upon that bar and even as he spoke a fresh line of breaker aros from
the deep farther out than ani had been befor thi much i observ
but i wa too greatli unnerv by the strang manner of jackson to pai
further heed to the sea it had flash across my mind that he wa on
the verg of an attack of delirium tremen from the effect of the
liquor he had been consum for so long and the problem wa to get him
back to the hous quietli
suddenli a thought struck me put my arm within hi i said
as coolli as i could never mind the sea jackson let us have a
matabicho our local express for a drink he took the bait and
came awai quietli enough to the hous onc there i entic him into
the diningroom and shut to the door quickli i lock it on the
outsid resolv to keep him there until mr bransom should return
for be alon i wa afraid of him
then i went back to the end of the point to look for the return of the
two boat when i reach it i saw that the roller had increas
in size in the short time that i had been absent and that thei were
break on after anoth as fast as thei could come shoreward not
pygmi wave but great wall of water along their huge length befor
thei fell
a surf such as i had never yet seen had arisen i stood and anxious
watch through a glass the boat at the steamer side and at length
to my relief i saw on of them leav her but as it came near i saw to
my surpris that mr bransom wa not in the boat and that it wa not
the on that sooka steer quickli it wa overtaken by the breaker
but escap their power and came inshor on the back of a majest
roller that did not break until it wa close to the beach where the
boat wa in safeti
not without vagu apprehens at hi imprud but still not
anticip ani actual harm from it i thought that mr bransom had
chosen to come back in sooka boat and i wait and wait to see it
return although the daylight had now so wane that i could no longer
distinguish what wa go on alongsid the steamer at last i caught
sight of the boat a white speck upon the water and just as it
enter upon the danger part of the bar i discern to my infinit
amaz that two figur were seat in the sterna man and a
womana white woman i could see her dress flutter in the wind and
sooka black figur stand behind her
on came the boat impel by the swiftflow sea for a quarter of
an hour it wa toss on the crest of the wave again and again it
rose and sank with them as thei came roll in but somehow after
a littl further time it seem to me that it did not make such wai
toward the shore as it should have done
i lift the glass to my ey and i saw that the boi were hardli
pull at all though the boat wa not close to the rock that were
near the cliff nor did sooka seem to be consciou of a huge roller that
wa swiftli approach him in my excit i wa just on the point of
shout to warn those in the boat of their danger although i knew that
thei could not understand what i might sai when i saw jackson stand
on the edg of the cliff a littl wai off dress in hi shirt and
trouser onli he had escap from the hous he perceiv that i saw
him and came run up on me and i threw myself on my guard howev
he did not attempt to touch me but stop and cri
did i not tell you that somebodi would be drown by those wave watch
that boat watch it it is doom and the scoundrel the villain who
is in it will never reach the shore aliv and he hiss the last word
through hi clench teeth
good god jackson i said dont sai that look there is a white
woman in the boat
at the word hi jaw drop hi form which a moment befor had swai
with excit becam rigid and hi ey stare at me as if he knew
but comprehend not what i had said then he slowli turn hi face
toward the sea and as he did so the mighti breaker that had been
come up astern of the boat curl over it for a moment or two it
rush forward a solid bodi of water carri the boat with it and
in those moment i saw to my horror sooka give on sweep with hi oar
which threw the boat side toward the roller i saw the boatboi leap
clear of the boat into the surf i saw the agonis face of the man and
the woman upturn to the wave abov them and then the billow broke
and noth wa seen but a sheet of frothi water the boat and those in
it had disappear for the crew i had littl concerni knew thei would
come ashor safe enough but for mr bransom and the woman
whoever she wa there wa littl hope thei had not had time to throw
themselv into the sea befor the boat had capsiz and their cloth
would sink them in such a surf even if thei had escap be crush
by the boat besid i fear there had been some foul plai on the part
of sooka quickli as he had done it i had seen him with hi oar put the
boat beyond the possibl of escap from the wave and i rememb
how he had been treat by bransom
with such thought i ran along the cliff to the pathwai that led down to
the beach and as i ran i saw jackson run befor me not steadili
or rightli but heavili and swai from side to side as he went
quickli i pass him but he gave no sign that he knew ani on wa near
him and as i leap down on to the first ledg of rock below me i saw
that he wa not follow me but had disappear among the brushwood
when i got down to the beach i found that the boat crew had reach
the shore in safeti but of the two passeng noth had been seen
the capsiz boat wa sometim visibl as it lift on the roller
but through my glass i saw that no on wa cling to it i call for
sooka but sooka wa miss everi on had seen him land but he had
disappear mysteri in vain i question the other boi as to the
caus of the disast the onli answer i could get out of them wa an
appeal to look to the sea and judg for myself the woman wa a
white woman from the big ship wa all thei could sai about her and
negrolik thei evid consid the loss of a woman or so of veri
littl consequ
all i could do wa to set a watch along the beach to look for the bodi
when thei should be wash ashor and thi done i return to the
factori my next desir wa to find sooka he could hardli have gone
far so i sent for a runner to take a messag to the nativ king under
whose protect we on the point were and after whom the point wa
call and who wa bound to find the miss man for me if he could or
if he had not been bribe to let him pass
in my sorrow at what had happen and in my doubt as to the caus of
it i had forgotten all about jackson but after i had despatch
my messeng to the king i went to look for him i discov him
crouch in a corner of hi own bedroom in the dark
ar thei found he ask in a voic so hollow and broken that i
hardli knew it and befor i could answer him he whisper to himself
no no thei ar drowneddrown
i tri to lead him into the light diningroom but he onli crouch
the closer to hi corner at length by the promis of the everpot
temptat liquor i got him to leav the room he could scarc walk
though now and he trembl so violent that i wa glad to give him
part of a bottl of brandi that i had by me he fill a tumbler half
full of the spirit and drank it off thi put strength into him and
for a littl he wa calm but as he again and again appli himself to
the bottl he becam drunk and swore at me for my impud in give
order without hi sanction on thi i tri to take the bottl from
him but he clutch it so firmli that i had to let it go whereupon he
immedi put it to hi lip and swallow the rest of the liquor that
wa in it after which he gave a chuckl and stagger to a couch on
which he tumbl and lai with hi ey open for a long while at last
he fell asleep but i wa too nervou to do likewis and sat watch
him the most of the night at least when i awok it wa daylight and
it seem to me that i had been asleep for a few minut
jackson wa still ly on the couch and hi face wa calm and peac
as he softli breath the morn too wa fine and as i walk on to
the veranda i saw the sea sparkl in the sunlight and there wa not
a sound from it save a faroff and drowsi murmur not a sign remain
on it broad surfac of the wrath of the dai befor it wa wonderfulli
calm ly here and there on the veranda roll up in their cloth
were the servant of the factori sleep soundli on the hard plank
present as the sun rose in the heaven and warm the air the place
began to show sign of life and on of the watch that i had set on the
beach came run across the yard to tell me that the bodi had come
ashor
immedi upon hear thi i call the hammockbear togeth
and go down to the beach i went a consider wai along it toward
a dark spot which i knew to be a group of nativ on come up to the
group i found at least fifti negro collect round the drown man
and woman all chatter and squabbl among themselv and probabl
over the plunder for i saw that the bodi had been strip to
their undercloth rush into the crowd with the aid of a stick
i dispers it so far as to make the wretch stand back the man of
cours wa bransom there wa no doubt as to that although he had
receiv a terribl blow on the left templ most like from the
point stem of the boat as it had toppl over upon him and hi face
wa distort and twist to on side the woman wa evid english
young and pretti although her long hair heavi and wet wa pollut by
the sand that stuck to it and her halfopen ey were fill with
the same on her lip there linger a slight smile she wa of middl
height of slender figur and delic nurtur as the small
bare feet and littl hand show as i look at the latter i saw a
weddingr on her finger and i thought it is bransom wife i
tri to take the ring awai but it would not come off her fingerwhich
i might have known becaus the nativ would not have left it there
had thei been abl to remov it i then order the bearer to lai the
bodi in the hammock and that done our littl parti wend it wai
along the shore homeward while the nativ i had dispers follow on
after anoth in african fashion
arriv at the factori i bade the boi place the bodi side by side on
a spare bed in an empti room and then i sent them to dig a grave in the
littl burialground on the point where two or three wormeaten wooden
cross mark the restingplac of former agent of messr flint
brother
as quick inter wa necessari in such a climat even on that veri
dai i went to call jackson in order that he might perform the duti
that wa histhat of read the burial servic over the dead and of
seal up the desk and effect of mr bransom but jackson wa not in
the factori i guess howev where he wa and sure enough i found
him in hi accustom haunt at the end of the point the moment he saw
me he tri to hide himself among the brushwood but i wa too quick for
him and spi him as he crouch behind a dwarf palm
i know i know he cri as i ran up to him i saw you come along
the beach buri them buri them out of sight
come mr jackson i repli it isnt fair to put all the troubl on
to me i am sure i have had enough of the weari and anxieti of thi
sad busi you must take your share of it i want you to read the
servic for the dead over them
no no he almost shriek buri them quick never mind me put them
out of sight
i will not i said resolut for your own sake you must at ani
rate view the bodi
thei have not been murder he repli but the startl look with
which i receiv the suggest hi word impli seem to make him
recollect himself for he rose and took my arm without sai more as
he did so i felt for the first time a sort of repugn toward him
up to that moment my feel had been on of piti and anxieti on hi
account but now i loath him thi he seem instinct to feel
and he clung close to me
onc at the factori i determin that there should be no more delai on
hi part and i took him to the door of the room where the bodi had
been laid but at it he made a sudden halt and would not enter cover
hi face with hi hand he trembl violent as i push the door open
and advanc to the bedsid the room hush and in semidark the
white sheet whose surfac show too plainli the form beneath it
and the scare terrifi face of the man who with brain afir
stood watch with stare ey the bed made a scene i have never
forgotten
slowli i turn down the upper part of the sheet and jackson as if
fascin by the act advanc a step or two into the room but with
face avert gradual he turn it toward the bodi and for a moment
hi gaze rest upon them the next instant he stagger forward look
at the woman face pant for breath onc or twice and then with
uplift hand and a wild cry of luci fell hi length upon the floor
when i stoop over him he wa in convuls and dark matter wa
ooz out of hi mouth the climax had come i shout for the
servant and thei carri him to hi own room and place him on hi
own bed
how i got through that dai i hardli know alon i buri bransom
and hi wife and alon i return from the hurri task to watch by
jackson bedsid none of the nativ would stai near him for two dai
he lai unconsci at the end of that time he seem to have some idea
of the outsid world for hi ey met mine with intellig in their
look and on bend over him i heard him whisper forgiv me then
he relaps into unconsci again through the long hour hi ey
remain ever open and restless he could not eat nor did he sleep and
i wa afraid he would pass awai through weak without a sign
be an old man on the third dai he becam deliri and commenc
chatter and talk to himself and imagin that all kind of
horrid shape and creatur were around and near him i had to watch him

that had been ly on the tabl in an instant the great round globe
fell to piec but luckili the chimnei wa not broken and the lamp
remain alight and befor he could strike anoth blow at it i had
grappl with him again thi time he struggl violent for a few
moment and seem to think that he wa deal with bransom for he

in a tone of weird and pathet sorrow where is my littl on that i
love i have sought her mani a year oh why did she forsak me aha
sooka we were right to send him to the hell whenc he cameth ly
falseheart scoundrel to steal awai my white dove
after which he drew from hi finger a solid gold ring which he alwai
wore and threw it from him sai with a wild laugh there that
for ani on that like it im a dead man he then stagger toward hi

realis in the sudden still that had come upon the room that i wa
alon yet he had pass awai so quietli after hi fit fever that i
could not bring myself to believ that he wa realli gone and i stood
look at the bodi fear to convinc myself of the truth by touch

so entranc wa i by that feel of aw which come to almost everi
on in the presenc of death that i did not hear the shout of the
hammockboi outsid or the footstep of a white man come into
the room and not until he touch me on the shoulder did i turn and
recognis the sallow face of the portugues doctor whom i had sent for
and who had thu arriv too late howev he serv to help me to buri
the mortal part of jackson in the littl graveyard besid the bodi of
hi wife and that of the man who had come between them when aliv and
such wa without doubt the fact for when the doctor had gone and i
wa alon again i collect and made an inventori of the dead men
effect and in jackson desk i found hi diari or as he himself
would have call it hi log and in that log wa note on the veri
dai that bransom had arriv on the point hi suspicion of the man

hiram whitson also appli for ten dai leav of absencelikewis to
proce to pietermaritzburgth leav wa grant but the offic in
charg of the detach laughingli remark that he hope thei were not
go to follow dollond and frank
now neither langlei nor whitson had the remotest idea of visit
pietermaritzburg it is necessari of cours for the reader to know
where thei did intend go to and how the intent aros but befor
do thi we must deal with some anteced circumst
langlei wa most certainli the most boyishlook man in the forc he
had a perfectli smooth face ruddi complexion and fair hair he wa of
middl height and wa rather inclin to stout he wa so fond of
talk that hi comrad nicknam him magpi a colonist by birth
he could speak the kaffir languag like a nativ
whitson wa a sallowfac sparebuilt man of short statur with
darkbrown beard and hair and pierc black ey hi ag wa about
forti he had a wiri and terrierlik appear a downeast yanke
he had spent some year in mexico and then drift to south africa
dure the war period which it will be rememb last from 1877 to
1882 he had serv in the zulu war as a noncommiss offic in on
of the irregular cavalri corp with some credit the fact of hi be
a man of extrem few word wa enough to account for the friendship
which exist between him and the garrul langlei whitson wa known
to be a dead shot with the revolv
thi is how thei came to appli for leav on dai langlei wa stroll
about just outsid the line look for somebodi to talk to when he
notic an appar veri old nativ man sit on an antheap and
regard him somewhat intent thi old nativ had been sever time
seen in the vicin of the camp but he never seem to speak to ani
on and he look so harmless that the polic did not even troubl to
ask him for the written pass which all nativ ar oblig by law to
carri when thei move about the countri the old man salut langlei
and ask in hi own languag for a pipe of tobacco langlei alwai
carri some loos leav broken up in hi pocket so he at onc pull
some of these out and half fill the clawlik hand outstretch to
receiv them the old nativ wa volubl in hi thank there wa a
larg antheap close to the on on which he had been sit and on
which he reseat himself while fill hi pipe against thi langlei
lean and took a good look at hi companion the man had a most
extraordinari face hi lower jaw and cheekbon were larg
develop but langlei hardli notic thi so struck wa he with
the strang format of the upper jaw that portion of the superior
maxillari bone which li between the socket of the eyeteeth
protrud with the socket to a remark degre and instead of
be curv appear to be quit straight the incisor teeth were veri
larg and white but it wa the develop of the eyeteeth that wa
most startl these besid be veri massiv were produc below
the level of the incisor to a depth of nearli a quarter of an inch
thei distinctli suggest to langlei the tusk of a baboon
as is not veri unusu with nativ the man wa perfectli bald hi
back wa bent and hi limb were somewhat shrunken but he did not
appear in the least degre decrepit hi eyelid were veri red and hi
ey though dim had a deep and intent look ugli as wa the manor
perhap by virtu of hi uglinessh exercis a strang fascin
over langlei
the old man whose name turn out to be ghamba prove himself a talker
after langlei own heart thei discuss all sort of thing ghamba
startl hi hearer by hi breadth of experi and hi shrewd he
said he wa a hlubi kaffir from qumbu in the territori of griqualand
east but that he had for some time past been live in basutoland
which is situat just behind the frown wall of the drakensberg to
the southwest of where thei were speak and not twenti mile distant
thei talk until it wa time for langlei to return to camp he wa so
pleas at the entertain afford by ghamba that all the tobacco
he had with him found it wai into the clawlik hand of that
strangelook man of mani experi and quaint idea so langlei
ask him to come to the antheap again on the follow dai and have
anoth talk at the same hour thi ghamba with a wide and prolong
exposur of hi teeth readili agre to do
langlei wa extrem volubl to whitson that night over hi new
acquaint whitson listen with hi usual impass and then
ask langlei how it wa that an old loaf nigger as he express
it had impress him so remark langlei repli that he did not
quit know but he thought the effect wa larg due to the man
teeth but all the same he wa a veri entertain old buffer
next afternoon langlei wa so impati to resum convers with hi
new friend that he repair to the antheap quit half an hour befor
the appoint time he had not howev long to wait as ghamba soon
appear emerg from a donga a coupl of hundr yard awai
langlei wa more impress than ever ghamba told him all about the
basuto among whom he had live about the old dai in natal befor
even the dutch occup when tshaka impi wipe whole tribe out of
exist of the recent war in zululand and the cape coloni and as
to the probabl of futur disturb charm as wa langlei by the
old man convers he felt that on thi occas there wa a littl
too much of it that ghamba wa not nearli so good a listen as he had
been on the previou dai so when the latter at length put a question
to him thu afford an opportun for the exercis of hi own pentup
loquac langlei felt elat more especi as sever inquiri
were group togeth in the on ask ghamba ask whether anyth
had been heard of umhlonhlo whether the captur of that fugit rebel
wa consid like and whether it wa true that a reward of five
hundr pound had been offer by the govern for hi captur dead
or aliv
umhlonhlo it will be rememb wa the pondomis chief who rebel
in 1880 treacher murder mr hope the magistr of qumbu and
hi two companion and who ha sinc been an outlaw with a price on hi
head
langlei repli to the effect that it wa quit true such a reward had
been offer as to umhlonhlo whereabout but that the govern
believ him to be in pondoland that he wa sure to be captur
eventu that he langlei onli wish he knew where umhlonhlo wa
so as to have the chanc of make five hundr pound with which to bui
a certain nice littl farm he knew of and that should he ever succe
in obtain the reward and consequ in take hi discharg and
purchas the farm he would be jolli glad if old ghamba would come and
live with him thi is onli some of what he said when langlei tongu
got into motion he seem to have some difficulti in stop it
howev he paus at last and then ghamba look veri intent at
him said
look here can you keep a secret
here wa a mysteri
rather said langlei
will you swear by the name of god that you will not reveal what i have
to tell you
langlei swore
ghamba drew near until hi teeth were within a few inch of langlei
cheek and said in a whisper
i know where umhlonhlo is
langlei start and said in an aw voic
where is he
wait a bit said ghamba perhap i will tell you and perhap i
wont i like you you have given me tobacco and you ar not too proud
to come and talk to a poor old man now you sai you would like to make
five hundr pound and bui a farm
rather
and that you would let me go and live on the farm with you and end my
dai in peac
i would gladli
well then if i take you to where umhlonhlo is and you will kill him
and get the monei will you give me twentyf pound and let me keep
a few goat and grow a few meali on your land
i should think i would but how could on man take or kill umhlonhlo
thei sai he is well arm and that he ha a lot of follow with him
umhlonhlo said ghamba glanc anxious round as if he fear the
veri antheap were listen is hide in a cave in the mountain
not three dai walk from here he ha not got a singl man with him
becaus he fear be given up he is realli in hide from hi own
follow now my sister is on of hi wive and that is how i know all
about it i pass the cave where he live four night ago and saw him
sit by the fire he ha onli a few women with him
and how do you think i should take him
take him you should kill him i will guid you to the cave by night
and then you can shoot him as he sit by the fire
langlei although no coward wa not particularli brave he did not much
relish the idea of alon tackl the redoubt umhlonhlo a savag of
muscl who wa report to be alwai arm to the teeth moreov
he had no gun and wa but an indiffer shot with a revolv so he
thought over the matter for a few moment and then said
look here ghamba i do not care to tackl thi job alon but if i can
take anoth man with me i am on
then you will onli get half of the five hundr pound and will not be
abl to bui the farm you need not be afraid you can shoot him without
hi see you
no said langlei after a paus i will not go alon but if you
will let me take anoth man with me it can be manag it will make no
differ to you you will get your twentyf pound
and how about my go to live on the farm with you
well i could not bui the farm for two hundr and fifti pound come
we will give you fifti pound instead of twentyf
ghamba thought for a while and then said
veri well i consent but there need be onli on other man and you
will write down on a piec of paper that you will give me fifti pound
when can we start
i must speak to the other man and then we will appli for leav we had
better start soon or els umhlonhlo mai have gone to some other place

then settl all about it
you must not mention thi matter to ani on els and you must make
your friend promis to keep the secret
oh that all right said langlei meet me here tomorrow just
after dinner
langlei went back to camp ghamba look after hi retreat figur
with a smile that reveal hi teeth in a veri strike manner langlei
wa intens excit and exact quit unnecessarili the most solemn
promis from whitson not to divulg the great secret which he confid
to him whitson agre at onc to join in the enterpris which wa on
after hi own heart
next dai the three met at the big antheap and whitson wa veri
much impress by ghamba teeth he told langlei afterward that thei
remind him of a pictur of the devil which he had seen in a copi of
pilgrim progress the old man stori appear howev consist
enough in spite of hi peculiar dentit
so after a short convers langlei and whitson return to camp
have made an appoint to meet ghamba again on the follow morn
at sunris so as to final arrang as to time of start etc thei
went at onc to the offic in charg of the detach and appli
for ten dai leav of absenc for the purpos of proceed to
pietermaritzburg which wa at onc grant
next morn thei met ghamba again and agre to start on their
expedit that even he explain that thei must do all their
travel by night and lie by dure the dai becaus it would never
do for him ghamba to run the risk of be recognis by person whom
thei might meet for the sake of hi hlubi relat who were live
among the pondomis at qumbu it wa absolut necessari that he should
not appear in the transact at all were it ever to be even suspect
that he had betrai the chief not alon would he be certainli kill
but all hi relat would be shun by the other nativ he wa an
old man so for him person noth matter veri much but a man
is bound to consid the interest of hi famili travel onli
by night and ly still and hidden dure the dai were therefor
absolut necessari stipul and langlei and whitson agre to
them as intellig and reason all be settl the latter
start for the camp ghamba bare hi teeth excess as thei walk
awai
at dusk on the even of the same dai langlei and whitson met ghamba
onc more at the larg antheap and the three at onc proceed on
their cours the onli arm taken were revolv of the govern
regul pattern breechload central fire thei carri
provis calcul to last eight dai but took no blanket on
account of have to travel at night when ghamba volunt to reliev
them of a consider share of their respect load langlei and
whitson were fill with grate surpris
the plan wa as follow whitson wa to shoot umhlonhlo and then remain
in the cave while langlei return to the camp to report what had been
done and caus person who could identifi the bodi to be sent for thei
seem to have had no scrupl as to the deed thei meant to do certainli
umhlonhlo deserv no more merci than a beast of prei nor doe it seem
to have struck them that possibl thei might shoot the wrong man but
there wa an air of convict about the manner in which ghamba show
hi teeth when ask whether he wa posit as to the ident of the
man in the cave that would have dissip the doubt of most men
besid thi he drew out the written undertak which thei had
deliv to him and said with a profoundli businesslik look
do i not want the monei should i take all thi troubl if i did not
know what i were do
thei walk all night onli rest onc or twice for a few minut
it wa found that ghamba in spite of hi ag wa an extrem good
walker and when thei halt at daylight langlei wa so done up that
he could not have held out for anoth halfhour whitson the wiri had
not yet felt the least fatigu
thi march had taken them to the veri foot of the drakensberg rang
and thei rest in a vallei between two of it main spur here thei
remain all dai comfort locat in a shelter nook where there
wa plenti of dry grass their restingplac wa encircl by immens
rock although the surround countri wa desol to a degre and
neither a human be nor an anim wa to be seen ghamba would not
hear of their light a fire nor leav the spot where thei rest
the weather wa clear and neither too warm nor too cold thei slept at
interv dure the dai and at even felt quit recov from their
fatigu
at nightfal thei again start their cours lead steepli up the
gorg in which thei had rest although the pathwai becam more and
more indistinct ghamba appear never to be at a loss langlei sever
time shudder when thei pass by the veri edg of some immens
precipic or clamber along some steep mountainsid where a fals
step would have meant destruct he began to show sign of fatigu
soon after midnight so at ghamba suggest a consider portion of
hi load wa transfer to the shoulder of whitson who seem to be
as tireless as ghamba himself
at daybreak thei halt in the depth of anoth tremend gorg
with precipit side the sceneri in thi particular area of the
drakensberg rang the neighbourhood of the mont aux sourc is
indescrib grand and impress and is quit unlik anyth els
in south africa enorm and fantast shape mountain ar here
huddl togeth indiscrimin and between them wind and doubl deep
gloomi gorg along the bottom of which mighti boulder ar thickli
strewn on dizzi ledg and steep slope dens thicket of wild bamboo
grow and a few stunt tree fill some of the less deep cleft
wherev the sunshin can penetr splendid as is the sceneri it
gloom it still it nake crag and peak it dark depth that
seem to cleav to the veri vital of the earth becom so oppress
that after a few dai spent among them the travel is fill with
repuls and almost horror few live thing have their home there
you might meet an occasion klipspring an antelop in habit and
appear somewhat like the chamoi a wander troop of baboon and
now and then a herd of eland in the more grassi area there ar said to
be a few bushmen still haunt the cave but thei ar seldom or never
seen
in the afternoon the sun shone into the gorg in which the travel
were rest and for a few hour the heat wa veri oppress whitson
examin hi revolv remov the cartridg and replac them by
other he then lai down to sleep ask langlei to remain awak and
keep a lookout he had a vagu feel of uneasi which he could not
overcom langlei promis to keep awak but he wa too tire to do so
he sat with hi back against a rock and after some futil effort to
keep hi ey open fell fast asleep byandbi ghamba woke him gentli
and point to whitson whose revolv lai in the leather case close
to hi hand whisper
did he not tell you to keep awak
langlei wa grate for thi evid of consider but he could
not quit make out how ghamba had been abl to understand what whitson
had said howev when the latter awok langlei said noth to him
about have disobei instruct
ghamba said that about two hour walk would now bring them to
umhlonhlo cave so thei start off briskli at dusk their cours now
led for some distanc along a mountain ledg cover with wild bamboo
through which the pathwai wound then thei cross a steep saddl
between two enorm peak after which thei plung into anoth deep
and wind gorg thi thei follow until thei reach a part where
it wa so narrow that the side seem almost to touch over their head
beyond the cliff fell apart and then appar curv toward each
other again thu form an immens amphitheatr at the entranc to
thi ghamba stop and said in a whisper that thei were now close to
the cave
thei now held a consult in term of which it wa decid that
ghamba should go forward and reconnoitr so whitson and langlei sat
down close togeth and wait convers in low tone
whitson felt veri uneasi but langlei tri to argu him out of
hi fear the more whitson saw of ghamba the more he dislik and
distrust him and hi teeth the instinct which detect danger in the
absenc of ani appar evid of it exist is a faculti develop
in some men by an adventur life thi faculti whitson possess in a
high degre
did you keep awak all the time i slept thi afternoon he ask
langlei fear whitson and felt inclin to lie but someth impel
him almost against hi will to speak the truth now
no he repli i slept for a few minut
whitson drew hi revolv and open the breech
by god he said the cartridg ar gone
langlei took hi weapon out of the leather case and open it he found
the cartridg were there right enough
have you ani spare cartridg ask whitson
whitson had alreadi load hi revolv with the five cartridg
which he had remov in the afternoon but he again took these out and
replac them in hi waistcoat pocket and then he reload with some
which langlei pass over to him with a trembl hand
look here he said in a hoars whisper we ar in a trap of some
kind when that old scoundrel come back do not let him know that we
have found out anyth we will walk on with him for a short distanc
at all event and then be guid by circumst stand by when you
see me collar him and slip a sack over hi head
can we not go back now said langlei
certainli not we would never find our wai at night i guess we must
see thi circu out if you have to shoot aim low
in a few minut ghamba return
come on he said he is sit at the fire in front of the cave i
have just seen him
where is the cave ask whitson is it far from here
we will reach it veri soon you can see the light of the fire from a
few pace ahead
thei walk on for about fifti yard and there sure enough over a
rocki slope to their left and at the foot of a crag about three hundr
yard awai could be seen the bright and fit glow from a fire which
wa hidden from their view by a low ridg of piledup rock
whitson stood still and question ghamba
now tell me he ask through langlei as interpret how we ar to
approach
the pathwai lead up on the left side repli ghamba we will walk
close up to the crag where there is a narrow passag between it and
that big black rock which you see against the light you two can lead
and i will be close behind i have just seen him he is sit at the
fire eat and onli the women ar with him
the last word were hardli out of the speaker mouth befor whitson had
seiz him by the throat with a vicelik grasp
seiz hi hand and hold them he hiss to langlei
ghamba struggl desper but could not releas himself whitson
compress hi throat until he becam unconsci and then gag him
with a pockethandkerchief ghamba hand were then ti tightli behind
hi back with anoth pockethandkerchief and hi feet were firmli
secur with a belt an empti sack from which thei had remov their
provis wa then drawn over hi head and shoulder and secur
round the waist
come on now quickli whisper whitson and he and langlei start
off in the direct of the fire after first take off their boot
thei did not approach by the cours which ghamba had indic but made
their wai quietli up the slope straight against the face of the crag
thei reach the heap of rock and crept in among them by mean of
anoth narrow passag close to the inner end of which the fire wa
and thi is what thei saw through the twig of a scrubbi bush which
effectu conceal them
a larg cave open into the side of the mountain and just befor the
mouth wa an open space about twenti yard in diamet surround on
all side except that of the mountain itself by a wall of loos
pile rock through which passag led out in differ direct
just in front of the cave burn a bright fire around which crouch
four most hideou and filthylook old hag and against which were
prop sever larg earthenwar pot of nativ make full of water
stand behind rock on at each side of the inner entranc to
the passag which wa evid that commun with the pathwai
indic by ghamba as the on thei were to approach by were two
powerfullook men stark nake and as black as eboni their skin
shine in the light of the fire each man held a coil thong in hi
hand after the manner of a sailor about to heav a line while thei
were look a woman somewhat younger in appear than ani of those
who sat by the fire came out of the cave carri a strong club about
three feet long she crouch down close to the man stand on the
leftsid of the passag who as well as hi companion stood as still
as a marbl statu and in an expect attitud
whitson and langlei with their revolv drawn suddenli step out
of their conceal and walk toward the fire thi evid
disconcert the men with the thong who appar did not expect
their intend prei to approach by ani cours except the passag near
which thei were stand but after a slight paus of hesit the
thong were whirl in the air and descend lassofashion upon
the shoulder of the intrud the noos caught langlei over hi
arm which were instantli drawn close against hi bodi as the thong
tighten so he wa thu render complet powerless but whitson
sprang quick as lightn to on side and escap three shot
from hi revolv rang out in as mani second and the two men and the
womanwho wa in the act of lift her club to brain langleylai
roll on the ground each with a bullet through the head
the four old hag at the fire began to mow and scream and got up and
hobbl into the cave whitson drew hi knife and cut the thong with
which langlei wa vainli struggl and then the two men pale as
death look silent at each other with stare ey
whitson replac hi revolv and then made a sort of torch out of dry
reed a pile of which lai close at hand he then leav langlei to
guard the cave carefulli examin all the passag and space between
the rock but he could find no trace of ani on the two men thereupon
enter the cave whitson hold the torch high over hi head thei

bodi of the men who had been shot wa ly on it side with the face
toward the fire whitson examin the mouth push back the upper
lip with a piec of stick he found that the shape of the mouth and the
develop of the teeth were the same as ghamba the other bodi
were ly on their face so he did not troubl to examin them
whitson then told langlei to follow him and the two walk down the
footpath toward where thei had left ghamba him thei found ly
motionless in the posit in which he had been left about an hour
previous thei remov the sack and the gag and unti hi feet first
take the precaut to fasten the belt by on end to hi bound hand

mirthless grin and the tusk were reveal from point to insert
langlei question ghamba but he would not speak after sever
attempt to forc him to answer had been vainli made whitson said
now tell him that if he speak and tell the whole truth he will onli
be shot but if he doe not speak he will be burn aliv
thi wa interpret but the threat had no appar effect so whitson
seiz ghamba and drag him to the fire where he flung him down on
the veri edg of the glow ember
now said whitson hold him down with hi foot so that he got
sever scorch for the last time will you speak
take me awai from the fire and i will speak said ghamba in english
so thei lift him and set him again with hi back to the rock
now said whitson go ahead and no nonsens
if i tell the whole truth said ghamba still speak english and
with a fair accent will you swear not to burn me but to shoot me so
that i shall die at onc
i will said whitson
you too must swear said ghamba look at langlei
ye i swear

rememb what you have sworn to
ye all right said whitson ghamba then look at langlei who
repeat the word
i will tell you said ghamba all i can rememb and you can ask
question which i shall answer truli you have heard of umdava who
us to eat men in natal long ago after the war of tshakawel he
wa my uncl after umdava had been kill and hi peopl scatter my
father with a few follow came to live among these mountain but we
found that after have eaten human flesh we could enjoi no other food
so we caught peopl and at them these two men ly dead ar my son
and that woman is my daughter my four wive were here tonight thei
ar veri old women have you not seen them he ask look at
whitson
thei ar in there i shot them said whitson point to the cave
i had other children continu ghamba quit unmov but we at
them when food wa scarc
have you alwai live all these year on human flesh ask whitson
no not alwai but whenev we could obtain it we did so there is
other food in these mountainshonei ant egg root and fruit
besid game which is howev not veri easi to catch but we have
often all had to go awai and work when time have been bad besid i
have a herd of cattl at a basuto kraal and i have been in the habit of
take some of these now and then and exchang them for corn which
the women then went to fetch but we have alwai tri to get peopl to
eat becaus we could enjoi no other kind of food sometim we got them
easili and when we were veri fortun we us to dry part of the meat
by hang it up and light a fire underneath with green wood so as
to make plenti of smoke
have you kill mani white peopl ask whitson
ye a good number but not of cours as mani as black late we
have alwai tri to catch white becaus when you have eaten white
flesh for some time the flesh of a nativ no longer satisfi you
why not
the flavour is not so strong
did you induc the other two policemen to come up by mean of the stori
about umhlonhlo
ye thei came up just as you did and my son caught them with the
thong umhlonhlo ha brought us plenti of food
were you abl to take the cartridg out of their revolv as you did
out of mine
no i had no opportun but it wa not necessari becaus my son
were so expert at throw the thong that thei could alwai catch
peopl over the arm and thu render them unabl to shoot
how did thei manag to becom so expert
by continu practic i us to walk up the path over and over again
and let them throw the thong over me then the woman wa alwai there
with the club so that if on of the thong miss she wa readi to
strike i also wa usual readi to help in case of necess
why did you think it necessari to take the cartridg out of my
revolv
becaus i fear you from the first and were it not that hebar
hi teeth and glanc at langlei who shudderedlook so nice and
that we want fresh meat so badli i would not have risk bring
you but it would have been all right if i had onli let your revolv

you sai umhlonhlo ha brought you plenti of food did you ever get ani
on besid ourselv and the other two policemen to come up here by
tell them that stori
ye two otherson a man who wa search for gold on the free state
side of the mountain and the other a trader whom i met at maseru but
these each came alon
i see the buckl of a woman belt in there whom did that belong to
you sure never got a white woman up here
ye we did said ghamba with a horribl halfsmil which bare the
gum high abov the socket of hi tusk she wa a young girl who had
strai from a waggon pass over the mountain by the ladysmith road
onli a dai walk from here i pretend to show her the shortest wai
to her waggon and thu brought her as far as she could walk in thi
direct i then kill her and came up here and fetch my son we
carri her up in the night she wa veri young and plump and i have
never eaten anyth that i enjoi so much whitson turn cold
with horror he rememb the girl mysteri disappear and the
fruitless search undertaken in consequ hi fleshglanc
again at langleylook someth like her did and i am sure it would
tast just as nice there wa still a littl of her left when i went
awai last week if you will go in there and look where the rock is split
on the righthand side you will but he did not finish the sentenc
for a bullet from whitson revolv crush through hi brain and he
tumbl forward on hi face into the fire
it wa onli after tremend difficulti that whitson and langlei
succeed in escap from the mountain howev on the even of the
third dai after their adventur in the cave thei came in sight of the
polic camp whitson sat down on a stone and motion hi companion to
do the same
see here sonni he said i want to have a short talk with you i am
a bit cross with you as the caus of my have been suck in by that
dd murder old walru you ought to know the inhabit of thi
countri better than a simpl stranger like me and so i took your lead
now anoth thing you nearli bust us both by your blast foolish
in go to sleep that dai but let that pass becaus perhap it would
have been wors if we had not been put on our guard not but that it
would take a dd smart cannib to eat hiram whitson but thi is what
i am come to you my boi ar a darn sight too fond of hear your
own tongu clack now take a warn from me and dont let a word
of what ha happen sinc we left camp for pietermaritzburg pass your

the etern god if you open your lip to a soul ill shoot you like
a dog or a cannib rememb that sonni and sai it quietli over
to yourself the first time you feel that you want to blab now shake

to a guitar accompani on by on the male resid of big stone
hole drew near to that ironroof hut and stop to listen but after
comment on the innov in gleeful whispersfor guitar had never
twang in that part of africa beforethei move on to their work no
consider could caus them to neglect that thei might fritter awai
the dull rough gem when thei had found them but the lust of handl
diamond onc wa the strongest passion thei knew and so the dai
toil wa not curtail but at the conclus miss musgrav had an
applic for instruct in music from everi man in the camp with
on except thi on default wa euchr buck he own to have
no ear for musictherebi exhibit more honesti than mani of the
othersand confess to know onli two tune on of which wa
hail columbia and the otherwasnt and so he said he want some
literari work done he propos to miss musgrav that she should write
a histori of hi life at half a guinea a page therebycut yanke that
he wasthink to appropri the whole of her time
but embarrass by all these call upon her and obvious unabl to
satisfi each of them miss musgrav turn for help to the scholar
whom she appear to regard as her special advis and he promis a
solut of the difficulti in half an hour drew off the whole crowd to
the american bar where the question wa thrash out in all it point
it wa clearli evid that miss musgrav could not surrend to each
individu the whole of her even even if ani on had been will to
let hi neighbor monopolis it which no on wa and therefor it
wa necessari to formul some scheme by which her talent might be
distribut over a larger area but what the scheme should be wa not
settl all in a minut on man want to hear her sing anoth to
hear her talk anoth wa will to give five pound an hour for the
privileg of talk to her after a lengthen discuss which wa
excit throughout and at time verg on the warlik it wa
decid to effect a compromisesubject of cours to miss musgrav
inclin and a deput wa sent to learn her view on the
subject
there wa no assemblyroom in the place except werstein
saloonwhich of cours wa not avail for such a purposeand so
it wa propos to her with much humil that she should take up her
posit in the even on a chair outsid her hut and there discours
such vocal and instrument music as she saw fit interlard the
same with friendli convers what wa she to talk about
anythingabsolut anyth thei didnt mind what it wa so long as
thei heard her voic five shill the committe had decid wa to
be paid by everi man who came within earshot and ani on who want a
free list wa request to argu the matter out with euchr buck
thi call upon her power seem to take miss musgrav aback
i have never sung in public she plead rather nervous inde
my voic is not good enough for it realli it isnt onli i thought
i could teach a littl perhap and that is why i came here you see
mother is an invalid and we were so veri poor that
miss broke in jockei bill call it ten bob a ead an just um to
us
oh no mr william it wa not the monei that i thought about inde
five shill would be far too much but if you think that i should be
abl to amus you at all i would do my veri bestbeliev me i would
miss growl dan with a clumsi endeavour to chase awai her
diffid all we ask is fer you to sit near us fer a spell ef you
sing or plai wed be proud ef you just look an talk wed be
pleas
so in the end miss musgrav yield to the wish of the commun and
the nightli conclav in the american bar becam so much a thing of the
past that gustav werstein wa heard to threaten anoth emigr the
song were to the digger new and yet not new there wa noth of the
musichal type about them thei were nearli all oldfashion ditti
she sang to them of barbara allen and salli in our allei she
gave them cheer boi cheer and call for a choru she sang the
messag the arrow and the song and she brought back memori of
other dai when africa wa to them a mere geograph expressionof
dai when that someth had not happen which had sent them awai from
home

usual sabbath of big stone hole sundai had been observ befor by
the biggest drink bout of the week and a summari settlement of the

and to the still greater surpris of themselv these diamonddigg
sang hymn at interv dure the dai and refrain from indulg in
the orthodox carous till after miss musgrav had retir for the night
it wa a wonder chang
dure the next week a fall of earth took place in tommi dartmoor
claim two kaffir were kill and when the proprietor himself wa
extric from the debri of blue clai which held him down he wa
found to have a broken arm besid other seriou injuri
dont let on to her he manag to gasp out to hi rescuer wish
to spare miss musgrav nerv a shock
but she saw the men bear him to hi hut join them and insist on
be instal as sole nurs forthwith
twenti other men would willingli have broken an arm for such a reward
and the reckless displai dure the next few dai wa someth
aw but she saw that toolittl escap those big blue eyesand
ascrib it to drink gave a pretti strong lectur on the bibul
habit of big stone hole at her next concert
there wa an earnest meet in the american bar that night at which
the follow motion wa put and carri unanim on and after thi
date ani drunken man is liabl to be shot at sight unless hi friend
can prove that he ha dug over three carat of diamond dure the dai
and then like other reform thei went on to more sweep measur
onli knifefight to take place in the camp all disput with
pistol unless of a veri press natur to be settl out of earshot
of dan hous there were even some hint of appoint a closingtim
for the saloonit would make the place so much more like home but
the promot eventu withdrew hi suggest as it wa justli felt
that such a motion would interfer with the liberti of the subject too
much but a storm of cheer burst forth when it wa propos to
transfer the diamondsaf from werstein keep to a corner of the new
goddesss shrine
even satan the cat join in the gener ador and more favour
than the rest enjoi at time a chast salut from miss musgrav
riper lip
never in so short a space of time had a commun been more chang
for the better than wa that of big stone hole never had woman
humanis influenc made itself more clearli felt the azur cloud
of blasphemi that hung over the work and the rest of the camp wa
replac again by the normal dust each man tri to beautifi the insid
of hi shanti to the best of hi mean and idea for there wa no
know when the onli she would take it into her pretti caprici
head to pai a call in thi latter line the scholar had a decid pull
educ had taught him tast necess handi and by aid of
the two he transform hi rude dwell into someth approach the
room in which he us to dawdl awai the happi hour time ago it wa
partli drawingroom partli curiosityshop cup saucer and spoon
appear as if by magician call and on blaze afternoon the new
flash round the diamondpit that miss musgrav wa take afternoon
tea with the scholar but when the scholar saw the dismai hi simpl
act had spread around him he dissip it with a kindli laugh and a
few reassur word

manner miss musgrav is noth to me nor am i anyth to her heaven
forbid im too hard a bargain for ani girl if ani on of you marri
her ill act as hi best man if he ask me to and wish him everi
felic without a thought of regret
bulli for the scholar yell the delight crowd and miss musgrav
smile were more sought after than ever
so thing went on dai after dai week after week till miss musgrav
becam littl short of an autocrat empress but still she show no
sign of take unto herself a consort she kept all men at a cousinli
distanc and those who felt intim enough to address her as miss

and prosper a settlement as need be
had these digger refresh their mind by look back for histor
parallel thei might have been prepar in some degre for miss
musgrav exit from among them but as none of them indulg in such
retrospect the manner of it took the camp somewhat by surpris
it wa first discov in thi wise work wa over for the dai the

of convers digger after digger arriv threw himself down and
join in the gener wonder as to why miss mari wasnt there and
at last some on hazard a suggest that she must be asleep there
wa a gener epidem of noisi cough for a full minut and then

dreamili for the sight of so much gaieti pleas him he wish on of
the women would come and talk to him he would have like to chat with
the fairhair girl who plai the first violin so well he began to
wonder why she prefer that ugli englishman with hi red face and bald

and look red and uncomfort then he saw she wa drink champagn
and he sigh ah ye these english were rich and women onli care

hardship for the sake of her husband he tri to excus himself by
argu that the music had excit him but he felt a littl asham
and as a sop to hi not yet quit murder conscienc got up and left

the busi he had intend he wa angri with himself now as well as
asham he wander up and down the squar look at the statu of
the great khediv silhouet against the moonlight and curs at hi

why should he gregorio livada be in need of monei he had work
hard but without success he could have born hi ill luck had he alon
been the suffer but he must consid hi childand of cours hi
wife too he wa realli fond of hi wife in a wai but he smile proudli
as he thought of hi son for whom he scheme out a great futur he and
xantipp would train the boi so carefulli that he would grow up to be
a great man and what wa more a rich man how thei would laugh

few competitor then he would make a fortun as other greek had done
and amo would be paid in full he wa not extravag no he had the
busi instinct of hi race half these rich merchant of alexandria
had begun as he would begin he would succe as thei had succeed the
futur wa realli hope if he could onli borrow a littl capit
with these thought surg through hi brain gregorio pace up and down
the pavement at last he turn into the rue de soeur and start
slowli toward hi home
thi street the sink of alexandria wa at it gayest the cafe where
cheap liquor is sold were crowd soldier and sailor nativ and the
riffraff of half a dozen nation jostl on anoth the twang of
guitar and the tinkl of piano wa heard from everi hous women
undercloth and overpaint lean from the upper window and made
frequent salli into the street to captur their prei loud voic sang
lusti english chorus and french chansonnett and neapolitan song
tri to assert themselv whenev the uproar ceas for a moment
everi on talk hi or her own tongu and gestur fill in the gap
when word were want all seem determin to degrad themselv as
much as possibl and nearli everi on seem suprem happi
occasion there wa a fight and knive were us with uner
skill but the mount polic who patrol the street though
overtax manag to preserv a certain amount of order
gregorio took veri littl notic of the scene through which he pass
he knew everi inch and corner of the quarter that had been hi home for
year and wa familiar with most of it inhabit he sigh a littl
as he thought of the monei be lost and won in the stuffi illlight
room at the back of the hous shut out from view of the author
like most of hi race he wa fond of the excit of gambl but
of what us were regret and sigh he had no monei and must need go
home it wa vain to try and borrow or to ask credit for hi loss in
these gambl hell what is lost must be immedi paid for temper
ar inflam by drink and knive ar worn at each player belt
but he sigh none the less at the hard necess that compel him
to pass down the street without onc enter the door of a tavern it
wa veri hot and he had smoke mani cigarett he would have been glad
to call for a drink the tavernkeep though thei were hi friend
expect to be paid on or two women beckon to him who would have
willingli offer him wine but he wa proud enough to ignor them
he becam more moodi and deject as he went along silent and sober
amid so much revelri when he reach hi hous he saw a drunken man
ly on the threshold asleep he stoop to look into hi face and
recognis an englishman the foreman of some tramp in the harbour he
kick the recumb form testili as he strode over it
these english what beast thei ar he growl and ii have not a
piastr for a singl glass of wine
iiconcern a debt
gregorio found on enter hi hous that hi wife wa alreadi in bed
he went into the tini kitchen and saw a plate of macaroni readi for
hi supper he tri to eat some but it stuck in hi throat he took a
bottl of cheap cretan wine from a shelf and drank from it but the wine
wa sour and he spat it from hi mouth with a curs
take up the lamp he went into the bedroom hi wife wa fast
asleep with the boi in her arm for a moment a smile flicker round
gregorio mouth as he look at them then he took off hi boot and
hi coat blew out the lamp and lai besid them he wa veri tire
after hi long tramp in the hot street but he could not sleep angrili
he toss from side to side and close hi ey tightli but it wa no
good sleep would not come
at midnight he heard a call to prayer chant from the minaret of a tini
mosqu in the neighbourhood the muezzin voic irrit him he
did not wish to prai and he did want to sleep he swore that it wa
insan for these fool of mohammedan to declar that prayer wa
better than sleep
then the thought that had agit him dure the walk return to him
the rue de soeur wa still noisi with merrymak and it seem to
him that if he could onli join them he would be happi but he had no
monei and on can do noth without monei
then there came back to him the face of the englishman he had seen
talk to the violinist of the paradiso he hate the man becaus he
wa ugli and rich these english were all rich and yet thei seem to
him a miser race mere ignor bulli he rememb how often he
had come to the help of the english travel who fill egypt why had
he he ask himself for the sake of a miser reward prevent them
be cheat when he with all hi talent wa condemn to starv
even hi child he thought would grow to hate him if he remain poor
he must get monei amo would have to lend him some the jew were
unpopular among the greek it were wise to keep on good term with
them as amo would find out
at last he fell asleep
in the morn hi troubl began again there wa no coffe and onli a
littl arab bread and when that wa done thei must starv if thei could
not get some monei gregorio tore off a bit of bread and at it slowli
look at hi wife who sat weep besid him

not so much at the purport of the jew speech as at the man who made
it he loath the jew and felt insult when spoken to by on it wa
a terribl matter to ask thi man for help but it wa intoler that
hi wife should suffer insult and yet the child must be fed ye she
had said that and it wa true thei must make sacrific for the child
he soon reach the jew hous and wa shown by a richli clad servant
into the room where amo sat amo wa an old man tall and strong with
a long bushi beard in which hi finger continu plai and hi

truli he thought these christian hate us but we have them in our
power it is pleasant to be hate and yet to know that it is to us thei
must cring when thei ar in need and it is veri pleasant to refus my
friend gregorio is not happi now that he is struggl in my grasp
as for gregorio he wander awai toward the harbour kick savag
at the refus scatter along the pavement he did not know how to set
about earn the requisit sum it wa no good appli to the hotel

it is imposs to sleep when on is hungri said gregorio that night
to hi wife who lai awak weep besid him

gregorio dream when he did sleep were none of the pleasantest
and when he woke up from time to time he heard hi wife weep in
wonder what he should sai to comfort her he fell asleep again and
sleep wa wors than ly awak for in hi dream he saw xantipp
and hi child starv and cry for food and he wa unabl to help
them in ani wai he live over again the long dai he had spent tramp

still left in the town fat and happi he saw the porter of the hotel
who had smile on him pityingli and yet contemptu and he woke
after each represent of the crude comedi hot and yet cold with
perspir to feel the bed on which he lai shake under the sob of
hi wife
when at last dai dawn gregorio rais himself with an oath and swore
to find food for hi famili and work for himself the terribl debt he
ow to amo he swore should not troubl him laugh at hi wife
remonstr with the bright daylight had come a new courag and
hungri as he wa he felt abl not onli to satisfi their hunger but so
skilfulli to arrang matter that thei would never feel hungri again
yet is wa a terribl ordeal that halfhour when the famili should have
sat down to a tabl laden with food the poor wife cri and he had
to comfort her tear with promis unsubstanti nutriment inde
and thei could not satisfi the child who fail dismal to understand
them through the green blind came the nois of life and health and
merriment curs too sometim but onli the curs of the well fed
and therefor meaningless alreadi the sun fell hot and indomit on
the room and the atmospher at their touch becam stifl gregorio
swallow hi tear tore out into the street shout up the narrow
stairwai hyster word of hope
how long and shadowless the street seem everi hous had it green
blind close shut the wind that stir the dust of the pavement wa
hot and bite gregorio clinch hi hand and strode rapidli onward
what matter it to him that behind those green blind women and men
slumber in compar comfort he had a work to do and by sunset
must carri good tide to hi littl world for a time hi heart wa
brave as the dry wind scorch the tear upon hi cheek sure he
thought weav hi thought into a fine march rhythm the great
god will help me now will help me now
at middai after he had tri with that strang greek pertinac that
understand no refus all the hotel and tourist agenc he had
call at the dai befor he becam weari and disconsol the march
had becom a dirg no longer it suggest happi to be but failur
an englishman threw him a piastr and he turn into a cafe call
for a glass of wine he flung himself down on the wooden bench and tri
to think but realli logic think wa imposs for in spite of
the sorrow at hi heart the same bright dream of wealth and happi
came back to mock him the piastr he plai with becam gold and he
felt the cafe contain no luxuri that he might not command to be
brought befor him but as the effect of the red wine of lebanon
evapor he began to take a sober though still cheer view of hi
posit it wa onli when the waiter carri off hi piastr that he
suddenli woke to fact and knew himself onc more a man with a wife and
child starv in alexandria an alien citi for all it wealthi coloni
of greek a wave of piti swept over him not so much for the woman wa
he sorri though he love her too but for the babi whose futur he had
plan he scowl savag at the inmat of the cafe who onli smile
quietli for thei were us to poor greek who had drunk awai their last
coin and push past them into the street
there it wa hotter than ever and he met scarc ani on everi
on who could be wa at home or in the cool cafe onli gregorio wa
abroad he determin to make for the quai he knew that mani ship put
into the alexandrian water and there wa often employ found
for those not too proud to work at lade and unload quickli and
burn as the kempsin he hurri through the rue de soeur not
dare to look up at the hous wherein he dwelt the muffl sound
of voic and guitar from the farawai interior seem to mock hi
footstep as he pass the wineshop and all the other hous were
silent and asleep at last he arriv on the quai and the black line
of the p and o stood out firmli befor him against the pitiless blue
of sea and sky he wander over the hot stone causewai but found no
on the revenu offic were awai and not a labour not a sailor
wa visibl beyond the breakwat littl tuft of silveri foam flash
on the roller and a solitari steamer steer steadili for the horizon
he could see the greek flag at her stern and hi ey fill with
tear ah how littl hi friend in athen thought of the man who had
come to find fame and fortun in the faroff east he sat down on the
parapet and watch the vessel until she becam a tini speck on the
horizon and then he recommenc hi search for work hi heart wa
braver for a moment becaus of it pang he swore he would show these
countrymen of hi who dwelt at home and who in three dai would see the
veri ship he had been gaze at arriv in grecian water that he wa
worthi of hi countri and hi kinsfolk
but resolut were useless tenac of purpos wa useless for two
long hour he wander by the harbour but met no on
at last the sun fell behind the western wave and the window of the
khediv palac glow like a hundr flame ey the flag fell from
the mast of the vessel on the citi side wa a sudden silenc save
for the melancholi voic of the muezzin then the dai di the bright
star suddenli pierc the heaven mock him with their brillianc
and told him that hi useless search for bread wa over
gregorio went back slowli to hi home alreadi the rue de soeur wa
crowd the long street rang with music and laughter and instead
of blind cover the window merri women lean upon the sill and
laugh at the crowd below
gregorio when he reach hi hous would have like to go straight to
bed but it wa not to be for as he enter the tini room he heard hi
wife try to persuad the hungri infant into sleep and hi footstep
disturb her tear he had to calm them as best he could and as he
sooth her he notic the child had a crust in hi hand which he gnaw
half contentedli at the same moment the dim blue figur of an arab
pass by the opposit wall and had almost gain the door er gregorio
found word
who ar you
it is ahm hi wife answer gentli place her trembl hand
upon hi shoulder he too ha children
gregorio scowl and mutter an arab and in that murmur none of the
loath wa hidden that the pseudowest bear for the east
the child is starv said ahm i have save the child mayb some
dai i shall save the father and ahm slip awai befor gregorio
could answer him
for a while neither he nor hi wife spoke thei stood silent in the
moonlight at last gregorio ask huskili have you had food
not todai wa the answer and the sweet voic wa almost discord
in it patho as it continu nor drink and but for ahm the boi had
di
gregorio could not answer there wa a lump in hi throat that block
word open the gate for sob but he choke down hi emot with
an effort and busi himself about the room xantipp sat watch him
anxious smoothli with nervou finger the cover of her son bed
as the night advanc the heat increas and all that disturb the
silenc of the room wa the echo of the street gregorio walk to the
window and look out below him he saw the jostl crowd of men and
women these peopl he thought were happi and two miser onli
dwelt in the cityhi wife and himself and whenev he ask himself
what wa the caus of hi miseri the answer wa ever the samepoverti
he glanc at hi son toss uneasili in hi bed he look at
hi wife pale and haggard in the moonlight he rememb hi
own suffer all dai long in the hot cruel street and he spoke
unsteadili
xantipp

then as though the word had grown to have a mean to her that she
could not fathom she queri what wai gregorio
that he said roughli as he caught her by the wrist and drag
her to the window point to the women in the street beneath
xantipp hid her face on her husband breast and cri softli while
she murmur no no i will never consent
then the child will die answer the greek curtli fling her from
him
and the poor woman cast herself upon the bed besid her boi and when
her tear ceas for a moment stammer when
tomorrow wa the answer cruel and peremptori and as gregorio
close the lattic shut out the nois of song and laughter the
room echo with the mighti sob of a woman who wa betrai and who
repeat hyster while kiss the face of her child tomorrow
tomorrow there will be food for you
and gregorio slept peacefulli for the danger of starvat wa over he
would yet live to see hi son becom rich
and the woman
he kiss her befor he slept and women alwai cry
ivconcern two women
gregorio felt a littl bit asham of himself next morn the
excit had pass and the full mean of hi word came back to
him and made him shudder the sun alreadi risen sent shaft of light
between the lip of the wooden lattic a faint sound of life and
movement stole upward from the street below but xantipp and the boi
still slumber though the woman form shook convuls at time
for she sob in her sleep
gregorio look at the two for a minut and then rais himself with

xantipp ceas speak and take her son in her arm close her
ey and fell asleep quietli a gentl smile hover round her lip
gregorio scowl at her savag and would have like to strike her
to beat out hi passion on her white breast and shoulder but she had
spoken onli the truth when she said he dare not touch her with impot
oath he sought to let off the anger that boil in him he fear
to think and everi word she had utter made him think in spite of
himself the event of sixti hour had destroi what littl of good
there wa in the man save onli the idolatr love for hi child he

sun wa risen
while eat hi breakfast he inquir cunningli concern thi wise
teacher of the gospel of love and hate but xantipp for a time did not
answer

paus befor he put the next question he could scarc explain why

englishman he wa readi enough to sacrific hi wife if by so do
monei might be gain but he felt somehow hurt in hi vaniti at the
idea of thi ugli slowwit northern usurp hi place with an
effort howev he put the question
is he an englishman

he wa seiz with a tumult of anger he spoke volubl talk of the
ignor of the english their brutal their dull brain their
stupid pride xantipp wait till he had finish speak and then
repli quietli

toward the even of a dai a fortnight later gregorio found himself
seat in madam marx cafe idli watch the passersbi he wa
feel happier for that wa be amass which alon could insur
happi to him each dai some golden piec were ad to the amount
save and the cafe at benhur seem almost within hi grasp the
feel of secur from want act as a narcot and sooth him so
that the thing which should have troubl him scarc interest him
at all he wa intox with the sight of gold when he had first
seen xantipp and the englishman togeth hi anger had been violent
but when at last the futil of hi rage becam certain hi aggress
passion had soften to a smoulder discont that hardli worri
him unless he heard some on speak a british name hi prosper had
destroi the last vestig of shame and sooth hi illog outburst
of furi he wa content enough now to sit all dai with madam marx
and return to hi home in the even when xantipp wa awai he had
spoken to her onli onc sinc she had told him she hate him he had
stroll out of the cafe about middai and enter hi room xantipp wa
there talk to her child and quietli bade him go awai
it my room as well as your gregorio had answer
it is my monei that pai for it wa the repli
a long convers follow but xantipp met the man coars anger
with quiet scorn and told him that if he stai she would grow to
dislik her son sinc he wa the father
gregorio wa wise enough to control hi anger then for he knew that if
she were realli to lose her love for the boi all hi chanc and the
boi chanc of eas and prosper would be destroi it wa of
cours ridicul to imagin she would suppli him with monei then
that she thoroughli loath him and would alwai loath him wa veri
certain so great inde seem her contempt for him that it wa quit
possibl she might come to hate hi child so he did not attempt to
remain in the room but as he close the door after him he wait a
moment and listen he heard her heav a sigh of relief and then sai
to the littl fellow how like your father you grow my god i almost
think i hate you for be so like him gregorio shudder as he ran
noiselessli downstair he never ventur to speak to her again he
argu himself out of the disquiet into which her word had thrown him
he knew it wa difficult for a woman to hate her child the birthpain
cement a love it requir a harsh wrench to sever he easili persuad
himself as he sip madam marx coffe that if he kept in the
background all caus for hatr would be remov as for her feel
toward himself he had ceas almost to care the monei wa worth the
cost paid in the attain of it and a woman laugh wa less sweet to
him than the chink of gold and silver piec on the whole gregorio
had littl reason to be troubl onli unreason dislik for
the englishmanwhi could not he be of ani other nation or if an
englishman ani other englishmanhurt hi peac of mind and for the
most part hi discont onli smoulder
madam marx brought her coffe and sat besid him her face betoken
satisfact and she look at gregorio with a possess smile she
had gain her desir and ask fortun for no other gift
you have not seen xantipp sinc she turn you out ah well it
is much better you should keep awai you ar welcom here and it is
foolish to go where on is not want
iv not seen her im afraid to see her he spoke openli to madam
now
some women ar queer if she had ever realli love you she would not
have thrown you over i should not have complain had i been in her
place on cannot alwai choos on lot

that thi englishman saw her there ar not men so rich as the english
and he is a rich englishman you ar lucki
i hate him
becaus he ha stolen your wife love madam marx as she put
the question laid her fat hand upon gregorio shoulder and laugh
confid the movement irrit him but he never tri to resist
her now
no not quit that im us to it and the monei more than compens
me but i hate the man when i first saw him in the paradis there
wa a fiddlerwoman he talk to and he could scarc make himself
understood he had monei and he gave her champagn and flower and i
wa starv and the woman wa beauti
madam tap hi cheek and smile
the woman cant interest you now also you have moneyhi monei

you greek ar like children your hatr is unreason there is no
caus for it
unreason and not to be reason awai
