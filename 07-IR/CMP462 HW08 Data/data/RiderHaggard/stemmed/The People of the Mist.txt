on sever previou occas it ha happen to thi writer of romanc
to be justifi of hi romanc by fact of startl similar

an instanc of the sort a doublebarrel instanc inde that to
him seem suffici curiou to be worthi of tell the peopl of

make sacrific but in the origin draft of the book thi crocodil wa
a snakemonstrum horrendum inform ingen a friend of the writer

the peopl of the mist
chapter i
the sin of the father ar visit on the children
the januari afternoon wa pass into night the air wa cold and
still so still that not a singl twig of the nake beechtre stir
on the grass of the meadow lai a thin white rime half frost half
snow the fir stood out blackli against a steelhu sky and over the
tallest of them hung a singl star past these border fir there ran
a road on which in thi even of the open of our stori a young
man stood irresolut glanc now to the right and now to the left
to hi right were two state gate of iron fantast wrought
support by stone pillar on whose summit stood griffin of black
marbl embrac coat of arm and banner inscrib with the devic
per ardua ad astra beyond these gate ran a broad carriag drive
line on either side by a doubl row of such oak as england alon can
produc under the most favour circumst of soil aid by the
nurtur hand of man and three or four centuri of time
at the head of thi avenu perhap half a mile from the roadwai
although it look nearer becaus of the emin upon which it wa
place stood a mansion of the class that in auction advertis
is usual describ as nobl it gener appear wa elizabethan
for in those dai some forgotten outram had practic rebuilt it but
a larg part of it fabric wa far more ancient than the tudor
date back so said tradit to the time of king john as we ar
not auction howev it will be unnecessari to specifi it mani
beauti inde at thi date some of the tribe had recent emploi
their gift of languag on these attract with copiou ful and
accuraci of detail sinc outram hall for the first time dure six
centuri wa or had been for sale
suffic it to sai that like the oak of it avenu outram wa such
a hous as can onli be found in england no mere mass of brick
and mortar but a thing that seem to have acquir a life and
individu of it own or if thi sai be too farfetch and
poetic at the least thi vener home bore some stamp and trace
of the live and individu of mani gener of mankind link
togeth in thought and feel by the common bond of blood
the young man who stood in the roadwai look long and earnestli toward
the mass of build that frown upon him from the crest of the hill
and as he look an express came into hi face which fell littl if
at all short of that of agoni the agoni which the young can feel at
the shock of an utter and irredeem loss the face that wore such
evid of troubl wa a handsom on enough though just now all the
charm of youth seem to have fade from it it wa dark and strong nor
wa it difficult to guess that in afterlif it might becom stern the
form also wa shape and athlet though not veri tall give promis
of more than common strength and the bear that of a gentleman who
had not brought himself up to the belief that ancient blood can cover
modern defici of mind and manner such wa the outward appear
of leonard outram as he wa then in hi twentythird year
while leonard watch and hesit on the roadwai unabl appar
to make up hi mind to pass those iron gate and yet desir of do
so cart and carriag began to appear hurri down the avenu toward
him
i suppos that the sale is over he mutter to himself well like
death it is a good thing to have done with
then he turn to go but hear the crunch of wheel close at hand
step back into the shadow of the gatewai pillar fear lest he
should be recognis on the open road a carriag came up and just as
it reach the gate someth be amiss with the har a footman
descend from the box to set it right from where he stood leonard
could see it occup the wife and daughter of a neighbour squir
and overhear their convers he knew them well inde the younger
ladi had been on of hi favourit partner at the counti ball
how cheap the thing went ida fanci bui that old oak sideboard for
ten pound and with all those outram quarter on it too it is as
good as an histor document and i am sure that it must be worth at
least fifti i shall sell our and put it into the diningroom i have
covet that sideboard for year
the daughter sigh and answer with some asper
i am so sorri for the outram that i should not care about the
sideboard if you had got it for twopenc what an aw smash just
think of the old place be bought by a jew tom and leonard ar
utterli ruin thei sai not a sixpenc left i declar i nearli cri
when i saw that man sell leonard gun
veri sad inde answer the mother absent but if he is a jew
what doe it matter he ha a titl and thei sai that he is enorm
rich i expect there will be plenti go on at outram soon by the wai
my dear ida i do wish you would cure yourself of the habit of call
young men by their christian namesnot that it matter about these two
for we shall never see ani more of them
i am sure i hope that we shall said ida defiantli and when we do
i shall call them by their christian name as much as ever you never
object to it befor the smash and i love both of them so there
why did you bring me to that horrid sale you know i did not want to go
i shall be wretch for a week i and the carriag swept on out of
hear
leonard emerg from the shadow of the gatewai and cross the road
swiftli on the further side of it he paus and look after the
retreat carriag said aloud god bless you for your kind heart ida
hatherlei good luck go with you and now for the other busi
a hundr yard or so down the road wa a second gate of much less
impos appear than those which led to the outram hall leonard
pass through it and present found himself at the door of a squar
red brick hous built with no other pretens than to those of
comfort thi wa the rectori now tenant by the reverend and
honour jame beach to whom the live had been present mani year
befor by leonard father mr beach old colleg friend
leonard rang the bell and as it distant clamour fell upon hi ear a
new fear struck him what sort of recept would he meet with in thi
hous he wonder hitherto hi welcom had alwai been so cordial that
until thi moment he had never doubt of it but now circumst were
chang he wa no longer in the posit of second son to sir thoma
outram of outram hall he wa a beggar an outcast a wander the son
of a fraudul bankrupt and suicid the careless word of the woman
in the carriag had let a flood of light into hi mind and by it he saw
mani thing which he had never seen befor now he rememb a littl
motto that he had often heard but the full forc of which he did not
appreci until todai friend follow fortun wa the word of
thi motto he rememb also anoth sai that had frequent been
read to him in church and elsewher and the origin of which preclud
all doubt as to it truth
unto everi on that hath shall be given but from him that hath not
shall be taken awai even that which he hath
now as it chanc leonard beggar as he wa had still someth
left which could be taken awai from him and that someth the richest
fortun which provid can give to ani man in hi youth the love of
a woman whom he also love the reverend and honour jame beach
wa bless with a daughter jane by name who had the reput not
undeserv of be the most beauti and sweetestnatur girl that
the countrysid could show now be dark and fair respect and
have live in close associ sinc childhood leonard and jane as
might be expect from the work of the law of natur economi had
gravit toward each other with increas speed ever sinc thei had
come to understand the possibl of the institut of marriag
in the end thu mutual gravit led to a shock and confus of
individu which wa not without it charm or to put the matter
more plainli leonard propos to jane and had been accept with mani
blush and some tear and kiss
it wa a common littl romanc enough but like everyth els with
which youth and love ar concern it had it element of beauti such
affair gain much from be the first in the seri who is there among
us that doe not ador hi first love and hi first poem and yet when
we see them twenti year after
present the rectori door wa open and leonard enter at thi
moment it occur to him that he did not quit know why he had come to
be altogeth accur he knew why he had come well enough it wa to
see jane and arriv at an understand with her father perhap it
mai be well to explain that hi engag to that young ladi wa of the
suppress order her parent had no wish to suppress it inde for
though leonard wa a younger son it wa well known that he wa destin
to inherit hi mother fortun of fifti thousand pound more or less
besid provid had decre a delic constitut to hi elder and
onli brother thoma but sir thoma outram their father wa reput
to be an ambiti man who look to see hi son marri well and thi
marriag would scarc have been to leonard advantag from the famili
lawyer point of view
therefor when the matter came to the ear of jane parent thei
determin to forego the outward express of their pride and delight
in the captiv whom thei ow to the bow and spear of their daughter
loveli at ani rate for a while sai until leonard had taken hi
degre often and often in the afteryear did thei have occas to
bless themselv for their caution but not the less on thi account wa
leonard posit as the affianc lover of their daughter recognis
among them inde the matter wa no secret from anybodi except
perhap from sir thoma himself for hi part leonard took no pain
to conceal it even from him but the father and son met rare and the
estrang between them wa so complet that the younger man saw no
advantag in speak of a matter thu near to hi heart until there
appear to be a practic object in so do
the rev jame beach wa a stout person of bland and prepossess
appear never had he look stouter more prepossess or blander
than on thi particular even when leonard wa usher into hi
presenc he wa stand befor the fire in hi drawingroom hold a
huge and ancient silver lovingcup in both hand and in such a posit
as to give the observ the idea that he had just drain it entir
content in realiti it mai be explain he wa emploi in search
for a hallmark on the bottom of the goblet discours the while
to hi wife and childrenfor jane had a brotherupon it valu and
beauti the gleam of the silver caught leonard ey as he enter
the room and he recognis the cup as on of the heirloom of hi own
famili
leonard sudden and unlookedfor advent brought variou emot into
activ plai there were four peopl gather round that comfort
fireth rector hi wife hi son and last but not least jane
herself mr beach drop the cup suffici to allow himself to
stare at hi visitor along it length for all the world as though he
were cover him with a silver blunderbuss hi wife an activ littl
woman turn round as if she move upon wire exclaim good
graciou whod have thought it while the son a robust young man
of about leonard own ag and hi colleg companion said hullo old
fellow well i never expect to see you here todaya remark
which howev natur it mai have been scarc tend to set hi
friend at eas
jane herself a tall and beauti girl with bright auburn hair who wa
seat on a footstool nurs her knee befor the fire and pai
veri littl heed to her father lectur upon ancient plate did none of
these thing on the contrari she sprang up with the utmost anim
her lip apart and her love face red with blush or the heat of the
fire and came toward him exclaim oh leonard dear leonard
mr beach turn the silver blunderbuss upon hi daughter and fire a
singl but most effect shot
jane he said in a voic in which fatherli admonit and friendli
warn were happili blend
jane stop in full career wa though in obedi to some lesson which
momentarili she had forgotten then mr beach set down the flagon
advanc upon leonard with an ampl piti smile and outstretch hand
how ar you my dear boi how ar you he said we did not expect
to see me here under the circumst put in leonard bitterli nor
would you have done so but tom and i understood that it wa onli to be
a three dai sale

but the auction found that he could not get through in the time the
accumul of such an ancient hous as outram hall ar necessarili
vast and he wave hi hand with a larg gestur
ye said leonard
hum went on mr beach after a paus which wa begin to grow
awkward doubtless you will find it a matter for congratul that on
the whole thing sold well it is not alwai the case not by ani
mean for such collect as those of outram howev interest and
valuabl thei mai have been to the famili itself do not often fetch
their worth at a countri auction ye thei sold decidedli well thank
chiefli to the larg purchas of the new owner of the estat thi
tankard for instanc which i have boughthema a slight memento of
your famili cost me ten shill an ounc
inde answer leonard coldli i alwai understood that it wa
worth fifti
then came anoth paus dure which all who were present except mr
beach and himself rose on by on and quit the room jane wa the
last to go and leonard notic as she pass him that there were
tear in her ey
jane said her father in a mean voic when her hand wa alreadi on
the door you will be care to be dress in time for dinner will

like somebodi to be down to receiv him
jane onli answer to thi remark wa to pass through the door and slam
it behind her clearli the prospect of the advent of thi guest wa not
agreeabl to her

the rev jame beach who ow nearli everyth he had in the world to
hi kind to allud to them but he could not defend hi father
memori it wa beyond defenc and just now he must fight for hi own
hand

fault of our own our old home is sold our fortun have gone utterli
and our honour name is tarnish at the present moment i have
noth left in the world except the sum of two hundr pound which
i had save for a purpos of my own out of my allow i have no

me and know that in order to win her i must first put myself in a
posit to support her as she should be support i am quit convinc
that i shall be abl to surmount all difficulti by my own effort

cours ani understand that mai have exist between you and jane is
quit at an end engag i heard of no engag i knew that there
wa some boi and girl folli between you inde but for my part i never
gave the matter anoth thought

and leonard turn and left the room and the rectori
chapter ii
the swear of the oath
arthur beach jane brother wa stand in the hall wait to speak
to leonard but he pass without a word close the hall door behind
him outsid snow wa fall though not fast enough to obscur the
light of the moon which shone through the belt of fir
leonard walk on down the drive till he near the gate when suddenli
he heard the muffl sound of feet pursu him through the snow he
turn with an exclam believ that the footstep were those
of arthur beach for at the moment he wa in no mood for further
convers with ani male member of that famili as it chanc
howev he found himself face to face not with arthur but with jane
herself who perhap had never look more beauti than she did at
thi moment in the snow and the moonlight inde whenev leonard
thought of her in afteryear and that wa often there aros in
hi mind a vision of a tall and love girl her auburn hair slightli
powder over with the fall flake her breast heav with emot
and her wide grei ey gaze piteous upon him
oh leonard she said nervous why do you go without sai
goodby to me
he look at her awhil befor he answer for someth in hi heart
told him that thi wa the last sight which he should win of hi love
for mani a year and therefor hi ey dwelt upon her as we gaze upon
on whom the grave is about to hide from us for ever
at last he spoke and hi word were practic enough
you should not have come out in those thin shoe through the snow
jane you will catch cold
i wish i could she answer defiantli i wish that i could catch
such a cold as would kill me then i should be out of my troubl let
us go into the summerhous thei will never think of look for me
there
how will you get there ask leonard it is a hundr yard awai
and the snow alwai drift in that path
oh never mind the snow she said
but leonard did mind it and present he hit upon a solut of the
difficulti have first glanc up the drive to see that nobodi wa
come he bent forward and without explan or excus put hi arm
around jane and lift her as though she were a child he bore her
down the path which led to the summerhous she wa heavi but sooth
to sai he could have wish the journei longer present thei were
there and veri gentli he laid her on her feet again kiss her upon
the lip as he did so then he took off hi overcoat and wrap it
round her shoulder
all thi while jane had not spoken inde the poor girl felt so happi
and so safe in her lover arm that it seem to her as though she
never wish to speak or to do anyth for herself again it wa
leonard who broke the silenc
you ask me why i left without sai goodby to you jane it wa
becaus your father ha dismiss me from the hous and forbidden me to
have ani more to do with you
oh why ask the girl lift her hand despairingli
cant you guess he answer with a bitter laugh
ye leonard she whisper take hi hand in sympathi
perhap i had better put it plainli said leonard again it mai
prevent misunderstand your father ha dismiss me becaus my
father embezzl all my monei the sin of the father ar visit
upon the children you see also he ha done thi with more than usual
distinct and alacr becaus he wish you to marri young mr
cohen the bullionbrok and the futur owner of outram
jane shiver
i know i know she said and oh leonard i hate him
then perhap it will be as well not to marri him he answer
i would rather die first she said with convict
unfortun on cant alwai die when it happen to be conveni
jane
oh leonard dont be horrid she said begin to cry where ar

to the bad probabl he answer at least it all depend upon you
look here jane if you will stick to me i will stick to you the luck
is against me now but i have it in me to see that through i love you
and i would work myself to death for you but at the best it must be a
question of time probabl of year
oh leonard inde i will if i can i am sure that you do not love
me more than i love you but i can never make you understand how odiou
thei all ar to me about you especi papa
confound him said leonard beneath hi breath and if jane heard at
that moment her filial affect were not suffici strong to induc
her to remonstr
well jane he went on the matter li thu either you must put
up with their treatment or you must give me the gobi listen in six
month you will be twentyon and in thi countri all her relat put
togeth cant forc a woman to marri a man if she doe not wish to or
prevent her from marri on whom she doe wish to marri now you know
my address at my club in town letter sent there will alwai reach me

you from write and post a letter if you want my help or to
commun in ani wai i shall expect to hear from you and if need be
i will take you awai and marri you the moment you come of ag if on
the other hand i do not hear from you i shall know that it is becaus
you do not choos to write or becaus that which you have to write
would be too pain for me to read do you understand jane
oh ye leonard but you put thing so hardli
thing have been put hardli enough to me love and i must be
plainthi is my last chanc of speak to you
at thi moment an omin sound echo through the night it wa none
other than the distant voic of mr beach call from hi frontdoor
step jane ar you out there jane
oh heaven she said there is my father call me i came out
by the back door but mother must have been up to my room and found me
gone she watch me all dai now what shall i do
go back and tell them that you have been sai goodby to me it is
not a crime thei cannot kill you for it
inde thei can or just as bad repli jane then suddenli she threw
her arm about her lover neck and buri her beauti face upon
hi breast she began to sob bitterli murmur oh my darl my
darl what shall i do without you
over the brief and distress scene which follow it mai be well to
drop a veil leonard bitter of mind forsook him now and he kiss
her and comfort her as he might best even go so far as to mingl
hi tear with her tear of which he had no caus to be asham at
length she tore herself loos for the shout were grow louder and
more insist
i forgot she sob here is a farewel present for you keep it
in memori of me leonard and thrust her hand into the bosom of her
dress she drew from it a littl packet which she gave to him
then onc more thei kiss and clung togeth and in anoth moment she
had vanish back into the snow and dark pass out of leonard
sight and out of hi life though from hi mind she could never pass
a farewel present keep it in memori of me the word yet echo in
hi ear and to leonard thei seem fatefula propheci of utter loss
sigh heavili he open the packet and examin it content by the
feebl moonlight thei were not larg a prayerbook bound in morocco
her own with her name on the flyleaf and a short inscript beneath
and in the pocket of it cover a lock of auburn hair ti round with
silk
an unlucki gift said leonard to himself then put on hi coat
which wa yet warm from jane shoulder he also turn and vanish
into the snow and the night shape hi path toward the villag inn
he reach it in due cours and pass into the littl parlour that
adjoin the bar it wa a comfort room enough notwithstand it
adorn of badli stuf bird and fish and chiefli remark for
it wide oldfashion fireplac with wroughtiron dog there wa no
lamp in the room when leonard enter but the light of the burn wood
wa bright and by it he could see hi brother seat in a highback
chair gaze into the fire hi hand rest on hi knee
thoma outram wa leonard elder by two year and cast in a more
fragil mould hi face wa the face of a dreamer the brown ey were
larg and reflect and the mouth sensit as a child he wa a
scholar and a philosoph a man of much desultori read with refin
tast and a realli intim knowledg of greek gem
is that you leonard he said look up absent where have you
been
to the rectori answer hi brother
what have you been do there
do you want to know
ye of cours did you see jane
then leonard told him all the stori
what do you think she will do ask tom when hi brother had
finish given the situat and the woman it is rather a curiou
problem
it mai be answer leonard but as i am not an equat in algebra
yearn to be work out i dont quit see the fun of it but if you
ask me what i think she will do i should sai that she will follow the
exampl of everybodi els and desert me
you seem to have a poor idea of women old fellow i know littl of
them myself and dont want to know more but i have alwai understood
that it is the peculiar glori of their sex to come out strong on these
except occas woman in our hour of eas etc
well we shall see but it is my opinion that women think a great deal
more of their own hour of eas than of those of anybodi els thank
heaven here come our dinner
thu spoke leonard somewhat cynic and perhap not in the best of
tast but hi rejoic over it appear notwithstand he did
not do much justic to the dinner when it arriv inde it would be
charit to make allow for thi young man at that period of hi
life he had sustain a most terribl revers and do what he might he
could never quit escap from the shadow of hi father disgrac
or put out of hi mind the stain with which hi father had dim the
honour of hi famili and now a new misfortun hung over him he had
just been driven with contum from a hous where hitherto he wa the
most welcom of guest he had part moreov from the woman whom he
love dearli and under circumst which made it doubt if their
separ would not be final
leonard possess the gift of insight into charact and more common
sens than can often be expect from a young man in love he knew well
that the chief characterist of jane natur wa a tendenc to yield
to the circumst of the hour and though he hope against hope
he could find no reason to suppos that she would exhibit greater
determin in the matter of their engag than her gener lack
of strength might lead him to anticip besid and here hi common
sens came in would it be wise that she should do so after all
what had he to offer her and were not hi hope of futur advanc
noth better than a dream roughli as he had put it perhap mr
beach wa right when he told him that he leonard wa both selfish and
impertin sinc wa it not a selfish impertin in him to ask ani
woman to link her fortun with hi in the present state of hi affair
let us therefor make excus for hi word and outward behaviour for
at heart leonard had much to troubl him
when the cloth had been clear awai and thei were alon again tom
spoke to hi brother who wa moodili fill hi pipe
what shall we do tonight leonard he said
go to bed i suppos he answer
see here leonard said hi brother again what do you sai to have
a last look at the old place
if you wish tom but it will be pain
a littl pain more or less can scarc hurt us old fellow said tom
lai hi thin hand on hi brother shoulder
then thei start a quarter of an hour walk brought them to the
hall the snow had ceas fall now and the night wa beautifulli
clear but befor it ceas it had done a welcom offic in hide from
view all the litter and wreckag of the auction which make the scene
of a recent sale on of the most desol sight in the world never had
the old hous look grander or more eloqu of the past than it did on
that night to the two brother who were dispossess of their heritag
thei wander round it in silenc gaze affection at each
wellknown tree and window till at length thei came to the gunroom
entranc more from habit than for ani other reason leonard turn the
handl of the door to hi surpris it wa open after the confus of
the sale no on had rememb to lock it
let us go in he said
thei enter and wander from room to room till thei reach the
greater hall a vast and oakroof chamber built after the fashion of
the nave of a church and light by a larg window of ecclesiast
design thi window wa fill with the armori bear of mani
gener of the outram famili wrought in stain glass and place
in coupl for next to each coat of arm were the arm of it bearer
dame it wa not quit full howev for in it remain two blank
shield which had been destin to receiv the escutcheon of thoma
outram and hi wife
thei will never be fill now leonard said tom point to these
curiou isnt it not to sai sad
oh i dont know answer hi brother i suppos that the cohen
boast some sort of arm or if not thei can bui them
i should think that thei would have the good tast to begin a new
window for themselv said tom
then he wa silent for a while and thei watch the moonlight stream
through the paint window the memori of so much forgotten grandeur
and illumin the portrait of mani a dead outram that gaze upon them
from the panel wall
per ardua ad astra said tom absent read the famili motto
which altern pretti regularli with a second devic that some member
of it had adoptedfor heart home and honour
per ardua ad astrathrough struggl to the starsand for heart
home and honour repeat tom well i think that our famili never
need such consol more if inde there ar ani to be found in
motto our heart is broken our hearth is desol and our honour is
a byword but there remain the struggl and the star
as he spoke hi face took the fire of a new enthusiasm leonard
he went on why should not we retriev the past let us take that
mottoth more ancient onefor an omen and let us fulfil it i
believ it is a good omen i believ that on of us will fulfil it
we can try answer leonard if we fail in the struggl at least
the star remain for us as for all human kind
leonard said hi brother almost in a whisper will you swear an oath
with me it seem childish but i think that under some circumst
there is wisdom even in childish
what oath ask leonard
thi that we will leav england and seek fortun in some foreign
landsuffici fortun to enabl us to repurchas our lost home that
we will never return here until we have won thi fortun and that death
alon shall put a stop to our quest
leonard hesit a moment then answer
if jane fail me i will swear it
tom glanc round as though in search of some familiar object and
present hi ey fell upon what he sought a great proport of the
furnitur of the old hous includ the famili portrait had been
purchas by the incom owner among the articl which remain wa
a veri valuabl and ancient bibl on of the first ever print inde
that stood upon an oaken stand in the centr of the hall to which it
wa secur chain tom led the wai to thi bibl follow by hi
brother then thei place their hand upon it and stand there in the
shadow the elder of them spoke aloud in a voic that left no doubt of
the earnest of hi purpos or of hi belief in their mission
we swear he said upon thi book and befor the god who made us that
we will leav thi home that wa our and never look upon it again till
we can call it our onc more we swear that we will follow thi the
purpos of our live till death destroi us and it and mai shame and
utter ruin overtak us if while we have strength and reason we turn
our back upon thi oath so help us god
so help us god repeat leonard
thu in the home of their ancestor in the presenc of their maker and
of the pictur dead who had gone befor them did thoma and leonard
outram devot their live to thi great purpos perhap as on of them
had said the thing wa childish but if so at the least it wa solemn
and touch their caus seem hopeless inde but if faith can move
mountain much more can honest endeavour attain it end in that hour
thei felt thi ye thei believ that the end would be attain by on
of them though thei guess littl what struggl lai between them
and the star thei hope to gain or how strang thei should be born
thither
on the morrow thei went to london and wait there a while but no word
came from jane beach and for good or ill the chain of the oath that he
had taken rivet themselv around leonard outram neck
within three month of thi night the brother were near the shore
of africa the land of the children of the mist

each other hand
now let me sleep awhil i am tire do not be afraid i shall wake
befor theend
hardli had the word pass hi lip when hi ey close and he sank
into stupor or sleep
hi brother leonard sat down upon a rude seat improvis out of an
empti gincas without the tempest shriek and howl the great
wind shook the kaffir hut of grass and wattl pierc it in a hundr
place till the light of the lantern waver within it glass and
the sick man hair wa lift from hi clammi brow from time to
time fierc squall of rain fell like sheet of sprai and the water
penetr the roof of grass stream to the earthen floor leonard
crept on hi hand and knee to the doorwai of the hut or rather to the
low arch open which serv as a doorwai and remov the board
that secur it look out at the night their hut stood upon the ridg
of a great mountain below wa a sea of bush and around it rose the
fantast shape of other mountain black cloud drove across the dy
moon but occasion she peep out and show the scene in all it
vast solemn and appal solitud
present leonard close the open of the doorwai and go back to
hi brother side he gaze upon him earnestli mani year of toil and
privat had not rob thoma outram face of it singular beauti or
found power to mar it refin but death wa written on it
leonard sigh then struck by a sudden thought sought for and found a
scrap of lookingglass hold it close to the light of the lantern
he examin the reflect of hi own featur the glass mirror a
handsom beard man dark keenei like on who is alwai on the
watch for danger curlyhair and broadshould not veri tall but
have massiv limb and a form which show strength in everi movement
though he wa still young there wa littl of youth left about the man
clearli toil and struggl had done an evil work with him ag hi
mind and harden it as thei had harden the strength and vigour of
hi bodi the face wa a good on but most men would have prefer
to see friendship shine in those pierc black ey rather than the
light of enmiti leonard wa a bad enemi and hi long strive with the
world sometim led him to expect foe where thei did not exist
even now thi thought wa in hi mind he is dy he said to
himself as he laid down the glass with the care of a man who cannot
afford to hazard a belong howev trivial and yet hi face is
not so chang as mine is my god he is dy my brotherth onli
manth onli live creatur i love in the world except on perhap
if inde i love her still everyth is against usi should sai
against me now for i cannot count him our father wa our first enemi
he brought us into the world neglect us squander our patrimoni
dishonour our name and shot himself and sinc then what ha it been
but on continu fight against men and natur even the rock in which
i dig for gold ar foesvictori foe and he glanc at hi hand
scar and made unshap by labour and the fever that is a foe
death is the onli friend but he wont shake hand with me he take my
brother whom i love as he ha taken the other but me he leav
thu muse leonard sit sullenli on the red box hi elbow on hi
knee hi rough hand held beneath hi chin push forward the thick
black beard till it threw a huge shadow angular and unnatur on to
the wall of the hut while without the tempest now rave now lull
and now rave again an hourtwopass and still he sat not move
watch the face of the feverstricken man that from time to time
flush and wa troubl then grew pale and still it seem to him
as though by some strang harmoni of natur the deathsmitten blood wa
strive to keep pace with the beat of the storm know that present
life and storm would pass togeth into the same domain of silenc
at length tom outram open hi ey and look at him but leonard knew
that he did not see him as he wa the dy ey studi him inde and
were intellig but he could feel that thei read someth on hi
face that wa not known to himself nor could be visibl to ani other
manread it as though it were a write
so strang wa thi scrutini so meaningless and yet so full of a
mean which he could not grasp that leonard shrank beneath it he
spoke to hi brother but no answer cameonli the great hollow ey
read on in that book which wa print upon hi face that book seal
to him but to the dy man an open write
the sight of the act of death is alwai terribl it is terribl to
watch the latest wax and ebb of life and with the intellig to
comprehend that these flicker thi come and thi go these
sink and these last recoveri ar the trial flight of the
anim and etern principlecal it soul or what you willbefor
it trust itself afar still more terribl is it under circumst of
physic and mental desol such as those present to leonard outram
in that hour
but he had look on death befor on death in mani dread shape and
yet he had never been so much afraid what wa it that hi brother
or the spirit of hi brother read in hi face what learn had he
gather in that sleep of hi the last befor the last he could not
tellnow he long to know now he wa glad not to know and now he
strove to overcom hi fear
my nerv ar shatter he said to himself he is dy how shall i
bear to see him die
a gust of wind shook the hut rend the thatch apart and through the
rent a littl jet of rain fell upon hi brother forehead and ran down
hi pallid cheek like tear then the strang understand look pass
from the wide ey and onc more thei becam human and the lip were
open
water thei murmur
leonard gave him to drink with on hand hold the pannikin to hi
brother mouth and with the other support the dy head twice he
gulp at it then with a brusqu motion of hi wast arm he knock
the cup asid spill the water on the earthen floor
leonard he said you will succe
succe in what tom
you will get the monei and outramand found the famili afreshbut you
will not do it alon a woman will help you
then hi mind wander a littl and he mutter how is jane have you
heard from jane or some such word
at the mention of thi name leonard face soften then onc more grew
hard and anxiou
i have not heard of jane for year old fellow he said probabl she

while leonard
he sank back exhaust and at that moment a gust of wind fiercer than
ani which had gone befor leapt down the mountain gorg howl with
all the voic of the storm it caught the frail hut and shook it a
cobra hidden in the thick thatch awok from it lethargi and fell with
a soft thud to the floor not a foot from the face of the dy manthen
erect itself and hiss aloud with flicker tongu and head swollen
by rage leonard start back and seiz a crowbar which stood near but
befor he could strike the reptil sank down and draw it shine
shape across hi brother forehead onc more vanish into the thatch
hi ey did not so much as close though leonard saw a momentari
reflect of the bright scale in the dilat pupil and shiver at
thi ad terror shiver as though hi own flesh had shrunk beneath
the touch of those deadli coil it wa horribl that the snake should
creep across hi brother face it wa still more horribl that hi
brother yet live should not understand the horror it caus him to
rememb our invis companion that ancient enemi of mankind of whom
the reptil is an accept type it made him think of that long sleep
which the touch of such as thi ha no power to stir
ah now he wa goingit wa imposs to mistak that chang the last
quick quiver of the blood follow by an ashen pallor and the sob
of the breath slowli lessen into silenc so the dai had di last
night with a littl purpl of the skya littl sob of the
windthen ashen nothing and silenc but the silenc wa broken
the night had grown aliv indeedand with a fear life hark how the
storm yell those blast told of torment that rain beat like tear
what if hi brotherh did not dare to follow the thought home
hark how the storm yelledth veri hut wrench at it strong
support as though the hand of a hundr savag foe were drag it
it liftedbi heaven it wa gonegon crash down the rock on the
last hurrican blast of the tempest and there abov them lower the
sullen blue of the pass night fleck with scud cloud and there
in front of them to the east and between the mountain flare the
splendour of the dawn
someth had struck leonard heavili so heavili that the blood ran down
hi face he did not heed it he scarc felt it he onli clasp hi
brother in hi arm and for the first time for mani year he kiss
him on the brow stain it with the blood from hi wound
the dy man look up he saw the glori in the east now it ran along
the mountain side now it burn upon their summit to each summit a
pillar of flame a peculiar splendour of it own divers shape and
now the shape of fire leap from earth to heaven peopl the sky
with light the dull cloud caught the light but thei could not hold it
all back it fell to earth again and the forest lift up their arm
to greet it and it shone upon the face of the water
thoma outram sawand stagger to hi knee he stretch out hi arm
toward the rise sun mutter with hi lip
then he sank upon leonard breast and present all hi stori wa
told
chapter iv
the last vigil
for a while leonard sat by the bodi of hi brother the daylight grew
and gather about him the round ball of the sun appear abov the
mountain
the storm wa gone were it not for some broken fragment of the
vanish hut it would have been difficult to know even that it had
been insect began to chirrup lizard ran from the crevic of the
rock yonder the rainwash bud of a mountain lili open befor hi
ey still leonard sat on hi face stoni with grief till at length
a shadow fell upon him from abov he look upit wa cast by a
vultur wing as thei hurri to the place of death
grasp hi load rifl leonard sprang to hi feet nearer and nearer
came the bird wheel abov him in lessen circl it forgot the
presenc of the live in it desir for the dead leonard lift the
rifl aim and fire the report rang out clearli on the silent air
and wa echo from krantz and kloof and mountain side and from abov
answer the thud of the bullet for a moment the smitten bird swai
upon it wide pinion then thei seem to crumpl beneath it weight
and it fell heavili and lai flap and strike at the stone with it
strong beak
i also can kill said leonard to himself as he watch it die kill
till you ar killedthat is the law of life then he turn to the
bodi of hi brother and made it readi for burial as best he might
close the ey ty up the chin with a band of twist grass and
fold the thin toilworn hand upon the quiet heart
when all wa finish he paus from hi dread task and a thought
struck him
where ar those kaffir he said aloudth sound of hi voic seem
to dull the edg of solitudeth lazi hound thei ought to have been
up an hour ago hi otter otter
the mountain echo otter otter there wa no other repli again he
shout without result i dont like to leav it he said but i must
go and see and have cover the bodi with a red blanket to scare
awai the vultur he start at a run round some project rock that
border the littl plateau on which the hut had stood beyond them the
plateau continu and some fifti pace from the rock wa a hollow in
the mountain side where a softer vein of stone had been eaten awai by
centuri of weather
it wa here that the kaffir sleptfour of themand in front of thi
cave or grotto it wa their custom to make a fire for cook but on
that morn no fire wa burn and no kaffir were to be seen
still asleep wa leonard comment as he strode swiftli toward
the cave in anoth moment he wa in it shout otter otter and
salut with a vigor kick a prostrat form of which he could just
see the outlin the form did not move which wa strang for such
a kick should have suffer to wake even the laziest basuto from hi
soundest sleep leonard stop to examin it and the next moment
start back violent exclaim
great heaven it is cheat and he is dead
at thi moment a thick voic spoke from the corner of the cave in dutch
the voic of otter
i am here baa but i am ti the baa must loosen me i cannot
stir
leonard advanc strike a match as he came present it burn up
and he saw the man otter ly on hi back hi leg and arm bound
firmli with rimpi of hide hi face and bodi a mass of contus
draw hi huntingknif leonard cut the rimpi and brought the man
from out the cave carri rather than lead him
otter wa a knobnos kaffir that is of the bastard zulu race
the brother had found him wander about the countri in a state of
semistarv and he had serv them faithfulli for some year
thei had christen him otter hi nativ patronym be quit
unpronounc becaus of hi extraordinari skill in swim which
almost equal that of the anim after which he wa name
in face the man wa hideou though hi ugli wa not unpleas
be due chiefli to a great develop of hi tribal featur the
nose and in bodi he wa misshapen to the verg of monstros in fact
otter wa a dwarf measur littl more than four feet in height but
what he lack in height he made up in breadth it almost seem as
though intend by natur to be a man of mani inch he had been
compress to hi present dimens by art hi vast chest and limb
indic strength nearli superhuman hi long iron arm and massiv
head all gave colour to thi idea otter had on redeem featur
howeverhi ey that when visibl which at thi moment wa not the
case were larg steadi and like hi skin of a brilliant black
what ha happen said leonard also speak in dutch
thi baa last night those three basuto villain your servant made
up their mind to desert thei told me noth and thei were so cun
that though i watch even their thought i never guess thei knew
better than to tell me for i would have beaten themy all so thei
wait till i wa sound asleep then came behind me the three of them
and ti me fast that i should not hinder them and that thei might take
awai baa tom gun which you lent me and other thing soon i found
out their plan and though i laugh in their face oh my heart wa
black with rage
when the basuto dog had ti me thei mock me call me foul
name and sai that i might stop and starv with the white fool
my master who alwai dug for yellow iron and found so littl be
fool then thei got togeth everyth of valu ye down to the
kettl and made readi to go and each of them came and slap me on
the face and on burnt me here upon the nose with a hot brand
all thi i bore as a man must bear troubl which come from the ski
but when cheat took up baa tom gun and the other came with a reim
to tie me to the rock i could bear it no more so i shout aloud and
drove at cheat who held the gun ah thei had forgotten that if my arm
ar strong my head is stronger but like a bull i caught him fair
in the middl and hi back wa against the side of the cave he made
on nois no more he will never make anoth nois for my head
smash him up insid and the rock hurt me through him then the other
two hit me with kerriesgreat blowsand my arm be ti i could not
defend myself though i knew that thei would soon kill me so i groan
and drop down pretend to be deadjust like a stinkcat
at last think that thei had finish me the basuto ran awai in a
great hurri for thei fear lest you might hear the shout and should
come after them with rifl thei were so much afraid that thei left the
gun and most of the other thing after that i faint it wa silli
but those kerri of their ar of rhinocero horni should not have
mind so much had thei been of wood but the horn bite deep that is
all the stori it will pleas baa tom to know that i save hi gun
when he hear it he will forget hi sick and sai well done otter
ha otter your head is hard

dead he di at daybreak in my arm the fever kill him as it kill
the other inkoosi chief
otter heard and let hi bruis head fall upon hi mighti chest
remain for a while in silenc at length he lift it and leonard saw
two tear wander down the batter counten wow he said is
it so oh my father ar you dead you who were brave like a lion and
gentl as a girl ye you ar dead my ear have heard it and were it
not for your brother the baa leonard i think that i would kill myself

and he went otter follow him with a reel gait for he wa weak
from hi injuri present thei reach the spot and otter saw that
the hut wa gone
certainli he said our bad spirit were abroad last night well
next time it will be the turn of the good on then he drew near to
the corps and salut it with uplift hand and voic
chief and father he said in zulu for otter had wander long and
knew mani tongu but he love the zulu best of all while you live
upon earth you were a good man and brave though somewhat quick of
temper and quarrelsom like a woman now you have weari of thi world
and flown awai like an eagl toward the sun and there where you live
in the light of the sun you will be braver and better yet and becom
more patient and not quarrel ani more with those who ar less clever
than you chief and father i salut you mai he whom you name the
otter serv you and the inkoosi your brother onc more in the hous
of the greatgreat if on so ugli and misshapen can enter there as for

cheat hail my father hail and farewel let your spirit watch over us
and be gentl toward us who love you yet
and otter turn awai without further ado and have wash hi wound
he set himself to the task of prepar such coars food as thei had in
store
when it wa readi leonard at of it and after he had finish eat
togeth thei bore the bodi to the littl cave for shelter it wa
leonard purpos to buri hi brother at sundown he might not delai
longer but till then he would watch by him keep the last of mani
vigil so all that remain of the basuto cheat have been drag
forth and thrust unceremoni into an antbear hole by otter who
while he dispos of the bodi did not spare to taunt the spirit of hi
late treacher foe the corps of thoma outram wa laid in it place
and leonard sat himself by it side in the gloom of the cave
about middai otter who had been sleep off hi sorrow physic and
mental came into the cavern thei were short of meat he said and with
the leav of the baa he would take the gun of the dead baa and try to
shoot a buck
leonard bade him go but to be back by sundown as he should requir hi
help
where shall we dig a hole baa ask the dwarf
on is dug answer leonard he who is dead dug it himself as the
other did we will buri him in the last pit he made look for gold
to the right of where the hut stood it is deep and readi
ye baa a good placethough perhap baa tom would not have work
at it so strongli had he known wow who know to what end he labour
but perchanc it is a littl near the donga twice that hole ha been
flood while baa tom wa dig in it then he would jump out but
now
i have settl it said leonard shortli go and be back half an hour
befor sundown at latest stop bring some of those rocklili if you
can the baa wa fond of them
the dwarf salut and went ah he said to himself as he waddl down
the hill where he hope to find game ah you do not fear men dead or
livingovermuch yet otter it is true that you ar better here in
the sun though the sun is hot than yonder in the cave sai otter why
doe baa tom look so aw now that he is deadh who wa so gentl
while yet he live cheat did not look aw onli uglier but then you
kill cheat and the heaven kill baa tom and set their own seal
upon him and what will baa leonard do now that hi brother is dead and
the basuto have run awai go on dig for the yellow iron which is
so hard to find and of which when it is found no man can even make a
spear nai what is that to you otter what the baa doe you doand
here be the spoor of an impala buck
otter wa right the dai wa fearfulli hot it wa summer in east
africa or rather autumn the season of fever thunder and rain a time
that none who valu their live would care to spend in those latitud
search for gold with poor food and but littl shelter but men who
seek their fortun ar not chari of hazard their own live of
those of other thei becom fatalist not avowedli perhap but
unconsci those who ar destin to die must die thei think the
other will live and after all it doe not greatli matter which thei
do for as thei know well the world will never miss them
when leonard outram hi brother and two companion in adventur heard
from the nativ that at a particular spot on the mountain nomin
in the portugues territori near the lowest branch of the zambesi gold
could be dug out like iron or and when at the price of two tower
musket and a halfbr greyhound thei receiv a concess from the
actual chief of that territori to dig up and possess the gold without
let or hindranc from ani person whatsoev thei did not postpon their
undertak becaus the countri wa feverstricken and the unhealthi
season drew on in the first place their resourc were not great at
the moment and in the second thei fear lest some other enterpris
person with three tower musket and two greyhound should persuad the
chief to rescind their concess in hi favour
so thei journei labori to the place of hidden wealth and with
the help of such nativ labour as thei could gather began their search
at first thei were moder success inde wherev thei dug
thei found colour and onc or twice stumbl upon pocket of
nugget their hope ran high but present on of the fouraskew by
namesicken and di of fever thei buri him and persev with
vari luck then a second member of their parti johnston wa taken
ill he linger for a month and di also
after thi leonard wa for abandon the enterpris but as fate would
have it on the dai follow johnston death thei found gold in veri
promis quantiti and hi brother whose desir to win the wealth
necessari wa onli increas by mani disappoint would not listen
to such advic
so thei rebuilt the hut on a higher and healthier spot and stai but
on on unfortun dai thoma outram went out shoot and lose hi
path in the bush wa forc to spend a night in the feverfog a
week afterward he complain of sick and pain in the back and
headthre week later he di as we have seen
all these event and mani other anteced pass through leonard
mind as he wore out the long hour seat by the side of hi dead
brother never befor had he felt so lone so utterli desol so
bankrupt of all love and hope it wa a fact that at thi moment he had
no friend in the wide world unless he could call the knobnos nativ
otter a friend he had been mani year awai from england hi few
distant relat there troubl themselv no more about him or hi
brother outcast wander in strang land and hi school and
colleg companion in all probabl had forgotten hi exist
there wa on inde jane beach but sinc that night of part seven
year ago he had heard noth of her twice he had written but no
answer came to hi letter then he gave up write for leonard wa a
proud man moreov he guess that she did not repli becaus she could
not as he had said to hi brother jane might be dead by now or more
probabl marri to mr cohen and yet onc thei had love each other
and to thi hour he still love her or thought that he did at least
through all the weari year of exil labour and unceas search after
the unattain her imag and memori had been with him a distant
dream of sweet peac and beauti and thei were with him yet
though noth of her remain to him except the part gift of her
prayerbook and the lock of hair within it the wilder is not
a place where men can forget their earliest love no he wa alon
absolut and utterli alon a wander in wild land a sojourn with
rough unlett men and savag
and now what should he do thi place wa plai out there wa
alluvi gold inde but leonard knew todai that it wa not in the
earth but in the vein of quartz which permeat the mountain that
the real wealth must be sought for and how could he extract it from the
quartz without machineri or capit besid hi kaffir servant had
desert him worn out with hard work and fever and there were
no other to be had at thi season well it wa onli on more
disappoint he must go back to natal and take hi chanc at the
worst he could alwai earn hi live as a transportrid and at the
best he weari of thi search for wealth which wa to build up their
famili afresh
then of a sudden leonard rememb what he had promisedto go on
seek till he di veri good he would keep the promisetil he
di and he rememb also that curiou propheci to which thoma had
given utter on the previou night that propheci of wealth which
should come to him
of cours it wa noth but the distraught fanci of a dy man for
mani year hi brother had brood over thi possibl of gain
rich not for their own sake inde but that it might be the mean
of restor the ancient famili which their father had brought to shame
and ruin it wa not wonder in a man of hi excit tempera

of that rigid thing which had been hi playmat hi brother and hi
friend from time to time he rose and walk about the cave as the
afternoon wane the air grew hotter and stiller while a great cloud

when the burial wa finish and thoma outram slept hi last sleep
beneath six feet of earth and stone hi brother took out the
prayerbook that jane beach had given him which in truth form all hi
librari and read the funer servic over the grave end it by the
glare of the lightn flash then he and otter went back to the cave
and at speak no word after thei had done their meal leonard call
to the dwarf who took hi food at a littl distanc
otter he said set the lantern between them you ar a faith
man and clever in your wai i would tell you a stori and ask you

matter your judgment is as good as mine
speak on baa said the dwarf my ear ar open and he squat
down on the further side of the lantern like some great toad watch
hi master face with hi black ey
otter the baa who is dead and i journei to thi countri about seven
year ago befor we came here we had been rich men chief in our own
place but we lost our kraal and cattl and land thei were sold
other took them and we becam poor ye we who were fat grew lean as
trek oxen at the end of winter then we said to each other here we
have no longer ani home the shame of poverti ha come upon us we ar
broken vessel empti men of no account also we ar chief by blood
and here we cannot let ourselv out to labour like the common peopl
lest both the common peopl and the nobl should make a mock of us our
great stone kraal that ha been our for mani gener is taken from
us other dwell in it strang women order it and their children shall
move about the land we will go awai
the blood is the blood broke in otter the wealth is noth that
come and goe but the blood is alwai the blood why did you not
gather an impi my father and put these stranger to the spear and take
your kraal again
in our land thi mai not be otter for there wealth is more than race
so we should have been brought to still greater shame rich alon
could give us back our home and we had none left therefor we swore
an oath togeth the dead baa and i that we would journei to thi
far countri and seek to win wealth that we might bui back our land and
kraal and rule over them as in past year and our children after us
a good oath said otter but here we should have sworn it otherwis
and there would have been a ring of steel about that kraal not the
chink of yellow iron
we came otter and for seven year we have labour harder than the
lowest of our servant we have travel to and fro mix with mani
peopl learn mani tongu and what have we found the baa yonder
a grave in the wildernessi the food that the wilder give no
more
a poor wage so far said otter ah the wai of my peopl ar more
simpl and better a red spear is brighter than the red gold ye and
it is more honest
the wealth is unwon otter and i have sworn to win the wealth or die
but last night i swore it again to him who li dead
it is well baa an oath is an oath and true men must keep it but
rich cannot be gather here for the gold most of it is hid in
those rock that ar far too heavi to carri and who mai charm gold out
of the rock not all the wizard in zululand at the least you and i
cannot do it alon even should the fever spare us we must trek baa
and look elsewher
listen otter the tale is yet to tell the baa who is dead dream
befor he di he dream that i should win the gold that i should win
it by the help of a woman and he bade me wait here a while after he wa
dead sai now otter you who come of a peopl learn in dream and
ar the child of a dreamdoctor wa thi a true dream or a sick man
fanci
nai baa who can tell for sure the dwarf answer then ponder a
while and set himself to trace line in the dust of the floor with hi
finger yet i sai he went on that the word of the dead utter on
the edg of death shall come true he promis that you should win the
wealth you will win it by thi wai or that and the great kraal across
the water shall be your again and the children of stranger shall
wander there no more let us obei the word of the dead and bide here
awhil as he command
seven dai had pass and on the night of the seventh leonard outram
and otter sat togeth onc more in the littl cave on grave mountain
for so thei name thi fatal spot thei did not speak though each of
them wa speak after hi own fashion and both had caus for thought
thei had been hunt all dai but kill noth except a guineafowl
most of which thei had just eaten it wa the onli food left to them
game seem to have abandon the districtat least thei could find
none
sinc hi brother death leonard had given up all attempt to dig for
goldit wa useless time hung heavi on hi hand for a man cannot
search all dai for buck which ar not gloom had settl on hi mind
also he felt hi brother loss more acut now than on the dai he
buri him moreov for the first time he suffer from symptom of
the deadli fever which had carri off hi three companion ala
he knew too well the mean of thi lassitud and nausea and of the
rack pain which from time to time shot through hi head and limb
that wa how hi brother last sick had begun
would hi own dai end in the same fashion he did not greatli care he
wa reckless as to hi fate for the hard necess of life had left
him littl time or inclin to rack himself with spiritu doubt
and yet it wa aw to think of he rehears the whole scene in hi
mind again and yet again until it becam a realiti to him he saw hi
own last struggl for life and otter watch it he saw the dwarf
bear him in hi great arm to a lone grave there to cover him with
earth and then with a sigh to flee the haunt spot for ever why
did he stop to die of fever becaus hi brother had bidden him to do so
with hi dy breath becaus of a superstit a folli which would
move ani civilis man to scorn
ah there wa the rub he wa no longer a civilis man he had live so
long with natur and savag that he had come to be as natur make
the savag hi educ reason told him that thi wa folli but hi
instinctthat faculti which had begun to take the place of educ
reason with himspok in anoth voic he had gone back in the scale
of life he had grown primit hi mind wa as the mind of a norseman
or of an aztec it did not seem wonder to him that hi brother should
have prophesi upon hi dy bed it did not strike him as strang
even that he should believ in the propheci and act upon it and yet
he knew that in all probabl thi obedi would result in hi own
death
those who have live much with natur will in some degre be familiar
with such sensat for man and natur ar ever at varianc and each
would shape the other to it end in the issu natur win man boast
continu of hi conquest over her her instinct her terror and
her hope but let him escap from out hi citi and the fellowship
of hi kind let him be alon with her for a while and where is hi
supremaci he sink back on to her breast again and is lost there as in
time to be all hi labour shall be lost the grass of the field and the
sand of the desert ar more power than babylon thei were befor her
thei ar after her and so it is with everyth physic and moral in
their degre for here rule a nurs whom we human children must obei
at last howev much we mai defi her
thu brood leonard as he sat hi hand in hi pocket and an empti
pipe between hi teeth their tobacco wa done and yet he drew at the
pipe perhap from habit and all the while otter watch him
baa he said at length you ar sick baa
no he answer that is perhap a littl
ye baa a littl you have said noth but i know i who watch
the fever ha touch you with hi finger byandbi he will grip you
with hi whole hand and then baa
and then otter good night
ye baa for you good night and for me what baa you think too
much and you have noth to do that is why you grow sick better that
we should go and dig again
what for otter antbear hole make good grave
evil talk baa rather let us go awai and wait no more than that you
should talk such talk which is the begin of death
then there wa silenc for a while
the truth is otter said leonard present we ar both fool it
is useless for us to stai here with noth to eat noth to drink
noth to smoke and onli the fever to look forward to expect we
know not what but what doe it matter fool and wise men all come to
on end lord how my head ach and how hot it is i wish that we had
some quinin left i am go out and he rose impati and left the
cave
otter follow him he knew where he would goto hi brother grave
present thei were there stand on the hither edg of a ravin a
cloud had hidden the face of the moon and thei could see noth so
thei stood awhil idli wait for it to pass
as thei rest thu suddenli a moan sound came to their ear or

that cri aloud in thi desol place for there not twenti pace
from them on the other side of the ravin crouch upon a stone and
rock herself to and fro as though in an agoni of despair and grief
sat a tall and wither woman
with an exclam of surpris leonard start toward her follow by
the dwarf so absorb wa the woman in her sorrow that she neither saw
nor heard them even when thei stood close to her she did not perceiv
them for her face wa hidden in her boni hand leonard look at her
curious she wa past middl ag but he could see that onc she had
been handsom and for a nativ veri light in colour her hair wa
grizzl and crisp rather than woolli and her hand and feet were

woman person appear for the face wa cover as ha been said
and her bodi wrap in a tatter blanket
mother he said speak in the sisutu dialect what ail you that

the stranger let drop her hand and sprang up with a cry of fear as it

chapter vi
the tale of soa
my lord i soa am the servant of a white man a trader who live
on the bank of the zambesi some four dai march from henc have a
hous there which he built mani year ago
how is the white man name ask leonard
the black peopl call him mavoom but hi white name is rodd he is a
good master and no common man but he ha thi fault that at time he
is drunken twenti year ago or more mavoom my lord marri a white
woman a portugues whose father dwelt at delagoa bai and who wa
beauti ah beauti then he settl on the bank of the zambesi
and becam a trader build the hous where he is now or rather where
it ruin ar here hi wife di in childbirth ye she di in my
arm and it wa i who rear her daughter juanna tend her from the
cradl to thi dai
now after the death of hi wife mavoom becam more drunken still
when he is not in liquor he is veri clever and a good trader and
sever time he ha collect ivori and feather and gold worth much
monei and also ha bred cattl by hundr then he would sai that he
must leav the wilder and go to anoth countri across the water i
know not where that countri whenc the englishmen come
twice he ha start to go and i with him and hi daughter juanna my
mistress who is name the shepherdess of heaven by the black peopl
becaus thei think that she ha the gift of foretel rain but onc
mavoom stop in a town at durban in natal and get drunk he
gambl awai all hi monei in a month and onc he lost it in a river
the boat be overset by a riverhors and the ivori and gold sink
out of sight still the last time that he start he left hi daughter
the shepherdess at durban and there she stai for three year
learn those thing that the white women know for she is veri clever
as clever as she is beauti and good now for nearli two year she
ha been back at the settlement for she came to delagoa bai in a ship
and i with her and mavoom met us
but on month gone my mistress the shepherdess spoke to her father
mavoom tell him that she weari of their lone life in the
wilder and wish to sail across the water to the land which is
call home he listen to her for mavoom love hi daughter and said
that it should be so but he said thi also that first he would go on
a trade journei up the river to bui a store of ivori of which he knew
now she wa against thi sai let us start at onc we have tempt
chanc too long and onc again we ar rich let us go to natal and pass
over the sea
still he would not listen for he is a headstrong man so on the morrow
he start to search for the store of ivori and the ladi juanna hi
daughter wept for though she is fearless it wa not fit that she
should be left thu alon also she hate to be apart from her father
for it is when she is not there to watch that he becom drunken
mavoom left and twelv dai went by while i and my mistress the
shepherdess sat at the settlement wait till he return now it is
the custom of my mistress when she is dress to read each morn
from a certain holi book in which ar written the law of that
greatgreat whom she worship on the thirteenth morn therefor she
sat beneath the verandah of the hous read in the book accord to
her custom and i went about my work make food readi suddenli i heard
a tumult and look over the wall which is round the garden and to the
left of the hous i saw a great number of men some of them white
some arab and some halfbre on mount and the other on foot
and behind them a long caravan of slave with the slavestick set upon
their neck
as thei came these men fire gun at the peopl of the settlement
who ran thi wai and that some of the peopl fell and more were made
captiv but other of them got awai for thei were at work in the
field and had seen the slavetrad come
now as i gaze affright i saw my mistress the shepherdess fly
toward the wall behind which i stood the book she wa read be
still in her hand but as she reach it the man mount on the mule
overtook her and she turn about and face him set her back
against the wall then i crouch down and hid myself among some
bananatre and watch what pass through a crack in the wall
the man on the mule wa old and fat hi hair wa white and hi face
yellow and wrinkl i knew him at onc for often i have heard of him
befor who ha been the terror of thi countri for mani year he is
name the yellow devil by the black peopl but hi portugues name is
pereira and he ha hi place in a secret spot down by on of the mouth
of the zambesi here he collect the slave and here the trader come
twice a year with their dhow to carri them to market
now thi man look at my mistress as she stood terrifi with her back
against the wall then he laugh and cri aloud in portugues here
we have a pretti prize thi must be that juanna of whose beauti i have
heard where is your father my dove gone trade up the river ha he
not ah i knew it or perhap i should not have ventur here but it
wa wrong of him to leav on so pretti all alon well well he is
about hi busi and i must be about mine for i am a merchant also
my dove a merchant who trade in blackbird on with silver feather
doe not often come my wai and i must make the most of her there
is mani a young man in our part who will bid briskli for such ey as
your never fear my dove we will soon find you a husband
thu the yellow devil spoke white man while the shepherdess my
mistress crouch against the wall and stare at him with frighten
ey and the slavetrad hi servant laugh aloud at hi evil
word present she seem to understand and i saw her slowli lift her
hand toward her head then i knew her purpos
now there is a certain deadli poison white man of which i have
the secret and that secret i taught long ago to my mistress it is so
deadli that a piec of it no larger than the smallest ant can kill
a many the instant after it touch hi tongu he will be dead
live alon as she doe in the wild it is the custom of my mistress
to carri a portion of thi poison hidden in her hair sinc a time might
come when she must us it to save herself from wors than death now it
seem to her that thi hour wa upon her and i knew that she wa about
to take the poison then in my fear i whisper to her through the crack
in the wall speak in an ancient tongu which i have taught her
the tongu of my own peopl white man and sai hold your hand
shepherdess while you live you mai escap but from death there is no
escap it will be time to us the poison when the worst is with you
she heard and understood for i saw her bow her head slightli and her
hand fell to her side then pereira spoke again
and now if you ar readi he said we will be move for it is
eight dai journei to my littl nest on the coast and who can tell
when the dhow will come to fetch my blackbird have you anyth to
sai befor you go my dove
now my mistress spoke for the first time answer i am in your
power but i do not fear you for if need be i can escap you but i
tell you thi that your wicked shall bring your own death
upon you and she glanc round at the bodi of those whom the
slavetrad had murder at the captiv upon whom thei were set
chain and fork of wood and the column of smoke that were rise from
her home for the roof of the settlement had been fire
for a moment the portugues look frighten then he laugh aloud
and said with an oath cross himself after the fashion of hi peopl
as a protect against the curs what you prophesi do you my dove
and you can escap me at your will can you well we shall see bring
the other mule for thi ladi you fellow
the mule wa brought and juanna my mistress wa set upon it then
the slavetrad shot down such of the captiv as thei thought to be
of no valu the driver flog the slave with their threethong
sjamboch of hippopotamushid and the caravan move on down the
bank of the river
when all had gone i crept from my hidingplac and sought out those men
of the settlement who had escap the slaughter prai them to find
arm and follow on the yellow devil spoor wait for an opportun
to rescu the shepherdess whom thei love but thei would not do thi
for the heart wa out of them thei were cow by fear and most of the
headmen had been taken captiv no thei would do noth except weep
over their dead and the burnt kraal you coward i said if you
will not come then i must go alon at the least let some of you pass
up the river and search for mavoom to tell him what ha chanc here in
hi hous
the men said that thei would do thi and take a blanket and a littl
food i follow upon the track of the slavedriv for four dai i
follow sometim come in sight of them till at length the meat wa
done and my strength left me on the morn of the fifth dai i could
go no farther so i crept to the top of a koppi and watch their long
line wind across the plain in it centr were two mule and on on
of these mule sat a woman then i knew that no harm had befallen my
mistress as yet for she still live
now from the koppi i saw a littl kraal far awai to the right and to
thi kraal i came that same afternoon with my last strength i told it
peopl that i had escap from the slavedriv and thei treat me
kindli here it wa also i learnt that some white men from natal were
dig for gold in these mountain and next dai i travel on in
search of them think perchanc thei would help me for i know well
that the english hate the slavedriv and here my lord i am come
at last with much toil and now i prai you deliv my mistress the
shepherdess from the hand of the yellow devil oh my lord i seem poor

a great reward ye i will reveal to you that which i have kept hidden
all my life ay even from mavoom my master i will reveal to you the
secret treasur of my peopl the children of the mist
now when leonard who all the while had been listen attent and
in silenc to soa tale heard her last word he rais hi head and
stare at her think that her sorrow had made her mad there wa no
look of mad upon the woman fierc face howev but onli on of

like a dwarf and to him thei offer the blood of men beneath the feet
of the statu is a pool of water and beyond the pool is a cave in that
cave white man he dwell whom thei ador in effigi abov he jal
whose name is terror
do you mean that a dwarf live in the cave ask leonard
no white man not a dwarf but a holi crocodil which thei name the
snake the biggest crocodil in the whole world and the oldest for he
ha dwelt there from the begin it is thi snake that devour the
bodi of those who ar offer to the black on
as i remark befor said leonard all thi is veri romant and
interest but i cannot see that there is much profit to be made out
of it
white man the live of men ar not the onli thing which the priest
of the children of the mist offer to their god thei offer also such
toi as thi white man and suddenli she unclos her hand and
exhibit to leonard astonish gaze a rubi or what appear to be
a rubi of such size and so love a colour that hi ey were dazzl
when he look at it the gem though roughli polish wa uncut but
it dimens were those of a small blackbird egg it wa of the
purest pigeonblood colour without a flaw and worn almost round
appar by the action of water now as it chanc leonard knew
someth of gem although unhappili he wa less acquaint with the
peculiar of the rubi than with those of most other stone thu
although thi magnific specimen might be a true stone as inde
appear to be the case it wa quit possibl that it wa onli a
spinel or a garnet and ala he had no mean of set hi doubt at
rest
do your peopl find mani of these pebbl soa he ask and if so
where do thei find them
ye white man thei find mani though few of such a size as thi
thei dig them out of a dry riverb in some spot that is known to the
priest onli and with them other beauti stone of a blue colour
sapphir probabl said leonard to himself thei gener go
togeth
everi year thei dig them she went on and the biggest of those that
ar found in their dig thei bind upon the brow of her who is to be
offer as a wife to the god jal afterward befor she di thei take
the gem from her brow and store it in a secret place and there in that
secret place ar hidden all those that have been worn by the victim of
countless year moreov the ey of jal ar made of such stone and
there ar other
thi is the legend of my peopl white man that jal god of death and
evil slew hi mother aca in the far past there where the stone ar
found he slew her and the red gem ar her blood and the blue gem ar
her tear which she shed prai to him for merci therefor the blood
of aca is offer to jal and so it shall be offer till aca come
again to drive hi worship from the land
a nice bit of mytholog i am sure said leonard our old friend the
dark and the dawn in an african shape i suppos but listen to me
mother thi stone if it is genuin is worth mani ounc of gold but
there ar other stone so like it that none who ar not learn can tell
the differ and if it be on of these it is of littl valu still
it mai happen that thi and the other of which you speak ar true
rubi at ani rate i should be will to take my chanc of that but
now tell me what is your plan thi is a veri pretti stori and the
rubi mai be there but how am i to get them
i have a plan white man she answer if you will help me i offer
to give you that stone which i have born hidden about me for mani
year tell it stori to none no not even to mavoom i offer
to give it to you now if you will promis to attempt the rescu of my
mistress for i know by your ey that if onc you promis you will not
desert the quest and she paus look at him keenli
veri well said leonard but consid the risk the price doe not
seem quit good enough as i told you thi stone mai be worth noth
you must make a better bid mother
truli white man i have judg you well answer soa with a sneer
also you ar wise littl work for littl wage listen now thi is the
pai i proffer you
if you succe and the shepherdess is save aliv from the grip of the
yellow devil i promis thi on her behalf and on my own that i will
guid you to the land of the peopl of the mist and show you a wai
to win for yourself all those other countless stone that ar hidden
there
good said leonard but why do you promis on behalf of your mistress
and yourself what ha she got to do with it
without her noth can be done white man thi peopl is great and
strong and we have no forc with which to conquer them in war here
craft must be your spear
you must speak more clearli soa i cannot wast time in guess
riddl how will you conquer thi peopl by craft and what ha miss
rodd whom you name the shepherdess to do with the matter
that you shall learn byandbi after you have rescu her white man
till then my lip ar shut i tell you that i have a plan and thi must
be enough for more i will not sai if you ar not content let me go to
seek help elsewher
leonard thought a moment and see that she wa determin not to be
more explicit said
veri well then and now how am i to know that your mistress will fall
in with thi scheme
i answer for her said soa she will never go back upon my word look
you white man it is not for a littl thing that i would have told you
thi tale if you journei to the land of the peopl of the mist i must
go with you and there should i be discov my death wait me i
tell you the tale or some of it and i offer you the bribe becaus
i see that you need monei and i am sure that without the chanc of
win monei you will not hazard your life in thi desper search
but i love my mistress so well that i am readi to hazard mine ay i
would give six live if i had them to save her from the shame of the
slave now white man we have talk enough is it a bargain
what do you sai otter ask leonard thoughtfulli pull at hi
beard you have heard all thi wonder tale and you ar clever
ye baa said the dwarf speak for the first time i have heard
the tale and as for be clever perhap i am and perhap i am not my
peopl said that i wa clever and that is on of the reason why thei
would not have me for a chief if i had been clever onli thei could
have born it thei said or if i had been ugli onli but be both
ugli and clever i wa no chief for them thei fear lest i should rule
them too well and make all the peopl to be born ugli also ah thei
were fool thei did not understand that it want someon clever than
i to make peopl so ugli
never mind all that said leonard who understood howev that the
dwarf wa talk thu in order to give himself time to think befor he
answer show me your mind otter
baa what can i sai i know noth of the valu of that red stone
i do not know whether thi woman of whom my heart tell me no good
speak truth or li about a distant peopl who live in a fog and
worship a god shape as i am none have ever worship me yet there
mai be a land where i should be deem worthi of worship and if so
i should like to travel in that land but as to the rescu of thi
shepherdess from the nest of the yellow devil i do not know how it can
be brought about sai mother how mani of the men of mavoom were taken
prison with your mistress
fifti of them perchanc answer soa
well now went on the dwarf if we could loos those men and if thei
ar brave we might do someth but there ar mani if about it
baa still if you think the pai is good enough we can try it will be
better than sit here and it doe not matter what happen everi man
to hi fate baa and fate to everi man
a good motto said leonard soa i take your offer though i am a
fool for my pain and now with your leav we will put the matter
into write so that there mai be no mistak about it afterward get a
littl blood from the buck flesh otter and mix gunpo water with it
that will do for ink if we add some hot water
while the dwarf wa compound thi omin mixtur leonard sought of
paper he could find none the last had been lost when the hut wa blown
awai on the night of hi brother death then he bethought him of
the prayerbook which jane beach had given him he would not us the
flyleaf becaus her name wa on it so he must write across the
titlepag and thu he wrote in small neat letter with hi mixtur of
blood and gunpowd straight through the order of common prayer
agreement between leonard outram and soa the nativ woman
i the said leonard outram agre to us hi best effort to rescu
juanna the daughter of mr rodd now reduc to a state of slaveri and
believ to be in the power of on pereira a slavedeal
ii in consider of the servic of the said leonard outram the
said soa deliv to him a certain stone believ to be a rubi of which
the said leonard outram herebi acknowledg the receipt
iii should the rescu be effect the said soa herebi agre on
behalf of herself and the said juanna rodd to conduct the said leonard
outram to a certain spot in central south eastern africa inhabit by
a tribe known as the peopl of the mist there to reveal to him and to
help him to gain possess of the store of rubi us in the religi
ceremoni of the said tribe further the said soa agre on behalf of
the said juanna rodd that she the said juanna will accompani her upon
the journei and will plai among the said peopl of the mist ani
part that mai be requir of her as necessari to the success of thi
undertak
iv it is mutual agre that these enterpris be prosecut until
the said leonard outram is satisfi that thei ar fruitless
sign in the manica mountain eastern africa on the ninth dai of mai
18
when he had finish thi document perhap on of the most remark
that were ever written sinc pizarro drew up hi famou agreement for
the divis of the prospect spoil of peru leonard read it aloud
and laugh heartili to himself it wa the first time that he had
laugh for some month then he translat it to hi companion not
without complais for it had a truli legal sound and your layman
love to affect the lawyer
what do you think of that otter he ask when he had finish
it is fine baa veri fine answer the dwarf wonder ar the
wai of the white man but baa how can the old woman promis thing
on behalf of anoth
leonard pull hi beard reflect the dwarf had put hi finger
upon the weak spot in the document but he wa save the necess of
answer by soa herself who said quietli have no fear white man
that which i promis in her name my mistress will certainli perform
if so be that you can save her give me the pen that i mai make my mark
upon the paper but first do you swear upon the red stone that you will
perform what you undertak in thi write
so leonard laugh swore and sign and soa made her mark then
otter affix hi as wit to the deed and the thing wa finish
laugh again at the comic of the transact which inde he had
carri out more by wai of joke than for ani other reason leonard put
the prayerbook in hi pocket and the great rubi into a divis of
hi belt the old woman watch the stone vanish with an express of
triumph on her face then she cri exultingli
ah white man you have taken my pai and now you ar my servant to the
end he who swear upon the blood of aca swear an oath inde and woe
be to him if he should break it
quit so answer leonard i have taken your pai and i mean to earn
it so we need not enter into the matter of the blood of aca it seem
to me more probabl that our own blood will be in question befor all is
said and done and now we had better make readi to start
chapter viii
the start
food wa their first consider and to provid it leonard bade otter
cut the lump of raw meat into strip and set them upon the rock to dry
in the broil sun then thei sort their good and select such of
them as thei could carri
ala thei were but few a blanket apiecea spare pair of boot
apiecesom calomel and sundri from the medicinechesta shot gun
and the two best rifl and ammunitiona compass a water bottl
three knive a comb and a small iron cookingpot made up the totala
consider weight for two men and a woman to drag across mountain
untravel plain and swamp thi baggag wa divid into three
load of which soa wa the lightest and that of otter weigh as
much as the other two put togeth
it wa noth he said he could carri the three if need were and
so great wa the dwarf strength that leonard knew thi to be no idl
boast
at length all wa prepar and the articl that remain were buri
in the cave togeth with the mine tool it wa not like that thei
would ever return to seek them more probabl thei will lie there till
thousand of year henc thei ar dug up and becom priceless relic
of the angloafrican ag still thei hid them on the chanc leonard had
melt the fruit of their mine into littl ingot in all there were
about a hundr ounc of almost pure goldth price of three men
live half of these ingot he place with the rubi in the belt about
hi middl and half he gave to otter who hid them in hi bundl
leonard first idea wa to leav the bullion becaus it entail the
carri of extra weight but he rememb in time that gold is
alwai us and nowher more so than among portugues and arab
slavedriv
by even everyth wa readi and when the edg of the moon show
abov the horizon leonard rose and lift hi load fasten it upon
hi shoulder with the loop of hide which had been prepar otter and
soa follow hi exampl it wa their plan to travel by night so long
as the state of the moon serv them for thu thei would escap the
terribl heat and lessen the danger of be observ
follow me in a few minut said leonard to otter you will find me
by the donga
the dwarf nod a quarter of an hour later he start also with soa
and found hi master stand barehead by hi brother grave take
a mute farewel of that which lai beneath befor he left it for ever to
it long sleep in the untrodden wilder it wa a melancholi part
but there have been mani such in the african fever belt
with on last look leonard turn and join hi companion then
have taken counsel with them and with the compass he set hi face to
the mountain and hi heart to the new adventur hope and fear that
were beyond it the past wa done with it lai buri in yonder grave
but by the merci of god he wa still a man live beneath the sunlight
and the futur stretch awai befor him what would it bring he care
littl experi had taught him the futil of anxieti as to
the futur perchanc a grave like those which he had left perchanc
wealth love and honour whatev the event he would strive to meet
it with patienc digniti and resign it wa not hi part to ask
question or to reason why it wa hi part to struggl on and take such
guerdon as it pleas provid to send him
thu thought leonard and thi is the right spirit for an adventur to
cultiv it is the right spirit in which to meet the good and ill of
lifethat greatest of adventur which everi on of us must dare he
who meet them thu and hold hi heart pure and hi hand clean will
lai himself down to sleep without a sigh or a regret when mountain
swamp river and forest all ar travel and the unknown innumer
treasur buri from the olden time far out of reach of man sight and
knowledg at last is open to hi gaze
so leonard start and hi hope were high notwithstand the
desper natur of their undertak for here it must be confess
that the undesir element of superstit still held fast upon hi
mind and now with some slight caus had not hi brother spoken of
wealth that he should win by the aid of a woman and had not a woman
come to him bear in her hand a jewel which if real wa in itself
worth a moder fortun promis also with the help of anoth
woman to lead him to a land where mani such might be found ye these
thing were so and it mai be pardon to leonard if set asid the
theori of coincid he began to believ that the end would be as the
begin had been that the great adventur would be achiev and the
wealth be won
we shall not need to follow the footstep of leonard outram and hi
companion dai by dai for a week thei travel on journei mostli
by night as thei had propos thei climb mountain thei struggl
through swamp and forest thei swam river inde on of these wa in
flood and thei never could have cross it had it not been for otter
power of natat six time did the dwarf face the torrent bear
their good and gun held abov the water with on hand on the seventh
journei he wa still more heavili weight for with some assist
from leonard he must carri the woman soa who could swim but littl
but he did it and without ani great fatigu it wa not until otter wa
seen stem a heavi current that hi vast strength could be measur
here inde hi stunt statur wa a posit advantag for it
offer the less surfac for the water to act upon
so thei travel forward sometim hungri sometim full of meat
and even of what were better of milk and corn for the countri wa not
entir desert occasion thei came to scatter kraal and were
abl to obtain provis from their peac inhabit in return for
some such trifl as an empti cartridg of brass at first leonard wa
afraid lest soa should tire but notwithstand her year and the
hardship and suffer which she had undergon she show wonder
enduranceendur so wonder that he came to the conclus that
it wa her spirit which support the frailti of her bodi and the
everpres desir to rescu on whom she love as a surli dog
sometim love it master howev thi might be she push forward
with the rest rare speak except to urg them onward
on the eighth night of their journei thei halt upon the crest of a
high mountain the moon had set and it wa imposs to go further
moreov thei were weari with long march wrap themselv up
in their blanketsfor here the air wa piercingli coldthei lai down
beneath the shelter of some bush to sleep till dawn it wa otter who
woke them look baa he said to leonard we have march straight
there below us is the big river and there far to the right is the sea
thei look some mile from them across the great plain of bush that
merg gradual into swamp lai that branch of the zambesi which thei
would reach thei could not see it inde for it face wa hid by a
dens cloak of soft white mist that cover it like a cloud but there
it wa won at last and there awai to the eastward shone the wide
glitter of the sea fleck with faint line of broken billow whenc
the sun rose in glori
see baa said otter when thei had satisfi themselv with
the beauti sight yonder some five hour march from here the
mountain curv down to the edg of the river thither we must go for
it is on the further side of those hill that the great swamp li where
the yellow devil ha hi place i know the spot well i have pass it
twice
thei rest till noondai but that night befor the moon rose thei
stood on the curv of the mountain close down to the water edg at
length she came up and show them a wonder scene of desol
beyond the curv of hill the mountain trend out again to the south
gradual grow lower till at last thei melt into the skylin
in the vast semicircl thu form ran the river spot with green
island while between it and the high ground over a space which vari
from on mile at the narrowest to twenti mile in width at the broadest
of the curv wa spread a huge and dismal swamp mark by patch of
stagnant water cloth with reed which grew to the height of small
tree and exhal a stench as of the rotten of ag
the loneli of the place wa dread it wast and desol were
appal and yet it live with a life of it own wild fowl flew in
wedg from the sea to feed in it recess allig and hippopotami
splash in the water bittern boom among the rush and from everi
pool and quagmir came the croak of a thousand frog
yonder run the slave road or yonder it onc ran said otter
point to the foot of a hill
let us go and see answer leonard we can follow it for a while and
camp
thei climb down the hill at it foot otter cast backward and
forward among the bush like a hound then he held up hi hand and
whistl
i thought so he said as the other drew near the path is still the
same look baa
as he spoke he broke down the branch of a creep bush with hi
strong foot among them lai the moulder skeleton of a woman and by
her side that of a child
not long dead said otter phlegmat perhap two week ah the
yellow devil leav a spoor that all mai follow
soa bent over the bone and examin them on of mavoom peopl she
said i know the fashion of the anklet
then thei march on for two hour or more till at length thei came to
a spot where the trail ran to the edg of the water and stop
what now otter said leonard
here the slave ar put on boat baa the dwarf answer the boat
should be hidden yonder and he point to some thick reed there too
thei weed the corn kill out the weakli on that thei mai not be
burden with them let us go and look
thei went otter lead the wai present he halt the boat ar
gone he said all except on cano but the weed lie in a heap as
of old
he wa right pile in a littl open space lai the bodi of some thirti
men women and children recent dead in other space close by were
similar heap but these were of bleach bone on which the moonlight
shone brightlymemento of former sacrific quit close to the first
pile of dead wa a mooringplac where at least a dozen flatbottom
boat had been secur for their impress could yet be seen in the
sand now thei were gone with the except of the cano which wa kept
there evid to facilit the load and launch of the larg
boat
nobodi made ani comment the sight wa beyond comment but a fierc
desir rose in leonard heart to come face to face with thi yellow
devil who fatten on the blood and agoni of helpless human be and
to aveng them if he might
the light is go we must camp here till the morn he said after
a while
and there thei camp in thi golgotha thi place of bone everi on
of which cri to heaven for vengeanc
the night wind swept over them whisper in the giant reed fashion
the mist into fantast shape that threw strang shadow on the inki
surfac of the water as it crept slowli to the sea from time to time
the frog broke into a sudden choru of croak then grew silent
again the heron cri from afar as some allig or riverhors
disturb it rest and from high in air came the sound of the wing of
wildfowl that travel to the ocean but to leonard fanci all these
variou voic of natur were as on voic that spoke from the pile of
skeleton gleam faintli in the uncertain starlight and cri oh
god how long shall iniqu have power on the earth oh god how long
shall thy hand be stai
the dark pass the sun shone out merrili and the travel
aros brush the nightdew from their hair and at a scanti meal for
thei must husband such food as thei had with them then as though by
common consent thei went to the cano bail her out and start
leonard and otter us the paddl
now it wa that the dwarf marvel memori for local came into
plai without him thei could not have gone a mile for their cours ran
through numberless lagoon and canal cut by natur and the current
in the dens bank of reed there wa noth to enabl them to
distinguish on of these canal from anoth in truth thei all form
a portion of thi mouth of the river there were no landmark to guid
them everywher spread a sea of swamp diversifi by rushcloth
island which to the inexperienc ey present few point of
differ thi wa the road that otter led them on unfalteringli ten
year had pass sinc he had travel it but he never even hesit
time upon time thei came to new open in the reed lead thi wai
and that then for a moment the dwarf would consid and lift hi
hand point out which waterwai thei should choos and thei follow
it
thu thei went on for the most part of that dai till toward even
thei reach a place where the particular canal that thei were follow
suddenli divid itself into two on branch run north and on in a
southerli direct
which wai otter ask leonard
nai baa i know not the water ha chang there wa no land here
the cut went straight on
thi wa a seriou matter for on fals step in such a labyrinth meant
that thei would be lost utterli for long thei debat which stream
to take and at last decid to try that on the left hand which otter
thought ran more nearli in the true direct thei had alreadi start
in pursuanc of hi advic when soa who had remain silent hitherto
suggest that thei should first go a littl wai down the righthand
stream on the chanc of find a clue leonard demur but as the
woman seem bent upon it he yield and turn the boat thei paddl
her some three hundr yard in thi new direct as there wa noth
to be seen howev otter began to put her about again
stai white man said soa who had been search the surfac of the
water with her quick ey what is that thing yonder and she point
to a clump of reed about forti yard awai among which some small white
object wa just discern
feather i think leonard answer but we will go and see in
anoth moment thei were there
it is paper baa said otter in a low voic paper stuck on a reed
lift it carefulli answer leonard in the same tone for hi anxieti
wa keen how came it that thei found paper fix to a reed in such a
place as thi
otter obei lai the sodden sheet on the thwart of the cano befor
leonard who with soa examin it close
thi is a leaf from that holi book in which my mistress read said
the woman with convict i know the shape of it well she ha torn
the paper out and affix it on the reed as a sign to ani who might come
after her
it look like it said leonard that wa a good thought of your to
turn up here old ladi then he bent down and read such vers as were
still legibl on the page thei ran thu
for he hath look down from the height of hi sanctuari from heaven
did the lord behold the earth
to hear the groan of the prison to loos those that ar appoint
to death
the children of thy servant shall continu and their seed shall be
establish befor thee
hum said leonard to himself the quotat seem veri appropri
if on had faith in omen now a man might sai that thi wa a good
on and in hi heart he believ it to be so
anoth hour journei brought them to the point of the island along
which thei had been travel
ah said otter now i know the path again thi is the right stream
that to the left must be a new on had we taken it we should have lost
our wai and perhap have found it no more for dai or not at all
sai otter said leonard you escap from thi slavecamp how did
you do itin a boat
no baa the baa know that i am strong my spirit who gave me
ugli gave me strength also to make up for it and it is well for
had i been beauti as you ar baa and not veri strong i should
have been a slave now or dead with my chain hand i choke him who
wa set to watch me and took hi knife then by my strength i broke the
ironsse baa here ar the scar of them to thi dai when i broke
them thei cut into my flesh but thei were old iron that had been on
mani slave so i master them then as other came to kill me i threw
myself into the water and dive and thei never saw me more afterward
i swam all the wai rest from time to time on the island and from
time to time run along the shore where the reed were not too thick
till at length i escap into the open countri i travel four dai to
reach it and most of that time i wa in the water
and what did you feed on
root and the egg of bird
and did not the allig try to eat you
ye on baa but i am quick in the water i got upon the
watersnak backah my spirit wa with me thenand i drove the
knife through hi ey into hi brain then i smear myself over with
hi blood and after that thei did not touch me for thei knew the smell
and thought that i wa their brother
sai otter ar you not afraid of go back to thi place
somewhat baa for there is that hell of which you white peopl talk
but where the baa goe there i can go also otter will not linger while
you run also baa i am not brave no no yet i would look upon that
yellow devil again ye if i myself must die to do it and kill him
with these hand
and the dwarf drop the paddl scream kill him kill him kill
him so loudli that the bird rose in affright from the marsh
be quiet said leonard angrili do you want to bring the arab on
us
but to himself he thought that he should be sorri for pereira alia the
yellow devil if onc otter found a chanc to fly at hi throat
chapter ix
the yellow devil nest
sundown came and as on the previou night the three travel
camp upon an island wait for the moon to rise thei had caught two
flapperduck in some weed and there wa a talk of light a fire to
cook them by final leonard negativ thi idea it is danger
he said for fire can be seen from afar so thei made a wretch meal
off a littl dri meat and some raw duck egg
it wa fortun that hi caution prevail sinc as the twilight
wa dy into dark thei heard the stroke of paddl and made out the
shape of cano pass them there were sever cano each of which
tow someth behind it and the men in them shout to on anoth
from time to time now in portugues and now in arab
lie still lie still whisper otter these ar the slavemen take
back the big boat
leonard and soa follow hi advic to the letter and the slaver
paddl furious up stream pass within thirti feet of where thei
crouch in the rush
give wai comrad call on man to the captain of the next cano
the landingplac is near and there is rum for those who earn it
i hope that thei will not stop here said leonard beneath hi breath
hist answer otter i hear them land
he wa right the parti had disembark about two hundr yard awai
present thei heard them collect reed for burn and in ten
minut more two bright tongu of flame show that thei had lit their
fire
we had better get out of thi said leonard if thei discov us
thei will not discov us baa if we lie still answer otter let
us wait awhil i have anoth plan listen baa and he whisper in
hi ear
so thei wait from the fire below them came the sound of men eat
and drinkingespeci drink an hour pass and leonard rose
follow by otter who said
i will come too baa i can move like a cat
where ar you go white man ask soa
i am go to spy upon those men i understand portugues and wish to
hear what thei sai otter take your knife and revolv but no gun
good said the woman but be care thei ar veri clever
ye ye put in otter but the baa is clever also and i i am
clever do not fear for us mother
then thei start creep cautious through the reed when thei were
within twenti yard of the fire leonard miss hi foot and fell
into a pool of water with a splash some of the slavedeal heard
the nois and sprang to their feet instantli otter grunt in exact
imit of a hippopotamuscalf
a seacow said a man in portugues she wont hurt us the fire will
frighten her
leonard and otter wait awhil then crept to a clump of reed whenc
thei could hear everi word that wa spoken the men round the fire
number twentytwo on their leader appear to be a purebr
portuge some of the other were bastard and the rest arab thei were
drink rum and water out of tin pannikinsa great deal of rum and
veri littl water mani of them seem halfdrunk alreadi at ani rate
their tongu were loosen
mai a curs fall upon our father the devil said on a halfbre
why did he take it into hi head to send us back with the boat just

there is none better comrad none better hiccough the leader
then for an hour or more their talk went onpartli about juanna partli
about other thing as thei grew more drunk the convers becam more
and more revolt till leonard could scarc listen to it and lie
still at length it di awai and on by on the men sank into a sound
and sodden sleep thei did not set a sentri for here on the island thei
had no fear of foe
then otter rose upon hi hand and knee and hi face look fierc in
the faint light
baa he whisper shall we and he drew hi hand across hi
throat
leonard thought awhil hi rage wa deep and yet he shrank from the
slaughter of sleep men howev wick besid could it be done
without nois some of them would wakefear would sober them and thei
were mani
no he whisper back follow me we will cut loos the boat
good good said otter
then stealthili as snake thei crept some thirti yard to where the
boat were ti to a low treethre cano and five larg flatbottom
punt contain the arm and provis of the slavedeal draw
their knive thei cut these loos a gentl push set them move then
the current caught them and slowli thei float awai into the night
thi done thei crawl back again their path took them within five
pace of where that halfbre ruffian lai who had begun the talk to
which thei had listen leonard look at him and turn to creep awai
alreadi otter wa five pace ahead when suddenli the edg of the moon
show for the first time and it light fell full upon the slaver
face the sleep man awok sat up and saw them
now leonard dare not hesit or thei were lost like a tiger he
sprang at the man throat and had grasp it in hi hand befor he
could even cry aloud then came a struggl short and sharp and a knife
flash befor otter could get back to hi side it wa doneso swiftli
and so silent that none of the band had waken though on or two of
them stir and mutter in their heavi sleep
leonard sprang up unhurt and togeth thei ran rather than walk
back to the spot where thei had left soa
she wa watch for them and point to leonard coat ask how
mani
on answer otter
i would it had been all soa mutter fierc but you ar onli
two
quick said leonard into the cano with you thei will be after us
present
in anoth minut thei had push off and were clear of the island
which wa not more than a quarter of a mile long thei paddl across
the river which at thi spot ran rapidli and had a width of some eight
hundr yard so as to hide in the shadow of the opposit bank
when thei reach it otter rest on hi paddl and gave vent to a
suppress chuckl which wa hi nearest approach to laughter
why do you laugh black on ask soa
look yonder he answer and he point to some speck on the surfac
of the river which were fast vanish in the distanc yonder go the
boat of the slavedeal and in them ar their arm and food we cut
them loos the baa and i there on the island sleep twoandtwenti
menal save on there thei sleep and when thei wake what will thei
find thei will find themselv on a littl isl in the middl of great
water into which even if thei could thei will not dare to swim
becaus of the allig thei can get no food on the island for
thei have no gun and duck do not stop to be caught but outsid the
allig will wait in hundr to catch them byandbi thei will
grow hungrythei will shout and yell but none will hear themthen
thei will becom mad and fall on each other thei will eat each
other and die miser on by on some will take to the water those
will drown or be caught by the allig and so it shall go on till
thei ar all dead everi on of them dead dead dead and again otter
chuckl
leonard did not reprov him with the talk of these wretch yet echo
in hi ear he could feel littl piti for the horribl fate which would
certainli overtak them
hark a faint sound stole across the quiet water a sound which grew
into a clamour of fear and rage the slaver had awaken thei had
found the dead man in their midst mysteri slain by an invis
foe and now the clamour gather to a yell for thei had learn that
their boat were gone and that thei were trap
from their shelter on the other side of the river as thei drop
leisur down the stream leonard and otter could catch distant
glimps of the frantic men rush to and fro in the bright moonlight
and seek for their boat but the boat had depart to return no
more by degre the clamour lessen behind them till at last it di
awai swallow in the silenc of the night
then leonard told soa what he had heard by the slaver fire
how far is the road black on she ask when he had finish
by sundown tomorrow we shall be at the yellow devil gate answer
otter
two hour later thei overtook the boat which thei had cut adrift most
of them were ti togeth and thei float peacefulli in a group
we had better scuttl them said leonard
no baa answer otter if we escap we mai want them again yonder
is the place where we must land and he point to a distant tongu of
marsh let us go with the boat there and make them fast perhap we
mai find food in them and we need food
the advic wa good and thei follow it keep alongsid of the
punt and direct them when necessari with a push of the paddl
thei reach the point just as the dawn wa break here in a
shelter bai thei found a mooringplac to which thei fasten all the
boat with rope that hung readi then thei search the locker and
to their joi discov food in plenti includ cook meat spirit
biscuit bread and some orang and banana onli those who have been
forc to do without farinac food for dai or week will know what
thi abund meant to them leonard thought that he had never eaten a
more delici meal or drunk anyth so good as the rum and water with
which thei wash it down
thei found other thing also rifl cutlass and ammunit and
better than all a chest of cloth which had evid belong to
the offic or offic of the parti on suit wa a kind of uniform
plentifulli adorn with gold lace have tall boot and a broad felt
hat with a white ostrich feather in it to match also there were some
long arab gown and turban the gala cloth of the slavedeal
which thei took with them in order to appear smart on their return
but the most valuabl find of all wa a leather bag in the breech of
the uniform contain the sum of the honest gain of the leader of
the parti which he had prefer to keep in hi own compani even on
hi travel on examin thi bag wa found to hold someth over a
hundr english sovereign and a dozen or fifteen piec of portugues
gold
now baa said otter thi is my word that we put on these
cloth
what for ask leonard
for thi reason that should we be seen by the slavetrad thei will
think us of their brethren
the advantag of thi step were so obviou that thei immedi
adopt it thu disguis with a silk sash round hi middl and a
pistol stuck in it leonard might well have been mistaken for the most
feroci of slavetrad
otter too look suffici strang robe as an arab and wear a
turban be a dwarf the difficulti wa that all the dress prove
too long for him final it wa found necessari to cut on down by the
primit process of lai it on a block of wood and chop through
it with a sabr
when thi chang of garment had been effect and their own cloth
with the spare arm were hidden awai in the rush on the somewhat
remot chanc that thei might be us hereaft thei prepar for a
start on foot across the marsh by an afterthought leonard fetch the
bag of gold and put it in hi pocket he felt few scrupl in avail
himself of the monei of the slavedriv not for hi own us inde
but becaus it might help their enterpris
now their road ran along marsh and by secret path that none save
those who had travel them could have found but otter had not
forgotten on thei went through the broil heat of the dai sinc
linger thei dare not thei met no live man on their path though here
and there thei found the bodi of some wretch slave whose corps had
been cast into the reed by the roadsid but the road had been trodden
and recent by mani feet among which were the track of two mule or
donkei
at last about an hour befor sunset thei came to the home of the
yellow devil the nest wa place thu it stood upon an island have
an area of ten or twelv acr of thi howev onli about four and
a half acr were avail for a live space the rest wa a morass
hidden by a growth of veri tall reed which morass start from
a great lagoon on the northern and eastern side ran up to the low
enclosur of the build that on these face were consid to be
suffici defend by the swamp and the wide water beyond on the
southern and western aspect of the camp matter were differ for
here the place wa strongli fortifi both by art and natur firstli
a canal ran round these two face not veri wide or deep inde but
impass except in boat ow to the soft mud at it bottom on the
further side of thi canal an earthwork had been construct have
it crest stoutli palisad and it steep side plant with a natur
defenc of alo and pricklypear
so much for the exterior of the place it interior wa divid into
three princip enclosur of these three the easternmost wa the site
of the nest itself a long low thatch build of wood in front and
to the west of which there wa an open space or courtyard with a hard
floor herein were but two build a shed support on post and open
from the eav to the ground where sale of slave were carri on
and further to the north almost continu with the line of the nest
itself but separ from it a small erect veri strongli built
of brick and stone and have a roof made from the tin line
of ammunit and other case thi wa a magazin all round thi
enclosur stood row of straw hut of a nativ build evid occupi
as a camp by the arab and halfbre slavetrad of the baser sort
the second enclosur which wa to the west of the nest compris
the slave camp it mai have cover an acr of ground and the onli
build in it were four low shed similar in everi respect to that
where the slave were sold onli much longer here the captiv lai
picket in row to iron bar which ran the length of the shed and
were fix into the ground at either end thi camp wa separ from
the nest enclosur by a deep canal thirti feet in width and span
at on point by a slender and primit drawbridg that led across the
canal to the gate of the camp also it wa protect on the nest side by
a low wall and on the slavecamp side by an earthwork plant as
usual with pricklypear on thi earthwork near the gate and littl
guardhous a sixpound cannon wa mount the muzzl of which
frown down upon the slave camp a visibl warn to it occup of
the fate that await the froward inde all the defenc of thi part
of the island were devis as safeguard against a possibl emeut of
the slave and also to provid a second line of fortif should
the nest itself chanc to be taken by an enemi
beyond the slave camp lai the garden that could onli be approach
through it thi also wa fortifi by water and earthwork but not so
strongli
such is a brief descript of what wa in those dai the strongest
slavehold in africa
chapter x
leonard make a plan
the road which leonard and hi companion were follow led them to the
edg of the main and southernmost canal debouch exactli opposit the
waterg that gave access to the nest but otter did not ventur to
guid them to thi point for there thei should be seen by the sentri
and notwithstand their masquerad dress awkward question might
be ask which thei could not answer therefor when thei had arriv
within five hundr yard of the gate he struck off to the left into
the thick bush that cloth the hither side of the canal through
thi thei crawl as best thei might till final thei halt near the
water edg almost opposit to the southwest angl of the slave camp
and under the shadow of a dens clump of willow
see baa said the dwarf in a low voic the journei is accomplish
and i have brought you straight yonder is the hous of the yellow
devilnow it remain onli to take it or to rescu the maiden from it
leonard look at the place in dismai how wa it possibl that
theytwo men and a womancould captur thi fortifi camp fill as
it wa with score of the most wick desperado in africa how wa it
possibl even that thei could obtain access to it view from far off
the thing had seem smallto be done somehow but now and yet thei
must do someth or all their labour would be in vain and the poor
girl thei came to rescu must be hand over to her shame fate
or if she chose it in prefer and could compass the deed to
selfmurd
how on earth said leonard aloud then ad well otter i can tell
you on thing i have come a long wai on thi busi and i am not
go to turn my back to it now i have never yet turn my back on a
ventur and i will not begin with thi though i dare sai that my death
li in it
it is all in the hand of tomorrow answer otter but it is time
that we made a plan for the night draw on now baa here is a thick
tree shade by other tree shall we climb it and look down into the
camp
leonard nod and climb the tree with eas thei peep down
through the leafiest of it bough all the camp lai beneath them like
a map and otter cling monkeywis to a branch point out it
detail to leonard he had been a prison there and the memori of
prison ar long
the place wa peopl by number of men in strang costum and of
differ nation dealer in black ivori of variou degre
perhap there mai have been more than a hundr of them some were
stroll about in knot smoke and talk some were gambl other
were go on their busi on groupcaptain to judg from the
rich of their attirewer stand round the armshous and peep
through a grate in the wall which thei reach by sit upon each
other shoulder thi amus last them for some time till at
length a man of whom at that distanc thei could see onli that he wa
old and stout came and drove them awai and thei broke up laugh
that is the yellow devil said otter and those men were look at
the maid who is call the shepherdess she is lock up there until the
hour come for her to be sold thei will be the bidder
leonard made no repli he wa studi the place present a drum wa
beaten and men appear carri larg tin pail of smoke stuff
yonder is the food for the slave said otter again see thei ar
go to feed them
the men with the pail accompani by some of the offic have
sjamboch or hide whip in their hand advanc across the open space
till thei came to the moat which separ the slave camp from the
nest whenc thei call to the sentri on the embank to let down
the drawbridg he obei and thei cross each man with a bucket wa
follow by anoth who bore a wooden spoon while a third behind them
carri water in a larg gourd have come to the first of the open
shed thei began their round the man with the wooden spoon ladl
out portion of the stiff porridg and throw it down upon the ground
befor each slave in turn as food is thrown to a dog then the arab with
the gourd pour water into wooden bowl that the captiv might drink
present there wa a halt and the offic gather togeth to
discuss someth
a slave is sick said otter
the knot separ but a big white man with a hippopotamushid whip
began to strike at a dark thing on the ground which did not seem to
move
the man ceas beat and call aloud then two of the arab went to
the littl guardhous that wa by the drawbridg and brought tool
with which thei loos the fetter on the limb of the poor
creatureappar a womanthu free her from the long iron bar
thi done some of the offic saunter after them thei drag
the bodi to the high enclosur of earth and up a short ladder have a
wooden platform at the top of it that overhung the deep canal below
thi is how the yellow devil buri hi dead and cure hi sick said
otter
i have seen enough answer leonard and began to descend the tree
hastili an exampl which otter follow with more composur
ah baa he said when thei reach the ground you ar but a
chicken the heart of those who have dwelt in slave camp ar strong
and after all better the belli of a fish than the hold of a slave
dhow wow who do these thing is it not the white men your
brother and do thei not sai mani prayer to the great man up in the
sky while thei do them
be still said leonard and give me some brandi he wa in no mood
to discuss the bless of civilis as thei have often been put
into practic in africa and to think that thi fate might soon be hi
own
leonard drank the brandi and sat awhil in silenc push up hi beard
with hi hand and gaze into the gather gloom with hi hawklik
ey thu he had sat besid hi dy brother bed it wa a pose that
he adopt unconsci when lost in thought
come soa he said at length we have travel here to pleas you
now give us the benefit of your suggest how ar we go to get
your mistress out of that camp
loos the slave and let them kill their master soa answer
lacon
i doubt there is not much pluck in slave said leonard
there should be fifti of mavoom men there she repli and thei
will fight well enough if thei have arm
then leonard look at otter seek further idea
my snake put it into my head said the dwarf that fire is a good
friend when men ar few and foe ar mani also that the reed yonder
ar dry and the sea wind rise and will blow hard befor midnight
moreov all these hous ar thatch and in a wind fire jump but
can a regiment have two gener you ar our captain baa speak and
we will do your bid here on counsel is as good as anoth let
fate speak through your mouth
veri well said leonard thi is my plan it goe a littl further
than your that is all we must gain entranc to the nest while it is
still dark befor the moon rise i know the watchword devil and
disguis as we ar perhap the sentri will let us pass unquest
if not we must kill him and silent
good said otter but how about the woman here
we will leav her hidden in the bush she could be of no help in the
camp and might hinder us
no white man broke in soa where you go i go also moreov my
mistress is yonder and i would seek her
as you like answer leonard then went on we must get between
the hut there is onli on and the low wall that border the canal
separ the nest from the slave camp and if the drawbridg is up
and no other mean can be found we must swim the dike dispos of the
sentri there also and gain the slave camp then we must try to free some
of the slave and send them round through the garden into the morass to
fire the reed should the wind blow strong enough meanwhil i propos
to walk boldli into the camp salut pereira pass myself off as a
slaver with a dhow at the mouth of the river and sai that i have come
to bui slave and abov all to bid for the white girl luckili we have
a good deal of gold that is my plan so far as it goe the rest we must
leav to chanc if i can bui the shepherdess i will if not i must try
to get her off in some other wai
so be it baa and now let us eat for we shall need all our strength
tonight then we will go down to the landingplac and take our
chanc
thei at of the food thei had with them and drank sparingli of the
slavedeal brandi sai littl the while for the shadow of what
wa to come lai upon them even the phlegmat and fatalist otter wa
depress perhap becaus of the associ of the place which
for him were pain perhap becaus of the magnitud of their
undertak never had he known such a tale never had he seen such an
adventur as thisthat two men and an old woman should attack an arm
camp inde although he wa not acquaint with the sai otter
feel would have been correctli sum up in the wellknown phrase
cest magnifiqu mai ce nest pa la guerr
as yet the night wa intens dark and it gloom did not tend to
improv their spirit also as otter had predict the wind wa rise
and sough through the reed and willow in melancholi note
so the time pass till it wa nine oclock
we must move down to the landingplac said leonard there will soon
be some light enough for us to work by
then otter took the lead and slowli step by step thei crept back
to the road and follow it down the shore of the canal opposit the
waterg here wa a place where boat and cano were ti both for
conveni in cross the canal to and from the camp and for the us
of the slavedeal when thei pass to the secret harbour six mile
awai where the dhow embark their cargo
thei wait awhil from the nest came the sound of revelri and from
the slave camp there rose other sound the voic of groan broken by
an occasion wail wrung out of the miseri of some lost creatur who lai
there in torment gradual the sky brighten a littl
perhap we had better be make a start said leonard there is a
cano which will serv our turn
befor the word were out of hi mouth thei heard the splash of oar
and a boat crept past them and made fast to the waterg twenti yard

the sound of a blow and a heavi splash thei hearken on but noth
more wa to be heard except the beat of their heart and the distant
nois of revelri from the camp
three second pass and otter stood besid them in the dim light
leonard could see that hi ey stare wide and hi nostril twitch
quick wa the blow strong wa the blow silent is the man for ever
whisper otter so the baa command so it is
chapter xi
that hero otter
help me to secur the gate said leonard present
in anoth minut the great iron bar had been drop into it place
and leonard withdrew the kei and put it in hi pocket
why do you secur the door baa whisper otter
to keep the real pierr out in case he should come thi wai two
pierr would be on too mani at thi game now we must win or perish
then thei crept along the embank till thei gain the shelter of the
hut or barracksh which stood with it back to the dike that separ
the nest from the slave camp happili none saw them and there were no
dog in the place dog make a nois at inconveni time therefor
slavedeal do not love them
the end of the shed behind which thei were crouch wa situat some
eight or ten pace from the drawbridg that form the onli path of
entri to the slave camp
baa said otter let me go forward and look my ey ar the ey of
a cat i can see in the dark perhap the bridg is down
without wait for an answer he crept forward on hi hand and knee
so quietli that thei could scarc hear a movement notwithstand hi
white dress there wa littl chanc of hi be seen for the shadow
of the shed wa dens and a fring of rush grew along the edg of the
dike
five minut passedten minut pass and otter did not return
leonard anxieti grew veri keen
let us go and see what happen mother he whisper to soa
thei crept along to the end of the shed within a yard of it thei
discov the arm and cloth of otter but otter where wa he
the black on ha desert us said soa beneath her breath
never answer leonard
by now the cloud were break befor the wind which wa rise
steadili and some star shone out give a littl light the dike lai
deep between it bank and wa not more than twenti feet in width so
that the air did not ruffl it moreov as ani observ of natur will
have notic the surfac of still water is never quit dark even on
much blacker night than thi
why had otter taken off hi cloth leonard wonder evid that
he might go into the water and what could he want to go into the water
for unless it wa that hi heart fail him and as soa suggest he
had desert but thi wa imposs for he knew well that the dwarf
would die first in hi great perplex leonard stare at the dike
now he could see that on it further side rose a flight of wooden step
protect at the top by gate and that a man wa seat on the lowest
step with a rifl besid him hi feet hang down to within a few
inch of the surfac of the dike it must be the sentri
next instant leonard saw someth els beneath the feet of the man a
rippl grew on the face of the deep water and someth gleam in the
rippl like to the flash of steel then a small black object project
itself toward the feet of the sentri who wa half asleep and hum
to himself drowsili suddenli he saw the man slide from hi seat as
though by magic he said noth but make on ineffectu grasp at
some rush he vanish into the deep below for a minut or more
leonard could distinguish a slight disturb on the surfac of the
water and that wa all
now he guess what had happen otter had dive and rise beneath
the feet of the man he seiz him and with a sudden movement drag
him down to death by drown either thi or an allig had taken
him and that flash wa the flash of hi fang
as leonard thought thu a dark form rose gasp at the foot of the
step it drew itself out of the water and slip stealthili up them
it wa otter and he held a knife in hi hand now the dwarf vanish
through the gate into the littl guardhous at the top of the
embank anoth minut and rope began to creak then the tall
drawbridg stand upright like a scaffold against the sky wa seen

i dont know much of cannon said leonard doubtfulli
but i know someth white man said soa speak for the first
time mavoom my master ha a small on up at the settlement and
often i have help to fire it for practic and as a signal to boat on

a path ran along the top of the embank to the platform on which the
gun wa mount it wa a sixpound muzzleload leonard unhook
the rammer and ran it down the muzzl
she is load he said now let us swing her round
thei did so easili enough bring the muzzl down upon the nest camp
then thei enter the littl hut which stood alongsid pile up in it
in case of emerg were halfadozen round of grapeshot and powder

never occur to those gentlemen that a gun can shoot two wai and
now otter lead us to the slave quick

guardhut i suppos
so thei crept back to the hut hold their head as low as possibl
for the light wa increas although the moon wa not yet up and thei
fear lest thei should be seen against the skylin here thei found
box contain nipper chisel and other instrument such as ar

padlock that lock the iron bar to which the captiv were tether
take a lantern with them but leav anoth burn as befor in the
hut lest it absenc should excit suspicion thei pass through two
strong gate and down the step on the further side of the embank a
few pace beyond stood the first slavesh a rough erect support
on post but without side
thei enter the shed otter lead the wai with the lantern in the
middl of it wa a path and on either side of thi path ran the long
bar to which the captiv were fasten in a doubl row perhap there
might have been two hundr and fifti of them in thi shed here the
sight and scene were such as need not be describ of the miser
captiv some lai on the wet ground men and women togeth try to
forget their sorrow in sleep but the most part of them were awak and
the sound of moan ran up and down their line like the moan of tree
in the wind
when thei saw the light the slave ceas moan and crouch upon the
ground like dog that await the whip for thei thought that thi wa
a visit from their captor some of them inde stretch out their
manacl hand implor piti but these were the except the most
of them had abandon hope and were sunk in dull despair it wa piti
to see the glanc of their terrorfil ey and the answer quiver
of their weal frame whenev an arm wa lift or a sudden movement
made
soa went down the line rapidli examin the face of the slave
do you see ani of mavoom peopl ask leonard anxious
not here white man let us go to the next shed unless you want to
loos these
no good in that mother said otter thei would onli betrai us
so thei went to the next shedin all there were fourand here at the
second man who wa sleep hi head bow on hi chain hand soa
stop suddenli like a pointer dog when he scent game

the man cri aloud and began to trembl but the other slave took no
notic think onli that he had been smitten with a scourg
be silent said soa again or we ar lost loos the bar black on

soon the bar wa undon then otter bade peter hold out hi wrist while
he twist off the fetter present thei were gone and in the ecstasi
of hi recov liberti the man leap high into the air then fell at
otter feet as though he would embrac them

of the men of mavoom here show them to us quick or you will soon be
fast again
there should be forti or more peter answer recov himself
besid a few women and children the rest of us ar dead except the
shepherdess alon and she is yonder
then thei went down the line slip the chain from the settlement

and other stood round them with their hand still chain as thei went
about the work soa explain someth of the posit to peter who wa
fortun a nativ of intellig he grasp the situat at onc
and earnestli second leonard effort to preserv silenc and to
prevent confus

be off you can loos the rest at your leisur the moon is rise it
is a quarter to twelv and we have not a moment to lose now otter
befor we go how can we send men to fire the reedsthrough the
garden
no baa i have thought of a better wai the wai by which i escap
myselfthat is if these men can swim
thei can all swim said soa thei were bred on the bank of a river
good then thei must swim down the dike where i kill the sentri four
of them at the end ar bar of wood but in my dai thei were rotten
at the worst thei can be climb then thei will find themselv in the
morass among thick reed but thei must not fire these till thei
have work round to the place of the sunris whenc the wind blow
strongli then thei must go from spot to spot and bend down the driest
of the reed set fire to them afterward thei can get to the back
of the fire and wait till all is done on wai or the other if we win
thei will find us if we ar kill thei can try to run awai but will
the men go
soa step forward and chose four of their number but peter she did
not choos for he also knew someth of the work of cannon
listen she said you have heard the word of thi black on now
obei and if you depart from them by on jot mai and she pour
out so fear a curs upon them that leonard stare at her astonish
ay ad otter and if i live through thi i will cut your throat
no need to threaten said on of the men we will do our best for
our own sake as well as for your and that of the shepherdess we
understand the plan but to light reed we must have fire
here ar match said otter
wet match will not light and we must swim answer the spokesman
fool do you then swim with your head under water tie them in your
hair

the back of them farewel my children and if you dare to fail prai
that you mai die rather than look upon my face again
ou we have seen it onc is that not enough answer the
spokesman look at otter huge nose with wonder not untouch by
fear
two minut later the four men were swim swiftli down the dike
take their chanc of the allig
drop the bridg said leonard we must start
otter lower it at the same time explain it mechan which wa
veri simpl to soa peter and some of the other settlement men

there wa nobodi in thi hut but look between the post upon which

come on otter whisper leonard we must go among these gentri
watch me close do what i do keep your weapon readi and if it come
to blow get behind my back and fight like a fiend abov all dont be
taken prison
leonard spoke calmli but hi heart wa in hi mouth and hi sensat
were such as must have been known to daniel when he went into the lion
den for as in the case of the prophet he felt that noth short of
a special provid could save them thei were round the shed now
and immedi in front of them wa a mix gather of
desperadoesportugues arab bastard and black men of variou
tribessuch as leonard had never seen in all hi experi
villaini and greed were written on everi counten it wa a crew of
human demon and an extens on these wretch most of whom had
alreadi drunk too freeli and were drink more stood with their back

that night at the apex and though he knew it not the conclus of
hi long career of infami he wa old perhap seventi hi hair wa

of avoid the face of ani person with whom he chanc to be in

as hi sobriquet suggest the colour of pereira flesh wa yellow
and the loos skin hung in huge wrinkl upon hi cheek hi mouth wa
larg and coars and hi fat hand twitch and grasp continu as
though with a desir of clutch monei for the rest he wa gorgeous
dress and like hi companion somewhat in liquor
such wa the outward appear of pereira the fountainhead of the
slavetrad on thi part of the coast who wa believ in hi dai to
be the veri worst man in africa a preemin to which few can hope to
attain until hi face had been seen stamp as it wa with the trace
of long and unmention wicked few honest men could guess to what
depth human can sink some inde have declar that to see him wa
to understand the evil on and all hi work

as leonard spoke thu glanc to the east he saw dens mass of
vapour rise into the air far awai the damp reed were fire at last
the settlement men had not fail in their task and soon the flame
would be discov he must be gone and swiftli
well if you must you must answer pereira and leonard observ
that he look reliev as he said it he did not know the reason at the
time it wa thi juanna had told him that the man who bought her
would find hi death in it he had a superstiti fear of the girl and
believ her therefor he wa glad that her purchas should go lest
it might be said that he had murder him in order to retain both the
woman and her price so he bade him farewel and leonard turn to
depart follow by otter and juanna whom he led by the hand
all might have gone well for that time had it not been for an unlucki
chanc leonard scheme wa to walk toward the waterg but if no
better plan of reach it should offer to turn suddenli and run for
the drawbridg where soa and the other would be wait and thenc
with or without the peopl of mavoom to escap up the bank of the
zambesi
alreadi he had start when the great portugues xavier who wa
watch plung in sullen thought step forward at least i will
have a kiss for my troubl he said and seiz juanna round the
waist he drew her toward him
then it wa that leonard forgot hi caution as under such circumst
a man with nerv alreadi strain to break point well might do
doubl hi fist he struck the giant in the face with such forc that
xavier fell headlong to the ground drag juanna after him leonard
would have done better had he suffer her to be insult but just then
he rememb onli that he wa protect a helpless girl
juanna wa up in a moment and at hi side xavier also sprang to hi
feet curs with furi and draw hi sabr as he rose
follow me said leonard to juanna and otter then without more ado he
took to hi heel
a shout of laughter went up from the mob

strike unawar and is afraid to fight nor did thei stop at word
all of them were jealou of the stranger and would have rejoic to see
him dead
stop him thei shout and mani of the men start run like dog
to turn a hare
still leonard might have won through for he wa swift of foot but
neither juanna nor otter could run so fast as he and hi pace must
be their pace befor he had gone a hundr yard he found himself
confront by a dozen or more of the slaver some of whom had knive in
their hand
stop coward stop and fight thei yell in portugues and arab
wave their weapon in hi face
certainli answer leonard wheel round and glanc about him
there not thirti yard awai wa the drawbridg of the slave camp and
he thought that he saw it trembl as if it wa about to fall at hi

now xavier wa upon him with a rush he struck furious and leonard
avoid the blow spring backward out of hi reach twice more he
rush on thu and twice he smote but each time leonard ran backward
toward the drawbridg that now wa not more than twenti yard awai
a fourth time the portuge came on and the englishman could not repeat
hi tactic for the mob hem him in behind on sped xavier and smote
hi hardest leonard saw the steel gleam in the moonlight and lift hi
sword to guard the blow fell fire sprang from it in spark and down
rattl fragment of shatter steel hi sword wa broken
fight on baa said the voic of otter fight on both sword have
gone
leonard look up it wa true the portuge wa cast asid hi
broken weapon and clutch at hi knife now leonard had no knife and
at the moment he never thought of hi revolv but he still held the
hilt of hi sword and with it he sprang straight at xavier who rush
to meet him
thei met with a dull shock as bull meet bull leonard struck on blow
with the broken swordhilt then drop itit wa useless but the
stroke did him good servic for fall on the right hand of the
portuge it paralys hi arm for a second caus him to let fall the
dagger then thei grip each other fight desper with their
nake strength alon twice the huge portuge lift the englishman
from the ground strive to throw him while the crowd yell with
excit but twice he fail not for noth had leonard learnt
wrestl as a lad and harden hi iron muscl by year of toil
xavier mai have weigh sixteen stone and leonard did not weigh
thirteen but hi arm were like bar of steel and he wa struggl for
dear life
he wait awhil let the portuge exhaust himself in effort to
hurl him to the ground then suddenli tighten hi grip leonard put
out all hi strength he could not hope to lift the man that he knew
but he might throw him with a sudden movement he hook hi right leg
behind xavier left calf then he cast hi weight forward and push
with all hi strength upon the great man breast
xavier totter recov himself totter again and strove to shift
hi leg leonard felt the movement and met it with a suprem effort
lose hi balanc hi foe swai slowli backward like a fall tree
then fell with a thud that shook the ground it wa a gallant throw and
even the rank of tusculum as repres by the slavedriv could
scarc forbear to cheer now leonard lai upon the breast of the man
for he wa drag to earth with him
for a moment hi enemi wa still breath stertor for the shock
of their fall had been great leonard look round there some eight
feet awai wa the knife and he who could grasp it must win thi deadli
game but how could he grasp it xavier whose strength and power
were come back still hug him in hi fear grip he also saw the
knife and would win it rapidli by instinct almost leonard measur
the distanc with hi ey there wa but on plan to roll to it the
first roll would leav him undermost but the dagger would still be out
of xavier reach then could he succe in turn him upon hi back
onc more leonard would be uppermost again and if he wa abl to free
hi hand it might grasp the weapon it wa a terribl risk but he
must take it he lai motionless awhil husband hi forc and the
portuge surg and heav beneath him he could feel the muscl of hi
mighti frame start up in knot as he struggl at last leonard let
him have hi wai and over thei went the two of them now xavier wa
uppermost and the mob yell in triumph for thei thought that the
stranger strength wa spent

forward to give it to him but otter wa watch and start out of the
press nake sabr in hand hi fierc and ugli face wa twitch with
excit hi black ey shone and hi vast shoulder work to and
fro to juanna fascin by the fear struggl the dwarf look
like some black gnome like a thing of supernatur power half toad
half human
he who touch the knife di he said in guttur arab stretch
hi long arm and sabr over it let these cock fight it out my
master
the man shrank back he also wa afraid of otter deem him uncanni
nor did ani other interfer
now came the moment of death or victori as he could not reach the
weapon with a sudden movement xavier freed hi right hand and grasp
the englishman throat but to do thi he must lessen the pressur on
hi breast leonard felt the grip and the knowledg that hi end wa
at hand renew hi power twice he writh like a snake grip the
ground with the muscl of hi back and leg onc he swung hi frame to
the right then a vast effort and lo xavier turn slowli over like a
log of wood and again leonard lai upon hi breast
leonard lai upon hi breast and hi right arm wa free and within reach
of the dagger but the giant grasp of hi throat wa cruel the blood
drum in hi ear and hi sens began to fail no he would not die
thu and leav the girl helpless where wa it he wa blind he could
see noth but her white face he must get freeah he knew now
thei thought that he wa spent see hi head fell when suddenli he
lift himself and heav up hi arm
crash it came full on the forehead of xavier that in it turn wa
pillow on the stoni earth the grip slacken crash again a fear
and despair blow leonard throat wa free and the air rush into
hi burst lung now he could see and grasp the knife but there
wa no need to us it the great man beneath him flung hi arm wide
shiver and grew still
then it wa while men paus wonder at those aw blow that
juanna mind of her deliver bid turn and fled sick at
heart but unhind to the edg of the ditch opposit the drawbridg
otter also rush up and drag leonard from the ground
wow he cri a good fight and a great blow dead by my mother

leonard heard hi word dimli and knew their import with an effort he
ceas to stagger and rest hi weight upon the dwarf much as a man
might lean upon some sturdi post hi breath came back to him and hi
mind clear he look round and saw juanna stand near the bridg
like on who hesit whether to fly or stai
sir gasp leonard i have fought and i have won now let me go in

the slaver look at leonard with aw not unmix with admir who
had ever seen such a thing that on whose strength had been a byword

thei ar mad baa cri otter who wa watch the enemi over the
top of the embank see thei ar come across the open
leonard look the dwarf wa right in their rage and hurri the
slaver half hidden in a cloud of smoke caus by their rapid fire
were advanc across the clear space instead of creep along the edg
of the dike what wa more the necess of carri the plank caus
them to pack in group soa gave a final twist with her lever and
wait her hand on the lanyard a bullet cut it in two but without

now for it cri leonard as the first parti came into the line of
fire
soa sprang backward with a yell again the piec thunder out and the
canist scream through the air it tore along the advanc file
then strike the beaten earth rebound and caught those who were
follow with the ricochet and with aw effect whole group were
mow down by thi on discharg the destruct be twice as larg

fear and furi
load up load up cri otter lift the charg of powder which lai

will cut us off
as he spoke thei saw mani men run from the auctionsh to the
waterg but it could not be climb the kei wa gone and the
massiv bolt and beam were not easi to break so thei brought hammer
and a treetrunk which had support an angl of the shed and batter
at the gate for two minut or more it held then it began to give
swift swift cri otter again as he drag at the cannon to turn
it or all will yet be lost
hurri no man ox black on said soa as she laid the gun with the
help of peter
a cry went up from the slaver the gate wa totter but it still
held by the upper hing a few more blow and it must sure fall but
those blow were never struck again soa sprang backward and the roar
of the gun wa answer by the scream of the slaver as the shrapnel
plough through them
of those who were left the most part fled for shelter to the auctionhut
and to the nest itself some ran across to the magazin but appear to
be unabl to enter it for soon thei were seen fly back again while
about a dozen of the boldest remain at the gate try to complet it
destruct on these leonard and otter open fire with rifl but
it wa not until three or four of them had fallen that the rest fled to
join their companion beneath the shelter of the shed
oh look look said juanna point to the east
it wa inde a spectacl never to be forgotten
the dens reed measur twelv to fifteen feet in height had been
fire far to the east of the nest and as the wind gather to a gale
and the fire got firmer hold it roll down upon the doom place in
billow and sheetsa sea of flame that sometim spout high into the
air and sometim ran swiftli along the ground
the reed crackl and roar like musketri as the fire at into them
give out thick volum of smoke at first thi smoke had pass abov
the spectat now it blew into their face half choke them and
blot out the sky and mix up with it were shower of spark and
fragment of burn reed brought forward on the wind
the hous and shed will soon catch now said leonard then thei must
take refug in the open space where we can deal with them and he
nod toward the gun
as he spoke tongu of flame dart into the air first from the thatch
of the shed then from the roof of the nest thei were afir
we must be care baa said otter or the slaveshelt behind us
will burn also and all those in them

you wish to do a good work take some of these peopl and the bucket
thei us to water the slave let three or four men get on to each roof
and extinguish the spark as thei fall while other bring them water
from the moat
the priest sprang up and set to the task at which he labour gallantli
for two long hour had it not been for hi effort the shed and the
slave in them must have been burnt for the spark fell thick upon the
dry thatch which caught again and again
now the sight and sound grew more and more fear madden with
fear the remaind of the slavedriv and their servant rush from
the flame build strive to escap from the fire some flung
themselv desper into the alo and pricklypear on the inner
rampart and climb the palisad beyond escap into the marsh
while some collect on the open space and at these the gun wa fire
from time to time when the smoke lift other again ran to the dike of
the slave camp beg for merci there to be shot by otter who never
weari in hi task of reveng from behind them also rose the hideou
cri of the slave who believ that thei were about to be burn
aliv and scream as thei drag at their manacl
oh it is like hell said juanna to leonard as she buri her face
in the grass that she might see no more and to escap the suffoc
smoke she wa right
so the time went on on by on the roof of the variou build fell
in and spout of flame shot high into the air to descend about them
in a rain of spark but at last the cri ceas for even the slave
could yell no more the fire grew less and less and the wind drop
then the sun rose on the scene of death and desol the morass
wa swept bare to the depth of mani hundr yard and the camp wa a
smoke ruin strewn with the dead the wall of the nest still stood
howev and here and there a char post remain everyth els wa

onc more it wa morn and the travel were encamp by that reedi
point where thei had left the big boat which thei cut loos from the
island from the earliest dawn leonard had been superintend the
transport across the river of the hundr of slave whom thei had
releas thei there were put on shore by the settlement men provid
with a store of meal and left to shift for themselv it be found
utterli imposs to take them ani further
there thei ar gone said otter as the last boatload set out under
the charg of peter well let them go the silli sheep so much the
less troubl for us who although we have a shepherdess can scarc
lead so larg a flock well we have pull the missi yonder out of the
slave nest and the yellow devilah we have talk with him and all
hi crew and now ar we to go on to win the goldth real yellow
devil baa
i suppos so otter answer leonardthat is if soa keep her
word but it isnt gold it is rubi at ani rate we must make for the
settlement below sena to take these men back and see if we can hear
anyth of mavoom
so said otter after a paus well the shepherdess as these
settlement peopl call her will want to find her father sai baa she
is proud is she not she look over our head and speak littl
ye otter she is proud
and she is beauti no woman wa ever so beauti
ye otter she is beauti
and she is cold baa she doe not sai thank you nice for all that
you have done
perhap she think it the more otter
perhap she think it the more still she might sai thank you to
you baa who ar herhusband
what do you mean by that
i mean baa that you bought her first accord to our custom and
marri her afterward accord to your own and if that doe not make
her your wife noth can
stop that fool talk said leonard angrili and never let me hear
you repeat it it wa onli a game that we plai
as the baa desir so be it i do but speak from my heart when i sai
that she is your wife and some might think that not so ill for she is
fair and clever will the baa rise and come to the river to bath that
hi sore mai leav him
leonard took the suggest and came back from hi bath a new man for
rest and the cold water had act on him like magic he wa still stiff
inde and remain lame in on leg for ten dai or more but with the
except of an ach of the throat where xavier had grip him no
other ill effect were left among the booti of the slave camp wa
a good suppli of cloth flannel shirt corduroi suit and hat
cast asid the rag of the portugues uniform in which he had
disguis himself leonard put on some of these articl and reappear
in the camp dress like an ordinari english colonist roughli inde
but becomingli
meanwhil juanna had also been make her toilet with the help of
soa who took thi opportun to tell her mistress the histori of her
meet with leonard outram but either from design or becaus she
forgot to do so she did not at thi time tell her about the agreement
which had been enter into between them as yet soa had never spoken
fulli to her mistress of her earli life or of the mysteri peopl of
the mist from whom she sprang though she had taught her the languag
thei spoke perhap for reason of her own she did not think thi a
favour occas on which to begin the stori
when soa had finish juanna fell into a reveri she rememb that
she had express no gratitud to mr outram for hi heroic rescu of
her yet in her heart she wa grate enough but for him she must now
have been dead and the world of light and love would have close it
gate upon her for ever still mix up with her gratitud and earnest
admir of the deed of heroism which had been wrought for her sake
wa anoth feel a feel of resent and alarm thi stranger
thi dark keenei resolut man had bought her as a slave more he
had gone through a form of marriag with her that wa not all a form
for it had been solemnli celebr by a priest and there on her finger
wa the memori of it of cours it meant noth but the thought of
it anger her and offend her pride
like other women juanna rodd had not come to twenti year of ag
without dream of love and strang to sai her fanci had alwai
chosen some such man as leonard for the hero of the stori but that the
hero should present himself in thi ultrahero fashion that he should
bui her with gold that he should go through a form of marriag with
her within an hour of their first meetingfor these thing she had
not bargain it wa a factthat marriag wa an accomplish fact
although it might be null and void and the femal mind ha a great
respect for accomplish fact to a woman of juanna somewhat haughti
natur thi wa veri gall alreadi she felt it to be so and as
time went on the chain of it remembr irk her more and more a
circumst which account for much of her subsequ conduct
think such thought as these juanna stroll back toward the camp
along a littl pathwai in the reed and suddenli came face to face with
leonard she wa clad in a white arab robe part of the loot which she
had adapt cleverli to the purpos of a dress fasten it round her
slender waist with an embroid scarf she wore no hat and her rich
dark hair wa twist into a great knot that shone in the sunlight in
her hand she held some crimson lili which she had gather that made
a spot of colour on the white of her dress the look of haunt
terror wa gone from her face whose beauti had come back dure her
sleep her chang ey shone beneath their dark lash and she move
with the grace of a fawn
seen thu in that pure and pearli light against the green background
of the feather reed noth could have seem more sweet and love
than did thi girl thi child of the forest and the river who mingl
in herself the differ beauti of the saxon and the spaniard ripen
by the african sun and dignifi by the long companionship of natur
there wa a grace about her movement a puriti in her face a mysteri
in the wide ey and curv and smile lip such as leonard had never
seen befor and which overcam him utterli ala for the fickl of
the human heart from that moment the ador of hi youth the dream
of hi lone year of wander jane beach began to grow faint
and fade awai but though thi wa so as yet he did not admit it to
himself inde he scarc knew it
juanna look up and saw him stand befor her proud and handsom
an air of command upon hi thought face deepchest beard
vigor a man amongst men she saw the admir in hi ey and
blush know that do what she would to prevent it it wa reflect
in her own she rememb all that thi stranger had done for her how
he had risk hi life a hundr time how she would now have been
dead and unlov were it not for hi intrepid deed and rememb
someth stir at her heart
wa it gratitud that move her thu she did not know but whatev it
wa she turn her head that he might not read it on her face anoth
moment and she wa hold out her hand to him and smile pleasantli
good morn she said i hope that you have slept well and that you
have no bad new
i spent eight hour in a state of absolut stupor he answer
laugh and there is no new at all to speak of except that i have
got rid of those slave poor creatur i fanci that our friend the
slavedeal yonder have had enough of our compani and ar scarc
like to follow us
juanna turn a shade paler and answer
i trust so at least i have had enough of them by the wai mr outram
iihav to thank you for a great deal here her ey caught the
gleam of the gold circlet on the third finger of her left handthi
ring belong to you i will return it at onc
miss rodd said leonard grave we have pass through a veri
strang adventur togeth will you not keep the ring in remembr of
it
her strong impuls wa to refus while she wore thi ring the thought
of that hate scene and still more hate mockeri of marriag would
be alwai with her and yet as the word of prompt refus were on
her lip a feel an instinct almost a superstit caus them
to remain unspoken you ar veri kind she said but thi is your
signetringi not that what you call it you cannot wish to give it to
a chanc acquaint
ye it is my signetr and if you will look at the crest and motto
you will see that thei ar not inappropri and i do wish to give it
even to a chanc acquaint miss rodd if you will allow me no more
intim term
i have look at them she answer as she examin the ring
curious it wa of plain and somewhat massiv gold and deepli cut
into the shieldfac bezel wa the outram crest a hand hold a drawn
sword beneath which the motto wa engrav what is the last word of
the motto she went on it is so rub that i cannot read itfor
home honour
and heart said leonard
juanna blush though why the word heart should make her blush she
knew not
well i will wear the ring if you wish it mr outram in memori
of our adventurethat is until you ask it back again she said
confusedli then ad with a chang of tone there is on detail
of the adventur that i hope you will not allud to more than you can
avoid for the recollect of it is most pain to me probabl more
so even than to you
i suppos you mean the ceremoni of marriag miss rodd
i mean the wick and abomin farc in which we were made to plai
a part she answer passion most of the wit of that
shame scene ar dead and cannot speak of it and if you will keep
your servant the dwarf silent i will do the same by father francisco
let it be forgotten by both of us
certainli miss rodd said leonard that is if anyth so strang
can be forgotten and now will you come to breakfast
she bow her head in assent and swept past him the red lili in her
hand
i wonder what hold she ha over that priest thought leonard to
himself that she talk of be abl to keep him silent by the wai
i must find out whether we ar to have the pleasur of hi compani i
would rather be without him myself a strang girl on can account for
her beauti she inherit that but it is difficult to understand the
manner by right she should be a halfwild hoyden but i never saw an
english ladi with more grace and digniti perhap i have forgotten
it is so long sinc i associ with ladi or perhap like beauti
these ar natur to her after all her father seem to have been a
gentleman of birth and peopl who live with natur mai have everi
fault in the calendar but thei cannot be vulgar that is the gift of
civilis
when he reach the camp leonard found the priest talk
confidenti to juanna
by the wai father he said somewhat brusqu as you see i have
got rid of those slave it wa imposs to take them with us and now
thei must shift for themselv at ani rate thei ar better off than
thei were yonder what ar your plan you have behav well to us but
i cannot forget that we found you in bad compani perhap you wish to
return to it and in that case your wai li eastward and he nod
toward the nest
i do not wonder that you distrust me senor said francisco hi
pale and girlish face colour as he spoke for appear ar much
against me but i assur you that although i came into the compani of
antonio pereira by my own will it wa for no evil purpos to be brief
senor i had a brother who fled hither from portug becaus of a crime
that he had commit and join pereira band with much toil i
track him out and wa welcom at the nest becaus i am a priest
who can comfort the sick and shrive the dy for wicked doe not
consol men at the last senor i persuad my brother to return with
me and we made a plan to escap but pereira ear were long we were
betrai and my brother wa hang thei did not hang me becaus of
my call afterward i wa kept a prison and forc to accompani
the band in their expedit that is all the stori now with your
permiss i will follow you for i have no monei and nowher els to
go in thi wilder though i fear that i am not strong enough to be
of much servic and be of anoth faith you will scarc need my
ministr
veri well father answer leonard coldli but pleas understand
that we ar still surround by mani danger which ani treacheri
might caus to overwhelm us therefor i warn you that should i detect
anyth of the sort my answer to it will be a quick on
i do not think that you need suspect the father mr outram said
juanna indignantli i ow him a great deal had it not been for hi
kind and counsel i should not be aliv todai i am most deepli
grate to him
if you vouch for him miss rodd that is enough you have had the
advantag of a closer acquaint than i can boast leonard
answer grave mental contrast the differ of her manner in
acknowledg the priest servic and hi own
from that hour till a certain convers open hi ey struggl
as he would against it leonard dislik francisco he had a foolish
british avers to hi class and juanna mark partial toward
thi particular individu did not lessen it in thi instanc prejudic
is a strong thing and when it is heighten by suspicion and jealousi
especi jealousi of the unacknowledg kind it becom formid
both to him who entertain it and to him against whom it is entertain
when their meal wa done thei proceed up the river in the boat which
thei had captur from the slaver each boat be row by the best
oarsmen among the settlement men includ women and children their
parti number some sixti soul at even thei pass the island where
thei had left the compani of slaver but could see no sign of life upon
it and never learn whether the men perish or escap
an hour later thei encamp upon the bank of the river and it wa while
thei were sit round the fire at night that juanna told leonard of
the horror which she had undergon dure her dread sojourn with the
slave caravan she told him also how she had torn leav from the
bibl which she chanc to have with her and fix them upon the reed
whenev she could find an opportun of so do in the hope that
thei might guid her father should he return and attempt her rescu
it is all like a nightmar she said and as for that hideou farc
of marriag with which it end i can scarc bear to think of it
then francisco who had been sit silent spoke for the first time
you speak senora he said in hi subdu voic of that hideou
farc of marriag and i suppos you mean the ceremoni which i
perform between you and the senor outram be forc to the act by
pereira it is my duti to tell you both that howev irregular thi
marriag mai have been i do not believ it to be a farc i believ
that you ar lawfulli man and wife until death shall part you unless
inde the pope should annul the union as he alon can do
nonsens nonsens broke in leonard you forget that there wa
no consent that we ar of anoth religion and that the form wa
necessari to our plot
the church know noth of the reason which lead to the undertak
of wedlock francisco answer mildli thei ar variou and mani of
them would not bear investig but you were marri without ani open
protest on your part on portugues territori accord to portugues
custom and by a duli qualifi priest the fact that you ar of the
protest religion and were unit by the cathol ritual doe
not matter at all for the purpos of the ceremoni you accept that
ritual as is customari when a protest marri a cathol it is
disagre for me to have to tell you thi but the truth remain i
believ that you ar man and wife befor heaven and the world
the editor doe not hold himself respons for father
francisco view on ecclesiast marriag law
here juanna jump to her feet and even in that light leonard could see
that her breast wa heav and her ey shone with anger
it is intoler that i should be forc to listen to such
falsehood she said and if you ever repeat them in my hear
father francisco i will not speak to you again i utterli repudi
thi marriag befor the ceremoni began mr outram whisper to me to
go through with the farc and it wa a farc had i thought otherwis
i should have taken the poison if there is ani foundat for what the
father sai i have been deceiv and entrap
pardon senora repli the priest but you should not speak so
angrili the senor outram and i onli did what we were forc to do
suppos that father francisco is right which i do not believ
said leonard with sarcasm do you think miss rodd that such a sudden
undertak would be more to my like than to your believ me had
i wish to deceiv and entrap you i could not have done so without
involv myself sinc if the marriag is bind it is bind on
both parti and even such a humbl individu as i am doe not take
a wife on the faith of a five minut acquaint to be frank i
undertook your rescu for purpos far other than those of matrimoni
might i ask what thei were repli juanna in a tone of equal
acerb
certainli miss rodd but first i must explain that i am no
knighterr i am an almost penniless adventur and for urgent
reason of my own i seek to win fortun therefor when the woman
yonder and he point to soa who wa sit watch them just
out of rang of the firelight came to me with a marvel tale of a
countless treasur of rubi which she promis to reveal to me if i
would undertak the littl matter of your rescu and when she even paid
down a specimen stone of consider valu on account have noth
better to do and nowher to go be in short desper i consent
inde i did more i took the precaut of reduc the matter to
write i be on contract parti and soa act on her own
behalf and as your attornei be the other
i have not the least idea to what you allud nor did i ever give
soa ani author to sign document on my behalf but mai i see thi
write
certainli leonard answer and rise he went to the baggag whenc
he return present with a lantern and the prayerbook
juanna place the lantern besid her and open the book the first
thing that she saw wa a name on the flyleaf jane beach and beneath
it thi inscript which evid had been written by some on in a
great hurri to dearest leonard from jane 23 jan
turn over he said hastili the document is on the other side
she wa not slow to note both the write and the confus which her
perus of it caus him who wa jane beach she wonder and why did
she call mr outram dearest leonard in a moment so strang ar the
heart of women juanna felt herself much prepossess against her
whoever she might be but she turn the leaf and read the agreement
it wa a pretti sight to see her bend over the cramp write in
the circl of the lantern light but when at length she had finish
and look up there wa a smile upon her love face which had more of
scorn in it than wa pleasant
come hither soa she said and tell me what all thi nonsens mean
about rubi and the peopl of the mist
shepherdess answer soa squat down on the ground befor her
it is not nonsens the languag which i taught you when you were
littl is that of thi peopl it is a true tale though hitherto i have
hid it from you and your father mavoom lest mavoom should seek to
win the preciou stone and come to hi death through them listen
shepherdess and she repeat the outlin of the stori with which she
had alreadi made leonard acquaint end thu
i told thi tale to the white man becaus i saw that he wa greedi
after the fashion of hi race and my strait wa desper for thi
reason i bribe him with the red stone and with the promis that i
would lead him to the land of the peopl of the mist for had i not done
so he would never have us hi wit or put out hi strength to rescu
you from the yellow devil therefor it wa also that i mark thi
paper on your behalf and my own know well that i had no right to
speak for you and that by and by you could refus to abid by it
though i am bound
frank at ani rate said leonard to himself what an attornei the old
ladi would have made
sai soa ask juanna to succe in the search for these stone is
it necessari that i should act a part among your peopl
i can see no other wai she answer but what of that you ar free
and what i promis on your behalf is noth let the white man go
without hi reward it will save him a long journei
attornei murmur leonard in admir she ought to be
attorneygener
wow the wick old cheat put in otter if i had my wai i would
break her neck though she is so clever with the big gun
juanna took no notic of these asid for the moment she remain in
thought then look up smile
realli she said thi is a capit legal document but oh mr
outram why did you dispel my illus you see i had been make up
such a romant stori out of thi adventur you were the knighterr
and i wa the christian maiden in the hand of the ogr and when you
heard of it you buckl on your armour and start to the rescu and
now you bring me down to the nineteenth centuri with a run
it is not knighterrantri but a commerci transact i am in
difficulti but by plai a certain undefin part you believ that
i shall be abl to help you to secur treasur therefor you agre to
undertak the risk i am ignor of what i am to do for as yet
nobodi ha explain it to me but you need have no fear i shall not
repudi as soa suggest with so much candour certainli i shall try
my best to help you in thi busi if i can for you have work hard
and endang your life mr outram and i am sure that you have
earn your monei or rather the prospect of it realli it is all veri
amus and she laugh merrili
as for leonard he sat befor her mad with secret wrath and burn
with shame what a fool he had been thu to expos himself to the shaft
of thi girl tonguethi girl whose beauti wa onli equal by
her malic he wish that hi hand had wither befor he wrote that
accurs document but now the onli thing to do wa to face it out
i am glad that you see me in my true light at last miss rodd he
said it simplifi matter i enter into that agreement becaus it
seem to give me a remot chanc of attain my end which is monei
it doe not quit follow howev that i should not have attempt your
rescu had there been no agreement but of cours i cannot expect you
to believ that
i assur you mr outram that i am deepli oblig to you for your
caution it ha lift a great weight from my mind for if in ani wai i
can help you to obtain possess of the valuabl of thi peopl of the
mist i shall have paid off an oblig which at present crush me
we shall have to start earli tomorrow morn so with your permiss
i think that i will be turn in said leonard spring up with
singular alacr
juanna watch him go with innoc ey and as he pass she saw by
the firelight that hi face wa like a thunderstorm i have made him
angri thi time she thought to herself and i am glad of it what
busi had he to rescu me for monei but he is a strang man and
i dont think that i quit understand him i wonder who jane beach is
i suppos that she want the monei women gener do or at least thei
did in durban
then she spoke aloud soa come here while i undress and tell me again
all about your meet with mr outram and what he said forget
noth you have put me to shame soa with your talk and i will never
forgiv you tell me also how i can help to win the treasur of the
peopl of the mist
chapter xvi
misunderstand
for some dai after the acrimoni convers that ha been report
the relat between leonard and juanna were not a littl strain
although the necess of travel brought them into continu contact
both felt that thei had caus of complaint against the other and
both were at heart somewhat asham of the part which thei had plai
leonard regret ever have made the agreement with soa and juanna
now that she had cool down a littl regret have spoken as she
did upon the subject her pride wa offend but after all how could
he know besid he wa an adventur and it wa natur that he
should make term doubtless also hi anxieti to win fortun had to do
with the ladi whose name wa written in the prayerbook
perhap thi ladi wa onli a maiden aunt but a great desir seiz
juanna to know about her and when such a wish enter the heart of woman
it is probabl that she will find a mean to satisfi it have no on
els to ask juanna sound otter with whom she wa on friendli term
onli to find that the subject of jane beach did not interest the dwarf
he hazard a remark howev that doubtless she wa on of the baass
wive when he live in hi big kraal over the water
thi disgust juanna somewhat but the allus to a big kraal
excit the curios of which she had a certain share and veri
adroitli she question the dwarf concern it he rose to the fly
without hesit and told her that hi master had been on of the
greatest men in the world and on of the richest but that he lost
hi possess through the wick art of foemen and wa come to thi
countri to seek new on
inde otter enlarg upon the theme and anxiou to extol hi belov
chief worth in the ey of the shepherdess it would not be too much
to sai that he drew upon hi own imagin leonard he declar had
own countri as wide as a hors could gallop across in a dai moreov
he had two hundr tribesmen head of famili who fed upon oxen
kill for themtwenti oxen a week and ten princip wive had call
him husband juanna ask for the titl of the wive whereon the
undef otter gave them all kaffir name not neglect to describ
their lineag person charm and the number and sex of their
children the tale took about two hour to tell and after hear it
juanna conceiv a great respect for otter but she saw clearli that
if she wish for reliabl inform she must obtain it from leonard
himself
it wa not till the last dai of their journei that juanna found the
opportun she sought the voyag had been most prosper and thei
expect to reach the ruin settlement on the morrow though whether or
not thei would find mr rodd there wa a matter of anxiou conjectur
especi to hi daughter dai after dai thei row and sail up the
great river camp at night upon it bank which would have been
pleasant had it not been for the mosquito but all thi while leonard
and juanna saw littl of each other though thei met often enough on
thi particular occas howev it chanc that thei were journei
in the same boat alon except for the rower
possibl juanna had contriv that it should be so for as a gener
rule in pursuit of hi polici of avoid a disagre young person
leonard travel with otter in the first boat while juanna wa
accompani by francisco and soa in the second to the priest inde
she made herself veri agreeabl perhap to show leonard how charm
she could be when she chose she convers with him by the hour togeth
as though he were a woman friend and hi melancholi ey would lighten
with pleasur at her talk inde francisco had someth of the
feminin in hi natur hi veri gentl wa womanli and hi slight
statur delic hand and featur heighten thi impress in face
he wa not unlik juanna herself and as time went on the resembl
seem to grow had he been arrai in a woman loos attir it would
have been easi to mistak on for the other in the dusk although she
wa the taller of the two
the accid of hi profess caus juanna to admit francisco to an
intimaci which she would have withheld from ani other man she forgot
or did not understand that she wa plai a danger gamethat after
all he wa a man and that the heart of a man beat beneath hi cassock
nobodi could be more charm in her manner or more subtl in her mind
than juanna yet dai by dai she did not hesit to displai all her
strength befor the unfortun young priest which in addit to
her beauti made her somewhat irresist at ani rate on the zambesi
friendship and ignor of the world were doubtless at the bottom of
thi reprehens conduct but it is also possibl that unconsci
piqu had someth to do with it she wa determin to show leonard
that she wa not alwai a disagre person whom it wa well to avoid
or at least that other did not think so that all these air and grace
might have a tragic effect upon francisco never occur to her till too
late
well for onc the order of thing wa chang leonard and juanna sat
side by side in the first boat the even wa love thei glide
slowli by the reedfring bank watch the long light plai upon the
surfac of the lone river listen to the whistl wing of the
countless wildfowl overhead and count the herd of variou game that
roam upon the plain beyond
for a while neither of them spoke much occasion juanna would
call her companion attent to some waterflow or to a great fish
dart from the oar and he would answer by a word or nod hi heart
wa wroth with the girl as otter would have said he wonder why
she had come with himbecaus she wa tire of the priest perhap he
wish her awai and yet he would have been sorri enough had she gone
for her part juanna desir to make him speak and did not know how to
break through hi moodi silenc suddenli she lean back in the boat
and began to sing in a rich contralto voic that move him he had never
heard her sing befor had never heard ani good sing for mani year
inde and he wa fond of sing the song she sang wa a portugues
lovesong veri tender and passion address by a bereav lover to
hi dead mistress and she put much express into it present she
ceas and he notic that her beauti ey were full of tear so
she could feel
that is too sad she said with a littl laugh and then burst into
a kaffir boatsong of which the settlement nativ joyou in the
prospect of onc more see their home took up the choru gleefulli
present she weari of the boatchant i am tire you she said i
dare sai that you do not care for sing
on the contrari miss rodd i am veri fond of it your voic is good
if you will allow me to sai so and it ha been train i do not
quit understand how you can have had the opportun to learn so mani
thingsmus for instanc
i suppos mr outram you think that i should be a sort of savag by
right but as a matter of fact although we have live on the zambesi
i have had some chanc there is alwai a certain amount of trade on
the river by mean of which we often obtain book and other thing and
ar brought into occasion contact with european merchant travel
and missionari then my father is a gentli born and welleduc man
though circumst have caus him to spend hi life in these wild
place he wa a scholar in hi dai and he ha taught me a good deal
and i have pick up more by read also for nearli three year i wa
at a good school in durban and did my best to improv myself there i
did not wish to grow up wild becaus i live among wild peopl
inde that explain the miracl and do you like live among
savag
i have like it well enough hitherto but thi last adventur ha
sicken me oh it wa dread had i not been veri strong i could
never have endur it a nervou woman would have been driven mad
ye i have like it well enough i have alwai look upon it as a
prepar for life i think that the societi of natur is the best
educ for the societi of man sinc until you understand and ar
in sympathi with the on you cannot realli understand the other now i
should like to go to europ and see the world and it civilis for
i know from what stuff thei were evolv but perhap i never shall at
ani rate i have to find my dear father first and she sigh
leonard made no answer he wa think
and you mr outram do you care for thi life
i he exclaim bitterli like yourself miss rodd i am the victim
of circumst and must make the best of them as i told you i am
a penniless adventur seek my fortun in the rough place of the
earth of cours i might earn a livelihood in england but that is of no
us to me i must win wealth and a great deal of it
what is the good she said is there ani object in wear out on
life by try to grow rich
that depend i have an object on which i have sworn to fulfil
she look at him inquiringli
miss rodd i will tell you my brother who di of fever some week
ago and i were the last male survivor of a veri ancient hous we were
born to great prospect or at least he wa but ow to the conduct of
our father everyth wa lost to us and the old hous which had been
our for centuri went to the hammer that wa some seven year ago
when i wa a man of threeandtwenti we swore that we would try to
retriev those fortunesnot for ourselv so much but for the sake
of the familyand came to africa to do it my brother is dead but i
inherit the oath and continu the quest howev hopeless it mai be and
now perhap you will understand why i sign a certain document
ye she said i understand now it is a strang histori but tell
me have you no relat left
on i believ if she still livesa maiden aunt my mother sister
is she jane beach she ask quickli forgiv me but i saw that name
in the prayerbook
no he said she is not jane beach
juanna hesit then curios and perhap other feel overcam
her and she ask straight out
who is jane beach
leonard look at juanna and rememb all that he had suffer at her
hand it wa impertin of her to ask such a question but sinc she
chose to do so she should have an answer doubtless she suppos that
he wa in love with herself doubtless her conduct wa premedit and
aim at the repress of hi hope he would show her that there
were other women in the world and that on of them at ani rate had not
thought so poorli of him it wa foolish conduct on hi part but then
peopl suffer under unmerit snub neglect and mockeri at the
hand of a ladi thei admir ar apt to lose their judgment and do
foolish thing so he answer
jane beach is the ladi to whom i wa engag
i guess it she repli with a smile and a shiver i guess it
when i saw that you alwai carri the prayerbook about with you
you forget miss rodd that the prayerbook contain an agreement which
might becom valuabl
juanna took no heed of hi sarcasm she wa too intent on other
thought
and ar you engag to her now
no i suppos not her father broke off the match when we lost our
fortun
she must have been veri sorri
ye she wa veri sorri
how interest you must not think me curiou mr outram but i have
never come across a love affairthat is a white love affairout of a
novel of cours she often write to you
i have never heard from her sinc i left england
inde sure she might have written or sent a messag
i suppos that her father forbad it leonard answer but in hi
heart he also thought that jane might have written or sent a messag
and could well guess why none had come
ah her father tell me wa she veri beauti
she wa the loveliest woman that i ever sawexcept on who is sit
at my side he ad to himself
and do you love her veri much
ye i love her veri much
if juanna heard the chang of tens she took no note of it it wa
such a littl thing onli on letter and yet what a vast gulf there is
between love and love it is measureless still most peopl have
cross it in their live some of them more than onc he told her the
exact truth but after a woman fashion she ad to the truth he said
that he had love jane beach and she did not doubt that he still love
her more than ever how wa she to know that the imag of thi farawai
and hate jane wa fade from hi mind to be replac by that of a
certain present juanna she took it all for grant and fill in the
detail with a liber hand and in high colour
juanna took it all for grant again she shiver and her lip turn
grei with pain she understood now that she had love him ever sinc
the night when thei first met in the slave camp it wa her love as
yet unrecognis which transform her had caus her to behav so
badli it had been dread to her to think that she should be thrust
upon thi man in a mock marriag it wa wors to know that he had
enter on her rescu not for her own sake but in the hope of win
wealth in the moment of her loss juanna learn for the first time what
she had gain she had plai and lost and she could never throw those
dice again it wa begun and finish
so juanna thought and felt a littl more experi of the world might
have taught her differ but she had no experi and in such
novel as she had read the hero seldom vari in the pursuit of hi
first love or turn to look upon anoth ah if all hero and
heroin act up to thi golden rule what an uncommonli dull world it
would be
juanna gather her energi and spoke in a low steadi voic mr
outram she said i am so much oblig to you for tell me all thi
it interest me a great deal and i earnestli hope that soa tale of
treasur will turn out to be true and that you mai win it by my help
it will be some slight return for all that you have done for me ye i
hope that you will win it and bui back your home and after your year
of toil and danger live there in honour and happi andlov as
you deserv to do and now i ask you to forgiv me my behaviour my
rude and my bitter speech it ha been shame i know perhap
you will make some excus for me when you rememb all that i have
gone through my nerv were shaken i wa not myselfi act like a
halfwild minx there that is all
as she spoke juanna began to draw the signetr from her left hand
but she never complet the act it wa hi gift to her the onli
outward link between her and the man whom she had lostwhi should she
part with it it remind her of so much she knew now that thi
mock marriag wa in a sens a true on that is so far as she wa
concern for from that hour she had inde given her spirit into hi
keepingnot herself but her better half and her love and those solemn
word over her in that dread place and time had consecr the
gift it wa noth it meant noth yet on her it should be bind
though not on him ye all her life she would remain as true to him in
mind and act as though she had inde becom hi wife on that night of
fear to do so would be her onli happi she thought though it is
strang that in her sorrow she should turn for comfort to thi veri
event the mere mention of which had move her to scorn and bitter
but so it wa and so let it be
leonard saw the look upon her face he had never seen anyth quit
like it befor with astonish he heard her gentl word and
someth of the mean of the look and word came home to him at ani
rate he understood that she wa suffer she wa chang in hi sight
he no longer felt bitter toward her he love her might it not be that
she also love him and that here wa the kei to her strang conduct
onc and for all he would settl the matter he would tell her that jane
beach had ceas to be more than a tender memori to him and that she
had becom all
juanna he said address her by her christian name for the first
time
but there as it wa fate the sentenc began and end for at that
moment a cano shot alongsid of them and francisco voic wa heard
hail them through the fog
peter sai that you have pass the camp place senora he did not
stop you becaus he thought that you knew it well
it wa the mist father juanna answer with a littl laugh we have
lost ourselv in a mist
a few minut and thei were on the bank and leonard declar
remain unspoken nor did he make ani attempt to renew it it seem to
him that juanna had built a wall between them which he could not climb
from that even forward her whole attitud toward him chang she no
longer anger him by bitter word inde she wa gentl itself
and noth could be kindlier or more friendli and open than her manner
but there it began and end onc or twice inde he attempt some
small advanc with the result that instantli she seem to freezeto
becom cold and hard as marbl he could not understand her he fear
her somewhat and hi pride took alarm at the least he could keep hi
feel to himself he need not expos them to be trampl upon by thi
incomprehens girl
so although thei were destin to live side by side for month rare
out of each other sight or thought he went hi wai and she went
her but the past and secret troubl left it mark on both leonard
becam sterner more silent watch and suspici juanna grew
suddenli from a girl into a woman of presenc and great natur digniti
she did not often laugh dure those month as had been her wont she
onli smile sadli enough at time her thought would not let her
laugh for thei were of what her life might have been had no such person
as jane beach exist and of what it must be becaus of jane beach
inde thi unknown jane took a great hold of her mindsh haunt her
juanna pictur her in a dozen differ shape of beauti endow with
mani vari charm and hate each phantasm wors than the last
still for a while she would set it up as a rival and try to outmatch
it particular fanci grace or lovelinessa strang form of jealousi
which at length led otter to remark that the shepherdess wa not on
woman but twenti women and therefor bewitch and to be avoid but
these fit onli took her from time to time for the most part she move
among them a grave and somewhat state young ladi care of
mani thing fresh and love to look upon a mysteri to her white
companion and to the nativ littl short of a goddess
but wherev juanna move two shadow went with herher secret passion
and the variabl imag of that faroff english ladi who had rob her
of it fruit
chapter xvii
the death of mavoom
on more dai journei brought the parti to the ruin settlement
which thei found in much the same condit as the arab had left it a
few week befor fortun the destruct wa not nearli so great

least a hundr of mr rodd own peopl who had escap the clutch
of the slavertrad by hide absenc and variou other accid
and now return to greet hi daughter and their own rel as thei

to juanna wa most touch men women and children ran to her the
men salut her with guttur voic and uplift arm the women and
children gesticul chatter and kiss her dress and hand
wave them asid impati juanna ask the men if anyth had been
seen or heard of her father thei answer no some of their number
had start up the river to search for him on the same dai when she wa
captur but thei had not return and no tide had come from them
or him
do not be alarm said leonard see the distress and anxieti
written on her face doubtless he ha gone further than he anticip
and the men have not been abl to find him
i fear that someth ha happen to him she answer he should
have been back by now he promis to return within the fortnight
by thi time the stori of the captur and destruct of the slave
camp wa spread abroad among the peopl by the rescu men and the
excit rose to it height otter see a favour opportun
to trumpet hi master fame swagger to and fro through the crowd
shake a spear and chant leonard prais after the zulu fashion
wow he said wow look at him ye peopl and be astonish
look at him the white eleph and hear hi deed
in the night he fell upon them
he fell upon them the arm men in a fenc place
he did it alon no on help him but a black monkei and a woman with
a shake hand
he beguil them with a tongu of honei he smote them with a spear of
iron
he won the shepherdess from the midst of them to be a wife to him
he satisfi the yellow devil he satisfi him with gold
the prai man prai over them then strife aros
their greatest warrior gave him battl he broke him with hi fist
then the monkei plai hi trick and the shake hand made a great
nois a nois of thunder
thei fell dead thei fell dead in heap
the fire roar behind them in front of them the bullet hail
thei cri like women but the fire stai not it lick up their
strength
ash ar all that is left of them thei ar dead the arm men
no more shall thei bring desol the dai of slaveri is gone by
who did it he did it the terribl lion the blackman lion with the
white face
he gave the slaver to the sword he doom their captain to death
he loosen the iron of the captiv now thei shall eat the bread of
freedom
prais him ye peopl who broke the strength of the oppressor
prais him the shepherd of the shepherdess who led her from the hous
of the wick
prais him ye children of mavoom in whose hand ar death and life
no such deed have been told of in the land prais him the deliver
who give you back your children
ay prais him said juanna who wa stand by prais him
children of my father sinc but for him none of us would see the light
todai
at thi junctur leonard himself arriv upon the scene just in time to
hear juanna word all the peopl of the settlement took up the cry
and hundr of other nativ collect there join in it thei rush
toward him shout prais to thee shepherd of the shepherdess
prais to thee deliver
then leonard in a furi caught hold of otter vow that if he dare
to sai anoth word he would instantli break hi neck and the tumult
ceas but from that dai forward he wa known among the nativ as the
deliver and by no other name
that even as leonard juanna and the priest sat at meat within the
wall of the settlementhous with the plunder of the slave camp pile
about them talk anxious of the fate of mr rodd and wonder if
anyth could be done to discov hi whereabout thei heard a stir
among the nativ without at thi moment otter rush in cry
mavoom ha come
instantli thei sprang to their feet and ran outsid the hous head
by juanna there born on the shoulder of six travelworn men and
follow by a crowd of nativ thei saw a litter upon which lai the
figur of a man cover with blanket
oh he is dead said juanna stop suddenli and press her hand
to her heart
for a moment leonard thought that she wa right befor he could speak
howev thei heard a feebl voic call to the men who carri the
litter to be more care in their movement and onc more juanna
sprang forward cry father father
then the bearer brought their burden into the hous and set it down
upon the floor leonard look saw befor him a tall and handsom
man of about fifti year of ag and saw also by mani unmistak sign
that he wa at the point of death
juanna gasp her father is that you then you have escap thank
god now i can die happi
it would serv littl purpos to set out in detail the broken
convers which follow but by degre leonard learnt the stori it
seem that mr rodd wa disappoint in hi purpos of purchas
the hoard of ivori which he went out to seek and unwil to return
emptyhand push on up the river with the hope of obtain more in
thi he fail also and had just begun hi homeward journei when he wa
met by the parti which soa despatch and heard the terribl tide
of the abduct of hi daughter by pereira it wa nightfal when the
messeng arriv and too dark to travel
for a while mr rodd sat brood over the new of thi crush
disast perhap the most fear that could come to a father ear
then he did what he wa but too prone to doflew for refug to the
bottl
when he had drunk enough to destroi hi judgment he rose and insist
upon continu their march through the inki dark of the night in
vain did hi men remonstr sai that the road wa rocki and full of
danger he would take no denial inde he vow that if thei refus
to come he would shoot them so thei start mr rodd lead the wai
while hi peopl stumbl after him through tree and over rock as best
thei might
the march wa not a long on howev for present the men heard an
oath and a crash and their master vanish nor could thei find him
till the dawn came to give them light then thei discov that thei
had halt upon the edg of a small but precipit cliff and at the
bottom of the donga beneath lai mavoomnot dead inde but senseless
and with three rib and hi right ankl broken for some dai thei
nurs him there till at length he decid upon be carri forward
in a litter so notwithstand hi suffer which were intens thei
bore him homeward by short stage till ultim thei reach the
settlement
that night leonard examin mr rodd injuri and found that thei
were fatal inde mortif had alreadi set in about the region of
the broken rib still he live awhil
on the follow morn the dy man sent for leonard enter
the room he found him ly on the floor hi head support in
hi daughter lap while the priest francisco prai besid him he
suffer no pain now for when mortif begin pain pass and hi
mind wa quit clear
mr outram he said i have learnt all the stori of the take of the
slave camp and your rescu of my daughter it wa the pluckiest thing
that i ever heard of and i onli wish that i had been there to help in
it
dont speak of it said leonard perhap you have heard also that i
did it for a consider
ye thei told me that too and small blame to you if onli that old
fool soa had let me into the secret of those rubi i would have had
a try for them year ago as of cours you will when i am gone well
i hope that you mai get them but i have no time to talk of rubi for
death ha caught me at last through my own fault as usual if you ever
take a drop outram be warn by me and give it up but you dont look
as if you did you look as i us to befor i learnt to tackl a bottl
of rum at a sit
now listen comrad i am in a hole not about myself for that must
have come sooner or later and it doe not much matter when the world
is rid of a useless fellow like me but about my girl here what is to
becom of her i have not got a cent those curs slaver have clear
me out and she ha no friend how should she have when i have been
thirti year awai from england
look here i am go to do the onli thing i can do i am go to
leav my daughter in your charg though it is rough on you and as you
deal with her so mai heaven deal with you i understand that there wa
some ceremoni of marriag between you down yonder i dont know how you
take that either of you or how far the matter will go when i am dead
but if it goe ani wai at all i trust to your honour as an english
gentleman to repeat that ceremoni the first time you come to a
civilis countri if you do not care for each other howev then
juanna must shift as other women have to do poor thing she can look
after herself and i suppos that her face will help her to a husband
some time there is on thing though she hasnt a pound she is the
best girl that ever step and of as good blood as you can be there
is no older famili than the rodd in lincolnshir and she is the last
of them that i know of also her mother wa wellborn although she wa
a portuge
and now do you accept the trust
i would gladli answer leonard but how can i i propos to go
after these rubi would it not be better that father francisco here
should take your daughter to the coast i have a littl monei which is
at her dispos
no answer the dy man with energi i will onli trust her to you
if you want to search for these rubi and you would be a fool not to
she must accompani youthat is all i know that you will look after
her and if the worst come to the worst she ha a medicin to protect
herself with the same that she so nearli us in the slave camp now
what do you sai
leonard thought for a moment while the dy man watch hi face
anxious
it is a heavi respons he said and the circumst make it
an awkward on but i accept it i will take care of her as though she
were my wife ormi daughter
thank you for that answer rodd i believ you and as to the
relationship you will settl that for yourselv and now goodby i
like you i wish that we had known on anoth befor i got into troubl
at home becam a zambesi trader anda drunkard
leonard took the hand which mr rodd lift with a visibl effort and
when he releas it it fell heavili like the hand of a dead man then
as he turn to go he glanc at juanna face but could make noth
of it for it wa as the face of a sphinx
there the girl sat her back rest against the wall her dy
father head pillow upon her knee motionless as if carv in stone
she wa stare straight befor her with ey wide open and curv
lip set apart as though she were about to speak and suddenli had been
stricken to silenc so still wa she that leonard could scarc note
ani movement of her breast even her eyelid had ceas to quiver and
the veri pallor of her face seem fix like that of a waxen imag he
wonder what she wa think of but even had she been will to bare
her thought to him it is doubt whether she could have made them
intellig her mind wa confus but two thing struggl on
against the other within it the sens of loss and the sens of shame
the father whom notwithstand hi fault she love dearli who
inde had been her companion her teacher her playmat and her friend
the dearest she had known lai dy befor her ey and with hi last
breath he consign her to the care of the man whom she love and from
whom as she believ she wa for ever separ would there then be
no end to the oblig under which she labour at the hand of thi
stranger who had suddenli taken possess of her life and what fate
wa on her that she should thu be forc into fals posit whenc
there wa no escap
did she wish to escap even juanna knew not but as she sat there
with a sphinxlik face troubl and doubt and mani anoth fear and
feel took so firm a hold of her that at length her mind bewild
with it own tumult lost it grip of present realiti and sought
refug in dream which he could not disentangl no wonder then that
leonard fail to guess her thought as she watch him go from the
deathb
mr rodd di peacefulli that even and on the follow afternoon
thei buri him francisco perform the servic three more dai
pass befor leonard had ani convers with juanna who move about
the place pale selfcontain and silent nor would he have spoken to
her then had she not taken the initi
mr outram she said when do you propos to start upon thi
journei
realli i do not know i am not sure that i shall start at all it
depend upon you you see i am respons for you now and i can
scarc reconcil it with my conscienc to take on you such a
wildgoos chase
pleas do not talk like that she answer if it will simplifi
matter i mai as well tell you at onc that i have made up my mind to
go
you cannot unless i go too he answer smile
you ar wrong there juanna repli defiantli i can and what is
more i will and soa shall guid me it is you who cannot go without
methat is if soa tell the truth
for good or evil we ar yoke togeth in thi matter mr outram so
it is useless for us to try to pull differ wai befor he di my
dear father told you hi view plainli and even if there were no other
consider involv such as that of the agreementfor whatev
you mai think to the contrari woman have some sens of honour mr
outrami would not disregard hi wish besid what els ar we to
do we ar both adventur now and both penniless or pretti
nearli so perhap if we succe in find thi treasur and it is
suffici larg you will be gener and give me a share of it sai
five per cent on which to support my declin year and she turn
and left him
begin to show temper again said leonard to himself i will ask
francisco what he think of it
of late thing had gone a littl better between leonard and the priest
not that the former had as yet ani complet confid in the latter
still he understood now that francisco wa a man of honest mind and
gentl instinct and natur in thi dilemma he turn to seek for
counsel to hi onli white companion francisco listen to the stori
quietli inde for the most part it wa alreadi known to him
well he said when leonard had finish i suppos that you must go
the senora juanna is not a young ladi to chang her mind when onc she
ha made it up and if you were to refus to start mark my word she
would make the expedit by herself or try to do so as to thi stori
of treasur and the possibl of win it i can onli sai that
it seem strang enough to be true and that the undertak is so
impractic that it will probabl be successfulli accomplish
hum said leonard sound a littl paradox but after that slave
camp busi like you i am inclin to believ in paradox and now
father what do you propos to do
i to accompani you of cours if you will allow me i am a priest and
will plai the part of chaperon if i can do noth els he ad with
a smile
leonard whistl and ask why on earth do you mix yourself up in such
a doubt busi you have all your life befor you you ar abl
and mai make a career for yourself in religion there is noth for you
to gain by thi journei on the contrari it mai bring you deathor
he ad with mean sorrow which cannot be forgotten
my life and death ar in the hand of god the priest answer humbl
he appoint the begin and he will appoint the end as for that
sorrow which cannot be forgotten what if it is alreadi with me and he
touch hi breast and look up
the ey of the two men met and thei understood each other
why dont you go awai and try to forget her said leonard
the speech wa blunt but francisco did not resent it
i do not go he answer becaus it would be useless so far as i am
concern the mischief is done for her there is none to fear while i
stai it is possibl that i mai be abl to do her some servic feebl as
i am i have sin a great sin but she doe not know and will never
know it while i live for you ar a man of honour and will tell her
noth and she ha no ey to see what am i to her i am a priestno
man i am like a woman friend and as such she is fond of me no i have
sin against heaven against myself and her and you ala who could
help it she wa like an angel in that inferno so kind so sweet so
love and the heart is evil
why do you sai that you sin against me francisco as to the rule
of your church i have my own opinion of them still there thei ar

world and for you she will turn the earth to heaven
she might turn it to the other place such thing have happen said
leonard moodili then he stretch out hi arm and grasp the priest
delic hand you ar a true gentleman he ad and i am a fool
i saw someth of all thi and i suspect you as for the marriag
there is none and the ladi care noth for me if anyth she

reason i fanci so you ar come too well we will do our best to
protect her both of us and the futur must look to itself
thank you for your word francisco answer gentli and turn awai
understand that leonard thought himself hi companion in misfortun
when the father had gone leonard stood for a while muse upon the
curious tangl web in which he found himself involv here he wa
commit to a strang and desper enterpris nor wa thi all for
about him were other complic total differ from those
which might be expect in connect with such a mediaev adventur
complic which though thei ar frequent enough in the civilis
life of men were scarc to be look for in the wild of africa and
amidst savag among hi companion were hi ward who chanc also to
be the ladi whom he love and desir to make hi wife but who as
he thought care noth for him and a priest who wa enamour
platon of the same ladi and yet wish with rare selfsacrific
to bring about her union with anoth man here were materi enough
for a romanc leav the journei and the fabl treasur out of it
onli then the scene should be laid elsewher
leonard laugh aloud as he thought of these thing it wa so curiou
that all thi should be heap upon him at onc so inartist and yet
so like life in which the great event ar frequent crowd togeth
without sens of distanc or proport
but even as he laugh he rememb that thi wa no joke matter for
anybodi concern unless it were juanna ala alreadi she wa more to
him than ani treasur and as he thought less attain well there
it wa he accept it as it stood she had enter into hi life
whether for good or for evil remain to be seen he had no desir to
repeat the experi of hi youthto wear out hi heart and exhaust
himself in effort to attain happi which might after all turn to
wormwood on hi lip thi time thing should take their chanc the
busi of life remain to him and he would follow it for that is
the mission of man it happi must look to itself for that is the
gift of heaven after which it is useless to seek and to strive
meantim he could find time to piti francisco the priest with so nobl
a heart

three month had pass sinc that dai when juanna declar her
unalter determin to accompani leonard upon hi search for the
treasur of the peopl of the mist

a river that ran through a great and desol plain thei were a small
parti three white peopl name leonard francisco and juanna

follow the cours of the river in cano for ten dai or more then
leav the main stream thei paddl for three week up that of a
tributari call mavua which ran for mani mile along the foot of
a great rang of mountain name manganja here thei made but slow
progress becaus of the frequent rapid which necessit the
porterag of the cano over broken ground and for consider
distanc at length thei came to a rapid which wa so long and so
continu that regretfulli enough thei were oblig to abandon the
cano altogeth and proce on foot
the danger of their water journei had been mani but thei were noth
compar with those that now environ them and in addit to bodili
peril thei must face the daili and terribl fatigu of long march
through an unknown countri cumber as thei were with arm and other
absolut necessari baggag the countri through which thei were now

of countless game
on thei went northward and upward through a measureless wast plain
succeed plain in endless monotoni distanc gave place to distanc
and ever there were more beyond
gradual the climat grew colder thei were travers a portion of
the unexplor plateau that separ southern from central africa it
loneli wa aw and the bearer began to murmur sai that thei
had reach the end of the world and were walk over it edg inde
thei had onli two comfort in thi part of their undertak the land
lai so high that none of them were stricken by fever and thei could
not well miss the road which if soa wa to be believ ran along the
bank of the river that had it sourc in the territori of the peopl
of the mist
the adventur that befel them were endless but it is not propos to
describ them in detail onc thei starv for three dai be unabl
to find game on anoth occas thei fell in with a tribe of bushmen
who harass them with poison arrow kill two of their best
men and were onli prevent from annihil them through the terror
inspir by their firearm which thei took for magic instrument
escap from the bushmen thei enter a forest countri which teem
with antelop and also with lion that night by night thei must keep
at bai as best thei could then came sever dai march through a plain
strewn with sharp stone which lame most of the parti and after thi
eighti or a hundr mile of dreari roll veldt cloth with rank
grass just now brown with the winter frost that caught their feet at
everi step
now at length thei halt on the boundari of the land of the peopl of
the mist there befor them not more than a mile awai tower a huge
cliff or wall of rock stretch across the plain like a giant step
far as the ey could reach and vari from seven hundr to a thousand
feet in height down the surfac of thi cliff the river flow in a
seri of beauti cascad
befor thei had finish their even meal of buck flesh the moon wa
up and by it light the three white peopl stare hopelessli at thi
frown natur fortif wonder if thei could climb it and
wonder also what terror await them upon it further side thei
were silent that night for a great weari had overcom them and if
the truth must be known all three of them regret that thei had ever
undertaken thi mad adventur
leonard glanc to the right where some fifti pace awai the
settlement men were crouch round the fire thei also were silent and
it wa easi to see that the heart wa out of them

pathet attempt at play how could she be cheer poor girl

leonard and otter you ar my father and my mother and my child and
where you ar in death or in life there is my home let us go then
among thi peopl of mine there to perish miser so that the
deliver mai seek to glut himself with wealth
listen thi is the law of my peopl or thi wa their law when i left
them forti year ago that everi stranger who pass through their gate
should be offer as a sacrific to aca the mother if the time of hi
come should be in summer and to jal the son if the time of hi come
be in winter for the mistdwel do not love stranger but there is
a propheci among my peopl which tell when mani gener have gone
by that aca the mother and jal the son shall return to the land which
onc thei rule cloth in the flesh of men and the shape of aca shall
be such a shape as your shepherdess and the shape of jal shall be as
is the shape of thi black dog of a dwarf whom when first i saw him in
my folli i deem immort and divin then the mother and the son
shall rule in the land and it king shall ceas from kingship and the
priest of the snake shall be their servant and with them shall come
peac and prosper that do not pass awai
shepherdess you know the tongu of the peopl of the mist for
when you were littl i taught it to you becaus to me it is the
most beauti of tongu you know the song also the holi song of
rearis that shall be on the lip of aca when she come again
and which i be the daughter of the highpriest learn with mani
anoth secret befor i wa doom to be a bride to the snake and fled
fear my doom now come apart with me shepherdess and you black
on come also that i mai teach you your lesson of what you shall do
when we meet the squadron of the peopl of the mist
juanna rose to obei her follow by otter grumbl for he hate
the old woman as much as she hate him and moreov he did not take
kindli to thi notion of masquerad as a god or inde to the
prospect of a lengthen sojourn amongst hi ador but from all
account somewhat trucul worshipp befor thei went howev
leonard spoke
i have heard you soa he said and i do not like your word for
thei show me that your heart is fierc and evil ye though you love
the shepherdess your heart is evil now hear me should you dare to
plai us fals whatev mai befal us be sure of thi that moment you
die go
spare your threat deliver answer soa haughtili i shall not
betrai you becaus to do so would be to betrai the shepherdess but ar
you then a fool that you think i should fear death at your hand who
tomorrow with a word could give you all to torment prai deliver
that the hour mai not be near when you shall rejoic to die by the
bullet with which you threaten me so that you mai escap wors thing
and she turn and went
i am not nervou said leonard to francisco but that shedevil
frighten me if it were not for juanna she would caus us to be
murder on the first possibl opportun and if onli she can secur
her safeti i believ that she will do it yet
and i believ that she is a witch outram answer the priest with
fervour a servant of the evil on such as ar written of in the
scriptur last night i saw her prai to her god she did not know
that i wa near for the place wa lone but i saw her and i never
wish to see anyth so horribl again i will tell you why she hate us
all so much outram she is jealou becaus the senorado not hate
us that woman heart is wick wicked wa born in her yet as
none ar altogeth evil she ha on virtu her love of the senora
she is husbandless and childless for even among the black peopl as i
have learnt from the settlement men all have fear her and shrunk from
her notwithstand her good look therefor everyth that is best
in her ha gone to nourish thi love for the woman whom she nurs from
a babe it wa becaus of her fierc that the senor rodd who is
dead chose her for hi daughter nurs when he found that her heart
wa hungri with love for the child for he knew that she would die
befor she suffer harm to come to her
he show good judgment there said leonard had it not been for soa
juanna would have been a slavegirl now or dead
that is so outram but whether we show good judgment in trust our
live to her tender merci is quit anoth matter sai friend do you
think it well to go on with thi busi
oh confound it all said leonard with irrit how can we turn
back now just think of the journei and how foolish we should look
besid we have none of us got anyth to live upon it took most of
the gold that i had to bribe peter and hi men to accompani us i dare
sai that we shall all be kill that seem veri probabl but for my
part i realli shant be sorri i am tire of life francisco it is
noth but a struggl and a wretched and i begin to feel that
peac is all i can hope to win i have done my best here accord to my
light so i dont know why i should be afraid of the futur especi
as it ha been taken out of me pretti well in the present though of
cours i am afraid for all that everi man is the onli thing that
troubl me is a doubt whether we ought to take juanna into such a
place but realli i do not know but what it would be as danger to go
back as to proce those gentlemen with the poison arrow mai have
recov from their fear of firearm by now
i wish we had noth wors than the hereaft to fear said francisco
with a sigh it is the journei thither that is so terribl as for
our expedit have undertaken it i think on the whole that we had
better persever especi as the senora wish it and she is veri
hard to turn after all our live ar in the hand of the almighti and
therefor we shall be just as safe or unsaf among the peopl of the
mist as in a european citi those of us who ar destin to live will
live and those whose hour is at hand must die and now good night for
i am go to sleep
next morn shortli befor dawn leonard wa awaken by a hubbub
among the nativ and creep out of hi blanket he found that
some of them who had been to the river to draw water had captur two
bushmen belong to a nomad tribe that live by spear fish these
wretch creatur who notwithstand the cold onli wore a piec of
bark ti round their shoulder were scream with fright and it
wa not until thei had been pacifi by gift of bead and empti brass
cartridg that anyth could be got out of them
when confid had at length been restor otter question them
close as to the countri that lai beyond the wall of rock and the
peopl who dwelt in it through on of the settlement men who spoke a
languag suffici like their own to make himself understood thei
repli that thei had never been in that countri themselv becaus
thei dare not go there but thei had heard of it from other
the land wa veri cold and foggi thei said so foggi that sometim
peopl could not see each other for whole dai and in it dwelt a race
of great men cover with hair who sacrif stranger to a snake
which thei worship and marri all their fairest maiden to a god
that wa all thei knew of the countri and of the great men for few who
visit there ever return to tell tide it wa certainli a haunt
land
find that there wa no more to be learnt from the bushmen leonard
suffer them to depart which thei did at consider speed and
order the settlement men to make readi to march but now a fresh
difficulti aros the interpret had repeat all the bushmen stori
to hi companion among whom it is needless to sai it produc no
small effect therefor when the bearer receiv their order instead
of strike the littl tent in which juanna slept and prepar their
load as usual after a brief consult thei advanc upon leonard in
a bodi
what is it peter he ask of the headman

the peopl of the mist
your word ar true deliver said peter the homeward wai is far
and it peril ar mani mayhap but veri few of us will live to see
their hut again for thi is an illfat journei but if we pass
yonder and he point to the wall of rock then we shall all of us
certainli die and be offer to a devil by devil
leonard pull hi beard thoughtfulli and said it seem there is
noth els to sai peter except goodby
the headman salut and wa turn awai with an abash counten
when juanna stop him togeth with otter and the other she had been
listen to the colloqui in silenc and now spoke for the first time
peter she said gentli when you and your companion were in the
hand of the yellow devil and about to be sold as slave who wa it
that rescu you

brethren said peter after a moment paus is it to be born that
the shepherdess should mock us thu and tie such rope of shame about
our neck
no thei answer we cannot bear it
then for a while thei consult togeth again and present peter
stood forward and said deliver we will accompani you and the
shepherdess into the countri of devil nor need you fear that we shall
desert or betrai you we know well that we go to our death everi on
of us still it is better to die than to live bear the burden of such
bitter word as hide within the shepherdesss lip

tell you thi peter that befor you left thi place the word of the
shepherdess had come true for you and on or two other for i should
have fought you till i wa kill and though i have littl wisdom yet i
know how to fight
leonard smile at the dwarf rage but hi heart wa heavi within him
he knew that these men had reason on their side and he fear greatli
lest their evil forebod should come true and the live of all of
them pai forfeit for hi rash
but it wa too late to turn back now thing must befal as thei were
fate
chapter xix
the end of the journei
an hour later the parti began the ascent of the wall of rock which
prove to be an even more difficult busi than thei had anticip
there wa no path for those who live beyond thi natur barrier never
came down it and few of the dweller in the plain had ever ventur
to go up it wa possibl for soa herself had descend here in bygon
year and thi wa all that could be said for it
in default of a better road thei follow the cours of the river
which thunder down the face of the precipic in four great waterfal
connect by as mani sullen pool whose caviti had been hollow out
in the cours of centuri from the rock the second of these ledg
prove so insurmount that at on time leonard thought that thei
would be oblig to abandon their attempt and follow the foot of the
cliff till thei found some easier rout but at last otter who could
climb like a cat succeed in pass the most danger part at the
risk of hi life bear a rope with him by mean of which the rest
of the parti and the load of good were haul up on by on it wa
even befor the height wa scale and thei proceed to encamp upon
it summit make a scanti meal of some meat which thei had brought
with them
that night thei pass in great discomfort for it wa midwint and
here the climat prove to be veri cold bitter wind swept across the
vast plain befor them and search them through all the cloth and
blanket thei had scarc suffic to keep them warm inde the
settlement men and francisco who had been bred in a southern clime
suffer sever nor were matter improv when on the break of
the light thei woke from a troubl sleep to find the plain hidden in
a dens mist howev thei rose made a fire with reed and dead wood
which thei gather on the bank of the river and at wait for the
fog to vanish
but it did not vanish so about nine oclock thei continu their
journei under soa guidanc follow the east bank of the river
northward the ground prove easi to travel over for with the
except of isol waterworn boulder of granit the plain wa
perfectli smooth and cover with turf as fine as ani that grow in
northern land
all that dai thei march on wander like ghost through the mist
and guid in their path by the murmur sound of the river thei met
no man but onc or twice great herd of hairi creatur thunder past
them leonard fire into on of these herd with an express rifl for
thei want meat and a prodigi snort and bellow told him that
hi shot had taken effect run to the spot whenc the sound came
he found a huge white bull kick in it death struggl the anim
wa cover with long white hair like that of the british breed of wild
cattl and measur at least seventeen hand in height round it stood
other snort with fear and wonder that when thei saw leonard put
down their head threateningli tear up the turf with their great
horn he shout aloud and fire anoth shot whereon thei turn and
disappear into the mist
thi happen toward nightfal so thei determin to camp upon the
spot but while thei were engag in skin the bull an incid
occur that did not tend to rais their spirit at sunset the sky
clear a littleat least the sink sun show red through the mist
as it doe in a london fog of the third densiti against thi red ball
of the sun and some dozen yard awai suddenli there appear the
gigant figur of a man for unless the fog deceiv them he must
have been between six and seven feet high and broad in proport of
hi face thei could see noth but he wa clad in goatskin and
arm with a great spear and a bow slung upon hi back
juanna wa the first to see and point him out to leonard with a start of
fear as he stood watch them in solemn silenc obei the impuls
of the moment leonard step forward toward the vision hold hi
rifl readi but befor he reach the spot where it had stood the
figur vanish
then he walk back again to juanna i think we have heard so much of
giant that we begin to believ we see them he said laugh
as he spoke someth clove the air between them and stuck in the earth
beyond thei went to it it wa a larg arrow have a barb point and
flight with red feather
thi is a veri tangibl fanci at ani rate juanna answer draw
the shaft out of the ground we have had a narrow escap
leonard did not speak but rais hi rifl he fire it at a ventur in
the direct whenc the arrow had sped then he ran to put their littl
band in a posit of defenc juanna follow him but as it chanc
he might have spare himself the troubl for noth further happen
inde the net outward and visibl result of thi mysteri apparit
wa that thei spent a miser night wait in the fog and wetfor
it had come on to rain or rather drizzlefor an enemi who to their
intens relief never appear
but the inward and spiritu consequ were much greater for now
thei knew that soa spoke truth and that the legend of the bushmen as to
great men cover with hair wa no mere savag invent
at length the morn came it wa damp and wretch and thei were
all half starv with cold and oppress by fear inde some of
the settlement men were so terrifi that thei openli lament
have suffer their sens of shame and loyalti to overcom their
determin to retreat now thei could not do so for the malcont
among them did not dare to retrac their step alon moreov leonard
spoke plainli on the matter tell them that he would drive awai the
first man who attempt ani insubordin
soak through shiver and miser thei pursu their march
across the unknown plain soa who seem to grow hourli grimmer now
that she wa in her own countri stalk ahead of them as guid it
wa warmer walk than sit still and in on respect their lot wa
better for a littl wind stir the mist from time to time reveal
gleam of the wateri sun all that dai thei journei on see no
more of the man who had shot the arrow or hi fellow till at length
dark drew near again
then thei halt and leonard and otter walk to and fro search
for a suitabl place to make the camp and pitch their solitari tent
present otter shout aloud leonard ran toward him and found him
stare into the mist at someth that loom larg about a hundr
yard awai
look baa he said there is a hous a hous of stone with grass
grow on the roof
nonsens said leonard it must be some more boulder howev we
can soon find out
thei crept cautious toward the object that as soon becam evid
wa a hous or a veri good apolog for on built of huge undress
boulder bed in turf by wai of mortar and roof with the trunk
of small tree and a thick thatch of sod whereon the grass grew green
thi build mai have measur forti feet in length by twenti in depth
and seventeen from the groundlin to the wallplat also it had
a doorwai of remark height and two windowplac but all these
open were unclos except by curtain of hide which hung befor
them leonard call soa and ask her what the place wa
doubtless the hous of a herdsman she answer who is set here to
watch the cattl of the king or of the priest it mai chanc that thi
is the dwell of that man who shot the arrow yesterdai
have assur themselv that here wa a human habit it remain
to be ascertain whether it wa tenant after wait awhil to see
if anyon pass in or out otter undertook thi task go down on hi
hand and knee he crept up to the wall then along it to the doorwai
and after listen there awhil he lift a corner of the hide curtain
and peep into the interior present he rose sai
all right baa the place is empti
then thei both enter and examin the dwell with curios it
wa rude enough the wall were unplast and the damp stream down
them the floor wa of trodden mud and a hole in the roof serv as
a chimnei but by wai of compens the intern space wa divid
into two apart on of them a live room and the other a sleep
chamber it wa evid that the place had not been long desert for
fire still smoulder on the hearth round which stood variou earthen
cook dish and in the sleepingroom wa a rough bedstead of wood
whereon lai wrap made from the hide of cattl and goat when
thei had seen everyth there wa to be seen thei hurri back to the
other to report their discoveri and just then the rain set in more
heavili than befor
a hous said juanna then for good sake let us get into it we
ar all half dead with the cold and wet
ye answer leonard i think we had better take possess though
it mai be a littl awkward if the right owner come back
the best that can be said for the night which thei spent in thi stone
shanti undisturb by ani visit from it law tenant is that it
pass a shade more comfort than it would have done outsid thei
were dry though the place wa damp and thei had a fire still until
you ar us to it it is try to sit in the compani of a score of
black peopl and of mani thousand flea envelop with a cloud of
pungent smoke accord to the custom of our nors ancestor
soon juanna gave up the attempt and retir to the great bed in the
inner chamber wonder much who had occupi it last a herdsman
she judg as soa had suggest for in a corner of the room stood an
oxgoad huge fashion but it wa a bed and she slept as soundli in
it as it numer insect occup would allow the other were not so
fortun thei had the insect inde but no bed
again the morn came wet miser and misti and through the mist
and rain thei pursu their cours whither thei knew not all dai thei
wander on by the bank of the river till night fell and thei
camp thi time without shelter now thei had reach the extrem of
wretched for thei had littl or no food left and could not find
fuel to make a fire leonard took soa asid and question her for he
saw clearli that a coupl more dai of thi suffer would put an end
to all of them
you sai these peopl of your have a citi soa
thei have a citi deliver she answer but whether thei will
allow you to enter it except as a victim for sacrific is anoth
matter
none of us will enter it unless we find shelter soon he answer
how far is the place awai
it should be a dai journei deliver were the mist gone you could
see it now the citi is built at the foot of great mountain there ar
none higher but the fog hide everyth tomorrow if it lift you
will see that i speak truth
ar there ani hous near where we can shelter he ask again
how can i tell she answer it is forti year sinc i pass
thi road and here where the land is barren none dwell except the
herdsmen perhap there is a hous at hand or perhap there is none for
mani mile who can sai
find that soa could give no further inform leonard return to
the other and thei huddl themselv togeth for warmth on the
wet ground as best thei might and sat out the hour in silenc not
attempt to sleep the settlement men were numb with cold and juanna
also wa overcom for the first time though she tri hard to be
cheer francisco and leonard heap their own blanket on her
pretend that thei had found spare on but the wrap were wring
wet and gave her littl comfort soa alon did not appear to suffer
perhap becaus it wa her nativ climat and otter kept hi spirit
which neither heat nor cold nor hunger seem to affect
while my heart is warm i am warm he said cheerfulli when leonard
ask him how he fare as for leonard himself he sat silent listen
to the moan of the settlement men and reflect that twentyfour
hour more of thi miseri would bring the troubl of most of them to an
end without food or shelter it wa veri certain that few of those aliv
tonight would live to see a second dawn
at last the light came and to their wonder and exceed joi thei found
that the rain had ceas and the mist wa melt
onc more thei beheld the face of the sun and rejoic in it warmth
as onli those can rejoic who for dai and night have live in
semidark wet to the skin and frozen to the marrow
the worst of the mist wa gone inde but it wa not until thei had
breakfast off a buck which otter shot in the reed by the river that
the linger veil of vapour withdrew themselv from the more distant
landscap at last thei had vanish and for the first time the
wander saw the land through which thei were travel thei stood
upon a vast plain that slope upward gradual till it end at the
foot of a mighti rang of snowcap mountain name as thei learn
in afterdai the bina mountain
thi rang wa shape like a halfmoon or a bent bow and the nearest
point of the curv form by a soar snowi peak wa exactli opposit
to them and to all appear not more than fiveandtwenti mile awai
on either side of thi peak the unbroken line of mountain reced with
a vast and majest sweep till the ey could follow them no more the
plain about them wa barren and everywher strewn with granit boulder
between which wander herd of wild cattl mix with group of
antelop but the lower slope of the mountain were cloth with dens
junip forest and among them were clear presum of cultiv
land otter search the scene with hi ey that were as those of a
hawk then said quietli
look yonder baa the old hag ha not li to us there is the citi of
the peopl of the mist
follow the line of the dwarf outstretch hand leonard saw what
had at first escap him that stand back in a wide bend at the foot
of the great mountain in front of them were a multitud of hous built
of grei stone and roof with green turf inde had not hi attent
been call to it the town might well have miss observ until
he wa quit close to it wall for the materi of which it wa
construct resembl those of the boulder that lai about them in
thousand and the vivid green of it roof gave it the appear of a
distant space of grassi land
ye there is the kraal of the great peopl said otter again and
it is a strong kraal see baa thei know how to defend themselv the
mountain is behind them that none can climb and all around their wall
the river run join itself togeth again on the plain beyond it
would go ill with the impi which tri to take that kraal
for a while thei all stood still and stare amaz it seem strang
that thei should have reach thi fabl citi and now that thei
were there how would thei be receiv within it wall thi wa the
question which each on of them wa ask of himself there wa but on
wai to find outthei must go and see no retreat wa now possibl
even the settlement peopl felt thi better to die at the hand of
the great men said on of them aloud than to perish miser in the
mist and cold
be of good cheer leonard answer you ar not yet dead the sun
shine onc more it is a happi omen
when thei had rest and dri their cloth thei march on with
a certain sens of relief there befor them wa the goal thei had
travel so far to win soon thei would know the worst that could
befal and anyth wa better than thi long suspens
by middai thei had cover about fifteen mile of ground and could now
see the citi clearli it wa a great town surround by a cyclopean
wall of boulder about which the river ran on everi side form a
natur moat the build within the wall seem to be arrang in
street and to be build on a plan similar to that of the hous in
which thei had slept two night befor the vast conglomer of
grasscov roof give the citi the appear of a broken field of
turf hillock support upon wall of stone
for the rest the place wa laid out upon a slope and at it head
immedi beneath the sheer step of the mountain side stood two
edific veri much larger in size than ani of those below on of these
resembl the other hous in construct and wa surround by a
separ enclosur but the second which wa place on higher ground
so far as thei could judg at that distanc wa roofless and had all
the characterist of a roman amphitheatr at the far end of thi
amphitheatr stood a huge mass of polish rock bear a grotesqu
resembl to the figur of a man
what ar those build soa ask leonard
the lower on is the hous of the king white man and that abov is
the templ of deep water where the river rise from the bowel of the
mountain
and what is the black stone beyond the templ
that white man is the statu of the god who sit there for ever
watch over the citi of hi peopl
he must be a great god said leonard allud to the size of the
statu
he is great she answer and my heart is afraid at the sight of
him
after rest for two hour thei march on again and soon it becam
appar that their movement were watch the roadwai which thei were
followingif a track beaten flat by the feet of men and cattl could be
call a roadwound to and fro between boulder of rock and here and
there stand upon the boulder were men clad in goatskin each of
them carri a spear a bow and a horn so soon as their parti came
within five or six hundr yard of on of these men he would shoot
an arrow in their direct which when pick up prove to be barb
with iron and flight with red feather like the first that thei had
seen then the sentri would blow hi horn either as a signal or in
token of defianc bound from the rock and vanish thi did not look
encourag but there wa wors to come present as thei drew near
to the citi thei descri larg bodi of arm men cross the river
that surround it in boat and on raft and muster on the hither
side at length all of them were across and the regiment which
appear to number more than a thousand men form up in a hollow
squar and advanc upon them at the doubl
the crisi wa at hand
chapter xx
the come of aca
leonard turn and look at hi companion with someth like dismai
written on hi face
what is to be done now he said
we must wait for them until thei come near answer juanna then
otter and i ar to meet them alon and i will sing the song which
soa ha taught me do not be afraid i have learn my lesson and if
thing go right thei will think that we ar their lost god or at
least so soa sai

rate i must get readi for the experi come soa bring the bundl
to those rock over therequick stop a minutei forgot mr outram
you must lend me that rubi i have to make us of it
leonard hand over the rubi reflect that he would probabl never
see it again sinc it seem almost certain that on of the great
peopl would steal it howev at the moment he wa think of that
which wa far abov rubi name of what chanc thei had of escap
with their live
so soon as she had possess of the stone juanna ran to a littl ring
of boulder that were scatter on the plain about fifti pace from
them follow by soa who carri a bundl in her hand
ten minut pass and soa appear from behind the shelter of the
stone and beckon to them advanc in obedi to her summon
thei saw a curiou sight stand in the ring of rock wa juanna
but juanna transform she wore a white robe cut low upon the neck and
shoulder inde it wa the arab dress in which she had escap from
the slave camp that soa had brought with them in prepar for thi
moment of trial nor wa thi all for juanna had loosen her dark
hairwhich wa of great length and unusu beautyso that it hung
about her almost to her knee and upon her forehead gleam like a
red ey wa set the great rubi ingeni fasten thereto by soa in
a band of linen pierc in it centr to the size of the stone
behold the goddess and do homag said juanna with mock solemn
although leonard could see that she wa trembl with excit
i do not quit understand what you ar go to do but you look the
part well he answer shortli and inde until that moment he had
never known how beauti she wa
juanna blush a littl at the evid admir in hi ey then
turn to the dwarf she said
now otter you must make readi too and rememb what soa told you
whatev you see or hear you ar not to open your mouth walk side by
side with me and do as i do that is all
otter grunt in assent and proceed to make readi the process wa
simpl consist onli in the shed of hi coat and trousersan old
pair of leonard veri much cut downwhich left him nake except for
a moocha that he wore beneath them in accord with nativ custom
what doe all thi mean ask the headman peter who like hi
companion wa trembl with fear
it mean said juanna that otter and i ar imperson the god of
thi peopl peter if thei receiv us as god it is well if not we
ar doom be care should we be so receiv lest ani of you betrai
the trick be wise and silent i sai and do what we shall tell you from
time to time if you would live to look upon the sun
peter fell back astonish while leonard and francisco turn their
attent to the approach soldier of the peopl of the mist
thei advanc slowli and in silenc but their measur tread shook
the earth at last thei halt about a hundr and fifti yard awai
present a truli terrifi spectacl to the littl band among the
rock so far as leonard could see there wa not a man among them
who stood less than six feet in height and thei were broad in
proportionhug made in appear thei were neither handsom nor
repuls but solemnlook largeei thickhairedbetween black
and yellow in hueand wear an express of dread calm like
the calm of an archaic statu for the rest thei seem to be well
disciplin each compani be under the command of a captain who
in addit to hi arm carri a trumpet fashion from a wild bull
horn
the regiment stood silent gaze at the group of stranger or rather
at the boulder behind which thei were conceal in the centr of their
hollow squar wa a knot of men on of them young and huge even in
comparison with hi companion thi man leonard took to be a chief or
king behind were orderli and counsellor and befor him three ag
person of state appear and a cruel cast of counten these men
were nake to the waist and unarm except for a knife or hanger fix
at the girdl on their broad breast cover more than half the
skinsurfac the head of a huge snake wa tattoo in vivid blue
evid thei were medicinemen or priest
while the adventur watch and wonder the king or chief issu an
order to hi attend who ran to the corner of the squar and call
it aloud then he rais hi great spear and everi captain blew upon
hi horn make a deafen sound
now the enemi stood still for a while stare toward the stone
and the three medicinemen drew near to the chief in the centr of the
squar and talk with him as though debat what should be done
thi is our chanc said juanna excitedli if onc thei attack us it
will be all over a singl vollei of arrow would kill everi on of us
come otter
no no said leonard i am afraid of your ventur yourself among
those savag the danger is too great
danger can the danger be more than it is here in a minut we mai all
be dead nonsens i will go i know what to do and have made up my
mind to it do not fear for me rememb that if the worst come to the
worst i have the mean to protect myself you ar not afraid to come

no shepherdess said the dwarf here all road ar alik
leonard thought awhil bitterli did he reproach himself in that he had
been the caus of lead hi ward into such a posit but now
there wa no help for itsh must go and after all it could make no
differ if she were kill or captur five minut henc or half an
hour later but francisco who could not take such a philosoph view
of the situat implor her not to ventur herself alon among those
horribl savag

importun if anyth happen i will try to aveng you befor i
follow go but forgiv me
what have i to forgiv she said look at him with shine ey
did you not onc dare a greater danger for me
ye go shepherdess said soa who till now had been stare with all
her ey at the three ag men in the centr of the squar there is
littl to fear if thi fool of a dwarf will but keep hi tongu silent
i know my peopl and i tell you that if you sing that song and sai
the word which i have taught you you and the black on here shall be
proclaim god of the land but be swift for the soldier ar about to
shoot
as soa spoke leonard saw that the confer in the squar had come to
an end the messeng were call command to the captain which the
captain repeat to the soldier and then follow a mighti rattl
of quiver anoth instant and the light shone upon mani hundr of
arrowhead everi on of which wa point toward them
juanna saw also and spring forward on to a rock stood there for a
moment in the full glare of the sun instantli a murmur went up from the
host a great voic call a command the barb of steel flicker like
innumer star and sank downward
now otter nake except for hi moocha sprang on to the rock by
juanna side and the murmur of the soldier of the great peopl grew
into a hoars roar of astonish and dismai wonder had turn to
fear though why thi multitud of warrior should fear a love white
girl and a black dwarf wa not appar
for a moment the illassort pair stood togeth on the rock then
juanna leapt to the plain otter follow her for twenti yard or so
she walk in silenc hold the dwarf by the hand then suddenli she
burst into sing wild and sweet thi wa the refrain of the sacr
song which she sang in the ancient languag of the peopl of the mist
the tongu that soa had taught her as a child
i do but sleep

through the still air like the song of a bird in winter hush were the
compani of the great men as she drew toward them with slow glide
stepshush with fear and wonder as though her presenc awok a
memori or fulfil a promis
now she wa in front of their foremost rank and halt there wa
silent for a moment then she chang her song
will ye not greet me children of my children
have ye forgotten the promis of the dead
shall i return to the dreamland whenc i wander
will ye refus me the mother of the snake
the soldier look upon on anoth and murmur each to each now she
saw that thei understood her word and were terrorstricken by them
for anoth moment there wa silenc then suddenli the three priest or
medicinemen who had drawn near togeth pass through the rank and
stood befor her accompani by the warriorchief
then on of them the most ag a man who must have number nineti
year spoke in the midst of an intens silenc to juanna joi as

same that soa taught her mani year befor and in which for the sake
of practic thei had alwai convers togeth for the last two month

have spoken thu with much digniti accompani by otter whose hand
she held as befor juanna withdrew herself step backward veri
slowli toward the circl of rock and sing as she went
chapter xxi
the folli of otter
juanna and otter gain the circl of rock where the littl band lai
watch and wonderstruck that is all except soa who sat apart
brood her arm clasp upon her breast thing had befallen as
she expect as thei must befal inde provid that juanna did not
forget her lesson or show fear and that the dwarf did noth foolish
but soa knew well enough that thi wa but the begin of the
struggl and that though it might be compar easi for juanna
and otter to enter the citi and impos themselv upon it
superstitionhaunt peopl as the incarn of their fabl god
the mainten of the impostur wa a veri differ matter moreov
she knew should thei be discov that escap would be imposs or
at the best that it must be most difficult therefor she sat apart and
brood for notwithstand their present triumph her heart forebod
evil
but with the other it wa differ thei had heard the sing thei
had seen the regiment of great men prostrat themselv and the sound
of worship had come to their ear like thunder but of the why and
wherefor of it all thei could onli guess
what ha happen said leonard eagerli your initi seem to
have come off well
bid the men fall back and i will tell you juanna answer
leonard did so but instead of speak she broke into hyster
laughter her nerv had been overstrain and now thei sought relief
thu
you must all be veri respect to otter and myself she said at
length for we realli ar godsdont look shock francisco i begin
to believ in it myself we have onli just found it out but i assur
you it is a fact thei accept us fulli and that after not more than
five minut crossexamin listen and she told them all that had
pass
while she wa speak the regiment began to move no longer in a
squar but in a format of compani compani by compani it rush
past them shake the earth with it footstep and as each section
went by it toss it spear into the air as a salut cry glori to
the mother glori to the snake and fled on toward the citi
at length the stori wa done and the regiment wa gone
well said leonard so far so good juanna you ar the bravest and
cleverest girl in the whole world most young women would have forgotten
everyth and gone into hyster at the critic point
i kept them till afterward she answer demur and as for be
brave and clever i onli repeat what soa taught me like a parrot
you see i knew that i should be kill if i made ani mistak and such
knowledg sharpen the memori all i have to sai is if the snake thei
talk so much about is anyth like those which ar tattoo upon the
old priest breast i have no wish to make a nearer acquaint with
it i hate snake there dont sai ani morefor both leonard and
francisco were break out into fresh protest of gratitud and
admir if you want to thank anybodi thank soa
and so i do said leonard heartili for hi spirit had risen in a
most wonder manner soa you have told us the truth and you have
manag well and i thank you
did you then take me for a liar the woman answer fix her gloomi
ey upon leonard face i told you the truth deliver when i said
that my peopl would accept the shepherdess and thi black dog of your
as their god but did i not tell you also that the death of the rest of
us li in the matter if not i sai so now you have not been name a
god deliver nor ha yonder baldpateth nativ call francisco
thu becaus of hi tonsureand your black dog will betrai you by hi
yap when you look down the jaw of the snake rememb then that
soa told you the truth deliver perchanc you shall find the red
stone you seek hidden in hi belli white man
be silent said juanna indignantli and soa slunk back like a whip
hound
confound the old woman put in leonard with a shiver she is a black
jonah and if i have to go insid thi snake i hope that it will be a
case of ladi first that is all
i am sure i dont know what ha happen to soa said juanna her
nativ air ha a veri bad effect upon her temper
well the futur must look after itself answer leonard snake or
no snake at present we must follow our luck otter listen to me do
you understand that you ar a god the god of thi peopl
the god baa what is a god
have i not told you thickhead you ar not a man ani more you ar a
spirit onc so it seem you rule thi peopl in the past and now
you will rule them again you and the shepherdess ar both god she is
your mother and you ar her child
ye baa no doubt but onc i had anoth mother a much uglier on
otter ceas to talk folli els when you ar no more a god i will
beat you now you ar a god and we ar all your servant except the
shepherdess when you speak to us you must speak roughli like a great
chief to the lowest of hi peopl call us dog and slave if you
name me baa in public i will beat you privat when you ar no more
a god you will do best to speak littl or not at all so that none can
take hold of your word which ar alwai foolish
if you sai that i am a god baa it is enough for doubtless you have
met the god and know their wai though it is strang that none have
told me thi befor thei must be an ugli peopl the god but how will
it be with the settlement men when thei hear that i am a great spirit
thei will sai doe a spirit wait upon a man and call him chief doe
a spirit clean the gun and cook the food of a man thei will ask mani
such thing and the great peopl will hear them and will thei think
then that i am a god no thei will know me for a liar and will kill me
and all of us
that is true said leonard then he summon peter and the settlement
men and address them he told them that the plot had succeed and
that otter and the shepherdess were accept as the god of the peopl
of the mist becaus of thi thei were left aliv and held in honour
who but for it would now be dead riddl through with the arrow of
the great peopl he explain to them for the second time that it wa
necessari to the safeti of all that thi delus as to the divin of
otter and the shepherdess should be maintain sinc if the slightest
suspicion of the fraud cross the mind of the great peopl without
doubt thei would all be sacrif as impostor
thi wa the tale that thei must tellthei should sai that all of them
were hunt game in a far countri with himself soa and francisco
when on night thei heard a sing and by the light of the moon thei
saw the shepherdess and the dwarf otter come toward them then the
shepherdess and otter command them to be their servant and travel
with them to a new land and thei obei them black and white togeth
for thei saw that thei were not mortalsthi wa the tale that thei
must tell moreov thei must act up to their word if thei would
continu to look upon the sun
but their first surpris wa past the settlement men who were
quickwit peopl enter into the spirit of the plot readili enough
inde peter caus them to repeat the stori to him so that he might
be sure that thei had it detail by heart
then thei continu their march toward the citi on the hill the two
white men went first next came juanna and otter follow by soa and
last of all walk the settlement men an hour journei brought them to
the bank of the river which divid abov it engirdl the town to
reunit near the roadwai that thei follow here cano were readi to
take them across to the island or rather the peninsula on which
the citi wa built on the other side of the river thei found priest
wait in the great gatewai with two litter that had been prepar for
juanna and otter respect thi the further bank wa line with
some thousand of spectat who when the divin pair set their feet
upon it shore prostrat themselv men women and children and
burst into a shout of welcom
juanna and otter took no heed with such digniti as thei could command
and in the dwarf case it wa not much thei enter the litter
drew the hide curtain and were born forward swiftli after them came
leonard francisco and the other while the popul follow in
silenc
now the sun wa sink but enough of daylight wa left to show how
strang were the place and the peopl among which thei found themselv
the citi inde wa rude built of like materi and in similar
fashion to the hous in the plain that ha been describ alreadi but
the street were roughli pave each habit stood apart from the
other in it own garden and the gate were of wood fasten togeth
with primit iron bolt there were drinkingshop or rather booth
and a larg marketplac which thei cross as thei ascend the hill
and where as thei afterward discov thi peopl carri on their
trade if trade it could be call for thei had no monei and conduct
all transact like other savag upon a principl of barter
as thei went leonard took note of these thing which to hi mind
show clearli that the inhabit of thi citi were the degener
inheritor of some ancient and forgotten civilis their

everi minut he pacifi them as well as he could and left them with
the assur that he would return present have first remind them
that the live of all depend upon the mainten of the delus as
to the divin of otter and the shepherdess
the remaind of that dai pass heavili enough after the first
excit of their strang posit had gone by a reaction set in and
everybodi wa much depress as the hour drew on the mist which had
lift a littl about ten oclock close in veri dens throw
the illlight chamber where thei sat into a deep gloom in such an
atmospher convers languish inde at time it di altogeth
and the onli sound to be heard wa that of the monoton voic of the
priest without the curtain as thei mutter prayer unceasingli at
length leonard could bear it no longer but rose declar that he
wa go out to see whatev might be seen juanna tri faintli to
dissuad him and otter wish to come too which wa imposs the
end of it wa that he went alon
first he revisit the settlement men and tri to cheer them and sadli
did thei need cheer then he pass to the great gate of the palac
yard and look through them the mist had lift a littl and about a
hundr pace awai he could perceiv the door of the templ on either
side of which rose cyclopean wall fifti feet or more in height it wa
obviou that here prepar for some ceremoni were in progress and
on a larg scale for immens crowd of peopl were gather about the
door through which bodi of priest and arm men pass continu
more he could not learn for the gate of the palac yard were bar

them watch till sunset then return to the other he told them
what he had seen
anoth hour pass and suddenli the curtain were drawn asid and a
bodi of priest enter twelv in number bear larg candl of fat
in their hand and head by their chief nam prostrat themselv
befor juanna and otter thei remain plung in silenc
speak on said juanna at length
we come o mother and o snake said the priest nam to lead you to
the templ that the peopl mai look upon their god

first you must be robe mother said nam for without the templ
none mai look upon your divin save your priest alon
rise as he spoke he produc a black dress from a grass bag which
wa carri by an attend thi dress wa veri curiou it fasten in
front with button of horn and either wa or seem to be woven in a
singl piec from the softest hair of blackfleec goat moreov it
had sleev just long enough to leav the hand of the wearer visibl
and beneath it peak cap wa a sort of mask with three slit two for
the ey and on for the mouth
juanna retir to put on thi hideou garment over her white robe and
reappear present look like the black ghost of a mediaev monk
then the priest gave her two flower a red lili and a white to be
held in either hand and it appear that her equip wa complet
next thei came to otter and bound a scarlet fring of hair about hi
forehead in such fashion that the fring hid hi ey at the same
time place in hi hand a sceptr of ivori appar of veri ancient
workmanship and fashion in the shape of a snake stand on it tail
all is prepar said nam
lead on answer juanna again but let our servant come with us
both those here and those without save the woman onli who stai to
make readi for our return
juanna spoke thu becaus soa had announc her wish to be left behind
when thei went to the templ juanna had consult leonard on the
subject who gave it as hi opinion that soa had good reason of her own
for make thi request also he point out that in case of disturb
she could scarc help them and might possibl prove an encumbr
thei wait answer nam all is prepar for them also and as he
spoke a sardon smile flicker on hi wither counten that made
leonard feel veri uncomfort what wa prepar he wonder
thei pass through the curtain into the courtyard where soldier
clad in goatskin cloak wait with two litter here also were
the settlement men arm but in an extrem of fear for thei were
guard by about fifti of the great peopl also arm
juanna and otter enter the litter behind which leonard form up hi
littl band go in front of it himself with francisco both of them
have rifl in their hand and revolv at their girdl of which no
attempt wa made to depriv them for none knew their us
then thei start surround by the barebreast priest who chant
and wave torch as thei walk and preced and follow by the
grim file of tall soldier on whose spear the torchlight flash
omin as thei came the gate of the palac yard were open thei
pass them and across the space beyond until thei reach the door of
the templ which were thrown wide befor them
here otter and juanna descend from the litter and all the torch
were extinguish leav them in dark
leonard felt hi hand seiz and wa led along he knew not where for
the misti gloom wa intens he could scarc see the face even of
the priest who conduct them but from the sound he gather that all
their parti were be guid in a similar fashion onc or twice also
he heard the voic of a settlement man speak in accent of fear or
complaint but such demonstr were follow quickli by the sound
of a heavi blow dealt no doubt by the priest or soldier in charg of
that individu evid it wa expect that all should be silent
present leonard becam awar that thei had left the open space across
which thei were walk for the air grew close and their footstep rang
hollow on the rocki floor
i believ that we ar in a tunnel whisper francisco
silenc dog hiss a priest in hi ear silenc thi place is
holi
thei did not understand the mean of the word at the moment but the
tone in which thei were spoken made their purport suffici clear
leonard took the hint and at the same time clutch hi rifl more
tightli he began to be afraid for their safeti whither were thei be
ledto a dungeon well thei would soon know and at the worst it wa
not probabl that these barbarian would harm juanna thei follow
the tunnel or passag for about a hundr and fifti pace at first it
slope downward then the floor becam level till at length thei began
to ascend a stair there were sixtyon stone step in thi stairwai
for leonard count them each about ten inch high and when all were
climb thei advanc eleven pace along a tunnel that echo strang
to their step and wa so low that thei must bend their head to pass
it emerg from thi tunnel through a narrow open thei stood upon
a platform also of stone and onc more the chill night air fan their
brow
so dens wa the gloom that leonard could tell noth of the place
where thei might be but from far beneath them rose a hiss sound
as of seeth water and combin with it anoth sound of faint
murmur as though thousand of peopl whisper each to each also
from time to time he heard a rustl like that of a forest when
a gentl wind stir it leav or the rustl of the robe of
innumer women
thi sens of the presenc of hidden water and of an unseen multitud
wa strang and terrifi in the extrem it wa as though without
perceiv them their human faculti suddenli becam awar of the
spirit of the unnumb dead throng watch followingther
but intang speak without word touch without hand
leonard wa tempt to cry aloud so great wa the strain upon hi
nerv which usual were strong enough nor wa he alon in thi
desir present a sound aros from below him as of some person in
hyster and he heard a priest command silenc in a fierc voic
the sob and laughter went on till it culmin in a shrill scream
after the scream came the thud of a blow a heavi fall a groan and
onc again the invis multitud whisper and rustl
someon ha been kill mutter francisco in leonard ear who is
it i wonder
leonard shudder but made no answer for a great hand wa place upon
hi mouth in warn
at length the portent silenc wa broken and a voic spoke the voic
of nam the priest in the silenc all that he utter could be heard
plainli but hi word came from far awai and the sound of them wa
still and small thi wa what he said as juanna told it to them after
the ceremoni
hear me ye children of the snake ye ancient peopl of the mist
hearken to me nam the priest of the snake mani a gener gone in
the begin of time so run the legend the mother goddess whom we
worship from of old descend from heaven and came hither to us and
with her came the snake her child while she tarri in the land the
crime of crime wa wrought the dark slew the daylight and she
pass henc we know not how or where and from that hour the land ha
been a land of mist and it peopl have wander in the mist for he
whose name is dark ha rule over them answer their prayer with
death but thi doom wa on the snake that becaus of hi wicked he
must put off the flesh of men and descend into the holi place of water
where as we and our father have known hi symbol dwell etern
take tribut of the live of men
yet er that crime wa wrought the mother gave a word of promis to her
peopl now that i am about to die at the hand of him i bore for so
it is fate she said but not for ever do i leav you and not for
ever shall the snake be punish by put off the flesh of men mani
gener shall go by and we will return again and rule over you and
the veil of mist shall be lift from your land and ye shall be great
in the earth till then choos you king and let them govern you
moreov forget not my worship and see to it that throughout the ag
the altar of the snake is wet with blood and that he lack not the food
he love and i will give you a sign by which we shall be known when at
length the fate is accomplish and the hour of forgiv is at hand
as a fair maid will i come again a maid love and white but becaus
of hi sin the snake shall appear in the shape of that which sit within
your templ and hi hue shall be black and hi face hideou out of the
earth will we aris and we will call to you and ye shall know us and
we will tell you our holi name that shall not be spoken aloud from
thi hour to that hour of our come but bewar lest ye be deceiv
and fals god set themselv up among you for then shall the last evil
fall upon you and the sun shall hide hi face
thu children of the mist did the mother speak to him who wa her
chief priest in the long ago and he grave her word with iron on the
stone of that whereon i stand but none can read that write for it
secret is lost to us although the propheci remain and now the time is
full and it ha been given to me hi successor in my old ag to see
the fulfil of the sai
the time is full and thi night the promis of the past is
accomplish for peopl of the mist the immort god whose name
ar holi have appear to rule their children yesterdai thei came
ye saw them and in your ear thei call aloud the sacr name as a
maiden fair and white and as a dwarf black and hideou have thei
come and aca is the name of the maiden and jal is the name of the
dwarf
he ceas and hi voic di awai in the echo of the great place
onc again there wa silenc broken onli by the seeth sound of
water and the indefin murmur of an unseen throng beneath
leonard stood awhil then edg himself gentli forward with the design
of discov where and upon what thei were stand hi curios
soon met with a violent check for befor he had gone a yard he felt
that hi right foot wa dangl in space and it wa onli by a strong
effort that he prevent himself from fall whither he knew not
recov hi balanc he shuffl himself back again to the side of
francisco and whisper a warn to him not to move if he valu hi
life as leonard spoke he notic that the black of the night
wa turn grei with the light of the unrisen moon alreadi her rai
strike upward brighten the sky abov and the mountain behind
and from them fell a pale reflect which grew gradual stronger and
clearer
now he could discov that close upon him to the left a black mass
tower high into the air and that far beneath him gleam someth
like the foam on broken water for a time he watch thi water or
whatev it might be until a smother exclam from francisco
caus him to look up again as he look the edg of the moon rose
abov the templ wall and by slow degre a wonder sight wa
reveal to him not till the moon wa fulli visibl did he see
everyth and to describ all as he discov it piecem would be
difficult thi wa what leonard saw at length
befor him and underneath him lai a vast and roofless build open to
the east cover some two acr of ground and surround by titan
wall fifti feet or more in height thi build wa shape like a
roman amphitheatr but with the except of the space immedi
below him it area wa fill with stone seat and round it wide
circumfer stone seat rose tier on tier these were all occupi by
men and women in hundr and except at the further end scarc a
place wa empti at the western extrem of the templ a huge statu
tower seventi or eighti feet into the air hewn to all appear
from a mass of live rock behind thi colossu and not more than
a hundr pace from it the sheer mountain rose precipic upon
precipic to the foot of a white peak clad in etern snow it wa the
peak that thei had seen from the plain when the mist lift and the
statu wa the dark mass beneath it which had excit their curios
thi fear colossu wa fashion to the shape of a huge dwarf of
hideou counten seat with bent arm outstretch in a forward
direct and palm turn upward as though to bear the weight of the
sky the statu stood or rather sat upon a platform of rock and not
more than four pace from it base so that the outstretch hand and
slightli bow head overhung it inde wa a circular gulf measur
perhap thirti yard across in which seeth water rage and boil
whenc thei came and whither thei went it wa imposs to see but
leonard discov afterward that here wa the sourc of the river
which thei had follow for so mani dai escap from the gulf by
underground passag that it had hollow for itself through the solid
rock the two branch of the torrent pass round the wall of the
town to unit again in the plain below how the pool itself wa
suppli leonard wa destin to learn in after dai
between the steep polish side of the rock basin and the feet of the
statu wa place an altar or sacrifici stone here on thi ledg
which cover an area no greater than that of a small room and in front
of the altar stood a man bound in whom leonard recognis olfan the
king while on either side of him were priest nake to the waist and
arm with knive behind them again stood the littl band of settlement
men trembl with terror nor were their fear groundless for there
among them lai on of their number dead thi wa the man whose nerv
had broken down who shriek aloud in the dark and in reward had
been smitten into everlast silenc
all thi leonard saw by degre but the first thing that he saw ha
not yet been told long befor the brilliant rai of the moon lit the
amphitheatr thei struck upon the huge head of the dwarf idol and
there on thi giddi perch some seventi feet from the ground and
nearli a hundr abov the level of the pool of seeth water sat
juanna herself enthron in an ivori chair she had been divest of
her black cloak and wa clad in the robe of snowi linen cut low upon
her breast and fasten round her waist with a girdl her dark hair
flow about her shoulder in either hand she held the lili red and
white and upon her forehead glow the rubi like a bloodr star she
sat quit still her ey set wide in horror and first the moonlight
gleam upon the gem bound to her forehead next it show the pale and
love face beneath then her snowi arm and breast the white of
her robe and the hideou demon head whereon her throne wa fix
no spirit could have seem more beauti than thi woman set thu
on high in that dark place of blood and fear inde in the unearthli
light she look like a spirit the spirit of beauti triumph over
the hideous of hell the angel of light trampl the devil and hi
work
it wa not wonder that thi fierc and barbar peopl sigh
like reed befor the wind when her loveli dawn upon them made
ether by the moon or that thenceforth leonard could never think of
her quit as he thought of ani other woman under such condit most
wellfavour women would have appear beauti juanna did more she
seem divin
as the light grew downward and the shadow thin befor it leonard
follow with hi ey and present he discov otter the dwarf
nake except for hi girdl and the fring upon hi head wa also
enthron hold the ivori sceptr in hi hand but in a seat of eboni
place upon the knee of the colossu nearli forti feet below juanna
then leonard turn to consid francisco posit and hi own and
found it terribl enough inde the moment that he discov it wa
nigh to be hi last in compani with two priest of the snake thei
were stand on the palm of the right hand of the idol that form a
littl platform some six feet squar which thei had won in the dark
through a tunnel hewn in the arm of stone there thei stood unprotect
by ani rail or support and befor them and on either side of them
wa a sheer drop of some nineti feet to the water beneath or of fifti to
the rock of the platform
leonard saw and for a moment turn faint and dizzi then set the
butt of hi rifl on to the stone he lean upon the barrel till
hi brain clear it wa well for him that he had not known what lai

earth saw but made no movement onli leonard thought that thei smile
grimli and a horribl fear struck hi heart like a breath of ic what
if thei wait a signal to cast him down it might well be so alreadi
he had seen enough of their rite to enabl him to guess that their wa
a religion of blood and human sacrific

dare to keep hi feet but sank into a sit postur rest hi back
against the stone of the idol thumb
chapter xxiii

still the silenc endur and still the moonlight grew creep lower
and lower till it shone upon the face of the seeth water and
except in the immedi shadow of the wall all the amphitheatr wa
full of it
then the voic of nam spoke again from far awai and leonard look to
see whenc he spoke now he saw nam attend by three priest wa
perch like an eagl on the left palm of the colossu and from thi
dizzi platform he address the multitud look across the breast of
the statu leonard could just see the outstretch arm and the fierc

then nam spoke again sai bring forth the virgin that fair maid
who is destin to the snake that he mai look upon her and accept her
as hi wife bring her forth also who twelv month gone wa vow in
marriag to the shape of stone that she mai bid her lord farewel
as he spoke there wa a stir behind the idol and present from each
side of it a woman wa led forward by two priest on to the littl space
of rock between it feet and the edg of the gulf and place on to the
right of the altar and on to the left both these women were tall and
love with the dark and somewhat terrifi beauti of the peopl of the
mist but there the resembl between them end she to the right wa
nake except for a girdl of snakeskin and the cover of her abund
hair which wa crown with a wreath of red lili similar to the
flower that the priest had given to juanna she to the left on the
contrari wa cloth in a black robe round which wa broider the
shape of a bloodr snake whose head rest upon her breast leonard
notic that the appear of thi woman wa that of extrem terror
for she shrank and trembl wherea that of the flowercrown bride
wa jubil and even haughti
for a moment the two women stood still while the peopl gaze upon them
then at a signal from nam she who wa crown with flower wa led
befor the altar and thrice she bow the knee to the idol or rather
to otter who sat upon it now all ey were fix on the dwarf who
stare at the girl but made no sign which wa not wonder see
that he had no inkl of the mean of the ceremoni as it chanc
he could not have act more wise at least in the interest of the
bride for here as elsewher silenc wa held to give consent
behold the god accept cri nam the beauti of the maid is
pleas in hi ey stand asid saga the bless that the peopl
mai look upon you and know you hail to you wife of the snake
smile triumphantli the girl move back to her place by the altar and
turn her proud face to the peopl then the multitud shout
hail to you bride of the snake hail to you the bless chosen of
the god
while the tumult still last the woman who wa clad in the black robe
wa led forward and when it had di awai she also made her obeis
befor the idol
awai with her that she mai seek her lord in hi own place cri nam
awai with her her dai is done echo the multitud then befor
juanna could interfer befor she could even speak for be it
rememb she alon understood all that wa said the two priest who
guard the doom woman rent the robe from her and with on swing of
their strong arm hurl her backward far into the pool of seeth
water
she fell with a shriek and lai float on their surfac flung thi wai
and that by the eddi of the whirlpool just where the moonlight beat most
brightli all who could of the multitud bent forward to see her end
and overcom by a fear fascin leonard threw himself on hi
face and crane hi head over the stone of the idol hand watch
also for the girl struggl shape wa almost immedi beneath
him anoth minut and he would have foregon the hope of win the
treasur which he had come so far to seek not to have yield to the
impuls
for as he stare the water beneath the feet of the idol were agit
as a pond is agit by the rush of a pike when he dash at hi prei
then for an instant the light gleam upon a dull enorm shape and
suddenli the head of a crocodil rear itself out of the pool the head
of a crocodil but of such a crocodil as he had never heard or dream
of for thi head alon wa broader than the breast of the biggest man
it dull ey were the size of a man fist it yellow fang were like
the teeth of a lion and from it lower jaw hung tentacl or lump
of white flesh which at that distanc gave it the appear of be
beard like a goat also the skin of thi huge reptil which could
not have measur less than fifti feet in length by four feet in depth
wa here and there corrod into rusti excresc as though some
fungu or lichen had grown upon it like grei moss on an ancient wall
inde it appear seem to point to extrem antiqu
crocodil ar proverbi longliv but leonard could never
discov the ag of thi particular reptil on enquiri he wa abl to
trace it back for three hundr yard and tradit said that it had
alwai dwelt among the peopl of the mist from the begin of time
at least it wa veri old and under the name of the snake had been an
object of worship for mani gener how it came among the peopl of
the mist is difficult to sai for no other specimen appear to exist in
the countri perhap it wa captur in some distant ag and place in
the cave by the priest to figur as an incarn of the snake that
wa the object of their worship
hear the disturb in the water the reptil had emerg from the
cave where it dwelt beneath the feet of the idol to seek it accustom
food which consist of the human victim that were cast to it at
certain interv it rear it hideou head and glare round then of
a sudden the monster and the victim vanish togeth into the depth
sick with horror leonard drew himself back into a sit postur and
glanc up at juanna she wa crouch in her ivori chair overcom and
her ey were close either through faint or to shut out the sight
of dread then he look down at otter the dwarf stare fixedli at
the water sat still as the stone effigi that support him evid
in all hi vari experi he had seen no such thing as thi

taken her who wa hi bride to dwell with him in hi holi hous let the

sacrific of the crown of king be accomplish accord to custom
that the god whose name is jal mai be appeas that he mai listen
to the plead of the mother that the sun mai shine upon us that
fruit mai fill the land and peac be within it gate
thu he cri while leonard felt hi blood turn cold and hi hair rise
upon hi head for though he could not understand the word he guess
their purport and hi instinct told him that a great danger threaten
them he look at the two priest who stood by and thei glare
hungrili on him in answer then hi courag came back to him at least
he had hi rifl and would fight for hi life it must go hard if he
could not put a bullet through on or both of them befor thei got a
hold of him
meanwhil the priest below had seiz the king olfan whose giant form
thei were drag toward the stone of sacrific but of a sudden for
the first time juanna spoke and a deep silenc fell upon the templ and
all within it
hearken peopl of the mist she said and her voic fall from that
great height seem small and far awai although so clear that everi
word wa audibl in the still of the night

child and the on is cloth with beauti the symbol of life and of the

and the evil that walk upon the earth and ye would do sacrific to jal
that he mai be appeas accord to the ancient law and listen to the
plead of the mother that fruit mai fill the land not so shall
jal be appeas and not becaus of the sacrific of men shall aca plead
with him that prosper mai reign in the land
behold the old law is done awai and we give you a new law now is the
hour of reconcili now life and death walk hand in hand and the
heart of aca and jal have grown gentl through the ag and thei
no longer crave the blood of men as an offer to their majesti

my heart and in it shall it not be so my children peopl of the mist
will ye not accept my merci and my love
the multitud watch the red bloom as bruis and broken through the
light and through the shadow thei fell slowli to the seeth surfac
of the pool then it look up like on man and saw the white lili set
upon juanna whiter breast thei saw and move by a common impuls
thei rose with a sound like the rush of the wind and shout
gone is the dai of blood and sacrific come is the dai of peac we
thank you mother and we take your merci and your love
then thei were silent and again there wa a sound like that of the
wind as all their thousand sank back to the seat of stone
now nam spoke again in a voic of furi that rang through the still air
like a clarion
what is thi that my ear hear he cri ar ye mad o ye dweller
in the mist or doe the mother speak with a charm voic shall the
ancient worship be chang in an hour nai not the god themselv can
alter their own worship slai on ye priest slai on or ye yourselv

the priest below heard and seiz the struggl king thei cast him
with difficulti down upon the stone
leonard leonard cri juanna in english address him for the
first time by hi christian name as even then he notic but look
straight befor her that none might guess to whom she spoke these
priest ar go to kill you and all of us except otter and myself if

leonard heard and understood all rest hi back firmli against the
thumb of the statu he shift hi posit a littl so that the group
below him came within hi line of sight and wait watch juanna
who now wa speak again in the languag of the peopl of the mist
thi i promis you minist of blood she said if ye obei me not

servant who ar name deliver and she look down upon leonard
and do my bid if on of these shall dare to lift hi hand against

most of the priest drew back affright but on ruffian lift hi
knife and at that moment juanna point with her hand then leonard
step forward cover the priest great breast with hi rifl as
sure as the uncertain light would allow unconsci of hi danger
the execution mutter an invoc now the knife wa about to fall
upon the throat of olfan when fire and smoke sprang out far abov him
the rifl rang and shot through the heart the priest leap high into
the air and fell dead terror seiz the wit of thi unaccustom

the god speak with flame and thunder on cri and death is in the
flame
silenc dog scream nam ye ar bewitch ho you that stand on
high cast down the wizard who is name deliver and let us see who

then on of the guard who stood by him made a movement to grasp leonard
and throw him down but the other wa terrifi and could not stir the
first man stretch out hi arm but befor it so much as touch it
aim he himself wa dead for see hi purpos leonard had lift the
rifl and onc more it report rang through the templ suddenli the
priest threw hi arm wide then fell backward and with a mighti rush

now for the first time otter emot overcam him he stood up on the
knee of the dwarf and shake the sceptr in hi hand he point
with it to the dead men on the pave below at the same time cry in
stentorian tone
well done baa well done now tumbl the old on yonder off hi

thi speech of otter produc even a greater effect on the spectat
if that were possibl than the mysteri death of the priest that
he whose name wa silenc should cry aloud in a strang tongu of
which thei understood no singl word wa a dread and omin thing
that show hi anger to be deep but leonard took no heed he wa too
engag in cover the second guard with the barrel of hi repeat

no help there long had thei cower beneath him now hope wa born in
their breast and in the presenc of a power greater than hi if
onli for a littl while thei broke hi yoke and the yoke of their red
superstit he look at the compani of priest their heart wa
out of them thei were huddl togeth like knot of frighten sheep
stare at the corps of their two companion then he bethought him
of otter sure there wa refug in the god of blood and evil and he

francisco smile sadli and shook hi head then he knelt and began to

follow held council at dawn in the hous of the priest yonder there
is much stir and talk in the citi but the heart of the peopl ar
light becaus their ancient god have come back to us bring peac

good said juanna then she began to question him artfulli on mani
thing and by degre thei learnt more of the peopl of the mist
it seem as leonard had alreadi guess that thei were a veri ancient
race have exist for countless gener on the same misti upland
plain thei were not howev altogeth isol for occasion
thei made war with other savag tribe but thei never intermarri
with these tribe all the captiv taken in their war be offer
in sacrific at the religi festiv the real govern power in the
commun wa the societi of the priest of the snake who held their
offic by hereditari tenur outsid be admit to their bodi onli
under veri except circumt the council of thi societi chose
the king and when thei were weari of on of them thei sacrif him
and chose anoth either from among hi issu or elsewher thi be
the custom as mai be imagin the relat between church and state
were much strain but hitherto as olfan explain with suppress
rage the church had been suprem
inde the king for the time be wa onli it mouthpiec or
execut offic he led the armi but the superstit of the
peopl and even of the soldier themselv prevent him from wield
ani real power and unless he chanc to die natur hi end wa
nearli alwai the same to be sacrif when the season were bad or
jal wa angri
the countri wa larg but spars popul the fight men number
not more than four thousand of whom about half live in the great citi
the rest occupi villag here and there on the mountain slope as a
rule the peopl were monogam except the priest it wa the custom
of sacrific which kept down the popul to it low level made the
power of the priest absolut and their wealth greater than that of all
the other inhabit of the countri put togeth for thei chose the
victim that had offend against jal or against the mothergoddess and
confisc their possess to the servic of the templ thu the
great herd of halfwild cattl which the travel had seen on the
plain belong to the priest and the priest took a fourth of the
produc of everi man field and gardenthat is when thei did not take
it all and hi life with it
twice in everi year great festiv were held in the templ of jal
at the begin of the spring season and in the autumn after the
ingath of the crop at each of these festiv mani victim were
offer in sacrific some upon the stone and some by be hurl into
the boil pool beneath the statu there to be consum by the snake
or swept down the secret cours of the underground river the feast
celebr in the spring wa sacr to jal and that in the autumn to
the mothergoddess but there wa thi differ between themthat
at the spring ceremoni femal victim onli were sacrif to jal to
propiti him and to avert hi evil influenc while at the autumn
celebr male alon were offer up to the mothergoddess in
gratitud for her gift of plenti also crimin were occasion
thrown to the snake that hi hunger might be satisfi the priest had
other rite olfan ad and these thei would have an opportun of
wit if the spring festiv which should be celebr on the
second dai from that date were held accord to custom
it shall not be celebr said juanna almost fierc
then leonard who had hitherto listen in silenc ask a question
through juanna how is it he said that nam and hi fellow be
alreadi in absolut power were so will to accept the god jal and
aca when thei appear in person see that henceforth thei must obei
not rule
for two reason lord olfan answer first becaus the god ar
god and their servant know them and secondli becaus nam ha of
late stood in danger of lose hi author of all the chief priest
that have been told of nam is the most cruel and the most greedi for
three year he ha doubl the tale of sacrific and though the peopl
love these sight of death thei murmur for none know upon whom the
knife shall fall therefor he wa glad to greet the god come back
sinc he thought that thei would confirm hi power and set him higher
than he sat befor now he is astonish becaus thei proclaim peac
and will have none of the sacrific of men for nam doe not love such
gentl god
yet he shall obei them said otter speak for the first time by the
mouth of juanna who all thi while wa act as interpret or drink
hi own medicin for i myself will sacrific him to myself
when juanna had translat the dwarf bloodthirsti threat olfan bow
hi head meekli and smile clearli the prospect of nam remov did
not caus him unmix grief it wa curiou to see thi state warrior
chief humbl hi pride befor the misshapen knobnos kaffir
sai olfan ask leonard who cut from the rock the great statu on
which we sat last night and what is that reptil we saw when the woman
wa thrown into the pool of troubl water
ask the waterdwel of the waterdwel the snake of the snake and
the dwarf of hi imag answer olfan nod toward otter how
can i who am but a man tell of such thing lord i onli know that
the statu wa fashion in the far past when we who ar now but a
remnant were a great peopl and as for the snake he ha alwai live
there in hi holi place our grandfath grandfath knew him and
sinc that dai he ha not chang
interest fact in natur histori said leonard i wish i could get
him home aliv to the zoolog garden
then he ask anoth question tell me olfan what becam of the red
stone yesterdai and of him who offend in offer them to the god
yonder
the most of them were cast into the pit of water lord there to be
hidden for ever there were three hide sack full
oh heaven groan leonard when juanna had translat thi otter
you have someth to answer for
but the choicest went on olfan were put in a smaller bag and ti
about the neck of the man who had sin there were not mani but among
them were the largest stone that until yesterdai shone in the ey
of the idol stone blue and red togeth also there wa that stone
shape like a human heart which hitherto ha been worn by the high
priest on the dai of sacrific and with it the imag of the dwarf
fashion from a singl gem and that of the waterdwel cut from the
great blue stone and other smaller on chosen becaus of their beauti
and also becaus thei have been known for long in the land for although
mani of these pebbl ar found where the priest dig for them but few
ar larg and perfect and the art of shape them is lost
and what becam of the man leonard ask speak as quietli as he
could for hi excit wa great
nai i do not know answer olfan i onli know that he wa let down
with rope into the home of the snake and that he gain that holi
place for it wa told to me that he drag rope after him perhap as
he fled befor the snake
now it wa promis to the man that when he had laid the bag of stone
in the place of the snake for the snake to guard for ever hi sin
would be purg and if it pleas the waterdwel to spare him that
he should be drawn up again thu nam swore to him but he did not keep
hi oath for when the man had enter the cave he bade those who held
the rope to cast them loos and i know not what happen to him but
doubtless he is food for the snake none who look upon that holi place
mai live to see the sun again
i onli hope that the brute did not swallow the rubi as well as their
bearer said leonard to juanna not that there is much chanc of our
get them anywai
then olfan went nor did he return till the afternoon when he announc
that nam and hi two princip priest wait without to speak with
them juanna order that thei should be admit and present thei
came in their air wa humbl and their head were bow but leonard
saw furi gleam in their sombr ey and wa not deceiv by thi
mask of humil
we come o ye god said nam address juanna and otter who sat
side by side on the thronelik chair we come to ask your will for
ye have laid down a new law which we do not understand on the third
dai from now is the feast of jal and fifti women ar made readi to be

he mai number their spirit among hi servant and withhold hi anger
from the peopl of the mist give them a good season thi ha been
the custom of the land for mani a gener and whenev that custom

the life of on whom he ha trick said she meaningli perchanc the
hour shall come when the true god will aveng himself on the fals and
by the hand of hi faith servant whom you would do to death you
baseborn dwarf and befor anyon could answer she left the chamber

chapter xxv
the sacrific after the new order
the third dai came the dai of sacrific after the new order noth
particular had happen in the interv leonard and francisco took some
walk through the citi guard by peter and the settlement men that
wa all
thei did not see much there except the exterior of the hous built of
stone and roof with turv and the cold stare of curios with which
thei were follow by hundr of ey gave them a sens of unrest that
effectu check their effort at closer examin onc inde
thei halt in the marketplac which wa throng whereon all
busi ceas and seller buyer herdsmen and presid priest
flock around stare at them half in fear and half in curios for
thei had never seen white men befor thi thei could not bear so thei
return to the palac
of cours otter and juanna be divin were not allow to indulg in
such recreat thei were god and must live up to their reput
for on dai otter endur it on the second in spite of leonard
warn he sought refug in the societi of the bridg saga thi
wa the begin of evil for if no man is a hero to hi valet de
chambr much less can he remain a god for long in the ey of a
curiou woman here as in other matter familiar breed contempt
leonard saw these danger and spoke serious to the dwarf on the
subject still he could not conceal from himself that put asid the
question of hi ennui which made hi conduct natur at ani rate in
a savag otter posit wa a difficult on so leonard shrug
hi shoulder and consol himself as best he could with the reflect
that at least hi wife would teach the dwarf someth of her
languag which by the wai he himself wa practis assidu under
the tuition of juanna and soa
at noon the parti adjourn to the templ escort by a bevi of priest
and soldier for in obedi to juanna command the feast wa to
be celebr in the daytim and not at night as befor the vast
amphitheatr wa crowd with thousand of human be but there wa a
differ in the arrang
juanna and otter had declin to occupi their lofti throne and sat
in chair at the feet of the huge and hideou stone idol almost on
the edg of the pool nam alon stand befor them while leonard
francisco and the settlement men rang themselv on either side the
dai wa cold and miser and snow fell from time to time in larg
flake from an ashen sky
present nam address the multitud
peopl of the mist he cri ye ar gather here to celebr the
feast of jal accord to ancient custom but the god have come
back to you as ye know and the god in their wisdom have chang the
custom fifti women were prepar for the sacrific thi morn thei
rose rejoic deem that thei were destin to the snake but now
their joi is turn to sorrow sinc the god will not accept them
have chosen a new offer for themselv let it be brought forward
at hi word lad appear from behind the idol drive two lean bull
and with them a pair of hegoat
whether by accid or design thei drove them so unskilfulli that the
anim blunder hither and thither over the rocki platform till thei
were final despatch with blow from club and axesthat is except
on goat which escap it pursuer rush down the amphitheatr and
scrambl from seat to seat among the audienc utter a success of
terrifi baa inde the scene wa so comic that even that sombr
and silent peopl began to laugh accustom as thei were on these
occas to the hideou and impress ceremoni of the midnight
sacrific of so mani human be
the ancient feast wa a fiasco thi wa a fact which could not be
conceal
begon ye peopl of the mist said nam present point to the
dead anim the sacrific is sacrif the festiv of jal is
done mai the mother plead with the snake that the sun mai shine and
fruit bless the land
now scarc ten minut had elaps sinc the begin of the
ceremoni which in the ordinari cours of event last through the
greater part of the night for it wa the custom to slaughter
each victim singli and with appropri solemn a murmur of
disapprob aros from the far end of the amphitheatr that swell
gradual to a roar the peopl had been thank to accept juanna
messag of peac but brutalis as thei were by the continu sight
of bloodsh thei were not will to dispens with their carniv
of human sacrific a roman audienc gather to wit a gladiatori
show to find themselv treat instead to a donkeyrac and a
cockfight could scarc have shown more furi
bring out the women let the victim be offer up to jal as of old
the multitud yell in their rage and ten minut or more elaps
befor thei could be quiet
then nam address them cunningli
peopl of the mist he said the god have given us a new law a law
of the sacrific of oxen and goat in the place of men and maid and ye
yourselv have welcom that law no longer shall the blood of victim
flow to jal beneath the white rai of the moon while the chant of hi
servant goe up to heaven nai henceforth thi holi place must be a
shambl for the kine so be it my children in my old ag i hear the
god speak in an alter voic and i obei them it is noth to
me who am about to die yet i tell you that rather would i myself be
stretch upon the ancient stone than see the worship of our forefath
thu turn into a mockeri the sacrific is sacrif now mai the
maid interced with the snake that plenti mai bless the land and he
smile satir and turn awai
those of the audienc who were near enough to hear hi word cri them
out to the rank behind them and when all understood there follow a
scene of most indescrib tumult
blood give us blood roar the populac their fierc face alight
with rage shall we be mock with the sacrific of goat offer up the
servant of the fals god give us blood lead forth the victim
in the midst of thi uproar juanna clad in her white robe and with the
red stone bound upon her brow rose from her seat to speak
silenc cri nam hear the voic of aca and by degre the
shout di awai and she spoke
do ye dare thu to offer outrag to the god she cri be warn
lest we bring death and famin upon you all men shall be offer up to
us no more i have spoken
for a while there wa silenc then the clamour broke out with redoubl
violenc and a portion of the multitud made a rush round the edg of
the pool toward the rock platform which wa repel by the soldier
in a veri halfheart wai
now said olfan i think that these will do well to be go and
he point to leonard francisco and the settlement men doubtless the
god can defend themselv but if the other do not fly thi is sure
that present thei will be torn to piec
let us all go said juanna whose nerv began to fail her and suit
the action to the word she led the wai toward the rock tunnel follow
by the other
thei were not allow to reach it unmolest howev for a number of
the crowd head as leonard notic by two priest forc their wai
through the cordon of guard and becam mix with the rear of their
littl parti the member of which thei threaten and struck at
savag thi happen just as thei were enter the mouth of the
tunnel behind the statu where the gloom wa great
thi tunnel wa protect by a door which so soon as thei thought that
all had pass olfan and leonard made hast to close leav the mob
howl without then thei press on to the palac which thei reach
in safeti olfan remain behind howev to watch the movement of
the mob
oh why would not you suffer them to sacrific accord to their
wick custom shepherdess said otter what doe it matter if thei
kill each other so shall there be fewer of them now the end of it must
be that the devil will find us out and murder us
no no said francisco the senora wa right let us trust in
provid and keep ourselv clean from such iniqu
as he spoke the roar of wrath in the distanc chang to a shout of
triumph follow by silenc
what is that said juanna faintli at thi moment olfan push the
curtain asid and enter and hi face wa heavi
speak olfan she said
the peopl sacrific as of old queen he answer all of us did not
pass the gate two of your black servant were mix up with the crowd
and left and now thei offer them to jal and other with them
leonard ran to the yard and count the settlement men who were huddl
togeth in their fear stare toward the templ through the bar of
the gate two were miss
as he return he met olfan come out
where is he go he ask of juanna
to guard the gate he sai that he cannot be sure of the soldier is
it true about the settlement men
ala ye two ar gone
she hid her face in her hand and shudder
poor creatur she said present in a hoars voic why did we
ever bring them here oh leonard is there no escap from thi land of
demon
i hope so he answer then ad come juanna do not give wai
thing look so bad that thei ar sure to mend
there is need of it she sob
all that even and night thei watch hourli expect to be attack
and drag forth to sacrific but no attack wa made inde on
the morrow thei learnt from olfan that the peopl had dispers after
sacrif about a score of human be and that quiet reign in the
citi
now began the most dread of their trial and the longest for it
endur five whole week as ha been said the climat of these
vast upland plain back by snowclad mountain that ar the
dwellingplac of the peopl of the mist is cold dure the winter
month to the verg of sever but at a certain period of a year
almost invari within a dai or two of the celebr of the feast
of jal the mist and frost vanish and warm weather set in with bright
sunshin
thi is the season of the sow of crop and upon the climat
condit of the few follow week depend the yield of the harvest
should the spring be delai even a week or two a short crop would
certainli result but if it arriv is postpon for a month it mean
someth like a famin dure the follow winter for although thi
peopl dwell on high land thei cultiv the same sort of grain which
ar common in these latitud name maiz and sundri varieti of
kaffir corn have no knowledg of wheat and the other hardi cereal
therefor it is all import to them that the corn should have a fair
start for if the autumn frost catch it befor it is fit to harvest the
great proport of the crop turn black and is render useless
these agricultur detail had no small bear upon the fate of our
adventur the feast of jal wa celebr in order to secur a
good seedb and spring time for the grain juanna and otter had
abolish the hideou ceremoni of that feast and the peopl of the
mist watch for the result with a gloomi and superstiti ey if the
season prove more than ordinarili good all might go well but if it
chanc to be bad
and as wa to be expect see how much depend upon it thi
spring prove the veri worst which ani live man could rememb in that
countri dai after dai the face of the sun wa hidden with mist that
onli yield to the bitter wind which blew from the mountain at night
so that when the spring should have been a month old the temperatur
wa still that of midwint and the corn would not start at all
leonard and juanna soon discov what thi meant for them and never
wa the aspect of weather more anxious scan than by these two from
dai to dai in vain everi morn the blanket of cold mist fell like a
cloud blot out the background of the mountain and everi night the
bite wind swept down upon them from the field of snow chill them
to the marrow
thi state of thingswretch enough it itselfwa onli on of mani
miseri which afflict them otter and juanna were still treat
as god inde and consider respect wa shown to leonard and
francisco that is within the wall of the palac but if weari with
the monotoni of their life thei went out which thei did twice onli
dure these five dread week matter were differ then thei
found themselv follow by a mob of men women and children who
glare at them feroci and curs them aloud ask what thei had
their god had done with the sunshin
on the second occas inde thei were forc to fly for their live
and after thi thei gave up make the attempt to walk abroad and sat
in the palac with juanna and otter who of cours never dare to leav
it
it wa a terribl life there wa noth to do noth to read and
onli anxieti to think on the greater part of the dai leonard and
juanna occupi in talk for practic in the languag of the peopl
of the mist when their convers wa exhaust thei told each other
tale of their adventur in past year or even invent stori like
children and prison inde thei were prisonersprison as thei
fear under sentenc of death
thei grew to know each other veri well dure those five week so well
inde that each could almost guess the other thought but no tender
word ever pass their lip on thi subject whatev their heart
might feel their tongu were seal and in their curiou pervers
the chief object of each wa to disguis the truth from the other
moreov leonard never for on moment forgot that juanna wa hi ward
a fact that in itself would have suffic to caus him to conceal ani
tender emot he might have felt toward her
so thei live side by side lover at heart yet talk and act as
brother and sister might and through it all were still happi after a
fashion becaus thei were togeth
but soa wa not happi she felt that her mistress no longer trust her
and wa at no loss to guess the caus dai by dai she stood behind them
like a mummi at an egyptian feast and watch leonard with evergrow
jealousi
francisco for hi part did not attempt to conceal hi fear he wa
certain that thei were about to perish and sought consol in the
constant practic of religion which wa edifi but scarc improv
him as a companion as for otter he also believ that the hour of
death wa nigh but be a fatalist thi did not troubl him much on
the contrari in spite of leonard remonstr he began to live hard
betak himself freeli to the beerpot when leonard remonstr with
him he turn somewhat sulki
todai i am a god baa he answer tomorrow i mai be carrion
while i am a god let me drink and be merri all my dai also women
have curs me becaus i am ugli but now my wife hold me great and
beauti what is the good of think and look sad the end will
come soon enough alreadi nam sharpen the knife for our heart come
and be merri with me baa if the shepherdess will let you
do you take me for a pig like yourself said leonard angrili well
go your own wai foolish that you ar but bewar of the beer and the
spirit now you ar begin to know thi languag and when you ar
drunk you talk and do you think that there ar no spi here that
girl saga is greatniec to nam and you ar besot with her be
care lest you bring us all to death
thither we shall come ani wai so let us laugh befor we weep baa
otter repli sullenli must i then sit here and do noth till i
die
leonard shrug hi shoulder and went he could not blame the dwarf
who after all wa a savag and look at thing as a savag would
notwithstand francisco earnest effort to convert him he sometim
wish so deep wa hi depress that he also wa a savag and could
do likewis
but the worst of their trial is still to be told for the first week
the settlement men stai in the palac their fear and the rumour
that had reach them of the terribl fate of their two lost companion
keep them quiet by degre howev thi dread wore off and on
afternoon weari with the same of their life thei yield to
the solicit of some men who spoke to them through the bar of
the great gate and went out in a bodi without obtain leonard
permiss that night thei return drunkat least ten of them
dead the other two were miss when thei were sober again leonard
question them as to the whereabout of their companion but thei
could give him no satisfactori inform thei had been into variou
hous in the citi thei said where the peopl had pli them with
beer and thei rememb noth more
these two men never reappear but the rest of them now thoroughli
frighten obei leonard order and stai in the palac although
the decoi men still came frequent to the gate and call them thei
pass the dai in wander about and drink to drown their fear
and the night huddl togeth for protect from an unseen foe more
terribl and craftier than the leopard of their nativ rock but these
precaut were all in vain
on morn hear a tumult among them leonard went to see what wa
the matter three more of the settlement men were miss thei had
vanish in the night none could sai how vanish though the door
were bar and guard there where thei had slept lai their gun and
littl possess but the men were gone leav no trace when he
wa consult olfan look veri grave but could throw no light upon the
mysteri beyond suggest that there were mani secret passag in the
palac of which the open were known onli to the priest and that
possibl the men had been let down themterr inform enough for
peopl in their posit
chapter xxvi
the last of the settlement men
on that dai of the vanish of the three settlement men nam paid hi
weekli visit to do honour to the god and leonard who by thi time
could make himself understood in the tongu of the peopl of the mist
attack him as to the whereabout of their lost servant
when he had finish the priest answer with a cruel smile that
he knew noth of the matter doubtless he said the god had
inform as to the fate of their own servantsit wa not for him to
seek those whom the god had chosen to put awai
then turn the subject he went on to ask when it would pleas the
mother to interced with the snake that he might caus the sun to shine
and the corn to spring for the peopl murmur fear a famin in the
land
of cours juanna wa abl to give no satisfactori answer to the priest
question and after thi the quarter of the settlement men were
chang and for a few dai the survivor slept in safeti on the third
night howev two more of them were taken in the same mysteri
manner and on of those who remain swore that hear someth
stir he woke and saw the floor open and a vision of great arm drag
hi sleep companion through the hole in it which close again
instantli leonard hurri to the spot and made a thorough examin
of the stone block of the pavement but could find no crack in them
and yet if the man had dream how wa the mysteri to be explain
after thi with the except of otter who sure of the fate that
await them took littl heed of how or when it might fall none of
the parti could even sleep becaus of their terror of the unseen foe who
struck in silenc and in dark drag the victim to some unknown
aw end leonard and francisco took it in turn to watch each other
slumber lai themselv to rest outsid the curtain of juanna
room as for the survivor of the settlement men their state can
scarc be describ thei follow leonard about upbraid him
bitterli for lead them into thi evil land and curs the hour when
first thei had seen hi face it would have been better thei said
that he should have left them to their fate in the slave camp than have
brought them here to die thu the yellow devil wa at least a man but
these peopl were sorcer and lost spirit in human shape
nor did the horror stop here for at last the headman peter a man whom
thei all like and respect went mad with fear and ran to and fro in
the palac yard while the guard and women watch him with curiou ey
as he shriek out curs upon juanna and leonard thi shock scene
continu for some hour for hi companion would not interfer with
him vow that he wa possess by a spirit till at length he put a
period to it by suddenli commit suicid in vain did leonard caution
the survivor to keep their head and watch at night thei flew to the
beer which wa suppli to them in plenti and drank till thei were
insens and still on by on thei vanish mysteri till at
length all were gone
never might leonard forget hi feel when on dai at dawn in the
fifth week of their incarcer he hurri as usual to the chamber
where the last two of the unfortun men were accustom to sleep and
found them not there were their blanket there wa the place where
thei had been and on it laid carefulli in the form of a st andrew
cross by some unknown hand shone two huge sacrifici knive such as
the priest wore at their girdl
sick and faint with fear he stagger back to the throneroom
oh what is it now said juanna who earli as it wa had risen
alreadi look at him with terrifi ey and trembl lip
onli thi he answer hoars the last two have been taken and
here is what wa left in the place of them and he cast down the knive
on to the pavement
then at last juanna gave wai oh leonard leonard she said weep
bitterli thei were my father servant whom i have known sinc i wa
a child and i have brought them to thi cruel end cannot you think of
ani wai of get out of thi place if not i shall die of fear i can

by whom last night i thought that i heard some on move near the
curtain where you and francisco lie though soa declar that it is
fanci
it is imposs said leonard francisco wa on guard ah here he

as he spoke francisco enter the room with constern written on hi
face
outram he gasp some on must have been in the throne chamber
where we slept last night all the rifl have gone our and those of
the settlement men also

i suppos that i must have doze for a few moment answer the
priest it is aw aw thei ar gone and we ar weaponless
oh can we not escap moan juanna
there is no hope of it answer leonard gloomili we ar friendless
here except for olfan and he ha littl real power for the priest
have tamper with the captain and the soldier who fear them how
can we get out of thi citi and if we got out what would becom of us
unarm and alon all that we can do is to keep heart and hope for the
best certainli thei ar right who declar that no good come of seek
after treasur though i believ that we shall live to win it yet he
ad
what deliver said a satir voic behind him do you still
desir the red stone who whose heart blood shall soon redden a
certain stone yonder truli the greed of the white man is great
leonard look round it wa soa who spoke soa who had been listen
to their talk and she wa glare at him with an express of intens
hate in her sullen ey a thought came into hi mind wa it not
possibl that thi woman had someth to do with their misfortun how
came it about that the other were taken while she wa left
who gave you leav soa he said look her fixedli in the face to
hearken to our word and thrust yourself into our talk
you have been glad enough of my counsel hitherto white man she
answer furious who told you the tale of thi peopl and who led
you to their land wa it i or anoth
you i regret to sai said leonard coolli
ye white man i led you here that you might steal the treasur of my
peopl like a thief i did it becaus the shepherdess my mistress forc
me to the deed and in those dai her will wa my law for her and you
i came here to my death and what ha been my reward i am put awai from
her she ha no kind word for me now you ar about her alwai you hold
her counsel but to me her mind is as a shut door that i can no longer
open ay you have poison her against me you and that black swine
whom thei call a god
moreov becaus she ha learn to love you white thief wander
without a kraal as you ar at your bid she ha also learn to hate
me bewar white man i am of thi peopl and you know their temper
it is not gentl when thei hate thei find a mean to be reveng and
she ceas gasp with rage
inde at that moment soa would have made no bad model for a statu of
on of the furi of greek mytholog
then juanna attempt to interfer but leonard wave her back
so he said as i thought you ar at the bottom of all thi
busi perhap you will not mind tell us what ha becom of your
friend the settlement men or if you feel a delicaci on that point
how it is that you have escap while thei have vanish
i know noth of the settlement men answer the furi except that
thei have been taken and sacrif as wa their meed and as yet i have
lift no hand and said no word against you though a breath from me
would have swept you all to doom hitherto i have been spare for the
same reason that you and baldpat yonder have been sparedbecaus we
ar the bodyserv of the fals god and ar reserv to perish with
them when the lie is discov or perhap to live awhil set in cage
in the marketplac to be mock by the passersbi and to serv as a
warn to ani whose monkei heart should dare to plot sacrileg against
the divin of aca and jal

chapter xxvii
father and daughter
while leonard and otter spoke thu in their amaz had thei but
known it a still more interest convers wa be carri on
some three hundr yard awai it scene wa a secret chamber hollow
in the thick of the templ wall and the dramati persona
consist of nam the high priest soa juanna servant and saga wife
of the snake
nam wa an earli riser perhap becaus hi conscienc would not allow
him to sleep or becaus on thi occas he had busi of import
to attend to at ani rate on the morn in question long befor
the break of dawn he wa seat in hi littl room alon muse and
inde hi thought gave him much food for reflect as ha been said
he wa a veri ag man and whatev mai have been hi fault at
least he wa earnestli desir of carri on the worship of the god
accord to the strict letter of the custom which had descend to him
from hi forefath and which he himself had follow all hi life
in truth from long consider of them their attribut and the
tradit concern them nam had come to believ in the actual
exist of these god although the belief wa a qualifi on and
somewhat halfheart or to put it less strongli he had never allow
hi mind to entertain activ doubt of the spiritu be whose
earthli worship wa so power a factor in hi own materi rule and
prosper and in that of hi class in it issu thi halffaith of
hi had been suffici real to induc him to accept otter and juanna
when thei arriv mysteri in the land
it had been prophesi that thei should arriv thusthat wa a
fact and their outward appear exactli fit everi detail of the
prophecythat wa anoth fact and these two fact togeth seem to
point to a conclus so irresist that shrewd and experienc as
he wa nam wa unabl to set it down to mere coincid therefor
in the first rush of hi religi enthusiasm he had accord a hearti
welcom to the incarn of the divin whom for some eighti year
he had worship as power spiritu
but though piou zeal had much to do with thi action as olfan inform
juanna it wa not devoid of worldli motiv he desir the glori of
be the discover of the god he desir also the consolid of
the rule which hi cruelti had shaken that must result from their
advent
all thi wa well enough but he had never even dream that the first
step of these newborn divin would be to discard the ancient
ceremoni without which hi offic would becom a sinecur and hi
power a myth and even to declar an activ hostil against himself
were thei or were thei not god thi wa the question that exercis
hi mind if there wa truth in prophesi thei should be god on the
other hand he could discov noth particularli divin about their
person charact or attributesthat is to sai noth suffici
divin to deceiv nam himself whatev impress thei produc upon
the vulgar thu juanna might be no more than a veri beauti woman
white in colour and otter onli what he knew him to be through hi
spi a somewhat dissolut dwarf
that thei had no great power wa also evid see that he nam
without incur the heavenli vengeanc had been abl to abstract
and afterward to sacrific comfort the greater number of their
servant anoth thing which plead against their celesti origin
wa that so far instead of peac and prosper bless the land as
it should have done immedi on their arriv the present season
wa prove itself the worst on record and the countri wa face to face
with a prospect of famin in the ensu winter
and yet if thei were not god who were thei would ani human be
in their sens ventur among such peopl as the children of the mist
mere to plai off a huge practic joke of which the final wa like
to be so seriou to themselv the idea wa preposter sinc thei
had noth to gain by so do for nam it mai be observ wa
ignor of the valu of rubi which to him were onli emblem emploi
in their symbol ceremoni think as he would he could come to no
definit conclus on thing wa clear howev that it wa now veri
much to hi interest to demonstr their noncelesti origin though
to do so would be to stultifi himself and to prove that hi judgment wa
not infal otherwis did the god succe in establish their
power he and hi author seem like to come to a sudden end in
the jaw of that monster which hi order had foster for so mani
gener
thu reflect nam in perplex of soul wish to himself the while
that he had retir from hi offic befor he wa call upon to face
question so difficult and so danger
i must be patient he mutter to himself at last time will show the
truth or if the weather doe not chang the peopl will settl the
matter for me
as it chanc he had not long to wait for just then there wa a knock
upon hi door
enter he said arrang hi goatskin robe about hi broad
shoulder
a priest came in bear a torch for there wa no window to the
chamber and after him two women
who is thi said nam point to the second of the women
thi is she who is servant to aca father answer the priest
how come she here said nam again i gave no order that she should
be taken

me of jal your lord

veri ill yet when he wa last in liquor he sang a song which told of
deed that he and he whom thei name the deliver had wrought togeth

that there wa no such god as thi man and no such man as thi god
that wa so father but sinc then he ha thrust me asid sai that
i weari him and court a handmaid of mine own and therefor i demand
the life of that handmaiden
nam smile grimli perchanc you demand the life of the god also
ye she repli without hesit i would see him dead if it can
be brought about

grandmoth who brought three men to sacrific becaus she grew jealou
of them well well these ar strang time and you mai live to see
your desir satisfi by the death of the god now what of that woman
how come she to be with you
she wa bound by the order of aca father and jal wa set to watch
her but i drug jal and loos her bond i led her down the secret
wai for she desir to speak to you
how can that be niec can i then understand her languag

nam look astonish and go to the door he call to the priest
without to lead in the stranger
you have word to sai to me he said
ye lord but not befor these that which i have to sai is secret
nam hesit

unarm
then he command the other to go and when the door had close behind
them he look at her inquiringli

head and turn her face to the glare of the torchlight
how can i know who you ar wander yet had i met you by chanc i
should have said that you were of our blood
that is so lord i am of your blood cast your mind back and think if
you can rememb a certain daughter whom you love mani year ago but

snake and she paus

perchanc you can recal lord that move to it by love and piti on
the night of the sacrific you help that daughter to escap the fang
of the snake
i rememb someth of it he repli cautious but tide were
brought to me that thi woman of whom you speak wa overtaken by the
vengeanc of the god and di on her journei
that is not so lord i am your daughter and you ar none other than
my father i knew you when i first saw your face though you did not
know me
prove it and bewar how you lie he said show me the secret sign
and whisper the hidden word into my ear
then glanc suspici behind her soa came to him and made
some movement with her hand in the shadow of the tabl next bend
forward she whisper awhil into hi ear when she had finish her
father look up and there were tear in hi ag ey
welcom daughter he said i thought that i wa alon and that none
of my issu live anywher upon the earth welcom your life is forfeit
to the snake but forget my vow i will protect you ay even at
the cost of my own
then the two embrac each other with everi sign of tender a
spectacl that would have struck anyon acquaint with their charact
as both curiou and interest
present nam left the chamber and have dismiss the attend
priest and hi greatniec saga who were wait outsid he return
and prai hi daughter to explain the reason of her presenc in the
train of aca
first you shall swear an oath to me my father said soa and if you
swear it not i will tell you no word of my stori you shall swear by
the blood of aca that you will do noth against the life of that queen
with whom i journei hither for the other you mai work your will
upon them but her you shall not harm
why should i swear thi daughter he ask
you shall swear it becaus i whom you love love her and also becaus
so you shall gain the greater honour
who am i that i should lift my hand against the god daughter i swear
it by the blood of aca and if i break my oath then mai jal deal with
me as onc he dealt with aca
then soa went on freeli for she knew that thi wa a vow that could not
be broken begin at it commenc she told him all the stori of
her life sinc forti year ago she had fled from among the peopl of
the mist pass on rapidli howev to that part of it which had to
do with the captur and rescu of juanna from the slavetrad and
with the promis that she had made to leonard as the price of hi
assist thi promis she wa care to explain she had not
intend to fulfil until she wa forc to do so by juanna herself
then she gave him a minut histori of the object and detail of their
expedit down to her final quarrel with leonard and her mistress on
the previou dai
to sai that the old priest wa thunderstruck at these extraordinari
revel would be too littl he wa overwhelmedso overwhelm that
for a while he could scarc speak
it is fortun for thi jade of a mistress of your who dare to
make a mockeri of our goddess that she mai steal her wealth that i have
sworn to save her from harm daughter he gasp at length els she
had di and swiftli at least the other remain to me and he sprang
to hi feet
stai awhil father said soa catch hi cloak what is your
plan

there to do
and therebi denounc yourself also who proclaim them god i think i

the god prai them to chang the face of the heaven that the sun
mai shine tell them also that strang talk ha come to your ear by
the mouth of saga and the other women of word that have been spoken

true and that thei will be brought to the templ there to be judg
and dealt with accord to the find of the peopl who have heard
these thing also
and what if the weather should chang daughter
it will not chang yet awhil but if that should chanc we must make
anoth plan
just now i swore to you that i would not harm her whom you love and

the multitud how shall she escap harm for then her end must be quick
and terribl
she shall escap becaus she will not be there father you have seen
the white man with hernot the deliver the other were that man
dress in the robe of aca and sat on high upon the head of the statu
when the light is low who should sai that he wa not aca
then you would give all the other to death daughter
nai i would save the deliver aliv for a while at least
and wherefor you ar too subtl for me
for thi reason father he love her who is name aca and trust to
marri her to marri her fulli accord to the custom of hi peopl
therefor i would that he should see her given to anoth
to anoth to whom then
to olfan the king who also love her

oh my daughter be plain i prai of you for i cannot understand your
counsel were it not better to give to these peopl the red stone
which thei desir and send them secretli from the land sai that
thei had vanish into the earth again for so it seem to me we should
be rid of much shame and troubl
listen my father and i will tell you were she whom i love to leav
thi land i should see her face no more and thi mad ha come
upon me that i cannot live without the sight of her also how can these
peopl escap the danger of the road but four of them ar left aliv
and even were thei without our border thei must journei for three
month befor thei come to ani place where white men live pass
through swamp and desert and tribe of wild men thi thei could
hardli do with arm such as those wherebi the deliver slew the
priest and now their arm ar gone you alon know where my father
the instrument of which you speak lie in the deep water of the templ
pool daughter for there i caus them to be cast
their arm ar gone said soa thei ar alon here thei must live or
die three of them i will give to death and the fourth i would make the
wife of the king see that noth better can be done for her let
her be hidden awhil and then let olfan take her as for the tale that
we shall tell of the matter to the ear of the peopl doubtless time
will show it i sai that olfan love her and will bui her with a great
price and the price which you must ask shall be that henceforth he
obei you in everyth
the scheme is good daughter at the least bear my oath in mind i
have none better though were it not for my oath either i should kill
them all or set them free yet who can sai that it shall succe it is
in the hand of fate let it go as fate will and now follow me that i
mai place you where you shall dwell in comfort then after we have eaten

the palac for some hour thei sat togeth in the throneroom almost
silent for thei were crush by misfortun and fear the toil were
close on them and thei knew it nor could thei lift a finger to save

francisco knelt and prai leonard and juanna sat hand in hand

chapter xxviii
juanna prevar
the morrow drew toward it even like those that had gone befor
it thi dai had been misti and miser onli distinguish from it
predecessor by the fall of some sharp shower of sleet now as the
afternoon wane the sky began to clear in it accustom fashion but
the bitter wind sweep down the mountain though it drove awai the
fog gave no promis of ani break in the weather at sunset leonard went
to the palac gate and look toward the templ about the wall
of which a number of peopl were alreadi gather as though in
anticip of some great event thei caught sight of him and drew
as near to the gate of the palac as thei dare howl curs and
shake their fist
thi is a foretast of what we must expect tonight i suppos said
leonard to francisco who had follow him as thei retreat across the
courtyard we ar in troubl now friend i do not so much care for my
own sake but it break my heart to think of juanna what will be the
end of it i wonder
for me outram the end will be death of that i am sure well i have
long expect it and i am readi to die what your fate will be i cannot
sai but as to the senora comfort yourself for mani week i have had a
presenti that she will escap safe
in that case i am readi enough to go answer leonard life is as
dear to me as to other men but i tell you francisco that i would pai
mine down gladli tonight as the price of her deliver
i know it outram we ar both of on mind there and perhap befor
mani hour ar over we shall be call upon to practis what we preach
by now thei had reach the throneroom where otter who for the last
twenti hour had been quit sober wa squat on the floor at the
foot of hi throne a pictur of repent miseri while juanna walk
swiftli up and down the long room lost in reflect
ani new leonard she said as thei came in
none except that there ar great prepar go on yonder and he
nod toward the templ also a mob is howl at the gate
oh groan otter address juanna cannot you who ar name
shepherdess of the heaven prophesi to these peopl that the weather

hi life to us though it is true that were it not for us he would never
have been in danger of hi life now we must trust him and take our
chanc if we make a mistak it doe not greatli matterw have made
so mani alreadi
juanna bow her head and thought awhil then she lift it and spoke
olfan she said ar we alon that which i have to sai must be
overheard by none
we ar alon queen he answer glanc round but these wall
have ear
olfan draw near
he obei and lean forward she spoke to him almost in a whisper
while the other cluster round to hear her word
you must call me queen no more she said in a voic broken with
humili i am no goddess i am but a mortal woman and thi man
and she point to otter is no god he is onli a black dwarf
she paus watch the effect of her word an express of
astonish swept across the king face but it wa her bold
rather than the purport of her speech that caus it then he smile
perhap i have guess as much he answer and yet i must still
call you by that name see that you ar the queen of all women for
sai where is there anoth so love so brave or so great here at
least there ar none and he bow befor her with a state courtesi
that would have becom ani european gentleman
now it wa leonard turn to look astonish there wa noth in the
king word to which he could take object and yet he did not like
their tone it wa too full of admir moreov it seem to him
that olfan wa not in the least disappoint to discov as a fact that
juanna wa onli a womana supposit which wa fulli establish by
hi next speech
i am glad to learn from your own lip queen that you ar no goddess
but a mortal ladi see that goddess ar far awai and we men must
worship them from afar wherea womenw mai love and again he bow
my word said leonard to himself thi king is set himself up as
my rival i almost wish i had put thing on a more satisfactori foot
but of cours it is absurd poor juanna
as for juanna herself she start and blush here wa a new troubl
but howev disagre it might prove to be now wa no time to show
displeasur
listen olfan she said thi is not an hour for pretti speech
which mean noth for it seem that befor the light dawn again i mai
well be dead and far beyond all love and worship thi is our tale we
came to your land to seek adventur and also to win those red stone
that you name the blood of aca which among the white peopl ar much
prize as ornament for their women that is why i who am a woman
urg the deliver to undertak thi journei and it is becaus of my
folli that now we stand in danger of our live
your pardon queen said olfan bluntli but i would ask you on
question befor you tell me the end of your tale what is thi white man
to you
now juanna wa in a cleft stick if she said that leonard wa noth
to her it might possibl be better for him though it wa doubt
whether olfan would believ her if on the other hand she said that
he wa her husband it might be better for herself and protect her from
the advanc of thi dignifi savag but against thi cours her pride
revolt had she not alwai indignantli repudi the valid of that
hate marriag and though she love him were not she and leonard
in a sens at dagger drawn still she must decid and quickli her
commonsens told her that under the circumst it wa her pride
which must give wai
he is my husband she said boldli
olfan face fell then a look of doubt came into it for juanna mode
of life everi detail of which wa known to him seem to contradict
her statement
see that he did not believ her juanna plung still deeper into the
mire
he is my husband she said again thi man and she point to
francisco who is a priest among us marri us accord to our
custom some six moon sinc and otter yonder wa wit to the
marriag
is thi so ask olfan
it is so king repli francisco i marri them and thei ar man
and wife
ye ye it is so put in otter for i saw it done and we
celebr a great sacrific in honour of that wed feast i would
that we could have such anoth here tonight
fear not dwarf answer olfan with a touch of irrit you will
see enough of sacrific befor all is end
then a new thought struck him and he ad you sai that the deliver
is your husband queen and these men bear wit to it all except
your lord himself now tell me on thing more do you love him and would
you be sorri if he di
juanna brow burnt red as the rubi stone upon it for with the
except of her black robe she wa prepar to proce to the templ
but there wa no help for it now she must speak clearli howev much
it shame her to do so lest olfan might take her silenc as a hint and
the husband for whom she disavow affect should be remov from
her life for ever
you have littl right to put such a question to me king yet i will
answer it i love him and if he di i should die also
leonard suppress an exclam with difficulti for here wa juanna
appear in a new light inde
i am answer queen said olfan in tone of deep depress now if
it pleas you will you end your tale
there is not much to tell repli juanna heav a sigh of relief
for thi crossexamin as to her exact relat with leonard had
been somewhat try the woman soa my servant is of your peopl
inde she is a daughter to nam the priest and fled the land forti
year ago becaus she wa destin to the snake
where is she now interrupt olfan look round
we do not know last night she vanish as our other servant have
vanish
perhap nam know and if so you mai see her again soon proce
queen
after the deliver and i were marri soa who had been my nurs for
mani year told us of the great peopl her brethren among whom she
wish to die
mai her desir be gratifi put in otter
and said that if we would escort her thither we could bui mani such
stone as that upon my brow which she had brought with her from thi
countri and given to me then it wa that i desir the playth
torment my husband till he consent to lead me hither though hi
own heart spoke against it so we came and the journei wa long and
terribl but at last we reach the cliff yonder which border the land
of mist and it wa then for the first time when it wa too late to go
back that soa told us the tale of the god of your peopl and show
us that either we must do sacrileg and feign to be those god come
back as the propheci promis or perish miser inde thi wa her
plot to set up fals god over you have first told the secret to the
priest that she might gain honour with them and save herself aliv
and now olfan that is all the tale we have plai the game and we
have lost or so it seemsthat is unless you help us and she clasp
her hand and look upon him pleadingli
the king drop hi ey as though he were not will to contempl
the loveli which as he now learn belong to the white stranger
at juanna side
have i not said that my power is littl queen he answer somewhat
sullenli also why should i help those who came to thi land to trick
us and who have brought the anger of the god upon it children
becaus we save your life olfan and you swore to be loyal to us
had it not been for you queen my life would not have been in danger
moreov i swore fealti to god and now the god ar mortal upon
whom the true god will be aveng why then should i help you
becaus we have been friend olfan you shall help us for my sake
for your sake queen he said bitterli for your sake who tell me
that you ar thi man wife and that you love him to the death nai
thi is much to ask had it been otherwis had you been unw and
will to look upon me the king of thi land with favour then
doubtless i had di for your sake if there were need but now have
you then no better reason to show why i should risk my life for you and
for these men
i have two more reason king and if thei ar not enough then leav
us to our fate and let us who must prepar to die wast no more
breath in word the first is that we ar your friend and have trust
you save your life at the danger of our own and tell you thi tale
of our own free will therefor in the name of friendship which you
should hold sacr who ar no common man but a king we demand your
help we who have put our live in the hollow of your hand know that
you ar of nobl mind and will not betrai us
the second is that our interest is your interest we strive against nam
and the priest and so do you if nam conquer us todai tomorrow
it will be your turn and the snake whose fang we must feel shall in
dai to come feed upon you also now is the hour of destini for you and
your descend cling to us and break the yoke of nam and the priest
or desert us and bind that yoke upon your shoulder to your doom i have
spokenchoos
olfan thought awhil and answer
truli your mind is great queen and see far into the dark of
thing such as our women have no knowledg of you should have rule
thi countri and not i for then by now nam who is my master would
have beg hi daili bread at the gate of your palac and the priest
hi servant had becom the hewer of your wood and the drawer of your
water but i will not talk to you of polici for time is short nai i
will deal with your first reason and that alon
you have conjur me in the name of friendship and of my oath and by
the memori of servic done and not in vain i am a man differ from
that race of men of whom you ar a wild chief of a wild tribe have
littl wisdom yet i have learn these thingsnev to break a
promis never to desert a friend and never to forget a servic
therefor becaus i swore fealti to you becaus you ar my friend and
becaus you save my life i will protect you to the last though it
mai well chanc that i can do noth except die for you for queen
although you can be nought to me while yonder man live still i am
readi to give my life for you as for the other i will sai thi onli
that i will not harm them or betrai them
now i go to speak with certain of the great men who ar friend to me
and hate the priest so that when thi matter come on for judgment thei
mai lift up their voic in your favour for noth can be done except
by policythat is not now shortli i will return to lead you to the
templ till then farewel and he bow and wa gone
when the curtain had swung to behind olfan juanna sank back in her
chair and sigh but leonard sprang up and said
juanna that savag is right you should have been a queen i know what
it must have cost you to sai what you did
prai to what do you refer leonard she said interrupt him
coldli
i mean about our be marri and the rest
oh ye well you see it is sometim necessari to tell white li
and i think that after tonight i am entitl to a prize for gener
profici in thi respect of cours she ad drop her
sarcast tone you will not misinterpret anyth that i wa forc
to sai to olfan with refer to yourself becaus you know that those
statement were the biggest fib of all just then had it been need
i should have been prepar to swear that i wa marri to otter and
deepli attach to him or even to the king himself who by the
wai strike me as the most satisfactori savag that i have ever come
acrossin short as a gentleman
leonard turn pale with anger
realli juanna he said i think that you might wait until i seek to
take some advantag of our friendship and accident relat befor
you rebuk me as you think fit to do it is littl short of an insult
and were we in ani civilis countri i would never speak to you again
dont get angri leonard she said appealingli for juanna seem to
have everi mood at her command and readi to be assum at a moment
notic perhap thi gift wa on of the secret of her charm sinc
monotoni is a thing to be avoid by women who seek to rule even the
monotoni of sweet it is veri unkind of you she went on to
speak crossli to me when i am so tire with talk to that savag and
we mai all be dead and buri in a few hour and she look as though
she were go to cry
leonard collaps instantli for juanna plaintiv mood wa the on
that he could resist the least of ani
you would make me angri if i were on my deathb he said that is
when you talk like that but there it is i cannot chang you so let
us chang the subject have you ani of that poison to spare if so you
might serv us out a littl we mai want it befor the even is over
juanna put her hand to her hair and after some manipul produc a
tini skin bag from which she extract a brown ball of about the size
of a rifl bullet
i can afford to be gener she said with a littl laugh there is
enough here to kill twenti of us
then leonard took a knife and chip off three fragment from the ball
take on himself and present the other two to francisco and otter
the priest receiv it doubtfulli but the dwarf would have none of it
keep it for yourself baa he said keep it for yourself whatev
wai i die it shall not be thu i do not love a medicin that caus men
to tie themselv into knot and then turn them green no no first i
will face the jaw of the snake
so leonard took that piec also
chapter xxix
the trial of the god
juanna had scarc restor the remaind of her deadli medicin to it
hidingplac when the curtain were drawn and nam enter after hi
customari salut which on thi occas were more copiou than
usual he remark blandli that the moon had risen in a clear sky
which mean i suppos that it is time for us to start said leonard
gruffli
then thei set out juanna in her monklik robe and otter in hi red
fring and a goatskin cape which he insist upon wear
i mai as well die warm as cold baa he explain for of cold i
shall know enough when i am dead
at the palac gate olfan and a guard were wait but thei found no
opportun of speak with him here also were gather a great number
of priest who preced and follow them
the process be form thei were led solemnli to a differ gate
of the templ from that by which thei had enter it on their previou
visit on thi occas the secret passag were avoid and thei
pass up a broad avenu though the centr of the amphitheatr to
seat that had been prepar for them on that side of the pool which wa
furthest from the coloss idol as befor the templ wa crowd with
human be and their advanc through it wa veri impress for the
priest chant as thei walk while the multitud preserv an omin
silenc
at first leonard wa at a loss to know why thei were place on the
hither side of the pool but present he saw the reason in front of
the chair to be occupi by juanna and otter an open space of rock wa
left semicircular in shape on which were set other seat to the number
of thirti or more these seat were allot to elder of the peopl
who as leonard guess rightli had been chosen to act as their judg
the posit wa select for the conveni of these elder and in
order that the word thei spoke might be heard by a larger proport of
their vast audienc
when juanna and otter were seat and leonard and francisco had taken
their place behind them nam came forward to address the council and
the multitud beyond
elder of the peopl of the mist he said i have convei your
wish to the holi god who but late have deign to put on the flesh
of men to visit us their peopl name that thei should meet you here
and talk with you of the troubl which ha come upon the land and now
the graciou god have assent to your wish and behold thei ar
face to face with you and with thi great compani of their children be
pleas therefor to make known what you desir to the god that thei
mai answer you either with their own mouth or by the voic of me
their servant
he ceas and after a paus dure which the peopl murmur angrili
an elder rose and said
we would know of you how it is o aca and o jal that the summer ha
desert the land now our strait is veri sorri for famin will come
upon us with the winter snow a while ago o aca and o jal you chang
the worship of thi peopl forbid the victim who had been prepar
to be offer up at the spring festiv and lo there ha been no
spring therefor we ask a word of you on thi matter for the peopl
have consult togeth and sai by our voic that thei will have no
god who kill the spring speak o ye god and you nam speak also
for we would learn the reason of these evil and from you o nam we
would learn how it come that you have proclaim god in the land whose
breath ha destroi the sunshin
ye ask me o peopl of the mist answer juanna why it is that the
winter stretch out hi hand over the slumber of the spring forbid
her to awak and i will answer you in few word and short it is
becaus of your disobedi and the hard of your heart o ye
rebelli children did ye not do sacrific when we forbad you to take
the blood of men ay and have not our servant been stolen secretli
awai and put to death to satisfi your lust for slaughter it is for thi
reason becaus of your disobedi that the heaven have grown hard
as your own heart and will not bless you with their sunshin and their
gentl rain i have answer you
then again the spokesman of the elder rose and said
we have heard your word o aca and thei ar word of littl comfort
for to sacrific is the custom of the land and hitherto no evil ha
befallen us becaus of that ancient custom yet if there ha been
offenc it is not we who have offend but rather the priest in whose
hand these matter lie and as for your servant we know noth of
them or of their fate now nam make answer to the charg of the
god and to the question of the peopl for you ar the chief of their
servant and you have proclaim them to be true god and set them over
us to rule us
thu adjur nam stood forward and hi mien wa humbl and anxiou
for he saw well that hi accus were not to be trifl with and that
hi life or at least hi power wa at stake togeth with those of
the god
children of the mist he began your word ar sharp yet i do not
complain of them for as ye shall learn my fault ha been grievou
truli i am the chief of the servant of the god and i am also the
servant of the peopl and now it would seem that i have betrai both
god and peopl though not of my own will
listen ye know the legend that ha come down to us that aca and jal
should reappear in the land wear the shape of a fair white maiden
and of a black dwarf ye know also how thei came as had been promis
and how i show them to you here in thi templ and ye accept them
ye rememb that then thei put awai the ancient law and forbad the
sacrific and by the hand of their servant who is name deliver
thei destroi two of the priest my brethren in a strang and
terribl fashion
then i murmur though thei threaten me with death but ye overrul
my word and accept the new law and from that hour all thing have
gone ill now i took counsel with my heart for it seem wonder to
me that the god should discard their ancient worship and i said to
my heart can these be true god or have i perchanc been dupe
thenceforward i held my peac and set myself to watch and now after
much watchingala i must sai it to my shamei have discov that
thei ar no true god but wick liar who have sought to usurp the
place of the god
he paus and a roar of rage and astonish went up from the
assembl thousand
it ha come at last whisper leonard into juanna ear
ye it ha come she answer well i expect it and now we must
face it out
when the tumult had subsid the spokesman of the elder address nam
sai
these ar heavi word o nam and have utter them you must prove
them for until thei ar prove we will not believ readili that there
ar human be so wick that thei dare to name themselv as god
when you proclaim these stranger to be aca and jal we accept them
perhap too easili and after too short a search now you denounc them
as liar but we will not disclaim them whom we have onc receiv till
we ar sure that there is no room for error it mai chanc nam that it
would pleas you well to cast asid those god who have threaten you
with death and do not love you
i should be bold inde answer nam if i dare to speak as i have
spoken lack testimoni to establish a charg so dread as that which
i bring against these wander nor should i seek to publish my own
shame and folli were i not forc thereto by knowledg that did i
conceal it would make me a partner of their crime listen thi is the
tale of those whom we have worship the fair woman as she herself
told us is name shepherdess of the heaven and she is the wife of the
white man who is name deliver and the dwarf dweller in the water is
their servant togeth with the second white man and the other
dwell in a far countri these men and women chanc to learn the
stori of our peoplehow i shall show you presentlyand also that we
find in the earth and us in the ceremoni of our templ certain red
and blue stone which among the white peopl ar of priceless valu
these thei determin to steal be adventur who seek after wealth
to thi end the shepherdess learn our languag also she learn how
to plai the part of aca while the dwarf dog that he is dare to take
the holi name of jal i will be short thei accomplish their journei
and the rest you know but as it happen none of the stone thei
covert have come into their hand except that gem which the shepherdess
wear upon her forehead and thi she brought with her
now peopl of the mist when doubt of these god had enter into
me i made a plan i set spi to watch them in the palac yonder those
spi be the wife who wa given to the dwarf and her handmaiden
also i caus their black servant to be seiz and thrown to the
snake on or two of them at a time for of thi i wa sure that if
thei had the power thei would protect their servant but as the snake
know those men were not protect meanwhil report came to me
from the women and more especi from saga the granddaught of my
brother who wa given as a bride to jal and thi wa their report
that the dwarf behav himself like a cur of low birth and that when
he wa in liquor which wa often he babbl of hi do with the
deliver in other land though all that he said thei could not tell me
becaus even now he ha littl knowledg of our tongu
when these tale came to my ear you mai guess o peopl of the mist
that if i had doubt befor now my heart wa shaken and yet i had
no proof in my dark i prai to the god for light and lo light
came among the follow of these wander wa a woman and but
yesterdai thi woman visit me and confess all forti year ago she
had fled from among our peoplei know not why but she took with her a
knowledg of our secret it wa she who told them of the god and the
stori of the god and she instruct them how thei should deceiv us
and win the red stone which thei desir but now her heart repent her
of the evil and i will summon her befor you that ye mai judg between
me and these liar who have brought me to thi shame bring forth the
woman
there wa a silenc and so intens wa the interest that no sound came
from the audienc which watch for the appear of the wit
present soa advanc from the shadow at the foot of the colossu and
escort by two priest took her stand in the centr of the semicircl
of judg
speak woman said nam
then soa spoke i am of the peopl of the mist she said as ye mai
know by look on me and hear me i wa the daughter of a priest
and forti year ago when i wa young and fair i fled thi land for my
own reason and travel south for three month journei till i came
to a villag on a mighti river where i dwelt for twenti year earn a
livelihood as a doctoress of medicin then there came into that villag
a white man whose wife gave birth to a daughter and di i becam the
nurs of that daughter she is the woman who sit befor you and her
name is shepherdess
twenti year more went by and i desir to return to my own land
that i might die among my peopl i told the tale of my land and of it
wealth to the shepherdess and to her husband the deliver for i dare
not travel alon therefor in my wicked i show them how thei
might feign to be the god of the peopl of the mist come back
accord to the legend for i saw that the dwarf the deliver
servant wa shape like to the shape of the statu of jal who sit in
stone abov you be greedi thei fell into the plan for abov all
thing thei desir to win the preciou stone but when we were come
hither the true god visit me in a dream so that my heart wa troubl
becaus of the evil which i had done and yesterdai i escap to nam and
told him all the tale which you have heard that is the stori peopl of
the mist and now i prai your merci and your pardon
soa ceas and leonard who had been watch the multitud whisper
to juanna
speak quickli if you can think of anyth to sai thei ar silent now
becaus of their astonish but in anoth minut thei will break
out and then
peopl of the mist cri juanna take the hint you have heard the
word of nam and the word of her who wa my servant thei dare to tel
you that we ar no god so be it on thi matter we will not reason
with you for can the god descend to prove their godhead we will not
reason but i will sai thi in warn put us awai if you wishand it
mai well chanc that we shall suffer ourselv to be put awai sinc the
god do not desir to rule over those who reject them but would choos
rather to return to their own place
yet for you it shall be a sad and an unlucki dai when ye lift a hand
against our majesti for in go we will leav you that by which we
shall be rememb ay we will bequeath to you three thing famin
and pestil and civil war which shall rage among you and destroi
you till ye ar no more a peopl ye have suffer our servant to be
murder and disobei our command and it is for thi reason as i
have told you that the sun shine no more and the summer will not come
complet your wicked if ye will and let the god follow by the path
that their servant trod then peopl of the mist ye shall reap as ye
have sown and death and desol shall be your harvest
now for that base slave who ha born fals wit against us among
the mani thing she ha told you on thing she ha left untold that
she is daughter to nam the priest that she fled the land becaus she
wa chosen bride to the snake and is therefor an apost worthi of
death on word also as to nam her father if hi tale be true then he
himself is condemn by it for doubtless he knew all at the begin
from the lip of hi daughter soa
ye know the truth he dare to set up god in the land whom he
believ to be fals trust therebi to increas hi own power and
glori and when these fail him becaus of hi wicked then he did
not scrupl to cry aloud hi shame i have spoken peopl of the mist
now judg between us and let fate follow judgment for we renounc you
she end her face alight with anger and her ey flash with
excit and so great wa the power of her eloqu and beauti that
it seem to throw a spell of silenc over the heart of her fierc and
turbul audienc while soa slunk back into the shadow and nam cower
visibl
it is fals o peopl he cri in a voic that trembl with rage and
fear my daughter told me the tale for the first time at dawn todai
hi word awok the audienc as it were and instantli there aros a
babel of sound that rent the veri ski hi daughter he sai that
she is hi daughter nam own hi crime yell some
awai with the fals god shout other
touch them not thei ar true god and will bring a curs upon us
answer a third parti among whom leonard recognis the voic of
olfan
and so the clamour went on for full ten minut it rage till the
exhaust of those that made it brought it to it end and juanna who
all thi while sat silent as some love marbl statu becam awar
that the spokesman of the elder wa onc more address the multitud
peopl of the mist he said hold your peac and hearken to me
we have been chosen judg of thi matter and now have consult
togeth we will give judgment and you shall be bound by it as to
whether these stranger who ar name aca and jal ar true god or
fals we sai no word but if thei ar fals god then sure nam is
guilti with them
here a shout of assent burst from the audienc and leonard watch the
high priest saw him trembl
yet he went on thei have told us by the mouth of her who sit
befor you that it is becaus of our offenc that the sun ha ceas
to shine at their command therefor at their command it can be made to
shine then let them give us a sign or let them die if inde thei ar
mortal for if thei ar not mortal we cannot kill them and thi shall
be the sign which thei must give if tomorrow at the dawn the mist
have vanish and the sun shine red and clear on the snow of yonder
mountain then it is well and we will worship them but if the morn
is cold and mistladen then true god or fals we will hurl them from
the head of the statu into the pit of the snake there to be dealt
with by the snake or to deal with him as it mai chanc that is our
judgment peopl of the mist and nam shall carri it out if need be for
he shall keep hi power and hi place until all these wonder ar made
clear and then himself he shall be judg accord to their issu
now the great mass of the peopl cri aloud that thi wa a wise and
just sai but other were silent for though thei did not agre with
it thei dare not disput the sentenc then juanna rose and said
we have heard your word and we will withdraw to consid them and by
dawn ye shall see us seat on the black on yonder but whether we will
caus the sun to shine or choos to pass to our own place by the path
of boil water we do not know though it seem to me that the last
thing is better than the first for we weari of your compani peopl of
the mist and it is not fit that we should bless you longer with our
presenc nevertheless should we choos that path those evil which i
have foretold shall fall upon you olfan lead us henc
the king step forward with hi guard and the process pass back
toward the palac solemnli and in silenc for none attempt to bar
their wai thei reach it safe at exactli ten oclock by leonard
watch
now let us eat and drink said leonard when thei stood alon in the
throneroom for we shall need all our strength tonight
ye answer juanna with a sad smile let us eat and drink for
tomorrow we die
chapter xxx
francisco expiat
when thei had finish their meal which wa about as sad an
entertain as can well be conceiv thei began to talk
do you see ani hope ask juanna of the other three
leonard shook hi head and answer
unless the sun shine at dawn tomorrow we ar dead men
then there is littl chanc of that baa groan otter for the
night is as the night have been for these five week no wonder that
thi peopl ar fierc and wick who live in such a climat
juanna hid her face in her hand for a while then spoke
thei did not sai that ani harm wa to come to you leonard or to
francisco so perhap you will escap
i doubt it he answer besid to be perfectli frank if you ar
go to die i would rather die with you
thank you leonard she said gentli but that will not help either of
us much will it what will thei do with us throw us from the head of
the statu and she shudder
that seem to be their amiabl intent but at ani rate we need none
of us go through with it aliv how long doe your medicin take to
work juanna
half a minut at the outsid i fanci and sometim less ar you sure
that you will take none otter think the other end is dread
no shepherdess said the dwarf who now in the presenc of immin
danger wa as he had been befor he sought comfort in the beerpot

just then francisco follow hi exampl seek a quiet place in which
to pursu hi devot and thu leonard and juanna were left alon
for some minut he watch her as she sat besid him in her white
templ dress her beauti face look stern and sad against the duski
background of the torchlight and a great shame and piti fill hi
heart the blood of thi girl wa on hi hand and he could do noth
to help her hi selfish had drag her into thi miser
enterpris and now it inevit end wa at hand and he wa her
murder the murder of the woman who wa all the world to him and
who had been entrust to hi care with her father dy breath
forgiv me he said at length with someth like a sob and lai
hi hand upon her
what have i to forgiv leonard she repli gentli now that it is
all finish and i look back upon the past few month it seem to me
that it is you who should forgiv for i have often behav badli to

she did not start or even stir at hi word but sat stare as befor
into the dark onli a pink flush grew upon the pallor of her neck
and cheek as she answer
you love me leonard you forgetjan beach
it is perfectli true juanna that i wa onc attach to jane beach
and it is true that i still think of her with affect but i have not
seen her for mani year and i am certain that she ha thrown me over

heart in their earli dai i have had but on and it is done with
when first i saw you in the slave camp i love you juanna and i have
gone on love you ever sinc even after i becam awar from your word
and conduct that you did not entertain ani such affect for myself i
know that your mind ha not chang upon the matter for had it done so
you would scarc have spoken to me as you did todai after olfan left
us inde i do not altogeth understand why i have told you thi
sinc it will not interest you veri much and mai possibl annoi you
in your last hour i suppos it wa becaus i wish to make a clean

or find them said juanna still look befor her
then there wa silenc for a minut or more till leonard believ
that he had got hi answer began to think that he would do well to
leav her for a while just as he wa about to rise juanna made a gentl
movement slowli veri slowli she turn herself slowli she stretch
out her arm toward him and laid her head upon hi breast
for a moment leonard wa astound he could scarc believ the

impati for juanna word brought back to hi mind vision of

so he told her that and much more speak to her earnestli hopefulli
and most tenderli as a man might speak to the woman whom he worship
and with whom is about to travel to that shore of which we know noth
though dai and night we hear the wave that bear us forward break yonder
on it beach thei talk for long and ever while thei talk juanna
grew gentler and more human as the barrier of pride melt in the fire
of her passion and the shadow of death gather thicker upon her and the
man she love at length her strength gave wai utterli and she wept upon
leonard breast like some frighten child and from weep sank into
deep slumber or swoon he knew not which then he kiss her upon the
forehead and carri her to her bed laid her down to rest awhil
befor she di return himself to the throneroom
here he found francisco and otter

chapter xxxi
the white dawn
lift juanna in hi arm leonard hurri from the sleep apart
to the throneroom where he halt hesit for he did not know what
wa to happen next soa who had preced him surround by the four
priest and with a torch in her hand stood against that wall of the
chamber where she had lain bound on the night of the drug of otter
baldpat ha faint with fear he is a coward she said to the
priest point to the burden in leonard arm open the secret wai
and let us pass on
then a priest came forward and press upon a stone in the wall which
gave wai leav a space suffici larg for him to insert hi hand
and pull upon some hidden mechan with all hi forc thereon a piec
of the wall swung outward as though upon a pivot reveal a flight of
step beyond which ran a narrow passag soa descend first bear
the light which she wa care to hold in such a wai as to keep the
figur of leonard and the burden that he bore in compar dark
after her went two priest follow by leonard carri juanna the
rear be brought up by the remain priest who close the secret
door behind them
so that is how it is done thought leonard to himself turn hi
head to watch the process no detail of which escap him
otter who had follow leonard from juanna chamber saw them go
though from some littl distanc for like a cat the dwarf could see
in the dark when the rock had close again he return to francisco
who sat upon the bed lost in prayer or thought
i have seen how thei make a hole in the wall he said and pass
through it doubtless our comrad the settlement men went that wai
sai shall we try it
what is the us otter answer the priest the road lead onli to
the dungeon of the templ if we got so far we should be caught there
and everyth would be discov includ thi trick and he
point to the robe of aca which he wore
that is true said otter come then let us go and sit upon the
throne and wait till thei fetch us
so thei went to the great chair and sat themselv down in them
listen to the tramp of the guard outsid the doorwai here francisco
resum hi prayer while otter sang song of the deed that he had
done and more especi a veri long on which he had compos upon the
take of the slave campto keep hi heart aliv as he explain to
francisco
a quarter of an hour pass and the curtain were drawn asid admit
a band of priest head by nam and bear two litter
now silenc otter whisper francisco draw hi hood over hi
face
here sit the god said nam wave the torch that he carri toward
the two quiet figur on the throne descend ye god that we mai
bear you to the templ and seat you in a lofti place whenc ye shall
watch the glori of the rise sun
then without more ado otter and francisco came down from their seat
and took their place in the litter present thei felt themselv
be born forward at a consider speed when thei were outsid the
palac gate otter peep through the curtain in the hope of perceiv
some chang in the weather in vain the mist wa denser than usual
although it grew grei with the light of the come dawn now thei were
at those gate of the templ that were nearest to the coloss idol and
here at the mouth of on of the numer underground passag guard
assist them to descend
farewel queen whisper the voic of olfan into francisco ear
i would have given my life to save you but i have fail as it is i
live to aveng you upon nam and all hi servant
francisco made no answer but press on down the passag hold hi
head low soon thei were at the foot of the idol and led by priest
began to ascend the stairwai in the interior of the statu up thei
toil slowli in the utter dark inde to francisco thi the last
journei of hi life seem the longest
at length thei emerg upon the head of the colossu where neither of
them had been befor it form a flat platform about eight feet squar
quit unprotect at the edg beneath which curv the sheer outlin
of the sculptur head the ivori throne whereon juanna had sat when
first she visit the templ wa gone and instead of it place at
the veri verg of the forehead were two wooden stool upon which the
victim must seat themselv from thi horribl elev could be seen
that narrow space of rock between the feet of the colossu and the wall
of the pool where wa the stone altar although ow to the slope of
the bow head he who stood upon it almost overhung the water of the
well
otter and francisco seat themselv on the stool and behind them nam
and three other priest took their stand nam place himself in such
a posit that hi companion could not see anyth of francisco
slight form which thei believ to be that of the shepherdess
hold me otter whisper francisco my sens will leav me and i
shall fall
shut your ey and lean back then you will see noth answer
otter moreov make readi your medicin for the time is at hand
it is readi he answer mai i be forgiven the sin for i cannot
bear to be hurl live to the snake
otter made no answer but set himself to watch the scene beneath him
the templ wa fill with mist that from the great height look like
smoke and through thi veil he could just distinguish the black and
move mass of the vast assembl who had sat the long night through
wait to wit the consumm of the tragedi while the sound of
their voic as thei spoke togeth in hush tone reach him like
that of the murmur of distant water behind him stood the four
priest or execution in a solemn silent line their ey fix
upon the grei mist while abov them around them and beneath them wa
noth but sheer and giddi space
it wa a hideou posit heighten by everi terror that man and
natur can command and even the intrepid dwarf who fear neither
death nor devil and over whom religi doubt had no power began to
feel it chill influenc grip hi heart as for francisco such
mind as he had left to him wa taken up with fervent prayer so it is
possibl that he did not suffer so much as might have been expect
five minut or more pass thu then a voic spoke from the mist
below sai
ar those who ar name aca and jal on high o priest
thei ar on high answer nam
is it the hour of dawn o priest said the voic again and thi time
otter knew it for that of the spokesman of the elder
not yet awhil answer nam and he glanc at the snow peak that
tower thousand of feet into the air behind and abov the templ
inde everi ey in that assembl wa stare at thi peak although it
gigant outlin could onli be seen dimli through the mist dimli as
the shape of a corps buri in a windingsheet of snow here upon the
loftiest precipic of the mountain the full light of morn struck
first and struck alwai for their pinnacl soar far abov the level
of the mist wreath and by the qualiti of that light thi peopl judg
the weather of the newborn dai if the snow wa rosyr then thei
knew that er long the sun would shine upon them if on the other hand
it gleam cold and white or still wors grei it wa a sign that the
come dai would be misti in the citi and on the plain therefor in
thi the hour of the trial of the god whom thei had set up all that
compani watch the mountain peak as thei had never watch befor to
see if it should show white or red
veri gradual the light increas and it seem to otter that the mist
wa somewhat thinner than wa usual at thi hour though as yet it hung
dens between them and the mountain snow now he could trace the
wall of the amphitheatr now he could see the black shimmer of the
water beneath and distinguish the glitter of mani hundr of upturn
eyebal as thei glare at him and beyond him the silenc grew more and
more intens for none spoke or move all were wait to see the dawn
break upon the slope of snow and wonderingwould it be red or white
must the god die or live so intens and fear wa the hush unbroken
by a breath of air or the call of a bird that otter could bear it no
longer but suddenli burst into song
he had a fine deep voic and it wa a zulu warsong that he sang a
triumphant paean of the rush of conquer impi interspers with the
wail of women and the groan of the dy louder and louder he sang
stamp hi nake feet upon the rock while the peopl wonder at the
marvel sure thi wa a god thei thought who chant thu exultingli
in a strang tongu while men wait to see him cast into the jaw of
the snake no mortal about to die so soon and thu terribl could find
the heart to sing and much less could he sing such a song as that thei
heard
he is a god cri a voic far awai and the cry wa echo on everi
side till at length suddenli men grew silent and otter also ceas
from hi sing for he had turn hi head and seen lo the veil of
mist that hid the mountain upper height grew thinit wa the moment
of dawn but would it be a red dawn or a white as he look the vapour
disappear from the peak though thei still lai thick upon the slope
below and in their place were seen it smooth and shine outlin
cloth in a cloak of everlast snow
the ordeal wa end no touch of colour no golden sunbeam or crimson
shadow stain the ghastli surfac of those snow thei were pallid as
the face of the dead
a white dawn a white dawn roar the populac awai with the fals
god hurl them to the snake
it is finish whisper otter again into francisco ear now take
your medicin and friend farewel
the priest heard and clasp hi thin hand togeth turn hi
torment face in which the soft ey shone upward toward the
heaven for some second he sat thu then otter peer beneath hi
hood saw hi counten chang and onc more a glori seem to shine
upon it as it had shone when some hour sinc francisco promis to do
the deed that now he wa about to dare
again there wa silenc below for the spokesman of the council of
elder had risen and wa cry the formal question to the priest
abov
is the dawn white or red ye who stand on high
nam turn and look upon the snow
the dawn is fulli dawn and it is white he answer
be swift whisper otter into francisco ear
then the priest rais hi right hand to hi lip as though to partak
of the sacrament of death
a moment later and he let it fall with a sigh whisper back to otter
i cannot it is a deadli sin thei must kill me for i will not kill
myself
befor the dwarf could answer natur more merci than hi
conscienc did that for francisco which he refus to do for himself
for of a sudden he swoon hi face turn ashen and slowli he began to
sink backward so that he would have fallen had not nam who saw that
he had faint with fear caught him by the shoulder and held him
upright
the dawn is white we see it with our ey answer the spokesmen of
the elder o ye who stand on high cast down the fals god accord
to the judgment of the peopl of the mist
otter heard and knew that the moment had come to leap for now he need
troubl himself with francisco no more
swiftli he turn hi head look at nam for he would know if he
might carri out a purpos that he had form it wa to seiz the high
priest and bear him to the depth below
it wa not possibl he wa out of reach moreov were he to snatch
nam awai francisco would fall backward and the other might see that
thi wa not the shepherdess otter stood up upon hi feet and kick
the stool on which he had sat off the platform he watch it flight
it flew into the water never touch the rock and then the dwarf knew
that he had plan well
now nam and on priest seiz the faint form of francisco and the
other two step toward otter the dwarf wait till their hand were
outstretch to grasp him then suddenli he sprang at the man upon hi
right and shout come thou with me he grip him about the middl
in hi iron grasp and put out all hi strength hurl himself and
hi burden into sheer space beneath
the priest shriek aloud and a gasp of wonder went up from the
watch thousand as the dwarf and hi victim rush downward like a
stone thei clear the edg of the pool by an inch or twono more and
struck the boil water sink through them till otter thought thei
would never rise again but at last thei did rise then otter loos the
dead or senseless priest and at that moment the bodi of francisco cast
thither by nam struck the water besid him and straightwai vanish for
ever
otter loos hi grip and dive beneath the surfac swam hard for the
north side of the pool for there he had notic that the current wa
least strong and there also the rock bank overhung a littl he reach
it safe and rise onc more grasp a knob of rock with on hand
and lai still where in the shadow and the swirl of water he could not
be discov by ani watch from abov he breath deepli and move
hi limb it wa well he wa unhurt the priest whom he had taken with
him be heaviest had met the water first so that though the leap
wa great the shock had been littl
ha said otter to himself thu far my spirit ha been with me and
here i could lie for hour and never be seen but there is still the
snake to contend with and hastili he seiz the weapon that he had
construct out of the two knive and unwound a portion of the cord
that wa fast about hi middl then again he look across the surfac
of the water some ten fathom from him in the exact centr of the
whirlpool the bodi of the priest wa still visibl for the vortex bore
it round and round but of francisco there wa noth to be seen onli
thirti feet abov him otter could see line of head bend over the
rocki edg of the pool and gaze at the priest as he wa toss about
like a straw in an eddi
now if he is still there and awak thought otter sure the father
of crocodil will take thi bait therefor i shall do best to be still
awhil and see what happen
as he reflect thu a louder shout than ani he had heard befor reach
hi ear from the multitud in the templ abov him so tumultu a
shout inde that for a few moment even the turmoil of the water wa
lost in it
now what chanc up there i wonder thought otter again then hi
attent wa divert in a somewhat unpleas fashion
thi wa the caus of that shout a miracl or what the peopl of the
mist took to be a miracl had come about for suddenli for the first
time within the memori of man the white dawn had chang to red
bloodr wa the snow upon the mountain and lo it peak were turn
to fire
for a while all those who wit thi phenomenon stood aghast then
there aros that babel of voic which had reach the ear of otter as
he lurk under the bank of rock
the god have been sacrif unjustli yell the peopl thei ar
true god see the dawn is red
the situat wa curiou and most unexpect but nam who had been a
high priest for more than fifti year prove himself equal to it
thi is a marvel inde he cri when silenc had at length been
restor for no such thing is told of in our histori as that a white
dawn upon the mountain should turn to red yet o peopl of the mist
those whom we thought god have not been offer up wrongfulli nai
thi is the mean of the sign now ar the true god aca and jal
appeas becaus those who dare to usurp their power have gone down to
doom therefor the curs is lift from the land and the sunlight ha
come back to bless us
as he finish speak again the tumult broke out some cry thi
thing and some that but no action wa taken for nam excus wa readi
and plausibl and the mind of men were confus so the assembl broke
up in disord onli the priest and as mani more as could find place
olfan among them crowd round the edg of the pool to see what
happen in it depth
meanwhil otter had seen that which caus him to think no more of the
shout abov him than of the hum of last year gnat suffer
hi ey to travel round the circumfer of the rocki wall he saw
the mouth of a circular hole situat immedi under the base of
the idol which mai have measur some eight feet in diamet the lower
edg of thi hole stood about six inch abov the level of the pool
and water ran out of it in a thin stream pass down thi stream
half swim and half waddl appear that huge and ungainli reptil
which wa the real object of the worship of the peopl of the mist
great as were it length and bulk the dwarf saw it but for a few
moment so swift were it movement then the creatur vanish into
the deep water to reappear present by the side of the dead priest
who wa now begin to sink it horribl head rose upon the water as
on that night when the woman had been thrown to it it open it huge
jaw and seiz the bodi of the man across the middl it disappear
beneath the foam otter watch the mouth of the hole and not in vain
for befor he could have count ten the monster wa crawl through
it bear it prei into the cave
now onc more the dwarf felt afraid for the snake or rather the
crocodil at close quarter wa far more fear than anyth that hi
imagin had portrai keep hi place beneath the ledg which
except for the cold of the water he found himself abl to do with
littl fatigu or difficulti otter search the wall of the pool
seek for some possibl avenu of escap sinc hi ardour for
person conflict with thi reptil had evapor but search as he
would he could find noth the wall were full thirti feet high and
slope inward like the side of an invert funnel wherev the exit
from the pool might be thei were invis also notwithstand hi
strength and skill otter did not dare to swim into the furiou eddi to
look for them
on thing he notic inde immedi abov the entranc to the
crocodil den and some twenti feet from the level of the water two
hole were pierc in the rock six feet or so apart each measur
about twelv inch squar but these hole were not to be reach and
even if reach thei were too small to pass so otter thought no more of
them
now the cold wa begin to nip him and he felt that if he stai
where he wa much longer he would becom paralyz by it for it wa fed
from the ic and snow abov therefor it would seem that there wa but
on thing to doto face the water dweller in hi lair to thi then
otter made up hi mind albeit with loath and a doubt heart
chapter xxxii
how otter fought the water dweller
keep himself carefulli under the overshadow edg of the rockbank
and hold hi doubleblad knife readi in on hand otter swam to the
mouth of the snake den as he approach it he perceiv by the great
upward forc of the water that the real bodi of the stream enter
the pool from below the hole where the crocodil live be but a
supplementari exit which doubtless the river follow in time of
flood
otter reach the mouth of the tunnel without ani great difficulti and
watch hi chanc he lift himself on hi hand and slip through
it quickli for he did not desir to be seen by those who were gather
abov nor inde wa he seen for hi red headdress and the goatskin
cloak had been wash awai or cast off in the pool and in that light
hi black bodi made littl show against the black rock beneath
now he wa insid the hole and found himself crouch upon a bed of
sand or rather disintegr rock brought down by the water the
gloom of the place wa great but the light of the white dawn which had
turn to red wa gather swiftli on the surfac of the pool without
as the mist melt and thenc wa reflect into the tunnel so it
came about that veri soon otter who had the gift not uncommon among
savag of see in anyth short of absolut dark wa abl to
make out hi surround with toler accuraci the place in a corner
of which he squat wa a cave of no great height or width hollow in
the solid rock by the forc of water as smoothli as though it had been
hewn by the hand of man in short an enorm natur drainpip but
construct of stone instead of earthenwar
in the bottom of thi drain trickl a stream of water nowher more than
six inch in depth on either side of which for ten feet or more lai
a thick bed of debri ground small how far the cave stretch of cours
he could not see nor as yet could he discov the whereabout of it
hideou occup though trace of it presenc were plenti for the
sandi floor wa mark with it huge footprint and the air reek with
an abomin stink
where ha thi evil spirit gone to thought otter he must be near
and yet i can see noth of him perhap he live further up the cave
and he crept a pace or two forward and again peer into the gloom
now he perceiv what had hitherto escap him name that some eight
yard from the mouth of the tunnel a tableshap fragment of stone rose
from it floor to within six feet of the roof have on the hither side
a slope plane that connect it summit with the streamb beneath
doubtless thi fragment or boulder be of some harder materi than
the surround rock had resist the wear of the rush river the
top of it as wa shown by the highwat mark on the side of the
cave be abov the level of the torrent which although it wa now
repres onli by a rivulet evid at certain season of the year
pour down with great forc and volum
here is a bed on which a crocodil might sleep reflect otter
creep a littl further forward and stare at the mass of rock and
more especi at a triangularshap object that wa pois on the top
of the slope plane and on someth which lai beneath it
now if that thing be anoth stone thought otter again how come
it that it doe not slip into the water as it should do and what is
that upon which it rest and he took a step to on side to prevent hi
bodi from intercept ani portion of the rai of light that momentarili
shone clearer and pierc the dark of the cave to a greater
distanc
then he look again and almost fell in hi horror for now he could see
all the thing that he had taken for a stone set upon the rocktabl
wa the head of the dweller in the water for there in it as the light
struck on them two dread ey gleam with a dull and chang fire
moreov he discov what wa the object which lai under the throat
of the reptil it wa the bodi of that priest whom otter had taken
with him in hi leap from the statu for he could see the dead face
project on on side
perhap if i wait awhil he will begin to eat him reflect the
dwarf rememb the habit of crocodil and then i can attack him
when he rest and sleep afterward and act on thi idea he stood
still watch the green fire as it throb and quiver wax and
wane in the monster ey
how long he remain thu otter never knew but after a time he becam
consciou that these ey had taken hold of him and were draw him
toward them though whether the reptil saw him or not he could not
tell for a space he struggl against thi unholi fascin then
overcom by dread he strove to fly back to the pool or anywher out
of reach of those devilish orb ala it wa too late no step could he
move backward no not to save hi life
now he must go on it wa as though the water dweller had read hi mind
and drew it foe toward itself to put the matter to the test otter
took on step forwardrath would he have sprung again off the head of
the colossusand the ey glow more dreadfulli than ever as though
in triumph
then in despair he sank to the ground hide hi face in hi hand and
groan in hi heart
thi is a devil that i have come to fight a devil with magic in hi
ey he thought and how can i who am but a common knobnos dwarf
do battl against the king of evil spirit cloth in the shape of a
crocodil
even now when he could not see them he felt the ey draw him yet
as thei were no longer visibl hi courag and power of mind came back
to him suffici to enabl him to think again
otter he said to himself if you stai thu soon the magic will do
it work your sens will leav you and that devil will eat you up as a
cobra devour a meercat ye he will swallow you and hi insid will
be your grave and that is no end for on who ha been call a god
men let alon god should die fight whether it be with other
men with wild beast with snake or with devil think now if your
master the deliver saw you crouch thu like a toad befor an adder
how he would laugh and sai ho i thought thi man brave ho he talk
veri loud about fight the water dweller he who came of a line of
warrior but now i laugh at him for i see that he is but a crossbr
cur and a coward
ye ye you can hear hi word otter sai now will you bear their
shame and sit here until you ar snap up and swallow
thu the dwarf address himself and it seem to hi bewild brain
that the word which he had imagin were true and that leonard realli
stood by and mock him
at last he sprang to hi feet and cry never baa so loudli that
the cave rang with the echo of hi shout he rush straight at the
foe hold the twoblad knife in hi right hand
the crocodil that wa wait for him to fall insens as had
ever been the custom of the live victim on whom it fix it bane
glare heard hi cry and awok from it seem torpor it lift it
head fire seem to flash from it dull ey it vast length began to
stir higher and higher it rear it head then of a sudden it leap
from the slope of rock as allig when disturb leap from a river
bank into the water come so heavili to the ground that the shock
caus the cave to trembl and stood befor the dwarf with it tail
arch upward over it back
again otter shout half in rage and half in terror and the sound
seem to make the brute more furiou
it open it huge mouth as though to seiz him and waddl a few pace
forward halt within six feet of him now the dwarf chanc had
come and he knew it for with the opportun all hi courag and skill
return to him it wa he who sprang and not the crocodil he sprang
he thrust hi arm and the doubl knife far into the yawn mouth and
for a second held it there on end point upward to the brain and
on to the tongu beneath he felt the jaw close but their row of
yellow fang never touch hi arm for there wa that between them
which held them some littl space apart then he cast himself on on
side and to the ground leav the weapon in the reptil throat
for a few moment it shook it horribl head while otter watch
gasp for the reek of the brute breath almost overpow him
twice it open it great jaw and spat and twice it strove to close
them oh what if it should rid itself of the knife or drive it through
the soft flesh of the throat then he wa lost inde but thi it might
not do for the lower blade caught upon the jawbon and at each effort
it drove the sharp point of the upper knife deeper toward it brain
moreov so good wa the steel and so firm were the hide bind of
the handl shrunken as thei were with the wet that noth broke or
gave
now he will trampl me or dash me to piec with hi tail said otter
but as yet the snake had no such mindinde in it agoni it seem to
have forgotten the presenc of it foe it writh upon the floor of the
cave lash the rock with it tail and gasp horribl the while
then suddenli it start forward past him and the tough hide rope about
otter middl ran out like the line from the bow of a whaleboat when
the harpoon ha gone home in the quarri
thrice the dwarf spun round violent then he felt himself drag in
great jerk along the rocki floor which happili for him wa smooth
a fourth jerk and onc more he wa in the water of the pool ay and
be carri to it remotest depth
now he is mad thought otter who ti himself to such a fish as
thi for it will drown me er it di
had otter been ani other man doubtless thi would have been so but
he wa as nearli amphibi as a human be can be and could dive and
swim and hold hi breath ye and see beneath the surfac as well as
the anim from which he took hi name never did such gift stand their
owner in better stead than dure the minut of thi strang duel
twice the tortur reptil sank to the bottom of the pooland it depth
wa greatdrag the dwarf after it though as it chanc between
dive it rose to the surfac give him time to breath a third time
it dive and otter must follow iton thi occas to the mouth of on
of the subterranean exit of the water into which the dwarf wa suck
then the brute turn head up the pool with the speed of a hook
salmon and otter who had prai that the line would break now prai
that it might hold for he knew that even he could never hope to swim
against that undertow
it held and onc more thei rose to the surfac where the reptil
lai lash the water in it pain blood pour from it mouth and
nostril veri glad wa otter to be abl to breath again for dure
that last rush he had gone near to suffoc he lift hi head
inhal the air with great gulp and saw that the bank of the
pool were line with spectat who shout and surg in their mad
excit after that he did not see much more for a while sinc just
then it seem to occur to the crocodil for the first time that the man
alongsid of him wa the caus of hi suffer at least it wallow
round caus the water to boil about it horni side and charg
him with it fang it could not bite therefor it struck at him with
it tail
twice otter dive avoid the blow but the third time he wa not so
success for the reptil follow him into the deep water and dealt
him a fear stroke befor he could either sink or rise he felt the
rough scale cut into hi flesh and a sensat as though everi bone in
hi bodi wa break and hi ey were start from hi head faintli
and more faintli he struggl but in vain for now life and sens were
leav him togeth and everyth grew black
but suddenli there came a chang and otter knew vagu that again he
wa be drag through the water and over rock then dark took
him and he rememb no more
when the dwarf awok it wa to find himself ly on the floor of the
cave but not alon for by hi side twist into a last and hideou
contort lai the snake goddead the upper part of the doubl knife
had work itself into it brain and with a dy effort it sought
the den where it had live for centuri drag otter with it and
there expir how or when he knew not but the dwarf had triumph
befor him wa stretch the ancient terror of the peopl of the mist
the symbol and inde the object of their worship slain by hi skill
and valour
otter saw and bruis and shaken as he wa hi heart swell with
pride for had he not done a deed singlehand such as wa not told of
in the stori of hi land
oh that the baa were here to see thi sight he said as he crawl
along the length of hi dead enemi and seat himself upon it flat
and loathsom snout ala he cannot he ad but i prai that my
watch spirit mai spare my life that i mai live to sing the song of
the slai of the devil of the peopl of the mist wow that wa a
fight when shall a man see anoth and lo save for mani bruis and
the cut of the rope about my middl i am not greatli hurt for the
water broke the weight of hi tail when he smote me with it after all
it is well that the line held for it serv to drag me from the pool as
it had drag me into it otherwis i had sure drown there
see though it is nearli done with and grasp that end of the cord
which hung from the jaw of the crocodil he broke it with a jerk for
with the except of half a strand it wa frai through by the worn
fang
then have rest himself a littl and wash the worst of hi hurt
with water otter set himself to consid the posit first howev
he made an utterli ineffectu effort to extract the great knive
ten men could not have move them for the upper blade wa driven mani
inch deep into the bone and muscl of the reptil massiv head but
for thi chanc it would have soon shaken itself clear of them but
as it wa everi contort and gnash of it jaw had onli serv to
drive the steel deeperup to the hilt inde
abandon thi attempt the dwarf crept cautious to the mouth of the
cave and peer at the further bank of the pool whenc he could hear
shout and see men move to and fro appar in a state of great
excit
now i am weari of that pool he said to himself and if i am seen
in it the great peopl will sure shoot at me with arrow and kill me
what shall i do then i cannot stai in thi place of stink with the
dead devil and the bone of those whom he ha devour until i die of
hunger yet thi water must come from somewher therefor it seem best
that i should follow it awhil search for the spot where it enter
the cave it will be dark walk but the wall and the floor ar
smooth so that i shall not hurt myself and if i find noth i can
return again and strive to escap from the pool by night
have decid upon the adventur otter began to carri it out with
characterist prompt the more readili inde becaus hi long
immers the water had chill him and he felt a weari creep
over him as a result of the terribl struggl and emot that he had
pass through
coil the hide ripe about hi middl which wa sadli cut by it
chafe he start with an uncertain gait for he wa still veri weak
a few step brought him to that rock on which he had discov the
head of the reptil and he paus to examin it climb the slope
stoneno easi task for it wa smooth as iceh came to the tablelik
top on it edg lai the bodi of that priest who had share hi fall
from the head of the colossu
then he inspect the surfac of the rock and for the first time
understood how old that monster must have been which he had conquer
in singl combat for there where it bodi had lain from gener to
gener and perhap from centuri to centuri the hard materi wa
worn awai to the depth of two feet or more while at the top of the
slope stone wa a still deeper nich wherein it head repos as it
lai keep it sleepless watch on the water of the pool
around thi depress and strewn about the floor of the cave itself
were the remain of mani victim a consider number of whom had not
been devour in everi case howev the larger bone were broken and
from thi circumst otter judg that although it wa the custom of
thi dread reptil to crush the life out of all who were thrown to it
with a bite of it fang yet like that of other anim it appetit
wa limit and it wa onli occasion that it consum what it had
kill
the sight of these remain wa so unpleas and suggest that even
otter who certainli could not be call squeamish hasten to descend
the rock as he pass round it hi attent wa attract by the
skeleton of a man who from variou indic must have been aliv
within the last few week the bone were clad in a priest cloak
of which the dwarf who wa trembl with cold hasten to possess
himself as he pick up the robe he observ beneath it a bag of tan
oxhid that doubtless had onc been carri by the owner of the cloak
perhap he kept food in thi thought otter though what he who came
to visit the water dweller should want with food i cannot guess at
the least it will be bad by now so i will leav it and be gone onli a
vultur would stai for long in thi hous of the dead then he start
forward
for a few yard more he had light to guid hi step but veri soon the
dark becam complet still the cave wa not difficult to travel
for everywher the rock wa smooth and the water shallow all that he
need to do wa to walk straight on keep touch of on side of the
tunnel with on hand inde he had but two thing to fear that he
should fall into some pit and that he might suddenli encount anoth
crocodil for doubtless thought otter the devil wa marri
but otter fell into no hole and he saw no crocodil sinc as it
chanc the water dweller of the peopl of the mist wa a bachelor
when the dwarf had travel up a steep slope for rather more than half
an hour to hi intens joi he saw light befor him and hurri toward
it present he reach the further mouth of the cavern that wa almost
close by block of ic among which a littl water trickl creep
through an apertur he found himself upon the crest of the impass
precipic at the back of the citi and that befor him a vast glacier of
green ic stretch upward whereon the sun shone glorious
chapter xxxiii
trap
it will be rememb that some hour befor otter found himself in
the light of dai after hi conquest of the reptil god leonard found
himself in a veri differ place name in a secret passag bear
the senseless form of juanna in hi arm and be guid by soa
whither he knew not
on thei went through variou tunnel of the turn of which leonard
tri to keep count in hi mind till at length soa usher him into a
rockhewn cell that evid had been prepar for their recept
for on on side of it stood a bed cover with skin blanket and on the
other a tabl provid with the best food that the countri could offer
at a sign from soa he laid juanna down upon the bed whereon the woman
instantli threw a blanket over her so as to hide her face from the
ey of the curiou then of a sudden leonard felt himself seiz from
behind and while hi arm were held by two of the priest a third
under soa direct remov hi revolv and hunt knife which
weapon were carri awai
you treacher hag said leonard to soa be care lest i kill
you
to kill me deliver would be to kill yourself and anoth these
thing ar taken from you becaus it is not safe that you should have
them such toi ar not for angri children stai she said to a fourth
priest search hi pocket
the man did as he wa order place everyth that leonard had about
him such as hi watch francisco notebook and rosari and the great
rubi stone in a littl pile upon the tabl present he came to the
fragment of poison which wa wrap in a squar of kidskin soa took
it and after examin said
why deliver you have been borrow medicin that will bring you
bad luck if you keep it and go to a small apertur in the wall of
the cell she threw the tini packet out of it and after it a second
packet which leonard recognis as have been taken from juanna hair
there now you cannot hurt yourself she ad in portugues let me
tell you someth so long as you remain quiet all will be well but
if you attempt violenc or escap then you shall be bound and place by
yourself also you will bring about the death of the shepherdess yonder
be warn then by me white man and turn gentl for rememb that my
dai ha come at last and you ar in my power
that is veri clear my estim friend answer leonard control
hi wrath as best he might but for your sake i hope that the hour will
never come when you shall be in mine for then i mai rememb more than
you wish i do not in the least understand what you ar aim at nor
do i much care so long as a certain person is protect
do not fear deliver she shall be protect as you know well i
hate you and yet i keep you aliv becaus without you she might die
therefor for her sake be care attempt no violenc toward me or my
father if we visit you alon for we shall do so in order that she mai
not be discov and the moment that you lift a hand against us will
be the begin of her doom and now i must leav you for a while
for someth pass in the templ which i desir to see if she awak
befor i return be care not to frighten her farewel
then soa went take the priest with her and the massiv timber door
wa close upon them
after he had restor hi variou belong to hi pocket the
revolv and the knife which had been remov except leonard turn
down the rug and look at juanna who appear to be plung in a deep
and happi sleep for there wa a smile upon her face next he examin
the place where thei were confin it had two door that by which thei
had enter and a second of equal solid the onli other open wa
the slit out of which soa had drop the poison it wa shape like an
invert loophol the narrow end face inward thi apertur attract
leonard attent both on account of it unusu form and becaus
of the sound that reach him through it of these the first and
most pervad wa a nois of rush water then after a while he
distinguish a roar as of a multitud shout that wa repeat again
and again at interv now he knew where thei must be thei were hidden
awai in the rock of the templ somewher in the immedi neighbourhood
of the rage pool that lai in front of the colossu and these sound
which he heard were the clamour of the peopl who watch the fate of
otter and francisco
thi convict wa terribl enough but had he known that as it
enter hi mind the bodi of hi friend the priest wa travel on
it last journei within four feet of hi ey leonard might have been
even more prostrat than he wa
for an hour or more the shout continu then follow a silenc
broken onli by the everlast murmur of the water without
when soa depart she had left a fragment of dip made of goatfat
burn upon the floor but veri soon thi expir leav them in
dark now howev light began to flow into the dungeon through the
slit in the rock and it seem to leonard that the charact of thi
light wa clearer than that to which thei had been accustom in thi
gloomi land
after a while leonard sat down upon a stool which he place close to
juanna bed just where the beam of light pierc the shadow
and groan aloud in the bitter of hi heart it wa over the
pureheart martyr francisco wa dead and with him otter hi
faith friend and servant except soa who had becom an activ
enemi at least so far as he wa concern of all who travel to thi
hellish countri juanna and he alon were left aliv and sooner or later
fate must overtak them also the greatest and last failur of hi life
wa about to be consumm and he would go down into a nameless
grave there to be lost have for mani year suffer and toil to no
purpos pursu a chimera
juanna still slept heavili under the influenc of the drug and he wa
glad of it for when she woke it must be to a wors miseri than ani
that had gone befor partli for someth to do and partli becaus
the crave of natur made themselv felt even through hi sorrow
leonard turn to the tabl and at and drank of the viand there
though not without fear that thei might be doctor as the food took
effect upon him some share of hope and courag enter into hi heart
for it is a true sai that a full stomach make a brave man after all
thei two still breath and were unharm in bodi nor wa it absolut
certain that thei would be call upon to give up the ghost at present
thi wa much
moreov he had live long enough to win the love of the fearless
and beauti girl who slept besid him and though perhap under such
circumst love howev true and passion ceas to occupi a
command place in a man heart even then he felt that thi wa more
and that happier dai might dawn when it would be if not everyth at
least most of all
as he thought thu he saw colour creep into juanna pale face then
she sigh open her ey and sat up
where am i she said glanc round wildli thi is not the bed on
which i lai down oh she start is it over
hush dear hush i am with you said leonard take her hand

i believ so leonard repli bow hi head to hi breast we ar
prison in a secret cell beneath the feet of the statu there ha
been great nois and confus without and now for some time silenc
then juanna sprang up and stood over him with flash ey
how dare you do thi she said who gave you leav to do it i
thought that you were a man now i see that you ar a coward
juanna said leonard it is useless for you to talk like thi
whatev wa done wa done for your sake not for that of anybodi els
oh ye you sai so but i believ that you made a plot with soa to
murder francisco in order that you might save your own life i have done

he paus and look at her as she sat on the edg of the couch bite
her lip and glanc toward him now and again with a curiou express
on her beauti face in which grief pride and anger all had their
share yet at that moment juanna wa think not of francisco and hi
sacrific but of the man befor her whom she had never love so well
as now when he spoke to her thu bitterli pai her back in her own
coin
i cannot pretend to match you in scold and violenc she said

infatu from the first moment of their meet and also of hi

juanna read thi touch and nobleheart adieu with an evergrow
wonder and when she had finish it put down the book cry aloud
oh what have i done to deserv such devot as thi then with a
strang and bewild inconsequ she flung herself into leonard
arm and buri her head upon hi breast she began to weep
when she wa somewhat calmer he also read the letter and close the
book sai
the world is poorer by a perfect gentleman he wa too good for ani of
us juanna
i think so she answer
just then thei heard a sound without the door it open and nam
enter accompani by soa
deliver said the ag priest whose counten and troubl ey
bore trace of mani conflict emot and you shepherdess i come
to speak with you as you see i am alon except for thi woman but
should you attempt ani violenc toward her or me that will be the
signal for your death with much toil and at no littl risk to myself
i have spare the life of the shepherdess caus the white man your
companion to be offer up in her place
ha that offer been accomplish broke in leonard who could not
restrain hi anxieti to learn what had happen
i will be frank with you deliver answer the highpriest when
juanna had translat hi question sinc the truth cannot hurt me for
now we know too much of on anoth secret to wast time in bandi
li i know for instanc that the shepherdess and the dwarf ar
no god but mortal like ourselv and you know that i have dare to
affront the true god by chang the victim whom thei had chosen the
sacrific ha been accomplish but with so mani sign and wonder that
i am bewild the peopl of the mist ar bewild also so that
none know what to think the white man your companion wa hurl
faint into the water when the dawn had broken upon the mountain and
wa seen to be grei but the dwarf your servant did not wait to have
that offic done for him for he sprang thither himself ay and took
on with him
bravo otter cri leonard i knew that you would die hard
hard did he die inde deliver said nam with a sigh so hard that
even now mani swear that he wa a god and not a man scarc had thei
all vanish into the pool when a wonder chanc such as ha not
been told of in our record deliver the white dawn turn to red
perchanc as i cri to calm the peopl becaus the fals god had met
their doom
then the true on must be singularli blind said juanna see that
i whom you dare to call a fals god am still aliv
thi argument silenc nam for a moment but present he answer
ye shepherdess you ar still aliv he said lai a curiou
emphasi on the still and inde he ad hastili if you ar
not foolish you mai long remain so both of you for i have no desir to
shed your blood who onli seek to end my last dai in peac but listen
to the end of the tale while the peopl wonder at the omen of the
chang dawn it wa seen that the dwarf your servant wa not dead
there in the pool ye thi wa seen deliver to and fro in the
troubl water rush the great water dweller and after him keep
pace with him went that dwarf who wa name otter ay round and round
and down to the lowest depth though how it could be that a man might
swim with the snake none can sai
oh bravo otter said leonard again bethink him of an explan
of the mysteri which he did not reveal to nam well what wa the end
of it
that none know for certain deliver answer the priest
perplexedli at last the water dweller from whose mouth pour blood
wa seen to sink with the dwarf then he rose again and enter the
cave hi home but whether the dwarf enter with him or no i cannot
sai for some swear on thing and some anoth and in the foam and
shadow it wa hard to see moreov none will ventur there to learn
the truth
well dead or aliv he made a good fight for it said leonard and
now nam what is your busi with us
thi question appear to puzzl the priest a littl for to speak
truth he did not care to disclos the exact natur of hi busi
which wa to separ leonard from juanna without forc if possibl
i came here deliver he answer to tell you what had happen
exactli said leonard to tell me that you have murder my best
friend and on who wa but late your god i thank you for your new
nam and now if i might make bold to ask it what ar your plan with
refer to ourselvesi mean until it suit you to send us after our
companion
believ me deliver my plan is to save your live if the other
have been sacrif it wa no fault of mine for there ar forc
behind me that i cannot control even when i guid them the land is in
confus and full of strang rumour i know not what mai happen dure
the next few dai but till thei ar over you must lie hid thi is a
poor place in which to dwell but there is none other safe and secret
still here is anoth chamber which you can us perchanc you have
alreadi seen it and place hi hand upon what appear to be a
latch he open the second door which leonard had notic previous
reveal a cell of veri similar construct to that in which thei
were and of somewhat larger size
see deliver he went on here is the place and he step
forward to enter the cell then drew back as though in courtesi to allow
leonard to pass in befor him
for onc leonard caution forsook him for at the moment he wa
think of other thing almost mechan he pass the threshold
scarc were hi feet over it when he rememb the charact of hi
host and the lodg and turn quickli to come back
it wa too late for even as he turn the heavi timber door close in
hi face with a crash and he wa cage
chapter xxxiv
nam last argument
for a moment juanna stood stupefi for the manoeuvr had been so
sudden that at first she could scarc realis it result
now shepherdess began nam blandli we can talk in privat for i
have word to sai to you which it is not fit that other ear should
hear
you fiend she answer fierc then comprehend that violenc or
remonstr would be useless she ad speak on i hear you
listen shepherdess and for your own sake i implor you do not give
wai to grief or rage i swear to you that no harm shall come to yonder
man if you will but do my bid shepherdess you ar found out i
know and the peopl know that you ar no goddess it had been safer to
sacrific you todai but partli becaus of the plead of my daughter
who love you and partli for other reason i have caus you to be
save aliv now shepherdess from thi countri there is no escap as
you have chosen to come hither here you must remain for life and in
thi cell you cannot live and die therefor for my daughter sake
i have cast about for a mean to deliv you from bond and to set you
high in the land ay almost at it head and he paus
perhap you will come to the point said juanna who wa trembl
with fear and anger
it is thi shepherdess nam answer bow although you ar
dethron as a goddess you mai still shine as a queen and rule over us
as the wife of our king
inde repli juanna turn suddenli cold and how shall i who
am held to be dead appear again as a woman wed to your king sure
the peopl would find that strang nam
no shepherdess for i have prepar a tale which shall explain the
wonder and alreadi it rumour run from mouth to mouth it will be said
that you were a goddess and therefor immort but that for the sake of
love you have put off your godhead and put on the flesh that you might
dwell for some year with him whom you desir
inde said juanna again and what if i refus to consent to thi
scheme which as i think can have come onli from a woman brain and
she point to soa
you ar right shepherdess answer soa the plan is mine i made
it to save you and also she ad coolli to be reveng upon that
white thief who love you for he shall live to see you the wife of
anoth man a wild man
and have you never thought soa that i mai have wish of my own in
thi matter
doubtless yet the fairest women cannot alwai have what thei mai
chanc to wish know shepherdess that thi must be both for your own
sake and for the sake of nam my father olfan love you and in these
troubl time it is necessari that nam and the priest should gain hi
support which ha been bought but now by the promis that you will
be given to him in marriag on thi veri dai for you shepherdess
although you might have wish to wed on of your own race at the least
you will rule a queen and that is better than to perish miser
i think otherwis soa juanna answer calmli for she saw that
neither passion nor plead would help her and of the two i choos to
die and she put her hand to her hair then start for she found the
poison gone
you will choos to die shepherdess said soa with a cold smile but
thi is not alwai so easi i have taken your medicin from you while
you slept and here there ar no other mean to compass death
i can starv soa repli juanna with digniti
that take some time shepherdess and todai you will becom the wife
of olfan still it is need that you should yourself consent to marri
him for thi chief is so foolish that he declar that he will not wed
you till you have accept him with your own mouth and in the presenc
of wit
then i fear that the wed will not be celebr said juanna
with a bitter laugh for she could not refrain from give some outward
express to all the loath which she felt for thi wick woman who
in her fierc love would save the life of her mistress by sell her to
shame
i think that it will shepherdess answer soa for it seem that
we have a wai by which we can win you to speak those word which olfan
desir to hear
there is no wai soa
what none shepherdess think now he whom you name deliver is a
prison beyond that door what if hi life hang upon your choic
what if he were shown to you about to die a fear death from which you
alon could save him by speak a certain word
now for the first time juanna fulli understood the hideou natur of the
plot wherebi soa purpos either to forc her to becom the wife of a
savag or to thrust upon her the guilt of caus the death of the man
whom she love and she sank back upon the couch sai
you would have done better to leav me yonder in the slave camp soa
then abandon the tone of forc calm in which she had spoken
hitherto soa broke out bitterli
when you were in the slave camp shepherdess you love me who have
love you from a child for then no white dog had come to sow mischief
between us and to make you hate and distrust me then i would have di
for you ay and thi i would do now but also i would be reveng upon
the white dog for i who am husbandless and childless had but thi on
thing and he ha taken it from me you were to me as mother and lover
and babe ar to other womenmi all and now i am left desol and
i will be reveng upon him befor i die but i still love you
shepherdess and could ani other plan have been found to help you i
could not have forc thi marriag on you no such plan can be found
thu alon can you live and becom great and happi and thu alon can i
continu to feast my ey upon you though it be from far
she ceas trembl with the strength of the passion that shook her
to which inde her word had given but feebl express
go said juanna i would have time to think
then nam spoke again
we go shepherdess in obedi to your wish but befor even we
shall return to hear your answer do not attempt to work mischief upon
yourself for know that you will be watch though you cannot see the
ey that watch you if you do but so much as lift a hand against your
life or even strive to cut off the light that flow through yonder
hole then at onc you will be seiz and bound and my daughter will be
set to guard you shepherdess farewel
and thei went leav juanna alon and a prei to such thought as can
scarc be written
for sever hour she sat there upon the couch allow no hint of what
she felt to appear upon her face for she wa too proud to suffer the
ey which she knew were spy on her though whenc she could not
tell to read her secret anguish
as she sat thu in her desol sever thing grew clear to juanna
and the first of them wa that soa must be mad the love and hate that
seeth in her fierc heart had taint her brain make her more
relentless than a leopard rob of it young from the begin she
had detest leonard and been jealou of him and incauti enough he
had alwai shown hi dislik and distrust of her by slow degre these
feel had harden into insan and to gratifi the vile prompt
of her disord mind she would hesit at noth
from soa therefor she could hope for no relent nor had she
better prospect with nam for it wa evid that in hi case polit
consider oper as strongli as did those of a person charact
with hi daughter he wa so much involv he had commit himself so
deepli in thi matter of the fals god that rightli or wrongli he
conceiv soa plan to offer the onli feasibl chanc of escap from
the religi complic by which he wa surround that threaten
to bring hi life and power to a simultan end
it wa out of the question therefor to expect help from the
highpriest who wa in the posit of a man on a runawai hors with
precipic on either side of him unless inde she could show him
some safer path fail thi it would avail her noth that he hate
and fear olfan and onli promot thi marriag in order to bribe the
king into stand hi friend dure the expect polit convuls
inde as she guess rightli nam would much better like to know her
safe over the border of the mistland than to be call upon to greet
her as it queen thi wa obviou see that should she return to
power religi or tempor it wa scarc to be hope that she would
forget the wrong which she had suffer at hi hand the marriag wa
mere a temporari expedi design to ward off immedi evil but
should it come about and the crisi be tide over it wa plain that
the struggl between the fals goddess and the perjur priest must be
carri on until it end in the death of on or both of them howev
all these thing lai in the futur as nam foretold it a futur which
juanna never meant to live to see
there remain leonard and olfan the former of cours wa powerless
at least for the present have suffer himself to be entrap
though hi lack of caution matter littl for doubtless if guil
had fail forc would have been emploi it wa she who must save
leonard for he could do noth to save her
the more juanna thought of the matter the more she becam convinc
that her onli hope lai in olfan himself who had sworn friendship to
her and who certainli wa no traitor she rememb that in their
convers of the dai befor he had admit that she could be noth
to him while leonard live probabl nam had told her that the deliver
wa dead and then it wa actuat by hi passion which she knew to
be genuin enough that he had enter into a bargain with the priest
these must be the term of the compact that the game of the fals god
be plai olfan undertook to support nam and the rest of hi parti
to the best of hi power for the consider to be receiv of her
hand in marriag stipul howev that she should give it of her
own free will
thi of cours she would never do therefor olfan proviso gave her
a loophol of escap though juanna wa well awar that it would not
be wise to reli too implicitli on the generos of the savag chief in
matter upon which savag ar apt to be neither gener nor delic
on thi she must fall back as a last resourc or rather as a last
resourc but on meanwhil she would fight nam and soa step by step
yield onli when she saw that further obstinaci on her part would
involv leonard destruct it wa possibl inde it wa probabl
that everyth might fail her and in that event she must not fail
herself in other word although the poison had been taken from her
she must find a mean of death
have thought these problem out so far as it wa in her power to
do juanna rose and began to walk up and down the cell note it
construct and peculiar doubtless leonard wa behind yonder
door but it wa so thick that she could hear noth of hi movement
for the rest it seem clear that escap wa imposs except the
door the shaft in the rock wa the onli other open that she wa
abl to see but through thi no child could pass and if he might it
would be to fall into the pool of rage water
had otter live through the fight with the snake god she wonder
there wa small chanc of it but at least he had made an end worthi of
hi reput and she felt proud of him and the otherfrancisco of
him also she wa proud inde but for herself she wa asham for she
knew that she had been to blame though not designedli who would have
guess that thi frail timid man could prove himself such a hero or
who could estim the power of the unsought and unhappi love which
enabl him to conquer the fear of death
she had been wrong to be angri with leonard for she knew well that if
it could have been so he would gladli have given hi own life for her
ala it seem that she wa alwai wrong for her temper wa quick and
the tongu is an unruli member thei had both of them been readi to die
for her and on of them had done so well now it wa probabl that the
tabl would be turn befor mani hour were over and that she would
be call upon to offer herself to save her lover if thi came about
she would not forget the exampl of francisco but would rather try to
equal it in the heroism of her end
the dai pass slowli and at length the gloom gather in the littl
cell told her that night wa near befor it fell howev soa and nam
enter bear candl which thei fix upon bracket in the wall
we come shepherdess to hear your answer said nam will you consent
to take olfan for a husband or will you not
i will not consent
think again shepherdess
i have thought you have my answer
at the word nam seiz her arm sai come hither shepherdess i
would show you someth and he led her to that door in pass which
leonard had been entrap at the same time soa extinguish on of the
candl and take the other in her hand she left the cell bolt the
door behind her so that nam and juanna stood in dark
shepherdess said nam sternli you ar about to see him whom you
name the deliver now rememb thi if you cry out or speak abov a
whisperh di
juanna made no answer although she felt her heart grow faint within
her five minut or more pass and of a sudden a panel slid back in
the upper part of the door which connect the two cell so that juanna
could see through it although those who stood on the further side could
not see her for thei were in light and she wa in dark
and thi wa what she saw rang against the wall of the second prison
and opposit to her were three priest hold candl in their hand
whereof the light shone upon their sullen cruel face and the snake
head tattoo on their nake breast in front of these men stood two
other priest and between them wa leonard bound and gag
on the hither side of the cell and not more than two feet from the open
panel stood soa on whom the ey of the execution were fix as
though await a command between soa and these men yawn an open hole
in the rock floor
when juanna had gaze upon thi scene for some twenti second the
slide panel wa close appar by soa and nam spoke
you have seen shepherdess he said that the deliver is bound and
you have seen also that befor him is a hole in the floor of the prison
he who fall down that hole shepherdess find himself in the den of
the snake beneath from the visit of whom no man ha ever return
aliv for it is through it that we feed the waterdwel at certain
season of the year and when there is no sacrific now shepherdess
you must choos between two thing either to wed olfan of your own free
will thi night or to see the deliver thrown to the snake befor your
ey and afterward to wed olfan whether you will it or not what do
you sai shepherdess
juanna took counsel with herself and came to the conclus that she
would resist a littl longer for she thought that thi scene might have
been plan mere to try her fortitud
i refus to marri olfan she answer
then nam open the panel and whisper a word into the ear of soa who
utter a command instantli the two execution priest flung leonard
on to hi back upon the ground an easi task see that hi leg were
fasten with rope and drag him forward until hi head hung over
the oubliettelik hole then thei paus as though wait for some
further order nam drew juanna some few pace awai from the door
what is your word now shepherdess he said is the man to die or be
save speak swiftli
juanna glanc through the open and saw that now leonard head and
shoulder had vanish down the oubliett while on of the priest held
him by the ankl watch soa for the sign to let him fall
loos him said juanna faintli i will marri olfan
step forward nam whisper to soa who issu anoth order
thereupon the priest drew leonard from hi peril posit and
unwillingli enough roll him to the side of the cell for thei would
have prefer to be rid of him at that moment also the shutter wa
close
i said loos him repeat juanna now the man li unabl to move
like a fallen tree on the ground
no shepherdess repli nam perchanc you mai yet chang your mind
and then it would be troublesom to bind him afresh for he is veri
strong and violent listen shepherdess when olfan come present to
ask your hand you must sai noth of that man yonder for he deem
him to be dead and the moment you speak of him he will be dead do you
understand
i understand answer juanna but at least the gag might be taken
from hi mouth
fear not shepherdess it shall be donewhen you have spoken with
olfan and now at what hour will it be your pleasur to see him
when you will the sooner it is finish the better
good my daughter he ad to soa who just then enter the cell
be pleas to make fire and then summon the king olfan who wait
without
soa depart upon her errand and overcom with terror which she would
not show juanna sank upon the couch hide her face in her hand for
a while there wa silenc then the door open again and herald by
soa olfan the king stood befor her
be care shepherdess whisper nam as thei enter on wordand
the deliver di
chapter xxxv
be nobl or be base
for a while there wa silenc then juanna look up search olfan
face with her ey noth wa to be read there for it wa imposs
to pierc the mask of solemn calm beneath which in common with all
hi race the king wa accustom to hide hi thought he leant on the
shaft of hi broad spear hi head bow slightli as though in humil
hi dark ey fix upon her face immov impass a pictur of
savag digniti
inde juanna wa fain to confess to herself that she had never seen a
grander specimen of the natur man than that present by the chief of
the peopl of the mist as he stood befor her in her rock prison the
light of the candl fell full upon him reveal hi great girth and
statur besid which those of the finest men of her own race would
have seem insignific it shone upon the ivori torqu emblem of
royalti which were about hi neck wrist and ankl upon the glossi
garment of black goatskin that hung from hi shoulder and middl and
the raven tress of hi hair bound back from hi forehead by a narrow
band of white linen which show in strike contrast against the clear
oliv colour of hi face and breast
speak olfan said juanna at length
it wa told to me queen he answer in a low full voic that you
had word to sai to me nevertheless now as alwai i obei you queen
i learn that your husband he whom you love is dead and believ me i
sorrow for you in thi shame deed i had no hand that togeth with
the end of the other white man and the dwarf must be set down to the
account of thi priest who swear that he wa driven to it by the
clamour of the peopl queen thei have all gone across the mountain
and through the sky beyond and you like some weari dove far travel
from a southern clime ar left a prei among the eagl of the peopl of
the mist
but a few hour sinc i thought you dead also for with all the
thousand in the templ i believ that it wa your fair bodi which nam
hurl at dawn from the brow of the statu and i tell you that when i
saw it i who am a warrior wept and curs myself becaus although
i wa a king i had no power to save you afterward thi man the high
priest came to me tell me the truth and a plan that he had made for
hi own end wherebi you might be save aliv and lift up among the
peopl and he also might be save and my rule be made sure in the
land and he ceas
what is thi plan olfan ask juanna after a paus
queen it is that you should wed me and appear befor the peopl no
longer as a goddess but as a woman who ha put on the flesh for
her love sake i know well that i am all unworthi of such honour
moreov that your heart must be sore with the loss of on who wa
dear to you and littl set upon the find of anoth husband also
i rememb certain word that pass between us and a promis which i
made all these thing i told to nam and he answer me sai that
the matter wa urgent that here you could not be hid awai for long and
that if i did not take you to wife then you must die therefor becaus
my love toward you is great i said to him go now and ask her if she
will smile upon me if i come befor her with such word
nam went but befor he went he made certain agreement with me on
matter of polici under which i must pai a heavi price for you ladi
and forego reveng and forget mani an ancient hate all of which thing
i have promis to do should you smile upon me so great is my love
toward you the hour went by and nam came back to me sai that
have weigh the matter in your mind your answer wa favour to
thi i repli that i did not trust him and would take it from your
lip alon
and now queen i am here to listen to your word and to offer myself
to you to serv you all my life as your husband and your slave i have
littl to give you who have been bred up in sunnier land and among a
more gentl peopl i who am but the wild chief of men whose heart ar
rug as our mountain and gloomi as a winter dai that is heavi with
snow to comeonli myself the servic of my soldier spear and the
first place among the children of the mist
now let me hear your answer and be it what it mai i will accept it
without a murmur for least of all thing do i desir to forc myself
upon you in marriag still i prai you speak to me plainli onc and for
all for if i must lose you i would know the worst nor can i bear when
you have smile upon me to see you turn awai nai i would sooner die
and onc more he bow hi head lean upon hi spear and wa silent
juanna consid the posit rapidli it wa hopeless and cruel nam
and soa were on either side of her the latter stand near the door
with the slide panel beyond which leonard lai bound and she knew well
that did she speak a singl word of the truth to olfan it would be the
signal for her lover death it wa possibl that the king might be
abl to protect her own person from violenc but if leonard di it
matter littl what becam of her there wa but on thing that she
could dodeclar herself will to becom the wife of olfan yet it
seem shameless thu to treat thi honour man the onli friend
that thei had found among the peopl of the mist but of a truth
such necess as her cannot wait while those in their toil weigh
scrupl or the law of honour
olfan she said i have heard you and thi is my answer i will take
you as my husband you know my stori you know that he who wa my lord
is but thi dai dead here soa smile approvingli at the lie and that
i love him therefor of your gentl you will accord me some few
week befor i pass from him to you in which i mai mourn my widowhood
i will sai no more but sure you can guess the sorrow of my heart and
all that i have left unsaid
it shall be as you wish queen repli olfan take her hand and
kiss it while hi sombr face grew radiant with happi you
shall pass into my keep at that time which best pleas you yet i
fear that in on matter you must be troubl now thi veri hour
what mai that be olfan ask juanna anxious
onli thi queen that the rite of marriag as we practis it must be
celebr between us it is necessari for mani reason which will be
made clear to you tomorrow moreov such wa my bargain with nam
seal by an oath sworn upon the blood of aca an oath that i do not
dare to break
oh no no said juanna in acut distress think olfan how can i
whose husband is not six hour dead vow myself to anoth man upon the
altar of hi grave give me some few dai i prai you
most willingli would i do thi ladi but i mai not it is against my
oath also what can it matter you shall remain alon for so long as it
shall pleas you
then nam spoke for the first time sai
shepherdess wast no breath in word for learn that though thi
garment of modesti is becom to on new widow yet you must put it
from you more depend upon thi ceremoni than you know of the live
of mani hang upon it our own perchanc among them and especi the
life of on of whom it doe not becom me to speak and as though by
accid nam let hi ey rest upon the door of the adjoin cell
of hi auditor olfan thought that he wa allud to hi own life
but juanna and hi daughter knew well that he spoke of that of leonard
which would be sacrif did the former persist in her object to
the instant celebr of the marriag
you hear hi word queen said olfan and there is weight in them
the time ar veri danger and if our plot is to be carri through
befor midnight i must make oath to the captain and the council of the
elder that you have come back from death to be my wife
mayb answer juanna catch at a straw in her despair but
must i who shall be set over thi peopl as queen be marri thu in
secret at the least i will have wit let some of the captain
whom you trust olfan be brought here to see us wed otherwis the time
mai come when i shall be held to be no true wife and there ar none to
establish my honour by their word
there is littl fear of such a thing queen answer olfan with
a faint smile yet your demand ar just i will bring three of my
captain here men who will not betrai us and thei shall be wit to
thi rite and he turn as though he would go to seek them

king she said i am at your merci not through ani wanton folli of
my own but becaus fate ha made a sport of me king you have been

herself up and speak proudli and it were more worthi of you not
to listen to them king i have spoken now do your will be great or
littl be nobl or be base as your natur teach you
and suddenli she sank to the ground and shake her long hair about her

twice the king glanc at her then he turn hi head as though he dare
look no more and spoke keep hi ey fix upon the wall

so skill in the win of a bride need not seek my counsel as to the
open of a door for when i gave it but now upon the first of these
matter you would not hearken olfan but were melt by the sight of

juanna heard and from that moment made up her mind that whatev
happen she had done with soa nor wa thi wonder for few women
could have pardon what she had suffer at her hand
drive the spear into her till she speak comrad said olfan
then at the touch of steel soa gave up mock and told the secret of
the door
chapter xxxvi
how otter came back
after he had rest awhil at the bottom of the glacier otter set to
work to explor the cliff on the top of which he found himself with
the view of descend it and hide at it foot till nightfal when
he hope to find mean of reenter the citi and put himself in
commun with olfan veri soon howev he discov that if
he wa to return at all he must follow the same rout by which he had
come
evid the tunnel slope upward veri sharpli for he wa stand on
the brow of a precipic cut into three step which taken togeth mai
have measur some three hundr feet in height and so far as he could
see it wa utterli imposs to descend ani of these cliff without
the aid of rope nor could he continu hi investig over a wide
area for about four hundr pace to the left of the open to the
subterranean passagewhereof by the wai he wa veri care to note
the exact positionth mountain push out a snowi shoulder with
decliv so precipit that he dare not trust himself on them
then he tri the righthand side but with no better luck for here
he wa stop by a yawn rift in the rock now otter sat down and
consid the situat
the dai wa still young and he knew that it would be foolish to attempt
escap from the pool befor dark in front of him the mountain rose
steepli till so far as he could judg it reach a pass which lai some
two mile off at the base of that main peak on whose snow the priest
had watch the break of the dawn part of thi decliv wa cover
with block of green ic but here and there appear patch of earth
on which grew stunt tree shrub and even grass and flower be
veri hungri it occur to otter that he might find edibl root among
thi scanti veget
with thi hope he began to climb the slope to be reward in due cours
by the discoveri of a veget that he recognis for it wa the same
which had been offer to him on the occas of hi unlucki outbreak
that had result in the cast awai of the rubi
with thi poor food the dwarf fill himself and have found a bough
that made him an excel staff he continu hi climb desir to
see what there might be on the other side of the neck
arriv there without ani great difficulti otter stood astonish
although he wa not much given to the studi of sceneri below him lai
the citi of the mist with it shine belt of river that fed from the
inexhaust mountain snow meander across the vast plainsnow no
longer hidden in mistwhich thei had trodden on their journei abov
hi head the mighti peak tower thousand of feet into the air till it
end in a summit shape like a human finger point etern to the
heaven befor him the scene wa even stranger made up as it wa of
snowi field broken by ridg of black rock and laid on beneath the
other like white sail dry upon the slope of a sandhil
gradual as the ey travel downward these snowfield grew fewer
and fewer till at last thei vanish altogeth and their place wa
taken first by stretch of grassland and final at the foot of
the mountain by what seem to be a rich and level countri interspers
with clump of bush and forest tree
the first of these patch of snow lai within five furlong of where the
dwarf stood but sever hundr feet below him
between the neck of the pass and thi snow stretch a mighti rift or
chasm with side so sheer that no goat could have kept a foot on
them yet thi gulf wa not without it bridg for a rock wall rose
from the bottom of the chasm form the bed of a glacier which span
it from side to side in some place the wall wa compar level
and in other it show descent sharp as those of a waterfal thi
remark bridg of icethat vari from a hundr pace to a
few yard in widthwa border on either side by the most fear
precipic while just where it fall wa sheerest and it width
narrowest it seem to spring across a space of nothing like the
arch of a bridg thrown from bank to bank of a river inde at thi
point it line becam so attenu that in the glitter sunlight
otter wa doubt whether it wa not broken through for a distanc of
some yard
be of an inquir mind the dwarf decid to satisfi himself upon
the matter all around him lai slab of rock some of which were worn
perfectli smooth and to the thin of a tombston by centuri
of polish in the iron jaw of glacier select on of these of
conveni size otter approach the edg of the bridg push the
stone befor him over the frozen snow here the ic wa perfect except
for a slight hoarfrost that cover it for the action of the wind
prevent the snow from gather on the bridg and whenev the sun
wa strong enough to melt it surfac it froze again at night so that
no slide upon a parish pond could have been more slipperi or free from
inequ
otter gave hi stone a push and awai it went sometim swiftli and
sometim at a trifl speed accord to the natur of the angl down
which it pass leav a bright green ribbon upon the ic in it wake
whenc it swept the hoarfrost as it sped onc or twice he thought that
it wa go to stop but it never did stop at length it approach the
steepest and narrowest part of the descent down which the stone rush
with fear veloc
now i shall see whether the bridg is broken thought otter and just
then the rock travel like an arrow came to that portion of
the glacier where for a width difficult to estim it stretch
unsupport over space and measur onli some few feet across on it
flew then seem to leap into the air and onc more sped forward
till it reach the further slope of snow up which it travel for a
distanc and stop appear even to otter keen sight no larger
than a midg upon a tablecloth
now if a man had been seat on that stone he might have pass thi
bridg in safeti said otter to himself yet it is on that few would
care to travel unless sure death were behind them
then he determin on a second trial and select anoth and somewhat
lighter stone he sent it upon it journei it follow precis the
same cours as it predecessor but when it came to the knifeblad of
the bridg it vanish
i am sorri for that stone thought otter for doubtless it that ha
been whole for mani year is at thi moment onli littl piec
a third time he repeat hi experi choos the heaviest rock that
he could move thi messeng also leap into the air at the narrowest
portion of the bridg then pass on in safeti to the slope of snow
beyond
a strang place thought otter and i prai that it mai never be my
lot to ride on of those stone hors
then he turn down the mountain again for the afternoon wa advanc
when he reach the entranc to the riverb sunset wa at hand for a
while he sat watch the fade light and eat some more root which
he had gather now he crawl into the passag and commenc hi
darksom journei toward the home of the dead water dweller though what
he wa to do when he got there he did not know no accid befel him
and in due cours he arriv safe in the den hi journei be much
facilit by the staff he bore which enabl him to feel hi wai like
a blind man
creep to the edg of the pool he listen to it turmoil for the
shadow were gather so fast that with some ghostlik shape of foam
except he could not even see the surfac of the water
if i go in there how can i get out again otter thought sadli after
all perhap i should have done better to return while it wa still
light for then by the help of my staff and the rope i might have made
shift to climb the overhang ledg of rock but to try thi now were
mad i will go back and sit in the cave with the ghost of the god
and hi dead till the morn come again though i do not crave their
compani
so he retreat a few pace and sat in silenc near the tail of the dead
crocodil after a while loneli took hold of him he tri to sleep
and could not for it seem to otter that he saw ey stare at him
from the depth of the cave and heard dead men whisper to each other
tale of their dread end moment by moment hi fear grew upon
him for otter wa veri superstiti now he fanci that he could
distinguish the head of the reptil limn in fire and rest on the
edg of the rock as he had seen it that morn
doubtless he thought thi monster is a devil and ha come to life
again to be reveng upon me wow i like him better when he wa in
the flesh than now that he ha turn himself to fire then to comfort
himself he began to talk aloud sai
otter unlucki that you ar why did you not die at onc instead of
live on to be torment by ghost perhap your master the baa whom
alon you love is dead alreadi and wait for you to come to serv him
you ar veri tire sai now otter would it not be well if you took
that rope which is about your middl and hang yourself thu you too
would becom a ghost and be abl to do battl with them in their own
fashion and he groan loudli
then of a sudden he grew fear inde the short wool stood up upon
hi head hi teeth chatter and as he said afterward hi veri nose
seem to grow cold with terror for as he sat he heard or seem to
hear a voic speak to him from the air and that voic hi master
otter otter said the voic
he made no answer he wa too frighten
otter is that you whisper the voic again
then he spoke ye baa it is i i know that you ar dead and call
me give me on minut till i can undo my rope and i will kill myself
and come to you
thank you otter said the voic with a ghastli attempt at a laugh
but if it is all the same i would much rather that you came aliv
ye baa and i too would rather stop aliv but be aliv how can i
join you who ar dead
you fool i am not dead said leonard
then baa how is it that you speak out of the air come near to me
that i mai touch you and be comfort
i cannot otter i am bound and in a prison abov you there is a hole
in the floor and if you have a rope as i heard you sai perhap you
could climb up to me
now the dwarf began to understand rise he stretch the long staff
he had brought with him high abov hi head and found to hi delight
that he could touch the roof of the cave present the point of the
staff ceas to press upon the rock
is the place here baa said otter
it is here but you must throw the stick up like a spear through the
hole for i am ti and cannot put out my hand to take it
stai awhil baa first i must make the line fast to it
good but be swift for i am in danger
hurriedli otter undid the hide rope from about hi middl knot it
secur to the centr of the stick then some five feet below the stick
he made a loop larg enough for a man to place hi foot in and have
ascertain the exact situat of the open in the roof of the cave
he hurl the staff upward and jerk at the line
it is fix whisper leonard from abov now come up if you can
the dwarf requir no second invit seiz the rope as high as
he could reach abov hi head he began to drag himself up hand over
handno easi task for the hide cord wa thin and cut hi finger and
hi right leg round which he had twist it to get a better purchas
present howev he succeed in set hi foot in the loop he had
prepar when he found that hi head and shoulder were in the hole
and that by reach upward he could grasp the staff which lai across
it the rest wa easi and within half a minut he lai gasp at hi
master side
have you a knife otter
ye baa my small on the big on ar down there i will tell you
that stori by and by
never mind the stori now otter my hand ar ti behind my back feel
for the lash and cut them then give me the knife that i mai free my
leg
otter obei and present leonard rose and stretch himself with a
sigh of relief
where is the shepherdess baa
there in the next cell thei separ me from her and sinc then i
have been dangl by the leg over that hole bound and gag i think
in order to persuad her to consent to someth or other by the sight
of my danger for doubtless she wa place where she could see all then
thei left me and i manag to spit out the gag but i could not undo
the cord i expect that thei will soon be back again
then had we not better fly baa i have found a passag that lead to
the mountain
how can we fly and leav the shepherdess otter sinc i have been held
down the hole onli two men have visit me from time to time for thei
think me helpless let us seiz these men when thei come in and take
their knive for we ar unarm then we can think also we shall have
their kei
ye baa we mai do that you take the staff it is stout
and what will you us ask leonard
fear not baa do these men bear light
ye
then in two minut i will make me a weapon
and unti the hide rope from the stick he began to fumbl with it
busili
now i am readi baa he said present where shall we stand
here answer leonard lead him to the door we will crouch in
the shadow on on either side of thi door and when the priest have
enter and close it and begin to look round for me then we can
spring upon them onli otter there must be no bungl and no nois
i think that there will be none baa thei will be too frighten to
cry at first and after that thei will becom dumb
otter whisper leonard as thei stood in the dark did you kill the
waterdwel
ye ye baa he chuckl in answer i caught him with the hook
that i made readi but he did not die easili baa and if i had not
been abl to swim well he would have drown me
i heard someth of it from nam said leonard you ar a wonder
fellow otter
oh baa it wa no valour of mine when i saw hi ey i wa horribl
afraid onli i thought how gladli you would have attack him had you
been there and what a coward you would hold me could you have seen
me shiver like a littl girl befor a big lizard and these thought
gave me courag
oh that is all veri well repli leonard and suddenli ad hush
be readi
as he spoke the door open and two great priest came through it on
of them bear a candl he who bore the light turn to shut the door
for he suspect noth then at on and the same instant leonard
emerg from the shadow dealt the first priest a blow upon the head
with hi staff which stun if it did not kill him for he fell
like an ox beneath the poleax while otter stand where he wa
dexter cast hi hide rope about the throat of the second man and
drew the noos tight with a jerk that brought him to the earth
in twenti second it wa all over the men who were the same that had
held leonard suspend in the oubliett lai senseless or dead and
the dwarf and hi master were engag in possess themselv of their
knive and kei by the light of the candl which though it had fallen
to the ground fortun remain burn
that wa well done otter said leonard and i am not asham to have
done it for these devil kick me when i wa bound now we ar arm
and have the kei what next
just then otter sprang to hi feet cry look out baa here ar
more
leonard glanc up to see and behold the second door in the cell wa
open and through it came juanna olfan nam soa and three other
men
for a moment there wa silenc till on of the captain cri out
see jal the god ha come back and alreadi he claim hi victim and
he point to the two priest
then follow a scene of confus for even olfan and nam were amaz
at what seem to them littl short of a miracl while leonard and
juanna had ey for each other onli and the three captain stare at
otter like men who think thei see a ghost
but on person in that compani kept her head and that person wa soa
the captain who guard her had loos hi hold silent she slunk back
into the shadow and unseen of ani vanish through the doorwai by
which she had been led in a minut pass and otter think that he
heard a nois without that door of the cell wherebi the two priest had
enter which had been left ajar went to it and tri to open it just
then also olfan miss soa
where is the woman nam daughter he cri
it seem that she ha escap and shut us in king answer otter
calmli

prison it wa true both were close
it matter noth here ar the kei said leonard
thei will not avail us deliver answer olfan for these door

woman ha gone to rous the colleg of the priest who will present

chapter xxxvii
i am repaid queen
their posit wa terribl soa had escap and soa knew everyth
moreov she wa mad with hatr and long for reveng on leonard
otter and in a less degre on olfan the king had thei succeed in
reveal themselv to the peopl all might have gone well for otter
and juanna would certainli have been accept as true god who had
pass and repass the gate of death scatheless but now the affair
wa differ soa would tell the truth to the priest who even if
thei were inclin to desert her father in hi extrem must strike
for their own sake and for that of their order which wa the most
power among the peopl of the mist and had no desir to be place
under the yoke of secular author
it wa clear to all of them that if thei could not escap thei
must fall veri shortli into the hand of the priest who know
everyth would not dare to allow them to appeal to the armi or to
the superstit of the outsid public the onli good card thei held wa
the possess of the person of nam though it remain to be seen how
far thi would help them
to begin with there ar alwai some readi to step into the shoe of a
high priest also nam had blunder so extens in the matter of
the fals god that the greater part of the fratern whom he had
involv in hi mistak would not sorrow to see the last of him
these fact which were perfectli well known to olfan and guess at by
hi companion sharpen their sens of the danger in which thei had
been place by soa resourc and cun inde their escap wa
a matter of life and death to them and to mani hundr of their
adher if onc thei could reach the templ and proclaim the
rearisen god to the peopl all would go well for the armi would
suffic to keep the priest from us violenc but if thei fail in
thi their deathwarr wa alreadi sign for none of them would
ever be heard of again
no wonder then that thei hurl themselv despairingli upon the
stubborn door for an hour or more thei labour but all in vain the
massiv timber of hard wood six inch or more in thick could
scarc be touch by their knive and spear nor might their unit
strength serv even to stir the stone bolt and bar that held them
fast and thei had noth that could be us as a batteringram
it is useless said leonard at last throw down hi knife in
despair thi wood is like iron it would take us a week to cut through
it
why not try fire baa suggest otter
accordingli thei attempt to burn down the door with the result
that thei nearli stifl themselv in the smoke and made but littl
impress upon the woodwork
at length thei gave up the experimentit wa a failureand sat look
blankli at each other as thei listen to certain sound which reach
them from the passag without tell them that their enemi were
gather there
ha anyon a suggest to make said leonard at last if not i
think that thi game is about plai
baa answer otter i have a word to sai we can all go down
through that hole by which i came up to you the waterdwel is dead
i slew him with my own hand so there is noth to fear from him
beneath the hole run a tunnel and that tunnel lead to the slope of
the mountain abov at the top of thi slope is an icebridg by which
men mai reach a fair countri if thei have a mind to
then for heaven sake let us cross it put in juanna
i have seen that bridg said olfan while the captain stare
wonderingli at the man whose might had prevail against the ancient
snake but never yet have i heard of the travel who dare to set hi
foot upon it
it is danger but it can be cross repli otter at the
least it is better to try it than to stai here to be murder by the
medicinemen
i think that we will go leonard said juanna if i am to die i wish
to do so in the open air onli what is to becom of nam and perhap
olfan and the captain would prefer to stop here
nam will go with us wherev we go answer leonard grimli we
have a long score to settl with that gentleman as for olfan and hi
captain thei must pleas themselv
what will do you olfan ask juanna speak to him for the first
time sinc the scene in the other prison
it seem queen he answer with downcast ey that i have sworn
to defend you to the last and thi i will do the more readili becaus
now my life is of littl valu as for my brethren here i think like
you that thei will choos to die in the open rather than wait to be
murder by the priest
the three captain nod an assent to hi word then thei all set to
work
first thei took food and drink of which there wa an ampl suppli in
the other cell and hurriedli swallow some of it dispos the rest
about their person as best thei could for thei foresaw that even if
thei succeed in escap it wa like that thei would go hungri for
mani dai then leonard wrap juanna in a goatskin cloak which he
took from on of the fallen priest place the second cloak over
hi own shoulder for he knew that it would be bitterli cold on the
mountain lastli thei ti nam arm behind him and depriv him of
hi knife so that the old man might work none of them a sudden injuri
in hi rage
all be prepar otter made hi rope fast to the staff and descend
rapidli to the cave below as hi feet touch the ground the priest
began to batter upon the door of the cell with beam of wood or some
such heavi instrument
quick juanna said leonard sit in thi noos and hold the line we
will let you down hurri those door cannot stand for long
anoth minut and she wa besid otter who stood beneath a candl in
hi hand then leonard came down
by the wai otter he said have you seen anyth of the jewel that

dwarf carelessli but i did not troubl to look into it what is the
us of the red stone to us now

ye baa if we get awai answer otter bethink himself of the
icebridg well we can pick it up as we go along
just then nam arriv have been let down by olfan and the captain
and stood glare round him not without aw for neither he nor ani of
hi brethren had ever dare to visit the sacr home of the snakegod
then the captain descend and last of all came olfan
we have littl time to spare deliver said the king the door is
fall and as he spoke thei heard a great crash abov otter jerk
furious at the rope till by good luck on end of the stake slid over
the edg of the hole and it fell among them
no need to leav thi line for them to follow by he said besid
it mai be us at that moment someth appear look through
the hole it wa the head of on of the pursu priest nam saw it and
took hi opportun
the fals god escap by the tunnel to the mountain he scream
and with them the fals king follow and fear not the waterdwel is
dead think not of me nam but slai them
with an exclam otter struck him heavili across the mouth knock
him backward but the mischief wa done for a voic cri in answer
we hear you father and will find rope and follow
then thei start on moment thei paus to look at the huge bulk of
the dead crocodil
thi dwarf is a god in truth cri on of the captain for no man
could have wrought such a deed
forward said leonard we have no time to lose
now thei were by the crocodil bed and among the broken bone of hi
victim
the bag otter where is the bag ask leonard
here baa answer the dwarf drag it from the moulder
skeleton of the unlucki priest who have offend the newfound god
had been let down through the hole to lai it in it hidingplac and to
perish in the jaw of the waterdwel
leonard took the bag and open it mouth which wa drawn tight with
a run strip of hide he peep into it while otter held down the
candl that he might see from it depth came a glimmer of red and blue
light that glow like the heart of some dull fire
it is the treasur he said in a low tone of exult at last the
luck ha turn
how much doe it weigh said juanna as thei sped onward
some seven or eight pound i should sai he answer still
exultantli seven or eight solid pound of gem the finest in the
world
then give it to me she said i have noth els to carri you mai
have to us both your hand present
true he answer and pass the string of the bag over her head
now thei went on up the smooth slope bed of the stream suffer
littl inconveni except from the cold of the water that flow
about their ankl
the stream ha risen a littl baa sinc i pass it thi morn
said otter doubtless thi dai sun ha melt some snow at it
sourc tomorrow we might not have been abl to travel thi road
veri like answer leonard i told you that our luck had turn at
last
twenti minut more and thei reach the mouth of the tunnel and
pass between the block of ic found themselv upon the mountain
side but as it chanc the face of the moon wa hidden by cloud
which is often the case in thi countri at the begin of the spring
season for wherea in winter the dai ar almost invari misti and
the night clear in spring and summer these atmospher condit ar
frequent revers so dark wa it inde that it prove imposs to
attempt the ascent of the mountain until the dai broke sinc to do
so would be to run the risk of lose themselv and veri possibl of
break their neck among it numer cleft and precipic
after a minut hasti discuss thei set to work to fill up the mouth
of the tunnel or rather the crack between the block of ic that
alreadi encumb it with such materi as lai to hand name lump
of frozen snow gravel and a few larg stone which thei were fortun
enough to find in the immedi vicin for the dark render
it imposs to search for these at a distanc while thei were thu
engag thei heard the voic of priest speak on the further side
of their somewhat ineffici barrier and work harder than ever
think that the moment of attack had come
to their astonish howev the sound of talk di awai
now where have thei gone said leonardto climb the cliff by anoth
path and cut us off
i think not deliver answer olfan for i know of no such path
i think that thei have gone to bring heavi beam by mean of which thei
will batter down the ic wall
still there is such a path king said on of the captain for
i myself have often climb it when i wa young search for
snowflow to bring to her whom i court in those dai
can you find it now friend ask olfan eagerli
i do not forget a road that i have trod said the captain but it is
on not easi to follow
see now shepherdess said olfan after think awhil shall we take
thi man for a guid and return down the cliff to the citi for there
unless fate is against us we mai find friend among the soldier and
fight out thi battl with the priest
no no answer juanna almost passion i would rather die than
go back to that dread place to be murder at last do you go if you
will olfan and leav us to take our chanc
that i cannot do queen for i am sworn to a certain servic he said
proudli but hearken my friend follow thi path of which you speak
if you can do so in the dark and find help then return swiftli to
thi spot where i and your two comrad will hold the priest at bai
perchanc you will not find us live but thi i charg you if we ar
dead give it out that the god have left the land becaus thei were so
evilli dealt with and rous up the peopl to fall upon the priest
and make an end of them onc and for ever for thu onli shall thei win
peac and safeti
make no repli the man shook olfan and the other two captain by the
hand salut juanna and vanish into the dark then thei all sat
down in front of the mouth of the tunnel to wait and watch and veri
glad were thei of the goatskin cloak which had belong to the
priest for as the night drew toward the dawn the cold becam so
bitter that thei could scarc bear it but were oblig to rise and
stamp to and fro to keep their wet feet from freez
leonard said juanna you do not know what pass after nam trap
you and she told him all the tale
when she had finish he rose and take olfan by the hand said
king i thank you mai fortun deal as well with you as you have dealt
by me and mine
sai no more deliver answer olfan hastili i have but done my
duti and fulfil my oath though at time the path of duti is hard for
a man to follow and he look toward juanna and sigh
leonard sat down and wa silent but mani a time both then and in
afterdai did he wonder at the nobl of mind of thi savag king
which enabl him under circumst so cruel to conquer hi own
passion and show himself will to lai down life and throne togeth
that he might carri out hi vow to protect the woman who had brought him
so much pain and now left him for ever with hi success rival
at length look at the mountain peak abov them thei saw it snow
begin to blush red with the come of the dawn and just then also thei
heard mani voic talk within the tunnel and caught glimps of
light flash through the open in their rude fortif the
priest who no doubt had been delai by the procur of the timber
which were to serv as batteringram and the labour necessari to drag
them up the steep inclin of the tunnel had return and in forc a
few more minut and a success of dull thud on the further side of
the ic wall told the littl band of defend that their enemi were
at work
the light grow quickli deliver said olfan quietli i think that
now you mai begin to ascend the mountain and take no harm
what shall we do with thi man ask leonard point to nam
kill him said otter
no not yet awhil answer olfan take thi and he hand leonard
the spear of the third captain who had left it when he start down the
mountain fear that it might encumb him and drive him along with
you at it point should we be overpow you mai bui your live as
the price of hi but should we hold them back and you escap then do
with him what you will
i know well what i would do mutter otter glower at the priest
and now farewel went on olfan in the same calm voic bring more
ic comrad or stone if you can see ani the wall crack
leonard and otter wrung the king hand in silenc but juanna could
not leav him thu for her heart wa melt at the thought of all hi
good
forgiv me she murmur that i have brought you grief and as i
fear death to follow grief
the grief you could not help queen and be sure i shall welcom death
if he should choos me go now and happi go with you mai you
escap in safeti with the bright pebbl which you desir mai you and
your husband the deliver be bless for mani year in each other
love and when you grow old togeth from time to time think kindli of
that wild man who worship you while you were young and laid down hi
life to save you
juanna listen and tear sprang to her ey then of a sudden she
seiz the great man hand and kiss it
i am repaid queen he said and perchanc your husband will not be
jealou now go and swiftli
as he spoke a small portion of the wall fell outward and the fierc
face of a priest appear at the open with a shout olfan lift hi
broad spear and thrust the priest fell backward and just then the
captain arriv with stone and stop the hole
then the three turn and fled up the mountain side otter drive nam
befor him with blow and curs till at length the old man fell and
lai on hi face groan nor could the dwarf blow which were not of
the softest forc him to rise
get up you treacher dog said leonard threaten him with the
spear
then you must loos my arm deliver answer the priest i am
veri weak and i cannot travel up thi mountain with my hand bound
behind me sure you have noth to fear from on ag and unarm
man
not much at present i suppos mutter leonard though we have had
enough to fear from you in the past and take hi knife he cut loos
the lash
while he did so juanna turn and look behind her far below them
she could see the form of olfan and hi companion stand shoulder
to shoulder and even catch the gleam of light reflect from their
spear for now the sun wa rise beneath them again she saw the
grassgrown roof of that earthli hell the citi of the peopl of the
mist and the endless plain beyond through which the river wander like
a silver serpent there also wa the further portion of the huge wall of
the templ built by unknown hand in forgotten year and rise
abov the edg of that gap in the cliff through which she wa look
appear a black mass which she knew to be the head and shoulder of the
hideou colossu on whose dizzi brow she had sat in that strang hour
when the shout thousand thunder a welcom to her as their goddess
and whenc her most belov friend francisco had been hurl to hi
cruel death
oh what i have suffer in that place she thought to herself how
have i live through it i wonder and yet i have won someth and
she glanc at leonard who wa drive nam toward her and if onli
we surviv and i am the mean of enabl him to fulfil hi vow and
bui back hi home with these jewel i shall not regret all that i have
endur to win them ye even when he is no longer so veri much in
love he must alwai be grate to me for few women will have done as
much for their husband
then nam stagger past her hiss curs while the untir otter
rain blow upon hi back and lose sight of olfan and hi companion
thei went on in safeti till thei reach the neck and saw the
icebridg glitter befor them and the wide field of snow beyond
chapter xxxviii
the triumph of nam
which wai ar we to go now said juanna must we climb down thi
great gulf
no shepherdess answer otter see befor you is a bridg and he
point to the band of ic and rock which travers the wide ravin
a bridg gasp juanna why it is as slipperi as a slide and steep
as the side of a hous a fly could not keep it foot on it
look here otter put in leonard either you ar joke or you ar
mad how can we cross that place we should be dash to piec befor
we had gone ten yard
thu baa we must sit each of us on on of the flat stone that lie
round here then the stone will take us across of itself i know for i
have tri it
do you mean to tell me that you have been over there on a rock
no baa but i have sent three stone over two cross safe i
watch them go the whole wai and on vanish in the middl i think
that there is a hole there but we must risk that if the stone is heavi
enough it will jump it if not then we shall go down the hole and be no
more troubl
great heaven said leonard wipe hi forehead with the back of hi
hand thi is practic toboggan with a vengeanc is there no other
wai
i can see none baa except for the bird and i think that we had
better stop talk and make readi for the priest ar still behind us
if you will watch on the neck here so that we ar not surpris i will
seek stone to carri us
how about thi man said leonard point to nam who lai face
downward on the snow appar in a dead faint
oh we must keep him a while baa he mai be us if those priest
come if not i will talk with him befor we start he is asleep and
cannot run awai
then leonard went to the top of the neck which wa distant some twenti
yard and otter began to search for stone suitabl to hi purpos
as for juanna she turn her back to the icebridg at which she
scarc dare to look and sat herself upon a rock in do so the
jewel in the bag struck against her knee and jingl and the thought
came into her mind that she would examin them while she wait partli
becaus she desir to distract her thought from the vision of thi new
and terribl ordeal which lai befor her and partli to gratifi a not
unnatur curios
open the mouth of the bag she thrust her finger into it and on by
on drew out the biggest gem which were jumbl togeth there place
them on the rock besid her in less than a minut she wa feast
her ey upon such a collect of priceless jewel as had never befor
gladden the sight of ani white woman even in her wildest dream
inde till now juanna had not thought it possibl that stone so
splendid could exist on the hither side of the wall of heaven
first there were great sapphir roughli squar and two enorm
round star rubi these had form the ey of the colossu which were
remov on the morrow of their arriv the star rubi repres the
bloodr pupil then there wa a heartshap rubi of perfect colour
and without flaw almost as larg as a jackdaw egg which on the dai
of sacrific had adorn the breast of the chief priest of the peopl
of the mist for mani gener next came the greatest wonder of
thi treasur two marvel stone on a sapphir and on a rubi
fashion respect into model of the statu of the dwarf and of the
hideou shape of the waterdwel then there were othersdozen
of themsom rude cut and polish and some as thei came from the
earth but everi on of them singl out for it remark size and
flawless or it perfect fire and beauti
juanna arrang them in row and stare at them with ecstasywher is
the woman who would not have done sotil in contempl them she
even forgot the present terror of her positionforgot everyth
except the gorgeou loveli and infinit valu of the wealth of gem
which she had been the mean of win for leonard
among other thing that pass from her mind at thi moment wa the
presenc of nam who overcom by rage and exhaust lai in a seem
faint upon the snow within twelv pace of her she never saw him lift
hi head and look at her with an express as cold and cruel as that
which otter had seen in the ey of the waterdwel when he lift
hi head from it bed of rock she never saw him roll slowli over and
over across the snow toward her paus a while between each turn of
hi bodi for now she wa occupi in replac the jewel on by on
into their bag of leather
at last all were in and with a sighfor it wa sad to lose sight
of object so beautifuljuanna drew the mouth of the bag tight and
prepar to place it round her neck
at thi moment it wa that a hand wither and lean with ag pass
beneath her ey and swiftli as the snatch of an eagl talon seiz
the bag and rent it from her grasp she sprang up with a cry of dismai
and well might she be dismai for there run from her with
incred speed wa nam the jewel in hi hand
otter and leonard heard her cry and think that the priest wa
escap sped to cut him off but he had no idea of escap at least
not of such escap as thei expect some forti yard from where juanna
had been sit a littl promontori of rock jut out over the
unclimb gulf below them and toward thi spot nam direct hi
step run along the ridg he halt at it end inde he must do
unless he would fall a thousand feet or more to the bottom of the ravin
beneath then he turn and face hi pursuer who by now had reach
the edg of the cliff
come on step nearer he cri and i let thi bag fall whenc you
shall never recov it for no foot can tread these wall of rock and
there is water at the bottom of the gulf
leonard and otter stop trembl for the fate of the jewel
listen deliver cri nam you came to thi land to seek these
trinket is it not so and now you have found them and would be gone
with them but befor you go you wish to kill me for vengeanc sake
becaus i have shown you to be cheat and have sought to offer you up
to those god whom you have blasphem but the red stone you desir
ar in my hand and if i unclasp my finger thei will be lost to you
and all the world for ever sai now if i bring them back to you in
safeti will you swear to give me my life and suffer me to go my wai in
peac
ye we will swear it answer leonard who could not conceal the
anguish of hi anxieti come back nam and you shall depart unharm
but if you let the stone fall then you shall follow them
you swear it said the priest contemptu you ar come to thi
that you will sacrific your reveng to satisfi your greed o white man
with a nobl heart now i will outdo you for i who am not nobl will
sacrific my life to disappoint you of your desir what shall the
ancient holi treasur of the peopl of the mist be stolen by two white
thiev and their black hound never i would have kill you all had
time been grant to me but in that i fail and i am glad that i have
fail for now i will deal you a bitter blow than ani death mai the
curs of jal and aca cleav to you you dog without a kennel mai you
live outcast and die in the dirt and mai your father and your mother
and your children spit upon your bone as i do farewel
and shake hi disengag hand at them he spat toward them then with
a sudden motion nam hurl himself backward off the point of rock and
vanish into space bear the treasur with him
for a while the three stood aghast and stare at each other and the
point of rock which had been occupi by the vener form of the late
high priest then juanna sank upon the snow sob
it is my fault she wail all my fault just now i wa boast to
myself that i had won wealth for you and i have lost everyth and we
have suffer for noth and leonard you ar a beggar oh it is too
muchtoo much
go out there otter said leonard in a hoars voic point to the
place where nam had hurl himself and see whether there is ani chanc
of our be abl to climb down into the gulf
the dwarf obei and present return shake hi head
it is imposs baa he said the wall of rock ar sheer as
though thei had been cut with a knife moreov there is water at the
bottom of them as the old wizard said for i can hear the sound of it
oh baa baa why did you not kill him at first or let me kill him
afterward sure i told you that he would bring evil on us well thei
ar gone and we can never find them again so let us save our live if
we mai for after all these ar more to us than bright stone come now
and help me baa for i have found two flat rock that will serv our
turn a big on for you and the shepherdess sinc doubtless she will
fear to make thi journei alon and a smaller on for myself
leonard follow him without a word he wa too heartbroken to speak
while juanna rose and return to the spot where nam had rob her
look up present her ey still blur with tear she saw leonard
and the dwarf labori push two heavi stone across the snow
toward her
come do not cry juanna said leonard ceas from hi labour and
lai hi hand kindli upon her shoulder thei ar gone and there is an
end of it now we must think of other thing
oh she answer if onli you had seen them you would never stop
cry all your life
then i dare sai that the fit will be a short on repli leonard
grimli glanc at the aw bridg which stretch between them and
safeti
listen juanna you and i must lie upon thi stone and it willso
sai ottercarri us across to the other side of the ravin
i cannot i cannot she gasp i shall faint and fall off i am sure
that i shall
but you must juanna answer leonard at least you must choos
between thi and return to the citi of the mist
i will come she said i know that i shall be kill but it is
better than go back to those horribl priest and besid it doe
not matter now that i have lost the jewel
jewel ar not everyth juanna
listen shepherdess put in otter the thing is easi though it look
difficult all that you have to do is to shut your ey and lie still
then the stone will carri you over i am not afraid i will go first
to show you the wai and where a black dwarf can pass there you white
peopl who ar so much braver can follow but befor i start i will
tie you and the deliver togeth with my cord for so you will feel
safer
then otter drag both stone to the veri verg of the inclin and
have pass the rope about the waist of juanna and leonard he
prepar himself for the journei
now deliver he said when i am safe across all that you must do
it to lie flat upon the stone both of you and to push a littl with
the spear then befor you know it you will be by my side
all right said leonard doubtfulli well i suppos that you had
better start wait wont make the matter ani easier
ye baa i will go now ah littl did i think that i should ever be
forc to take such a ride as thi well it will be someth to make
song about afterward
and otter laid himself face downward on the stone with a littl laugh
though leonard notic that howev brave hi spirit might be he
could not prevent hi flesh from reveal it natur weak for it
quiver pitifulli
now baa he said grip the edg of the stone with hi larg
hand when i give the word do you push gentli and then you will see
how a black bird can fly put your head lower baa
leonard obei and the dwarf whisper in hi ear
i onli want to sai baa in case we should not meet again for
accid will happen even on the safest road that i am sorri that i
made such a pig of myself yonder it wa so dull down there in that hole
of a palac and the fog made me see all thing wrong moreov drink
and a wife have corrupt mani a better man dont answer baa but
start me for i am grow afraid
place hi hand at the back of the stone leonard gave it a slight
push it began to move veri slowli at first then more fast and faster
yet till it wa rush over the smooth ic pathwai with a whir
sound like that produc by the flight of a bird present it had
reach the bottom of the first long slope and wa climb the gentl
rise opposit but so slowli that for a while leonard thought that it
wa go to stop it cross it brow howev and vanish for a few
second into a dip where the watcher could not see it then it appear
again at the head of the second and longest slope of which the angl
wa veri steep down thi the stone rush like an arrow from a bow
till it reach the narrow waist of the bridg whereof the gener
conform bore some resembl to that of a dead wasp ly on it
back inde from where leonard and juanna stood the span of ic at
thi point seem to be no thicker than a silver thread while otter and
the stone might have been a fly upon the thread now of a sudden leonard
distinctli saw the rock sledg and it live burden which just then
wa travel it swiftest move upward as though it had leap
into the air and then continu it cours along the rise place which
repres the throat of the wasp till at length it stop
leonard look at hi watch the time occupi by the transit wa just
fifti second and the distanc could not have been much less than half
a mile
see he cri to juanna who all thi while had sat with her hand
befor her ey to shut out the vision of the dwarf dread progress
he ha cross safe and he point to a figur that appear to be
danc with glee upon the breast of the snow slope
as he spoke a faint sound reach their ear for in those immens
silenc sound can travel far it wa otter shout and hi word
seem to be come on baa it is easi
i am glad he is safe said juanna faintli but now we must follow
him take my handkerchief leonard and tie it over my ey pleas for
i cannot bear to look the idol head wa noth to thi
leonard obei her bid her not to be afraid
oh but i am terribl afraid she said i never wa so much
frighten in all my life and ii have lost the jewel leonard do
forgiv me for behav so badli to you i know that i have behav
badli in mani wai though i have been too proud to admit it befor but
now when i am go to die i want to beg your pardon i hope you will
think kindli of me leonard when i am dead for i do love you with
all my heart inde i do and tear began to roll down beneath the
bandag
dearest he answer kiss her tenderli as we ar ti togeth
it seem that if you die i must die too do not break down now after you
have born so much
it is the jewel she sob the jewel i feel as though i had
commit a murder
oh bother the jewel said leonard we can think about them
afterward and he advanc toward the flat stone juanna feel the
while as though thei were two of carrier victim about to know the
marriag of the loir
as thei came to the stone leonard heard a sound behind him a sound of
footstep muffl by the snow and glanc round he saw soa rush
toward them almost nake a spearwound in her side and the light of
mad shine in her ey
get back he said sternli or and he lift the great spear
oh shepherdess she wail take me with you shepherdess for i
cannot live without you
tell her to go awai said juanna recognis the voic i never want
to see her ani more
you hear soa answer leonard stai how ha it gone yonder speak
truli
i know not deliver when i left olfan and hi brother still held
the mouth of the tunnel and were unhurt but the captain wa dead i
slip past them and got thi as i went and she point to the gash
in her side
if he can hold out a littl longer help mai reach him mutter
leonard then without more word he laid himself and juanna face
downward on the broad stone
now juanna he said we ar go to start grip fast with your
right hand and see that you do not leav go of the edg of the stone
or we shall both slip off it
oh take me with you shepherdess take me with you and i will be
wick no more but serv you as of old shrill the voic of soa in
so despair a cry that the rock rang
hold fast said leonard through hi set teeth as disengag hi
right hand from about juanna waist he seiz the handl of the spear
and press it broad blade against a knob of rock behind them now the
stone that wa balanc on the veri verg of the decliv trembl
beneath them and now slowli and majest as a vessel start from
her slip when the launch cord is sever it began to move down the
ici wai
for the first second it scarc seem to stir then the motion grew
palpabl and at that instant leonard heard a nois behind him and felt
hi left foot clasp by a human hand there wa a jerk that nearli
drag them off their sledg but he held fast to the front edg of
the stone and though he could still feel the hand upon hi ankl the
strain becam almost impercept
chapter xxxix
the pass of the bridg
lift hi head veri cautious leonard look over hi shoulder and
the mysteri wa explain in her mad and the furi of her love for
the mistress whom she had outrag and betrai soa had striven to
throw herself upon the stone with them so soon as she saw it commenc
to move she wa too late and feel herself slip forward she
grasp despairingli at the first thing that came to her hand which
chanc to be leonard ankl now she must accompani them upon their
awesom journei onli while thei rode upon the stone she wa drag
after them upon her breast
a flash of piti pass through leonard brain as he realis her
fear plight then for a while he forgot all about her sinc hi
attent wa ampli occupi with hi own and juanna peril now thei
were rush down the long slope with an everincreas veloc and
now thei breast the first rise dure the last ten yard of which
as in the case of otter the pace of the stone slow down so much in
proport to the progress exhaust of it momentum that leonard
thought thei were come to a standstil then it wa that he kick
out vicious strive to free himself from the weight of soa which
threaten to bring them to a common ruin but she clung to him like
ivi to a tree and he desist from hi effort fear lest he should
caus their sledg to alter it cours
on the veri top of the rise the motion of the stone decreas almost to
nothing then littl by littl increas onc more as thei travers
a short sharp dip the same in which thei had lost sight of otter to
be succeed by a gentl rise so far though excit and novel their
journei had been compar safe for the path wa broad and the ic
perfectli smooth it terror were to come
look forward leonard saw that thei were at the commenc of a
declin measur four or five hundr yard in length and so steep
that even had it offer a good foothold human be could scarc
have stood upon it as yet the tongu of ic wa fifti pace or more
in width but it narrow rapidli as it fell till at length near the
opposit shore of the ravin it fine awai to a point like that of a
great white needl and then seem to break off altogeth
now thei were well under wai and now thei sped down the steep green ic
at a pace that can hardli be imagin though perhap it is sometim
equal by an eagl rush on it quarri from some vast height of
air inde it is possibl that the sensat of an eagl make hi
headlong descent and those of leonard mai have been veri similar with
the import except that the bird feel no fear wherea absolut
terror ar the onli word wherewith to describ the mental state of the
man so smooth wa the ic and so precipit it pitch that he felt
as though he were fall through space unsupport by anyth for
travel at that speed the friction of the stone wa impercept
onli the air shriek as thei clove it and juanna long tress torn
by it from their fasten stream out behind her like a veil
down thei went still down halftwothird of the distanc wa done
then he look again and saw the horror that lai befor them alreadi
the bridg wa narrow bare the width of a small room sixti yard
further on it taper to so fine a point that their stone would almost
cover it breadth and beneath it on either side yawn that unmeasur
gulf wherein nam wa lost with the jewel nor wa thi all for at it
narrowest the ic band wa broken awai for a space of ten or twelv
feet to continu on the further side of the gap for a few yard at
a somewhat lower level and then run upward at a steep inclin to the
breast of snow where otter sat in safeti
on thei whizz ic beneath them and befor them and ic in leonard
heart for he wa frozen with fear hi breath had left him becaus of
the rush of their progress but hi sens remain painfulli acut
involuntarili he glanc over the edg of the stone saw the sheer
depth below him and found himself wonder what wa the law that kept
their sledg upon thi ribbon of ic when it seem so easi for it to
whirl off into space
now the gap wa immedi in front of them god help us he
murmur or rather thought for there wa no time for word and thei
had left the road of ic and were fly through the air as though the
stone which carri them were a live thing that see the peril
had gather up it energi and sprung forward for it life
what happen leonard never knew for certain and otter swore that hi
heart leap from hi bosom and stood in front of hi ey so that he
could not see befor thei touch the further point of icewhil
thei were in the air indeedthei or rather leonard heard a hideou
scream and felt a jerk so violent that hi hold of the stone wa
loosen and it pass from beneath them then came a shock less heavi
than might have been expect and lo thei were spin onward down
the polish surfac of the ic while the stone which had born them so
far sped on in front like a hors that ha thrown it rider
leonard felt the rub of the ic burn him like hot iron he felt also
that hi ankl wa freed from the hand that had held it then for some
minut he knew no more for hi sens left him when thei return it
wa to hear the voic of otter cry lie still lie still baa do
not stir for your life i come
instantli he wa wide awak and move hi head ever so littl saw
their situat then he wish that he had remain asleep for it wa
thi
the impetu of their rush had carri them almost to the line where the
ic stop and the rock and snow began within some fifteen feet of it
inde but those fifteen feet were of the smoothest ic and veri sheer
so smooth and sheer that no man could hope to climb them below them the
slope continu for about thirteen or fourteen yard till it met the
correspond inclin that led to the gap in the bridg
on thi surfac of ic thei were ly spreadeagl for a moment
leonard wonder how it wa that thei did not slide back to the bottom
of the slope there to remain till thei perish for without rope
and proper implement no human be could scale it then he saw that a
chanc had befallen them which in afterdai he wa wont to attribut
to the direct intervent of provid
it will be rememb that when thei start leonard had push the
rock off with a spear which olfan had given them thi spear he drew in
again as thei began to move place it between hi chest and the stone
for he thought that it might be of servic to him should thei succe
in cross the gulf when thei were jerk from the sledg and left to
slide along the ic on the further side of the gap in obedi to
the impetu given to them by the fright speed at which thei were
travel the spear obei the same law of motion accompani
them but be of a less specif graviti lag behind in the race
just as the stone which wa heaviest outstrip them
as it happen near the top of the rise there wa a fissur in the
ic and in thi fissur the weapon had becom fix it weight blade
caus it to assum an upright posit when the senseless bodi of
leonard and juanna had slid as far up the slope as the unexpend energi
of their impetu would allow natur enough thei began to move back
again in accord with the law of graviti then it wa as luck would
have it that the spear fix in the crevic of the ic save them
from destruct for it chanc that the descent of their two form
pass on either side of it wa check by the handl of the weapon
which caught the hide rope wherebi thei were bound togeth
all of thi leonard took in by degre also he discov that juanna
wa either dead or senseless at the time he could not tell which
what ar you go to do he ask of otter who by now wa on the
verg of the ic fifteen feet abov them
cut step and pull you up baa answer the dwarf cheerfulli
it will not be easi said leonard glanc over hi shoulder at the
long slope beneath and if we slip or the rope break
do not talk of slip baa repli otter as he began to hack at
the ic with the priest heavi knife and as for the rope if it wa
strong enough for the waterdwel to drag me round the pool by it is
strong enough to hold you two although it ha seen some wear i onli
wish i had such anoth for then thi matter would be simpl
work furious otter hack at the hard surfac of the ic the
first two step he hollow from the top of the slope ly on hi
stomach after thi difficulti present themselv which seem
insuper for he could not chip at the ic when he had noth by
which to support himself
what is to be done now said leonard
keep cool baa and give me time to think and for a moment otter
squat down and wa silent
i have it he said present and rise he took off hi goatskin
cloak and cut it into strip each strip measur about two inch in
width by two feet six inch in length these strip he knot togeth
firmli make a servic rope of them long enough to reach to where
leonard and juanna were suspend on the stout handl of the spear
then he took the stake which had alreadi done him such good servic
and sharpen it point fix it as deepli as he could into the snow
and earth on the border of the ic belt and ti the skin rope to it
now baa he said all is well for i can begin from the bottom
and without further word he let himself down till he hung besid
them
is the shepherdess dead baa he ask glanc at juanna pale
face and close ey or doe she onli sleep
i think that she is in a swoon answer leonard but for heaven
sake be quick otter for i am be frozen on thi ic what is your
plan now
thi baa to tie about your middl the end of the rope that i have
made from the cloak then to undo the cord that bind you and the
shepherdess togeth and return to the top of the slope onc there i
can pull her up by the hide line for it is strong and she will slip
easili over the ic and you can follow
good said leonard
then hang by on hand the dwarf manag with such assist as
leonard could give him to knot beneath leonard arm the end of the
rope which he had construct from the skin garment next he set to work
to unti the hide cord therebi free him from juanna and now
came the most difficult and danger part of the task for leonard
suspend from the shaft of the spear by on hand must support juanna
senseless form with the other while otter made shift to drag himself
to the summit of the ic hold the hide line in hi teeth the spear
bent dreadfulli and leonard did not dare to put ani extra strain upon
the roughli fasten cord of goatskin by which the dwarf wa haul
himself up the ic for if it gave thei must all be precipit to the
dip below there to perish miser faint and frozen as he wa it
seem hour to him befor otter reach the top and call to him to
get go of juanna
leonard obei and seat himself on the snow hi feet support by
the edg of the ic the dwarf put out hi strength and began to pull
her up strong as he wa it prove as much as he wa abl to do
inde had juanna lain on ani other materi than ic he could not
have done it at all but in the end he succeed and with a gasp of
gratitud leonard saw her stretch safe upon the snow
now otter hastili undo the cord from juanna waist made it into
a run noos which he threw down to leonard who place it over hi
shoulder have lift the spear from the cleft in which it stood he
commenc hi ascent hi first movement cost him a pang of agoni
and no wonder for the blood from wound that had been caus by the
friction of hi flesh as he wa hurl along the surfac of the slide
had congeal freez hi limb to the ic whenc thei could not
easili be loosen the pain sharp as it wa did him good howev
for it arous hi benumb energi and enabl him to drag on the
goatskin cord with all hi strength while otter tug at that which
wa beneath hi arm
well for him wa it that the dwarf had taken the precaut of throw
down thi second line for present otter stake which had no firm
hold in the frozen earth came out and slid awai strike leonard as it
pass and bear the knot length of the cloak with it the dwarf
cri aloud and bent forward as though he were about to fall by a
fear effort he recov himself and held fast the rope in hi hand
while leonard suspend by it swung to and fro on the surfac of the
ic like the pendulum of a clock
then follow the most terribl moment of all their struggl against
the difficulti of thi merciless place the dwarf held fast abov and
leonard ceas to swing lai with hand and leg outstretch on the
face of the ic
now baa said otter be brave and when i pull do you wriggl
forward
he tug till the thin hide rope stretch while leonard claw and
kick at the ic with hi toe knee and disengag hand
ala it gave no holdh might as well have tri to climb a dome of
plate glass at an angl of sixti degre
rest awhil baa said the dwarf whose breath wa come in great
sob then make a littl nick in the ic with the blade of the spear
and when next i pull try to set some of your weight upon it
leonard did as he wa bid without speak
now said the dwarf and with a push and a struggl leonard wa two
feet higher up the inclin again the process wa repeat and thi
time he got hi left hand into the lowest of the two step that otter
had hack with the knife and onc more thei paus for breath a third
effort the fiercest of them all a clasp of hand and he wa ly
trembl like a frighten child abov the glacier lip
the ordeal wa over that danger wa done with but at what a cost
leonard nerv were complet shatter he could not stand hi
face wa bleed hi nail were broken and the bone of on knee wa
expos by the friction of the ic to sai noth of the shock to the
system and the bruis which he had receiv when he wa hurl from the
stone otter condit wa a littl better but hi hand were cut
by the rope and he wa utterli exhaust with toil and the strain of
suspens inde of the three juanna had come off by far the best for
she swoon at the veri begin of the passag of the bridg and when
thei were jerk from the stone be lighter than leonard she had
fallen upon him moreov the thick goatskin cloak which wa wrap
about her had protect her from all hurt beyond a few trifl cut and
bruis of their horribl posit when thei were hang to the spear
and the rest of the adventur includ the death of soa she knew
noth and it wa well for her reason that thi wa so
otter murmur leonard in a shake voic have you lost that gourd
of spirit
no baa it is safe
thank heaven he said hold it to my lip if you can
the dwarf lift it with a trembl hand and leonard gulp down the
fieri liquor
that better he said take some yourself
nai baa i have sworn to touch drink no more otter answer
look at the gourd longingli besid you and the shepherdess will
want it all i have some food here and i will eat
what happen to soa otter
i could not see rightli baa i wa too frighten much more
frighten than i had been when i rode the stone myself but i think
that her leg caught in the ic on thi side of the hole and so she
fell it wa a good end for her the viciou old cow he ad with a
touch of satisfact
it wa veri near be a bad end for us answer leonard but we
have manag to come out of it aliv somehow not for all the rubi in
the world would i cross that place again
nor i baa wow it wa aw now my stomach went through my head
and now my head went through my stomach and the air wa red and green
and blue and devil shout at me out of it ye and when i came to
the hole there i saw the waterdwel all fashion in fire wait
with an open mouth to eat me it wa the drink that made me think of
these thing baa and that is why i have sworn to touch it no
more ye i swore it as i flew through the air and saw the flame
waterdwel beneath me and now baa i am a littl rest so let us
try and wake up the shepherdess and get us gone
ye said leonard though i am sure i do not know where we ar to go
to it cant be far for i am nearli spent
then crawl to where juanna lai wrap in her cloak otter pour
some of the nativ spirit down her throat while leonard rub her
hand present thi treatment produc it effect for she sat up with
a start and see the ic befor her began to shriek sai take
me awai i cant do it leonard i cant inde
all right dear he answer you have done it we ar over
oh she said i am thank but where is soa i thought that i
heard her throw herself down behind us
soa is dead he answer she fell down the gulf and nearli pull
us with her i will tell you all about it afterward you ar not fit to
hear it now come dear let us be go out of thi accurs place
juanna stagger to her feet
i am so stiff and sore that i can hardli stand she said but
leonard what is the matter with you you ar cover with blood
i will tell you afterward he repli again
then otter collect their baggag which consist chiefli of the hide
line and the spear and thei crawl forward up the snowslop some
twenti or thirti yard ahead of them and almost side by side lai the
two glacier stone on which thei had pass the bridg and near them
those which otter had despatch as pioneer on the previou morn
thei look at them wonder who could have believ that these inert
thing not an hour befor had been speed down the ici wai quicker
than ani express train that ever travel and thei with them
on thing wa certain did thei remain unbroken for anoth two or three
million year and that is a short life for a stone thei would never
again make so strang a journei
then the three toil on to the top of the snowslop which wa about
four hundr yard awai
look baa said otter who had turn to gaze a fond farewel at the
gulf behind there ar peopl yonder on the further side
he wa right on the far brink of the crevass were the form of men
who seem to be wave their arm in the air and shout but whether
these were the priest who have overcom the resist of olfan had
pursu the fugit to kill them or the soldier of the king who had
conquer the priest the distanc would not allow them to see the
fate of olfan and the further domest histori of the peopl of the mist
were now seal book to them for thei never heard ani more of these
matter nor ar thei like to do so
then the travel began to descend from field to field of snow the
great peak abov alon remain to remind them that thei were near to
the countri of the mist onc thei stop to eat a littl of such food
as thei had with them and often enough to rest for their strength wa
small inde as thei drag themselv wearili forward each of the
men hold juanna by the hand leonard found himself wonder how it
came about put asid the bodili peril from which thei had escap
that thei had surviv the exhaust and the horror physic and
mental of the last fortyeight hour
but there thei were still aliv though in a sorri plight and befor
even thei found themselv below the snow line in a warm and genial
climat
i must stop said juanna as the sun began to set i can drag myself
no further
leonard look at otter in despair
there is a big tree yonder baa said the dwarf with an attempt at
cheer and water by it it is a good place to camp and here the
air is warm we shall not suffer from cold nai we ar lucki inde
think how we pass last night
thei reach the tree and juanna sank down half faint against it
bole with difficulti leonard persuad her to swallow a littl meat
and a mouth of spirit and then to hi relief she relaps into a
condit with partook more of the natur of stupor than of sleep
chapter xl
otter farewel
the night which follow leonard is wont to declar prove to be the
veri worst that he ever spent in hi life notwithstand hi intens
weari he could not sleep hi nerv were too shatter to allow
of it whenev he shut hi ey he saw himself hang head downward
over the oubliett in the cell beneath the idol or fly through the
air across the dread gap in the icebridg or in some other posit
of terror similar to those with which thei had made such intim
acquaint of late did these vision ceas from time to time he
seem to hear the voic of francisco bid him farewel the yell of
soa fall to her dread death or nam rave hi last defianc at
them also hi hurt which were mani gave him great pain and though
the climat here wa mild the breez from the snow height chill him
through and thei had not even a match wherewith to light a fire and
scare the wild beast that roar about them
rare have three human be been in a posit more desol
and desper than that in which thei found themselv thi night
exhaust unarm almost without food or cloth and wander thei
knew not where through the vast of central africa unless some help
found them as leonard wa awar thei must perish of starvat by the
fang of lion or the spear of nativ it wa imposs that thei
could live through anoth week and the thought came into hi mind that
it would be well for them if thei di that night and had done with it
it would be well ye and it would have been better if he had been laid
by the side of hi brother tom befor ever he listen to soa accurs
tale of the peopl of the mist and their treasur of rubi onli then
he would never have known juanna for she must have di in the slave
camp
thi wa the fruit of put faith in the vision of dy men and
yet it wa strang he had nearli got the monei and by the help of
a woman for those rubi would have suffic to bui back outram ten
time over but ala nearli is not quit that dream wa done with
and even if thei escap it would be to find himself more utterli
beggar than befor for now he would be a marri beggar
at last the night wore awai and the dawn came but juanna did not wake
until the sun wa high leonard who had crept to a littl distancefor
now he wa quit unabl to walksaw her sit up and crawl back to her
she stare at him vacantli and said someth about jane beach then he
knew that she wa wander there wa noth to be done what could be
done in that wilder with a woman in delirium except wait for death
accordingli leonard and otter wait for some hour then the dwarf
who wa in far the best condit of the three took the spearolfan
giftand said that he would go and seek for food sinc their store wa
exhaust leonard nod though he knew that there wa littl chanc
of a man arm with a spear alon be abl to kill game and otter
went
toward even he return report that he had seen plenti of buck
but could not get near them which wa just what hi master expect
that night thei pass hungri by turn watch juanna who wa still
deliri at dawn otter start out again leav leonard who had
been unabl to sleep as on the previou night crouch at juanna
side hi face buri in hi hand
befor noon leonard chanc to look up and saw the dwarf reel
toward him for he also wa faint with want of food inde hi great
head and almost nake bodi through the skin of which the misshapen
bone seem to start in everi direct present so curiou a
spectacl that hi master whose brain wa shaken by weak began to
laugh
dont laugh baa gasp the dwarf either i am mad or we ar
save
then i think that you must be mad otter for we shall take a deal
of save he answer wearili for he had ceas to believ in good
fortun what is it
thi baa there is a white man come thi wai and more than a
hundr servant with him thei ar march up the mountain slope
you ar certainli mad otter leonard repli what in the name of
jal and aca is a white man do here i am the onli on of that speci
who have been fool enough to penetr these region i and francisco
and he shut hi ey and doze off
otter look at him for a while then he tap hi forehead
significantli and start down the slope again an hour later leonard
still doze wa awaken by a sound of mani voic and by a hand that
shook him not too gentli
awak baa said the dwarf for the hand wa hi i have caught the
white man and brought him here
leonard stagger to hi feet and saw befor him surround by
gunbear and other attend an english gentleman rather under
than over middl ag with a round and kindli face tan by the sun
and somewhat deepset dark ey have an eyeglass fix in on of them
through which it wearer regard him with much commiser
how do you do sir said the stranger in a pleasant voic so far
as i can make out from your servant you seem to be in a baddish wai by
georg there is a ladi
how do you do answer leonard capit sunhelmet that of your
i envi it but you see i have had to go barehead late and he
ran hi finger through hi mat hair who is the maker of that
eightbor look a good gun
achmet said the stranger turn to an arab at hi side go to the
first donkei and fetch thi lord of the earth a pint of champagn and
some oatmeal cake he seem to want them tell the bearer also to
bring up my tent and to pitch it there by the water quick now
fortyeight hour had pass and the benevol stranger wa sit
on a campstool in the door of hi tent look at two form that lai
wrap in blanket and comfort asleep within it
i suppos that thei will wake some time he murmur drop hi
eyeglass and take the pipe from hi mouth the quinin and champagn
have done them a lot of good there is noth like quinin and
champagn but what an unconscion liar that dwarf must be there
is onli on thing he can do better and that is eat i never saw a chap
stow awai so much grub though i must sai that he look as though he
need it still allow for all deduct it is a preciou queer
stori who ar thei and what the deuc ar thei do here on thing
is clear i never saw a finerlook man nor a prettier girl and
he fill hi pipe again replac the eyeglass in hi ey and began
smoke
ten minut later juanna sat up suddenli whereupon the stranger
withdrew out of sight she look round her wildli then see leonard
ly at the further side of the tent she crept to him and began
kiss him sai leonard thank god that you ar still aliv
leonard i dream that we both were dead thank god that you ar
aliv
then the man who had been thu adjur woke up also and return her
caress
by georg thi is quit affect said the travel i suppos
that thei ar marri if not thei ought to be ani wai i had better
clear out for a while
an hour later he return to find that the pair had made themselv as
present as soap and water and some few spare garment which he had
sent to leonard would allow and were now sit in the sun outsid
the tent he advanc lift hi helmet and thei rose to meet him
i suppos that i had better introduc myself he said with some
hesit for he wa a shy man i am an english travel do a
littl explor on my own account for lack of ani other occup
and my name is sydnei wallac
mine is leonard outram answer leonard and thi young ladi is miss
juanna rodd
mr wallac start and bow again so thei were not marri
we ar deepli indebt to you sir went on leonard for you have
rescu us from death
not at all answer mr wallac you must thank that servant of
your the dwarf and not me for if he had not seen us i should have
pass a mile or more to the left of you the fact is that i am rather
fond of mountain and see thi great peak abov usi am told
that it is the highest in the bisamushinga mountainsi thought that
i might as well have a try at it befor i turn homeward via lake
nyassa livingstonia blantyr and quiliman but perhap you will not
mind tell me how you came to be here i have heard someth from the
dwarf but hi tale seem a littl too steep
i am afraid you will think our rather steeper mr wallac
said leonard and he proceed to give him a short outlin of their
adventur
when he came to their arriv among the peopl of the mist and
describ the inaugur of otter and juanna as god in the templ of
the colossu he notic that hi auditor had let the eyeglass fall from
hi round ey and wa regard him with mild amaz
i am afraid that all thi doe not interest you said leonard stiffli
on the contrari mr outram it interest me veri much i am
exceedingli fond of romanc and thi is rather a good on
as i thought it is scarc worth while to go on said leonard again
well i cannot wonder that you do not believ me
leonard interpos juanna quietli you still have the star rubi
show it to mr wallac
he did so somewhat sulkili and then as he seem disinclin to sai
anyth more juanna took up the tale show in evid of it truth
the spear the frai rope and the tatter white robe which she had
worn in her charact of aca and inde still wore beneath poor
francisco cassockfor she had no other
mr wallac heard her out then without make ani comment he rose
sai that he must try to shoot some meat for the camp and beg that
thei would make themselv comfort until hi return that even
befor sundown he reappear and come straight to the tent ask
their pardon for hi incredul
i have been up yonder he said follow your spoor backward i
have seen the snowbridg and the stone and the nick which the dwarf
cut in the ic all is just as you told me and it onli remain for me
to congratul you upon have escap from the strangest seri of
danger that ever i heard of and he held out hi hand which both
leonard and juanna shook warmli
by the wai he ad i sent men to examin the gulf for sever
mile but thei report to me that thei found no spot where it would be
possibl to descend it and i fear therefor that the jewel ar lost
for ever i confess that i should have like to try to penetr
into the mist countri but my nerv ar not strong enough for the
icebridg and if thei were stone wont slide uphil besid you
must have had about enough of rough it and will be anxiou to turn
your face toward civilis so after you have rest anoth coupl
of dai i think that we had better start for quiliman which bar
accid is about three month march from here
shortli afterward thei start accordingli but with the detail of
their march we need not concern ourselv an except must be
made howev in the case of a singl event which happen at the
missionst of blantyr that event wa the wed of leonard and
juanna in conform with the ceremoni of their own church
no word of marriag had been spoken between them for some week and
yet the thought of it wa never out of the mind of either inde had
their feel been much less tender toward each other than wa the
case it would still have been desir in view of the extraordinari
intimaci into which thei had been thrown dure the past month that
thei should becom man and wife leonard felt that alon as she wa in
the wide world noth short of mutual avers would have justifi
him in separ from juanna and as it wa love and not avers
that he entertain toward her thi argument came home to him with
overmast forc
juanna he said to her on the dai of their arriv at blantyr you
rememb some word that pass between your father and myself when he
lai upon hi deathb to the effect that should we both wish it he
trust to my honour to remarri you formal as soon as an opportun
might aris
now the opportun is here and i ask you if you desir to take me for
your husband as abov everyth in the world i desir to make you my
belov wife
she colour to her beauti ey and answer in a voic that wa
almost a whisper
if you wish it and think me worthi of you leonard you know that
i wish it also i have alwai love you dear ye even when i wa
behav worst to you but there isjan beach
i have told you befor juanna he answer with some littl
irrit and now i tell you again that jane beach and i have done
with each other
i am sure that i am veri glad to hear it juanna repli still
somewhat dubious the rest of that convers be of a privat
charact will scarc interest the public
when he spoke thu leonard littl knew after what fashion jane beach
and he had wound up their old love affair
two dai later leonard outram took juanna rodd to wife to have and to
hold for better for wors for richer for poorer in sick and
in health to love and to cherish till death did them part and their
rescuer sydnei wallac who by now had becom their fast friend gave
her awai
veri curiou were the memori that pass through juanna mind as
she stood by her husband side in the littl grassroof chapel of
blantyr for wa thi not the third time that she had been marri and
now onli of her own free will she bethought her of that wild scene in
the slave camp of francisco who di to save her and of the bless
which he had call down upon her and thi veri man of that other
scene in the rock prison when to protect leonard life she wa
wed accord to the custom of the children of the mist to that
trueheart gentleman and savag olfan their king then she awok
with a happi sigh to know that the lover at her side could never be
taken from her again until death claim on of them
we shall be dreadfulli poor leonard she said to him afterward it
would have been much better for you dear if i had fallen into the gulf
instead of the rubi
i am not of your opinion love he answer with a smile for he wa
veri happi hang the rubi your price is far abov rubi and no man
mai struggl against fate i have alwai been abl to make a live for
myself heretofor and i do not doubt that i shall continu to do so for
both of us and we will leav the rest to provid you ar more to
me juanna than ani wealthmor even than outram
that even mr wallac found otter gaze disconsol at the littl
hous in which leonard and juanna were stai
ar you sad becaus your master is marri otter he ask
no answer the dwarf i am glad for month he ha been run
after her and dream of her and now at last he ha got her
henceforth she must dream of him and run after him and he will have
time to think about other peopl who love him quit as well
anoth month or so went by while the parti journei in easi stage
toward the coast and never had wed lover a happier honeymoon or
on more unconvent than that pass by leonard and juanna though
perhap mr wallac and otter did not find the contempl of their
raptur a veri exhilar occup
at last thei reach quiliman in safeti and pitch their camp on
some rise ground outsid of the settlement which is unhealthi next

thing went on for ten minut or more as she idli turn the page
of two or three issu of the weekli time try to collect her
thought and pick up the thread of current event

do you happen to mean miss jane beach said leonard quietli
at thi point juanna turn in her chair and becam extraordinarili
inde almost fierc interest in the convers
quit so beach wa the name you must excus my forget well
sir thomass affair fell into confus and after their father death

africa in that same year miss janeehbeach marri a client of our
mr cohen whose father had purchas the estat of outram from the

onli child a daughter name jane with revers to hi widow in fee
simpl within a month of hi death the child jane di also and nine
month later her mother ladi cohen nee jane beach follow her to

she bequeath the mansion hous and estat of outram togeth with
most of her person properti amount in all to someth over a
hundr thousand pound to her old friend leonard outram and the heir
of hi bodi with revers to her brother thi will ha not been

you upon be onc more the owner of your ancestr estat and a
consider fortun in cash
for a while leonard wa too agit to speak
i will prove to you he said at last that i am thi person that is
i will prove it prima faci afterward you can satisfi yourself of
the truth of my statement by the usual method and he proceed to
adduc a varieti of evid as to hi ident which need not be set
out here the lawyer listen in silenc take a note from time to
time
i think he said when leonard had finish that subject to those
inquiri of which you yourself have point out the necess in so
grave a matter i mai accept it as prove that you ar none other than
mr leonard outram or rather he ad correct himself if as i
understand your elder brother thoma is dead than sir leonard outram
inde you have so entir convinc me that thi is the case that i
have no hesit in place in your hand a letter address to you
by the late ladi cohen and deposit with me togeth with the execut
will though when you have read it i shall request you to leav that
letter with me for the present
by the wai it mai interest you to learn mr turner ad as he went
to a safe built into the wall and unlock it iron door that we have
been hunt for you for a year or more we even sent a man to south
africa and he track you to a spot in some mountain somewher north
of delagoa bai where it wa report that you with your brother thoma
and two friend were dig for gold he reach the spot on the night
of the ninth of mai last year
the veri dai that i left it broke in leonard
and found the site of your camp and three grave at first our
repres thought that you were all dead but afterward he fell
in with a nativ who appear to have desert from your servic and who
told him that on of the brother wa dy when he left the camp but
on wa still in good health though he did not know where he had gone
my brother thoma di on the first of maythi dai year said
leonard
after that all trace of you wa lost but i still kept on advertis
for miss peopl have a wonder wai of turn up to claim fortun
and you see the result here is the letter sir leonard
leonard took the document and look at it while strang feel
crowd into hi mind thi wa the first letter that he had ever
receiv from jane beach also it wa the last that he ever could
receiv
befor i open thi mr turner he said for my own satisfact
i mai as well ask you to compar the handwrit of the address with
anoth specimen of it that chanc to be in my possess and
produc the worn prayerbook from hi pocketjan part gifth
open it at the flyleaf and point out the inscript to the
lawyer place the envelop besid it
mr turner took a readingglass and examin first on write and then
the other
these word appear to have been written by the same hand he said
present ladi cohen write wa peculiar and it is difficult to
be mistaken on the point though i am no expert to free you from
respons with your consent i myself will open thi letter and
he slit the envelop at the top with an ivori paperknif and draw
out it content he hand them to leonard thei ran thu
my dearest leonardfor so i who am no longer a wife mai call you
without shame see that you ar in truth the dearest to my heart
whether you be still live or dead like my husband and my child
the will which i am to sign tomorrow will prove to you if you ar yet
aliv as i believ to be the case how deep is my anxieti that that you
should reenter into possess of the ancestr home of which fortun
ha depriv you it is with the greatest pleasur that i make you thi
bequest and i can do so with a clear conscienc for my late husband
ha left everyth at my absolut disposalb himself without near
relationsin the sad event which ha occur of the death of hi
daughter our onli child
mai you live long enough to enjoi the land and fortun which i am
enabl thu to return to your famili and mai your children and their
descend sit at outram for mani a gener to come
and now i will talk no more of thi matter for i have an explan
to make and a pardon to ask
it mai well be leonard that when your ey fall upon these line you
will have forgotten memost deservedlyand have found some other woman
to love you no as i set thi down i feel that it is not true you will
never forget me altogeth leonardyour first loveand no other woman
will ever be quit the same to you as i have been or at least so i
believ in my foolish and vaniti
you will ask what explan is possibl after the wai in which i have
treat you and the outrag that i have done to my own love such as it
is howev i offer it to you
i wa driven into thi marriag leonard by my late father who could
be veri cruel when he chose to admit thi is as i know a proof of
weak so be it i have never conceal from myself that i am weak
yet believ me i struggl while i could i wrote to you even but
thei intercept my letter and i told all the truth to mr cohen
but he wa selfwil and passion and would take no heed of my
plead so i marri him leonard and wa fairli happi with him for
he wa kind itself to me but from that hour i began to die
and now more than six year have pass sinc the night of our part
in the snow and the end is at hand for i am realli dy it ha
pleas god to take my littl daughter and thi last shock prove more
than i can bear and so i go to join her and to wait with her till such
time as i shall onc more see your unforgotten face
that is all that i have to sai dear leonard
pardon me and i am selfish enough to adddo not forget me
jane
pswhy is it that an affect like our which ha never born
fruit even should in the end prove stronger than ani other earthli tie
heaven know and heaven alon how passion i love and love my
dead child and yet now that my own hour is at hand it is of you
that i think the most you who ar neither child nor husband i suppos
that i shall understand er long but o leonard leonard leonard if
as i believ my natur is immort i swear that such love as mine
for you howev much it be dishonour and betrai is still the most
immort part of itj
leonard put down the letter on the tabl and again he cover hi face
with hi hand to hide hi emot for hi feel overcam him as a
sens of the depth and puriti of thi dead woman undi love sank
into hi heart
mai i read that letter leonard ask juanna in a quiet voic
ye i suppos so dear if you like he answer feel dulli that
it wa better to make a clean breast of the matter at onc and thu to
prevent futur misunderstand
juanna took the letter and perus it twice by which time she knew it
as well as she did the lord prayer nor did she ever forget a singl
word of it then she hand it back to the lawyer sai noth
i understand said mr turner break in on a silenc which he felt
to be pain that you will be abl to produc the necessari proof of
ident within the next few dai and then we can get the will prove
in the usual form meanwhil you must want monei which i will take the
risk of advanc you and he wrote a chequ for a hundr pound and
gave it to leonard
half an hour later leonard and juanna were alon in a room at their
hotel but as yet scarc a word had pass between them sinc thei
left the lawyer offic
dont you see leonard hi wife said almost fierc it is most
amus you made a mistak your brother dy propheci wa like a
delphic oracleit could be taken two wai and of cours you adopt
the wrong interpret you left grave mountain a dai too soon it wa
by jane beach help that you were to recov outram not by mine
and she laugh sadli
dont talk like that dear said leonard in a sad voic it pain
me
how els am i to talk after read that letter she answer for
what woman can hold her own against a dead rival now also i must be
indebt to her bounti all my dai oh if i had not lost the jewelsif
onli i had not lost the jewel
histori doe not relat how leonard dealt with thi unexpect and yet
natur situat
a week had pass and leonard with juanna at hi side found himself
onc more in the great hall at outram where on a bygon night mani
year ago he and hi dead brother had sworn their oath all wa the
same for in thi hall noth had been changedjan had seen to that
there chain to it stand wa the bibl upon which thei had regist
their vow there were the pictur of hi ancestor gaze down calmli
upon him as though thei care littl for the stori of hi struggl and
of hi strang triumph over fortun by the help of a woman there
wa the paint window with it blazon coat of arm and it proud
mottoesfor heart home and honour and per ardua ad astra he
had won the heart and home and he had kept hi honour and hi oath he
had endur the toil and danger and the crown of star wa hi
and yet wa leonard altogeth happi as he stood look on these
familiar thing perhap not quit for yonder in the churchyard there
wa a grave and within the church a monument in white marbl that wa
wonderfulli like on who had love him and whom he had love though
time and troubl had written a strang differ on her face also he
had fail he had kept hi oath inde and fought on till the end wa
won but himself he had not won it what now wa hi had onc belong
to hi success rival who doubtless littl dream of the payment
that would be exact from him by the decre of fate
and wa juanna happi she knew well that leonard love her truli
but oh it wa cruel that she who had share the struggl should be
depriv of her rewardthat it should be left to anoth who if not
fals had at least been weak to give to her husband that which she had
striven so hard to winthat which she had wonand lost and harder
still wa it that in thi ancient place which would henceforth be her
home by dai and by night she must feel the presenc of the shadow of a
woman a woman sweet and pale who as she believ stood between her
and that which she desir abov all thingsth complet and absolut
possess of her husband heart
doubtless she overr the troubl men and women do not spend their
live in brood upon the memori of their first lovesif thei did
thi would be a melancholi world but to juanna it wa real enough
and remain so for some year and if a thing is true to the heart it
avail littl that reason should give it the lie
in short now in the hour of their full properti leonard and juanna
were make acquaint with the fact that fortun never give with
both hand as the french sai but love to rob with on while she
bestow with the other to few is it allow to be complet miser
to none to be complet happi their good luck had been so overwhelm
in mani wai that it would have partaken of the unnatur and might
well have excit their fear for the futur had it complet been
unmar by these drawback which such as thei were probabl thei
learn to disrememb as the year pass over them bring them new
trial and ad bless
perhap a peep into the futur will tell us the rest of the stori
of leonard and juanna outram better and more truli than ani further
chronicl of event
ten year or so have gone by and sir leonard now a member of parliament
