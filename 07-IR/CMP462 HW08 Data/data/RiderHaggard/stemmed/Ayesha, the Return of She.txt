author note
not with a view of concili those reader who on principl object to
sequel but as a matter of fact the author wish to sai that he doe
not so regard thi book
rather doe he ventur to ask that it should be consid as the
conclus of an imagin tragedi if he mai so call it whereof on
half ha been alreadi publish
thi conclus it wa alwai hi desir to write should he be destin
to live through those mani year which in obedi to hi origin
design must be allow to laps between the event of the first and
second part of the romanc
in respons to mani enquiri he mai add that the name ayesha which
sinc the dai of the prophet mahomet who had a wife so call and
perhap befor them ha been common in the east should be pronounc
assha
introduct
verili and inde it is the unexpect that happen probabl if there
wa on person upon the earth from whom the editor of thi and of a
certain previou histori did not expect to hear again that person wa
ludwig horac holli thi too for a good reason he believ him to
have taken hi departur from the earth
when mr holli last wrote mani mani year ago it wa to transmit the
manuscript of she and to announc that he and hi ward leo vincei
the belov of the divin ayesha were about to travel to central asia
in the hope i suppos that there she would fulfil her promis and
appear to them again
often i have wonder idli enough what happen to them there whether
thei were dead or perhap drone their live awai as monk in some
thibetan lamaseri or studi magic and practis ascetic under
the tuition of the eastern master trust that thu thei would build a
bridg by which thei might pass to the side of their ador immort
now at length when i had not thought of them for month without a
singl warn sign out of the blue as it were come the answer to
these wonder
to thinkonli to thinkthat i the editor aforesaid from it
appear suspect someth quit familiar and without interest
push asid that dingi unregist brownpap parcel direct in an
unknown hand and for two whole dai let it lie forgotten inde there
it might be ly now had not anoth person been move to curios
and open it found within a bundl of manuscript badli burn upon
the back and with thi two letter address to myself
although so great a time had pass sinc i saw it and it wa shaki
now becaus of the author ag or sick i knew the write at
oncenobodi ever made an h with that peculiar twirl under it except
mr holli i tore open the seal envelop and sure enough the first
thing my ey fell upon wa the signatur l h holli it is long
sinc i read anyth so eagerli as i did that letter here it is
my dear siri have ascertain that you still live and strang to
sai i still live alsofor a littl while
as soon as i came into touch with civil again i found a copi of
your book she or rather of my book and read itfirst of all in a
hindostani translat my hosth wa a minist of some religi
bodi a man of worthi but prosaic mindexpress surpris that a wild
romanc should absorb me so much i answer that those who have wide
experi of the hard fact of life often find interest in romanc had
he known what were the hard fact to which i allud i wonder what that
excel person would have said
i see that you carri out your part of the busi well and
faithfulli everi instruct ha been obei noth ha been ad or
taken awai therefor to you to whom some twenti year ago i entrust
the begin of the histori i wish to entrust it end also you were
the first to learn of shewhomustbeobei who from centuri to
centuri sat alon cloth with unchang loveli in the sepulchr
of kor wait till her lost love wa born again and destini brought
him back to her
it is right therefor that you should be the first to learn also of
ayesha hesea and spirit of the mountain the priestess of that oracl
which sinc the time of alexand the great ha reign between the
flame pillar in the sanctuari the last holder of the sceptr of he
or isi upon the earth it is right also that to you first among men
i should reveal the mystic consumm of the wondrou tragedi which
began at kor or perchanc far earlier in egypt and elsewher
i am veri ill i have struggl back to thi old hous of mine to die
and my end is at hand i have ask the doctor here after all is over
to send you the record that is unless i chang my mind and burn it
first you will also receiv if you receiv anyth at all a case
contain sever rough sketch which mai be of us to you and a
sistrum the instrument that ha been alwai us in the worship of
the natur goddess of the old egyptian isi and hathor which you
will see is as beauti as it is ancient i give it to you for two
reason as a token of my gratitud and regard and as the onli piec of
evid that is left to me of the liter truth of what i have written
in the accompani manuscript where you will find it often mention
perhap also you will valu it as a souvenir of i suppos the
strangest and loveliest be who ever wa or rather is it wa her
sceptr the rod of her power with which i saw her salut the shadow
in the sanctuari and her gift to me
it ha virtu also some part of ayesha might yet haunt the symbol
to which even spirit bow but if you should discov them bewar how
thei ar us
i have neither the strength nor the will to write more the record must
speak for itself do with it what you like and believ it or not as you
like i care noth who know that it is true
who and what wa ayesha nai what is ayesha an incarn essenc
a materialis spirit of natur the unforese the love the cruel
and the immort ensoul alon redeem onli by human and it
piteou sacrific sai you i have done with specul who depart to
solv these mysteri
i wish you happi and good fortun farewel to you and to all
l horac holli
i laid the letter down and fill with sensat that it is useless
to attempt to analys or describ open the second envelop of which
i also print the content omit onli certain irrelev portion
and the name of the writer as it will be note he request me to do
thi epistl that wa date from a remot place upon the shore of
cumberland ran as follow
dear sira the doctor who attend mr holli in hi last ill i
am oblig in obedi to a promis that i made to him to becom an
intermediari in a some what strang busi although in truth it is
on of which i know veri littl howev much it mai have interest me
still i do so onli on the strict understand that no mention is to
be made of my name in connexion with the matter or of the local in
which i practis
about ten dai ago i wa call in to see mr holli at an old hous
upon the cliff that for mani year remain unten except by the
caretak which hous wa hi properti and had been in hi famili for
gener the housekeep who summon me told me that her master had
but just return from abroad somewher in asia she said and that
he wa veri ill with hi heartdi she believ both of which
supposit prove to be accur
i found the patient sit up in bed to eas hi heart and a
strangelook old man he wa he had dark ey small but full of fire
and intellig a magnific and snowywhit beard that cover a
chest of extraordinari breadth and hair also white which encroach
upon hi forehead and face so much that it met the whisker upon hi
cheek hi arm were remark for their length and strength though
on of them seem to have been much torn by some anim he told me
that a dog had done thi but if so it must have been a dog of unusu
power he wa a veri ugli man and yet forgiv the bull beauti i
cannot describ what i mean better than by sai that hi face wa
not like the face of ani ordinari mortal whom i have met in my
limit experi were i an artist who wish to portrai a wise and
benevol but rather grotesqu spirit i should take that counten
as a model
mr holli wa somewhat vex at my be call in which had been done
without hi knowledg soon we becam friendli enough howev and he
express gratitud for the relief that i wa abl to give him though
i could not hope to do more at differ time he talk a good deal
of the variou countri in which he had travel appar for veri
mani year upon some strang quest that he never clearli den to
me twice also he becam lighthead and spoke for the most part in
languag that i identifi as greek and arab occasion in english
also when he appear to be address himself to a be who wa the
object of hi vener i might almost sai of hi worship what
he said then howev i prefer not to repeat for i heard it in my
profession capac
on dai he point to a rough box made of some foreign wood the same
that i have now duli despatch to you by train and give me your
name and address said that without fail it wa to be forward to you
after hi death also he ask me to do up a manuscript which like the
box wa to be sent to you
he saw me look at the last sheet which had been burn awai and
said i repeat hi exact word
ye ye that cant be help now it must go as it is you see i
made up my mind to destroi it after all and it wa alreadi on the fire
when the command cameth clear unmistak commandand i snatch
it off again
what mr holli meant by thi command i do not know for he would
speak no more of the matter
i pass on to the last scene on night about eleven oclock know
that my patient end wa near i went up to see him propos to
inject some strychnin to keep the heart go a littl longer befor
i reach the hous i met the caretak come to seek me in a great
fright and ask her if her master wa dead she answer no but he
wa gonehad got out of bed and just as he wa barefoot left
the hous and wa last seen by her grandson among the veri scotch fir
where we were talk the lad who wa terrifi out of hi wit for
he thought that he beheld a ghost had told her so
the moonlight wa veri brilliant that night especi as fresh snow
had fallen which reflect it rai i wa on foot and began to search
among the fir till present just outsid of them i found the track of
nake feet in the snow of cours i follow call to the housekeep
to go and wake her husband for no on els live near by the spoor
prove veri easi to trace across the clean sheet of snow it ran up the
slope of a hill behind the hous
now on the crest of thi hill is an ancient monument of upright
monolith set there by some primev peopl known local as the
devil ringa sort of miniatur stoneheng in fact i had seen it
sever time and happen to have been present not long ago at a
meet of an archaeolog societi when it origin and purpos were
discuss i rememb that on learn but somewhat eccentr gentleman
read a short paper upon a rude hood bust and head that ar cut within
the chamber of a tall flattop cromlech or dolmen which stand
alon in the centr of the ring
he said that it wa a represent of the egyptian goddess isi and
that thi place had onc been sacr to some form of her worship or at
ani rate to that of a natur goddess with like attribut a suggest
which the other learn gentlemen treat as absurd thei declar that
isi had never travel into britain though for my part i do not see
why the phoenician or even the roman who adopt her cult more
or less should not have brought it here but i know noth of such
matter and will not discuss them
i rememb also that mr holli wa acquaint with thi place for
he had mention it to me on the previou dai ask if the stone were
still uninjur as thei us to be when he wa young he ad also and
the remark struck me that yonder wa where he would wish to die when i
answer that i fear he would never take so long a walk again i note
that he smile a littl
well thi convers gave me a clue and without troubl more
about the footprint i went on as fast as i could to the ring half a
mile or so awai present i reach it and therey therestand
by the cromlech barehead and cloth in hi nightth onli
stood mr holli in the snow the strangest figur i think that ever i
beheld
inde never shall i forget that wild scene the circl of rough
singl stone point upward to the starstrewn sky intens lone
and intens solemn the tall trilithon tower abov them in the
centr it shadow thrown by the bright moon behind it ly long
and black upon the dazzl sheet of snow and stand clear of thi
shadow so that i could distinguish hi everi motion and even the rapt
look upon hi dy face the whitedrap figur of mr holli he
appear to be utter some invocationin arab i thinkfor long
befor i reach him i could catch the tone of hi full sonor
voic and see hi wave outstretch arm in hi right hand he held
the loop sceptr which by hi express wish i send to you with the
draw i could see the flash of the jewel strung upon the wire and
in the great still hear the tinkl of it golden bell
present too i seem to becom awar of anoth presenc and now
you will understand why i desir and must ask that my ident should
be suppress natur enough i do not wish to be mix up with a
superstiti tale which is on the face of it imposs and absurd
yet under all the circumst i think it right to tell you that i saw
or thought i saw someth gather in the shadow of the central dolmen
or emerg from it rude chamberi know not which for certainsometh
bright and gloriou which gradual took the form of a woman upon whose
forehead burn a starlik fire
at ani rate the vision or reflect or whatev it wa startl me
so much that i came to a halt under the lee of on of the monolith and
found myself unabl even to call to the distraught man whom i pursu
whilst i stood thu it becam clear to me that mr holli also saw
someth at least he turn toward the radianc in the shadow
utter on cry a wild glad cry and step forward then seem to
fall through it on to hi face
when i reach the spot the light had vanish and all i found wa mr
holli hi arm still outstretch and the sceptr grip tightli in
hi hand ly quit dead in the shadow of the trilithon
the rest of the doctor letter need not be quot as it deal onli with
certain veri improb explan of the origin of thi figur of
light the detail of the remov of holli bodi and of how he manag
to satisfi the coron that no inquest wa necessari
the box of which he speak arriv safe of the draw in it i need
sai noth and of the sistrum or sceptr onli a few word it wa
fashion of crystal to the wellknown shape of the cruxansata or
the emblem of life of the egyptian the rod the cross and the loop
combin in on from side to side of thi loop ran golden wire and on
these were strung gem of three colour glitter diamond seablu
sapphir and bloodr rubi while to the fourth wire that at the
top hung four littl golden bell
when i took hold of it first my arm shook slightli with excit and
those bell began to sound a sweet faint music like to that of chime
heard far awai at night in the silenc of the sea i thought too but
perhap thi wa fanci that a thrill pass from the hallow and
beauti thing into my bodi
on the mysteri itself as it is record in the manuscript i make no
comment of it and it inner signif everi reader must form hi
or her own judgment on thing alon is clear to meon the hypothesi
that mr holli tell the truth as to what he and leo vincei saw
and experienc which i at least believethat though sundri
interpret of thi mysteri were advanc by ayesha and other none
of them ar quit satisfactori
inde like mr holli i inclin to the theori that she if i mai still
call her by that name although it is seldom given to her in these page
put forward some of them such as the vagu isismyth and the wondrou
picturestori of the mountainfir as mere veil to hide the truth
which it wa her purpos to reveal at last in that song she never sang

my death is veri near to me and of thi i am glad for i desir to
pursu the quest in other realm as it ha been promis to me that i
shall do i desir to learn the begin and the end of the spiritu
drama of which it ha been my strang lot to read some page upon earth
i ludwig horac holli have been veri ill thei carri me more dead
than aliv down those mountain whose lowest slope i can see from my
window for i write thi on the northern frontier of india inde ani
other man had long sinc perish but destini kept my breath in me
perhap that a record might remain i must bide here a month or two
till i am strong enough to travel homeward for i have a fanci to die
in the place where i wa born so while i have strength i will put the
stori down or at least those part of it that ar most essenti for
much can or at ani rate must be omit i shrink from attempt too
long a book though my note and memori would furnish me with suffici
materi for volum
i will begin with the vision
after leo vincei and i came back from africa in 1885 desir solitud
which inde we need sore to recov from the fear shock we had
experienc and to give us time and opportun to think we went to an
old hous upon the shore of cumberland that ha belong to my famili
for mani gener thi hous unless somebodi ha taken it believ
me to be dead is still my properti and thither i travel to die
those whose ey read the word i write if ani should ever read them
mai askwhat shock
well i am horac holli and my companion my belov friend my son in
the spirit whom i rear from infanc wasnai isleo vincei
we ar those men who follow an ancient clue travel to the cave
of kor in central africa and there discov her whom we sought
the immort shewhomustbeobei in leo she found her love that
reborn kallikr the grecian priest of isi whom some two thousand
year befor she had slain in her jealou rage thu execut on him
the judgment of the angri goddess in her also i found the divin whom
i wa doom to worship from afar not with the flesh for that is all
lost and gone from me but what is sorer still becaus it burden
is undi with the will and soul which anim a man throughout the
countless eon of hi be the flesh di or at least it chang and
it passion pass but that other passion of the spiritthat long
for onenessi undi as itself
what crime have i commit that thi sore punish should be laid
upon me yet in truth is it a punish mai it not prove to be
but that black and terribl gate which lead to the joyou palac of
reward she swore that i should ever be her friend and hi and dwell
with them etern and i believ her
for how mani winter did we wander among the ici hill and desert
still at length the messeng came and led us to the mountain and on
the mountain we found the shrine and in the shrine the spirit mai not
these thing be an allegori prepar for our instruct i will take
comfort i will hope that it is so nai i am sure that it is so
it will be rememb that in kor we found the immort woman there
befor the flash rai and vapour of the pillar of life she declar
her mystic love and then in our veri sight wa swept to a doom so
horribl that even now after all which ha been and gone i shiver at
it recollect yet what were ayesha last word forget me
not have piti on my shame i die not i shall come again and shall
onc more be beauti i swear itit is true
well i cannot set out that histori afresh moreov it is written the
man whom i trust in the matter did not fail me and the book he made
of it seem to be known throughout the world for i have found it here
in english ye and read it first translat into hindostani to it
then i refer the curiou
in that hous upon the desol seashor of cumberland we dwelt a
year mourn the lost seek an avenu by which it might be found
again and discov none here our strength came back to us and leo
hair that had been whiten in the horror of the cave grew again from
grei to golden hi beauti return to him also so that hi face wa as
it had been onli purifi and sadden
well i rememb that nightand the hour of illumin we were
heartbroken we were in despair we sought sign and could find none
the dead remain dead to us and no answer came to all our cry
it wa a sullen august even and after we had dine we walk upon
the shore listen to the slow surg of the wave and watch the
lightn flicker from the bosom of a distant cloud in silenc we
walk till at last leo groanedit wa more of a sob than a groanand
clasp my arm
i can bear it no longer horac he saidfor so he call me nowi
am in torment the desir to see ayesha onc more sap my brain without
hope i shall go quit mad and i am strong i mai live anoth fifti
year
what then can you do i ask
i can take a short road to knowledgeor to peac he answer
solemnli i can die and die i willy tonight
i turn upon him angrili for hi word fill me with fear
leo you ar a coward i said cannot you bear your part of pain
asoth do
you mean as you do horac he answer with a dreari laugh for on
you also the curs lieswith less caus well you ar stronger than i
am and more tough perhap becaus you have live longer no i cannot
bear it i will die
it is a crime i said the greatest insult you can offer to the
power that made you to cast back it gift of life as a thing outworn
contempt and despis a crime i sai which will bring with it
wors punish than ani you can dream perhap even the punish of
everlast separ
doe a man stretch in some tortureden commit a crime if he snatch
a knife and kill himself horac perhap but sure that sin should
find forgivenessif torn flesh and quiver nerv mai plead for
merci i am such a man and i will us that knife and take my chanc
she is dead and in death at least i shall be nearer her
why so leo for aught you know ayesha mai be live
no for then she would have given me some sign my mind is made up so
talk no more or if talk we must let it be of other thing
then i plead with him though with littl hope for i saw that what i
had fear for long wa come to pass leo wa mad shock and sorrow
had destroi hi reason were it not so he in hi own wai a veri
religi man on who held as i knew strict opinion on such matter
would never have purpos to commit the wicked of suicid
leo i said ar you so heartless that you would leav me here alon
do you pai me thu for all my love and care and wish to drive me to my
death do so if you will and my blood be on your head
your blood why your blood horac
becaus that road is broad and two can travel it we have live long
year togeth and togeth endur much i am sure that we shall not be
long part
then the tabl were turn and he grew afraid for me but i onli
answer if you die i tell you that i shall die also it will
certainli kill me
so leo gave wai well he exclaim suddenli i promis you it shall
not be tonight let us give life anoth chanc
good i answer but i went to my bed full of fear for i wa certain
that thi desir of death have onc taken hold of him would grow
and grow until at length it becam too strong and thenthen i should
wither and die who could not live on alon in my despair i threw out my
soul toward that of her who wa depart
ayesha i cri if you have ani power if in ani wai it is
permit show that you still live and save your lover from thi sin
and me from a broken heart have piti on hi sorrow and breath hope
into hi spirit for without hope leo cannot live and without him i
shall not live
then worn out i slept
i wa arous by the voic of leo speak to me in low excit tone
through the dark
horac he said horac my friend my father listen
in an instant i wa wide awak everi nerv and fibr of me for the
tone of hi voic told me that someth had happen which bore upon
our destini
let me light a candl first i said
never mind the candl horac i would rather speak in the dark i went
to sleep and i dream the most vivid dream that ever came to me i
seem to stand under the vault of heaven it wa black black not a
star shone in it and a great loneli possess me then suddenli
high up in the vault mile and mile awai i saw a littl light and
thought that a planet had appear to keep me compani the light began
to descend slowli like a float flake of fire down it sank and down
and down till it wa but just abov me and i perceiv that it wa
shape like a tongu or fan of flame at the height of my head from the
ground it stop and stood steadi and by it ghostli radianc i saw
that beneath wa the shape of a woman and that the flame burn upon her
forehead the radianc gather strength and now i saw the woman
horac it wa ayesha herself her ey her love face her cloudi
hair and she look at me sadli reproachfulli i thought as on might
who sai why did you doubt
i tri to speak to her but my lip were dumb i tri to advanc and
to embrac her my arm would not move there wa a barrier between us
she lift her hand and beckon as though bid me to follow her
then she glide awai and horac my spirit seem to loos itself
from the bodi and to be given the power to follow we pass swiftli
eastward over land and sea andi knew the road at on point
she paus and i look downward beneath shine in the moonlight
appear the ruin palac of kor and there not far awai wa the gulf
we trod togeth
onward abov the marsh and now we stood upon the ethiopian head
and gather round watch us earnestli were the face of the arab
our companion who drown in the sea beneath job wa among them also
and he smile at me sadli and shook hi head as though he wish to
accompani us and could not
across the sea again across the sandi desert across more sea and
the shore of india lai beneath us then northward ever northward
abov the plain till we reach a place of mountain cap with
etern snow we pass them and stai for an instant abov a build
set upon the brow of a plateau it wa a monasteri for old monk drone
prayer upon it terrac i shall know it again for it is built in the
shape of a halfmoon and in front of it sit the gigant ruin statu
of a god who gaze everlastingli across the desert i knew how i cannot
sai that now we were far past the furthest border of thibet and that
in front of us lai untrodden land more mountain stretch beyond that
desert a sea of snowi peak hundr and hundr of them
near to the monasteri jut out into the plain like some rocki
headland rose a solitari hill higher than all behind we stood upon
it snowi crest and wait till present abov the mountain and the
desert at our feet shot a sudden beam of light that beat upon us like
some signal flash across the sea on we went float down the
beamon over the desert and the mountain across a great flat land
beyond in which were mani villag and a citi on a mound till we lit
upon a tower peak then i saw that thi peak wa loopshap like the
symbol of life of the egyptiansth cruxansataand support by
a lava stem hundr of feet in height also i saw that the fire which
shone through it rose from the crater of a volcano beyond upon the veri
crest of thi loop we rest a while till the shadow of ayesha point
downward with it hand smile and vanish then i awok
horac i tell you that the sign ha come to us
hi voic di awai in the dark but i sat still brood over what
i had heard leo grope hi wai to me and seiz my arm shook it
ar you asleep he ask angrili speak man speak
no i answer never wa i more awak give me time
then i rose and go to the open window drew up the blind and stood
there stare at the sky which grew pearlhu with the first faint
ting of dawn leo came also and leant upon the windowsil and i could
feel that hi bodi wa trembl as though with cold clearli he wa
much move
you talk of a sign i said to him but in your sign i see noth but
a wild dream
it wa no dream he broke in fierc it wa a vision
a vision then if you will but there ar vision true and fals and
how can we know that thi is true listen leo what is there in all
that wonder tale which could not have been fashion in your own
brain distraught as it is almost to mad with your sorrow and your
long you dream that you were alon in the vast univers well is
not everi live creatur thu alon you dream that the shadowi shape
of ayesha came to you ha it ever left your side you dream that she
led you over sea and land past place haunt by your memori abov the
mysteri mountain of the unknown to an undiscov peak doe she
not thu lead you through life to that peak which li beyond the gate
of death you dream
oh no more of it he exclaim what i saw i saw and that i shall
follow think as you will horac and do what you will tomorrow i
start for india with you if you choos to come if not without you
you speak roughli leo i said you forget that i have had no sign
and that the nightmar of a man so near to insan that but a few hour
ago he wa determin upon suicid will be a poor staff to lean on when
we ar perish in the snow of central asia a mix vision thi of
your leo with it mountain peak shape like a cruxansata and the
rest do you suggest that ayesha is reincarn in central asiaa a
femal grand lama or someth of that sort
i never thought of it but why not ask leo quietli do you
rememb a certain scene in the cave of kor yonder when the live
look upon the dead and dead and live were the same and do you
rememb what ayesha swore that she would come againy to thi
world and how could that be except by rebirth or what is the same
thing by the transmigr of the spirit
i did not answer thi argument i wa struggl with myself
no sign ha come to me i said and yet i have had a part in the
plai humbl enough i admit and i believ that i have still a part
no he said no sign ha come to you i wish that it had oh how i
wish you could be convinc as i am horac
then we were silent for a long while silent with our ey fix upon
the sky
it wa a stormi dawn cloud in fantast mass hung upon the ocean
on of them wa like a great mountain and we watch it idli it
chang it shape the crest of it grew hollow like a crater from thi

chapter ii
the lamaseri
sixteen year had pass sinc that night vigil in the old cumberland
hous and behold we two leo and i were still travel still
search for that mountain peak shape like the symbol of life which
never never could be found
our adventur would fill volum but of what us is it to record them
mani of a similar natur ar alreadi written of in book those that we
endur were more prolong that is all five year we spent in thibet
for the most part as guest of variou monasteri where we studi the
law and tradit of the lama here we were onc sentenc to death in
punish for have visit a forbidden citi but escap through the
kind of a chines offici
leav thibet we wander east and west and north thousand and
thousand of mile sojourn amongst mani tribe in chines territori
and elsewher learn mani tongu endur much hardship thu we
would hear a legend of a place sai nine hundr mile awai and spend
two year in reach it to find when we came there noth
and so the time went on yet never onc did we think of give up the
quest and return sinc befor we start we had sworn an oath that
we would achiev or die inde we ought to have di a score of time
yet alwai were preserv most mysteri preserv
now we were in countri where so far as i could learn no european had
ever set a foot in a part of the vast land call turkestan there is a
great lake name balhkash of which we visit the shore two hundr
mile or so to the westward is a rang of mighti mountain mark on the
map as arkartytau on which we spent a year and five hundr or so to
the eastward ar other mountain call cherga whither we journei at
last have explor the tripl rang of the tau
here it wa that at last our true adventur began on on of the spur
of these aw cherga mountainsit is unmark on ani mapw wellnigh
perish of starvat the winter wa come on and we could find no
game the last travel we had met hundr of mile south told us
that on that rang wa a monasteri inhabit by lama of surpass
holi he said that thei dwelt in thi wild land over which no power
claim dominion and where no tribe live to acquir merit with no
other compani than that of their own piou contempl we did not
believ in it exist still we were search for that monasteri
driven onward by the blind fatal which wa our onli guid through
all these endless wander as we were starv and could find no
argal that is fuel with which to make a fire we walk all night by
the light of the moon drive between us a singl yakfor now we had
no attend the last have di a year befor
he wa a nobl beast that yak and had the best constitut of ani
anim i ever knew though now like hi master he wa near hi end
not that he wa overladen for a few rifl cartridg about a hundr
and fifti the remnant of a store which we had fortun been abl to
bui from a caravan two year befor some monei in gold and silver a
littl tea and a bundl of skin rug and sheepskin garment were hi
burden on on we trudg across a plateau of snow have the great
mountain on our right till at length the yak gave a sigh and stop
so we stop also becaus we must and wrap ourselv in the skin
rug sat down in the snow to wait for daylight
we shall have to kill him and eat hi flesh raw i said pat the
poor yak that lai patient at our side
perhap we mai find game in the morn answer leo still hope
and perhap we mai not in which case we must die
veri good he repli then let us die it is the last resourc of
failur we shall have done our best
certainli leo we shall have done our best if sixteen year of
tramp over mountain and through etern snow in pursuit of a dream
of the night can be call best
you know what i believ he answer stubbornli and there wa silenc
between us for here argument did not avail also even then i could not
think that all our toil and suffer would be in vain
the dawn came and by it light we look at on anoth anxious
each of us desir to see what strength wa left to hi companion wild
creatur we should have seem to the ey of ani civil person
leo wa now over forti year of ag and certainli hi matur had
fulfil the promis of hi youth for a more magnific man i never
knew veri tall although he seem spare to the ey hi girth match
hi height and those mani year of desert life had turn hi muscl
to steel hi hair had grown long like my own for it wa a protect
from sun and cold and hung upon hi neck a curl golden mane as
hi great beard hung upon hi breast spread outward almost to
the massiv shoulder the face toowhat could be seen of itwa
beauti though burnt brown with weather refin and full of thought
sombr almost and in it clear as crystal steadi as star shone hi
larg grei ey
and ii wa what i have alwai beenugli and hirsut irongrei now
also but in spite of my sixti odd year still wonderfulli strong for
my strength seem to increas with time and my health wa perfect in
fact dure all thi period of rough travel although now and again
we had met with accid which laid us up for awhil neither of us
had known a dai of sick hardship seem to have turn our
constitut to iron and made them impervi to everi human ailment
or wa thi becaus we alon amongst live men had onc inhal the
breath of the essenc of life
our fear relievedfor notwithstand our foodless night as yet
neither of us show ani sign of exhaustionw turn to contempl
the landscap at our feet beyond a littl belt of fertil soil began
a great desert of the sort with which we were familiarsandi
saltencrust treeless waterless and here and there streak with
the first snow of winter beyond it eighti or a hundr mile awayin
that lucent atmospher it wa imposs to sai how far exactlyros
more mountain a verit sea of them of which the white peak soar
upward by score
as the golden rai of the rise sun touch their snow to splendour
i saw leo ey becom troubl swiftli he turn and look along the
edg of the desert
see there he said point to someth dim and enorm present
the light reach it also it wa a mighti mountain not more than ten
mile awai that stood out by itself among the sand then he turn
onc more and with hi back to the desert stare at the slope of the
hill along the base of which we had been travel as yet thei were
in gloom for the sun wa behind them but present light began to flow
over their crest like a flood down it crept lower and yet lower
till it reach a littl plateau not three hundr yard abov us
there on the edg of the plateau look out solemnli across the
wast sat a great ruin idol a coloss buddha while to the rear of
the idol built of yellow stone appear the low crescentshap mass
of a monasteri
at last cri leo oh heaven at last and fling himself down
he buri hi face in the snow as though to hide it there lest i should
read someth written on it which he did not desir that even i should
see
i let him lie a space understand what wa pass in hi heart
and inde in mine also then go to the yak that poor brute had
no share in these joyou emot but onli low and look round with
hungri ey i pile the sheepskin rug on to it back thi done i
laid my hand on leo shoulder sai in the most matteroffact voic
i could commandcom if that place is not desert we mai find food
and shelter there and it is begin to storm again
he rose without a word brush the snow from hi beard and garment and
came to help me to lift the yak to it feet for the wornout beast wa
too stiff and weak to rise of itself glanc at him covertli i saw
on leo face a veri strang and happi look a great peac appear to
possess him
we plung upward through the snow slope drag the yak with us to
the terrac whereon the monasteri wa built nobodi seem to be about
there nor could i discern ani footprint wa the place but a ruin we
had found mani such inde thi ancient land is full of build that
had onc serv as the home of men learn and piou enough after
their own fashion who live and di hundr or even thousand of
year ago long befor our western civil came into be
my heart also my stomach which wa starv sank at the thought
but while i gaze doubtfulli a littl coil of blue smoke sprang from
a chimnei and never i think did i see a more joy sight in the
centr of the edific wa a larg build evid the templ but
nearer to us i saw a small door almost abov which the smoke appear
to thi door i went and knock call aloudopen open holi
lama stranger seek your chariti after awhil there wa a sound of
shuffl feet and the door creak upon it hing reveal an old
old man clad in tatter yellow garment
who is it who is it he exclaim blink at me through a pair of
horn spectacl who come to disturb our solitud the solitud of the
holi lama of the mountain
travel sacr on who have had enough of solitud i answer in
hi own dialect with which i wa well acquaint travel who ar
starv and who ask your chariti which i ad by the rule you
cannot refus
he stare at us through hi horn spectacl and abl to make noth
of our face let hi glanc fall to our garment which were as rag
as hi own and of much the same pattern inde thei were those of
thibetan monk includ a kind of quilt petticoat and an outer
vestment not unlik an eastern burnou we had adopt them becaus we
had no other also thei protect us from the rigour of the climat
and from remark had there been ani to remark upon them
ar you lama he ask doubtfulli and if so of what monasteri
lama sure enough i answer who belong to a monasteri call the
world where ala on grow hungri
the repli seem to pleas him for he chuckl a littl then shook hi
head sayingit is against our custom to admit stranger unless thei
be of our own faith which i am sure you ar not
and much more is it against your rule holi khubilghan for so these
abbot ar entitl to suffer stranger to starv and i quot a
wellknown passag from the sai of buddha which fit the point
precis
i perceiv that you ar instruct in the book he exclaim with
wonder on hi yellow wrinkl face and to such we cannot refus
shelter come in brethren of the monasteri call the world but stai
there is the yak who also ha claim upon our chariti and turn
he struck upon a gong or bell which hung within the door
at the sound anoth man appear more wrinkl and to all appear
older than the first who stare at us openmouth
brother said the abbot shut that great mouth of your lest an evil
spirit should fly down it take thi poor yak and give it fodder with
the other cattl
so we unstrap our belong from the back of the beast and the old
fellow whose grandiloqu titl wa master of the herd led it awai
when it had gone not too willinglyfor our faith friend dislik
part from us and distrust thi new guideth abbot who wa
name kouen led us into the live room or rather the kitchen of the
monasteri for it serv both purpos here we found the rest of the
monk about twelv in all gather round the fire of which we had seen
the smoke and engag on of them in prepar the morn meal and
the rest in warm themselv
thei were all old men the youngest could not have been less than
sixtyf to these we were solemnli introduc as brethren of the
monasteri call the world where folk grow hungri for the abbot
kouen could not make up hi mind to part from thi littl joke
thei stare at us thei rub their thin hand thei bow and wish
us well and evid were delight at our arriv thi wa not
strang howev see that our were the first new face which thei
had seen for four long year
nor did thei stop at word for while thei made water hot for us to wash
in two of them went to prepar a roomand other drew off our rough
hide boot and thick outer garment and brought us slipper for our
feet then thei led us to the guest chamber which thei inform us wa
a propiti place for onc it had been slept in by a note saint
here a fire wa lit and wonder of wonder clean garment includ
linen all of them ancient and fade but of good qualiti were brought
for us to put on
so we washedy actual wash all overand have arrai
ourselv in the robe which were somewhat small for leo struck the
bell that hung in the room and were conduct by a monk who answer it
back to the kitchen where the meal wa now serv it consist of a
kind of porridg to which wa ad new milk brought in by the master
of the herd dri fish from a lake and butter tea the last two
luxuri produc in our special honour never had food tast more
delici to us and i mai add never did we eat more inde at last
i wa oblig to request leo to stop for i saw the monk stare at him
and heard the old abbot chuckl to himself
oho the monasteri of the world where folk grow hungri to which
anoth monk who wa call the master of the provis repli
uneasili that if we went on like thi their store of food would
scarc last the winter so we finish at length feel as some
book of maxim which i can rememb in my youth said all polit peopl
should dothat we could eat more and much impress our host by
chant a long buddhist grace
their feet ar in the path their feet ar in the path thei said
astonish
ye repli leo thei have been in it for sixteen year of our
present incarn but we ar onli beginn for you holi on know
how starhigh how oceanwid and how desertlong is that path inde
it is to be instruct as to the right wai of walk therein that we
have been miracul direct by a dream to seek you out as the most
piou the most saintli and the most learn of all the lama in these
part
ye certainli we ar that answer the abbot kouen see that
there is no other monasteri within five month journei and again he
chuckl though ala he ad with a pathet littl sigh our
number grow few
after thi we ask leav to retir to our chamber in order to rest and
there upon veri good imit of bed we slept solidli for four and
twenti hour rise at last perfectli refresh and well
such wa our introduct to the monasteri of the mountainsfor it had
no other namewher we were destin to spend the next six month of
our live within a few daysfor thei were not long in give us their
complet confidencethos goodheart and simpl old monk told us all
their histori
it seem that of old time there wa a lamaseri here in which dwelt
sever hundr brethren thi inde wa obvious true for the
place wa enorm although for the most part ruin and as the
weatherworn statu of buddha show veri ancient the stori ran
accord to the old abbot that two centuri or so befor the monk
had been kill out by some fierc tribe who live beyond the desert and
across the distant mountain which tribe were heret and worshipp
of fire onli a few of them escap to bring the sad new to other
commun and for five gener no attempt wa made to reoccupi
the place
at length it wa reveal to him our friend kouen when a young man
that he wa a reincarn of on of the old monk of thi monasteri
who also wa name kouen and that it wa hi duti dure hi present
life to return thither as by so do he would win much merit and
receiv mani wonder revel so he gather a band of zealot
and with the bless and consent of hi superior thei start out
and after mani hardship and loss found and took possess of the
place repair it suffici for their need
thi happen about fifti year befor and here thei had dwelt ever
sinc onli commun occasion with the outsid world at first
their number were recruit from time to time by new brethren but
at length these ceas to come with the result that the commun wa
dy out
and what then i ask
and then the abbot answer noth we have acquir much merit
we have been blest with mani revel and after the repos we have
earn in devachan our lot in futur exist will be easier what
more can we ask or desir remov as we ar from all the temptat of
the world
for the rest in the interv of their endless prayer and still more
endless contempl thei were husbandmen cultiv the soil
which wa fertil at the foot of the mountain and tend their herd of
yak thu thei wore awai their blameless live until at last thei di
of old ag and as thei believedand who shall sai that thei were
wrongth etern round repeat itself elsewher
immedi after inde on the veri dai of our arriv at the
monasteri the winter began in earnest with bitter cold and snowstorm
so heavi and frequent that all the desert wa cover deep veri soon it
becam obviou to us that here we must stai until the spring sinc
to attempt to move in ani direct would be to perish with some
misgiv we explain thi to the abbot kouen offer to remov to
on of the empti room in the ruin part of the build support
ourselv with fish that we could catch by cut a hole in the ic of
the lake abov the monasteri and if we were abl to find ani on game
which we might trap or shoot in the scrublik forest of stunt pine
and junip that grew around it border but he would listen to no such
thing we had been sent to be their guest he said and their guest
we should remain for so long as might be conveni to us would we lai
upon them the burden of the sin of inhospit besid he remark
with hi chucklew who dwell alon like to hear about that other
great monasteri call the world where the monk ar not so favour as
we who ar set in thi bless situat and where folk even go hungri
in bodi and he ad in soul
inde as we soon found out the dear old man object wa to keep our
feet in the path until we reach the goal of truth or in other word
becam excel lama like himself and hi flock
so we walk in the path as we had done in mani anoth lamaseri
and assist at the long prayer in the ruin templ and studi the
kandjur or translat of the word of buddha which is their bibl
and a veri long on and gener show that our mind were open
also we expound to them the doctrin of our own faith and greatli
delight were thei to find so mani point of similar between it and
their inde i am not certain but that if we could have stop there
long enough sai ten year we might have persuad some of them to
accept a new revel of which we were the prophet further in spare
hour we told them mani tale of the monasteri call the world and
it wa realli delight and in a sens piteou to see the joi with
which thei listen to these stori of wondrou countri and new race
of men thei who knew onli of russia and china and some semisavag
tribe inhabit of the mountain and the desert
it is right for us to learn all thi thei declar for who know
perhap in futur incarn we mai becom inhabit of these
place
but though the time pass thu in comfort and inde compar to mani
of our experi in luxuri oh our heart were hungri for in them
burn the consum fire of our quest we felt that we were on the
thresholdy we knew it we knew it and yet our wretch physic
limit made it imposs for us to advanc by a singl step on
the desert beneath fell the snow moreov great wind aros suddenli
that drove those snow like dust pile them in heap as high as tree
beneath which ani unfortun travel would be buri here we must
wait there wa noth els to be done
on allevi we found and onli on in a ruin room of the
monasteri wa a librari of mani volum place there doubtless by the
monk who were massacr in time bygon these had been more or less
care for and rearrang by their successor who gave us liberti to
examin them as often as we pleas truli it wa a strang collect
and i should imagin of priceless valu for among them were to be found
buddhist sivaist and shamanist write that we had never befor
seen or heard of togeth with the live of a multitud of bodhisatva
or distinguish saint written in variou tongu some of which we
did not understand
what prove more interest to us howev wa a diari in mani tome
that for gener had been kept by the khubilghan or abbot of the
old lamaseri in which everi event of import wa record in great
detail turn over the page of on of the last volum of thi
diari written appar about two hundr and fifti year earlier and
shortli befor the destruct of the monasteri we came upon an
entri of which the followingfor i can onli quot from memoryi the
substanc
in the summer of thi year after a veri great sandstorm a brother
the name wa given but i forget it found in the desert a man of the
peopl who dwell beyond the far mountain of whom rumour have reach
thi lamaseri from time to time he wa live but besid him were the
bodi of two of hi companion who had been overwhelm by sand and
thirst he wa veri fierc look he refus to sai how he came into
the desert tell us onli that he had follow the road known to the
ancient befor commun between hi peopl and the outer world
ceas we gather howev that hi brethren with whom he fled had
commit some crime for which thei had been condemn to die and that
he had accompani them in their flight he told us that there wa a
fine countri beyond the mountain fertil but plagu with drought
and earthquak which latter inde we often feel here
the peopl of that countri were he said warlik and veri numer but
follow agricultur thei had alwai live there though rule by khan
who were descend of the greek king call alexand who conquer
much countri to the southwest of us thi mai be true as our record
tell us that about two thousand year ago an armi sent by that invad
penetr to these part though of hi be with them noth is
said
the strangerman told us also that hi peopl worship a priestess
call he or the hesea who is said to reign from gener to
gener she live in a great mountain apart and is fear and
ador by all but is not the queen of the countri in the govern
of which she seldom interfer to her howev sacrific ar offer
and he who incur her vengeanc di so that even the chief of that
land ar afraid of her still their subject often fight for thei hate
each other
we answer that he li when he said that thi woman wa immortalfor
that wa what we suppos he meantsinc noth is immort also we
laugh at hi tale of her power thi made the man veri angri inde
he declar that our buddha wa not so strong as thi priestess and
that she would show it by be aveng upon us
after thi we gave him food and turn him out of the lamaseri and he
went sai that when he return we should learn who spoke the truth
we do not know what becam of him and he refus to reveal to us the
road to hi countri which li beyond the desert and the far mountain
we think that perhap he wa an evil spirit sent to frighten us in
which he did not succe
such is a preci of thi strang entri the discoveri of which vagu
as it wa thrill us with hope and excit noth more appear
about the man or hi countri but within a littl over a year from that
date the diari of the abbot came to a sudden end without ani indic
that unusu event had occur or were expect
inde the last item written in the parchment book mention the
prepar of certain new land to be us for the sow of grain in
futur season which suggest that the brethren neither fear nor
expect disturb we wonder whether the man from beyond the
mountain wa as good as hi word and had brought down the vengeanc of
that priestess call the hesea upon the commun which shelter him
also we wonderedah how we wonderedwho and what thi hesea might be
on the dai follow thi discoveri we prai the abbot kouen to
accompani us to the librari and have read him the passag ask
if he knew anyth of the matter he swai hi wise old head which
alwai remind me of that of a tortois and answereda littl
veri littl and that mostli about the armi of the greek king who is
mention in the write
we inquir what he could possibl know of thi matter whereon kouen
repli calmlyin those dai when the faith of the holi on wa still
young i dwelt as a humbl brother in thi veri monasteri which wa
on of the first built and i saw the armi pass that is all that
he ad medit wa in my fiftieth incarn of thi present
roundno i am think of anoth armyin my seventythird
as student of their live and literatur will be awar
it is common for buddhist priest to state posit that
thei rememb event which occur dure their previou
incarnations
here leo began a great laugh but i manag to kick him beneath the
tabl and he turn it into a sneez thi wa fortun as such ribald
merriment would have hurt the old man feel terribl after all
also as leo himself had onc said sure we were not the peopl to
mock at the theori of reincarn which by the wai is the first
articl of faith among nearli on quarter of the human race and thi
not the most foolish quarter
how can that bei ask for instruct learn onese that memori
perish with death
ah he answer brother holli it mai seem to do so but oftentim
it come back again especi to those who ar far advanc upon the
path for instanc until you read thi passag i had forgotten all
about that armi but now i see it pass pass and myself with
other monk stand by the statu of the big buddha in front yonder
and watch it go by it wa not a veri larg armi for most of the
soldier had di or been kill and it wa be pursu by the wild
peopl who live south of us in those dai so that it wa in a great
hurri to put the desert between it and them the gener of the armi wa
a swarthi mani wish that i could rememb hi name but i cannot
well he went on that gener came up to the lamaseri and demand a
sleep place for hi wife and children also provis and medicin
and guid across the desert the abbot of that dai told him it wa
against our law to admit a woman under our roof to which he answer
that if we did not we should have no roof left for he would burn the
place and kill everi on of us with the sword now as you know to be
kill by violenc mean that we must pass sundri incarn in the
form of anim a horribl thing so we chose the lesser evil and
gave wai and afterward obtain absolut for our sin from the great
lama myself i did not see thi queen but i saw the priestess of their
worshipala ala and kouen beat hi breast
why ala i ask as unconcernedli as i could for thi stori
interest me strang
why oh becaus i mai have forgotten the armi but i have never
forgotten that priestess and she ha been a great hindranc to me
through mani ag delai me upon my journei to the other side to the
shore of salvat i as a humbl lama wa engag in prepar her
apart when she enter and threw asid her veil ye and perceiv
a young man spoke to me ask mani question and even if i wa not
glad to look again upon a woman
whatwhat wa she like said leo anxious
what wa she like oh she wa all loveli in on shape she wa
like the dawn upon the snow she wa like the even star abov the
mountain she wa like the first flower of the spring brother ask me
not what she wa like nai i will sai no more oh my sin my sin i am
slip backward and you draw my black shame out into the light of dai
nai i will confess it that you mai know how vile a thing i ami whom
perhap you have thought holylik yourselv that woman if woman
she were lit a fire in my heart which will not burn out oh and more
more and kouen rock himself to and fro upon hi stool while tear
of contrit trickl from beneath hi horn spectacl she made me
worship her for first she ask me of my faith and listen eagerli as
i expound it hope that the light would come into her heart then
after i had finish she saidso your path is renunci and your
nirvana a most excel nothing which some would think it scarc
worth while to strive so hard to reach now i will show you a more
joyou wai and a goddess more worthi of your worship
what wai and what goddess i ask of her
the wai of love and life she answer that make all the world
to be that made you o seeker of nirvana and the goddess call
natur
again i ask where is that goddess and behold she drew herself up
look most royal and touch her ivori breast she said i am she
now kneel you down and do me homag
my brethren i knelt ye i kiss her foot and then i fled awai
shame and brokenheart and as i went she laugh and cri
rememb me when you reach devachan o servant of the buddasaint for
though i chang i do not die and even there i shall be with you who
onc gave me worship
and it is so my brethren it is so for though i obtain absolut
for my sin and have suffer much for it through thi my next
incarn yet i cannot be rid of her and for me the utter peac is
far far awai and kouen place hi wither hand befor hi face and
sob outright
a ridicul sight truli to see a holi khublighan well on the wrong
side of eighti weep like a child over a dream of a beauti woman
which he imagin he had onc dreamt in hi last life more than two
thousand year ago so the reader will sai but i holli for reason
of my own felt deep sympathi with that poor old man and leo wa also
sympathet we pat him on the back we assur him that he wa
the victim of some evil hallucin which could never be brought up
against him in thi or ani futur exist sinc if sin there were
it must have been forgiven long ago and so forth when hi calm wa
somewhat restor we tri also to extract further inform from him
but with poor result so far as the priestess wa concern
he said that he did not know to what religion she belong and did not
care but thought that it must be an evil on she went awai the next
morn with the armi and he never saw or heard of her ani more though
it came into hi mind that he wa oblig to be lock in hi cell for
eight dai to prevent himself from follow her ye he had heard on
thing for the abbot of that dai had told the brethren thi priestess
wa the real gener of the armi not the king or the queen the latter
of whom hate her it wa by her will that thei push on northward
across the desert to some countri beyond the mountain where she
desir to establish herself and her worship
we ask if there realli wa ani countri beyond the mountain and
kouen answer wearili that he believ so either in thi or in a
previou life he had heard that peopl live there who worship fire
certainli also it wa true that about thirti year ago a brother who had
climb the great peak yonder to spend some dai in solitari medit
return and report that he had seen a marvel thing name a
shaft of fire burn in the heaven beyond those same mountain though
whether thi were a vision or what he could not sai he recal
howev that about that time thei had felt a great earthquak
then the memori of that fanci transgress again began to afflict
kouen innoc old heart and he crept awai lament and wa seen no
more for a week nor would he ever speak again to us of thi matter
but we spoke of it much with hope and wonder and made up our mind that
we would at onc ascend thi mountain
chapter iii
the beacon light
a week later came our opportun of make thi ascent of the mountain
for now in midwint it ceas storm and hard frost set in which
made it possibl to walk upon the surfac of the snow learn from
the monk that at thi season ovi poli and other kind of bighorn
sheep and game descend from the hill to take refug in certain
vallei where thei scrape awai the snow to find food we announc
that we were go out to hunt the excus we gave wa that we were
suffer from confin and need exercis have by the teach
of our religion no scrupl about kill game
our host repli that the adventur wa danger as the weather might
chang at ani moment thei told us howev that on the slope of thi
veri mountain which we desir to climb there wa a larg natur cave
where if need be we could take shelter and to thi cave on of them
somewhat younger and more activ than the rest offer to guid us so
have manufactur a rougri tent from skin and laden our old yak now
in the best of condit with food and garment on on still morn
we start as soon as it wa light under the guidanc of the monk who
notwithstand hi year walk veri well we reach the northern
slope of the peak befor middai here as he had said we found a great
cave of which the open wa protect by an overhang ledg of
rock evid thi cave wa the favourit place of shelter for game at
certain season of the year sinc in it were heap vast accumul
of their drop which remov ani fear of a lack of fuel
the rest of that short dai we spent in set up our tent in the cave
in front of which we lit a larg fire and in a survei of the slope of
the mountain for we told the monk that we were search for the track
of wild sheep inde as it happen on our wai back to the cave we
came across a small herd of ew feed upon the moss in a shelter
spot where in summer a streamlet ran of these we were so fortun as
to kill two for no sportsman had ever come here and thei were tame
enough poor thing as meat would keep for ever in that temperatur
we had now suffici food to last us for a fortnight and drag the
anim down the snow slope to the cave we skin them by the dy
light
that even we sup upon fresh mutton a great luxuri which the
monk enjoi as much as we did sinc whatev might be hi view as to
take life he like mutton then we turn into the tent and huddl
ourselv togeth for warmth as the temperatur must have been some
degre below zero the old monk rest well enough but neither leo nor
i slept over much for wonder as to what we might see from the top of
that mountain banish sleep
next morn at the dawn the weather be still favour our
companion return to the monasteri whither we said we would follow him
in a dai or two
now at last we were alon and without wast an instant began our
ascent of the peak it wa mani thousand feet high and in certain place
steep enough but the deep frozen snow made climb easi so that by
middai we reach the top henc the view wa magnific beneath
us stretch the desert and beyond it a broad belt of fantast
shape snowclad mountain hundr and hundr of them in front to
the right to the left as far as the ey could reach
thei ar just as i saw them in my dream so mani year ago mutter
leo the same the veri same
and where wa the fieri light i ask
yonder i think and he point north by east
well it is not there now i answer and thi place is cold
so sinc it wa danger to linger lest the dark should overtak
us on our return journei we descend the peak again reach the cave
about sunset the next four dai we spent in the same wai everi morn
we crawl up those wearisom bank of snow and everi afternoon we
slid and toboggan down them again till i grew heartili tire of the
exercis
on the fourth night instead of come to sleep in the tent leo sat
himself down at the entranc to the cave i ask him why he did thi
but he answer impati becaus he wish it so i left him alon
i could see inde that he wa in a strang and irrit mood for
the failur of our search oppress him moreov we knew both of us
that it could not be much prolong sinc the weather might break at
ani moment when ascent of the mountain would becom imposs
in the middl of the night i wa awaken by leo shake me and
sayingcom here horac i have someth to show you
reluctantli enough i crept from between the rug and out of the tent to
dress there wa no need for we slept in all our garment he led me
to the mouth of the cave and point northward i look the night wa
veri dark but far far awai appear a faint patch of light upon the
sky such as might be caus by the reflect of a distant fire
what do you make of it he ask anxious
noth in particular i answer it mai be anyth the moonno
there is none dawnno it is too northerli and it doe not break for
three hour someth burn a hous or a funer pyre but how can
there be such thing here i give it up
i think it is a reflect and that if we were on the peak we should
see the light which throw it said leo slowli
ye but we ar not and cannot get there in the dark
then horac we must spend a night there
it will be our last in thi incarn i answer with a laugh
that is if it come on to snow
we must risk it or i will risk it look the light ha fade and
there at least he wa right for undoubtedli it had the night wa as
black as pitch
let talk it over tomorrow i said and went back to the tent for i
wa sleepi and incredul but leo sat on by the mouth of the cave
at dawn i awok and found breakfast alreadi cook
i must start earli leo explain
ar you mad i ask how can we camp on that place
i dont know but i am go i must go horac
which mean that we both must go but how about the yak
where we can climb it can follow he answer
so we strap the tent and other baggag includ a good suppli of
cook meat upon the beast back and start the tramp wa long
sinc we were oblig to make some detour to avoid slope of frozen
snow in which on our previou ascent we had cut foothold with an
ax for up these the laden anim could not clamber reach the
summit at length we dug a hole and there pitch the tent pile the
excav snow about it side by thi time it began to grow dark and
have descend into the tent yak and all we at our food and wait
oh what cold wa that the frost wa fear and at thi height a wind
blew whose ici breath pass through all our wrap and seem to
burn our flesh beneath as though with hot iron it wa fortun that
we had brought the yak for without the warmth from it shaggi bodi i
believ that we should have perish even in our tent for some hour
we watch as inde we must sinc to sleep might mean to die yet saw
noth save the lone star and heard noth in that aw silenc
for here even the wind made no nois as it slid across the snow
accustom as i wa to such exposur my faculti began to grow numb
and my ey to shut when suddenli leo saidlook below the red star
i look and there high in the sky wa the same curiou glow which we
had seen upon the previou night there wa more than thi inde for
beneath it almost on a line with us and just abov the crest of the
interven peak appear a faint sheet of fire and reveal against
it someth black whilst we watch the fire widen spread upward
and grew in power and intens now against it flame background the
black object becam clearli visibl and lo it wa the top of a soar
pillar surmount by a loop ye we could see it everi outlin it wa
the crux ansata the symbol of life itself
the symbol vanish the fire sank again it blaze up more fierc
than befor and the loop appear afresh then onc more disappear
a third time the fire shone and with such intens that no lightn
could surpass it brillianc all around the heaven were lit up and
through the black needleshap ey of the symbol as from the flare of
a beacon or the searchlight of a ship on fierc rai shot across the
sea of mountain top and the space of the desert straight as an arrow
to the lofti peak on which we lai ye it lit upon the snow stain
it red and upon the wild white face of us who watch though to the
right and left of us spread thick dark my compass lai befor me on
the snow and i could even see it needl and beyond us the shape of
a white fox that had crept near scent food then it wa gone as
swiftli as it came gone too were the symbol and the veil of flame
behind it onli the glow linger a littl on the distant sky
for awhil there wa silenc between us then leo saiddo you
rememb horac when we lai upon the rock stone where her
cloak fell upon me as he said the word the breath caught in hi
throathow the rai of light wa sent to us in farewel and to show us
a path of escap from the place of death now i think that it ha been
sent again in greet to point out the path to the place of life where
ayesha dwell whom we have lost awhil
it mai be so i answer shortli for the matter wa beyond speech
or argument beyond wonder even but i knew then as i know now that
we were player in some mighti predestin drama that our part were
written and we must speak them as our path wa prepar and we must
tread it to the end unknown fear and doubt were left behind hope wa
sunk in certainti the foreshadow vision of the night had found an
actual fulfil and the piti seed of the promis of her who di
grow unseen through all the cruel empti year had come to harvest
no we fear no more not even when with the dawn rose the roar
wind through which we struggl down the mountain slope as it would
seem in peril of our live at everi step not even as hour by hour we
fought our wai onward through the whirl snowstorm that made us
deaf and blind for we knew that those live were charm we could not
see or hear yet we were led cling to the yak we struggl downward
and homeward till at length out of the turmoil and the gloom it
instinct brought us unharm to the door of the monasteri where the old
abbot embrac us in hi joi and the monk put up prayer of thank
for thei were sure that we must be dead through such a storm thei
said no man had ever live befor
it wa still midwint and oh the aw weari of those month of
wait in our hand wa the kei yonder amongst those mountain lai
the door but not yet might we set that kei within it lock for between
us and these stretch the great desert where the snow roll like
billow and until that snow melt we dare not attempt it passag so
we sat in the monasteri and school our heart to patienc
still even to these frozen wild of central asia spring come at last
on even the air felt warm and that night there were onli a few
degre of frost the next the cloud bank up and in the morn
not snow wa fall from them but rain and we found the old monk
prepar their instrument of husbandri as thei said that the season
of sow wa at hand for three dai it rain while the snow melt
befor our ey on the fourth torrent of water were rush down the
mountain and the desert wa onc more brown and bare though not for
long for within anoth week it wa carpet with flower then we knew
that the time had come to start
but whither go you whither go you ask the old abbot in dismai
ar you not happi here do you not make great stride along the path
as mai be known by your piou convers is not everyth that we
have your own oh why would you leav us
we ar wander we answer and when we see mountain in front of
us we must cross them
kouen look at us shrewdli then askedwhat do you seek beyond the
mountain and my brethren what merit is gather by hide the truth
from an old man for such conceal ar separ from falsehood but
by the length of a singl barleycorn tell me that at least my prayer
mai accompani you
holi abbot i said awhil ago yonder in the librari you made a
certain confess to us
oh remind me not of it he said hold up hi hand why do you
wish to torment me
far be the thought from us most kind friend and virtuou man i
answer but as it chanc your stori is veri much our own and we
think that we have experi of thi same priestess
speak on he said much interest
so i told him the outlin of our tale for an hour or more i told it
while he sat opposit to us swai hi head like a tortois and sai
noth at length it wa done
now i ad let the lamp of your wisdom shine upon our dark do
you not find thi stori wondrou or do you perchanc think that we ar
liar
brethren of the great monasteri call the world kouen answer
with hi customari chuckl why should i think you liar who from the
moment my ey fell upon you knew you to be true men moreov why
should i hold thi tale so veri wondrou you have but stumbl upon
the fring of a truth with which we have been acquaint for mani mani
ag
becaus in a vision she show you thi monasteri and led you to a
spot beyond the mountain where she vanish you hope that thi woman
whom you saw die is reincarn yonder why not in thi there is
noth imposs to those who ar instruct in the truth though the
lengthen of her last life wa strang and contrari to experi
doubtless you will find her there as you expect and doubtless her
khama or ident is the same as that which in some earlier life of
her onc brought me to sin
onli be not mistaken she is no immort noth is immort she is
but a be held back by her own pride her own great if you will
upon the path toward nirvana that pride will be humbl as alreadi it
ha been humbl that brow of majesti shall be sprinkl with the dust
of chang and death that sin spirit must be purifi by sorrow and
by separ brother leo if you win her it will be but to lose and
then the ladder must be reclimb brother holli for you as for me loss
is our onli gain sinc therebi we ar spare much woe oh bide here
and prai with me why dash yourselv against a rock why labour to pour
water into a broken jar whenc it must sink into the sand of profitless
experi and there be wast whilst you remain athirst
water make the sand fertil i answer where water fall life
come and sorrow is the seed of joi
love is the law of life broke in leo without love there is no
life i seek love that i mai live i believ that all these thing ar
ordain to an end which we do not know fate draw me oni fulfil my
fate
and do but delai your freedom yet i will not argu with you brother
who must follow your own road see now what ha thi woman thi
priestess of a fals faith if she be so still brought you in the past
onc in anoth life or so i understand your stori you were sworn to
a certain naturegoddess who wa name isi were you not and to her
alon then a woman tempt you and you fled with her afar and there
what found you the betrai and aveng goddess who slew you or if
not the goddess on who had drunk of her wisdom and wa the minist
of her vengeanc have that wisdom thi ministerwoman or evil
spiritrefus to die becaus she had learn to love you but wait
know that in your next life she would find you again as inde she
would have done more swiftli in devachan had she di without live on
alon in so much miseri and she found you and she di or seem to
die and now she is reborn as she must be and doubtless you will
meet onc more and again there must come miseri oh my friend go not
across the mountain bide here with me and lament your sin
nai answer leo we ar sworn to a tryst and we do not break our
word
then brethren go keep your tryst and when you have reap it
harvest think upon my sai for i am sure that the wine you crush
from the vintag of your desir will run red like blood and that in it
drink you shall find neither forget nor peac made blind by
a passion of which well i know the sting and power you seek to add a
fairfac evil to your live think that from thi uniti there shall
be born all knowledg and great joi
rather should you desir to live alon in holi until at length your
separ live ar merg and lost in the good unspeak the etern
bliss that li in the last nothing ah you do not believ me now
you shake your head and smile yet a dai will dawn it mai be after
mani incarn when you shall bow them in the dust and weep sai
to me brother kouen your were the word of wisdom our the deed
of foolish and with a deep sigh the old man turn and left us
a cheer faith truli said leo look after him to dwell
through aeon in monoton miseri in order that conscious mai be
swallow up at last in some void and formless abstract call the
utter peac i would rather take my share of a bad world and keep my
hope of a better also i do not think that he know anyth of ayesha
and her destini
so would i i answer though perhap he is right after all who can
tell moreov what is the us of reason leo we have no choic
we follow our fate to what that fate mai lead us we shall learn in due
season
then we went to rest for it wa late though i found littl sleep that
night the warn of the ancient abbot good and learn man as he
wa full also of ripe experi and of the foresight wisdom that
is given to such as he oppress me deepli he promis us sorrow and
bloodsh beyond the mountain end in death and rebirth full of
miseri well it might be so but no approach suffer could stai
our feet and even if thei could thei should not sinc to see her face
again i wa readi to brave them all and if thi wa my case what must
be that of leo
a strang theori that of kouen that ayesha wa the goddess in
old egypt to whom kallikr wa priest or at the least her
repres that the royal amenarta with whom he fled seduc him
from the goddess to whom he wa sworn that thi goddess incarn
in ayeshaor us the woman ayesha and her passion as her
instrumentswa aveng upon them both at kor and that there in an
after ag the bolt she shot fell back upon her own head
well i had often thought as much myself onli i wa sure that she
herself could be no actual divin though she might be a manifest
of on a priestess a messeng charg to work it will to aveng or
to reward and yet herself a human soul with hope and passion to be
satisfi and a destini to fulfil in truth write now when all is
past and done with i find much to confirm me in and littl to turn me
from that theori sinc life and power of a qualiti which ar more than
human do not alon suffic to make a soul divin on the other hand
howev it must be born in mind that on on occas at ani rate
ayesha did undoubtedli suggest that in the begin she wa a daughter
of heaven and that there were other notabl the old shaman simbri
who seem to take it for grant that her origin wa supernatur but
of all these thing i hope to speak in their season
meanwhil what lai beyond the mountain should we find her there who
held the sceptr and upon earth wield the power of the outrag isi
and with her that other woman who wrought the wrong and if so would
the dread inhuman struggl reach it climax around the person of the
sin priest in a few month a few dai even we might begin to know
thrill by thi thought at length i fell asleep
chapter iv
the avalanch
on the morn of the second dai from that night the sunris found us
alreadi on our path across the desert there nearli a mile behind us
we could see the ruin statu of buddha seat in front of the ancient
monasteri and in that clear atmospher could even distinguish the bent
form of our friend the old abbot kouen lean against it until we
were quit lost to sight all the monk had wept when we part from
them and kouen even more bitterli than the rest for he had learn to
love us
i am griev he said much griev which inde i should not be
for such emot partak of sin yet i find comfort for i know well
that although i must soon leav thi present life yet we shall meet
again in mani futur incarn and after you have put awai these
folli togeth tread the path to perfect peac now take with you my
bless and my prayer and begon forget not that should you live
to returnand he shook hi head doubtfullyher you will be ever
welcom
so we embrac him and went sorrowfulli
it will be rememb that when the mysteri light fell upon us on the
peak i had my compass with me and wa abl roughli to take it bear
for lack of ani better guid we now follow these bear travel
almost due northeast for in that direct had shone the fire all
dai in the most beauti weather we march across the flowerstrewn
desert see noth except bunch of game and on or two herd of
wild ass which had come down from the mountain to feed upon the new
grass as even approach we shot an antelop and made our campfor
we had brought the yak and a tent with usamong some tamarisk scrub of
which the dry stem furnish us with fuel nor did we lack for water
sinc by scrape in the sand soak with melt snow we found plenti
of fair qualiti so that night we sup in luxuri upon tea and antelop
meat which inde we were glad to have as it spare our littl store
of dri provis
the next morn we ascertain our posit as well as we could and
estim that we had cross about a quarter of the desert a guess
which prove veri accur for on the even of the fourth dai of our
journei we reach the bottom slope of the oppos mountain without
have experienc either accid or fatigu as leo said thing were
go like clockwork but i remind him that a good start often meant
a bad finish nor wa i wrong for now came our hardship to begin
with the mountain prove to be exceed high it took us two dai
to climb their lower slope also the heat of the sun had soften the
snow which made walk through it labori whilst accustom
though we were to such condit through long year of travel it
continu glitter affect our ey
the morn of the seventh dai found us in the mouth of a defil which
wound awai into the heart of the mountain as it seem the onli
possibl path we follow it and were much cheer to discov that
here must onc have run a road not that we could see ani road inde
for everyth wa buri in snow but that on lai beneath our feet we
were certain sinc although we march along the edg of precipic
our path howev steep wa alwai flat moreov the rock upon on
side of it had often been scarp by the hand of man of thi there
could be no doubt for as the snow did not cling here we saw the tool
mark upon it bare surfac
also we came to sever place where galleri had been built out from
the mountain side by mean of beam let into it as is still a common
practic in thibet these beam of cours had long sinc rot awai
leav a gulf between us and the continu of the path when we met
with such gap we were forc to go back and make a detour round or over
some mountain but although much delai therebi as it happen we
alwai manag to regain the road if not without difficulti and danger
what tri us morefor here our skill and experi as mountain
could not help uswa the cold at night oblig as we were to camp
in the sever frost at a great altitud and to endur through the long
hour of dark penetr and ici wind which sough ceaselessli
down the pass
at length on the tenth dai we reach the end of the defil and as
night wa fall camp there in the most bitter cold those were
miser hour for now we had no fuel with which to boil water and
must satisfi our thirst by eat frozen snow while our ey smart
so sore that we could not sleep and notwithstand all our wrap and
the warmth that we gather from the yak in the littl tent the cold
caus our teeth to chatter like castanet
the dawn came and after it the sunris we crept from the tent and
leav it stand awhil drag our stiffen limb a hundr yard
or so to a spot where the defil took a turn in order that we might
thaw in the rai of the sun which at that hour could not reach us where
we had camp
leo wa round it first and i heard him utter an exclam in a few
second i reach hi side and lo befor us lai our promis land
far beneath us ten thousand feet at leastfor it must be rememb
that we view it from the top of a mountainit stretch awai and awai
till it distanc met the horizon in charact it wa quit flat an
alluvi plain that probabl in some primev ag had been the bottom
of on of the vast lake of which a number exist in central asia most
of them now in process of desicc on object onli reliev thi
dreari flat a singl snowclad and gigant mountain of which
even at that distancefor it wa veri far from usw could clearli see
the outlin inde we could see more for from it round crest rose a
great plume of smoke show that it wa an activ volcano and on the
hither lip of the crater an enorm pillar of rock whereof the top wa
form to the shape of a loop
ye there it stood befor us that symbol of our vision which we had
sought these mani year and at the sight of it our heart beat fast and
our breath came quickli we note at onc that although we had not seen
it dure our passag of the mountain sinc the peak ahead and the
rocki side of the defil hid it from view so great wa it height that
it overtop the tallest of them thi made it clear to us how it came
to be possibl that the rai of light pass through the loop could fall
upon the highest snow of that tower pinnacl which we had climb
upon the further side of the desert
also now we were certain of the caus of that rai for the smoke behind
the loop explain thi mysteri doubtless at time when the volcano
wa awak that smoke must be replac by flame emit light of
fear intens and thi light it wa that reach us concentr
and direct by the loop
for the rest we thought that about thirti mile awai we could make out a
whiteroof town set upon a mound situat among tree upon the bank
of a wide river which flow across the plain also it wa evid that
thi countri had a larg popul who cultiv the soil for by
the aid of a pair of field glass on of our few remain and most
cherish possess we could see the green of spring crop pierc
by irrig canal and the line of tree that mark the limit of
the field
ye there befor us stretch the promis land and there rose the
mystic mount so that all we had to do wa to march down the snow slope
and enter it where we would
thu we thought in our folli littl guess what lai befor us what
terror and weari suffer we must endur befor we stood at length
beneath the shadow of the symbol of life
our fatigu forgotten we return to the tent hastili swallow some
of our dri food which we wash down with lump of snow that gave us
toothach and chill us insid but which thirst compel us to eat
drag the poor yak to it feet load it up and start
all thi while so great wa our hast and so occupi were each of
us with our own thought that if my memori serv me we scarc
interchang a word down the snow slope we march swiftli and without
hesit for here the road wa mark for us by mean of pillar of
rock set opposit to on anoth at interv these pillar we observ
with satisfact for thei told us that we were still upon a highwai
which led to the promis land
yet as we could not help note it wa on which seem to have gone
out of us sinc with the except of a few wildsheep track and the
spoor of some bear and mountain fox not a singl sign of beast or
man could we discov thi howev wa to be explain we reflect
by the fact that doubtless the road wa onli us in the summer season
or perhap the inhabit of the countri were now stayathom peopl
who never travel it at all
those slope were longer than we thought inde when dark close
in we had not reach the foot of them so we were oblig to spend
anoth night in the snow pitch our tent in the shelter of
an overhang rock as we had descend mani thousand feet the
temperatur prove fortun a littl milder inde i do not
think that there were more than eighteen or twenti degre of frost that
night also here and there the heat of the sun had melt the snow in
seclud place so that we were abl to find water to drink while the
yak could fill it poor old stomach with deadlook mountain moss
which it seem to think better than noth
again the still dawn came throw it red garment over the lonesom
endless mountain and we drag ourselv to our numb feet at some
of our remain food and start onward now we could no longer see
the countri beneath for it and even the tower volcano were hidden
from us by an interven ridg that seem to be pierc by a singl
narrow gullei toward which we head inde as the pillar show
us thither ran the buri road by middai it appear quit close to
us and we tramp on in feverish hast as it chanc howev there
wa no need to hurri for an hour later we learn the truth
between us and the mouth of the gullei rose or rather sank a sheer
precipic that wa appar three or four hundr feet in depth and
at it foot we could hear the sound of water
right to the edg of thi precipic ran the path for on of the stone
pillar stood upon it extrem brink and yet how could a road descend
such a place as that we stare aghast then a possibl solut
occur to us
dont you see said leo with a hollow laugh the gulf ha open
sinc thi track wa us volcan action probabl
perhap or perhap there wa a wooden bridg or stairwai which ha
rot it doe not matter we must find anoth path that is all i
answer as cheerfulli as i could
ye and soon he said if we do not wish to stop here for ever
so we turn to the right and march along the edg of the precipic
till a mile or so awai we came to a small glacier of which the
surfac wa sprinkl with larg stone frozen into it substanc thi
glacier hung down the face of the cliff like a petrifi waterfal but
whether or no it reach the foot we could not discov at ani rate
to think of attempt it descent seem out of the question from thi
point onward we could see that the precipic increas in depth and far
as the ey could reach wa absolut sheer
so we went back again and search to the left of our road here the
mountain reced so that abov us rose a mighti dazzl slope of
snow and below us lai that same pitiless unclimb gulf as the light
began to fade we perceiv half a mile or more in front a baretop
hillock of rock which stood on the verg of the precipic and hurri
to it think that from it crest we might be abl to discov a wai
of descent
when at length we had struggl to the top it wa about a hundr and
fifti feet high what we did discov wa that here also as beyond the
glacier the gulf wa infinit deeper than at the spot where the road
end so deep inde that we could not see it bottom although from it
came the sound of roar water moreov it wa quit half a mile in
width
whilst we stare round us the sink sun vanish behind a mountain
and the sky be heavi the light went out like that of a candl now
the ascent of thi hillock had prove so steep especi at on place
where we were oblig to climb a sort of rock ladder that we scarc
care to attempt to struggl down it again in that gloom therefor
rememb that there wa littl to choos between the top of thi
knoll and the snow plain at it foot in the matter of temperatur or
other conveni and be quit exhaust we determin to spend
the night upon it therebi as we were to learn save our live
unload the yak we pitch our tent under the lee of the topmost knob
of rock and at a coupl of hand of dri fish and corncak thi
wa the last of the food that we had brought with us from the lamaseri
and we reflect with dismai that unless we could shoot someth our
commissariat wa now repres by the carcass of our old friend the
yak then we wrap ourselv up in our thick rug and fur garment and
forgot our miseri in sleep
it cannot have been long befor daylight when we were awaken by a
sudden and terrif sound like the boom of a great cannon follow by
thousand of other sound which might be compar to the fusillad of
musketri
great heaven what is that i said
we crawl from the tent but as yet could see noth whilst the yak
began to low in a terrifi manner but if we could not see we could
hear and feel the boom and crack had ceas and wa follow by
a soft grind nois the most sicken sound i think to which
i ever listen thi wa accompani by a strang steadi unnatur
wind which seem to press upon us as water press then the dawn
broke and we saw
the mountainsid wa move down upon us in a vast avalanch of snow
oh what a sight wa that on from the crest of the precipit slope
abov two mile and more awai it came a live thing roll
slide glide pile itself in long leap wave hollow itself
into cavern vallei like a tempestdriven sea whilst abov it
surfac hung a powderi cloud of frozen sprai
as we watch cling to each other terrifi the first of these
wave struck our hill caus the mighti mass of solid rock to quiver
like a yacht beneath the impact of an ocean roller or an aspen in
a sudden rush of wind it struck and slowli separ then with a
majest motion flow like water over the edg of the precipic on
either side and fell with a thud sound into the unmeasur depth
beneath and thi wa but a littl thing a mere forerunn for after
it with a slow serpentin movement roll the bodi of the avalanch
it came in comber it came in level flood it pile itself against our
hill ye to within fifti feet of the head of it till we thought that
even that root rock must be torn from it foundat and hurl like
a pebbl to the deep beneath and the turmoil of it all the scream
of the blast caus by the compress of the air the dull continu
thud of the fall of million of ton of snow as thei rush through
space and end their journei in the gulf
nor wa thi the worst of it for as the deep snow abov thin great
boulder that had been buri beneath them perhap for centuri were
loosen from their restingplac and began to thunder down the hill
at first thei move slowli throw up the hard snow around them as the
prow of a ship throw foam then gather momentum thei sprang into
the air with leap such as those of shell ricochet upon water till
in the end sing and hurtl mani of them rush past and even over
us to vanish far beyond some inde struck our littl mountain with the
forc of shot fire from the great gun of a battleship and shatter
there or if thei fell upon it side tore awai ton of rock and pass
with them into the chasm like a meteor surround by it satellit
inde no bombard devis and direct by man could have been half
so terribl or had there been anyth to destroi half so destruct
the scene wa appal in it unchain and resistless might evolv
suddenli from the completest calm there in the lap of the quiet
mountain look down upon by the peac tender sky the power
hidden in the breast of natur were suddenli set free and companion
by whirlwind and all the terrifi majesti of sound loos upon the
head of us two human atom
at the first rush of snow we had leapt back behind our protect peak
and ly at full length upon the ground grip it and clung there
fear lest the wind should whirl us to the abyss long ago our tent
had gone like a dead leaf in an autumn gale and at time it seem as
if we must follow
the boulder hurtl over and past us on of them fell full upon the
littl peak shatter it crest and burst into fragment which
fled awai each sing it own wild song we were not touch but
when we look behind us it wa to see the yak which had risen in it
terror ly dead and headless then in our fear we lai still wait
for the end and wonder dimli whether we should be buri in the
surg snow or swept awai with the hill or crush by the fly
rock or lift and lost in the hurrican
how long did it last we never knew it mai have been ten minut or
two hour for in such a scene time lose it proport onli we becam
awar that the wind had fallen while the nois of grind snow and
hurtl boulder ceas veri cautious we gain our feet and look
in front of us wa sheer mountain side for a depth of over two mile
the width of about a thousand yard which had been cover with mani
feet of snow wa now bare rock pile up against the face of our hill
almost to it summit lai a tongu of snow press to the consist
of ic and spot with boulder that had lodg there the peak itself
wa torn and shatter so that it reveal great gleam surfac
and pit in which glitter mica or some other miner the vast gulf
behind wa half fill with the avalanch and it debri but for
the rest it seem as though noth had happen for the sun shone
sweetli overhead and the solemn snow reflect it rai from the side
of a hundr hill and we had endur it all and were still aliv ye
and unhurt
but what a posit wa our we dare not attempt to descend the mount
lest we should sink into the loos snow and be buri there moreov
all along the breadth of the path of the avalanch boulder from time to
time still thunder down the rocki slope and with them came patch of
snow that had been left behind by the big slide small in themselv
it is true but each of them larg enough to kill a hundr men it
wa obviou therefor that until these condit chang or death
releas us we must abid where we were upon the crest of the hillock
so there we sat foodless and frighten wonder what our old friend
kouen would sai if he could see us now by degre hunger master all
our other sensat and we began to turn long ey upon the headless
bodi of the yak
let skin him said leo it will be someth to do and we shall
want hi hide tonight
so with affect and even rever we perform thi offic for the
dead companion of our journei rejoic the while that it wa not
we who had brought him to hi end inde long resid among peopl
who believ fulli that the soul of men could pass into or were risen
from the bodi of anim had made us a littl superstiti on thi
matter it would be scarc pleasant we reflect in some futur
incarn to find our faith friend clad in human form and to hear
him bitterli reproach us for hi murder
be dead howev these argument did not appli to eat him as we
were sure he would himself acknowledg so we cut off littl bit of
hi flesh and roll them in snow till thei look as though thei were
nice flour hunger compel us swallow them at a gulp it wa a
disgust meal and we felt like cannib but what could we do
chapter v
the glacier
even that dai came to an end at last and after a few more lump of
yak our tent be gone we drew hi hide over us and rest as best
we could know that at least we had no more avalanch to fear that
night it froze sharpli so that had it not been for the yak hide and
the other rug and garment which fortun we were wear when the
snowslid began it would i think have gone hard with us as it wa
we suffer a great deal
horac said leo at the dawn i am go to leav thi if we have
to die i would rather do so move but i dont believ that we shall
die
veri well i said let us start if the snow wont bear us now it
never will
so we ti up our rug and the yak hide in two bundl and have cut
off some more of the frozen meat began our descent now although the
mount wa under two hundr feet high it base fortun for usfor
otherwis it must have been swept awai by the mighti pressur of the
avalanchewa broad so that there wa a long expans of piledup snow
between us and the level ground
sinc ow to the overhang conform of the place it wa quit
imposs for us to descend in front where pressur had made the snow
hard as stone we were oblig to risk a march over the looser materi
upon it flank as there wa noth to be gain by wait off
we went leo lead and step by step try the snow to our joi we
discov that the sharp night frost had so harden it surfac that
it would support us about half wai down howev where the pressur
had been less it becam much softer so that we were forc to lie
upon our face which enabl us to distribut our weight over a larger
surfac and thu slither gentli down the hill
all went well until we were within twenti pace of the bottom where
we must cross a soft mound form of the powderi dust thrown off by the
avalanch in it rush leo slip over safe but i follow a yard
or two to hi right of a sudden felt the hard crust yield beneath
me an illjudg but quit natur flounder and wriggl such as a
newlyland flatfish give upon the sand complet the mischief and
with on pierc but swiftli stifl yell i vanish
ani on who ha ever sunk in deep water will know that the sensat
is not pleasant but i can assur him that to go through the same
experi in soft snow is infinit wors mud alon could surpass it
terror down i went and down till at length i seem to reach a rock
which alon save me from disappear for ever now i felt the snow
close abov me and with it came dark and a sens of suffoc
so soft wa the drift howev that befor i wa overcom i contriv
with my arm to thrust awai the powderi dust from about my head thu
form a littl hollow into which air filter slowli get my hand
upon the stone i strove to rise but could not the weight upon me wa
too great
then i abandon hope and prepar to die the process prove not
altogeth unpleas i did not see vision from my past life as
drown men ar suppos to do butand thi show how strong wa her
empir over memi mind flew back to ayesha i seem to behold her and
a man at her side stand over me in some dark rocki gulf she wa
wrap in a long travel cloak and her love ey were wild with
fear i rose to salut her and make report but she cri in a fierc
concentr voicewhat evil thing ha happen here thou livest
then where is my lord leo speak man and sai where thou hast hid my
lordor die
the vision wa extraordinarili real and vivid i rememb and
consid in connect with a certain subsequ event in all wai
most remark but it pass as swiftli as it came
then my sens left me
i saw a light again i heard a voic that of leo horac he cri
horac hold fast to the stock of the rifl someth wa thrust
against my outstretch hand i grip it despairingli and there came
a strain it wa useless i did not move then bethink me i drew
up my leg and by chanc or the merci of heaven i know not got my
feet against a ridg of the rock on which i wa ly again i felt the
strain and thrust with all my might of a sudden the snow gave and out
of that hole i shot like a fox from it earth
i struck someth it wa leo strain at the gun and i knock him
backward then down the steep slope we roll land at length upon
the veri edg of the precipic i sat up draw in the air with great
gasp and oh how sweet it wa my ey fell upon my hand and i saw
that the vein stood out on the back of it black as ink and larg as
cord clearli i must have been near my end
how long wa i in there i gasp to leo who sat at my side wipe
off the sweat that ran from hi face in stream
dont know nearli twenti minut i should think
twenti minut it seem like twenti centuri how did you get me
out you could not stand upon the drift dust
no i lai upon the yak skin where the snow wa harder and tunnel
toward you through the powderi stuff with my hand for i knew where
you had sunk and it wa not far off at last i saw your finger tip
thei were so blue that for a few second i took them for rock but
thrust the butt of the rifl against them luckili you still had life
enough to catch hold of it and you know the rest were we not both veri
strong it could never have been done
thank you old fellow i said simpli
why should you thank me he ask with on of hi quick smile do
you suppos that i wish to continu thi journei alon come if you
have got your breath let us be get on you have been sleep in a
cold bed and want exercis look my rifl is broken and your is
lost in the snow well it will save us the troubl of carri the
cartridg and he laugh drearili
then we began our march head for the spot where the road end four
mile or so awai for to go forward seem useless in due cours we
reach it safe onc a mass of snow as larg as a church swept down
just in front of us and onc a great boulder loosen from the mountain
rush at us suddenli like an attack lion or the stone thrown
by polyphemu at the ship of odysseu and leap over our head
vanish with an angri scream into the depth beneath but we took
littl heed of these thing our nerv were deaden and no danger
seem to affect them
there wa the end of the road and there were our own footprint and the
impress of the yak hoof in the snow the sight of them affect me
for it seem strang that we should have live to look upon them
again we stare over the edg of the precipic ye it wa sheer and
absolut unclimb
come to the glacier said leo
so we went on to it and scrambl a littl wai down it root made an
examin here so far as we could judg the cliff wa about four
hundr feet deep but whether or no the tongu of ic reach to the
foot of it we were unabl to tell sinc about two third of the wai
down it arch inward like the end of a bent bow and the conform
of the overhang rock on either side wa such that we could not see
where it termin we climb back again and sat down and despair
took hold of us bitter black despair
what ar we to do i ask in front of us death behind us death
for how can we recross those mountain without food or gun to shoot
it with here death for we must sit and starv we have striven and
fail leo our end is at hand onli a miracl can save us
a miracl he answer well what wa it that led us to the top of
the mount so that we were abl to escap the avalanch and what wa it
which put that rock in your wai as you sank into the bed of dust and
gave me wit and strength to dig you out of your grave of snow and what
is it that ha preserv us through seventeen year of danger such as
few men have known and live some direct power some destini that
will accomplish itself in us why should the power ceas to guid why
should the destini be baulk at last
he paus then ad fierc i tell you horac that even if we had
gun food and yak i would not turn back upon our spoor sinc to do
so would prove me a coward and unworthi of her i will go on
how i ask
by that road and he point to the glacier
it is a road to death
well if so horac it would seem that in thi land men find life in
death or so thei believ if we die now we shall die travel our
path and in the countri where we perish we mai be born again at least
i am determin so you must choos
i have chosen long ago leo we began thi journei togeth and we will
end it togeth perhap ayesha know and will help us and i laugh
drearili if notcom we ar wast time
then we took counsel and the end of it wa that we cut a skin rug and
the yak tough hide into strip and knot these togeth into two
servic rope which we fasten about our middl leav on end
loos for we thought that thei might help us in our descent
next we bound fragment of anoth skin rug about our leg and knee
to protect them from the chafe of the ic and rock and for the same
reason put on our thick leather glove thi done we took the remaind
of our gear and heavi robe and have place stone in them threw
them over the brink of the precipic trust to find them again
should we ever reach it foot now our prepar were complet
and it wa time for us to start upon perhap on of the most desper
journei ever undertaken by men of their own will
yet we stai a littl look at each other in piteou fashion for
we could not speak onli we embrac and i confess i think i wept
a littl it all seem so sad and hopeless these long endur
through mani year these perpetu weari travel and nowth
end i could not bear to think of that splendid man my ward my most
dear friend the companion of my life who stood befor me so full of
beauti and of vigour but who must within a few short minut be turn
into a heap of quiver mangl flesh for myself it did not matter
i wa old it wa time that i should die i had live innoc if it
were innoc to follow thi love imag thi siren of the cave who
lure us on to doom
no i dont think that i thought of myself then but i thought a great
deal of leo and when i saw hi determin face and flash ey as he
nerv himself to the last endeavour i wa proud of him so in broken
accent i bless him and wish him well through all the aeon prai
that i might be hi companion to the end of time in few word and short
he thank me and gave me back my bless then he mutteredcom
so side by side we began the terribl descent at first it wa easi
enough although a slip would have hurl us to etern but we were
strong and skil accustom to such place moreov and made none
about a quarter of the wai down we paus stand upon a great boulder
that wa embed in the ic and turn round cautious lean our
back against the glacier and look about us truli it wa a horribl
place almost sheer nor did we learn much for beneath us a hundr
and twenti feet or more the project bend cut off our view of what
lai below
so feel that our nerv would not bear a prolong contempl of
that dizzi gulf onc more we set our face to the ic and proceed on
the downward climb now matter were more difficult for the stone were
fewer and onc or twice we must slide to reach them not know if we
should ever stop again but the rope which we threw over the angl
of the rock or salient point of ic let ourselv down by their
help and draw them after us when we reach the next foothold save
us from disast
thu at length we came to the bend which wa more than half wai down
the precipic be so far as i could judg about two hundr and
fifti feet from it lip and sai on hundr and fifti from the darksom
bottom of the narrow gulf here were no stone but onli some rough ic
on which we sat to rest
we must look said leo present
but the question wa how to do thi inde there wa onli on wai
to hang over the bend and discov what lai below we read each other
thought without the need of word and i made a motion as though i would
start
no said leo i am younger and stronger than you come help me and
he began to fasten the end of hi rope to a strong project point of
ic now he said hold my ankl
it seem an insan but there wa noth els to be done so fix
my heel in a nich i grasp them and slowli he slid forward till hi
bodi vanish to the middl what he saw doe not matter for i saw it
all afterward but what happen wa that suddenli all hi great weight
came upon my arm with such a jerk that hi ankl were torn from my
grip
or who know perhap in my terror i loos them obei the natur
impuls which prompt a man to save hi own life if so mai i be
forgiven but had i held on i must have been jerk into the abyss
then the rope ran out and remain taut
leo i scream leo and i heard a muffl voic sai as i
thought come what it realli said wasdont come but indeedand
mai it go to my crediti did not paus to think but face outward
just as i wa sit began to slide and scrambl down the ic
in two second i had reach the curv in three i wa over it beneath
wa what i can onli describ as a great icicl broken off short and
separ from the cliff by about four yard of space thi icicl wa
not more than fifteen feet in length and slope outward so that my
descent wa not sheer moreov at the end of it the trickl of
water or some such accid had worn awai the ic leav a littl
ledg as broad perhap as a man hand there were rough on the
surfac below the curv upon which my cloth caught also i grip
them desper with my finger thu it came about that i slid down
quit gentli and my heel land upon the littl ledg remain
almost upright with outstretch armslik a person crucifi to a
cross of ic
then i saw everyth and the sight curdl the blood within my vein
hang to the rope four or five feet below the broken point wa leo
out of reach of it and out of reach of the cliff as he hung turn
slowli round and round much asfor in a dread inconsequ fashion
the absurd similar struck me even thena joint turn befor the
fire below yawn the black gulf and at the bottom of it far far
beneath appear a faint white sheet of snow that is what i saw
think of it think of it i crucifi upon the ic my heel rest
upon a littl ledg my finger grasp excresc on which a bird
could scarc have found a foothold round and below me dizzi space
to climb back whenc i came wa imposs to stir even wa imposs
sinc on slip and i must be gone
and below me hung like a spider to it cord leo turn slowli round
and round
i could see that rope of green hide stretch beneath hi weight and the
doubl knot in it slip and tighten and i rememb wonder which
would give first the hide or the knot or whether it would hold till
he drop from the noos limb by limb
oh i have been in mani a peril place i who sprang from the swai
stone to the point of the trembl spur and miss my aim but never
never in such a on as thi agoni took hold of me a cold sweat burst
from everi pore i could feel it run down my face like tear my
hair bristl upon my head and below in utter silenc leo turn
round and round and each time he turn hi upcast ey met mine with
a look that wa horribl to see
the silenc wa the worst of it the silenc and the helpless if
he had cri out if he had struggl it would have been better but
to know that he wa aliv there with everi nerv and percept at it
utmost stretch oh my god oh my god
my limb began to ach and yet i dare not stir a muscl thei
ach horribl or so i thought and beneath thi tortur mental and
physic my mind gave
i rememb thing rememb how as a child i had climb a tree
and reach a place whenc i could move neither up nor down and what i
suffer then rememb how onc in egypt a foolhardi friend of mine
had ascend the second pyramid alon and becom thu crucifi upon
it shine cap where he remain for a whole half hour with four
hundr feet of space beneath him i could see him now stretch hi
stocking foot downward in a vain attempt to reach the next crack and
draw it back again could see hi tortur face a white blot upon
the red granit
then that face vanish and black gather round me and in
the black vision of the live resistless avalanch of the
snowgrav into which i had sunkoh year and year ago of ayesha
demand leo life at my hand black and silenc through which i
could onli hear the crack of my muscl
suddenli in the black a flash and in the silenc a sound the flash
wa the flash of a knife which leo had drawn he wa hack at the cord
with it fierc fierc to make an end and the sound wa that of
the nois he made a ghastli nois half shout of defianc and half yell
of terror as at the third stroke it part
i saw it part the tough hide wa half cut through and it sever
portion curl upward and downward like the upper and lower lip of an
angri dog whilst that which wa unsev stretch out slowli slowli
till it grew quit thin then it snap so that the rope flew upward
and struck me across the face like the lash of a whip
anoth instant and i heard a crackl thud sound leo had struck
the ground below leo wa dead a mangl mass of flesh and bone as i
had pictur him i could not bear it my nerv and human digniti came
back i would not wait until my strength exhaust i slid from my
perch as a wound bird fall from a tree no i would follow him at
onc of my own act
i let my arm fall against my side and rejoic in the relief from
pain that the movement gave me then balanc upon my heel i stood
upright took my last look at the sky mutter my last prayer for an
instant i remain thu pois
shout i come i rais my hand abov my head and dive as a
bather dive dive into the black gulf beneath
chapter vi
in the gate
oh that rush through space folk fall thu ar suppos to lose
conscious but i can assert that thi is not true never were my
wit and percept more live than while i travel from that broken
glacier to the ground and never did a short journei seem to take a
longer time i saw the white floor like some live thing leap up
through empti air to meet me thenfini
crash why what wa thi i still live i wa in water for i could
feel it chill and go down down till i thought i should never rise
again but rise i did though my lung were nigh to burst first as i
float up toward the top i rememb the crash which told me that
i had pass through ic therefor i should meet ic at the surfac
again oh to think that after surviv so much i must be drown like
a kitten and beneath a sheet of ic my hand touch it there it wa
abov me shine white like glass heaven be prais my head broke
through in thi low and shelter gorg it wa but a film no thicker
than a penni form by the light frost of the previou night so i rose
from the deep and stare about me tread water with my feet
then i saw the gladdest sight that ever my ey beheld for on the
right not ten yard awai the water run from hi hair and beard
wa leo leo aliv for he broke the thin ic with hi arm as he
struggl toward the shore from the deep river he saw me also and
hi grei ey seem to start out of hi head
usual as we learn afterward the river at thi
spot wa quit shallow onli a foot or two in depth it wa
the avalanch that by dam it with fallen heap of snow
had rais it level veri mani feet therefor to thi
avalanch which had threaten to destroi us we in realiti
ow our live for had the stream stood onli at it normal
height we must have been dash to piec upon the stone
l h h
still live both of us and the precipic pass he shout in a
ring exult voic i told you we were led
ay but whither i answer as i too fought my wai through the film
of ic
then it wa i becam awar that we were no longer alon for on the
bank of the river some thirti yard from us stood two figur a man
lean upon a long staff and a woman he wa a veri old man for hi
ey were horni hi snowwhit hair and beard hung upon the bent breast
and shoulder and hi sardon wrinkl featur were yellow as wax
thei might have been those of a death mask cut in marbl there clad in
an ampl monkish robe and lean upon the staff he stood still as
a statu and watch us i note it all everi detail although at the
time i did not know that i wa do so as we broke our wai through the
ic toward them and afterward the pictur came back to me also i saw
that the woman who wa veri tall point to us
nearer the bank or rather to the rock edg of the river it surfac
wa free of ic for here the stream ran veri swiftli see thi we
drew close togeth and swam on side by side to help each other if need
were there wa much need for in the fring of the torrent the strength
that had serv me so long seem to desert me and i becam helpless
numb too with the bite cold of the water inde had not leo
grasp my cloth i think that i should have been swept awai by the
current to perish thu aid i fought on a while till he saidi am
go under hold to the rope end
so i grip the strip of yak hide that wa still fast about him and
hi hand thu freed leo made a last splendid effort to keep us both
cumber as we were with the thick soak garment that drag us down
like lead from be suck beneath the surfac moreov he succeed
where ani other swimmer of less strength must have fail still i
believ that we should have drown sinc here the water ran like a
millrac had not the man upon the shore see our plight and urg
thereto by the woman run with surpris swift in on so ag to a
point of rock that jut some yard into the stream past which we were
be swept and seat himself stretch out hi long stick toward
us
with a desper endeavour leo grasp it as we went by roll over
and over each other and held on round we swung into the eddi found
our feet were knock down again rub and pound on the rock but
still grip that staff of salvat to hi end of which the old
man clung like a limpet to a stone while the woman clung to him we
recov ourselv and shelter somewhat by the rock flounder
toward the shore ly on hi facefor we were still in great
dangerth man extend hi arm we could not reach it and wors
suddenli the staff wa torn from him we were be swept awai
then it wa that the woman did a nobl thing for spring into the
watery up to her armpitsand hold fast to the old man by
her left hand with the right she seiz leo hair and drag him
shoreward now he found hi feet for a moment and throw on arm
about her slender form steadi himself thu while with the other he
support me next follow a long confus struggl but the end of it
wa that three of us the old man leo and i roll in a heap upon the
bank and lai there gasp
present i look up the woman stood over us water stream from her
garment stare like on in a dream at leo face smother as it wa
with blood run from a deep cut in hi head even then i notic how
state and beauti she wa now she seem to awak and glanc
at the robe that clung to her splendid shape said someth to her
companion then turn and ran toward the cliff
as we lai befor him utterli exhaust the old man who had risen
contempl us solemnli with hi dim ey he spoke but we did not
understand again he tri anoth languag and without success a third
time and our ear were open for the tongu he us wa greek ye
there in central asia he address us in greek not veri pure it is
true but still greek
ar you wizard he said that you have live to reach thi land
nai i answer in the same tongu though in broken wordssinc of
greek i had thought littl for mani a yearfor then we should have
come otherwis and i point to our hurt and the precipic behind us
thei know the ancient speech it is as we were told from the mountain
he mutter to himself then he askedstrang what seek you
now i grew cun and did not answer fear lest should he learn
the truth he would thrust us back into the river but leo had no such
caution or rather all reason had left him he wa lighthead
we seek he stutter outhi greek which had alwai been feebl
now wa simpli barbar and mix with variou thibetan dialectsw
seek the land of the fire mountain that is crown with the sign of
life
the man stare at us so you know he said then broke off and ad
and whom do you seek
her answer leo wildli the queen i think that he meant to sai
the priestess or the goddess but could onli think of the greek for
queen or rather someth resembl it or perhap it wa becaus the
woman who had gone look like a queen
oh said the man you seek a queenthen you ar those for whom we
were bidden to watch nai how can i be sure
is thi a time to put question i gasp angrili answer me on
rather who ar you
i stranger my titl is guardian of the gate and the ladi who wa
with me is the khania of kaloon
at thi point leo began to faint
that man is sick said the guardian and now that you have got your
breath again you must have shelter both of you and at onc come
help me
so support leo on either side we drag ourselv awai from that
accurs cliff and styxlik river up a narrow wind gorg present
it open out and there stretch across the glade we saw the gate
of thi all i observ then for my memori of the detail of thi scene
and of the convers that pass is veri weak and blur wa
that it seem to be a mighti wall of rock in which a pathwai had been
hollow where doubtless onc pass the road on on side of thi
passag wa a stair which we began to ascend with great difficulti for
leo wa now almost senseless and scarc move hi leg inde at the
head of the first flight he sank down in a heap nor did our strength
suffic to lift him
while i wonder feebli what wa to be done i heard footstep and
look up saw the woman who had save him descend the stair
and after her two robe men with a tartar cast of counten veri
impass small ey and yellowish skin even the sight of us did
not appear to move them to astonish she spoke some word to them
whereon thei lift leo heavi frame appar with eas and carri
him up the step
we follow and reach a room that seem to be hewn from the rock
abov the gatewai where the woman call khania left us from it we
pass through other room on of them a kind of kitchen in which
a fire burn till we came to a larg chamber evid a sleep
place for in it were wooden bedstead mattress and rug here leo
wa laid down and with the assist of on of hi servant the old
guardian undress him at the same time motion me to take off my own
garment thi i did gladli enough for the first time dure mani dai
though with great pain and difficulti to find that i wa a mass of
wound and bruis
present our host blew upon a whistl and the other servant appear
bring hot water in a jar with which we were wash over then the
guardian dress our hurt with some sooth ointment and wrap us
round with blanket after thi broth wa brought into which he mix
medicin and give me a portion to drink where i lai upon on of the
bed he took leo head upon hi knee and pour the rest of it down
hi throat instantli a wonder warmth ran through me and my ach
brain began to swim then i rememb no more
after thi we were veri veri ill what mai be the exact medic

i suppos when food wa administ to me and receiv impress
of whatev wa pass in the place thu i can recollect that
yellowfac old guardian stand over me like a ghost in the
moonlight stroke hi long beard hi ey fix upon my face as
though he would search out the secret of my soul

men then walk to the window and look up long and earnestli like
on who studi the star
after thi i rememb a disturb in the room and domin it as
it were the rich sound of a woman voic and the rustl of a woman
silk sweep the stone floor i open my ey and saw that it wa she
who had help to rescu us who had rescu us in fact a tall and
noblelook ladi with a beauteou weari face and liquid ey which
seem to burn from the heavi cloak she wore i thought that she must
have just return from a journei
she stood abov me and look at me then turn awai with a gestur
of indiffer if not of disgust speak to the guardian in a low
voic by wai of answer he bow point to the other bed where leo
lai asleep and thither she pass with slow imperi movement i
saw her bend down and lift the corner of a wrap which cover hi
wound head and heard her utter some smother word befor she turn
round to the guardian as though to question him further
but he had gone and be alon for she thought me senseless she drew
a rough stool to the side of the bed and seat herself studi leo
who lai thereon with an earnest that wa almost terribl for
her soul seem to be concentr in her ey and to find express
through them long she gaze thu then rose and began to walk swiftli
up and down the chamber press her hand now to her bosom and now
to her brow a certain passion perplex stamp upon her face as
though she struggl to rememb someth and could not
where and when she whisper oh where and when
of the end of that scene i know noth for although i fought hard
against it oblivion master me after thi i becam awar that the
regallook woman call khania wa alwai in the room and that she
seem to be nurs leo with great care and tender sometim even
she nurs me when leo did not need attent and she had noth els
to do or so her manner seem to suggest it wa as though i excit
her curios and she wish me to recov that it might be satisfi
again i awok how long afterward i cannot sai it wa night and
the room wa light by the moon onli now shine in a clear sky it
steadi rai enter at the windowplac fell on leo bed and by them
i saw that the dark imperi woman wa watch at hi side some sens
of her presenc must have commun itself to him for he began to
mutter in hi sleep now in english now in arab she becam intens
interest as her everi movement show then rise suddenli she
glide across the room on tipto to look at me see her come i
feign to be asleep and so well that she wa deceiv
for i wa also interest who wa thi ladi whom the guardian had
call the khania of kaloon could it be she whom we sought why not
and yet if i saw ayesha sure i should know her sure there would be
no room for doubt
back she went again to the bed kneel down besid leo and in the
intens silenc which followedfor he had ceas hi mutteringsi
thought that i could hear the beat of her heart now she began to
speak veri low and in that same bastard greek tongu mix here and
there with mongolian word such as ar common to the dialect of central
asia i could not hear or understand all she said but some sentenc i
did understand and thei frighten me not a littl
man of my dream she murmur whenc come you who ar you why did
the hesea bid me to meet you then some sentenc i could not catch
you sleep in sleep the ey ar open answer i bid you sai what
is the bond between you and me why have i dreamt of you why do i know
you why and the sweet rich voic di slowli from a whisper into
silenc as though she were asham to utter what wa on her tongu
as she bent over him a lock of her hair broke loos from it jewel
fillet and fell across hi face at it touch leo seem to wake for
he lift hi gaunt white hand and touch the hair then said in
englishwher am i oh i rememb and their ey met as he strove
to lift himself and could not then he spoke again in hi broken
stumbl greek you ar the ladi who save me from the water sai ar

trembl voic but true it is i am a queenif a khania be a queen
sai then queen do you rememb me
we have met in dream she answer i think that we have met in a
past that is far awai ye i knew it when first i saw you there by the
river stranger with the well rememb face tell me i prai you how
you ar name
leo vincei
she shook her head whisperingi know not the name yet you i know
you know me how do you know me he said heavili and seem to sink
again into slumber or swoon
she watch him for a while veri intent then as though some forc
that she could not resist drew her i saw her bend down her head over
hi sleep face ye and i saw her kiss him swiftli on the lip then
spring back crimson to the hair as though overwhelm with shame at
thi victori of her mad passion
now it wa that she discov me
bewild fascin amaz i had rais myself upon my bed not
know it i suppos that i might see and hear the better it wa
wrong doubtless but no common curios overmast me who had my
share in all thi stori more it wa foolish but ill and wonder
had kill my reason
ye she saw me watch them and such furi seem to take hold of her
that i thought my hour had come
man have you dare she said in an intens whisper and snatch
at her girdl now in her hand shone a knife and i knew that it wa
destin for my heart then in thi sore danger my wit came back to me
and as she advanc i stretch out my shake hand sayingoh of
your piti give me to drink the fever burn me it burn and i look
round like on bewild who see not repeat give me drink you
who ar call guardian and i fell back exhaust
she stop like a hawk in it stoop and swiftli sheath the dagger
then take a bowl of milk that stood on a tabl near her she held
it to my lip search my face the while with her flame ey for
inde passion rage and fear had lit them till thei seem to flame
i drank the milk in great gulp though never in my life did i find it
more hard to swallow
you trembl she said have dream haunt you
ay friend i answer dream of that fearsom precipic and of the
last leap
aught els she ask
nai is it not enough oh what a journei to have taken to befriend a
queen
to befriend a queen she repeat puzzl what mean the man you
swear you have had no other dream
ay i swear by the symbol of life and the mount of the waver flame
and by yourself o queen from the ancient dai
then i sigh and pretend to swoon for i could think of noth els
to do as i close my ey i saw her face that had been red as dawn turn
pale as ev for my word and all which might lie behind them had gone
home moreov she wa in doubt for i could hear her finger the
handl of the dagger then she spoke aloud word for my ear if thei
still were open
i am glad she said that he dream no other dream sinc had he
done so and babbl of them it would have been illomen and i do not
wish that on who ha travel far to visit us should be hurl to
the deathdog for burial on moreov who although old and hideou
still ha the air of a wise and silent man
now while i shiver at these unpleas hintsthough what the
deathdog in which peopl were buri might be i could not
conceiveto my intens joi i heard the foot of the guardian on the
stair heard him too enter the room and saw him bow befor the ladi
how go these sick men niec he said in hi cold voic
i found later that the khania aten wa not simbri
niec but hi greatniec on the mother sidel h h
thei swoon both of them she answer
inde is it so i thought otherwis i thought thei woke
what have you heard shaman ie wizard she ask angrili
i oh i heard the grate of a dagger in it sheath and the distant
bai of the deathhound
and what have you seen shaman she ask again look through the
gate you guard
strang sight khania my niec butmen awak from swoon
ay she answer so while thi on sleep bear him to anoth
chamber for he need chang and the lord yonder need more space and
untaint air
the guardian whom she call shaman or magician held a lamp in hi
hand and by it light it wa easi to see hi face which i watch
out of the corner of my ey i thought that it wore a veri strang
express on moreov that alarm me somewhat from the begin
i had misdoubt me of thi old man whose cast of counten wa
vindict as it wa abl now i wa afraid of him
to which chamber khania he said with mean
i think she answer slowli to on that is health where he
will recov the man ha wisdom she ad as though in explan
moreov have the word from the mountain to harm him would be
danger but why do you ask
he shrug hi shoulder
i tell you i heard the deathhound bai that is all ye with you i
think that he ha wisdom and the bee which seek honei should suck the
flowerbefor it fade also as you sai there ar command with which
it is ill to trifl even if we cannot guess their mean
then go to the door he blew upon hi whistl and instantli i heard
the feet of hi servant upon the stair he gave them an order and
gentli enough thei lift the mattress on which i lai and follow him
down sundri passag and past some stair into anoth chamber shape
like that we had left but not so larg where thei place me upon a
bed
the guardian watch me awhil to see that i did not wake next he
stretch out hi hand and felt my heart and puls an examin
the result of which seem to puzzl him for he utter a littl
exclam and shook hi head after thi he left the room and i heard
him bolt the door behind him then be still veri weak i fell asleep
in earnest
when i awok it wa broad daylight my mind wa clear and i felt better
than i had done for mani a dai sign by which i knew that the fever had
left me and that i wa on the high road to recoveri now i rememb
all the event of the previou night and wa abl to weigh them
carefulli thi to be sure i did for mani reason among them that i
knew i had been and still wa in great danger
i had seen and heard too much and thi woman call khania guess that
i had seen and heard inde had it not been for my hint about the
symbol of life and the mount of flame after i had disarm her first
rage by my artific i felt sure that she would have order the old
guardian or shaman to do me to death in thi wai or the other sure also
that he would not have hesit to obei her i had been spare partli
becaus for some unknown reason she wa afraid to kill me and partli
that she might learn how much i knew although the deathhound had
bai whatev that might mean well up to the present i wa safe
and for the rest i must take my chanc moreov it wa necessari to
be cautiou and if need were to feign ignor so dismiss the
matter of my own fate from my mind i fell to consid the scene
which i had wit and what might be it purport
wa our quest at an end wa thi woman ayesha leo had so dream but
he wa still deliri therefor here wa littl on which to lean
what seem more to the point wa that she herself evid appear to
think that there exist some tie between her and thi sick man why
had she embrac him i wa sure that she could be no wanton nor inde
would ani woman indulg for it own sake in such folli with a stranger
who hung between life and death what she had done wa done becaus
irresist impuls born of knowledg or at least of memori drove
her on though mayhap the knowledg wa imperfect and the memori were
undefin who save ayesha could have known anyth of leo in the past
none who live upon the earth todai
and yet why not if what kouen the abbot and ten of million of hi
fellowworshipp believ were true if the soul of human be were
in fact strictli limit in number and becam the tenant of an endless
success of physic bodi which thei chang from time to time as we
chang our wornout garment why should not other have known him for
instanc that daughter of the pharaoh who caus him through love to
break the vow that he had vow knew a certain kallikr a priest
of isi whom the god cherish and the demon obei even amenarta the
mistress of magic
oh now a light seem to break upon me a wonder light what if
amenarta and thi khania thi woman with royalti stamp on everi
featur should be the same would not that magic of my own peopl
that i have of which she wrote upon the sherd enabl her to pierc the
dark of the past and recogn the priest whom she had bewitch to
love her snatch him out of the veri hand of the goddess what if it
were not ayesha but amenarta reincarn who rule thi hidden land
and onc more sought to make the man she love break through hi vow
if so know the evil that must come i shook even at it shadow the
truth must be learn but how
whilst i wonder the door open and the sardon
inscrutableoldfac man whom thi khania had call magician and who
call the khania niec enter and stood befor me

what did my uncl the shaman he who is call guardian tell you
nai you saw as i knew you saw and it would have been best to slai you
for oh what must you think of me
i made no answer for in truth i did not know what to think also
i fear lest further rash admiss should be follow by swift
vengeanc
you must believ she went on that i who have ever hate men that
ii swear that it is truewhos lip ar purer than those mountain
snow i the khania of kaloon whom thei name heartofic am but a
shameless thing and cover her face with her hand she moan in
the bitter of her distress
nai i said there mai be reason explan if it pleas you to
give them
wander there ar such reason and sinc you know so much you shall
learn them also like that husband of mine i have becom mad when
first i saw the face of your companion as i drag him from the river
mad enter me and ii
love him i suggest well such thing have happen befor to
peopl who were not mad
oh she went on it wa more than love i wa possess and that
night i knew not what i did a power drove me on a destini compel
me and to the end i am hi and hi alon ye i am hi and i swear
that he shall be mine and with thi wild declar danger enough
under the condit she turn and fled the room
she wa gone and after the struggl for such it wa i sank back
exhaust how came it that thi sudden passion had master her who
and what wa thi khania i wonder again andthi wa more to the
point who and what would leo believ her to be if onli i could be with
him befor he said word or did deed imposs to recal
three dai went by dure which time i saw no more of the khania who
or so i wa inform by simbri the shaman had return to her citi to
make readi for us her guest i beg him to allow me to rejoin leo
but he answer polit though with much firm that my fosterson
did better without me now i grew suspici fear lest some harm
had come to leo though how to discov the truth i knew not in my
anxieti i tri to convei a note to him written upon a leaf of a
watergain pocketbook but the yellowfac servant refus to touch
it and simbri said drili that he would have naught to do with write
which he could not read at length on the third night i made up my mind
that whatev the risk with leav or without it i would try to find
him
by thi time i could walk well and inde wa almost strong again so
about midnight when the moon wa up for i had no other light i crept
from my bed threw on my garment and take a knife which wa the
onli weapon i possess open the door of my room and start
now when i wa carri from the rockchamb where leo and i had
been togeth i took note of the wai first reckon from my
sleepingplac there wa a passag thirti pace long for i had count
the footfal of my bearer then came a turn to the left and ten more
pace of passag and lastli near certain step run to some place
unknown anoth sharp turn to the right which led to our old chamber
down the long passag i walk stealthili and although it wa pitch
dark found the turn to the left and follow it till i came to the
second sharp turn to the right that of the galleri from which rose
the stair i crept round it onli to retreat hastili enough as well
i might for at the door of leo room which she wa in the act of
lock on the outsid as i could see by the light of the lamp that she
held in her hand stood the khania herself
my first thought wa to fly back to my own chamber but i abandon
it feel sure that i should be seen therefor i determin if she
discov me to face the matter out and sai that i wa try to find
leo and to learn how he fare so i crouch against the wall and
wait with a beat heart i heard her sweep down the passag
andyesbegin to mount the stair
now what should i do to try to reach leo wa useless for she had
lock the door with the kei she held go back to bed no i would
follow her and if we met would make the same excus thu i might get
some tide or perhapsa dagger thrust
so round the corner and up the step i went noiselessli as a snake
thei were mani and wind like those of a church tower but at length
i came to the head of them where wa a littl land and open from
it a door it wa a veri ancient door the light stream through crack
where it panel had rot and from the room beyond came the sound of
voic those of the shaman simbri and the khania
have you learn aught my niec i heard him sai and also heard her
answera littl a veri littl
then in my thirst for knowledg i grew bold and steal to the door
look through on of the crack in it wood opposit to me in the
full flood of light thrown by a hang lamp her hand rest on a
tabl at which simbri wa seat stood the khania truli she wa a
beauteou sight for she wore robe of royal purpl and on her brow a
littl coronet of gold beneath which her curl hair stream down
her shape neck and bosom see her i guess at onc that she had
arrai herself thu for some secret end enhanc her loveli by
everi art and grace that is known to woman simbri wa look at her
earnestli with fear and doubt written on even hi cold impass
featur
what pass between you then he ask peer at her
i question him close as to the reason of hi come to thi
land and wrung from him the answer that it wa to seek some beauteou
womanh would sai no more i ask him if she were more beauteou than
i am and he repli with courtesynoth els i thinkthat it
would be hard to sai but that she had been differ then i said that
though it behoov me not to speak of such a matter there wa no ladi
in kaloon whom men held to be so fair as i moreov that i wa it
ruler and that i and no other had save him from the water ay and i
ad that my heart told me i wa the woman whom he sought
have done niec said simbri impati i would not hear of the
art you usedwel enough doubtless what then
then he said that it might be so sinc he thought that thi woman
wa born again and studi me a while ask me if i had ever pass
through fire to thi i repli that the onli fire i had pass were
those of the spirit and that i dwelt in them now he said show me
your hair and i place a lock of it in hi hand present he let
it fall and from that satchel which he wear about hi neck drew out
anoth tress of hairoh simbri my uncl the loveliest hair that
ever ey beheld for it wa soft as silk and reach from my coronet
to the ground moreov no raven wing in the sunshin ever shone as
did that fragrant tress
your is beauti he said but see thei ar not the same
mayhap i answer sinc no woman ever wore such lock
you ar right he repli for she whom i seek wa more than a
woman
and thenand thenthough i tri him in mani wai he would sai no
more so feel hate against thi unknown rise in my heart and
fear lest i should utter word that were best unsaid i left him now
i bid you search the book which ar open to your wisdom and tell me of
thi woman whom he seek who she is and where she dwell oh search
them swiftli that i mai find her andkil her if i can
ay if you can answer the shaman and if she live to kill but
sai where shall we begin our quest now thi letter from the mountain
that the headpriest oro sent to your court a while agoand he
select a parchment from a pile which lai upon the tabl and look at
her
read she said i would hear it again
so he read from the hesea of the hous of fire to aten khania of
kaloon
my sisterwarn ha reach me that two stranger of a western
race journei to your land seek my oracl of which thei would ask a
question on the first dai of the next moon i command that you and with
you simbri your greatuncl the wise shaman guardian of the gate
shall be watch the river in the gulf at the foot of the ancient road
for by that steep path the stranger travel aid them in all thing and
bring them safe to the mountain know that in thi matter i shall
hold him and you to account myself i will not meet them sinc to do so
would be to break the pact between our power which sai that the hesea
of the sanctuari visit not the territori of kaloon save in war also
their come is otherwis appoint
it would seem said simbri lai down the parchment that these ar
no chanc wander sinc he await them
ay thei ar no chanc wander sinc my heart await on of them
also yet the hesea cannot be that woman for reason which ar known to
you
there ar mani women on the mountain suggest the shaman in a dry
voic if inde ani woman ha to do with thi matter
i at least have to do with it and he shall not go to the mountain
he is power my niec and beneath these smooth word of her li
a dread threat i sai that she is mighti from of old and ha servant
in the earth and air who warn her of the come of these men and
will warn her of what befal them i know it who hate her and to your
royal hous of rassen it ha been known for mani a gener therefor
thwart her not lest ill befal us all for she is a spirit and terribl
she sai that it is appoint that thei shall go
and i sai it is appoint that he shall not go let the other go if
he desir
aten be plain what will you with the man call leothat he should
becom your lover ask the shaman
she stare him straight in the ey and answer boldlynai i will
that he should becom my husband
first he must will it too who seem to have no mind that wai also
how can a woman have two husband
she laid her hand upon hi shoulder and saidi have no husband you
know it well simbri i charg you by the close bond of blood between

chapter viii
the deathhound
it mai have been ten oclock on the follow morn or a littl past
it when the shaman simbri came into my room and ask me how i had
slept
like a log i answer like a log a drug man could not have
rest more soundli
inde friend holli and yet you look fatigu
my dream troubl me somewhat i answer i suffer from such
thing but sure by your face friend simbri you cannot have slept at
all for never yet have i seen you with so weari an air
i am weari he said with a sigh last night i spent up on my
businesswatch at the gate
what gate i ask those by which we enter thi kingdom for if
so i would rather watch than travel them
the gate of the past and of the futur ye those two which you
enter if you will for did you not travel out of a wondrou past
toward a futur that you cannot guess
but both of which interest you i suggest
perhap he answer then ad i come to tell you that within an
hour you ar to start for the citi whither the khania ha but now gone
on to make readi for you
ye onli you told me that she had gone some dai ago well i am sound
again and prepar to march but sai how is my fosterson
he mend he mend but you shall see him for yourself it is the
khania will here come the slave bear your robe and with them i
leav you
so with their assist i dress myself first in good clean
underlinen then in wide woollen trouser and vest and lastli in a
furlin camelhair robe dy black that wa veri comfort to wear
and in appear not unlik a long overcoat a flat cap of the same
materi and a pair of boot made of untan hide complet my attir
scarc wa i readi when the yellowfac servant with mani bow
took me by the hand and led me down the passag and stair of the
gatehous to it door here to my great joi i found leo look
pale and troubl but otherwis as well as i could expect after hi
sick he wa attir like myself save that hi garment were of a
finer qualiti and the overcoat wa white with a hood to it ad i
suppos to protect the wound in hi head from cold and the sun thi
white dress i thought becam him veri well also about it there wa
noth grotesqu or even remark he sprang to me and seiz my
hand ask how i fare and where i had been hidden awai a greet
of which as i could see the warmth wa not lost upon simbri who stood
by
i answer well enough now that we were togeth again and for the
rest i would tell him later
then thei brought us palanquin carri each of them by two poni
on of which wa har ahead and the other behind between long
shaftlik pole in these we seat ourselv and at a sign from
simbri slave took the lead poni by the bridl and we start
leav behind us that grim old gatehous through which we were the
first stranger to pass for mani a gener
for a mile or more our road ran down a wind rocki gorg till
suddenli it took a turn and the countri of kaloon lai stretch befor
us at our feet wa a river probabl the same with which we had made
acquaint in the gulf where fed by the mountain snow it had it
sourc here it flow rapidli but on the vast alluvi land
beneath becam a broad and gentl stream that wound it wai through the
limitless plain till it wa lost in the blue of the distanc
to the north howev thi smooth monoton expans wa broken by
that mountain which had guid us from afar the hous of fire it wa
a great distanc from us more than a hundr mile i should sai yet
even so a most majest sight in that clear air mani leagu from the
base of it peak the ground began to rise in brown and rug hillock
from which sprang the holi mountain itself a white and dazzl point
that soar full twenti thousand feet into the heaven
ye and there upon the nether lip of it crater stood the gigant
pillar surmount by a yet more gigant loop of virgin rock whereof
the black stood out grimli against the blue of the sky beyond and
the blind snow beneath
we gaze at it with aw as well we might thi beacon of our hope that
for aught we knew might also prove their monument feel even then
that yonder our fate would declar itself i note further that all
those with us did it rever by bow their head as thei caught
sight of the peak and by lai the first finger of the right hand
across the first finger of the left a gestur as we afterward
discov design to avert it evil influenc ye even simbri
bow a yield to inherit superstit of which i should scarc
have suspect him
have you ever journei to that mountain ask leo of him
simbri shook hi head and answer evas
the peopl of the plain do not set foot upon the mountain among it
slope beyond the river which wash them live hord of brave and most
savag men with whom we ar oftentim at war for when thei ar hungri
thei raid our cattl and our crop moreov there when the mountain
labour run red stream of molten rock and now and again hot ash
fall that slai the travel
do the ash ever fall in your countri ask leo
thei have been known to do so when the spirit of the mountain is angri
and that is why we fear her
who is thi spirit said leo eagerli
i do not know lord he answer with impati can men see a
spirit
you look as though you might and had not so long ago repli leo
fix hi gaze on the old man waxen face and uneasi ey for now
their horni calm wa gone from the ey of simbri which seem as
though thei had beheld some sight that haunt him
you do me too much honour lord he repli my skill and vision do
not reach so far but see here is the landingstag where boat await
us for the rest of our journei is by water
these boat prove to be roomi and comfort have flat bow and
stern sinc although sometim a sail wa hoist thei were design
for tow not to be row with oar leo and i enter the largest of
them and to our joi were left alon except for the steersman
behind us wa anoth boat in which were attend and slave and
some men who look like soldier for thei carri bow and sword now
the poni were taken from the palanquin that were pack awai and
rope of green hide fasten to iron ring in the prow of the
boat were fix to the tow tackl with which the anim had been
rehar then we start the poni two arrang tandem fashion
to each punt trot along a wellmad tow path that wa furnish
with wooden bridg wherev canal or tributari stream enter the
main river
thank heaven said leo we ar togeth again at last do you
rememb horac that when we enter the land of kor it wa thu in a
boat the tale repeat itself
i can quit believ it i answer i can believ anyth leo
i sai that we ar but gnat mesh in a web and yonder khania is
the spider and simbri the shaman guard the net but tell me all you
rememb of what ha happen to you and be quick for i do not know
how long thei mai leav us alon
well he said of cours i rememb our arriv at that gate after
the ladi and the old man had pull us out of the river and horac
talk of spider remind me of hang at the end of that string
of yak hide not that i need much remind for i am not like to
forget it do you know i cut the rope becaus i felt that i wa go
mad and wish to die sane what happen to you did you slip
no i jump after you it seem best to end togeth so that we
might begin again togeth
brave old horac he said affection the tear start to hi
grei ey
well never mind all that i broke in you see you were right when
you said that we should get through and we have now for your tale
it is interest but not veri long he answer colour i went
to sleep and when i woke it wa to find a beauti woman lean over
me and horaceat first i thought that it wasyou know who and that
she kiss me but perhap it wa all a dream
it wa no dream i answer i saw it
i am sorri to hear itveri sorri at ani rate there wa the beauti
womanth khaniafor i saw her plenti of time afterward and talk
to her in my best modern greekbi the wai ayesha knew the old greek
that curiou
she knew sever of the ancient tongu and so did other peopl go
on
well she nurs me veri kindli but so far as i know until last
night there wa noth more affection and i had sens enough to
refus to talk about our somewhat event past i pretend not to
understand said that we were explor etc and kept ask her where
you were for i forgot to sai i found that you had gone i think that
she grew rather angri with me for she want to know someth and as
you can guess i want to know a good deal but i could get noth out
of her except that she wa the khaniaa person in author there wa
no doubt about that for when on of those slave or servant came in
and interrupt her while she wa try to draw the fact out of me
she call to some of her peopl to throw him out of the window and he
onli save himself by go down the stair veri quickli
well i could make noth of her and she could make littl of me
though why she should be so tenderli interest in a stranger i dont
knowunless unlessoh who is she horac
if you will go on i will tell you what i think present on tale at a
time
veri good i got quit well and strong compar speak till
the climax last night which upset me again after that old prophet
simbri had brought me my supper just as i wa think of go to
sleep the khania came in alon dress like a queen i can tell you
she look realli royal like a princess in a fairi book with a crown
on and her chestnut black hair flow round her
well horac then she began to make love to me in a refin sort of
wai or so i thought look at me and sigh sai that we had known
each other in the pastveri well inde i gatheredand impli that
she wish to continu our friendship i fenc with her as best i
could but a man feel fairli helpless ly on hi back with a veri
handsom and veri imperiallook ladi stand over him and pai him
compliment
the end of it wa that driven to it by her question and to stop that
sort of thing i told her that i wa look for my wife whom i
had lost for after all ayesha is my wife horac she smile and
suggest that i need not look far in short that the lost wife wa
alreadi foundin herself who had come to save me from death in the
river inde she spoke with such convict that i grew sure that she
wa not mere amus herself and felt veri much inclin to believ
her for after all ayesha mai be chang now
then while i wa at my wit end i rememb the lock of hairal
that remain to us of her and leo touch hi breast i drew it
out and compar it with the khania and at the sight of it she becam
quit differ jealou i suppos for it is longer than her and not
in the least like
horac i tell you that the touch of that lock of hairfor she did
touch itappear to act upon her natur like nitric acid upon sham
gold it turn it black all the bad in her came out in her anger her
voic sound coars ye she grew almost vulgar and as you know
when ayesha wa in a rage she might be wick as we understand it and
wa certainli terribl but she wa never either coars or vulgar ani
more than lightn is
well from that moment i wa sure that whoever thi khania mai be she
had noth to do with ayesha thei ar so differ that thei never
could have been the samelik the hair so i lai quiet and let her
talk and coax and threaten on until at length she drew herself up and
march from the room and i heard her lock the door behind her that
all i have to tell you and quit enough too for i dont think that the
khania ha done with me and to sai the truth i am afraid of her
ye i said quit enough now sit still and dont start or talk
loud for that steersman is probabl a spy and i can feel old simbri
ey fix upon our back dont interrupt either for our time alon
mai be short
then i set to work and told him everyth i knew while he listen in
blank astonish
great heaven what a tale he exclaim as i finish now who is
thi hesea who sent the letter from the mountain and who who is the
khania
who doe your instinct tell you that she is leo
amenarta he whisper doubtfulli the woman who wrote the sherd
whom ayesha said wa the egyptian princessmi wife two thousand year
ago amenarta reborn
i nod i think so why not as i have told you again and again i
have alwai been certain of on thing that if we were allow to see
the next act of the piec we should find amenarta or rather the
spirit of amenarta plai a lead part in it you will rememb i
wrote as much in that record
if the old buddhist monk kouen could rememb hi past as thousand
of them swear that thei do and be sure of hi ident continu from
that past why should not thi woman with so much at stake help as
she is by the wizardri of the shaman her uncl faintli rememb her
at ani rate leo why should she not still be suffici under it
influenc to caus her without ani fault or seek of her own to fall
madli in love at first sight with a man whom after all she ha alwai
love
the argument seem sound enough horac and if so i am sorri for the
khania who hasnt much choic in the matterbeen forc into it so to
speak
ye but meanwhil your foot is in a trap again guard yourself
leo guard yourself i believ that thi is a trial sent to you and
doubtless there will be more to follow but i believ also that it would
be better for you to die than to make ani mistak
i know it well he answer and you need not be afraid whatev
thi khania mai have been to me in the pastif she wa anyth at
allthat stori is done with i seek ayesha and ayesha alon and venu
herself shall not tempt me from her
then we began to speak with hope and fear of that mysteri hesea who
had sent the letter from the mountain command the shaman simbri to
meet us the priestess or spirit whom he declar wa mighti from of
old and had servant in the earth and air
present the prow of our barg bump against the bank of the river
and look round i saw that simbri had left the boat in which he sat
and wa prepar to enter our thi he did and place himself
grave on a seat in front of us explain that nightfal wa come
on and he wish to give us hi compani and protect through the
dark
and to see that we do not give him the slip in it mutter leo
then the driver whip up their poni and we went on again
look behind you said simbri present and you will see the citi
where you will sleep tonight
we turn ourselv and there about ten mile awai perceiv a
flatroof town of consider though not of veri great size it
posit wa good for it wa set upon a larg island that stood a
hundr feet or more abov the level of the plain the river divid
into two branch at the foot of it and as we discov afterward
unit again beyond
the vast mound upon which thi citi wa built had the appear of
be artifici but veri possibl the soil whereof it wa form
had been wash up in past ag dure time of flood so that from
a mudbank in the centr of the broad river it grew by degre to it
present proport with the except of a column and tower
edific that crown the citi and seem to be encircl by garden we
could see no great build in the place
how is the citi name ask leo of simbri
kaloon he answer as wa all thi land even when my forefath
the conqueror march across the mountain and took it more than two
thousand year ago thei kept the ancient titl but the territori
of the mountain thei call he becaus thei said that the loop upon
yonder peak wa the symbol of a goddess of thi name whom their gener
worship
priestess still live there do thei not said leo try in hi
turn to extract the truth
ye and priest also the colleg of them wa establish by the
conqueror who subdu all the land or rather it took the place of
anoth colleg of those who fashion the sanctuari and the templ
whose god wa the fire in the mountain as it is that of the peopl of
kaloon todai
then who is worship there now
the goddess he it is said but we know littl of the matter for
between us and the mountain folk there ha been enmiti for ag thei
kill us and we kill them for thei ar jealou of their shrine which
none mai visit save by permiss to consult the oracl and to make
prayer or offer in time of calam when a khan di or the water
of the river sink and the crop fail or when ash fall and earthquak
shake the land or great sick come otherwis unless thei attack
us we leav them alon for though everi man is train to arm and
can fight if need be we ar a peac folk who cultiv the soil
from gener to gener and thu grow rich look round you is it
not a scene of peac
we stood up in the boat and gaze about us at the pastor prospect
everywher appear herd of cattl feed upon meadow land or troop
of mule and hors or squar field sown with corn and outlin by
tree villag folk also clad in long grei gown were labour on
the land or their dai toil finish drive their beast homeward
along road built upon the bank of the irrig dyke toward the
hamlet that were place on rise knoll amidst tall poplar grove
in it sharp contrast with the arid desert and fear mountain
amongst which we had wander for so mani year thi countri struck us
as most charm and inde seen by the red light of the sink sun
on that spring dai even as beauti with the same kind of beauti
which is to be found in holland on could understand too that these
landown and peasantfarm would by choic be men of peac and what
a temptat their wealth must offer to the hungri halfsavag tribe
of the mountain
also it wa easi to guess when the survivor of alexand legion
under their egyptian gener burst through the iron band of snowclad
hill and saw thi sweet countri with it home it herd and it
ripen grass that thei must have cri with on voic we will march
and fight and toil no more here we will sit us down to live and die
thu doubtless thei did take them wive from among the women of the
peopl of the land which thei had conqueredperhap after a singl
battl
now as the light fade the wreath of smoke which hung over the distant
firemountain began to glow luridli redder and more angri did thei
becom while the dark gather till at length thei seem to be
charg with puls sheet of flame propel from the womb of the
volcano which threw pierc beam of light through the ey of the
giant loop that crown it brow far far fled those beam make
a bright path across the land and strike the white crest of the
border wall of mountain high in the air ran that path over the
dim roof of the citi of kaloon over the river ye straight abov
us over the mountain and doubtlessthough there we could not follow
themacross the desert to that high emin on it farther side
where we had lain bath in their radianc it wa a wondrou and most
impress sight on too that fill our companion with fear for the
steersmen in our boat and the driver on the towingpath groan aloud
and began to utter prayer what do thei sai ask leo of simbri
thei sai lord that the spirit of the mountain is angri and pass
down yonder fly light that is call the road of he to work some
evil to our land therefor thei prai her not to destroi them
then doe that light not alwai shine thu he ask again
nai but seldom onc about three month ago and now tonight but
befor that not for year let us prai that it portend no misfortun to
kaloon and it inhabit
for some minut thi fearsom illumin continu then it ceas
as suddenli as it had begun and there remain of it onli the dull glow
abov the crest of the peak
present the moon rose a white shine ball and by it rai we
perceiv that we drew near to the citi but there wa still someth
left for us to see befor we reach it shelter while we sat quietli
in the boatfor the silenc wa broken onli by the lap of the still
water against it side and the occasion splash of the slacken
towlin upon their surfacew heard a distant sound as of a hunt in
full cry
nearer and nearer it came it volum swell everi moment till it
wa quit close at last now echo from the trodden earth of the
towingpathnot that on which our poni travel but the other on
the west bank of the riverwa heard the beat of the hoof of a hors
gallop furious present it appear a fine white anim on the
back of which sat a man it pass us like a flash but as he went by
the man lift himself and turn hi head so that we saw hi face in
the moonlight saw also the agoni of fear that wa written on it and in
hi ey
he had come out of the dark he wa gone into the dark but
after him swell that aw music look a dog appear a huge red
dog that drop it foam muzzl to the ground as it gallop then
lift it and utter a deepthroat belllik bai other follow
and yet other in all there must have been a hundr of them everi on
bai as it took the scent
the deathhound i mutter clasp leo by the arm
ye he answer thei ar run that poor devil here come the
huntsman
as he spoke there appear a second figur splendidli mount a cloak
stream from hi shoulder and in hi hand a long whip which he
wave he wa big but loos joint and as he pass he turn hi
face also and we saw that it wa that of a madman there could be
no doubt of it insan blaze in those hollow ey and rang in that
savag screech laugh
the khan the khan said simbri bow and i could see that he wa
afraid
now he too wa gone and after him came hi guard i count eight of
them all carri whip with which thei flog their hors
what doe thi mean friend simbri i ask as the sound grew faint
in the distanc
it mean friend holli he answer that the khan doe justic in
hi own fashionhunt to death on that ha anger him
what then is hi crime and who is that poor man
he is a great lord of thi land on of the royal kinsmen and the
crime for which he ha been condemn is that he told the khania he
love her and offer to make war upon her husband and kill him if she
would promis herself to him in marriag but she hate the man as she
hate all men and brought the matter befor the khan that is all the
stori
happi is that princ who ha so virtuou a wife i could not help
sai unctuous but with mean and the old wretch of a shaman
turn hi head at my word and began to stroke hi white beard
it wa but a littl while afterward that onc more we heard the bai
of the deathhound ye thei were head straight for us thi time
across countri again the white hors and it rider appear utterli
exhaust both of them for the poor beast could scarc struggl on
to the towingpath as it gain it a great red hound with a black ear
grip it flank and at the touch of the fang it scream aloud in
terror as onli a hors can the rider sprang from it back and to our
horror ran to the river edg think evid to take refug in
our boat but befor ever he reach the water the devilish brute were
upon him
what follow i will not describ but never shall i forget the scene of
those two heap of worri wolv and of the maniac khan who yell
in hi fiendish joi and cheer on hi deathhound to finish their red
work
chapter ix
the court of kaloon
horrifi sick at heart we continu our journei no wonder that the
khania hate such a mad despot and thi woman wa in love with leo
and thi lunat khan her husband wa a victim to jealousi which he
aveng after the veri unpleas fashion that we had wit truli
an agreeabl prospect for all of us yet i could not help reflect
as an object lesson that horrid scene had it advantag
now we reach the place where the river fork at the end of the
island and disembark upon a quai here a guard of men command by
some household offic wa wait to receiv us thei led us through
a gate in the high wall for the town wa fortifi up a narrow
stonepav street which ran between hous appar of the usual
central asian type and so far as i could judg by moonlight with no
pretens to architectur beauti and not larg in size
clearli our arriv wa expect and excit interest for peopl were
gather in knot about the street to watch us pass also at the window
of the hous and even on their flat roof at the top of the long
street wa a sort of market place cross which accompani by a
curiou crowd who made remark about us that we could not understand we
reach a gate in an inner wall here we were challeng but at a
word from simbri it open and we pass through to find ourselv in
garden follow a road or drive we came to a larg rambl hous
or palac surmount by high tower and veri solidli built of stone in
a heavi bastard egyptian style
beyond it doorwai we found ourselv in a courtyard surround by a
kind of verandah from which short passag led to differ room down
on of these passag we were conduct by the offic to an apart
or rather a suit consist of a sit and two bedchamb
which were panel richli furnish in rather barbar fashion and
welllight with primit oil lamp
here simbri left us sai that the offic would wait in the outer
room to conduct us to the dininghal as soon as we were readi then
we enter the bedchamb where we found servant or slave
quietmann obsequi men these valet chang our footgear
and take off our heavi travel robe replac them with other
fashion like civil frockcoat but made of some white materi
and trim with a beauti ermin fur
have dress us in these thei bow to show that our toilett wa
finish and led us to the larg outer room where the offic await
us he conduct us through sever other room all of them spaciou
and appar unoccupi to a great hall lit with mani lamp and
warmedfor the night were still coldwith larg peat fire the roof
of thi hall wa flat and support by thick stone column with carv
capit and it wall were hung with work tapestri that gave it
an air of consider comfort
at the head of the hall on a dai stood a long narrow tabl spread
with a cloth and set with platter and cup of silver here we wait
till butler with wand appear through some curtain which thei drew
then came a man beat a silver gong and after him a dozen or more
courtier all dress in white robe like ourselv follow by
perhap as mani ladi some of them young and goodlook and for
the most part of a fair type with wellcut featur though other were
rather yellowskin thei bow to us and we to them
then there wa a paus while we studi on anoth till a trumpet blew
and herald by footmen in a kind of yellow liveri two figur were
seen advanc down the passag beyond the curtain preced by the
shaman simbri and follow by other offic thei were the khan and the
khania of kaloon
no on look at thi khan as he enter hi dininghal clad in festal
white attir would have imagin him to be the same rave human
brute whom we had just seen urg on hi devilish hound to tear a
fellowcreatur and a helpless hors to fragment and devour them now
he seem a heavi loutish man veri strongli built and not illlook
but with shifti ey evid a person of dull intellect whom on
would have thought incap of keen emot of ani kind the khania
need not be describ she wa as she had been in the chamber of the
gate onli more weari look inde her ey had a haunt air and
it wa easi to see that the event of the previou night had left
their mark upon her mind at the sight of us she flush a littl then
beckon to us to advanc and said to her husbandmi lord these ar
the stranger of whom i have told you
hi dull ey fell upon me first and my appear seem to amus him
vagu at ani rate he laugh rude sai in barbar greek mix
with word from the local patoiswhat a curiou old anim i have
never seen you befor have i
no great khan i answer but i have seen you out hunt thi
night did you have good sport
instantli he becam wide awak and answer rub hi
handsexcel he gave us a fine run but my littl dog caught him
at last and then and he snap hi power jaw togeth
ceas your brutal talk broke in hi wife fierc and he slunk awai
from her and in so do stumbl against leo who wa wait to be
present to him
the sight of thi great goldenbeard man seem to astonish him for
he stare at him then askedar you the khania other friend
whom she went to see in the mountain of the gate then i could not
understand why she took so much troubl but now i do well be care
or i shall have to hunt you also
now leo grew angri and wa about to repli but i laid my hand upon hi
arm and said in englishdont answer the man is mad
bad you mean grumbl leo and if he tri to set hi curs dog
on me i will break hi neck
then the khania motion to leo to take a seat besid her place me
upon her other hand between herself and her uncl the guardian while
the khan shuffl to a chair a littl wai down the tabl where he
call two of the prettiest ladi to keep him compani
such wa our introduct to the court of kaloon as for the meal that
follow it wa veri plenti but coars consist for the most
part of fish mutton and sweetmeat all of them present upon huge
silver platter also much strong drink wa serv a kind of spirit
distil from grain of which nearli all present drank more than wa
good for them after a few word to me about our journei the khania
turn to leo and talk to him for the rest of the even while i
devot myself to the old shaman simbri
put briefli the substanc of what i learn from him then and
afterward wa as followstrad wa unknown to the peopl of kaloon
for the reason that all commun with the south had been cut off
for ag the bridg that onc exist over the chasm have been
allow to rot awai their land which wa veri larg and dens
inhabit wa ring round with unclimb mountain except to the
north where stood the great firepeak the slope of thi peak and an
unvisit expans of countri behind that ran up to the confin of
a desert were the home of feroci mountain tribe untam
highland who kill everi stranger thei caught consequ
although the preciou and other metal were mine to a certain extent
and manufactur into articl of us and ornament monei did not exist
among the peopl either of the plain or of the mountain all busi
be transact on the principl of barter and even the revenu
collect in kind
amongst the ten of thousand of the aborigin of kaloon dwelt a
mere hand of a rule class who were said to beand probabl
weredescend from the conqueror that appear in the time of
alexand their blood howev wa now much mix with that of the
first inhabit who to judg from their appear and the yellow
hue of their descend must have belong to some branch of the great
tartar race the govern if so it could be call wa on the
whole of a mild though of a veri despot natur and vest in an
hereditari khan or khania accord as a man or a woman might be in the
most direct descent
of religion there were two that of the peopl who worship the
spirit of the fire mountain and that of the ruler who believ in
magic ghost and divin even thi shadow of a religion if so
it can be call wa dy out like it follow for gener by
gener the white lord grew less in number or becam absorb in
the bulk of the peopl
still their rule wa toler i ask simbri why see that thei
were so few he shrug hi shoulder and answer becaus it suit
the countri of which the nativ had no ambit moreov the present
khania our hostess wa the last of the direct line of ruler her
husband and cousin have less of the blood royal in hi vein and as
such the peopl were attach to her
also as is commonli the case with bold and beauti women she wa
popular among them especi as she wa just and veri liber to
the poor these were mani as the countri wa overpopul which
account for it wonder state of cultiv lastli thei trust to
her skill and courag to defend them from the continu attack of the
mountain tribe who raid their crop and herd their on grievanc
against her wa that she had no child to whom the khanship could
descend which meant that after her death as had happen after that of
her father there would be struggl for the success
inde ad simbri with mean and glanc at leo out of the
corner of hi ey the folk sai openli that it would be a good thing
if the khan who oppress them and whom thei hate should die so that
the khania might take anoth husband while she is still young although
he is mad he know thi and that is why he is so jealou of ani lord
who look at her as friend holli you saw tonight for should such an
on gain her favour rassen think that it would mean hi death
also he mai be attach to hi wife i suggest speak in a
whisper
perhap so answer simbri but if so she love not him nor ani of
these men and he glanc round the hall
certainli thei did not look lovabl for by thi time most of them were
half drunk while even the women seem to have taken as much as wa
good for them the khan himself present a sorri spectacl for he wa
lean back in hi chair shout someth about hi hunt in a
thick voic the arm of on of hi pretti companion wa round hi neck
while the other gave him to drink from a gold cup some of the content
of which had been spilt down hi white robe
just then aten look round and saw him and an express of hatr and
contempt gather on her beauti face
see i heard her sai to leo see the companion of my dai and learn
what it is to be khania of kaloon
then why do you not cleans your court he ask
becaus lord if i did so there would be no court left swine will to
their mire and these men and women who live in idl upon the toil
of the humbl folk will to their liquor and vile luxuri well the end
is near for it is kill them and their children ar but few weakli
also for the ancient blood grow thin and stale but you ar weari and
would rest tomorrow we will ride togeth and call to an offic
she bade him conduct us to our room
so we rose and accompani by simbri bow to her and went she
stand and gaze after us a royal and pathet figur in the midst
of all that dissolut revelri the khan rose also and in hi cun
fashion understood someth of the mean of it all
you think us gai he shout and why should we not be who do not
know how long we have to live but you yellowhair fellow you must
not let aten look at you like that i tell you she is my wife and if
you do i shall certainli have to hunt you
at thi drunken salli the courtier roar with laughter but take leo
by the arm simbri hurri him from the hall
friend said leo when we were outsid it seem to me that thi khan
of your threaten my life
have no fear lord answer the guardian so long as the khania doe
not threaten it you ar safe she is the real ruler of thi land and i
stand next to her
then i prai you said leo keep me out of the wai of that drunken
man for look you if i am attack i defend myself
and who can blame you simbri repli with on of hi slow mysteri
smile
then we part and have place both our bed in on chamber slept
soundli enough for we were veri tire till we were awaken in the
morn by the bai of those horribl deathhound be fed i
suppos in a place nearbi
now in thi citi of kaloon it wa our weari destini to dwell for three
long month on of the most hate time perhap that we ever pass
in all our live inde compar to it our endless wander amid the
central asia snow and desert were but pleasur pilgrimag and our
stai at the monasteri beyond the mountain a sojourn in paradis to set
out it record in full would be both tediou and useless so i will onli
tell briefli of our princip adventur
on the morrow of our arriv the khania aten sent us two beauti
white hors of pure and ancient blood and at noon we mount them and
went out to ride with her accompani by a guard of soldier first she
led us to the kennel where the deathhound were kept great flag
court surround by iron bar in which were narrow lock gate
never had i seen brute so larg and fierc the mastiff of thibet were
but as lapdog compar to them thei were red and black smoothcoat
and with a bloodhound head and the moment thei saw us thei came
raven and leap at the bar as an angri wave leap against a rock
these hound were in the charg of men of certain famili who had
tend them for gener thei obei their keeper and the khan
readili enough but no stranger might ventur near them also these
brute were the execution of the land for to them all murder and
other crimin were thrown and with them as we had seen the khan
hunt ani who had incur hi displeasur moreov thei were us
for a more innoc purpos the chase of certain great buck which
were preserv in wood and swamp of reed thu it came about that
thei were a terror to the countri sinc no man knew but what in the
end he might be devour by them go to the dog is a term full
of mean in ani land but in kaloon it had a signific that wa
terribl
after we had look at the hound not without a prophet shudder
we rode round the wall of the town which were laid out as a kind of
boulevard where the inhabit walk and took their pleasur in the
even on these howev there wa not much to see except the river
beneath and the plain beyond moreov though thei were thick and
high there were place in them that must be pass carefulli for like
everyth els with which the effet rule class had to do thei had
been allow to fall into disrepair
the town itself wa an uninterest place also for the most part
peopl by hangerson of the court so we were not sorri when we cross
the river by a highpitch bridg where in dai to come i wa destin
to behold on of the strangest sight ever seen by mortal man and rode
out into the countri here all wa differ for we found ourselv
among the husbandmen who were the descend of the origin owner of
the land and live upon it produc everi avail inch of soil seem
to be cultiv by the aid of a wonder system of irrig inde
water wa lift to level where it would not flow natur by mean
of wheel turn with mule or even in some place carri up by the
women who bore pole on their shoulder to which were balanc bucket
leo ask the khania what happen if there wa a bad season she
repli grimli that famin happen in which thousand of peopl
perish and that after the famin came pestil these famin were
period and were it not for them she ad the peopl would long
ago have been driven to kill each other like hungri rat sinc have
no outlet and increas so rapidli the land larg as it wa could
not hold them all
will thi be a good year i ask
it is fear not she answer for the river ha not risen well and
but few rain have fallen also the light that shone last night on the
firemountain is thought a bad omen which mean thei sai that the
spirit of the mountain is angri and that drought will follow let us
hope thei will not sai also that thi is becaus stranger have visit
the land bring with them bad luck
if so said leo with a laugh we shall have to fly to the mountain to
take refug there
do you then wish to take refug in death she ask darkli of thi
be sure my guest that never while i live shall you be allow to
cross the river which border the slope of yonder peak
why not khania
becaus my lord leothat is your name is it notsuch is my will
and while i rule here my will is law come let us turn homeward
that night we did not eat in the great hall but in the room which
adjoin our bedchamb we were not left alon howev for the
khania and her uncl the shaman who alwai attend her join our
meal when we greet them wonder she said briefli that it wa
arrang thu becaus she refus to expos us to more insult she
ad that a festiv had begun which would last for a week and that
she did not wish us to see how vile were the wai of her peopl
that even and mani other which follow itw never dine in the
central hall againpass pleasantli enough for the khania made leo
tell her of england where he wa born and of the land that he had
visit their peopl and custom i spoke also of the histori of
alexand whose gener rassen her faroff forefath conquer the
countri of kaloon and of the land of egypt whenc the latter came and
so it went on till midnight while aten listen to us greedili her
ey fix alwai on leo face
mani such night did we spend thu in the palac of the citi of kaloon
where in fact we were close prison but oh the dai hung heavi
on our hand if we went into the courtyard or recept room of the
palac the lord and their follow gather round us and pester us
with question for be veri idl thei were also veri curiou
also the women some of whom were fair enough began to talk to us on
thi pretext or on that and did their best to make love to leo for
in contrast with their slim delicatelook men thei found thi
deepchest yellowhair stranger to their tast inde thei
troubl him much with gift of flower and messag sent by servant or
soldier make assign with him which of cours he did not keep
if we went out into the street matter were as bad for then the
peopl ceas from their busi such as it wa and follow us
about stare at us till we took refug again in the palac garden
there remain therefor onli our ride in the countri with the
khania but after three or four of them these came to an end ow to
the jealousi of the khan who vow that if we went out togeth ani
more he would follow with the deathhound so we must ride alon if at
all in the centr of a larg guard of soldier sent to see that we did
not attempt to escap and accompani veri often by a mob of peasant
who with threat and entreati demand that we should give back the
rain which thei said we had taken from them for now the great drought
had begun in earnest
thu it came about that at length our onli resourc wa make pretenc
to fish in the river where the water wa so clear and low that we could
catch noth watch the while the firemountain that loom in the
distanc mysteri and unreach and vainli rack our brain for
plan to escap thither or at least to commun with it priestess
of whom we could learn no more
for two great burden lai upon our soul the burden of desir to
continu our search and to meet with it reward which we were sure that
we should pluck amid the snow of yonder peak if we could but come
there and the burden of approach catastroph at the hand of the
khania aten she had made no love to leo sinc that night in the
gatewai and inde even if she had wish to thi would have been
difficult sinc i took care that he wa never left for on hour alon
no duenna could have clung to a spanish princess more close than i did
to leo yet i could see well that her passion wa no whit abat
that it grew dai by dai inde as the fire swell in the heart of a
volcano and that soon it must break loos and spread it ruin round
the omen of it wa to be read in her word her gestur and her tragic
ey
chapter x
in the shaman chamber
on night simbri ask us to dine with him in hi own apart in the
highest tower of the palacehad we but known it for us a fate place
inde for here the last act of the mighti drama wa destin to be
fulfil so we went glad enough of ani chang when we had eaten leo
grew veri thought then said suddenlyfriend simbri i wish to ask
a favour of youthat you will beg the khania to let us go our wai
instantli the shaman cun old face becam like a mask of ivori
sure you had better ask your favour of the ladi herself lord i do
not think that ani in reason will be refus to you he repli
let us stop fenc said leo and consid the fact it ha seem
to me that the khania aten is not happi with her husband
your ey ar veri keen lord and who shall sai that thei have
deceiv you
it ha seem further went on leo redden that she ha been so
good as to look on me withsom undeserv regard
ah perhap you guess that in the gatehous yonder if you have not
forgotten what most men would rememb
i rememb certain thing simbri that have to do with her and you
the shaman onli stroke hi beard and said proce
there is littl to add simbri except that i am not mind to bring
scandal on the name of the first ladi in your land
nobli said lord nobli said though here thei do not troubl much
about such thing but how if the matter could be manag without
scandal if for instanc the khania chose to take anoth husband the
whole land would rejoic for she is the last of her royal race
how can she take anoth husband when she ha on live
true inde that is a question which i have consid but the answer
to it is that men die it is the common lot and the khan ha been
drink veri heavili of late
you mean that men can be murder said leo angrili well i will
have noth to do with such a crime do you understand me
as the word pass hi lip i heard a rustl and turn my head behind
us were curtain beyond which the shaman slept kept hi instrument of
divin and work out hi horoscop now thei had been drawn and
between them in her royal arrai stood the khania still as a statu
who wa it that spoke of crime she ask in a cold voic wa it
you my lord leo
rise from hi chair he face her and saidladi i am glad that you
have heard my word even if thei should vex you
why should it vex me to learn that there is on honest man in thi
court who will have naught to do with murder nai i honour you for
those word know also that no such foul thought have come near to me
yet leo vincei that which is writteni written
doubtless khania but what is written
tell him shaman
now simbri pass behind the curtain and return thenc with a roll
from which he read the heaven have declar by their sign infal
that befor the next new moon the khan rassen will lie dead at the
hand of the stranger lord who came to thi countri from across the
mountain
then the heaven have declar a lie said leo contemptu
that is as you will answer aten but so it must befal not by my
hand or those of my servant but by your and then
why by mine why not by holli yet if so then doubtless i shall
suffer the punish of my crime at the hand of hi mourn widow
he repli exasper
you ar pleas to mock me leo vincei well know what a husband
thi man is to me
now i felt that the crisi had come and so did leo for he look her
in the face and saidspeak on ladi sai all you wish perhap it will
be better for us both
i obei you lord of the begin of thi fate i know noth but
i read from the first page that is open to me it ha to do with thi
present life of mine learn leo vincei that from my childhood onward
you have haunt me oh when first i saw you yonder by the river your
face wa not strang to me for i knew iti knew it well in dream
when i wa a littl maid and slept on dai amidst the flower by the
river brim it came first to meask my uncl here if thi be not so
though it is true that your face wa younger then afterward again and
again i saw it in my sleep and learn to know that you were mine for
the magic of my heart taught me thi
then pass the long year while i felt that you were draw near to
me slowli veri slowli but ever draw nearer wend onward and
outward through the peopl of the world across the hill across the
plain across the sand across the snow on to my side at length
came the end for on night not three moon ago whilst thi wise man
my uncl and i sat togeth here studi the lore that he ha taught
me and strive to wring it secret from the past a vision came to me
look you i wa lost in a charm sleep which loos the spirit from
the bodi and give it strength to strai afar and to see those thing
that have been and that ar yet to be then i saw you and your companion
cling to a point of broken ic over the river of the gulf i do not
lie it is written here upon the scroll ye it wa you the man of
my dream and no other and we knew the place and hurri thither and
wait by the water think that perhap beneath it you lai dead
then while we wait lo two tini figur appear far abov upon the
ici tongu that no man mai climb and oh you know the rest spellbound
we stood and saw you slip and hang saw you sever the thin cord and rush
downward ye and saw that brave man holli leap headlong after you
but mine wa the hand that drew you from the torrent where otherwis
you must have drown you the love of the long past and of todai ay
and of all time ye you and no other leo vincei it wa thi spirit
that foresaw your danger and thi hand which deliv you from death
andand would you refus them nowwhen i the khania of kaloon
proffer them to you
so she spoke and lean upon the tabl look up into hi face with
lip that trembl and with appeal ey
ladi said leo you save me and again i thank you though perhap
it would have been better if you had let me drown but forgiv me the
question if all thi tale be true why did you marri anoth man

then i look round and becam awar of anoth presenc for yonder

passion woman bold more who admir littl els about her save

sweet and sound and fair and spend some few month jollili enough man
dont be a fool the cup that is thrust into your hand look

tomorrowthough it be mix with a husband poison blood and
again rassen scream in hi unholi mirth
to all these bitter insult venom with the sting of truth aten
listen without a word then she turn to us and bow
my guest she said i prai you pardon me for all i cannot help you
have strai to a corrupt and evil land and there stand it crown
and flower khan rassen your doom is written and i do not hasten it
becaus onc for a littl while we were near to each other though you
have been naught to me for thi mani a year save a snake that haunt
my hous were it otherwis the next cup you drank should still your
mad and that vile tongu of your which give it venom voic my
uncl come with me your hand for i grow weak with shame and woe
the old shaman hobbl forward but when he came face to face with the
khan he stop and look him up and down with hi dim ey then he
saidrassen i saw you born the son of an evil woman and your father
none knew but i the flame flare that night upon the firemountain and
the star hid their face for none of them would own you no not even
those of the most evil influenc i saw you wed and rise drunken from
your marriag feast your arm about a wanton neck i have seen you
rule wast the land for your cruel pleasur turn the fertil
field into great park for your game leav those who till them to
starv upon the road or drown themselv in ditch for veri miseri
and soon soon i shall see you die in pain and blood and then the chain
will fall from the neck of thi nobl ladi whom you revil and anoth
more worthi shall take your place and rear up children to fill your
throne and the land shall have rest again
now i listen to these wordsand none who did not hear them can guess
the fear bitter with which thei were spokenexpect everi
moment that the khan would draw the short sword at hi side and cut the
old man down but he did not he cower befor him like a dog befor
some savag master the weight of whose whip he know ye answer
noth he shrank into the corner and cower there while simbri
take aten by the hand went from the room at it massiv ironbound
door he turn and point to the crouch figur with hi staff
saidkhan rassen i rais you up and now i cast you down rememb
me when you lie dyingin blood and pain
their footstep di awai and the khan crept from hi corner look
about him furtiv
have that rat and the other gone he ask of us wipe hi damp brow
with hi sleev and i saw that fear had sober him and that for awhil
the mad had left hi ey
i answer that thei had gone
you think me a coward he went on passion and it is true i am
afraid of him and hera you yellowbeard will be afraid when your
turn come i tell you that thei sap my strength and craze me with
their drug drink make me the thing i am for who can war against
their wizardri look you now onc i wa a princ the lord of half
thi land nobl of form and upright of heart and i love her accurs
beauti as all must love it on whom she turn her ey and she turn
them on me she sought me in marriag it wa that old rat who bore
her messag
so i stai the great war and marri the khania and becam the khan
but better had it been for me if i had crept into her kitchen as a
scullion than into her chamber as a husband for from the first she
hate me and the more i love the more she hate till at our wed
feast she doctor me with that poison which made me loath her and
thu divorc us which made me mad also eat into my brain like
fire
if she hate you so sore khan i ask why did she not mix a
stronger draught and have done with you
why becaus of polici for i rule half the land becaus it suit
her also that i should live on a thing to mock at sinc while i wa
aliv no other husband could be forc upon her by the peopl for
she is not a woman she is a witch who desir to live alon or so i
thought until tonightand he glower at leo
she knew also that although i must shrink from her i still love her in
my heart and can still be jealou and therefor that i should protect
her from all men it wa she who set me on that lord whom my dog tore
awhil ago becaus he wa power and sought her favour and would not
be deni but now and again he glower at leo now i know why she
ha alwai seem so cold it is becaus there live a man to melt whose
ic she husband her fire
then leo who all thi while had stood silent step forward
listen khan he said did the ic seem like melt a littl while
ago
nounless you li but that wa onli becaus the fire is not yet hot
enough wait awhil until it burn up and melt you must for who can
match hi will against aten
and what if the ic desir to flee the fire khan thei said that i
should kill you but i do not seek your blood you think that i would
rob you of your wife yet i have no such thought toward her we desir
to escap thi town of your but cannot becaus it gate ar lock
and we ar prison guard night and dai hear me then you have the
power to set us free and to be rid of us
the khan look at him cunningli and if i set you free whither would
you go you could tumbl down yonder gorg but onli the bird can climb
it height
to the firemountain where we have busi
rassen stare at him
is it i who am mad or ar you who wish to visit the firemountain
yet that is noth to me save that i do not believ you but if so
you might return again and bring other with you perchanc have
it ladi you wish thi land also by right of conquest it ha foe up
yonder
it is not so answer leo earnestli as on man to anoth i tell
you it is not so i ask no smile of your wife and no acr of your
soil be wise and help us to be gone and live on undisturb in such
fashion as mai pleas you
the khan stood still awhil swing hi long arm vacantli till
someth seem to come into hi mind that move him to merriment for
he burst into on of hi hideou laugh
i am think he said what aten would sai if she woke up to find
her sweet bird flown she would search for you and be angri with me
it seem that she cannot be angrier than she is i answer give us
a night start and let her search never so close she shall not find
us
you forget wander that she and her old rat have art those who
knew where to meet you might know where to seek you and yet and yet
it would be rare to see her rage oh yellowbeard where ar you
yellowbeard he went on mimick hi wife voic come back and
let me melt your ic yellowbeard
again he laugh then said suddenlywhen can you be readi
in half an hour i answer
good go to your chamber and prepar i will join you there
present
so we went

and drank what we could of the victual which stood in the antechamb
not know when we should find more food and fill two satchel such
as these peopl sling about their shoulder with the remain of the
meat and liquor and a few necessari also we strap our big hunt
knive about our middl and arm ourselv with short spear that were
made for the stab of game
perhap he ha laid a plot to murder us and we mai as well defend
ourselv while we can suggest leo
i nod for the echo of the khan last laugh still rang in my ear
it wa a veri evil laugh
like enough i said i do not trust that insan brute still he
wish to be rid of us
ye but as he said live men mai return wherea the dead do not
aten think otherwis i comment
and yet she threaten us with death answer leo
becaus her shame and passion make her mad i repli after which we
were silent
present the door open and through it came the khan muffl in a
great cloak as though to disguis himself
come he said if you ar readi then catch sight of the spear
we held he ad you will not need those thing you do not go
ahunt
no i answer but who can sayw might be hunt
if you believ that perhap you had best stai where you ar till the
khania weari of yellowbeard and open the gate for you he repli
ey me with hi cun glanc
i think not i said and we start the khan lead the wai and
motion us to be silent
we pass through the empti room on to the verandah and from the
verandah down into the courtyard where he whisper to us to keep in
the shadow for the moon shone veri clearli that night so clearli i
rememb that i could see the grass which grew between the joint of
the pavement and the littl shadow thrown by each separ blade upon
the worn surfac of it stone now i wonder how we should pass the
gate for there a guard wa station which had of late been doubl by
order of the khania but thi gate we left upon our right take a path
that led into the great wall garden where rassen brought us to a
door hidden behind a clump of shrub which he unlock with a kei he
carri
now we were outsid the palac wall and our road ran past the kennel
as we went by these the great sleepless deathhound that wander
to and fro like prowl lion caught our wind and burst into a sudden
choru of terrif bai i shiver at the sound for it wa fear in
that silenc also i thought that it would arous the keeper but the
khan went to the bar and show himself whereon the brute which knew
him ceas their nois
fear not he said as he return the huntsmen know that thei ar
starv tonight for tomorrow certain crimin will be thrown to
them
now we had reach the palac gate here the khan bade us hide in an
archwai and depart we look at each other for the same thought wa
in both our mindsthat he had gone to fetch the murder who were to
make an end of us but in thi we did him wrong for present we heard
the sound of hors hoof upon the stone and he return lead the
two white steed that aten had given us
i saddl them with my own hand he whisper who can do more to
speed the part guest now mount hide your face in your cloak as i
do and follow me
so we mount and he trot befor us like a run footman such as
the great lord of kaloon emploi when thei went about their busi
or their pleasur leav the main street he led us through a quarter
of the town that had an evil reput and down it tortuou bywai
here we met a few revel while from time to time nightbird flit
from the doorwai and throw asid their veil look at us but
as we made no sign drew back again think that we pass to some
assign we reach the desert dock upon the river edg
and came to a littl quai alongsid of which a broad ferryboat wa
fasten
you must put your hors into it and row across rassen said for
the bridg ar guard and without discov myself i cannot bid the
soldier to let you pass
so with some littl troubl we urg the hors into the boat where i
held them by their bridl while leo took the oar
now go your wai accurs wander cri the khan as he thrust us
from the quai and prai the spirit of the mountain that the old rat and
hi pupilyour love yellowbeard your lovear not watch you in
their magic glass for if so we mai meet again
then as the stream caught us sweep the boat out toward the centr
of the river he began to laugh that horribl laugh of hi call
after usrid fast ride fast for safeti stranger there is death
behind
leo put out hi strength and back water so that the punt hung upon
the edg of the stream
i think that we should do well to land again and kill that man for he
mean mischief he said
he spoke in english but rassen must have caught the ring of hi
voic and guess it mean with the cun of the mad at least he
shoutedtoo late fool and with a last laugh turn ran so
swiftli up the quai that hi cloak flew out upon the air behind him and
vanish into the shadow at it head
row on i said and leo bent himself to the oar
but the ferryboat wa cumbersom and the current swift so that we were
swept down a long wai befor we could cross it at length we reach
still water near the further shore and see a landingplac manag
to beach the punt and to drag our hors to the bank then leav the
craft to drift for we had no time to scuttl her we look to our
girth and bridl and mount head toward the far column of
glow smoke which show like a beacon abov the summit of the hous
of fire
at first our progress wa veri slow for here there seem to be no
path and we were oblig to pick our wai across the field and to
search for bridg that span such of the waterditch as were too
wide for us to jump more than an hour wa spent in thi work till we
came to a villag wherein none were stir and here struck a
road which seem to run toward the mountain though as we learn
afterward it took us veri mani mile out of our true path now for the
first time we were abl to canter and push on at some speed though
not too fast for we wish to spare our hors and fear lest thei
might fall in the uncertain light
a while befor dawn the moon sank behind the mountain and the gloom
grew so dens that we were forc to stop which we did hold the
hors by their bridl and allow them to graze a littl on some
young corn then the sky turn grei the light fade from the column
of smoke that wa our guid the dawn came blush red upon the vast
snow of the distant peak and shoot it arrow through the loop
abov the pillar we let the hors drink from a channel that water
the corn and mount them rode onward slowli
now with the shadow of the night a weight of fear seem to be lift
off our heart and we grew hope ay almost joyou that hate citi
wa behind us behind us were the khania with her surg doomdriven
passion and her stormi loveli the wizardri of her hornyei
mentor so old in year and secret sin and the mad of that strang
be halfdevil halfmartyr at onc cruel and a cowardth khan
her husband and hi pollut court in front lai the fire the snow and
the mysteri thei hid sought for so mani empti year now we would solv
it or we would die so we press forward joyfulli to meet our fate
whatev it might be
for mani hour our road ran devious through cultiv land where the
peasant at their labour laid down their tool and gather into knot
to watch us pass and quaint flatroof villag whenc the women
snatch up their children and fled at the sight of us thei believ us
to be lord from the court who came to work them some harm in person or
in properti and their terror told us how the countri smart beneath
the rod of the oppressor by middai although the peak seem to be
but littl nearer the charact of the land had chang now it slope
gentli upward and therefor could not be irrig
evid all thi great district wa depend on the fall of
time rain which had not come that spring therefor although the
popul wa still dens and everi rod of the land wa under the
plough or spade the crop were fail it wa piti to see the
green unear corn alreadi turn yellow becaus of the lack of
moistur the beast search the starv pastur for food and the
poor husbandmen wander about their field or strive to hoe the iron
soil
here the peopl seem to know us as the two foreign whose come had
been nois abroad and the fear of famin have made them bold thei
shout at us as we went by to give them back the rain which we had
stolen or so we understood their word even the women and the children
in the villag prostrat themselv befor us point first to the
mountain and then to the hard blue sky and cry to us to send them
rain onc inde we were threaten by a mob of peasant arm with
spade and reapinghook who seem inclin to bar our path so that
we were oblig to put our hors to a gallop and pass through them
with a rush as we went forward the countri grew ever more arid and it
inhabit more scarc till we saw no man save a few wander herd
who drove their cattl from place to place in search of provend
by even we guess that we had reach that border tract which wa
harri by the mountain tribe for here strong tower built of stone
were dot about the heath doubtless to serv as watchhous or
place of refug whether thei were garrison by soldier i do not
know but i doubt it for we saw none it seem probabl inde that
these fort were relic of dai when the land of kaloon wa guard from
attack by ruler of a veri differ charact to that of the present
khan and hi immedi predecessor
at length even the watchtow were left behind and by sundown we
found ourselv upon a vast uninhabit plain where we could see
no live thing now we made up our mind to rest our hors awhil
propos to push forward again with the moon for have the wrath
of the khania behind us we did not dare to linger by thi even
doubtless she would have discov our escap sinc befor sundown as
she had decre leo must make hi choic and give hi answer then
as we were sure she would strike swiftli perhap her messeng
were alreadi at their work rous the countri to captur us and her
soldier follow on our path
we unsaddl the hors and let them refresh themselv by roll
on the sandi soil and graze after a fashion upon the coars tuft of
wither herbag which grew around there wa no water here but thi
did not so much matter for both thei and we had drunk at a littl muddi
pool we found not more than an hour befor we were finish our meal
of the food that we had brought with us which inde we need sore
after our sleepless night and long dai journei when my hors which
wa kneehalt close at hand lai down to roll again thi it could
not do with eas becaus of the rope about it foreleg and i watch
it effort idli till at length at the fourth attempt after hang
for a few second upon it back it leg stick straight into the
air it fell over slowli toward me as hors do
why ar it hoof so red ha it cut itself ask leo in an
indiffer voic
as it chanc i also had just notic thi red ting and for the first
time sinc it wa most distinct about the anim frog which until
it roll thu i had not seen so i rose to look at them think that
probabl the even light had deceiv us or that we might have pass
through some ruddycolour mud sure enough thei were red as though
a dye had soak into the horn and the substanc of the frog what wa
more thei gave out a pungent aromat smell that wa unpleas such
a smell as might aris from blood mix with musk and spice
it is veri strang i said let us look at your beast leo
so we did and found that it hoof had been similarlytr
perhap it is a nativ mixtur to preserv the horn suggest leo
i thought awhil then a terribl idea struck me
i dont want to frighten you i said but i think that we had better
saddl up and get on
why he ask
becaus i believ that villain of a khan ha doctor our hors
what for to make them go lame
no leo to make them leav a strong scent upon dry ground
he turn pale do you meanthos hound
i nod then wast no more time in word we saddl up in frantic
hast just as i fasten the last strap of my saddl i thought that a
faint sound reach my ear
listen i said again it came and now there wa no doubt about it it
wa the sound of bai dog
by heaven the deathhound said leo
ye i answer quietli enough for at thi crisi my nerv harden
and all fear left me our friend the khan is out ahunt that is why
he laugh
what shall we do ask leo leav the hors
i look at the peak it nearest flank were mile and mile awai
time enough to do that when we ar forc we can never reach that
mountain on foot and after thei had run down the hors thei would
hunt us by spoor or gaze no man ride as you never rode befor
we sprang to our saddl but befor we gave rein i turn and look
behind me it will be rememb that we had ridden up a long slope
which termin in a ridg about three mile awai the border of the
great plain whereon we stood now the sun had sunk behind that ridg
so that although it wa still light the plain had fallen into shadow
therefor while no distant object could be seen upon the plain
anyth cross the ridg remain visibl enough in that clear air
at least to person of keen sight
thi is what we saw over the ridg pour a multitud of littl
object and amongst the last of these gallop a man mount on a great
hors who led anoth hors by the bridl
all the pack ar out said leo grimli and rassen ha brought a
second mount with him now i see why he want us to leav the spear
and i think he shout as we began to gallop that befor all is done
the shaman mai prove himself a true prophet
awai we sped through the gather dark head straight for the
peak while we went i calcul our chanc our hors as good as ani
in the land were still strong and fresh for although we had ridden
far we had not overpress them and their condit wa excel but
doubtless the deathhound were fresh also for mean to run us down
at night when he thought that he might catch us sleep rassen would
have brought them along easili follow us by inquiri among the
peasant and onli lai them on our spoor after the last villag had
been left behind
also he had two mount and for aught we knewthough afterward thi
prove not to be the case for he wish to work hi wicked alon
and unseenh might be follow by attend with relai therefor it
would appear that unless we reach some place whither he did not dare
to follow befor himthat is the slope of the peak mani mile awai
he must run us down there remain the chanc also that the dog would
tire and refus to pursu the chase
thi howev seem scarc probabl for thei were extraordinarili
swift and strong and so savag that when onc thei had scent blood
in which doubtless our hors hoof were steep thei would fall dead
from exhaust sooner than abandon the trail inde both the khania
and simbri had often told us as much anoth chancethei might lose
the scent but see it natur again thi wa not probabl even an
english pack will carri the trail of a red her breast high without a
fault for hour and here wa someth strongera cun compound of
which the telltal odour would hold for dai a last chanc if we were
forc to abandon our hors we their rider might possibl escap
could we find ani place to hide in on that great plain if not we
should be seen as well as scent and thenno the odd were all
against us but so thei had often been befor meanwhil we had three
mile start and perhap help would come to us from the mountain some
help unforeseen so we set our teeth and sped awai like arrow while the
light last
veri soon it fail and whilst the moon wa hidden behind the mountain
the night grew dark
now the hound gain on us for in the gloom which to them wa
noth we did not dare to ride full speed fear lest our hors
should stumbl and lame themselv or fall then it wa for the second
time sinc we had dwelt in thi land of kaloon that of a sudden the fire
flame upon the peak when we had seen it befor it had appear to
flash across the heaven in on great lighthous rai concentr
through the loop abov the pillar and there thi night also the rai ran
far abov us like a lanc of fire but now that we were nearer to it
fount we found ourselv bath in a soft mysteri radianc like that
of the phosphoresc on a summer sea reflect downward perhap from
the cloud and massi rock roof of the column loop and diffus by the
snow beneath
thi unearthli glimmer faint as it wa help us much inde but for
it we must have been overtaken for here the ground wa veri rough full
of hole also made by burrow marmot thu in our extrem help did
come to us from the mountain until at length the moon rose when as
quickli as thei had appear the volcan fire vanish leav behind
them noth but the accustom pillar of dull red smoke
it is a commonplac to speak of the music of hound at chase but often
i have wonder how that music sound in the ear of the deer or the fox
flee for it life
now when we fill the place of the quarri it wa my destini to solv
thi problem and i assert with confid that the progeni of earth
can produc no more hideou nois it had come near to us and in the
desol silenc of the night the hellish harmoni of it volum
seem terrif yet i could discern the separ note of which it wa
compos especi on deep belllik bai
i rememb that i had heard thi bai when we sat in the boat upon the
river and saw that poor nobl done to death for the crime of love the
khania as the hunt pass us then i observ that it burst from
the throat of the lead hound a huge brute red in colour with
a coalblack ear fang that gleam like ivori and a mouth which
resembl a hot oven i even knew the name of the beast for afterward
the khan whose peculiar joi it wa had point it out to me he call
it master becaus no dog in the pack dare fight it and told me that
it could kill an arm man alon
now as it bai warn us master wa not half a mile awai
the come of the moonlight enabl us to gallop faster especi as
here the ground wa smooth be cover with a short dry turf and
for the next two hour we gain upon the pack ye it wa onli two
hour or perhap less but it seem a score of centuri the slope
of the peak were now not more than ten mile ahead but our hors were
give out at last thei had born us nobli poor beast though we were
no light weight yet their strength had it limit the sweat ran from
them their side pant like bellow thei breath in gasp thei
stumbl and would scarc answer to the flog of our spearshaft
their gallop sank to a jolt canter and i thought that soon thei must
come to a dead stop
we cross the brow of a gentl rise from which the ground that wa
sprinkl with bush and rock slope downward to where some mile
below us the river ran bound the enorm flank of the mountain
when we had travel a littl wai down thi slope we were oblig to
turn in order to pass between two heap of rock which brought us side
on to it brow and there cross it not more than three hundr yard
awai we saw the pack there were fewer of them now doubtless mani
had fallen out of the hunt but mani still remain moreov not far
behind them rode the khan though hi second mount wa gone or more
probabl he wa ride it have gallop the first to a standstil
our poor hors saw them also and the sight lent them wing for all
the while thei knew that thei were run for their live thi we
could tell from the wai thei quiver whenev the bai came near
to them not as hors trembl with the pleasur excit of the
hunt but in an extrem of terror as i have often seen them do when
a prowl tiger roar close to their camp on thei went as though thei
were fresh from the stabl nor did thei fail again until anoth four
mile or so were cover and the river wa but a littl wai ahead for
we could hear the rush of it water
then slowli but sure the pack overtook us we pass a clump of bush
but when we had gone a coupl of hundr yard or so across the open
plain beyond feel that the hors were utterli spent i shout
to leorid round back to the bush and hide there so we did and
scarc had we reach it and dismount when the hound came past
ye thei went within fifti yard of us lollop along upon our spoor
and run all but mute for now thei were too weari to wast their
breath in vain run for it i said to leo as soon as thei had gone by
for thei will be back on the scent present and we set off to the
right across the line that the hound had taken so as not to cut our
own spoor
about a hundr yard awai wa a rock which fortun we were abl to
reach befor the pack swung round upon the hors track and therefor
thei did not view us here we stai until follow the loop thei came
to the patch of bush and pass behind it then we ran forward again as
far as we could go glanc backward as we went i saw our two poor
founder beast plung awai across the plain happili almost in the
same line along which we had ridden from the rise thei were utterli
done but freed from our weight and urg on by fear could still
gallop and keep ahead of the dog though we knew that thi would not
be for veri long i saw also that the khan guess what we had done
in our despair wa try to call hi hound off the hors but as
yet without avail for thei would not leav the quarri which thei had
view
all thi came to my sight in a flash but i rememb the pictur well
the mighti snowclad peak surmount by it column of glow smoke and
cast it shadow for mile upon mile across the desert flat the plain
with it isol rock and grei bush the doom hors struggl
across it with convuls bound the trail line of great dog that
lope after them and amongst these look small and lone in that
vast place the figur of the khan and hi hors of which the black
hide wa befleck with foam then abov the blue and tender sky
where the round moon shone so clearli that in her quiet level light no
detail even the smallest could escap the ey
now youth and even middl ag were far behind me and although a veri
strong man for my year i could not run as i us to do also i wa
most weari and my limb were stiff and chafe with long ride so
i made but slow progress and to worsen matter i struck my left foot
against a stone and hurt it much i implor leo to go on and leav me
for we thought that if we could onc reach the river our scent would be
lost in the water at ani rate that it would give us a chanc of life
just then too i heard the bell bai of the hound master and wait
for the next ye it wa nearer to us the khan had made a cast and
found our line present we must face the end
go go i said i can keep them back for a few minut and you mai
escap it is your quest not mine ayesha await you not me and i am
weari of life i wish to die and have done with it
thu i gasp not all at onc but in broken word as i hobbl along
cling to leo arm but he onli answer in a low voiceb quiet
or thei will hear you and on he went drag me with him
we were quit near the water now for we could see it gleam below us
and oh how i long for on deep drink i rememb that thi wa the
uppermost desir in my mind to drink and drink but the hound were
nearer still to us so near that we could hear the patter of their
feet on the dry ground mingl with the thud of the hoof of the khan
gallop hors we had reach some rock upon a littl rise just
where the bank began when leo said suddenlyno us we cant make it
stop and let see the thing through
so we wheel round rest our back against the rock there about a
hundr yard off were the deathhound but heaven be prais onli
three of them the rest had follow the fly hors and doubtless
when thei caught them at last which mai have been far distant had
stop to gorg themselv upon them so thei were out of the fight
onli three and the khan a wild figur who gallop with them but
those three the black and red brute master and two other almost as
fierc and big
it might be wors said leo if you will try to tackl the dog ill
do my best with the khan and stoop down he rub hi palm in the
grit for thei were wet as water an exampl which i follow then we
grip the spear in our right hand and the knive in our left and
wait
the dog had seen us now and came on growl and bai fearfulli
with a rush thei came and i am not asham to own that i felt terribl
afraid for the brute seem the size of lion and more fierc on
it wa the smallest of them outstrip the other and leap up the
littl rise sprang straight at my throat
why or how i do not know but on the impuls of the moment i too sprang
to meet it so that it whole weight came upon the point of my spear
which wa back by my weight the spear enter between it foreleg
and such wa the shock that i wa knock backward but when i regain
my feet i saw the dog roll on the ground befor me and gnash at
the spear shaft which had been twist from my hand
the other two had jump at leo but fail to get hold though on of
them tore awai a larg fragment from hi tunic foolishli enough he
hurl hi spear at it but miss for the steel pass just under it
belli and buri itself deep in the ground the pair of them did not
come on again at onc perhap the sight of their dy companion made
them paus at ani rate thei stood at a littl distanc snarl
where as our spear were gone thei were safe from us
now the khan had ridden up and sat upon hi hors glower at us and
hi face wa like the face of a devil i had hope that he might fear to
attack but the moment i saw hi ey i knew that thi would not be he
wa quit mad with hate jealousi and the longdrawn excit of the
hunt and had come to kill or be kill slide from the saddl he
drew hi short swordfor either he had lost hi spear or had brought
noneand made a hiss nois to the two dog point at me with the
sword i saw them spring and i saw him rush at leo and after that who
can tell exactli what happen
my knife went home to the hilt in the bodi of on dogand it came to
the ground and lai therefor it hindquart were paralys howl
snarl and bite at me but the other the fiend call master got
me by the right arm beneath the elbow and i felt my bone crack in it
mighti jaw and the agoni of it or so i suppos caus me to drop the
knife so that i wa weaponless the brute drag me from the rock and
began to shake and worri me although i kick it in the stomach with
all my strength i fell to my knee and as it chanc my left hand
came upon a stone of about the size of a larg orang which i grip
i gain my feet again and pound at it skull with the stone but
still it did not leav go and thi wa well for me for it next hold
would have been on my throat
we twist and tumbl to and fro man and dog togeth at on turn
i thought that i saw leo and the khan roll over and over each other
upon the ground at anoth that he the khan wa sit against a
stone look at me and it came into my mind that he must have kill
leo and wa watch while the dog worri me to death
then just as thing began to grow black someth sprang forward and i
saw the huge hound lift from the earth it jaw open my arm came
free and fell against my side ye the brute wa whirl round in
the air leo held it by it hind leg and with all hi great strength
whirl it round and round
thud
he had dash it head against the rock and it fell and lai still a
huddl heap of black and red oddli enough i did not faint i suppos
that the pain and the shock to my nerv kept me awak for i heard
leo sai in a matteroffact voic between hi gasp for breathwel
that over and i think that i have fulfil the shaman propheci
let look and make sure
then he led me with him to on of the rock and there rest supin
against it sat the khan still live but unabl to move hand or foot
the mad had quit left hi face and he look at us with melancholi
ey like the ey of a sick child
you ar brave men he said slowli strong also to have kill those
hound and broken my back so it ha come about as wa foretold by the
old rat after all i should have hunt aten not you though now she
live to aveng me for her own sake not mine yellowbeard she hunt
you too and with deadlier hound than these those of her thwart
passion forgiv me and fly to the mountain yellowbeard whither i go
befor you for there on dwell who is stronger than aten
then hi jaw drop and he wa dead
chapter xii
the messeng
he is gone i pant and the world hasnt lost much
well it didnt give him much did it poor devil so dont let
speak ill of him answer leo who had thrown himself exhaust to the
ground perhap he wa all right befor thei made him mad at ani rate
he had pluck for i dont want to tackl such anoth
how did you manag it i ask
dodg in beneath hi sword close with him threw him and smash
him up over that lump of stone sheer strength that all a cruel
busi but it wa hi life or mine and there you ar it lucki i
finish it in time to help you befor that ovenmouth brute tore your
throat out did you ever see such a dog it look as larg as a young
donkei ar you much hurt horac
oh my forearm is chew to a pulp but noth els i think let us
get down to the water if i cant drink soon i shall faint also the
rest of the pack is somewher about fifti or more of them
i dont think thei will troubl us thei have got the hors poor
beast wait a minut and i will come
then he rose found the khan sword a beauti and ancient weapon
and with a singl cut of it keen edg kill the second dog that i
had wound which wa still yowl and snarl at us after thi he
collect the two spear and my knife sai that thei might be us
and without troubl caught the khan hors which stood with hang
head close by so tire that even thi desper fight had not
frighten it awai
now he said up you go old fellow you ar not fit to walk ani
farther and with hi help i climb into the saddl
then slip the rein over hi arm he led the hors which walk
stiffli on to the river that ran within a quarter of a mile of
us though to me tortur as i wa by pain and half deliri with
exhaust the journei seem long enough
still we came there somehow and forget my wound i tumbl from
the hors threw myself flat and drank and drank more i think
than ever i did befor not in all my life have i tast anyth so
delici as wa that long draught of water when i had satisfi my
thirst i dip my head and made shift to jerk my wound arm into it
for it cool seem to still the pain present leo rose the water
run from hi face and beard and saidwhat shall we do now the
river seem to be wide over a hundr yard and it is low but there
mai be deep water in the middl shall we try to cross in which case we
might drown or stop where we ar till daylight and take our chanc of
the deathhound
i cant go anoth foot i murmur faintli much less try to ford an
unknown river
now about thirti yard from the shore wa an island cover with reed
and grass
perhap we could reach that he said come get on to my back and we
will try
i obei with difficulti and we set out he feel hi wai with the
handl of the spear the water prove to be quit shallow inde it
never came much abov hi knee so that we reach the island without
troubl here leo laid me down on the soft rush and return to the
mainland brought over the black hors and the remain weapon and
have unsaddl the beast kneehalt and turn it loos whereon
it immedi lai down for it wa too spent to feed
then he set to work to doctor my wound well it prove for me that the
sleev of my garment wa so thick for even through it the flesh of my
forearm wa torn to ribbon moreov a bone seem to be broken leo
collect a doubl hand of some soft wet moss and have wash the
arm wrap it round with a handkerchief over which he laid the moss
then with a second handkerchief and some strip of linen torn from our
undergar he fasten a coupl of split reed to serv as rough
splint to the wound limb while he wa do thi i suppos that i
slept or swoon at ani rate i rememb no more
sometim dure that night leo had a strang dream of which he told me
the next morn i suppos that it must have been a dream as certainli
i saw or wa awar of noth well he dreamedi us hi own word as
nearli as possiblethat again he heard those accurs deathhound in
full cry nearer and nearer thei came follow our spoor to the edg
of the riveral the pack that had run down the hors at the water
brink thei halt and were mute then suddenli a puff of wind brought
the scent of us upon the island to on of them which lift up it head
and utter a singl bai the rest cluster about it and all at onc
thei made a dash at the water
leo could see and hear everyth he felt that after all our doom wa
now at hand and yet held in the grip of nightmar if nightmar it
were he wa quit unabl to stir or even to cry out to wake and warn
me
now follow the marvel of thi vision give tongu as thei came half
swim and half plung the hound drew near to the island where we
slept then suddenli leo saw that we were no longer alon in front of
us on the brink of the water stood the figur of a woman clad in some
dark garment he could not describ her face or appear for her back
wa toward him
all he knew wa that she stood there like a guard hold some object
in her rais hand and that suddenli the advanc hound caught sight
of her in an instant it wa as though thei were paralys by fearfor
their bai turn to fear howl on or two of those that were
nearest to the island seem to lose their foot and be swept awai by
the stream the rest struggl back to the bank and fled wildli like
whip cur
then the dark command figur which in hi dream leo took to be the
guardian spirit of the mountain vanish that it left no footprint
behind it i can vouch for in the morn we look to see
when awaken by the sharp pang in my arm i open my ey again the
dawn wa break a thin mist hung over the river and the island and
through it i could see leo sleep heavili at my side and the shape of
the black hors which had risen and wa graze close at hand i lai
still for a while rememb all that we had undergon and wonder
that i should live to wake till present abov the murmur of the
water i heard a sound which terrifi me the sound of voic i sat up
and peer through the reed and there upon the bank look enorm
in the mist i saw two figur mount upon hors those of a woman and
a man
thei were point to the ground as though thei examin spoor in the
sand i heard the man sai someth about the dog not dare to enter
the territori of the mountain a remark which came back to my mind again
after leo had told me hi dream then i rememb how we were place
wake i whisper to leo wake we ar pursu
he sprang to hi feet rub hi ey and snatch at a spear now
those upon the bank saw him and a sweet voic spoke through the mist
sayinglai down that weapon my guest for we ar not come to harm
you
it wa the voic of the khania aten and the man with her wa the old
shaman simbri
what shall we do now horac ask leo with someth like a groan
for in the whole world there were no two peopl whom he less wish to
see
noth i answer it is for them to plai
come to us call the khania across the water i swear that we mean
no harm ar we not alon
i do not know answer leo but it seem unlik where we ar we
stop until we ar readi to march again
aten spoke to simbri what she said we could not hear for she
whisper but she appear to be argu with him and persuad him to
some cours of which he strongli disapprov then suddenli both of
them put their hors at the water and rode to us through the shallow
reach the island thei dismount and we stood stare at each
other the old man seem veri weari in bodi and oppress in mind but
the khania wa strong and beauti as ever nor had passion and fatigu
left ani trace upon her inscrut face it wa she who broke the
silenc sayingy have ridden fast and far sinc last we met my
guest and left an evil token to mark the path you took yonder among

come horac said leo and he move toward the hors
men broke in the old shaman would you rush upon your doom listen
i have visit yonder haunt place for it wa i who accord to
custom brought thither the bodi of the khan aten father for burial
and i warn you to set no foot within it templ
which your mistress said that we should never reach i comment but
leo onli answeredw thank you for your warn and ad horac
watch them while i saddl the hors lest thei do us a mischief
so i took the spear in my uninjur hand and stood readi but thei made
no attempt to hurt us onli fell back a littl and began to talk in
hurri whisper it wa evid to me that thei were much perturb
in a few minut the hors wa saddl and leo assist me to mount it
then he saidw go to accomplish our fate whatev it mai be but
befor we part khania i thank you for the kind you have shown us

must and as the shaman here ha alwai known i must ye i will match
my strength and magic against her as it is decre that i shall do to
the victor be that crown for which we have war for ag
then suddenli aten sprang to her saddl and turn her hors head
rode it back through the water to the shore follow by old simbri who
lift up hi crook hand as though in woe and fear mutter as he
wentyou have enter the forbidden river and now aten the dai of
decis is upon us allupon us and herthat predestin dai of ruin
and of war
what do thei mean ask leo of me
i dont know i answer but i have no doubt we shall find out soon
enough and that it will be someth unpleas now for thi river
befor we had struggl through it i thought more than onc that the dai
of drown wa upon us also for in place there were deep rapid which
nearli swept us awai but leo who wade lead the khan hors by
the bridl felt hi path and support himself with the spear shaft so
that in the end we reach the other bank safe
beyond it lai a breadth of marshi land that doubtless were overflow
when the torrent wa in flood through these we push our wai as fast
as we could for we fear lest the khania had gone to fetch her escort
which we thought she might have left behind the rise and would return
with it present to hunt us down at that time we did not know what
we learn afterward that with it border river the soil of the
mountain wa absolut sacr and in practic inviol true it
had been invad by the peopl of kaloon in sever war but on each
occas their armi wa destroi or met with terribl disast littl
wonder then thei had come to believ that the hous of fire wa under
the protect of some unconquer spirit
leav the marsh we reach a bare rise plain which led to the
first slope of the mountain three or four mile awai here we expect
everi moment to be attack by the savag of whom we had heard so much
but no live creatur did we see the place wa a desert streak with
vein of rock that onc had been molten lava i do not rememb much
els about it inde the pain in my arm wa so sharp that i had no
ey for physic featur at length the rise end in a bare broad
donga quit destitut of veget of which the bottom wa buri in
lava and a debri of rock wash down by the rain or melt snow from
slope abov thi donga wa border on the farther side by a cliff
perhap fifti feet in height in which we could see no open
still we descend the place that wa dark and rug pervad
moreov by an extraordinari gloom and as we went perceiv that it
lava floor wa sprinkl over with a multitud of white object soon we
came to the first of these and found that it wa the skeleton of a
human be here wa a verit vallei of dead bone thousand upon
thousand of them a gigant graveyard it seem as though some great
armi had perish here
inde we found afterward that thi wa the case for on on of those
occas in the far past when the peopl of kaloon had attack the
mountain tribe thei were trap and slaughter in thi gulli
leav their bone as a warn and a token among these sad skeleton
we wander disconsol seek a path up the oppos cliff and
find none until at length we came to a halt not know which wai
to turn then it wa that we met with our first strang experi on
the mountain
the gulf and it moulder relic depress us so that for awhil
we were silent and to tell the truth somewhat afraid ye even
the hors seem afraid for it snort a littl hung it head and
shiver close by us lai a pile of bone the remain evid of a
number of wretch creatur that dead or live had been hurl down
from the cliff abov and on the top of the pile wa a littl huddl
heap which we took for more bone
unless we can find a wai out of thi accurs charnelhous befor
long i think that we shall add to it compani i said stare round
me
as the word left my lip it seem to me that from the corner of my ey
i saw the heap on the top of the bone stir i look round ye it
wa stir it rose it stood up a human figur appar that of
a womanbut of thi i could not be surewrap from head to foot in
white and wear a hang veil over it face or rather a mask with
cut eyehol it advanc toward us while we stare at it till the
hors catch sight of the thing shi violent and nearli threw me
when at a distanc of about ten pace it paus and beckon with it
hand that wa also swath in white like the arm of a mummi
what the devil ar you shout leo and hi voic echo drearili
among those nake rock but the creatur did not answer it onli
continu to beckon
leo walk up to it to assur himself that we were not the victim of
some hallucin as he came it glide back to it heap of bone and
stood there like a ghost of on dead arisen from amidst these grin
evid of death or rather a swath corps for that is what it
resembl leo follow with the intent of touch it to assur
himself of it realiti whereon it lift it whitewrap arm and
struck him lightli on the breast then as he recoil it point with
it hand first upward as though to the peak or the sky and next at
the wall of rock which face us
he return to me sai what shall we do
follow i suppos it mai be a messeng from abov and i nod
toward the mountain crest
from below more like leo mutter for i dont like the look of
thi guid
still he motion with hi hand to the creatur to proce appar
it understood for it turn to the left and began to pick it wai
amongst the stone and skeleton swiftli and without nois we follow
for sever hundr yard till it reach a shallow cleft in the rock
thi cleft we had seen alreadi but as it appear to end at a depth of
about thirti feet we pass on the figur enter here and vanish
it must be a shadow said leo doubtfulli
nonsens i answer shadow dont strike on go on
so he led the hors up the cleft to find that at the end it turn
sharpli to the right and that the form wa stand there await us
forward it went again and we after it down a littl gorg that grew ever
gloomier till it termin in what might have been a cave or a galleri
cut in the rock
here our guid came back to us appar with the intent of take
the hors by the bridl but at thi nearer sight of it the brute
snort and rear up so that it almost fell backward upon me as
it found it feet again the figur struck it on the head in the same
passionless inhuman wai that it had struck leo whereon the hors
trembl and burst into a sweat as though with fear make no further
attempt to escap or to disobei then it took on side of the bridl
in it swath hand and leo cling to the other we plung into the
tunnel
our posit wa not pleasant for we knew not whither we were be led
by thi horribl conductor and suspect that it might be to meet our
death in the dark moreov i guess that the path wa narrow and
border by some gulf for as we went i heard stone fall appar to
a consider depth while the poor hors lift it feet gingerli and
snort in abject fear at length we saw daylight and never wa i more
glad of it advent although it show us that there wa a gulf on our
right and that the path we travel could not measur more than ten
feet in width
now we were out of the tunnel that evid had save us a wide
detour and stand for the first time upon the actual slope of the
mountain which stretch upward for a great number of mile till it
reach the snowlin abov here also we saw evid of human life
for the ground wa cultiv in patch and herd of mountain sheep and
cattl were visibl in the distanc
present we enter a gulli follow a rough path that led along the
edg of a rage torrent it wa a desol place half a mile wide
or more have hundr of fantast lava boulder strewn about it
slope befor we had gone a mile i heard a shrill whistl and suddenli
from behind these boulder sprang a number of men quit fifti of them
all we could note at the time wa that thei were brawni savagelook
fellow for the most part red hair and beard although their
complexion were rather dark who wore cloak of white goat skin and
carri spear and shield i should imagin that thei were not unlik
the ancient pict and scot as thei appear to the invad roman at
us thei came utter their shrill whistl cri evid with the
intent of spear us on the spot
now for it said leo draw hi sword for escap wa imposs
thei were all round us goodby horac
goodby i answer rather faintli understand what the khania and
the old shaman had meant when thei said that we should be kill befor
we ascend the first slope of the mountain
meanwhil our ghastlylook guid had slip behind a great boulder
and even then it occur to me that her part in the tragedi be
plai she if it were a woman at all wa withdraw herself while
we met our miser fate but here i did her injustic for she had i
suppos come to save us from thi veri fate which without her presenc
we must most certainli have suffer when the savag were within a few
yard suddenli she appear on the top of the boulder look like a
second witch of endor and stretch out her arm not a word did she
speak onli stretch out her drape arm but the effect wa remark
and instantan
at the sight of her down on to their face went those wild men everi
on of them as though a lightn stroke had in an instant swept them
out of exist then she let her arm fall and beckon whereon a
great fellow who i suppos wa the leader of the band rose and crept
toward her with bow head submiss as a beaten dog to him she
made sign point to us point to the faroff peak cross and
uncross her whitewrap arm but so far as i could hear speak
no word it wa evid that the chief understood her howev for
he said someth in a guttur languag then he utter hi shrill
whistl whereon the band rose and depart thenc at full speed
thi wai and the other so that in anoth minut thei had vanish as
quickli as thei came
now our guid motion to us to proce and led the wai upward as
calmli as though noth had happen
for over two hour we went on thu till our path brought us from the
ravin on to a grassi decliv across which it wound it wai here to
our astonish we found a fire burn and hang abov the fire
an earthenwar pot which wa on the boil although we could see no man
tend it the figur signal to me to dismount point to the pot
in token that we were to eat the food which doubtless she had order
the wild men to prepar for us and veri glad wa i to obei her
provis had been made for the hors also for near the fire lai a
great bundl of green forag
while leo offsaddl the beast and spread the provend for it take
with me a spare earthen vessel that lai readi i went to the edg of the
torrent to drink and steep my wound arm in it icecold stream thi
reliev it greatli though by now i wa sure from variou symptom
that the brute master fang had fortun onli broken or injur the
small bone a discoveri for which i wa thank enough have finish
attend to it as well as i wa abl i fill the jar with water
on my wai back a thought struck me and go to where our mysteri
guid stood still as lot wife after she had been turn into a pillar
of salt i offer it to her hope that she would unveil her face and
drink then for the first time she show some sign of be human
or so i thought for it seem to me that she bow ever so littl
in acknowledg of the courtesi if soand i mai have been
mistakenthi wa all for the next instant she turn her back on me
to show that it wa declin so she would not or for aught i
knew could not drink neither would she eat for when leo tri her
afterward with food she refus it in like fashion
meanwhil he had taken the pot off the fire and as soon as it content
grew cool enough we fell on them eagerli for we were starv after
we had eaten and drunk leo redress my arm as best he could and we
rest awhil inde i think that be veri tire we began to doze
for i wa awaken by a shadow fall on us and look up to see our
corpselik guid stand close by and point first to the sun then
at the hors as though to show us that we had far to travel so we
saddl up and went on again somewhat refresh for at least we were no
longer raven
all the rest of that dai we journei on up the grassi slope see no
man although occasion we heard the wild whistl which told us that
we were be watch by the mountain savag by sundown the charact
of the countri had chang for the grass wa replac with rock
amongst which grew stunt fir we had left the lower slope and were
begin to climb the mountain itself
the sun sank and we went on through the twilight the twilight di
and we went on through the dark our path lit onli by the star and the
faint radianc of the glow pillar of smoke abov the peak which
wa reflect on to us from the mighti mantl of it snow forward we
toil whilst a few pace ahead of us walk our unweari guid if
she had seem weird and inhuman befor now she appear a veri ghost
as clad in her graveyard white upon which the faint light shimmer
never speak never look back she glide on noiselessli between
the black rock and the twist darkgreen fir and junip
soon we lost all count of the road we turn thi wai and turn that
wai we pass an open patch and through the shadow of a grove till at
length as the moon rose we enter a ravin and follow a path
that ran down it came to a place which is best describ as a larg
amphitheatr cut by the hand of natur out of the rock of the mountain
evid it wa chosen as a place of defenc for it entranc wa
narrow and tortuou built up at the end also so that onli on person
could pass it gatewai at a time within an open space and at it
farther side stood low stone hous built against the rock in front
of these hous the moonlight shine full upon them were gather
sever hundr men and women arrang in a semicircl and in altern
compani who appear to be engag in the celebr of some rite
it wa wild enough in front of them and in the exact centr of the
semicircl stood a gigant redbeard man who wa nake except
for a skin girdl about hi loin he wa swing himself backward
and forward hi hand rest upon hi hip and as he swung shout
someth like ho haha ho when he bent toward the audienc it
bent toward him and everi time he straighten himself it echo hi
final shout of ho in a volum of sound that made the precipic
ring nor wa thi all for perch upon hi hairi head with arch
back and wave tail stood a great white cat
anyth stranger and inde more fantast than the gener effect of
thi scene lit by the bright moonlight and set in that wild arena it
wa never my lot to wit the redhair halfnak men and women
the gigant priest the mystic white cat that grip hi
scalp with it claw wave it tail and seem to take a part in the
perform the unholi chant and it vollei choru all help to
make it extraordinarili impress thi struck us the more perhap
becaus at the time we could not in the least guess it signific
though we imagin that it must be preliminari to some sacrific or
offer it wa like the fragment of a nightmar preserv by the
awaken sens in all it mad meaningless realiti
now round the open space where these savag were celebr their
worship or whatev it might be ran a rough stone wall about six feet
in height in which wall wa a gatewai toward thi we advanc quit
unseen for upon our side of the wall grew mani stunt pine through
these pine our guid led us till in the thickest of them some
few yard from the open gatewai and a littl to the right of it she
motion to us to stop
then she went to a low place in the wall and stood there as though she
were consid the scene beyond it seem to us inde that she
saw what she had not expect and wa therebi perplex or anger
present she appear to make up her mind for again she motion to
us to remain where we were enjoin silenc upon us by place her
swath hand upon the mask that hid her face next moment she wa gone
how she went or whither i cannot sai all we knew wa that she wa no
longer there
what shall we do now whisper leo to me
stai where we ar till she come back again or someth happen i
answer
so there be noth els to be done we stai hope that the
hors would not betrai us by neigh or that we might not be otherwis
discov sinc we were certain that if so we should be in danger of
death veri soon howev we forgot the anxieti of our own posit
in the studi of the wild scene befor us which now began to develop a
fear interest
it would seem that what ha been describ wa but preliminari to the
drama itself and that thi drama wa the trial of certain peopl for
their live thi we could guess for after awhil the incant
ceas and the crowd in front of the big man with the cat upon hi head
open out while behind him a column of smoke rose into the air as
though light had been set to some sunk furnac
into the space that had thu been clear were now led seven person
whose hand were ti behind them thei were of both sex and includ
an old man and a woman with a tall and handsom figur who appear
to be quit young scarc more than a girl inde these seven were
rang in a line where thei stood clearli in great fear for the old
man fell upon hi knee and on of the women began to sob thu thei
were left awhil perhap to allow the fire behind them to burn up
which it soon did with great fierc throw a vivid light upon
everi detail of the spectacl
now all wa readi and a man brought a wooden trai to the redbeard
priest who wa seat on a stool the white cat upon hi knee whither
we had seen it leap from hi head a littl while befor he took the
trai by it handl and at a word from him the cat jump on to it and
sat there then amidst the most intens silenc he rose and utter some
prayer appar to the cat which sat face him thi done he turn
the trai round so that the creatur back wa now toward him and
advanc to the line of prison began to walk up and down in front
of them which he did sever time at each turn draw a littl
nearer
hold out the trai he present it at the face of the prison on the
left whereon the cat rose arch it back and began to lift it paw
up and down present he move to the next prison and held it befor
him awhil and so on till he came to the fifth that young woman of
whom i have spoken now the cat grew veri angri for in the deathlik
still we could hear it spit and growl at length it seem
to lift it paw and strike the girl upon the face whereon she scream
aloud a terribl scream then all the audienc broke out into a shout
a singl word which we understood for we had heard on veri like it
us by the peopl of the plain it wa witch witch witch
execution who were wait for the victim to be chosen in thi ordeal
by cat rush forward and seiz the girl began to drag her toward
the fire the prison who wa stand by her and whom we rightli
guess to be her husband tri to protect her but hi arm be
bound poor fellow he could do noth on of the execution knock
him down with a stick for a moment hi wife escap and threw herself
upon him but the brute lift her up again hale her toward the
fire whilst all the audienc shout wildli
i cant stand thi said leo it murdercoldblood murder and
he drew hi sword
best leav the beast alon i answer doubtfulli though my own
blood wa boil in my vein
whether he heard or not i do not know for the next thing i saw wa leo
rush through the gate wave the khan sword and shout at the
top of hi voic then i struck my heel into the rib of the hors and
follow after him in ten second we were among them as we came the
savag fell back thi wai and that stare at us amaz for at first
i think thei took us for apparit thu leo on foot and i gallop
after him we came to the place
the execution and their victim were near the fire nowa veri great
fire of resin pine log built in a pit that measur about eight feet
across close to it sat the priest upon hi stool watch the scene
with a cruel smile and reward the cat with littl gobbet of raw
meat that he took from a leathern pouch at hi side occup in
which he wa so deepli engag that he never saw us until we were right
on to him
shout leav her alon you blackguard leo rush at the
execution and with a singl blow of hi sword sever the arm of on
of them who grip the woman by the nape of the neck
with a yell of pain and rage the man sprang back and stood wave the
stump toward the peopl and stare at it wildli in the confus that
follow i saw the victim slip from the hand of her astonish wouldb
murder and run into the dark where she vanish also i saw
the witchdoctor spring up still hold the trai on which the cat wa
sit and heard him begin to shout a perfect torrent of furiou abus
at leo who in repli wave hi sword and curs him roundli in english
and mani other languag
then of a sudden the cat upon the trai infuri i suppos by the
nois and the interrupt of it meal sprang straight at leo face
he appear to catch it in midair with hi left hand and with all hi
strength dash it to the ground where it lai writh and screech
then as though by an afterthought he stoop pick the devilish
creatur up again and hurl it into the heart of the fire for he wa
mad with rage and knew not what he did
at the sight of that aw sacrilegefor such it wa to them who
worship thi beasta gasp of horror rose from the spectat
follow by a howl of execr then like a wave of the sea thei
rush at us i saw leo cut on man down and next instant i wa off the
hors and be drag toward the furnac at the edg of it i met leo
in like plight but fight furious for hi strength wa great and
thei were half afraid of him
why couldnt you leav the cat alon i shout at him in idiot
remonstr for my brain had gone and all i knew wa that we were
about to be thrown into the fieri pit alreadi i wa over it i felt
the flame sing my hair and saw it red cavern await me when of a
sudden the brutal hand that held me were unloos and i fell backward
to the ground where i lai stare upward
thi wa what i saw stand in front of the fire her drape form
quiver as though with rage wa our ghostlylook guid who
point with her hand at the gigant redhead witchdoctor but she
wa no longer alon for with her were a score or more of men clad in
white robe and arm with sword blackei asceticlook men with
cleanshav head and face for their scalp shone in the firelight
at the sight of them terror had seiz that multitud which mad as
goad bull but a few second befor now fled in everi direct like
sheep frighten by a wolf the leader of the whiterob priest a man
with a gentl face which when at rest wa cloth in a perpetu smile
wa address the medicineman and i understood someth of hi talk
dog he said in effect speak in a smooth measur voic that yet
wa terribl accurs dog beastworshipp what were you about to do
to the guest of the mighti mother of the mountain is it for thi that
you and your idolatri have been spare so long answer if you have
anyth to sai answer quickli for your time is short
with a groan of fear the great fellow flung himself upon hi knee not
to the headpriest who question him but befor the quiver shape of
our guid and to her put up halfarticul prayer for merci
ceas said the highpriest she is the minist who judg and the
sword that strike i am the ear and the voic speak and tell
mewer you about to cast those men whom you were command to receiv
hospit into yonder fire becaus thei save the victim of your
devilri and kill the imp you cherish nai i saw it all know that
it wa but a trap set to catch you who have been allow to live too
long
but still the wretch writh befor the drape form and howl for
merci
messeng said the highpriest with thee the power goe declar
thy decre
then our guid lift her hand slowli and point to the fire at onc
the man turn ghastli white groan and fell back as i think quit
dead slain by hi own terror
now mani of the peopl had fled but some remain and to these
the priest call in cold tone bid them approach thei obei
creep toward him

of you who dare to think evil in hi heart or to do it with hi hand
such is the just decre of the hesea spoken by her from her throne
amidst the fire of the mountain

a build that stood about fifti yard awai against the rock wall of
the amphitheatr
it would seem that it wa a guesthous or at least had been made readi
to serv that purpos as in it lamp were lit and a fire burn for
here the air wa cold the hous wa divid into two room the second
of them a sleep place to which he led us through the first

to see for it told me that the veri natur of my hurt had been divin
but i ask no more question i wa too weari moreov i knew that it

which he mix some spirit and examin it with the skill of a train
doctor

delic touch that it scarc pain me sai that by the morrow
the swell would have gone down and he would set the bone thi inde

after it wa done he help me to wash and to cloth myself in the clean
garment and put a sling about my neck to serv as a rest for my arm
meanwhil leo had also dress himself so that we left the chamber
togeth veri differ men to the foul bloodstain wander who had
enter there in the outer room we found food prepar for us of which
we at with a thank heart and without speak then blind with
weari we return to the other chamber and have remov our
outer garment flung ourselv upon the bed and were soon plung in
sleep
at some time in the night i awok suddenli at what hour i do not know
as certain peopl wake i among them when their room is enter even
without the slightest nois befor i open my ey i felt that some
on wa with us in the place nor wa i mistaken a littl lamp still
burn in the chamber a mere wick float in oil and by it light
i saw a dim ghostlik form stand near the door inde i thought
almost that it wa a ghost till present i rememb and knew it for
our corpselik guid who appear to be look intent at the bed on
which leo lai or so i thought for the head wa bent in that direct
at first she wa quit still then she moan aloud a low and terribl
moan which seem to well from the veri heart
so the thing wa not dumb as i had believ evid it could suffer
and express it suffer in a human fashion look it wa wring it
pad hand as in an excess of woe now it would seem that leo began to
feel it influenc also for he stir and spoke in hi sleep so low
at first that i could onli distinguish the tongu he us which wa
arab present i caught a few word
ayesha he said ayesha
the figur glide toward him and stop he sat up in the bed still
fast asleep for hi ey were shut he stretch out hi arm as
though seek on whom he would embrac and spoke again in a low and
passion voiceayesha through life and death i have sought thee
long come to me my goddess my desir
the figur glide yet nearer and i could see that it wa trembl and
now it arm were extend also
at the bedsid she halt and leo laid himself down again now the
cover had fallen back expos hi breast where lai the leather
satchel he alwai wore that which contain the lock of ayesha hair
he wa fast asleep and the figur seem to fix it ey upon thi
satchel present it did more for with surpris deft those
whitewrap finger open it clasp ye and drew out the long
tress of shine hair long and earnestli she gaze at it then gentli
replac the relic close the satchel and for a littl while seem to
weep while she stood thu the dream leo onc more stretch out hi
arm and spoke sai in the same passionladen voicecom to me my
darl my beauti my beauti
at those word with a littl muffl scream like that of a scare
nightbird the figur turn and flit through the doorwai
when i wa quit certain that she had gone i gasp aloud
what might thi mean i wonder in a veri agoni of bewilder thi
could certainli be no dream it wa real for i wa wide awak inde
what did it all mean who wa the ghastli mummylik thing which had
guid us unharm through such terribl danger the messeng that all
men fear who could strike down a brawni savag with a motion of it
hand why did it creep into the place thu at dead of night like a
spirit revisit on belov why did it presenc caus me to awak
and leo to dream why did it draw out the tress inde how knew it
that thi tress wa hidden there and whyoh why at those tender and
passion word did it flit awai at last like some scare bat
the priest oro had call our guid minist and sword that is on
who carri out decre but what if thei were it own decre what if
thi thing should be she whom we sought ayesha herself why should i
trembl at the thought see that if so our quest wa end we had
achiev oh it must be becaus about thi be there wa someth
terribl someth unhuman and appal if ayesha live within
those mummycloth then it wa a differ ayesha whom we had known
and worship well could i rememb the whitedrap form of
shewhomustbeobei and how long befor she reveal her gloriou
face to us we guess the beauti and the majesti hidden beneath that
veil by which her radiant life and loveli incarn could not be
disguis
but what of thi creatur i would not pursu the thought i wa
mistaken doubtless she wa what the priest oro had saidsom
halfsupernatur be to whom certain power were given and
doubtless she had come to spy on us in our rest that she might make
report to the giver of those power
comfort myself thu i fell asleep again for fatigu overcam even
such doubt and fear in the morn when thei were natur less
vivid i made up my mind that for variou reason it would be wisest
to sai noth of what i had seen to leo nor inde did i do so until
some dai had gone by
when i awok the full light wa pour into the chamber and by it i
saw the priest oro stand at my bedsid i sat up and ask him what
time it wa to which he answer with a smile but in a low voic that
it lack but two hour of middai ad that he had come to set my
arm now i saw why he spoke low for leo wa still fast asleep
let him rest on he said as he undid the wrap on my arm for
he ha suffer much and he continu significantli mai still have
more to suffer
what do you mean friend oro i ask sharpli i thought you told us
that we were safe upon thi mountain
i told you friend and he look at me
holli is my name
friend holli that your bodi ar safe i said noth of all the
rest of you man is more than flesh and blood he is mind and spirit as
well and these can be injur also
who is there that would injur them i ask
friend he answer grave you and your companion have come to a
haunt land not as mere wander for then you would be dead er now
but of set purpos seek to lift the veil from mysteri which have
been hid for ag well your aim is known and it mai chanc that it
will be achiev but if thi veil is lift it mai chanc also that
you will find what shall send your soul shiver to despair and
mad sai ar you not afraid
somewhat i answer yet my fosterson and i have seen strang
thing and live we have seen the veri light of life roll by in
majesti we have been the guest of an immort and watch death seem
to conquer her and leav us untouch think you then that we will turn
coward now nai we march on to fulfil our destini
at these word oro show neither curios nor surpris it wa as
though i told him onli what he knew
good he repli smile and with a courteou bow of hi shaven
head within an hour you shall march onto fulfil your destini if
i have warn you forgiv me for i wa bidden so to do perhap to
try your mettl is it need that i should repeat thi warn to the
lord and again he look at me
leo vincei i said
leo vincei ye leo vincei he repeat as though the name were
familiar to him but had slip hi mind but you have not answer my
question is it need that i should repeat the warn
not in the least but you can do so if you wish when he awak
nai i think with you that it would be but wast of word
forforg the comparisonwhat the wolf daresand he look at
meth tiger doe not flee from and he nod toward leo there
see how much better ar the wound upon your arm which is no longer
swollen now i will bandag it and within some few week the bone will
be as sound again as it wa befor you met the khan rassen hunt in
the plain by the wai you will see him again soon and hi fair wife
with him
see him again do the dead then come to life upon thi mountain
nai but certain of them ar brought hither for burial it is the
privileg of the ruler of kaloon also i think that the khania ha
question to ask of it oracl
who is it oracl i ask with eager
the oracl he repli darkli is a voic it wa ever so wa it
not
ye i have heard that from aten but a voic impli a speaker is
thi speaker she whom you name mother
perhap friend holli
and is thi mother a spirit
it is a point that ha been much debat thei told you so in the
plain did thei not also the tribe think it on the mountain inde
the thing seem reason see that all of us who live ar flesh and
spirit but you will form your own judgment and then we can discuss the
matter there your arm is finish be care now not to strike it or
to fall and look your companion awak
someth over an hour later we start upon our upward journei i wa
again mount on the khan hors which have been groom and fed
wa somewhat rest while to leo a litter had been offer thi he
declin howev sai that he had now recov and would not be
carri like a woman so he walk by the side of my hors us hi
spear as a staff we pass the firepitnow full of dead white
ash among which were mix those of the witchfind and hi horribl
catpreced by our dumb guid at the sight of whom in her pale
wrap the peopl of the tribe who had return to their villag
prostrat themselv and so remain until she wa gone by
on of them howev rose again and break through our escort of
priest ran to leo knelt befor him and kiss hi hand it wa that
young woman whose life he had save a noblelook girl with mass
of red hair and by her wa her husband the mark of hi bond still
show on hi arm our guid seem to see thi incid though how
she did so i do not know at ani rate she turn and made some sign
which the priest interpret
call the woman to him he ask her sternli how she dare to touch
the person of thi stranger with her vile lip she answer that it wa
becaus her heart wa grate oro said that for thi reason she wa
forgiven moreov that in reward for what thei had suffer he wa
command to lift up her husband to be the ruler of that tribe dure
the pleasur of the mother he gave notic moreov that all should
obei the new chief in hi place accord to their custom and if he
did ani evil make report that he might suffer punish then wave
the pair asid without listen to their thank or the acclam of
the crowd he pass on
as we went down the ravin by which we had approach the villag on the
previou night a sound of chant struck our ear present the path
turn and we saw a solemn process advanc up that dismal sunless
gorg at the head of it rode none other than the beauti khania
follow by her greatuncl the old shaman and after these came a
compani of shaven priest in their white robe bear between them a
bier upon which it face uncov lai the bodi of the khan drape
in a black garment yet he look better thu than he had ever done for
now death had touch thi insan and dissolut man with someth of
the digniti which he lack in life
thu then we met at the sight of our guid white form the hors
which the khania rode rear up so violent that i thought it would
have thrown her but she master the anim with her whip and voic
and call outwho is thi drape hag of the mountain that stop the
path of the khania aten and her dead lord my guest i find you in ill
compani for it seem that you ar conduct by an evil spirit to meet
an evil fate that guid of your must sure be someth hate and
hideou for were she a wholesom woman she would not fear to show her
face
now the shaman pluck hi mistress by the sleev and the priest
oro bow to her prai her to be silent and ceas to speak such
illomen word into the air which might carri them she knew not
whither but some instinct hate seem to bubbl up in aten and
she would not be silent for she address our guid us the direct
thou a manner of speech that we found wa veri usual on the mountain
though rare upon the plain
let the air carri them whither it will she cri sorceress strip
off thy rag fit onli for a corps too vile to view show us what thou
art thou flit nightowl who thinkest to frighten me with that
liveri of death which onli serv to hide the death within
ceas i prai ladi ceas said oro stir for onc out of hi
imperturb calm she is the minist none other and with her goe
the power
then it goe not against aten khania of kaloon she answer or so
i think power forsooth let her show her power if she ha ani it is
not her own but that of the witch of the mountain who feign to be a
spirit and by her sorceri ha drawn awai my guestsand she point
to usthu bring my husband to hi death
niec be silent said the old shaman whose wrinkl face wa white
with terror whilst oro held up hi hand as though in supplic
to some unseen strength sayingo thou that hearest and seest be
merci i beseech thee and forgiv thi woman her mad lest the
blood of a guest should stain the hand of thy servant and the ancient
honour of our worship be brought low in the ey of men
thu he prai but although hi hand were uplift it seem to me
that hi ey were fix upon our guid as our were while he spoke
i saw her hand rais as she had rais it when she slew or rather
sentenc the witchdoctor then she seem to reflect and stai it in
mid air so that it point at the khania she did not move she made
no sound onli she point and the angri word di upon aten lip
the furi left her ey and the colour her face ye she grew white
and silent as the corps upon the bier behind her then cow by that
invis power she struck her hors so fierc that it bound by us
onward toward the villag at which the funer compani were to rest
awhil
as the shaman simbri follow the khania the priest oro caught hi
hors bridl and said to himmagician we have met befor for
instanc when your ladi father wa brought to hi funer warn her
then you that know someth of the truth and of her power to speak
more gentli of the ruler of thi land sai to her from me that had she
not been the ambassadress of death and therefor inviol sure
er now she would have share her husband bier farewel tomorrow we
will speak again and loos the shaman bridl oro pass on
soon we had left the melancholi process behind us and issu from
the gorg turn up the mountain slope toward the edg of the bright
snow that lai not far abov it wa as we came out of thi darksom
vallei where the overhang pine tree almost eclips the light that
suddenli we miss our guid
ha she gone back toto reason with the khania i ask of oro
nai he answer with a slight smile i think that she ha gone
forward to give warn that the hesea guest draw near
inde i answer stare hard at the bare slope of mountain
up which not a mous could have pass without be seen i
understandsh ha gone forward and the matter drop but what
i did not understand washow she had gone as the mountain wa
honeycomb with cave and galleri i suppos howev that she
enter on of them
all the rest of that dai we march upward gradual draw nearer to
the snowlin as we went gather what inform we could from the
priest oro thi wa the sum of itfrom the begin of the world
as he express it that is from thousand and thousand of year ago
thi mountain had been the home of a peculiar fireworship of which the
head heiroph wa a woman about twenti centuri befor howev the
invad gener name rassen had made himself khan of kaloon rassen
establish a new priestess on the mountain a worshipp of the
egyptian goddess he or isi thi priestess had introduc certain
modif in the ancient doctrin supersed the cult of fire
pure and simpl by a new faith which while hold to some of the old
ceremoni rever as it head the spirit of life or natur of whom
thei look upon their priestess as the earthli repres
of thi priestess oro would onli tell us that she wa ever present
although we gather that when on priestess di or wa taken to
the fire as he put it her child whether in fact or by adopt
succeed her and wa known by the same name those of he or the
hesea and mother we ask if we should see thi mother to which he
answer that she manifest herself veri rare as to her appear
and attribut he would sai noth except that the former chang from
time to time and that when she chose to us it she had all power
the priest of her colleg he inform us number three hundr
never more nor less and there were also three hundr priestess
certain of those who desir it were allow to marri and from
among their children were rear up the new gener of priest
and priestess thu thei were a peopl apart from all other with
distinct racial characterist thi inde wa evid for our
escort were all exceedingli like to each other veri handsom and
refin in appear with dark ey cleancut featur and olivehu
skin such a peopl as might well have descend from eastern of high
blood with a dash of that of the egyptian and greek thrown in
we ask him whether the mighti loop pillar that tower from the
topmost cup of the mountain wa the work of men he answer no the
hand of natur had fashion it and that the light shine through it
came from the fire which burn in the crater of the volcano the first
priestess have recogn in thi gigant column the familiar symbol
of life of the egyptian worship establish her altar beneath it
shadow
for the rest the mountain with it mighti slope and borderland wa
peopl by a multitud of halfsavag folk who accept the rule of the
hesea bring her tribut of all thing necessari such as food and
metal much of the meat and grain howev the priest rais themselv
on shelter farm and the metal thei work with their own hand
thi rule howev wa of a moral natur sinc for centuri the
colleg had sought no conquest and the mother content herself with
punish crime in some such fashion as we had seen for the petti
war between the tribe and the peopl of the plain thei were not
respons and those chief who carri them on were depos unless
thei had themselv been attack all the tribe howev were sworn
to the defenc of the hesea and the colleg and howev much thei
might quarrel amongst themselv if need aros were readi to die for
her to the last man that war must on dai break out again between
the priest of the mountain and the peopl of kaloon wa recogn
therefor thei endeavour to be prepar for that great and final
struggl
such wa the gist of hi histori which as we learn afterward
prove to be true in everi particular
toward sundown we came to a vast cup extend over mani thousand
acr situat beneath the snowlin of the peak and fill with rich
soil wash down i suppos from abov so shelter wa the place by
it configur and the overhang mountain that face southwest
as it did notwithstand it altitud it produc corn and other
temper crop in abund here the colleg had it farm and veri
well cultiv these seem to be thi great cup which could not
be seen from below we enter through a kind of natur gatewai that
might be easili defend against a host
there were other peculiar but it is not necessari to describ them
further than to sai that i think the soil benefit by the natur heat
of the volcano and that when thi erupt as happen occasion
the lava stream alwai pass to the north and south of the cup of
land inde it wa these lava stream that had built up the protect
cliff
cross the gardenlik land we came to a small town beautifulli
built of lava rock here dwelt the priest except those who were on
duti no man of the tribe or other stranger be allow to set foot
within the place
follow the main street of thi town we arriv at the face of the
precipic beyond and found ourselv in front of a vast archwai close
with massiv iron gate fantast wrought here take my hors
with them our escort left us alon with oro as we drew near the great
gate swung back upon their hing we pass themwith what sensat
i cannot describeand grope our wai down a short corridor which end
in tall ironcov door these also roll open at our approach and
next instant we stagger back amaz and halfblind by the intens
blaze of light within
imagin you who read the nave of the vastest cathedr with which you
ar acquaint then doubl or trebl it size and you will have some
concept of that templ in which we found ourselv perhap in the
begin it had been a cave who can sai but now it sheer wall it
multitudin column spring to the arch roof far abov us had all
been work on and fashion by the labour of men long dead doubtless
the old fireworshipp of thousand of year ago
you will wonder how so great a place wa light but i think that never
would you guess thusbi twist column of live flame i count
eighteen of them but there mai have been other thei sprang from the
floor at regular interv along the line of what in a cathedr would
be the aisl right to the roof thei sprang of even height and girth
so fierc wa the forc of the natur ga that drove them and there
were lost i suppos through chimnei bore in the thick of the
rock nor did thei give off smell or smoke or in that great cold
place ani heat which could be notic onli an intens white light like
that of molten iron and a sharp hiss nois as of a million angri
snake
the huge templ wa utterli desert and save for thi sybil
pervad sound utterli silent an awesom an overpow place
do these candl of your ever go out ask leo of oro place hi
hand befor hi dazzl ey
how can thei repli the priest in hi smooth matteroffact voic
see that thei rise from the etern fire which the builder of thi
hall worship thu thei have burn from the begin and thu
thei will burn for ever though if we wish it we can shut off their
light be pleas to follow me you will see greater thing
thi as i ascertain afterward wa done by thrust
a broad stone of great thick over the apertur through
which the ga or fire rush and thu cut off the air
these stone were work to and fro by mean of pullei
connect with iron rodsl h h
so in aw silenc we follow and oh how small and miser we
three human be look alon in that vast templ illumin by thi
lightn radianc we reach the end of it at length onli to find
that to right and left ran transept on a like gigant scale and lit in
the same amaz fashion here oro bade us halt and we wait a littl
while till present from either transept aros a sound of chant
and we perceiv two whiterob process advanc toward us from
their depth
on thei came veri slowli and we saw that the process to the right
wa a compani of priest and that to the left a compani of priestess
a hundr or so of them in all
now the men rang themselv in front of us while the women rang
themselv behind and at a signal from oro all of them still chant
some wild and thrill hymn onc more we start forward thi time
along a narrow galleri close at the end with doubl wooden door as
our process reach these thei open and befor us lai the crown
wonder of thi marvel fane a vast ellipseshap aps now we
understood the plan of the templ wa the plan of the loop pillar
which stood upon the brow of the peak and as we rightli guess it
dimens were the same
at interv around thi ellips the fieri column flare but otherwis
the place wa empti
no not quit for at the head of the aps almost between two of the
flame column stood a plain squar altar of the size of a small room
in front of which as we saw when we drew nearer were hung curtain of
woven silver thread on thi altar wa place a larg statu of silver
that back as it wa by the black rock seem to concentr and
reflect from it burnish surfac the intens light of the two blaze
pillar
it wa a love thing but to describ it is hard inde the figur
which wa wing repres a drape woman of matur year and pure
but graciou form half hidden by the forwardbend wing shelter
by these yet shown between them appear the imag of a male child
clasp to it bearer breast with her left arm while the right wa
rais toward the sky a studi of motherhood evid but how shall i
write of all that wa convei by those graven face
to begin with the child it wa that of a sturdi boi full of health and
the joi of life yet he had been sleep and in hi sleep some terror
had overshadow him with the dark shade of death and evil there wa
fear in the line of hi sweet mouth and on the lip and cheek that
seem to quiver he had thrown hi littl arm about hi mother neck
and press close against her breast look up to her for safeti hi
right hand and outstretch finger point downward and behind him as
though to indic whenc the danger came yet it wa pass alreadi
halfforgotten for the upturn ey express confid renew
peac of soul attain
and the mother she did not seem to mock or chide hi fear for
her love face wa anxiou and alert yet upon it breath a veri
atmospher of unchang tender and power invinc care for the
helpless strength to shelter it from everi harm the great calm ey
told their stori the part lip were whisper some tale of hope
sure and immort the rais hand reveal whenc that hope aros all
love seem to be concentr in the brood figur so human yet so
celesti all heaven seem to lie an open path befor those quiver
wing and see the arch instep the upwardspring foot suggest
that thither those wing were bound bear their godgiven burden far
from the horror of the earth deep into the bosom of a changeless rest
abov
the statu wa onli that of an affright child in it mother
arm it interpret made clear even to the dullest by the simpl
symbol of some geniushuman save by the divin
while we gaze at it enchant beauti the priest and priestess
file awai to right and left arrang themselv altern first a
man and then a woman within the ring of the column of fire that burn
around the loopshap shrine so great wa it circumfer that the
whole hundr of them must stand wide apart on from anoth and to
our sight resembl littl lone children clad in gleam garment
while their chant of worship reach us onli like echo thrown from
a far precipic in short the effect of thi holi shrine and it
occup wa superb yet overwhelm at least i know that it fill me
with a feel akin to fear
oro wait till the last priest had reach hi appoint place then
he turn and said in hi gentl rever tonesdraw nigh now o
wander wellbelov and give greet to the mother and he point
toward the statu
where is she ask leo in a whisper for here we scarc dare to
speak aloud i see no on
the hesea dwell yonder he answer and take each of us by the
hand he led us forward across the great empti of the aps to the
altar at it head
as we drew near the distant chant of the priest gather in volum
assum a glad triumphant note and it seem to methough thi
perhap wa fancythat the light from the twist column of flame grew
even brighter
at length we were there and oro loos our hand prostrat
himself thrice befor the altar then he rose again and fall behind
us stood in silenc with bent head and fold finger we stood silent
also our heart fill with mingl hope and fear like a cup with wine
were our labour end had we found her whom we sought or were we
perchanc but enmesh in the web of some marvel mummeri and
about to make acquaint with the secret of anoth new and mystic
worship for year and year we had search endur everi hard of
flesh and spirit that man can suffer and now we were to learn whether
we had endur in vain ye and leo would learn if the promis wa
to be fulfil to him or whether she whom he ador had becom but a
depart dream to be sought for onli beyond the gate of death littl
wonder that he trembl and turn white in the agoni of that great
suspens
long long wa the time hour year ag aeon seem to flow over
us as we stood there befor glitter silver curtain that hid the
front of the black altar beneath the mysteri of the sphinxlik face
of the gloriou imag which wa it guardian cloth with that frozen
smile of etern love and piti all the past went befor us as we
struggl in those dark water of our doubt item by item event by
event we rehears the stori which began in the cave of kor for our
thought so long attun were open to each other and flash from soul
to soul
oh now we knew thei were open also to anoth soul we could see
noth save the altar and the effigi we could onli hear the slow chant
of the priest and priestess and the snakelik hiss of the rush
fire yet we knew that our heart were as an open book to on who
watch beneath the mother shadow wing
chapter xiv
the court of death
now the curtain were open befor us appear a chamber hollow from
the thick of the altar and in it centr a throne and on the
throne a figur clad in wave of billowi white flow from the head
over the arm of the throne down to it marbl step we could see no
more in the compar dark of that place save that beneath the
fold of the draperi the oracl held in it hand a loopshap jewel
sceptr
move by some impuls we did as oro had done prostrat ourselv
and there remain upon our knee at length we heard a tinkl as of
littl bell and look up saw that the sistrumshap sceptr wa
stretch toward us by the drape arm which held it then a thin clear
voic spoke and i thought that it trembl a littl it spoke in greek
but in a much purer greek than all these peopl us
i greet you wander who have journei so far to visit thi most
ancient shrine and although doubtless of some other faith ar not
asham to do rever to that unworthi on who is for thi time it
oracl and the guardian of it mysteri rise now and have no fear of
me for have i not sent my messeng and servant to conduct you to thi
sanctuari
slowli we rose and stood silent not know what to sai
i greet you wander the voic repeat tell me thouand the
sceptr point toward leohow art thou name

leo vincei i like the name which to me well befit a man so goodli
and thou the companion ofleo vincei

while the hesea still spoke the silveri curtain swung to their place
as mysteri as thei had open then as though at some signal the
blackrob priest advanc surround aten thei led her from the
sanctuari accompani by her uncl the shaman who as it seem to me
either through fatigu or fear could scarc stand upon hi feet but
stood blink hi dim ey as though the light daze him when these
were gone the priest and priestess who all thi time had been
rang round the wall far out of hear of our talk gather
themselv into their separ compani and still chant depart
also leav us alon with oro and the corps of the khan which
remain where it had been set down
now the headpriest oro beckon to us to follow him and we went
also nor wa i sorri to leav the place for it deathlik
lonelinessenhanc strang enough as it wa by the flood of light
that fill it a loneli which wa concentr and express in the
aw figur stretch upon the bier oppress and overcam us whose
nerv were broken by all that we had undergon thank enough wa i
when have pass the transept and down the length of the vast nave
we came to the iron door the rock passag and the outer gate which
as befor open to let us through and so at last into the sweet cold
air of the night at that hour which preced the dawn
oro led us to a hous wellbuilt and furnish where at hi bid
like men in a dream we drank of some liquor which he gave us i think
that drink wa drug at least after swallow it i rememb no
more till i awok to find myself ly on a bed and feel wonderfulli
strong and well thi i thought strang for a lamp burn in the room
show me that it wa still dark and therefor that i could have rest
but a littl time
i tri to sleep again but wa not abl so fell to think till i
grew weari of the task for here thought would not help me noth
could help except the truth that fear thing as the veil
priestess had call it
oh what if she should prove not the ayesha whom we desir but some
fear thing what were the mean of the khania hint and of
her bold that sure had been inspir by the strength of a hidden
knowledg what ifnai it could not bei would rise and dress my arm
or i would wake leo and make him dress itanyth to occupi my mind
until the appoint hour when we must learnth bestor the worst
i sat up in the bed and saw a figur advanc toward me it wa oro
who bore a lamp in hi hand
you have slept long friend holli he said and now it is time to be
up and do
long i answer testili how can that be when it is still dark
becaus friend the dark is that of a new night mani hour have gone
by sinc you lai down upon thi bed well you were wise to rest you
while you mai for who know when you will sleep again come let me
bath your arm
tell me i broke innai friend he interrupt firmli i will
tell you noth except that soon you must start to be present at
the funer of the khan and perchanc to learn the answer to your
question
ten minut later he led me to the eatingchamb of the hous where i
found leo alreadi dress for oro had awaken him befor he came to
me and bidden him to prepar himself oro told us here that the hesea
had not suffer us to be disturb until the night came again sinc we
had much to undergo that dai so present we start
onc more we were led through the flamelit hall till we came to the
loopshap aps the place wa empti now even the corps of the khan
had gone and no drape oracl sat in the altar shrine for it silver
curtain were drawn and we saw that it wa unten
the mother ha depart to do honour to the dead accord to the
ancient custom oro explain to us
then we pass the altar and behind the statu found a door in the
rock wall of the aps and beyond the door a passag and a hall as of a
hous for out of it open other door lead to chamber these our
guid told us were the dwellingplac of the hesea and her maiden
he ad that thei ran to the side of the mountain and had window that
open on to garden and let in the light and air in thi hall six
priest were wait each of whom carri a bundl of torch beneath
hi arm and held in hi hand a light lamp
our road run through the dark said oro though were it dai we
might climb the outer snow but thi at night it is danger to do
then take torch he lit them at a lamp and gave on to each of us
now our climb began up endless slope galleri we went hewn with
inconceiv labour by the primev fireworshipp from the live
rock of the mountain it seem to me that thei stretch for mile and
inde thi wa so sinc although the slope wa alwai gentl it took
us more than an hour to climb them at length we came to the foot of a
great stair
rest awhil here my lord oro said bow to leo with the rever
that he had shown him from the first for thi stair is steep and long
now we stand upon the mountain topmost lip and ar about to climb
that tall loop column which soar abov
so we sat down in the vaultlik place and let the sharp draught of air
rush to and from the passag plai upon us for we were heat with
journei up those close galleri as we sat thu i heard a roar
sound and ask oro what it might be he answer that we were veri
near to the crater of the volcano and that what we heard through the
thick of the rock wa the rush of it everlast fire then the
ascent commenc
it wa not danger though veri wearisom for there were nearli six
hundr of those step the climb of the passag had remind me of
that of the galleri of the great pyramid drawn out for whole furlong
that of the pillar wa like the ascent of a cathedr spire or rather
of sever spire pile on upon anoth
rest from time to time we drag ourselv up the steep step each
of them quit a foot in height till the pillar wa climb and onli the
loop remain up it we went also oro lead us and glad wa i that
the stairwai still ran within the substanc of the rock for i could
feel the needl mighti ey quiver in the rush of the wind which swept
about it side
at length we saw light befor us and in anoth twenti step emerg
upon a platform as leo who went in front of me walk from the
stairwai i saw oro and anoth priest seiz him by the arm and call
to him to ask what thei were do
noth he cri back except that thi is a dizzi place and thei
fear lest i should fall mind how you come horac and he stretch
out hi hand to me
now i wa clear of the tunnel and i believ that had it not been for
that hand i should have sunk to the rocki floor for the sight befor me
seem to paralys my brain nor wa thi to be wonder at for i doubt
whether the world can show such anoth
we stood upon the veri apex of the loop a flat space of rock about
eighti yard in length by some thirti in breadth with the starstrewn
sky abov us to the south twenti thousand feet or more below
stretch the dim plain of kaloon and to the east and west the
snowclad shoulder of the peak and the broad brown slope beneath
to the north wa a differ sight and on more awesom there right
under us as it seem for the pillar bent inward lai the vast crater
of the volcano and in the centr of it a wide lake of fire that broke
into bubbl and flower of sudden flame or spout writh and twist
like an angri sea
from the surfac of thi lake rose smoke and gase that took fire as
thei float upward and mingl togeth form a gigant sheet of
live light right opposit to us burn thi sheet and the flare of
it pass through the needleey of the pillar under us sped awai in
on dazzl beam across the countri of kaloon across the mountain
beyond till it wa lost on the horizon
the wind blew from south to north be suck in toward the hot
crater of the volcano and it fierc breath that scream through the
ey of the pillar and against it rug surfac bent the long crest
of the sheet of flame as an ocean roller is bent over by the gale and
tore from it fragment of fire that float awai to leeward like the
blownout sail of a burn ship
had it not been for thi strong and steadi wind inde no creatur
could have live upon the pillar for the vapour would have poison
him but it unceas blast drove these all awai toward the north for
the same reason in the thin air of that ici place the heat wa not too
great to be endur
appal by that terrif spectacl which seem more appropri to
the terror of the pit than to thi earth of our and fear lest the
blast should whirl me like a dead leaf into the glow gulf beneath i
fell on to my sound hand and my knee shout to leo to do likewis
and look about me now i observ line of priest wrap in great
cape kneel upon the face of the rock and engag appar in
prayer but of he the mother or of aten or of the corps of the dead
khan i could see noth
whilst i wonder where thei might be oro upon whose nerv thi
dread scene appear to have no effect and some of our attend
priest surround us and led us onward by a path that ran peril
near to the round edg of the rock a few downward step and we found
that we were under shelter for the gale wa roar over us twenti
more pace and we came to a recess cut i suppos by man in the face
of the loop in such fashion that a lava roof wa left project half
across it width
thi recess or rock chamber which wa larg enough to shelter a great
number of peopl we reach safe to discov that it wa alreadi
tenant seat in a chair hewn from the rock wa the hesea wear
a broider purpl mantl abov her gauzi wrap that envelop
her from head to foot there too stand near to her were the khania
aten and her uncl the old shaman who look but ill at eas and
lastli stretch upon hi funer couch the fieri light beat upon
hi stark form and face lai the dead khan rassen
we advanc to the throne and bow to her who sat thereon the hesea
lift her hood head which seem to have been sunk upon her breast
as though she were overcom by thought or care and address oro the
priest for in the shelter of those massiv wall by comparison there
wa silenc and folk could hear each other speak
so thou hast brought them safe my servant she said and i am
glad for to those that know it not thi road is fear my guest
what sai you of the buryingpit of the children of he
our faith tell us of a hell ladi answer leo and i think that
yonder cauldron look like it mouth
nai she answer there is no hell save that which from life to
life we fashion for ourselv within the circl of thi littl star leo
vincei i tell thee that hell is here ay here and she struck her
hand upon her breast while onc more her head droop forward as though
bow down beneath some load of secret miseri
thu she stai awhil then lift it and spoke again
sayingmidnight is past and much must be done and suffer befor the
dawn ay the dark must be turn to light or perchanc the light
to etern dark
royal woman she went on address aten as is hi right thou
hast brought thy dead lord hither for burial in thi consecr place
where the ash of all who went befor him have becom fuel for the
holi fire oro my priest summon thou the accus and him who make
defenc and let the book be open that i mai pass my judgment on the
dead and call hi soul to live again or prai that from it the breath
of life mai be withheld
priest i sai the court of death is open
chapter xv
the second ordeal
oro bow and left the place whereon the hesea sign to us to stand
upon her right and to aten to stand upon her left present from
either side the hood priest and priestess stole into the chamber
and to the number of fifti or more rang themselv along it wall
then came two figur drape in black and mask who bore parchment
book in their hand and place themselv on either side of the
corps while oro stood at it feet face the hesea
now she lift the sistrum that she held and in obedi to the signal
oro saidlet the book be open
thereon the mask accus to the right broke the seal of hi book and
began to read it page it wa a tale of the sin of thi dead man
enter as fulli as though that offic were hi own conscienc given
life and voic in cold and horribl detail it told of the evil do
of hi childhood of hi youth and of hi riper year and thu mass
togeth the record wa black inde
i listen amaz wonder what spy had been set upon the deed of
yonder man throughout hi dai think also with a shudder of how
heavi would be the tale against ani on of us if such a spy should
companion him from the cradl to the grave rememb too that
full sure thi count is kept by scribe even more watch than the
minist of he
at length the long stori drew to it close lastli it told of the murder
of that nobl upon the bank of the river it told of the plot against
our live for no just caus it told of our cruel hunt with the
deathhound and of it end then the accus shut hi book and cast it
on the ground sayingsuch is the record o mother sum it up as thou
hast been given wisdom
without speak the hesea point with her sistrum to the defend
who thereon broke the seal of hi book and began to read
it tale spoke of all the good that the dead man had done of everi
nobl word that he had said of everi kind action of plan which he had
made for the welfar of hi vassal of temptat to ill that he had
resist of the true love that he had born to the woman who becam hi
wife of the prayer which he had made and of the offer which he had
sent to the templ of he
make no mention of her name it told of how that wife of hi had hate
him of how she and the magician who had foster and educ her and
wa her rel and guid had set other women to lead him astrai that
she might be free of him of how too thei had driven him mad with a
poison drink which took awai hi judgment unchain all the evil in
hi heart and caus him by it bane influenc to shrink unnatur
from her whose love he still desir
also it set out that the heaviest of hi crime were inspir by thi
wife of hi who sought to befoul hi name in the ear of the peopl
whom she led him to oppress and how bitter jealousi drove him to cruel
act the last and worst of which caus him foulli to violat the law
of hospit and in attempt to bring about the death of blameless
guest at their hand to find hi own
thu the defend read and have read close the book and threw it
on the ground sayingsuch is the record o mother sum it up as thou
hast been given wisdom
then the khania who all thi time had stood cold and impass step
forward to speak and with her her uncl the shaman simbri but befor
a word pass aten lip the hesea rais her sceptr and forbad
them sayingthi dai of trial is not yet nor have we aught to do with
thee when thou liest where he li and the book of thy deed ar read
aloud to her who sit in judgment then let thine advoc make answer
for these thing
so be it answer aten haughtili and fell back
now it wa the turn of the highpriest oro mother he said thou
hast heard balanc the write assess the truth and accord to thy
wisdom issu thy command shall we hurl him who wa rassen feet first
into the fieri gulf that he mai walk again in the path of life or
head first in token that he is dead inde
then while all wait in a hush expect the great priestess
deliv her verdict
i hear i balanc i assess but judg i do not who claim no such
power let the spirit who sent him forth to whom he is return again
pass judgment on hi spirit thi dead on ha sin deepli yet ha
he been more deepli sin against nor against that man can be reckon
the account of hi deed of mad cast him then to hi grave feet
first that hi name mai be whiten in the ear of those unborn and
that thenc he mai return again at the time appoint it is spoken
now the accus lift the book of hi accus from the ground and
advanc hurl it into the gulf in token that it wa blot out
then he turn and vanish from the chamber while the advoc take
up hi book gave it into the keep of the priest oro that it might
be preserv in the archiv of the templ for ever thi done the
priest began a funer chant and a solemn invoc to the great lord
of the underworld that he would receiv thi spirit and acquit it there
as here it had been acquit by the hesea hi minist
er their dirg end certain of the priest advanc with slow step
lift the bier and carri it to the edg of the gulf then at a sign
from the mother hurl it feet foremost into the fieri lake below
whilst all watch to see how it struck the flame for thi thei held to
be an omen sinc should the bodi turn over in it descent it wa taken
as a sign that the judgment of mortal men had been refus in the place
of the immort it did not turn it rush downward straight as a
plummet and plung into the fire hundr of feet below and there
for ever vanish thi inde wa not strang sinc as we discov
afterward the feet were weight
in fact thi solemn rite wa but a formula that down to the exact
word of judgment and committ had been practis here from unknown
antiqu over the bodi of the priest and priestess of the
mountain and of certain of the great on of the plain so it wa in
ancient egypt whenc without doubt thi ceremoni of the trial of the
dead wa deriv and so it continu to be in the land of he for no
priestess ever ventur to condemn the soul of on depart
the real interest of the custom apart from it solemn and aw
surround centr in the accur knowledg displai by the mask

although the colleg of he affect to be indiffer to the do and
polit of the peopl of the plain that thei onc rule and over which
whilst secretli await an opportun of reconquest thei still
claim a spiritu author the attitud wa assum rather than
real moreov it suggest a system of espionag so pierc and
extraordinari that it wa difficult to believ it unaid by the
habitu exercis of some gift of clairvoy
the servic if i mai call it so wa finish the dead man had
follow the record of hi sin into that lurid sea of fire and by
now wa but a hand of char dust but if hi book had close our
remain open and at it strangest chapter we knew it all of us and
wait our nerv thrill with expect
the hesea sat brood on her rocki throne she also knew that the hour
had come present she sigh then motion with her sceptr and spoke
a word or two dismiss the priest and priestess who depart
and were seen no more two of them remain howev oro and the head
priestess who wa call papav a young woman of a nobl counten

she wave her hand to show that thi matter wa finish then after
long thought spoke again address herself to the khania
aten last night thou didst ask me a questionwhi thou dost love thi
man and she point to leo to that the answer would be easi for is
he not on who might well stir passion in the breast of a woman such as
thou art but thou didst sai also that thine own heart and the wisdom of
yonder magician thy uncl told thee that sinc thy soul first sprang
to life thou hadst love him and didst adjur me by the power to whom i
must give my account to draw the curtain from the past and let the truth
be known
woman the hour ha come and i obei thy summonsnot becaus thou
dost command but becaus it is my will of the begin i can tell thee
noth who am still human and no goddess i know not why we three
ar wrap in thi coil of fate i know not the destini to which we
journei up the ladder of a thousand live with grief and pain climb
the endless stair of circumst or if i know i mai not sai
therefor i take up the tale where my own memori give me light
the hesea paus and we saw her frame shake as though beneath some
fear inward effort of the will look now behind you she cri
throw her arm wide
we turn and at first saw noth save the great curtain of fire that
rose from the abyss of the volcano whereof as i have told the crest
wa bent over by the wind like the crest of a break billow but
present as we watch in the depth of thi red veil natur aw
lampflam a pictur began to form as it form in the seer magic
crystal
behold a templ set amid sand and wash by a wide palmbord
river and across it pylon court process of priest who pass
to and fro with flaunt banner the court empti i could see the
shadow of a falcon wing that fled across it sunlit floor a man clad
in a priest white robe shavenhead and barefoot enter through
the southern pylon gate and walk slowli toward a paint granit
shrine in which sit the imag of a woman crown with the doubl
crown of egypt surmount by a lotu bloom and hold in her hand the
sacr sistrum now as though he heard some sound he halt and look
toward us and by the heaven abov me hi face is the face of leo
vincei in hi youth the face too of that kallikr whose corps we
had seen in the cave of kor

her knee to the effigi of the goddess her oblat made she turn
to depart and as she goe brush her hand against the hand of the
watch priest who hesit then follow her
when all her compani have pass the gate she linger alon in the
shadow of the pylon whisper to the priest and point to the river
and the southern land beyond he is disturb he reason with her
till after on swift glanc round she let drop her veil bend
toward him andtheir lip meet
as time fli her face is turn toward us and lo it is the face of
aten and amid her duski hair the aura is reflect in jewel gold
the symbol of her royal rank she look at the shaven priest she laugh
as though in triumph she point to the wester sun and to the river
and is gone
ay and that laugh of long ago is echo by aten at our side for she
also laugh in triumph and cri aloud to the old shamantru divin

then like ic on fire fell the cold voic of the hesea
be silent woman and see how thou didst lose him in the past
lo the scene chang and on a couch a love shape li sleep

shadowi form clad with the emblem of the goddess in the shrine but now

slowli all the figur fade it wa as though the fire at them up for
first thei becam thin and white as ash then vanish the hesea who
had been lean forward sank backward in her chair as if weari with
the toil of her own magic
for a while confus pictur flit rapidli to and fro across the vast
mirror of the flame such as might be reflect from an intellig
crowd with the memori of over two thousand year which it wa too

then the hesea spoke in a voic veri faint at first that by slow
degre grew stronger
is thy question answer o aten

dark abov the altar where stand the statu of the mother of men
the voic of the live goddess spoke sayingaccept ye her whom
i have set to rule over you that my judgment and my purpos mai be

the voic ceas the fieri torch burnt again and we bow the knee
to the new hesea and name her mother in the ear of all that is the
tale to which hundr can bear wit

from my heart for now i knew that i wa dear to ayesha as i had alwai
been dear to leo the closest of friend from whom she never would be
part what more could i desir
we fell back we spoke togeth whilst thei watch us silent what
we said i do not quit rememb but the end of it wa that as the
hesea had done leo bade me judg and choos then into my mind there
came a clear command from my own conscienc or otherwher who can
sai thi wa the command that i should bid her to unveil and let fate
declar it purpos
decid said leo i cannot bear much more like that woman whoever
she mai be whatev happen i will not blame you horac
good i answer i have decid and step forward i said we
have taken counsel he and it is our will who would learn the truth
and be at rest that thou shouldst unveil befor us here and now

dy woman onli i beseech you both be piti to me spare me your
mockeri add not the coal of your hate and scorn to the fire of a
soul in hell for whateer i am i becam it for thy sake kallikr
yet yet i also am athirst for knowledg for though i know all wisdom
although i wield much power on thing remain to me to learnwhat is
the worth of the love of man and if inde it can live beyond the
horror of the grave
then rise slowli the hesea walk or rather totter to the
unroof open space in front of the rock chamber and stood there quit
near to the brink of the flame gulf beneath
come hither papav and loos these veil she cri in a shrill
thin voic
papav advanc and with a look of aw upon her handsom face began the
task she wa not a tall woman yet as she bent over her i note that
she seem to tower abov her mistress the hesea
the outer veil fell reveal more within these fell also and now
befor us stood the mummylik shape although it seem to be of less
statur of that strang be who had met us in the place of bone so
it would seem that our mysteri guid and the high priestess he were
the same
look length by length the wrap sank from her would thei
never end how small grew the frame within she wa veri short now
unnatur short for a fullgrown woman and oh i grew sick at heart
the last bandag uncoil themselv like shave from a stick
two wrinkl hand appear if hand thei could be call then the
feetonc i had seen such on the mummi of a princess of egypt and even
now by some fantast plai of the mind i rememb that on her coffin
thi princess wa name the beauti
everyth wa gone now except a shift and a last inner veil about the
head he wave back the priestess papav who fell half faint to
the ground and lai there cover her ey with her hand then utter
someth like a scream she grip thi veil in her thin talon tore
it awai and with a gestur of uttermost despair turn and face us
oh she wasnai i will not describ her i knew her at onc for thu
had i seen her last befor the fire of life and strang enough
through the mask of unutter ag through that cloak of human
last decai still shone some resembl to the gloriou and superhuman
ayesha the shape of the face the air of defiant pride that for an
instant bore her upi know not what
ye there she stood and the fierc light of the heartless fire beat
upon her reveal everi shame
there wa a dread silenc i saw leo lip turn white and hi knee
begin to give but by some effort he recov himself and stai still
and upright like a dead man held by a wire also i saw ateneand thi
is to her creditturn her head awai she had desir to see her rival
humili but that horribl sight shock her some sens of their
common womanhood for the moment touch her piti onli simbri who i
think knew what to expect and oro remain quit unmov inde in
that ghastli silenc the latter spoke and ever afterward i love him
for hi word
what of the vile vessel rot in the grave of time what of the flesh
that perish he said look through the ruin lamp to the etern
light which burn within look through it cover carrion to the
inextinguish soul
my heart applaud these nobl sentiment i wa of on mind with oro
but oh heaven i felt that my brain wa go and i wish that it
would go so that i might hear and see no more
that look which gather on ayesha mummi face at first there had been
a littl hope but the hope di and anguish anguish anguish took
it place
someth must be done thi could not endur my lip clave togeth
no word would come my feet refus to move
i began to contempl the sceneri how wonder were that sheet of
flame and the rippl which ran up and down it height how awesom it
billowi crest it would be warm ly in yonder red gulf below with the
dead rassen but oh i wish that i share hi bed and had finish
with these agoni
thank heaven aten wa speak she had step to the side of the
nakedhead thing and stood by it in all the pride of her rich beauti
and perfect womanhood
leo vincei or kallikr said aten take which name thou wilt
thou thinkest ill of me perhap but know that at least i scorn to mock
a rival in her mortal shame she told us a wild tale but now a tale
true or fals but more fals than true i think of how i rob
a goddess of a votari and of how that goddessayesha self
perchancewa aveng upon me for the crime of yield to the man i
love well let goddessesif such inde there betak their wai and
work their will upon the helpless and i a mortal will take mine
until the clutch of doom close round my throat and choke out life and
memori and i too am a goddessor a clod
meanwhil thou man i shame not to sai it befor all these wit
i love thee and it seem that thisthi woman or goddesslov thee
also and she ha told us that now now thou must choos between us
onc and for ever she ha told us too that if i sin against isi
whose minist be it rememb she declar herself herself she sin
yet more for she would have taken thee both from a heavenli mistress
and from an earthli bride and yet snatch that guerdon of immort
which is her todai therefor if i am evil she is wors nor doe the
flame that burn within the casket whereof oro spoke shine so veri pure
and bright
choos thou then leo vincei and let there be an end i vaunt not
myself thou knowest what i have been and seest what i am yet i can
give thee love and happi and mayhap children to follow after thee
and with them some place and power what yonder witch can give thee thou
canst guess tale of the past pictur on the flame wise maxim and
honei word and after thou art dead onc more promis perhap of
joi to come when that terribl goddess whom she serv so close shall
be appeas i have spoken yet i will add a word
o thou for whom if the hesea tale be true i did onc lai down my
royal rank and dare the danger of an unsail sea o thou whom in ag
gone i would have shelter with my frail bodi from the sorceri of
thi cold selfseek witch o thou whom but a littl while ago at my
own life risk i drew from death in yonder river choos choos
to all thi speech so moder yet so cruel so wellreason and
yet so fals becaus of it gloss and omiss the huddl ayesha
seem to listen with a fierc intent yet she made no answer not
a singl word not a sign even she who had said her sai and scorn to
plead her part
i look at leo ashen face he lean toward aten drawn perhap by
the passion shine in her beauteou ey then of a sudden straighten
himself shook hi head and sigh the colour flame to hi brow and
hi ey grew almost happi
after all he said think aloud rather than speak i have to do
not with unknow past or with mystic futur but with the thing
of my own life ayesha wait for me through two thousand year aten
could marri a man she hate for power sake and then could poison him
as perhap she would poison me when i weari her i know not what oath
i swore to amenarta if such a woman live i rememb the oath i
swore to ayesha if i shrink from her now why then my life is a lie and
my belief a fraud then love will not endur the touch of ag and never
can surviv the grave
nai rememb what ayesha wa i take her as she is in faith and
hope of what she shall be at least love is immort and if it must why
let it feed on memori alon till death set free the soul
then step to where stood the dread shrivel form leo knelt
down befor it and kiss her on the brow
ye he kiss the trembl horror of that wrinkl head and i think
it wa on of the greatest bravest act ever done by man
thou hast chosen said aten in a cold voic and i tell thee leo
vincei that the manner of thy choic make me mourn my loss the more
take now thythi bride and let me henc
but ayesha still said no word and made no sign till present she sank
upon her boni knee and began to prai aloud these were the word of
her prayer as i heard them though the exact power to which it wa
address is not veri easi to determin as i never discov who or
what it wa that she worship in her hearto thou minist of the
almighti will thou sharp sword in the hand of doom thou inevit law
that art name natur thou who wast crown as isi of the egyptian
but art the goddess of all clime and ag thou that leadest the man
to the maid and layest the infant on hi mother breast that bringest
our dust to it kindr dust that givest life to death and into the
dark of death breathest the light of life again thou who causest the
abund earth to bear whose smile is spring whose laugh is the rippl
of the sea whose noontid rest is drowsi summer and whose sleep is
winter night hear thou the supplic of thy chosen child and
minist
of old thou gavest me thine own strength with deathless dai and
beauti abov everi daughter of thi star but i sin against thee
sore and for my sin i paid in endless centuri of solitud in the
vile that make me loathsom to my lover ey and for it diadem
of perfect power set upon my brow thi crown of nake mockeri yet in
thy breath the swift essenc that brought me light that brought me
gloom thou didst vow to me that i who cannot die should onc more pluck
the lost flower of my immort loveli from thi foul slime of shame
therefor merci mother that bore me to thee i make my prayer
oh let hi true love aton my sin or if it mai not be then give me
death the last and most bless of thy boon
chapter xvi
the chang
she ceas and there wa a long long silenc leo and i look at
each other in dismai we had hope against hope that thi beauti
and piteou prayer address appar to the great dumb spirit of
natur would be answer that meant a miracl but what of it the
prolong of the life of ayesha wa a miracl though it is true that
some humbl reptil ar said to live as long as she had done
the transfer of her spirit from the cave of kor to thi templ wa
a miracl that is to our western mind though the dweller in these
part of central asia would not hold it so that she should reappear
with the same hideou bodi wa a miracl but wa it the same bodi wa
it not the bodi of the last hesea on veri ancient woman is much like
anoth and eighteen year of the work of the soul or ident
within might well wear awai their trivial differ and give to the
borrow form some resembl to that which it had left
at least the figur on that mirror of the flame were a miracl nai
why so a hundr clairvoy in a hundr citi can produc or see
their like in water and in crystal the differ be onli on
of size thei were but reflect of scene familiar to the mind of
ayesha or perhap not so much as that perhap thei were onli phantasm
call up in our mind by her mesmer forc
nai none of these thing were true miracl sinc all howev
strang might be capabl of explan what right then had we to
expect a marvel now
such thought as these rose in our mind as the endless minut were
born and di andnoth happen
ye at last on thing did happen the light from the sheet of flame
di gradual awai as the flame itself sank downward into the abyss
of the pit but about thi in itself there wa noth wonder for
as we had seen with our own ey from afar thi fire vari much and
inde it wa customari for it to die down at the approach of dawn
which now drew veri near
still that onwardcreep dark ad to the terror of the scene
by the last rai of the lurid light we saw ayesha rise and advanc some
few pace to that littl tongu of rock at the edg of the pit off
which the bodi of rassen had been hurl saw her stand on it also
look like some black misshapen imp against the smoki glow which
still rose from the depth beneath
leo would have gone forward to her for he believ that she wa about
to hurl herself to doom which inde i thought wa her design but the
priest oro and the priestess papav obei i suppos some secret
command that reach them i know not how sprang to him and seiz hi
arm held him back then it becam quit dark and through the dark
we could hear ayesha chant a dirgelik hymn in some secret holi
tongu which wa unknown to us
a great flake of fire float through the gloom rock to and fro like
some vast bird upon it pinion we had seen mani such that night torn
by the gale from the crest of the blaze curtain as i have describ
butbuthorac whisper leo through hi chatter teeth that
flame is come up against the wind
perhap the wind ha chang i answer though i knew well that it
had not that it blew stronger than ever from the south
nearer and nearer sail the rock flame two enorm wing wa the
shape of it with someth dark between them it reach the littl
promontori the wing appear to fold themselv about the dwarf
figur that stood thereonillumin it for a moment then the light
went out of them and thei vanishedeveryth vanish
a while pass it mai have been on minut or ten when suddenli the
priestess papav in obedi to some summon which we could not hear
crept by me i knew that it wa she becaus her woman garment touch
me as she went anoth space of silenc and of deep dark dure
which i heard papav return breath in short sob gasp like on
who is veri frighten
ah i thought ayesha ha cast herself into the pit the tragedi is
finish
then it wa that the wondrou music came of cours it mai have been
onli the sound of priest chant beyond us but i do not think so
sinc it qualiti wa quit differ to ani that i heard in the templ
befor or afterward to ani inde that ever i heard upon the earth
i cannot describ it but it wa aw to listen to yet most
entranc from the black smokeveil pit where the fire had burn
it well and echoednow a singl heavenli voic now a sweet choru
and now an airshak thunder as of a hundr organ plai to time
that divers and majest harmoni seem to includ to express
everi human emot and i have often thought sinc then that in it
allembrac scope and rang thi the song or paean of her rebirth
wa symbol of the infinit varieti of ayesha spirit yet like that
spirit it had it master note power passion suffer mysteri and
loveli also there could be no doubt as to the gener signific
of the chant by whomsoev it wa sung it wa the chang stori of a
mighti soul it wa worship worship worship of a queen divin
like slow cloud of incens fade to the banner roof of some high
choir the burst of unearthli melodi grew faint in the far distanc
of the hollow pit thei wail themselv awai
look from the east a singl rai of upwardspring light
behold the dawn said the quiet voic of oro
that rai pierc the heaven abov our head a veri sword of flame it
sank downward swiftli suddenli it fell not upon us for as yet
the rocki wall of our chamber ward it awai but on to the littl
promontori at it edg
oh and therea glori cover with a singl garmentstood a shape
celesti it seem to be asleep sinc the ey were shut or wa it
dead for at first that face wa a face of death look the sunlight
plai upon her shine through the thin veil the dark ey open
like the ey of a wonder child the blood of life flow up the
ivori bosom into the pallid cheek the raiment of black and curl
tress waver in the wind the head of the jewel snake that held
them sparkl beneath her breast
wa it an illus or wa thi ayesha as she had been when she enter
the roll flame in the cavern of kor our knee gave wai beneath us
and down our arm about each other neck leo and i sank till we

whisper of a twilight breez among the reed spoke near to us and
these were the word it saidcom hither to me kallikr who
would pai thee back that redeem kiss of faith and love thou gavest me

out her hand to rais him whisper in hi ear the while
still he would not or could not rise so veri slowli she bent over him
and touch him with her lip upon the brow next she beckon to me i
came and would have knelt also but she suffer it not
nai she said in her rich rememb voic thou art no suitor it

a plenti if i will or even if i will it not but where shall i find
anoth friend like to thee o holli whom thu i greet and lean
toward me with her lip she touch me also on the browjust touch

fragrant wa ayesha breath as rose the odour of rose clung to her
love hair her sweet bodi gleam like some white seapearl a faint
but palpabl radianc crown her head no sculptor ever fashion such
a marvel as the arm with which she held her veil about her no star in
heaven ever shone more pure bright than did her calm entranc ey
yet it is true even with her lip upon me all i felt for her wa a
love divin into which no human passion enter onc i acknowledg to
my shame it wa otherwis but i am an old man now and have done with
such frailti moreov had not ayesha name me guardian protector
friend and sworn to me that with her and leo i should ever dwell where

take leo by the hand ayesha return with him into the shelter of the
rockhewn chamber and when she enter it shadow shiver a littl as
though with cold i rejoic at thi i rememb for it seem to show
me that she still wa human divin as she might appear here her priest
and priestess prostrat themselv befor her newborn splendour but
she motion to them to rise lai a hand upon the head of each as
though in bless i am cold she said give me my mantl and
papav threw the purplebroid garment upon her shoulder whenc now

nai she went on it is not thi longlost shape of mine which in
hi kiss my lord gave back to me that shiver in the ici wind it is my
spirit self bare to the bitter breath of destini o my love my

upon hi breast
onli thou beauti he answer a dim shadow of thing to come i

doubtless mani a khan of kaloon will lie here she answer coldli
fear not shaman my wrath is past yet be wise mine enemi and
prophesi no more evil to the great come let us henc
so still led by leo she pass from that chamber and stood present
upon the apex of the soar pillar the sun wa up now flood the
mountain flank the plain of kaloon far beneath and the distant
misti peak with a sheen of gold ayesha stood consid the mighti
prospect then address leo she saidth world is veri fair i give
it all to thee
now aten spoke for the first time
dost thou mean hesif thou art still the hesea and not a demon
arisen from the pitthat thou offerest my territori to thi man as a
lovegift if so i tell thee that first thou must conquer them
ungentl ar thy word and mien answer ayesha yet i forgiv them
both for i also can scorn to mock a rival in my hour of victori when
thou wast the fairer thou didst proffer him these veri land but sai
who is the fairer now look at us all of you and judg and she stood
by aten and smile
the khania wa a love woman never to my knowledg have i seen on
loveli but oh how coars and poor she show besid the wild
ether beauti of ayesha born again for that beauti wa not altogeth
human far less so inde than it had been in the cave of kor now it
wa the beauti of a spirit
the littl light that alwai shone upon ayesha brow the wideset
madden ey which were fill sometim with the fire of the star
and sometim with the blue dark of the heaven wherein thei float
the curv lip so wist yet so proud the tress fine as glossi
silk that still spread and rippl as though with a separ life the
gener air not so much of majesti as of some secret power hard to
be restrain which strove in that delic bodi and proclaim it
presenc to the most careless that flame of the soul within whereof
oro had spoken shine now through no vile vessel but in a vase
of alabast and of pearlnon of these thing and qualiti were
altogeth human i felt it and wa afraid and aten felt it also for
she answeredi am but a woman what thou art thou knowest best still
a taper cannot shine midst yonder fire or a glowworm against a fallen
star nor can my mortal flesh compar with the glori thou hast earn
from hell in payment for thy gift and homag to the lord of ill yet as
woman i am thy equal and as spirit i shall be thy mistress when rob
of these borrow beauti thou ayesha standest nake and asham
befor the judg of all whom thou hast desert and defi ye as thou
stoodest but now upon yonder brink abov the burn pit where thou yet
shalt wander wail thy lost love for thi i know mine enemi that
man and spirit cannot mate and aten ceas choke in her bitter
rage and jealousi
now watch ayesha i saw her winc a littl beneath these evilomen
word saw also a ting of grei touch the carmin of her lip and her
deep ey grow dark and troubl but in a moment her fear had gone and
she wa ask in a voic that rang clear as silver bellswhi ravest
thou aten like some shortliv summer torrent against the barrier
of a seamless cliff dost think poor creatur of an hour to sweep awai
the rock of my etern strength with foam and burst bubbl have
done and listen i do not seek thy petti rule who if i will it can
take the empir of the world yet learn thou holdest it of my hand
morei purpos soon to visit thee in thy citychoos thou if it shall
be in peac or war therefor khania purg thy court and amend thy
law that when i come i mai find content in the land which now it
lack and confirm thee in thy govern my counsel to thee also is
that thou choos some worthi man to husband let him be whom thou wilt
if onli he is just and upright and on upon whom thou mayest rest
need wise guidanc as thou dost aten come now my guest let
us henc and she walk past the khania step fearlessli upon the
veri edg of the windswept round peak
in a second the attempt had been made and fail so quickli inde that
it wa not until leo and i compar our impress afterward that we
could be sure of what had happen as ayesha pass her the madden
khania drew a hidden dagger and struck with all her forc at her rival
back i saw the knife vanish to the hilt in her bodi as i thought but
thi cannot have been so sinc it fell to the ground and she who should
have been dead took no hurt at all
feel that she had fail with a movement like the sudden lurch of
a ship aten thrust at ayesha propos to hurl her to destruct
in the depth beneath lo her outstretch arm went past her although
ayesha never seem to stir ye it wa aten who would have fallen
aten who alreadi fell had not ayesha put out her hand and caught
her by the wrist bear all her backwardswai weight as easili as
though she were but an infant and without effort draw her to safeti
foolish woman she said in piti tone wast thou so vex that
thou wouldst strip thyself of the pleasant shape which heaven ha
given thee sure thi is mad aten for how knowest thou in what
like thou mightest be sent to tread the earth again as no queen
perhap but as a peasant child deform unsightli for such reward
it is said is given to those that achiev selfmurd or even as mani
think shape like a beasta snake a cat a tigress why see and
she pick the dagger from the ground and cast it into the air that
point wa poison had it but prick thee now and she smile at her
and shook her head
but aten could bear no more of thi mockeri more venom than her own
steel
thou art not mortal she wail how can i prevail against thee to
heaven i leav thy punish and there upon the rocki peak aten sank
down and wept
leo stood nearest to her and the sight of thi royal woman in her
miseri prove too much for him to bear step to her side he stoop
and lift her to her feet mutter some kind word for a moment she
rest on hi arm then shook herself free of him and took the proffer
hand of her old uncl simbri
i see said ayesha that as ever thou art courteou my lord leo
but it is best that her own servant should take charg of her forsh
mai hide more dagger come the dai grow and sure we need rest
chapter xvii
the betroth
togeth we descend the multitudin step and pass the endless
rockhewn passag till we came to the door of the dwell of the
highpriestess and were led through it into a hall beyond here ayesha
part from us sai that she wa outworn as inde she seem to be
with an utter weari not of the bodi but of the spirit for her
delic form droop like a rainladen lili her ey grew dim as those
of a person in a tranc and her voic came in a soft sweet whisper
the voic of on speak in her sleep
goodby she said to us oro will guard you both and lead you to
me at the appoint time rest you well
so she went and the priest led us into a beauti apart that open
on to a shelter garden so overcom were we also by all that we had
endur and seen that we could scarc speak much less discuss these
marvel event
my brain swim said leo to oro i desir to sleep
he bow and conduct us to a chamber where were bed and on these we
flung ourselv down and slept dreamlessli like littl children
when we awok it wa afternoon we rose and bath then sai that
we wish to be alon went togeth into the garden where even at
thi altitud now at the end of august the air wa still mild and
pleasant behind a rock by a bed of campanula and other mountain
flower and fern wa a bench near to the bank of a littl stream on
which we seat ourselv
what have you to sai horac ask leo lai hi hand upon my arm
sai i answer that thing have come about most marvel that
we have dream aright and labour not in vain that you ar the most
fortun of men and should be the most happi
he look at me somewhat strang and answeredy of cours
she is love is she notbut and hi voic drop to it lowest
whisper i wish horac that ayesha were a littl more human even as
human as she wa in the cave of kor i dont think she is quit flesh
and blood i felt it when she kiss meif you can call it a kissfor
she bare touch my hair inde how can she be who chang thu in an
hour flesh and blood ar not born of flame horac
ar you sure that she wa so born i ask like the vision on the
fire mai not that hideou shape have been but an illus of our mind
mai she not be still the same ayesha whom we knew in kor not reborn
but waft hither by some mysteri agenc
perhap horac we do not knowi think that we shall never know
but i admit that to me the thing is terrifi i am drawn to her by
an infinit attract her ey set my blood on fire the touch of her
hand is as that of a wand of mad laid upon my brain and yet between
us there is some wall invis still present or perhap it is onli
fanci but horac i think that she is afraid of aten why in the
old dai the khania would have been dead and forgotten in an houryou
rememb ustan
perhap she mai have grown more gentl leo who like ourselv ha
learn hard lesson
ye he answer i hope that is so at ani rate she ha grown more
divineonli horac what kind of a husband shall i be for that bright
be if ever i get so far
why should you not get so far i ask angrili for hi word jar
upon my tens nerv
i dont know he answer but on gener principl do you think
that such fortun will be allow to a man also what did aten mean
when she said that man and spirit cannot mateandoth thing
she meant that she hope thei could not i imagin and leo it is
useless to troubl yourself with forebod that ar more fit to my
year than your and probabl ar base on noth be a philosoph
leo you have striven by wonder wai such as ar unknown in the
histori of the world you have attain take the good the god provid
youth glori the love and the powerand let the futur look to
itself
befor he could answer oro appear from round the rock and bow
with more than hi usual humil to leo said that the hesea desir
our presenc at a servic in the sanctuari rejoic at the prospect
of see her again befor he had hope to do so leo sprang up and we
accompani him back to our apart
here priest were wait who somewhat against hi will trim hi
hair and beard and would have done the same for me had i not refus
their offic then thei place goldembroid sandal on our feet and
wrap leo in a magnific white robe also richli work with gold
and purpl a somewhat similar robe but of less ornat design be
given to me lastli a silver sceptr wa thrust into hi hand and into
mine a plain wand thi sceptr wa shape like a crook and the sight
of it gave me some clue to the natur of the forthcom ceremoni
the crook of osiri i whisper to leo
look here he answer i dont want to imperson ani egyptian god
or to be mix up in their heathen idolatri in fact i wont
better go through with it i suggest probabl it is onli someth
symbol
but leo who notwithstand the strang circumst connect with
hi life retain the religi principl in which i had educ him
veri strongli inde refus to move an inch until the natur of thi
servic wa made clear to him inde he express himself upon the
subject with vigour to oro at first the priest seem puzzl what to
do then explain that the forthcom ceremoni wa on of betroth
on learn thi leo rais no further object ask onli with some
nervous whether the khania would be present oro answer no as
she had alreadi depart to kaloon vow war and vengeanc
then we were led through long passag till final we emerg into the
galleri immedi in front of the great wooden door of the aps at
our approach these swung open and we enter it oro go first then
leo then myself and follow us the process of attend priest
as soon as our ey becam accustom to the dazzl glare of the
flame pillar we saw that some great rite wa in progress in the
templ for in front of the divin statu of motherhood whiterob
and arrang in serri rank stood the compani of the priest to
the number of over two hundr and behind these the compani of the
priestess face thi congreg and a littl in advanc of the two
pillar of fire that flare on either side of the shrine ayesha herself
wa seat in a rais chair so that she could be seen of all while to
her right stood a similar chair of which i could guess the purpos
she wa unveil and gorgeous apparel though save for the white
beneath her robe were those of a queen rather than of a priestess
about her radiant brow ran a narrow band of gold whenc rose the head
of a hood asp cut out of a singl crimson jewel beneath which in
endless profus the gloriou wave hair flow down and around
hide even the fold of her purpl cloak
thi cloak open in front reveal an undertun of white silk cut
low upon her bosom and kept in place by a golden girdl a doublehead
snake so like to that which she had worn in kor that it might have been
the same her nake arm were bare of ornament and in her right hand
she held the jewel sistrum set with it gem and bell
no empress could have look more royal and no woman wa ever half so
love for to ayesha human beauti wa ad a spiritu glori
her heritag alon see her we could see naught els the rhythmic
movement of the bodi of the worshipp the roll grandeur of their
chant of welcom echo from the mighti roof the fear torch of
live flame all these thing were lost on us for there reborn
enthron her arm stretch out in graciou welcom sat that perfect
and immort woman the appoint bride of on of us the friend and
ladi of the other her divin presenc breath power mysteri and
love
on we march between the rank of hieroph till oro and the
priest left us and we stood alon face to face with ayesha now she
lift her sceptr and the chant ceas in the midst of the follow
silenc she rose from her seat and glide down it step came to
where leo stood and touch him on the forehead with her sistrum cry
in a loud sweet voicebehold the chosen of the hesea whereon all
that audienc echo in a shout of thunderwelcom to the chosen of
the hesea
then while the echo of that glad cry yet rang round the rocki wall
ayesha motion to me to stand at her side and take leo by the hand
drew him toward her so that now he face the whiterob compani
hold him thu she began to speak in clear and silveri tone
priest and priestess of he servant with her of the mother of the
world hear me now for the first time i appear among you as i am you
who heretofor have look but on a hood shape not know it form
or fashion learn now the reason that i draw my veil ye see thi man
whom ye believ a stranger that with hi companion had wander to
our shrine i tell you that he is no stranger that of old in live
forgotten he wa my lord who now come to seek hi love again sai is
it not so kallikr

priest and priestess of he as ye know from the begin it ha
been the right and custom of her who hold my place to choos on to be
her lord is it not so

she paus a while then with a gestur of infinit sweet turn to
leo bent toward him thrice and slowli sank upon her knee
sai thou ayesha said look up at him with her wondrou ey sai
befor these here gather and all those wit whom thou canst not
see dost thou again accept me as thy affianc bride
ay ladi he answer in a deep but shaken voic now and for
ever
then while all watch in the midst of a great silenc ayesha rose
cast down her sistrum sceptr that rang upon the rocki floor and
stretch out her arm toward him
leo also bent toward her and would have kiss her upon the lip but
i who watch saw hi face grow white as it drew near to her while
the radianc crept from her brow to hi turn hi bright hair to
gold i saw also that thi strong man trembl like a reed and seem as
though he were about to fall
i think that ayesha note it too for er ever their lip met she
thrust him from her and again that grei mist of fear gather on her
face
in an instant it pass she had slip from him and with her hand held
hi hand as though to support him thu thei stood till hi feet grew
firm and hi strength return
oro restor the sceptr to her and lift it she saido love and
lord take thou the place prepar for thee where thou shalt sit for
ever at my side for with myself i give thee more than thou canst know
or than i will tell thee now mount thy throne o affianc of he and
receiv the worship of thy priest
nai he answer with a start as that word fell upon hi ear here
and now i sai it onc and for all i am but a man who know noth of
strang god their attribut and ceremoni none shall bow the knee
to me and on earth ayesha i bow mine to thee alon
now at thi bold speech some of those who heard it look astonish and
whisper to each other while a voic calledbewar thou chosen of
the anger of the mother
again for a moment ayesha look afraid then with a littl laugh swept
the thing asid sayingsur with that i should be content for me
o love thy ador for thee the betroth song no more
so have no choic leo mount the throne where notwithstand hi
splendid presenc enhanc as it wa by those glitter robe he
look ill enough at eas as inde must ani man of hi faith and
race happili howev if some act of semiidolatr homag had been
propos ayesha found a mean to prevent it celebr and soon all
such matter were forgotten both by the singer who sang and us who
listen to the majest chant that follow
of it word unfortun we were abl to understand but littl both
becaus of the volum of sound and of the secret priestli languag in
which it wa given though it gener purport could not be mistaken
the femal voic began it sing veri low and convei a strang
impress of time and distanc now follow burst of glad
altern with melancholi chord suggest sigh and tear and
sorrow long endur and at the end a joyou triumphant paean thrown
to and fro between the men and women singer termin in on
unit choru repeat again and again louder and yet louder till it
culmin in a verit crash of melodi then of a sudden ceas
ayesha rose and wave her sceptr whereon all the compani bow thrice
then turn and break into some sweet low chant that sound like a
lullabi march rank after rank across the width of the sanctuari and
through the carven door which close behind the last of them
when all had gone leav us alon save for the priest oro and the
priestess papav who remain in attend on their mistress ayesha
who sat gaze befor her with dream empti ey seem to awak
for she rose and saida nobl chant is it not and an ancient it wa
the wed song of the feast of isi and osiri at behbit in egypt and
there i heard it befor ever i saw the darksom cave of kor often have
i observ my holli that music linger longer than aught els in thi
chang world though it is rare that the veri word should remain
unvari come belovedtel me by what name shall i call thee thou

life of which i have ani knowledg thi kallikr seem to have been

than a tool in the hand of destini have bred no good to the inheritor
of hi bodyor hi spirit whichev it mai beor to those women with
whom hi life wa intertwin call me leo then for of kallikr i
have had enough sinc that night when i look upon the last of him in

chapter xviii

an hour two hour pass while we strove to rest in our sleep
place but could not for some influenc disturb us
why doe not ayesha come ask leo at length paus in hi walk up
and down the room i want to see her again i cannot bear to be apart
from her i feel as though she were draw me to her
how can i tell you ask oro he is outsid the door

the sanctuari
then i am go to look for her come oro and you too horac

ad that we to whom all the path were open could return to the
sanctuari if we thought well

we went down the long passag that were dimli light with lamp and
came to the galleri here we found no lamp still we grope our wai
to the great wooden door thei were shut but leo push upon them
impati and on of them swung open a littl so that we could
squeez ourselv between them as we pass it close noiselessli
behind us
now we should have been in the sanctuari and in the full blaze of
those aw column of live fire but thei were out or we had strai
elsewher at least the dark wa intens we tri to work our wai
back to the door again but could not we were lost
more someth oppress us we did not dare to speak we went on a few
pace and stop for we becam awar that we were not alon inde
it seem to me that we stood in the midst of a throng multitud
but not of men and women be press about us we could feel their
robe yet could not touch them we could feel their breath but it wa
cold the air stir all round us as thei pass to and fro pass
in endless number it wa as though we had enter a cathedr fill
with the vast congreg of all the dead who onc had worship
there we grew afraidmi face wa damp with fear the hair stood up
upon my head we seem to have wander into a hall of the shade
at length light appear far awai and we saw that it eman from the
two pillar of fire which had burn on either side of the shrine that
of a sudden becam lumin so we were in the sanctuari and still
near to the door now those pillar were not bright thei were low
and lurid the rai from them scarc reach us stand in the dens
shadow
but if we could not be seen in them we still could see look yonder sat
ayesha on a throne and oh she wa aw in her deathlik majesti

sat erect with such a face and mien of pride as no human creatur ever
wore power seem to flow from her ye it flow from those wideset

perhap more dread than anyth that had gone beforew went to

leo turn as i thought at first to find the door but it wa not so
for he did but walk up and down the room awhil then he came back to
where ayesha stood and spoke quit simpli and in a veri quiet voic
such as men of hi natur often assum in moment of great emot
ayesha he said when i saw thee as thou wast ag andthou knowest
howi clung to thee now when thou hast told me the secret of thi
unholi pact of thine when with my ey at least i have seen thee

it weight sink to my soul and becom a part of me and although i have
no vision or power of propheci i am sure that i shall not escap it
punish well though i be innoc let me bear it for thy sake i

ayesha heard the cloak slip from her head and for a moment she
stood silent like on amaz then burst into a passion of sudden tear
down she went befor him and cling to hi garment she bow her
state shape until her forehead touch the ground ye that proud
be who wa more than mortal whose nostril but now had drunk the
incens of the homag of ghost or spirit humbl herself at thi
man feet
with an exclam of horror halfmadden at the piteou sight leo
sprang to on side then stoop lift and led her still weep to
the couch
thou knowest not what thou hast done ayesha said at last let all
thou sawest on the mountain crest or in the sanctuari be but vision
of the night let that tale of an offend goddess be a parabl a
fabl if thou wilt thi at least is true that ag sinc i sin for
thee and against thee and anoth that ag sinc i bought beauti and
life indefinit wherewith i might win thee and endow thee at a cost
which few would dare that i have paid interest on the debt in mockeri
utter loneli and daili pain which scarc could be endur until
the bond fell due at last and must be satisfi
ye how i mai not tell thee thou and thou alon stoodst between me
and the full discharg of thi most dread debtfor know that in
merci it is given to us to redeem on anoth
now he would have spoken but with a motion of her hand she bade him be
silent and continuedse now leo three great danger ha thy
bodi pass of late upon it journei to my side the deathhound
the mountain and the precipic know that these were but type and
ordain foreshadow of the last threefold trial of thy soul from
the pursu passion of aten which must have undon us both thou hast
escap victori thou hast endur the desert loneli of the
sand and snow starv for a comfort that never came even when the
avalanch thunder round thee thy faith stood fast as it stood abov
the pit of flame while after bitter year of doubt a rush flood
of horror swallow up thy hope as thou didst descend the glacier
steep not know what lai beneath that fear path so but now and of
thine own choic for veri love of me thou hast plung headlong into
an abyss that is deeper far to share it terror with my spirit dost
thou understand at last
someth not all i think he answer slowli
sure thou art wrap in a doubl veil of blind she cri
impati listen again
hadst thou yield to natur cry and reject me but yesterdai
in that foul shape i must perchanc have linger for uncount time
plai the poor part of priestess of a forgotten faith thi wa the
first temptat the ordeal of thy fleshnai not the firstth
second for aten and her lure were the first but thou wast loyal
and in the magic of thy conquer love my beauti and my womanhood were
reborn
hadst thou reject me tonight when as i wa bidden to do i show
thee that vision in the sanctuari and confess to thee my soul black
crime then hopeless and helpless unshield by my earthli power i
must have wander on into the deep and endless night of solitud
thi wa the third appoint test the trial of thy spirit and by thy
steadfast leo thou hast loos the hand of destini from about my
throat now i am regener in theethrough thee mai hope again for
some true life beyond which thou shalt share and yet and yet if thou
shouldst suffer as well mai chanc
then i suffer and there an end broke in leo seren save for
a few thing my mind is clear and there must be justic for us all at
last if i have broken the bond that bound thee if i have freed thee
from some threaten spiritu ill by take a risk upon my head
well i have not live and if need be shall not die in vain so let us
have done with all these problem or rather first answer thou me on
ayesha how wast thou chang upon that peak
in flame i left thee leo and in flame i did return as in flame
mayhap we shall both depart or perhap the chang wa in the ey of
all of you who watch and not in thi shape of mine i have answer
seek to learn no more
on thing i do still seek to learn ayesha we were betroth tonight
when wilt thou marri me
not yet not yet she answer hurriedli her voic quiver as she
spoke leo thou must put that hope from thy thought awhil and for
some few month a year perchanc be content to plai the part of friend
and lover
why so he ask with bitter disappoint ayesha those part
have been mine for mani a dai more i grow no younger and unlik
thee shall soon be old also life is fleet and sometim i think
that i near it end
speak no such evilomen word she said spring from the couch
and stamp her sandal foot upon the ground in anger born of fear
yet thou sayest truth thou art unfortifi against the accid of
time and chanc oh horribl horribl thou mightest die again and
leav me live
then give me of thy life ayesha
that would i gladli all of it couldst thou but repai me with the boon
of death to come
oh ye poor mortal she went on with a sudden burst of passion ye
beseech your god for the gift of mani year be ignor that ye
would sow a seed within your breast whenc ye must garner ten thousand
miseri know ye not that thi world is inde the wide hous of hell
in whose chamber from time to time the spirit tarri a littl while
then weari and aghast speed wail to the peac that it ha won
think then what it is to live on here etern and yet be human to
ag in soul and see our belov die and pass to land whither we mai
not hope to follow to wait while drop by drop the curs of the long
centuri fall upon our imperish be like water slow drip on
a diamond that it cannot wear till thei be born anew forget of us
and again sink from our helpless arm into the void unknow
think what it is to see the sin we sin the tempt look the word
idl or unkinday even the selfish thought or struggl multipli
ten thousandfold and more etern than ourselv spring up upon the
univers bosom of the earth to be the bane of a million destini
whilst the everlast finger write it endless count and a cold
voic of justic cri in our consciencehaunt solitud oh soul
unshriven behold the ripen harvest thy wanton hand did scatter and
long in vain for the water of forget
think what it is to have everi earthli wisdom yet to burn unsatisfi
for the deeper and forbidden draught to gather up all wealth and power
and let them slip again like children weari of a paint toi to sweep
the harp of fame and madden by it jangl music to stamp it small
beneath our feet to snatch at pleasur goblet and find it wine is
sand and at length outworn to cast us down and prai the pitiless god
with whose stolen garment we have wrap ourselv to take it back
again and suffer us to slink nake to the grave
such is the life thou askest leo sai wilt thou have it now
if it mai be share with thee he answer these woe ar born of
loneli but then our perfect fellowship would turn them into joi
ay she said while it wa permit to endur so be it leo in
the spring when the snow melt we will journei togeth to libya and
there thou shalt be bath in the fount of life that forbidden essenc
of which onc thou didst fear to drink afterward i will wed thee
that place is close for ever ayesha
not to my feet and thine she answer fear not my love were thi
mountain heap thereon i would blast a path through it with mine ey
and lai it secret bare oh would that thou wast as i am for then
befor tomorrow sun wed watch the roll pillar thunder by and thou
shouldst tast it glori
but it mai not be hunger or cold can starv thee and water drown
sword can slai thee or sick sap awai thy strength had it not been
for the fals aten who disobei my word as it wa foredoom
that she should do by thi dai we were across the mountain or had
travel northward through the frozen desert and the river now we
must await the melt of the snow for winter is at hand and in it
as thou knowest no man can live upon their height
eight month till april befor we can start and how long to cross
the mountain and all the vast distanc beyond and the sea and the
swamp of kor why at the best ayesha two year must go by befor we
can even find the place and he fell to entreat her to let them be
wed at onc and journei afterward
but she said nai and nai and nai it should not be till at length
as though fear hi plead or that of her own heart she rose and
dismiss us
ah my holli she said to me as we three part i promis thee and
myself some few hour of rest and of the happi of quiet and thou
seest how my desir ha been fulfil those old egyptian were wont
to share their feast with on grizzli skeleton but here i count four
tonight that you both could see and thei ar name fear suspens
forebod and lovedeni doubtless also when these ar buri
other will come to haunt us and snatch the poor morsel from our lip
so hath it ever been with me whose feet misfortun dog yet i hope

tri in the appoint tripl fire and yet prove true sweet be thy
slumber o my love and sweeter still thy dream for know my soul
shall share them i vow to thee that tomorrow well be happi ay
tomorrow without fail
why will she not marri me at onc ask leo when we were alon in
our chamber becaus she is afraid i answer
chapter xix
leo and the leopard
dure the week that follow these moment dai often and often i
wonder to myself whether a more truli wretch be had ever live
than the woman or the spirit whom we knew as she he and ayesha
whether in fact also or in our imagin onli she had arisen from
the ash of her hideou ag into the full bloom of perpetu life and
beauti inconceiv
these thing at least were certain ayesha had achiev the secret of
an exist so endur that for all human purpos it might be call
unend within certain limitationssuch as her utter inabl to
forese the futureundoubtedli also she wa endu with power that
can onli be describ as supernatur
her rule over the strang commun amongst whom she live wa absolut
inde it member regard her as a goddess and as such she wa
worship after marvel adventur the man who wa her veri life
i might almost sai her soul whose be wa so mysteri intertwin
with her whom she love also with the intensest human passion of which
woman can be capabl had sought her out in thi hidden corner of the
world
more thrice he had prove hi unalter fidel to her first
by hi reject of the royal and beauti if undisciplin aten
secondli by cling to ayesha when she seem to be repuls to everi
natur sens thirdli after that homag scene in the sanctuarythough
with her unutter perfect befor hi ey thi did not appear to
be so wonderfulbi steadfast in the face of her terribl avow
true or fals that she had won her gift and him through some
dim unholi pact with the power of evil in the unknown fruit
and consequ of which he must be involv as the price of her
possess
yet ayesha wa miser even in her lightest mood it wa clear to
me that those skeleton at the feast of which she had spoken were her
continu companion inde when we were alon she would acknowledg
it in dark hint and veil allegori or allus crush though her
rival the khania aten might be also she wa still jealou of her
perhap afraid would be a better word for some instinct seem to
warn ayesha that soon or late her hour would come to aten again and
that then it would be her own turn to drink of the bitter water of
despair
what troubl her more a thousandfold howev were her fear for leo
as mai well be understood to stand in hi intim relationship to thi
half divin and marvel be and yet not to be allow so much as
to touch her lip did not conduc to hi physic or mental wellb
especi as he knew that the wall of separ must not be climb
for at least two year littl wonder that leo lost appetit grew thin
and pale and could not sleep or that he implor her continu to
rescind her decre and marri him
but on thi point ayesha wa immov instig thereto by leo and
i mai add my own curios when we were alon i question her again
as to the reason of thi selfdeni ordin all she would tell me
howev wa that between them rose the barrier of leo mortal and
that until hi physic be had been impregn with the mysteri
virtu of the vapour of life it wa not wise that she should take him
as a husband
i ask her why see that though a longliv on she wa still a
woman whereon her face assum a calm but terrifi smile and she
answeredart so sure my holli tell me do your women wear such
jewel as that set upon my brow and she point to the faint but
lambent light which glow about her forehead
more she began slowli to stroke her abund hair then her breast and
bodi wherev her finger pass the mystic light wa born until in
that darken roomfor the dusk wa gatheringsh shimmer from head
to foot like the water of a phosphoresc sea a be gloriou yet
fear to behold then she wave her hand and save for the gentl
radianc on her brow becam as she had been
art so sure my holli ayesha repeat nai shrink not that flame
will not burn thee mayhap thou didst but imagin it as i have note
thou dost imagin mani thing for sure no woman could cloth herself
in light and live nor ha so much as the smell of fire pass upon my
garment
then at length my patienc wa outworn and i grew angri
i am sure of noth ayesha i answer except that thou wilt make
us mad with all these trick and chang sai art thou a spirit then
we ar all spirit she said reflect and i perhap more than
some who can be certain
not i i answer yet i implor woman or spirit tell me on thing
tell me the truth in the begin what wast thou to leo and what wa
he to thee
she look at me veri solemnli and answereddo my memori deceiv
me holli or is it written in the first book of the law of the hebrew
which onc i us to studi that the son of heaven came down to the
daughter of men and found that thei were fair
it is so written i answer
then holli might it not have chanc that onc a daughter of heaven
came down to a man of earth and love him well might it not chanc that
for her great sin she thi high fallen star who had befoul her
immort state for him wa doom to suffer till at length hi love
made divin by pain and faith even to a memori wa permit to
redeem her
now at length i saw light and sprang up eagerli but in a cold voic she
ad
nai holli ceas to question me for there ar thing of which i can
but speak to thee in figur and in parabl not to mock and bewild
thee but becaus i must interpret them as thou wilt still aten
thought me no mortal sinc she told us that man and spirit mai not
mate and there ar matter in which i let her judgment weigh with me
as without doubt now as in other live she and that old shaman her
uncl have wisdom ay and foresight so bid my lord press me no more
to wed him for it give me pain to sai him nayah thou knowest not
how much
moreov i will declar myself to thee old friend whatev els
i be at least i am too womanli to listen to the plead of my best
belov and not myself be move see i have set a curb upon desir
and drawn it until my heart bleed but if he pursu me with continu
word and look of burn love who knoweth but that i shall kindl in
hi flame and throw the rein of reason to the wind
oh then togeth we might race adown our passion steep togeth
dare the torrent that rage at it foot and there perchanc be whelm
or torn asund nai nai anoth space of journei but a littl
space and we reach the bridg my wisdom found and cross it safe and
beyond for ever ride on at eas through the happi meadow of our love
then she wa silent nor would she speak more upon the matter alsoand
thi wa the worst of iteven now i wa not sure that she told me the
truth or at ani rate all of it for to ayesha mind truth seem
mani colour as ar the rai of light thrown from the differ face
of a cut jewel we never could be certain which shade of it she wa
pleas to present who whether by prefer or of necess as
she herself had said spoke of such secret in figur of speech and
parabl
it is a fact that to thi hour i do not know whether ayesha is spirit
or woman or as i suspect a blend of both i do not know the limit of
her power or if that elabor stori of the begin of her love for
leo wa truewhich person i doubtor but a fabl invent by her
mind and through it as she had hint pictur on the flame for her
own hidden purpos
i do not know whether when first we saw her on the mountain she wa
realli old and hideou or did but put on that shape in our ey in
order to test her lover i do not know whether as the priest oro bore
witnesswhich he mai well have been bidden to doher spirit pass
into the bodi of the dead priestess of he or whether when she
seem to perish there so miser her bodi and her soul were waft
straightwai from the cave of kor to thi central asian peak
i do not know why as she wa so power she did not come to seek us
instead of leav us to seek her through so mani weari year though i
suggest that some superior forc forbad her to do more than companion
us unseen watch our everi act read our everi thought until at
length we reach the predestin place and hour also as will appear
there were other thing of which thi is not the time to speak wherebi
i am still more tortur and perplex
in short i know noth except that my exist ha been intertangl
with on of the great mysteri of the world that the gloriou be
call ayesha won the secret of life from whatev power hold it in it
keep that she allegedalthough of thi rememb we have no actual
proofsuch life wa to be attain by bath in a certain eman
vapour or essenc that she wa possess by a passion not easi to
understand but terrif in it forc and immort in it natur
concentr upon on other be and on alon that through thi
passion also some angri fate smote her again again and yet again
make of her countless dai a burden and lead the power and the
wisdom which knew all but could foreknow noth into abyss of
anguish suspens and disappoint such asheaven be thankedw
common men and women ar not call upon to plumb
for the rest should human ey ever fall upon it each reader must
form hi own opinion of thi histori it true interpret and
signific these and the exact part plai by aten and myself in
it develop i hope to solv shortli though not here
well as i have said the upshot of it all wa that ayesha wa devour
with anxieti about leo except in thi matter of marriag hi everi
wish wa satisfi and inde forestal thu he wa never again
ask to share in ani of the ceremoni of the sanctuari though
inde strip of it rite and spiritu symbol the religion of
the colleg of he prove pure and harmless enough it wa but a dilut
version of the osiri and isi worship of old egypt from which it
had been inherit mix with the central asian belief in the
transmigr or reincarn of soul and the possibl of draw
near to the ultim godhead by holi of thought and life
in fact the head priestess and oracl wa onli worship as a
repres of the divin while the tempor aim of the colleg
in practic were confin to good work although it is true that thei
still sigh for their lost author over the countri of kaloon thu
thei had hospit and dure the long and sever winter when
the tribe of the mountain slope were often driven to the verg of
starvat gave liber to the destitut from their store of food
leo like to be with ayesha continu so we spent each even in her
compani and much of the dai also until she found that thi inact
told upon him who for year had been accustom to endur everi rigour
of climat in the open air after thi came home to heralthough she
wa alwai haunt by terror lest ani accid should befal himayesha
insist upon hi go out to kill the wild sheep and the ibex which
live in number on the mountain ridg place him in the charg of
the chief and huntsmen of the tribe with whom thu he becam well
acquaint in thi exercis howev i accompani him but rare as
if us too much my arm still gave me pain
onc inde such an accid did happen i wa seat in the garden
with ayesha and watch her her head rest on her hand and she wa
look with her wide ey across which the swift thought pass
like cloud over a windi sky or dream through the mind of a
sleeperlook out vacantli toward the mountain snow seen thu her
loveli wa inexpress amaz mere to gaze upon it wa an
intox contempl it i understood inde that like to that
of the fabl helen thi gift of her aloneand it wa but on of
manymust have caus infinit sorrow had she ever been permit to
displai it to the world it would have driven human to mad the
men with long and the women with jealousi and hate
and yet in what did her surpass beauti lie ayesha face and form
were perfect it is true but so ar those of some other women not in
these then did it live alon but rather i think especi while what
i mai call her human mood were on her in the soft mysteri that dwelt
upon her featur and gather and chang in her splendid ey some
such mysteri mai be seen howev faintli on the face of certain of
the masterpiec of the greek sculptor but ayesha it cloth like
an everpres atmospher suggest a glori that wa not of earth
make her divin
as i gaze at her and wonder thu of a sudden she becam terribl
agit and point to a shoulder of the mountain mile and mile
awai saidlook
i look but saw noth except a sheet of distant snow
blind fool canst thou not see that my lord is in danger of hi life
she cri nai i forgot thou hast no vision take it now from me and
look again and lai her hand from which a strang numb current
seem to flow upon my head she mutter some swift word
instantli my ey were open and not upon the distant mountain but
in the air befor me as it were i saw leo roll over and over at
grip with a great snowleopard whilst the chief and huntsmen with him
ran round and round seek an opportun to pierc the savag brute
with their spear and yet leav him unharm
ayesha rigid with terror swai to and fro at my side till present
the end came for i could see leo drive hi long knife into the bowel
of the leopard which at onc grew limp separ from him and after
a struggl or two in the bloodstain snow lai still then he rose
laugh and point to hi rent garment whilst on of the huntsmen
came forward and began to bandag some wound in hi hand and thigh
with strip of linen torn from hi underrob
the vision vanish suddenli as it had come and i felt ayesha lean
heavili upon my shoulder like ani other frighten woman and heard her
gaspthat danger also ha pass by but how mani ar there to follow
oh torment heart how long canst thou endur
then her wrath flame up against the chief and hi huntsmen and
she summon messeng and sent them out at speed with a litter and
ointment bid them to bear back the lord leo and to bring hi
companion to her veri presenc
thou seest what dai ar mine my holli ay and have been these mani
year she said but those hound shall pai me for thi agoni
nor would she suffer me to reason with her
four hour later leo return limp after the litter in which
instead of himself for whom it wa sent lai a mountain sheep and the
skin of the snowleopard that he had place there to save the huntsmen
the labour of carri them ayesha wa wait for him in the hall of
her dwell and glide to himi cannot sai she walkedoverwhelm
him with mingl solicitud and reproach he listen awhil then
askedhow dost thou know anyth of thi matter the leopard skin ha
not yet been brought to thee
i know becaus i saw she answer the worst hurt wa abov thy
knee hast thou dress it with the salv i sent
not i he said but thou hast not left thi sanctuari how didst thou
see by thy magic
if thou wilt at least i saw and holli also saw thee roll in the
snow with that fierc brute while those cur ran round like scare
children
i am weari of thi magic interrupt leo crossli cannot a man be
left alon for an hour even with a leopard of the mountain as for those
brave men
at thi moment oro enter and whisper someth bow low
as for those brave men i will deal with them said ayesha with
bitter emphasi and cover herselffor she never appear unveil
to the peopl of the mountainsh swept from the place
where ha she gone horac ask leo to on of her servic in the
sanctuari
i dont know i answer but if so i think it will be that chief
burial servic
will it he exclaim and instantli limp after her
a minut or two later i thought it wise to follow in the sanctuari a
curiou scene wa in progress ayesha wa seat in front of the statu
befor her veri much frighten knelt a brawni redhair chieftain
and five of hi follow who still carri their hunt spear while
with fold arm and an exceedingli grim look upon hi face leo who
as i learn afterward had alreadi interf and been silenc stood
upon on side listen to what pass at a littl distanc behind were
a dozen or more of the templ guard men arm with sword and pick
for their strength and statur
ayesha in her sweetest voic wa question the men as to how the
leopard of which the skin lai befor her had come to attack leo the
chief answer that thei had track the brute to it lair between two
rock that on of them had gone in and wound it whereon it sprang
upon him and struck him down that then the lord leo had engag it
while the man escap and wa also struck down after which roll
with it on the ground he stab and slew the anim that wa all
no not all said ayesha for you forget coward that you ar
that keep yourselv in safeti you left my lord to the furi of thi
beast good drive them out on to the mountain there to perish also at
the fang of beast and make it known that he who give them food or
shelter di
offer no prayer for piti or excus the chief and hi follow rose
bow and turn to go
stai a moment comrad said leo and chief give me your arm
my scratch grow stiff i cannot walk fast we will finish thi hunt
togeth
what doest thou art mad ask ayesha
i know not whether i am mad he answer but i know that thou
art wick and unjust look now than these hunter none braver ever
breath that manand he point to the on whom the leopard had
struck downtook my place and went in befor me becaus i order that
we should attack the creatur and thu wa fell as thou seest all
thou mightest have seen thi also then it sprang on me and the rest of
these my friend ran round wait a chanc to strike which at first
thei could not do unless thei would have kill me with it sinc i
and the brute roll over and over in the snow as it wa on of them
seiz it with hi bare hand look at the teeth mark on hi arm so if
thei ar to perish on the mountain i who am the man to blame perish
with them
now while the hunter look at him with fervent gratitud in their
ey ayesha thought a littl then said cleverli enoughin truth
my lord leo had i known all the tale well mightest thou have name
me wick and unjust but i knew onli what i saw and out of their own
mouth did i condemn them my servant my lord here ha plead for
you and you ar forgiven more he who rush in upon the leopard and
he who seiz it with hi hand shall be reward and advanc go but
i warn you if you suffer my lord to come into more danger you shall not
escap so easili again
so thei bow and went still bless leo with their ey sinc
death by exposur on the mountain snow wa the most terribl form of
punish known to these peopl and on onli inflict by the direct
order of he upon murder or other great crimin
when we had left the sanctuari and were alon again in the hall the
storm that i had seen gather upon leo face broke in earnest ayesha
renew her inquiri about hi wound and wish to call oro the
physician to dress them and as he refus thi offer to do so
herself he beg that she would leav hi wound alon and then hi
great beard bristl with wrath ask her solmenli if he wa a child
in arm a queri so absurd that i could not help laugh
then he scold hery he scold ayesha wish to know what she
meant 1 by spy upon him with her magic an evil gift that he had
alwai dislik and mistrust 2 by condemn brave and excel
men hi good friend to a death of fiendish cruelti upon such
evid or rather out of temper on no evid at all and 3 by
give him into charg of them as though he were a littl boi and
tell them that thei would have to answer for it if he were hurt he
who in hi time had kill everi sort of big game known and pass
through some peril and encount
thu he beat her with hi word and wonder to sai ayesha thi
be more than woman submit to the chastis meekli yet had ani
other man dare to address her with rough even i doubt not that hi
speech and hi life would have come to a swift and simultan end
for i knew that now as of old she could slai by the mere effort of
her will but she did not slai she did not even threaten onli as ani
other love woman might have done she began to cry ye great tear
gather in those love ey of her and roll on by on down her
face fellfor her head wa bent humbl forwardlik heavi raindrop
on the marbl floor
at the sight of thi touch evid of her human love heart all
leo anger melt now it wa he who grew penit and prai
her pardon humbl she gave him her hand in token of forgiv
sayinglet other speak to me as thei will sorri should i have been
to try it but from thee leo i cannot bear harsh word oh thou art
cruel cruel in what have i offend can i help it if my spirit keep
it watch upon thee as inde though thou knewest it not it ha done
ever sinc we part yonder in the place of life can i help it if like
some mother who see her littl child at plai upon a mountain edg my
soul is torn with agoni when i know thee in danger that i am powerless
to prevent or share what ar the live of a few halfwild huntsmen that
i should let them weigh for a singl breath against thy safeti see
that if i slew these other would be more care of thee wherea if i
slai them not thei or their fellow mai even lead thee into peril that
would bring aboutthi death and she gasp with horror at the word
listen belov said leo the life of the humblest of those men is
of as much valu to him as mine is to me and thou hast no more right to
kill him than thou hast to kill me it is evil that becaus thou carest
for me thou shouldst suffer thy love to draw thee into cruelti and
crime if thou art afraid for me then cloth me with that immort
of thine which although i dread it somewhat hold it a thing
unholi and on thi earth not permit by my faith i should still
rejoic to inherit for thy dear sake know that then we could never
more be part or if as thou sayest thi as yet thou canst not do
then let us be wed and take what fortun give us all men must die
but at least befor i die i shall have been happi with thee for a
whiley if onli for a singl hour
would that i dare ayesha answer with a littl piteou motion of
her hand oh urg me no more leo lest that at last i should take the
risk and lead thee down a dread road leo hast thou never heard of
the love which slai or of the poison that mai lurk in a cup of joi too
perfect
then as though she fear herself ayesha turn from him and fled
thu thi matter end in itself it wa not a great on for leo
hurt were mere scratch and the hunter instead of be kill
were promot to be member of hi bodyguard yet it told us mani
thing for instanc that whenev she chose to do so ayesha had
the power of perceiv all leo movement from afar and even of
commun her strength of mental vision to other although to help
him in ani predica she appear to have no power which of cours
account for the hideou and everpres might of her anxieti
think what it would be to ani on of us were we mysteri acquaint
with everi open danger everi risk of sick everi secret peril
through which our bestbelov must pass to see the rock trembl to
it fall and thei loiter beneath it to see them drink of water and
know it full of foulest poison to see them embark upon a ship and be
awar that it wa doom to sink but not to be abl to warn them or to
prevent them sure no mortal brain could endur such constant terror
sinc hour by hour the arrow of death flit unseen and unheard past the
breast of each of us till at length on find it home there
what then must ayesha have suffer watch with her spirit ey all
the hairbreadth escap of our journei when for instanc in the
begin she saw leo at my hous in cumberland about to kill himself
in hi mad and despair and by some mighti effort of her superhuman
will wrung from whatev power it wa that held her in it fear
thraldom the strength to hurl her soul across the world and therebi in
hi sleep reveal to him the secret of the hidingplac where he would
find her
or to take on more exampl out of manywhen she saw him hang by
that slender thread of yak hide from the face of the waterfal of ic
and herself remain unabl to save him or even to look forward for
a singl moment and learn whether or no he wa about to meet a hideou
death in which event she must live on alon until in some dim ag he
wa born again
nor can her sorrow have end with these more materi fear sinc
other as pierc must have haunt her imagin for instanc the
agoni of her jealou heart when she knew her lover to be expos to
the temptat incid to hi solitari exist and more especi
to those of her ancient rival aten who by ayesha own account had
onc been hi wife imagin also her fear lest time and human chang
should do their natur work on him so that by degre the memori of
her wisdom and her strength and the imag of her loveli fade from
hi thought and with them hi desir for her compani thu leav her
who had endur so long forgotten and alon at last
truli the power that limit our percept did so in purest merci
for were it otherwis with us our race would go mad and perish rave
in it terror
thu it would seem that ayesha great torment soul think to win
life and love etern and most gloriou wa in truth but anoth blind
pandora from her stolen casket of beauti and superhuman power had
leapt into her bosom there to dwell unceasingli a hundr tortur
demon of whose wing mere mortal kind do but feel the faroff ici
shadow
ye and that the parallel might be complet hope alon still linger
in that rifl chest
chapter xx
ayesha alchemi
it wa shortli after thi incid of the snowleopard that on of these
demon familiar of ayesha her infinit ambit made it formid
appear when we had dine with her in the even ayesha habit
wa to discuss plan for our mighti and unend futur that aw
inherit which she had promis to us
here i must explain if i have not done so alreadi that she had
gracious inform me that notwithstand my refus in past year
of such a priceless opportun i also wa to be allow to bath my
superannu self in the vital fire though in what guis i should
emerg from them like herodotu when he treat of the mysteri of old
egypt if she knew she did not think it law to reveal
secretli i hope that my outward man might chang for the better as the
prospect of be fix for ever in the shape of my present and somewhat
unpleas person did not appeal to me as attract in truth so
far as i wa concern the matter had an academ rather than an actual
interest such as we take in a fairi tale sinc i did not believ that
i should ever put on thi kind of immort nor i mai add now as
befor wa i at all certain that i wish to do so
these plan of ayesha were far reach and inde terrif
her acquaint with the modern world it polit and social
develop wa still strictli limit for if she had the power to
follow it growth and activ certainli it wa on of which she made
no us
in practic her knowledg seem to be confin to what she had gather
dure the few brief talk which took place between us upon thi subject
in past time at kor now her thirst for inform prove insati
although it is true that our wa scarc up to date see that ever
sinc we lost touch with the civil peopl name for the last
fifteen year or so we had been as much buri as she wa herself
still we were abl to describ to her the condit of the nation and
their affair as thei were at the period when we bade them farewel
and more or less incorrectli to draw map of the variou countri and
their boundari over which she ponder long
the chines were the peopl in whom she prove to be most interest
perhap becaus she wa acquaint with the mongolian type and like
ourselv understood a good mani of their dialect also she had a
motiv for her studi which on night she reveal to us in the most
matteroffact fashion
those who have read the first part of her histori which i left in
england to be publish mai rememb that when we found her at kor
she horrifi us by express a determin to possess herself of
great britain for the simpl reason that we belong to that countri
now howev like her power her idea had grown for she purpos to
make leo the absolut monarch of the world in vain did he assur her
most earnestli that he desir no such empir she mere laugh at him
and saidif i aris amidst the peopl i must rule the peopl for
how can ayesha take a second place among mortal men and thou my leo
rulest me ye mark the truth thou art my master therefor it is
plain that thou wilt be the master of thi earth ay and perchanc of
other which do not yet appear for of these also i know someth and
i think can reach them if i will though hitherto i have had no mind
that wai my true life ha not yet begun it littl space within thi
world ha been fill with thought and care for thee in wait till
thou wast born again and dure these last year of separ until
thou didst return
but now a few more month and the dai of prepar past endow
with energi etern with all the wisdom of the ag and with a
strength that can bend the mountain or turn the ocean from it bed
and we begin to be oh how i sicken for that hour when first like twin
star new to the firmament of heaven we break in our immort splendour
upon the astonish sight of men it will pleas me i tell thee
leo it will pleas me to see power princip and dominion
marshal by their king and governor bow themselv befor our
throne and humbl crave the liberti to do our will at least she
ad it will pleas me for a littl time until we seek higher
thing
so she spoke while the radianc upon her brow increas and spread
itself gleam abov her like a golden fan and her slumbrou ey
took fire from it till to my thought thei becam glow mirror in
which i saw pomp enthron and suppliant peopl pass
and how ask leo with someth like a groanfor thi vision of
univers rule view from afar did not seem to charm himhow ayesha
wilt thou bring these thing about
how my leo why easili enough for mani night i have listen to
the wise discours of our holli here at least he think them wise who
still ha so much to learn and pore over hi crook map compar
them with those that ar written in my memori who of late have had
no time for the studi of such littl matter also i have weigh and
ponder your report of the race of thi world their variou folli
their futil struggl for wealth and small supremaci and i have
determin that it would be wise and kind to weld them to on whole
set ourselv at the head of them to direct their destini and
caus war sick and poverti to ceas so that these creatur of
a littl dai ephemerida wa the word she us mai live happi from the
cradl to the grave
now were it not becaus of thy strang shrink from bloodsh
howev polit and needfulfor my leo as yet thou art no true
philosopherthi were quickli done sinc i can command a weapon which
would crush their armouri and whelm their navi in the deep ye i
whom even the lightn and natur element power must obei but
thou shrinkest from the sight of death and thou believest that heaven
would be displeas becaus i make myselfor am chosenth instrument
of heaven well so let it be for thy will is mine and therefor we
will tread a gentler path
and how wilt thou persuad the king of the earth to place their crown
upon thy head i ask astonish
by caus their peopl to offer them to us she answer suav
oh holli holli how narrow is thy mind how strain the qualiti of
thine imagin set it poor gate ajar i prai and bethink thee
when we appear among men scatter gold to satisfi their want clad
in terrifi power in dazzl beauti and in immort of dai will
thei not cry be ye our monarch and rule over us
perhap i answer dubious but where wilt thou appear
she took a map of the eastern hemispher which i had drawn and place
her finger upon pekin saidther is the place that shall be our home
for some few centuri sai three or five or seven should it take so
long to shape thi peopl to my like and our purpos i have
chosen these chines becaus thou tellest me that their number ar
uncount that thei ar brave subtl and patient and though now
powerless becaus illrul and untaught abl with their multitud to
flood the littl western nation therefor among them we will begin our
reign and for some few ag be at rest while thei learn wisdom from us
and thou my holli makest their armi unconquer and givest their
land good govern wealth peac and a new religion
what the new religion wa to be i did not ask it seem unnecessari
sinc i wa convinc that in practic it would prove a form of
ayeshaworship inde my mind wa so occupi with conjectur some
of them quaint and absurd enough as to what would happen at the first
appear of ayesha in china that i forgot thi subsidiari develop
of our futur rule
and if the littl western nation will not wait to be flood
suggest leo with irrit for her contemptu tone anger him
on of a promin western nation if thei combin for instanc and
attack thee first
ah she said with a flash of her ey i have thought of it and for
my part hope that it will chanc sinc then thou canst not blame me if
i put out my strength oh then the east that ha slept so long shall
awakeshal awak and upon battlefield after battlefield such as
histori cannot tell of thou shalt see my flame standard sweep on to
victori on by on thou shalt watch the nation fall and perish until
at length i build thy throne upon the hecatomb of their countless dead
and crown thee emperor of a world regener in blood and fire
leo whom thi new gospel of regener seem to appal who wa
in fact a hater of absolut monarchi and somewhat republican in hi
view and sympathi continu the argument but i took no further
heed the thing wa grotesqu in it tremend and fantast absurd
ayesha ambit were such as no imperialmind madman could
conceiv
yether came the rubi had not the slightest doubt but that she wa
well abl to put them into practic and carri them to some marvel
and aw conclus why not death could not touch her she had
triumph over death her beautythat cup of mad in her ey as
she name it onc to meand her reckless will would compel the host of
men to follow her her pierc intellig would enabl her to invent
new weapon with which the most highlytrain armi could not possibl
compet inde it might be as she said and as i for on believ
with good reason it prove that she held at her command the element
forc of natur such as those that lie hid in electr which would
give all live be to her for a prei
ayesha wa still woman enough to have worldli ambit and the most
dread circumst about her superhuman power wa that thei appear to
be unrestrain by ani respons to god or man she wa as we might
well imagin a fallen angel to be if inde as she herself onc hint
and as aten and the old shaman believ thi were not her true place
in creation by onli two thing that i wa abl to discov could she be
movedh love for leo and in a veri small degre her friendship for
myself
yet her devour passion for thi on man inexplic in it
endur and intens would i felt sure even then in the futur as
in the past prove to be her heel of achil when ayesha wa dip in
the water of dominion and deathless thi human love left her heart
mortal that through it she might be render harmless as a child who
otherwis would have devast the univers
i wa right
whilst i wa still indulg myself in these reflect and hope
that ayesha would not take the troubl to read them in my mind i becam
awar that oro wa bow to the earth befor her
thy busi priest she ask sharpli for when she wa with leo
ayesha did not like to be disturb
he the spi ar return
why didst thou send them out she ask indiffer what need have
i of thy spi
he thou didst command me
well their report
he it is most grave the peopl of kaloon ar desper becaus of
the drought which ha caus their crop to fail so that starvat
stare them in the ey and thi thei lai to the charg of the
stranger who came into their land and fled to thee the khania aten
also is mad with rage against thee and our holi colleg labour night
and dai she ha gather two great armi on of forti and on of
twenti thousand men and the latter of these she send against the
mountain under the command of her uncl simbri the shaman in case it
should be defeat she purpos to remain with the second and greater
armi on the plain about kaloon
tide inde said ayesha with a scorn laugh ha her hate
made thi woman mad that she dare thu to match herself against me my
holli it cross thy mind but now that it wa i who am mad boast
of what i have no power to perform well within six dai thou shalt
learnoh verili thou shalt learn and though the issu be so veri
small in such a fashion that thou wilt doubt no more for ever stai
i will look though the effort of it weari me for those spi mai be
but victim to their own fear or to the falsehood of aten
then suddenli as wa common with her when thu ayesha threw her sight
afar which either from indol or becaus as she said it exhaust
her she did but rare her love face grew rigid like that of a
person in a tranc the light fade from her brow and the great pupil
of her ey contract themselv and lost their colour
in a littl while five minut perhap she sigh like on awaken
from a deep sleep pass her hand across her forehead and wa as she
had been though somewhat languid as though strength had left her
it is true enough she said and soon i must be stir lest mani
of my peopl should be kill my lord wouldst thou see war nai
thou shalt bide here in safeti whilst i go forwardto visit aten as i
promis
where thou goest i go said leo angrili hi face flush to the
root of hi hair with shame
i prai thee not i prai thee not she answer yet without ventur
to forbid him we will talk of it hereaft oro awai send round the
fire of he to everi chief three night henc at the moonris bid
the tribe gathernai not all twenti thousand of their best will be
enough the rest shall stai to guard the mountain and thi sanctuari
let them bring food with them for fifteen dai i join them at the
follow dawn go
he bow and went whereon dismiss the matter from her mind ayesha
began to question me again about the chines and their custom
it wa in cours of a somewhat similar convers on the follow
night of which howev i forget the exact detail that a remark of
leo led to anoth exhibit of ayesha marvel power
leowho had been consid her plan for conquest and again
combat them as best he could for thei were entir repugn to hi
religi social and polit viewssaid suddenli that after all thei
must break down sinc thei would involv the expenditur of sum of
monei so vast that even ayesha herself would be unabl to provid
them by ani known method of taxat she look at him and laugh a
littl
verili leo she said to thee ye and to holli here i must seem as
some madcap girl blown to and fro by everi wind of fanci and build
me a palac wherein to dwell out of dew and vapour or from the
substanc of the sunset fire thinkest thou then that i would enter on
thi waron woman against all the worldand as she spoke her shape
grew royal and in her aw ey there came a look that chill my
bloodand make no prepar for it necess why sinc last we
spoke upon thi matter forese all i have consid in my mind
and now thou shalt learn how without cost to those we ruleand for
that reason alon shall thei love us dearlyi will glut the treasuri
of the empress of the earth
dost rememb leo how in kor i found but a singl pleasur dure all
those weari agesthat of forc my mother natur on by on to yield
me up her choicest secret i who am a student of all thing which ar
and of the forc that caus them to be born now follow me both of
you and ye shall look on what mortal ey have not yet beheld
what ar we to see i ask doubtfulli have a live recollect
of ayesha power as a chemist
that thou shalt learn or shalt not learn if it pleas thee to stai
behind come leo my love my love and leav thi wise philosoph
first to find hi riddl and next to guess it
then turn her back to me she smile on him so sweetli that although
realli he wa more loth to go than i leo would have follow her
through a furnac door as inde had he but known it he wa about to
do
so thei start and i accompani them sinc with ayesha it wa
useless to indulg in ani foolish pride or to make oneself a victim to
consist also i wa anxiou to see her new marvel and did not care
to reli for an account of it upon leo descript skill which at it
best wa never more than moder
she took us down passag that we had not pass befor to a door which
she sign to leo to open he obei and from the cave within issu a
flood of light as we guess at onc the place wa her laboratori
for about it stood metal flask and variou strangeshap instrument
moreov there wa a furnac in it on of the best conceiv for it
need neither fuel nor stoke whose gaseou fire like those of the
twist column in the sanctuari sprang from the womb of the volcano
beneath our feet
when we enter two priest were at work there on of them stir a
cauldron with an iron rod and the other receiv it molten content
into a mould of clai thei stop to salut ayesha but she bade them
to continu their task ask them if all went well
veri well o he thei answer and we pass through that cave and
sundri door and passag to a littl chamber cut in the rock there
wa no lamp or flame of fire in it and yet the place wa fill with a
gentl light which seem to flow from the oppos wall
what were those priest do i said more to break the silenc than
for ani other reason
why wast breath upon foolish question she repli ar no metal
smelt in thy countri o holli now hadst thou sought to know what i am
doingbut that without see thou wouldst not believ so doubter
thou shalt see
then she point to and bade us don two strang garment that hung upon
the wall made of a materi which seem to be half cloth and half wood
and have headpiec not unlik a diver helmet
so under her direct leo help me into mine lace it up behind
after which or so i gather from the soundsfor no light came through
the helmetsh did the same servic for him
i seem veri much in the dark i said present for now there wa
silenc again and beneath thi extinguish i felt alarm and wish
to be sure that i wa not left alon
ay holli i heard ayesha mock voic make answer in the dark
as thou wast ever the thick dark of ignor and unbelief well now
as ever also i will give thee light as she spoke i heard someth
roll back i suppos that it must have been a stone door
then inde there wa light ye even through the thick of that
prepar garment such light as seem to blind me by it i saw that the
wall opposit to us had open and that we were all three of us on the
threshold of anoth chamber at the end of it stood someth like
a littl altar of hard black stone and on thi altar lai a mass of
substanc of the size of a child head but fashion i suppos from
fantasi to the oblong shape of a human ey
out of thi ey there pour that blister and intoler light it
wa shut round by thick funnelshap screen of a materi that look
like firebrick yet it pierc them as though thei were but muslin
more the rai thu direct upward struck full upon a lump of metal
held in place abov them by a massiv framework
and what rai thei were if all the cut diamond of the world were
brought togeth and set beneath a mighti burningglass the light
flash from them would not have been a thousandth part so brilliant
thei scorch my ey and caus the skin of my face and limb to smart
yet ayesha stood there unshield from them ay she even went down the
length of the room and throw back her veil bent over them as it
seem a woman of molten steel in whose bodi the bone were visibl and
examin the mass that wa support by the hang cradl
it is readi and somewhat sooner than i thought she said then as
though it were but a feather weight she lift the lump in her
bare hand and glide back with it to where we stood laugh and
sayingtel me now o thou wellread holli if thou hast ever heard of
a better alchemist than thi poor priestess of a forgotten faith and
she thrust the glow substanc up almost to the mask that hid my face
then i turn and ran or rather waddl for in that gear i could not
run out of the chamber until the rock wall beyond stai me and there
with my back toward her thrust my helmet head against it for i felt
as though redhot bradawl had been plung into my ey so i stood
while she laugh and mock behind me until at length i heard the door
close and the bless dark came like a gift from heaven
then ayesha began to loos leo from hi rayproof armour if so it can
be call and he in turn loos me and there in that gentl radianc
we stood blink at each other like owl in the sunlight while the
tear stream down our face
well art satisfi my holli she ask
satisfi with what i answer angrili for the smart of my
ey wa unbear ye with burn and bedevil i am well
satisfi
and i also grumbl leo who wa swear softli but continu to
himself in the other corner of the place
but ayesha onli laugh oh she laugh until she seem the goddess
of all merriment come to earth laugh till she also wept then
saidwhi what ingratitud is thi thou my leo didst wish to see
the wonder that i work and thou o holli didst come unbidden after i
bade thee stai behind and now both of you ar rude and angri ay and
weep like a child with a burnt finger here take thi and she gave
us some salv that stood upon a shelf and rub it on your ey and the
smart will pass awai
so we did and the pain went from them though for hour afterward
mine remain red as blood
and what ar these wonder i ask her present if thou meanest
that unbear flame
nai i mean what is born of the flame as in thine ignor thou dost
call that mighti agent look now and she point to the metal lump
she had brought with her which still gleam faintli lai upon the
floor nai it ha no heat thinkest thou that i would wish to burn my
tender hand and so make them unsightli touch it holli
but i would not who thought to myself that ayesha might be well
accustom to the hottest fire and fear her impish mischief i
look howev long and earnestli
well what is it holli
gold i said then correct myself and ad copper for the dull
red glow might have been that of either metal
nai nai she answer it is gold pure gold
the or in thi place must be rich said leo incredul for i
would not speak ani more
ye my leo the iron or is rich
iron or and he look at her
sure she answer for from what mine do men dig out gold in such
great mass iron or belov that by my alchemi i chang to gold
which soon shall serv us in our need
now leo stare and i groan for i did not believ that it wa gold
and still less that she could make that metal then read my thought
with on of those sudden chang of mood that were common to her ayesha
grew veri angri
by natur self she cri wert thou not my friend holli the fool
whom it pleas me to cherish i would bind that right hand of thine
in those secret rai till the veri bone within it were turn to gold
nai why should i be vex with thee who art both blind and deaf
yet thou shalt be persuad and leav us she pass down the
passag call someth to the priest who were labour in the
workshop then return to us
present thei follow her carri on a kind of stretcher between
them an ingot of iron or that seem to be as much as thei could lift
now she said how wilt thou that i mark thi mass which as thou must
admit is onli iron with the sign of life good and at her bid the
priest took coldchisel and hammer and roughli cut upon it surfac
the symbol of the loop crossth crux ansata
it is not enough she said when thei had finish holli lend me
that knife of thine tomorrow i will return it to thee and of more
valu
so i drew my hunt knife an indianmad thing that had a handl of
plate iron and gave it her
thou knowest the mark on it and she point to variou dent and to
the maker name upon the blade for though the hilt wa indian work the
steel wa of sheffield manufactur
i nod then she bade the priest put on the rayproof armour that
we had discard and told us to go without the chamber and lie in the
dark of the passag with our face against the floor
thi we did and remain so until a few minut later she call us
again we rose and return into the chamber to find the priest who
had remov the protect garment gasp and rub the salv upon
their ey to find also that the lump of iron or and my knife were
gone next she command them to place the block of goldcolour metal
upon their stretcher and to bring it with them thei obei and we
note that although those priest were both of them strong men thei
groan beneath it weight
how came it said leo that thou a woman couldst carri what these
men find so heavi
it is on of the properti of that forc which thou callest fire she
answer sweetli to make what ha been expos to it if for a littl
while onli as light as thistledown els how could i who am so
frail have born yonder block of gold
quit so i understand now answer leo
well that wa the end of it the lump of metal wa hid awai in a kind
of rock pit with an iron cover and we return to ayesha apart
so all wealth is thine as well as all power said leo present for
rememb ayesha aw threat i scarc dare to open my mouth
it seem so she answer wearili sinc centuri ago i discov
that great secret though until ye came i had put it to no us holli
here after hi common fashion believ that thi is magic but i tell
thee again that there is no magic onli knowledg which i have chanc
to win
of cours said leo look at in the right wai that is in thy wai
the thing is simpl i think he would have like to add as ly
but as the phrase would have involv explan did not yet
ayesha he went on hast thou thought that thi discoveri of thine
will wreck the world
leo she answer is there then noth that i can do which will
not wreck thi world for which thou hast such tender care who shouldst
keep all thy carefor me
i smile but rememb in time turn the smile into a frown at
leo then fear lest that also might anger her made my counten as
blank as possibl
if so she continu well let the world be wreck but what
meanest thou oh my lord leo forgiv me if i am so dull that i cannot
alwai follow thy quick thoughti who have live these mani year
alon without convers with nobler mind or even those to which mine
own is equal
it pleas thee to mock me said leo in a vex voic and that is
not too brave
now ayesha turn on him fierc and i look toward the door but
he did not shrink onli fold hi arm and stare her straight in
the face she contempl him a littl then saidaft that great
ordain reason which thou dost not know i think leo that why i love
thee so madli is that thou alon art not afraid of me not like holli
there who ever sinc i threaten to turn hi bone to goldwhich
inde i wa mind to do and she laughedtrembl at my footstep
and cower beneath my softest glanc
oh my lord how good thou art to me how patient with my mood and
woman weak and she made as though she were about to embrac
him then suddenli rememb herself with a littl start that somehow
convei more than the most tragic gestur she point to the couch
in token that he should seat himself when he had done so she drew a
footstool to hi feet and sank upon it look up into hi face with
attent ey like a child who listen for a stori
thy reason leo give me thy reason doubtless thei ar good and
oh be sure ill weigh them well
here thei ar in brief he answer the world as thou knewest in
thy and he stop
thy earlier wander there she suggest
yesthi earlier wander there ha set up gold as the standard of
it wealth on it all civil ar found make it as common as it
seem thou canst and these must fall to piec credit will fail and
like their savag forefath men must onc more take to barter to
suppli their need as thei do in kaloon todai
why not she ask it would be more simpl and bring them closer to
the time when thei were good and knew not luxuri and greed
and smash in each other head with stone ax ad leo
who now pierc each other heart with steel or those leaden missil
of which thou hast told me oh leo when the nation ar beggar and
their golden god is down when the usur and the fat merchant trembl
and turn white as chalk becaus their hoard ar but useless dross
when i have made the bankrupt exchang of the world my mock and laugh
across the ruin of it richest market why then will not true worth
come to it heritag again
what of it if i do discomfort those who think more of pelf than of
courag and of virtu those who as that hebrew prophet wrote lai
field to field and hous to hous until the wretch whom thei have
rob find no place left whereon to dwell what if i prove your sagest
chapmen fool and gorg your greedi moneychang with the gold that
thei desir until thei loath it veri sight and touch what if i uphold
the caus of the poor and the oppress against the raven lust of
mammon why will not thi world of your be happier then
i do not know answer leo all that i know is that it would be a
differ world on shape upon a new plan govern by untri law
and seek other end in so strang a place who can sai what might or
might not chanc
that we shall learn in it season leo or rather if it be against
thy wish we will not turn thi hidden page sinc thou dost desir it
that old evil the love of lucr shall still hold it masteri upon the
earth let the peopl keep their yellow king ill not crown anoth
in hi place as i wa mindedsuch as that live strength thou sawest
burn etern but now that power whereof i am the mistress which
can give health to men or even chang the charact of metal and in
truth if i so desir obedi to my word destroi a citi or rend thi
mountain from it root
but see holli is weari with much wonder and need hi rest oh
holli thou wast born a critic of thing done not a doer of them i
know thy tribe for even in my dai the colleg of alexandria echo with
their wrangl and alreadi the wind blew thick with the dust of their
forgotten bone holli i tell thee that at time those who creat and
act ar impati of such petti doubt and cavil yet fear not old
friend nor take my anger ill alreadi thy heart is gold without alloi
so what need have i to gild thy bone
i thank ayesha for her compliment and went to my bed wonder which
wa real her kind or her wrath or if both were but assum also
i wonder in what wai she had fallen foul of the critic of alexandria
perhap onc she had publish a poem or a system of philosophi and been
roughli handl by them it is quit possibl onli if ayesha had ever
written poetri i think that it would have endur like sappho
in the morn i discov that whatev els about her might be fals
ayesha wa a true chemist the veri greatest i suppos who ever
live for as i dress myself those priest whom we had seen in
the laboratori stagger into the room carri between them a heavi
burden that wa cover with a cloth and direct by oro place it
upon the floor
what is that i ask of oro
a peaceoff sent by the hesea he said with whom as i am told
you dare to quarrel yesterdai
then he withdrew the cloth and there beneath it shone that great lump
of metal which in the presenc of myself and leo had been mark with
the symbol of life that still appear upon it surfac onli now it
wa gold not iron gold so good and soft that i could write my name
upon it with a nail my knife lai with it also and of that too the
handl though not the blade had been chang from iron into gold
ayesha ask to see thi afterward and wa but illpleas with the
result of her experi she point out to me that line and blotch
of gold ran for an inch or more down the substanc of the steel which
she fear that thei might weaken or distemp wherea it had been her
purpos that the hilt onli should be alter
i prove in after dai how real were ayesha alchemi
and the knowledg which enabl her to solv the secret that
chemist have hunt for in vain and like natur self
to transmut the commonest into the most preciou of the
metal at the first town that i reach on the frontier of
india i took thi knife to a jewel a nativ who wa as
clever as he prove dishonest and ask him to test the
handl he did so with acid and by other mean and told me
that it wa of veri pure gold twentyfour carat i think
he said also he point out that thi gold becam gradual
merg into the steel of the blade in a wai which wa quit
inexplic to him and ask me to clear up the matter of
cours i could not but at hi request i left the knife in
hi shop to give him an opportun of examin it further
the next dai i wa taken ill with on of the heartattack
to which i have been liabl of late and when i becam abl
to move about again a while afterward i found that thi
jewel had gone none knew whither so had my knifel
h h
often sinc that time i have marvel how ayesha perform thi
miracl and from what substanc she gather or compound the
lightninglik materi which wa her servant in the work also
whether or no it had been impregn with the immort fire of
life that burn in the cave of kor yet to thi hour i have found
no answer to the problem for it is beyond my guess
recent discoveri would appear to suggest that thi
mysteri fire of life which whatev els it mai have
been wa evid a forc and no true fire sinc it did
not burn ow it origin to the eman from radium or
some kindr substanc although in the year 1885 mr holli
would have known noth of the properti of these
marvel rai or eman doubtless ayesha wa familiar
with them and their enorm possibl of which our
chemist and scientif men have at present but explor
the fringeeditor
i suppos that in prepar for her conquest of the inhabit of
thi globeto which inde it would have suffic unaid by ani
other powerth manufactur of gold from iron went on in the cave
unceasingli
howev thi mai be dure the few dai that we remain togeth
ayesha never so much as spoke of it again it seem to have serv her
purpos for the while or in the press of other and more urgent matter
to have been forgotten or thrust from her mind still amongst other
of which i have said noth sinc it is necessari to select i record
thi strang incid and our convers concern it at length
for the reason that it made a great impress upon me and furnish a
strike exampl of ayesha dominion over the hidden forc of natur
whereof we were soon to experi a more fear instanc
chapter xxi
the propheci of aten
on the dai follow thi strang experi of the iron that wa turn
to gold some great servic wa held in the sanctuari as we understood
to consecr the war we did not attend it but that night we at
togeth as usual ayesha wa moodi at the meal that is she vari
from sullen to laughter
know you she said that todai i wa an oracl and those fool of
the mountain sent their medicinemen to ask of the hesea how the battl
would go and which of them would be slain and which gain honour and
ii could not tell them but juggl with my word so that thei might
take them as thei would how the battl will go i know well for i
shall direct it but the futureah that i cannot read better than thou
canst my holli and that is ill inde for me the past and all the
present lie bath in light reflect from that black wallth futur
then she fell to brood and look up at length with an air of
entreati said to leowilt thou not hear my prayer and bide where thou
art for some few dai or even go ahunt do so and i will stai with
thee and send holli and oro to command the tribe in thi petti frai
i will not answer leo trembl with indign for thi plan
of her that i should be sent out to war while he bide in safeti in a
templ move him a man brave to rash who although he disapprov
of it in theori love fight for it own sake also to absolut rage
i sai ayesha that i will not he repeat moreov that if thou
leavest me here i will find my wai down the mountain alon and join the
battl
then come she answer and on thine own head be it nai not on
thine belov on mine on mine
after thi by some strang reaction she becam like a merri girl
laugh more than i have ever seen her do and tell us mani tale of
the far far past but none that were sad or tragic it wa veri strang
to sit and listen to her while she spoke of peopl on or two of them
known as name in histori and mani other who never have been heard
of that had trod thi earth and with whom she wa familiar over two
thousand year ago yet she told us anecdot of their love and hate
their strength or weak all of them touch with some ting of
humor satir or illustr the comic vaniti of human aim and
aspir
at length her talk took a deeper and more person note she spoke of
her search after truth of how ach for wisdom she had explor
the religion of her dai and refus them on by on of how she had
preach in jerusalem and been stone by the doctor of the law of
how also she had wander back to arabia and be reject by her own
peopl as a reform had travel on to egypt and at the court of the
pharaoh of that time met a famou magician half charlatan and half
seer who becaus she wa farse clairvoyant we should call it
instruct her in hi art so well that soon she becam hi master and
forc him to obei her
then as though she were unwil to reveal too much suddenli ayesha
histori pass from egypt to kor she spoke to leo of hi arriv there
a wander who wa name kallikr hunt by savag and accompani
by the egyptian amenarta whom she appear to have known and hate in
her own countri and of how she entertain them ye she even told of
a supper that the three of them had eaten togeth on the even befor
thei start to discov the place of life and of an evil propheci that
thi royal amenarta had made as to the issu of their journei
ay ayesha said it wa such a silent night as thi and such a
meal as thi we at and leo not so greatli chang save that he wa
beardless then and younger wa at my side where thou sittest holli
sat the royal amenarta a veri fair woman ye even more beauti
than i befor i dip me in the essenc foresight also though not
so learn as i had grown from the first we hate each other and more
than ever now when she guess how i had learn to look upon thee her
lover leo for her husband thou never wast who didst flee too fast for
marriag she knew also that the struggl between us which had begun of
old and afar wa for centuri and gener and that until the end
should declar itself neither of us could harm the other who both had
sin to win thee that wast appoint by fate to be the lodeston
of our soul then amenarta spoke and saidlo to my sight
kallikr the wine in thy cup is turn to blood and that knife in
thy hand o daughter of yarabfor so she name medrip red blood
ay and thi place is a sepulchr and thou o kallikr sleepest
here nor can she thy murderess kiss back the breath of life into
those cold lip of thine
so inde it came about as wa ordain ad ayesha reflect
for i slew thee in yonder place of life ye in my mad i slew thee
becaus thou wouldst not or couldst not understand the chang that had
come over me and shrankest from my loveli like a blind bat from
the splendour of flame hide thy face in the tress of her duski
hairwhi what is it now thou oro can i never be rid of thee for an
hour
o he a write from the khania aten the priest said with hi
deprec bow
break the seal and read she answer carelessli perchanc she ha
repent of her folli and make submiss
so he read
to the hesea of the colleg on the mountain known as ayesha upon
earth and in the household of the overworld whenc she ha been
permit to wander as starthathathfallen
a pretti sound name forsooth broke in ayesha ah but aten
set star rise againeven from the underworld read on thou oro
greet o ayesha thou who art veri old hast gather much wisdom
in the pass of the centuri and with other power that of make
thyself seem fair in the ey of men blind by thine art yet on
thing thou lackest that i havevis of those happen which ar not
yet know o ayesha that i and my uncl the great seer have search
the heavenli book to learn what is written there of the issu of thi
war
thi is writtenfor me death whereat i rejoic for thee a spear
cast by thine own hand for the land of kaloon blood and ruin bred of
thee
aten
khania of kaloon
ayesha listen in silenc but her lip did not trembl nor her cheek
pale to oro she said proudlysai to the messeng of aten that i
have receiv her messag and er long will answer it face to face
with her in her palac of kaloon go priest and disturb me no more
when oro had depart she turn to us and saidthat tale of mine of
long ago wa well fit to thi hour for as amenarta prophesi of
ill so doe aten prophesi of ill and amenarta and aten ar on
well let the spear fall if fall it must and i will not flinch from
it who know that i shall sure triumph at the last perhap the khania
doe but think to frighten me with a cun lie but if she ha read
aright then be sure belov that it is still well with us sinc none
can escap their destini nor can our bond of union which wa fashion
with the univers that bear us ever be undon
she paus awhil then went on with a sudden outburst of poetic thought
and imageri
i tell thee leo that out of the confus of our live and death
order shall yet be born behind the mask of cruelti shine merci
tender ey and the wrong of thi rough and twist world ar but
hot blind spark which stream from the allright sword of pure
etern justic the heavi live we see and know ar onli link in a
golden chain that shall draw us safe to the haven of our rest steep
and pain step ar thei wherebi we climb to the allot palac of
our joi henceforth i fear no more and fight no more against that which
must befal for i sai we ar but wing seed blown down the gale of
fate and chang to the appoint garden where we shall grow fill it
blest air with the immort fragranc of our bloom
leav me now leo and sleep awhil for we ride at dawn
it wa middai on the morrow when we move down the mountainsid with
the armi of the tribe fierc and savagelook men the scout were
out befor us then came the great bodi of their cavalri mount on wiri
hors while to right and left and behind the foot soldier march in
regiment each under the command of it own chief
ayesha veil nowfor she would not show her beauti to these wild
folkrod in the midst of the horsemen on a white mare of matchless
speed and shape with her went leo and myself leo on the khan black
hors and i on anoth not unlik it though thicker built about us
were a bodyguard of arm priest and a regiment of chosen soldier
among them those hunter that leo had save from ayesha wrath and who
were now attach to hi person
we were merri all of us for in the crisp air of late autumn flood
with sunlight the fear and forebod that had haunt us in those
gloomi firelit cave were forgotten moreov the tramp of thousand
of arm men and the excit of come battl thrill our nerv
not for mani a dai had i seen leo look so vigor and happi of late
he had grown somewhat thin and pale probabl from caus that i have
suggest but now hi cheek were red and hi ey shone bright again
ayesha also seem joyou for the mood of thi strang woman were as
fickl as those of natur self and vari as a landscap vari under
the sunshin or the shadow now she wa noon and now dark night now
dawn now even and now thought came and went in the blue depth of
her ey like vapour waft across the summer sky and in the press
of them her sweet face chang and shimmer as broken water shimmer
beneath the beam star
too long she said with a littl thrill laugh have i been shut
in the bowel of sombr mountain accompani onli by mute and savag
or by melancholi chant priest and now i am glad to look upon the
world again how beauti ar the snow abov and the brown slope
below and the broad plain beyond that roll awai to those border
hill how gloriou is the sun etern as myself how sweet the keen
air of heaven
believ me leo more than twenti centuri have gone by sinc i wa
seat on a steed and yet thou seest i have not forgot my horsemanship
though thi beast cannot match those arab that i rode in the wide
desert of arabia oh i rememb how at my father side i gallop
down to war against the maraud bedouin and how with my own hand i
spear their chieftain and made him cry for merci on dai i will tell
thee of that father of mine for i wa hi darl and though we have
been long apart i hold hi memori dear and look forward to our meet
see yonder is the mouth of that gorg where live the catworship
sorcer who would have murder both of you becaus thou leo didst
throw hi familiar to the fire it is strang but sever of the tribe
of thi mountain and of the land behind it make cat their god or
divin by mean of them i think that the first rassen the gener
of alexand must have brought the practic here from egypt of
thi macedonian alexand i could tell thee much for he wa almost a
contemporari of mine and when i last wa born the world still rang with
the fame of hi great deed
it wa rassen who on the mountain supplant the primev fireworship
whereof the flame pillar which light it sanctuari remain as
monument by that of he or isi or rather blend the two in on
doubtless among the priest in hi armi were some of pasht or sekket the
cathead and these brought with them their secret cult that todai
ha dwindl down to the vulgar divin of savag sorcer inde
i rememb dimli that it wa so for i wa the first hesea of thi
templ and journei hither with that same gener rassen a rel
of mine
now both leo and i look at her wonderingli and i could see that she
wa watch us through her veil as usual howev it wa i whom she
reprov sinc leo might think and do what he will and still escap
her anger
thou holli she said quickli who art ever of a cavil and
suspici mind rememb what i said but now believest that i lie
to thee
i protest that i wa onli reflect upon an appar variat
between two statement
plai not with word she answer in thy heart thou didst write me
down a liar and i take that ill know foolish man that when i said
that the macedonian alexand live befor me i meant befor thi
present life of mine in the exist that preced it though i
outlast him by thirti year we were born in the same summer and
i knew him well for i wa the oracl whom he consult most upon hi
war and to my wisdom he ow hi victori afterward we quarrel
and i left him and push forward with rassen from that dai the
bright star of alexand began to wane at thi leo made a sound that
resembl a whistl in a veri agoni of apprehens beat back the
critic and certain recollect of the strang tale of the old
abbot kouen which would rise within me i ask quicklyand dost
thou ayesha rememb well all that befel thee in thi former life
nai not well she answer medit onli the greater fact
and those i have for the most part recov by that studi of secret
thing which thou callest vision or magic for instanc my holli i
recal that thou wast live in that life inde i seem to see an
ugli philosoph clad in a dirti robe and fill both with wine and the
learn of other who disput with alexand till he grew wroth with
him and caus him to be banish or drown i forget which
i suppos that i wa not call diogen i ask tartli suspect
perhap not without caus that ayesha wa amus herself by fool
me
no she repli grave i do not think that wa thy name the
diogen thou speakest of wa a much more famou man on of real if
crab wisdom moreov he did not indulg in wine i am mind of
veri littl of that life howev not of more inde than ar mani of
the follow of the prophet buddha whose doctrin i have studi and
of whom thou holli hast spoken to me so much mayb we did not meet
while it endur still i recollect that the vallei of bone where
i found thee my leo wa the place where a great battl wa fought
between the firepriest with their vassal the tribe of the mountain
and the armi of rassen aid by the peopl of kaloon for between these
and the mountain in old dai as now there wa enmiti sinc in thi
present war histori doe but rewrit itself
so thou thyself wast our guid said leo look at her sharpli
ay leo who els though it is not wonder that thou didst not know
me beneath those deathli wrap i wa mind to wait and receiv
thee in the sanctuari yet when i learn that at length both of you had
escap aten and drew near i could restrain myself no more but came
forth thu hideous disguis ye i wa with you even at the river
bank and though you saw me not there shelter you from harm
leo i yearn to look upon thee and to be certain that thy heart had
not chang although until the allot time thou mightest not hear my
voic or see my face who wert doom to undergo that sore trial of thy
faith of holli also i desir to learn whether hi wisdom could pierc
through my disguis and how near he stood to truth it wa for thi
reason that i suffer him to see me draw the lock from the satchel on
thy breast and to hear me wail over thee yonder in the resthous
well he did not guess so ill but thou thou knewest mein thy
sleepknewest me as i am and not as i seem to be ye she ad
softli and didst sai certain sweet word which i rememb well
then beneath that shroud wa thine own face ask leo again for he
wa veri curiou on thi point the same love face i see todai
mayhapa thou wilt she answer coldli also it is the spirit that
matter not the outward seem though men in their blind think
otherwis perchanc my face is but as thy heart fashion it or as my
will present it to the sight and fanci of it behold but hark the
scout have touch
as ayesha spoke a sound of distant shout wa born upon the wind
and present we saw a fring of horsemen fall back slowli upon our
foremost line it wa onli to report howev that the skirmish of
aten were in full retreat inde a prison whom thei brought with
them on be question by the priest confess at onc that the
khania had no mind to meet us upon the holi mountain she propos to
give battl on the river farther bank have for a defenc it water
which we must ford a decis that show good militari judgment
so it happen that on thi dai there wa no fight
all that afternoon we descend the slope of the mountain more swiftli
by far than we had climb them after our long flight from the citi of
kaloon befor sunset we came to our prepar camp ground a wide and
slope plain that end at the crest of the vallei of dead bone where
in past dai we had met our mysteri guid thi howev we did not
reach through the secret mountain tunnel along which she had led us the
shortest wai by mile as ayesha told us now sinc it wa unsuit to
the passag of an armi
bend to the left we circl round a number of unclimb koppi
beneath which that tunnel pass and so at length arriv upon the brow
of the dark ravin where we could sleep safe from attack by night
here a tent wa pitch for ayesha but as it wa the onli on leo
and i with our guard bivouack among some rock at a distanc of a
few hundr yard when she found that thi must be so ayesha wa veri
angri and spoke bitter word to the chief who had charg of the food and
baggag although he poor man knew noth of tent
also she blame oro who repli meekli that he had thought us captain
accustom to war and it hardship but most of all she wa angri with
herself who had forgotten thi detail and until leo stop her with a
laugh of vexat went on to suggest that we should sleep in the tent
sinc she had no fear of the rigour of the mountain cold
the end of it wa that we sup togeth outsid or rather leo and i
sup for as there were guard around us ayesha did not even lift her
veil
that even ayesha wa disturb and ill at eas as though new fear
which she could not overcom assail her at length she seem to
conquer them by some effort of her will and announc that she wa
mind to sleep and thu refresh her soul the onli part of her i
think which ever need rest her last word to us weresleep you
also sleep sound but be not astonish my leo if i send to summon
both of you dure the night sinc in my slumber i mai find new
counsel and need to speak of them to thee er we break camp at dawn
thu we part but ah littl did we guess how and where the three of
us would meet again
we were weari and soon fell fast asleep besid our campfir for
know that the whole armi guard us we had no fear i rememb
watch the bright star which shone in the immens vault abov me
until thei pale in the pure light of the risen moon now somewhat past
her full and hear leo mutter drowsili from beneath hi fur rug that
ayesha wa quit right and that it wa pleasant to be in the open air
again as he wa tire of cave
after that i knew no more until i wa awaken by the challeng of a
sentri in the distanc then after a paus a second challeng from
the offic of our own guard anoth paus and a priest stood bow
befor us the flicker light from the fire plai upon hi shaven
head and face which i seem to recogn
iand he gave a name that wa familiar to me but which i forgetam
sent my lord by oro who command me to sai that the hesea would
speak with you both and at onc
now leo sat up yawn and ask what wa the matter i told him
whereon he said he wish that ayesha could have wait till daylight
then addedwel there is no help for it come on horac and he
rose to follow the messeng
the priest bow again and saidth command of the hesea ar that my
lord should bring their weapon and their guard
what grumbl leo to protect us for a walk of a hundr yard
through the heart of an armi
the hesea explain the man ha left her tent she is in the gorg
yonder studi the line of advanc
how do you know that i ask
i do not know it he repli oro told me so that is all and
therefor the hesea bade my lord bring their guard for she is alon
is she mad ejacul leo to wander about in such a place at
midnight well it is like her
i too thought it wa like her who did noth that other would have
done and yet i hesit then i rememb that ayesha had said she
might send for us also i wa sure that if ani trick had been intend
we should not have been warn to bring an escort so we call the
guardther were twelv of themtook our spear and sword and
start
we were challeng by both the first and second line of sentri and i
notic that as we gave them the password the last picket who of cours
recogn us look astonish still if thei had doubt thei did not
dare to express them so we went on
now we began to descend the side of the ravin by a veri steep path
with which the priest our guid seem to be curious familiar for
he went down it as though it were the stairwai of hi own hous
a strang place to take us to at night said leo doubtfulli when
we were near the bottom and the chief of the bodyguard that great
redbeard hunter who had been mix up in the matter of the
snowleopard also mutter some word of remonstr whilst i wa
try to catch what he said of a sudden someth white walk into
the patch of moonlight at the foot of the ravin and we saw that it
wa the veil figur of ayesha herself the chief saw her also and said
contentedlyh he
look at her grumbl leo stroll about in that haunt hole as
though it were hyde park and on he went at a run
the figur turn and beckon to us to follow her as she glide
forward pick her wai through the skeleton which were scatter
about upon the lava bed of the cleft thu she went on into the shadow
of the oppos cliff that the moonlight did not reach here in the wet
season a stream trickl down a path which it had cut through the rock
in the cours of centuri and the grit that it had brought with it
wa spread about the lava floor of the ravin so that mani of the bone
were almost complet buri in the sand
these i notic as we step into the shadow were more numer than
usual just here for on all side i saw the white crown of skull or
the project end of rib and thigh bone doubtless i thought to
myself that streamwai made a road to the plain abov and in some past
battl the fight around it wa veri fierc and the slaughter great
here ayesha had halt and wa engag in the contempl of thi
boulderstrewn path as though she medit make us of it that dai
now we drew near to her and the priest who guid us fell back with our
guard leav us to go forward alon sinc thei dare not approach the
hesea unbidden leo wa somewhat in advanc of me seven or eight yard
perhap and i heard him saywhi dost thou ventur into such place at
night ayesha unless inde it is not possibl for ani harm to come to
thee
she made no answer onli turn and open her arm wide then let them
fall to her side again whilst i wonder what thi signal of her might
mean from the shadow about us came a strang rustl sound
i look and lo everywher the skeleton were rise from their sandi
bed i saw their white skull their gleam arm and leg bone their
hollow rib the longslain armi had come to life again and look in
their hand were the ghost of spear
of cours i knew at onc that thi wa but anoth manifest of
ayesha magic power which some whim of her had drawn us from our
bed to wit yet i confess that i felt frighten even the boldest
of men howev free from superstit might be excus should their
nerv fail them if when stand in a churchyard at midnight suddenli
on everi side thei saw the dead aris from their grave also our
surround were wilder and more eeri than those of ani civil
buryingplac
what new devil of thine is thi cri leo in a scare and angri
voic but ayesha made no answer i heard a nois behind me and look
round the skeleton were spring upon our bodyguard who for their
part poor men paralys with terror had thrown down their weapon and
fallen some of them to their knee now the ghost began to stab at
them with their phantom spear and i saw that beneath the blow thei
roll over the veil figur abov me point with her hand at leo and
saidseiz him but i charg you harm him not
i knew the voic it wa that of aten
then too late i understood the trap into which we had fallen
treacheri i began to cry and befor the word wa out of my lip a
particularli ablebodi skeleton silenc me with a violent blow upon
the head but though i could not speak my sens still stai with
me for a littl i saw leo fight furious with a number of men who
strove to pull him down so furious inde that hi fright effort
caus the blood to gush out of hi mouth from some burst vessel in the
lung
then sight and hear fail me and think that thi wa death i
fell and rememb no more
why i wa not kill outright i do not know unless in their hurri the
disguis soldier thought me alreadi dead or perhap that my life wa
to be spare also at least beyond the knock upon the head i receiv
no injuri
chapter xxii
the loos of the power
when i came to myself again it wa daylight i saw the calm gentl
face of qro bend over me as he pour some strong fluid down my
throat that seem to shoot through all my bodi and melt a curtain in
my mind i saw also that besid him stood ayesha
speak man speak she said in a terribl voic what hast chanc

spear and look at them
well for these that thei ar dead she exclaim now holli thou
seest what is the fruit of merci the men whose live i gave my lord
have fail him at hi need
then she pass forward to the spot where leo wa captur here lai a
broken swordleosthat had been the khan rassen and two dead men
both of these were cloth in some tightfit black garment have
their head and face whiten with chalk and upon their vest a rude
imit of a human skeleton also daub in chalk
a trick fit to frighten fool with she said contemptu but oh
that aten should have dare to plai the part of ayesha that she should
have dare and she clench her littl hand see surpris and
overwhelm yet he fought well sai wa he hurt holli it come upon
meno tell me that i see amiss
not much i think i answer doubtfulli a littl blood wa run
from hi mouth no more look there go the stain of it upon that
rock
for everi drop ill take a hundr live by myself i swear it ayesha
mutter with a groan then she cri in a ring voic
back and to hors for i have deed to do thi dai nai bide thou
here holli we go a shorter path while the armi skirt the gorg oro
give him food and drink and bath that hurt upon hi head it is but a
bruis for hi hood and hair ar thick
so while oro rub some sting lotion on my scalp i at and drank
as best i could till my brain ceas to swim for the blow though
heavi had not fractur the bone when i wa readi thei brought the
hors to us and mount them slowli we scrambl up the steep bed of
the watercours
see ayesha said point to track and hoofprint on the plain at
it head there wa a chariot await him and har to it were
four swift hors aten scheme wa clever and well laid and i grown
oversur and careless slept through it all
on thi plain the armi of the tribe that had broken camp befor the
dawn wa alreadi gather fast inde the cavalri if i mai call them
so were assembl there to the number of about five thousand men each
of whom had a led hors ayesha summon the chief and captain and
address them servant of he she said the stranger lord my
betroth and guest ha been trick by a fals priest and fall
into a cun snare captur as a hostag it is necessari that i
follow him fast befor harm comesto him we move down to attack the
armi of the khania beyond the river when it passag is forc i pass
on with the horsemen for i must sleep in the citi of kaloon tonight
what sayest thou oro that a second and greater armi defend it
wall man i know it and if there is need that armi i will destroi
nai stare not at me alreadi thei ar as dead horsemen you accompani
me
captain of the tribe you follow and woe be to that man who hang
back in the hour of battl for death and etern shame shall be hi
portion but wealth and honour to those who bear them brave ye i
tell you their shall be the fair land of kaloon you have your order
for the pass of yonder river i with the horsemen take the central
ford let the wing advanc
the chief answer with a cheer for thei were fierc men whose
ancestor had love war for gener moreov mad as seem the
enterpris thei trust in their oracl the hesea and like all hill
peopl were easili fire by the promis of rich plunder
an hour steadi march down the slope brought the armi to the edg
of the marsh land these as it chanc prove no obstacl to our
progress for in that season of great drought thei were quit dry and
for the same reason the shrunken river wa not so impass a defenc
as i fear that it would be still becaus of it rocki bottom and
steep oppos bank it look formid enough while on the crest
of those bank in squadron and compani of hors and foot were
gather the regiment of aten
while the wing of footmen deploi to right and left the cavalri
halt in the marsh and let their hors fill themselv with the long
grass now a littl brown by frost that grew on thi boggi soil and
afterward drink some water
all thi time ayesha stood silent for she also had dismount that
the mare she rode and her two led hors might graze with the other
inde she spoke but onc sayingth thinkest thi adventur mad
my holli sai art afraid
not with thee for captain i answer still that second armi
shall melt befor me like mist befor the gale she repli in a low
and thrill voic holli i tell thee thou shalt see thing such as
no man upon the earth ha ever seen rememb my word when i loos the
power and thou followest the rent veil of ayesha through the smitten
squadron of kaloon onlywhat if aten should dare to murder him oh
if she should dare
be comfort i repli wonder what she might mean by thi loos
of the power i think that she love him too well
i bless thee for the word holli yeti know he will refus her and
then her hate for me and her jealou rage mai overcom her love for him
should thi be so what will avail my vengeanc eat and drink again
hollynai i touch no food until i sit in the palac of kaloonand
look well to girth and bridl for thou ridest far and on a wild errand
mount thee on leo hors which is swift and sure if it di the
guard will bring thee other
i obei her as best i could and onc more bath my head in a pool
and with the help of oro ti a rag soak in the liniment on the
bruis after which i felt sound enough inde the mad excit of
those minut of wait and some foreshadow of the terribl wonder
that were about to befal made me forget my hurt
now ayesha wa stand stare upward so that although i could not
see her veil face i guess that her ey must be fix on the sky
abov the mountain top i wa certain also that she wa concentr
her fear will upon an unknown object for her whole frame quiver
like a reed shaken in the wind
it wa a veri strang morningcold and clear yet curious still
and with a heavi in the air such as preced a great fall of snow
although for much snow the season wa yet too earli onc or twice too
in that utter calm i thought that i felt everyth shudder not the
ordinari trembl of earthquak howev for the shudder seem to
be of the atmospher quit as much as of the land it wa as though all
natur around us were a live creatur which is veri much afraid
follow ayesha earnest gaze i perceiv that thick smoki cloud
were gather on by on in the clear sky abov the peak and that thei
were edg each of them with a fieri rim watch these fantast and
omin cloud i ventur to sai to her that it look as though the
weather would changenot a veri origin remark but on which the
circumst suggest
ay she answer er night the weather will be wilder even than
my heart no longer shall thei cry for water in kaloon mount holli
mount the advanc begin and unaid she sprang to the saddl of the
mare that oro brought her
then in the midst of the five thousand horsemen we move down upon
the ford as we reach it brink i note that the two divis of
tribesmen were alreadi enter the stream half a mile to the right and
left of us of what befel them i can tell noth from observ
although i learn later that thei forc it after great slaughter on
both side
in front of us wa gather the main bodi of the khania armi mass
by regiment upon the further bank while hundr of pick men stood
up to their middl in the water wait to spear or hamstr our
hors as we advanc
now utter their wild whistl cry our lead compani dash
into the river leav us upon the bank and soon were engag hotli
with the footmen in midstream while thi frai went on oro came to
ayesha told her a spy had report that leo bound in a twowheel
carriag and accompani by aten simbri and a guard had pass
through the enemi camp at night gallop furious toward kaloon
spare thy word i know it she answer and he fell back behind her
our squadron gain the bank have destroi most of the men in the
water but as thei set foot upon it the enemi charg them and drove
them back with loss thrice thei return to the attack and thrice were
repuls in thi fashion at length ayesha grew impati
thei need a leader and i will give them on she said come with me
my holli and follow by the main bodi of the horsemen she rode a
littl wai into the river and there wait until the shatter troop
had fallen back upon us oro whisper to meit is mad the hesea
will be slain
thinkest thou so i answer more like that we shall be slain
a sai at which he smile a littl more than usual and shrug hi
shoulder sinc for all hi soft wai oro wa a brave man also i
believ that he spoke to try me know that hi mistress would take no
harm
ayesha held up her hand in which there wa no weapon and wave it
forward a great cheer answer that signal to advanc and in the
midst of it thi frail whiterob woman spoke to her hors so that it
plung deep into the water
two minut later and spear and arrow were fly about us so thickli
that thei seem to darken the sky i saw men and hors fall to right
and left but noth touch me or the white robe that float a yard
or two ahead five minut and we were gain the further bank and
there the worst fight began
it wa fierc inde yet never an inch did the white robe give back
and where thei went men would follow them or fall we were up the bank
and the enemi wa pack about us but through them we pass slowli
like a boat through an advers sea that buffet but cannot stai it
ye further and further till at last the line ahead grew thin as the
live wedg of horsemen forc it path between themgrew thin broke
and vanish
we had pass through the heart of the host and leav the tribesmen
who follow to deal with it fly fragment rode on half a mile or
so and muster mani were dead and more were hurt but the command wa
issu that all sorewound men should fall out and give their hors
to replac those that had been kill
thi wa done and present we move on three thousand of us now not
more head for kaloon the trot grew to a canter and the canter to a
gallop as we rush forward across that endless plain till at middai
or a littl afterfor thi rout wa far shorter than that taken by leo
and myself in our deviou flight from rassen and hi deathhoundsw
dimli saw the citi of kaloon set upon it hill
now a halt wa order for here wa a reservoir in which wa still
some water whereof the hors drank while the men at of the food thei
carri with them dri meat and barlei meal here too more spi met
us who said that the great armi of aten wa post guard the
citi bridg and that to attack it with our littl forc would mean
destruct but ayesha took no heed of their word inde she
scarc seem to hear them onli she order that all weari hors
should be abandon and fresh on mount
forward again for hour after hour in perfect silenc save for the
thunder of our hors hoof no word spoke ayesha nor did her wild
escort speak onli from time to time thei look over their shoulder
and point with their red spear at the red sky behind
i look also nor shall i forget it aspect the dread fireedg
cloud had grown and gather so that beneath their shadow the plain
lai almost black thei march abov us like an armi in the heaven
while from time to time vapor point shot forward thin like sword
or mass like charg hors
under them a vast still reign it wa as though the earth lai dead
beneath their pall
kaloon lit in a lurid light grew nearer the picket of the foe flew
homeward befor us shake their javelin and their mock laughter
reach us in hollow echo now we saw the vast arrai post rank
on rank with silken banner droop in that stirless air flank and
screen by glitter regiment of hors
an embassi approach us and at the signal of ayesha uplift arm
we halt it wa head by a lord of the court whose face i knew he
pull rein and spoke boldli
listen he to the word of aten er now the stranger lord thy
darl is prison in her palac advanc and we destroi thee and thy
littl band but if by ani miracl thou shouldst conquer then he di
get thee gone to thy mountain fast and the khania give thee peac
and thy peopl their live what answer to the word of the khania
ayesha whisper to oro who call aloudther is no answer go if
ye love life for death draw near to you
so thei went fast as their swift steed would carri them but for a
littl while ayesha still sat lost in thought
present she turn and through her thin veil i saw that her face
wa white and terribl and that the ey in it glow like those of
a lioness at night she said to mehiss the word between her
clench teethholli prepar thyself to look into the mouth of hell
i desir to spare them if i could i swear it but my heart bid me be
bold to put off human piti and us all my secret might if i would see
leo live holli i tell thee thei ar about to murder him
then she cri aloud fear noth captain ye ar but few yet with
you goe the strength of ten thousand thousand now follow the hesea
and whateer ye meet be not dismai repeat it to the soldier that
fear noth thei follow the hesea through yonder host and across the
bridg and into the citi of kaloon
so the chief rode hither and thither cry out her word and the
savag tribesmen answereday we who follow through the water will
follow across the plain onward he for dark swallow us
now some order were given and the compani fell into a format that
resembl a great wedg ayesha herself be it veri point and apex
for though oro and i rode on either side of her spur as we would our
hors head never pass her saddl bow in front of that dark mass
she shone a singl spot of whiteon snowi feather on a black torrent
breast
a scream bugl noteand like giant arm from the shelter of some
grove of poplar tree curv horn of cavalri shot out to surround
us while the broad bosom of the oppos armi shimmer with spear
roll forward as a wave roll crown with sunlit foam and behind it
line upon line uncount lai a surg sea of men
our end wa near we were lost or so it seem
ayesha tore off her veil and held it on high flow from her like
a pennon and lo upon her brow blaze that wide and mystic diadem of
light which onc onli i had seen befor
denser and denser grew the rush cloud abov brighter and brighter
gleam the unearthli star of light beneath louder and louder beat the
sound of the fall hoof of ten thousand hors from the mountain
peak behind us went up sudden sheet of flame it spout fire as a
whale spout foam
the scene wa dread in front the tower of kaloon lurid in a
monstrou sunset abov a gloom as of an eclips around the darkl
sunburnt plain on it aten advanc armi and our rush wedg of
horsemen destin it would appear to inevit doom
ayesha let fall her rein she toss her arm wave the torn white
veil as though it were a signal cast to heaven
instantli from the churn jaw of the unholi night abov belch a
blaze of answer flame that also waver like a rent and shaken veil
in the grasp of a black hand of cloud
then did ayesha roll the thunder of her might upon the children of
kaloon then she call and the terror came such as men had never seen
and perchanc never more will see aw burst of wind tore past us
lift the veri stone and soil befor them and with the wind went
hail and level hiss rain made visibl by the arrow of perpetu
lightn that leapt downward from the sky and upward from the earth
it wa as she had warn me it wa as though hell had broken loos upon
the world yet through that hell we rush on unharm for alwai these
furi pass befor us no arrow flew no javelin wa stain the
jag hail wa a herald of our come the leven that smote and
stab were our sword and spear while ever the hurrican roar and
scream with a million separ voic which blend to on yell of
sound hideou and indescrib
as for the host about us thei melt and were gone
now the dark wa dens like to that of thickest night yet in the
fierc flare of the lightn i saw them run thi wai and that and
amidst the vollei element voic i heard their shout of horror
and of agoni i saw hors and rider roll confus upon the ground
like stormdrift leav i saw their footmen pile in high and whirl
heap while the brand of heaven struck and struck them till thei sank
togeth and grew still
i saw the grove of tree bend shrivel up and vanish i saw the high
wall of kaloon blown in and flee awai while the hous within the
wall took fire to go out beneath the torrent of the drive rain
and again take fire i saw black sweep over us with great wing and
when i look lo those wide wing were flame flood of puls flame
that flew upon the torment air
black utter black turmoil doom dismai beneath me the
labour hors at my side the steadi crest of light which sat on
ayesha brow and through the tumult a clear exult voic that
sangi promis thee wild weather now holli dost thou believ that
i can loos the prison power of the world
lo all wa past and gone and abov us shone the quiet even sky
and befor us lai the empti bridg and beyond it the flame citi of
kaloon but the armi of aten where were thei go ask of those great
cairn that hide their bone go ask it of her widow land
yet of our wild compani of horsemen not on wa lost after us thei
gallop trembl whitelip like men who face to face had fought
and conquer death but triumphantah triumphant
on the high head of the bridg ayesha wheel her hors and so for
on proud moment stood to welcom them at the sight of her gloriou
starcrown counten which now her tribe beheld for the first time
and the last there went up such a shout as men have seldom heard
the goddess that shout thunder worship the goddess
then she turn her hors head again and thei follow on through the
long straight street of the burn citi up to the palac on it crest
as the sun set we sped beneath it gatewai silenc in the courtyard
silenc everywher save for the distant roar of fire and the scare
howl of the deathhound in their kennel
ayesha sprang from her hors and wave back all save oro and myself
swept through the open door into the hall beyond
thei were empti everi oneal were fled or dead yet she never paus
or doubt but so swiftli that we scarc could follow her flit up
the wide stone stair that led to the topmost tower up still up until
we reach the chamber where had dwelt simbri the shaman that same
chamber whenc he wa wont to watch hi star in which aten had
threaten us with death
it door wa shut and bar still at ayesha come ye befor
the mere breath of her presenc the iron bolt snap like twig the
lock flew back and inward burst that massiv portal
now we were within the lamplit chamber and thi is what we saw seat
in a chair palefac bound yet proud and defiantlook wa leo
over him a dagger in hi wither handy about to strike in the
veri actstood the old shaman and on the floor hard by gaze upward
with wideset ey dead and still majest in her death lai aten
khania of kaloon
ayesha wave her arm and the knife fell from simbri hand clatter
on the marbl while in an instant he who had held it wa smitten to
still and becam like a man turn to stone
she stoop lift the dagger and with a swift stroke sever leo
bond then as though overcom at last sank on to a bench in silenc
leo rose look about him bewild and said in the strain voic
of on who is weak with much sufferingbut just in time ayesha
anoth second and that murder dogand he point to the
shamanwel it wa in time but how went the battl and how earnest
thou here through that aw hurrican and oh horac thank heaven
thei did not kill you after all
the battl went ill for some ayesha answer and i came not through
the hurrican but on it wing tell me now what ha befallen thee
sinc we part
trap overpow bound brought here told that i must write to
thee and stop thy advanc or dierefus of cours and then and
he glanc at the dead bodi on the floor
and then repeat ayesha
then that fear tempest which seem to drive me mad oh if thou
couldst have heard the wind howl round these battlement tear
off their stone as though thei were dry leav if thou hadst seen the
lightn fall thick and fast as rain
thei were my messeng i sent them to save thee said ayesha simpli
leo stare at her make no comment but after a paus as though he
were think the matter over he went onaten said as much but i
did not believ her i thought the end of the world had come that wa
all well she return just now more mad even than i wa and told me
that her peopl were destroi and that she could not fight against the
strength of hell but that she could send me thither and took a knife
to kill me
i said kill on for i knew that wherev i went thou wouldst follow
and i wa sick with the loss of blood from some hurt i had in that
struggl and weari of it all so i shut my ey wait for the stroke
but instead i felt her lip press upon my forehead and heard her
saynai i will not do it fare thee well fulfil thou thine own
destini as i fulfil mine for thi cast the dice have fallen against
me elsewher it mai be otherwis i go to load them if i mai
i open my ey and look there aten stood a glass in her
handse it li besid her
defeat yet i win she cri for i do but pass befor thee to
prepar the path that thou shalt tread and to make readi thy place in
the underworld till we meet again i pledg thee for i am destroi
ayesha horsemen ar in my street and cloth in lightn at their
head ride ayesha aveng self
so she drank and fell deadbut now look her breast still quiver
afterward that old man would have murder me for be rope i
could not resist him but the door burst in and thou camest spare him
he is of her blood and he love her
then leo sank back into the chair where we had discov him bound and
seem to fall into a kind of torpor for of a sudden he grew to look
like an old man
thou art sick said ayesha anxious oro thy medicin the draught
i bade thee bring be swift i sai
the priest bow and from some pocket in hi ampl robe produc a
phial which he open and gave to leo sayingdrink my lord thi
stuff will give thee back thy health for it is strong
the stronger the better answer leo rous himself and with
someth like hi old cheer laugh i am thirsti who have touch
noth sinc last night and have fought hard and been carri far
yesand live through that hellish storm
then he took the draught and empti it there must have been virtu
in that potion at least the chang which it produc in him wa
wonder within a minut hi ey grew bright again and the colour
return into hi cheek
thy medicin ar veri good as i have learn of old he said to
ayesha but the best of all of them is to see thee safe and victori
befor me and to know that i who look for death yet live to greet
thee my belov there is food and he point to a board upon which
were meat sai mai i eat of them for i starv
ay she answer softli eat and my holli eat thou also
so we fell to ye we fell to and at even in the presenc of that dead
woman who look so royal in her death of the old magician who stood
there powerless like a man petrifi and of ayesha the wondrou be
that could destroi an armi with the fear weapon which were servant
to her will
onli oro at noth but remain where he wa smile at us
benignantli nor did ayesha touch ani food
chapter xxiii
the yield of ayesha
when i had satisfi myself leo wa still at hi meal for loss of
blood or the effect of the tremend nerv tonic which ayesha order
to be administ to him had made him raven
i watch hi face and becam awar of a curiou chang in it no
immedi chang inde but on i think that had come upon him
gradual although i onli fulli appreci it now after our short
separ in addit to the thin of which i have spoken hi
handsom counten had grown more ether hi ey were full of the
shadow of thing that were to come
hi aspect pain me i knew not why it wa no longer that of the
leo with whom i wa familiar the deepchest mightylimb jovial
upright travel hunter and fightingman who had chanc to love and
be love of a spiritu power incarn in a mould of perfect womanhood
and arm with all the might of natur self these thing were still
present inde but the man wa chang and i felt sure that thi
chang came from ayesha sinc the look upon hi face had becom
exceed like to that which often hover upon her at rest
she also wa watch him with specul dreami ey till
present as some thought swept through her i saw those ey blaze up
and the red blood pour to cheek and brow ye the mighti ayesha whose
dead slain for him lai strewn by the thousand on yonder plain blush
and trembl like a maiden at her first lover kiss
leo rose from the tabl i would that i had been with thee in the
frai he said
at the drift there wa fight she answer afterward none my
minist of fire earth and air smote no more i wake them from their
sleep and at my command thei smote for thee and save thee
mani live to take for on man safeti leo said solemnli as though
the thought pain him
had thei been million and not thousand i would have spent them everi
on on my head be their death not on thine or rather on her and
she point to the dead aten ye on her who made thi war at least
she should thank me who have sent so royal a host to guard her through
the dark
yet it is terribl said leo to think of thee belov red to the
hair with slaughter
what reck i she answer with a splendid pride let their blood
suffic to wash the stain of thy blood from off these cruel hand that
onc did murder thee
who am i that i should blame thee leo went on as though argu
with himself i who but yesterdai kill two mento save myself from
treacheri
speak not of it she exclaim in cold rage i saw the place and
holli thou knowest how i swore that a hundr live should pai for
everi drop of that dear blood of thine and i who lie not have kept
the oath look now on that man who stand yonder struck by my will to
stone dead yet live and sai again what wa he about to do to thee
when i enter here
to take vengeanc on me for the doom of hi queen and of her armi
answer leo and ayesha how knowest thou that a power higher than
thine own will not demand it yet
as he spoke a pale shadow flicker on leo face such a shadow as
might fall from death advanc wing and in the fix ey of the
shaman there shone a stoni smile
for a moment terror seem to take ayesha then it wa gone as quickli
as it came
nai she said i ordain that it shall not be and save on who
listeth not what power reign in thi wide earth that dare defi my
will
so she spoke and as her word of aw pridefor thei were veri
awfulrang round that stonebuilt chamber a vision came to meholli
i saw illimit space peopl with shine sun and sunk in the
infinit void abov them on vast counten clad in a calm so terrif
that at it aspect my spirit sank to nothing ye and i knew that
thi wa destini enthron abov the sphere those lip move and
obedi world rush upon their cours thei move again and these
roll chariot of the heaven were turn or stai appear or
disappear i knew also that against thi calm majesti the be woman
or spirit at my side had dare to hurl her passion and her strength my
soul reel i wa afraid
the dread phantasm pass and when my mind clear again ayesha wa
speak in new triumphant tone
nai nai she cri past is the night of dread dawn the dai of
victori look and she point through the windowplac shatter by
the hurrican to the flame town beneath whenc rose on continu
wail of miseri the wail of women mourn their countless slain while
the fire roar through their home like some unchain and rejoic
demon look leo on the smoke of the first sacrific that i offer to thy
royal state and listen to it music perchanc thou deemst it naught
why then ill give thee other thou lovest war good we will go down
to war and the rebelli citi of the earth shall be the torch of
our march
she paus a moment her delic nostril quiver and her face
alight with the prescienc of ungarn splendour then like a
swoop swallow flit to where by dead aten the gold circlet
fallen from the khania hair lai upon the floor
she stoop lift it and come to leo held it high abov hi head
slowli she let her hand fall until the glitter coronet rest for an
instant on hi brow then she spoke in her gloriou voic that roll
out rich and low a veri paean of triumph and of power
by thi poor earthli symbol i creat thee king of earth yea in it
round for thee is gather all her rule be thou it king and mine
again the coronet wa held aloft again it sank and again she said or
rather chantedwith thi unbroken ring token of etern i swear to
thee the boon of endless dai endur thou while the world endur and

uncount that is the talisman whereat all natur secret path
shall open to thy feet victori victori tread thou her wondrou
wai with me till from her topmost peak at last she waft us to our
immort throne whereof the column twain ar life and death
then ayesha cast awai the crown and lo it fell upon the breast of the
lost aten and rest there
art content with these gift of mine my lord she cri
leo look at her sadli and shook hi head
what more wilt thou then ask and i swear it shall be thine
thou swearest but wilt thou keep the oath
ay by myself i swear by myself and by the strength that bred me
if it be ought that i can grantthen if i refus it to thee mai such
destruct fall upon me as will satisfi even aten watch soul
i heard and i think that anoth heard also at least onc more the
stoni smile shone in the ey of the shaman
i ask of thee noth that thou canst not give ayesha i ask of
thee thyselfnot at some distant time when i have been bath in a
mysteri fire but now now thi night
she shrank back from him a littl as though dismai
sure she said slowli i am like that foolish philosoph who
walk abroad to read the destini of nation in the star fell down
a pitfal dug by idl children and broke hi bone and perish there
never did i guess that with all these glori stretch befor thee
like mountain top on glitter mountain top make a stairwai for thy
mortal feet to the veri dome of heaven thou wouldst still clutch at thy
nativ earth and seek of itbut the common boon of woman love
oh leo i thought that thy soul wa set upon nobler aim that thou
wouldst prai me for wider power for a more vast dominion that as
though thei were but yonder fallen door of wood and iron i should break
for thee the bar of hade and like the eurydic of old fabl draw thee
live down the steep of death or throne thee midst the fire of the
furthest sun to watch it subject world at plai
or i thought that thou wouldst bid me reveal what no woman ever told
the bitter nake truthal my sin and sorrow all the wander
fanci of my fickl thought even what thou knowest not and perchanc
neer shalt know who i am and whenc i came and how to thy charm
ey i seem to chang from foul to fair and what is the purpos of
my love for thee and what the mean of that tale of an angri
goddesswho never wa except in dream
i thoughtnai no matter what i thought save that thou wert far other
than thou art my leo and in so high a moment that thou wouldst seek to
pass the mystic gate my glori can throw wide and with me tread an air
supern to the hidden heart of thing yet thy prayer is but the same
that the whole world whisper beneath the silent moon in the palac and
the cottag among the snow and on the burn desert wast oh my
love thy lip thy lip oh my love be mine now now beneath the
moon beneath the moon
leo i thought better higher of thee
mayhap ayesha thou wouldest have thought wors of me had i been
content with thy sun and constel and spiritu gift and
domin that i neither desir nor understand
if i had said to thee be thou my angel not my wife divid the ocean
that i mai walk it bed pierc the firmament and show me how grow the
star tell me the origin of be and of death and instruct me in
their issu give up the race of mankind to my sword and the wealth
of all the earth to fill my treasuri teach me also how to drive
the hurrican as thou canst do and to bend the law of natur to my
purpos on earth make me half a goda thou art
but ayesha i am no god i am a man and as a man i seek the woman whom
i love oh divest thyself of all these wrap of thy powerthat
power which strew thy path with dead and keep me apart from thee if
onli for on short night forget the ambit that gnaw unceasingli at
thy soul i sai forget thy great and be a woman andmi wife
she made no answer onli look at him and shook her head caus her
gloriou hair to rippl like water beneath a gentl breez
thou deniest me he went on with gather strength and that thou
canst not do that thou mayest not do for ayesha thou hast sworn and
i demand the fulfil of thine oath
hark thou i refus thy gift i will have none of thy rule who ask no
pharaoh throne and wish to do good to men and not to kill themthat
the world mai profit i will not go with thee to kor nor be bath in
the breath of life i will leav thee and cross the mountain or perish
on them nor with all thy strength canst thou hold me to thy side who
inde needest me not no longer will i endur thi daili torment
the torment of thy presenc and thy sweet word thy love look thy
promis for next year next yearnext year so keep thine oath or let
me begon
still ayesha stood silent onli now her head droop and her breast
began to heav then leo step forward he seiz her in hi arm and
kiss her she broke from hi embrac i know not how for though she
return it wa close enough and again stood befor him but at a littl
distanc
did i not warn holli she whisper with a sigh to bid thee bewar
lest i should catch thy human fire man i sai to thee it begin to
smoulder in my heart and should it grow to flame
why then he answer laugh we will be happi for a littl while
ay leo but how long why wert thou sole lord of thi loveli of
mine and not set abov their harm night and dai a hundr jealou
dagger would seek thy heart andfind it
how long ayesha a lifetim a year a month a minutei neither know
nor care and while thou art true to me i fear no stab of envi
is it so wilt take the risk i can promis thee noth thou
mightesty in thi wai or in that thou mightestdi
and if i die what then shall we be separ
nai nai leo that is not possibl we never can be sever of thi
i am sure it is sworn to me but then through other live and other
sphere higher live and higher sphere mayhap our fate must forc a
pain path to their last goal of union
why then i take the hazard ayesha shall the life that i can risk to
slai a leopard or a lion in the sport of an idl hour be too great a
price to offer for the splendour of thy breast thine oath ayesha i
claim thine oath
then it wa that in ayesha there began the most mysteri and thrill
of her mani chang yet how to describ it i know not unless it be by
simil
onc in thibet we were imprison for month by snow that stretch
down from the mountain slope into the vallei and oh how weari did we
grow of those arid ach field of purest white at length rain set
in and blind mist in which it wa not safe to wander that made the
dark night darker yet
so it wa until there came a morn when see the sun shine we went
to our door and look out behold a miracl gone were the snow that
choke the vallei and in the place of them appear vivid spring
grass star everywher with flower and murmur brook and bird
that sang and nest in the willow gone wa the frown sky and all
the blue firmament seem on tender smile gone were the auster of
winter with hi harsh wind and in their place spring companion by
her zephyr glide down the vale sing her song of love and life
there in thi high chamber in the presenc of the live and the dead
while the last act of the great tragedi unrol itself befor me
look on ayesha that forgotten scene sprang into my mind for on her
face just such a chang had come hitherto with all her loveli
the heart of ayesha had seem like that winter mountain wrap in
it unapproach snow and befor her pure brow and ici selfcommand
aspir sank abash and desir di
she swore she love and her love fulfil itself in death and mani a
mysteri wai yet it wa hard to believ that thi passion of her wa
more than a spoken part for how can the star seek the moth although the
moth mai seek the star though the man mai worship the goddess for all
her smile divin how can the goddess love the man
but now everyth wa alter look ayesha grew human i could see
her heart beat beneath her robe and hear her breath come in soft sweet
sob while oer her upturn face and in her allur ey there spread
itself that look which is born of love alon radiant and more radiant
did she seem to grow sweeter and more sweet no longer the veil
hermit of the cave no longer the oracl of the sanctuari no longer
the valkyri of the battleplain but onli the loveliest and most happi
bride that ever gladden a husband ey
she spoke and it wa of littl thing for thu ayesha proclaim the
conquest of herself
fie she said show her white robe torn with spear and stain by
the dust and dew of war fie my lord what marriag garment ar these
in which at last i come to thee who would have been adorn in regal
gem and raiment befit to my state and thine
i seek the woman not her garment said leo hi burn ey fix
upon her face
thou seekest the woman ah there it li tell me leo am i woman
or spirit sai that i am woman for now the propheci of thi dead aten
li heavi on my soul aten who said that mortal and immort mai not
mate
thou must be woman or thou wouldst not have torment me as thou hast
done these mani week
i thank thee for the comfort of thy word yet wa it woman whose
breath wrought destruct upon yonder plain wa it to a woman that
blast and lightn bow and said we ar here command us we obei
did that dead thing and she point to the shatter door break inward
at a woman will or could a woman charm thi man to stone
oh leo would that i were woman i tell thee that id lai all my
grandeur down a wed offer at thy feet could i be sure that for
on short year i should be naught but woman andthi happi wife
thou sayest that i did torment thee but it is i who have known
torment i who desir to yield and dare not ay i tell thee leo
were i not sure that thy littl stream of life is drain dry into the
great ocean of my life drawn thither as the sea draw it river or
as the sun draw mist een now i would not yield but i know for my
wisdom tell it me er ever we could reach the shore of libya the ill
work would be done and thou dead of thine own long thou dead and i
widow who never wa a wife
therefor see like lost aten i take the dice and cast them not
know how thei shall fall not know how thei shall fall for good
or ill i cast and she made a wild motion as of some desper gamest
throw hi last throw
so ayesha went on the thing is done and the number sum for ay
though it be hidden from my sight i have made an end of doubt and
fear and come death come life ill meet it brave
sai how shall we be wed i have it holli here must join our hand
who els he that ever wa our guid shall give me unto thee and thee
to me thi burn citi is our altar the dead and live ar our
wit on earth and heaven in place of rite and ceremoni for
thi first time i lai my lip on thine and when ti done for music
ill sing thee a nuptial chant of love such as mortal poet ha not
written nor have mortal lover heard
come holli do now thy part and give thi maiden to thi man
like on in a dream i obei her and took ayesha outstretch hand
and leo as i held them thu i tell the truthit wa as though some
fire rush through my vein from her to him shake and shatter me
with swift wave of burn and unearthli bliss with the fire too came
gloriou vision and sound of mighti music and a sens as though my
brain fill with overflow life must burst asund beneath it
weight
i join their hand i know not how i bless them i know not in what
word then i reel back against the wall and watch
thi is what i saw
with an abandon and a passion so splendid and intens that it seem
more than human with a murmur cry of husband ayesha cast her arm
about her lover neck and draw down hi head to her so that the
gold hair wa mingl with her raven lock she kiss him on the lip
thu thei clung a littl while and as thei clung the gentl diadem
of light from her brow spread to hi brow also and through the white
wrap of her robe becam visibl her perfect shape shine with
faint fire with a littl happi laugh she left him sai
thu leo vincei oh thu for the second time do i give myself to
thee and with thi flesh and spirit all i swore to thee there in the
dim cave of kor and here in the palac of kaloon know thou thi come
what mai never never more shall we be separ who ar ordain on
whilst thou livest i live at thy side and when thou diest if die thy
must ill follow thee through world and firmament nor shall all the
door of heaven or hell avail against my love where thou goest thither
i will go when thou sleepest with thee will i sleep and it is my voic
that thou shalt hear murmur through the dream of life and death my
voic that shall summon thee to awaken in the last hour of everlast
dawn when all thi night of miseri hath furl her wing for ay
listen now while i sing to thee and hear that song aright for in it
melodi at length thou shalt learn the truth which unw i might not
tell to thee thou shalt learn who and what i am and who and what
thou art and of the high purpos of our love and thi dead woman
hate and of all that i have hid from thee in veil bewild word
and vision
listen then my love and lord to the burden of the song of fate
she ceas speak and gaze heavenward with a rapt look as though she
wait for some inspir to fall upon her and never nevernot even
in the fire of kor had ayesha seem so divin as she did now in thi
moment of the ripe harvest of her love
my ey wander from her to leo who stood befor her pale and still
still as the deathlik figur of the shaman still as the khania
ici shape which stare upward from the ground what wa pass in hi
mind i wonder that he could remain thu insens while in all her
might and aw beauti thi proud be worship him
hark she began to sing in a voic so rich and perfect that it honi
note seem to cloi my blood and stop my breath
the world wa not wa not and in the womb of silenc
slept the soul of men yet i wa and thou
suddenli ayesha stop and i felt rather than saw the horror on her
face
look leo swai to and fro as though the stone beneath him were but
a rock boat to and fro he swai stretch out hi blind arm to
clasp herthen suddenli fell backward and lai still
oh what a shriek wa that she gave sure it must have waken the
veri corps upon the plain sure it must have echo in the star
on shriek onlythen throb silenc
i sprang to him and there wither in ayesha kiss slain by the fire
of her love leo lai deadlai dead upon the breast of dead aten
chapter xxiv
the pass of ayesha
i heard ayesha sai present and the word struck me as dread
in their hopeless accept of a doom against which even she had no
strength to struggl
it seem that my lord ha left me for awhil i must hasten to my lord
afar
after that i do not quit know what happen i had lost the man who wa
all in all to me friend and child in on and i wa crush as i had
never been befor it seem so sad that i old and outworn should
still live on whilst he in the flower of hi ag snatch from joi and
great such as no man hath known lai thu asleep
i think that by an afterthought ayesha and oro tri to restor him
tri without result for here her power were of no avail inde my
convict is that although some linger life still kept him on hi
feet leo had realli di at the moment of her embrac sinc when i
look at him befor he fell hi face wa that of a dead man
ye i believ that last speech of her although she knew it not wa
address to hi spirit for in her burn kiss hi flesh had perish
when at length i recov myself a littl it wa to hear ayesha in
a cold calm voiceh face i could not see for she had veil
herselfcommand certain priest who had been summon to bear awai
the bodi of that accurs woman and buri her as befit her rank even
then i bethought me i rememb of the tale of jehu and jezebel
leo look strang calm and happi lai now upon a couch the arm
fold on hi breast when the priest had tramp awai carri their
royal burden ayesha who sat by hi bodi brood seem to awak for
she rose and saidi need a messeng and for no common journei
sinc he must search out the habit of the shade and she turn
herself toward oro and appear to look at him
now for the first time i saw that priest chang counten a littl
for the etern smile of which even thi scene had not quit rid it
left hi face and he grew pale and trembl
thou art afraid she said contemptu be at rest oro i will
not send on who is afraid holli wilt thou go for meand him
ay i answer i am weari of life and desir no other end onli let
it be swift and painless
she muse a while then saidnai thy time is not yet thou still hast
work to do endur my holli ti onli for a breath
then she look at the shaman the man turn to stone who all thi
while had stood there as a statu stand and criedawak
instantli he seem to thaw into life hi limb relax hi breast
heav he wa as he had alwai been ancient gnarl malevol
i hear thee mistress he said bow as a man bow to the power that
he hate
thou seest simbri and she wave her hand
i see thing have befallen as aten and i foretold have thei not
er long the corps of a newcrown khan of kaloon and he point
to the gold circlet that ayesha had set on leo brow will lie upon
the brink of the pit of flamea i foretold an evil smile crept into
hi ey and he went onhadst thou not smote me dumb i who watch
could have warn thee that thei would so befal but great mistress
it pleas thee to smite me dumb and so it seem o he that thou hast
overshot thyself and liest broken at the foot of that pinnacl which
step by step thou hast climb for more than two thousand weari year
see what thou hast bought at the price of countless live that now
befor the throne of judgment bring accus against thy power
misus and cry out for justic on thy head and he look at the dead
form of leo
i sorrow for them yet simbri thei were well spent ayesha answer
reflect who by their forewritten doom as it wa decre
held thy knife from fall and thu won me my husband ay and i am
happyhappi than such blind bat as thou can see or guess for know
that now with him i have rew my wander soul divorc by sin from
me and that of our marriag kiss which burn hi life awai there shall
still be born to us children of forgiv and etern grace and all
thing that ar pure and fair
look thou simbri i will honour thee thou shalt be my messeng and
bewar bewar i sai how thou dost fulfil thine offic sinc of everi
syllabl thou must render an account
go thou down the dark path of death and sinc even my thought mai
not reach to where he sleep tonight search out my lord and sai to him
that the feet of hi spous ayesha ar follow fast bid him have no
fear for me who by thi last sorrow have aton my crime and am in hi
embrac regener tell him that thu it wa appoint and thu is
best sinc now he is dip inde in the etern flame of life now
for him the mortal night is done and the everlast dai aris command
him that he await me in the gate of death where it is grant that i
greet him present thou hearest
i hear o queen mightyfromofold
on messag more sai to aten that i forgiv her her heart wa high
and greatli did she plai her part there in the gate we will balanc
our account thou hearest
i hear o etern star that hath conquer night
then man begon
as the word left ayesha lip simbri leapt from the floor grasp at
the air as though he would clutch hi own depart soul stagger back
against the board where leo and i had eaten overthrow it and amid a
ruin of gold and silver vessel fell down and di
she look at him then said to mese though he ever hate me thi
magician who ha known ayesha from the first did homag to my ancient
majesti at last when li and defianc would serv hi end no more
no longer now do i hear the name that hi dead mistress gave to me
the starthathathfallen in hi lip and in veri truth is becom the
starwhichhathburstthebondsofnight and rearisen shine for
evershin with it twin immort to set no moremi holli well
he is gone and er now those that serv me in the underworlddost
rememberth sawest their captain in the sanctuarybend the head at
great ayesha word and make her place readi near her spous
but oh what folli ha been mine when even here my wrath can show such
power how could i hope that my lord would outliv the fire of my love
still it wa better so for he sought not the pomp i would have given
him nor desir the death of men yet such pomp must have been hi
portion in thi poor shadow of a world and the step that encircl an
usurp throne ar ever slipperi with blood
thou art weari my holli go rest thee tomorrow night we journei to
the mountain there to celebr these obsequi
i crept into the room adjoiningit had been simbrisand laid me down
upon hi bed but to sleep i wa not abl it door wa open and in the
light of the burn citi that shone through the casement i could
see ayesha watch by her dead hour after hour she watch her head
rest on her hand silent stirless she wept not no sigh escap
her onli watch as a tender woman watch a slumber babe that she
know will awak at dawn
her face wa unveil and i perceiv that it had greatli chang all
pride and anger were depart from it it wa grown soft wist yet
full of confid and quiet for a while i could not think of what
it remind me till suddenli i rememb now it wa like inde the
counterpart almost of the holi and majest semblanc of the statu
of the mother in the sanctuari ye with just such a look of love and
power as that mother cast upon her frighten child newrisen from it
dream of death did ayesha gaze upon her dead while her part lip
also seem to whisper some tale of hope sure and immort
at length she rose and came into my chamber
thou thinkest me fallen and dost griev for me my holli she said in
a gentl voic know my fear lest some such fate should overtak my
lord
ay ayesha i griev for thee as for myself
spare then thy piti holli sinc although the human part of me would
have kept him on the earth now my spirit doth rejoic that for a while
he ha burst hi mortal bond for mani an ag although i knew it not
in my proud defianc of the univers law i have fought against hi
true weal and mine thrice have i and the angel wrestl match
strength with strength and thrice ha he conquer me yet as he bore
awai hi prize thi night he whisper wisdom in my ear thi wa hi
messag that in death is love home in death it strength that from
the charnelhous of life thi love spring again glorifi and pure to
reign a conqueror forev therefor i wipe awai my tear and crown
onc more a queen of peac i go to join him whom we have lost there
where he await us as it is grant to me that i shall do
but i am selfish and forgot thou needest rest sleep friend i bid
thee sleep
and i slept wonder as my ey close whenc ayesha drew thi strang
confid and comfort i know not but it wa there real and not
assum i can onli suppos therefor that some illumin had fallen
on her soul and that as she state the love and end of leo in a wai
unknown did suffic to satisfi her court of sin
at the least those sin and all the load of death that lai at her door
never seem to troubl her at all she appear to look upon them
mere as event which were destin to occur as inevit fruit of
a seed sow long ago by the hand of fate for whose work she wa not
respons the fear and consider which weigh with mortal did
not affect or oppress her in thi as in other matter ayesha wa a law
unto herself
when i awok it wa dai and through the windowplac i saw the rain
that the peopl of kaloon had so long desir fall in on straight
sheet i saw also that ayesha seat by the shroud form of leo wa
give order to her priest and captain and to some nobl who had
surviv the slaughter of kaloon as to the new govern of the land
then i slept again
it wa even and ayesha stood at my bedsid
all is prepar she said awak and ride with me
so we went escort by a thousand cavalri for the rest stai to
occupi or perchanc to plunder the land of kaloon in front the bodi
of leo wa born by relai of priest and behind it rode the veil
ayesha i at her side
strang wa the contrast between thi departur and our arriv
then the rush squadron the element that rave the perpetu sheen
of lightn seen through the swing curtain of the hail the voic
of despair from an armi roll in blood beneath the chariot wheel of
thunder
now the whitedrap corps the slowpac hors the rider with
their spear revers and on either side seen in that melancholi
moonlight the women of kaloon buri their innumer dead
and ayesha herself yesterdai a valkyri crest with the star of flame
todai but a bereav woman humbl follow her husband to the tomb
yet how thei fear her some widow stand on the grave mould she
had dug point as we pass to the bodi of leo utter bitter word
which i could not catch thereon her companion flung themselv upon
her and fell her with fist and spade prostrat themselv upon the
ground throw dust on their hair in token of their submiss to the
priestess of death
ayesha saw them and said to me with someth of her ancient fire and
pridei tread the plain of kaloon no more yet as a part gift have
i read thi highstomach peopl a lesson that thei need long not
for mani a gener o holli will thei dare to lift spear against the
colleg of he and it subject tribe
again it wa night and where onc lai that of the khan the man whom he
had kill flank by the burn pillar the bier of leo stood in
the inmost sanctuari befor the statu of the mother whose gentl
unchang ey seem to search hi quiet face
on her throne sat the veil hesea give command to her priest and
priestess
i am weari she said and it mai be that i leav you for a while to
restbeyond the mountain a year or a thousand yearsi cannot sai
if so let papav with oro as her counsellor and husband and their
seed hold my place till i return again
priest and priestess of the colleg of he over new territori
have i held my hand take them as an heritag from me and rule them
well and gentli henceforth let the hesea of the mountain be also the
khania of kaloon
priest and priestess of our ancient faith learn to look through it
rite and token outward and visibl to the inform spirit if he
the goddess never rule on earth still piti natur rule if the
name of isi never rang through the court of heaven still in heaven
with all love fulfil nurs her human children on her breast
dwell the mighti motherhood where of thi statu is the symbol that
motherhood which bore us and unforget faith will receiv us
at the end
for of the bread of bitter we shall not alwai eat of the water
of tear we shall not alwai drink beyond the night the royal sun ride
on ever the rainbow shine around the rain though thei slip from our
clutch hand like melt snow the live we lose shall yet be found
immort and from the burntout fire of our human hope will spring a
heavenli star
she paus and wave her hand as though to dismiss them then ad by
an afterthought point to myselfthi man is my belov friend and
guest let him be your also it is my will that you tend and guard him
here and when the snow have melt and summer is at hand that
you fashion a wai for him through the gulf and bring him across the
mountain by which he came till you leav him in safeti hear and
forget not for be sure that to me you shall give account of him
the night drew toward the dawn and we stood upon the peak abov the
gulf of fire four of us onlyayesha and i and oro and papav for
the bearer had laid down the bodi of leo upon it edg and gone their
wai the curtain of flame flare in front of us it crest bent over
like a billow in the gale and to leeward on by on float the
tornoff cloud and pinnacl of fire by the dead leo knelt ayesha
gaze at that ici smile face but speak no singl word at length
she rose and saiddark draw near my holli that deep dark
which forerun the glori of the dawn now fare thee well for on littl
hour when thou art about to die but not befor call me and i will
come to thee stir not and speak not till all be done lest when i am no
longer here to be thy guard some presenc should pass on and slai thee
think not that i am conquer for now my name is victori think not
that ayesha strength is spent or her tale is done for of it thou
readest but a singl page think not even that i am todai that thing of
sin and pride the ayesha thou didst ador and fear i who in my lord
love and sacrific have again conceiv my soul for know that now onc
more as at the begin hi soul and mine ar on
she thought awhil and ad
friend take thi sceptr in memori of me but bewar how thou usest it
save at the last to summon me for it ha virtu and she gave me the
jewel sistrum that she borethen said
so kiss hi brow stand back and be still
now as onc befor the dark gather on the pit and present
although i heard no prayer though now no mighti music broke upon the
silenc through that dark beat up the gale came the twowing
flame and hover where ayesha stood
it appear it vanish and on by on the long minut crept awai
until the first spear of dawn lit upon the point of rock
lo it wa empti utterli empti and lonesom gone wa the corps of
leo and gone too wa ayesha the imperi the divin
whither had she gone i know not but thi i know that as the light
return and the broad sheet of flame flare out to meet it i seem to
see two gloriou shape sweep upward on it bosom and the face that
thei wore were those of leo and of ayesha
often and often dure the weari month that follow whilst i wander
through the templ or amid the winter snow upon the mountain side did
i seek to solv thi questionwhith had she gone i ask it of my
heart i ask it of the ski i ask it of the spirit of leo which
often wa so near to me
but no sure answer ever came nor will i hazard on as mysteri wrap
ayesha origin and livesfor the truth of these thing i never
learnedso did mysteri wrap her death or rather her depart for
i cannot think her dead sure she still is if not on earth then in
some other sphere
so i believ and when my own hour come and it draw near swiftli i
shall know whether i believ in vain or whether she will appear to be
my guid as with her last word she swore that she would do then
too i shall learn what she wa about to reveal to leo when he di the
purpos of their be and of their love
so i can wait in patienc who must not wait for long though my heart is
broken and i am desol
oro and all the priest were veri good to me inde even had it been
their wish thei would have fear to be otherwis who rememb and
were sure that in some time to come thei must render an account of thi
matter to their dread queen by wai of return i help them as i
wa best abl to draw up a scheme for the govern of the conquer
countri of kaloon and with my advic upon mani other question
and so at length the long month wore awai till at the approach of
summer the snow melt then i said that i must be gone thei gave me
of their treasur in preciou stone lest i should need monei for my
fare sinc the gold of which i had such plenti wa too heavi to be
carri by on man alon thei led me across the plain of kaloon where
now the husbandmen those that were left of them plough the land and
scatter seed and so on to it citi but amidst those blacken ruin
over which aten palac still frown unharm i would not enter
for to me it wa and alwai must remain a home of death so i camp
outsid the wall by the river just where leo and i had land after
that poor mad khan set us free or rather loos us to be hunt by hi
deathhound
next dai we took boat and row up the river past the place where we
had seen aten cousin murder till we came to the gatehous here
onc again i slept or rather did not sleep
on the follow morn i went down into the ravin and found to my
surpris that the rapid torrentshallow enough nowhad been roughli
bridg and that in prepar for my come rude but suffici
ladder were built on the face of the oppos precipic at the foot of
these i bade farewel to oro who at our part smile benignantli as
on the dai we met
we have seen strang thing togeth i said to him not know what
els to sai
veri strang he answer
