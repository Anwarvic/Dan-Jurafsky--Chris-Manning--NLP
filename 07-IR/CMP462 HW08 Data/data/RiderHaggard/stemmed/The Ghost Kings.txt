extract
from letter head the king kraal zululand 12th mai 1855
the zulu about here have a strang stori of a white girl who in
dingaan dai wa suppos to hold the spirit of some legendari goddess
of their who is also white thi girl thei sai wa veri beauti and
brave and had great power in the land befor the battl of the blood
river which thei fought with the emigr boer her titl wa ladi of
the zulu or more shortli zoola which mean heaven
she seem to have been the daughter of a wander pioneer missionari
but the king i mean dingaan murder her parent of whom he wa
jealou after which she went mad and curs the nation and it is to thi
curs that thei still attribut the death of dingaan and their defeat
and other misfortun of that time
ultim it appear in order to be rid of thi girl and her evil ey
thei sold her to the doctor of a dwarf peopl who live far awai in a
forest and worship tree sinc when noth more ha been heard of
her but accord to them the curs stop behind
if i can find out anyth more of thi curiou stori i will let you
know but i doubt if i shall be abl to do so although fifteen year or
so have pass sinc dingaan death in 1840 the kaffir ar veri shy of
talk about thi poor ladi and i think onli did so to me becaus i am
neither an offici nor a missionari but on whom thei look upon as a
friend becaus i have doctor so mani of them when i ask the induna
about her at first thei pretend total ignor but on my press the
question on of them said that all that tale wa unlucki and went
beyond with mopo now mopo as i think i wrote to you wa the man who
stab king chaka dingaan brother he is suppos to have been mix
up in the death of dingaan also and to be dead himself at ani rate he
vanish awai after panda came to the throne
chapter i
the girl
the afternoon wa intens terribl hot look at from the high ground
where thei were encamp abov the river the sea a mile or two to her
rightfor thi wa the coast of pondolandto littl rachel dove stare
at it with sad ey seem an illimit sheet of stagnant oil yet
there wa no sun for a grei haze hung like a veil beneath the arch of the
sky so dens and thick that it rai were cut off from the earth which
lai below silent and stifl tom the kaffir driver had told her that a
storm wa come a father of storm which would end the great drought
therefor he had gone to a kloof in the mountain where the oxen were in
charg of the other two nativ boyssinc on thi upland there wa no
pasturag to drive them back to the waggon for as he explain to her
in such tempest cattl ar apt to take fright and rush awai for mile
and without cattl their plight would be even wors than it wa at
present
at least thi wa what tom said but rachel who had been brought up among
nativ and understood their mind knew that hi real reason wa that he

there were few flower at thi season of the year place a shrivel
branch or two of mimosa upon the stonesth best offer thei had to
make
rachel and her father were the sole mourner at thi funer if we mai

cliff and an old baboon which peer at these strang proceed from

indignantli her mother could not come becaus she wa ill with grief and
fever in a littl tent by the waggon when it wa all over thei return

mr dove wa ly on a bed made of the cartel or frame strung with
strip of green hide which had been remov from the waggon a pretti
palefac woman with a profus of fair hair rachel alwai rememb

her father straighten himself with a sigh and said in a voic that

her mother sat up look at him reproachfulli with her blue ey and

then unabl to bear ani more of it rachel had fled from the tent and
sat herself down at a distanc to watch the oili sea
it ha been said that rachel wa onli fifteen but in southern africa
girl grow quickli to womanhood also her experi had been of a natur
to ripen her intellig thu she wa quit abl to form a judgment of
her parent their virtu and their weak rachel wa english born
but had no recollect of england sinc she came to south africa when she
wa four year old it wa shortli after her birth that thi
missionaryfuri seiz upon her father as a result of some meet which
he had attend in london he wa then a clergyman with a good live in a
quiet hertfordshir parish and possess of some privat mean but
noth would suit him short of abandon all hi prospect and sail
for south africa in obedi to hi call rachel knew all thi becaus
her mother had often told her ad that she and her peopl who were of
a good scotch famili had struggl against thi south african scheme even
to the verg of open quarrel
at length inde it came to a choic between submiss and separ
mr dove had declar that not even for her sake would he be guilti of
sin against the spirit which had chosen him to bring light to those who
sat in darknessthat is the kaffir and especi to that section of
them who were in bondag to the boer for at thi time an agit wa
in progress in england which led ultim to the free of the slave
of the cape dutch and afterward to the exodu of the latter into the
wilder and most of those war with which our gener is familiar
so as she wa devot to her husband who apart from hi religi
enthusiasm or rather possess wa in truth a veri lovabl man she
gave wai and came befor thei sail howev the gener gloom wa
darken by mr dove announc that someth in her heart told her that
neither of them would ever see home again as thei were doom to die at
the hand of savag
now whatev the reason or explan scientif imposs as the
fact might be it remain a fact that janei dove like her mother and
sever of her scottish ancestor wa foresight or at least so her
kith and kin believ therefor when she commun to them her
convict as though it were a piec of everydai intellig thei never
doubt it accuraci for a minut but onli redoubl their effort to
prevent her from go to africa even her husband did not doubt it but
remark irrit that it seem a piti she could not sometim be
foresight as to agreeabl futur event sinc for hi part he wa quit
will to wait for disagre on until thei happen not that he
quail person from the prospect of martyrdom thi he could
contempl with complac and even enthusiasm but zealot though he
wa he did shrink from the thought that hi beauti and delic wife
might be call upon to share the glori of that crown inde as hi own
purpos wa unalter he now himself suggest that he should go forth
to seek it alon
then it wa that hi wife show an unsuspect strength of charact she
said that she had marri him for better or for wors against the wish
of her famili that she love and respect him and that she would rather
be murder by kaffir in due season than endur a separ which might
be lifelong so in the end the pair of them with their littl daughter
rachel depart in a sail ship and their friend and relat knew
them no more
their subsequ histori up to the date of the open of thi stori mai
be told in veri few word as a missionari the reverend john dove wa not
a success the boer in the eastern part of the cape coloni where he
labour did not appreci hi effort to christianis their slave the
slave did not appreci them either inasmuch as saint though he might
be he quit lack the sympathet insight which would enabl him to
understand that a nativ with thousand of gener of savageri behind
him is a differ be from a highli educ christian and on who
should be judg by anoth law their sin amongst which he includ all
their most cherish inherit custom appal him as he continu
proclaim from the housetop moreov when occasion he did snatch a
brand from the burn and the said brand subsequ prove that it wa
still alight or wors still replac it origin fail by those of
the white man such as drink theft and ly whereof befor it had been
innoc he would openli condemn it to etern punish further he
wa too insubordin or as he call it too honest to submit to the
author of hi local superior in the church and therefor would onli
work for hi own hand final he caus hi cup to overflow as he
describ it or in plain english made the countri too hot to hold him
by becom involv in a bitter quarrel with the boer of these on the
whole worthi folk he form the worst and in the main a veri unjust
opinion which he sent to england to be reprint in church paper or to
the home govern to be publish in bluebook in due cours these
document reach south africa again where thei were translat into
dutch and becam incident on of the caus of the great trek
the boer were furiou and threaten to shoot him as a slander the
english author were also furiou and request him to ceas from
controversi or to leav the countri at last stubborn as he might be
circumst prove too much for him and as hi conscienc would not
allow him to be silent mr dove chose the latter altern the onli
question wa whither he should go as he wa well off have inherit a
moder fortun in addit to what he had befor he left england hi
poor wife plead with him to return home point out that there he
would be abl to lai hi case befor the british public thi cours had
attract for him but after a night reflect and prayer he
reject it as a speciou temptat sent by satan
what he argu should he return to live in luxuri in england not onli
unmartyr but a palpabl failur hi mission quit unfulfil hi wife
might go if she like and take their surviv children rachel and the
newborn babi boi with her thei had buri two other littl girl but
he would stick to hi post and hi duti he had seen some englishmen who
had visit the countri call natal where white peopl were begin to
settl in that land it seem there were no slavedriv boer and the
nativ accord to all account much need the guidanc of the
gospel especi a certain king of the peopl call zulu who wa
name chaka or dingaan he wa not sure which thi feroci person he
particularli desir to encount have littl doubt that in the absenc
of the contamin boer he would be abl to induc him to see the error
of hi wai and chang the nation custom especi those of fight
and wors still of polygami
hi unhappi wife listen and wept for now the martyr crown which she
had alwai foreseen seem uncomfort near inde as it were it
glow blood red within reach of her hand moreov in her heart she did
not believ that kaffir could be convert at ani rate at present thei
were fight men as her highland forefath had been and her scottish
blood could understand the weak while as for thi polygami she had
long ago secretli conclud that the practic wa on which suit them
veri well as it had suit david and solomon and even abraham but for
all thi although she wa sure in her uncanni fashion that her babi
death would come of her stai she refus to leav her husband as she
had refus eleven year befor
doubtless affect wa at the bottom of it for janei dove wa a veri
faith woman also there were other thingsher fatal and stronger
still her weari she believ that thei were doom well let the
doom fall she had no fear of the beyond at the best it might be happi
and at the worst deep everlast rest and peac and she felt as though
she need thousand of year of rest and peac moreov she wa sure no
harm would come to rachel the veri appl of her ey that she wa mark
to live and to find happi even in thi wild land so it came about
that she refus her husband offer to allow her to return home where she
had no longer ani ti and for perhap the twentieth time prepar
herself to journei she knew not whither
rachel seat there in the sunless swelter heat reflect on these
thing of cours she did not know all the stori but most of it had come
under her observ in on wai or other and be shrewd by natur she
could guess the rest for she who wa companionless had much time for
reflect and for guess she sympathis with her father in hi idea
understand vagu that there wa someth larg and nobl about them
but in the main bodi and mind she wa her mother child alreadi she
show her mother dreami beauti to which were ad her father
straight featur and clear grei ey togeth with a promis of hi
height but of hi charact she had littl that is outsid of a courag
and fixiti of purpos which mark them both
for the rest she wa far or forese like her mother apprehend
the end of thing by some strang instinct also veri faith in
charact
rachel wa unhappi she did not mind the hardship and the heat for she
wa accustom to both and her health wa so perfect that it would have
need much wors thing to affect her but she love the babi that wa
gone and wonder whether she would ever see it again on the whole she
thought so for here that intuit of her came in but at the best she
wa sure that there would be long to wait she love her mother also and
griev more for her than for herself especi now when she wa so ill
moreov she knew and share her mind thi journei she felt wa
foolish her father wa a man led by a star as the nativ sai and
would follow it over the edg of the world and be no nearer he wa not
fit to have charg of her mother
of herself she did not think so much still at grahamstown for a year or
so there had been other children for companion dutch most of them it is
true and all rough in mind and manner yet thei were white and human
while she plai with them she could forget she knew so much more than
thei did that for instanc she could read the gospel in greekwhich
her father had taught her ever sinc she wa a littl childwhil thei
could scarc spell them out in the taal or boer dialect and that thei
had never heard even of william the conqueror she did not care
particularli about greek and william the conqueror but she did care for
friend and now thei were all gone from her gone like the babi as far
off as william the conqueror and she she wa alon in the wilder
with a father who talk and thought of heaven all dai long and a mother
who live in memori and walk in the shadow of doom and oh she wa
unhappi
her grei ey fill with tear so that she could no longer see that
everlast ocean which she did not regret as it weari her she wipe
them with the back of her hand that wa burnt quit brown by the sun and
turn impati fell to watch two of those strang insect known
as the prai manti or often in south africa as hottentot god which
after a seri of genuflect were now fight desper among the
dead stalk of grass at her feet men could not be more savag she
reflect for realli their feroc wa hideou then a great tear fell
upon the head of on of them and astonish by thi phenomenon or
think perhap that it had begun to rain it ran awai and hid itself
while it adversari sat up and look about it triumphantli take to
itself all the credit of conquest
she heard a step behind her and have again furtiv wipe her ey
with her hand the onli handkerchief avail look round to see her
father stalk toward her

a cruel amus he said especi as i have heard that boi ye
and men too pit these poor insect against each other and make bet

toward the littl grave under the rock then while for the second time
her father hesit not know what to answer she ad quickli is

no he said wors i think veri hyster and quit unabl to see
thing in the true light
she rose and face him for she wa a courag child then ask

to drag her into thi wilder
at thi question he grew veri angri and began to scold and to talk of the
wicked of abandon hi call

then as for the third time he could find no answer he declar
vehement that thei were both in leagu against him instrument us by
the evil on to tempt him from hi duti by work on hi natur fear

chapter ii
the boi
the river toward which rachel head on of the mouth of the umtavuna
wa much further off than it look it wa inde not less than a mile
and a half awai she had said that she fear noth and it wa true
for extraordinari courag wa on of thi child characterist she
could scarc ever rememb have felt afraidfor herself except
sometim of her father when he grew angryor wa it mad that he
grewand rage at her threaten her with punish in anoth world
in reward for her childish sin even then the sensat did not last
long becaus she could not believ in that punish which he so vividli
imagin so it came about that now she had no fear when there wa so much
caus
for thi place wa lone not a live creatur could be seen moreov
a dread hush brood on the face of earth and in the sky abov onli
far awai over the mountain the lightn flicker incessantli as though
a monster in the ski were lick their precipic and pinnacl with a
thousand tongu of fire noth stir not even an insect everi
creatur that drew breath had hidden itself awai until the come terror
wa overpast
the atmospher wa full of electr struggl to be free although she
knew not what it wa rachel felt it in her blood and brain in some
strang wai it affect her mind open window there through which the
ey of her soul look out she becam awar of some new influenc
draw near to her life of a sudden her bud womanhood burst into
flower in her breast shone on by an unseen sun she wa no more a child
her be quicken and acknowledg the kinship of all thing that ar
that brood flamethread skysh wa a part of it the earth she
trod it wa a part of her the mind that caus the star to roll and her
to live dwelt in her bosom and like a babe she nestl within the arm of
it almighti will
now as in a dream rachel descend the steep rockstrewn bank of the
dry branch of the riverb wend her wai between the boulder and
note that rotten weed and peel brushwood rest against the stem of
the mimosa thorn which grewther token which told her that here in
time of flood the water flow well there wa littl enough of it now
onli a pool or two to form a mirror for the lightn in front of her lai
the island where grew the cape gooseberri or winter cherri as thei
ar sometim call which she came to seek it wa a low piec of
ground a quarter of a mile long perhap but in the centr of it were
some great rock and grow among the rock tree on of them higher
than the rest beyond it ran the true river even now at the end of the
dry season three or four hundr yard in breadth though so shallow that
it could be ford by an oxdrawn waggon
it wa rain on the mountain yonder rain in torrent pour from
those inki cloud as it had done off and on for the past twentyfour
hour and abov their firelac bosom float gloriouscolour mass
of misti vapour enflam in a thousand hue by the arrow of the sink
sun abov her howev there wa no sun noth but the curtain of
cloud which grew gradual from grei to black and minut by minut sank
nearer to the earth
walk through the dry riverb rachel reach the island which wa the
last and highest of a line of similar island that separ from each
other by narrow breadth of water lai like a chain between the dry donga
and the river here she began to gather her gooseberri pick the
silveri octagon pod from the green stem on which thei grew at first
she open these pod remov from each the yellow subacid berri
think that thu her basket would hold more but present abandon
that plan as it took too much time also although the plant were
plenti enough in that low and curiou light it wa not easi to see
them among the dens growth of reedi veget
while she wa thu engag she becam awar of a low moan nois and a
stir of the air about her which caus the leav and grass to
quiver without bend then follow an icecold wind that grew in
strength until it blew keen and hard ruffl the surfac of the marshi
pool still rachel went on with her task for her basket wa not more
than half full till present the heaven abov her began to mutter and
to groan and drop of rain as larg as shill fell upon her back and
hand now she understood that it wa time for her to be go and
start to walk across the islandfor at the moment she wa near it
farther sideto reach the deep rocki riverb or donga
befor ever she came there with aw sudden and inconceiv furi
the tempest burst a hurrican of wind tore down the vallei to the sea
and for a few minut the dark becam so dens that she could scarc
stumbl forward then there wa light a dread light all the heaven
seem to take fire ye and the earth too it wa as though it last
dread catastroph had fallen on the world
buffet breathless rachel at length reach the edg of the deep
riverb that mai have been fifti yard in width and wa about to step
into it when she becam awar of two thing the first wa a seeth
roar nois so loud that it seem to still even the bellow of the
thunder and the next now seen now lost as the lightn puls and
darken the figur of a youth a white youth who had dismount from a
hors that remain near to but abov him and stood a gun in hi hand
upon a rock at the farther side of the donga
he had seen her also and wa shout to her of thi she wa sure for
although the sound of hi voic wa lost in the tumult she could perceiv
hi gesticul when the lightn flare and even the movement of hi
lip
wonder vagu what a white boi could be do in such a place and
veri glad at the prospect of hi compani rachel began to advanc toward
him in short rush whenev the lightn show her where to set her
feet she had made two of these rush when from the violenc and
charact of hi movement at length she understood that he wa try to
prevent her from come further and paus confus
anoth instant and she knew why some hundr of yard abov her the
river bed took a turn and suddenli round thi turn crest with foam
appear a wall of water in which tree and the carcas of anim were
whirl along like straw the flood had come down from the mountain and
wa advanc on her more swiftli than a hors could gallop rachel ran
forward a littl wai then understand that she had no time to cross
stood bewild for the fear tumult of the element and the dread
roar of that advanc wall of foam overwhelm her sens the
lightn went out for a moment then began to plai again with tenfold
frequenc and forc thei struck upon the near torrent thei struck in
the dry bed befor it and leapt upward from the earth as though titan
and god were hurl spear at on anoth
in the lurid sheen of them she saw the lad leap from hi rock and rush
toward her a flash fell and split a boulder not thirti pace from him
caus him to stagger but he recov himself and ran on now he wa
quit close but the water wa closer still it wa come in tier or
ledg a thin sheet of foam in front then other layer laid upon it
each of them a few yard behind it fellow on the top ledg in it veri
crest wa a bull buffalo dead but held head on and down as though it
were charg and rachel thought vagu that from the direct in which
it came in a few moment it horn would strike her anoth second and an
arm wa about her waistsh note how white it wa where the sleev wa
roll up dead white in the lightningand she wa be drag toward
the shore that she had left the first film of water struck her and nearli
wash her from her feet but she wa strong and activ and the touch of
that arm seem to have given her back her wit so she regain them and
splash forward now the next tier took them both abov the knee but
for a moment shallow so that thei did not fall the high bank wa scarc
five yard awai and the wall of water perhap a score
togeth for life or death said an english voic in her ear and the
shout of it onli reach her in a whisper
the boi and the girl leapt forward like buck thei reach the bank and
struggl up it the hungri water sprang at them like a live thing
grasp their feet and leg as though with hand a stick as it whirl
by them struck the lad upon the shoulder and where it struck the cloth
were rent awai and red blood appear almost he fell but thi time it
wa rachel who support him then on more struggl and thei roll
exhaust on the ground just clear of the lip of the race flood
thu through tempest threaten by the water of death from which he
snatch her and companion by heaven lightn did richard darrien
come into the life of rachel dove
present have recov their breath thei sat up and look at each
other by lightn light which wa all there wa he wa a handsom lad
of about seventeen though short for hi year sturdi in build veri
fairskin and curious enough with a singular resembl to rachel
except that hi hair wa a few shade darker than her thei had the same
clear grei ey and the same wellcut featur inde seen togeth
most peopl would have thought them brother and sister and remark upon
their famili like rachel spoke the first
who ar you she shout into hi ear in on of the interv of
dark and why did you come here
my name is richard darrien he answer at the top of hi voic and i
dont know why i came i suppos someth sent me to save you
ye she repli with convict someth sent you if you had not
come i should be dead shouldnt i in glori as my father sai
i dont know about glori or what it is he remark after think
thi sai over but you would have been roll out to sea in the flood
water like that buffalo with not a whole bone in you which isnt my

she nod mollifi
i think i know on come and she stretch out her hand
he took it and thu hand in hand thei made their wai to the highest point
of the island where the tree grew for here the rock pile up togeth
made a kind of cave in which rachel and her mother had sat for a littl
while when thei visit the place as thei grope their wai toward it the
lightn blaze out and thei saw a great jag flash strike the tallest
tree and shatter it caus some wild beast that had shelter there to
rush past them snort
that doesnt look veri safe said richard halt but come on it
isnt like to hit the same spot twice
hadnt you better leav your gun she suggest for all thi while that
weapon had been slung to hi back and she knew that lightn ha an
affin for iron
certainli not he answer it is a new on which my father gave me
and i wont be part from it
then thei went on and reach the littl cave just as the rain broke over
them in earnest as it chanc the place wa dry be so situat that
all water ran awai from it thei crouch in it shiver try to cover
themselv with dead stick and brushwood that had lodg here in the wet
season when the whole island wa under water
it would be nice enough if onli we had a fire said rachel her teeth
chatter as she spoke
the lad richard thought a while then he open a leather case that hung
on hi rifl sling and took from it a powder flask and flint and steel and
some tinder pour a littl powder on the damp tinder he struck the
flint until at length a spark caught and fire the powder the tinder
caught also though reluctantli and while rachel blew on it he felt
round for dead leav and littl stick some of which were coax into
flame
after thi thing were easi sinc fuel lai about in abund so that
soon thei had a splendid fire burn in the mouth of the cave whenc the
smoke escap now thei were abl to warm and dry themselv and as the
heat enter into their chill bodi their spirit rose inde the
contrast between thi snug hide place and blaze fire of drift wood and
the roar tempest without conduc to cheer in young peopl who
had just narrowli escap from drown
i am so hungri said rachel present
again richard began to search and thi time produc from the pocket of
hi coat a long and thick strip of sundri meat

of cours she answer eagerli
then you must cut it up he said give her the meat and hi knife my
arm hurt me i cant

he took off hi coat and knelt down while she stood over him and examin
hi wound by the light of the fire to find that the left upper arm wa
bruis torn and bleed as it will be rememb that rachel had no
handkerchief she ask richard for hi which she soak in a pool of
rain water just outsid the cave then have wash the hurt thoroughli
she bandag hi arm with the handkerchief and bade him put on hi coat

wound
my father alwai doctor the kaffir and i help him rachel answer
as have stretch out her hand for the pour rain to wash them she
took the biltong and began to cut it in thin slice
these she made him eat befor she touch ani herself for she saw that
the loss of blood had weaken him inde her own meal wa a light on
sinc half the strip of meat must she declar be put asid in case thei
should not be abl to get off the island then he saw why she had made him
eat first and wa veri angri with himself and her but she onli laugh at
him and answer that she had learn from the kaffir that men must be
fed befor women as thei were more import in the world
you mean more selfish he answer contempl thi wise littl maid
and her tini portion of biltong which she swallow veri slowli perhap
to pretend that her appetit wa alreadi satisfi with it
superabund then he fell to implor her to take the rest sai
that he would be abl to shoot some game in the morn but she onli
shook her littl head and set her lip obstin
ar you a hunter she ask to chang the subject

roar at night
then he went on while i wa stare at you run across thi
island i heard the sound of the water and saw it rush down the donga
and saw too that you must be drown andyou know the rest

just then the tempest which had lull a littl came on again in furi
accompani by a hurrican of wind and delug of rain through which the
lightn blaze incessantli the thunderclap too were so loud and
constant that the sound of them which shook the earth made it imposs
for richard and rachel to hear each other speak so thei were silent
perforc onli richard rose and look out of the cave then turn and
beckon to hi companion she came to him and watch till suddenli a
blind sheet of flame lit up the whole landscap then she saw what he
wa look at for now nearli all the island except that high part of it
on which thei stood wa under water hidden by a brown seeth torrent
that tore past them to the sea
if it rise much more we shall be drown he shout in her ear
she nod then cri back
let us sai our prayer and get readi for it seem to rachel that the
glori of which her father spoke so often wa nearer to them than ever
then she drew him back into the cave and motion to him to kneel besid
her which he did bashfulli enough and for a while the two children for
thei were littl more remain thu with clasp hand and move lip
present the thunder lessen a littl so that onc more thei could hear
each other speak

i prai that you might escap and that my mother might not griev for
me too much she answer simpli and you
i oh the samethat you might escap i did not prai for my mother as
she is dead and i forgot about father
look look exclaim rachel point to the mouth of the cave
he stare out at the dark and there through the thin flame of the
fire saw two great yellow shape which appear to be walk up and down
and glare into the cave
lion he gasp snatch at hi gun
dont shoot she cri you might make them angri perhap thei onli
want to take refug like ourselv the fire will keep them awai
he nod then rememb that the charg and prime of hi flintlock
roer must be damp hurriedli set to work by the help of rachel to draw
it with the screw on the end of hi ramrod and thi done to reload with
some powder that he had alreadi place to dry on a flat stone near the
fire thi oper took five minut or more when at length it wa
finish and the lock reprim with the dry powder the two of them
richard hold the roer crept to the mouth of the cave and look out
again
the great storm wa pass now and the rain grew thinner but from time
to time the lightn no longer fork or chainshap flare in wide
sheet by it ghastli illumin thei saw a strang sight there on the
island top the two lion march backward and forward as though thei
were in a cage make a kind of whimper nois as thei went and
stare round them uneasili moreov these were not alon for gather
there were variou other anim driven down by the flood from the
island abov them reed and water buck and a great eland among these
the lion walk without make the slightest effort to attack them nor
did the antelop which stood snif and stare at the torrent take
ani notic of the lion or attempt to escap
you ar right said richard thei ar all frighten and will not harm
us unless the water rise more and thei rush into the cave come make
up the fire
thei did so and sat down on it further side watch till as noth
happen their dread of the lion pass awai and thei began to talk
again tell to each other the stori of their live
richard darrien it seem had been in africa about five year hi
father have emigr there on the death of hi mother as he had

that he should find out what their own particular lion were do so
richard went to look and report that the storm had ceas and that by
the moonlight he could see no lion or ani other anim so he thought
that thei must have gone awai somewher the flood water also appear to
be run down comfort by thi intellig rachel pile on the fire

chapter iii
goodby
rachel wa the first to wake which she did feel cold for the fire
had burnt almost out she rose and walk from the cave the dawn wa
break quietli for now no wind stir and no rain fell so dens wa
the mist which rose from the river and sodden land howev that she
could not see two yard in front of her and fear lest she should
stumbl on the lion or some other anim she did not dare to wander far
from the mouth of the cave near to it wa a larg hollowsurfac rock
fill now with water like a bath from thi she drank then wash and
tidi herself as well as she could without the aid of soap comb or
towel which done she return to the cave
as richard wa still sleep veri quietli she laid a littl more wood on
the ember to keep him warm then sat down by hi side and watch him
for now the grei light of the dawn crept into their place of refug to
her thi slumber lad look beauti and as she studi him her
childish heart wa fill with a strang new tender such as she had
never felt befor somehow he had grown dear to her and rachel knew that
she would never forget him while she live then follow thi wave of
affect came a sharp and sudden pain for she rememb that present
thei must part and never see each other ani more at least thi seem
certain for how could thei when he wa travel to the cape and she to
natal
and yet and yet a strang convict told her otherwis the power of
prescienc which came to her from her mother and her highland forefath
awok in her breast and she knew that her life and thi lad life were
interwoven perhap she doze off again sit there by the fire at ani
rate it appear to her that she dream and saw thing in her dream wild
tumultu scene open themselv befor her in a vision scene of
blood and terror sound too of voic cry war it appear to her as
if she were mad and yet rule a queen death came near to her a score of
time but alwai fled awai at her command now richard darrien wa with
her and how she had lost him and soughtah how she sought through dark
place of doom and unnatur night it wa as though he were dead and she
yet live search for him among the habit of the dead she found
him also and drew him toward her how she did not know
then there wa a scene a last scene which remain fix in her mind
after everyth els had fade awai she saw the huge trunk of forest
tree enorm tower tree gloomi tree beneath which the dark
could be felt down their avenu shot the level arrow of the dawn thei
fell on her rachel dress in robe of white skin turn her long
outspread hair to gold thei fell upon littl peopl with face of a duski
pallor on of them crouch against the bole of a tree a wizen monkei
of a man who in all that vast look small thei fell upon anoth
man whiteskin halfnak with a yellow beard who wa lash by
hide rope to a second tree it wa richard darrien grown older and at
hi feet lai a broadblad spear
the vision left her or she wa awaken from her sleep whichev it
might be by the pleasant voic of thi same richard who stood yawn
befor her and said

head drip and whisper
give me the gun there is a reed buck stand close by i saw it through
the mist well have a jolli breakfast off him
she hand him the roer and crept after him out of the cave about
thirti yard awai to the right loom veri larg through the dens fog
stood the fat reed buck richard wriggl toward it for he want to
make sure of hi shot while rachel crouch behind a stone the buck
becom alarm turn it head and began to sniff at the air whereon
he lift the gun and just as it wa about to spring awai aim and
fire down it went dead whereon rejoic in hi triumph like ani other
young hunter who think not of the wonder and happi life that he ha
destroi richard sprang upon it exultantli draw hi knife as he
came while rachel who alwai shrank from such sight retreat to the
cave half an hour later howev be healthi and hungri she had no
object to eat venison toast upon stick in the red ember of their
fire
their meal finish at length thei reload the gun and although the
mist wa still veri dens set out upon a journei of explor as by
now the sun wa shine brightli abov the curtain of lowli vapour
stumbl on through the rock thei discov that the water had fallen
almost as quickli as it rose on the previou night the island wa strewn
howev with the trunk of tree and other debri that it had brought
down amongst which lai the carcas of buck and smaller creatur and
with them a number of drown snake the two lion howev appear to
have escap by swim at least thei saw noth of them walk
cautious thei came to the edg of the donga and sat down upon a stone
sinc as yet thei could not see how wide and deep the water ran
whilst thei remain thu suddenli through the mist thei heard a voic
shout from the other side of the donga
missi cri the voic in dutch ar you there missi

again richard look at her and saw that her sweet grei ey were full of
tear then there rose within the breast of thi lad who be it
rememb wa verg upon manhood a sensat strang similar had

thi feel wa certainli veri new and queer
what have you done to me he ask brusqu i dont want to go awai

these last word came out with a gulp and what is more two tear came
with them and trickl down hi nose
for a moment thei sat thu look at each other pitifulli andth truth

richard let us call it primev instinct so that he put hi arm about
rachel and kiss her after which thei continu to weep their head
rest upon each other shoulder at length he let her go and stood up
sai argument

lack of a pocket handkerchief in the fashion that on the previou dai had
so irrit her father but i dont know why you should kiss me like

truth why i should kiss you
richard stood over her frown and reflect then he gave up the
problem as beyond hi power of interpret and said

tree and the rest of it well it wasnt nice and it give me the creep
to think of it like the lion outsid the cave but i want to tell you

but goodmorn
as rachel spoke a puff of wind blew down the donga roll up the mist
befor it and of a sudden shine abov them thei saw the gloriou sun
as though by magic butterfli appear bask upon the rainshatt
lili bloom bright bird flit from tree to tree ringdov began to
coo the terror of the tempest and the dark of night were overpast
the world awok again to life and love and joi instantli thi chang
reflect itself in their young heart thei whose natur had as it were
ripen prematur in the stress of danger and the shadow of death
becam children onc again the veri real emot that thei had
experienc were forgotten or at ani rate sank into abey now thei
thought not of separ or of the dim mysteri futur that stretch
befor them but onli of how thei should ford the stream and gain it
further side where rachel saw her father tom the driver and the other
kaffir and richard saw hi hors which he had fear wa lost
thei ran down to the brink of the water and examin it but here it wa
still too deep for them to attempt it cross then direct by the
shout and motion of the kaffir tom and mr dove thei proceed up
stream for sever hundr yard till thei came to a rapid where the
lessen flood ran thinli over a ridg of rock and after investig
proceed to try it passag hand in hand it prove difficult but not
danger for when thei came near to the further side where the current
wa swift and the water rather deep tom threw them a waggon rope
cling on to which thei were draggedwet but laughingin safeti to
the further bank

chapter iv
ishmael
it mai he doubt whether ani wellborn young english ladi ever had a
stranger bringingup than that which fell to the lot of rachel dove to
begin with she had absolut no associ male or femal of her own
ag and station for at that period in it histori such peopl did not
exist in the countri where she dwelt practic her onli companion were
her father a religi enthusiast and her mother a half brokenheart
woman who never for a singl hour could forget the children she had lost
and whose constitut mystic increas upon her continu until at
time it seem as though she had ad some new qualiti to her normal
human natur
then there were the nativ amongst whom from the begin rachel wa a
sort of queen in those first dai of settlement thei had never seen
anybodi in the least like her no on so beautifulfor she grew up
beautifulso fearless or so kind the tale of that adventur of her as
a child upon the island in the midst of the flood torrent spread all
through the countri with mani fabul addit thu the kaffir said
that she wa a heavenherd that is a magic person who can ward off
or direct the lightn which she wa suppos to have done upon thi
night also that she could walk upon the water for otherwis how did she
escap the flood and lastli that the wild beast were her servant for
had not the driver tom and the nativ seen the spoor of great lion right
at the mouth of the cave where she and her companion shelter and had
thei not heard that she call these lion into the cave to protect her
and him from the other creatur therefor as ha been said thei gave
her a name a veri long name that meant chieftai or ladi of heaven
inkosazanayzoola for zulu or zoola which we know as the titl of
that peopl mean heaven and udadeysilwana or sister of wild
beast as these appel prove too lengthi for gener us even
among the bantu race who have plenti of time for talk ultim it
wa shorten to zoola alon so that throughout that part of
southeastern africa rachel came to enjoi the lofti titl of heaven the
first girl probabl who wa ever so call
with all nativ from her childhood up rachel wa on the best of term
she wa never familiar with them inde for that is not the wai for a
white person to win the affect or even the respect of a kaffir but
she wa intim in the sens that she could enter into their thought and
natur a veri rare gift we white ar apt to consid ourselv the
superior of such folk wherea we ar onli differ in fact taken
altogeth it is quit a question whether the higher section of the
bantu peopl ar not our equal of cours we have learn more thing
and our best men ar their better but on the other hand among them
there is noth so low as the inhabit of our slum nor have thei ani
vice which can surpass our vice is an assegai so much more savag than
a shell is there ani great gulf fix between a chaka and a napoleon at
least thei ar not hypocrit and thei ar not vulgar that is the
privileg of civilis nation
well with these folk rachel wa intim she could talk to the warrior
of hi war to the woman of her garden and her children to the children
of that wonder world which surround childhood throughout the univers
and yet there wa never a on of these but lift the hand to her in
salut when her shadow fell upon them to them all she wa the inkosazana
the great ladi thei would laugh at her father and mimic him behind hi
back but rachel thei never laugh at or mimick of her mother also
although she kept herself apart from them much the same mai be said for
her thei had a curiou name which thei would not or were unabl to
explain thei call her flowerthatgrowsonagrav for mr dove
their appel wa less poetic it wa
shouteraboutthingshedoesnotunderstand or more briefli the
shouter a name that he had acquir from hi habit of rais hi voic
when he grew move in speak to them the thing that he did not
understand it mai be explain were not to their mind hi religi
view which although thei consid them remark were evid hi
own affair but their privat custom especi their famili custom
that he wa never weari of denounc to the bewilder of these poor
heathen who for their part were not greatli impress by those of the
few white peopl with whom thei came in contact therefor with nativ
polit thei conclud that he spoke thu rude becaus he did not
understand henc hi name
but rachel had other friend in truth she wa natur child if in a
better and a purer sens than byron us that descript the sea the
veld the sky the forest and the river these were her companion for
among them she dwelt solitari their denizen too knew her well for
unless she were driven to it never would she lift her hand against
anyth that drew the breath of life the buck would let her pass quit
close to them nor at her come did the bird stir from off their tree
often she stood and watch the great eleph feed or at rest and
even dare to wander among the herd of savag buffalo of onli two live
thing wa she afraidth snake and the crocodil that ar curs abov
all cattl and abov everi beast of the field becaus be curs thei
have no sympathi or gentl she fear noth els she who wa
alwai fearless nor brute or bird did thei fear her
after rachel adventur in the flood river she and her parent pursu
their journei by slow and tediou march and at length though in those
dai thi wa strang enough reach natal unharm at first thei went
to live where the citi of durban now stand which at that time had but
just receiv it name it wa inhabit by a few rough men who made a
live by trade and hunt and surround themselv with nativ
refuge for the most part from the zulu countri amongst these peopl and
their servant mr dove commenc hi labour but er long a bitter
quarrel grew up between him and them
these dweller in the midst of barbar led strang live and mr dove
who rightli held it to be hi duti to denounc wrongdo of everi sort
attack them and their vice in no measur term and upon all
occas for long year he kept up the fight until at length he found
himself ostracis if thei could avoid it no white men would speak to
him nor would thei allow him to instruct their kaffir thu hi work
came to an end in durban as it had done in other place now again hi
wife and daughter hope that he would leav south africa for good and
return home but it wa not to be for onc more he announc that it wa
laid upon him to follow the exampl of hi divin master and that the
spirit drove him into the wilder so with a few attend thei
trek awai from durban
on thi occas it wa hi wild design to settl in zululandwher
chaka the great king be dead dingaan hi brother and murder
rule in hi placeand there devot himself to the convers of the
zulu inde it is probabl that he would have carri out thi plan had
he not been prevent by an accid on night when thei were about forti
mile from durban thei camp on a stream a tributari of the tugela
river which ran close by and form the boundari of the zulu countri it
wa a singularli beauti spot for to the east of them about a mile
awai stretch the placid indian ocean while to the west overshadow
them almost rose a tower cliff over which the stream pour itself
look like a line of smoke against it rocki face thei had outspan
upon a rise hillock at the foot of which thi littl river wound awai
like a silver snake till it join the great tugela in it gener aspect
the countri wa like an english park dot here and there with timber
around which graze or rest great eland and other buck and amongst
them a huge rhinocero
when the waggon had creak to the top of the rise for of cours there
wa no road and the kaffir were begin to unyok the hungri oxen
rachel who wa ride with her father sprang from her hors and ran to
it to help her mother to descend she wa now a tall young woman full of
health and vigour strong and straightli shape mr dove frail
delic greyhair place her foot upon the disselboom and hesit
for to her the ground seem far off and the heel of the cattl veri
near

afterox to make it turn round which it did obedi for all the team
knew her ill catch you
but her mother still hesit so thrust her wai between the ox and
the front wheel rachel stretch out her arm and lift her bodili to the
ground

admir and a sad littl smile it seem strang to think that i ever

waggon and she led her quit to the top of the knoll there she
ad isnt the view love i never saw such a pretti place in all
africa and oh look at those buck and yesthat is a rhinocero i hope
it wont charg us
mr dove obei gaze first at the gloriou sea then at the plain and
the tree and lastli behind her at the tower cliff steep in
shadowfor the sun wa westeringdown the face of which the waterfal
seem to hang like a silver rope

voic as though she did not wish to learn what her mother thought i
dont mind i am sure i dont want to go to zululand and see thi horrid
dingaan who is alwai kill peopl and i am quit sure that father
would never convert him the wick monster it is like the garden of
eden isnt it with the sea thrown in there ar all the anim and
that green tree with the fruit on it might be the tree of life andoh
my good there is adam
mr dove follow the line of her daughter outstretch hand and
perceiv three or four hundr yard awai as in that sparkl
atmospher it wa easi to do a white man appar clad in skin he wa
engag in crawl up a littl rise of ground with the obviou intent
of shoot at some blesbuck which stood in a hollow beyond with quagga
and other anim while behind him wa a mount kaffir who held hi
master hors
i see said mr dove mildli interest but he look more like
robinson cruso without hi umbrella adam did not kill the anim in the
garden my dear
he must have live on someth besid forbidden appl remark
rachel unless perhap he wa a vegetarian as father want to be
thereh ha fire
as she spoke a cloud of smoke aros abov the man and present the loud
report of a roer reach their ear on of the buck roll over and lai
struggl on the ground while the rest togeth with mani other at a
distanc turn and gallop off thi wai and that frighten by thi
new and terribl nois the old rhinocero under the tree rose snort
snif the air then thunder awai up wind toward the man it piglik
tail held straight abov it back
adam ha spoilt our eden i hope the rhinocero will catch him said
rachel vicious look he ha seen it and is run to hi hors
rachel wa right adamor whatev hi name might bewa run with
remark swift reach the hors just as the rhinocero appear
within forti yard of him he bound to the saddl and with hi servant
gallop off to the right the rhinocero came to a standstil for a few
moment as though it were wonder whether it dare attack these strang
creatur then make up it mind in the neg rush on and
vanish when it wa gone the white man and the kaffir who had pull
up their hors at a distanc return to the fallen buck cut it
throat and lift it on to the kaffir hors then rode slowli toward
the waggon
thei ar come to call said rachel how should on receiv a
gentleman in skin
appar some misgiv as to the effect that might be produc by hi
appear occur to the hunter at ani rate he look first at the two
white women stand on the brow and next at hi own peculiar attir
which appear to consist chiefli of the pelt of a lion plu a veri
strike pair of trouser manufactur from the hide of a zebra and
halt about sixti yard awai stare at them rachel whose sight wa
exceedingli keen could see hi face well for the light of the set
sun fell on it and he wore no head cover it wa a dark handsom face
of a man about thirtyf year of ag with stronglymark featur
black ey and beard and long black hair that fell down on to hi
shoulder thei gaze at each other for a while then the man turn to
hi afterrid gave him an order in a clear strong voic and rode awai
inland the afterrid on the contrari direct hi hors up the rise
until he wa within a few yard of them then sprang to the ground and
salut
what is it ask rachel in zulu a languag which she now spoke
perfectli
inkosikaa that isladi answer the man my master think that you
mai be hungri and send you a present of thi buck and as he spoke he
loos the riem or hide rope by which it wa fasten behind hi saddl
and let the anim fall to the ground
rachel turn her ey from it for it wa cover with blood and
unpleas to look at then repli
my father and my mother thank your master how is he name and where
doe he dwell
ladi among us black peopl he is name ibubesi lion but hi white
name is hishmel
hishmel hishmel said rachel oh i know he mean ishmael there
mother i told you he wa someth biblic and of cours ishmael dwelt
in the wilder didnt he after hi father had behav so badli to
poor hagar and wa a wild man whose hand wa against everi man
rachel rachel said her mother suppress a littl smile your father
would be veri angri if he heard you you should not speak lightli of holi
person
well mother abraham mai have been a holi person but we should think
him a mean old thing nowadai almost as mean as sarah you know thei were
most of them mean so what is the us of pretend thei were not
then without wait for an answer she ask the kaffir again where doe
the inkoo ishmael dwell
in the wilder answer the man appropri now hi kraal is
yonder two hour ride awai it is call mafooti and he point over
the top of the precipic ad he is a hunter and trade with the
zulu
is he dutch ask rachel whose curios wa excit
the kaffir shook hi head no he hate the dutch he is of the peopl of
georg
the peopl of georg why he must mean a subject of king georgean
englishman
ye ye ladi an englishman like you and he grin at her have
you ani messag for the inkoo hishmel
ye sai to the inkoo ishmael or lionwhodwellsinthewild
hate the dutch and wear zebraskin trouser that my father and my
mother thank him veri much for hi present and hope that hi health is
good go that is all
the man grin again suspect a joke for the zulu have a sens of
humour then repeat the messag word for word try to pronounc
ishmael as rachel did salut mount hi hors and gallop off after
hi master
perhap you should have kept that kaffir until your father came
suggest mr dove doubtfulli
what wa the good said rachel he would onli have ask mr ishmael to
call in order that he might find out hi religi opinion and i dont
want to see ani more of the man
why not rachel
becaus i dont like him mother i think he is wors than ani of the
rest down there too bad to stop among them probabl and she ad
with convict i think we shall have more of hi compani than we want
befor all is done oh it is no good to sai that i am prejudicedi do
and what is more he came into our garden of eden and shot the buck i
hope he will meet that rhinocero on the wai home there
although she disapprov or tri to think that she did of such strong
opinion so strongli express mr dove offer no further opposit to
them the fact wa that her daughter bodili and mental vigour
overshadow her as thei did her husband also inde it seem curiou
that thi girl so power in bodi and in mind should have sprung from
such a pair a wronghead narrowview saint whose right place in the
world would have been in a cell in the monasteri or on of the stricter
order and a gentl uncomplain highbr woman with a mind
distinguish by it affection and mystic natur a mind so unusu
and refin that it seem to be and in truth wa open to influenc
whereof mercifulli enough the major of us never feel the subtl
secret power
of her father there wa absolut no trace in rachel except a certain
physic resemblanceso far as he wa concern she must have thrown back
to some earlier progenitor even their intellect and moral outlook were
quit differ she had it is true someth of hi scholarli power
thu notwithstand her wild upbring as ha been said she could
read the greek testament almost as well as he could or even homer which
she like becaus the old bloodthirsti hero remind her of the zulu
he had taught her thi and other knowledg and she wa an apt pupil but
there the resembl stop wherea hi intellig wa narrow and
enslav by the priestli tradit her wa wide and human she search
and she criticis she believ in god as he did but she saw hi purpos
work in the evil as in the good in her own thought she often compar
these forc to the dai and night and believ both of them to be
necessari to the human world for her savageri had virtu as well as
civilis although it is true of the latter she knew but littl
from her mother rachel had inherit more for instanc her grace of
speech and bear and her intuit or foresight onli in her case thi
curiou gift did not domin her her other forc held it in check she
felt and she knew but feel and knowledg did not frighten or make her
weak ani more than the strength of her frame or of her spirit made her
unwomanli she accept these thing as part of her mental equip that
wa all be awar that to her a door wa open which is shut firmli
enough in the face of most folk but not on that account in the least
afraid of look through it as her mother wa
thu when she saw the man call ishmael she knew well enough that he wa
destin to bring great evil upon her and her as when as a child she met
the boi richard darrien she had known other thing but she did not
therefor fear the man and hi attend evil she onli shrank from the
first and look through the second onward and outward to the ultim
good which she wa convinc lai at the end of everyth and meanwhil
be young and merri she found hi zebraskin trouser veri ridicul
just as rachel and her mother finish their convers about mr
ishmael mr dove arriv from a littl kloof where he had been engag
with the kaffir in cut bush to make a thorn fenc round their camp
as a protect against lion and hyena he look older than when we
last met him and save for a fring of white hair which increas hi
monkish appear wa quit bald hi face too wa even thinner and
more eager and hi grei ey were more farawai than formerli also he
had grown a long white beard
where did that buck come from he ask look at the dead creatur
rachel told him the stori with the result that as her mother had
expect he wa veri indign with her it wa most unkind and inde
unchristian he said not to have ask thi veri courteou gentleman
into the camp as he would much have like to convers with him he had
often reprov her habit of judg by extern and in the veld lion and
zebra skin furnish a veri suitabl cover she should rememb that
such were given to our first parent
oh i know father broke in rachel when the climat grew too cold for
leaf petticoat and the rest now dont begin to scold me becaus i must
go to cook the dinner i didnt like the look of the man besid he rode
off then it wasnt my busi to ask him here but mother who stood
stare at him and never said a singl word if you want to see him so
much you can go to call upon him tomorrow onli dont take me pleas
and now will you send tom to skin the buck
mr dove answer that tom wa busi with the fenc and ceas from
argument which he felt to be useless with rachel suggest doubtfulli
that he had better be hi own butcher
no no she repli you know you hate that sort of thing as i do let
it be till the kaffir have time we have the cold meat left for supper
and i will boil some meali go and help with the fenc father while i
light the fire
usual rachel wa the best of sleeper so soon as she laid her head upon
whatev happen to serv her for a pillow gener a saddl her ey
shut to open no more till daylight came on thi night howev it wa
not so she had her bed in a littl flap tent which hook on to the side
of the waggon that wa occupi by her parent here she lai wide awak
for a long while listen to the kaffir who have partaken heartili
of the buck were now make themselv drunk by smoke dakka or
indian hemp a habit of which mr dove had tri in vain to break them at
length the fire around which thei sat near the thorn fenc on the further
side of the waggon grew low and their incoher talk end in silenc
punctuat by snore rachel began to dose but wa awaken by the
laugh cri of the hyena quit close to her the brute had scent
the dead buck and were wander round the fenc in hope of a midnight
meal rachel rose and take the gun that lai at her side threw a cloak
over her shoulder and left the tent
the moon wa shine brightli and by it light she saw the hyena two of
them wolv as thei ar call in south africa long grei creatur that
prowl round the thorn fenc hungrili caus the oxen that were ti to
the trek tow and the hors picket on the other side of the waggon to
low and whinni in an uneasi fashion the hyena saw her also for her head
rose abov the rough fenc and be cowardli beast slunk awai she
could have shot them had she chose but did not first becaus she hate
kill anyth unnecessarili even a wolf and secondli becaus it would
have arous the camp so she content herself by throw more dry wood
on to the fire step over the kaffir who slept like log in order
to do so then rest upon her gun like some amazon on guard she gaze
a while at the love moonlit sea and the long line of game trek
silent to their drink place until see no more of the wolv or
other danger beast she turn and sought her bed again
she wa think of mr ishmael and hi zebraskin trouser wonder why
the man should have fill her with such an unreason dislik if she
had dislik him at a distanc of fifti pace how she would hate him when
he wa near and yet he wa probabl onli on of those broken soldier of
fortun of whom she had met sever who took to the wilder as a last
resourc and by degre sank to the level of the savag among whom thei
live a person who wa not worth a second thought so she tri to put
him from her mind and by wai of an antidot sinc still she could not
sleep fill it with her recollect of richard darrien some year had
gone by sinc thei had met and from that time to thi she had never heard
a word of him in which she could put the slightest faith she did not even
know whether he were aliv or dead onli she believ that if he were dead
she would be awar of it no she had never heard of him and it seem
probabl that she never would hear of him again yet she did not believ
that either had she done so her happinessfor on the whole rachel wa a
happi girlwould have depart from her sinc thi onc seen lad never
left her heart nor had she forgotten their farewel kiss
reflect thu at length rachel fell off to sleep and began to dream
still of richard darrien it wa a long dream whereof afterward she could
rememb but littl but in it there were shout and black face and
the flash of spear also the white man ishmael wa present there on
part howev she did rememb richard darrien grown taller chang
and yet the same lean over her warn her of danger to come warn
her against thi man ishmael
she awok suddenli to see that the light of dawn wa creep into her
tent that low soft light which is so beauti in southern africa
rachel wa disturb she felt the need of action of anyth that would
chang the current of her thought no on wa about yet what should she
do she knew the sea wa not more than a mile awai she would go down to
it and bath and be back befor the rest of them were awak
chapter v
noie
that a girl should set out alon to bath through a countri inhabit
chiefli by wild beast and a few wander savag sound a somewhat
danger form of amus so it wa inde but rachel care noth
for such danger in fact she never even thought of them long ago she had
discov that the anim would not harm her if she did not harm them
except perhap the rhinocero which is given to charg on sight and
that wa larg and could gener be discov at a distanc as for
eleph and lion or even buffalo her experi wa that thei ran
awai except on rare occas when thei stood still and stare at her
nor wa she afraid of the savag who alwai treat her with the utmost
respect even if thei had never seen her befor still in case of
accid she took her doublebarrel gun load in on barrel with
ball and in the other with looper or slug and awaken tom the
driver to tell him where she wa go the man stare at her sleepili
and murmur a remonstr but take no heed of him she pull out some
thorn from the fenc to make a passag and in anoth minut wa lost to
sight in the morn mist
follow a game path through the dewdrench grass which grew upon the
swell and vallei of the veld and pass mani small buck upon her wai
in about twenti minut just as the light wa realli begin to grow
rachel reach the sea it wa dead calm and the tide chanc to be out
soon she found the veri place she soughta larg rockbound pool where
there would be no fear of shark that never stai in such a spot fear
lest thei should be strand slip off her cloth she plung into
the cool and crystal water and began to swim round and across the pool
for at thi art she wa expert dive and plai like a seanymph her
bath done she dri herself with a towel she had brought all except her
long fair hair which she let loos for the wind to blow on and have
dress stood a while wait to see the glori of the sun rise from the
ocean
whilst she remain thu suddenli she heard the sound of hors gallop
toward her two of them she could tell that from the hoof beat although
the lowli mist made them invis a few more second and thei
emerg out of the fog the first thing that she saw were stripe which
caus her to laugh think that she had mistaken zebra for hors
then the laugh di on her lip as she recognis that the stripe were
those of mr ishmael trouser ye there wa no doubt about it mr
ishmael wear a rough coat instead of hi lionskin but with the rest
of hi attir unchang wa gallop down upon her furious lead a
riderless hors rememb her wet and dishevel hair rachel threw
the towel over it whenc it hung like an old egyptian headdress set
her beauti face in a most becom frame next she pick up the
doublebarrel gun and cock it for she misdoubt her of thi man
intent not mani modern book came her wai but she had read stori
of young women who were carri off by forc
for an instanc she wa frighten but as she lift the hammer of the
second barrel her constitut courag return
let him try it she thought to herself if he had come ten minut ago
it would have been aw but now i dont care
by thi time mr ishmael had arriv and wa drag hi hors to it
haunch also she saw that evid he wa much more frighten than she
had been the man handsom face wa quit white and hi lip were
trembl perhap that rhinocero is after him again thought rachel

then without more word thei began to gallop back toward the camp
befor thei reach the crest of the second rise the sun shone out in
earnest thin the seaward mist although between them and the camp it
still hung thick then suddenli in the fogedg rachel saw thi sight
toward them ran a delic shape and beauti nativ girl nake

the other alreadi crop grass
my god what have you done exclaim ishmael
justic answer rachel
then your blood be on your own head i am not go to stop here to have
my throat cut

look after my own blood
to thi speech the white man seem to be abl to find no answer turn
hi hors he gallop off swear but not toward the camp whereon the
other hors gallop after him and present thei all vanish in the
mist leav the two women alon
at thi moment from the direct of the waggon thei heard the sound of
shout and of scream which appear to come from the vallei between
them and it
the king men ar kill my peopl mutter the girl noie go or
thei will kill you too
rachel thought a moment evid it wa imposs to get through to the
camp inde even had thei tri to do so on the hors thei would have
been cut off an idea came to her thei stood upon the edg of a steep
bushcloth kloof where in the wet season a stream ran down to the sea
thi stream wa now repres by a chain of deep and muddi pool on of
which pool lai directli underneath them
help me to throw him into the water said rachel
the girl understood and with desper energi thei seiz the dead
soldier drag him to the edg of the littl cliff and thrust him over
he fell with a heavi splash into the pool and vanish
crocodil live there said rachel i saw on as i pass now take the
shield and spear and follow me
she obei for with hope her strength seem to have return to her
and the two of them scrambl down the cliff into the kloof as thei
reach the edg of the pool thei saw great snout and a disturb in
the water rachel wa right crocodil live there
now she said throw your moocha on that rock thei will find it and
think
noie nod and did so rend it fasten and wet it in the water
then quit nake she took rachel hand and swiftli swiftli the two of
them leapt from stone to stone so as to leav no footprint head for
the sea onli the fugit stop onc to drink of the fresh water for
she wa perish with thirst now when rachel wa bath she had
observ upon the farther side of her pool and open out of it as it
were a littl pocket in the rock where the water wa not more than three
feet deep and cover by a dens growth of beauti seawe some black
and some ribbonlik and yellow the pool wa long perhap two hundr
pace in all and to go round it thei would be oblig to expos
themselv upon the sand and thu becom visibl from a long wai off
can you swim said rachel to noie
again she nod and the two of them slip into the water and swam
across the pool till thei reach the pocketlik place on the edg of
which thei sat down cover themselv with the seawe
thei had not been there five minut when thei heard the sound of voic
draw near down the kloof and at onc slid into the water cover
themselv in it in such fashion that onli their head remain abov the
surfac mix with the black and yellow seawe so that without close
search none could have said which wa hair and which wa weed
the zulu said noie shiver so that the water shook about her thei
seek me
lie still then answer rachel i cant shoot now the gun is wet
the voic di awai and the two girl thought that the speaker had
gone but render cautiou still remain hidden in the water it wa
well for them that thei did so for present thei heard the voic again
and much nearer the zulu were walk round the pool two of them came
quit close to their littl hidingplac and sat down on some rock to
rest and talk peep through her cover of seawe rachel could see
them great men who held red spear in their hand
you ar a fool said on of them to the other and have given us thi
walk for noth as though our feet were not sore enough alreadi the
crocodil have that noie her witchcraft could not save her from them it
wa a baboon spoor you saw in the mud not a woman
it would seem so brother answer the other as we found the moocha
still if so where is bomba who wa run her down and what made that
bloodmark on the grass
doubtless repli the first man bomba came up with her there and
wound her whereon be a woman and a coward she ran from him and
jump into the pool in which the crocodil finish her as for bomba i
expect that he ha gone back to zululand or is asleep somewher rest
the other spoor we saw wa that of a white woman who put skin upon her
feet there is a camp of them up yonder but you rememb our order were
not to touch ani of the peopl of georg so we need not troubl about
them
well brother if you ar sure we had better be start back lest
there should be troubl with the white peopl dingaan will be satisfi
when we show him the moocha and sleep in peac henceforth she must
realli have been tagati uncanni that littl noie for otherwis
although it is true she wa pretti why should dingaan who ha all
zululand to choos from have fallen in love with her and why should she
have refus to enter hi hous and persuad all her kraal to run awai
for my part i dont believ that she is dead now notwithstand the
moocha i think that she is a witch and ha chang into someth
elsea bird or a snake perhap well the rest of them will never chang
into anyth except black mould let us see we have kill everi on
all the common peopl the mother of noie the dwarfwizard seyapi her
father and her other mother four of them and her brother and sister
twelv in all
at these word noie again trembl beneath her seawe so that the water
shook all about her
there is a fish there said the first kaffir i saw it rise it is a
small pool shall we try to catch it
no brother answer the other onli coast peopl eat fish i am
hungri but i will wait for man food take that fish and he threw a
stone into the pool which struck rachel on the side and caus her fair
hair to float about among the yellow seawe
then the two of them got up and went awai walk arminarm like friend
and amiabl men as thei were in their own fashion
for a long time the girl remain beneath their seawe fear lest the
men or other should return until at length thei could bear the cold of
the water no longer and crept out of it to the brink of the littl pool
where still wreath in seawe thei sat and warm themselv in the
hot sunlight now noie seem to be half dead inde rachel thought that
she would die
awak she said life is still befor you
would that it were behind me ladi moan the poor girl you
understand our tonguedid you not hear my father my own mother my
other mother my brother and sister all kill all kill for my
sake and i left live oh you meant kindli but why did you not let
bomba pass hi spear through me it would have been quickli over and now
i should sleep with the rest
rachel made no answer for she saw that talk wa useless in such a
case onli she took noi hand and press it in silent sympathi until
at length the poor girl utterli outworn with agoni and the fatigu of her
long flight fell asleep there in the sunshin rachel let her sleep
know that she would take no harm in that warmth quietli she sat at her
side for hour after hour while the fierc sun from which she protect
her head with seawe dri her garment at length the shadow told her
that middai wa past and the sea water which began to trickl over the
surround rock that the tide wa approach it full thei could stop
there no longer unless thei wish to be drown
come she said to noie the zulu have gone and the sea is here we
must swim to the shore and go back to my father camp
what place have i in your kraal ladi ask the girl when her sens
had return to her
i will find you a place rachel answer you ar mine now
ye ladi that is true said noie heavili i am your and no on
els and take rachel hand she press it to her forehead
then togeth onc more thei swam the pool and not too soon for the tide
wa pour into it reach the shore in safeti no easi task for
rachel who must hold the heavi gun abov her head noie ti rachel
towel about her middl to take the place of her moocha and veri
cautious thei crept up the kloof fear lest some of the zulu might
still be lurk in the neighbourhood
at length thei came to the pool into which thei had thrown the soldier
bomba and saw two crocodil doubtless those that had eaten him ly
asleep in the sun upon flat rock at it edg here thei were oblig to
leav the kloof both becaus thei fear to pass the crocodil and for
the reason that their road to the camp ran anoth wai so thei climb up
the cliff and look about but could see onli a pair of orib buck on
ly down under a tree and on eat grass quit close to it mate
the zulu have gone or there would be no buck here said rachel come
now hold the shield befor you and the spear in your hand to hide that
you ar a woman and let us go on boldli
so thei went till thei reach the crest of the next rise and then sprang
back behind it for ly here and there thei saw peopl who seem to be
asleep
the zulu rest exclaim rachel
nai answer the girl with a sigh my peopl dead see the vultur
gather round them
rachel look again and saw that it wa so without a word thei walk
forward and as thei pass each bodi noie gave it it name here lai a
brother there a sister yonder four folk of her father kraal thei came
to a tall and handsom woman of middl ag and she shiver as she had
done in the pool and said in an ici voic
the mother who bore me
a few more step and in a patch of high grass that grew round an antheap
thei found two zulu soldier each pierc through with a spear seat
against the antheap also as though he were but rest wa a
lightcolour man a dwarf in statur spare of frame and with sharp
featur hi dress if he wore ani seem to have been remov from him
for he wa almost nake and rachel notic that no wound could be seen on
him
behold my father said noie in the same ici voic
but whisper rachel he onli sleep no spear ha touch him
not so he is dead dead by the white death after the fashion of hi
peopl
now rachel wonder what thi white death might be and of which peopl
the man wa on that he wa not a zulu who had been stunt in hi growth
she could see for herself nor had she ever met a nativ who at all
resembl him still she could ask no question at that time the thing
wa too aw moreov noie had knelt down befor the bodi and with her
arm thrown around it neck wa whisper into it ear for a full
minut she whisper thu then set her own ear to the cold stirless lip
and for anoth minut or more seem to listen intent nod her
head from time to time never befor had rachel wit anyth so
uncanni and oddli enough the fact that thi scene wa enact in the
bright sunlight ad to it terror she stood paralys forget the
zulu forget everyth except that to all appear the live wa
hold convers with the dead
at length noie rose and turn to her companion said
my spirit ha been good to me i thank my spirit which brought me here
befor it wa too late for us to talk togeth now i have the messag
the messag oh what messag gasp rachel
an inscrut look gather on the face of the beauti nativ girl
it is to me alon she answer but thi i mai sai much of it wa of
you inkosazanayzoola
who told you that wa my nativ name ask rachel spring back
it wa in the messag o thou befor whom king shall bow
nonsens exclaim rachel you have heard it from our peopl
so be it ladi i have heard it from your peopl whom i have never seen
now let us go your father is troubl for you
again rachel look at her sidewai and noie went on
ladi from henceforth i am your servant am i not and that servic will
not be light
she think i shall make her dig thought rachel to herself as the girl
continu in her low soft voic
now i ask you on thingwhen i tell you my stori let it be for your
breast alon sai onli that i am a common girl whom you save from the
soldier
why not answer rachel that is all i have to tell
then onc more thei went on rachel wonder if she dream the girl
noie walk at her side stern and coldfac as a statu
chapter vi
the cast of the lot
thei reach the crest of the last rise and there face them on the
slope of the opposit wave of land stood the waggon surround by the
thorn fenc within which the cattl and hors were still enclos
doubtless for fear of the zulu noth could be more peac than the
aspect of that camp to look at it no on would have believ that within
a few hundr yard a hideou massacr had just taken place present
howev voic began to shout and head to bob up over the fenc then
it occur to rachel that thei must think she wa a prison in the
charg of a zulu and she told noie to lower the shield which she still
held in front of her the next instant some thorn were torn out and her
father a gun in hi hand appear stride toward them
thank god that you ar safe he said as thei met i have suffer great
anxieti although i hope that the white man israelno ishmaelhad
rescu you he came here to warn us he ad in explan veri
earli thi morn then gallop off to find you inde hi afterrid
whose hors he took is still here where on earth have you been rachel
andsuddenli becom awar of noie who arrai onli in a towel a
shield and a stab spear present a curiou if an impress
spectaclewho is thi young person
she is a nativ girl i save from the massacr repli rachel
answer the last question first it is a long stori but i shot the man
who wa go to kill her and we hid in a pool ar you all safe and
where is mother
shot the man shed human blood hid in a pool ejacul mr dove
overcom realli rachel you ar a most try daughter why should you
go out befor daybreak and do such thing
i dont know i am sure father predestin i supposeto save her
life you know
again he contempl the beauti noie then murmur someth about
a blanket ran back to the camp by thi time mr dove had climb out of
the waggon and arriv with the kaffir
i knew you would be safe rachel she said in her gentl voic becaus
noth can hurt you still you do upset your poor father dreadfulli
andwhat ar you go to do with that nake young woman
give her someth to eat dear answer rachel dont ask me ani more
question now we have been sit up to our neck in water for hour
and ar starv and frozen to sai noth of wors thing
at thi moment mr dove arriv with a blanket which he offer to noie
who took it from him and threw it round her bodi then thei went into the
camp where rachel chang her damp cloth whilst noie sat by her in a
corner of the tent present too food wa brought and rachel at
hungrili forc noie to do the same then she went out leav the girl
to rest in the tent and with certain omiss such as the conduct of
noie when she found her dead father told all the stori which wild as
were the time and strang as were the thing that happen in them thei
found wonder enough
when she had done mr dove knelt down and offer up thank for hi
daughter preserv through great danger and with them prayer that
she might be forgiven for have shot the zulu a deed that except for
the physic horror of it did not weigh upon rachel mind
you know father you would have done the same yourself she explain
and so would mother there if she could hold a gun so what is the good
of pretend that it is a sin also no on saw it except that white man
and the crocodil which buri the bodi so the less we sai about the
matter the better it will be for all of us
i admit answer mr dove that the circumst justifi the deed
though i fear that the truth will out sinc blood call for blood but
what ar we to do with the girl thei will come to seek her and kill us
all
thei will not seek father becaus thei think that she is dead and will
never know otherwis unless that white man tell them which he will
scarc do as the zulu would think that he shot the soldier not i she
ha been sent to us and it is our duti to keep her
i suppos so said her father doubtfulli poor thing truli she ha
caus for gratitud to provid all her relat kill by those
bloodthirsti savag and she save
if all of you were kill and i were save i do not know that i should
feel particularli grate answer rachel but it is no us argu
about such thing so let us be thank that we ar not kill too now i
am tire out and go to lie down for of cours we cant leav thi
place at present unless we trek back to durban
such wa the find of noie
when rachel awok from the sleep into which she had fallen sunset wa
near at hand she left the tent where noie still lai slumber or lost in
stupor to find that onli her mother and ishmael afterrid remain in
the camp her father have gone out with the kaffir in order to buri as
mani of the dead as possibl befor night came and with it the jackal
and hyena rachel made up the fire and set to work with her mother help
to cook their even meal whilst thei were thu engag her quick ear
caught the sound of hors hoof and she look up to perceiv the white
man ishmael still lead the spare hors on which she had ridden that
morn he had halt on the crest of ground where she had first seen him
upon the previou dai and wa peer at the camp with the object
appar of ascertain whether it occup were still aliv
i will go and ask him in said rachel who for reason of her own
wish to have a word or two with the man
present she came up to him and saw at onc that he seem to be veri
much asham of himself
well she said cheerfulli you see here i am safe enough and i am
glad that you ar the same
you ar a wonder woman he repli let hi ey sink befor her
clear gaze as wonder as you ar beauti
no compliment pleas said rachel thei ar out of place in thi
savag land
i beg your pardon i could not help speak the truth did thei kill the
girl and let you go

that is veri danger miss dove i know all about it it is she whom
dingaan wa after when he hear that you have shelter her he will send
and kill you all take my advic and turn her out at onc i sai it is
most danger
perhap answer rachel calmli but all the same i shall do noth of
the sort unless she wish to go nor do i think that my father will
either now pleas listen a minut if thi stori come to the ear of the
zulusand i do not see why it should as the crocodil have eaten that
soldierwho will thei think shot him i or the white man who wa with me
do you understand
i understand and shall hold my tongu for your sake
no for your own well by wai of make the bargain fair for my part i
shall sai as littl as possibl of how we separ thi morn not that
i blame you for ride off and leav an obstin young woman whom you
did not know to take her chanc still other peopl might think
differ
ye he answer thei might and i admit that i am asham of myself
but you dont know the zulu as i do and i thought that thei would be all
on us in a moment also i wa mad with you and lost my nerv realli i am
veri sorri
pleas dont apologis it wa quit natur and what is more all for
the best if we had gone on we should have ridden right into them and
perhap never ridden out again now here come my father we have agre
that you will not sai too much about thi girl have we not
he nod and advanc with her lead the hors for he had
dismount to meet mr dove at the open in the fenc
good even said the clergyman who seem depress after hi sad
task as he motion to on of the kaffir to put down hi mattock and
take the hors i dont quit know what happen thi morn but i
have to thank you for try to save my daughter from those cruel men i
have been buri their victim in a littl cleft that we found or rather
some of them the vultur you know and he paus
i didnt save her sir answer the stranger humbl it seem
hopeless as she would not leav the kaffir girl
mr dove look at him searchingli and there wa a suspicion of contempt
in hi voic as he repli
you would not have had her abandon the poor thing would you for the
rest god save them both so it doe not much matter exactli how as
everyth ha turn out for the best wont you come in and have some
supper mrishma am afraid i do not know the rest of your name
there is no more to know mr dove he repli doggedli then ad
look here sir as i daresai you have found out thi is a rough countri
and peopl come to it some of them whose luck ha been rough elsewher
now perhap i am as well born as you ar and perhap my luck wa rough
in other land so that i chose to come and live in a place where there
ar no law or civilis perhap too i took the name of anoth man
who wa driven into the wildernessy will rememb all about himalso
that it doe not seem to have been hi fault ani wai if we should be
thrown up togeth ill ask you to take me as i am that is a hunter and
a trader in the zulu and not to bother about what i have been whatev
i wa christen my name is ishmael now or among the kaffir ibubesi
and if you want anoth let us call it smith
quit so mr ishmael it is no affair of mine repli mr dove with a
smile for he had met peopl of thi sort befor in africa
but within himself alreadi he determin that thi white and perchanc
fallen wander wa on whom perhap it would be hi duti to lead back
into the path of christian proprieti and peac
these matter settl thei went into the littl camp and a sentri have
been set for now the night wa fall fast ishmael wa introduc to
mr dove who look him up and down and said littl after which thei
began their supper when their simpl meal wa finish ishmael lit hi
pipe and sat himself upon the disselboom of the waggon look extrem
handsom and picturesqu in the flare of the firelight which fell upon hi
dark face long black hair and curiou garment for although he had
replac hi lionskin by an old coat hi zebrahid trouser and
waistcoat made of an otter pelt still remain contempl him
rachel felt sure that whatev hi present and past might be he had
spoken the truth when he hint that he wa wellborn inde thi might
be gather from hi voic and method of express himself when he grew
more at eas although it wa true that sometim he substitut a zulu
for an english word and emploi it idiom in hi sentenc doubtless
becaus for year he had been accustom to speak and even to think in
that languag
now he wa explain to mr dove the polit and social posit among
that peopl whose cruel law and custom led to constant fight on the
part of tribe or famili who knew that thei were doom and their
consequ massacr if caught as had happen that dai of cours the
clergyman who had live for some year at durban knew that thi wa
true although never have actual wit on of these dread
event till now he did not realis all their horror
i fear that my task will be even harder than i thought he said with a
sigh
what task ask ishmael
that of convert the zulu i am trek to the king kraal now and
propos to settl there
ishmael knock out hi pipe and fill it again befor he answer
appar he could find no word in which to express hi thought but
when at length these came thei were vigor enough
why not trek to hell and settl there at onc he ask i beg
pardon i meant heaven for you and your like man he went on
excitedli have you ani heart do you care about your wife and daughter
i have alwai imagin that i did mr ishmael repli the missionari
in a cold voic
then do you wish to see their throat cut befor your ey or and he
look at rachel wors
how can you ask such question said mr dove indignantli of cours i
know that there ar risk among all wild peopl but i trust to
provid to protect us
mr ishmael puf at hi pipe and swore to himself in zulu
ye he said when he had recov a littl so i suppos did seyapi
and hi peopl but you have been buri them thi afternoonhav
youall except the girl noie whom you have shelter for which deed
dingaan will buri you all if you go into zululand or rather throw you to
the vultur dont think that your be an umfundusi i mean a
teacher will save you the almighti himself cant save you there you
will be dead and forgotten in a month what more you will have to drive
your own waggon in for your kaffir wont thei know better a bibl
wont turn the blade of an assegai
pleas mr ishmael pleas do not speak soso irreligi said mr
dove in an irrit but nervou voic you do not seem to understand
that i have a mission to perform and if that should involv
martyrdom
oh bother martyrdom which is what you ar after no doubt cast
down your golden crown upon a crystal sea and the rest of iti rememb
the stuff the question is do you wish to murder your wife and daughter
for that the plain english of it
of cours not how can you suggest such a thing
then you had better not cross the tugela go back to durban or stop
where you ar at least for unless he find out anyth dingaan is not
like to interfer with a white man on thi side of the river
that would involv abandon my most cherish ambit and impuls
thatbut i will not speak to you of thing which perhap you might not
understand
i dare sai i shouldnt but i do understand what it feel like to have
your neck twist out of joint look here sir if you want to go into
zululand you should go alon it is no place for white ladi
that is for them to judg sir answer mr dove i believ that their
faith will be equal to thi trial and he look at hi wife almost
imploringli
for onc howev she fail him
my dear john she said if you want my opinion i think that thi
gentleman is quit right for myself i dont care much but it can never
have been intend that we should absolut throw awai our live i have
alwai given wai to you and follow you to mani strang place without
grumbl although as you know we might be quit comfort at home
or at ani rate in some civilis town now i sai that i think you ought
not to go to zululand especi as there is rachel to think of
oh dont troubl about me interrupt that young ladi with a shrug of
her shoulder i can take my chanc as i have often done beforetodai
for instanc
but i do troubl about you my dear although it is true i dont believ
that you will be kill you know i have alwai said so still i do
troubl and johnjohn she ad in a kind of piti cry cant you
see that you have worn me out cant you understand that i am get old
and weak is there nobodi to whom you have a duti as well as to the
heathen ar there not enough heathen here she went on with gather
passion if you must mix with them do what thi gentleman sai and stop
here that is if you wont go back build a hous and let us have a
littl peac befor we die for death will come soon enough and terribl
enough i am sure and she burst into a fit of weep
my dear said mr dove you ar upset the unhappi occurr of
todai whichdid we but know itar doubtless all for the best and
your anxieti for rachel have been too much for you i think that you had
better go to bed and you too rachel i will talk the matter over further
with mr ishmael who perhap ha been sent to guid me i am not
unreason as you think and if he can convinc me that there is ani
risk to your livesfor my own i care nothingi will consid the
suggest of build a missionst outsid zululand at ani rate for
a few year it mai be that it is not intend that we should enter that
countri at present
so mr dove and her daughter went but for two hour or more rachel heard
her father and the hunter talk earnestli and wonder in a sleepi
fashion to what conclus he had come person she did not mind much
on which side of the tugela thei were to live if thei must bide at all in
the region of that river still for her mother sake she determin that
if she could bring it about thei should stai where thei were inde
there wa no choic between thi and return to england as her father
had quarrel too bitterli with the white men at durban to allow of hi
take up hi resid among them again
when rachel woke on the follow morn the first thing she saw in the
grow light wa the orphan nativ noie seat on the further side of
the littl tent her head rest upon her hand and gaze at her
vacantli rachel watch her a while pretend to be still asleep and
for the first time understood how beauti thi girl wa in her own
fashion although small that is in comparison with most kaffir women she
wa perfectli shape and develop her soft skin in that light look
almost white although it had about it noth of the muddi colour of the
halfbre her hair wa long black and curli and worn natur not
forc into artifici shape as is common among the kaffir her featur
were fine cut and intellectu and her ey shade by long lash
somewhat oblong in shape of a brown colour and soft as those of a buck
certainli for a nativ she wa love and what is more quit unlik ani
bantu that rachel had ever seen except inde that dead man whom she said
wa her father and who although he wa so small had manag to kill two
great zulu warrior befor mysteri enough he di himself
noie said rachel when she had complet her observ whereon with
a quick and agil movement the girl rose sank again on her knee besid
her took the hand that hung from the bed between her own and press it
to her lip sai in the soft zulu tongu
inkosazana i am here
is that white man still asleep noie
nai he ha gone he and hi servant rode awai befor the light fear
lest there might still be zulu between him and hi kraal
do you know anyth about him noie
ye ladi i have seen him in zululand he is a bad man thei call him
there lion not becaus he is brave but becaus he hunt and spring by
night
just what i should have thought of him answer rachel and we know
that he is not brave she ad with a smile but never mind thi jackal
in a lion hide tell me your stori noie if you will onli speak low
for thi tent is thin
ladi said the girl you who were born white in bodi and in spirit
hear me i am but half a zulu my father who di yesterdai in the flesh
depart back to the world of ghost wa of anoth peopl who live far
to the north a small peopl but a strong thei live among the tree thei
worship tree thei die when their tree di thei ar dealer in dream
thei ar the companion of ghost littl men befor whom the tribe
trembl who hate the sun and dwell in the deep of the forest myself i
do not know them i have never seen them but my father told me these
thing and other that i mai not repeat when he wa a young man my
father fled from hi peopl
why ask rachel for the girl paus
ladi i do not know i think it wa becaus he would have been their
priest or on of their priest and he fear i think that he had seen a
woman a slave to them whom therefor he might not marri i think that
woman wa my mother so he fled from themwith her and came to live
among the zulu he wa a great doctor there in chaka time not on of
the abangoma not on of the smellersoutofwitch not a
bringerdowntodeath for like all hi race he hate bloodsh no
none of these thing but a doctor of medicin a master of magic an
interpret of dream a lord of wisdom ye it wa hi wisdom that made
chaka great and when he withdrew it from him becaus of hi cruelti
then chaka di
ladi dingaan rule in chaka place dingaan who slew him but although
he had been chaka doctor my father wa spare becaus thei fear him
i wa the onli child of my mother but he took other wive after the zulu
fashion not becaus he love them i think but that he might not seem
differ to other men so he grew great and rich and live in peac
becaus thei fear him ladi my father love me and to me alon he
taught hi languag and hi wisdom i help him with hi medicin i
interpret the dream which he could not interpret hi blanket fell upon
me often i wa sought in marriag but i did not wish to marri wisdom is
my husband
there came an evil dai we knew that it must come my father and i and i
wish to fly the land but he could not do so becaus of hi other wive
and children the maiden of my district were marshal for the king to
see hi ey fell upon me and he thought me fair becaus i am differ
from zulu women andyou can guess yet i wa save for the other
doctor and the head wive of the king said that it wa not wise that i
should be taken into hi hous i who knew too mani secret and could
bewitch him if i will or prison him with drug that leav no trace so
i escap a while and wa thank now it came about that becaus he
might not take me dingaan began to think much of me and to dream of me at
night at last he ask me of my father as a gift not as a right for
so he thought that no ill would come with me but i prai my father to
keep me from dingaan for i hate dingaan and told him that if i were
sent to the king i would poison him my father listen to me becaus he
love me and could not bear to part with me and said dingaan nai now
dingaan grew veri angri and ask counsel of hi other doctor but thei
would give him none becaus thei fear my father then he ask counsel
of that white man hishmel who is call the lion and who is much at the
kraal of umgungundhlovu
ah said rachel now i understand why he wish you to be kill
the white man hishmel the jackal in a lion skin as you name him
laugh at dingaan fear he said to him it is of the father seyapi
you should be afraid he ha the magic not the girl kill the father and
hi hous and take the daughter whom your heart desir and be happi
so spoke hishmel and dingaan thought hi counsel good and paid him for
it with the teeth of eleph and certain women for whom he ask now
my father forebod ill and i also for both of us had dream a dream
still we did not fly until the slayer were almost at the gate becaus
of hi other wive and hi children nor save for them would he have fled
then or i either but would have di after the fashion of hi peopl as
he did at last
the white death queri rachel
ye ladi the white death still in the end we fled think to gain
the protect of the white men down yonder i went first to escap the
king men who had order to take me aliv and bring me to him that is
why we were not togeth at the end ladi you know the rest hishmel
doubtless had seen you and think that the impi would kill you came to
warn you then we met just as i wa about to die though perhap not by
that soldier spear as you thought i have spoken
what messag came to you when you knelt down befor your dead father
ask rachel for the second time sinc on thi point she wa intens
curiou
again that inscrut look gather on the girl face and she answer
did i not tell you it wa for my ear alon o inkosazanayzoola i dare
not sai it be satisfi but thi i mai sai your fate and mine ar
intertwin your and mine and anoth for our spirit ar sister
which have dwelt togeth in past dai
inde said rachel smile for she who had mix with them from her
childhood knew someth of the mystic of the nativ also that it wa
often nonsens well noie i love you i know not why perhap for all
you have suffer yet i sai to you that if you wish to remain my sister
in the spirit you had better separ from me in the flesh that jackal
man know your secret girl and soon or late will loos the assegai on
you
doubtless she answer doubtless mani thing will come about but
thei ar doom to come about whether i go or whether i stai thei will
happen sai you therefor ladi and i will obei shall i go or shall i
stai or shall i die befor your ey
it is on your own head answer rachel shrug her shoulder
nai nai ladi you forget it is on your also see that if i stai i
mai bring peril on you and your hous have you then no order for me
noie i have answeredon judg you
i will not judg let heavenabov judg ladi give me a hair from your
head
rachel pluck out the hair and hand it a shine thread of gold to
noie who drew on from her own dark tress and laid them side by side
see she said thei ar of the same length now without the wind blow
gentli come then to the door of the tent and i will throw these two
hair into the wind if that which is black float first to the ground
then i stai if that which is golden then i go to seek my hair is it
agre
it is agre
so the two girl went to the entranc of the tent and noie with a swift
motion toss up the hair as it happen on of those littl eddi of
wind which ar common in south africa caught them caus them to rise
almost perpendicularli into the air at a certain height about forti
feet the support wind seem to fail that is so far as the hair from
noi head wa concern for there it float high abov them like a
black thread in the sunlight and gentli by slow degre came to the earth
just at their feet but the hair from rachel head be caught by the
fring of the whirlwind wa born upward and onward veri swiftli until
at length it vanish from their sight
it seem that i stai said noie
ye answer rachel i am veri glad also if ani evil come of it we
ar not to blame the wind is to blame
ye ladi but what make the wind to blow
again rachel shrug her shoulder and ask a question in her turn
whither ha that hair of mine been born noie
i do not know ladi perhap my father spirit took it for hi own end
i think so i think it went northward at ani rate when mine fell it wa
snatch awai wa it not and yet thei both float up togeth i think
that on dai you will follow that hair of your ladi follow it to the
land where great tree whisper secret to the night
chapter vii
the messag of the king
so it chanc that noie becam a member of the dove household for obviou
reason she chang her name and thenceforward wa call nonha also it
happen that mr dove abandon hi idea of settl as a missionari in
zululand and instead took up hi resid at thi beauti spot he
call it ramah becaus it wa a place of weep for here all the famili
and depend of seyapi had been destroi by the spear mr dove
thought it an illomen name enough but after her manner gave wai to her
husband in the matter
i think there will be more weep here befor everyth is done she
said
rachel answer howev that it wa as good as ani other sinc name
could alter noth here then at ramah mr dove built him a hous on
that knoll where first he had pitch hi camp it wa a veri good hous
after it fashion for as ha been said he did not lack for mean and
wa moreov clever in such matter he hire a mason who had drift to
natal to cut stone of which a plenti lai at hand and two halfbre
carpent to execut the woodwork whilst the kaffir thatch the whole
as onli thei can do then he set to work upon a church which wa place
on the crest of the opposit knoll where the white man ishmael had
appear on the even of their arriv like the hous it wa excel
of it sort and when at length it wa finish after more than a year of
labour mr dove felt a proud man
inde at ramah he wa happier than he had ever been sinc he land upon
the shore of africa for now at length hi dream seem to be in the wai
of realis veri soon a consider nativ villag sprang up around
him peopl almost entir by remnant of the natal tribe whom chaka
had destroi and who were but too glad to settl under the aegi of the
white man especi when thei discov how good he wa of the
doctrin which he preach to them dai and night most of them it is
true did not understand much still thei accept them as the price of
be allow to live in hi shadow but in the vast major of case
thei sturdili refus to put awai all wive but on as he earnestli
exhort them to do
at first he wish to eject them from the settlement in punish of thi
sin but when it came to the point thei absolut refus to go
demonstr to him that thei had as much right to live there as he had
an argument that he wa unabl to controvert so he wa oblig to submit
to the presenc of thi abomin which he did in the hope that in time
their hard heart would be soften
continu to preach to us o shouter thei said and we will listen
mayhap in year to come we shall learn to think as you do meanwhil give
us space to consid the point
so he continu to preach and content himself with baptis the
children and veri old peopl who took no more wive except on thi on
point howev thei got on excel togeth inde never sinc
chaka broke upon them like a destroi demon had these poor folk been so
happi the missionari import plough and taught them to improv their
agricultur so that er long thi rich virgin soil brought forth
abundantli their few cattl multipli also in an amaz fashion as did
their famili and soon thei were as prosper as thei had been in the
good old dai befor thei knew the zulu assegai especi as to their
amaz the shouter never took from them even a calf or a bundl of
corn by wai of tax onli the shadow of that zulu assegai still lai upon
them for if chaka wa dead dingaan rule a few mile awai across the
tugela moreov hear of the rise of thi new town and of certain
strang matter connect with it he sent spi to inspect and enquir
the spi return and report that there dwelt in it onli a white
medicineman with hi wife and a number of natal kaffir also thei
report in great detail mani wonder stori concern the beauti
maiden with a high name who pass as the white teacher daughter and
who had alreadi becom the subject of so much nativ talk and rumour on
learn all these thing dingaan despatch an embassi who deliv
thi messag
i dingaan king of the zulu have heard that you o white shouter have
built a town upon my border and peopl it with the puppi of the
jackal whom chaka hunt i send to you now to sai that you and your
jackal shall have peac from me so long as you harbour none of my
runawai but if i find but on of them there then an impi shall wipe you
out i hear also that there dwell with you a beauti white maiden said
to be your daughter who is known throughout the land as
inkosazanayzoola now that is the name of our spirit who the doctor
sai is also white and it is strang to us that thi maiden should bear
that great name some of the isanusi the prophetess declar that
she is our spirit in the flesh but that meat stick in my throat i
cannot swallow it still i invit thi maiden to visit me that i mai see
her and judg of her and i swear to you and to her by the ghost of my
ancestor that no harm shall come to her then or at ani time he who so
much as lai a finger upon her shall die he and all hi hous becaus of
her name which i am told she ha born from a child all the territori
of the zulu ar her kraal and all the thousand of the zulu ar her
servant yea becaus of her high name i give to her power of life and
death wherev men obei my word and for an offer i send to her twelv
of my royal white cattl and a bull also an ox train to ride when
she visit me let her ride upon the white ox that she mai be known but
let no man come with her for among the peopl of the zulu she must be
attend by zulu onli i have spoken i prai that she who is name
princess of the zulu will appear befor my messeng and acknowledg the
gift of the king of the zulu that thei mai see her in the flesh and make
report of her to me
now when mr dove had receiv thi messag on even at sundown he
went into the hous and repeat it to rachel for it puzzl him much
and he knew not what to answer
rachel in her turn took counsel with noie who wa hidden awai lest some
of the embassi should see and recognis her
speak with the messeng said noie it is well to have power among
the zulu i who have some knowledg of thi busi sai speak with
them alon and speak softli sai that on dai you will come
so have explain the matter to her father and obtain hi consent
rachel who desir to impress these savag threw a white shawl about
her as noie instruct her to do then let her long golden hair
hang down she went out alon carri a light assegai in her hand to the
place where the messeng six of them and those who had driven the
cattl from zululand were encamp in the guest kraal at the gate of
which as it chanc lai a great boulder of rock on thi boulder she
took her stand unobserv wait there till the full moon shone out
from behind a dark cloud turn her white robe to silver now of a
sudden the messeng who were seat togeth talk and take snuff
look up and saw her
inkosazanayzoola exclaim on of them rise whereon thei all
sprang to their feet and perceiv thi beauti and mysteri figur
by a common impuls lift their right arm and gave to her what no woman
had ever receiv beforeth royal salut
bayt thei cri bayt then stood silent
i hear you said rachel who spoke their tongu as well as she did her
own it ha been report to me that you wish to see me o mouth of
the king behold i am pleas to appear befor you what would you of
inkosazanayzoola o mouth of the king
then their spokesman an old man of high rank with a wither hand
step forward from the line of hi companion stare at her for a
while and salut again
ladi he said humbl ladi or spirit we would know how thou earnest by
that great name of thine
it wa given me as a child far awai from here she answer becaus in
a mighti tempest the lightn turn asid and smote me not becaus the
water rage yet drown me not becaus the lion slept with me yet
harm me not it came to me from the high heaven that wa my friend i do
not know how it came
we have heard the stori answer the old man which inde thei had
with mani addit and we believ we believ that the heaven abov
gave thee their own name which is the name of the spirit of our peopl
that spirit i have seen in a dream and she wa like to thee o
inkosazanayzoola
it mai be so mouth of the king still i am woman not spirit
yet in everi woman there dwell a spirit or so we believ and in thee a
great on or so we have heard and believ o ladi of the heaven to
thee then again we repeat the word of dingaan and of hi council which
todai we have said in the ear of him who think himself thy father to
thee the road ar open thine ar the cattl and the kraal here is an
earnest of them thine ar the live of men command now if thou wilt
that on of us be slain befor thee and whilst thou watchest he shall
look hi last upon the moon
i hear you said rachel quietli but i seek the life of none who ar
good i thank the king for hi gift i wish the king well i rememb that
life and death lie in my hand sai these word to the king
we will sai them but wilt thou not come o ladi as the king desir a
regiment shall meet thee on the river bank and lead thee to hi hous
unharm shalt thou come unharm shalt thou return and what thou askest
that shall be given thee
on dai perchanc i will come but not now go in peac o mouth of
the king
as she spoke anoth dark cloud float across the moon and when it had
pass awai she stood no more upon the rock then see that she wa
gone those messeng gather up their spear and mat and return
swiftli to zululand
when she readi the hous again rachel told her father and mother all
that had pass laugh as she spoke
it seem scarc right my dear said mr dove when she had done
those benight heathen will realli believ that you ar someth
unearthli
then let them she answer it can do no on ani harm and the power
of life and death with the rest of it unless it wa all talk as i
suspect might be veri us on dai who know and now the princess of
the heaven will go and set the supper as noiei beg pardon nonhai
off duti for the present
afterward she ask noie who wa the old man with a wither hand who had
spoken as the king mouth
mopo is hi name mopo or umbopo none other o zoola she answer it
wa he who stab tchaka the black on it is said also that alon
among men live he ha seen the white spirit the inkosazana thrice he
ha seen her or so goe the tale that my father who knew everyth
told to me that is why dingaan sent him here to make report of you and
she told her all the wonder stori of mopo and of the death of tchaka
which rachel treasur in her mind footnot for the histori of mopo
see nada the lilyauthor
such wa rachel first introduct to the zulu an occas on which
her undoubt histrion abil stood her in good stead
thi matter of the embassi happen and in due cours wa almost
forgotten that is until a certain event occur which brought it into
mind for some time howev rachel thought of it a good deal wonder
how it came about that her nativ name and the strang signific which
thei appear to give to it had taken such a hold of the imagin of
the zulu ultim she discov that the white man ishmael wa the
chief caus of these thing he had live so long among savag that he
had caught someth of their mind and dark superstit to him as to
them it seem a marvel thing that she should have acquir the titl
of the legendari spirit of the zulu peopl the calm courag too so
unusu in a woman which she show when she shot the warrior and at the
risk of her own life save that of the girl noie impress him as
someth almost ultrahuman especi when he rememb hi own
conduct on that occas all of thi stori of cours he did not tell to
the zulu for he fear lest thei should take vengeanc for hi share in
it but of rachel he discours to the king and hi induna or great
men as a white witchdoctoress of supernatur power whose name show
that she wa mix up with the fortun of the race therefor in the
end dingaan sent mopo he who knew the spirit to make report of her
when he wa not absent upon hi hunt or trade expedit ishmael
visit ramah a great deal and as rachel soon discov not without an
object inde almost from the first her feminin instinct led her to
suspect that thi man who notwithstand hi good look repel her so
intens wa fall in love with her which in truth he had done onc
and for all at their first meet in the begin he did not it is
true sai much that could be so interpret but hi whole attitud
toward her suggest it as did other thing for instanc when he came
to visit the dove he discard hi garment of hide includ the
picturesqu zebraskin trouser and appear dress in smart european
cloth which he had contriv to obtain from durban and a larg hat with
a white ostrich feather that struck rachel as even more ludicr than
the famou trouser also he wa continu send present of game and
of skin or of rare kaross that is fur rug which he order to be
deliv to her personallytoken all of them that she could not
misunderstand her father howev misunderstood them persist
although her mother saw someth of the truth and did her best to shield
her from attent which she knew to be unwelcom mr dove believ that
it wa hi compani which ishmael sought inde in thi matter the man wa
veri clever contriv to give the clergyman the impress that he
requir spiritu instruct and comfort which of cours he found
forthcom in an abund suppli when mr dove remonstr sai
that she misdoubt her of him and hi charact her husband answer
obstin that it wa hi duti to turn a sinner from hi wai and
declin to pursu the convers so ishmael continu to come
for her part rachel did her best to avoid him instruct noie to keep a
constant lookout both with her ey and through the kaffir and to warn
her of hi advent then she would slip awai into the bush or down to the
seashor and remain there till he wa gone or if he came when she could
not do so in the even for instanc would keep noie at her side and
on the first opportun retir to her own room
now the result of thi method of selfprotect wa to caus ishmael to
hate noie as bitterli as she hate him he guess that the girl knew the
dread truth about him that it wa he and no other who had counsel
dingaan to kill her father and all hi famili and take her by forc into
hi hous and although she said noth of it he suspect that she had
told everyth to rachel moreov it wa she who alwai thwart him
who prevent him time upon time from have a singl word alon with her
mistress therefor he determin to be reveng upon noie whenev an
opportun occur
but as yet he could find none sinc if he were to tell the zulu that
she still live and caus her to be kill or taken awai he wa sure
that it would mean a final breach with the dove famili all of whom had
learn to love thi beauti orphan maid so he nurs hi rage in
secret
meanwhil hi passion increas daili burn ever more fierc for it
continu repress until at length the chanc for which he had wait
so long came to him
have becom awar of rachel habit of slip awai whenev he
appear he show himself on horseback at a littl distanc then wait
a while and instead of go up to the mission station rode round it
and hid in some bush whenc he could command a view of the surround
countri present he saw rachel who wa alon for she had not wait to
call noie hurri toward the seashor along the edg of that kloof
down which ran the stream where the crocodil live present when she
had gone too far to return to the hous if she caught sight of him he
follow after her and leav hi hors at last came up with her
seat on a rock by the pool in which she had bath on the morn of the
massacr
walk softli in hi veldschoen or shoe made of raw hide on the
sand rachel knew noth of hi come until hi shadow fell upon her
then she sprang up and saw him smile and bow the ostrichplum hat
in hi hand her first impuls wa to run awai but recov herself she
nod in a friendli fashion and bade him good dai ad

time as thei wait to make sure that ishmael had realli gone it wa to
see the man himself ride awai from it gate

then i think that i am rid of him said rachel with a sigh of relief
onli be care dear that he doe not do you a mischief for such men
do not like to be found out then she left the stoep and went to tell
her mother all that had happen
when she had heard the stori mr dove who detest ishmael as much as
her daughter did tri to persuad her husband not to visit hi kraal
sai that it would onli breed a feud and that under the circumst
it would be easi to forbid him the hous upon other ground but mr dove
obstin as usual refus to listen to her sai that he would not
judg the man without evid and that of the nativ could not be
reli on also if the tale were true it wa hi duti as hi spiritu
advis to remonstr with him
so hi poor wife gave up argu as she alwai did and long befor dawn
on the follow morn mr dove accompani by two guid depart
upon hi errand
after he had ridden some twelv mile across the plain which lai behind
ramah just at daybreak he reach a pass or nek between two swell

approach the kraal from it main entranc issu four or five
goodlook nativ women on of them accompani by a boi and all
carri hoe in their hand for thei were go out at sunris to work
in the meali field when thei saw mr dove thei stood still stare at

would see that he is almost white she ad with pride
mr dove knew not what to answer thi intellig overwhelm him and
he sat silent on hi hors the wive of ishmael prepar to pass on to
the meali field then stop and began to whisper togeth at length
the mother of the boi turn and address him while the other crowd
behind her to listen
we desir to ask you a question teacher she said somewhat shyli for
evid thei knew well enough who he wa is it true that we ar to
have a new sister
a new sister what do you mean ask mr dove
we mean teacher she repli smile that we have heard that ibubesi
is court the beauti zoola the daughter of your head wife and we
thought that perhap you had come to arrang about the cattl that he must
pai for her doubtless if she is so fair it will be a whole herd
thi wa too much even for mr dove
how dare you talk so you heathen hussi he gasp where is the
white man
teacher she repli with indign and draw herself up why do
you call us bad name we ar respect women the wive of on husband

youngest sister she whom he marri last month we wish you good dai as

inkosazana your daughter will not be as rude as you ar for if so how
shall we love her as we wish to do then wrap her blanket round her
with a dignifi air the offend ladi stalk off follow by her
variou sister
as for mr dove who for onc in hi life wa in a tower rage he cut
hi hors vicious with the sjambok or hippopotamushid whip which he
carri and follow by hi guid gallop forward to a big hut in the
centr of the kraal
appar ishmael heard the sound of hi hors hoof for as the
missionari wa dismount he crawl out of the beehol of the hut upon
hi hand and knee as a kaffir doe follow by a young woman in the
lightest of attir who wa yawn as though she had just been arous
from sleep what is more except for the colour of hi skin he wa a
kaffir and noth els for hi costum consist of a skin moocha such
as the nativ wear and a fur kaross thrown over hi shoulder
straighten himself ishmael saw for the first time who wa hi visitor
hi jaw drop and he utter an ejacul that need not be record
then stood silent mr dove wa silent also for hi wrath would not allow
him to speak
how do you do sir ishmael jerk out at last you ar an earli
visitor and find me somewhat unprepar if i had known that you were
come i wouldthen suddenli he rememb hi attir or the lack of
it also hi companion who wa lean on hi shoulder and peep at the
white man over it draw the kaross tightli about him he gave the poor
girl a backward kick and with a kaffir oath bade her begon then went on
hurriedli i am afraid my dress is not quit what you ar accustom to
but among these poor heathen i find it necessari to conform more or less
to their wai in order to gain their confid andumaffect will
you come into the hut my servant there will get you some tywala kaffir
beeri mean some amasi curdl milk at onc and i will have a calf
kill for breakfast
mr dove could bear it no longer
ishmael or smith or ibubesiwhichev name you mai prefer he broke
out do not lie to me about your servant for now i know all the truth
which i refus to believ when my daughter and nonha told it me you ar
a blackheart villain but yesterdai you dare to come and ask rachel to
marri you and now i find that you ar livingoh i cannot sai it it
make me asham of my race listen to me sir if ever you dare to set
foot in ramah again or to speak to my wife and daughter the kaffir
shall whip you off the place inde he ad shake hi sjambok in
ishmael face although i am an older man than you ar were it not for
my offic i would give you the thrash you deserv
at first ishmael had shrunk beneath thi torrent of invect but the
threat of violenc rous hi fierc natur hi face grew evil and hi
long black hair and beard bristl with wrath
you had best get out of thi you prayersnuffl old humbug he said
savag for if you stop much longer i will make you sing anoth tune
we have seacow whip here too and you shall learn what a hide mean
such a hide that your own famili wont know you if you live to get back
to them look here i offer to marri your daughter on the squar and i
meant what i said id have got rid of all thi black baggag and she
should have been the onli on well ill marri her yet onli now shell
just take her place with the other we ar all on flesh and blood black
and white aint we i have often heard you preach it so what will she
have to complain of he sneer she can go and hoe meali like the
rest
as thi brutal talk fell upon hi ear mr dove reason depart from him
entir after all he wa an english gentleman first and a clergyman
afterward also he love hi daughter and to hear her spoken of like
thi wa intoler to him as it would have been to ani father lift
the sjambok he cut ishmael across the mouth so sharpli that the blood came
from hi lip then suddenli rememb that thi deed would probabl
mean hi death stood still await the issu as it chanc it did not
for the man like most brute and bulli wa a coward as rachel had
alreadi found out obei hi first impuls he sprang at the clergyman
with an oath then see that hi two guid who carri assegai had
rang themselv besid him check himself for he fear lest those
spear should pierc hi heart
you ar in my hous he said wipe the blood from hi beard and an
old man so i cant kill you as i would anyon els but you have made me
your enemi now you fool and other can i have protect you so far for
your daughter sake but i wont do it ani longer you think of that when
your time come
my time like your will come when god will answer mr dove
unflinchingli not when you or anyon els will i do not fear you in
the least still i am sorri that i struck you it wa a sin of which i
repent as i prai that you mai repent
then he mount hi hors and rode awai from the kraal mafooti
when mr dove reach ramah he onli said to rachel that what she had heard
wa quit true and that he had forbidden ishmael the hous of cours
howev noie soon learnt the whole stori from the kaffir guid and
repeat it to her mistress to hi wife on the other hand he told
everyth with the result that she wa veri much disturb she point
out to him that thi white outcast wa a most danger man who would
certainli be reveng upon them in on wai or anoth again she implor
him as she had often done befor to leav these savag countri wherein
he had labour for all the best year of hi life sai that it wa not
right that he should expos their daughter to the risk of them
but answer her husband you have often told me that you were sure no
harm would come to rachel and i think that too
ye dear i am sure still for mani reason it doe not seem right to
keep her here she did not add poor unselfish woman that there wa
anoth who should be consid as well as rachel
how can i go awai he went on excitedli just when all the seed that i
have sown is ripen to harvest if i did so my work would be utterli
lost and my peopl relaps into barbar again i am not afraid of thi
man or of anyth that he can do to my bodi but if i ran awai from him
it would be injur my soul and what account should i give of my
cowardic when my time come do you go my love and take rachel with you
if you wish leav me to finish my work alon
but now as befor mr dove would not go and rachel when she wa
ask shrug her shoulder and answer laugh that she wa not
afraid of anybodi or anyth and except for her mother sake did not
care whether she went or stai certainli she would not leav her nor
she ad did she wish to sai goodby to africa
when she wa ask why she repli vagu that she had grown up there
and it wa her home but her mother watch her knew well enough that
she had anoth reason although no word of it everi pass her lip in
africa she had met richard darrien as a child and in africa and nowher
els she believ she would meet him again as a woman
the week and month went by bring to the ramah household no sight or
tide of the white man ishmael thei heard through the kaffir inde
that although he still kept hi kraal at mafooti he himself had gone awai
on some trade journei far to the north and did not expect to return for
a year new at which everyon rejoic except noie who shook her wise
littl head and said noth
so all fear of the man gradual di awai and thing were veri peac
and prosper at ramah
in fact thi quiet prove to be but the lull befor the storm
on dai about eight month after mr dove had visit the kraal mafooti
anoth embassi came to rachel from the zulu king dingaan bring with
it a present of more white cattl she receiv them as she had done
befor at night and alon for thei refus to speak to her in the
presenc of other peopl
in substanc their petit wa the same that it had been befor name
that she would visit zululand as the king and hi induna desir her
counsel upon an import matter when ask what thi matter wa thei
either were or pretend to be ignor sai that it had not been
confid to them thereon she said that if dingaan chose to submit the
question to her by messeng she would give him her opinion on it but
that she could not come to hi kraal thei ask why see that the
whole nation would guard her and no hair of her head be harm
becaus i am a child in the hous of my peopl and thei will not allow
me to leav even for a dai she answer think that thi repli would
appeal to a race who believ absolut in obedi to parent and everi
establish author
is it so remark the old induna who spoke as dingaan mouthnot
mopo but anoth now how can the inkosazanayzoola befor whom a
whole nation will bow be in bond to a white umfundusi a mere
skydoctor shall the wide heaven obei a cloud
if thei ar bred of that cloud retort rachel
the heaven breed the cloud not the cloud the heaven answer the
induna aptli
now it occur to rachel that thi thing wa go further than it
should to be set up as a kind of guardian spirit to the zulu had seem
a veri good joke and natur appeal to the love of power which is
common to women but when it involv at ani rate in the ey of that
peopl dominion over her own parent the joke wa she felt becom
seriou so she determin suddenli to bring it to an end
what mean you messeng of the king she ask i am but the child of
my parent and the parent ar greater than the child and must be obei
of her
inkosazana answer the old man with a deprecatori smile if it
pleas you to tell us such tale our ear must listen as if it pleas
you to order us to be kill we must be kill but learn that we know
the truth we know how as a child you came down from abov in the
lightn and how these white peopl with whom you dwell found you ly
in the mist on the mountain top and took you to their home in place of a
babe whom thei had buri
who told you that stori ask rachel amaz
it wa reveal to the council of the doctor ladi
then that wa reveal which is not true i wa born as other women ar
and my name of ladi of the heaven came to me by chanc as by chanc i
resembl the spirit of your peopl
we hear you answer the mouth polit you were born as other
women ar by chanc you had your high name by chanc you ar tall and
fair and goldenhair like the spirit of our peopl we hear you
then rachel gave it up
bear my word to the king she said and thei rose salut her with a
bayt that royal salut which never befor had been given to woman and
depart
when thei had gone rachel went into supper and told her parent all the
stori mr dove now that she seem to take a seriou view of the matter
affect to treat it as absurd although when she had laugh hi
attitud it mai be rememb wa differ he talk of the silli zulu
superstit show how thei had twist up the stori of the death of
her babi brother and her escap from the flood in the umtavuna river
into that which thei had narrat to her he even suggest that the whole
thing wa nonsens part of some polit move to enabl the king or a
parti in the state to declar that thei had with them the word of their
tradit spirit and oracl
mr dove howev who that night wa strang depress and uneasi
thought far otherwis she point out that thei were plai with vast
and cruel forc and that whatev these peopl exactli believ about
rachel it wa a dread thing for a girl to be put in a posit in
which the live of hundr might hang upon her nod
ye and she ad hyster perhap our own live alsoperhap
our own live also
to chang the convers which wa grow pain rachel ask if
anyon had seen noie her father answer that two hour ago just befor
the embassi arriv he had met her go down to the bank of the stream
as he suppos to gather flower for the tabl then he began to talk
about the girl sai what a sweet creatur she wa and how strang it
seem to him that although she appear to accept all the doctrin of
the christian faith as yet she had never consent to be baptis
it wa while he wa speak thu that rachel suddenli observ her mother
fall forward so that her bodi rest on the tabl as though a kind of
fit had seiz her rachel sprang toward her but befor she reach her
she appear to have quit recov onli her face look veri white
what on earth is the matter mother
oh dont ask me she answer a terribl thing a sort of fanci that
came to me from talk about those zulu i thought i saw thi place all
red with blood and tongu of fire lick it up it went as quickli as it
came and of cours i know that it is nonsens
chapter ix
the take of noie
present mr dove who seem to have quit recov from her curiou
seizur went to bed
i dont like it father said rachel when the door had close behind
her of cours it is contrari to experi and all that but i believ
that mother is foresight
nonsens dear nonsens said her father it is her scotch
superstit that is all we have been marri for fiveandtwenti year
now and i have heard thi sort of thing again and again but although we
have live in wild place where anyth might happen to us noth out
of the wai ever ha happen in fact we have alwai been most mercifulli
preserv
that true father still i am not sure perhap becaus i am rather
that wai myself sometim thu i know that she is right about me no
harm will happen to me at least no perman harm i feel that i shall
live out my life as i feel someth els
what els rachel
do you rememb the lad richard darrien she ask colour a littl
what the boi who wa with you that night on the island ye i rememb
him although i have not thought of him for year
well i feel that i shall see him again
mr dove laugh is that all he said if he is still aliv and in
africa it wouldnt be veri wonder if you did would it and at ani
rate of cours you will on dai when we all ceas to be aliv realli
he ad with irrit there ar enough bother in life without
rubbish of thi kind which come from live among savag and absorb
their idea i am begin to think that i shall have to give wai and
leav africa though it will break my heart just when after all the
strive my effort ar be crown with success
i have alwai told you father that i dont want to leav africa
still there is mother to be consid her health is not what it wa
well he said impati i will talk to her and weigh the thing
perhap i shall receiv guidanc though for my part i cannot see what it
matter weve got to die some time and if necessari i prefer that it
should be while do my duti take no thought for the morrow suffici
unto the dai is the evil thereof ha alwai been my motto who am
content with what it pleas provid to send me
then rachel see no us in continu the convers bade him
goodnight and went to look for noie onli to discov that she wa not
in the hous thi disturb her veri much although it occur to her
that she might possibl be with friend in the villag hide till she
wa sure the zulu embassi had gone so she went to bed without troubl
her father
at daybreak next morn she rose not have slept veri well and went
out to look for the girl without success for no on had heard or seen
anyth of her as she wa return to the hous howev she met a
solitari zulu a dignifi middleag man whom she thought she
recognis as on of the embassi although of thi she could not be sure
as she had onli seen these peopl in the moonlight the man who wa quit
unarm except for a kerri which he carri crouch down on catch
sight of heir in token of respect as she approach he rose and gave her
the royal salut then she wa sure
speak she said
inkosazana he answer humbl be not angri with me i am tamboosa
on of the king induna you saw me with the other last night
i saw you
inkosazana there ha been dwell with you on noie the daughter of
seyapi the wizard who with all hi hous wa slain at thi place by order
of the king she also should have been slain but we have learn that you
call down lightn from heaven and that with it you slew the soldier
who had run her down slew him and burn him up as you had the right to
do and took the girl to be your slave as you had the right to do
speak on said rachel show none of the surpris which she felt
inkosazana we know that you have come to love thi girl therefor
yesterdai befor we spoke with you we seiz her as we were command and
hid her awai await your answer to our messag had you consent to
visit the king at hi great place we would have let her go but as you
did not consent my companion have taken her to the king
an ill deed what more tamboosa
thi the king sai by my mouthlet the inkosazana come and command and
her servant noie shall go free and unharm for is she not a dog in her
hut but if she come not and at onc then the girl di
how know i that thi tale is true tamboosa ask rachel control
herself with an effort for she love noie dearli
the man turn toward some bush that grew at a distanc of about twenti
pace and cri come hither
thereon from among the bush where she lai hidden rose a littl maid of
about fourteen whom rachel knew well as a girl that noie often took with
her to carri basket and other thing
tell now the tale of the take of noie and deliv the messag that she
gave to you command tamboosa
thereon the trembl child began and after the nativ fashion
suppress no detail or circumst howev small narrat how the
zulu had surpris her and noie while thei were gather flower and
have bound their arm had caus them to be hurri awai unseen to some
dens bush about four mile off here thei had been kept hidden till in
the night the embassi return then thei had spoken with noie who in the
end call her and gave her a messag thi wa the messag sai to the
inkosazana that the zulu have caught me and ar take me to dingaan the
king sai that thei declar that if she is pleas to come and speak the
word i shall be set free unharm that is if she come at onc but if
she doe not come then i shall be kill sai to her that i do not ask
that she should come who am readi to die and that though i believ that
no harm will happen to her in zululand i think that she had better not
come sai that live or dead i love her
then the maid describ how the embassi went on with noie leav her in
the charg of the man tamboosa who at the first break of dawn brought her
back to ramah and made her hide in the bush
now rachel had no more doubt clearli the tale wa true and the question
waswhat must be done she thought a while then bade tamboosa and the
child to follow her to the missionhous on the stoep she found her
father and mother sit in the sun and drink coffe after the south
african fashion
what is it ask mr dove look at the man anxious
rachel order him to repeat hi stori and thi he did address rachel
alon for of her father and mother he would take no notic when he had
done the child told her tale also
go now and wait without said rachel when it wa finish
inkosazana i go answer the man but if it pleas you to save your
servant know that you must come swiftli if you ar not across the tugela
by sunset thi night word will be pass to the king and she di at
onc know also that you must come alon with me for if ani white or
black accompani you thei will be kill
now said rachel when the three of them were left alon now what is to
be done
mr dove shook her head helplessli and look at her husband who broke
into a tirad against the zulu their superstit cruelti custom
and everyth that wa their and end by declar that it wa of
cours utterli imposs that rachel should go upon such a mad errand
and thu place herself in the power of savag
but father she said when he had done do you understand that you ar
pronounc noi death sentenc if you were in my place would you not
go
of cours i would in fact i propos to do so as it is no doubt dingaan
will listen to me
you mean that dingaan will kill you did you not hear what that man
tamboosa said father you must not go
no john broke in mr dove rachel is right you must not go for you
would never come back again also how can you be so cruel as to think of
leav me here alon
then i suppos that we must abandon that poor girl to her fate
exclaim mr dove
how can you suppos anyth so merciless father when it is in my power
to save her ask rachel if i let those horribl zulu kill her i
shall never be happi again all my life
and what if the horribl zulu kill you
thei will not kill me father mother know thei will not and so do i
but as thei have got thi mad into their head i am sure that if i do
not go thei will send an impi here to kill everybodi els and take me
prison the kidnap of noie is onli a first move it is on of two
thing either i must visit zululand save noie and plai my part there as
best i can or we must desert noie and all leav thi place at onc
tomorrow if possibl but then as i told you i shall never forgiv
myself especi as i am not in the least afraid of the zulu
it is true that god can protect you as much in zululand as he can here
repli mr dove begin to weaken in face of thi desper
altern
of cours father but if i go to zululand i want you and mother to trek
to durban and remain there till i return
why rachel it is absurd
becaus i do not think that you ar safe here and it is not at all
absurd she answer stubbornli these peopl choos to believ that i
am in some wai in bondag to you you rememb all their talk about the
heaven and the cloud of cours it mai mean noth but you will be much
better in durban for a while where you can take to the water if
necessari
now mr dove obstinaci assert itself he refus to entertain ani such
idea give reason after reason why he should not do so thu for anoth
half hour the argument rage till at length a compromis wa arriv at
as usual in such case not of too satisfactori an order rachel wa to be
allow to undertak her mission on behalf of noie and her parent were
to remain at ramah on her return which thei hope would be within a week
or eight dai the question of the abandon of the mission wa to be
settl by the help of the experi she had gain to thi arrang
then thei agre reluctantli enough all of them in order to save
noi life and for no other reason
the moment decis onc taken in half an hour rachel wa readi for
her journei which she determin she would make upon her own hors a
grei mare that she had ridden for a long while and could reli on in everi
wai the white ridingox that dingaan had sent as a present wa also to
accompani her to carri her spare garment and other articl pack in
skin bag such as coffe sugar and a few medicin and to serv as a
remount in case anyth should happen to the hors when it wa laden
rachel sent for the zulu tamboosa and point to the ox said
i come to visit dingaan the king and to claim my servant lead the beast
on i will overtak you present
the man salut and began to bonga that is to give her titl of
prais but she cut him short with a wave of her hand and he depart
lead the ox
now while mr dove saw to the saddl of the hors for he wa to ride
with her as far as the tugela rachel went to bid farewel to her mother
she found her by herself in the sittingroom seat at an open window
and look out sadli toward the sea
i am quit readi dear she said in a cheer voic dont look so
sad i shall be back again in a week with noie
ye answer mr dove i think that you and noie will come back
safe but and she paus
but what mother
oh i dont know i am veri much oppress my heart is heavi in me i
hate part with you rachel rememb we have never been separ sinc
you were born
her daughter look at her and wa fill with grief and compunct
mother she said if you feel like thatwel i love noie but after
all you ar more to me than noie and if you wish i will give up thi
busi and stop with you it is veri terribl but it cant be help
noie will understand poor thing and her ey fill with tear at the
thought of the girl dread fate
no rachel somehow i think it best that you should go not onli for
noi sake but for your own if your father would leav here todai or
tomorrow as you suggest it might be otherwis but he wont do that
so it is no us talk of it let us hope for the best
as you wish mother
now dear kiss me and go i hear your father call you and rachel if
we should not meet again in thi world i know you wont forget me or
that there is anoth where we shall i did not want to frighten you with
my fanci which come from my not be well goodby my love goodby
god be with you and make you happi alwaysalwai
then rachel kiss her in silenc for she could not trust herself to
speak and turn left the room whenc her mother watch her go also
in silenc in anoth minut she wa mount and accompani by her
father ride on the road along which tamboosa had led the white ox
present thei overtook him whereon he stop and look at mr dove
said
inkosazana the king order ar that none should accompani you into
zululand
be silent answer rachel proudli he ride with me as far as the
river bank
then thei went on and rachel wa reliev to find that whatev might
have been her mother mood that of her father wa fairli cheer
inde hi mind wa so occupi with the detail and object of her
journei that he quit forgot it danger
two hour steadi ride brought them to the ford of the tugela river
across which lai zululand on the hill beyond it thei could see a number
of kaffir watch who on catch sight of rachel ran down to the
river and enter it shout and beat the water with their stick as
she guess to scare awai ani crocodil that might be lurk there
now that the moment of separ had come mr dove grew loth to part
with hi daughter and again suggest to tamboosa that he should
accompani her to dingaan great place
if you set a foot across that river prai man answer the induna
grimli you shall die look there ar the spear that will kill you
as he spoke he point to the crest of the oppos hill over which
run swiftli in order compani now appear a zulu regiment who
carri larg white shield and wore white plume rise from their head
ring
it is the escort of the inkosazana he ad do you think that she can
take hurt among so mani and do you think if you dare to disobei the
word of dingaan that you can escap so mani go back new lest thei
should come over and kill you where you ar
then see that both argument and resist were useless and that
tamboosa would brook no delai mr dove hurriedli embrac hi daughter in
farewel inde rachel wa glad that there wa no time for word for
thi part wa more terribl to her than she care to own and she

chapter x
the omen of the star
as it chanc and can easili be understood rachel could not have made a
more effect entri into zululand or on more calcul to confirm her
supernatur reput when the wild beast she rode plung about she
had remain seat on it as though she grew there wherea everi warrior
knew that he would have fallen off when the bull charg her that bull
had di slain by the heaven when the isanuzi a witch of reput had
lift voic and hand against her she had command her death show
that she fear no rival magic true the woman would have been kill in
ani case for such wa the order of the king as to all who should dare to
affront the inkosazana yet the captain had wait to see what rachel
would do that thei might judg her accordingli if she had shown fear if
she had even neglect to aveng thei might have marvel whether after
all she were more than a beauti white maiden fill with the wisdom of
the white
now thei knew better she wa a spirit have the power of a spirit over
beast and man who smote as a spirit should the fame of it went
throughout the land and littl chanc thenc forward had rachel of
escap from the shadow of her own fear renown
toward sundown thei came to a kraal set upon a hill and it wa ask of
her if she were pleas to spend the night there she bow her head in
assent and thei enter the kraal it wa quit empti save for certain
maiden dress in bead petticoat who wait there to serv her all the
other inhabit had gone thei took her to a larg and beautifulli clean
hut kneel on their knee the maiden present her with foodmeat
and curdl milk and roast cob of corn she at of the corn and the
milk but the meat she sent awai as a gift to the captain then alon in
that kraal in which after thei had serv her even the girl seem to
fear to stai rachel slept as best she might in such solitud while
without the fenc two thousand arm savag watch over her safeti
it wa a troubl sleep for she dream alwai of that dreadfullook
isanuzi with the fishbladd in her hair yell to her that her path
through life wa water with blood and bid her go back to her own
kraal and see whether the word were true an omin sai of which she
could not read the riddl she dream also of the woman coars furiou
face turn suddenli to on of abject terror and then of the dread end
the red death without merci and without appeal which she had let loos by
a motion of her hand anoth dream she had wa of her father and her
mother who seem to be ly side by side stare toward her with
wideopen ey and that when she spoke to them thei would not answer
so the long night wore awai till at length rachel woke with a start
think that a hand had been laid upon her face to see by the faint
light of dawn which struggl into the hut through the crack of the
doorboard that the hand wa onli a great rat that had crawl over her
and now nibbl at her hair she sat up frighten it and it companion
awai then rose and wash herself with water that stood by in great
gourd while without she heard the women sing some kind of song or hymn
of which she could not catch the word
scarc wa she readi than thei enter the hut salut her and
bring more food rachel at then bade on of them sai to the captain
of the impi that she wa readi to start present the girl return with
the messag that all wa prepar she walk from the kraal to find her
mare which had been well fed and groom by tamboosa who had seen hors
in natal and knew how thei should be treat saddl and wait whilst
befor and behind it arrang as on the previou dai stood the warrior
who receiv her in dead respect silenc
she mount and the process went forward with a two hour halt at
middai thei march on over hill and dale pass mani villag of
beehiveshap hut as thei came the inhabit of these place desert
them and fled cry nomkubulwana nomkubulwana it wa evid to
rachel that the tale of the death of the isanuzi had preced her and
thei fear lest should thei cross her path her fate would be their
fate inde on of the strangest circumst of thi strang adventur
wa the complet loneli in which she live except those who were
actual order to wait upon her none dare come near to rachel she wa
holi a spirit to approach whom unbidden might mean death
at nightfal thei reach anoth empti kraal where again she slept
alon when thei left it in the morn she call tamboosa to her and
ask him at what hour thei would come to dingaan great town
umgugundhlovo which mean the place of the trumpet of the eleph he
answer at sunset
so she rode on all that dai also till as the sun began to sink from a
hill whereon grew larg euphorbia tree on a plain back by mountain
she saw the town surround by a fenc insid of which were thousand of
hut that in their turn surround a great open space now thei push
forward quickli and as dark fell approach the main gate of the
place where as usual there wa no on to be seen but here thei did not
enter march on till thei came to anoth gate that of the intunkulu
the king hous where their escort done the regiment turn and went
awai leav rachel alon with the envoi tamboosa who still led the
white ox thei enter thi gate and present came to a second it wa
that of the emposeni the dwell of the king wive out of which
appear women crawl on the ground befor rachel and hold in their
left hand torch of grass these undid the baggag from the ox and at
their signal for thei did not seem to dare to speak to her rachel
dismount thereon tamboosa salut her and take the hors by the
bridl led it awai with the ox
then rachel felt that she wa inde alon for tamboosa at ani rate had
seen her home which now wa so far awai still proudli enough she
follow the women who bent doubl as befor led her to a great hut lit
by a rude lamp fill with melt hippopotamu fat where thei set down
her bag and depart to return present with food and water
have wash off the dust of her long journei and comb out her hair
rachel at all she could for she wa hungri and guess that she might
need her strength that night then she lai down upon a pile of beauti
kaross that had been place readi for her and rest an hour or more
went by and just as she wa begin to fall asleep the doorboard of
the hut wa thrust asid and a tall woman enter who knelt to her and
said
hail inkosazana the king ask whether it be thy pleasur to appear
befor him thi night
it is my pleasur answer rachel for that purpos have i travel
here lead me to the king
so the woman went out of the hut rachel follow her to find that the
moon shone brightli in a clear sky the woman conduct her through
tortuou reed fenc until present thei came to an open court where in
the shadow of a hut sat a number of men wrap about with fur kaross
guess that she wa in the presenc of dingaan rachel drew her white
cloak round her tall form and walk forward slowli till she reach the
centr of the space where she stop and stood quit still look like
a ghost in the moonlight then all the men to right and left rose and
salut her silent by the uplift of on arm onli he who wa in the
midst of them remain seat and did not salut still she stai
motionless utter no word for a long while six or seven minut
perhap her silenc fought against their and she knew that the on who
spoke first would own to inferior
at length in answer salut she lift the littl wand of white
horn that she carri and turn slowli as though to leav the place so
that now the moonlight glisten on her love hair then fear perhap
lest she should depart or vanish awai the man seat in the centr said
in a low halfaw voic
i am dingaan king of the amazulu sai white on who art thou
by what name am i known here o dingaan the king she repli answer
the question with a question

i hear thee king now as a first fruit give to me noie daughter of
seyapi my slave whom the soldier stole awai from ramah beyond the river
where i dwell
she is dead white on she is dead for her crime answer dingaan
look at her
now rachel heart sank in her for it might well be that a trick had been
plai on her and that thi wa true or perhap thi tale of noi
death wa but a trap to test her power moreov it wa not like that
the king who had promis that she should live would dare to break hi
word to on whom he believ or halfbeliev to be a spirit
for a moment she thought then after her natur determin to be bold
and hazard all upon a throw therefor she did not argu or reproach but
said
she is not dead i have question everi spear in zululand and none of
them is red with her blood
thou art right he answer the spear ar clean she di in the
river
now rachel wa sure and answer in her clear voic
i have question the water and i have question the crocodil and
thei answer that noie ha pass them safe
thou art right white on she di by a rope in yonder hut
now rachel look at the hut and cri
noie i hear thee i see thee i smell thee out come forth noie
the king and hi councillor stare at her whisper to on anoth and
befor ever thei had done their whisper out from among the gloom of
the hut crept noie
to rachel she crept take no heed even of the king and crouch down
in the faint shadow of her that the moonlight threw she flung her arm
about her knee and press her forehead on her feet now rachel heart
bound with joi at the sight of her and she long to bend down and kiss
her but did not lest her great digniti should be lessen in the ey of
the king onli she said
i greet you noie be seat in my shadow where you ar safe and tell
me have these men dealt well by you
not so ill inkosazana that is sinc i reach the great kraal but on
of them he who sit yonder and she point to a certain induna struck
me on the journei and took awai my food
now rachel look at the man angrili plai with the littl wand in her
hand whereon thi induna shiver with terror fear lest she should
point it at him rise he came to rachel and flung himself down befor
her
what have you to sai ask rachel you who have dare to strike my
servant
inkosazana he mumbl the maid wa obstin and tri to run awai
and our order were to bring her to the king spare my life i prai thee
king said rachel i have power over thi man have i not

rachel seem to consid while the poor wretch with chatter teeth
implor her to forgiv then she turn to noie sai
he struck you not me i give him to you to do by as you will shall he
sleep tonight with the live or the dead
noie look at him and next at a mark on her arm and the induna ceas
from hi prayer to rachel clutch noie by the ankl and beg her
merci
your life ha been given to you he said give mine to me lest
illfortun follow you
do you rememb ask noie contemptu how when you had beaten
me yonder by the tugela you said you hope that it would be your luck to
put a spear through thi heart of mine and do you rememb that i
answer you that the spear would be over your own heart first and that
thereon you call me daughter of wizard and struck me againm the
child of seyapi upon whom the mantl of the inkosazana li me who have
drunk of her wisdom and of hisyou struck me you dog and lift her
foot she spurn him in the face
now the king and hi compani conclud that the thing wa finish
glanc at rachel to see her point with the rod and thu give the man to
death but rachel wait sure that noie had not done moreov whatev
noie might sai she had determin to save him

a dog and dog i rememb that you have children among them a daughter
of my own ag whom i saw come out to greet you for her sake then take
your life and with it thi new name that i give

so the man rose and weak with shame and the agoni of suspens crept
swiftli from the place fear lest the inkosazana or her servant might
chang her mind and kill him after all but noi name clung to him so
close that at length unabl to bear the ridicul of it he and hi
famili fled from zululand
so thi matter end
now the king spoke sai

here a few dai
so she rose and bath herself and wa dress by noie and at of the
food that had been brought to the door of the hut then she went out and
in the littl courtyard found a litter wait that wa hung round with
grass mat
the king word is that you should enter the litter said noie
she did so whereon noie clap her hand and girl in bead dress ran
in and have prostrat themselv befor the litter lift it up and
carri it awai noie walk at it side
rachel peep between the mat saw that she wa born out of the town
surround but at a distanc by a guard of hundr of arm men
present thei began to ascend a hill whereon grew mani tree and after
climb it for a while reach a larg kraal with hut between the outer
and inner fenc and in it centr a great space of parklik land through
which ran a stream
here by the bank of the stream stood a larg new hut and behind at a
littl distanc two or three other hut in front of thi great hut the
litter wa set down by the bearer who at onc went awai then at noi
bid rachel came out of it and look at the place which had been given
her in which to dwell
it wa a beauti spot awai from the dust and the nois of the great
kraal and so place upon a shoulder of the hillsid that the soldier who
guard thi hous of the inkosazana as it wa call could not be seen
or heard yet rachel look at it with distast feel that it wa that
cage of which noie had spoken
a cage it prove inde a solitari cage for here rachel abod in regal
seclus and in state that could onli be call aw no man might
approach her hous unbidden and the maiden who wait upon her did so
with downcast ey never speak and fall on to their knee if
address on the first dai of her imprison for it wa noth less
an unhappi zulu through ignor or folli slip through the outer
guard and came near to the inner fenc rachel who wa seat abov
heard some shout of rage and horror and saw soldier run toward
him and in anoth minut a bodi be carri awai upon a shield he had
di for hi sacrileg
onc a dai ambassador came to her from the king to ask of her health and
if she had order to give but now even these men were not allow to
look upon her thei were led in by the women each of them with a piec of
bark cloth over hi head and from beneath thi cloth thei address her
as though she were in truth divin on the first dai she bade them tell
the king that her mission be end it wa her desir to depart to her
own home beyond the river thei heard her word in silenc then ask if
she had anyth to add she repliedy it wa her will that thei
should ceas to wear veil in her presenc also that no more men should
be kill upon her account as had happen that morn thei said that
thei would convei the order at onc as sever were under sentenc of
death who had argu as to whether she were realli the inkosazana so she
sent them awai instantli fear lest thei should be too late and thei
were led off backward bow and give the royal salut afterward she
rejoic to hear that her command had arriv just in time and that the
blood of these poor peopl wa not upon her head
next dai the messeng return at the same hour unveil as she
desir bear the answer of the king and hi council it wa to the
effect that the inkosazana had no need to ask permiss to come or to go
her spirit thei knew wa mighti and could wander where it will all
the impi of the zulu could not hold her sprint butand here came the
sting of thi clever answerit wa necessari until her sai had been
consid that the bodi in which that spirit abod should remain with
them a while therefor the king and hi counsellor and the whole nation
of the zulu prai her to be satisfi with the send of her spirit
across the tugela leav her bodi to dwell a space in the hous of the
inkosazana
rachel look at them in despair for what wa she to repli to such
reason as thi befor she could make up her mind their spokesman said
that a white man ibubesi who said that he had often spoken with her
ask leav to visit her in her hous
now rachel thought a while ishmael wa the last person in the whole world
whom she wish to see after the interview when thei part and all that
had happen sinc it could not be otherwis she rememb the threat
he had utter then and to her father afterward the brutal and
revolt threat some of these had been direct against noie and
subsequ noie wa kidnap by the zulu that those direct at
herself had not been fulfil wa she felt sure due to a lack of
opportun alon
littl wonder then that she fear and hate the man still he wa of
white blood and perhap for thi reason had author among the zulu
who as she knew often consult him moreov notwithstand hi
vapour like the zulu whose superstit he had contract he
look upon herself with someth akin to fear if she saw him she had no
caus to dread anyth that he could do to her at ani rate in thi
countri where she wa suprem wherea on the other hand she might obtain
inform from him which would be veri us or make us of him to
enabl her to escap from zululand on the whole then it seem wisest
to grant him an interview especi as she gather from the fact that
the question wa rais by dingaan induna that for some reason of hi
own the king hope that she would do so
still she hesit loath and despis him as she did
you have heard she said in english to noie who stood behind her now
what shall i sai
saycom answer noie in the same tongu
read hi black heart and find out truth he no can keep it from you
saycom with soldier if he behav bad tell them kill him thei obei
you no mind me i not afraid of that wild beast now
then rachel said to the induna
i hear the king word and understand that he wish me to receiv thi
ibubesi yet i know that man as i know all men white and black he is an
evil man and it is not my pleasur to speak with him alon let him come
with a guard of six captain and let the captain be arm with spear
so that if i give the word there mai be an end of thi ibubesi
then the messeng salut and depart as befor
on the morrow at about the same hour a praiser or herald arriv
outsid the inner fenc of the kraal and after he had shout out
rachel titl attribut beauti and supernatur power for at least
ten minut never repeat himself announc that the induna of the
king were without accompani by the white man ibubesi await her
permiss to enter she gave it through noie and the horn wand in her
hand seat herself upon a carv stool in front of the great hut
present an alterc aros upon the further side of the reed fenc in
which she recognis ishmael strident voic mingl with the deeper
tone of the zulu who seem to be insist upon someth
thei command him to take off hi headdress said noie and threaten to
beat him if he will not
go tell them to admit him as he is that i mai see hi face and learn
if he be the white man whom i knew or anoth answer rachel and she
went
then the gate wa open and the messeng were led in by women after
these came six captain carri broad spear as she had command and
last of all ishmael himself rachel whole natur shrank at the sight of
hi dark handsom featur she loath the man now as alwai her
instinct warn her of danger at hi hand also she rememb hi
threat when last thei met and she reject him and what had pass
between him and her father on the follow dai but of all thi she
show noth remain seat in silenc with calm set face
ishmael wa advanc with a somewhat defiant air except for a kaross
upon hi shoulder he wore european dress and the ridicul hat with the
white ostrich feather in it both of them now much the wors for wear
which she rememb so well also he had a light pipe in hi mouth
present on of the captain appear to becom suddenli awar of thi
pipe for stretch out hi hand he snatch it awai and the hat with
it throw them upon the ground ishmael whose teeth and lip were
hurt turn on the man with an oath and struck him whereon instantli he
wa seiz and would perhap have been kill befor rachel could
interfer had it not been unlaw to shed blood in her presenc as it
wa with a motion of her wand she signifi that he wa to be loos a
command that noie interpret to them at ani rate thei let him go
though a captain place hi feet on the hat and pipe then ishmael came
forward and said awkwardli
how do you do i did not expect to see you here and he devour her
beauti with hi bold greedi ey though not without doubt and dread or
so thought rachel
take no notic of hi greet she said in a cold voic
i have sent for you here to ask if you have ani reason as to why i should
not order you to be kill for your crime against my servant noie and
therefor against me
now ishmael pale for he had not expect such a welcom and began to
deni the thing
spare your falsehood went on rachel i have it from the king lip
and from my own knowledg rememb onli that here i am the inkosazana
with power of life and death if i speak the word or point at you with
thi wand in a minut you will have gone to your account
inkosazana or not he answer in a cow voic you know too much

life and you see that the plan wa good for you came and he ad
recov some of hi insol and familiar we ar here togeth

i wish it would speak to me and tell me when i can go home said rachel
with a sigh
it would if it could zoola but it cannot becaus the curtain is too
thick had all you love been slain befor your ey then the veil would
be worn thin as mine is and through it you who ar akin to them would
hear the talk of the ghost and dimli see them wander beneath their
tree
beneath their tree

chapter xii
rachel see a vision
that even ishmael wa brought befor the king he wa in evil case for
the captain some of whom had grudg against him when he tri to break
awai from them outsid the gate had beaten him with their spear shaft
nearli all the wai from the kraal to the great place remark that he
fought and remonstr that the inkosazana had forbidden them to kill
him but had said noth as to give him the flog which he deserv
hi cloth were torn hi hat and pipe were lostinde hour befor
noie had thrown both of them into the firehi ey were black from the
blow of a heavi stick and he wa bruis all over
such wa hi appear when he wa thrust befor dingaan seeth with
rage which he could scarc suppress even in that presenc
did you visit the inkosazana todai white man ask the king blandli
while the induna stare at him with grim amus
then ishmael broke out into a recit of hi wrong demand that the
captain who had beaten him a white man and a great person should be
kill
silenc said dingaan at length the question nightprowl is
whether you should not be kill you dog who dare to insult the
inkosazana by offer yourself to her as a husband had she command you
to be spear she would have done well and if you troubl me with your
shout i will send you to sleep with the jackal tonight without
wait for her word
now see hi danger ishmael wa silent and the king went on
did you discov as i bade you why it is that the inkosazana desir to
leav us
ye king it is becaus she would return to her own peopl the old
prayerdoctor and hi wife
thei ar not her peopl exclaim dingaan we know that she came to
them out of the storm and that thei ar but the fosterpar chosen for
her by the heaven you were the first to tell us that stori and how she
caus the lightn to burn up my soldier yonder at ramah we ar her
peopl and no other can the inkosazana have a father and a mother
i dont know answer ishmael but she is a woman and i never knew a
woman who wa without them at least i am sure that she look upon them as
her father and mother obei them in all thing and that she will never
leav them while thei live unless thei command her to do so
dingaan stare at him with hi piglik ey repeat after himwhil
thei live unless thei command her to do so then he ask
if the inkosazana desir to go who is there that dare to stai her and
if she put out her magic who is there that ha the power if a hand is
lift against her will she not lai a curs on us and bring destruct
upon us
i dont know answer ishmael again but if she goe back among the
white folk and is angri i think that she will bring the boer upon you
now dingaan face grew veri troubl and bid ishmael stand back
awhil he consult with hi council then he said
listen to me white man it would be a veri evil thing if the inkosazana
were to leav us for with her would go the spirit of our peopl and
their good luck so sai the witchdoctor with on voic and i believ
them further it is our desir that she should remain with us a while
thi dai the council of the divin ha spoken sai that the word of
the inkosazana which she utter here ar too hard for them and that
other doctor of a peopl who live far awai must be sent for and brought
face to face with her therefor here at umgugundhlovo she should abid
until thei come
inde answer ishmael indiffer
in the doctor who dwell far awai and the council of the divin he had
no belief but understand the nativ as he did he guess correctli
enough that the latter found themselv in a cleft stick work on by
their superstit which he had first awaken for hi own end thei
had accept rachel as someth more than human as the incarn of
the spirit of their peopl thi mopo who wa said to have kill chaka
by command of that spirit had acknowledg her to be and therefor thei
did not dare to declar that her word spoken as an oracl were empti
word but neither did thei dare to interpret the sai that she meant
that no attack must be made upon the boer and should be obei
to do thi would be to fly in the face of the martial aspir of the
nation and the secret wish of the king and perhap if war ultim
broke out would cost them their live so it came about that thei
announc that thei could not understand her sai and had decid to
thrust off the respons on to the shoulder of some other divin
though who these men might be ishmael neither knew nor took the troubl to
ask
but went on the king who can forc the dove to build in a tree that
doe not pleas it see that it ha wing and can fly awai yet if it
own tree that in which it wa rear from the nest could be brought to
it it might be pleas to abid there do you understand white man
no answer ishmael though in fact he understood well enough that the
king wa plai upon rachel english name of dove and that he meant
that her home might be move into zululand no the inkosazana is not a
bird and who can carri tree about
have the spearshaft knock the wit out of you ibubesi ask
dingaan impati or ar you drunk with beer learn then my mean
the inkosazana will not stai becaus her home is yonder therefor it must
be brought here and she will stai at first i gave order that if thi old
white teacher and hi wife tri to accompani her thei should be kill
now i eat up those word thei must come to zululand
how will you persuad them to be such fool ask ishmael
how did i persuad the inkosazana herself to come wa it not to seek on
whom she love
thei will think that you have kill her and wish to kill them also
no becaus you will go in command of an impi and show them otherwis
i cannot go your brute of captain have hurt my head and lame me i
cannot walk or ride
then you can be carri in a litter or he ad threateningli you
can abid here with the vultur the inkosazana is merci but why
should i not aveng her wrong upon you white dog who have dare to
scratch at the kraal gate of the inkosazanayzoola
now ishmael saw that he had no choic also a dark thought rose dimli in
hi mind he desir to win rachel abov everyth on earth he wa mad
with loveor what he understood as loveof her and thi busi might
be work to hi advantag moreov to stai wa death so he fell to
bargain for a reward for hi servic a larg reward in cattl and
ivori half of it to be paid down at onc and it wa promis to him
then he took hi instruct these were that he wa to travel to the
mission station of ramah in command of a small impi of three hundr men
whose onli order would be that thei were to obei him in all thing that
he wa to tell the umfundusi who wa call shouter that if thei wish
to see her ani more he and hi wife must come to dwell with the
inkosazana in zululand that if thei refus he wa to bring them by
forc if perchanc the inkosazana choos to exercis her author
cross the tugela and reach ramah befor he could do thi he wa still
to bring them for then she would follow in the same wai if the shouter
and hi wife met her on the road thei were to travel on for then she
would turn and accompani them he wa to go at onc and execut these
order
i hear said ishmael and will start as soon as the cattl have been
deliv and sent on with the ivori to my kraal mafooti
there wa someth in the man voic or in the look of low cun
which spread itself over hi face that attract dingaan attent
the cattl and the ivori shall be sent he said sternli but ill shall
it be for you ibubesi if you seek to trick me in thi matter you have
grown rich on my bounti and yonder at your place mafooti you have mani
cow mani wive mani childrenmi spi have given me count of all of
them now if you plai me fals or if you dare to lift a finger against
the white on know that i will burn that kraal and slai the inhabit
with the spear and take the cattl and when i catch you ibubesi i will
kill you slowli slowli i have spoken go
i go great eleph calf of the black cow and i will obei in all
thing answer ishmael in a humbl voic for he wa frighten the
white peopl shall be brought onli i trust to you to protect me from the
anger of the inkosazana for all that i mai do
you must make your own peac with the inkosazana answer dingaan and
turn he crept into hi hut
an hour later the great induna tamboosa appear at rachel kraal and
crave leav to speak with her

lead me out of zululand tamboosa

so noie went
two hour after sundown while rachel wa eat her even meal in her
great hut attend by the maiden the doorboard wa drawn asid and
noie enter salut and sat down rachel sign to the women to clear
awai the food and depart when thei had gone she ask what the king
busi wa eagerli enough for she hope that it had to do with her
leav zululand
it is a long stori zoola answer noie but here is the heart of it
i told you when first we met that i am not of thi peopl although my
mother wa a zulu i told you that i am of the dreampeopl the
ghostpeopl the littl greypeopl who live awai to the north beneath
their tree and worship their tree
ye answer rachel and that is why you care noth for men as other
women do but dream dream and talk with spirit but what of it
that is why i dream dream and talk with spirit as on dai i hope that
i shall teach you to do you whose soul is sister to my soul repli
noie her larg ey shine strang in her delic face and thi of
itth ghostpeopl ar divin thei can read the futur and see the
heart of men there ar no divin like them therefor chief and
peopl who dwell far awai send to them with great gift and prai them
come read their fate but thei will seldom listen or obei now dingaan and
hi councillor ar troubl about thi matter of the boer and the
mean of the word you spoke as to their wage war on them and of the
omen of the fall star the council of the doctor can interpret none of
these thing nor dare thei ask you to do so sinc you bade them speak no
more to you of that matter and thei know that if thei did either you
would not answer or wors still sai word that would displeas them
thei ar right there said rachel to have to plai the dark oracl onc
is enough for me if i speak again it shall be plainli
therefor thei have bethought them of the dealer in dream and desir to
bring you face to face with their prophet the ghostk that these
mai see your great and tell them the mean of your word and of the
omen that you caus to travel through the ski
do you mean that thei wish me to visit these ghostk noie
not so zoola for then thei must part with your presenc thei wish that
the priest of the ghostk should visit you bear with them the
word of the mother of the tree
visit me how can thei who will bring them here
thei wish that i should bring them for as thei know i am of their
blood and i alon can talk their languag which my father taught me from
a child
but noie that would moan that we must be separ said rachel in
alarm
ye it would mean that still i think it best that you should humour
them and let me go for otherwis i do not know how you will ever escap
from zululand now i told the king that i thought you would permit it on
on condit onlythat after you had been brought face to face with the
priest of the ghostk and thei had interpret your riddl you
should be escort whenc you came and he answer that it should be so
and that meanwhil you could abid here in honour peac and safeti
moreov he promis that a messeng should be sent to ramah to explain
the reason of your delai
but how long will you be on the journei noie and what if these prophet
of your refus to visit dingaan
i cannot tell you who have never travel that road but i will march
fast and if i tire swift runner shall bear me in a litter to those who
have the secret of it gate that countri is not so veri far awai also
the old mother of the tree is my father aunt and i think that the
prophet will come at my prayer or at the least send the answer to the
question inde i am sure of itask me not why
still for a long while rachel reason against thi separ which she
dread while noie reason for it she point out that here at least
none could harm her as thei had seen in the treatment mete out to
ishmael a white man whom the zulu look upon as their friend also she
said with convict that these mysteri ghostk were veri power
and could free her from the clutch of the zulu and protect her from
them afterward as thei would do when thei came to know her case
the end of it wa that rachel gave wai not becaus noi argument
convinc her but becaus she wa sure that she had other reason she did
not choos to advanc
from that dai when each of them toss up a hair from her head at ramah
notwithstand the differ of their race and circumst these two
had been as sister rachel believ in noie more perhap than in ani
other live be and thu also did noie believ in rachel thei knew
that their destini were intertwin and were sure that not river or
mountain or the will and violenc of men could keep them separ
i see said rachel at length that you believ that my fate hang
upon thi embassi of your
i do believ it answer noie confid
then go but come back as swiftli as you mai for my sister i know not
how without you i shall live on in thi lone great and she took
her in her arm and kiss her lip
afterward as thei were lai themselv down to sleep rachel ask her
if she had heard anyth about ishmael she answer that she learn at
the great kraal that he had been brought befor the king that afternoon
and then taken back to hi hut where he wa under guard on of her
escort told her too that sinc he saw the king ibubesi had fallen veri
sick it wa thought from a blow that he had receiv at the hous of
inkosazana and that now he wa out of hi mind and be attend by the
doctor i wish ad noie vicious that he were out of hi bodi
also for then much sorrow would be spare but that cannot be befor the
time
on the next dai befor noon noie depart upon her journei rachel sent
for the captain of her escort and the isanusi or doctor who were to
accompani her and in a few stern word gave her into their charg sai
that thei should answer for her safeti with their live to which thei
repli that thei knew it and would do so if ani harm came to the
daughter of seyapi through their fault thei were prepar to die then
she talk for a long while with noie tell her all she knew of the
boer and the purpos of their wander that she might be abl to
repeat it to her peopl and show them how dread would be a war between
thi white folk and the zulu
noie answer that she would give her messag but that it wa needless
sinc the ghostk could see all that pass in the bowl of water
beneath their tree and doubtless knew alreadi of her come and of the
caus of it a repli of which rachel had not time to inquir the mean
after thi thei embrac and part not without some tear
when the gate shut behind noie rachel walk to the high ground at the
back of her hut whenc she could see over the fenc of the kraal and
watch her departur she had an escort of a hundr pick soldier
with whom went fifti or sixti strong bearer who carri food kaross
and a litter also there were three doctor of magic and medicin and two
women widow of high rank who were to attend upon her at the head of
thi process save for two guid walk noie herself with sandal on
her feet a white robe about her shoulder and in her hand a littl bough
on which grew shine leav whereof rachel did not know the mean she
watch them until thei pass over the brow of the hill on the crest of
which noie turn and wave the bough toward her then rachel went back
to her hut and sat there alon and wept
thi wa the begin of mani dread dai most of which she pass
wander about within the circuit of the kraal fenc a space of some
three or four acr or seat under the shadow of certain beauti
tree which overhung a deep clear pool of the stream that ran through
the kraal a reedfring pool whereon float bloom lili that quiet
water the happi bird that nest in the tree and the flower lili
seem to be her onli friend of the last inde she would count the
bud watch them open in the morn and close again for their sleep at
night until a dai came when their loveli turn to decai and other
appear in their place
on the morrow of noi departur tamboosa and other induna visit her
and ask her if she would not descend to the kraal of the king and help
him and hi council to try case sinc while she wa in the land she wa
it first judg she answer no that place smelt too much of blood
if thei had case for her to try let them be brought befor her in her
own hous thi she said idli think no more of it but next dai wa
astonish to learn that the plaintiff and defend in a great suit with
their respect advoc and from thirti to forti wit were
wait without to know when it wa her pleasur to attend to their
busi
with characterist courag rachel answer now her knowledg of law
wa it is true limit to what for lack of anyth more excit she
had read in some handbook belong to her father who had been a justic
of the peac in the cape coloni and to a few case which she had seen
tri in a roughandreadi fashion at durban to which must be ad an
intim acquaint with kaffir custom still be possess with a
sincer desir to discov the truth and execut justic she did veri
well the matter in disput wa a larg on that of the ownership of a
great herd of cattl which wa claim as an inherit by each of the
parti rachel soon discov that both these men were veri power
chief and that the reason of their caus be remit to her wa that
the king knew that if he decid in favour of either of them he would
mortal offend the other
for a long while rachel seat on her stool listen silent to the
impass plead of the plaintiff lawyer present thi plaintiff
wa call as a wit and in the cours of hi evid said someth
which convinc her that he wa ly then break her silenc for the
first time she ask him how he dare to give fals wit befor the
inkosazanayzoola to whom the truth wa alwai open and who wa
acquaint with everi circumst connect with the cattl in disput
the man see her ey fix upon him and be convinc of her
supernatur power grew afraid broke down and publicli confess hi
attempt fraud into which he said he had been led by envi of hi cousin
the defend rich
rachel gave judgment accordingli command that he should pai the cost
in cattl and a fine to the king and warn him to be more upright in
futur the result wa that her fame as a judg spread throughout the
land and everi dai her gate were beset with suitor whose caus she
dealt with to the best of her abil and to their entir satisfact
crimin prosecut that involv the deathsent or matter
connect with witchcraft howev she steadili refus to try sai
that the inkosazana should not caus blood to flow these thing she left
to the king and hi council confin herself to such action as in
england would come befor the court of chanceri thu to her reput as
a spiritu queen rachel ad that of an upright judg who could not be
influenc by fear or bribe the first perhap that had ever been known
in zululand
but she could not try such case all dai the strain wa too great
although in the end most of them partook of the natur of arbitr
sinc the parti involv have come to the conclus that it wa not
possibl to deceiv on so wise grew truth and submit their
differ to the decis of her wisdom
after thei were dismiss which wa alwai at noon for she open her
court at seven and would not sit more than five hour rachel wa left in
her solitari state until the next morn and oh the hour hung heavili
upon her hand a messeng wa despatch to ramah but after ten dai he
return sai that the tugela wa in flood and he could not cross it
she sent him out again and a week later wa told that he had been kill
by a lion on hi journei then anoth messeng wa chosen but what
becam of him she never knew
it wa about thi time that rachel learn that ishmael have recov
from hi sick had escap from umgugundhlovo by night whither none
seem to know from that moment fear gather thick upon the poor girl
she dread ishmael and guess that hi departur without commun
with her bode her no good inde onc or twice she almost wish that
she had taken noi counsel and given him over to the justic of the
king meanwhil of noie herself noth had been heard she had vanish
into the wilder
live thi strang and most unnatur life rachel nerv began to give
wai while she tri her case she seem stern and calm but when the
crowd of humbl suitor had dispers from the outer court in which she
sat as a judg and the shout of the praiser rush up and down beyond
the fenc and roar out her titl had di awai and have dismiss
the obsequi maiden who wait upon her she retir to the solitud of
her hut to restah then it wa differ then she lai down upon her bed
of rich fur and at time burst into tear becaus she who seem to be a
supernatur queen wa realli but a white girl desert by god and man
now it wa the season of thunderstorm and almost everi afternoon these
dread tempest broke over her kraal which shook in the roll and crash
of the meet cloud while beyond the fenc the jag lightn struck
and struck again upon the ironston of the hillsid
she had never fear such storm befor but now thei terrifi her she
dread their advent and the worst of it wa that she must not show her
dread she who wa suppos to rule and direct the lightn inde the
bounteou rain which fell ensur a full harvest after sever year of
drought were univers attribut to the good influenc of her presenc
in the land in the same wai when a thunderbolt struck the hut of a doctor
who but a dai or two befor had openli declar hi disbelief in her
power kill him and hi princip wife and destroi hi kraal by
fire the accid wa attribut to her vengeanc or to that of the
heaven who were angri at thi lack of faith after thi remark
exhibit of supernatur strength needless to sai the voic of advers
critic wa stai rachel becam suprem
but the storm pass and when thei had roll awai at length do her
no hurt and the sun shone out again she would go and sit beneath the
tree at the edg of the beauti pool until the close lili and the
chill of the air told her that night drew on
oh those long nightshow endless thei seem to rachel in her
loneli now she who us to sleep so well could not sleep or when
she slept she dream she dream of her mother alwai of her mother
that she wa ill and call her until she came to believ that in truth
thi wa so so much did thi convict work upon her mind that she
determin not to wait for the return of noie but at all cost to try to
leav zululand and through tamboosa declar her will to the king
next morn the answer cam back that of cours none could control her
movement but if she would go she must fly as all the river were in
flood as she might see if she would walk to the top of the mountain
behind her kraal tamboosa ad that a compani of men who had been sent
to recaptur ishmael were kept for a week upon the bank of the first of
them and at length be unabl to cross had return as her messeng
had done know from other sourc that thi wa true rachel made no
answer what she did not know howev wa that ishmael had cross the
smaller river befor the flood came down and gone on to meet the
soldier who were order to await him on the bank of the tugela
escap wa evid imposs at present and if it had been otherwis
clearli the zulu did not mean to let her go she must abid here in the
compani of her terror and her dream
at length happili for her these distress dream of rachel began to
be vari by other of a pleasant complexion of which although thei
were vivid enough she could onli rememb upon wake that thei had to do
with richard darrien the companion of her adventur in the river of whom
she had heard noth for so mani year for aught she knew he might have
di long ago and yet she did not think that he wa dead well if he
live he might have forgotten her and yet she did not believ that he had
forgotten her he who as a boi had wish to follow her all hi life and
whom she had thought of dai by dai from that hour to thi ye she had
thought of him but not thu why at such a time did he aris in
strength befor her seem to occupi all her soul why wa her mind
never free of him could it be that thei were about to meet again she
shiver as the hope took hold of her shiver with joi and rememb
that her mother had alwai said that thei would meet could it be that he
of all men on the earth for if he live he wa a man now wa come to
rescu her oh then she would fear noth then in everi peril she would
feel safe as a child in it mother arm no the thing wa too happi to
come about her imagin plai trick with her no more and yet and
yet why did he haunt her sleep
the dreari dai went on a month had pass sinc noie vanish over
yonder ridg and worst of all for three night the dream of richard had
depart while those of her mother remain
rachel wa worn out she wa in despair all that morn she had spent in
try a long and heavi case which occupi but weari her mind on of
those etern case about the inherit of cattl which were claim by
three brother descend of differ wive of a grandfath who had
own the herd final she had effect a compromis between the parti
and amidst their salut and acclam retir to her hut but she
could not eat the same of the food disgust her neither could she
rest for the daili tempest wa come up and the heavi atmospher or
the electr with which it wa charg and the overpow heat
exasper her nervou system and made sleep imposs at length came
the usual rush of ici wind and the burst of the great storm the
thunder crash and bellow the lightn flicker and flare the rain
fell in a torrent it pass as it alwai did and the sun shone out
again gasp with relief rachel went out of the ovenlik hut into the
cool sweet air and sat down upon a tan bull hide which she had
order her servant to spread for her by the pool of water upon the bank
beneath the tree it wa veri pleasant here and the raindrop shaken
from the wet leav fell upon her fever face and hand and refresh
her
she tri to forget her troubl for a littl while and began to think of
richard darrien her boylov of a longpast hour wonder what he
look like now that he wa grown to be a man
if onli you would come to help me oh richard if onli you would come to
help me the poor wornout girl murmur to herself and so murmur
fell asleep
suddenli it seem to her that she wa wide awak and stare into a part
of the pool beneath her where the bottom wa of granit and the water
clear in thi water she saw a pictur she saw a great laager of waggon
and outsid of on of them a group of beard joviallook men smoke
and talk present anoth man of sturdi build and resolut carriag
who wa follow by a weari kaffir walk up to them hi back wa
toward her so that she could not see hi face but now she wa abl to
hear all that wa said although the voic seem thin and far awai
what is it nephew ask the oldest of the beard men speak in
dutch why ar you in such a hurri
thi uncl he answer in the same languag and in a pleasant voic
that sound familiar to rachel ear that spy quabi whom we sent out
a long time ago and who wa report dead reach dingaan kraal and
ha come back with a strang stori
almighti grunt the old man all these spi have strang stori
but let him tell it speak on swartzel footnot blackfellow
then the tire spy began to talk tell a long tale he describ how
he had got into zululand and reach umgugundhlovo and lodg there with
a rel of hi and done hi best to collect inform as to the
attitud of the king and induna toward the boer while he wa there the
new came that the white spirit who wa call inkosazanayzoola wa
approach the kraal from natal where she dwelt with her parent who

almighti interrupt the old man again what rubbish is thi how can
a spirit white or black have parent who ar teacher
the wearylook spy answer that he did not know it wa not for him to
answer riddl all he knew wa that there wa great excit about the
come of thi queen of the heaven and he be desir of obtain
firsthand inform slip out of the town with hi rel and
walk more than a dai journei on the path that ran to the tugela till
thei came to a place where thei hid themselv to see her pass thi place
he describ with minut so minut inde that in her dream
rachel recognis it well it wa the spot where the witchdoctoress had

white hors and surround by an impi he describ her beauti her white
cloak her hair hang down her back the rod of horn she carri in her

and where is she now ask the old dutchman
there at umgugundhlovo he answer rule the land as it head

i think that we should find out more about thi woman especi as she

go and learn the truth
i will go said the young man who had brought in the spy and as he
spoke he turn and lo hi face wa the face of richard darrien

why do you offer to undertak so danger a mission ask the boer
look at the young man kindli is it becaus you wish to see thi
beauti white witch of whom yonder quabi tell us such li nephew
the shadow of richard nod and hi face redden for the boer around

maid and i am go to begin to look for her across the river yonder
as the word reach whatev sens of rachel it wa that heard them of
a sudden in an instant laager boer and richard vanish in her sleep
she tri to recreat them at first without avail then the curtain of
dark appear to lift and in the still water of the pool she saw
anoth pictur that of richard darrien mount on a black hors with on
white foot ride along a nativ path through a bushclad countri while
by hi side trot the spy whose name wa quabi

for on second onli rachel saw and heard these thing then thei too
pass awai and she awok to see in front of her the pool empti save for
it lili and abov to hear the whisper of the even wind among the
tree
chapter xiii
richard come
as the sun set rachel rose and walk to her hut she wa utterli daze
she could not understand wa thi but a fiction of an overwrought and
disord mind or had she seen a vision of thing pass or that had
pass far awai if it were a dream then thi wa but anoth drop in
her cup of bitter if a true visionoh then what did it mean to her
it meant that richard darrien live richard of whom her heart had been
full for year it meant that hi heart wa full of her also for had she
not seem to hear him sai that he had travel from the cape with the
boer to look for her and wa he not journei alon through a hostil
land to pursu hi search who would do such a thing for the sake of a
girl unlessunless it meant that he would protect her would rescu her
from her terribl plight would take her from among these savag to her
home againoh and perhap much more that she did not dare to pictur to
herself
yet how could such thing be thei were contrari to experi at ani
rate to the experi of white folk though nativ would believ in
them easili enough yet in natur thing might be possibl which were
gener held to be imposs her mother had certain giftshad she
perhap inherit them had her helpless appeal to the piti of some
higher power had her ceaseless prayer been heard yet why should the
univers law be stretch for her why should she be allow to lift a
corner of the black veil of ignor that hem us in and see a glimps
of what li beyond if richard were realli come in a dai or two she
would have learn of hi arriv natur there wa no need that these
mysteri influenc should be set to work to inform her of hi approach
how selfish she wa the warn might concern him not her it wa
probabl enough that the zulu would kill a solitari white man especi
if thei discov that he propos to visit their inkosazana well she
had the power to protect him if she threw her mantl over him no man
in all the land would dare to do him violenc sure it wa for thi
reason that she had been allow to learn these thing if she had learn
them not for her own sake but hi if she had learn them well she
would take the risk would run the chanc of failur and of mockeri ye
and of the loss of her power among these peopl it should be done at
onc
rachel clap her hand and a maiden appear whom she bade summon the
captain of the guard without the gate present he came surround by a
band of her women sinc no man might visit the inkosazana alon bid
him to ceas from hi salut she command him to go swiftli to the
great place and prai of dingaan that he would send her an escort and a
litter as she must see him that night on a matter which would not brook
delai
in an hour just after she had finish her food which she at with more
appetit than she had known for dai it wa report that thei were

the litter and guard by a hundr men wa born swiftli to the hous
of dingaan at it gate she descend and onc more enter that court by
the moonlight
as befor there sat the king and hi induna without the great hut and
while she walk toward them everi man rose cry hail inkosazana

stool and salut her rachel acknowledg the salut by rais her
wand motion to them to be seat and wait
art thou come white on ask dingaan to make clear those dark word

ye have told me that the river were in flood that the beast i rode wa
sick that evil would befal the land if i desert you now i know and
ye know that if it pleas me i could have depart when and whither i
would but it wa not fit that the inkosazana should creep out of
zululand like a thief in the night so i abod on in my hous yonder yet
my heart grew wrath with you and i to whom the white peopl listen also
wa half mind to bring hither the thousand of the amaboona who ar
encamp beyond the buffalo river that thei might escort me to my home
now at these bold word the king look uneasi and on of the councillor
whisper to anoth
how know she that the white men ar camp beyond the buffalo
yet went on rachel i did not do so for then there must have been
much fight and bloodsh and blood i hate but i have done thi with
these amaboona travel an english chief a young man on darrien whom i
knew from long year ago and who doe me rever him then i have
command to journei hither and to lead me to my own place across the
tugela tonight i am told he sleep a short three dai journei from thi
town and i am come here to bid you send out swift messeng to guid him
hither
she ceas and thei stare at her awhil then the king ask
what messeng is it inkosazana that thou hast sent to thi white
chief dario we have seen none pass from thy hous
dost thou think then king that thou canst see my messeng my
thought flew from me to him and call in hi ear in the night and i
saw hi come in the still pool that li near my hut
ow exclaim on of the council she sent her thought to him like
bird and she saw hi come in the water of the pool great is the magic
of the inkosazana
the chief darrien went on rachel without heed the interrupt
although she note that it wa mopo of the wither hand who had spoken
from beneath the blanket wrap about hi head mai be known thu he is
fair of face with ey like my ey and beard and hair of the colour of
gold if i saw right he ride upon a black hors with on white foot and
hi onli companion is a kaffir name quabi who i think and she pass
her hand across her forehead ye who wa sure visit a relat of
hi at thi the great place when i cross the tugela
now the king ask if ani knew of thi quabi and an induna answer in an
aw voic that it wa true that a man so call had been in the town at
the time given by the inkosazana stai with a soldier whose name he
mention but who wa now awai on servic he had howev depart
befor the inkosazana arriv or so he believ whither he knew not
i thought it wa so went on rachel as i saw him in the pool he is a
thin man whose shoulder stoop and whose beard is white although hi
hair is black he wear no ring upon hi head
that is the man said the induna be a stranger i note him well as
it wa my busi to do
summon the messeng swiftli king went on rachel and let them
depart at onc for know that thi white chief and hi servant ar under
the protect of the heaven and if harm come to them then i lai my
curs upon the land and it shall break up in blood and ruin bid them sai
to darrien that the inkosazanayzoola she who stood with him onc on
the rock in the river while the lightn fell and the lion roar about
them send him greet and await him
now dingaan turn to an induna and said
go do the bid of the inkosazana bid swift runner search out thi
white chief and lead him to her hous and rememb that if aught of ill
befal him those men die and thou diest also
the induna leapt up and depart and rachel also made readi to go a
moment later the captain of the gate enter fell upon hi knee befor
dingaan and said
o king tide
what ar thei man he ask
king the watchmen report that it ha been call from hilltop to hilltop
that a white man who ride a black hors ha cross the buffalo and
travel toward the great place what is thy pleasur shall he be kill
or driven back
when did that new come ask the king in the silenc which follow
thi announc
not a minut gone he answer the inner watchman ran with it and is
without the gate there ha been no other tide from the west for
dai
thy watchmen call but slowli king the water in the pool speak
swifter said rachel then still in the midst of a heavi silenc for
thi thing wa fear to them she turn and depart
so it is true so it is true rachel kept repeat to herself the
word suit themselv to the time of the footfal of her bearer she
wa spent with all the labour and emot of that long dai culmin
in the last scene when she must plai her danger superhuman part
befor these keenwit savag she could think no more scarc could
she undress and throw herself upon her bed in the hut yet that night she
slept soundli better than she had done sinc noie went awai no dream

englishman or boer have enter zululand doubtless the new of hi
arriv had been convei over score of mile of countri by the call

i have no servant inkosazana broke in richard i left quabi at a
kraal fifti mile awai laid up with a cut foot as soon as he is better
he will slip back across the buffalo river
then while richard at which he did heartili enough for joi had made him
veri hungri thei talk who had much to tell he ask her why she
thought it necessari to leav zululand at onc she answer for two
reason first becaus of her desper anxieti about her father and
mother as to whom her heart forebod ill and secondli for hi own sake
she explain that the zulu who had set her up as an imag or a token of
the guid spirit of their nation were madli jealou concern her so
jealou that if he remain here long she wa by no mean certain that
even her power could protect him when thei came to understand that he wa
much to her it wa imposs that she could see him often and much more
so that he could remain in her kraal therefor if thei were detain he
would be oblig to live at some distanc from her where an assegai might
find him at night or poison be put in hi food at present thei were
impress by her foreknowledg of hi arriv and that wa why he had
been admit to her at onc but thi would wear offand then who could
sai especi if ishmael return
he ask who ishmael wa and what he had to do with her rachel told him
briefli and though she suppress much he look veri grave at that
stori
while she wa finish it a woman call without for leav to enter and
as befor rachel bade him stand in a respect attitud and at a
distanc from her richard obei and the woman came in to sai that
certain of the king induna crave audienc with her thei were admit
and salut her in their usual humbl fashion but of richard beyond
ey him curious and as she thought hostil thei took not the
slightest heed
ar all thing readi for my journei as i command ask rachel at
onc
inkosazana answer their spokesman thei ar readi for how canst
thou be disobei tamboosa and the impi wait without yet inkosazana
the heart of the black on and the heart of hi councillor and of all
the zulu peopl ar cut in two becaus thou wouldst go and leav them
mourn their heart ar sore also with thi white man dario who ha
come to lead thee henc so sore that were he not thy servant the
induna ad grimli he at least should stai in zululand
he is my servant answer rachel haughtili whom i sent for let that
suffic rememb my word all of you and let them be told again in the
ear of the king that if ani harm come to thi white chief who is my
guest and your then there will be blood between me and the peopl of the
zulu that shall be terribl aveng in blood
the induna seem to cower at thi declar but made no answer onli
the chief of them said
the king would know if the inkosi thy servant bring thee ani tide
of the amaboona the white folk with whom he ha been journei
he bring tide that thei seek peac with the zulu to whom thei will
do no hurt if no hurt is done to them shall i tell them that the zulu
also seek peac
the king gave us no messag on that matter inkosazana repli the
induna he await the come of the prophet of the ghostfolk to
interpret the mean of thy word and of the omen of the fall star
so be it said rachel when my servant noie return let her be sent
on to me at onc that i mai hear and consid the word of her peopl
and she began to rise from her seat to intim that the interview wa
finish
inkosazana said the induna hurriedli on question from the kingwhen
dost thou return to zululand
i return when it is need fear not i think that i shall return but i
sai to the king and to all of you be care when i come that there is no
blood between me and you lest great evil fall upon your head from
heaven i have spoken good fortun go with you till we meet again
the induna look at each other then rose and depart humbl as thei

an hour later surround by the impi and follow by richard rachel wa
on the tugela road at the crest of a hill she pull rein and look back
at the great kraal umgugundhlovu then she beckon richard to her side
and said
i think that befor long i shall see that hate place again
why he ask
becaus of the wai in which those induna look at each other just now
there wa some evil secret in their ey richard i am afraid
chapter xiv
what chanc at ramah
the new which reach rachel that ishmael had been ill after the rough
handl of the captain in her presenc wa true enough for mani dai
he wa far too ill to travel and when he recov suffici to start
he could onli journei slowli to the tugela
it will be rememb that she wa told that he had escap as inde he
seem to do slip off at night but thi escap of hi wa carefulli
arrang beforehand nor did ani attempt to recaptur him upon hi wai
when at length he came to the river he found the small impi await him
not know whither thei were to go or what thei were to do their onli
order be that thei must obei him in all thing he found also that the
tugela wa in furiou flood so that to ford it prove quit imposs
here then he wa oblig to remain for ten full dai while the water ran
down
ishmael wa not idl dure those ten dai which be spent in recov
hi health and incident in reflect thu he thought a great deal
of hi past life and did not find the record satisfactori with hi exact
histori we need not troubl ourselv he wa wellborn as he had told
rachel but had been badli brought up hi strong passion had led him
into troubl while young and instead of try to reform him hi
belong had cast him off then he had enlist in the armi and so
reach south africa there he commit a crimea a matter of fact it
wa murder or someth like itand fled from justic far into the
wilder where a touch of imagin prompt him to take the name of
ishmael
for a while thi new exist suit him well enough thu he had wive
in plenti of a sort and he grew rich becom just such a person as
might be expect from hi environ and uncheck natur tendenc
at length it happen that he met rachel who awok in him certain
forgotten associ she wa an english ladi and he rememb that
onc he had been an english gentleman year and year ago also she wa
beauti which appeal to hi strong anim natur and spiritu
which appeal to a materialist soak in kaffir superstit so he fell
in love with her realli in love that is to sai he came to desir to
make her hi wife more than he desir anyth els on earth for her
sake he grew to dislik hi black consort howev handsom even the
heap up of herd of cattl after the nativ fashion ceas to appeal to
him he want to live as hi forbear had live quietli respect
with a woman of hi own class
so he made advanc to her with the result we know for fifteen year or
more he had been a savag and he could not hide hi savageri from her
ey ani more than he could break off the ti and entangl that had
grown up about him had she happen to care for him it is veri possibl
howev that in thi he would have succeed in time he might even have
reform himself complet and di in old ag a muchrespect coloni
gentleman perhap a member of the local legislatur but she did not she
detest him she knew him for what he wa a cowardli outcast whose good
look did not appeal to her so the spark of hi new aspir wa
trampl out beneath her merciless heel and there remain onli the
acquir savageri and superstit mix with the inborn instinct of a
blackguard
it wa thi superstit of hi that had brought all her troubl upon
rachel for howev it came about he had conceiv the idea that she wa
someth more than an ordinari woman and with mani tale of her
mysteri origin and power impart it to the zulu in whose mind it
wa foster by the accid of the coincid of her nativ name and
person loveli with those of the tradit white spirit of their
race and by mopo identif of her with that spirit thu she
becam their goddess and hi at ani rate for a time but while thei
desir to worship her onli and us her rumour wisdom as an oracl he
sought to make her hi wife the more imposs it becam the more he
sought it she refus him with contum and he laid plot to decoi her
to zululand think that there she would be in hi power in the end he
succeed base enough onli to find that he wa in her power and that
the contum and more were still hi share
but all thi did not in the least deter him from hi aim and as it
chanc fortun had put other card into hi hand he knew that rachel
would not stai among the zulu as thei knew it therefor thei had
commiss him to bring her peopl to her if her peopl were not
brought he wa sure that she would come to seek them and if she found no
on then where could she go or at least who would be at hand to help
her sure hi opportun had come at last and marriag by captur did
not occur to him who had spent so mani year among savag as a crime
from which to shrink onli he fear that the prospect captiv the
inkosazanayzoola wa not on with whom it wa safe to trifl but hi
love wa stronger than hi fear he thought that he would take the risk
such were the reflect of ishmael upon the bank of the flood tugela
and when at length the water went down suffici to enabl him and the
soldier under hi command to cross into natal he wa fulli determin to
put them into practic if the chanc came hi wai how thi might best be
done he left to luck for if it could be avoid he did not wish to have
more blood upon hi hand onli rachel must be render homeless and
friendless for then who could protect her from him an answer came into
hi mindsh might protect herself or that power which seem to go with
her might protect her someth warn him that thi evil enterpris wa
veri danger yet the fire that burnt within him drove him on to face
the danger
ishmael wa still on the zululand bank of the river when on dai about
noon an urgent messag reach him from dingaan it said that the king wa
angri as a wound buffalo to learn as he had just done that he
ibubesi still linger on hi road and had not carri out hi mission
the inkosazana accompani by a white man wa travel to ramah and
unless he went forward at onc would overtak him therefor he must
march instantli and bring back the old teacher and hi wife as he had been
bidden should he meet the inkosazana and her companion as he return
with the white prison she must not be touch or insult in ani wai
onli hi ear and those of the soldier with him were to be deaf to her
order or entreati to releas them for then she would sure turn and
follow of her own accord back to the great place if the white man with
her made troubl or resist he wa to be bound but on no account must
hi blood be made to flow for if thi happen it would bring a curs
upon the land and he dingaan swore by the head of the black on who wa
gone that is chaka that he would kill him ibubesi in payment ye he
would smear him with honei and bind him over an antheap in the sun till
he di if he hunt africa from end to end to catch him moreov
should he fail in the busi he would send a regiment and destroi hi
town at mafooti and put hi wive and peopl to the spear and seiz hi
cattl all thi also he swore by the head of the black on
now when ishmael receiv thi messag he wa much frighten for he knew
that these were not idl threat inde the exhaust messeng told him
that never had ani live man seen dingaan so mad with rage as he wa when
he learn that he ibubesi wa still linger on the bank of the
tugela ad that he had foam at the mouth with furi and utter
terribl threat ishmael sent him back with a humbl answer point out
that it had been imposs to cross the river which wa in wrath but
that now he would do all thing as he wa command and especi that
not a hair of the white man head should be harm
then you must do them quickli said the messeng with a grim smile as
he rose and prepar to go for know that the inkosazana is not more than
half a dai march behind you accompani by the white inkoo dario
what is thi dario like ask ishmael
oh he is young and veri handsom with hair and beard of gold and ey
that ar such as those of the inkosazana herself some sai that he is her
brother anoth child of the heaven and some that he is her husband
who am i that i should speak of such high thing but it is evid that
she love him veri much for by her magic she told the king of hi come
and even when he is behind her she is alwai try to turn her head to
look at him
oh she love him veri much doe she said ishmael set hi white
teeth then he turn and call the captain of the impi gave order
that the river must be cross at onc for so the king command and it
wa better to die with honour by water than with shame by the spear
so thei wade and swam the river with great difficulti but as it
chanc without loss of life ishmael be born over it upon the
shoulder of the strongest men upon it further bank he summon the
captain and deliv to them the order of the king then thei set out
for ramah ishmael carri in a litter made of bough
whilst the soldier were construct thi litter he call two men of
the swampdwel who had their home upon the bank of the tugela and
promis them a reward bade them run to hi town mafooti and tell hi
head man there to come at onc with thirti of the best soldier and to
hide them in the bush of the kloof abov ramah where he would join them
that night the men who knew ibubesi and what happen to those who
fail upon hi busi went swiftli and a littl while afterward the
litter be finish ishmael enter it and the impi start for ramah
befor sundown thei appear upon a ridg overlook the settlement just
as the herd were drive the cattl into their kraal see the zulu

them out fled to the bush the herd drive the cattl after them man

ishmael and the impi enter ramah no on wa left in it save a few ag

command the soldier to surround it with order that thei were to hurt

sit postur on the bed slip from hi wound head which he had
clasp just befor he di and for a moment seem to point at him he
shiver but still he could not stir how dread and solemn wa that
face and those ey how thei search out the black record of hi heart
the quiet rai of the afternoon sun suddenli flow in through the window
place and illumin the aw accus face till it shone like that of a
saint in glori a drop of blood from the cut upon hi cheek splash on to
the floor and the nois of it struck on hi strain nerv loud as a
pistolshot blood hi own blood wherewith he must pai for that which he
had shed the sight and the thought seem to break the spell with an
oath he bound out of the room like a frighten wolf those dead stare
at him as he went and rush from the hous that held them
beyond it wall ishmael paus the zulu had fled in on direct and
the inhabit of ramah in anoth there wa no on to be seen hi ey
fell upon the dens mass of bush abov the station and he rememb the
messag that he had sent to hi own peopl to meet him there perhap thei
had alreadi arriv he would go to see he who wa in such sore need of
human compani as he went hi numb faculti return to him and in the
open light of dai some of hi terror pass he began to think again what
wa done wa done he could not bring the dead back to life he wa not
realli to blame and after all thing had work out well for him save
for thi white man dario rachel wa now alon in the world and dead
peopl did not speak there wa no on to tell her of hi share in the
tragedi why should she not turn to him who had no on els to whom she
could go the white man if he were still with her could be got rid of
somehow veri like he would run awai and thei two would be left quit
alon at ani rate it wa for her sake that be had enter on thi black
road of sin and what did on step more matter the step that led him to
hi reward of cours it might lead him somewher els rachel wa a woman
to be fear and the zulu were to be fear and other thing to which
he could give no shape or name but that he felt press round him were
still more to be fear perhap he would do best to fly far into the
interior or by ship to some other land where none would know him and hi
black stori what fly companion by those ghost and leav rachel the
woman for whom he burn with thi dario whom the zulu said she love
and with whom her mother just befor her end had declar that she would
be safe never she wa hi he had bought her with blood and he would

great prophet and doubtless hi spirit is strong to reveng well for you
is it master that you had no hand in the deed as at first i fear
might be the case for know that last night a strang dog climb on to
your hut and howl there and would not be driven awai nor could we kill
it with spear so we think it wa a ghost all your wive thought that
evil had drawn near to you
ishmael struck him across the mouth exclaim
be silent you accurs wizard or you shall howl louder than your
ghostdog

hi ey what ar your command chief

impi and all the spirit of the dead will need littl help from us

royal salut
although it wa red with earth and fleck with foam and the roar of it
wa loud as it sped toward the sea the river did not prove veri
difficult to ford but onc inde were the hors swept off their feet
and forc to swim and then but for a few pace after which thei
regain them and plung to the farther bank without accid
free at last rachel with our live befor us and noth more to fear
call richard in hi cheeri voic as he forc hi hors alongsid of

then thei press their hors to a canter and rode on speak littl
for the fount of word seem to be frozen in them although richard
recollect with a curiou sens of wonder how he had look forward to
thi opportun of long unfett talk with rachel and how much he had
to tell her over hill and vallei through bush and stream thei rode till
at last with the short twilight thei reach the plain that ran to ramah
then came the dark in which thei must ride slowli till present the
round edg of the moon push itself up abov the shoulder of a hill and
there wa light againpur peac light that turn the veld to silver
and shone white on the pale face of rachel
ramah wa befor them thei had met no live thing save some wild game
trek to the water and heard no sound save the distant roar of some
beast of prei ramah wa befor them the moon shone on the roof of the
missionhous and the littl church and the cluster of kaffir hut
beyond but oh it wa silent no cattl low no child cri nor did
the bell of the church ring for even prayer as at thi hour it should
have done also no lamp show in the window of the missionhous and no
smoke rose from the cook fire of the kraal
where ar all the peopl richard whisper rachel there is the place
unharm but where ar the peopl
but richard could onli shake hi head the terror of someth dread
had got hold of him also and he knew not what to sai
now thei had come to the wall of the missionhous and sprang from their
hors which thei left loos as thei advanc side by side toward the
open gate someth leapt the stoep and rush through it it wa a
stripe hyena thei could see the hair bristl on it back as it pass
them with a whine growl hand in hand thei ran to the hous across the
littl garden patchrachel led by some instinct guid her companion
straight to her parent room whereof the window that open like door
stood wide as the gate had done
on more moment and thei were there anoth and the moonlight show

for a long whileto richard it seem hoursrachel said noth onli
stood still like the statu of a woman stare at those cold face that
look back at her through the unearthli moonlight inde it wa richard

which the man had let fall when the zulu spear struck him

her beauti agonis face put up some silent prayer next she rose and
kiss first her father then her mother kiss their dead brow in a
last farewel and turn to go as she went her ey fell upon the assegai
that lai near to the dead zulu stoop down she took it and with it in
her hand pass on to the stoep here her strength seem to fail her for
she reel against the wall then with an effort flung herself into
richard arm moan

a moment later she becam awar that the stoep wa swarm with men who
seem to aris out of the shadow a voic said in the kaffir tongu
seiz that fellow and bind him
instantli befor he could do anyth befor he could even turn richard
wa torn from her struggl furious and thrown to the ground rachel
sprang to the wall and stood with her back to it rais the spear she
held it flash into her mind that these were zulu and of zulu she wa
not afraid
what dog ar these she cri that dare to lift a hand against the
inkosazana and her servant
the black men about her swai and murmur then made wai for a man who
walk up the step of the stoep the moonlight fell upon him and she saw
that it wa ishmael

but thei wont mind cut hi throat he ad significantli
never mind about me said richard in a choke voic from the ground
where he wa pin down by the kaffir do what you think best for
yourself rachel
now rachel whose wit were made keen by doubt and anguish look at the
face of the nativ about her and even in that dim moonlight read them
like a book as she could alwai do she saw that thei were afraid of her
and that if she command them thei would let her go free whatev their
master might sai or do but she saw also that ishmael spoke truth when he
declar that thei had no such dread of richard and might even believ
that he wa do her some violenc if she escap therefor it would be
at the cost of richard life instantli in her bold fashion she made up
her mind it wa born in upon her that she had declar the truth that
ishmael wa doom that he had no power to work her ani hurt howev
sore her case might seem sinc richard life hung on it she would go
with him
servant of ibubesi she said lift the white chief dario to hi feet
and listen to my word
thei obei her at onc without even wait for their master to speak
onli hold richard by the arm
now the most of the men went into the garden follow by ishmael and
take richard with them but a few remain to watch her from thi
garden present aros a sound of great quarrel rachel wa too far
off to understand what wa said but from the sound she judg that
ishmael wa give order to hi peopl which thei refus to obei for
she could hear him curs them furious present she heard someth
elseth loud report of a gun follow by groan then a kaffir ran up to
them and whisper someth to those who surround her it wa that head
man whom ishmael had struck on the mouth in the bush when he told him that
a dog had howl upon hi hut and hi face wa veri frighten
rachel lean against the wall and look at him for she could not speak
she who thought that richard had been murder
have no fear inkosazana said the man answer the question in her
ey ibubesi ha kill on of us becaus we do not like thi busi
and would clean it off our hand that is all the chief dario is safe
and i swear to thee that no harm shall come to him from us we will care
for him and protect him to the death and if we lead him awai a prison
it is becaus we must sinc otherwis ibubesi will kill us all therefor
be merci to us when the spear of thy power is lift
befor rachel could answer ishmael voic wa heard ask why thei did
not bring the inkosazana as the hors were readi
i prai thee come zoola said the man hurriedli or he will shoot more
of us
so rachel walk down the step of the stoep in front of them hold her
head high leav behind her the hous of ramah and it dead at the gate
of the garden stood the hors on on of which hi own richard wa
alreadi mount hi arm bound hi feet made fast beneath it with a hide
rope her path lai past him and as she went by he said in a voic that
wa choke with rage
i am helpless i cannot save you but our hour will come
ye richard she answer quietli our hour will come when hi ha
gone and with the spear in her hand onc more she point at ishmael
who stood by watch them sullenli then she mount her horsehow she
could never rememberand thei were separ
after thi she seem to hear ishmael talk to her argu explain
but she made no answer to hi word her mind wa a blank and all she
knew wa that thei were ride on for hour her tire hors stumbl up a
pass and down it further side then she heard dog bark and saw light
the hors stop and she slid from it and as she wa too exhaust to
walk wa support or carri into a hut as she thought by women who
seem veri much afraid of touch her after which she seem to sink
into black
rachel woke from her stupor to find herself ly on a bed in a great
kaffir hut that wa furnish like a european room for in it were chair
and a tabl also rough window place close with reed mat that took the
place of glass through the smokehol at the top of the hut struck a
straight rai of sunlight by which she judg that it must be about
middai she began to think till by degre everyth came back to her
and in that hour she nearli di of horror and of grief inde she wa
mind to die there at her side lai a mean of deathth assegai which
she had found by the bodi of the zulu in ramah and none had taken from
her she lift it and felt it edg then laid it down again into the
dark of her despair some comfort seem to creep she wa sure that
richard live and if she di he would die also while he live why
should she die moreov it would be a crime which she should onli dare
when all hope had gone and she stood face to face with shame
thrust asid these thought she rose on the tabl stood curdl milk
and other food of which she forc herself to eat that her strength might
return to her for she knew that she would need it all then she wash
and dress herself for in a corner of the hut wa water in wooden bowl
and even a comb and other thing that appar had been set there for
her to us thi done she went to the door which wa made like that of a
hous and find that it wa not secur open it and look out
beyond wa a piec of ground floor with the soil taken from antheap

insol confid but sat pale and proud as she had sat at

chapter xvi
the three dai
he wa gone hi presenc had ceas to poison the air and the long
strain over rachel gave a gasp of relief then she sat down upon the
bench and began to think her posit and that of richard wa
desper it seem scarc possibl that thei could escap with their
live for if he di she would die alsoa to that she wa quit
determin but at least thei had three dai and who could sai what would
happen in three dai for instanc thei might escap somehow the
provid in which she believ might interven or the zulu might come
to seek her if thei onli knew where she wa gone oh why had she not
brought a guard of them with her to ramah at least thei would never have
insult her and ishmael shrift would have been short
she wonder why he had given her three dai a reason suggest itself to
her mind perhap he believ what she had told himthat she wa as safe
from him as the eagl in the airand wa sure that the onli wai to snare
her wa by us richard as a lure in other word by threaten to
murder him it is true that he could have brought the matter to a head at
onc but then if she remain obdur he must carri out hi threat
and thi she believ he wa afraid to do unless it wa absolut
forc upon him doubtless he had reflect that in three dai she might
weaken and give wai
whilst rachel brood thu the door in the wall open and through it
came three women who salut her respectfulli and announc that thei
were sent to clean the hut and attend upon her rachel took stock of them
carefulli two of them were young ordinari goodlook kaffir but the
third wa between thirti and forti and no longer attract have
becom old earli as nativ do moreov her face wa sad and
sympathet rachel ask her her name she answer that it wa mami and
that thei were all the wive of ibubesi
the women went about their duti in the hut in silenc and a while
afterward announc that all wa made clean and that thei would return
present with food rachel answer that it wa not necessari that three
of them should be put to so much troubl it would be enough if mami came
she desir to be wait on by mami alon her sister need not come ani
more
thei all three salut again and said that she should be obei the two
younger on with alacr to rachel it wa evid that these women were
much afraid of her her reput had reach them and thei shrank from
thi task of attend on the mighti inkosazana of the zulu in her cage
not know what evil it might bring upon them
an hour later the door wa unbolt and mami reappear with the food
that had been veri carefulli cook rachel at of it for she wa
determin to grow strong again she who might need all her strength and
while she at talk to mami who squat on the ground befor her soon
she drew her stori from her the woman wa ishmael first kaffir wife
but he had never care for her and against all law and custom she wa
discard and made a slave even some of her cattl had been taken from
her and given to other wive so her heart wa bitter against ishmael and
she said that although onc she wa proud to be the wife of a white man
now she wish that she had never seen hi face
here then wa materi readi to rachel hand but she did not press the
matter too far at thi time onli she said that she wish mami to stai
with her after the even meal and to sleep in her hut as she wa not
accustom to be alon at night mami repli that she would do so gladli
if ibubesi allow it although she wa not worthi of such honour
as it happen ishmael did allow it for he thought that he could trust
thi old drudg and told her to act as a spy upon rachel and report to
him all that she said or did veri soon rachel found thi out and warn
her against obei him sinc if she did so it would come to her
knowledg and then great evil would fall on on who betrai the word of
the inkosazana
mami answer that she knew it and that rachel need not be afraid ani
tale would do for ishmael whom she hate then sai littl herself
rachel encourag her to talk which mami did freeli so she heard some
new she learn for instanc that the whole town of mafooti whereof
ibubesi wa chief which count some sixti or seventi head of famili
wa much disturb by the event of the last few dai thei did not like
the inkosazana be brought there think that where she went the zulu
would follow and as thei were of zulu blood themselv thei knew what
that meant thei were alarm at the death of the white skydoctor who
wa call shouter and hi wife with which ibubesi had someth to do
for thei fear lest thei should be held respons for their blood thei
object to the imprison of the white chief dario among them
becaus he had hurt no on and wa under the mantl of the inkosazana
who wa a spirit not a woman and who had warn them that if ani harm
came to her or to him death would be their reward thei were angri also
becaus ibubesi had kill on of them in some quarrel about the chief
dario at ramah still thei were so much afraid of ibubesi who wa a
great tyrant that thei did not dare to interfer with him and hi plan
lest thei should lose their cattl or perhap their live so thei did
not know what to do as for ibubesi himself he wa activ engag in
strengthen the fortif of the place even the old peopl and the
children were be forc to carri stone to the wall from which it wa
evid that he fear some attack
when rachel had gather thi and much other inform concern
ishmael past and habit she ask mami if she could convei a messag
from her to richard the woman answer that she would try on the
follow morn so rachel told her to sai that she wa safe and well
but that he must watch hi footstep as both of them were in great
danger more she did not dare to sai fear lest mami should betrai her
or be beaten till she confess everyth then as there wa noth
more to be done rachel lai down and slept as best she could
the next dai pass in much the same fashion as the first had done for
the most of it rachel sat under the tree in the wall yard companion
onli by her terribl thought and fear nobodi came near her and noth
happen in the morn mami went out and return at the dinner hour
told rachel that she had seen ishmael who had question her close as
to what the inkosazana had done and said to which she repli that she
had onli eaten and slept and invok the spirit on her knee as for
word none had pass her lip she had not been abl to get near the
hut where dario wa in prison as ishmael wa watch her for the rest
the work of fortif went on without ceas even ishmael own wive
be emploi thereon
in the afternoon mami went out again and did not return till night when
she had much to tell to begin with while the sentri wa doze be
weari with carri stone to the wall she had manag to approach the
fenc of the hut where richard wa confin she said that he wa walk
up and down insid the fenc with hi hand ti and she had spoken to
him through a crack in the reed and given him rachel messag he
listen eagerli and bade her tell the inkosazana that he thank her for
her word that he too wa strong and well though much troubl in
mind but the futur wa in the hand of the heaven and that she must
keep a high heart just then the sentri woke up so mami could not wait to
hear ani more
that even howev a lad who had been sent out of the town to drive in
some cattl had return with the tide which she mami heard him
deliv to ibubesi with her own ear
he said that whilst he wa collect the oxen a ring zulu came upon
him who from hi manner and bear he took to be a great chief although
he wa alon and seem to be tire with walk the zulu ha ask him
if it were true that the inkosazana and the white chief dario were in
prison at mafooti and when he hesit about repli threaten him
with hi assegai sai that he would cut out hi heart unless he told
the truth the zulu repli that he knew it as he had just come from
ramah where he had seen strang thing and spoken with a man of
ibubesi whom he found dy in the garden of the hous then he had
given him thi messag
sai to ibubesi that i know all hi wicked and that if the inkosazana
is harm or if drop of the blood of the white chief dario is shed i
will destroi him and everyth that live in hi town down to the rat
sai to him also that he cannot escap as alreadi he is ring in by the
children of the shouter who have come back and ar watch him
the lad had ask who it wa that sent such a messag whereon he
answer i am the horn of the black bull i am the trunk of the
eleph i am the mouth of dingaan
then straightwai he turn and depart at a run toward zululand
moreov mami describ the man in the word of the lad and rachel
thought that he could be none other than tamboosa whom she had command
to follow her with the white ox mami ad that when he receiv thi
messag ibubesi seem much disturb though to hi peopl he declar
that it wa all nonsens as dingaan mouth would not come alon or
deliv the king word to a boi but the peopl thought otherwis and
murmur among themselv fear the terribl vengeanc of dingaan
on the next dai mami went out again at nightfal when she return she
told rachel that she had not found it possibl to approach the hut where
dario wa as the hole she made in the fenc to speak with him had been
discov and a stricter watch wa kept over him ibubesi she said wa
in an ill humour and work furious to finish hi fortif as
he wa now sure that the town wa be watch either by the kaffir of
ramah or other as for the peopl of mafooti thei were grumbl veri
much both on account of the heavylabour of work at the wall and
becaus thei were in terror of be attack and kill in payment for
the evil deed of their chief mami declar inde that so great wa
their fear and discont that she thought thei would desert the town in
a bodi were it not that thei dread lest thei should fall into the hand
of the kaffir who were watch it rachel ask her whether thei would
not then take her and dario and deliv them up to the zulu or to the
white peopl on the coast mami answer she thought thei would be afraid
to do thi as ibubesi alon had gun and would shoot plenti of them
also if the zulu found them with their inkosazana thei would kill them
she ad that she had seen ibubesi who bade her tell the inkosazana that
he wa come for her answer on the morrow
rachel slept ill that night the space of her repriev had gone by and
next morn she must face the issu for herself she did not so greatli
care for at the worst she had a refug whither ishmael could not follow
herth grave after all she had endur it seem to her that thi must
be a peac place moreov in her case what power could blame her but
there wa richard to be thought of if she refus ishmael he swore that
he would kill richard and yet how could she pai that price even to save
her lover life perhap he would not kill him after all perhap he
would be afraid of the vengeanc of the zulu and wa onli try to
frighten her ah if onli the zulu would comebefor it wa too late it
wa scarc to be hope for tamboosa if it were he who had spoken with
the lad would not have had time to return to zululand and collect an
impi and when thei did come the deed might be done if onli these
servant of ibubesi would rise against him and kill him or carri off
richard and herself ala thei fear the man too much and she could not
get at them to persuad them there wa noth that she could do except
prai richard and she must take their chanc thing must go as thei were
decre
if she could have seen ishmael at thi hour and read hi thought that
sight and knowledg might have brought some comfort to her tortur heart
the man wa seat in hi hut alon stare at the floor and pull hi
long black beard with hand rough from toil at the wall he wa
drink also stiff tot of rum and water but the fieri liquor seem to
bring him no comfort as he drank he thought he wa determin to get
possess of rachel that desir had becom a mad with him he could
never abandon it while he live but she might not live she had sworn
that she would rather die than becom hi wife and she wa not a woman
who broke her word also she hate him bitterli and with good caus
there wa onli on wai to work on herthrough her love for thi man
richard darrien for that she did love him he had littl doubt if it
were choic between yield and the death of darrien then perhap she
might give wai but there came the rub
dingaan had sworn to him that if he made darrien blood to flow then he
should be kill and like rachel dingaan kept hi oath moreov that
zulu who met the cattl herd had sworn it again in almost the same word
therefor it would seem that if he wish to continu to breath
darrien blood must not be made to flow all the rest might be explain
when the impi came as it would do sooner or later especi if he could
show to them that the inkosazana wa hi will wife but the murder of
darrien could never be explain well the man might die or seem to die
and then who could hold him respons or if thei did if ani of hi
peopl remain faith to him an attack might be beaten off brave as
thei were the zulu could not storm those wall on which he had spent so
much labour though now he almost wish that he had left the wall alon
and settl the affair of rachel and of darrien first
ishmael pour out more rum and drank it neat thi time as though to
nerv himself for some undertak then he went to the door of the hut
and call whereon present a hideou old woman crept in and squat
down in the circl of light thrown by the lamp she wa wrinkl and
deform and her snakeskin moocha with the inflat fishbladd in her
hair show that she wa a witchdoctoress

and cannot be harm

ibubesiof cours i understand that the cow will be young on that have
not had more than two calv mix the powder in milk or water or
anyth it is without tast or colour good night ibubesi and without
wait for an answer the old wretch crept out of the hut
when she wa gone ishmael curs her aloud then drank some more rum
which he seem to need the place wa veri lone and the sight of hi
dog ly to all appear dead at hi side oppress him he pat
it head and it did not move he lift it paw and it fell down flabbili
the brute wa as dead as anyth could be it occur to him that befor
night came again he might look like that dog hi stori might be told he
might have left the earth in compani of all the deed that he had done
thereon he had imagin enough to know hi sin and thei were an evil
host to face old dove and hi wife for instanceholi peopl who
believ in god and vengeanc and had never done ani wrong onli striven
for year and year to benefit other it would not be pleasant to meet
them rachel had said that she saw them stand behind him and he felt
as though thei were there at that moment look on of them cross
between him and the lampther wa the mark of the kerri on hi headand
the woman follow he could see her blue lip as she bent down to look at
the dog it wa unbear he would go and talk to rachel and ask her if
she had made up her mind no for if he broke in on her thu at night he
wa sure that she would kill either herself or him with that spear she had
taken from the dead zulu redden with hi own blood he would keep faith
with her and wait till the morrow he would send for on of hi wive no
the thought of those women made him sick he would go round the
fortif and beat ani sentri whom he found asleep or receiv the
report of the spi to stop in that hut in the compani of a dog which
seem to be dead and of imagin that no rum could drown wa
imposs
onc more the morn came and rachel sat in the wall yard await the
dread hour of her trial for it wa the dai and time that ishmael had
appoint for her answer until now rachel had cherish hope that
someth might happen that the peopl of mafooti might interven to save
her and richard that the zulu might appear even that ishmael might
relent and let them go but mami had been out that morn and brought
back tide which dispel these hope she had ventur to sound some
of the lead men and said that like all the peopl thei were veri
sullen and alarm but declar as she had expect that thei dare do
noth for ibubesi would kill them and if thei escap him the zulu
would kill them becaus the inkosazana wa found in their possess of
the zulu themselv scout who had been out for mile report that
thei had seen no sign it wa clear also that ishmael wa as determin as
ever for he had sent her a messag by mami that he would wait upon her as
he had promis and bring the white man with him
then what should she sai and what should she do rachel could think of no
plan she could onli sit still and prai while the shadow of that aw
hour crept ever nearer
it had come she heard voic without the wall among them ishmael her
heart stop then bound like a live thing in her breast he wa
command someon to catch that dog and tie it up for it wa bewitch
and did not know him or anyon then the sound of a dog be drag
awai whine feebli and then the door open first ishmael came in with
an affect of swagger bold but look like a man suffer
from the effect of a long debauch about hi ey were great black ring
and in them wa a stare of sleepless he carri a doublebarrel
gun under hi arm but the hand with which he support it shook visibl
and at everi unusu sound he start after him came richard hi wrist
bound togeth behind him and on hi leg hide shackl which onli just
allow him to shuffl forward slowli moreov he wa guard by four men
who carri spear rachel glanc quickli at hi face and saw that it
wa pale and resolut quit untouch by fear
ar you well she ask quietli take no note of ishmael
ye he answer and you rachel
quit well bodili richard but oh my soul is sick
befor he could repli ishmael turn on him savag and bade him be
silent or it would be the wors for him then he took off hi hat with
hi shake hand and bow to rachel
rachel he said i have kept my promis and left you alon for three
dai but time is up and now thi gentleman and i have come to hear your
decis which is so import to both of us

husband todai of your own free will or whether mr richard darrien shall
suffer the punish of death for have tri to kill hi sentri and
escap a crime of which he ha been guilti and afterward i should take

when richard heard these word the vein in hi forehead swell with rage
and horror till it seem as though thei would burst

question the matter is not on of my life but of yourof youroh i
cannot sai it let thi foul beast kill me of cours and then if you

onli wai out listen you ishmaelrichard darrien the man to whom i am

god everlast vengeanc on your head he will not bui hi life on such
term and if i consent to them i should be fals to him murder him as
you murder my father and mother and when i know that he is dead i will
go to join him and them

think i will take you at your word and you can go to look for him down
below if you like for if i am not to get you here he shant now then
sai your prayer mr darrien and step forward slowli he cock the
doublebarrel gun
men of mafooti exclaim rachel in zulu ibubesi is about to do murder

flow todai or tomorrow your shall flow in payment your and that of
your wive and children for the crime of the chief is the crime of the
peopl
at her word the four nativ who had been watch thi scene uneasili
although thei could not understand the english talk call out to ishmael
in remonstr hi onli answer wa to lift the gun and for an instant
that seem infinit rachel wait to hear it explos and to see the
greyei openfac man she love who stood there like a rock fall a
shatter corps then on of the kaffir bolder than the rest struck up
the barrel with hi arm and not too soon for whether or no he had meant
to pull the trigger the rifl went off
try the other barrel said richard sarcast as the smoke clear
awai that shot wa too high
perhap ishmael might have done so for the man wa besid himself but
the kaffir would have no more of it thei rush between them lift
their spear threateningli and shout that thei would not allow the
blood of the white lord and the curs of the inkosazana to be brought upon
their head and those of their famili rather than that thei would bind
him ibubesi and give him over to the zulu then whether or not he had
realli meant to kill richard ishmael thought it polit to give wai
so be it he said to rachel i am merci and both of you shall have
anoth chanc i am go with thi fellow but the woman mami shall
come to you if within three hour you send her to me with a messag to

but at him so fierc that be much the stronger man he knock
him to the ground where he lai breathless
swear rachel swear he repeat or dead or live i will never
forgiv you

then he shuffl toward her bend down he kiss her on the face and
she kiss him back no more word pass between them thi wa their
farewel two of the kaffir lift ishmael and help him from the yard
whilst the other two led awai richard who made no resist at the gate
he turn and their ey met for a moment then it close behind him and
she wa left alon again
chapter xvii
rachel lose her spirit
a littl while later mami enter and said that she had been sent by
ibubesi to serv the inkosazana as a messeng should she need on
rachel seat on the bench motion to her to go into the hut and bide
there and she obei
minut by minut the time eb awai and still rachel sat motionless on
the bench toward the end of the third hour someon unbolt and knock
at the door mami open it and report that ibubesi stood without and
desir to know whether she had ani word for him
none answer rachel rememb her oath and the door wa bar
again
after thi a great silenc seem to fall upon the place the sky wa grei
with distant rain and the air heavi and whatev mai have been the
caus no sound came from man or beast without to rachel strain
nerv it seem as though the angel of death had spread hi wing abov
the town there she sat paralys wonder what evil thing wa be
work upon her lover wonder if she had done right to give him as a
sacrific to thi savag in order to save herself from dread
wrongwond wonder till the power of her mind seem to die
within her leav it grei and empti as the grei and empti sky abov
night drew on and the set sun burst through the envelop of cloud
fill earth and sky with fire and it came into rachel heart she knew

blanket over the corps and lift the litter depart at a run the
door wa shut and bolt behind them and dark fell upon the earth
for a while rachel stood still in the dark
now i am alon she said in a quiet voic yet to her ear the word
seem to be utter with a roar of thunder that echo through the
firmament and pierc upward to the feet of god
then suddenli someth snap in her brain and she wa chang the
horror left her the terror left her she felt veri well and strong so
well that she laugh aloud and again that laugh fill earth and heaven
oh she wa hungri and food stood on a tabl near by she sprang to it

would talk there for a littl while with their face close togeth
tillahtil what till someth strang happen someth unhappi
for ishmael oh no no she would not kill herself she would wait to see
what it wa that happen to ishmael that strang thing which she knew so
well and yet could not rememb
how easi thi hut wa to climb a cat could not have run up with less
troubl now she stood on the top of it her spear in on hand and
hold with the other to the pole that wa set there to scare awai the
lightn stood for a long time watch the wild beast lick the
cloud with their red tongu
the beast grew weari of lap up cloud their appetit were satisfi
for a while at ani rate she saw their tongu no more the air wa veri
hot and heavi and the dark veri dens it seem to press about her
as though she were plung in cream yet rachel thought that she heard
sound through it a sound of feet to the west and a sound of feet to the
east
then she heard anoth sound that of the door in the wall open and of
a soft tent footfal like to the footfal of a quest wolf she
knew it at onc for now her sens were sharper than those of ani savag
it wa the step of ibubesi the nightprowl she felt inclin to laugh
it wa so funni to think of herself stand there on the top of a hut
while the nightprowl slunk about below look for her but she
refrain rememb the dread nois when all the heaven began to
laugh in answer so she wa silent for the heaven do not reverber
silenc although she could hear her own thought pass through them
pass up on by on on their infinit journei
listen he wa walk round and round the yard he went to the bench
beneath the tree and felt along it with hi finger to see if she were
there now he wa enter the hut and grope at the bedstead and now he
had kindl a light for the rai of it shone faintli up through the
smokehol discov noth he came out again leav the lamp
burn within and call her softli
rachel he said rachel where ar you

accurs cowardli fool no it is not possibl the watch wa too good
unless she is realli a spirit and ha melt as spirit do i hope not
for if so she will haunt me and i want her compani in the flesh not in

must have bewitch me or why should i risk everyth for her just on
white woman who hate the sight of me the devil is at the back of it
thi wa hi road from the first
so he went on until rachel could bear it no more the thing wa too
absurd

and it end not far awai at the red gate of hell nightprowl
the man below gasp and fell against the fenc
whose voic is that where ar you he ask of the air
then as there wa no answer he ad it sound like rachel but it
spoke abov me i suppos that she ha kill herself i thought she
might but better that she should be dead than belong to that fellow onli
then why doe she speak
he start to feel hi wai toward the hut perhap to fetch the lamp
when suddenli the ski behind were illumin in a blaze of light a broad
slow blaze that endur for sever second by it the ey of rachel
made quick with mad saw mani thing from her perch on the top of the
hut she saw the town of mafooti on the plain to the west she saw a number
of black dot which she took to be peopl and cattl travel awai from
the town in the nek to the east she saw more dot each of them crest
with white and carri someth white sure it wa a zulu impi
march some of these dot had come to the wall of the town ye and
some of them were on the crest of it while yet other were creep down
it main street not a hundr yard awai
also these caught sight of someth for thei paus and seem to fall
togeth as though in fear lastli just befor the light went out she
perceiv ishmael in the yard below glare up at her for he too had
seen her seen her stand abov him in the air the spear in her hand
and in her ey fire but of the dot to the east and of the dot to the
west he had seen noth he appear to fall to hi knee and remain
there mutter then the heaven blaze again for the storm wa come
up and by the flare of them he read the truth thi wa no ghost but the
live woman
oh he said recov himself that where youv got to is it
come down rachel and let us talk
she made no answer none at all she who wa so curiou to see what he
would do for quit a long while he harangu her from below walk
round and round the hut then at length in despair he began to climb it
but in that dark which now and again turn to dazzl light unlik
rachel he found the task difficult and onc miss hi hold he fell
to the ground heavili find hi feet he rush at the hut with an oath
and clutch the straw and the grass string that bound it struggl
almost to the top to be met by the point of rachel spear held in hi
face there then he hung look like a toad on the slope of a rock
unabl to advanc becaus of that spear and unwil to go down lest
hi labour must be begun again
rachel he said come down rachel whatev i have done ha been for
your sake come down and tell me that you forgiv me
she laugh out loud a wild scream laugh for realli he look most
ridicul sprawl there on the bend of the hut and the lightn
show her all sort of pictur in hi ey

poison with milk the milk of human kind it wa a veri good poison
toad so good that i think you must have drawn it from your own blood
when you ar dead all the bushmen should come and dip their arrow in you
for then even crocodil and the big snake would die at a scratch
he made no answer so she went on
have your peopl forgiven you if so why do thei flee awai carri
that white thing which wa a man have my father and mother forgiven you

of sharp spear see here come the spear look at the wall toad look
at the wall
as she rave on and point with her assegai the lightn blaze out
and ishmael who had look round at her bid saw zulu warrior
leap down from the crest of the wall and zulu captain rush in by
the open door at thi terribl sight he slid to the ground purpos to
reach hi gun which he had left there and defend or kill himself who
know which but befor ever he could lai a hand upon it those fierc men
had pounc upon him like leopard on a goat now thei held him fast and
a voiceit wa that of tamboosa call through the dark
hail to thee inkosazana come down now and pass judgment on thi wild
beast who would have harm thee
tamboosa she cri the inkosazana ha fled awai onli the white woman
in whom she dwelt remain her spirit hang in wrath over the peopl of
the zulu as an eagl hang abov a hare tamboosa there is blood
between the inkosazana and the peopl of the zulu the blood of those who
gave her the bodi that she wore who lie slain by them upon the bed at
kamah tamboosa there is blood between her and ibubesi the blood of the
white man who love the bodi that she wore and whom she love the white
lord whom ibubesi did to death thi dai becaus she who wa the inkosazana
would not give herself to him tamboosa the inkosazana ha suffer much
from thi ibubesi mani an insult mani a shame and when she call upon
the zulu out of all their thousand thousand there wa not a singl
spear to help her becaus thei were too busi kill those holi on whom
she call her father and her mother and so tamboosa the spirit of the
inkosazana depart like a bird from the egg leav but thi shell
behind that is full or sorrow and of dream yet tamboosa she still

blood that thei have sown her peopl the zulu must harvest woe upon
woe as while she dwelt among them she warn them that it would be if
ill came to those she love tamboosa thi is her commandthat ye shield
the breast in which she hid from the wild beast ibubesi and all evil men
and that ye lead thi shape to noie the daughter of seyapi whom ibubesi
brought to death for with noie it would dwell
thu she wail through the deep dark while the soldier who pack
the space below groan in their grief and terror becaus the soul of the
inkosazana had been made a wander by their sin and the curs of the
inkosazana had fallen on their land
again the lightn flare and in it thei saw her stand on the crest
of the hut she had let drop the spear as though she need it no more
and her arm were outstretch to the heaven and her beauti face wa
upturn and her long hair float in the wind seen thu by that quick
white light which shone in the mad of her ey she seem no woman
but what thei had fabl her to be a queen of spirit and at the vision
of her thei groan again while some of them fell to the earth and hid
their face with their hand
the dark fell onc more and a man went into the hut to bring out the
lamp that burn there when he return rachel stood among them thei had
not seen or heard her descend ishmael saw her also and feel hi doom
in the fierc ey that glower at him stretch out hi hand and caught
her by the robe prai for piti
at hi touch she utter a wild scream which pierc like a knife through
the heart of all that heard it
suffer it not she cri oh my peopl suffer not that i be thu
defil
thei rent him from her with blow and execr look up to their
chief for hi word to tear him to piec
no said tamboosa grimli he shall to the king to tell thi stori er
he die
save me rachel save me he moan you dont know what thei mean i
wa mad with love for you do not judg me harshli and send me to be
tortur
thi appeal of hi seem to pierc the dark of her brain and for a
littl while her face grew human
i judg not she answer in zulu prai to the great on abov who
judg oh man man she went on in a kind of eeri whisper what have
i done to you that you should treat me thu why did you command the
soldier to kill my father and my mother why did you poison my lover why
did you drive awai my soul and fill me with thi mad take me awai
from thi accurs town tamboosa befor heaven vengeanc fall on it
and let me see that face no more
then some of them made a guard about her and led her thenc along the
central street and through the barricad gate that thei broke down for
her passag thei led her to a littl cave in the slope of the oppos
hill for although no rain fell the gather storm wa break the
lightn flash thick and fast the thunder groan and bellow and a
wild wind beat the screech tree
here in the mouth of thi cave rachel sat herself down and look at the
kraal mafooti await she knew not what while the impi pillag the
town and ishmael alreadi half dead with fear remain bound to the
rooftre of the hut that had been her prison
whilst she wait thu and watch of a sudden on of the outer hut
began to burn though whether the lightn or some soldier had fire it
none could tell then in an instant as it seem driven by the rage
wind the flame leapt from roof to roof till mafooti wa but a sheet of
fire the soldier at their work of pillag saw and rush hither and
thither confusedli for thei did not know the path and were tangl in
the fenc
a figur appear run down the central street a figur of flame for
hi cloth burn on him and those by rachel said
see see ibubesi
he could not reach the gate for a blaze hut fell across hi path
turn he sped to the edg of a cliff that rose near by where becaus
of it steep there wa no wall here for a while he ran up and down
till the winddriven fire from newlit hut at it brink leapt out upon
him like thin scarlet tongu he threw himself to the ground he rose
again beat hi head with hi hand for hi long hair wa ablaz then
in hi torment and despair of a sudden he threw himself backward into
the dark gulf beneath fifti feet and more he fell to the rock below and
where he fell there he lai till he di and on the morrow the zulu found
and buri him
thu did ishmael depart out of the life of rachel to the end which he had
earn
nor did he go alon for of the zulu in the town mani were caught by the
fire and perish so mani that when the regiment muster at dawn that
same regiment which had escort the inkosazana to the bank of the
tugela fifti and on men were miss whilst number of other appear
burn and blister
ah said tamboosa as he survei the injur and count the dead the
curs is quickli at work among us and i think that thi is but the
begin of evil well i expect it no less
as for the town of mafooti it wa utterli destroi to thi dai the place
is a wilder where the grass grow rank between the crumbl
fireblacken wall for the peopl of ibubesi who had fled return
thither no more nor would other build where it had been sinc still
thei swear that the spot is haunt by the figur of a white man who in
time of thunder rush across it wrap in fire and plung blaze
into the gulf upon it northern side
after the storm came the rain which pour all night long a steadi sheet
of water reach from earth to heaven rachel watch it vacantli for a
while then went to the head of the littl cave and lai down wrap in
kaross that thei had made readi for her moreov she slept as a child
sleep until the sun shone bright on the morrow then she woke and ask
for food
but the impi did not sleep all night long the soldier stood in huddl
group beneath such shelter as the tree and rock would give to them
while the water pour on them pitilessli till their teeth chatter and
their limb were frozen some di of the cold that night and afterward
mani other fell sick of agu and fever of the lung which kill a
number of them
in the morn when the storm wa past and the sun shone hotli tamboosa
call the council of the captain togeth and consult with them as to
whether thei should follow after the peopl of mafooti who had fled and
destroi them or return straight to zululand most of the captain
answer that of mafooti and it peopl thei had seen enough ibubesi wa
dead slain by the vengeanc of heaven the inkosazana thei had rescu
aliv though fill with mad the white lord dario had been
murder by ibubesi it wa said with poison and doubtless hi bodi wa
burn in the fire as for the peopl of mafooti themselv it would seem
that most of them were innoc as thei had fled the place desert
their chief to these argument other captain answer that the peopl of
mafooti were not innoc inasmuch as thei had help ibubesi to carri off
the inkosazana and the white lord dario from ramah and consent to
their imprison and to the death of on of them onli fly when thei
had tide that the impi wa on the wai moreov the command wa that
everi on of these dog should be kill wherea thei had kill none of
them but onli taken those cattl which were left behind in their flight
at length the disput grow fierc the captain be unabl to come to
an agreement decid that thei would lai the matter befor the
inkosazana and be guid by the word that fell from her if thei could
understand them
so tamboosa went into the cave with on other man and talk to rachel
who sat stare at him with stoni ey as though she understood noth
when at length he ceas howev she cri
lead me to noie at the great place lead me to noie nor would she sai
ani more
so as the peopl of mafooti had fled thei knew not where and thei had
secur some of the cattl and as mani of the soldier were sick from the
cold and burn receiv in the fire tamboosa told the regiment that it
wa the will of the inkosazana that thei should return to zululand
a while later thei start those of them who were so badli burn that
thei could not travel be carri on shield but rachel would not be
carri choos to walk alon surround at a distanc by a ring of
soldier who guard her for hour she walk thu show no sign of
weari but now and again burst out into shrill laughter as though
she saw thing that move her to merriment onli the regiment that
listen wa not merri for it had heard the word that the inkosazana
spoke in the town of mafooti foretel evil to the zulu becaus of the
blood that wa between them and her thei thought that she laugh over
the misfortun that were to come and over those that had alreadi
befallen them in the fire and in the rain
about middai thei halt to eat and as befor rachel took food in plenti
for now that her mind wa wander her bodi seem to call for
susten when their meal wa finish thei move down to the bank of
the buffalo river which ran near by to find that it wa in great flood
after the heavi rain and that it wa not safe to try the ford so thei
determin to camp there on the bank murmur among themselv that all
went ill with them upon thi journei as wa to be expect and that thei
would have done better if thei had spent the time in hunt down the
peopl of mafooti instead of sit idl like tire stork upon the
bank of a river yet bad as thing might seem thei were destin to be
wors for while some of them were cut bough and grass to make a hut
for the inkosazana rachel who stood watch them with empti ey of a
sudden laugh in her mad fashion and sped like a swallow to the lip of
the foam ford here befor thei could come up with her she threw off
the outer cloak she wore and rush into the water till the current bore
her from her feet then while the whole regiment shout in dismai she
began to swim strike out for the further bank and be swept
downward by the stream now tamboosa who wa almost craze with fear
lest she should drown call out that where the inkosazana went thei
must follow even to their death
it is so answer the soldier as each man lock hi arm round the
middl of him who stood in front compani by compani thei plung into
the water in a fourfold chain hope thu to bridg it from bank to bank
meanwhil rachel swam on in the strength of her mad as a woman ha
seldom swum befor again and again the muddi water broke over her head
and the soldier groan think that she wa drown but alwai that
golden hair reappear abov them a great tree swept down upon her but
she dive beneath it she wa dash against a tall rock but she ward
herself awai from it with her hand and still swam on till at length with
a shout of joi the zulu saw her find her feet and struggl slowli to the
further bank ye and up it till she reach it crest where she stood
and watch them idli as though unconsci of the danger she had pass
and of the water that ran from her hair and breast
where a woman can go we can follow said some but other answer
she is not a woman but a spirit death himself cannot kill her
now the fourfold chain wa near the centr of the ford when suddenli
those at the tip of it were lift from their feet as rachel had been nor
could those behind hold on to them thei were torn from their grasp and
swept awai the most of them never to be seen again for of these men but
few could swim thrice thi happen until strong swimmer were sent to
the front and at length these men won across as rachel had done and
caught hold of the stone on the further side thu form a live chain
from bank to bank whereof the centr float and wa bent outward by the
weight of the water as the back of a bow bend when the string is drawn
by the help of thi human rope thu form the compani began to come
over support themselv against it till present the strain and the
push of them and of the angri river overcam it strength and the chain
burst in the middl so that mani were born down the stream and drown
yet with risk and toil and loss it join itself togeth again and held
fast until everi man wa over save the sick and some lad who were left
to tend them and the cattl on the further bank then that cabl of brave
warrior began to struggl forward like a great snake drag it tail
after it and so by degre drew itself to safeti and gasp out foam
and water salut the inkosazana where she stood
mani were drown and other were bruis by rock but of thi thei
thought littl sinc she wa safe and thei had found her again to have
lost whom would have been a shame from gener to gener she
watch the captain reckon up the number of the dead and when
tamboosa and some of them came to make report of it to her a shadow as of
piti float across her stoni ey
not on my head she cri not on my head there is blood between the
inkosazana and her peopl of the zulu and that blood aveng itself in
blood and she laugh her eeri laugh
it is true it is just o queen answer tamboosa solemnli the nation
must pai for the sin of it children as the wild beast ibubesi ha paid
for hi sin
then as thei could travel no further that dai thei built a hut and lit a
great fire by which rachel sat and dri herself nor did she take ani
harm from the water for as the zulu had said it seem as though
noth could harm her now
the soldier also lit fire and despatch messeng to neighbour
kraal command them to bring food and to send maiden to attend on the
inkosazana while other went to a mountain to call all thi illtid
from hill to hill till it came to the great place of the king
chapter xviii
the curs of the inkosazana
that night the regiment and rachel slept upon the bank of the river and
noth happen save that lion carri off two soldier while two more
who had been injur against the rock di also other fell sick on
the follow morn food arriv in plenti from the neighbour kraal
and with it some girl of high birth to attend upon the inkosazana
but with these rachel would have noth to do and when thei came near to
her onli said
where is noie daughter of seyapi lead me to noie
so thei began their march again rachel walk as befor in the centr of
a ring of soldier and that night slept at a kraal upon a hill here
messeng from the king met them charg with mani fine word to which
rachel listen without understand them and then scare them awai with
her laughter also thei brought a beauti cloak made of the skin of a
rare white monkei and thi she took and wrap herself in it for she
seem to understand that her cloth were rag
that dai thei pass through fertil countri where much corn wa grown
here thei saw a strang sight for as thei went cloud seem to aris in
the sky from behind them which present were seen to be not cloud but
ten of million of great wing grasshopp that lit upon the corn
devour it and everi other green thing within a few hour noth wa
left except the root and bare branch while the women of that land ran
to and fro wail know that next winter thei and their children must
starv and the cattl low about them hungrili for the locust had
devour all the grass moreov have eaten everyth these insect
themselv began to die in myriad so that soon the air wa poison the
water were also poison with their dead bodi and at onc sick
came which present grew into a pestil
now the men of the countri sent a deput to the inkosazana prai
her to remov the curs but when thei had spoken she onli repeat the
word she had us upon the bank of the buffalo river
not on my head not on my head there is blood between the inkosazana and
her peopl of the zulu famin and war and death upon the peopl of the
zulu becaus thei have shed the holi blood
then the men grew afraid and went awai and the regiment march on
accompani by the myriad of the locust that wast all the land through
which thei pass
at length follow by a wail of miseri thei came to the great place and
enter it preced by the locust which alreadi were heap up in the
street like winter leav and for lack of other provend gnaw at the
straw of the hut and the shield and moocha of the soldier it wa a
strang sight to see the men try to stamp them to death and the women
and children rush to and fro shriek and brush them from their
hair
amid such scene as these thei pass through the town of umgugundhlovu
into which rachel had been brought in order that the peopl might see that
their inkosazana had return and on to that kraal upon the hill where
she had spent all those weari week until richard came she reach it as
the sun wa set and although she did not seem to know ani of them wa
receiv with joi and ador by the women who had been her attend
here she slept that night for thei thought that she must be too weari to
see the king at onc moreov he desir first to receiv the report of
tamboosa and the captain and to learn all that had happen in thi
strang busi
next morn whilst rachel sat by the pool in which onc she had seen
the vision of richard tamboosa and an escort came to bring her to
dingaan when thei told her thi she said neither yea nor nai but
refus to enter a litter thei had brought walk at the head of them
back to the great place and watch by thousand through the
locuststrewn street to the intunkulu the hous of the king here in

induna who rose to greet her with the royal salut she advanc toward
them slowli look more beauti than ever she had done but with wild
wander ey thei set a stool for her and she sat down on the stool
stare at the ground then as she said noth dingaan who seem veri
sad and full of fear command tamboosa to report all that had happen
in the ear of the council and he took up hi tale
he told of the journei to the tugela and of how the inkosazana and the
white lord dario had cross the river alon but a few hour after

ishmael among them those who had kill or caus to die the white
teacher and hi wife
upon the stern command of the king these men also told their stori sai
that thei had not meant to kill the white man and that what thei did wa

but who as thei now understood had dare to lai a plot to captur the

when he heard these word spoken in a strang wail voic dingaan
trembl for he knew that it wa he who had bidden hi dog to run
let them go he said and let the land see them no more for ever
so those men went thankfulli enough and the land saw them no more as
thei pass the gate other men enter starv and hungrylook men
whose bone almost pierc their skin and who carri in their hand
remnant of shield that look as though thei had been gnaw by rat
thei salut the king with feebl voic and squat down upon the

truli thi curs work fast and well exclaim dingaan then turn

peopl vengeanc on the soldier vengeanc on the corn vengeanc on the

then thei thrust him forth
he wa gone and for a while there wa silenc for despair fill the
heart of the king and hi councillor as thei gaze at rachel dismai
wonder within themselv how thei might be rid of her and of the evil
which she had brought upon them becaus of the blood of her peopl which
lai at her door
whilst thei still stare thu in silenc yet anoth messeng came
run through the gate like on in great hast
now i am mind to order thi fellow to be kill befor he open hi
mouth said dingaan for of a sureti he also is a bearer of
illtid
nai o king cri out the man in alarm my new is onli that an
embassi await without

nai o king from the queen of the ghostpeopl to whom thou didst
dispatch noie daughter of seyapi a while ago
hear the name noie rachel lift her head and for the first time her
face grew human
i rememb said dingaan admit the embassi
then follow a long paus at length the gate open and through it
appear noie herself clad in a garb of spotless white and somewhat
travelworn but beauti as ever she wa escort by four gigant men
who were nake except for their moocha but wore copper ornament on
their wrist and ankl and great ring of copper in their ear after
her came three litter whereof the grass curtain were tightli drawn
carri by bearer of the same size and race and after these a bodyguard
of fifti soldier of a like statur thi strang and barbarouslook
compani advanc slowli whilst the council stare at them wonder for
never befor had thei seen peopl so huge and arriv in front of the
king set down the litter stare back in answer with their great round
ey
as thei came rachel rose from her stool and turn slowli so that she and
noie who walk in front of the embassi stood face to face for a moment
thei gaze at each other then noie run forward knelt befor rachel
and kiss the hem of her robe but rachel bent down and lift her up in
her strong arm embrac her as a mother embrac a child
where hast thou been sister she ask i have sought thee long
sure on thy busi zoola answer noie scan her curious
dost thou not rememb
nai i rememb naught noie save that i have sought thee long my

ladi she said my peopl told me that it wa so thei told me mani
terribl thing thei who can see afar thei for whom distanc ha no
gate but i did not believ them now i see with my own ey be at
peac ladi my peopl will give thee back thy spirit though perchanc
thou must travel to find it for in their land all spirit dwell be at
peac and listen
with thee noie i am at peac repli rachel and still hold her
hand she reseat herself upon the stool
where ar the messeng ask dingaan i see none
king answer noie thei shall appear
then she made sign to the escort of giant some of whom came forward and
drew the curtain of the litter whilst other open huge umbrella of
split cane which thei carri in their hand
now what weapon ar these ask dingaan daughter of seyapi you know
that none mai appear befor the king arm
weapon against the sun o king which my peopl hate
and who ar the wizard that hate the sun queri dingaan again in an
astonish voic then he wa silent for out of the first litter came a
littl man pale as the shoot from a bulb that ha grown in dark with
larg soft ey like the ey of an owl that blink in the light and
long hair out of which all the colour seem to have fade
as the man who like noie wa dress in a white robe and in size
measur no more than a twelveyearold child set hi sandal feet upon
the ground on of the huge guard sprang forward to shield him with the
umbrella but be awkward struck hi leg against the pole of the litter
and stumbl against him nearli knock him to the ground and in hi
effort to save himself let fall the umbrella the littl man turn
on him furious and hold on hand abov hi head as though to shield
himself from the sun with the other point at him speak in a low
sibil voic that sound like the hiss of a snake thereon the guard
fell to hi knee and bend down with outstretch arm beat hi
forehead on the earth as though in prayer for merci the sight of thi
giant make supplic to on whom he could have kill with a blow
wa so strang that dingaan unabl to restrain hi curios ask noie
if the dwarf wa order the other to be kill
nai king answer noie for blood is hate to these peopl he is
sai that the soldier ha offend mani time therefor he curs him
and tell him that he shall wither like a pluck leaf and die without
see hi home again
and will he die ask dingaan
certainli king those upon whom the ghostpeopl lai their curs must
obei the curs moreov thi man deserv hi doom for on the journei
he kill anoth to take hi food
of a truth a terribl peopl said dingaan uneasili bid them lai no
curs on me lest thei should see more blood than thei wish for
it is foolish to threaten the great on of the ghostfolk king for
thei hear even what thei seem not to understand answer noie quietli
wow exclaim the king let my word be forgotten i am sorri that i
troubl them to come so far to visit me
meanwhil the offend had crept back upon hi hand and knee look
like a great beaten dog whilst anoth soldier take hi umbrella held
it over the angri dwarf also from the other litter two more dwarf had
descend so like to the first that it wa difficult to tell them apart
and were in the same fashion shelter by guard with umbrella mat were
brought for them also and on these thei sat themselv down at right
angl to dingaan and to rachel whose stool wa set in front of the
king whilst behind them stood three of their escort each hold an
umbrella over the head of on of them with the left hand while with the
right thei fan them with small branch upon which the leav although
thei were dead remain green and shine
with dingaan and hi council the three dwarf did not seem to troubl
themselv but at rachel thei peer earnestli then on of them made a
sign and mutter someth whereon a soldier of the escort step
forward with a fourth umbrella which he open over the head of rachel
and of noie who stood at her side
why doe he do that ask dingaan the inkosazana is not a bat that
she fear the sun
he doe it answer noie that the inkosazana mai sit in the shade of
the wisdom of the ghostpeopl and that her heart which is hot with mani
wrong mai grow cool in the shade
what doe he know about the inkosazana and her wrong ask dingaan
again but noie onli shrug her shoulder and made no answer
now on of the dwarf made anoth sign whereon more guard advanc
carri small bowl of polish wood these bowl thei set upon the
ground befor the three dwarf on befor each of them fill them to
the brim with water from a gourd
if your peopl ar thirsti noie exclaim the king i have beer for
them to drink for at least the locust have left me that bid them throw
awai the water and i will give them beer
it is not water king she answer but dew gather from certain
tree befor sunris and it is their spirit that ar thirsti for
knowledg not their bodi for in thi dew thei read the truth
then the inkosazana must be of their famili noie for she read of the
come of the white chief dario in water or so thei sai
perhap o king if it is so these prophet will know it and acknowledg
her
now for a long while there wa silenc so long a while inde that
dingaan and hi councillor began to move uneasili for thei felt as
though the dwarf men were finger their heartstr at length the
three dwarf lift their wrinkl face that were bleach to the colour
of halfrip corn and gaze at each other with their round owllik
ey then as though with on accord thei said to each other
what seest thou priest and at same sign from them noie translat the
word into zulu
now the first of them he who had curs the soldier spoke in hi low
hiss voic a voic like to the whisper of leav in the wind noie
render hi word
i see two maiden stand by a hous that move when cattl draw it on
of them is darkskin it is she and he point to noie the other is
fairskin it is she and he point to rachel thei cast each of
them a hair from her head into the air the black hair fall to the
ground but a spirit catch the hair of gold and bear it northward it
is the spirit of seyapi whom the zulu slew northward he bear it and
lai it in the hand of the mother of the tree and with it a messag
ye with it a messag repeat the other two nod their head
then on of them drew a littl packag wrap in leav from hi robe
and motion to noie that she should give it to rachel noie obei and
the man said
let us see if she ha vision tell us thou white on what li within
the leav
rachel who had been sit like a person in a dream took the packet
and without look at it answer

mine i see it but three knot have been ti therein thei ar three
great troubl

unfold mani layer of leav within the last leaf wa a golden hair
and in it were ti three knot
noie laid the hair upon the head of rachelit wa her then she show
it to the king and hi council who stare at the knot not know what
to sai and after thei had look at it refold it in the leav and
return the packet to the dwarf
now the dwarf who had read the pictur in hi bowl turn to him who sat
nearest and ask
what seest thou priest
the man stare at the limpid water and answer
i see thi place at night i see yonder king and hi councillor talk
to a white man with evil ey and the face of a hawk who ha been wound
on the head and foot i read their lip thei bargain togeth it is of
the bring of an old prophet and hi wife hither by forc i see the
prophet and hi wife in a hous and with them zulu by the command of
the white man with the evil ey the zulu kill the prophet whose head is
bald and hi wife di upon the bed befor thei kill the prophet he
slai on of the zulu with smoke that come from an iron tube
when he heard all thi dingaan groan but the dwarf who had spoken
take no heed of him said to the third dwarf
what seest thou priest to which that dwarf answer
i see the white on yonder stand on a hut but her spirit ha fled
from her it ha fled from her to haunt the tree in her hand is a spear
and below is the white man with the evil ey held by zulu i read her
word she sai that there is blood and he shiver as he said the word

disast on their arm i see it scatter plagu among their cattl i see
a dim shape that it summon stride toward thi land it travel fast
over a winter veld and the head of it is the head of a skull and the
name of it is famin
as he end hi word the three dwarf bent forward and with on movement
seiz their bowl and empti them on to the ground sai
earth earth drink drink and bear record of these vision
now the council wa much disturb for although there were great witch
doctor among them none had known magic like to thi onli dingaan stare
down brood then he look up and hi fat bodi shook with hoars
laughter
you plai pretti trick littl men he said with your giant and your
bough and your hut that open and your bowl of water but for all that
thei ar onli trick sinc noie or other have told you of these thing
that happen in the past now if you ar wizard inde read me the
riddl of the word of the inkosazana that she spoke befor her spirit
left her becaus of the evil act of the wolf ibubesi show me the answer
to them in your bowl of water littl men or be driven henc as cheat
and liar also tell us your name by which we mai know you
when noie had translat thi speech the three dwarf gather themselv
under on umbrella and spoke to each other then thei slid back to their
place and the first of them he who had curs the soldier said
king of the zulu i am eddo thi on my right is pani and that on my
left is hana we ar children of the mother of the tree we ar
highpriest of the greypeopl the dreampeopl who rule by dream and
wisdom not by spear as thou dost o king we ar the ghostk whom
the ghost obei we ar the master of the dead and the reader of
heart those ar our name and titl o king we have travel hither
becaus thou sentest a messeng of our own blood who whisper a strang
tale in the ear of the mother of the tree a tale of on of whom we knew
alreadi but desir to see and all three of them nod toward rachel
seat on her stool we will read thy riddl o king but first thou must
fix the fee
what do you demand ghostpeopl ask dingaan cattl ar somewhat
scarc here just now and wive i think would be of littl us to you
what is there then that you desir and i can give
thei look at each other then eddo said point with hi thin hand
upon which the nail grew long
we ask for the white on who sit there we think that her spirit dwell
with us alreadi and we ask her bodi that we mai join it to the spirit
again
now the council murmur but dingaan repli
onc we sought to keep her in whom dwelt the inkosazana of the zulu but
thing have gone amiss and she bring curs on us if shape and spirit
were join togeth again mayhap the curs would be taken off our
head yet we dare not give her to you unless she give herself of her
own will moreov first the divin then the pai is that enough
it is enough thei answer speak all togeth set out the matter
king of the zulu and we will see what we can do
then dingaan beckon to a man with a wither hand who sat close to him
listen and note all thing but sai noth and said
stand forth thou mopo and tell the tale
so mopo rose and began hi stori he told how he alon among the peopl of
the zulu had thrice seen the spirit of the inkosazana in the dai of the
blackonewhowasgon he told how mani moon ago the white man
ibubesi had come to the great place speak of a beauti white maiden
who wa known by the name of the inkosazanayzoola a maiden who rule
the lightn and wa not as other maiden ar and how he had been sent
to see her and found that as wa the spirit of the inkosazana which he
knew so wa thi maiden
wow he ad save that the on walk on air and the other on
earth thei ar the same
moreov as a spirit she seem wise he told of the trap of noie
and of the decoi of rachel into zululand and of the interview between
her and the king by moonlight when she smelt out noie now he wa go on
to speak of the question put by dingaan to the inkosazana and the answer
that she gave to him when on of the littl men who all thi while sat as
though thei were asleep blink their ey in the lightit wa
eddosaid
sure thou forgettest someth tongu of the king thou who ar name
mopo or umbopa son of makedama thou forgettest certain word which the
inkosazana whisper to thee when she threw her cloak about thy head er
thou fleddest awai from the council of the king of cours we do not know
the word but why dost thou not repeat them tongu of the king
mopo stare at them and hi teeth chatter then he answer
becaus thei have noth to do with the stori ghostmen becaus thei
were of my own death which is a littl matter
the three dwarf turn their head toward each other and said each to
the other
hearest thou priest and hearest thou priest and hearest thou priest
he sai that the word were of hi own death and have noth to do with
the stori and thei smile and nod and appear to go to sleep again
now mopo went on with hi tale he told of the question of the king how
he had ask the inkosazana whether he should fall upon the boer or let
them be of how she had search the heaven with her ey of how the
meteor had travel befor them and burst over the kraal umgugundhlovu
that star which she said wa thrown by the hand of the greatgreat the
umkulunkulu and of how she had sworn that she also heard the feet of a
peopl travel over plain and mountain and saw the river behind them
run red with blood lastli he told of how she had refus to add to
or take from her word or to set out their mean
then mopo sat himself down again in the circl of the councillor and
watch and hearken like a hungri wolf
ye have heard ghostmen said the king now if ye ar realli wise
interpret to us the mean of thi sai of the inkosazana and of the
run star which none can read
the priest awok and consult with each other then eddo said
thi matter is too high for us king of the zulu
dingaan heard and laugh angrili
i thought it i thought it he cri ye ar but cheat after all who
like ani common doctor repeat the gossip that ye have heard and pretend
that it is a messag from heaven now why should i not whip you from my
town with rod till ye see that red blood which ye so greatli fear
at the mention of the word blood the littl men seem to curl up like
cut grass befor fire then eddo smile a sickli smile and answer
be gentl king walk softli king we ar but poor cheat yet we will
do our best we or anoth for us a new bowl a big bowl a red bowl for
the red king and fill it to the brink with dew
as he pipe out the word a man from among their compani appear with a
vessel much larger than those into which thei had gaze and made of
beauti polish bloodhu wood that gleam in the sunlight eddo
took it in hi hand and anoth slave fill it with water from the gourd
the last drop of the water fill it to the brim then the three of them
mutter invoc over it and eddo beckon to noie bade her bear
it to the inkosazana that she might gaze therein
rachel receiv it and look as she look all the empti left her
ey which grew quick and activ and full of horror
thou seest someth maiden queri eddo

nai nai breath on the water thrice and fix the vision now bear the

rachel breath on the water thrice rose like on in a tranc and
advanc to dingaan place the brim bowl upon hi knee
look king look cri eddo and tell us if in what thou seest li an
answer to the oracl of the inkosazana
dingaan stare at the water angrili at first as on who smell a trick

kraal white men and zulu and the white men ar master and the zulu
drag them out to death the zulu conquer o my peopl it is as i thought
that it would bethat is the mean of the riddl of the inkosazana
good good said the council doubtless it shall come to pass
but the dwarf eddo onli smile again and wave hi hand

look

umgugundhlovu burn my royal hous burn and yonder come the white men

eddo wave hi hand sai
look again and tell us what thou seest king
unwillingli enough but as though he could not resist dingaan look and
said
i see a mountain whereof the top is like the shape of a woman and
between her knee is the mouth of a cave beneath the floor of that cave i
see bodi the bodi of a great man and the bodi of a girl she must have
been fair that girl
now when he heard thi the councillor who wa name mopo he with the
wither hand start up then sat down again but all were so intent
upon listen to dingaan that none notic hi movement save noie and
the priest of the ghost
i see a man a fat man come out of the cave went on dingaan he seem
to be wound and weari also hi stomach is sunken as though with hunger
two other men seiz him a tall warrior with muscl that stand out on hi
leg and anoth that is thin and short thei drag him up the mountain to
a great cleft that is between the breast of her who sit thereon thei
speak with him but i cannot see their face for thei ar wrap in
mist or the face of the fat man for that also is wrap in mist thei
hale him to the edg of the cleft thei hurl him over he fall headlong
and the mist is swept from hi face ah it is my own face footnot
see nada the lili chapter xxxv
priest whisper each of the littl men to hi fellow in the dead
silenc that follow priest thi king sai that he see hi own face
priest tell me now ha not the spirit of the inkosazana interpret the
oracl of the inkosazana will not yonder king be hurl down thi cleft
is he not the star that fall
and thei nod and smile at each other
but dingaan leapt up in hi rage and terror and with him leapt up the
councillor and witch doctor all save he who wa name mopo son of
makedama who sat still gaze at the ground dingaan leapt up and
seiz the bowl hurl it from him so that the water in it fell over
rachel like rain from the cloud he leapt up and he curs the
ghostpriest as evil wizard bid them begon from hi land he rave
at them he threaten them he curs them again and again the littl
men sat still and smile till he grew weari and ceas then thei spoke to
each other sai
he ha sprinkl the white on with the dew of out tree and henceforth
she belong to the tree is it not so priest
thei nod in assent and eddo rose and address the king in a new
voic a shrill command voic sai
o man thou that art call a king and causest much blood to flow thou
ar but a bubbl on a river of blood thou slayer that shalt be slain
thou thrower of spear upon whom the spear shall fall thou who shalt look
upon the face of stone that know not piti thou whom the earth shall
swallow thou who shalt perish at the hand of
the face of the slayer were veil priest broke in the other two
dwarf peep up at him from beneath the shadow of their umbrella
sure the face of those slayer were veil o priest
thou who shalt perish at the hand of aveng whose face ar veil
thy riddl is read for thee as the mother of the tree decre that it
should be read it is well read it is truli read it shall befal in it
season now give to thy servant their reward and let them depart in
peac give to them that white on whose lost spirit spoke to thee from

take her roar dingaan take her and begon for to the zulu she and
noie the witch bring naught but ill
but on of the council cri
the inkosazana cannot be sent awai with these magician unless it is her
will to go
then the littl men nod to noie and noie whisper in the ear of
rachel
rachel listen and answer whither thou goest noie thither i go with
thee i who seek my spirit
so noie took rachel by the hand and led her from the councilplac of the
king and as she went follow by the ghostpriest and their escort for
the last time all the councillor rose up and gave to her the royal
salut onli dingaan sat upon the ground and beat it with hi fist in
furi
thu did the inkosazanayzoola depart from the great place of the king of
the zulu and mopo the son of makedama shade hi ey with hi hand
watch her go from between hi wither finger
chapter xix
rachel find her spirit
northward ever northward journei rachel with the ghostpriest for
dai and week thei journei slowli and for the most part at night
sinc these peopl dread the glare of the sun sometim she wa born
along in a litter with noie upon the shoulder of the huge slave but
more often she walk between the litter in the midst of a guard of
soldier for now she wa so strong that she never seem to weari nor
even in the fever swamp where mani fell ill did ani sick touch her
also thi labour of the bodi seem to sooth her wander and torment
mind as did the touch of noi hand and the sound of noi voic at
time howev her mad got hold of her and she broke out into those
burst of wild laughter which had scare the zulu then eddo would
descend from hi litter and lai hi long finger on her forehead and look
into her ey in such a fashion that she went to sleep and wa at peac
but if noie spoke to her in these sleep she answer her question and
even talk reason as she had done befor the peopl of mafooti laid
the bodi of richard at her feet and she stood upon the roof of the hut
which ishmael strove to climb
thu it wa that noie came to learn all that had happen to her sinc
thei part for though she had gather much from them the zulu could
not or would not tell her everyth in past dai she had heard from
rachel of the lad richard darrien who had been her companion year
befor through that night of storm on the island in the river and now she
understood that her ladi love thi richard and that it wa becaus of
hi murder by the wild brute ibubesi that she had becom mad
ye she wa mad and for that reason noie rejoic that the dwarf peopl
were take her to their home sinc if she could be cure at all thei
were abl to heal her thei the great doctor moreov if these priest
and the zulu would have let her go whither els could she have gone
whose parent and lover were dead except to the white peopl on the
coast who did not rever the insan as do all black folk but would
have lock her up in a hous with other like her until she di no
although she knew that there were danger befor them mani and great
danger noie rejoic that thing had befallen thu
also in her tender care alreadi rachel improv much and noie believ
that on dai she would be herself again onli she wish that she and her
ladi were alon togeth that there were no priest with them and abov
all no eddo for eddo as she knew well wa jealou of her author over
rachel jealou too of the love that thei bore on to the other he wish
to us thi craze white chieftai who had been accept as their
inkosazana by the great zulu peopl for hi own purpos thi had been
clear from the begin and that wa why when he first heard of her he
had consent to go on the embassi to dingaan sinc by hi magic he could
forese much of the futur that wa dark to noie whose blood wa mix
and who had not all the gift of the ghostk
moreov the mother of the tree wa noi great aunt be the sister
of her grandfath or of hi father noie wa not sure which for she had
dwelt among them but a few dai and never thought to inquir of the
matter but of on thing she wa sure that eddo the first priest hate
thi mother of the tree who wa name nya and desir that when her
tree fell the next mother should be hi servant which nya wa not
perhap reflect noie it wa in hi mind that her ladi would fill thi
part and be mad obei him in all thing
still she kept a watch upon her word and even on her thought for eddo
and hi fellowpriest pani and hana were abl to peer into human
heart and read their secret also she protect rachel from him as much
as she wa abl never leav her side for a moment howev weari she
might be for she fear lest he should becom the master of her will
onli when the fit of mad fell upon her mistress she wa forc to
allow eddo to quell them with hi touch and ey sinc herself she lack
thi power nor dare she call the other to her help for thei were under
the hand of eddo
northward ever northward first thei pass through the zulu and their
subject tribe who knew of them and of the inkosazana all of these were
suffer from the curs that lai upon the land becaus as thei believ
there wa blood between the inkosazana and her peopl the locust
devour their crop and the plagu ravag their cattl so that thei
were terrifi of her and of the littl greyfolk with whom she
travel the wizard who had shown fear thing to dingaan and left
him sick with dread thei fled at their approach onli leav a few of
their old peopl to prostrat themselv befor thi inkosazana who
wander in search of her own spirit and the dreammen who dwelt with the
ghost in the heart of a forest and to prai her and them to lift thi
cloud of evil from the land bring gift of such thing as were left to
them
at length all the zulu were pass and thei enter into the territori
of other tribe wild wander tribe
but even these knew of the ghostk and attempt noth against
them as thei had attempt noth against noie and her escort when she
travel through thi land on her embassi to the peopl of the tree
inde some of their doctor would visit them at their camp and ask an
oracl or an interpret of dream or a charm against their enemi
or a deadli poison offer great gift in return at time eddo and hi
fellowpriest would listen and the giant would bring a tini bowl fill
with dew into which thei gaze tell them the pictur thei saw there
though thi thei did but seldom as the suppli of dew which thei had
brought with them from their own countri ran low and sinc it could not
be us twice thei kept it for their own purpos
next thei came to a countri of vast swamp where dwelt few men and mani
wild beast a countri full of fever and reed and pool in which live
snake and crocodil yet no harm came to them from these thing for the
ghostpriest had medicin that ward off sick and charm that
protect them from all evil creatur and in their bowl thei read what
road to take and how danger could be avoid so thei pass the swamp
safe onli here that slave whom eddo had curs at the kraal of dingaan
and who from that dai onward had wast till he seem to be noth but a
great skeleton sicken and di
did i not tell you that it should be so said eddo to the other slave
who trembl befor him as reed trembl in the wind be warn ye
fool who think that the strength of men li in their bodi and their
spear then he kick the corps of the dead giant gentli with hi
sandal foot and bade hi brother throw him into a pool for the
crocodil to eat
have pass the swamp and mani river at length thei turn westward
travel for dai over grassi upland like to those of natal among
which wander pastor tribe with their herd of cattl on these plain
were multitud of game and mani lion especi in the bushclad slope
of great isol mountain that rose up here and there these lion
roar round them at night but the priest did not seem to be afraid for
when the brute becam overbold thei place deadli poison in the carcas
of buck that the nomad tribe brought them as offer of which the
lion at and di in number also thei sold some of the poison to the
tribe for a great price in cattl as to the deliveri of which cattl thei
gave minut direct for thei knew that none dare to cheat the mother
of the tree and her prophet
after the plain were left behind thei reach a vast fertil and
lowli countri that slope upward for mile and mile which as noie
explain to rachel when she would listen wa the outer territori of the
ghostpeopl for here dwelt the race of the umkulu or great on who
were their slave that folk to which the soldier of their escort
belong of these there were thousand and ten of thousand who earn
their live by agricultur sinc although thei were so huge and
fiercelook thei did not fight unless thei were attack the chief
of thi peopl had their dwell in vast cave in the side of cliff
which if need be could be turn into impregn fortress but their
real ruler wa the mother of the tree and their offic wa to protect
the countri of the tree and furnish it with food sinc the treepeopl
were dreamer who did littl work
while thei travel through thi land all the headmen of the umkulu
accompani them and everi morn a council wa held at which these made
report to the priest of all that had chanc of late and laid their
caus befor them for judgment these caus eddo and hi fellowpriest
heard and settl as seem best to them nor did ani dare to disput
their rule inde even when thei depos a high chief and set anoth
in hi place the man who had lost all knelt befor them and thank them
for their good also thei tri crimin who had stolen women or
commit murder but thei never order such men to be slain outright
sometim eddo would look at them dreamili and curs them in hi slow
hiss voic bid them wast in bodi and in mind as he had done to
the soldier at umgugundhlovu and die within on year or two or three
as the case might be or sometim if the crime wa veri bad he would
command that thei should be sent to travel in the desert that is
wander to and fro without food or water until death found them now and
again miserablelook men mere skeleton with hollow cheek and ey
that seem to start from their head would appear at their camp weep
and implor that the curs which had been laid upon them in past dai
should be taken off their head at such peopl eddo and hi
brotherpriest pani and hana would laugh softli ask them how thei
throve upon the wrath of the mother of the tree and whether thei thought
that other who saw them would be encourag to sin as thei had done but
when the poor wretch prai that thei might be kill outright with the
spear the priest shrank up in horror beneath their umbrella and ask
if thei were mad that thei should wish them to sprinkl their tree with
blood
on morn a number of these bewitch umkulu men women and children
appear and when the three priest mock them as wa their wont and
the guard some of whom were their own rel sought to beat them
awai with stick threw themselv upon the ground and burst into weep
rachel who wa camp at a littl distanc with noie in a reed tent that
the guard had made for her which thei fold up and carri as thei did
the umbrella heard the sound of thi lament and came out follow
by noie for a space she stood contempl their miseri with a troubl
air then ask noie why these peopl seem so starv and why thei wept
noie told her that when she wa on her embassi the head of their kraal an
enorm man of middl ag whom she point out to rachel had sought to
detain her becaus she wa beauti and he wish to make her hi wife
although he knew well that she wa on an embassi to the mother of the
tree she had escap but it wa for thi reason that the curs of which
thei were perish had been laid upon him and hi folk
now rachel went on to where the three priest sat beneath their umbrella
doze awai the hour of sunlight beckon to the doom famili to
follow her
wake priest she cri in a loud voic and thei look up astonish
rub their ey and ask what wa the matter
thi said rachel i command you to lift the weight of your maledict
off the head of these peopl who have suffer enough
thou commandest us exclaim eddo astonish and if we will not
beauti on what then
then answer rachel i will lift it and set it on to your head
and you shall perish as thei ar perish oh you think me mad you
priest who kill more cruelli than did the zulu and mad i am whose
spirit wander yet i tell you that new power grow within me though
whenc thei come i know not and what i sai i can perform
now thei stare at her mutter togeth and send for a wooden bowl
peep into it whatev it wa thei saw there did not pleas them for at
length eddo address the crowd of suppliant sai
the mother of the tree forgiv the knot she ti she loos the tree
she plant she dig up you ar forgiven bone put on strength mouth
receiv food ey forget your blind and feet your wander grow
fat and laugh increas and multipli for the curs we give you a
bless such is the will of the mother of the tree
nai nai cri rachel when she understood their word believ him
not ye starvel such is the will of the inkosazana of the zulu she
who ha lost her spirit and anoth and travel all thi weari wai to
find them
then her mad seem to come upon her again for she toss her arm on
high and burst into on of her wild fit of laughter but those whom she
had redeem heed it not for thei ran to her and sinc thei dare not
touch her or even her robe kiss the ground on which she had stood and
bless her moreov from that moment thei began to mend and within a
few dai were chang folk thi noie knew for thei follow up rachel to
the confin of the desert and she saw it with her ey also the fame of
the deed spread among the umkulu peopl who groan under the cruel rule
of the ghostk and mad or sane from that dai forward thei ador
rachel even more than the zulu had done and like the zulu believ her
to be a spirit no mere human be thei declar could have lift off
the curs of the mother of the tree from those upon whom it had fallen
thenceforward eddo pani and hana hid their judgment from rachel and
would not suffer such suppliant to approach the camp also when thei
seiz a number of men becaus these had conspir togeth to rebel
against the ghostpeopl and brought them on toward their own countri
for a certain purpos thei forc them to act as bearer like the other
so that rachel might not guess their doom for now with all their power
thei also were afraid of thi white inkosazana as dingaan had been
afraid
so thei travel up thi endless slope of fertil land leav all the
kraal of the giant umkulu behind them and on morn at the dawn
camp upon the edg of a terribl desert a place of dry sand and
sunblast rock that look like the bottom of a drain ocean where
noth live save the fire lizard and certain venom snake that
buri themselv in the sand all except their head and onli crawl
out at night after the peopl of the umkulu thi horribl wast wa the
great defenc of the ghostk whose countri it ring about sinc
none could pass it without guid and water inde noie had been forc
to stai here for dai with her escort until the mother of the tree
learn of her come in some strang fashion had sent priest and
guard to bring her to her land but the zulu who were with her thei did
not bring except on witchdoctor to bear wit to her word these
thei left among the umkulu till she should return nor were those zulu
sorri who had alreadi heard enough of the magic of the ghostk and
fear to come face to face with them
but it is true that thei also fear the umkulu whom becaus of their
great size and the fierc of their air the zulu took to be evil
spirit though if thi were so thei could not understand why thei should
obei a hand of grei dwarf who live far from them beyond the desert
still these umkulu did them no harm for on her return noie found them
all safe and well
that afternoon rachel and the dwarf plung into the dread wilder
head straight for the ball of the sink sun here although she
wish to do so she wa not allow to walk for fear lest the serpent
should bite her said eddo but must journei in the litter with noie so
thei enter it and were born forward at a great pace the bearer
travel at a run and be often chang also mani other bearer came
with them and on the shoulder of each of them wa strap a hide bag of
water of thi thei soon discov the reason for the sand of that
wilder wa white with salt the air also seem to be full of salt so
that the thirst of those who travel there wa sharp and constant and
if it could not be satisfi thei di
it wa a veri strang journei and although she did not seem to take much
note of them at the time it detail and surround burn themselv
deepli into rachel mind the hush of the infinit desert the white
moonlight gleam upon the salt white sand the tall rock which stood
up here and there like unfinish obelisk and coloss statu the snowi
cloud of dust that rose beneath the feet of the compani the hoars
shout of the guid the close heat the halt for water which wa
greedili swallow in great gulp the occasion cry and confus when a
man fell out exhaust or becaus he had been bitten by on of the
serpentsal these thing amongst other were veri strang
onc rachel ask vagu what becam of these outworn and snakepoison
men and noie onli shook her head in answer for she did not think fit to
tell her that thei were left to find their wai back or to perish as
might chanc
all that night and for the first hour of the dai that follow thei went
forward swiftli camp at last to eat and sleep in the shadow of a mass
of rock that look like a gigant castl with wall and tower here
thei remain in the burn heat until the sun began to sink onc more
and then went on again leav some of the bearer behind them becaus
there wa no longer water for so mani there the great men sat in patient
resign and watch them go thei who knew that have littl or no
water few of them could hope to see their home again still so great
wa their dread of the ghostpriest that thei never dare to murmur or
to ask that ani of the store of water should be given to them thei who
were but cattl to be us until thei di
the second night journei wa like the first for thi desert never
chang it aspect and on the follow morn thei halt beneath
anoth pile of fantast sandburnish rock from some of which hung
salt like icicl here on of the bearer who had been deni water as a
punish for lazi although in truth he wa sick began to suck the
salticicl suddenli he went rave mad and rush with a knife at
eddo pani and hana where thei sat under their cane umbrella that for
the sake of cool were damp with thi preciou water he tri to
kill them
then as thei saw the knife gleam all their imperturb calm depart
from these dwarf thei squeak in terror with thin voic as rat speak
thei roll upon the ground yell to the slave to save them from a red
death the man wa seiz and though he fought with all hi giant
strength held down and choke in the sand onc howev he twist hi
head free howl a curs at them also he manag to hurl hi knife at
eddo and the point of it scratch him on the hand caus the pale
blood to flow a sight at which eddo and the other priest broke into
tear and lament that continu long after the umkulu wa dead
why ar thei such coward ask rachel dreamili for she had not seen
the murder of the slave and thought that eddo had onli scratch himself
becaus thei fear the sight of blood zoola answer noie which is a
veri evil omen to them death thei do not fear who ar alreadi among
ghost but if it is a red death their soul ar spilt with their life
or so thei believ
toward noon that dai the sky bank up with luridcolour cloud the
sun which should have shone so hotli went out and a hush that wa almost
fear in it heat and intens fell upon the desert the umkulu
bearer becam disturb and gather togeth into knot talk in low
tone eddo and hi brother priest who either becaus of the adventur
of the morn or the oppress air could not sleep as wa usual with
them were also disturb thei crept from beneath their umbrella which
as the sun had vanish were of no us to them and stood togeth
stare at the salti plain which under that leaden and lower sky
look white as snow and at the brood cloud abov thei even sent for
their bowl to read in them pictur of what wa about to happen but
there wa no dew left so these could not be us
then thei consult with the captain of the bearer who told then what
no magic wa need to guess that a mighti storm wa gather and that
if it overtook them in the desert thei would be buri beneath the
drift sand now thi wa a white death which the dwarf did not seem
to desir so thei order an instant departur instead of delai the
start until sunset as thei had intend for then if all went well thei
would have arriv at their home by dawn and not in the middl of the
night so that litter were made readi and thei went forward through the
overpow heat that caus the bearer to hang out their tongu and
reel as thei walk
toward even the storm began to stir littl wander puff of wind
blew upon them and di awai and lightn flicker intermitt
then a hot breez sprang up that gradual increas in strength until the
sand roll and rippl befor it now on wai and now anoth for thi
breez seem to blow in turn from everi quarter of the heaven suddenli
howev after try them all it settl in the west and drove straight
into their face with ever increas forc now eddo thrust out hi head
between the curtain of hi litter and call to the bearer to hurri as
thei had but a littl distanc of desert left to pass after which came
the grass countri where there would be no danger from the sand thei heard
and obei chang the pole gang frequent as those who carri the
litter becam exhaust
but the storm wa quicker than thei it burst upon them while thei were
still in the wast though not in it full strength then the dark
came utter dark for no moon or star could be seen and salt and
sand drove down on them like hail through it all the bearer fought on
though how thei found their wai noie who wa watch them could not
guess sinc no landmark were left to guid them thei fought on
blind choke with the salt sand that drove into their ey and lung
till man after man thei fell down and perish other took their place
and yet thei fought on
it must have been near to midnight when the compani or those who were
left of them stagger to the edg of that dread wilder which wa
but a vast plain of stone and sand border on the west as on the east by
slope of fertil soil for a while the fierc tempest lift a littl
and the light of the star which struggl through break in the cloud
show that thei were march down a steep descent of grassland thu
thei went on for sever more hour till at length the bearer of the
litter in which were rachel and noie who for a long time had been
stagger to and fro like drunken men came to a halt and litter and
all sank to the ground utterli exhaust
rachel and noie disentangl themselv from the litter for thei were
unhurt and stood by it not know where to go till present two other
litter contain the priest came up for the third had been abandon
and it occup crowd in with eddo now a great clamour aros in the
dark the priest hiss command to the surviv bearer to take up
the litter and proce but great as wa their strength thi the poor men
could not do there thei lai upon the ground answer that eddo might
curs them if he wish or even kill them as their brother had been
kill but thei were unabl to stir anoth step until thei had rest
and drunk where thei were there thei must lie until rain fell then the
priest wish rachel to enter on of their litter leav noie to walk
which thei were afraid to do themselv but when she understood rachel
cut the matter short by answer
not so i will walk and pick up the spear of on of the fallen
umkulu to serv as a staff she took noie by the hand and start forward
down the hill
on of the priest clasp her robe to draw her back but she turn on
him with the spear whereon he shrank back into hi litter like a snail
into hi shell and left her alon so follow the steep path thei
march on and after them came the two litter with the priest carri
by all the bearer who could still stand for these old men weigh no
more than children from far below them rose a mighti sound as of an angri
sea
what is that nois call rachel into the ear of noie for the gale wa
rise again
the sound of wind in the forest where the treefolk dwell she answer
then the dawn broke an aw bloodr dawn and by degre thei saw
beneath them ran a shallow river and beyond it stretch for leagu
upon leagu farther than the ey could see lai the mighti forest whereof
the tree soar two hundr feet or more into the air the dark
illimit forest that roll as the sea roll beneath the pressur of
the gale and inde seen from abov look like a green and toss
ocean at the sight of the water rachel and noie began to run toward it
hand in hand for thei were parch with thirst whose mouth were full of
the salt dust of the desert the bearer of the litter in which were the
three priest ran also pai no heed to the cri of the dwarf within
at length it wa reach and throw themselv down thei drank until
that rage thirst of their wa satisfi even eddo and hi companion
crawl out of their litter and drank then have wash their hand and
face in the cool water thei ford the fleet stream and fill with a
new life follow the road that ran beyond toward the forest scarc
had thei set foot upon the farther bank when the heart of the tempest
which had been eddi round them all night long burst over them in it
furi the lightn blaze the thunder roll and the wild wind grew to
a hurrican so fierc that the litter in which were eddo pani and hana
were torn from the grasp of the bearer and roll upon the ground from
the wreck of them for thei were but frail thing the littl grei priest
emerg trembl or rather were drag by the hand of their giant
bearer to whom thei clung as a frighten infant cling to it mother
rachel saw them and laugh
look at the master of magic she cri to noie those who kill with a
curs those who rule the ghost and she point to the tini
contempt figur with flutter robe be drag along by those
giant whom but a littl while befor thei had threaten with death
i see them answer noie into her ear their spirit ar strong when
thei ar at peac but in troubl thei fear doom more than other now if
i were those umkulu i would make an end of them while thei can
but these great patient men did otherwis inde when the dwarf worn
out and bewild by the hurrican could walk no more thei took them up
and carri them as a woman carri a babe
now thei were pass a belt of open land between the river and the forest
in which terrifi mob of cattl rush to and fro while their herd
slavemen of larg size like the umkulu tri to drive them to some place
where thei would be safe from the tempest in thi belt also grew broad
field of grain which furnish food for the treefolk at last thei came
to the confin of the forest and rachel look round her with
wonder ey saw at the foot of each great tree a tini hut shape like
a tent and in front of the hut a dwarf seat on the ground stare into
a bowl of water and beat hi breast with hi hand
what do thei she ask of noie
thei strive to read their fate ladi and weep becaus the wind rippl
the dew in their bowl so that thei can see noth and cannot be sure
whether their tree will stand or fall follow me follow me i know the
wai here we ar not safe
the hurrican wa at it height the huge tree about them rock and bent
like reed great bough came crash down on of them fell upon a
prai dwarf and crush him to a pulp those around him saw it and
utter a wild shrill scream eddo pani and hana saw it and scream
also in the arm of their bearer for thi sight of blood wa terribl
to them the forest wa aliv with the voic of the storm it seem to
howl and groan and the lightn illumin it gloomi aisl the
grandeur and the fear of the scene excit rachel she wave the
spear she carri and began to laugh in the wild fashion of her mad
so that even the grei dwarf seat each at the foot of hi tree ceas
from hi prayer to glanc at her askanc
on thei went expect death at everi step but alwai escap it until
thei reach a wide clear in the forest in the centr of thi clear
grew a tree more huge than ani that rachel had ever dream of the bole
of it that sprang a hundr feet without a branch wa thicker than
dingaan great hut and it topmost bough were lost in the scud
cloud in front of thi tree wa gather a multitud of peopl men
women and children all dwarf and all of them on their knee engag in
prayer at it bole by a tentshap hous stood a littl figur a
woman whose long grei hair stream upon the wind
the mother of the tree cri noie through the scream gale come to
her she will shelter us and she grip rachel arm to lead her
forward
scarc had thei gone a step when the lightn blaze abov them
fearfulli and with it came an aw rush of wind perhap that flash fell
upon the tree or perhap the wind snap it root at least it mighti
trunk burst in twain and with a crash that for a moment seem to master
even the roar of the vollei thunder down it came to earth two huge
limb fell on either side of rachel and noie but thei were not touch a
bough struck the umkulu slave who wa carri eddo and swept off hi
head leav the dwarf unharm anoth bough fell upon pani and hi
bearer and buri them in the earth beneath it bulk so that thei were
never seen again as it chanc the most of the worshipp were beyond
the reach of the fall branch but some of these that were torn loos
in the fall or shatter by the lightn the wind caught and hurl
among them slai sever and wound other
in ten second the catastroph had come and gone the queentre that had
rule the forest for a thousand year wa down a stack of green leav
through which the shatter branch show like bone and a prostrat
splinter trunk the shock threw noie and rachel to the ground but
rachel rise swiftli pull noie to her feet after her then act
upon some impuls leapt forward and climb on to the trunk where it
fork ran down it till she almost reach it base and stood there
against the great shield of earth that had been torn up with the root
after that last fear outburst a still fell the storm seem to
have exhaust itself at ani rate for a while rachel wa abl to get her
breath and look about her
all around were line of enorm tree solemn aisl that seem to lead
up to the queen of the tree and down these aisl pierc the shadow
cast by the interlac branch overhead shone the light of that lurid
morn rachel saw and someth struggl in the dark of her brain
as the light struggl in the dark of the forest aisl she
rememberedoh what wa it she rememb now she knew it wa the dream
she had dream upon the island in the river year and year ago a dream
of such tree as these and of littl grei peopl like to these and of
the boi richard grown to manhood lash to the trunk of on of the
tree what had happen to her she could recal noth sinc she saw
the bodi of richard upon it bier in the kraal mafooti
but thi wa not the kraal mafooti nor had noie who stood at her side
been with her there noie who had gone on an embassi to her father
folk the dwarf peopl ah these peopl were dwarf look at them run
to and fro scream like littl monkei she must have been dream a
long bad dream whereof the pictur had escap her doubtless she wa
still dream and present would awak well the torment had gone out
of it and the fear onli the wonder remain she would stand still and
see what happen someth wa happen now a littl thin hand
appear grip the rough bark at the side of the fallen tree
she peep over the swell of it and saw an old dwarf woman with long white
hair whose feet were set in a cleft of the shatter bole and who hung
to it as an ap hang beneath her to the ground wa a fall of full thirti
feet for the base of the bole wa held high up by the root so that the
littl woman hair hung down straight toward the ground whither she
must present fall and be kill rachel wonder how she had come there
if she had clung to the trunk when it fell or been thrown up by the
shock or lift by a bough next she wonder how long it would be befor
she wa oblig to leav go and whether her white head or her back would
first strike the earth all that depth beneath then it occur to her
that she might be save
hold my feet she said to noie who had follow her along the trunk
speak in her own natur voic at the sound of which noie look at
her in joy wonder hold my feet i think i can reach that old woman
and without wait for an answer she laid herself down upon the bole her
bodi hang over the curv of it
now noie saw her purpos and seat herself with her heel set against
the rough of the bark grasp her by the ankl support some of
her weight on on hand with the other rachel reach downward all the
length of her long arm and just as the grasp of the old woman below wa
slacken contriv to grip her by the wrist the dwarf swung loos
hang in the air but she wa veri light of the weight of a
fiveyearold child perhap no more and rachel wa veri strong with an
effort she lift her up till the monkeylik finger grip the rough
bark again anoth effort and the littl bodi wa rest on the round of
the tree on more and she wa besid her
now rachel rose to her feet again and laugh but it wa not the mad
laughter that had scare ishmael and the zulu it wa her own laughter
that of a healthi cultur woman
the littl creatur crouch on hand and knee at rachel feet lift
her head and stare with her round ey at that moment too the sun
broke out and it rai shine where thei had never shone for ag fell
upon rachel upon her bright hair and the white robe in which the dwarf

which wa cover with narrow and shine green leav and hold it in
her hand return to rachel
i will plant it she said and perchanc it will grow to be the hous
of queen unborn come now come and she turn her face toward the

the thunder had roll awai and from time to time the sun shone fierc
so fierc that unabl to bear it rai all the dwarf who were
gather about the fallen tree had retreat into the shadow of the other
tree around the open space there thei stood and sat watch the three

scarc were the word out of hi mouth when thei heard a crash which
caus them to look round a bough broken by the storm had fallen from

ah pipe the other dwarf point toward the corps with their
finger and close their ey to shut out the sight of blood ah nya
is right she still ha power those who would kill her must wait till her
tree di
take no heed of what had happen nya walk on into the forest for a
while rachel note the littl hut built each of them at the foot of a
tree there were hundr of these hut that thei could see show that
the peopl were mani but by degre thei grew fewer onli on wa visibl
here and there set beneath some particularli vigor and handsom
timber at last thei ceas altogeth thei had pass through that citi
the strangest citi in the world
treeseverywher tree hundr of tree ten of thousand of tree
soar up to heaven make a canopi of their interlac bough
shut out the light so that beneath them wa a deep oppress gloom
there wa silenc also for if ani beast or bird dwelt there the
hurrican had scare them awai silenc onli broken from time to time by
the crash of some giant of the forest that it length of dai fulfil
at last sank suddenli to ruin to be buri in a tomb of brushwood whenc
in due cours it successor would aris
anoth life gone said the old woman nya flit befor them like a
littl grei ghost everi time that thi weird sound struck upon their
ear whose wa it i wonder i will look in my bowl i will look in my
bowl
for as rachel discov afterward these peopl believ that the
spirit of each tree of the forest is attach to the spirit of a human
be although that be mai dwell in other land far awai which di
when the tree di sometim slowli by diseas and sometim in swift
collaps so that thei pass togeth into the world of ghost
on thei flit through the gloom on for mile after mile although the
leafstrewn ground show no trace of it evid thei were follow
some kind of path for no fallen trunk bar their progress nor were
there ani creeper or brushwood although to right and left of them all
these could be seen in plenti at last quit of a sudden for the bole of
a tree at the end of the path had hidden it from them thei came upon a
clear in the forest it seem to be a natur or at ani rate a veri
ancient clear sinc in it no stump were visibl nor ani scrub or
creeper onli tall grass and flower plant in the centr of thi
place cover a quarter of it perhap wa a vast circular wall fifti
feet or more in height and cloth with fern thi wall thei note wa
built of huge block of stone so huge inde that it seem wonder
that thei could have been move by human be at the sight of that
marvel wall rachel and noie halt involuntarili and noie ask
who made it mother
the giant who live when the world wa young can our hand lift such
stone nya answer as bend down she thrust the top shoot from her
fallen tree deep into the humid soil then ad on child there is
danger here
as she spoke someth hiss through the air just abov her head and
stuck fast in the bark of a sapl noie sprang forward and pluck it
out it wa a littl reed feather with grass and have a sharp
ivori point smear with some green substanc
touch it not cri nya it is deadli poison eddo work eddo work
but my hour is not yet into the open befor anoth come
so thei ran forward all three of them see and bear noth of the
shooter of the arrow as thei approach the titan wall thei saw that it
enclos a mound on the top of which mound grew a cedarlik tree with
branch so wide that thei seem to overshadow half of the enclosur
there were no gate to thi wall but while thei wonder how it could be
enter nya led them to a kind of cleft in it stone not more than two
feet in width across which cleft were stretch string of plait grass
she press herself against them break them and walk forward
follow by rachel and noie suddenli thei heard a nois abov them and
look up saw whiterob dwarf perch upon the stone of the cleft
hold bent bow in their hand whereof the arrow were point at their
breast nya halt beckon to them whereon recognis her thei
drop the arrow into the littl quiver which thei wore and scrambl
off whither rachel could not see
these ar the guardian of the templ that cannot either speak or hear
who were summon by the break of the thread said nya and went
forward again
now to the right and now to the left ran the narrow path that wound it
wai in the thick of the mighti wall which tower so high abov them
that thei walk almost in dark and at each turn of it were recess
and abov these project stone where archer could stand for it
defenc at length thi path end in a culdesac for in front of them
wa noth but blank masonri whilst rachel and noie stare at it
wonder whither thei should go now a larg stone in thi wall turn
leav a narrow doorwai through which thei pass whereon it shut again
behind them though by what machineri thei could not see
thu thei pass through the wall emerg howev at a differ point
in it circumfer to that at which thei had enter in the centr of
the enclosur rose the hill of earth that thei had seen from without
which evid wa kept free from weed and swept and on it crest grew
the huge cedarlik tree the tree of the tribe between the base of thi
hill and the foot of the wall wa a wide ring of level ground also swept
and weed and on thi space neatli arrang in line were hundr of
littl hillock that resembl antheap
the buryingplac of the ghostpriest ladi said nya nod at the
hillock soon my bone will be ad to them
walk across thi strang cemeteri thei came to the foot of the mound
that wa entir overshadow by the cedar abov from the outspread
limb of which hung long grei moss that swai ceaselessli in the wind
here dwarf appear from right and left the same whom thei had seen
within the thick of the wall or other like to them some male and
some femal melancholyei littl creatur who bow to nya and look
with fear and wonder at the tall while rachel evid thei were all of
them deaf mute for thei made sign to nya who answer them with other
sign the purport of which seem to sadden and disturb them greatli
thei have seen the fall of my tree in their bowl explain nya to
noie and ask me if it is a true vision i tell them that i am come here
to die and that is why thei ar sad thi is the place of dy of all the
ghostpriest whenc thei pass into the world of spirit and here no
blood mai be shed no not that of the most wick evildo if ani on
of the famili of the priest reach thi place live the glori of the
white death is won follow and see
so thei follow her up the mound past what look like the entranc to a
cave until thei reach a low fenc of reed whereof the gate stood open
the gate is open but enter not there whisper the old mother of the
tree for those who enter there live not long look ladi look
rachel peer through the gate but so dens wa the gloom in that holi
spot that at first she could onli see the enorm red bole of the cedar
and the ghostli mossclad branch which sprang from it at no great
height abov the ground present howev her ey grown accustom to
the light distinguish sever littl whiterob figur seat upon
the earth at some distanc from the trunk stare into vessel of wood
which were place befor them these figur appear to be those of both
men and women while on wa that of a child even as thei watch the
figur nearest to them fell forward over it bowl and lai quit still
whereon those around it set up a feebl pipe cry that yet had in it a
note of glad the dwarfmut who had accompani them and who alon
seem to have a right of entri into thi sad place ran forward and
look then veri gentli thei lift up the fallen figur and bore it out
as it wa carri past them rachel note that it wa the bodi of quit a
young woman whose littl face wast to noth still look sweet and
gentl
wa she ill ask rachel in an aw voic
perhap answer the mother shake her grei head or perhap she wa
veri unhappi and came here to die what doe it matter she is happi
now
ask her noie if all must die who sit beneath that tree said rachel
ay answer nya all save these dumb peopl who have been priest of
the tree from gener to gener to touch it stem is to perish
soon or late for it is the tree of life and death and in it dwell the
spirit of the whole race
what then would happen if it fell down or wa destroi like your tree
mother
then the race would perish also answer nya sinc their spirit would
lack a home and depart to the world of ghost whither thei must follow
when it di of old ag if it should ever die then the race will die
with it
and if someon should cut it down mother what then
now when noie translat these word to her the face of the old queen wa
fill with horror and as her face wa so wa noi face
white maiden she gasp speak not such wicked lest the veri
thought of it should bring the curs upon us all he who destroi that
tree would bring ruin upon thi peopl thei would fly awai everi on of
them far into the heart of the forest and be seen no more by man
moreov he who did thi evil thing would perish and pass down to
vengeanc among the ghost such vengeanc as mai not be spoken put that
thought from thy mind i prai thee and let it never pass thy lip again
do you believ all thi noie ask rachel in english with a smile
ye zoola answer noie shudder for it is true my father told
me of it and of what happen onc to some wild men who broke into the
sanctuari and shot arrow at the tree no no i will not tell the stori
it is dread
yet it must be foolish noie for how can a tree have power over the
live of men
i do not know but it ha it ha if i were but to cast a stone at it i
should be dead in a dai and so would youy even younoth could
save you oh she went on earnestli swear to me sister that you will
never so much as touch that tree i prai you swear
so rachel swore to pleas her for she wa tire of thi tree and it
power
then thei went down the hill again till thei came to the mouth of the
cave
enter ladi nya said for thi must be thy home a while until thou
goest to rule as mother of the tree after me or if it pleas thee
better up yonder to die
thei went into the cave have no choic it wa a great place lit dimli
by the outer light and farther down it length with lamp look round
her rachel saw that it roof wa support by white column which she
knew to be stalactit for as a child she had seen their like at the end
of it where the lamp burn and a fountain bubbl from the ground rose
a veri larg column shape like the trunk of a tree with branch at the
top that look like the bough of a tree gaze at it rachel understood
why these dwarf or some ancient peopl befor them had chosen thi cave
as their templ
the ghost tree of my race said old nya point to it the onli tree
that never fall the tree that live and grow for ever ye it grow
for it is larger now than when my mother wa a child
as thei drew near to thi wondrou and ghostli look object rachel saw
pile around and beyond it mani preciou thing there wa gold in dust
and heap and ring and nugget there were shine stone red and green
and white that she knew were jewel there were tusk of ivori and
carv in ivori there were kaross and fur moulder to decai there
were grotesqu god fetish of wood and stone

to the mother of the tree and the priest of the cave costli thing
which thei valu but we valu them not who prize power and wisdom onli
ye ye costli thing which thei give to the mother of the tree the
fool without a spirit when thei come here to ask her oracl look there

and i show them to eddo and to thi white virgin you cannot understand
but it wa so it wa so eddo gift of vision is small mine is great
none have ever had it as i have it and that is why eddo and the other
have suffer my tree to live so long becaus the light of my wisdom ha
shone about their head and spoken through their tongu and when i am
gone thei will seek and find it not in thee thei might have found it
maiden had thy heart remain empti but now it is full again and what
room is there for wisdom such as oursth wisdom of the ghost not the

while i will tell the peopl that thou art weari and restest and
meanwhil i rule in thy name fare thee well inkosazana till we meet
without the wall and he rose and went accompani by hana and the other
priest
when he had gone a littl wai he turn and point up the hill
scream back to nya
go and look within the fenc old hag there thou wilt see the best of
those that clung to thee seek for peac art thou a coward that thou
lingerest behind them
nai eddo she answer thou art the coward that hast driven them to
death becaus thei ar good and thou art evil when my hour is ripe i
join them not befor nor shalt thou abid here long behind me on short
dai of triumph for thee eddo and then night black night for ever
eddo heard and hi yellow face grew white with rage or fear he stamp
upon the ground he shook hi small fat fist and spat out curs as a
toad spit venom nya did not stai to listen to them but walk up the
cave and sat herself down upon her mat
why doe he hate thee so mother ask rachel
becaus those that ar bad hate those that ar good maiden for mani a
year eddo ha sought to rule through me and to work evil in the world
but i have not suffer it he would abandon our secret ancient faith
and reign a king as dingaan the zulu reign he would send the
slavetrib out to war and conquer the nation and build him a great
hous and have mani wive but i held him fast so that he could do few
of these thing therefor he plot against me but my magic wa greater
than hi and while my tree stood he could not prevail at length it fell
at thy feet as he knew that it wa doom to fall for all these thing
ar foreordain and at onc he would have slain me by the red death
but thou didst protect me and for that bless be thou for ever
and why doe he wish to make me mother in thy place nya

sin and that thy wisdom which he see in thee will make him greater
than ani of the ghostpeopl that ever live yet consent not for
afterward if thou dost thwart him he will find a wai to bring down thy

it mai be so mother but how can i dwell on in thi dismal place
alreadi my heart is broken with it sorrow and soon like those poor
folk i should seek peac within the fenc

so rachel sat herself down also and noie interpret for her told all
her tale up to that point when she saw the bodi of richard born awai for
after thi she rememb noth until she found herself stand upon
the fallen tree in the land of the ghost king it wa a long tale and
befor ever she finish it night fell but throughout it tell the old
dwarfwoman said never a word onli watch rachel face with her kind
soft ey at last it wa done and she said
a sad stori truli there is much evil in the world beyond the countri of
the tree for here at least we shed littl blood now maiden what is

ishmael slew ye and to my father and mother also whom the zulu slew
at the command of ishmael
if thei ar all dead how can that be maiden unless thou seekest them
in death pass within the fenc yonder and let the poison of the tree of
the tribe fall upon thee and soon thou wilt find them
nai mother i mai not for it would be selfmurd and my faith know

then thou must wait till death find thee and that road mai be veri
long
alreadi it is long mother so long that i know not how to travel it who
am alon in the world without a friend save noie here and she began to
weep
not so thou hast anoth friend and she laid her hand upon rachel
heart though it is true that i mai bide with thee but a littl while
after thi thei were all silent for a space until nya look up at rachel
and ask suddenli

rachel breast heav and her ey sparkl with joi as she answer
comfort what is there that could bring so much but how can it be
mother see that the last gulf divid us a gulf which mortal mai not
pass and live

or breath for thou didst save me from the red death at the hand of
eddo ye i will try but not yetfirst thou must eat and rest obei or
i do noth
so rachel at and afterward feel drowsi even slept a while perhap
becaus she wa still weari with her journei and her newfound mind
need repos or perhap becaus some drug had been mingl with her
drink when she awok nya led her to the mouth of the cave there thei
stood awhil studi the star no breath of air stir and the silenc
wa intens onli from time to time the sound of tree fall in the
forest reach their ear sometim it wa quit soft as though a fleec
of wool had been drop to the earth that wa when the tree that di
had grown mile and mile awai from them and sometim the crash wa as
that of sudden thunder that wa when the tree which di had grown near
to them
a sens of the mysteri and wonder of the place and hour sank into rachel
heart the star abov the mighti entomb forest in which the tree
fell unceasingli after their long centuri of life the encircl wall
built perhap by hand that had ceas from their labour hundr of
thousand of year befor those tree began to grow the huge mossclad
cedar upon the mound beneath the shadow of whose branch dai by dai it
worshipp gave up their breath that immemori cedar whereof as thei
believ the life wa the life of the nation the wizen littl
witchwoman at her side with the seal of doom alreadi set upon her brow
and the stare of farewel in her ey the sad spiritu face of noie
who held her hand the love faith noie who in that light seem
half a thing of air the grei littl dwarfmut who squat on their
mat stare at the ground or now and again pass down the hill from the
fenc of death abov bear between them a bodi to it burial all were
mysteri all were wonder
as she look and listen a new strength stir in rachel heart at
first she had felt afraid but now courag flow into her and it seem
to come from the old old woman at her side the mistress of mysteri
the mother of magic in whom wa gather the wisdom of a hundr
gener of thi half human race
look at the star and the night she wa sai in her soft voic for
soon thou shalt be beyond them all and perchanc thou shall never see
them more art thou fear if so speak and we will not try thi
journei in search of on whom we mai not find
no answer rachel but mother whither go we
we go to the land of death come then the moment is at hand it is
hard on midnight see yonder star stand abov the holi tree and she
point to a bright orb that hung almost over the topmost bough of the
cedar it mark thy road and if thou wouldst pass it now is the hour
mother ask noie mai i come with her i also have my dead and where
my sister goe i follow
ay if thou wilt daughter of seyapi the path is wide enough for three
and if i stai on high perchanc thou that art of my blood mayest find
strength to guid her earthward through the wander world
then nya walk up the cave and sat herself down within the circl of the
lamp with her back to the stalactit that wa shape like a tree bid
rachel and noie be seat in front of her two of the dwarfmut
appear women both of them and squat to right and left each gaze
into a bowl of limpid dew nya made a sign and still gaze into their
bowl these dwarf began to beat upon littl drum that gave out a
curiou roll nois while nya sang to the sound of the drum a wild
low song with her thin littl hand she grasp the right hand of rachel
and of noie and gaze into their ey
thing chang to rachel the dwarf to right and left vanish awai but
the low murmur of their drum grew to a mighti music and the star
danc to it the song of nya swell and swell till it fill all the
space between earth and heaven it wa the rush of the gale among the
forest it wa the beat of the sea upon an illimit coast it wa
the shout of all the armi of the world it wa the weep of all the
women of the world it lessen again she seem to be pass awai from
it she heard it far beneath her it grew tini in it volumetini as if
it were an infinit speck or point of sound which she could still discern
for million and million of mile till at length distanc and vast
overcam it and it ceas it ceas thi song of the earth but a new
song began the song of the rush world far awai she could hear it
that ineff music far in the utter depth of space nearer it would
come and nearer a ring gloriou sound a sound and yet a voic on
mighti voic that sang and wa answer by other voic as sun cross the
path of sun and caught up and reecho by the innumer choir of the
constel
thei were fall past her those vast glow sun those round
planet that were now vivid with light and now steep in gloom those
infinit shower of distant star thei were gone thei and their music
togeth she wa far beyond them in a region where all life wa
forgotten beyond the rush of the uttermost comet beyond the last glimmer
of the spi and outpost of the univers on shape of light she sped
into the black bosom of fathomless space and it solitud shrivel up
her soul she could not endur she long for some shore on which to set
her mortal feet
behold far awai a shore appear a tower cliffbound shore upon
whose iron coast all the black wave of space beat vainli and were
etern roll back here there wa light but no such light as she had
ever known it did not fall from sun or star but chang and radiant
well upward from that land in a thousand hue as light might well from
a world of opal in it dazzl beauti rai she saw fantast palac
and pyramid she saw sea and pure white mountain she saw plain and
newhu flower she saw gulf and precipic and pale lake pregnant
with waver flame all that she had ever conceiv of as love or as
fear she beheld far loveli or a thousandfold more fear
like a great rose of glori that world bloom and chang beneath her
petal by petal it splendour fell awai and were swallow in the sea of
space whilst from the deep heart of the immort rose new splendour took

were thei creat into the black bosom of nothing were thei gather
whilst other ever more perfect press into their place so too
chang the mountain and so the tree while the gulf becam a garden
and the fieri lake a pleasant stream and from the seed of the strang
flower grew immemori forest wreath about with rosi mist and
bedeck in glimmer dew with music thei were born on the wing of
music thei fled awai and after them that sweet music wail like
memori
a hand took her and drew her downward and up to meet her leapt myriad
of point of light in everi point a tini face thei gaze at her with
their golden ey thei whisper togeth concern her and the sound
of their whisper wa the sound of a sea at peac thei accompani her
to the veri heart of the opal rose of life whenc all these wonder
well thei set her in a great grei hall roof in with lean cliff
and there thei left her desol
fear came upon her the loneli choke her it held her by the throat
like a thing aliv she seem about to die of it when she becam awar
that onc more she wa companion shape stood about her she could not
see the shape save dimli now and again as thei move but their ey she
could see their great calm piti ey which look down on her as
the ey of a giant might look down upon a babe thei were terribl but
she did not fear them so much as the loneli for at least thei live
on of the shape bent over her for it holi ey drew near to her and
she heard a voic in her heart ask her for what great caus she had
dare to journei hither befor the time she answer in her heart not
with her lip that she wa bereav of all she love and came to seek
them then still in her heart she heard that voic command
let all thi rachel dead be brought befor her
instantli door swung open at the end of that grei hall and through them
with noiseless step with shadowi wing float a be that bore in it
arm a child befor her it stai and the light of it starri head

smile like the rest and wa born awai to be follow by that
witchdoctoress whom the zulu had slain becaus of her who neither

dead therefor he must be here shadow thou mockest me
i mock not came the swift answer mortal look now and learn
again the door burst open and through them pour the infinit rout of
the dead that hall would not hold them all therefor it grew and grew
till her sight could scarc reach from wall to wall shape head and
marshal them by race and by gener perhap becaus thu onli
could her human heart imagin them but now none were born in their arm
thei came in myriad and in million in billion and ten of billion
men and women and children king and priest and beggar all wear the
garment of their ag and countri thei came like an oceantid and their
float hair wa the foam on the tide and their ey gleam like the
first shimmer of dawn abov the snow thei came for hour and dai and

like to dingaanand threaten her with a littl redhandl spear
ask her how she dare to sit upon the throne of the spirit of hi
nation she began to tell him her stori but as she spoke the wide
reced wall of that grei hall fell apart and crumbl and amidst a
mighti laughter the greatei shape rebuilt them to the fashion of the
cave in the mound beneath the tree of the dwarffolk the sound of the
trumpet di awai the shrill sweet music of the sphere grew far and
faint
rachel open her ey there in front of her sat nya croon her low
song and there on either side crouch the mute tap upon their
littl drum and gaze into their bowl of water while against her
lean noie who stir like on awak from sleep ag and ag ago
when she start on that dread journei the dwarf to her left wa
stretch out her hand to steadi the bowl at her feet and now it had but
just reach the bowl a great moth had sing it wing in the lamp and
wa flutter to the groundit wa still in midair noie wa place
her arm about her neck and it had but begun to fall upon her shoulder
chapter xxii
in the sanctuari
nya ceas her sing and the dwarf women their beat on the drum
hast thou been a journei maiden she ask look at rachel
curious
ay mother she answer in a faint voic and a journei far and
strang
and thou noie my niec
ay mother she answer shiver as though with cold or fear but i
went not with my sister here i went alonefor year and year
a far journei thou sayest inkosazana and on that wa for year and
year thou sayest noie yet the ey of both of you have been shut for
so long onli as it take a burnt moth to fall from the lamp flame to the
ground i think that you slept and dream a moment that is all
mayhap mother repli rachel but if so mine wa a most wondrou
dream such as ha never visit me befor and as i prai never mai
again for i wa born beyond the star into the gloriou citi of the
dead and i saw all the dead and those that i had known in life were
brought to me by shape and power whereof i could onli see the ey
and didst thou find him whom thou soughtest most of all
nai she answer him alon i did not find i sought him i prai the
guardian of the dead to show him to me and thei call up all the dead
and i scan them everi on and thei summon him by hi name but he
wa not of their number and he came not onli thei spoke in my heart
bid me to look for him in some other world
ah exclaim nya start a littl thei said that to thee did thei
well world ar mani and such a search would be long then as though to
turn the subject she ad and what sawest thou noie
i mother i went not beyond the star i climb down endless ladder
into the centr of the earth my feet ar still sore with them i reach
vast cave full of a black that shone and there mani dead folk were
walk go nowher and come back from nowher thei seem
strengthless but not unhappi and thei look at me and ask me tide
of the upper world but i could not answer them for whenev i open my
lip to speak a cold hand wa laid upon my mouth i wander among them
for mani moon onli there wa no moon noth but the black that
shone like polish coal wander from cave to cave at length i came to
a cave in which sat my father seyapi and near to him my mother and my
other mother hi wive and my brother and sister all of whom the
zulu kill as the wild beast ibubesi told them to do
i saw ibubesi and he prai me for my pardon and i grant it to him
broke in rachel
i did not see him went on noie fierc nor would i have pardon him
if i had nor do i think that my father and hi famili pardon him i think
that thei wait to bear testimoni against him befor the lord of the dead
did seyapi tell you so ask rachel
nai he sat there beneath a black tree whereof i could not see the top
and gaze into a bowl of black water and in that bowl he show me mani
pictur of thing that have been and thing that ar to come but thei
ar secret i mai sai noth of them
and what wa the end of it my niec ask nya bend forward
eagerli
mother the end of it wa that the black tree which wa shape like the
tree of our tribe abov us took fire and went up in a fierc flame then
the roof of the cave fell in and all the peopl of the dwarf flew
through the roof sing and rejoic into a place of light onli
she ad slowli it seem to me that i wa left alon amidst the ruin
of the cave i and the white ghost of the tree then a voic cri to me
to make my heart bold to bear all thing with patienc sinc to those
who dare much for love sake much will be forgiven so i woke but what
those word mean i cannot guess see that i love no man and never
shall and she rest her chin upon her hand and sat there muse
no repli nya thou lovest no man and therefor the riddl is hard
but as she spoke her ey fell upon rachel
mother said rachel present my heart is the hungrier for all that it
ha fed upon can thy magic send me back to that countri of the dead that
i mai search for him again if so for hi sake i will dare the journei
not so answer nya shake her head it is a road that veri few have
travel and none mai travel twice and live
now rachel began to weep
weep not maiden there ar other road and perchanc tomorrow thou
shall walk them now lie down and sleep both of you and fear no dream
so thei laid themselv down and slept but the old witchwif nya sat
wait and watch them
i think i understand she murmur to herself as she gaze at the
slumber rachel for to her who is so pure and good and who ha
suffer such cruel wrong the guardian would not lie i think that i
understand and that i can find a path sleep on sweet maiden sleep on in
hope
then she look at noie and shook her grei head
i do not understand she mutter the black tree shape like the tree
of our tribe and seyapi of the old blood seat beneath it the tree that
went up in fire and the maid of the old blood left alon with the ghost
of it while the dwarf peopl fled into light and freedom what doe it
mean ah that pictur in the bowl now i can guess those who dare much
for love it did not sai for love of man and woman can love woman but
would she dare a deed that none of our race could even dream well the
zulu blood is bold perhap perhap oh eddo thou black sorcer
whither art thou lead the children of the tree on thy head be it
eddo not on mine on thy head for ever and for ever
when rachel awok refresh on the follow dai she lai a while
think everi detail of her vision wa perfectli clear in her mind onli
now she wa sure that it had been but a dream yet what a wonder dream
how even in her sleep had she found the imagin to conceiv
circumst so inconceiv that magic rush beyond the star that
mighti world set round with black cliff against which roll the wave of
space that chang wondrou world which unfold itself petal by petal
like a rose everi petal loveli and differ from the last that grei
hall roof with tilt precipic and then those dead those multitud
of the dead
what power had been born in her that she could imagin such thing as
these vision she had like her mother but not after thi sort perhap
it wa but an aftermath of her mad for into the mind of the mad
creep strang sight and sound and thi place and the peopl amongst
whom she sojourn the ghostpeopl the grei dwarfpeopl the dealer
in dream the dweller in the sombr forest might well open new door in
such a soul as her or perhap she wa still mad she did not know she
did not greatli care all she knew wa that her poor heart ach with love
for a man who wa dead and yet whom she could not find even among the
dead she had wish to die but now she long for death no more fear
lest after all there should be someth in that vision which the magic of
nya had summon up and that when she reach the further shore she might
not find him who dwelt in a differ world oh if onli she could find
him then she would be glad enough to go wherev it wa that he had gone
now noie wa awak at her side and thei talk togeth
we must have dreamt dream noie she said perhap the mother mingl
some drug with our food
i do not know zoola answer noie but if so i want no more of
those dream which bode no good to me besid who can tell what is dream
and what is truth mayhap thi world is the dream and the truth is such
thing as we saw last night and she would sai no more on the matter
noth happen within the wall that daythat is noth out of the
common a certain number of the privileg priestli cast of the dwarf
were carri or conduct into the holi place and up to the fenc of
death that thei might die there and a certain number were brought out for
burial some of those who came in were folk weari of life or in other
word suicid and these walk and some were sick of variou diseas
and these were carri but the end wa the same thei alwai di though
whether thi result wa realli brought about by some poison distil from
the tree as nya alleg or whether it wa the effect of a physic
collaps induc by that inherit belief rachel never discov
at least thei di some almost at onc and some within a dai or two of
enter that deadli shade and were born awai to burial by the mute who
spent their spare time in the dig of littl grave which thei must
fill inde these mute either knew or pretend that thei knew who
would be the occup of each grave at least thei intim by sign that
thi wa reveal to them in their bowl and when the victim appear
within the wall took pleasur in lead them to the hole thei had
prepar and show to them with what care these had been dug to suit
their statur for thi servic thei receiv a fee that such moribund
person brought with them either of fine woven robe or of mat or of
differ sort of food or sometim of gold and copper ring
manufactur by the umkulu or other subject savag which thei wore upon
their wrist and ankl
certain of these doom folk howev went to their fate with no light
heart which wa not wonder as it seem that these were neither ill
nor sought a voluntari euthanasia thei were polit victim sent
thither by eddo as an altern to the terror of the red death wherebi
accord to their strang and ancient creed thei would have risk the
spill of their soul for the most part the crime of these poor peopl
wa that thei had been adher and support of the old mother of the
tree nya over whom eddo wa at last triumphant on their wai up to the
fenc such individu would stop to exchang a last few sad word with
their dethron priestess
then without ani resist thei went on with the rest but from them the
mute receiv scant offer or none at all with the result that thei
were cast into the worst situat and most inconveni grave or even
tumbl two or three togeth into some shapeless corner hole but after
all that matter noth to them so long as thei receiv sepulchr
within the wall which wa their birthor rather their deathright
the priestmut themselv were a strang folk and oddli enough rachel
observ by comparison quit cheer in their demeanour for when off
duti thei would smile and gibber at each other like monkei and carri on
a kind of market between themselv thei live in that part of the
circumfer of the wall which wa behind the hill whereon grew the
sacr tree here no burial took place and instead of grave appear
their tini hut arrang in neat street and squar in these thei and
their forefath had dwelt from time immemori inde each littl hut
with a few yard of fencedin ground about it ornament with dwarf tree
wa a freehold that descend from father to son for the mute marri
and were given in marriag like other folk though their children were
few a famili of three be consid veri larg while mani of the
coupl had none at all but those who were born to them were all
deafmut although their other sens seem to be singularli acut
these mute had their virtu thu some of them were veri kind to each
other and especi to those from the outer forest world who came hither
to bid farewel to that world and other renounc marriag and all
earthli joi devot their live which appear to be long to the
worship of the spirit of the tree also thei had their vice such as
theft and the seduc awai of the betroth of other but the chief of
them wa jealousi which sometim led to murder by poison an art
whereof thei were great master
when such a crime wa discov and a case of it happen dure the
first dai of rachel sojourn among them the accus wa put upon hi
trial befor the chief of the mute evid for and against him be
given by sign which thei all understood then if a case were establish
against him he wa forc to drink a bowl of medicin if he did thi
with impun he wa acquit but if it disagre with him hi guilt wa
held to be establish now came the strang part of the matter all hi
life the evildo had been accustom to go within the fenc about hi
busi and take no harm but after such condemn he wa conduct
there with the usual ceremoni and veri shortli perish like ani other
uniniti person whether thi issu wa due to magic or to mental
collaps or to the previou administr of poison no on seem to
know not even nya herself so at least she declar to rachel
at each new moon these mute celebr what rachel wa inform thei
look upon as a festiv that is thei climb the tree of the tribe and
scatter themselv among it enorm branch where for sever hour
thei mumbl and gibber in the dark like a troop of baboon then thei
came down and mount the huge surround wall crept around it
circumfer occasion thi journei result in an accid as on
of them would fall from the wall and be dash to piec although it wa
notic that the unfortun wa gener a person who although guilti
of no actual crime chanc to be out of favour with the other priest and
priestess after the circuit of the wall had been accomplish with or
without accid the dwarf feast round a fire drink some spirit
that threw them into a sleep in which wonder vision appear to them
such wa their onli entertain if so it could be call sinc
doubtless the ceremoni wa of a religi charact for the rest thei
seldom if ever left the holi place which wa known as within the wall
most of them never do so in the cours of a long life
beyond the burial of the dead thei did no work as their food wa brought
to them daili by outsid peopl who were call the slave of the wall
their onli method of convers wa by sign and thei seem to desir
no other inde if as occasion happen a child wa born to ani of
them who could hear or speak like other human be it wa either given
over to the other dwarf or if the discoveri wa not made until it wa
old enough to observ it wa sacrif by be bound to the trunk of
the tribal tree lest it should tell the secret of the tree
such were the weird halfhuman folk among whom rachel wa destin to
dwell the zulu had been bad and bloodthirsti but compar to these
littl wizard thei seem to her as angel the zulu at ani rate had
left her her thought but these stunt wretch she wa sure pri
into them and read them with the help of their bowl for often she caught
sight of them sign to each other about her as she pass and point
with grin to pictur which thei saw in the water
it wa night again still silent night made odor with the heavi cedar
scent of the huge tree upon the mound rachel and noie sat befor nya in
the cave beneath the burn lamp about which flutter the bigwing
gild moth
thou didst not find him yonder among the shade said nya suddenli as
though she were continu a convers sai now maiden art thou
satisfi or wouldst thou seek for him again
i would seek him through all the heaven and all the earth mother my
soul burn for a sight of him and if i cannot find him then i must die
and go perchanc where he is not
good said nya the effort weari me for i grow weak yet for thy
sake i will try to help thee who save me from the red death
then the dwarfwomen came in and beat upon their drum and as befor
the old mother of the tree began to sing but noie sat asid for in thi
night plai she would take no part again rachel sank into sleep and
again it seem to her that she wa swept from the earth into the region
of the star and there search world after world
she saw mani strang and marvel thing thing so wonder that her
memori wa buri beneath the mass of them so that when she woke again
she could not recal their detail onli of richard she saw noth yet
as her life return to her it seem to rachel that for on brief moment
she wa near to richard she could not see him and she could not hear
him yet certainli he wa near her then her ey open and nya ceas
from her song ask
what tide wander
littl she answer feebli for she wa veri tire and in a faint
voic she told her all
good said nya nod her grei head thi time he wa not so far
awai tomorrow i will make thy spirit strong and then perhap he will
come to thee now rest
so next night nya laid her charm upon rachel as befor and again her
spirit sought for richard thi time it seem to her that she did not
leav the earth but with infinit pain with terribl struggl
wander to and fro about it bewild by a multitud of face led
astrai by myriad of footstep yet in the end she found him she heard
him not she saw him not she knew not where he wa but undoubtedli for a
while she wa with him and awok again exhaust but veri happi
nya heard her stori weigh everi word of it but sai noth then
she sign to the dwarf to bring her a bowl of dew and stare in it for
a long while the dwarfwomen also stare into their bowl and afterward
came to her talk to her on their finger after which all three of
them upset the dew upon a rock break the pictur
hast thou seen aught ask rachel eagerli
ye maiden answer the mother i and these wise women have seen
someth the same thing and therefor a true thing but ask not what it
wa for we mai not tell thee nor would it help thee if we did onli be
of a good courag for thi i sai there is hope for thee
so rachel went to sleep ponder on these word of which neither she
nor noie could guess the mean the next night when she prai nya to
lai the spell upon her the old mother would not
not so she said thrice have i rent thy soul from thy bodi and sent it
afar and thi i mai do no more and keep thee live nor could i if i
would for i grow feebl neither is it necessari see that although
thou knowest it not that spirit of thine have found him is with him
wherev he mai be ye at hi side comfort him
ay but where is he mother let me look in the bowl and see hi face
as i believ that thou hast done
look if thou wilt and she motion to on of the dwarfwomen to place a
bowl befor her
so rachel look long and earnestli but saw noth of richard onli mani
fantast pictur most of which she knew again for scene from her own
past at length worn out she thrust awai the bowl and ask in a bitter
voic why thei mock her and how it came about that she who had seen the
come of richard in the pool in zululand and the fate of dingaan the
king in the bowl of eddo could now see noth of ani worth
as regard the vision of the pool i cannot sai maiden repli nya
for that wa born of thine own heart and had noth to do with our
magic as regard the vision in the bowl of eddo thei were hi vision
not thine or rather my vision that i saw befor he start henc i
pass them on to him and he pass them on to thee and thou didst pass
them on to king dingaan farsight and puresoul as thou art yet not
have been instruct in their wizardri thou wilt see noth in the
bowl of the dwarf unless their blood is mingl with thy blood
their blood mingl with my blood what dost thou mean mother
what i sai neither more nor less if eddo ha hi will thou wilt rule
after me here as mother of the tree but first thy vein must be open
and the vein of eddo must be open and eddo blood must be pour into
thee and thy blood into him then thou wilt be abl to read in the bowl
as we can and eddo will be thy master and thou must do hi bid while
you both shall live
if so answer rachel i think that neither of us will live long
that night rachel felt too exhaust to sleep though why thi should be
she could not guess as she had done noth all dai save watch the mute
at their dreari task and it wa strang therefor that she should feel
as though she had made a long journei upon her feet about an hour befor
the dawn she saw nya rise and glide past her toward the mouth of the
cave carri in her hand a littl drum like those us by the mute
women someth impel her to follow and wake noie at her side she
bade her come also
outsid of the cave by the faint starlight thei saw the littl shape of
nya creep down the mound and thenc across the open space toward the
wall and went after her think that she intend to pass the wall but
thi she did not do for when she came to it foot nya notwithstand
her feebl began to climb the rough stone as activ as ani cat
and though their ascent seem peril enough reach the crest of the
wall sixti feet abov in safeti and there sat herself down next thei
heard her beat upon the drum she bore singl stroke alwai but some
of them slow and some rapid with a paus between everi five or ten
stroke as though she were spell out word thought rachel
after a while nya ceas her beat and in the utter silenc of the
night which wa broken onli as alwai by the occasion crash of
fall tree for no breath of air stir and all the beast of prei
had sought their lair befor light came both she and noie seem to
hear far infinit far awai the faint beat of an answer drum it
would appear that nya heard it also for she struck a singl note upon
her as though in acknowledg after which the distant beat went
on paus as though for a repli from some other unheard drum and again
from time to time went on perhap repeat that repli
for a long while thi continu until the sky began to grow grei inde
when nya beat for sever minut and wa answer by a singl faroff
note then glanc at the heaven she prepar to descend the wall while
rachel and noie slip back to the cave and feign to be asleep soon
she enter and stood over them shake her grei head and ask how it
came about that thei thought that she the mother of the tree should be
so easili deceiv
so thou sawest us said rachel try not to look asham
no i saw you not with my ey either of you but i felt both of you
follow me and heard in my heart what you were whisper to each
other well inkosazana art thou the wiser for thi journei
no mother but tell us if thou wilt what thou wast beat on that
drum
gladli she answer i wa send certain order to the slave peopl
who still know me as mother of the tree and obei my word perhap thou
dost not believ that while i sat upon yonder wall i talk across the
desert to the chief of the march upon the far border of the land of the
umkulu and that by now at my bid thei have sent out men upon an
errand of mine
what wa the errand mother ask rachel curious
i said the errand wa mine not thine maiden it is not press but as
i do not know how long my strength will last i thought it well that it
should be settl then without more word she coil herself up on her
mat and seem to go to sleep
it wa after thi incid of the drum that rachel experienc the
strangest dai or rather week of her life nya sent her into no more
tranc and to all outward seem noth happen yet within her much
did happen her mad had utterli left her and still she wa not as
other women ar or as she herself had been in health her mind seem to
wander and she knew not whither it wander yet for long hour although
she wa awak and so noie said talk or eat or walk as usual it
wa awai from her and afterward she could rememb noth also thi
happen at night as well as dure the dai and ever more and more often
she could rememb noth yet out of thi nothing there grew upon
her a continu sens of the presenc of richard darrien a presenc that
seem to come nearer and nearer closer and closer to her heart it wa
the assur of thi presenc that made those long dai so happi to her
though when she wa herself she felt that it could be naught but a dream
yet why should a dream move her so strang and why should a dream weari
her so much why after sleep all night should she awak feel as
though she had journei all night why should her limb ach and she grow
thin like on who travel without ceas why should she seem time after
time to have pass great danger to have known cold and heat and want
and struggl against water and the battl against storm why should
her knowledg of thi richard of the veri heart and soul of richard grow
ever deeper till it wa as though thei were not twain but on
she could not answer these question and noie could not answer them and
when she ask nya the old mother shook her head and could not or would
not answer onli the dwarfmut seem to know the answer for when she
pass them thei nudg each other and grin and thrust their littl
woolli head togeth stare sever of them into on bowl but if noie
and nya knew noth of the caus of these thing the effect of them
stir them both for thei saw that rachel the tall and strong grew
faint and weak and began to fade awai as on fade upon whom deadli
sick ha laid it hand
thu three week or so went by until on dai in some fashion of her own
nya caus to aris an the mind of eddo a knowledg of her desir to speak

chapter xxiii
the dream in the north
richard darrien rememb drink a bowl of milk in the hut in which he
wa imprison at mafooti and instantli feel a cold chill run to hi
heart and brain after which he rememb no more for mani a dai at
length howev by slow degre and with sundri slip back into
unconsci life and some share of hi reason and memori return to
him he awok to find himself ly in a hut roughli fashion of
branch and attend by a kaffir woman of middl ag
who ar you he ask
i am name mami she answer
mami mami i know the name and i know the voic sai were you on of
the wive of ibubesi she who spoke with me through the fenc and he
strove to rais himself on hi arm to look at her but fell back from
weak
ye inkoo i wa on of hi wive
wa then where is ibubesi now
dead inkoo the fire ha burn him up with hi kraal mafooti
with the kraal mafooti where then is the inkosazana answer woman
and be swift he cri in a hollow voic
ala inkoo ala she is dead also for she wa in the kraal when the
fire swept it and wa seen stand on the top of a hut where she had
taken refug and after that she wa seen no more
then let me die and go to her exclaim richard with a groan as he
fell back upon hi bed where he lai almost insens for three more
dai
yet he did not die for he wa young and veri strong and mami pour milk
down hi throat to keep the life in him inde littl by littl someth
of hi strength came back so that at last he wa abl to think and talk
with her again and learn all the dread stori
he learn how the peopl of mafooti fear the vengeanc of dingaan
had fled awai from their kraal carri what thei thought to be hi bodi
with them lest it should remain in evid against them and take all
the cattl that thei could gather everi on of them had fled that could
travel onli ibubesi and a few sick and certain folk who chanc to be
outsid the wall remain behind it wa from two of these who escap
dure the burn of the kraal by the zulu or by fire from the heaven
thei knew not which that thei had heard of the aw end of ibubesi and
of hi prison the inkosazana as for themselv thei had travel
night and dai till thei reach a certain secret and almost inaccess
place in the great quathlamba mountain in which peopl had live whom
chaka wipe out and there hidden themselv in thi place thei remain
hope that dingaan would not care to follow them so far and purpos to
make it their home sinc here thei found good meali land and
fortun the most of their cattl remain aliv that wa all the
stori there wa noth more to tell
a dai or two later richard wa abl to creep out of the hut and see the
place it wa as mami had said veri strong a kind of tableland ring
round with precipic that could onli be climb through a singl narrow
nek and overshadow by the great quathlamba rang the peopl who were
engag in plant their corn gather round him stare at him as
though he were on risen from the dead and greet him with respect
word he spoke to sever of them includ the two men who had seen the
burn of mafooti though from a littl distanc but thei could tell him
no more than mami had done except that thei were sure that the inkosazana
had perish in the flame as had mani of the zulu who broke into the
town richard wa sure of it alsowho would not have beenand crept
back brokenheart to hi hut he who had lost all and long that he
might die
but he did not die he grew strong again and when he wa well and fit to
travel went to the headmen of the peopl sai that now he desir to
leav them and return to hi own place in the cape coloni the headmen
said no he must not leav for in their heart thei were sure that he
would go not to the cape coloni but to zululand there to discov all
he could as to the death of the inkosazana so thei told him that with
them he must bide for then if the zulu track them out thei would be
abl to produc him who otherwis would be put to the spear everi man of
them as hi murder the sin of ibubesi who had been their chief clung
to them and thei knew well what dingaan and tamboosa had sworn should
happen to those who harm the white chief dario who wa under the
mantl of their inkosazana
richard reason with them but it wa of no us thei would not let him
go therefor in the end he appear to fall in with their humour and
meanwhil began to plan escap on dark night he tri it inde onli to
be seiz in the mouth of the nek and brought back to hi hut next
morn the headman spoke with him tell him that he should onli depart
thenc over their dead bodi and that thei watch him night and dai
that the nek moreov wa alwai guard then thei made an offer to
him he wa a white man thei said and clever than thei were let them
come under hi wing let him be their chief for he would know how to
protect them from the zulu and ani other enemi he could take over the
wive of ibubesi at thi proposit richard shudder and thei would
obei him in all thing onli he must not attempt to leav themwhich he
should never do aliv
richard put the propos by but in the end not becaus he wish it
but by the mere weight of hi white man blood and for the lack of
anyth els to do drift into some such posit onli at the wive of
ibubesi or ani other wive he would not so much as look a slight that
gave offenc to those women but made the other laugh
so for certain long week he sat in that secret nook in the mountain as
the chief of a littl kaffir tribe occupi himself with the plant of
crop the build of wall and hut the drill of men and the
settl of quarrel all dai he work thu but after the dai came the
night when he did not work and those night he dread for then the
languor not of bodi but of mind which the poison the old
witchdoctoress had given to ishmael had left behind it would overcom
him bring with it black despair and hi grief would get a hold of
him tortur hi heart for of the memori of rachel he could never be
rid for a singl hour and hi love for her grew deeper dai by dai and
she wa dead oh she wa dead leav him live
on night he dream of rachel dream that she wa search for him and
call him it wa a veri vivid dream but he woke up and it pass awai
as such dream do onli all the dai that follow he felt a strang
throb in hi head and found himself turn ever toward the north
the next night he dream again of her and heard her sai the search ha
been far and long but i have found you richard open your ey now and
you will see my face so he open hi ey and there sure enough in
the dark he perceiv the outlin of her sweet rememb face about
which fell her golden hair for on moment onli he perceiv it then it
wa gone and after that her presenc never seem to leav him he could
not see her he could not touch her and yet she wa ever at hi side hi
brain ach with the thought of her her breath seem to fan hi hand
and hair at night her face float befor him and in hi dream her
voic call him sai come to me come to me richard i am in need
of you come to me i myself will be your guid
then he would wake and rememb that she wa dead grew sure and ever
surer that the spirit of rachel wa call him down to death it call
him from the north alwai from the north soon he could scarc walk
southward or east or west for er he had gone mani yard hi feet
turn and set hi face toward the north that wa to the narrow nek
between the precipic which the kaffir guard night and dai
on even he went to hi hut to sleep if sleep would come to him it
came and with it that face and voic but the face seem paler and the
voic more insist
will you not listen to me it said you who were my love for how long
must i plead with you soon my power will leav me the opportun will
be pass and then how will you find me richard my lover rise up rise
up and follow er it be too late for i myself will be your guid
he awok he could bear it no more perhap he wa mad and these were
vision of hi mad mock vision that led him to hi death well
if so he still would follow them perhap her bodi wa buri in the
north if so he would be buri there also perhap her soul dwelt in the
north if so hi soul would fly thither to join it the kaffir would
kill him in the pass well if so he would die with hi face set
northward whither rachel drew him
he rose up and wrap himself in a cloak of goatskin he fill a hide
bag with sundri flesh and parch corn and hung it about hi shoulder
with a gourd of water for after all he might live a littl while and need
food and drink as he had no gun he took a staff and a knife and a
broadblad spear and leav the hut set hi face northward and walk
toward the mouth of the nek at the first step which he took the torment
in hi head seem to leav him who fought no longer who had seem
obedi to that mysteri summon quiet and confid possess
him he wa go to hi end but what did it matter the dream beckon
and he must follow the moon shone bright but he took no troubl to hide
himself it did not seem to be worth while
now he wa in the nek and draw near to the place where the guard wa
station still he march on boldli openli as he thought thei were
on the alert thei drew out from behind the rock and bar hi path
whither goest thou lord dario ask their captain thou knowest that
here thou mayest not pass
i follow a ghost to the north he answer and live or dead i
pass
ow said the captain he sai that he follow a ghost well we have
noth to do with ghost take him unharm if possibl but take him
so urg thereto by their own fear sinc for their safeti sake thei
dare not let him go the men sprang toward him thei sprang toward him
where he stood wait the end for give back he would not and of a
sudden fell down upon their face hide their head among the stone
richard did not know what had happen to them that thei behav thu
strang nor did he care onli see them fallen he walk on over
them and pursu hi wai along the nek and down it to the plain beyond
all that night he walk look behind him from time to time to see if
ani follow but none came he wa alon quit alon save for the dream
that led him toward the north at sunris he rest and slept a while
then awak after middai went on hi road he did not know the road
yet never wa he in doubt for a moment it wa alwai clear to him whither
he should go that night he finish hi food and again slept a while
go forward at the dawn in the morn he met some kaffir who
question him but he answer onli that he wa follow a dream to the
north thei stare at him seem to grow frighten and ran awai but
present some of them came back and place food in hi path which he
took and left them
he came to the kraal mafooti it wa utterli desert and he wander
amidst it ash here and there he found the bone of those who had
perish in the fire and turn them over with hi staff wonder
whether ani of them had belong to rachel in that place he slept a night
think that perhap hi journei wa end and that here he would die
where he believ rachel had di but when he wake at the dawn it wa
to find that someth within him still drew him toward the north more
strongli inde than ever befor
so he left what had been the town mafooti walk along the edg of the
cleft into which ishmael had leapt on fire he climb the wall built
with so much toil to keep out the zulu and at last came to the river
which rachel had swum it wa low now and wade it he enter zululand
here the nativ seem to know of hi approach for thei gather in
number watch him and put food in hi path but thei would not speak
to him and when he address them sai that he follow a dream and
ask if thei had seen the dream thei cri out that he wa tagali
bewitch and fled awai
he continu hi journei find each night a hut prepar for him to
sleep in and food for him to eat till at length on even he reach
the great place umgugundhlovu through it street he march with a set
face while thousand stare at him in silenc then a captain point out
a hut to him and into it he enter at and slept at dawn he rose for
he knew that here he must not tarri the spirit face of rachel still hung
befor him the spirit voic still whisperedforward forward to the
north i myself will be your guid in hi path sat the king and hi
councillor and around them a regiment of men he walk through them
unheed till at length when he wa in front of the king thei bar
hi road and he halt
who art thou and what is thy busi ask an old councillor with a
wither hand
i am richard darrien he answer and here i have no busi i
journei to the north stai me not
we know thee said the councillor thou art the lord dario that didst
dwell in the shadow of the inkosazana thou art the white chief whom the
wild beast ibubesi slew at the kraal mafooti why doe thy ghost come
hither to troubl us
live or dead ghost or man i travel to the north stai me not he
answer
what seekest thou in the north thou lord dario
i seek a dream a spirit lead me to find a dream seest thou it not man
with the wither hand
ah thei repeat he seek a dream a spirit lead him to find a dream
in the north
what is thi dream like ask mopo of the wither hand
come stand at my side and look there dost thou see it float in the
air befor us thou who hast ey that can read a dream
mopo came and look then hi knee trembl a littl and he said
ay lord dario i see and i know that face
thou knowest the face old fool broke in dingaan angrili then whose
is it
o king answer mopo drop hi ey it is not law to speak the
name but the face is the face of on who sat where that wander stand
and show thee certain pictur in a bowl of water
now dingaan trembl for the memori of those vision haunt him night
and dai moreov he thought at time that thei drew near to their
fulfil
the white man is mad he said and thou mopo art mad also i have
often thought it and that it would be well if thou wentest on a long
journeyfor thy health thi dario shall stai here a while i will not
suffer him to wander through my land craze the peopl with hi tale of
dream and vision take him and hold him the circl of the doctor shall
inquir into the matter
so dingaan spoke who in hi heart wa afraid lest thi wildei dario
should learn that he had given the inkosazana to the dwarf folk when she
wa mad to appeas them after thei had prophesi evil to him also he
rememb that it wa becaus of the murder done by ibubesi that the
inkosazana had gone mad and did not understand if dario had been kill
at the kraal mafooti how it could be that he now stood befor him
therefor he thought that he would keep him a prison until he found out
all the truth of the matter and whether he were still a man or a ghost or
a wizard cloth in the shape of the dead
at the bid of the king guard sprang forward to seiz richard but
the old councillor mopo shrunk awai behind him hide hi ey with hi
wither hand thei sprang forward and yet thei laid no finger on him
but fell oft to right and left sai
kill us if thou wilt black on we cannot
the wizard ha bewitch them said dingaan angrili here you doctor

him
unwillingli enough the doctor of whom there were eight or ten sit
apart rose to do the king bid thei came on toward richard some
of them sing song and some mutter charm and as thei came he
laugh and said
bewar you abangoma the dream is look at you veri angrili then
thei too broke awai to right and left cry out that thi wa a wizard
against whom thei had no power
now dingaan grew mad with wrath and shout to hi soldier to seiz the
white man and if he resist them to kill him with their stick for of
witchcraft thei had known enough in zululand of late
so thick as bee the regiment form up in front of him shout and
wave their kerri for here in the king place thei bore no spear

north
the soldier did not stir onli a captain step out bid him give up
hi spear and yield himself or be kill richard walk forward and at a
sign from the captain men sprang at him lift their kerri to dash
out hi brain then suddenli in front of richard there appear someth
faint and white someth that walk befor him the soldier saw it
and the kerri fell from their hand the regiment behind saw it and
turn burst awai like a scare herd of cattl thei did not wait to
seek the gate thei burst through the fenc of the enclosur and were
gone leav it flat behind them the king and hi councillor saw it
also and more clearli than the rest
the inkosazana thei cri it is the inkosazana who walk befor him
that she love and thei fell upon their face onli dingaan remain
seat on hi stool
go he said hoars to richard go thou wizard north or south or
east or west if onli thou wilt take that spirit with thee for she bode
evil to my land
so richard who had seen noth march awai from the kraal
umgugundhlovu and onc more set hi face toward the north the north
that drew him as it draw the needl of a compass
the road that rachel and the dwarf had travel he travel also
although from dai to dai he knew not where hi feet would lead him still
he travel it step by step nor did ani hurt come to him in the countri
where men dwelt be forewarn of hi come by messeng thei
brought him food and guard him and when he pass out into the
wilder some other power guard him he had no fear at all at night
he would lie down without a fire and the lion would roar about him but
thei never harm him he would plung into a swamp or a river and alwai
pass it safe when water fail he would find it without search when
there wa no food it would seem to be brought to him onc an eagl
drop a bustard at hi feet onc he found a buck fresh slain by
leopard onc when he wa veri hungri he saw that he had laid down to
sleep by a nest of ostrich egg and thi food he cook make fire
after the nativ fashion with sharp stick as he knew how to do
at length all the swamp were pass and in the third week of hi
journei he reach the slope upland on the edg of which he awok
on morn to find himself surround by a circl of great men giant
who stood stare at him he aros think that at last hi hour had
come as it seem to him that thei were about to kill him but instead of
kill him these huge men salut him humbl and offer him food upon
their knee and new hide shoe for hi feetfor hi own were worn
outand cloak and garment of skin which thing he accept thankfulli
for by now he wa almost nake then thei brought a litter and wish him
to enter it but thi he refus heed them no more as soon as he had
eaten and fill hi bag and waterbottl he start on toward the
north inde he could not have stai if he had wish hi brain seem
to be full of on thought onli to travel till he reach hi journei
end whatev it might be and befor hi ey he saw on thing onli the
spirit face of rachel that led him on toward that end sometim it wa
there for hour then for hour again it would be absent when it wa
present he look at it when it wa gone he dream of it for him it wa
the same but on thing wa ever with him that magnet in hi heart which
drew hi feet toward the north and from step to step show him the road
that he should travel
a number of the giant men accompani him he notic it but took no
heed so long as thei did not attempt to stai or turn him he wa
indiffer whether thei came or went awai as a result he travel in
much more comfort sinc now everyth wa made easi and readi for him
thu he wa fed with the best that the land provid and at night
shelter were built for him to sleep in he discov that a captain of
the giant could understand a few word of some nativ languag which he
knew and ask him why thei help him the captain repli by order of
mother of tree who or what mother of tree might be richard wa
unabl to discov so he gave up hi attempt at talk and walk on
thei travers the fertil upland and reach the edg of the fear
desert it did not frighten him he plung into it as he would have
plung into a sea or a lake of fire had it lain in hi wai he wa like
a bird whose instinct at the approach of summer or of winter lead it
without doubt or error to some far spot beyond contin and ocean
some land that it ha never seen lead it in sureti and peac to it
appoint rest a guard of the giant men came with him into the desert
also carrier who bore skin of water in that burn heat the journei
wa dread yet richard accomplish it wear down all hi escort
until at it further lip but on man wa left there even he sank
exhaust and began to beat upon a littl drum that he carri which drum
had been pass on to him by those who were left behind but richard wa
not exhaust hi strength seem to be greater than it had ever been
befor or that which drew him forward had acquir more power he
wonder vagu why a man should choos such a place and time to plai
upon a drum and went on alon
befor him some mile awai he saw a forest of tower tree that
stretch further than hi ey could reach as he approach that forest
head for a certain tall tree why he knew not the sunset dy it red
as though it had been on fire and he thought that he discern littl
shape flit to and fro amidst the bole of tree then he enter the
forest whereof the bough arch abov him like the endless roof of a
cathedr born upon innumer pillar there wa deep gloom that grew
present to dark wherein here and there glowworm shone faintli like
taper dy befor an altar and wind sigh like echo of even
prayer he could see to walk no longer sudden weari overcam him so
accord to hi custom he laid himself down to sleep at the bole of a
great tree
a while had pass he never knew how long when richard wa awaken from
deep slumber by feel mani hand fierc at work upon him these hand
were small like those of children thi he could tell from the touch of
them although the dark wa so dens that he wa abl to see noth
two of them grip him by the throat so as to prevent him from cry
out other pass cord about hi wrist ankl and middl until he
could not stir a singl limb then he wa drag back a few pace and
lash to the bole of a tree as he guess that under which he had been
sleep the hand let go of him and hi throat be free he call out
for help but those vast forest aisl seem to swallow up hi voic it
fell back on him from the canopi of huge bough abov it wa lost in the
immens silenc onli from close at hand he heard littl peal of thin and
mock laughter so he too grew silent for who wa there to help him
here he struggl to loos himself for the impalp power which had
guid him so far wa now at work within him more strongli than ever
befor it call to him to come it drew him onward it whisper to him
that the goal wa near but the more he writh and twist the deeper did
the cruel cord or creeper cut into hi flesh yet he fought on till
utterli exhaust hi head fell forward and he swoon awai

while befor the sun set i pass within the fenc
at thi tide rachel began to weep for she had learn to love thi old

terror and of pride light of hope and of despair
what did she sai to you noie ask rachel present

now the mute brought forward a slight litter woven of bough on which the
wither leav still hung bough from nya fallen tree in thi litter

shoulder for on moment she bade them halt and call rachel and noie
to her kiss them upon the brow hold up her thin childlik hand
over them in bless then follow by them both the bearer went
forward with their burden take the road that ran up the hill toward
the sacr tree as the sun set thei pass within the fenc and lai
down the litter without a word by the bole of the tree turn and
depart
the dark fell and through it rachel and noie heard nya sing for a
littl while the song ceas and thei descend the hill to the cave
for there thei fear to stai lest the tree should draw them also thei
at a littl food whilst the two women mute who had sat on each side of
nya when she show her magic stare now at them and now into the bowl
of dew that were set befor them wherein thei seem to find someth
that interest them much noie prai rachel to sleep and she tri to
do so and could not for hour after hour she toss and turn and at
length sat up sai to noie

rachel reason with her but she would not listen the end of it wa that
the two of them rose and threw on their cloak also rachel took the great
umkulu spear which she had us as a staff on her journei from the desert
to the forest all thi while the dwarfwomen watch her but did
noth onli watch
thei left the cave and walk to the mouth of the zigzag slit in the
great wall which wa open
perhap the mute will kill us in the heart of the wall said noie
if so the end will be soon and swift answer rachel
now thei were in the cleft follow it slope and wind abov them
thei could hear the movement of the guardian of the wall who sat amongst
the rough stone but these did not try to stop them inde onc or twice
when thei did not know which wai to turn in the dark littl hand
took hold of rachel cloak and guid her so thei pass through the
wall in safeti outsid of it rachel paus a moment look thi wai and
that then of a sudden she turn and walk swiftli toward the south
it wa dark dens dark in the forest yet she never seem to lose her
path hold noie by the hand she wound in and out between the
treetrunk without stumbl or even strike her foot against a root
for an hour or more thei walk on thi the strangest of strang
journei till at length rachel whisper
someth tell me to stai here and she lean against a tree and
stai while noie who wa tire sat down between the jut root of
the tree
it wa a dead tree and the top of it had been torn off in some hurrican
so that thei could see the sky abov them and by the grei hue of it knew
that it wa draw near to dawn
the sun rose and it arrow that even at middai could never pass the
canopi of foliag shot straight and vivid between the tall bare trunk
oh rachel knew the place it wa that place which she had dream of as a
child in the island of the flood river just so had the light of the
rise sun fallen on the bole of the great tree and on her white cloak
and outspread hair fallen on her and on anoth she strain her ey
into the gloom now those rai pierc it also and now by them she saw
the yellowbeard halfnak man of that longdead dream lean against
the tree hi ey were shut without doubt he wa dead thi wa but a
vision of him who had drawn her hither to share hi death it wa the
spirit of richard darrien
she drew a littl nearer and the ey open gaze at her also from
that form of hi wa cast a long shadowther it lai upon the dead
leav how came it she wonder that a spirit could throw a shadow and
why wa a spirit bound to a tree as now she perceiv he wa he saw her
and in those grei ey of hi there came a wonder look he spoke
you have drawn me from far rachel but i have never seen all of you
befor onli your face float in the air befor me although other saw
you now i see you also so i suppos that my time ha come it will soon
be over wait a littl there where i can look at you and present we
shall be togeth again i am glad
rachel could not speak a lump rose in her throat and choke her betwixt
fear and hope her heart stood still onli with the spear in her hand she
point at her own shadow thrown by the level rai of the rise sun he
look and notwithstand the strait of hi bond she saw him start
if you ar a ghost why have you a shadow he ask hoars and if you
ar not a ghost how did you come into thi haunt place
still rachel did not seem to be abl to speak onli she glide up to him
and kiss him on the lip now at length he understoodthei both
understood that thei were still live creatur beneath the sky not the
denizen of some dim world which li beyond
free me he said in a faint voic for hi brain reel i wa bound
here in my sleep thei will be back present
her intellig awok with a few swift cut of the spear she held rachel
sever hi bond then pick up hi own assegai that lai at hi feet she
thrust it into hi numb hand as he took it the forest about them seem
to becom aliv and from behind the bole of the tree around appear a
number of dwarf who ran toward them head by eddo noie sprang forward
also and stood at their side rachel turn on eddo swiftli as a startl
deer she seem to tower over him the spear in her hand
what doe thi mean priest she ask
inkosazana he answer humbl it mean that i have found a wai to
tempt thee from within the wall where none might break thy sanctuari thou
drewest thi man to thee from far with the strength that old nya gave
thee we knew it all we saw it all and we wait dai by dai in our
bowl of dew we watch him come nearer to thee we heard the messag
of nya on the drum bid the umkulu meet and escort him we heard the
last answer messag from the border of the desert tell her that he

serv hi purpos which wa to draw thee from within the wall and for
thi reason onli we permit him to enter the holi forest live now he

the white death bind him to the tree again
in an instant the spear that rachel held wa at eddo throat
dwarf she cri thi is my man and i am no mother of tree and no
pale ghost but a live woman let but on of these monkei of thine lai
a hand upon him and thou diest by the red death eddo ay by the red

the littl priest sank to hi knee trembl glanc about him for a
mean of escap
if thou killest me thou diest also he hiss
what do i care if i die she answer if my man di i wish to die
then ad in english richard take hold of him by on arm and noie
take the other if he tri to escap kill him at onc or if you ar
afraid i will
so thei seiz him by hi arm
now said rachel let us go back to the sanctuari for there thei dare
not touch us we cannot try the desert without water also thei would
follow and kill us with their poison arrow tell them noie that if
thei do not attempt to harm us we will set thi priest of their free
within the wall but if a hand is lift against us then he di at
oncebi the red death
touch them not touch them not pipe eddo lest my ghost should be
spilt with my blood touch them not i command you
the compani of dwarf chatter togeth like parrot at the dawn and the
march began first went eddo drag along between richard and noie and
after them the rais spear in her hand follow rachel while on either
side hide themselv behind the bole of the tree scrambl the
peopl of the dwarf back thei went thu through the forest rachel
tell them the road till at length the huge grei wall loom up befor
them thei came to the slit in it and noie ask
what shall we do now kill thi priest take him in with us as a hostag
or let him go
i said that he should be set free answer rachel and he would do us
more harm dead than live also hi blood would be on our hand take him
through the wall and loos him there
so onc more thei pass the slope and passag while the mute abov
watch them from their stone with marvel ey till thei reach the
open space beyond and there thei loos eddo the priest sprang back out
of reach of the dread spear and in a voic thick with rage cri to
them
fool you should have kill me while you could for now you ar in a
trap not i you ar strong and great but you cannot live without food
we mai not enter here to hurt you but you shall starv you shall starv
until you creep out and beg my merci
then make sign to the dwarf who sat about abov he vanish between
the stone
you should have kill him zoola said noie for now he will live to
kill us
i think not sister answer rachel nya said that i should follow my
heart and my heart bid me let him go our hand ar clean of hi blood
but if he had di who can tell blood is a bad seed to sow
then forget eddo she turn to richard and began to ply him with
question
but he seem to be daze and could answer littl it wa as though some
unnatur support strength had been withdrawn and now all the
fatigu of hi fear journei were take effect upon him he could
scarc stand but reel to and fro like a man in drink so that the two
women were oblig to support him across the burial ground toward the
cave advanc thu thei enter into the shadow of the holi tree and
there at the edg of it met anoth process descend from the mound
eight mute bore a litter of bough and on it lai nya dead her long
white hair hang down on either side of the litter with bow head
thei stood asid to let her pass to the grave made readi for her in a
place of honour near the wall where for a thousand year onli the mother
of the tree had been laid to rest
then thei went on and enter the cave where the lamp burn befor the
great stalactit and the heap of offer that were pile about it here
sat the two women priest gaze into their bowl as thei had left them
the death of nya had not move them the advent of thi white man did not
seem to move them perhap thei expect him at ani rate food wa made
readi and a bed of rug prepar on which he could lie
richard at some of the food stare at rachel all the while with vacant
ey as though she were still but a vision the figment of a dream then
he mutter someth about be veri tire and sink back upon the
rug fell into a deep sleep
in that sleep he remain scarc stir for full fourandtwenti
hour while rachel watch by hi side till at length her weari
overcam her and she slept also when she open her ey again thei saw
no other light than that which crept in from the mouth of the cave the
lamp which alwai burn there were out noie who wa seat near by
heard her stir and spoke
if thou art rest zoola she said i think that we had better carri
the white lord from thi place for the two witchwomen have gone and i
can find no more oil to fill the lamp
so thei felt their wai to richard purpos to lift him between them but
at rachel touch he awok and with their help walk out of the cave in
the open space beyond thei saw a strang sight for across it were
stream all the dwarfmut carri their ag and sick and infant
and bear on their back or pile up in litter their mat and cook
utensil evid thei were desert the sanctuari
why ar thei go ask rachel
i do not know answer noie but i think it is becaus no food ha
been brought to them as usual and thei ar hungri you rememb that eddo
said we should starv onli fear of death by hunger would make them leav
a place where thei and their forefath have live for gener
present thei were all gone not a live creatur wa left within the
wall except these three nor were ani more dwarf brought in to die
beneath the holi tree now at length richard seem to awak and take
rachel by the hand began to ask question of her in a low stammer
voic sinc word did not seem to come readili to him who had not spoken
hi own languag for so long
befor you begin to talk sister broke in noie let us go and see if
we can close the cleft in the wall for otherwis how shall we sleep in
peac eddo and the dwarf might creep in by night and murder us
i do not think thei dare shed blood in their holi place answer
rachel still let us see what we can do it mai be best
so thei went to the cleft and as the stone door wa open and thei could
not shut it at on veri narrow spot thei roll down rock from the loos
side of the ancient wall abov in such a fashion that it would be
difficult to pass through or over them from without thi hard task took
them mani hour moreov it wa labour wast sinc as rachel had
thought probabl the dwarf never tri to pass the wall but wait till
hunger forc them to surrend
toward even thei return to the cave and collect what food thei
could find it wa but littl enough for two spare meal no more nor
could thei discov ani in the town of the dwarf behind the tree onli of
water thei had plenti from the stream that ran out of the cave
thei at a few mouth then took their mat and cloak and went to camp
by the open in the wall so that thei might guard against surpris now
for the first time thei found leisur to talk and rachel and richard told
each other a littl of their wonder stori but thei did not tell them
all for their mind seem to be bewild and there wa much that thei
were not abl to explain it wa enough for them to know that thei had
been brought togeth again thu marvel by what power thei knew
not and that still live thei who for long week had deem the other
dead were abl to hold each other hand and gaze into each other
ey moreov now that thi had been brought about thei were tire so
tire that thei could scarc speak abov a whisper the end of it wa
that thei fell asleep all of them and so slept till morn when thei
awok somewhat refresh and at what remain of the food
the second dai wa like the first onli hotter and more sultri noie
climb to the top of the wall to watch while richard and rachel wander
about among the littl antheaplik grave and through the dwarf
villag talk and wonder happi even in their wretched but
befor the dai wa gone hunger began to get a hold of them also the
terribl stifl heat oppress them so that their word seem to die
between their lip and thei could onli sit against the wall look at
on anoth
toward even noie descend from the wall and report that larg
number of the dwarf were keep watch without flit to and fro
between the trunk of the tree like shadow the stifl night went by
and anoth dai dawn have no food thei went to the stream and drank
water then thei sat down in the shadow and wait through the long hot
hour toward even when it grew a littl cooler thei gather up
their strength and tri to find some wai of escap befor it wa too
late richard suggest that as flight wa imposs thei should give
themselv up to the dwarf but rachel answer no for then eddo would
certainli kill him and noie and take her to fill the place of mother of
the tree until she becam useless to him when she would be murder
also
then there is noth left for us but to die said richard
noth but to die she answer to die togeth and dear that
should not be so hard see that for so long we have thought each other
dead apart
yet it is hard answer richard after live through so much and
be led so far to die at last and go whither we know not befor our
time
rachel look at noie who sat opposit to them her head rest on her
hand
have you anyth to sai sister she ask
ye zoola here is a littl moss that i have found upon the stone and
she produc a small bundl let us boil it and eat it will keep us
aliv for anoth dai
what is the us ask rachel unless there is more
there is no more said noie for the leav of yonder tree ar deadli
poison and here grow no other live thing still eat and live on for
i wait a messag
a messag from whom ask rachel
a messag from the dead sister it wa promis to me by nya befor she
pass and if it doe not come then it will be time to die
so thei made fire and boil the moss till it wa a horribl sticki
substanc which thei swallow as best thei could wash it down with
gulp of water still it wa food of a kind and for a while stai the
gnaw empti pain within them onli noie at but littl so that there
might be more for the other
that night wa even hotter than those that had gone befor and dure the
dai which follow the place becam like a hell thei crept into the cave
and lai there gasp while from without came loud crack sound
caus as thei thought by the tree of the forest split in the heat
about middai the sky suddenli becam dens overcast although no breath
stir the air wa thicker than ever to breath it wa like breath
hot cream in their restless despair thei wander out of the cave and to
their surpris saw a dwarf stand upon the top of the wall it wa eddo
who call to them to come out and give themselv up
what ar the term ask noie
that thou and the wander shall die by the white death and that the
inkosazana shall be instal mother of the tree wa the answer
we refus them said noie let us go now and give us food and escort
and thou shall be spare refus and it is thou and thy peopl who will
die by that red death which nya promis thee
that we shall learn befor tomorrow said eddo with a mock laugh
and vanish down the wall
as he went a hot gust of wind burst upon them caus the forest without
to rock and groan noie turn her face toward it and seem to listen
what is it ask rachel
i heard a voic in the wind sister she answer the messag i
await ha come to me
what messag ask richard listlessli
that i will tell you by and by chief she answer come to the cave
it is no longer safe here the hurrican break
so support each other thei crept back to the cave and there noie made
fire feed it with the idol and preciou wood that had been brought
thither as offer richard and rachel watch her wonder for it
seem strang that she should make a fire in that heat where there wa
noth to cook meanwhil gust succeed gust until a tempest of
scream wind swept over them though no rain fell soon it wa so fierc
that the deeproot tree of the tribe rock abov them and loos stone
were blown from the crest of the great wall
then of a sudden noie sprang up and seiz a flame brand from the fire
it wa the limb of a fetish made of some resin wood she ran from the
cave swiftli befor thei could stop her and vanish in the gather
gloom to return again in a few moment weak and breathless come out
now she said and see a sight such as you shall never behold again
and there wa someth so strang in her voic that notwithstand
their weak thei rose and follow her
outsid the cave thei could not stand becaus of the might of the
hurrican but cast themselv upon the ground and follow noi
outstretch arm look up toward the top of the mound then thei saw
that the tree of the tribe wa on fire alreadi it vast trunk and
bough were wrap in flame which burnt furious becaus of the resin
within them while long flake of blaze moss were be swept awai to
leeward to fall among the forest that lai beyond the wall
did you do thi cri rachel to noie
ay zoola who els that wa the messag which came to me now my
offic is fulfil but you two will live though i must die i who have
destroi the peopl of the dwarf i who wa born that i should destroi

i mean that when their tree di thei die the whole race of them oh
nya told me nya told methei die as their tree di by fire to the
wall to the wall now and look follow me
forget their hungerbr weak in the wild excit of that
moment rachel and richard struggl hand in hand after noi thin
ether form across the open space thei struggl through the furiou
buffer of the gale sometim on their feet sometim on their hand
and knee till thei came to the great wall where a stairwai ran up it to
an outlook tower up thi stair thei climb slowli sinc at time the
weight of the wind pin them against the block of stone till at length
thei reach it crest and crept into the shelter of the hollow tower
henc look through the loophol in the ancient masonri thei saw a
