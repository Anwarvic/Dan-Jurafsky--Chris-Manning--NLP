chapter i an old friend
now i allan quatermain come to the weirdest with on or two
except perhap of all the experi which it ha amus me to
emploi my idl hour in record here in a strang land for after all
england is strang to me i grow elderli i have as i suppos pass
the period of enterpris and adventur and i should be well satisfi
with the lot that fate ha given to my unworthi self
to begin with i am still aliv and in health when by all the rule i
should have been dead mani time over i suppos i ought to be thank
for that but befor express an opinion on the point i should have
to be quit sure whether it is better to be aliv or dead the religi
plump for the latter though i have never observ that the religi
ar more eager to die than the rest of us poor mortal
for instanc if thei ar told that their holi heart ar wrong thei
spend time and much monei in rush to a place call nauheim
in germani to put them right by mean of waterdrink therebi
shorten their hour of heavenli bliss and depriv their heir of
a certain amount of cash the same thing appli to buxton in my own
neighbourhood and gout especi when it threaten the stomach or the
throat even archbishop will do these thing to sai noth of such
small fry as dean or stout and promin lai figur of the church
from common sinner like myself such conduct might be expect but in
the case of those who ar obvious pois on the topmost rung of the
jacobeani mean the heavenlyladd it is legitim to inquir why
thei show such reluct in jump off as a matter of fact the onli
person that individu i have seen quit will to die except now
and again to save somebodi els whom thei were so foolish as to care for
more than thei did for themselv have been not those upon whom the
light ha shine to quot an earnest paper i chanc to read thi
morn but to quot again the sin heathen wander in their
nativ black by which i understand the writer to refer to their
moral state and not to their sabl skin wherein for the most part thei
ar also condemn to wander that is if thei happen to have been born
south of a certain degre of latitud
to come to fact the staff of faith which each must shape for himself
is often hewn from unsuit kind of wood ye even by the veri best
among us willow for instanc is pretti and easi to cut but try to
support yourself with it on the edg of a precipic and see where you
ar then of a truth you will long for ironbark or even home oak i
might carri my parabl further some allus to the proper materi
of which to fashion the helmet of salvat suggest themselv to me for
exampl but i wont
the truth is that we fear to die becaus all the religion ar full of
uncomfort hint as to what mai happen to us afterward as a reward
for our deviat from their law and we half believ in someth
wherea often the savag not be troubl with religion fear less
becaus he half believ in noth for veri few inhabit of thi
earth can attain either to complet belief or to it absolut opposit
thei can seldom lai their hand upon their heart and sai thei know
that thei will live for ever or sleep for ever there remain in the
case of most honest men an element of doubt in either hypothesi
that is what make thi stori of mine so interest at ani rate to
me sinc it doe seem to suggest that whether or no i have a futur
as person i hold to be the case and not altogeth without evid
certainli i have had a past though so far as i know in thi world
onli a fact if it be a fact from which can be deduc all kind of
argument accord to the tast of the reason
and now for my experi which it is onli fair to add mai after all
have been no more than a long and connect dream yet how wa i to
dream of land event and peopl where of i have onli the vaguest
knowledg or none at all unless inde as some sai be a part of
thi world we have hidden awai somewher in ourselv an acquaint
with everyth that ha ever happen in the world howev it doe
not much matter and it is useless to discuss that which we cannot prove
here at ani rate is the stori
in a book or a record which i have written down and put awai with other
under the titl of the ivori child i have told the tale of a certain
expedit i made in compani with lord ragnal it object wa to search
for hi wife who wa stolen awai while travel in egypt in a state of
mental incapac result from shock caus by the loss of her child
under tragic and terribl circumst the thiev were the priest of
a certain bastard arab tribe who on account of a birthmark shape like
the young moon which wa visibl abov her breast believ her to be
the priestess or oracl of their worship thi worship evid had it
origin in ancient egypt sinc although thei did not seem to know it
the priestess wa noth less than a personif of the great
goddess isi and the ivori child their fetish wa a statu of the
infant horu the fabl son of isi and osiri whom the egyptian
look upon as the overcom of set or the devil the murder of osiri
befor hi resurrect and ascent to heaven to be the god of the dead
i need not set down afresh all that happen to us on thi remark
adventur suffic it to sai that in the end we recov the ladi and
that her mind wa restor to her befor she left the kendah countri
howev the priesthood present her with two ancient roll of
papyru also with a quantiti of a certain herb not unlik tobacco in
appear which by the kendah wa call taduki onc befor we
took our great homeward journei across the desert ladi ragnal and i
had a curiou convers about thi herb whereof the properti is to
caus the person who inhal it fume to becom clairvoy or to
dream dream whichev the truth mai be it wa us for thi purpos
in the mystic ceremoni of the kendah religion when under it
influenc the priestess or oracl of the ivori child wa wont to
announc divin revel dure her tenur of thi offic ladi
ragnal wa frequent subject to the spell of the taduki vapour
and said strang thing some of which i heard with my own ear also
myself onc i experienc it effect and saw a curiou vision whereof
mani of the particular were afterward translat into fact
now the convers which i have mention wa shortli to the effect
that she ladi ragnal believ a time would come when she or i or both
of us were destin to imbib these taduki fume and see wonder
pictur of some past or futur exist in which we were both
concern thi knowledg she declar had come to her while she wa
offici in an appar mindless condit as the priestess of the
kendah god call the ivori child
at the time i did not think it wise to pursu so excit a subject with
a woman whose mind had been recent unbalanc and afterward in the
stress of new experi i forgot all about the matter or at ani rate
onli thought of it veri rare
onc howev it did recur to me with some forc shortli after i
came to england to spend my remain dai far from the temptat of
adventur i wa beguil into becom a steward of a chariti dinner
and what wa wors into attend the said dinner although it
object were admir it prove on of the most dread function
in which i wa ever call upon to share there wa a vast number of
peopl some of them highli distinguish who had come to support the
chariti or to show off their order i dont know which and other like
myself not at all distinguish just common subscrib who had no
order and stood about the crowd room like waiter look for a job
at the dinner which wa veri bad i sat at a tabl so remot that i
could hear but littl of the intermin speech which wa perhap
fortun for me in these circumst i drift into convers
with my neighbour a queer wizen blackbeard man who somehow
or other had found out that i wa acquaint with the wilder part of
africa he prove to be a wealthi scientist whose passion it wa
to studi the properti of herb especi of such as grow in the
interior of south america where he had been travel for some year
present he mention a root name yag known to the indian which
when pound up into a past and taken in the form of pill had the
effect of enabl the patient to see event that were pass at a
distanc inde he alleg that a vision thu produc had caus him
to return home sinc in it he saw that some rel of hi i think
a twinsist wa danger ill in fact howev he might as well
have stai awai as he onli arriv in london on the dai after her
funer
as i saw that he wa realli interest in the subject and observ that
he wa a veri temper man who did not seem to be romanc i told him
someth of my experi with taduki to which he listen with a
kind of rapt but suppress excit when i affect disbelief in the
whole busi he differ from me almost rude ask why i reject
phenomena simpli becaus i wa too dens to understand them i answer
perhap becaus such phenomena were inconveni and upset on idea
to thi he repli that all progress involv the upset of exist
idea moreov he implor me if the chanc should ever come my wai
to pursu experi with taduki fume and let him know the result
here our convers came to an end for suddenli a band that wa
brai near by struck up god save the queen and we hastili
exchang card and part i onli mention it becaus had it not
occur i think it probabl that i should never have been in a
posit to write thi histori
the remark of my acquaint remain in my mind and influenc it so
much that when the occas came i did as a kind of duti what howev
much i wa press i am almost sure i should never have done for ani
other reason just becaus i thought that i ought to take an opportun
of try to discov what wa the truth of the matter as it chanc it
wa quick in come
here i should explain that i attend the dinner of which i have spoken
not veri long after a veri lengthi absenc from england whither i had
come to live when king solomon mine had made me rich therefor it
happen that between the conclus of my kendah adventur some year
befor and thi time i saw noth and heard littl of lord and ladi
ragnal onc a rumour did reach me howev i think through sir henri
curti or captain good that the former had di as a result of an
accid what the accid wa my inform did not know and as i wa
just start on a far journei at the time i had no opportun of
make inquiri my talk with the botan scientist determin me
to do so inde a few dai later i discov from a book of refer
that lord ragnal wa dead leav no heir also that hi wife surviv
him
i wa work myself up to write to her when on morn the postman
brought me here at the grang a letter which had ragnal castl
print on the flap of the envelop i did not know the write
which wa veri clear and firm for as it chanc to the best of my
recollect i had never seen that of ladi ragnal here is a copi of
the letter it contain
my dear mr quatermainveri strang i have just seen at a
meet of the horticultur societi a gentleman who declar
that a few dai ago he sat next to you at some public dinner
inde i do not think there can be ani doubt for he show me your
card which he had in hi purs with a yorkshir address upon it
a disput had arisen as to whether a certain varieti of crinum
lili wa first found in africa or southern america thi
gentleman an author upon south american flora made a speech
sai that he had never met with it there but that an
acquaint of hi mr quatermain to whom he had spoken on the
subject said that he had seen someth of the sort in the
interior of africa thi wa quit true for i rememb the
incid at the tea which follow the meet i spoke to thi
gentleman whose name i never caught and to my astonish learnt
that he must have been refer to you whom i believ to be
dead for so we were told a long time ago thi seem certain
for in addit to the evid of the name he describ your
person appear and told me that you had come to live in
england
my dear friend i can assur you it is long sinc i heard anyth
which rejoic me so much oh as i write all the past come back
flow in upon me like a pentup flood of water but i trust that
of thi i shall soon have an opportun of talk to you so let
it be for a while
ala my friend sinc we part on the shore of the red sea
tragedi ha pursu me as you will know for both my husband and
i wrote to you although you did not answer the letter i never
receiv them we reach england safe and took up our old
life again though to tell you the truth after my african
experi thing could never be quit the same to me or for the
matter of that to georg either to a great extent he chang hi
pursuit and certain polit ambit which he onc cherish
seem no longer to appeal to him he becam a student of past
histori and especi of egyptolog which under all the
circumst you mai think strang as i did howev it suit
me well enough sinc i also have tast that wai so we work
togeth and i can now read hieroglyph as well as most peopl
on year he said that he would like to go to egypt again if i
were not afraid i answer that it had not been a veri lucki
place for us but that person i wa not in the least afraid
and long to return there for as you know i have or think i
have ti with egypt and inde with all africa well we went
and had a veri happi time although i wa alwai expect to see
old hart come round the corner
after thi it becam a custom with us who sinc georg
practic gave up shoot and attend the hous of lord had
noth to keep us in england to winter in egypt we did thi for
five year in success live in a bungalow which we built at a
place in the desert not far from the bank of the nile about
half wai between luxor which wa the ancient thebe and assouan
georg took a great fanci to thi spot when first he saw it and
so in truth did i for like memphi it attract me so much that
i us to laugh and sai i believ that onc i had someth to do
with it
now near to our villa that we call ragnal after thi hous
ar the remain of a templ which were almost buri in the sand
thi templ georg obtain permiss to excav it prove to
be a long and costli busi but as he did not mind spend the
monei that wa no obstacl for four winter we work at it
emploi sever hundr men as we went on we discov that
although not on of the largest the templ ow to it have
been buri by the sand dure or shortli after the roman epoch
remain much more perfect than we had expect becaus the earli
christian had never got at it with their chisel and hammer
befor long i hope to show you pictur and photograph of the
variou court etc so i will not attempt to describ them now
it is a templ to isisbuilt or rather rebuilt over the remain
of an older templ on a site that seem to have been call amada
at ani rate in the later dai and so name after a citi in nubia
appar by on of the amenhetep pharaoh who had conquer it
it style is beauti be of the best period of the egyptian
renaiss under the last nativ dynasti
at the begin of the fifth winter at length we approach the
sanctuari a difficult busi becaus of the retain wall
that had to be built to keep the sand from flow down as fast as
it wa remov and the great quantiti of stuff that must be
carri off by the tramwai in so do we came upon a shallow
grave which appear to have been hastili fill in and roughli
cover over with pave stone like the rest of the court as
though to conceal it exist in thi grave lai the skeleton of
a larg man togeth with the rust blade of an iron sword and
some fragment of armour evid he had never been mummifi
for there were no wrap canop jar ushapti figur or
funer offer the state of the bone show us why for the
right forearm wa cut through and the skull smash in also an
iron arrowhead lai among the rib the man had been buri
hurriedli after a battl in which he had met hi death search
in the dust beneath the bone we found a gold ring still on on of
the finger on it bezel wa engrav the cartouch of peroa
belov of ra now peroa probabl mean pharaoh and perhap he
wa khabasha who revolt against the persian and rule for a
year or two after which he is suppos to have been defeat and
kill though of hi end and place of burial there is no record
whether these were the remnant of khabasha himself or of on of
hi high minist or gener who wore the king cartouch upon
hi ring in token of hi offic of cours i cannot sai
when georg had read the cartouch he hand me the ring which i
slip upon the first finger of my left hand where i still wear
it then leav the grave open for further examin we went
on with the work for we were greatli excit at length thi wa
toward even we had clear enough of the sanctuari which wa
small to uncov the shrine that if not a monolith wa made of
four piec of granit so wonderfulli put togeth that on could
not see the joint on the curv architrav as i think it is
call wa carv the symbol of a wing disc and beneath in
hieroglyph as fresh as though thei had onli been cut yesterdai
an inscript to the effect that peroa royal son of the sun
gave thi shrine as an excel etern work togeth with the
statu of the holi mother and the holi child to the eman
of the great goddess isi and the god horu amada royal ladi
be votaress or highpriestess
we onli read the hieroglyph veri hurriedli be anxiou to
see what wa within the shrine that the cedar door have rot
awai wa fill with fine drift sand basket by basket
we got it out and then my friend there appear the most
beauti lifes statu of isi carv in alabast that ever
i have seen she wa seat on a thronelik chair and wore the
vultur cap on which trace of colour remain her arm were held
forward as though to support a child which perhap she wa
suckl as on of the breast wa bare but if so the child had
gone the execut of the statu wa exquisit and it tender and
mystic face extraordinarili beauti so lifelik also that i
think it must have been copi from a live model oh my friend
when i look upon it which we did by the light of the candl
for the sun wa sink and shadow gather in that excav
hole i feltnev mind what i feltperhap you can guess who
know my histori
while we stare and stare i long to go upon my knee i knew
not why suddenli i felt a faint trembl of the ground at the
same moment the head overs of the work a man call achmet
rush up to us shout outback back the wall ha burst
the sand run
he seiz me by the arm and drag me awai besid of and behind
the grave georg turn to follow next instant i saw a kind of
wave of sand on the crest of which appear the stone of the
wall curl over and break it struck the shrine overturn and
shatter it which make me think it wa made of four piec and
shatter also the alabast statu within for i saw it head
strike georg upon the back and throw him forward he reel and
fell into the open grave which in anoth moment wa fill and
cover with the dbri that seem to grip me to my middl in it
flow after thi i rememb noth more until hour later i
found myself ly in our hous
achmet and hi egyptian had done noth inde none of them
could be persuad to approach the place till the sun rose
becaus as thei said the old god of the land whom thei look
upon as devil were angri at be disturb and would kill them
as thei had kill the bei mean georg then distract as i
wa i went myself for there wa no other european there to find
that the whole site of the sanctuari wa buri beneath hundr
of ton of sand that begin at the gap in the broken wall
had flow from everi side inde it would have taken week to
dig it out sinc to sink a shaft wa impractic and so
danger that the local offici refus to allow it to be
attempt the end of it wa that an english bishop came up from
cairo and consecr the ground by special arrang with the
govern which of cours make it imposs that thi part of
the templ should be further disturb after thi he read the
burial servic over my dear husband
so there is the end of a veri terribl stori which i have written
down becaus i do not wish to have to talk about it more than is
necessari when we meet for dear mr quatermain we shall meet
as i alwai knew that we shouldy even after i heard that you
were dead you will rememb that i told you so year ago in
kendah land and that it would happen after a great chang in my
life though what that chang might be i could not sai
thi is the end of the letter except for certain suggest date for the
visit which she took for grant i should make to ragnal
chapter ii ragnal castl
when i had finish read thi amaz document i lit my pipe and
set to work to think it over the hypothet inquir might ask why i
thought it amaz there wa noth odd in a dilettant englishman of
highli cultiv mind take to egyptolog and be as it chanc
on of the richest men in the kingdom spend a fraction of hi wealth
in excav templ nor wa it strang that he should have happen
to die by accid when engag in that pursuit which i can imagin to
be veri fascin in the delight winter climat of egypt he wa
not the first person to be buri by a fall of sand why onli a littl
while ago the same fate overtook a nurserygov and the child in
her charg who were try to dig out a martin nest in a pit in
thi veri parish their oper brought down a huge mass of the
overhang bank beneath which the sandvein had been hollow by
workmen who desert the pit when thei saw that it had becom unsaf
next dai i and my garden help to recov their bodi for their
whereabout wa not discov until the follow morn and a sad
busi it wa
yet taken in conjunct with the histori of thi coupl the whole
ragnal affair wa veri strang when but a child ladi ragnal then the
hon miss holm had been identifi by the priest of a remot african
tribe as the oracl of their peculiar faith which we afterward prove
to be deriv from old egypt in short the worship of isi and horu
subsequ thei tri to steal her awai and through the accid of
my intervent fail later on after her marriag when shock had
depriv her of her mind these priest renew the attempt thi time
in egypt and succeed in the end we rescu her in central africa
where she wa plai the part of the mothergoddess isi and even
wear her ancient robe next she and her husband came home with their
mind turn toward a branch of studi that took them back to egypt
here thei devot themselv to unearth a templ and find out that
among all the god of egypt who seem to have been extrem numer
it wa dedic to isi and horu the veri divin with whom thei
recent thei had been so intim concern if in tradit and
degener form
moreov that wa not the finish of it thei come to the sanctuari thei
discov the statu of the goddess with the child gone as their child
wa gone a disast occur and both destroi and buri ragnal so
effectu that noth of him is ever seen again he just vanish
into anoth man grave and remain there
a common sort of catastroph enough it is true though peopl of
superstiti mind might have thought that it look as though the
goddess or whatev forc wa behind the goddess wa work vengeanc
on the man who desecr her ancient shrine and by the wai though
i cannot rememb whether or no i mention it in the ivori child
i recal that the old priest of the kendah hart onc told me he wa
sure ragnal would meet with a violent death thi seem like enough
in that countri under our circumst there still i ask him why he
answer
becaus he ha laid hand on that which is holi and not meant for man
and he look at ladi ragnal
i remark that all women were holi whereon he repli that he did not
think so and chang the subject
well ragnal who had marri the ladi who onc serv as the last
priestess of isi upon earth wa kill wherea she the priestess
wa almost miracul preserv from harm andoh the whole stori
wa deuc odd and that is all poor ragnal he wa a great english
gentleman and on whom when first i knew him i held to be the most
fortun person i ever met endow as he wa with everi advantag of
mind bodi and estat yet in the end thi did not prove to be the case
well while he live he wa a good friend and a good fellow and none
can hope for a better epitaph in a world where all thing ar soon
forgotten
and now what wa i to do to tell the truth i did not altogeth desir
to reopen thi chapter in past histori or to have to listen to pain
reminisc from the lip of a bereav woman moreov beauti
as she had been for doubtless she wa pass now and charm as of
cours she remainedi do not think i ever knew anyon who wa quit so
charmingther wa someth about ladi ragnal which alarm me she
did not resembl ani other woman of cours no woman is ever quit like
anoth but in her case the separ if i mai so call it wa veri
mark it wa as though she had walk out of a differ ag or even
world and been but superfici cloth with the attribut of our
own i felt that from the first moment i set ey upon her and while
read her letter the sensat return with ad forc
also for me she had a peculiar attract and not on of the ordinari
kind it is curiou to find oneself strang intim with a person
of whom after all on doe not know much just as if on realli knew a
great deal that wa shut off by a thin but quit impass door if so
i did not want to open that door for who could tell what might be on
the other side of it and intim convers with a ladi in whose
compani on ha share veri strang experi not infrequ lead
to the open of everi kind of door
further i had made up my mind some time ago to have no more friendship
with women who ar so full of surpris but to live out the rest of
my life in a kind of monasteri of men who have few surpris be
creatur whose thought ar nearli alwai open and whose action can
alwai be foretold
lastli there wa that taduki busi well there at ani rate i wa
clear and decid no earthli power would induc me to have anyth
more to do with taduki smoke of cours i rememb that ladi ragnal
onc told me kindli but firmli that i would if she wish but that wa
just where she made a mistak for the rest it seem unkind to refus
her invit now when she wa in troubl especi as i had onc
promis that if ever i could be of help she had onli to command me
no i must go but if that wordtadukiwer so much as mention i
would leav again in a hurri moreov it would not be for doubtless
she had forgotten all about the stuff by now even if it were not lost
the end of it wa that as i did not wish to write a long letter enter
into all that ladi ragnal had told me i sent her a telegram sai
that if conveni to her i would arriv at the castl on the follow
saturdai even and ad that i must be back here on the tuesdai
afternoon as i had guest come to stai with me on that dai thi
wa perfectli true as the season wa midnovemb and i wa to begin
shoot my covert on the wednesdai morn a function that onc
fix cannot be postpon
in due cours an answer arriveddelight but hope that you would
have been abl to stai longer
behold me then about six oclock on the said saturdai even be onc
more whirl by a splendid pair of hors through the gatewai arch of
ragnal castl the carriag stop beneath the portico the great
door flew open reveal the glow of the hall fire and light within
the footman sprang down from the box and two other footmen descend
the step to assist me and my belong out of the carriag these
i rememb consist of a handbag with my dress cloth and a
yellowback novel
so on of them took the handbag and the other had to content himself
with the novel which made me wish i had brought a portmanteau as well
if onli for the look of the thing the pair thu burden escort me
up the step and deliv me over to the butler who scan me with a
critic ey i scan him also and perceiv that he wa a veri fine
specimen of hi class inde hi state presenc so overcam me that
i remark nervous as he help me off with my coat that when last i
wa here anoth had fill hi offic
inde sir he said and what wa hi name sir
savag i repli
and where might he be now sir
insid a snake i answer at least he wa insid a snake but now i
hope he is wait upon hi master in heaven
the man recoil a littl pull off my coat with a jerk then he
cough rub hi bald head stare and recov himself with an
effort said
inde sir i onli came to thi place after the death of hi late
lordship when her ladyship chang all the household alfr show
thi gentleman up to her ladyship boudoir and william take
hisbaggageto the blue room her ladyship wish to see you at onc
sir befor the other come
so i went up the big staircas to a part of the castl that i did not
rememb wonder who the other might be almost could i have sworn
that the shade of savag accompani me up those stair i could feel
him at my side
present a door wa thrown open and i wa usher into a room
somewhat dimli lit and full of the scent of flower by the fire near a
teatabl stood a ladi clad in some dark dress with the light glint
on her richhu hair she turn and i saw that she still wore the
necklac of red stone and beneath it on her breast a singl red
flower for thi wa ladi ragnal about that there wa no doubt at all
so littl doubt inde that i wa amaz i had expect to see a stout
elderli woman whom i should onli know by the colour of her ey and her
voic and perhap certain trick of manner but thi wa the mischief
of it i could not perceiv ani chang at ani rate in that light
she wa just the same perhap a littl fuller in figur which wa an
advantag perhap a littl more consid in her movement perhap a
littl taller or at ani rate more state and that wa all
these thing i learn in a flash then with a murmur mr quatermain
my ladi the footman close the door and she saw me
move quickli toward me with both her hand outstretch she
exclaim in that honeysoft voic of her
oh my dear friend stop and ad why you havent chang a
bit
fossil wear well i repli but that is just what i wa think of
you
then it is veri rude of you to call me a fossil when i am onli
approach that stage oh i am glad to see you i am glad and she
gave me both the outstretch hand
upon my word i felt inclin to kiss her and have wonder ever sinc if
she would have been veri angri i am not certain that she did not divin
the inclin at ani rate after a littl paus she drop my hand
and laugh then she said
i must tell you at onc a most terribl catastroph ha happen
instantli it occur to me that she had forgotten have inform me by
letter of all the detail of her husband death such thing chanc
to peopl who have onc lost their memori so i tri to look as
sympathet as i felt sigh and wait
it not so bad as all that she said with a littl shake of her head
read my thought as she alwai had the power to do from the first
moment we met we can talk about that afterward it onli that i
hope we were go to have a quiet two dai and now the atterbysmith
ar come ye in half an hour five of them
the atterbysmith i exclaim for somehow i too felt disappoint
who ar the atterbysmith
cousin of georg hi nearest rel thei think he ought to have
left them everyth but he didnt becaus he could never bear the
sight of them you see hi properti wa unentail and he left it all to
me now the entir famili is advanc to suggest that i should leav
it to them as perhap i might have done if thei had not chosen to come
just now
why didnt you put them off i ask
becaus i couldnt she answer with a littl stamp of her foot
otherwis do you suppos thei would have been here thei were far too

suspici anim whereon the five of them stare at ladi ragnal
cigarett which she held between her finger
ye said ladi ragnal wont you have on mr quatermain hand mr

a fit of asthma
after thi i am sure i dont know what happen for mutter someth
about it be time to dress i rush from the room and wander about
until i could find someon to conduct me to my own where i linger
until i heard the dinnerbel ring but even thi retreat wa not
without disast for in my hurri i trod upon on of the young ladi

she were break in two thereon archibald giggl again and dolli and
polli remark with on voicethei alwai spoke togeth
oh clumsi
to complet my misfortun i miss my wai go downstair and strai
to and fro like a lost lamb until i found myself confront by a green
baiz door which remind me of someth i stood stare at it till
suddenli a vision aros befor me of myself follow a bell wire
through that veri door in the dark of the night when in search for
the late mr savag upon a certain urgent occas ye there could be
no doubt about it for look there wa the wire and strang it seem
to me that i should live to behold it again curios led me to push
the door open just to ascertain if my memori serv me aright about
the exact local of the room next moment i regret it for i fell
straight into the arm of either polli or dolli
oh said she iv just been sewn up
i reflect that thi wa my case also in anoth sens but ask
feebli if she knew the wai downstair
she didnt neither of us did till at length we met mr smith come
to look for her
if i had been a burglar she could not have regard me with graver
suspicion but at ani rate she knew the wai downstair and there to
my joi i found my old friend scroop and hi wife both of them grown
stout and elderli but as jolli as ever after which the smith famili
ceas to troubl me
also there wa the rector of the parish dr jeffrei and an absurdli
young wife whom he had recent marri a fluffyhead littl thing
with round ey and a cheer perki manner the two of them togeth
look exactli like a turkeycock and a chicken i rememb him well
enough and to my astonish he rememb me perhap becaus ladi
ragnal when she had hastili invit him to meet the smith famili
mention that i wa come lastli there wa the curat a dark
young man who seem to be alwai brood over the secret of time and
etern though perhap he wa onli think about hi dinner or the
next dai servic

i had made the acquaint of hart and mart also of the beauti
miss holm as ladi ragnal wa then call the scroop the jeffrei
and i gather in on group and the atterbysmith in anoth like
a forc about to attack while between the two brood and
indetermin stood the curat a neutral observ
present ladi ragnal arriv apolog for be late for some
reason best known to herself she had chosen to dress as though for a
great parti i believ it wa out of mischief and in order to show mr
atterbysmith some of the diamond she wa firmli determin that famili
should never inherit at ani rate there she stood glitter and love
and smile upon us
then came dinner and onc more i march to the great hall in her
compani dr jeffrei got mr smith papa smith got mr jeffrei who
look like a grecian maiden walk into dinner with the minotaur
scroop got on of the miss smith she who wore a pink bow the gloomi

that dread woman is alwai write to me about the ragnal diamond
so i thought that she should see some of them for the first and last
time do you know i havent worn these thing sinc georg and i went to

jeffrei will you sai grace pleas

sat between my hostess and mr scroop and the rest were too far off
for convers moreov as archibald develop an unexpect quantiti
of small talk and scroop on the other side amus himself by fill
pinkbow miss smith innoc mind with preposter stori about

she laugh in her charm wai and said

someth at hi hostess from the other end of the tabl and our
convers came to an end
i sai old chap whisper scroop in my ear when we stood up to see

without deign ani repli i seiz my glass and went to sit down
between the canon and the bull of bashan
chapter iii allan give hi word
mr atterbysmith prove on acquaint to be even wors than unfond
fanci paint him he wa a gentleman in a wai and of good famili
whereof the real name wa atterbi the smith have been ad to secur
a moder fortun left to him on that condit hi connect with
lord ragnal wa not close and through the mother side for the
rest he live in some southcoast wateringplac and fanci himself a
sportsman becaus he had on variou occas hire a scottish moor or
deer forest evid he had never done anyth nor earn a shill
dure all hi life and wa bring hi famili up to follow in hi
useless footstep the chief note of hi charact wa that intoler
vaniti which so often mark men who have noth whatsoev about which
to be vain also he had a great idea of hi right and what wa due to
him which he appear to consid includ upon what ground i could
not in the least understand the revers of all the ragnal properti
and wealth i do not think i need sai ani more about him except that he
bore me to extinct especi after hi fourth glass of port
perhap howev the son wa wors for he ask question without
number and when at last i wa reduc to silenc lectur me about
shoot ye thi callow youth who wa at sandhurst instruct
me allan quatermain how to kill eleph he who had never seen an
eleph except when he fed it with bun at the zoo at last mr smith
who to scroop great amus had taken the end of the tabl and
assum the posit of host gave the signal to move and we adjourn
to the drawingroom
i dont know what had happen but there we found the atmospher
distinctli stormi the ampl mr smith sat in a chair fan herself
which caus the barbar ornament she wore to clank upon her fat arm
upon either side of her pale and indetermin stood polli and dolli
each pretend to read a book somehow the three of them remind me of
a coatofarm seen in a nightmar british matron sejant with modesti
and virtu as support opposit on the other side of the fire and
evid veri angri stood ladi ragnal regard
do i understand you to sai luna i heard mr as ask in reson
tone as i enter the room that you actual plai the part of a
heathen goddess among these savag clad in a transpar bedrob
ye mr atterbysmith repli ladi ragnal and a nightcap of
feather i will put it on for you if you wont be shock or perhap
on of your daughter
oh said both the young ladi togeth pleas be quiet here come
the gentlemen
after thi there wa a heavi silenc broken onli by the stifl giggl
in the background of mr scroop and the canon fluffyhead wife
who to do her justic had some fun in her thank good the even
or rather that part of it did not last long sinc present mr
atterbysmith after studi me for a long while with a cold ey rose
majest and swept off to bed follow by her offspr
afterward i ascertain from mr scroop that ladi ragnal had been
amus herself by take awai my charact in everi possibl manner for
the benefit of her connect who were left with a gener impress
that i wa the chief of a nativ tribe somewher in central africa where
i dwelt in light attir surround by the usual accessori no wonder
therefor that mr as thought it best to remov her twin pet as
she call them out of my raven reach
then the scroop went awai have arrang for me to lunch with them
on the morrow an invit that i hastili accept though i heard
ladi ragnal muttermean beneath her breath with them depart the
canon and hi wife and the curat be as thei said earli bird
with duti to perform after thi ladi ragnal paid me out by go to
bed have instruct moxlei to show us to the smoke room where
she whisper as she said good night i hope you will enjoi yourself
over the rest of the night i draw a veil for a solid hour and
threequart did i sit in that room between thi dread pair be
altern question and lectur at length i could stand it no
longer and while pretend to help myself to whiskei and soda slip
through the door and fled upstair
i arriv late to breakfast purpos and found that i wa wise for
ladi ragnal wa absent upstair recov from a headach mr
asmith wa also suffer from a headach downstair the result of
champagn port and whiski mix and all hi famili seem to have
pain in their temper have ascertain that thei were go to the
church in the park i depart to on two mile awai and thenc walk
straight on to the scroop where i had a veri pleasant time remain
till five in the afternoon i return to tea at the castl where i
found ladi ragnal so cross that i went to church again to the six
oclock servic thi time onli get back in time to dress for
dinner here i wa paid out for i had to take in mr atterbysmith oh
what a meal wa that we sat for the most part in solemn silenc
broken onli by request to pass the salt i observ with satisfact
howev that thing were grow live at the other end of the tabl
where asmith pre wa drink a good deal too much wine at last i
heard him sai
we had hope to spend a few dai with you my dear luna but as you
tell us that your engag make thi impossibleand he paus to
drink some port whereon ladi ragnal remark inconsequ
i assur you the ten oclock train is far the best and i have order
the carriag at halfpast nine which is not veri earli
as your engag make thi imposs he repeat we would ask
for the opportun of a littl famili conclav with you tonight
here all of them turn and glower at me
certainli said ladi ragnal the sooner ti over the sooner to
sleep mr quatermain i am sure will excus us will you not i
have had the museum lit up for you mr quatermain you mai find some
egyptian thing there that will interest you
oh with pleasur i murmur and fled awai
i spent a veri instruct two hour in the museum studi variou
egyptian antiqu includ a coupl of mummi which rather
terrifi me thei look so veri corpselik stand there in
their wrap on wa that of a ladi who wa a singer of amen i
rememb i wonder where she wa sing now and what song present
i came to a glass case which rivet my attent for abov it wa a
label bear the follow word two papyri given to ladi ragnal
by the priest of the kendah tribe in africa within were the papyri
unrol and beneath each of the document it translat so far as
thei could be translat for thei were somewhat broken no 1 which
wa date in the first year of peroa appear to be the offici
appoint of the royal ladi amada to be the prophetess to the templ
of isi and horu the child which wa also call amada and situat
on the east bank of the nile abov thebe evid thi wa the same
templ of which ladi ragnal had written to me in her letter where her
husband had met hi death by accid a coincid which made me start
when i rememb how and where the document had come into her hand and
what kind of offic she fill at the time
the second papyru or rather it translat contain a most
comprehens curs upon ani man who ventur to interfer with the
person sanctiti of thi same royal ladi of amada who appar in
virtu of her offic wa doom to perpetu celibaci like the vestal
virgin i do not rememb all the term of the curs but i know that
it invok the vengeanc of isi the mother ladi of the moon and horu
the child upon anyon who should dare such a desecr and in so mani
word doom him to death by violenc far from hi own countri where
first he had look on ra ie the sun and also to certain spiritu
suffer afterward
the document gave me the idea that it wa compos in troubl dai to
protect that particularli sacr person the prophetess of isi whose
cult as i have sinc learn wa rise in egypt at the time from
threaten danger perhap at the hand of some foreign man it occur
to me even that thi princess for evid she wa a descend of
king had been appoint to a most sacr offic for that veri purpos
men who shrink from littl will often fear to incur the direct curs of
wide vener god in order to obtain their desir even if thei
be not their own god such were my conclus about thi curiou and
ancient write which i regret i cannot give in full as i neglect to
copi it at the time
i mai add that it seem extrem strang to me that it and the other
which dealt with a particular templ in egypt should have pass into
ladi ragnal hand over two thousand year later in a distant part of
africa and that subsequ her husband should have been kill in
her presenc whilst excav the veri templ to which thei refer
whenc too in all probabl thei were taken moreov oddli enough
ladi ragnal had herself for a while fill the rle of isi in a shrine
whereof these two papyri had been part of the sacr appurten for
unknown ag and on of her offici titl there wa prophetess and
ladi of the moon whose symbol she wore upon her breast
although i have alwai recogn that there ar a great mani more
thing in the world than ar dreamt of in our philosophi i sai with
truth and confid that i am not a superstiti man yet i confess
that these paper and the circumst connect with them made me
feel afraid
also thei made me wish that i had not come to ragnal castl
well the atterbysmith had so far effectu put a stop to ani talk
of such matter and even if ladi ragnal should succe in get
rid of them by that morn train as to which i wa doubt there
remain but a singl dai of my visit dure which it ought not to be
hard to stave off the subject thu i reflect stand face to face
with those mummi till present i observ that the singer of amen
who wore a stare gold mask seem to be watch me with her oblong
paint ey to my fanci a sardon smile gather in them and spread
to the mouth
that what you think thi smile seem to sai as onc befor you
thought that fate could be escap wait and see my friend wait and
see
not in thi room ani wai i remark aloud and depart in a hurri
down the passag which led to the main staircas
befor i reach it end a remark sight caus me to halt in the
shadow the atterbysmith famili were go to bed en bloc thei
march in singl file up the great stair each of them carri a
hand candl papa led and young hope brought up the rear their
counten were full of war even the twin look like angri lamb
but someth written on them inform me that thei had suffer defeat
recent and grievou so thei vanish up the stairwai and out of my ken
for ever
when thei had gone i start again and ran straight into ladi ragnal
if her guest had been angri it wa clear that she wa furiou
almost weep with rage inde moreov she turn and rent me
you ar a wretch she said to run awai and leav me all dai long
with those horribl peopl well thei will never come here again for i
have told them that if thei do the servant have order to shut the door
in their face
not know what to sai i remark that i had spent a most instruct
even in the museum which seem to make her angrier than ever at
ani rate she whisk off without even sai good night and left
me stand there afterward i learn that the ass had calmli
inform ladi ragnal that she had stolen their properti and demand
that as an act of justic she should make a will leav everyth
she possess to them and meanwhil furnish them with an allow of
4000 a year what i did not learn were the exact term of her answer
next morn alfr when he call me brought me a note from hi
mistress which i fulli expect would contain a request that i should
depart by the same train as her other guest it real content
howev were veri differ
my dear friend it ran i am so asham of myself and so sorri
for my rude last night for which i deepli apologis if you
knew all that i had gone through at the hand of those dread
mendic you would forgiv melr
psi have order breakfast at 10 dont go down much befor
for your own sake
somewhat reliev in my mind for i thought she wa realli angri with
me not altogeth without caus i rose dress and set to work
to write some letter while i wa do so i heard the wheel of a
carriag beneath and open my window saw the atterbysmith famili in
the act of depart in the castl bu smith himself seem to be still
enrag but the other look depress inde i heard the wife of hi
bosom sai to him
calm yourself my dear rememb that provid know what is best for
us and that beggar on horseback ar alwai unjust and ungrat
to which her spous repli
hold your infern tongu will you and then began to rate the
servant about the luggag
well off thei went glare through the door of the bu mr smith
caught sight of me lean out of the window see which i wave my
hand to him in adieu hi onli repli to thi courtesi wa to shake
hi fist though whether at me or at the castl and it inhabit in
gener i neither know nor care
when i wa quit sure that thei had gone and were not come back again
to find someth thei had forgotten i went downstair and surpris a
conclav between the butler moxlei and hi satellit reinforc by
ladi ragnal maid and two other femal servant
gratuiti moxlei wa exclaim which i thought a fine word for
tip not a smell of them hi gratuiti weredamn your ey you
fat bottlewash be hi name for butler my ey mind you ann
not alfr or william and that becaus he had tumbl over hi own
rug gentleman why i name him a hog with hi litter
hog dont have litter mr moxlei observ ann smartli
well young woman if there werent no hog there be no litter
so there howev he wont root about in thi castl no more for
i happen to catch a word or two of what pass between him and her
ladyship last night he said straight out that she wa make love to
that littl mr quatermain who want her monei and probabl not for
the first time as thei had forgath in africa a gentleman mind you
ann who although peculiar i like and who the keeper charl tell
me is the best shot in the whole world
and what did she sai to that ask ann
what did she sai what didnt she sai that the question it wa just
as though all the furnitur in the room got up and went for them smith
well have heard enough and more than i want i step off
with the trai and next minut out thei all come and grab the bedroom
candlestick that all and there her ladyship bell alfr dont
stand gape there but go and light the hotplat
so thei melt awai and i descend from the land indign but
laugh no wonder that ladi ragnal lost her temper
ten minut later she arriv in the diningroom wave a light
ribbon that dissemin perfum
what on earth ar you do i ask
fumig the hous she said it is unnecessari as i dont think
thei were infecti but the ceremoni ha a moral significancelik
incens anywai it reliev my feel
then she laugh and threw the remain of the ribbon into the fire
ad
if you sai a word about those peopl ill leav the room
i think we had on of the jolliest breakfast i ever rememb to begin
with we were both hungri sinc our miseri of the night befor had
prevent us from eat ani dinner inde she swore that she had
scarc tast food sinc saturdai then we had such a lot to talk
about with short interv we talk all that dai either in the hous
or while walk through the garden and ground pass through the
latter i came to the spot on the back drive where onc i had save her
from be abduct by hart and mart and as i recogn it utter
an exclam she ask me why and the end of it wa that i told her
all that stori which to thi moment she had never heard for ragnal had
thought well to keep it from her
she listen intent then said
so i ow you more than i knew yet im not sure for you see i wa
abduct after all also if i had been taken there probabl georg
would never have marri me or seen me again and that might have been
better for him
why i ask you were all the world to him
is ani woman ever all the world to a man mr quatermain
i hesit expect some attack
dont answer she went on it would be too long and you wouldnt
convinc me who have been in the east howev he wa all the world
to me therefor hi welfar wa what i wish and wish and i think he
would have had more of it if he had never marri me
why i ask again
becaus i brought him no good luck did i i neednt go through all
the stori as you know it and in the end it wa through me that he wa
kill in egypt
or through the goddess isi i broke in rather nervous
ye the goddess isi a part i have plai in my time or someth
like it and he wa kill in the templ of the goddess isi and those
papyri of which you read the translat in the museum which were
given to me in kendah land seem to have come from that same templ
andhow about the ivori child isi in the templ evid held a
child in her arm but when we found her it had gone suppos thi
child wa the same as that of which i wa guardian it might have been
sinc the papyri came from that templ what do you think
i dont think anyth i answer except that it is all veri odd i
dont even understand what isi and the child horu repres thei were
not mere imag either in egypt or kendah land there must be an idea
behind them somewher
oh there wa isi wa the univers mother natur herself with all
the power seen and unseen that ar hidden in natur love personifi
also although not actual the queen of love like hathor her sister
goddess the horu child whom the old egyptian call heruhennu
signifi etern regener etern youth etern strength and
beauti also he wa the aveng who overthrew set the princ of
dark and thu in a wai open the door of life to men
it seem to me that all religion have much in common i said
ye a great deal it wa easi for the old egyptian to becom
christian sinc for mani of them it onli meant worship isi and
horu under new and holier name but come in it grow cold

with a groan i rose and open it insid wa anoth box made of
silver thi i open also and perceiv that within lai bundl of
dri leav that look like tobacco from which float an enerv
and wellrememb scent that cloud my brain for a moment then i
shut down the lid and return to my seat

hate and magic herb which i believ grew in the devil garden
moreov ladi ragnal although there ar few thing in the world that
i would refus you i tell you at onc that noth will induc me to
have anyth more to do with it
she laugh softli and ask why not

no wish to make acquaint with ani more such as i am sure lie hid by
the thousand in that box
if so dont you think that thei might clear up some of those which
surround you todai

usual she read my thought and repli to it

musingli or rather why did he eat it after mani refus and learn
the secret of good and evil to the great gain of the world which

of all human progress that allegori mai be read two wai as on of a
rise from ignor instead of a fall from innoc

begin and the same old end becaus you see at last you will do

plead voic if you do i must try alon sinc no on els will

great danger ye i think that i shall lose my mind onc more and never

now dress as quickli as you can or the dinner will be spoil
chapter iv through the gate
short as wa the time at my dispos befor the dinnergong sound
it prove ampl for reflect with everi articl of attir that
i discard went some of that boudoir glamour till it last trace
vanish with my walkingboot i wa fallen inde i who had come to
thi place so full of virtuou resolut could now onli reflect upon
the true and univers mean of our daili prayer that we might be kept
from temptat and yet what had tempt me for my life sake i could
not sai the desir to pleas a most charm woman and to keep her from
make solitari experi of a danger natur i suppos though
whether thei should be less danger carri out jointli remain to
be seen certainli it wa not ani wish to eat of her proffer appl of
knowledg for alreadi i knew a great deal more than i care for about
thing in gener oh the truth wa that woman is the mightiest
forc in the world at ani rate where the major of us poor men is
concern she command and i must obei
i grew desper and wonder if i could escap perhap i might slip
out of the back door and run for it without my great coat or hat
although the night wa so cold and i should probabl be taken up as a
lunat no it wa imposs for i had forg a chain that might not
be broken i had pass my word of honour well i wa in for it and
after all what wa there of which i need be afraid that i should trembl
and shrink back as though i were about to run awai with somebodi wife
or rather to be run awai with quit contrari to my own inclin
noth at all a mere nonsens ordeal much less seriou than a visit
to the dentist
probabl that stuff had lost it strength by nowthat is unless it
had grown more power by keep as is the case with certain sort
of explos and if it had not the worst to be expect wa a silli
dream follow perhap by headach that is unless i did not chanc
to wake up again at all in thi world which wa a most unpleas
possibl anoth thing suppos i woke and she didnt what should
i sai then of a certainti i should find myself in the dock ye and
there were further dread eventu quit conceiv everi on
of them the veri thought of which plung me into a cold perspir
and made me feel so weak that i wa oblig to sit down
then i heard the gong to me it sound like the execut bell to a
prison under sentenc of death i crept downstair feebli and found
ladi ragnal wait for me in the drawingroom cloth with gaieti as
with a garment i rememb that it made me most indign that she could
be so happi in such circumst but i said noth she look me up
and down and remark
realli from your appear you might have seen the ragnal ghost or
be go to be marri against your will ori dont know what also
you have forgotten to fasten your tie
i look in the glass it wa true for there hung the end down my
shirt front then i struggl with the wretch thing until at last she
had to help me which she did laugh softli somehow her touch gave me
confid again and enabl me to sai quit boldli that i onli want
my dinner
ye she repli but you ar not to eat much and you must onli drink
water the priestess in kendah land told me that thi wa necessari
befor take taduki in it strongest form as we ar go to do
tonight you know the prophet hart onli gave us the merest whiff in
thi room year ago
i groan and she laugh again
that dinner with noth to drink although to avoid suspicion i let
moxlei fill my glass onc or twice and littl to eat for my appetit
had vanish went by like a bad dream i recal no more about it until
i heard ladi ragnal tell moxlei to see that there wa a good fire
in the museum where we were go to studi that night and must not be
disturb
anoth minut and i wa automat open the door for her as she
pass she paus to do someth to her dress and whisper
come in a quarter of an hour mindno port which cloud the
intellect
i have none left to cloud i remark after her
then i went back and sat by the fire feel most miser and stare
at the decant for never in my life do i rememb want a bottl
of wine more the big clock tick and tick and at last chime the
quarter jar on my nerv in that great lone banquet hall then
i rose and crept upstair like an evildo and it seem to me that the
servant in the hall look on me with suspicion as well thei might
i reach the museum and found it brilliantli lit but empti except for
the cheer compani of the two mummi who also appear to regard me
with gleam but doubt ey so i sat down there in front of the
fire not even dare to smoke lest tobacco should complic taduki
present i heard a low sound of laughter look up and nearli fell
backward that is metaphor for the chair prevent such a
physic collaps
it wa not wonder sinc befor me like a bride of ancient dai
adorn for her husband stood the goddess isiswhit robe feather
headdress ancient bracelet goldstud sandal on bare feet scent
hair rubi necklac and all the rest i stare then there burst from me
word which were the last i meant to sai
great heaven how beauti you ar
am i she ask i am glad and she glide across the room and
lock the door
now she said return we had better get to busi that is
unless you would like to worship the goddess isi a littl first to
bring yourself into a proper frame of mind you know
no i repli my digniti return to me i do not wish to worship
ani goddess especi when she isnt a goddess it wa not a part of
the bargain
quit so she said nod but who know what you will be
worship befor an hour is over oh forgiv me for laugh at you
but i cant help it you ar so evid frighten
who wouldnt be frighten i answer look with gloomi
apprehens at the sandalwood box which had appear upon a case full
of scarab look here ladi ragnal i ad why cant you leav all
thi unholi busi alon and let us spend a pleasant even talk
now that those smith peopl have gone i have lot of stori about my
african adventur which would interest you
becaus i want to hear my own african adventur and perhap your
too which i am sure will interest me a great deal more she exclaim
earnestli you think it is all foolish but it is not those kendah
priestess told me much when i seem to be out of my mind for a long
time i did not rememb what thei said but of late year especi
sinc georg and i began to excav that templ plenti ha come back
to me bit by bit fragment you know that make me desir to learn the
rest as i never desir anyth els on earth and the worst of it ha
alwai been that from the begin i have knownand knowthat thi
can onli happen with you and through you why i cannot sai or have
forgotten that what sent me nearli wild with joi when i heard that
you were not onli aliv but in thi countri you wont disappoint me
will you there is noth i can offer you which would have ani valu
for you so i can onli beg you not to disappoint mewel becaus i am
your friend
i turn awai my head hesit and when i look up again i saw
that her beauti ey were full of tear natur that settl the
matter so i onli said
let us get on with the affair what am i to do stop a bit i mai as
well provid against eventu and go to a tabl i took a sheet
of notepap and wrote
ladi ragnal and i allan quatermain ar about to make an
experi with an herb which we discov some year ago in
africa if by ani chanc thi should result in accid to either
or both of us the coron is request to understand that it is
not a case of murder or of suicid but mere of unfortun
scientif research
thi i date ad the hour 947 pm and sign request her to
do the same
she obei with a smile sai it wa strang that on who had live a
life of such constant danger as myself should be so afraid to die
look here young ladi i repli with irrit doesnt it occur to
you that i mai be afraid lest you should dieand i be hang for
it i ad by an afterthought
oh i see she answer that is realli veri nice of you but of
cours you would think like that it is your natur
ye i repli natur not merit
she went to a cupboard which form the bottom of on of the mahogani
museum case and extract from it first of all a bowl of ancient
appear made of some black stone with project knob for handl
that were carv with the head of women wear ceremoni wig and
next a low tripod of eboni or some other black wood i look at these
articl and recogn them thei had stood in front of the sanctuari
in the templ in kendah land and over them i had onc seen thi veri
woman dress as she wa tonight bend her head in the magic smoke
befor she had utter the propheci of the pass of the kendah god
so you brought these awai too i said
ye she repli with solemn that thei might be readi at the
appoint hour when we need them
then she spoke no more for a while but busi herself with certain
rather eeri prepar first she set the tripod and it bowl in an
open space which i wa glad to note wa at some distanc from the fire
sinc if either of us fell into that who would there be to take us off
befor cremat ensu then she drew up a curv sette with a back
and arm a comfortablelook articl have a seat that slope
backward like those in club and motion to me to sit down thi i
did with much the same sensat that ar evok by take on place
upon an operationt
next she brought that accurs taduki box i mean the inner silver
on the content of which i heartili wish i had thrown upon the fire
and set it down open near the tripod lastli she lift some glow
ember of wood from the grate with tong and drop them into the
stone bowl
i think that all now for the great adventur she said in a voic
that wa at onc rapt and dreami
what am i to do i ask feebli
that is quit simpl she repli as she sat herself down besid me
well within reach of the taduki box the brazier be between us
with it tripod stand press against the edg of the couch and in
it curv so that we were realli upon each side of it when the smoke
begin to rise thickli you have onli to bend your head a littl forward
with your shoulder still rest against the sette and inhal until
you find your sens leav you though i dont know that thi is
necessari for the stuff is subtl then throw your head back go to
sleep and dream
what am i to dream about i inquir in a vacuou wai for my sens
were leav me alreadi
you will dream i think of past event in which both of us plai a
part at least i hope so i dreamt of them befor in kendah land
but then i wa not myself and for the most part thei ar forgotten
moreov i learn that we can onli see them all when we ar togeth
now speak no more
thi command by the wai at onc produc in me an intens desir for
prolong convers it wa not to be gratifi howev for at that
moment she stood up again face the tripod and me and began to sing in
a rich and thrill voic what she sang i do not know for i could not
understand the languag but i presum it wa some ancient chant that
she learn in kendah land at ani rate there she stood a love and
inspir priestess clad in her sacerdot robe and sang wave her
arm and fix her ey upon mine present she bent down took a
littl of the taduki weed and with word of incant drop it
upon the ember in the bowl twice she did thi then sat herself upon
the couch and wait
a clear flame sprang up and burn for thirti second or so i suppos
while it consum the volatil oil in the weed then it di down and
smoke began to come white rich and billowi with a veri pleasant odour
resembl that of hothous flower it spread out between us like a
fan and though it veil i heard her sai
the gate ar wide enter
i knew what she meant well enough and though for a moment i thought of
cheat there is no other word for it knew also that she had detect
the thought and wa scorn me in her mind at ani rate i felt that i
must obei and thrust my head forward into the smoke as a green ham is
thrust into a chimnei the warm vapour struck against my face like fog
or rather steam but without caus me to choke or my ey to smart i
drew it down my throat with a deep inhalationonc twice thrice then
as my brain began to swim threw myself back as i had been instruct
to do a deep and happi drowsi stole over me and the last thing i
rememb wa hear the clock strike the first two stroke of the hour
of ten the third stroke i heard also but it sound like to that of
the richestthro bell that ever boom in all the world i rememb
becom awar that it wa the signal for the roll up of some vast
proscenium reveal behind it a stage that wa the worldnoth
less
what did i see what did i see let me try to recal and record
first of all someth chaotic great rush of vapour driven by mighti
wind great sea for the most part calm then upheav and volcano
spout fire then tropic scene of infinit luxuri terrif
reptil feed on the brink of marsh and huge elephantlik
anim move between palm beyond then in a glade rough hut and
about them a jabber crowd of creatur that were onli half human for
sometim thei stood upright and sometim ran on their hand and feet
also thei were almost cover with hair which wa all thei had in
the wai of cloth and at the moment that i met them were terribl
frighten by the appear of a huge mammoth if that is the right
name for it which walk into the glade and look at us at ani rate
it wa a beast of the eleph tribe which i judg to be nearli twenti
feet high with enorm curv tusk
the point of the vision wa that i recogn myself among those hairi
jabber not by anyth outward and visibl but by someth inward
and spiritu moreov i wa be urg by a femal of the race i
can scarc call her a woman to justifi my exist by tackl the
mammoth in her particular interest or to give her up to someon who
would in the end i tackl it rush forward with a weapon i think
it wa a sharp stone ti to a stick though how i could expect to
hurt a beast twenti feet high with such a thing is more than i can
understand unless perhap the stone wa poison
at ani rate the end wa sudden i threw the stone whereat a great trunk
shot out from between the tusk and caught me round and round i went
in the air reflect as i did so for i suppos at the time my normal
conscious had not quit left me that thi wa my first encount
with the eleph jana also that it wa veri foolish to try to oblig a
femal regardless of person risk
all becam dark as no doubt it would have done but present that is
after a laps of a great mani thousand of year or so it appear to
me light grew again thi time i wa a black man live in someth
not unlik a kaffir kraal on the top of a hill
there wa shout below and enemi attack us a woman rush out
of a hut and gave me a spear and a shield the latter made of wood with
white spot on it and point to the path of duti which ran down the
hill i follow in compani with other though without enthusiasm and
present met a roar giant of a man at the bottom i stuck my spear
into him and he stuck hi into me through the stomach which hurt me
most abomin after thi i retir up the hill where the woman pull
the spear out and gave it to anoth man i rememb no more
then follow a whole maze of vision but realli i cannot disentangl
them nor is it worth while do so sinc after all thei were onli of
the natur of an overtur jumbl incid of former live real or
imaginari or so i suppos have to do all of them with elementari
thing such as hunger and wound and women and death
at length these broken fragment of the past were swept awai out of my
conscious and i found myself face to face with someth connect
and tangibl not too remot or unfamiliar for understand it wa the
begin of the real stori
i pleas rememb alwai that i knew it wa i allan and no on els
that is the same person or whatev it mai be which make each
man differ from ani other man saw myself in a chariot drawn by two
hors with arch neck and driven by a chariot who sat on a littl
seat in front it wa a highli ornament springless vehicl of wood
and gild someth like a packingcas with a pole or as we
should call it in south africa a disselboom to which the hors were
har in thi cart i stood arrai in flow robe fasten round
my middl by a stud belt with strip of colour cloth wound round
my leg and sandal on my feet to my mind the gener effect of the
attir wa distinctli feminin and i did not like it at all
i wa glad to observ howev that the i of those dai wa anyth
but feminin inde i could never have believ that onc i wa so
goodlook even over two thousand year ago i wa not veri tall but
extrem stalwart burli almost with an arm that as i could observ
sinc it project from the sleev of my ladi gown would have done no
discredit to a prizefight and a chest like a bull
the face also i admir veri much the brow wa broad the black ey
were full and proudlook the featur somewhat massiv but wellcut
and highli intellig the mouth firm and shape with lip that were
perhap a trifl too thick the hairwel there wa rather a failur
in the hair at least accord to modern idea for it curl so
beautifulli as to suggest that on of my ancestor might have fallen
in love with a person of negroid origin howev there wa lot of it
hang down almost to the shoulder and bound about the brow by a veri
neat fillet of blue cloth with silver stud the colour of my skin i
wa glad to note wa by no mean black onli a light and pleas brown
such as might have been produc by sunburn my ag i might add wa
anywher between five and twenti and five and thirti perhap nearer the
latter than the former at ani rate the veri prime of life
for the rest i held in my left hand a veri stout long bow of black
wood which seem to have seen much servic with a string of what
look like catgut on which wa set a broadfeath barb arrow
thi i kept in place with the finger of my right hand on on of which
i observ a handsom gold ring with strang charact carv upon the
bezel
now for the chariot
he wa black as night black as a sundai hat with yellow roll
ey set in a counten of extraordinari ugli and i mai add
extraordinari humour hi big wide mouth with thick lip ran up the
left side of hi face toward an ear that wa also big and project
hi hair that had a feather stuck in it wa real nigger wool cover
a skull like a cannon ball and i should imagin as hard thi head by
the wai wa set plumb upon the shoulder as though it had been driven
down between them by a pile hammer thei were veri broad shoulder
suggest enorm strength but the gailyclad bodi beneath which wa
support by two bow leg and larg flat feet wa that of a dwarf
who by the proport of hi limb natur first intend for a giant
ye an ethiopian dwarf
look through thi remark exterior as it were i recogn
that insid of it wa the soul or anim principl ofwhom do
you think none other than my belov old servant and companion the
hottentot han whose loss i had mourn for year han himself who di
for me slai the great eleph jana in kendah land the eleph
i could not hit and therebi save my life oh although i had been
oblig to go back to the dai of i knew not what ancient empir to
do so in my tranc or whatev it wa i could have wept with joi at
find him again especi as i knew by instinct that as he love
the allan quatermain of todai so he love thi egyptian in a wheel
packingcas for i mai as well sai at onc that such wa my nation
in the dream
now i look about me and perceiv that my chariot wa the second of a
cavalcad immedi in front of it wa on infinit more gorgeou
in which stood a person who even if i had not known it i should have
guess to be a king and who as a matter of fact wa none other than
the king of king at that time the absolut master of most of the known
world though what hi name mai have been i have no notion he wore a
long flow robe of purpl silk embroid with gold and bound in at
the waist by a jewel girdl from which hung the privat sacr
seal the littl white seal that as i learn afterward wa famou
throughout the earth
on hi head wa a stiff cloth cap also purpl in colour round which
wa fasten a fillet of light blue stuff spot with white the best
idea that i can give of it gener appear is to liken it to a tall
hat of fashion shape without a brim slightli squash in so that
it bulg at the top and surround by a rather sport neckti
realli howev it wa the kitari or headdress of these monarch
worn by them alon if anyon els had put on that hat even by mistak
in the dark well hi head would have come off with it that is all
thi king held a bow in hi hand with an arrow set upon it string
just as i did for we were out hunt and as i shall have to narrat
present lion ar no respect of person by hi side lean
against the back of the chariot wa a tall sharppoint wand of cedar
wood with a knob of some green preciou stone probabl an emerald
fashion to the like of an appl thi wa the royal sceptr
immedi behind the chariot walk sever great nobl on of them
carri a golden footstool anoth a parasol furl at the moment
anoth a spare bow and a quiver of arrow and anoth a jewel
flywhisk made of palm fibr
the king i should add wa young handsom with a curl beard and
clearcut highbr look featur hi face howev wa bad cruel
and stamp with an air of weari or rather satieti which wa
emphas by the black circl beneath hi fine dark ey moreov
pride seem to eman from him and yet there wa someth in hi
bear and glanc which suggest fear he wa a god who know that
he is mortal and is therefor afraid lest at ani moment he mai be call
upon to lose hi godship in hi mortal
not that he dread the peril of the chase he wa too much of a man
for that but how could he tell lest among all that crowd of crawl
nobl there wa not on who had a dagger readi for hi back or a
phial of poison to mix with hi wine or water he with all the world
in the hollow of hi hand wa fill with secret terror which as i
learn sinc first i seem to see him thu fulfil themselv at
the appoint time for thi man of blood wa destin to die in blood
though not by murder
the cavalcad halt present a fat eunuch glitter in hi
goldwrought garment like some bronz beetl in the sunlight came
waddl back toward me he wa odiou and i knew that we hate each
other
greet egyptian he said mop hi brow with hi sleev for
the sun wa hot an honour for you a great honour the king of king
command your presenc ye he would speak with you with hi own lip
and with that abort of a servant of your also come come swiftli
swift as an arrow houman i answer laugh see that for three
moon i like an arrow have rest upon the string and flown no nearer
to hi majesti
three moon screech the eunuch why mani wait three year and
mani go to the grave still wait bigger men than you egyptian
though i hear you do claim to be of royal blood yonder on the nile
but talk not of arrow fly toward the most high for sure it is
illomen and might earn you anoth honour that of the string and
he made a motion suggest of a cord encircl hi throat man leav
your bow behind would you appear befor the king arm ye and your
dagger also
perchanc a lion might appear befor the king and he doe not leav
hi claw and teeth behind i answer drili as i divest myself of my
weapon
then we start the three of us leav the chariot in charg of a
soldier
draw your sleev over your hand said the eunuch none must
appear befor the king show hi hand and dwarf sinc you have no
sleev thrust your into your robe
what am i to do with my feet he answer in a thick guttur voic
will it offend the king of king to see my feet most nobl eunuch
certainli certainli answer houman sinc thei ar ugli enough to
offend even me hide them as much as possibl now we ar near down on
your face and crawl forward slowli on your knee and elbow as i do
down i sai
so down i went though with anger in my heart for be it rememb
that i the modern allan quatermain knew everi thought and feel that
pass through the mind of my prototyp
it wa as though i were a spectat at a plai with thi differ i
could read the motiv and reflect of thi former ego as well as
observ hi action also i could rejoic when he rejoic weep when
he wept and gener feel all that he felt though at the same time
i retain the power of studi him from my own modern standpoint and
with my own exist intellig be two we still were on or be
on we still were two whichev wai you like to put it lastli i lack
these power with refer to the other actor in the piec of these
i knew just as much or as littl as my former self knew that is if he
ever realli exist there wa noth unnatur in my faculti where
thei were concern i had no insight into their soul ani more than i
have into those of the peopl about me todai now i hope that i have
made clear my somewhat uncommon posit with refer to these page
from the book of the past
well preced by the eunuch and follow by the dwarf i crawl though
the sand in which grew some thorni plant that prick my knee
and finger toward the person of the monarch of the world he had
descend from hi chariot by help of a footstool and wa engag in
drink from a golden cup while hi attend stood around in variou
attitud of ador he who had hand him the cup be upon hi
knee present he look up and saw us
who ar these he ask in a high voic that yet wa not unmus
and why do you bring them into my presenc
mai it pleas the king answer our guid knock hi head upon the
ground in a veri agoni of humili mai it pleas the king
it would pleas me better dog if you answer my question who ar
thei
mai it pleas the king thi is the egyptian hunter and nobl
shabaka
i hear said hi majesti with a gleam of interest in hi tire ey
and what doe thi egyptian here
mai it pleas the king the king bade me bring him to the presenc but
now when the chariot halt
i forgot you ar forgiven but who is that with him is it a man or an
ap
here i screw my head round and saw that my slave in hi effort to
obei the eunuch instruct and hide hi feet had made himself
into a kind of ball much as a hedgehog doe except that hi big head
appear in front of the ball
o king that i understand is the egyptian servant and chariot
again he look interest and exclaim
is it so then egypt must be a stranger countri than i thought if such
apemen live there stand up egyptian and bid your ap stand up also
for i cannot hear men who speak with their mouth in the dust
so i rose and salut by lift both my hand and bow as i had
observ other do try howev to keep them cover by my sleev

idern the satrap of egypt servant of the king of king sought for
on who would travel to the east becaus the king of king desir to
hear of the hunt of lion in the land that lie to the south of egypt
toward the begin of the great river then i who desir to see
new countri said here am i send me so i came and for three moon

as seen the face of the great king although by mani messeng i have
announc my presenc show them the letter of idern give me
safeconduct therefor i propos tomorrow or the next dai to return to
egypt
the king said a word and a scribe appear whom he command to take
note of my word and let the matter be inquir of sinc some should
suffer for thi neglect a sai at which i saw houman and certain of
the nobl turn pale and whisper to each other
now i rememb he exclaim that i did desir idern to send me an
egyptian hunter well you ar here and we ar about to hunt the lion
of which there ar mani in yonder reed hungri and fierc beast sinc
for three dai thei have been herd in so that thei can kill no food
how mani lion have you slain shabaka
fifti and three in all o king not count the cub
he stare at me answer with a sneer
you egyptian have larg mouth i have alwai heard it of you well
todai we will see whether you can kill a fiftyfourth in an hour when
the sun begin to sink the hound will be loos in yonder reed and
sinc the water is behind them the lion will come out and then we
shall see
now i saw that the king thought me to be a liar and the blood rose to my
head
why wait till the sun begin to sink o king of king i said why
not enter the reed as is our fashion in the land of kush and rous
the lion from sleep in their own lair
now the king laugh outright and call in a loud voic to hi
courtier
do ye hear thi boast egyptian who talk of enter the reed and
face the lion in their lair a thing that no man dare do where none
can see to shoot what sai ye now shall we ask him to prove hi word
some great lord step forward on who wa a hunter though he look
littl like it for the scent on hi hair reach me from four pace
awai and there wa paint upon hi face
ye o king he said in a minc voic let him enter and kill a
lion but if he fail then let a lion kill him there ar some hungri in
the palac den and it is not fit that the king ear should be fill
with empti word by foreign from egypt
so be it said the king egyptian you have brought it on your own
head prove that you can do what you sai and i will give you great
honour fail and to the lion with him who li of lion still he
ad it is not right that you should go alon choos therefor on
of these lord to keep you compani he who would put you to the test if
you will
now i look at the scent nobl who turn pale beneath hi paint
then i look at the fat eunuch houman who open hi mouth and gasp
like a fish and when i had look i shook my head and said as though
to myself
not so no woman and no eunuch shall be my companion on thi quest
whereat the king and all the rest laugh out loud the dwarf and i
will go alon
the dwarf said the king can he hunt lion also
no o king but perchanc he can smell them for otherwis how shall i
find them in that thicket within an hour
perchanc thei can smell him how is the apeman name ask the
king
be o king after the god of the egyptian whom he resembl
dare you accompani your master on thi hunt o be inquir the king
then be look up roll hi yellow ey and answer in hi thick
and guttur voic
i am my master slave and dare i refus to accompani him if i did he
might kill me as the king of king kill hi slave it is better to
die with honour by the teeth of a lion than with dishonour beneath the
whip of a master so at least we think in ethiopia
well spoken dwarf be exclaim the king so would i have all men
think throughout the east let the word of thi ethiop be written down
and copi of them sent to the satrap of all the provinc that thei
mai be read to the peopl of the earth i the king have decre it
chapter v the wager
while the scribe were at their work i bow befor the king and prai
hi leav and i and the dwarf be might get to our
go he said and return here within an hour if you do not return
tide of your death shall be sent to the satrap of egypt to be told to
your wive
i thank the king but it is needless for i have no wive which ar
ill compani for a hunter
strang he said sinc mani women would be glad to name such a man
their husband at least here among us eastern
walk backward and bow as we went be and i return to our
chariot there we strip off our outer garment till be wa nake
save for hi waistcloth and i wa clad onli in a jerkin then i took
my bow my arrow and my knife and be took two spear on light for
throw and the other short broad and heavi for stab thu arm
we pass back befor the eastern who stare at us and advanc to the
edg of the thicket of tall reed that wa full of lion
here be took dust and threw it into the air that we might learn from
which quarter the light wind blew
we will go against the breez lord he said that i mai smell the
lion befor thei smell us
i nod and answer
hearken be well mai it be that we kill no lion in thi place where
it is hard to shoot yet i would not return to be thrown to wild beast
by yonder evil king therefor if we fail in thi or in ani other wai
do you kill me if you still live
he roll hi ey and grin
not so master then we will win through the reed and lie hid in their
edg till dark come for in them those halfmen will never dare to
seek for us afterward we will swim the water and disguis ourselv
as juggler and try to reach the coast and so back to egypt have
learn much never stretch out your hand to death till he stretch out
hi to you which he will do soon enough master
again i nod and said
and if a lion should kill me be what then
then master i will kill that lion if i can and go report the matter
to the king
and if he should wish to throw you to the beast be what then
then first i will drag him down to the greatest of all beast he who
wait to devour evildo in the underworld be thei king or slave
and he stretch out hi long arm and made a motion as of clutch
a man by the throat oh have no fear master i can break him like a
stick and afterward we will talk the matter over among the dead for i
shall swallow my tongu and die also it is a good trick master which
i wish you would learn
then he took my hand and kiss it and we enter the reed i who wa
a hunter feel more happi than i had done sinc we set foot in the
east
yet the quest wa desper for the reed were tall and often i could
not see more than a bow length in front of me present howev
we found a path made perchanc by game come down to drink or by
crocodil come up to sleep and follow it i with an arrow on
my string and be with the throw spear in hi right hand and the
stab spear in hi left half a pace ahead of me on we crept be
draw in the air through hi great nostril as a hound might do till
suddenli he stop and snif toward the north
i smell lion near he whisper search among the reed stem with
hi ey i see lion he whisper again and point but i could see
noth save the stem of the reed
rous him i whisper back and i will shoot as he bound
then be pois the spear shook it till it quiver and threw there
wa a roar and a lioness appear with the spear fast in her flank i
loos the arrow but it cut into the thick reed and stuck there
forward whisper be for where woman is there look for man the
lion will be near
we crept on be stop to cut the arrow from a reed and set it back
in the quiver for it wa a good arrow made by himself but now he
shift the broad spear to hi right hand and in hi left held hi
knife we heard the wound lioness roar not far awai
she call her man to help her whisper be and as the word left
hi lip the reed down wind began to swai for we were smelt
thei swai thei part and half seen half hid between their stem
appear the head of a great blackman lion i drew the string and
shot thi time not in vain for i heard the arrow thud upon hi hide
then befor i could set anoth he wa on us rear upon hi hind leg
and roar as i drew my dagger he struck at me but i bent down and
hi paw went over my head then hi weight came against me and i fell
beneath him stab him in the belli as i fell i saw hi mighti jaw
open to crush my head then thei shut again and through them burst a
whine like that of a hurt dog
be had driven hi spear into the lion breast so deep that the point
of it came out through the back still he wa not dead onli now it wa
be he sought the dwarf ran at him as he rear up again and cast
hi great arm about the brute bodi wrestl with him as man with
man
then it wa for the first time i think that i learn all the
ethiopian strength for he a dwarf threw that lion on it back and
thrust hi big head beneath the jaw struggl with it madli i
wa up the knife still in my hand and oh i too wa strong into
the throat i drove it drag it thi wai and that and lo the lion
moan and di and hi blood gush out over both of us then be sat
up and laugh and i too laugh sinc neither of us had more than
scratch and we had done what men could scarc do
do you rememb master said be when he had finish laugh as he
wipe hi brow with some damp moss how onc far awai up the nile you
charg a mad eleph with a spear and save me who had fallen from
be trampl to death
i shabaka answer that i did and i allan quatermain observ
all these thing in my psychic tranc in the museum of ragnal castl
reflect that i also rememb how a certain han had save me from a
certain mad eleph to wit jana not so long befor which just show
how thing come round
ye went on be you save me from that eleph though it seem
death to you and master i will tell you someth now that veri
morn i had tri to poison you onli you would not wait to eat
becaus the eleph were near
did you i ask idli why
becaus two year befor you captur me in battl with some of my
peopl and as i wa misshapen or for piti sake spare my life and
made me your slave well i who had been a chief a veri great chief
master did not wish to remain a slave and did wish to aveng my
peopl blood therefor i tri to poison you and that veri dai you
save my life offer for it your own
i think it wa becaus i want the tusk of the eleph be
perhap master onli you will rememb that thi eleph wa a young
cow and had no tusk worth anyth still had it carri tusk it
might have been so sinc on white tusk is worth mani black dwarf
well todai i have paid you back i sai it lest you should forget that
had it not been for me that lion would have eaten you
ye be you have paid me back and i thank you
master hitherto i alwai thought you on who worship maat goddess
of truth now i see that you worship the god of li whoever he mai
be that god who dwell in the breast of women and most men but ha no
name for master it wa you who save me from the lion and not i
you sinc you cut it throat at the last so that debt of mine is still
to pai and by the great grasshopp which we worship in my countri who
is much better than all the god of the egyptian put togeth i swear
that i will pai it soon or mayhap ten thousand year henc at the last
it shall be paid
why do you worship a grasshopp and why is he better than the god of
the egyptian i ask carelessli for i wa tire and hi talk amus
me while we rest
we worship the grasshopp master becaus he jump with men spirit
from on life to anoth or from thi world to the next ye right
through the blue sky and he is better than your egyptian god becaus
thei leav you to find your own wai there and then eat you aliv that
is if you have tri to poison peopl as of cours we have all done
but master we ar fresh again now so let us be go for the hour
will soon be finish also when she ha eaten the spear handl that
lioness mai return
ye i said let us go and report to the king of king that we have
kill a lion
master it is not enough even common king believ littl that thei
do not see wherefor it is certain that a king of king will believ
noth and still more certain that he will not come here to look so as
we cannot carri the lion we must take a bit of it and straightwai he
cut off the end of the brute tail
follow the crocodil path present we reach the edg of the reed
opposit to the camp where the king now sat in state beneath a purpl
pavilion that had been rear eat a meal with hi courtier
stand at a distanc and look veri hungri
out of the reed bound be nake and bloodi wave the lion tail
and sing some wild ethiopian chant while i also bloodi and half
nake for the lion claw had torn my jerkin off me follow with bow
unstrung
the king look up and saw us
what do you live egyptian he ask of a sureti i thought that by
now you would be dead
it wa the lion that di o king i answer point to be who
have ceas from hi song wa jump about carri the beast tail
in hi mouth as a dog carri a bone
it seem that thi egyptian ha kill a lion said the king to on of
hi lord him of the paint face and scent hair
mai be pleas the king he answer bow a tail is not the whole
beast and mai have been taken thither or cut from a lion ly dead
alreadi the king know that the egyptian ar great liar
so he spoke becaus he wa jealou of the deed
these men look as though thei had met a live on not on that is
dead said the king scan our bloodstain shape still as
you doubt it you will wish to put the matter to the proof therefor
cousin take six men with you enter the reed and search in that soft
ground it will be easi to follow their footmark
it is danger o king began the princ for such he wa no less
and therefor the task will be the more to your tast cousin go now
and be swift
so six hunter were call and the princ went curs me beneath hi
breath as he pass us for he wa terribl afraid and with reason
suddenli be ceas from hi antic and prostrat himself cri
a boon o king thi nobl lord throw doubt upon my master word
suffer that i mai lead him to where the lion li dead sinc otherwis
wander in those reed the great king cousin might come to harm and
the great king be griev
i have mani cousin said the king still go if you wish dwarf
so be ran after the princ and catch him up tap him on the
shoulder with the lion tail to point out the wai then thei vanish
into the reed and i went to the chariot to wash off the blood from my
bodi and cloth as i fasten my robe i heard a sound of roar then
on scream after which all grew still now i drew near to the reed and
stood between them and the king camp
present on their edg appear be danc and sing as befor but
thi time he held a lion tail in either hand after him came the six
hunter drag between them the bodi of the lion we had kill thei
stagger with it toward the king and i follow
i see the dwarf he said i see the dead lion and i see the hunter
but where is my cousin make report o be
o king of king repli be the mighti princ your cousin li flat
yonder beneath the bodi of that lion wife she sprang upon him and
kill him and i sprang upon her and kill her with my spear here is
her tail o king of king
is thi true he ask of the hunter
it is true o king answer their captain the lioness which wa
wound leapt upon the princ choos him although he wa behind us
all then thi dwarf leapt upon the lioness be behind the princ and
nearest to him and drove hi spear through her shoulder to her heart
so we brought the first lion as the king command us sinc we could
carri no more
the face of the king grew red with rage
seven of my peopl and on black dwarf he exclaim yet the lioness
kill my cousin and the dwarf kill the lioness such is the tale that
will go to egypt concern the hunter of the king of the world seiz
those men guard and let them be fed to the wild beast in the palac
den
at onc the unfortun were seiz and led awai then the king call
be to him and take the gold chain he wore about hi neck threw
it over hi head therebi though i knew noth of it at the time
confer upon him some nobl rank next he call to me and said
it would seem that you ar skill in the us of the bow and in the
hunt of lion egyptian therefor i will honour you for thi
afternoon your chariot shall drive with my chariot and we will hunt
side by side moreov i will lai you a wager as to which of us will
kill the most lion for know shabaka that i also am skill in
the us of the bow more skill than ani among the million of my
subject
then o king it is of littl us for me to match myself against you
see that i have met men who can shoot better than i do or sinc in
the east all must speak noth but the truth not be liar as the
dead princ said we egyptian ar on man
who wa that man shabaka
the princ peroa o king
the king frown as though the name displeas him then answer
am i not greater than thi peroa and cannot i therefor shoot better
doubtless o king of king and therefor how can i who shoot wors
than peroa match myself against you
for which reason i will give you odd shabaka behold thi rope of
rosehu pearl i wear thei ar unequal in the whole world for
twenti year the merchant sought them in the dai of my father half
of them would bui a satrapi i wager themher the listen nobl
gasp and the fat eunuch houman held up hi hand in horror
against what o king
your slave be to whom i have taken a fanci
now i trembl and be roll hi yellow ey
your pardon o king of king i said but it is not enough i am a
hunter and to such priceless pearl ar of littl us but to me that
dwarf is of much us in my hunt
so be it shabaka then i will add to the wager if you win togeth
with the pearl i will give you the dwarf weight in solid gold
the king is bounti i answer but it is not enough for even if
i win against on who can shoot better than peroa which is imposs
what should i do with so much gold sure for the sake of it i should
be murder or ever i saw the coast of egypt
what shall i add then ask the king the most beauteou maiden in
the hous of women
i shook my head not so o king for then i must marri who would remain
singl
there is no need you might sell her to your friend peroa a satrapi
not so o king for then i must govern it which would keep me from my
hunt until it pleas the king to take my head
by the name of the holi on i worship what then do you ask ad to
the pearl and the pure gold
now i tri to bethink me of someth that the king could not grant
sinc i had no wish for thi match which my heart warn me would end
in troubl as no thought came to me i look at be and saw that he wa
roll hi ey toward the six doom hunter who were be led awai
also in pretenc of drive off a fly point to them with on of the
lion tail then i rememb that a decre onc utter by the king of
the east could not be alter and saw a road of escap
o king i said togeth with the pearl and the gold i ask that the
live of those six hunter be ad to the wager to be spare if by
chanc i should win
why ask the king amaz
becaus thei ar brave men o king and i would not see the bone of
such crack by tame beast in a cage
is my judgment regist ask the king
not yet o king answer the head scribe
then it ha no weight and can be suspend without the break of the
law shabaka thu stand our wager if i kill more lion than you do
thi dai or should but two be slain i kill the first or should none
be slain i plant more arrow in their bodi i take your slave be
the dwarf to be my slave but should you have the better of me in ani
of these wai then i give to you thi girdl of rose pearl and the
weight of the dwarf be in gold and the six hunter free of harm to do
with what you will let it be record and to the hunt
soon be and i were in our chariot which by command took place in line
with that of the king but at a distanc of some thirti step bend
over the dwarf who drove i spoke with him sai
our luck is ill todai be see that befor the end of it we mai
well be part
not so master our luck is good todai see that befor the end of
it you will be the richer by the finest pearl in the whole world by my
weight in pure gold and master i am twice as heavi as the king thought
and will stuff myself with twenti pound of meat befor the weigh if
i have the chanc or at least with water though in thi hot place that
will not last for long and by six pick huntsmen brave men as you
thought who will serv to escort us and our treasur to the coast
first i must win the match be
which you could do with on ey blind master and a sore finger
king think that thei can shoot becaus all the worm that crawl about
them and ar name men dare not show themselv their better oh i
have heard tale in yonder citi there have been dai when thi lord
of the world ha miss six lion with as mani arrow and thei seat
smile in hi face be but tame brute brought from far in cage of
wood ye smile like cat in the sun look you master he drink
too much wine and sit up too late in hi women housether ar three
hundr of them there masterto shoot as you and i can if you doubt
it look at hi ey and hand oh the pearl and the gold and the men
ar your and that paint princ who mock us is where he ought to
bedead in the mud
did i tell you how i manag that master as you know better than i
do lion hate those that have on them the smell of their own blood
therefor while i point out the wai to him i touch the paint
princ with the bleed tail of that which we kill pretend that
it wa by chanc for which he curs me as well he might so when we
came to the dead lion and as i had expect met there the lioness you
had wound she charg through the hunter at him who smelt of her
husband and bit hi head off
but be you smelt of him also and wors
ye master but that paint cousin of the king came first i kept
well behind him pretend to be afraid and he chuckl quietli
ad i expect that he is now tell an angri tale about me to
osiri or to the grasshopp that take him there as it mai happen
these eastern worship neither osiri nor your grasshopp be but a
flame of fire
then he is tell the tale to the fire and i hope that it will get
tire and burn him
so we talk merrili enough becaus we had done great deed and thought
that we had outwit the eastern and the king not know all their
craft for none had told us that that man who hunt with the king and
yet dare to draw arrow upon the quarri befor the king should be put
to death as on who had done insult to hi majesti thi that royal fox
rememb and therefor wa sure that he would win the wager
now the chariot turn and pass down a path came to an open space
that wa clear of reed here thei halt that of the king and my own
side by side with ten pace between them and those of the court behind
meanwhil huntsmen with dog enter the great brake far awai to the
right and left of us also in front so that the lion might be driven
backward and forward across the open space
soon we heard the hound bai on all side then be made a suck
nois with hi great lip and point to the edg of the reed in front
of us some sixti pace awai look i saw a yellow shape creep
along between their dark stem and although the shot wa far
forget all thing save i wa a hunter and there wa my game i drew
the arrow to my ear aim and loos make allow for it fall and
for the wind
oh that shot wa good it struck the lion in the bodi and pierc him
through out he came roar roll and tear at the ground but
by now i had anoth arrow on the string and although the king lift
hi bow i loos first again it struck thi time in the throat and
that lion groan and di
the king look at me angrili and from the court behind rose a murmur
of wonder mingl with wrath wonder at my marksmanship and wrath
becaus i had dare to shoot befor the king
the wager look well for us mutter be but i bade him be silent
for more lion were stir
now on leapt across the open space pass in front of the king and
within thirti pace of us he shot and miss it send hi shaft two
span abov it back then i shot and drove the arrow through it just
where the head join the neck cut the spine so that it di at
onc
again that murmur went up and the king struck the chariot on the head
with hi clench fist cry out that he had suffer the hors to
move and should be scourg for caus hi hand to shake
thi chariot although he wa a lordsinc in the east men of high
rank wait on the king like slave and even clip hi nail and
beardcrav pardon humbl admit hi fault
it is a lie whisper be the hors never stir how could thei
with those groom hold their head nevertheless master the pearl
ar as good as round your neck
silenc i answer as we have heard in the east all men speak the
truth it is onli egyptian who lie also in the east men neck ar
encircl with bowstr as well as pearl and ear ar long
the hound continu to bai draw nearer to us a lioness bound out
of the reed ran toward the king chariot and as though amaz sat
down like a dog so near that a man might have hit it with a stone the
king shot short strike it in the forepaw onli whereon it shook out
the arrow and rush back into the reed while the court behind cri
mai the king live for ever the beast is dead
we shall see if it is dead present said be and i nod
anoth lion appear to the right of the king again he shot and miss
it whereon he began to curs and to swear in hi own royal oath and
the chariot trembl then came the end
on of the hound drew quit close and rous the lioness that had been
prick in the foot she turn and kill it with a blow of her paw
then be mad charg straight at the king chariot the hors
rear lift the groom off their feet the king shot wildli and fell
backward out of the chariot as even king of the world must do when
thei have noth left to stand on the lioness saw that he wa down and
leapt at him straight over the chariot as she leapt i shot at her
in the air and pierc her through the loin paralys her so that
although she fell down near the king she could not come at him to kill
him
i sprang from my chariot but befor i could reach the lioness hunter
had run up with spear and stab her which wa easi as she could not
move
the king rose from the ground for he wa unharm and said in a loud
voic
had not that shaft of mine gone home i think that the east would have
bow to anoth lord tonight
now forget that i wa speak to the king of the earth forget
the wager and all besid i exclaim
nai your shaft miss mine went home whereon on of the courtier
cri
thi egyptian is a liar and call the king on
a liar i said astonish look at the arrow and see from whose
quiver it came and i drew on from my own of the egyptian make and
mark with my mark
then a tumult broke out all the courtier and eunuch talk at onc
yet all bow to the mudstain person of the king like ear of wheat
to a tree in a storm not wish to urg my claim further for my part
i return to the chariot and the hunt be done as i suppos
unstrung my bow which i prize abov all thing and set it in it case
while i wa thu emploi the eunuch houman approach me with a sickli
smile sai
the king command your presenc egyptian that you mai receiv your
reward
i nod sai that i would come and he return
be i said when he wa out of hear my heart sink i do not
trust that king who i think mean mischief
so do i master oh we have been great fool when a god and a man
climb a tree togeth the man should allow the god to come first to the
top and thenc tell the world that he is a god
ye i answer but who ever see wisdom until she is fly awai
now perhap the god be the stronger will cast down the man
then both togeth we advanc toward the king leav the chariot in
charg of soldier he wa seat on a gild chair which serv him
as a throne and behind him were hi offic eunuch and attend
though not all of them sinc at a littl distanc some of them were
engag in beat the lord who had serv as hi chariot upon the
feet with rod we prostrat ourselv befor him and wait till he
spoke at length he said
shabaka the egyptian we made a wager with you of which you will
rememb the term it seem that you have won the wager sinc you slew
two lion wherea we the king slew but on that which leapt upon us
in the chariot
here be groan at my side and i look up
fear noth he went on it shall be paid here he snatch off the
girdl of priceless rosehu pearl and threw it in my face
at the palac too he went on the dwarf shall be set in the scale
and hi full weight in pure gold shall be given to you moreov the
live of the six hunter ar your and with them the men themselv
mai the king live for ever i exclaim feel that i must sai
someth
i hope so he answer cruelli but egyptian you shall not who
have broken the law of the land
in what wai o king i ask
by shoot at the lion befor the king had time to draw hi bow and
by tell the king that he li to hi face for both of which thing
the punish is death
now my heart swell till i thought it would burst with rage then of a
sudden a certain spirit enter into me and i rose to my feet and said
o king you have declar that i must die and as thi is so i will
kneel to you no more who soon shall sup at the tabl of osiri and
there be far greater than ani king go befor him with clean hand
is it not your law that he who is condemn to die ha first the right
to set out hi case for the honour of hi name
it is said the king i think becaus he wa curiou to hear what i
had to sai speak on
o king although my blood is as high as your own of that i sai
noth for at the wish of your satrap i came to the east from egypt as
a hunter to show you how we of egypt kill lion and other beast for
three month i have wait in the royal citi seek admiss to the
presenc of the king and in vain at length i wa bidden to thi hunt
when i wa about to depart to my own land and be taunt by your
servant enter the reed with my slave and there slew a lion then
it pleas you to thrust a wager upon me which i did not wish to
take as to which of us would shoot the most lion a wager as i now
understand you did not mean that i should win whatev might be my
skill sinc you thought i knew that i must shoot at noth till you
had first shot and kill the beast or scare them awai
so i match myself against you as hunter against hunter for in the
field as befor the god all ar equal not as a slave against a king
who is determin to aveng defeat by death we were post and the
lion came i shot at those which appear opposit to me or upon
my side leav those that appear opposit to you or on your side
unshot at as is the custom of hunter my skill or my fortun wa
better than your and i kill wherea you miss or onli wound in
the end a lioness sprang at you and i shot it lest it should kill you
as could easili be prove by the arrow in it bodi now you sai that i
must die becaus i have broken some law of your which men should
be asham to make and to save your honour pai me what i have won
know that pearl and gold and slave ar of no valu to a dy man
and can be taken back again that is all the stori
yet i would add on word you eastern have two sai which you teach
to your children that thei should learn to shoot with the bow and to
tell the truth o king thei ar my last lesson to you learn to shoot
with the bowwhich you cannot do and to tell the truth which you have
not done now i have spoken and am readi to die and i thank you for
the patienc with which you have heard my word that as the king doe
not live for ever i hope on dai to repeat to you more fulli beyond
the grave
now at thi bold speech of mine all those nobl and attend gasp
for never had thei heard such word address to hi majesti the king
turn red as though with shame but made no answer onli he ask of
those about him
what fate for thi man

what death he ask again
then hi councillor consult togeth and on of them answer
the slowest known to our law death by the boat
hear thi and not know what wa meant it came into my mind that i
wa to be turn adrift in a boat and there left to starv
behold the reward of good hunt i mock in my rage o king
becaus of thi deed of shame i call upon you the curs of all the god
of all the peopl henceforth mai your sleep be ever haunt by evil
dream of what shall follow the last sleep and in the end mai you also
die in blood
the king open hi mouth as though to answer but from it came noth
but a low cry of fear then guard rush up and seiz me
chapter vi the doom of the boat
the guard led me to my chariot and thrust me into it and with me be
i ask them if thei would murder him also to which the eunuch houman
answer no sinc he had commit no crime but that he must go with
me to be weigh then soldier took the hors by the bridl and led
them while other have first snatch awai my bow and all our other
weapon surround the chariot lest we should escap so be and i were
abl to talk togeth in a libyan tongu that none of them understood
even if thei heard our word
your life is spare i said to him that the king mai take you as a
slave
then he will take an ill slave master sinc i swear by the
grasshopp that within a moon i will find mean to kill him and
afterward come to join you in a land where men hunt fair
i smile and be went on
now i wish i had time to teach you that trick of swallow your own
tongu sinc perhap you will need it in thi boat of which thei talk
did you not sai to me an hour or two ago be that we ar fool to
stretch out our hand to death until he stretch out hi to us i will
not die until i mustnow
why now master see that onli thi afternoon you bade me kill you
rather than let you be thrown to the wild beast he ask peer at
me curious
do you rememb the old hermit the holi tanofir who dwell in a cell
over the sepulchr of the api bull in the burial ground of the desert
near to memphi be
the magician and prophet who is the brother of your grandfath
master and the son of a king he who brought you up befor he becam a
hermit ye i know him well though i have seldom been veri near to him
becaus hi ey frighten me as thei frighten cambys the persian
when tanofir curs him and foretold hi doom after he had stab the
holi api sai that by a wound from that same sword in hi own bodi
he should die himself which thing came to pass as thei have frighten
mani anoth man also
well be when yonder king told me that i must die fear fill me
who did not wish to die thu and after the fear came a black in my
mind then of a sudden in that black i saw a pictur of tanofir my
great uncl seat in a sepulchr look toward the east moreov
i heard him speak and to me sai shabaka my fosterson fear
noth you ar in great danger but it will pass speak to the great
king all that rise in your heart for the god of vengeanc make us of
your tongu and whatev you prophesi to him shall be fulfil so i
spoke the word you heard and i fear noth
is it so master then i think that the holi tanofir must have enter
my heart also know that i wa mind to leap upon that king and break
hi neck so that all three of us might end togeth but of a sudden
someth seem to tell me to leav him alon and let thing go as thei
ar fate but how can the holi tanofir who grow blind with ag see so
far
i do not know be save that he is not as ar other men for in him
is gather all the ancient wisdom of egypt moreov he live with the
god while still upon earth and like the god can send hi ka as we
egyptian call the spirit or invis self which companion all from
the cradl to the grave and afterward whither he will so doubtless
todai he sent it hither to me whom he love more than anyth on
earth also i rememb that befor i enter on thi journei he told
me that i should return safe and sound therefor be i sai i fear
noth
nor do i master yet if you see me do strang thing or hear me speak
strang word take no note of them sinc i shall be but plai a part
as i think wisest
after thi we talk of that dai adventur with the lion and of
other that we had share togeth laugh merrili all the while till
the soldier stare at us as though we were mad also the fat eunuch
houman who wa mount on an ass rode up and said
what egyptian who dare to twist the beard of the great king you
laugh do you well you will sing a differ song in the boat to that
which you sing in the chariot think of my word on the eighth dai from
thi
i will think of them eunuch i answer look at him fierc in
the ey but who know what kind of a song you will be sing befor
the eighth dai from thi
what i do is done under the author of the ancient and holi seal of
seal he answer in a quaver voic touch the littl cylind
of white shell which i had note upon the person of the king but that
now hung from a gold chain about the eunuch neck
then he made the sign which eastern us to avert evil and rode off
again look veri frighten
so we came to the royal citi and went up to a wonder palac here we
were taken from the chariot and led into a room where food and drink in
plenti were given to me as though i were an honour guest which caus
me to wonder be also seat on the ground at a distanc at and
drank for hi own reason fill himself to the throat as though he
were a wineskin until the serv slave mock at him for a glutton
when we had finish eat slave appear bear a wooden framework
from which hung a great pair of scale also there appear offic of
the king treasuri carri leather bag which thei open break
the seal to show that the content were pure gold coin thei set a
number of these bag on on of the scale and then order be to seat
himself in the other so much heavier did he prove than thei expect
him to be that thei were oblig to send back to the treasuri to fetch
more bag of gold for although be wa so short in height hi weight
wa that of a larg man on of the treasur grumbl sai he
should have been weigh befor he had eaten and drunk but the offic
to whom he spoke grin and answer that it matter littl sinc the
king wa heir to crimin and that these bag would soon return to
the treasuri onli thei would need wash first a remark that made me
wonder
at length when the scale were even the six hunter whose live i had
won and who had been given to me as slave were brought in and order
to shoulder the bag of gold i too wa seiz and my hand were bound
behind me then i wa led out in charg of the eunuch houman who
inform me with a leer that it would be hi duti to attend to my
comfort till the end with him were four black men all dress in the
same wai these he said were the execution lastli came be watch
by three of the king guard arm with spear lest he should attempt
to rescu me or to do anyon a mischief
now my heart began to sink and i ask houman what wa to happen to me
thi o egyptian slayer of lion you will be laid upon a bed in a
littl boat upon the river and anoth boat will be place over you for
these boat ar call the twin egyptian in such a fashion that your
head and your hand will project at on end and your feet at the other
there you will be left comfort as a babi in it cradl and twice
everi dai the best of food and drink will be brought to you should your
appetit fail moreov it will be my duti to reviv it by prick
your ey with the point of a knife until it return also after each
meal i shall wash your face your hand and your feet with milk and
honei lest the fli that buzz about them should suffer hunger and to
preserv your skin from burn by the sun thu slowli you will
grow weaker and at length fall asleep the last on who went into the
boath unlucki man had by accid wander into the court of the
hous of women and seen some of the ladi there unveiledonli
live for twelv dai but you be so strong mai hope to last for
eighteen is there anyth more that i can tell you if so ask it
quickli for we draw near to the river
now when i heard thi and understood all the horror of my fate i forgot
the vision of my great uncl the holi tanofir and hi comfort
propheci and my heart fail me altogeth so that i stood stock
still
what lionhunt and bearder of king do you think it is too earli to
go to bed mock thi devilish eunuch on with you and he began to
beat me about the face with the handl of hi flywhisk
then my manhood came back to me
when did the king tell you to touch me you fat swine i roar
and turn sinc i could not reach him with my bound hand kick
him in the bodi with all my strength so that he fell down writh and
scream with agoni inde had not the execution leapt upon me i
would have trampl the life out of him where he lai but thei held me
fast and present after he had been sick houman recov enough to
come forward lean on the shoulder of two guard onli now he mock
me no more
we reach a quai just as the sun wa set there in charg of a
oneei black slave a littl squareend boat float at the river
edg while on the quai itself lai a similar but somewhat shorter boat
bottom uppermost now the hunter whom i had won in the wager with mani
glanc of compass for thei were brave men and knew that it wa i
who had save their live place the bag of gold in the bottom of the
float boat and on the top of these a mattress stuf with straw
then the girdl of rosehu pearl wa made fast about my middl my
hand were unti i wa seiz by the execution and laid on my back
on the mattress and my wrist and ankl were fix by cord to iron
ring that were screw to the thwart of the boat after thi the
other shorter boat wa laid over me in such a manner that it did not
touch me leav my head my hand and my feet expos as the eunuch
had said
while thi wick work wa go forward be sat on the quai watch
till present after i had been made fast and cover up he burst into
shout of laughter clap hi hand and began to danc about as though
with joi till the eunuch who had now recov somewhat from my kick
grew curiou and ask him why he behav thu
o nobl eunuch he answer onc i wa free and that man made me a
slave so that for mani year i have been oblig to toil for him whom i
hate moreov often he ha beaten me and starv me which wa why you
saw me eat so much not long ago and threaten to kill me and now at
last i have my reveng upon him who is about to die miser that is
why i laugh and sing and danc and clap my hand o most nobl eunuch
i who shall becom the follow and servant of the gloriou king of
all the earth and perhap your friend too o eunuch of eunuch whose
sacr person my brutal master dare to kick
i understand said houman smile though with a twist face and
will make report of all you sai to the king and ask him to grant that
you shall sometim prick thi egyptian in the ey now go spit in hi
face and tell him what you think of him
so be wade into the water which wa quit shallow here and spat into
my face or pretend to while amid a torrent of vile languag he
interpol certain word in the libyan tongu which meant
o my most belov father mother and other rel have no fear
though thing look veri black rememb the vision of the holi tanofir
who doubtless allow these thing to happen to you to try your faith by
direct order of the god be sure that i will not leav you to perish
or if there should be no escap that i will find a wai to put you out
of your miseri and to aveng you ye ye i will yet see that accurs
swine houman take your place in thi boat now i go to the court to
which it seem that thi gold chain give me a right of entri or so the
eunuch sai but soon i will be back again
then follow anoth stream or most horribl abus and more spit
after which he wade back to land and embrac houman call him hi
best friend
thei went leav me alon in the boat save for the guard upon the quai
who now that dark had come soon grew silent it wa lone veri
lone ly there stare at the empti sky with onli the sting
gnat for compani and soon my limb began to ach i thought of the
poor wretch who had suffer in thi same boat and wonder if their
lot would be my lot
be wa faith and clever but what could a singl dwarf do among all
these blackheart fiend and if he could do noth oh if he could
do noth
the second seem minut the minut seem hour and the hour
seem year what then would the dai be pass in tortur and
agoni while wait for a filthi death where now were the god i had
worship andwa there ani god or wa man but a selfdeceiv who
creat god instead of the god creat him becaus he did not love
to think of an etern black in which he would soon be swallow up
and lost well at least that would mean sleep and sleep is better than
torment of mind or bodi
it came to me i think who wa so weari at ani rate i open my ey
to see that the low moon had vanish and that some of the star which
i knew as a hunter who had often steer hi wai by them had move a
littl while i wa wonder idli why thei move i heard the tramp of
soldier on the quai and the voic of an offic give a command then
i felt the boat be drawn in by the cord with which it wa attach to
the quai next the other boat that lai over me wa lift off the rope
that bound we were undon and i wa set upon my feet for alreadi i wa
so stiff that i could scarc stand a voic which i recognis as that
of the eunuch houman address me in respect tone which made me
think i must be dream
nobl shabaka said the voic the great king command your presenc
at hi feast
is it so i answer in my dream then my absenc from their feast
will vex the gnat of the river a sai at which houman and other
with him laugh obsequi
next i heard the bag of gold be remov from the boat after which
we walk awai guard support me by either elbow until i found my
strength again and houman follow just behind perhap becaus he
fear my foot if he went in front
what ha chanc eunuch i ask present that i am disturb from
the bed where i wa sleep so well
i do not know lord he answer i onli know that the king of king
ha suddenli command that you should be brought befor him as a guest
cloth in a robe of honour even if to do so you must be awaken from
your rest ye to hi own royal tabl for he hold a feast thi night

chang her face to you i prai you bear no malic to those who when
she frown were forc ye under the privat seal of seal against
their will to carri out the command of the king be just o lord
shabaka
sai no more i will try to be just i answer but what is justic
in the east i onli know of it in egypt
now we reach on of the door of the palac and i wa taken to a
chamber where slave who were wait wash and anoint me with
scent after which thei clad me in a beauti robe of silk set
the girdl of rosehu pearl about me
when thei had finish preced by houman i wa led to a great pillar
hall close in with silk hang where mani feast through them i
went to a dai at the head of the hall where between halfdrawn curtain
surround by cupbear and other offic the king sat in all hi
glori upon a cushion golden throne he had a glitter winecup in
hi hand and at a glanc i saw that he wa drunk as it is the fashion
for these eastern to be at their great feast for he look happi and
human which he did not do when he wa sober or perchanc as sometim
i thought afterward he onli pretend to be drunk also i saw
someth els name be wondrous attir with the gold chain
about hi neck and wear a red headdress he wa seat on the carpet
befor the throne and sai thing that made the king laugh and even
caus the grave offic behind to smile
i came to the dai and at a littl sign from be who yet did not seem to
see me such a sign as he often made when he caught sight of game befor
i did i prostrat myself the king look at me then ask

that by virtu of it he command that you should be brought out of your
bed in the boat and led befor him to answer a question
so you were sent for master but i did not go with the messeng
fear lest if i did the king would forget all about the matter befor
you came therefor i stai and amus him with tale of hunt till
i could not think of ani more for you were long in come inde i
began to fear lest he should declar the feast at an end but at the
last just as he wa yawn and spoke to on of hi councillor
bid him send to the hous of women that thei might make readi to
receiv him there you came and the rest you know
now i look at be and said
mai the bless of all the god of all the land be on your head
sinc had it not been for you i should now lie in torment in that boat
hearken friend if ever we reach egypt again you will set foot on it
not as a slave but as a free man you will be rich also be that is
if we can take the gold i won with us sinc half of it is your
be squat down upon the floor and look up at me with a strang
smile on hi ugli face
you have given me three thing master he said gold which i do
not want at present freedom which i do not want at present and mayhap
never shall while you live and love me and the titl of friend thi
i do want though why i should care to hear it from your lip i am not
sure see that for a long while i have known that it wa spoken in
your heart sinc you have said it howev i will tell you someth
which hitherto i have hid even from you i have a right to that name
for if your blood is high o shabaka so is mine know that thi poor
dwarf whom you took captiv and save long year ago wa more than the
petti chief which he declar himself to be he wa and is by right the
king of the ethiopian and that throne with all it wealth and power he
could claim tomorrow if he would
the king of the ethiopian i said oh friend be i prai you to
rememb that we no longer stand in yonder court ly for our live
i speak no lie o shabaka i befor you am king of the ethiopian
moreov i laid that kingship down of my own will and should i so
desir can take it up again when i will sinc the ethiopian ar
faith to their king
why i ask astonish
master for so i will still call you who am not yet upon the land
of egypt where you have promis me freedom do you rememb anyth
strang about the peopl of that tribe from among whom you and the
egyptian soldier captur me by surpris becaus thei wish to drive
you and your follow from their countri
now i thought and answer
ye on thing i saw no women in their camp nor ani sign of children
thi i know becaus i gave order that such were to be spare and it wa
report to me that there were none so i suppos that thei had fled
awai
there were none to fly master that tribe wa a brotherhood which had
abjur women look on me now i am misshapen hideou am i not born
thu it is said becaus befor my birth my mother wa frighten by
a dwarf yet the law of the ethiopian is that their king must marri
within a year of their crown therefor i chose a woman to be the
queen whom i had long desir in secret she scorn me vow that not
for all the throne of all the world would she be mate to a monster
and that if it were done by forc she would kill herself a sai that
went abroad throughout the land i said that she had spoken well and
sent her in safeti from the countri after which i too laid down my
crown and depart with some who love me to form a brotherhood of
womenhat further down the nile beyond the border of ethiopia
there the egyptian forc of which you were in command attack us
unprepar and you made me your slave that is all
but why did you do thi be see that maiden ar mani and all
would not have thought thu
becaus i wish for that on onli master also i fear lest i should
becom the father of a breed of twist dwarf so i who wa a king am
now a slave and yet who know which wai the grasshopp will jump on
dai from a slave i mai again grow into a king and now let us seek that
wherein king ar as slave and slave as kingssleep
so we lai down and slept i thank the god that my bed wa not yonder
in the boat upon the great river
when i woke refresh though after all i had gone through on the
yesterdai my brain still swam a littl the light wa pour through
the carv work of the shutter window by it i saw be seat on the
floor engag in do someth to hi bow which as i have said had
been restor to us with our other weapon and ask him sleepili what
it wa
master he said yonder king demand your bow and therefor a bow
must be sent to him but there is no need for it to be that with which
you shot the lion which too you valu abov anyth you have
see that it came down to you from your forefath who wa a pharaoh
of egypt and ha been your companion from boyhood ever sinc you were
strong enough to draw it as you mai rememb i copi that bow out of a
somewhat lighter wood which i could bend with eas and it is the copi
that we will give to the king onli first i must set your string upon
it for that mai have been note also make on or two mark that ar on
your bow which i am finish now have begun the task with the dawn
you ar clever i said laugh and i am glad the holi tanofir
look on my bow onc had a vision it wa that an arrow loos from
it would drink the blood of a great king and save egypt but what king
and when he did not see
the dwarf nod and answer
i have heard that tale and so have other therefor i plai thi trick
sinc it is better that yonder palac dweller should get the arrow than
the bow there it is finish to the last scratch and none save you
and i would know them apart till we ar clear of thi curs land your
bow is mine master and you must find you anoth of the eastern make
master i repeat after him sai be did i dream or did you in
truth tell me last night that you ar by birth and right the king of a
great countri
i told you that master and it is true no dream sinc joi and
suffer mix unseal the lip and from them come that at time which
the heart would hide now i ask a favour of you that you will speak no
more of thi matter either to me or to ani other man or woman unless i
should speak of it first let it be as though it were inde a dream
it is grant i said as i rose and cloth myself not in my own
garment which had been taken from me in the palac but in the splendid
silken robe that had been set upon me after i wa loos from the boat
when thi wa done and i had wash and comb my long curl hair
we descend to a lower chamber and call for the woman of the hous to
bring us food of which i at heartili as we finish our meal we
heard shout in the street outsid of make wai for the servant of
the king and look through the windowplac saw a great cavalcad
approach head by two princ on horseback
now i prai that yonder tyrant ha not chang hi mind and that these
do not come to take me back to the boat i said in a low voic
have no fear master answer be see that you have touch hi
sceptr and drunk from hi cup which he gave to you after these thing
no harm can happen to you in ani land he rule therefor be at eas and
deal with these fellow proudli
a minut later two princ enter follow by slave who bore mani
thing among them those hide bag fill with gold that had been set
beneath me in the boat the elder of them bow greet me with the
titl of lord and i bow back to him then he hand me certain
roll ti up with silk and seal which he said i wa to deliv as
the king had command to the king satrap in egypt and to the princ
peroa also he gave me other letter address to the king servant on
the road and written on tablet of clai in a write i could not read
with all of which i touch my forehead in the eastern fashion
after thi he told me that by noon all would be readi for my journei
which i should make with the rank of the king envoi duli provis
and escort by hi servant with liberti to us the royal hors from
post to post then he order the slave to bring in the gift which the
king sent to me and these were mani includ even suit of flexibl
armour that would turn ani swordthrust or arrow
i thank him sai that i would be readi to start by noon and ask
whether the king wish to see me befor i rode he repli that he had
so wish but that as he wa suffer in hi head from the effect
of the sun he could not he bade me howev rememb all that he had
said to me and to be sure that the beauteou ladi amada of whom i had
spoken wa sent to him without delai in that case my reward should be
great but if i fail to fulfil hi command then hi wrath would be
greater and i should perish miser as he had promis
i bow and made no answer after which he and hi companion open the
bag of gold to show me that it wa there offer to weigh it again
against my servant the dwarf so that i could see that noth had been
taken awai
i repli that the king word wa truer than ani scale whereon the
bag were ti up again and seal then i produc the bow or rather
it counterfeit and have shown it to the princ wrap it and
six of my own arrow in a linen cloth to be taken to the king with
a messag that though hard to draw it wa the deadliest weapon in the
world the elder of them took it bow and bade me farewel sai
that perhap we should meet again er long in egypt if my god gave me
a safe journei so we part and i wa glad to see the last of them
scarc had thei gone when the six hunter whom i had won in the wager
and therebi save from death enter the chamber and fell upon their
knee befor me ask for order as to make readi my gear for the
journei i inquir of them if thei were come also to which their
spokesman repli that thei were my slave to do what i command
do you desir to come i inquir
o lord shabaka answer their spokesman we do though some of us
must leav wive and children behind us
why i ask
for two reason lord here we ar men disgrac though through no
fault of our own and if you were to leav us in thi land soon the
anger of the king would find us out and we should lose not onli our
wive and children but with them our live wherea in anoth land we
mai get other wive and more children but never shall we get anoth
life therefor we would leav those dear on to our friend know
that soon the women will forget and find other husband and that the
children will grow up to whatev fate is appoint them think of
us their father as dead secondli we ar hunter by trade and we
have seen that you ar a great hunter on whom we shall alwai be proud
to serv in the chase or in war on too who went out of hi path to
save our live becaus he saw that we had been unjustli doom to a
cruel death therefor we desir noth better than to be your slave
hope that perchanc we mai earn our liberti from you in dai to come
by our good servic
is that the wish of all of you i ask
speak on by on thei said that it wa though tear rose in the
ey of some of them who were marri at the thought of part from
their women and their littl on who it seem might not be brought
with them becaus thei were the peopl of the king and had not been
name in the bet moreov hors could not be found for so mani nor
could thei travel fast
come then i said and know that while you ar faith to me i will
be good to you men of my own trade and perhap in the end set you free
in a land where brave fellow ar not given to be torn to piec by wild
beast at the word of ani kind but if you fail me or betrai me then
either i will kill you or sell you to those who deal in slave to work
at the oar or in the mine till you die
henceforth we have no lord but you o shabaka thei said and on
after anoth took my hand and press it to their forehead vow to
be true to me in all thing while we live
so i bade them begon to bid farewel to those thei love and return
again within half an hour of noon never expect to tell the truth
that thei would come inde i did thi to give them the opportun of
escap if thei saw fit and hide themselv where thei would but as
i have often note the trade of hunt breed honesti in the blood
and at the hour appoint all of these men appear on of them with
a woman who carri a child in her arm cling to him and weep
bitterli when her veil slip asid i saw that she wa young and veri
fair to look on
so at noon we left the citi of the great king in the charg of two of
hi offic who brought me hi thank for the bow i had sent him which
he said he should treasur abov everyth he possess a sai
at which be roll hi yellow ey and grin we were mount on
splendid stallion from the royal stabl and clad in the shirt of mail
that had been present to us though when we were clear of the citi
we took these off becaus of the heat also becaus that which be wore
chafe him be too long for hi squat shape our good togeth with
the bag of gold were laden on sumpter hors which were led by my six
hunter slave four pick soldier brought up the rear mighti men from
the king own bodyguard and two of the royal postmen who serv us as
guid also there were cook and groom with spare hors
thu we start in state and a great crowd watch us go our road ran
by the river which we must cross in barg lower down so that in a
few minut we came to that quai whither i had been led on the previou
night to die ye there were the watch guard and there float the
hate doubl boat at the prow of which appear the tortur face of
the eunuch houman who roll hi head from side to side to rid himself
of the torment of the fli he caught sight of us and began to scream
for piti and forgiv whereat be smile the offic halt our
cavalcad and on of them approach me said
it is the king command o lord shabaka that you should look upon
thi villain who traduc you to the king and afterward dare to strike
you if you will enter the water and blind him that your face mai be
the last thing he see befor he pass into dark
i shook my head but be into whose mind some thought had come
whisper to me
i wish to speak with yonder eunuch so give me leav and fear noth
i will do him no hurt onli good if i find the chanc
then i said to the offic
it is not for great lord to aveng themselv upon the fallen yet my
slave here wa also wrong and would sai a word to yonder houman
so be it said the offic onli let him be care not to hurt
him too sore lest he should die befor the time and escap hi
punish
then be tuck up hi robe and wade into the river flourish a
great knife while see him come houman began to scream with fear
he reach the boat and bent over the eunuch talk to him in a low
voic what he did there i could not see becaus hi cloak wa spread
out on either side of the man head present howev i caught sight
of the flash of a knife and heard yell of agoni follow by groan
whereat i call to him to return and let the fellow be for when i
rememb that hi fate wa near to be my own those sound made me
sick at heart and i grew angri with be though the cruel eastern onli
laugh
at length he came back grin and wash the blade of hi knife in
the water i spoke fierc to him in my own languag and still he
grin on make no answer when we were mount again and ride awai
from that horribl boat with it groan prison watch be whose
behaviour and silenc i could not understand i saw him sweep hi hand
across hi great mouth and thrust it swiftli into hi bosom after
thi he spoke readili enough though in a low voic lest someon who
understood egyptian should overhear him
you ar a fool master he said to think that i should wish to wast
time in tortur that fat knave
then why did you tortur him i ask
becaus my god the grasshopp when he fashion me a dwarf gave
me a big mouth and good teeth he answer whereon i stare at him
think that he had gone mad
listen master i did not hurt houman all i did wa to cut hi cord
nearli through from the under side so that when night come he can
break them and escap if he ha the wit now master you mai not have
notic but i did that befor the king doom you to death by the boat
yesterdai he took a certain round white seal a cylind with god and
sign cut on it which hung by a gold chain from hi girdl and gave it
to houman to be hi warrant for all he did thi seal houman show to
the treasur whereon thei produc the gold that wa weigh in the
scale against me and to other when he order the boat to be prepar
for you to lie in moreov he forgot to return it for when he himself
wa drag off to the boat by direct command of the king i caught
sight of the chain beneath hi robe can you guess the rest
not quit i answer for i wish to hear the tale in hi own word
well master when i wa walk with houman after he had put you in
the boat i ask him about thi seal he show it to me and said that
he who bore it wa for the time the king of all the empir of the
east it seem that there is but on such seal which ha descend from
ancient dai from king to king and that of it everi offic great or
small ha an impress in all land if the seal is produc to him
he compar it with the impress and should the two agre he obei the
order that is brought as though the king had given it in person when
we reach the court doubtless houman would have return the seal but
see that the king wa or feign to be drunk wait for fear lest
it should be lost and with it hi life then he wa seiz as you saw
and in hi terror forgot all about the seal as did the king and hi
offic
but sure be those who took houman to the boat would have remov
it
master even the most clearsight do not see well at night at ani
rate my hope wa that thei had not done so and that is why i wade out
to prick the ey of houman moreov as i had hope so it wa there
beneath hi robe i saw the chain then i spoke to him sai
i am come to put out your ey as you deserv see how you have
treat my master still i will spare you at a price give me the king
ancient white seal that open all door and i will onli make a pretenc
of blind you moreov i will cut your cord nearli through so
that when the night come you can break them roll into the river and
escap
take it if you can he said and us it to injur or destroi that
accurs on
so you took it be
ye master but not easili rememb it wa on a chain about the
man neck and i could not draw it over hi head for like hi hand
hi throat wa ti by a cord as you rememb your wa
i rememb veri well i said for my throat is still sore from the
rope that ran to the same stapl to which my hand were fasten
ye master and therefor if i drew the chain off hi neck it would
still have been on the rope i thought of try to cut it with the
knife but thi wa not easi becaus it is thick and if i had drag
it up on the blade of the knife it would have been seen for mani ey
were watch me master then i took anoth counsel while i pretend
to be put out the ey of houman i bent down and get the chain
between my teeth i bit it through on tooth brokese but the next
finish the busi i at through the soft gold master and then
suck up the chain and the round white seal into my mouth and that
is why i could not answer you just now becaus my cheek were full of
chain so we have the king seal that all the subject countri know
and obei it mai be us yonder in egypt and at least the gold is of
valu
clever i exclaim veri clever but you have forgotten someth
be when that knave escap he will tell the whole stori and the king
will send after us and kill us who have stolen hi royal seal
i dont think so master first it is not like that houman will
escap he is veri fat and soft and alreadi suffer much after a dai in
the sun also he will be weak moreov i do not think that he can swim
for eunuch hate the water so if he get out of the boat it is probabl
that he will drown in the river sinc he dare not wade to the quai
where the guard will be wait but if he doe escap by swim
across the river he will hide for hi life sake and never be seen
again and if by chanc he is caught he will sai that the seal fell
into the water when he wa taken to the boat or that on of the guard
had stolen it what he will not sai is that he had bargain it awai
with someon who in return cut hi cord sinc for that crime he must
die by wors tortur than those of the boat lastli we shall ride so
fast that with six hour start none will catch us or if thei do i can
throw awai the chain and swallow the seal
as be said so it happen the fate of houman i never learn and of
the theft of the seal i heard no more until a proclam wa issu to
all the kingdom that a new on wa in us but thi wa not until long
afterward when it had serv my turn and that of egypt
chapter viii the ladi amada
now dai by dai hour by hour and minut by minut everi detail of that
journei appear befor me but to set it all down is needless as i
allan quatermain write the record of my vision still i seem to hear
the thunder of our hors hoof while we rush forward at full gallop
over the plain over the mountain pass and by the bank of river
the speed at which we travel wa wonder for at interv of about
forti mile were posthous and at these whatev might be the hour
of dai or night we found fresh hors from the king stud await us
moreov the postmast knew that we were come which astonish
me until we discov that thei had been warn of our arriv by two
king messeng who travel ahead of us
these men it would seem although our offic and guid profess
ignor of the matter must have left the king palac at dawn on the
dai of our departur wherea we did not mount in the citi till a littl
after noon therefor thei had six hour good start of us and what is
more travel lighter than we did have no sumpter beast with them
and no cook or servant moreov alwai thei had the pick of the
hors and chose the three swiftest beast lead the third in case
on of their own should founder or meet with accid thu it came
about that we never caught them up although we cover quit a hundr
mile a dai onli onc did i see them far off upon the skylin of a
mountain rang which we had to climb but by the time we had reach it
crest thei were gone
at length we came to the desert without accid and cross it though
more slowli but even here the king had hi post which were in charg
of arab who live in tent by well of water or sometim where there
wa none save what wa brought to them so still we gallop on parch
by the burn sand beneath and the burn sand abov and reach the
border of egypt
here upon the veri boundari line the two offic halt the cavalcad
sai that their order were to return thenc and make report to the
king there then we part be and i with the six hunter who still
chose to cling to me go forward and the offic of the king with
the guid and servant go back the good hors that we rode from
the last post thei gave to us by the king command togeth with the
sumpter beast sinc hors broken to the saddl were hard to come
by in egypt where thei were train to draw chariot these we took
send back my thank to the king and start on onc more be
lead that beast which bore the gold and the hunter serv as a
guard
inde i wa glad to see the last of those eastern although thei had
brought us safe and treat us well for all the while i wa never
sure but that thei had some order to lead us into a trap or perhap to
make awai with us in our sleep and take back the gold and the priceless
rosehu pearl ani two of which were worth it all but such wa not
their command nor did thei dare to steal them on their own account
sinc then even if thei escap the vengeanc of the king their wive
and all their famili would have paid the price
now we enter egypt near the salt lake that ar not far from the head
of the gulf cross the canal that the old pharaoh had dug which
prove easi for it wa silt up befor we reach it we found some
peasant folk labour in their garden and i heard on of them call to
anoth
here come more of the eastern what is toward think you neighbour
i do not know answer the other but when i pass down the canal
thi morn i saw a bodi of the great king guard gather from the
fort doubtless it is to meet these men of whose come the other two
who went by fifti hour ago have warn the offic
now what doe that mean i ask of be
neither more nor less than we have heard master the two king
messeng who have gone ahead of us all the wai from the citi have
told the offic of the frontier fort that we ar come so he ha
advanc to the ford to meet us for what purpos i do not know
nor do i i said but i wish we could take anoth road if there
were on
there is none master for abov and below the canal is full of water
and the bank ar too steep for hors to climb also we must show no
doubt or fear
he thought a while then ad
take the royal seal master it mai be us
he gave it to me and i examin it more close than i had done befor
it wa a cylind of plain white shell hung on a gold chain that which
be had bitten through but now mend again by take out the broken
link on thi cylind were cut figur as i think of a priest
present a nobl to a god over whom wa the crescent of the moon
while behind the god stood a man or demon with a tall spear also
between the figur were mystic sign mean i know not what the
workmanship of the carv wa grown shallow with time and us for the
cylind seem to be veri ancient a sacr thing that had descend
from gener to gener and wa thread through with a bar of
silver on which it turn
i put the seal which wa like no other that i had seen be the work
of an earli and simpler ag round my neck beneath my mail and we went
on
descend the steep bank of the canal we came to the ford where the
sand that had silt in wa cover by not more than a foot of water as
we enter it on the top of the further bank appear a bodi of about
thirti arm and mount men on of whom carri the great king
banner on which i note wa blazon the veri figur that were cut
upon the cylind now it wa too late to retreat so we rode through
the water and met the soldier their offic advanc cry
in the name of the great king greet my lord shabaka
in the name of the great king greet i answer what would you
with shabaka offic of the king
onli to do him honour the word of the king ha reach us and we
come to escort you to the court of idern the satrap of the king and
governor of egypt who sit at sai
that is not my road offic i travel to memphi to deliv the
command of the king to my cousin peroa the ruler of egypt under the
king afterward perchanc i shall visit the high idern
to whom our command ar to take you now my lord shabaka not
afterward said the offic sternli glanc round at hi arm
escort
i come to give command not to receiv them captain of the king
seiz shabaka and hi servant said the offic briefli whereon the
soldier rode forward to surround us
i wait till thei were near at hand then suddenli i plung my hand
beneath my robe and drew out the small white seal which i held befor
the ey of the offic sai
who is it that dare to lai a finger upon the holder of the king
white seal sure that man is readi for death
the offic stare at it then leapt from hi hors and flung himself
face downward on the ground cry
it is the ancient signet of the king of the east given to their first
forefath by sama the sungod on which hang the fortun of the great
hous pardon my lord shabaka
it is grant i answer becaus what you did you did in ignor
now go to the satrap idern and sai to him that if he would have speech
with the bearer of the king seal which all must obei he will find him
at memphi farewel and with be and the six hunter i rode through
the guard none strive to hinder me
that wa well done master said be
ye i said those two messeng who went ahead of us brought order
to the frontier guard of idern that i should be taken to him as a
prison i do not know why but i think becaus thing ar pass in
egypt of which we know noth and the king did not desir that i should
see the princ peroa and give him new that i might have gather
mayhap we have been outwit be and the busi of the ladi amada
is but a pretext to pick a quarrel suddenli befor peroa can strike the
first blow
perhap master for these eastern ar veri crafti but master what
happen to those who make a fals us of the king ancient sacr
signet i think thei have cut the rope which tie them to earth and he
look upward to the sky roll hi yellow ey
thei must find new rope be and quickli befor thei ar caught
hearken you have sat upon a throne and i can speak out to you think
you that my cousin the princ peroa love to be the servant of thi
distant eastern king he who by right is pharaoh of egypt peroa must
strike or lose hi niec and perchanc hi life forward that we mai
warn him
and if he will not strike master know the king might and be
somewhat slow to move
then be i think that you and i had best go hunt far awai in those
land you know where even the great king cannot follow us
and where if onli i can find a woman who doe not make me ill to look
on and whom i do not make ill i too can onc more be a king master
and the lord of mani thousand brave arm men i must speak of that
matter to the holi tanofir
who doubtless will know what to advis you be or if he di not i
shall
for a while we rode on in silenc each think hi own thought then
be said
master befor so veri long we shall reach the nile and have with us
gold in plenti can bui boat and hire crew it come into my mind that
we should do well for our own safeti and comfort to start at onc on a
hunt journei far from egypt in the land of the ethiopian master
there perchanc i could gather togeth some of the wise men in whose
hand i left the rule of my kingdom and submit to them thi question of
a woman to marri me the ethiopian ar a faith peopl master and
will not reject me becaus i have spent some year see the world
afar that i might learn how to rule them better
i have rememb that it cannot be be i said
why not master
for thi reason you left your countri becaus of a woman i cannot
leav mine again becaus of a woman
be roll hi ey around as though he thought to see that woman in the
desert not discov her he stare upward and there found light
is she perchanc name the ladi amada master
i nod
so the ladi amada who you told the great king is the most beauti
on in the whole world caus the fire of love to burn up in hi
royal heart and with it mani other thing of which we do not know at
present
you told him be i said angrili
i told him of a beauti on i did not tell him her name master and
although i never thought of it at the time perhap she will be angri
with him who told her name
now fear took hold of me and be saw it in my face
do not be afraid master if there is troubl i will swear that i told
the great king that ladi name
ye be but how would that fit in with the stori see that i wa
brought out of the boat for thi veri purpos
quit easili master sinc i will sai that you were led from the boat
to confirm my tale oh she will be angri with me no doubt but in
egypt even a dwarf cannot be kill becaus he ha declar a certain
ladi to be the most beauti in the world but master tell me when
did you learn to love her
when we were boi and girl be we us to plai togeth be
cousin and i us to hold her hand then suddenli she refus to let
me hold her hand ani more and i be quit grown up then though she
wa younger understood that i had better go awai
i should have stop where i wa master
no be she wa studi to be a priestess and my great uncl the
holi tanofir told me that i had better go awai so i went down south
hunt and fight in command of the troop and met you be
which perhap wa better for you master than to stop to watch the
ladi amada acquir learn still i wonder whether the holi tanofir is
alwai right you see master he think a great deal of priest and
priestess and is so veri old that he ha forgotten all about love and
that without it there never would have been a holi tanofir
the holi tanofir think of soul not of bodi be
ye master still oil is of no us without a lamp or a soul without
a bodi at least here underneath the sun or so we were taught who
worship the grasshopp but master when you came back from all your
hunt what happen then
then i found be that the ladi amada have acquir all the
learn possibl had taken her first vow to isi which she said she
would not break for ani man on earth although she might have done so
without crime therefor although i wa dear to her as a brother would
have been had she had on and she swore that she had never even thought
of anoth man she refus so much as to think of marri who dream
onli of the heavenli perfect of the ladi isi
ump said be we ethiopian have priestess of the grasshopp or
the grasshopp wife but thei do not think of her like that i hope
that on dai someth stronger than herself will not caus the ladi
amada to break her vow to the heavenli isi onli then perhap it mai
be for the sake of anoth man who did not go off to the east on account
of such fool talk but here is a villag and the hors ar spent let
us stop and eat as i suppos even the ladi amada doe sometim
on the follow afternoon we cross the nile and toward sunset
enter the vast and ancient citi of memphi on it white wall float
the banner of the great king which be point out to me sai that
wherev we went in the whole world it seem that we could never be
free from those accurs symbol
mai i live to spit upon them and cast them into the moat i answer
savag for as i drew near to amada thei grew ten time more hate
to me than thei had been befor
in truth i wa nearer to amada than i thought for after we had
pass the enclosur of the templ of ptah the most wonder and the
mightiest in the whole world we came to the templ of isi there near
to the pylon gate we met a process of her priest and priestess
advanc to offer the even sacrific of song and flower clad all
of them in robe of purest white it wa a dai of festiv so singer
went with them after the singer came a band of priestess bear
flower in front of whom walk anoth priestess shake a sistrum
that made a littl tinkl music
even at a distanc there wa someth about the tall and slender shape
of thi priestess that stir me when we came nearer i saw why for it
wa amada herself through the thin veil she wore i could see her dark
and tender ey set beneath the broad brow that wa so full of thought
and the sweet curv mouth that wa like no other woman moreov
there could be no doubt sinc the veil part abov her breast show
the birthmark for which she wa famou the mark of the young moon the
sign of isi
i sprang from my hors and ran toward her she look up and saw me
at first she frown then her face grew wonder then tender and i
thought that her red lip shape my name moreov in her confus she
let the sistrum fall
i mutter amada and step forward but priest ran between us and
thrust me awai next moment she had recov the sistrum and pass
on with her head bow nor did she lift her ey to look back
begon man cri a priest begon whoever you mai be becaus you
wear eastern armour do you think that you can dare the curs of isi
then i fell back the holi imag of the goddess pass and the
process vanish through the pylon gate i shabaka the egyptian
stood by my hors and watch it depart i wa happi becaus the ladi
amada wa aliv well and more beauti than ever also becaus she
had shown sign of joi and confus at see me again yet i wa
unhappi becaus i met her still fill a holi offic which built a wall
between us also becaus it seem to me an evil omen that i should have
been repel from her by a priest of isi who talk of the curs of
the goddess moreov the sacr statu i suppos by accid turn
toward me as it pass and perhap by the chanc of light seem to
frown upon me
thu i thought as shabaka hundr of year befor the christian
era but as allan quatermain the modern man to whom it wa given so
marvel to behold all these thing and who in behold them yet
never quit lost the sens of hi own ident of todai i wa amaz
for i knew that thi ladi amada wa the same be though clad in
differ flesh as that other ladi with whom i had breath the magic
taduki fume which had power to rend the curtain of the past or
perhap onli to breed dream of what it might have been
to the outward ey inde she wa differ as i wa differ
taller more slender largerei with longer and slimmer hand than
those of ani western woman and on the whole even more beauti and
allur moreov that mysteri look which from time to time i had
seen on ladi ragnal face wa more constant on that of the ladi
amada it brood in the deep ey and settl in a curiou smile about
the curv of the lip a smile that wa not altogeth human such a
smile as on might wear who had look on hidden thing and heard voic
that spoke beyond the limit of the world
somehow neither then nor at ani other time dure all my dream could i
imagin thi amada thi daughter of a hundr king whose blood might
be trace back through dynasti on dynasti as noth but a woman who
nurs children upon her breast it wa as though someth of our
common natur had been bred out of her and someth of anoth natur
whereof we have no ken had enter to fill it place and yet these two
women were the same that i knew or at ani rate much of them wa the
same for who can sai what part of us we leav behind as we flit from
life to life to find it again elsewher in the abysm of time and
chang on thing too wa quit identicalth birthmark of the new moon
abov the breast which the priest of the kendah had declar wa alwai
the seal that mark their prophetess the guardian of the holi child
when the process had quit depart and i could no longer hear the
sound of sing i remount and rode on to my hous or rather to that
of my mother the great ladi tiu which wa situat beneath the wall of
the old palac face toward the nile inde my heart wa full of thi
mother of mine whom i love and who love me for i wa her onli child
and my father had been long dead so long that i could not rememb him
eight month had gone by sinc i saw her face and in eight month who
knew what might have happen the thought made me cold for she who
wa ag and not too strong perhap had been gather to osiri oh if
that were so
i shook my tire hors to a canter be ride ahead of me to clear a
road through the crowd street in which at thi hour of sundown all
the idler of memphi seem to have gather thei stare at me becaus
it wa not common to see men ride in memphi and with littl love
sinc from my dress and escort thei took me to be some envoi from their
hate master the great king of the east some even threaten to bar
the wai but we thrust through and present turn into a thoroughfar
of privat hous stand in their own garden our wa the third of
these at it gate i leapt from my hors push open the close door
and hasten in to seek and learn
i had not far to go for there in the courtyard stand at the head of
our modest household and dress in her festal robe wa my mother the
state and whitehair ladi tiu as on stand who await the come

the ladi amada walk in the process of isi
ah the ladi amada the mother wait that the son mai stop to greet the
ladi amada
but why did you wait my mother who but a spirit or a bird of
the air could have told you that i wa come see that i sent no
messeng befor me
you must have done so shabaka sinc yesterdai on came from the holi
tanofir our rel who dwell in the desert in the burialground of
sekera he bore a messag from tanofir to me tell me to make readi
sinc befor sundown tonight you my son would be with me have
escap great danger accompani by the dwarf be your servant and

lodg for the six strang men in the outbuild behind the hous and
sent a thank offer to the templ for know my son i have suffer
much fear for you
and not without caus as you will sai when i tell you all i answer
laugh but how tanofir knew that i wa come is more than i can
guess come my mother greet be here for had it not been for him
never should i have live to hold your hand again
so she greet him and thank him whereon be roll hi ey and
mutter someth about the holi tanofir after which we enter the
hous thenc i despatch a messeng to the princ peroa sai that
if it were hi pleasur i would wait on him at onc see that i had
much to tell him thi done i bath and caus my hair and beard to be
trim and discard the eastern garment cloth myself in those
of egypt and so felt that i wa my own man again then i came out
refresh and drank a cup of syrian wine and the night have fallen
sat down by my mother in the chamber with a lamp between us and
hold her hand told her someth of my stori show her the sack
of gold that had come with me safe from the east and the chain of
priceless rosehu pearl that i had won in a wager from the great
king
now when she learn how be by hi wit had save me from a death of
torment in the boat my mother clap her hand to summon a servant and
sent for be and said to him
be hitherto i have look on you as a slave taken by my son the
nobl shabaka in on of hi far journei that it pleas him to make to
fight and to hunt but henceforth i look upon you as a friend and give
you a seat at my tabl moreov it come into my mind that although so
strang shape by some evil god perhap you ar more than you seem to
be
now be look at me to see if i had told my mother anyth and when i
shook my head answer
i thank you o ladi of the hous who have but done my duti to my
master still it is true that as a goatskin often hold good wine so a
dwarf should not alwai be judg by what can be seen of him
then he went awai
it seem that we ar rich again son who have been somewhat poor of
late year said my mother look at the bag of gold also there
ar the pearl which doubtless ar worth more than the gold what ar
you go to do with them shabaka
i thought of offer them as a gift to the ladi amada i repli
hesitatingli that is unless you
i no i am too old for such gem yet son it might be well to keep
them for a time see that while thei ar your own thei mai give you
more weight in the ey of the princ peroa and other wherea if you
gave them the ladi amada and she took them perchanc it might onli be
to see them return to the east whither you tell me she is summon by
on whose order mai not be disobei
now i turn white with rage and answer
while i live mother amada shall never go to the east to be the woman
of yonder king
while you live son but those who cross the will of a great king ar
apt to die also thi is a matter which her uncl the princ peroa
must decid as polici dictat now as ever the woman is but a pawn in
the game oh my son she went on do not pin all your heart to the
robe of thi amada she is veri fair and veri learn but is she
on who will love moreov if so she is a priestess and it would be
difficult for her to wed who is sworn to isi lastli rememb thi
if egypt were free she would be it heiress not her uncl peroa for
her is the true blood not hi would he therefor be will to give
her to ani man who accord to the ancient custom through her would
acquir the right to rule
i do not seek to rule mother i onli seek to wed amada whom i love
amada whom you love and whose name you or rather your servant be
which is the same thing sinc it will be held that he did it by your
order gave to the king of the east or so i understand here is a
pretti tangl shabaka and rather would i be without all that gold and
those priceless pearl than have the task of it unravel
befor i could answer and explain all the truth to her the curtain wa
swung asid and through it came a messeng from the princ peroa who
bade me come to eat with him at onc at the palac sinc he must see me
thi night
so my mother have set the rope of rosehu pearl in a doubl chain
about my neck i kiss her and went with be who wa also bidden
outsid a chariot wa wait into which we enter
now master said be to me as we drove to the palac i almost wish
that we were back in anoth chariot hunt lion in the east
why i ask
becaus then although we had much to fear there wa no woman in the
stori now the woman ha enter it and i think that our real troubl
ar about to begin oh tomorrow i go to seek counsel of the holi
tanofir
and i come with you i answer for i think it will be need
chapter ix the messeng
we descend at the great gate of the palac and were led through empti
hall that were no longer us now when there wa no king in egypt to
the wing of the build in which dwelt the princ peroa here we were
receiv by a chamberlain for the princ of egypt still kept some
state although it wa but small and had about him men who bore the old
highsound titl of the offic of pharaoh
the chamberlain led me and be to an antechamb of the banquet hall
and left us sai that he would summon the princ who wish to see
me befor he at thi howev wa not necessari sinc while he spoke
peroa who as i guess had been wait for me enter by anoth
door he wa a majesticlook man of middl ag for grei show in
hi hair and beard clad in white garment with a purpl hem and wear
on hi brow a golden circlet from the front of which rose the uru
in the shape of a hood snake that might be worn by those of royal
blood alon hi face wa full of thought and hi black and pierc
ey look heavi as though with sleepless inde i could see that
he wa troubl hi gaze fell upon us and hi featur chang to a
pleasant smile
greet cousin shabaka he said i am glad that you have return
safe from the east and burn to hear your tide i prai that thei mai
be good for never wa good new more need in egypt
greet princ i answer bow my knee i and my servant here
ar return safe but as for our tide well judg of them for
yourself and draw the letter of the great king from my robe i
touch my forehead with the roll and hand it to him
i see that you have acquir the eastern custom shabaka he said as
he took it but here in my own hous which onc wa the palac of our
forefath the pharaoh of egypt by your leav i will omit them amen
be my wit he ad bitterli i cannot bear to lai the letter of a
foreign king against my brow in token of my countri vassalag
then he broke the silk of the seal and read and as he read hi face
grew black with rage
what he cri cast down the roll and stamp on it what doe
thi dog of an eastern king bid me send my niec by birth the royal
princess of egypt to be hi toi until he weari of her first i will
choke her with my own hand how come it shabaka that you care to
bring me such a messag were i pharaoh now i think your life would pai
the price
as it would certainli have paid the price had i not done so princ
i brought the letter becaus i must also a copi of it ha gone i
believ to idern the satrap at sai it is better to face the truth
princ and i think that i mai be of more servic to you aliv than
dead if you do not wish to send the ladi amada to the king marri her
to someon els after which he will seek her no more
he look at me shrewdli and said
to whom then i cannot marri her be her uncl and alreadi marri
do you mean to yourself shabaka
i have love the ladi amada from a child princ i answer boldli
also i have high blood in me and have brought much gold from the
east am rich again and on accustom to war
so you have brought gold from the east how well you can tell me
afterward but you fly high you a count of egypt wish to marri the
royal ladi of egypt for such she is by birth and rank which if ever
egypt were free again would give you a titl to the throne
i ask no throne princ if there were on to fill i should be content
to leav that to you and your heir
so you sai no doubt honestli but would the children of amada sai the
same would you even sai it if you were her husband and would she sai
it moreov she is a priestess sworn not to wed though perhap that
troubl might be overcom if she wish to wed which i doubt mayhap
you might discov well you ar hungri and worn with long travel
come let us eat and afterward you can tell your stori amada and the
other will be glad to hear it as i shall follow me count shabaka

think return here shabaka an hour after sunris tomorrow by which
time i can gather all the wisest men in memphi and we will discuss
thi matter ah here is the impress now let the seal be tri
a box wa brought and open in it wa a slab of wood on which wa an
impress of the king seal in wax surround by those of other seal
certifi that it wa genuin also there wa a write describ
the appear of the seal i hand the signet to peroa who have
compar it with the descript in the write fit it to the
impress on the wax
it is the same he said see all of you
thei look and nod then he would have given it back to me but i
refus to take it sai
it is not well that thi mighti symbol should hang about the neck of a
privat man whenc it might be stolen or lost
or who might be murder for it sake interrupt peroa
ye princ therefor take it and hide it in the safest and most
secret place in the palac and with it these pearl that ar too
priceless to be flaunt about the street of memphi at night unless
inde and i turn to look for amada but she wa gone
so the seal and the pearl were taken and lock in the box with the
impress and born awai nor wa i sorri to see the last of them wise
as it happen then i bade the princ and hi compani good night and
present wa drive homeward with be in the chariot
our wai led us past some larg hous onc occupi by offic of the
court of pharaoh but now that there wa no court fallen into ruin
suddenli from out of these hous sprang a band of men disguis as
common robber whose face were hidden by cloth with eyehol cut
in them thei seiz the hors by the bridl and befor we could do
anyth leapt upon us and held us fast then a tall man speak with
a foreign accent said
search that offic and the dwarf take from them the seal upon a gold
chain and a rope of rosehu pearl which thei have stolen but do them
no harm
so thei search us the tall man himself help and aid by other
hold be who struggl with them and search the chariot also by
the light of the moon but found noth the tall man mutter that i
must be the wrong offic and at a sign thei left us and ran awai
that wa a wise thought of mine be which caus me to leav certain
ornament in the palac i said as it is thei have taken noth
ye master he answer though i have taken someth from them
a sai that i did not understand at the time those eastern whom we
met by the canal told idern about the seal and he order thi to be
done that tall man wa on of the messeng who came tonight to the
palac
then why did thei not kill us be
becaus murder especi of on who hold the seal is an ugli
busi that is easili track down wherea thiev ar mani in
memphi and who troubl about them when thei have fail oh the
grasshopp or amen or both have been with us tonight
so i thought although i said noth for sinc we had come off
scatheless what did it matter well thi it show me that the signet
of the great king wa inde to be dread and covet even here in
egypt if idern could get it into hi possess what might he not do
with it caus himself to be proclaim pharaoh perhap and becom the
forefath of an independ dynasti why not when the empir of the
east wa tax with a great war elsewher and if thi wa so why should
not peroa do the same he who had behind him all old egypt madden
with it wrong and foreign rule
that same night befor i slept but after be and i had hidden awai the
bag of gold by buri them beneath the clai floor i laid the whole
matter befor my mother who wa a veri wise woman she heard me out
answer littl then said
the busi is veri danger and of it end i will not speak until
i have heard the counsel of your greatuncl the holi tanofir still
thing have gone so far it seem to me that bold mai be the best
cours sinc the great king ha hi grecian war to deal with and
whatev he mai sai cannot attack egypt yet awhil therefor if peroa
is abl to overcom idern and hi armi he mai caus himself to be
proclaim pharaoh and make egypt free if onli for a time
such is my mind mother
not all your mind son i think she answer smile for you
think more of the love amada than of these high polici at ani
rate tonight well marri your amada if you can though i misdoubt me
somewhat of a woman who is so lost in learn and think so much about
her soul at least if you marri her and egypt should becom free as it
wa for thousand of year you will be the next heir to the throne as
husband of the great royal ladi
how can that be mother see that peroa ha a son
a vain youth with no more in him than a child rattl if onc amada
ceas to think about her soul she will begin to think about her throne
especi if she ha children but all thi is far awai and for the
present i am glad that neither she nor the thiev have got those
pearl though perhap thei might be safer here than where thei ar
and now my son go rest for you need it and dream of noth not even
amada who for her part will dream of isi if at all i will wake you
befor the dawn
so i went be too tire to talk more and slept like a crocodil
in the sun till as it seem to me but a few minut later i saw my
mother stand over me with a lamp sai that it wa time to rise i
rose unwillingli enough but refresh wash and dress myself
by which time the sun had begun to appear then i at some food and
call be made readi to start for the palac
my son said my mother the ladi tiu befor we part while you
have been sleep i have been think as is the wai of the old
peroa your cousin will be glad enough to make us of you but he doe
not love you over much becaus he is jealou of you and fear lest you
should becom hi rival in the futur still he is an honest man and
will keep a bargain which he onc ha made now it seem that abov
everyth on earth you desir amada on whom you have set your heart
sinc boyhood but who ha alwai plai with you and spoken to you with
her arm stretch out also life is short and mai come to an end ani
dai as you should know better than most men who have live among
danger and therefor it is well that a man should take what he
desir even if he find afterward that the rose he crush to hi
breast ha thorn for then at least he will have smelt the rose not
onli have look on and long to smell it therefor befor you hand
over your gold and place your wit and strength at the servic of peroa
make your bargain with him name that if therebi you save amada from
the king hous of women and help to set peroa on the throne he shall
promis her to you free of ani priestli curs you give her as dowri
the priceless rosehu pearl that ar worth a kingdom so you will get
your rose till it wither and if the thorn prick do not blame me and
on dai you mai becom a kingor a slave amen know which
now i laugh and said that i would take her counsel who desir amada
and noth els as for all her talk about thorn i paid no heed to
it know that she love me veri much and wa jealou of amada who she
thought would take her place with me
chapter x shabaka plight hi troth
be and i went arm to the palac walk in the middl of the road
but now that the sun wa up we met no more robber at the gate a
messeng summon me alon to the presenc of peroa who he said
wish to talk with me befor the sit of the council i went and
found him by himself
i hear that you were attack last night he said after greet me
i answer that i wa and told him the stori ad that it wa
fortun i had left the white seal and the pearl in safe keep
sinc without doubt the wouldb thiev were eastern who desir to
recov them
ah the pearl he said on of those who handl them who wa onc
a dealer in gem sai that thei ar without price unmatch in the
whole world and that never in all hi life ha he seen ani to equal the
smallest of them
i repli that i believ thi wa so then he ask me of the valu of
the gold of which i had spoken i told him and it wa a great sum for
gold wa scarc in egypt hi ey gleam for he need wealth to pai
soldier
and all thi you ar readi to hand over to me shabaka
now i bethought me of my mother word and answer
ye princ at a price
what price shabaka
the price of the hand of the royal ladi amada freed from her vow
moreov i will give her the pearl as a marriag dowri and place at
your servic my sword and all the knowledg i have gain in the east
swear to stand or fall with you
i thought it shabaka well in thi world noth is given for noth
and the offer is a fair on you ar well born too as well as myself
and a brave and clever man further amada ha not taken her final vow
and therefor the high priest can absolv her from her marriag to
the goddess or to her son horu whichev it mai be for i do not
understand these mysteri but shabaka if fortun should chanc to go
with us and i should becam the first pharaoh of a new dynasti in egypt
he who wa marri to the royal princess of the true blood might becom
a danger to my throne and famili
i shall not be that man princ who am content with my own station
and to be your servant
and my son shabaka you know that i have but on law son
and your son princ
you ar honest shabaka and i believ you but how about your son
if you have ani and how about amada herself well in great busi
someth must be risk and i need the gold and the rest which i
cannot take for noth for you won them by your skill and courag and
thei ar your but how you won the seal you have not told us nor is
there time for you to do so now
he thought a littl walk up and down the chamber then went on
i accept your offer shabaka so far as i can
so far as you can princ
ye i can give you amada in marriag and make that marriag easi but
onli if amada herself consent the will of a royal princess of egypt of
full ag cannot be forc save by her father if he reign as pharaoh
and i am not her father but onli her guardian therefor it stand
thu ar you will to fulfil your part of the bargain save onli as
regard the pearl if she doe not marri you and to take your chanc
of win amada as a man win a woman i on my part promis to do all
in my power to help your suit
now it wa my turn to think for a moment what did i risk the gold and
perhap the pearl no more for in ani case i should fight for peroa
against the eastern king whom i hate and through him for egypt well
these came to me by chanc and if thei went by chanc what of it also
i wa not on who desir to wed a woman howev much i worship
her if she desir to turn her back on me if i could win her in fair
lovewel if not it wa my misfortun and i want her in no other
wai lastli i had reason to think that she look on me more favour
than she had ever done on ani other man and that if it had not been for
what my mother call her soul and it long she would have given
herself to me befor i journei to the east inde onc she had said
as much and there wa someth in her ey last night which told me
that in her heart she love me though with what passion at the time i
did not know so veri swiftli i made up my mind and answer
i understand and i accept the gold shall be deliv to you todai
princ the pearl ar alreadi in your keep to await the end
good he exclaim then let the matter be reduc to write and at
onc that afterward neither of us mai have caus to complain of the
other
so he sent for hi secret scribe and dictat to him briefli but
clearli the substanc of our bargain noth be ad and noth
taken awai thi roll written on papyru wa afterward copi twice
peroa take on copi i anoth and a third be deposit accord
to custom in the librari of the templ of ptah
when all wa done and peroa and i had touch each other breast and
given our word in the name of amen we went to the hall in which we
had dine where those whom the princ had summon were assembl
altogeth there were about thirti of them great citizen of memphi
or landown from without who had been call togeth in the night
some of these men were veri old and could rememb when egypt had a
pharaoh of it own befor the east set it heel upon her neck of nobl
blood also
other were merchant who dealt with all the citi of egypt other
hereditari gener or captain of fleet of ship other grecian
offic of mercenari who were suppos to be in the pai of the king
of king but hate him as did all the greek then there were the high
priest of ptah of amen of osiri and other who were still the most
power men in the land sinc there wa no villag between thebe and
the mouth of the nile in which thei had not those who were sworn to the
servic of their god
such wa the compani repres all that remain or could be gather
there of the great of egypt the ancient and the fallen
to these when the door had been close and bar and trusti watchmen
set to guard them peroa expound the case in a low and earnest voic
he show them that the king of the east sought a new quarrel against
egypt that he might grind her to powder beneath hi heel and that he
did thi by demand the person of amada hi own niec and the royal
ladi of egypt to be includ in hi household like ani common woman if
she were refus then he would send a great armi under pretext of take
her and lai the land wast as far as thebe and if she were grant
some new quarrel would be pick and in the person of the royal amada
all of them be for ever shame
next he show the seal tell them that iwho wa known to mani of
them at least by reputehad brought it from the east and repeat to
them the plan that i had propos upon the previou night after thi he
ask their counsel sai that befor noon he must send an answer to
idern the king satrap at sai
then i wa call upon to speak and in answer to question answer
frankli that i had stolen the ancient white seal from the king servant
who carri it as a warrant for the king privat vengeanc on on who
had best him how i did not mention i told them also of the state of
the great king empir and that i had heard that he wa about to enter
upon a war with the greek which would need all it strength and that
therefor if thei wish to strike for liberti the time wa at hand
then the talk began and last for two hour each man give hi
judgment accord to preced some on wai and some anoth when
all had done and it becam clear that there were differ of opinion
some be content to live on in slaveri with what remain to them and
other desir to strike for freedom among whom were the high priest
who fear lest the eastern heret should utterli destroi their
worship peroa spoke onc more
elder of egypt he said briefli certain of you think on wai and
certain anoth but of thi be sure such talk as we have held togeth
cannot be hid it will come to the ear of spi and through them to
those of the great king and then all of us alik ar doom if you
refus to stir thi veri dai i with my famili and household and the
royal ladi amada and all who cling to me fly to upper egypt and
perhap beyond it to ethiopia leav you to deal with the great king
as you will or to follow me into exil that he will attack us there is
no doubt either over the pretext of amada or some other sinc shabaka
ha heard as much from hi own lip now choos
then after a littl whisper togeth everi man of them vote for
rebellion though some of them i could see with heavi heart and bound
themselv by a great oath to cling togeth to the last
the matter be thu settl such a letter wa written to idern as
i had suggest on the night befor and seal with the signet of
signet of the yield up of amada it said noth but command
idern under the privat white seal that none dare disobei to wait
upon the princ peroa at memphi forthwith and there learn from him
the holder of the seal what wa the will of the great king then
the council wa adjourn till on hour after noon and most of them
depart to send messeng bear secret word to the variou citi
and nome of egypt
befor thei went howev i wa direct to wait upon my rel
the holi tanofir whom all acknowledg to be the greatest magician in
egypt and to ask of him to seek wisdom and an oracl from hi spirit
as to the futur and whether in it we should fare well or ill thi i
promis to do
when most of the council were gone the messeng of idern were
summon and came proudli and with them or rather befor them be
for whom i had sent as he wa not present at the council

you ar wise answer peroa i prai for hi own sake that the satrap
idern mai be as wise now begon thank whatev god you worship
that your life is whole in you and that your right hand remain upon
your wrist
so the butler and those with him prostrat themselv befor peroa
and bow humbl to me and even to be becaus in their heart now thei
believ that we were cloth by the great king with terribl power
that might destroi them all if so we chose then thei went the butler
limp a littl and with no pride left in him
that wa good work said peroa to me afterward when we were alon
for now yonder knave is frighten and will frighten hi master

perhap he answer and we part for he had much to do
that afternoon the council met again at it i gave over the gold and by
help of it all wa arrang within a week ten thousand arm men would
be in memphi and a hundr ship with their crew upon the nile also
a great armi would be gather in upper egypt offic for the most
part by greek skill in war the greek citi too at the mouth of the
nile would be readi to revolt or so some of their citizen declar
for thei hate the great king bitterli and long to cast off hi yoke
for my part i receiv the command of the bodyguard of peroa in which
were mani greek and a generalship in the armi while to be at my
prayer wa given the freedom of the land which he accept with a
smile he who wa a king in hi own countri
at length all wa finish and i went out into the palac garden to rest
myself befor i rode into the desert to see my great uncl the holi
tanofir i wa alon for be had gone to bring our hors on which we
were to ride and sat myself down beneath a palmtre think of the
great adventur on which we had enter with a merri heart for i love
adventur
next i thought of amada and wa less merri then i look up and lo
she stood befor me unaccompani and wear the dress not of a
priestess but of an egyptian ladi with the littl circlet of her rank
upon her hair i rose and bow to her and we began to walk togeth
beneath the palm my heart beat hard within me for i knew that my
hour had come to speak
yet it wa she who spoke the first sai
i hear that you have been plai a high part shabaka and do great
thing for egypt
for egypt and for you who ar egypt i answer
so i should have been call in the old dai cousin becaus of my
blood and the rank it give though now i am but as ani other ladi of
the land
and so you shall be call in dai to come amada if my sword and wit
can win their wai
how so cousin see that you have promis certain thing to my
uncl peroa and hi son
i have promis those thing amada and i will abid by my promis
but the god ar abov all and who know what thei mai decre
ye cousin the god ar abov all and in their hand we will let
these matter rest provok them in no manner and least of all by
treacheri to our oath
we walk for a littl wai in silenc then i spoke
amada there ar more thing than throne in the world
ye cousin there is that in which all throne enddeath which it
seem we court
and amada there is that in which all throne beginlov which i
court from you
i have known it long she said consid me grave and been
grate to you who ar more to me than ani man ha been or ever will
be but shabaka i am a priestess bound to set the holi on i serv
abov a mortal
that holi on wa wed and bore a child amada who aveng hi father
as i trust that we shall aveng egypt therefor she look with a kind
ey upon wive and mother also you have not taken your final vow and
can be absolv
ye she said softli
then amada will you give yourself into my keep
i think so shabaka though it ha been in my mind for long as you
know well to give myself onli to learn and the servic of the
heavenli ladi my heart call me to you it is true dai and night it
call how loudli i will not tell yet i would not yield myself to that
alon but egypt call me also sinc i have been shown in a dream while
i watch in the sanctuari that you ar the onli man who can free her
and i think that thi dream came from on high therefor i will give
myself but not yet
not yet i said dismai when
when i have been absolv from my vow which must be done on the night
of the next new moon which is twentyseven dai from thi then if
noth come between us dure those twentyseven dai it shall be
announc that the royal ladi of egypt is to wed the nobl shabaka
twentyseven dai in such time much mai happen in them amada still
except death what can come between us
i know of noth shabaka whose past is shadowless as the noon
or i either i repli
now we were stand in the clear sunlight but as i said the word a
wind stir the palmtre and the shadow from on of them fell full
upon me and she who wa veri quick note it
some might take that for an omen she said with a littl laugh
point to the line of the shadow oh shabaka if you have aught
to confess sai it now and i will forgiv it but do not leav me to
discov it afterward when i mai not forgiv perchanc dure your
journei in the east
noth noth i exclaim joyfulli who dure all that time had
scarc spoken to a youth woman
i am glad that noth happen in the east that could separ us
shabaka though in truth my thought wa not your own for there ar more
thing than women in the world onli it seem strang to me that you
should return to egypt laden with such priceless gift from him who is
egypt greatest enemi
have i not told you that i put my countri befor myself those gift
were won fairli in a wager amada whereof you heard the stori but last
night moreov you know the purpos to which thei ar to be put i
repli indignantli
ye i know and now i am sure be not angri shabaka with her who
love you truli and hope er long to call you husband but till that
dai take it not amiss if i keep somewhat aloof from you who must break
with the past and learn to face a futur of which i did not dream
for the rest she stretch out her hand and i kiss it for while she
wa still a priestess her lip she would not suffer me to touch anoth
moment and smile happili she had glide awai leav me alon in the
garden
then it wa for the first time that i bethought me of the warn of
be and rememb that it wa i not he who had told the great
king the name of the most beauti woman in egypt although in all
innoc ye i rememb and felt as if all the shadow on the
earth had wrap me round i thought of find her but she had gone
whither i knew not in that great palac so i determin that the next
time we were alon i would tell her of the matter explain all and
with thi thought i comfort myself who did not know that until mani
dai were past we should be alon no more
after thi i went home and told my mother all my joi for in truth there
wa no happier man in egypt she listen then answer smile a
littl
when your father wish to take me to wife shabaka it wa not my hand
that i gave him to kiss and as you know i too have the blood of king
in me but then i wa not a priestess of isi so doubtless all is well
onli in twentyseven dai much mai happen as you said to amada now i
wonder why did she well no matter sinc priestess ar not like
other women who onli think of the man thei have won and of naught befor
or after the bless of the god and mine be on you both my son and
she went awai to attend to her household matter
as we rode to sekera to find the holi tanofir i told be also ad
that i had forgotten to reveal that it wa i who had spoken amada name
to the king but that i intend to do so er long
be roll hi ey and answer
if i were you master as i had forgotten i should continu to forget
for what is welcom in on hour is not alwai welcom in anoth why
speak of the matter at all which is on hard to explain to a woman
howev wise and royal i have alreadi said that i spoke the name to
the king and that you were brought from the boat to sai whether i wa
note for my truth is not that enough
while i consid be went on
you mai rememb master that when i told wellth truth about thi
stori the ladi amada ask earnestli that i should be scourg even
to the bone now if you should tell anoth truth which will make mine
dull as tarnish silver she will not leav me even my bone for i
shall be prove a liar and what will happen to you i am sure i do
not know and master as i am no longer a slave here in egypt to sai
noth of what i mai be elsewher i have no fanci for scourg who
mai not kiss the hand that smite me as you can
but be i said what is is and mai alwai be learn in thi wai
or in that
master if what is were alwai learn i think the world would fall
to piec or at least there would be no men left on it why should
thi matter be learn it is known to you and me alon leav out the
great king who probabl ha forgotten as he wa drunk at the time oh
master when you have neither bow nor spear at hand it is not wise
to kick a sleep lion in the stomach for then he will rememb it
empti and sup off you besid when first i told you that tale
i made a mistak i did tell the great king as i now rememb quit
clearli that the beauti ladi wa name amada and he onli sent for
you to ask if i spoke the truth
be i exclaim you worshipp of the grasshopp wear virtu
easili
easili as an old sandal master or rather not at all sinc the
grasshopp ha need of none for ag thei have studi the wai of
those who worship the god of egypt and from them have learn
what
amongst other thing master that woman be modest is shock at
the sight of the nake truth
chapter xi the holi tanofir
we enter the citi of grave that is call sekera in the centr
tower pyramid that hid the bone of ancient and forgotten king
and everywher around upon the desert sand wa street upon street of
monument but save for a priest or two hurri to patter hi paid

look about him and snif with hi wide nostril
is there not death enough in the world master he ask that the
live should wish to proclaim it in thi fashion roll it on their
tongu like a morsel thei ar loth to swallow becaus it tast so
good oh what a wast is here all these have had their dai and yet
thei need hous and pyramid and paint chamber in which to sleep
wherea if thei believ the faith thei practis thei would have been

doorwai
a littl wai down the passag wa a nich in which stood three lamp
readi light on of these she took and gave the other to us then we
follow her down a steep inclin of mani step till at length we

spoke in a low whisper our guid overheard him and turn answer
thi is the burial place of the api bull see here li the last

sarcophagu of black granit set in a nich of the mausoleum
so thei make mummi of bull as well as of men groan be oh
what a land but when i have seen the holi tanofir it wa in a brick
cell beneath the sky
doubtless that wa at night o be answer karema for in such a
hous he sleep spend hi dai in the api tomb becaus of all the
evil that is work beneath the sun
hump said be i should have thought that more wa work beneath
the moon but doubtless the holi tanofir know better or be asleep
doe not mind
now in front of each of the walledup nich wa a littl chapel and at
the fourth of these whenc a light came the maiden stop sai
enter here dwell the holi tanofir he tend thi god dure it

ceas from talk folli o shabaka and be and enter said the
tremend voic from within
so we enter and saw a strang sight against the back wall of the
chapel which wa lit with lamp stood a lifes statu of maat
goddess of law and truth fashion of alabast on her head wa a tall
feather her hair wa cover with a wig on her neck lai a collar of
blue stone on her arm and wrist were bracelet of gold a tight robe
drape her bodi in her right hand that hung down by her side she held
the loop cross of life and in her left which wa advanc a long
lotushead sceptr while her paint ey stare fixedli at the
dark crouch upon the ground at the feet of the statu scribe
fashion sat my greatuncl tanofir a veri ag man with sightless
ey and long hand so thin that on might see through them against the
lampflam hi head wa shaven hi beard wa long and white white too
wa hi robe in front of him wa a low altar on which stood a shallow
silver vessel fill with pure water and on either side of it a burn
lamp
we knelt down befor him or rather i knelt for be threw himself flat
upon hi face
am i the king of king whom you have so late visit that you should
prostrat yourselv befor me said tanofir in hi great voic which
come from so frail and ag a man seem most unnatur or is it
to the goddess of truth beyond that you bow yourselv if so that is
well sinc on if not both of you greatli need her pardon and her
help or is it to the sleep god beyond who hold the whole world on
hi horn or is it to the dark of thi hallow place which caus
you to rememb the near of the await tomb
nai my uncl i said we would greet you no more who ar so worthi
of our vener see we believ both of us that you save us
yonder in the east from that tomb of which you speak or rather from
the jaw of lion or a cruel death by torment
perchanc i did i or the god of which i am the instrument at least i
rememb that i sent you certain messag in answer to a prayer for help
that reach me here in my dark for know that sinc we part i
have gone quit blind so that i must us thi maiden ey to read what
is written in yonder diviningcup well it make the dark of thi
sepulchr easier to bear and prepar me for my own ti full a hundr
and twenti year sinc first i look upon the light and now the time
of sleep draw near come hither my nephew and kiss me on the brow
rememb in your strength that a dai will dawn when as i am so shall
you be if the god spare you so long
so i kiss him not without fear for the old man wa unearthli then
he sent karema from the place and bade me tell him my stori which i
did why he did thi i cannot sai sinc he seem to know it alreadi
and onc or twice correct me in certain matter that i had forgotten
for instanc as to the exact word that i had us to the great king in
my rage and as to the fashion in which i wa ti in the boat when i
had done he said
so you gave the name of amada to the great king did you well
you could have done noth els if you wish to go on live and
therefor cannot be blame yet befor all is finish i think it will
bring you into troubl shabaka sinc among mani gift the god did
not give that of reason to women if so bear it sinc it is better to
have troubl and be aliv than to have none and be dead that is for
those whose work is still to do in the world and you or rather be
stole the white signet of signet of which although it is so simpl and
ancient there is not the like for power in the whole world that
wa well done sinc it will be us for a while and now peroa ha
determin to rebel against the king which also is well done oh
troubl not to tell me of that busi for i know all but what would
you learn of me shabaka
i am instruct to learn from you the end of these great matter my
uncl

call the maiden he said
so be went out and brought her in
be seat karema there in front of the altar and look into my ey
she obei and present seem to go to sleep for her head nod then
he said

what you see
she appear to wake though i perceiv that thi wa not realli so
for she seem a differ woman with a fix face that frighten me
and wide and frozen ey she stare into the silver bowl then spoke in
a new voic as though some spirit us her tongu
i see myself crown a queen in a land i hate she said coldli a
sai at which i gasp i am seat on a throne besid yonder dwarf
a sai at which be gasp although so hideou thi dwarf is a
great man with a good heart a cun mind and the courag of a lion
also hi blood is royal
here be roll hi ey and smile but tanofir did not seem in the
least astonish and said
much of thi is known to me and the rest can be guess pass on to
what will happen in egypt befor the spirit leav you
there will be war in egypt she answer i see fight shabaka
and other lead the egyptian the eastern ar driven awai or slain
peroa rule as pharaoh i see him on hi throne shabaka is driven awai

the head of a great armi of black men arm with bow with them i come
rejoic for my heart seem to shine he reach a templ on the nile
about which is camp anoth great armi a countless armi of eastern
under the command of the king of king shabaka and the dwarf give
battl to that armi and the frai is desper thei destroi it thei
drive it into the nile the nile run red with blood the great king
fall an arrow from the bow of shabaka is in hi heart he enter
the templ a conqueror and there li peroa dy or dead a veil
priestess is there befor an imag i cannot see her face shabaka look
on her she stretch out her arm to him her ey burn with woman
love her breast heav and abov the imag frown and threaten all
is done for tanofir master of spirit you die yonder in the templ
on the nile and therefor i can see no more the power that come
through you ha left me
then onc more she becam as a woman asleep
you have heard shabaka and be said tanofir quietli and stroke hi
long white beard and what that maiden seem to read in the water you
mai believ or disbeliev as you will
what do you believ o holi tanofir i ask
the onli part of the stori whereof i am sure he repli evad a
direct answer is that which said that i shall die and that when i
am dead i shall no longer be abl to caus the maiden karema to see
vision for the rest i do not know these thing mai happen or thei mai
not but he ad with a note of warn in hi voic whether thei
happen or not my counsel to you both is that you sai noth of them
beforehand
what then shall we report to those who bid me seek the oracl of your
wisdom o tanofir
you can tell them that my wisdom declar that the omen were mix
with good and evil but that time would show the truth hush now the
maiden is about to awak and must not be frighten also it is time for
me to be led from thi sepulchr to where i sleep for i think that ra
ha set and i am weari oh shabaka why do you seek to peer into the
futur which from dai to dai will unrol itself as doe a scroll be
content with the present man and take what fate give you of good or
ill not seek to learn what offer he hide beneath hi robe in
the dai and the year and the centuri to come
yet you have sought to learn those thing o tanofir and not in vain
ay and what have thei made of me a blind old hermit weigh down with
the weight of year and hold in my finger but some few thread that
with pain and grief i have pluck from the fring of wisdom robe be
warn by me nephew while you ar a man live the life of a man and
when you becom a spirit live the life of a spirit but do not seek to
mix the two togeth like oil and wine and thu spoil both i am glad
to learn o be that you ar go to make a king or a slave wife
whichev it mai be of thi maiden see that i love her well and
hold thi trade unwholesom for her she will be better bear babe
than read vision in a divin cup and i will prai the god that
thei mai not be dwarf as you ar but take on the like of their
mother who tell me that she is fair hush she stir
karema ar you awak good then lead me from the sepulchr that i
mai make my even prayer beneath the star go shabaka and be you
ar brave men both of you and i am glad to have the on for nephew
and the other for pupil my greet to your mother tiu she is a good
woman and a true on to whom you will do well to hearken to the ladi
amada also and bid her studi her beauteou face in a mirror and not be
holi overmuch sinc too great holi often thwart itself and end in
troubl for the unholi flesh still she love pearl like other women
doe she not and even the statu of isi like to be adorn as for
you be though i think that is not your name do not lie except when
you ar oblig for juggler who plai with too mani knive ar apt
to cut their finger also give no more evil counsel to your master
on matter that have to do with woman now farewel let me hear how
fortun favour you from time to time shabaka for you take part in a
great game such as i love in my youth befor i becam a holi hermit
oh if thei had listen to me thing would have been differ in
egypt todai but it wa written otherwis and as ever women were the
scribe good night good night good night i am glad that my thought
reach you yonder in the east and taught you what to sai and do it
is well to be wise sometim for other sake but not for our own oh
not for our own
master said be as we ambl homeward beneath the star the holi
tanofir is a man for thought to feed on sinc have climb to the
topmost peak of holi he doe not seem to like it cold air and
warn off those who would follow in hi footstep
then he might have spare himself the pain in your case be or in my
own for that matter sinc we shall never come so high
no master and i am glad to have hi leav to stai lower down sinc
that hot place of dead bull is not on which i wish to inhabit in my
ag make us of a maiden to stare into a pot of water and there read
marvel which i could invent better for myself after a jug or two of
wine oh the holi tanofir is quit right if these thing ar go
to happen let them happen for we cannot chang them by know of them
beforehand who wish to know master if hi throat will be cut
or that he will be marri i suggest
just so master see that such propheci end in becom truth
becaus we make them true feel that we must thu now i must marri
yonder karema if she will marri me for fear lest i should prove the holi
tanofir to be what he call mea liar
i laugh and then ask be if he had taken note of what the seeress
said of our flight south and our return thenc with a great armi of
black men arm with bow
ye master he answer grave and i think thi armi can be none
other than that of the ethiopian of whom by right i am the king thi
veri night i send messeng to tell those who rule in my place that i
still live and am chang my mind on the matter of marriag also that
if i do chang it i mai return to them the wisest man who ever wore the
crown of ethiopia have journei all about the world and collect
much knowledg
perhap be those who rule in your place mai not wish to give it up
to you perhap thei will kill you
have no fear master as i have told you the ethiopian ar a faith
peopl moreov thei know that such a deed would bring the curs of the
grasshopp on them sinc then the locust would appear and eat up all
their land and when thei were starv their enemi would attack them
lastli thei ar a veri tall folk and simplemind and would not wish
to miss the chanc of be rule over by the wisest dwarf in all the
world if onli becaus it would be someth new to them master
again i laugh think that be wa jest accord to hi fashion
but when that night chanc to go round the corner of the hous i
came upon him with a circlet of feather round hi head and hi big bow
in hi hand address three great black men who knelt befor him as
though he were a god i chang my mind as i withdrew he caught sight
of me and said
i prai you my lord shabaka stai on moment then he spoke to the
three men in hi own languag translat sentenc by sentenc to me
what he said to them briefli it wa thi
sai to the lord and councillor of the ancient kingdom that i the
karoon for such it seem wa hi titl have a friend name the lord
shabaka he whom you see befor you who again and again ha save my
life nurs me in hi arm as a mother nurs her babe and who is
after me the bravest and the wisest man in all the world sai to them
that if inde i doubl myself by marriag and return have fulfil
the law i will beg thi mighti princ to accompani me and that if he
consent that will be the most joy dai which the ethiopian have seen
for a thousand year sinc he will teach them wisdom and lead their
armi in great and gloriou battl let the priest of the grasshopp
prai therefor that he mai consent to do so now salut the mighti lord
shabaka who can send on arrow through all three of you and two more
behind and depart tarri not dai or night till you reach the land
of ethiopia then when you have deliv the messag of karoon to the
captain and the councillor return or let other return and seek me
out wherev i mai be bring of the gold of ethiopia and other gift
togeth with their answer see that i and the lord shabaka who have
the world beneath our feet will not come to a land where we ar not
welcom
so these great men salut me as though i were the king of king
himself after which thei rub their forehead in the dust befor be
said someth which i did not understand leapt to their feet cry
karoon and sprang awai into the night
it is good to have been a slave master said be when thei had gone
sinc it teach on that it is even better to be a king at least
sometim
here i mai add that dure the dai which follow be wa often absent
when i ask him where he had gone he would answer to drink in the
wisdom of the holi tanofir by help of a certain silver vessel that the
maiden karema held to hi lip from all of which i gather that he wa
woo the ladi who had call herself the cup of tanofir and wonder
how the busi went though as he said no more i did not ask him
inde i had littl time to talk with be about such light matter
sinc thing move apac in memphi within six dai all the great lord
left in upper egypt were sworn to the revolt under the leadership of
peroa and hour by hour their vassal or hire mercenari flow into
the citi these it wa my duti to weld into an armi and at thi task i
toil without ceas separ them into regiment and drill them
also arrang for the arm and victual of the boat of war then
new came that idern wa advanc from sai with a great forc of
eastern all the garrison of lower egypt inde as hi messeng
said to answer the summon convei to him under the privat seal of
seal
of amada dure thi time i saw littl onli meet her now and again
at the tabl of peroa or elsewher in public for the rest it pleas
her to keep awai from me onc or twice i tri to find her alon onli
to discov that she wa engag in the servic of the goddess onc
too as she left peroa tabl i whisper into her ear that i wish
to speak with her but she shook her head sai
after the new moon shabaka then you shall speak with me as much as
you wish
thu it came about that never could i find opportun to tell her of
that matter of what had happen at the court of the great king still
everi morn she sent me some token flower or trifl gift and
onc a ring that must have belong to her forefath sinc on it
bezel wa engrav the royal uru togeth with the sign of long
life and health which ring i wore hung about my neck but not upon my
finger fear lest that emblem of royalti might offend peroa or some
of hi hous if thei chanc to see it so in answer i also sent her
flower and other gift and for the rest wa content to wait
all of which thing my mother note with a smile sai that the ladi
amada show a wonder discret such as ani man would valu in
a wife of so much beauti which also must be most pleas to her
mistress the goddess isi to thi i answer that i valu it less as
a lover than i might do as a husband my mother smile again and spoke
of someth els
thu thing went on while the stormcloud gather over egypt
on night i could not sleep it wa that of the new moon and i knew that
dure those hour of dark befor the solemn conclav of the high
priest with pomp and ceremoni in the sanctuari of the templ amada
had undergon absolut of her vow to isi and been given liberti
to wed as other women do inde my mother in virtu of her rank as a
singer of amen had been present at the rite and return told me all
that happen
she describ how amada had appear clad as a priestess how she had
put up her prayer to the four high priest seat in state demand to
be loos from her vow for the sake of her heart and of egypt
then on of the high priest he of amen i think as the chief of them
all had advanc to the statu of the goddess isi and whisper the
prayer to it whereon after a paus the goddess nod thrice in the
sight of all present therebi signifi her assent thi done the high
priest return and proclaim the absolut in the ancient word for
the sake of the suppliant heart and of egypt and with it the bless
of the goddess on her union ad howev the formula at thy
prayer daughter and spous i the goddess isi cut the rope that
bind thee to me on earth yet if thou shouldst tie it again know that
it mai never more be sever for if thou strivest so to do it shall
strangl thee in whatev shape thou livest on the earth throughout the
gener and with thee the man thou choosest and those who give thee
to him thu saith isi the queen of heaven
what doe that mean i ask my mother
it mean my son that if have broken her vow to isi a woman
should repeat them and onc more enter the servic of the goddess and
then for the second time seek to break them she and the man for whom
she did thi thing would be like fli in a spider web and that not
onli in thi life but in ani other that mai be given to them in the
world
it seem that isi ha a long arm i said
without doubt a veri long arm my son sinc isi by whatev name she
is call is a power that doe not die or forget
well mother in thi case she can have no reason to rememb sinc
never again will amada be her priestess
i think not shabaka yet who can be sure of what a woman will or will
not do now or hereaft for my part i am glad that i have serv amen
and not isi and that after i wa wed
chapter xii the slai of idern
whilst i wa still talk to my mother i receiv an urgent summon to
the palac i went and in a littl antechamb met amada alon who
i could see wa wait there for me she wa arrai in her secular
dress and wore the insignia of royalti look exceedingli beauti
moreov her whole aspect had chang for now she wa no longer a
priestess sworn to mysteri but just a love and a love woman
it is done shabaka she whisper and thou art mine and i am
thine
then i open my arm and she sank upon my breast and for the first time
i kiss her on the lip kiss her mani time and oh my heart almost
burst with joi but all too fleet wa that sweet moment of love
first fruit whereon i had sown the seed so mani year ago for while
we yet clung togeth whisper sweet thing into each other ear
i heard a voic call me and wa forc to go awai befor i had even
time to ask when we might be wed
within the council wa gather the new befor it wa that the satrap
idern lai camp upon the nile with some ten thousand men not far
from the great pyramid that is within strike distanc of memphi
moreov hi messeng announc that he purpos to visit the princ
peroa that dai with a small guard onli to inquir into thi matter of
the signet for which visit he demand a safeconduct sworn in the
name of the great king and in those of the god of egypt and the
east fail thi he would at onc attack memphi notwithstand
ani command that might be given him under the signet which until he
beheld it with hi own ey he believ to be a forgeri
the question waswhat answer should be sent to him the debat that
follow prove long and earnest some were in favour of attack
idern at onc although hi camp wa report to be strongli entrench
and flank on on side by the nile and on the other by the rise
ground whereon stood the great sphinx and the pyramid other among
whom i wa number thought otherwis for i hold that some evil god
led me to give counsel that dai which if it were good for egypt wa
most ill for my own fortun perchanc thi god wa isi angri at the
loss of her votari
i point out that by receiv idern peroa would gain time which
would enabl a bodi of three thousand men if not more who were
advanc down the nile to join us befor thei were perhap cut off
from the citi and thu give us a forc as larg as hi or larger also
i show that have summon idern under the signet we should put
ourselv in the wrong if we refus to receiv him and instead attack
him at onc
a third parti wa in favour of allow him to enter memphi with hi
guard and then make him prison or kill him as to thi i point
out again that not onli would it involv the break of a solemn oath
which might bring the curs of the god upon our caus and proclaim us
traitor to the world but it would also be foolish sinc idern wa
not the onli gener of the eastern and if we cut off him and hi
escort it would avail us littl for then the rest of the eastern would
fight in a just caus
so in the end it wa agre that the safeconduct should be sent and
that peroa should receiv idern that veri dai at a great feast given
in hi honour accordingli it wa sent in the ancient form the oath
be taken befor the messeng that neither he nor those with him
who must not number more than twenti men would be harm in memphi and
that he would be guard on the road back until he reach the outpost
of hi own camp
thi done i wa despatch up the nile bank in a chariot accompani
onli by be to hurri on the march of those troop of which i have
spoken so that thei might reach memphi by sundown befor i went
howev i had some word alon with peroa he told me that my immedi
marriag with the ladi amada would be announc at the feast that night
thereon i prai him to deliv to amada the rope of priceless rosehu
pearl which wa in hi keep as my betroth gift with the prayer
that she would wear them at the feast for my sake there wa no time for
more
the journei up nile prove long for the road wa bad be cover with
drift sand in some place and deep in mud from the inund water
in other at length i found the troop just start forward after
their rest and rejoic to see that there were more of them than i
had thought i told the case to their captain who promis to make a
forc march and to be in memphi two hour befor midnight
as we drove back be said to me suddenli
do you know why you could not find me thi morn
i answer that i did not
becaus a good slave should alwai run a pace ahead of hi master to
clear the road and tell him of it pitfal i wa be marri the
cup of the holi tanofir is now by law and right queen of the ethiopian
so when you meet her again you must treat her with great respect as i
do alreadi
inde be i said laugh and how did you manag that busi
you must have woo her well dure these dai which have been so full
for both of us
i did not woo her over much master inde the time wa lack i
woo the holi tanofir which wa more import
the holi tanofir be i exclaim
ye master you see thi beauti cup of hi is after allhi
beauti cup her mind is the shadow of hi mind and from her he pour
out hi wisdom so i told him all the case at first he wa angri for
notwithstand the word he spoke to you and me when it came to a
point the holi tanofir be after all much like other men did not
wish to lose hi cup inde had he been a few score of year younger
i am not sure but that he would have forgotten some of hi holi
becaus of her still he came to see matter in the true light at
lastfor your sake master not for mine sinc hi wisdom told him
it wa need that i should becom king of the ethiopian again to do
which i must be marri at ani rate he work upon the mind of that cup
of hishav first settl that she should procur a younger sister of
her own to fill her placein such fashion that when at length i spoke
to her on the matter she did not sai no
no doubt becaus she wa fond of you for yourself be a woman would
not marri even to pleas the holi tanofir
oh master he repli in a new voic a veri sad voic i would
that i could think so but look at me a misshapen dwarf accurs from
birth could a fair ladi like thi karema wed such a on for hi own
sake
well be there might be other reason besid the holi tanofir i
said hurriedli
master there were no other reason unless the cup when it is awak
rememb what it ha held in tranc which i do not believ i woo
her as i wa not tell her that i am also king of the ethiopian or
ani more than i seem to be moreov the holi tanofir told her noth
for he swore as much to me and he doe not lie
and what did she sai to you be i ask for i wa curiou
she li fast enough master she saidwel what she said when first
we met her that there wa more in me than the ey saw and that she who
had live so much with spirit look to the spirit rather than to the
flesh and that dwarf or no she love me and desir noth better than
to marri me and be my true and faith wife and helpmeet she li so
well that onc or twice almost i believ her at ani rate i took her
at her word not altogeth for myself believ me master but becaus
without doubt what the holi tanofir ha shown us will come to pass and
it is necessari to you that i should be marri
you marri her to help me be
that is so masteraft all but a littl thing see that she is
beauti well born and veri pleasant and i am fond of her also i do
her no wrong for she ha bought more than she bargain for and if she
ha ani that ar not dwarf her children mai be king i do not think
he ad reflect that even the faith ethiopian could accept
a second dwarf as their king on is veri well for a chang but not two
or three the stomach of a tall peopl would turn against them
i took bess hand and press it understand the depth of hi
love and sacrific also some spiritdoubtless it came from the holi
tanofirmov me to sai
be comfort be for i am sure of thi your children will be strong
and straight and tall more so than ani of their forefath that went
befor them
thi inde prove to be the case for their father deform wa but
an accid not born in hi blood
those ar goodomen word master for which i thank you though the
holi tanofir said the like when he wed us with the sacr word thi
morn and gave us hi bless endow my wife with certain gift of
secret wisdom which he said would be of us to her and me

ye be but be newli marri you will do well to leav it to
other
no no master battl is better than wive moreov could you think
that i would leav you to stand alon in the frai why if i did and harm
came to you i should die of shame or hang myself and then karema would
never be a queen so both her trade would be gone sinc after marriag
she cannot be a cup and her heart would break but here ar the gate
of memphi so we will forget love and think of war
an hour later i and my mother the ladi tiu stood in the banquet
hall of the palac with mani other and learn that the satrap idern
and hi escort had reach memphi and would be present at the feast a
while later trumpet blew and a glitter process enter the hall
at the head of it wa peroa who led idern by the hand thi eastern
wa a big strong man with tire and anxiou ey such as i had note
were common among the servant of the great king who from dai to dai
never knew whether thei would fill a satrapi or a grave he wa clad in
gorgeou silk and wore a cap upon hi head in which shone a jewel but
beneath hi robe i caught the glint of mail
as he came into the hall and note the number and qualiti of the guest
and the stir and the expect look upon their face he start as
though he were afraid but recov himself murmur some courteou
word to hi host and advanc toward the seat of honour which wa
point out to him upon the princ right after these two follow the
wife of peroa with her son and daughter then walk alon in token
of her high rank appear amada the royal ladi of egypt wonderfulli
arrai now howev she wore no emblem of royalti either becaus it
wa not thought wise that these should be shown in the presenc of the
satrap or becaus she wa about to be given in marriag to on who wa
not royal inde as i note with joi her onli ornament wa the rope
of rosehu pearl which were arrang in a doubl row upon her breast
she search me out with her ey smile touch the pearl with her
finger and pass on to her place next to the daughter of peroa at
on end of the head tabl which wa shape like a hors hoof
after her came the nobl who had accompani idern grave eastern
men on of these a tall captain with ey like a hawk seem familiar
to me nor wa i mistaken for be who stood behind me and whose
busi it would be to wait on me at the feast whisper in my ear
note that man he wa present when you were brought befor the great
king from the boat and saw and heard all that pass
then i wish he were absent now i whisper back for at the word a
sudden fear shot through me of what i could not sai
by degre all were seat in their appoint place mine wa by that
of my mother at a long tabl that stood as it were across the end of
the high tabl but at a littl distanc from them so that i wa almost
opposit to peroa and idern and could see amada although she wa too
far awai for me to be abl to speak to her
the feast began and at first wa somewhat heavi and silent sinc save
for the talk of courtesi none spoke much at length wine whereof i
note that idern drank a good deal as did hi escort but peroa and
the egyptian littl loosen men tongu and thei grew merrier
for it wa the custom of the peopl of the great king to discuss both
privat and public busi when full of strong drink but of the
egyptian when thei were quit sober thi wa well known to peroa and
mani of us especi to myself who had been among them which wa on
of the reason why idern had been ask to meet us at a feast where
we might have the advantag of him in debat
present the satrap note the splendid cup from which he drank and
ask some question concern it of the hawkei nobl of whom i have
spoken when it had been answer he said in a voic loud enough for me
to overhear
tell me o princ peroa wa thi cup ever that of the great king which
it so much resembl
so i understand o idern answer peroa that is until it becam
mine by gift from the lord shabaka who receiv it from the great
king
an express of horror appear upon the face of the satrap and upon
those of hi nobl
sure he answer thi shabaka must hold the king favour
lightli if he pass them on thu to the firstcom at the least let
not the vessel which ha been hallow by the lip of the king of king
be dishonour by the humblest of hi servant i prai you o princ
that i mai be given anoth cup
so a new goblet wa brought to him peroa try to pass the matter off
as a jest by appeal to me to tell the stori of the cup then i said
while all listen
o princ the most high satrap is mistaken the king of king did not
give me the cup i bought it from him in exchang for a certain famou
bow and therefor held it not wrong to pass it on to you my lord
idern made no answer and seem to forget the matter
a while later howev hi ey fell upon amada and the rosehu pearl
she wore and again he ask a question of the hawkei captain then
said
think me not discourt o princ if i seem to look upon yonder
love ladi which in our countri where women do not appear in public
we should think it an insult to do but on her fair breast i see certain
pearl like to some that ar known throughout the world which for mani
year have been worn by those who sit upon the throne of the east i
would ask if thei ar the same or other
i do not know o idern answer peroa i onli know that the
lord shabaka brought them from the east inquir of him if it be your
pleasur
shabaka again began idern but i cut him short sai
ye o satrap shabaka again i won those pearl in a bet from the
great king and with them a certain weight of gold thi i think you
knew befor sinc your messeng of a while ago wa whip for
try to steal them which under the rod he said he did by command o
satrap
to thi bold speech idern made no answer onli hi captain frown
and mani of the egyptian murmur approv
after thi the feast went on without further incid for a while
the eastern alwai drink more wine till at length the tabl were
clear and all of the meaner sort depart from the hall save the
butler and the person servant such as be who stood behind the
seat of their master there came a silenc such as preced the
burst of a storm and in the midst of it idern spoke somewhat
thickli
i did not come here o peroa he said from the seat of govern
at sai to eat your meat and drink your wine i came to speak of high
matter with you
it is so o satrap answer peroa and now what mai be your will
would you retir to discuss them with me and my councillor
where is the need o peroa see that i have naught to sai which mai
not be heard by all
as it pleas you speak on o satrap
i have been summon here princ peroa by a write under what seem
to be the signet of signetsth ancient white seal that for gener
unknown ha been worn by the forefath of the king of king where is
thi signet
here said the princ open hi robe look on it satrap and let
your lord look but let none of you dare to touch it
idern look long and earnestli and so did some of hi peopl
especi the lord with the hawk ey then thei stare at each other
bewild and whisper togeth
it seem to be the veri sealth white seal itself exclaim idern
at length tell me now peroa how came thi sacr thing that dwell
in the east hither into egypt
the lord shabaka brought it to me with certain letter from the great
king o satrap
shabaka for the third time by the holi fire cri idern he
brought the cup he brought the famou pearl he brought the gold and
he brought the signet of signet what is there then that he did not
bring perchanc he ha the person of the king of king himself in hi
keep

seal and draw a roll from hi breast peroa laid it on hi brow and
cast it down befor idern ad
obei the write and the signet or by virtu of my commiss as soon
as you ar return to your armi and your safeconduct is expir i
fall upon you and destroi you
idern look about him like a wolf in a trap then ask
do you mean to murder me here
not so answer peroa for you have our safeconduct and egyptian

leav egypt
idern thought a littl while then said
if i leav egypt there is at least on whom i am command to take
with me under order and write that you will not disput a maiden
name amada whom the great king would number among hi women i am told
it is she who sit yondera jewel inde fair as the pearl upon her
breast which thu will return into the king keep let her be hand
over for she ride with me at onc
now in the midst of an intens silenc peroa answer
amada the royal ladi of egypt cannot be sent to dwell in the hous of
women of the great king without the consent of the lord shabaka whose
she is
shabaka for the fourth time said idern glare at me then let
shabaka come too or hi head in a basket will suffic sinc that will
save troubl afterward also some pain to shabaka why now i rememb
it wa thi veri shabaka whom the great king condemn to death by
the boat for a crime against hi majesti and who bought hi life by
promis to deliv to him the fairest and most learn woman in the
worldth ladi amada of egypt and thu doe the knave keep hi oath
now i leapt to my feet as did most of those present onli amada kept
her seat and look at me
you lie i cri and were it not for your safeconduct i would kill
you for the lie
i lie do i sneer idern speak then you who were present and
tell thi nobl compani whether i lie and he point to the hawkei
lord
he doe not lie said the captain i wa in the court of the great
king and heard yonder shabaka purchas pardon by promis to hand over
hi cousin the ladi amada to the king the pearl were entrust to
him as a gift to her and i see she wear them the gold also of which
mention ha been made wa to provid for her journei in state to the
east or so i heard the cup wa hi guerdon also a sum for hi own
purs
it is fals i shout the name of amada slip my lip by
chanceno more
so it slip your lip by chanc did it sneer idern now if
you ar wise you will suffer the ladi amada to slip your hand and not
by chanc but let us have done with thi cun knave princ will
you hand over yonder fair woman or will you not
satrap i will not answer peroa the demand is an insult put
forward to forc us to rebellion sinc there is no man in egypt who
will not be readi to die in defenc of the royal ladi of egypt
thi statement wa receiv with a shout of applaus by everi egyptian
in the hall idern wait until it had di awai then said
princ peroa and egyptian you have convei to me certain command
seal with the signet of signet which i think wa stolen by yonder
shabaka now hearken until thi matter is made clear i will obei those
command thu far i will return with my armi to sai and there wait
until i have receiv the order of the great king after report made to
him if so much as an arrow is shot at us on our march it will be open
rebellion as the price of which egypt shall be crush as she wa never
crush befor and everi on of you here present shall lose hi head
save onli the ladi amada who is the properti of the great king now i
thank you for your hospit and demand that you escort me and those
with me back to my camp sinc it seem that here we ar in the midst of
enemi
befor you go idern i shout know that you and your ly
captain shall pai with your live for your slander on me
mani will pai with their live for thi night work o thief of pearl
and seal answer the satrap and turn left the hall with hi
compani
now i search for amada but she also had gone with the ladi of
peroa household who fear lest the feast should end in blow and
bloodsh also lest she should be snatch awai inde of all the
women in the hall onli my mother remain
search out the ladi amada i said to her and tell her the truth
ye my son she answer thoughtfulli but what is the truth i
understood it wa be who first gave the name of the ladi amada to the
great king now we learn from your own lip that it wa you wise would
you have been my son if you had bitten out your tongu befor you said
it sinc thi is a matter that ani woman mai well misunderstand
her name wa surpris out of me mother it wa be who spoke to the
king of the beauti of a certain ladi of egypt
and i think my son it wa be who told peroa and hi guest that he
and not you had given the king her name which you do not seem to have
deni well doubtless both of you ar to blame for foolish no
more sinc well i know that you would have di ten time over rather
than bui your life at the price of the honour of the ladi of egypt thi
i will sai to her as soon as i mai prai that it mai not be too late
and afterward you shall tell me everyth which you would have done
well to do at first if be as i think had not been over cun after
the fashion of black peopl and counsel you otherwis see peroa
call you and i must go for there ar greater matter afoot than that
of who let slip the name of the ladi amada to the king of king
so she went and there follow a swift council of war the question
be whether we were to strike at the satrap armi or to allow it to
retreat to sai in my turn i wa ask for my judgment of the issu
and answer
strike and at onc sinc we cannot hope to storm sai which is far
awai moreov such strength as we have is now gather and if it is
idl and perhap unpaid will dispers again but if we can destroi
idern and hi armi it will be long befor the king of king who is
send all hi multitud against the greek can gather anoth and
dure thi time egypt mai again becom a nation and abl to protect
herself under peroa her own pharaoh
in the end i and those who thought like me prevail so that befor
the dawn i wa sail down the nile with the fleet have two thousand
men under my command also i took with me the six hunter whom i had won
from the great king sinc i knew them to be faith and thought that
their knowledg of the eastern and their wai might be of servic our
order were to hold a certain neck of land between the river and the
hill where the armi of idern must pass until peroa and all hi
strength could attack him from behind
four hour later the wind be veri favour to us we reach that
place and there took up our station and have made all as readi as we
could rest
in the earli afternoon be awaken me from the heavi sleep into which
i had fallen and point to the south i look and through the desert
haze saw the chariot of idern advanc in order rank and after
them the mass of hi footmen
now we had no chariot onli archer and two regiment arm with long
spear and sword also the sailor on the boat had their sling and
throw javelin lastli the ground wa in our favour sinc it slope
upward and the space between the river and the hill wa narrow
somewhat boggi too after the inund of the nile which meant that
the chariot must advanc in a column and could not gather suffici
speed to sweep over us
idern and hi captain note all thi also and halt then thei sent
a herald forward to ask who we were and to command us in the name of the
great king to make wai for the armi of the great king
i answer that we were egyptian order by peroa to hold the road
against the satrap who had done affront to egypt by demand that
it royal ladi should be given over to him to be sent to the east as
a womanslav and that if the satrap wish to clear a road he could
come and do so or if it pleas him he could go back toward memphi
or stai where he wa sinc we did not wish to strike the first blow i
ad thi
i who speak on behalf of the princ peroa am the lord shabaka that
same man whom but last night the satrap and a certain captain of hi
name a liar now the eastern ar brave men and we of egypt have
alwai heard that among them none is braver than idern who gain hi
advanc through courag and skill in war let him therefor come out
togeth with the lord who name me a liar arm with sword onli and
i who be a liar must also be a coward togeth with my servant a
black dwarf will meet them man to man in the sight of both the armi
and fight them to the death or if it pleas idern better let him
not come and i will seek him and kill him in the battl or by him be
kill
the herald have taken stock of me and of be at whom he laugh
return with the messag
will he come think you master ask be
mayhap i answer sinc it is a shame for an eastern to refus
a challeng from ani man whom he call barbarian and if he did so it
might cost him hi life afterward at the hand of the great king also
if he should fall there ar other to take hi command but none who can
wipe awai the stain upon hi honour
ye said be also thei will think me a dwarf of no account which
make the task of kill you easi well thei shall see
now when i sent thi challeng i had more in my mind than a desir to
aveng myself upon idern and hi captain for the public shame thei had
put upon me i wish to delai the attack of their host upon our littl
band and give time for the armi of peroa to come up behind moreov if
i fell it did not greatli matter except as an omen see that i had
good offic under me who knew all my plan
we saw the herald reach the satrap armi and after a while return
toward us again which made us think my challeng had been refus
especi as with him wa an offic who i took it wa sent to spy
out our strength but thi wa not so for the man said
the satrap idern ha sworn by the great king to kill the thief of the
signet and send hi head to the great king and fear that if he wait
to meet him in battl he mai slip awai therefor he is mind to
accept your challeng o shabaka and put an end to you and inde
under the law of the east he mai not refus but a nobl of the great
king mai not fight against a black slave save with a whip so how can
that nobl accept the challeng of the dwarf be
quit well answer be see that i am no slave but a free
citizen of egypt moreov in my own countri of ethiopia i am of
royal blood lastli tell the man thi that if he doe not come and
afterward fall into my hand or into those of the lord shabaka he who
talk of whip shall be scourg with them till hi life creep out from
between hi bare bone
thu spoke be roll hi great ey and look so terribl that the
herald and the offic fell back a step or two then i told them that
if my offer did not pleas them i myself would fight first idern and
then the nobl so thei return
the end of it wa that we saw idern and hi captain advanc
follow by a guard of ten men then after i had explain all thing to
my offic i also advanc with be follow by a guard of ten pick
men we met between the armi on a littl sandi plain at the foot of
the rise and there follow talk between the captain of our guard as
to arm and so forth but we four said noth to each other sinc the
time for word wa past onli be and i sat down upon the sand and spoke
a littl togeth of amada and karema and of how thei would receiv the
new of our victori or death
it doe not much matter master said be at last see that if we
die we shall never know and if we live we shall learn for ourselv
at length all wa arrang and we stood up to face each other the four
of us be arm in the same wai for as did idern and the hawkei
lord be and i wore shirt of mail and helm those that we had brought
with us from the east for weapon we had short and heavi sword small
shield and knive at our girdl
look your last upon the sun thiev mock idern for when you
see it again it shall be with blind ey from the point of spear
fasten to the gatewai pillar of the great king palac
liar you have live and liar you shall die shout be but i said
noth
now the agreement wa that when the word had been given idern and i
and the nobl and be should fight togeth but if thei kill on of
us or we kill on of them the two who surviv might fall togeth
on the remain man rememb thi as he told me afterward at the
signal be leapt forward like a flash with work face and foam upon
hi lip and befor ever i could come to idern how i know not
had receiv the blow of the eastern lord upon hi shield and without
strike back had grip him in hi long arm and wrap him
round with hi bow leg in an instant thei were on the ground be
uppermost and i heard the sound of blow upon blow struck with knife or
sword i knew not which upon the eastern mail follow by a shout of
victori from the egyptian which told me that be had slain him
now idern and i were smite at each other he wa a taller and
a bigger man than myself but older and on who had live too well
therefor i thought it wise to keep him at a distanc and tire him
which i did by retreat and catch hi swordcut on my shield onli
smite back now and again
he run he run shout the eastern o idern bewar the dwarf
stand awai be i call thi is my game and he obei as often
he had done when we were hunt togeth
now a shrewd blow from idern cut through my helm and stagger me and
anoth befor i could recov myself shore the shield from my hand
whereat the eastern shout more loudli than befor then fear of
defeat enter into me and made me mad for thi satrap wa a great
fighter with a shout of egypt i went at him like a wound lion and
soon it wa hi turn to stagger back but ala i struck too hard for
my sword snap upon hi mail
the knife scream be the knife
i hurl the sword hilt in the satrap face and drew the dagger from
my belt then i ran in beneath hi guard and stab and stab and
stab he grip me and we went down side by side roll over each
other the god know how it end for thing were grow dim to me
when some thrust of mine found a rent in hi mail made when the sword
broke and he becam weak hi spirit weaken also for he gasp
spare my life egyptian and my treasur is your i swear it by the
fire
not for all the treasur in the world slander i pant back
and drove the dagger home to the hilt thrice until he di then i
stagger to my feet and when the armi saw that it wa i who rose
while idern lai still a roar of triumph went up from the egyptian
answer by a roar of rage from the eastern
with a cry of well done master be leapt upon the dead man and hew
hi head from him as alreadi he had serv the hawkei nobl then
grip on head in each hand he held them up for the eastern to see
men of the great king i said bear us wit that we have fought
fairli man to man when we need not have done so
the ten of the satrap guard stood silent but my own shout
back shabaka the eastern charg
i look and saw them come like wave of steel then support by my
men and preced by be who danc in front shake the sever head i
ran back to my own rank where on gave me wine to drink and threw
water over my hurt which were but slight scarc wa it done when the
battl close in and soon in it i forgot the death of idern and the
eastern liar
chapter xiii amada return to isi
we fought a veri terribl fight that even there by the bank of nile
our posit wa good but we were outnumb by four or five to on
and the eastern and their mercenari were mad at the death of the
satrap by my hand time upon time thei came on furious charg up
the slope like wild bull for the most part we reli upon our archer
to drive them back sinc our halftrain troop could scarc hope to
stand against the onset of veteran disciplin in war so take cover
behind the rock we rain arrow on them shoot the hors in the
chariot and when these were down pour our shaft upon the footmen
behind myself i took my great black bow and drew it thrice and each
time i saw a nobl fall for no mail could withstand the arrow which it
sent and of that art i wa a master none in egypt could shoot so far
or so straight as i did save perhap peroa himself i had no time to do
more sinc alwai i must be move up and down the line encourag my
men
three time we drove them back after which thei grew cun ceas
from a direct onslaught and keep what remain of their chariot in
reserv thei sent on bodi of men to climb along the slope of the hill
where the rock gave them cover from our arrow and anoth to creep
through the reed and grow crop upon the bank of the river where we
could not see to shoot them well although the slinger in the ship did
them some damag
thu thei attack us on either flank and while we were thu engag
their centr made a charg then came the bitterest of the fight
for now the bow were useless and it wa sword against sword and spear
against spear onc we broke and i thought that thei were through but
i led a charg against them and drove them back a littl wai still the
issu wa doubt till i saw be rush past me grin and leap
and with him a small bodi of greek whom we held in reserv and i
think that the sight of the terribl dwarf whom thei thought a devil
frighten the eastern more than did the greek
at ani rate shout out someth about an evil spirit whom the
egyptian worship by which i suppos thei meant that god after
whom be wa name thei retreat leav mani dead but take their
wound with them for thei were unbroken
at the foot of the slope thei reform and took counsel then sat down
out of bowshot as though to rest now i guess their plan it wa to
wait till night close in which would be soon for the sun wa sink
and then when we could not see to shoot either rush through us by
the weight of number or march back to where the cliff were lower and
climb them thu pass us on the higher open land
now we also took counsel though littl came of it sinc we did not
know what to do we were too few to attack so great an armi nor if we
climb the cliff could we hope to withstand them in the desert sand
or to hold our own against them if thei charg in the dark if thi
happen it seem that all we could do would be to fight as long as we
could after which the survivor of us must take refug on our boat so
it came to thi that we should lose the battl and the greater part of
the eastern would win back to sai unless inde the main armi under
peroa came to our aid
whilst we talk i caus the wound to be carri to the ship
befor it grew too dark to move them be went with them present he
return run swiftli
master he said the even wind is blow strong and stir the
sand but from a masthead through it i caught sight of peroa banner
the armi come round the bend of the river not four furlong awai now
charg and those eastern will be caught between the hammer and the
stone for while thei ar meet us thei will not look behind
so i went down the line of our littl forc tell them the good new
and show them my plan thei listen and understood we form up
those who were left of us not more than a thousand men perhap and
advanc the eastern laugh when thei saw us come down the slope
for thei thought that we were mad and that thei would kill us everi on
believ as thei did that peroa had no other armi when we were within
bowshot we began to shoot though sparingli for but few arrow were
left gall by our archeri thei marshal their rank to charg us
again with a shout we leapt forward to meet them for now from the
higher ground i saw the chariot of peroa rush to our rescu
we met we fought sure there had been no such fight sinc the dai
of thotm and rames the great still thei drove us back till unseen
and unsuspect the chariot and the footmen of peroa broke on them from
behind broke on them like a desert storm thei gave thei fled thi wai
and that some to the bank of the nile some to the hill by the light
of the set sun we finish it and er the dark close in the
great king armi wa destroi save for the fugit whom we hunt
down next dai
ye in that battl perish ten thousand of the eastern and their
mercenari and upon it field at dawn we crown peroa pharaoh of
egypt and he name me the chief gener of hi armi there too fell
over a thousand of my men and among them those six hunter whom i had
won in the wager with the great king and brought with me from the east
throughout the frai thei serv me as a bodyguard fight furious
who knew that thei could hope for no merci from their own peopl on by
on thei were slain the last two of them in the charg at sunset well
thei were brave and faith to me so peac be on their spirit better
to die thu than in the den of lion
in triumph we return to memphi i bring in the rearguard and the
spoil befor pharaoh and i part a messeng brought me more good
new sure tide had come that the king of king had been driven by
revolt in hi dominion to embark upon a mighti war with syria greec
and cypru and other halfconqu countri in which doubtless
by agreement the fire of insurrect had suddenli burn up also
alreadi peroa messeng had depart to tell them of what wa pass
on the nile
if thi be true said peroa when he had heard all the great king
will have no new armi to spare for egypt
it is so pharaoh i answer yet i think he will conquer in thi
great war and that within two year you must be prepar to meet him
face to face
two year ar long shabaka and in them by your help much mai be
done
but as it chanc he wa destin to be rob of that help and thi by
the work of woman the destroy
it happen thu amidst great rejoic pharaoh reach memphi and in
the vast templ of amen laid down our spoil in the presenc of the god
thousand of right hand hewn from the fallen thousand of sword and
other weapon and ten of chariot togeth with much treasur of which
a portion wa given to the god the high priest bless us in the name
of amen and of the other god the peopl bless us and threw flower
in our path all the land rejoic becaus onc more it wa free
there too that dai in the templ with ancient form and ceremoni peroa
wa crown pharaoh of egypt sceptr and jewel that had been hid
for gener were brought out by those who knew the secret of their
hidingplac the crown that had been worn by old pharaoh were set
upon hi head ye the doubl crown of the upper and the lower land
thu in a memphi mad with joi at the cast off of the foreign yoke
he wa anoint the first of a new dynasti and with him hi queen
i too receiv honour for the stori of the slai of idern at
my hand and of how i held the pass had gone abroad so that next to
pharaoh i wa look upon as the greatest man in egypt nor wa be
forgotten sinc mani of the common peopl thought that he wa a
spirit in the form of a dwarf whom the god had sent to aid us with hi
strength and cun inde at the close of the ceremoni voic cri

crown but even my hear ha grown somewhat weak of late except in
the silenc of the night shabaka

voic just now call out that you shabaka should be name as the
next successor to the throne of egypt wa it so
ye holi tanofir that is why i have left who wa vex and am sworn
to seek no such honour which inde i do not desir
just so nephew yet gift have a wai of come to those who do not
desir them and the last vision that i saw befor my cup left me or
rather that she saw wa of you wear the doubl crown she said that

won for him yonder in the pass when you smote down idern and held hi
legion oh it wa well done and my new cup though faulti wa good
enough to show me all i felt proud of you shabaka but begon begon
a gift for the poor old beggar a gift my lord for the poor blind
beggar who ha had none sinc the last pharaoh wa crown in egypt and
find it hard to live on memori
at our hous i found my mother just return from the coron but
be i did not find and guess that he had slip awai to meet hi
newmad wife karema my mother embrac me and bless me make much
of me and my deed in the battl also she doctor such small hurt as
i had i put the matter by as shortli as i could and ask her if she
had seen aught of amada she answer that she had neither seen nor
heard of her which i wa sure she thought strang as she began to
talk quickli of other thing i said to her what i had said to the holi
tanofir that doubtless she wa make readi for the feast sinc i could
not find her at the crown
or sai goodby to the goddess answer my mother nod sinc
there ar some who find it even harder to fall from heaven to earth than
to climb from earth to heaven and after all you ar but a man my son
then she slip awai to attir herself leav me wonder becaus
my mother wa shrewd and never spoke at random
there wa the holi tanofir too with hi talk about the templ of isi
and he also did not speak at random oh now i felt as i had done when
the shadow of the palmtre fell on me yonder in the palac garden
the mood pass for my blood still tingl with the glori of that great
fight and my heart shut it door to sad know as i did that i
wa the most prais man in memphi that dai inde had i not i should
have learn it when with my mother i enter the great banquetinghal
of the palac somewhat late for she wa long in make readi
the first thing i saw there wa be gorgeous arrai in eastern silk
that he had plunder from the satrap tent stand on a tabl so
that all might see and hear him and hold aloft in on hand the
grisli head of idern and in the other that of the hawkei nobl whom
he had slain while in hi thick guttur voic he told the tale of
that great frai catch sight of me he call aloud
see here come the man here come the hero to whom egypt ow it
liberti and pharaoh hi crown
thereon all the compani and the soldier and servant who were gather
about the door began to shout and acclaim me till i wish that i could
vanish awai as the holi tanofir wa said to be abl to do sinc thi
wa imposs i rush at be who leapt from the tabl like a monkei
and still wave the head and talk slip from the hall i know
not how follow by the loud laughter of the guest
then herald announc the come of pharaoh and all grew silent he and
hi compani enter with pomp and we hi subject prostrat ourselv
in the ancient fashion
rise my guest he cri rise my peopl abov all do you rise
shabaka my belov cousin to whom egypt and i ow so much
so we rose and i took my seat in a place of honour have my mother
at my side and look about me for amada but in vain there wa
the carven chair upon which she should have been among those of the
princess but it wa empti at first i thought that she wa late but
when time went by and she did not appear i ask if she were ill a
question that none seem abl to answer
the feast went on with all the ancient ceremoni that attend the
crown of a pharaoh of egypt sinc there were old men who rememb
these also the scribe and priest had them written in their book
i took no heed of them and will not set them down at length pharaoh
pledg hi subject and hi subject pledg pharaoh then the door
were open and through them came a compani of whiterob shaven
priest bear on a bier the bodi of a dead man wrap in hi
mummycloth at first some laugh for thi rite had not been perform
in egypt sinc she pass into the hand of the great king of the east
and therefor wa strang to them then thei grew silent sinc after
all it wa solemn to see those deathbear priest flit in and out
between the great column now seen and now lost in the shadow and to
listen to their funer chant
in the hush my mother whisper to me that thi bodi wa that of the
last pharaoh of egypt brought from hi tomb but whether thi were so
i cannot sai for certain at length thei brought the mummi which wa
crown with a snakehead circlet of the royal uru and still
drape with wither funer wreath and stood it on it feet opposit
to peroa just behind and between my mother and me in such a fashion that
it cut off the light from us
the faint and heavi smell of the embalm spice struck upon my
nostril a dead flower from the chaplet fell upon my head and
glanc over my shoulder i saw the paint or enamel ey in the
gild mask stare at me the thing fill me with fear i knew not
of what not of death sure for that i had face a score of time of
late and thought noth of it inde i am not sure that it wa fear i
felt but rather a deep sens of the vaniti of all thing it seem
to come home to meshabaka or allan quatermain for in my dream the
inspir or whatev it might be struck through the spirit that
anim both of usa it had never done befor that everyth is
noth that victori and love and even life itself have no mean
that naught realli exist save the soul of man and god of whom
perchanc that soul is a part sent forth for a while to do hi work
through good and ill the thought lift me up and yet crush me
sinc for a moment all that make a man pass awai and i felt myself
stand in utter loneli nake befor the glori of god watch
onli by the flame star that light hi throne ye and at that moment
suddenli i learn that all the god ar but on god have mani shape
and call by mani name
then i heard the priest sai
pharaoh the osiri greet pharaoh the live on the earth and send to
him thi messagea i am so shalt thou be and where i am there thou
shalt dwell through all the ag of etern
then pharaoh the live rose and bow to pharaoh the dead and pharaoh
the dead wa taken awai back to hi etern hous and i wonder whether
hi ka or hi spirit or whatev is the part of him that live on were
watch us and rememb the feast whereof he had partaken in hi
pomp in thi pillar hall as hi forefath had done befor him for
hundr or thousand of year
not until the mummi had gone and the last sound of the chant of the
priest had di did the heart of the feaster grow light again but
soon thei forgot as men aliv alwai forget death and those whom time
ha devour for the wine wa good and strong and the ey of the women
were bright and victori had crown our spear and for a while egypt
wa onc more free
so it went on till pharaoh rose and depart the great gold ear
in hi ear jingl as he walk and the trumpet sound befor and
after him i too rose to go with my mother when a messeng came and
bade me wait upon pharaoh and with me the dwarf be so we went
leav an offic to conduct my mother to our home as i pass her she
caught me by the sleev and whisper in my ear
my son whatev chanc to you be brave and rememb that the world
hold more than women
ye i answer it hold death and god or thei hold it though
what put the word into my mind i do not know sinc i did not
understand and had no time to ask her mean
the messeng led us to the door of peroa privat chamber the same in
which i had seen him on my return from the east here he bade me enter
and be to wait without i went in and found two men and a woman in the
chamber all stand veri silent the men were pharaoh who still wore
hi gloriou robe and doubl crown and the high priest of isi cloth
in white the other wa the ladi amada also cloth in the snowi robe
of isi
at the sight of her thu arrai my heart stop and i stood silent
becaus i could not speak she too stood silent and i saw that beneath
her thin veil her beauti face wa set and pale as that of an
alabast statu inde she might have been not a love live woman
but the goddess isi herself whose symbol she bore about her
shabaka said pharaoh at length the royal ladi of egypt amada
priestess of isi ha somewhat to sai to you
let the royal ladi of egypt speak on to her servant and affianc
husband i answer
count shabaka gener of the armi she began in a cold clear voic
like to that of on who repeat a lesson learn that you ar no more my
affianc husband and that i who am gather again to isi the divin
am no more your affianc wife
i do not understand will it pleas you to be more plain i said
faintli
i will be more plain count shabaka more plain than you have been with
me sinc we speak togeth for the last time it is well that i should
be plain hear me when first you return from the east in yonder hall
you told us of certain thing that happen to you there then the dwarf
your servant took up the tale he said that he gave my name to the great
king i wa wroth as well i might be but even when i prai that he
should be scourg you did not deni that it wa he who gave my name to
the king although pharaoh yonder said that if you had spoken the name
it would have been anoth matter
i had no time i answer for just then the messeng came from
idern and afterward when i sought you you were gone
had you then no time she ask coldli beneath the palm in the
garden of the palac when we were affianc oh there wa time in
plenti but it did not pleas you to tell me that you had bought safeti
and great gift at the price of the honour of the ladi of egypt whose
love you stole
you do not understand i exclaim wildli
forgiv me shabaka but i understand veri well inde sinc from
your own word i learn at the feast given to idern that the name
of amada slip your lip by chanc and thu came to the ear of the
great king
the tale that idern and hi captain told wa fals ladi and for it
be and i took their live with our own hand
it had perhap been better shabaka if you had kept them live that
thei might confess that it wa fals but doubtless you thought them
safer dead sinc dead men cannot speak and for thi reason challeng
them to singl combat
i gasp and could not answer for my mind seem to leav me and she
went on in a gentler voic
i do not wish to speak angrili to you my cousin shabaka especi
when you have just wrought such great deed for egypt moreov by the
law i serv i mai speak angrili to no man know then that on learn
the truth sinc i could love none but you accord to the flesh and
therefor can never give myself in marriag to anoth i sought refug
in the arm of the goddess whom for your sake i had desert she wa
pleas to receiv me forget my treason on thi veri dai for the
second time i took the oath which mai no more be broken and that i mai
dwell where i shall never see you more pharaoh here ha been pleas
at my request to name me high priestess and prophetess of isi and to
appoint me as a dwellingplac her templ at amada where i wa born far
awai in upper egypt now all is said and done so farewel
all is not said and done i broke out in furi pharaoh i ask your
leav to tell the full stori of thi busi of the name of the ladi
amada to the king of king and that in the presenc of the dwarf be
even a slave is allow to set out hi tale befor judgment is pass
upon him
peroa glanc at amada who made no sign then said
it is grant gener shabaka
so be wa call into the chamber and have look about him
curious seat himself upon the ground
be i said you have heard noth of what ha pass here i wa
mistaken for as he told me afterward he had heard everyth through
the door which wa not quit close it is need be that you
should repeat truli all that happen at the court of the king of king
befor and after i wa brought from the boat
be obei tell the tale veri well so well that all listen
earnestli without error moreov when he had finish i also told my
stori and how shaken by all i had gone through and alreadi weak from
the torment of the boat the name of amada wa surpris from me who
never dream that the king would at onc make demand of her and who
would have perish a thousand time rather than such a thing should
happen i ad what i had learn afterward from our escort that thi
name wa alreadi well known to the great king who meant to make us of
it as a caus of quarrel with egypt further that he had let me escap
from a death by horribl torment becaus of some dream that he had
dream while he rest befor the banquet in which a god appear and
told him that it wa an evil thing to slai a man becaus that man had
best him at a hunt match and on of which heaven would keep an
account still becaus of the law of hi land he must find a public
pretext for loos on whom he had onc condemn and therefor chose
thi matter of the ladi amada whom he pretend to send me to bring to
him
when i had finish as amada still remain silent pharaoh ask of
be how it came about that he told on stori on the night of our return
and anoth on thi night
becaus o pharaoh answer be roll hi ey for the first time
in my life i have been just a littl too clever and shot my arrow just
a littl too far hearken pharaoh and royal ladi and high priest i
knew that my master love the ladi amada and knew also that she is quick
of tongu and temper on who readili take offenc even if therebi
she break her own heart and so bring her life to ruin and with it
perchanc her countri therefor know women whom i have studi in
my own land i saw in thi matter just such a caus of offenc as she
would lai hold of and counsel my master to keep silent as to the
stori of the name of her befor the king some evil spirit made him
listen to thi bad counsel so far at least that when i li as to
what had chanc for which lie the ladi amada prai that i might be
scourg till my bone broke through the skin he did not at onc tell
all the truth nor did he do so afterward becaus he fear that if he
did i should in fact be scourg for my master and i love each other
neither of us wish to see the other scourg though such is my lot
tonight and he glanc at amada i have said
then at last amada spoke
had i known all thi stori from the first perhap i should not have
done what i have done todai and perhap i should have forgiven and
forgotten for in truth even if the dwarf still li i believ your
word o shabaka and understand how all came about but now it is too
late to chang sai o priest of the mother is it not too late
it is too late said the priest solemnli see that if such vow
as your ar broken for the second time o prophetess the curs of the
goddess will pursu you and him for whom thei were broken ye through
thi life and all other live that perchanc mai be given to you upon
the earth or elsewher
pharaoh i cri in despair i made a bond with you it is record
in write and seal i have kept my part of the bond my treasur you
have spent your enemi i have slain your armi i have command not so
ill will you not keep your and bid the priest releas thi ladi from
her vow and give her to me to whom she wa promis or must i believ
that you refus not becaus of goddess and vow but becaus yonder
is the royal ladi of egypt the true heiress to the throne who might
perchanc bear children which as prophetess of isi she can never do
ye becaus of thi and becaus of certain cri that came to your ear
in the hour of your crown befor amenra and all the god
peroa flush as he heard me and answer
you speak roughli cousin and were you ani other man i might be
tempt to answer roughli but i know that you suffer and therefor i
forgiv nai you must believ no such thing rather must you rememb
that in thi bond of which you speak it wa set down that i onli
promis you the ladi amada with her own consent and thi she ha
withdrawn
then pharaoh hearken tomorrow i leav egypt for anoth land
give you back your generalship and sheath the sword that i had
hope to wield in it defenc and your when the last great dai of trial
by battl come as come it will i tell you that i go to return no
more unless the ladi amada yonder shall summon me back to fight for her
and you promis herself to me in guerdon
that can never be said amada
then i becam awar of anoth presenc in the room though how and when
it appear i do not know but i suppos that it had crept in while we
were lost in talk at least between me and pharaoh crouch upon the
ground wa the figur of a man wrap in a beggar cloak it threw
back the hood and there appear the ashen face and snowi beard of the
holi tanofir
you know me pharaoh he said in hi deep solemn voic i am
tanofir the king son tanofir the hermit tanofir the seer i have
heard all that pass it matter not how and i come to you with a
messag i who read men heart of vow and goddess and women i sai
noth but thi i sai to you that if you break the spirit of your
bond and suffer yonder shabaka to go henc with a bitter heart troubl
shall come on you all the great king armi did not die yonder by the
bank of nile and mayhap on dai he will journei to buri the bone of
those who fell and with them your o pharaoh i do not think that
you will listen to me tonight and i am sure that yonder ladi full of
the newfan flame of the jealou goddess will not listen still let
her take counsel and rememb my word in the hour of desper danger
let her send to shabaka and demand hi help promis in return what he
ha ask and rememb that if isi love her that goddess wa born
upon the nile and love egypt more
too late too late too late wail amada
then she burst into tear and turn fled awai with the high priest
pharaoh went also leav me and be alon i look for the holi
tanofir to speak with him but he too wa gone
it is time to sleep master said be for all thi talk is more
wearisom than ani battl why what is thi that ha your name upon
it and he pick a silkwrap packag from the floor and open it
within were the priceless rosehu pearl
chapter xiv shabaka fight the crocodil
where to i said to be when we were outsid the palac for i wa so
broken with grief that i scarc knew what i did
to the hous of the ladi tiu i think master sinc there you must
make prepar for your start on the morrow also bid her farewel

befor you reflect master on the hunt we will have yonder in
ethiopia no more care no more plan for the welfar of egypt

battleventur with your countri honour on your swordpoint and if
you must see womenwel there ar plenti in ethiopia who come and go
lightli as an even breez laden with the odour of flower and never
troubl in the morn
at ani rate you ar not free from such coil be i said and in the
moonlight i saw hi great face fall in
no master i am ty them about my throat see such is the wai of
the world or of the god that rule the world i know not which for
year i have been happi and free i have enjoi adventur and visit
strang countri and have gather learn till i think i am the
wisest man upon the nile at the side of on whom i love and hold
noth at risk except my own life which matter no more than that of
a gnat danc in the sun now all is chang i have a wife whom i love
also more than i can tell you and he sigh but who still must
be look after and obeyedy obei further soon i shall have a
peopl and a crown to wear and councillor and affair of state and
an ancient religion to support and the grasshopp itself know what
besid the burden ha roll from your back to mine master make my
heart which wa so light heavi and oh i wish it had stop where it

even then i laugh sad as i wa for truth live in the philosophi of
be

folli ha work you ill forgiv me sinc i act for the best onli
until the end no on ever know what is the best now here is the hous
and i go to meet my wife and to make certain arrang by dawn
perhap you will be readi to start to ethiopia
do you realli desir that i should accompani you there be
certainli master that is unless you should desir that i accompani
you somewher els instead by sea southward for instanc if so i do
not know that i would refus sinc ethiopia will not run awai and there
is much of the world that i should still like to visit onli then there
is karema to be thought about who expect or when she learn all
soon will expect to be a queen he ad doubtfulli
no be i am too tire to make new plan so let us go to ethiopia and
not disappoint karema who after hold a cup so long natur would
like to try a sceptr
i think that is wisest master at ani rate the holi tanofir think
it wisest and he is the voic of fate oh why do we troubl who after
all everi on of us ar noth but piec upon the board of fate
then he turn and left me and i enter the hous where i found my
mother sit still in her festal robe like on who wait she
look at my face then ask what troubl me i sat down on a stool at
her feet and told her everyth
much as i thought she said when i had finish these overlearn
women ar strang fish to catch and hold and too much soul is like too
much sail upon a boat when the desert wind begin to blow across the
nile well do not let us blame her or be or peroa who is alreadi
anxiou for hi dynasti and would rather that amada were a priestess
than your wife or even the goddess isi who no doubt is anxiou for
her votari let us rather blame the power that is behind the veil or
to it bow our head see that we know noth of the end for which it
work so egypt shut her door on you my son and whither awai not
to the east again i trust for there you would soon grow shorter by a
head
i go to ethiopia my mother where it seem that be is a great man and
can shelter me
so we go to ethiopia do we well it is a long journei for an old
woman but i weari of memphi where i have live for so mani year and
doubtless the sand of the south make good burial ground
we i exclaim we
sure my son sinc in lose a wife you have again found a mother
and until i die we part no more
when i heard thi my ey fill with tear my conscienc smote me also
becaus of late and inde for year past i had thought so much of
amada and so littl of my mother and now it wa amada who had cast me
out unjustli without wait to learn the truth becaus at the worst
i who worship her had save myself from death in slow torment by
speak her name while my mother forget all took me to her bosom
again as she had done when i wa a babe i knew not what to sai
but rememb the pearl i drew them out and place them round my
mother neck
she look at the wonder thing and smile then said
such gem as these becom white lock and wither breast but ill
yet my son i will keep them for you till you find a wife if not
amada then anoth
if not amada i shall never find a wife i said bitterli whereat she
smile
then she left me to make readi befor she slept a while
work as we would noon had pass two hour on the follow dai befor
we were prepar to start for there wa much to do thu the hous must
be place in charg of friend and the mean of travel collect also a
messeng came from pharaoh prai me for hi and egypt sake to think
again befor i left them and an answer sent that go i must whither
the holi tanofir would know if at ani time pharaoh desir to learn in
repli to thi came anoth messeng who brought me part gift from
pharaoh a chain of honour a titl of higher nobil a commiss
as hi envoi to whatev land i wander and so forth which i must
acknowledg lastli as we were leav the hous to seek the boat which
be had made readi on the nile there came yet anoth messeng at the
sight of whom my heart leapt for he wa priest of isi
he bow and hand me a roll i open it with a trembl hand and
read
from the prophetess of isi whose hous is at amada aforetim
royal ladi of egypt to the count shabaka
i learn o my cousin that you depart from egypt and know the
reason my heart is sore believ me my cousin i love you well
better than ani who live upon the earth nor will that love ever
chang sinc the goddess who hold my futur in her hand know
of what we ar made and is not jealou of the past therefor she
will not be wroth at the earthli love of on who is gather to
her heavenli arm her bless and mine be on you and if we see
each other no more face to face in the world mai we meet again in
the hall of osiri farewel belov shabaka oh why did you
suffer that black master of li the dwarf be to persuad you
to hide the truth from me
so the write end and below it were two stain still wet which i
knew were caus by tear moreov wrap in a piec of silk and
fasten to the scroll wa a littl gold ring graven with the royal
uru that amada had alwai worn from childhood onli on the previou
night i had note it on the first finger of her right hand
i took my stylu and my waxen tablet and wrote on on of them
had you been a man amada and not a woman i think you would have
judg me differ but learn priestess and prophetess as you
ar a woman you remain perchanc a time mai come when onc more
you will turn to me in the hour of your need if so and i am
live i will come yea if i am dead i think that i still shall
come sinc noth can realli part us meanwhil by dai and by
night i wear your ring and whenev i look on it i think of amada
the woman whose lip have press my own and forget amada the
priestess who for her soul sake ha been pleas to break the
heart of the man who love her and whom she misjudg so sore in
her pride and anger
thi tablet i wrap up and seal us clai and her own ring to make
the seal and gave it for deliveri to the priest
at length we drew near to the river and here gather on the open land
i found the most of those who had fought with me in the battl against
the eastern and with them a great concours of other from the
citi these collect round me some of them wound and hobbl upon
crutch prai me not to go as did the other who foresaw sorrow to
egypt from my loss but i broke awai from them almost in tear and
with my mother hid myself beneath the canopi of the boat here be wa
wait also hi beauti wife who although she seem sad at leav
egypt smile a greet to us while the steersmen and rower of the
boat tall ethiopian everi on of them rose and gave me a gener
salut then as the wind serv we hoist the sail and glide awai up
nile till present the templ and palmgrov of memphi were lost to
sight
of that long long journei there is no need to tell up the nile we
travel slowli drag the boat past the cataract till egypt wa
far behind us in the end mani dai after we had pass the mouth of
anoth river that wa blue in colour which flow from the northern
mountain land down into the nile we came to a place where the rapid
were so long and steep that we must leav the boat and travel overland
draw near to it at sunset i saw a multitud of peopl gather on the
sand and beyond them a camp in which were set mani beauti pavilion
that seem to be broider with silk and gold as were the banner that
float abov them whereon appear the effigi of a grasshopp also
done in gold with silver leg
it seem that my messeng travel in safeti said be to me for
know that yonder ar some of my subject who have come here to meet
us now master i must no longer call you master sinc i fear i am onc
more a king and you must no longer call me be but karoon moreov
forgiv me but when you come into my presenc you must bow which i
shall like less than you do but it is the custom of the ethiopian
oh i would that you were the king and that i were your friend for
henceforth goodby to eas and jolliti
i laugh but be did not laugh at all onli turn to hi wife who
alreadi rule him as though he were inde a slave and said ladi
karema make yourself as beauti as you can and forget that you have

queen that is if you pleas my peopl

open her fine ey
i do not quit know wife perhap thei mai refus to accept me at

thei did that to a white woman make a goddess of her until she di
of weari or perhapswel i do not know
then karema grew angri
now i wish i had remain a cup she said and the servant of the
holi tanofir who at least taught me mani secret thing instead of
come to dwell among black barbarian in the compani of a dwarf who
even if he be a king it seem ha no power to protect the wife whom he
ha chosen
why will women alwai grow wroth befor there is need ask be
humbl sure it would be time to rate me when ani of these thing had
happen
if ani of them do happen husband i shall sai much wors thing than
that she repli but the talk went no further for at thi moment our
boat ground and sing a wild song mani of those who wait rush
into the water to drag it to the bank
then be stood up on the prow wave hi bow and there aros a mighti
shout of karoon karoon it is he it is he return after mani
year
twice thei shout thu and then everi on of them threw themselv
face downward in the sand
ye my peopl cri be it is i karoon who have been
miracul preserv from mani danger in far land by the help of the
grasshopp in heaven and as my messeng will have told you of my
belov friend lord shabaka the egyptian who ha deign to come to
dwell with us for a while have at length return to ethiopia that i
mai shed my wisdom on you like the sun and pour it on your head like

therefor left you i have search the whole world through till i found
the most beauti woman that it contain and made her my wife she
too ha deign to come to thi far countri to be your queen advanc
fair karema and show yourself to these my ethiopian
so karema step forward and stood on the prow of the boat by the side
of be and a strang coupl thei look the ethiopian who had risen
consid her grave then on of them said
karoon call her beauti but in truth she is almost white and veri
ugli
at least she is a woman said anoth for her shape is femal
ye and he ha marri her remark a third and even a king
mai choos hi own wife sometim for in such matter who can judg
anoth tast
ceas said be in a lordli wai if you do not think her beauti
tonight you will tomorrow and now let us land and rest
so we land and while i did so i took note of these ethiopian thei
were great men black as charcoal with thick lip white teeth and flat
nose their ey were larg and the white of them somewhat yellow
their hair curl like wool their beard were short and on their face
thei wore a continu smile of dress most of them had littl but their
elder or leader wore lion and leopard skin and some were clad in a
kind of silken tunic belt about the middl all were arm for war
with long bow short sword and small shield round in shape and made
from the hide of the hippopotamu or of the unicorn gold wa plenti
amongst them sinc even the humblest wore bracelet of that metal while
about the neck of the chieftain it wa wound in great torqu also
sometim on their ankl thei wore sandal on their feet and some
of them had ostrich feather stuck in their hair a few also had
grasshopp fashion of gold bound on the top of their head and
these i took to be the priest there were no women in their number
as the sun wa sink we were led at onc to a veri beauti tent made
of woven flax and ornament as i have describ where we found food
made readi for us in plenti milk in bowl and the flesh of sheep and
oxen boil and roast be howev wa taken to a place apart which
made karema even more angri than she wa befor
scarc had we finish eat when a herald rush into the tent
cry prostrat yourselv yea be prostrat the grasshopp
come karoon come
here i must sai that i found that the titl of karoon meant great
grasshopp but karema who did not know thi ask indignantli why
she should prostrat herself to a grasshopp inde she refus to
do so even when be enter the pavilion wonderfulli attir in a
gorgeouscolour robe of which the train wa held by two huge men so
absurd did he look that my mother and i must bow veri deepli to hide our
laughter while karema said
it would be better husband if you found children to carri your robe
instead of two giant moreov if it is meant to copi the colour of
a grasshopp ti badli done sinc grasshopp ar green and you
ar gold and scarlet also thei do not wear feather set awri upon their
head
be roll hi ey as though in agoni then turn bade hi
attend be gone thei obei though doubtfulli as though thei did
not like to leav him alon with us whereon he let down the flap of the
pavilion threw off hi gorgeou cover and said
you must learn to understand wife that our custom ar differ from
those of egypt there i wa happi as a slave and you were held to
be beauti as the cup of the holi tanofir also learn here i am
wretch as a king and you ar held to be ugli also ignor as a
stranger oh do not answer i prai you but learn that all goe well
for the time you ar accept as my wife subject to the decis of a
council of matron ag rel of my famili who will decid when
we reach the citi of the grasshopp whether or not you shall be
acknowledg as the queen of the ethiopian no no i prai you sai
noth sinc i must go awai at onc as accord to the law of the
ethiopian the time ha come for the grasshopp to sleep alon
karema as you ar not yet acknowledg as my wife you also can sleep
with the ladi tiu and for shabaka a tent is provid rest sweetli
wife hark thei fetch me
now if i had my wai said karema i would rest in that boat go
back to egypt what sai you lord shabaka
but i made no answer who follow be out of the tent leav her to
talk the matter over with my mother here i found a crowd of hi peopl
wait to convei him to sleep and watch saw them place him in
anoth tent round which thei rang themselv plai upon music
instrument after thi someon came and led me to my own place where
wa a good bed in which i lai down to sleep thi howev i could not do
for a long while becaus of my own laughter and the nois of the drum
and horn that were sooth be to hi rest for now i understood why
he had prefer to be a slave in egypt rather than a king in ethiopia
in the morn i rose befor the dawn and went out to the riverbank to
bath while i wa make readi to wash myself who should appear but
be follow but at a distanc by a number of hi peopl
never have i spent such a night master he said at least not sinc
you took me prison year ago sinc by law i mai not stop those horn
and music instrument now howev also accord to the law of the
ethiopian i am my own lord until the sun rise so i have come here
to gather some of those blue lili which she love as a present for
karema becaus i fear that she is angri and must be appeas
certainli she is veri angri i said or at least wa so when i left
her last night oh be why did you let your peopl tell her that she
wa ugli
how can i help it master have you not alwai heard that the
ethiopian ar chiefli famou for on thing name that thei speak
noth but the truth to them she be differ seem to be ugli
therefor when thei sai that she is ugli thei speak the truth
if so it is a truth that she doe not like be as i have no doubt
she will tell you by and by do thei think me ugli also
ye thei do master but thei think also that you look like a man who
can draw a bow and us a sword and that goe far with the ethiopian
of your mother thei sai noth becaus she is old and thei vener the
ag whom the grasshopp is wait to carri awai
now i began to laugh again and went with be to gather the lili these
grew at the end of a mass of reed woven togeth by the pressur of the
current and float on the water be lai down upon hi stomach while
hi peopl watch from a distanc on the bank amaz into silenc and
stretch out hi long arm to reach the blue lotu flower suddenli
the reed gave wai beneath him just as he had grasp two of the flower
and wa drag at them so that he fell into the river
next instant i saw a swirl in the brown water and perceiv a huge
crocodil it rush at be openmouth be a good swimmer he
twist hi bodi in order to avoid it but i heard the great teeth
close with a snap on the short leathern garment which he wore about hi
middl
the devil ha me farewel he cri and vanish beneath the water
now as i have said i wa almost strip for bath but had not
yet taken off my short sword which wa gird round me by a belt in an
instant i drew it and amidst the yell of horror of the ethiopian who
had seen all from the bank i plung into the river there ar few abl
to swim as i could and i had the art of dive with my ey open and
remain long beneath the surfac without draw breath for thi i
had practis from a child
immedi i saw the great reptil sink to the mud and drag be
with him to drown him there but here the river wa veri deep and with
a few swift stroke i wa abl to get under the crocodil then with all
my strength i stab upward drive the sword far into the soft part
of the throat feel the pain of the sharp iron the beast let go of
be and turn on me how it happen i do not know but present i
found myself upon it back and wa strike at it ey on thrust at
least went home for the blind brute rose to the surfac bear me
with him and oh the sweet of the air as i breath again
thu we appear i ride the crocodil like a hors and stab
furious while close by wa be roll hi yellow ey but helpless
for he had no weapon still the devil wa not dead although blood
stream from him onli mad with pain and rage nor could the shout
ethiopian help me sinc thei had onli bow and dare not shoot lest
their shaft should pierc me the crocodil began to sink again
snap furious at my leg then i bethought me of a trick i had seen
practis by nativ on the nile
wait till it huge jaw were open i thrust my arm between them
grasp the short sword in such fashion that the hilt rest on it
tongu and the point against the roof of it mouth it tri to close
it jaw and lo the good iron wa fix between them hold them wide
open then i withdrew my hand and float upward with noth wors
than a cut upon the wrist from on of it sharp fang i appear upon
the surfac and after me the crocodil spout blood and wallow in
it death agoni i rememb no more till i found myself ly on the
bank surround by a multitud with be stand over me also in the
shallow water wa the crocodil dead my sword still fix between it
jaw
ar you harm master cri be in a voic of agoni
veri littl i think i answer sit up with the blood pour
from my arm
be thrust asid karema who had come lightli cloth from her tent
sai
all is well wife i will bring you the lili present
then he flung hi arm about me kiss my hand and my brow and turn
to the crowd shout
last night you were disput as to whether thi egyptian lord should
be allow to dwell with me in the land of ethiopia which of you
disput it now
no on thei answer with a roar he is not a man but a god no man
could have done such a deed
so it seem answer be quietli at least none of you even tri
to do it yet he is not a god but onli that kind of man who is call
a hero also he is my brother and while i reign in ethiopia either he
shall reign at my side or i go awai with him
it shall be so karoon thei shout with on voic and after thi i
wa carri back to the tent
in front of it my mother wait and kiss me proudli befor them all
whereat thei shout again
so end thi adventur of the crocodil except that present be went
back and recov the two lili for karema thi time from a boat
which caus the ethiopian to call out that he must love her veri much
though not as much as he did me
that afternoon born in litter we set out for the citi of the
grasshopp which we reach on the fourth dai as we drew near the
place regiment of men to the number of twelv thousand or more came
out to meet us so that at last we arriv escort by an armi who sang
their song of triumph and plai upon their music instrument until
my head ach with the nois
thi citi wa a great place whereof the hous were built of mud and
thatch with reed it stood upon a wide plain and in it centr rose
a natur rocki hill upon the crest of which fashion of block of
gleam marbl and roof with a metal that shone as gold wa the
templ of the grasshopp a column build veri like to those of
egypt round it also were other public build among them the palac
of the karoon the whole be surround by tripl marbl wall as a
protect from attack by foe never had i seen anyth so beauti
as that hill with it edific of shine white roof with gold or
copper and gleam in the sun
descend from my litter i walk to those of my mother and karema for
be in hi majesti might not be approach and said as much to them
ye son answer my mother it is worth while to have travel so
far to see such a sight i shall have a fine sepulchr son
i have seen it all befor broke in karema
when i ask
i do not know i suppos it must have been when i wa the cup of the
holi tanofir at least it is familiar to me alreadi i weari of it for
who can care for a land or a citi where thei think white peopl hideou
and scarc allow a wife to go near her husband save between midnight
and dawn when thei ceas from their horribl music
it will be your part to chang these custom karema
ye she exclaim certainli that will be my part after which i
went back to my litter
chapter xv the summon
now at the gate of the citi of the grasshopp we were royal
receiv the priest came out to meet us push a coloss imag
of their god befor them on a kind of flat chariot and i rememb
wonder what would be the valu of that huge golden locust if it were
melt down also the council came veri ancient men all of them
sinc the ethiopian for the most part live more than a hundr year
perhap that is why thei were so glad to welcom be sinc thei were too
old to care about retain power in their own hand as thei had done
dure hi long absenc for save be there wa no other man live of
the true royal blood who could take the throne
then there were thousand of women broadfac and smile whose black
skin shone with scent oil for thei wore littl except a girdl
about their waist and mani ornament of gold thu their ear
were sometim a palm in breadth and mani of them had great gold ring
through their nose such as in egypt ar put in those of bull my
mother laugh at them but karema said that she thought them hideou
and hate
thei were a strang peopl these ethiopian like children most of
them be merri and kind and never think of on thing for more
than a minut thu on would see them weep and laugh almost in the same
breath but among them wa an upper class who had great learn and
much ancient knowledg these men made their law wherein there wa
alwai sens under what seem to be folli design the templ
manag the mine of gold and other metal and follow the art thei
were the real master of the land the rest were but slave content to
live in plenti for in that fertil soil want never came near them and
to do as thei were bid
thu thei pass from the cradl to the grave amidst song and flower
carri out their light allot task and for the rest live as
thei would and love those thei would especi their children of
whom thei had mani by natur and tradit the men were warrior and
hunter be skill in the us of the bow and alwai at war when thei
could find anyon to fight inde when we came among them their troubl
wa that thei had no enemi left and at onc thei implor be to lead
them out to battl sinc thei were weari of herd kine and till
field
all of these thing i found out by degre also that thei were a great
peopl who could send out an armi of seventi thousand men and yet leav
enough behind them to defend their land of the world beyond their
border the most of them knew littl but the learn men of whom i have
spoken a great deal sinc thei travel to egypt and elsewher to
studi the custom of other countri for the rest their onli god wa
the grasshopp and like that insect thei skip and chirrup through
life and when the winter of death came sprang awai to anoth of which
thei knew noth leav their young behind them to bask in the sun of
unborn summer such were the ethiopian
now of all the ceremoni of the recept of be and hi recrown
as karoon i knew littl for the reason that the tooth of the crocodil
poison my blood and made me veri ill so that i remain for a moon
or more ly in a fine room in the palac where gold seem to be as
plenti as earthen pot ar in egypt and all the vessel were of
crystal had it not been for the skill of the ethiopian leech and
abov all for the nurs of my mother i think that i must have di
she it wa who withstood them when thei wish to cut off my arm and
wise for it recov and wa as strong as it had ever been in the
end i grew well again and from the platform in front of the templ wa
present to the peopl by be as hi saviour and the next greatest to
him in the kingdom nor shall i ever forget the shout with which i
wa receiv
karema also wa present as hi wife have pass the ordeal of the
matron but onli i think becaus it wa found that she wa in the wai
to give an heir to the throne for to them her beauti wa ugli nor
could thei understand how it came about that their king who contrari
to the gener custom of the land wa onli allow on wife lest the
children should quarrel could have chosen a ladi who wa not black
so thei receiv her in silenc with mani whisper which made karema
veri angri
when in due cours howev the child came and prove to be a son black
as the best of them and of perfect shape thei relent toward her and
after the birth of a second grew to love her but she never forgav and
love them not at all nor wa she overfond of these children of her
becaus thei were so black which she said show how poison wa the
blood of the ethiopian and inde thi is so for often i have notic
that if an ethiopian wed with on of anoth colour their offspr
is black down to the third or fourth gener therefor karema long
for egypt notwithstand the splendour in which she dwelt
so greatli did she long that she had recours to the magic lore which
she had learn from the holi tanofir and would sit for hour gaze
into water in a crystal bowl or sometim into a ball of crystal
without the water try to see vision therein that had to do with
what pass in egypt moreov in time much of her gift return to her
and she did see mani thing which she repeat to me for she would tell
no on els of them not even her husband
thu she saw amada kneel in a shrine befor the statu of isi and
weep a pictur that made me sad also she saw the holi tanofir
brood in the dark of the cave of the bull and read in hi mind
that he wa think of us though what he thought she could not read
again she saw eastern messeng deliv letter to pharaoh and knew
from hi face that he wa disturb and that egypt wa threaten with
calam and so forth
soon the new of her power of divin spread abroad so that all the
ethiopian grew to fear her as a seeress and thenceforth whatev thei
mai have thought none of them dare to sai that she wa ugli further
her gift wa real sinc if she told me of a certain thing such as that
messeng were approach in due cours thei would arriv and make
clear much that she had not been abl to understand in her vision
now from the time that i grew strong again and as soon as be wa firmli
seat on hi throne he and i set to work to train and drill the armi
of the ethiopian which hitherto had been littl more than a mob of men
carri bow and sword we divid it into phalanx after the greek
fashion and arm these bodi with long lanc sword and larg
shield in the place of the small on thei had carri befor also we
train the archer teach them to advanc in open order and shoot
from cover and lastli chose the best soldier to be captain and
gener so it came about that at the end of the two year that i
spent in ethiopia there wa a forc of sixti thousand men or more whom
i should not have been afraid to match against ani troop in the world
sinc thei were of great strength and courag and as i have said by
natur lover of war also their bow be longer and more power
thei could shoot arrow farther than the eastern or the egyptian
the ethiopian lord wonder why their king and i did these thing
sinc thei saw no enemi against which so great an armi could be led to
battl on that matter be and i kept our own counsel tell them onli
that it wa good for the men to be train to war sinc hear of
their wealth on dai the king of king might attempt to invad their
countri so month by month i labour at thi task lead armi into
distant region to accustom them to travel far afield carri with
them what wa necessari for their susten
so it went on until a sad thing happen sinc on return from on
of these forai in which i had punish a tribe that had murder some
ethiopian hunter and we had taken mani thousand of their cattl i
found my mother dy she had been smitten by a fever which wa common
at that season of the year and be old and weak had no strength to
throw it off
as medicin did not help her the priest of the grasshopp prai dai
and night in their templ for her recoveri ye there thei prai to a
golden locust stand on an altar in a sanctuari that wa surround by
crystal coffin wherein rest the flesh of former king of the land
to me the sight wa piti but be ask me what wa the differ
between prai to a locust and prai to imag with the head of
beast or to a dwarf shape as he wa like we did in egypt and i could
not answer him
the truth is brother he said for so he call me now that all
peopl in the world do not offer petit to what thei see and have
been taught to rever but to someth beyond of which to them it is
a sign but why the ethiopian should have chosen a grasshopp as a
symbol of god who is everywher is more than i can tell still thei
have done so for thousand of year
when i came to my mother bedsid she wa wander and i saw that she
could not live long in a littl while howev her mind clear so
that she knew me and tear of joi ran down her pale cheek becaus i had
return befor she di she remind me that she had alwai said that
she would find a grave in ethiopia and ask to be buri and not kept
abov ground in crystal as wa the custom there then she said that she
had been dream of my father and of me also that she did not think
that i need fret myself overmuch about amada sinc she wa sure that
befor long i should kiss her on the lip
i ask if she meant that i should marri her and that we should be happi
and fortun she repli that she suppos that i should marri her
but of the rest would sai noth inde her face grew troubl as
though some thought hurt her and leav the matter of amada she bade
karema bring me the rosehu pearl bless me prai for our reunion
in the hall of osiri and straightwai di
so i caus her to be embalm after the egyptian fashion and enclos
in a coffin of crystal with a scarab on her heart that karema had
discov somewher in the citi for alwai she wa search for
thing that remind her of egypt whereof mani were to be found brought
from time to time by travel or stranger then with such ceremoni
as we could without the servic of the priest of osiri karema and i
buri her in a tomb that be had caus to be made near to the step of
the templ of the grasshopp while be and hi nobl watch from a
distanc
and so farewel to my belov mother the ladi tiu
after she wa gone i grew veri sad and lone while she live i had a
home but now i wa an exil a stranger in a strang land with no on
of my own peopl to talk to except karema with whom as there were
gossip even in ethiopia i thought it well not to talk too much there
wa be it wa true but now he wa a great king and the time of king
is not their own moreov be wa be and an ethiopian and i wa i and
an egyptian and therefor notwithstand our love and brotherhood we
could never be like men of the same blood and countri
i grew weari of ethiopia with it useless gold and damp etern green
and heat and long for the sand and the keen desert air be note it
and offer me wive but i shrank from these black women howev buxom
and kindli and wish for no offspr of their race whom afterward i
could never leav to egypt i had sworn not to return unless on voic
call me and it remain silent what then wa i to do be no longer
content to disciplin and command an armi that i might not lead into
battl
at length i made up my mind by natur i wa a hunter as much as a
soldier i would beg from be a band of brave men whom i knew lover
of adventur who sought new thing and with them strike down south
follow the path of the eleph to wherev the god might lead us
doubtless in the end it would be to death but what matter when there is
noth for which on care to live
while i wa brood over these plan karema read my mind perhap
becaus it wa her own perhap by help of her strang art which i do
not know at least on dai when i wa sit alon look at the citi
beneath from on of the palac windowplac she came to me look
veri beauti and veri mystic in the white robe she alwai love to
wear and said
my lord shabaka you tire of thi land of honei and sweet and soft
air and flower and gold and crystal and black peopl who grin and
chatter and ar not pleasant to be near is it not so
ye queen i answer
do not call me queen my lord shabaka for i weari of that name as we
both do of the rest call me karema the arab or karema the cup which
you will but by the name of thoth god of learn do not call me
queen
karema then i said well how do you know that i tire of all thi
karema
how could you do otherwis who ar not a barbarian and who have egypt
in your heart and egypt fate and here she look me straight in
the ey egypt ladi besid i measur you by myself
you at least should be happi karema who ar great and rich and
belov and the wife of a king who is on of the best of men and the
mother of children
ye shabaka i should be but i am not for who can live on sweetmeat
onli especi when thei like what is sour see now how strang we
ar made when i wa a girl the daughter of an arab chief well bred
and well taught as it chanc i tire of the hard life of the desert
and the narrow mind about me i who long for wisdom and to know great
men then i becam the cup of the holi tanofir and wisdom wa all about
me strang wisdom from anoth world rough sharp wisdom from tanofir
and the quiet wisdom of the dead among whom i dwelt i weari of that
also shabaka i wa beauti and knew it and i long to shine in
a court to be admir among men to be envi of women to rule my
husband came my wai he wa clever with a great heart he wa your
friend and therefor i wa sure that he must be loyal and true he wa
or might be a king as i knew though he thought that i did not i
marri him and the holi tanofir laugh but he did not sai me nai and
i becam a queen and now i wish sometim that i were dead or back
hold the cup of the holi tanofir with the wisdom of the heaven
flow round me and the soft dark of the tomb about me it seem
that in thi world we never can be content shabaka
no karema we onli think that we should be if thing were otherwis
than thei ar but how can i help you karema
least of all by go awai and leav me alon she answer with the
tear start to her ey
look at her i began to think that the best thing i could do would be
to go awai and at onc but as ever she read my thought shook her head
and laugh
no no i have put on my yoke and will carri it to the end have i not
two black children and a husband who is a hero a wit and a mountebank
in on and a throne and more gold and crystal than i ever wish to see
again even in a dream and shall i not cling to these good thing if
you went i should onli be a littl more unhappi than befor that is
all not for my sake do i ask you to stai but for your own
how for my own karema i have done all that i can do here i have
built the armi afresh from cookboi to gener be need me no longer
who ha you hi children and hi countri and i die of weari
you can stop to make us of that armi you have built afresh shabaka
against whom there ar none to fight
against the great king of the east listen my gift of vision ha grown
strong and clear of late onli todai i have seen a meet between
pharaoh the holi tanofir and the ladi amada thei were all disturb
i know not at what and the end of it wa that amada wrote in a roll
and gave the write to messeng who i think even now ar speed
southwardto you shabaka nai do not look doubtfulli on me it is
true
then you did well to tell me karema for within a moon of thi dai i
should have been where perhap no messeng would have found me now
i will wait and let it be your part to prepar the mind of be do you
think that he would give me an armi to lead to egypt if there were
need
she nod and answer
he would do so for three reason the first is becaus he love you
the second becaus he too weari of ethiopia and thi rich fat life of
peac and the third becaus i shall tell him that he must
then why troubl to speak of the other two i said laugh
so i stai on in the citi of the grasshopp and busi myself with
the question of how to transport and feed a great armi that must hold
the field for six month or a year also with the set of hundr of
skill men to the make of bow arrow sword and shield nor did
be sai me no in these matter inde he help them forward by issu
the order as hi own wherein i saw the hand of karema
three month went by and i began to think that karema power had been
at fault or that her vision wa on that came from her lip and not
from her heart to keep me in ethiopia but again she read my mind and
smile
not so shabaka she said those messeng have come to troubl and
ar detain by a petti tribe beyond our border over some matter of a
woman ten dai ago the frontier guard march to set them free
so again i wait and at length the messeng came three of them
egyptian and three men of ethiopia who dwelt in egypt to learn it

tanofir to wait upon him forthwith for reason that he will explain
when she arriv or to brave hi curs upon her her children her
countri and her husband and not onli hi but that of the spirit who

the curs of the holi tanofir is not a thing to mock at said be as
i who rever him know as well as ani man
no husband and therefor i leav for egypt as soon as mai be it
seem that my sister is dead thi year past and the holi tanofir ha

and what shall i do ask be
that is for you to sai husband but if you will you can stai here
and guard our children give the command of your armi to the lord
shabaka
now for we were alon be twist himself about roll hi ey and
laugh as he us to do befor he becam karoon of ethiopia
ohoho wife he said so you ar to go to egypt leav me to plai
the nurs to babe and my brother here is to command my armi leav

think that i shall come also that is if my brother wish it did he
not save my life and is it not hi and with it all i have oh have
done onc more we will stand side by side in the battl brother and
afterward let fate do as it will with us tell me now what is the tale
of archer and of swordsmen with which we can march against the great
king with whom like you i have a score to settl
seventi and five thousand i answer
good on the fifth dai from now the armi march for egypt
chapter xvi tanofir find hi broken cup
march we did but on the fifteenth dai not the fifth sinc there
wa much to make readi first the council of the ethiopian must be
consult and through them the peopl in the begin there wa
troubl over the matter sinc mani were against a distant war and thi
even after be had urg that it wa better to attack than wait to be
attack for thei answer and justli that here in ethiopia distanc
and the desert were their shield sinc the king of king howev
great hi strength would be weari and famish befor he set foot
within their border
in the end the knot wa cut with a sword for when the armi came to
learn of the disput from the gener down to the common soldier
everi man clamour to be led to war sinc as i have said these
ethiopian were fighter all of them and near at hand there were none
left with whom thei could fight so when the council came to see that
thei must choos between war abroad and revolt at home thei gave wai
bargain onli that the children of the karoon should not leav the
land so that if aught befel him there would be some of the true blood
left to succe
also the grasshopp wa consult by the priest who found the omen
favour inde i wa told that thi great golden locust sat up upon
it hind leg upon the altar and wave it feeler in the air which
onli happen when wonder fortun wa about to bless the land the
tale remind me of the nod of the statu of our own god in egypt
when a new pharaoh wa present to them and of that of isi when amada
put up her prayer to the divin mother to tell the truth i suspect
karema of have some hand in the busi howev so it happen
at length we set forth a mighti host be command the swordsmen and
i under him the archer of whom there were more than thirti thousand
men and glad wa i when all the farewel were said and we were free of
the weep crowd of women at first be and karema were somewhat sad
at part from their children but in a littl while thei grew gai
again sinc the on long for battl and the other for the sand of
egypt
now of our advanc i need sai littl except that it wa slow though
none dare to bar the road of so mighti an arrai sinc we must go on
foot we were not abl to cover more than five leagu a dai for even
after we reach the river boat could not be found for so mani though
karema travel in on with her ladi also cattl and corn must
alwai be sent forward for food still we crept on to egypt without
sick accid or revolt
when we drew near to it frontier messeng met us from pharaoh
bear letter in answer to those which we had sent with the tide
of our come these contain littl but ill new it seem that the
great king with a countless host had taken all the citi of the delta
and after a long sieg had captur memphi and put it to the sack
and that the armi of egypt fight desper by land and upon the
nile wa be driven southward toward thebe pharaoh ad that he
propos to make hi last stand at the strong citi of amada sinc he
doubt whether the troop from lower egypt would not rather surrend
to the eastern than retreat further up the nile he thank and bless
us for our promis aid and prai that it might come in time to save
egypt from slaveri and himself from death
also there wa a letter for me from amada in which she said
oh come quickli come quickli belov shabaka lest of me you
should find but bone for never will i fall live into the hand
of the great king we ar sore press and although amada ha been
made veri strong it can stand but a littl while against such a
countless multitud arm with all the engin of war
for karema too there were messag from the holi tanofir of the same
mean sai that unless we appear within a moon of their receipt
all wa lost
we read and took counsel then we press forward by doubl march
send swift runner forward to bid pharaoh and hi armi hold on to the
last spear and arrow
on the twentyfifth dai from the receipt of thi new we came to the
great frontier citi which we found in tumult for it citizen were
mad with fear here we rest on night and at of the food that wa
gather there in plenti then leav a small rearguard of five
thousand men who were tire out to hold the place we press onward
for amada wa still four dai march awai on the morn of the fourth
dai we were told that it wa fall or had fallen and when at length
we came in sight of the place we saw that it wa beleagu by an
innumer host of eastern while on the nile wa a great fleet of
grecian and cyprian mercenari moreov herald from the king of
king reach us sai
surrend barbarian or befor the second dai dawn you shall sleep
sound everi on of you
to these we answer that we would take counsel on the matter and that
perhap on the morrow we would surrend sinc when we had march from
ethiopia we did not know how great wa the king strength have been
deceiv as to it by the letter of the pharaoh meanwhil that the
king of king would do well to let us alon sinc we were brave men and
meant to die hard and it would be better for him to leav us to march
back to ethiopia rather than lose an armi in try to kill us
with these word which were spoken by be himself the messeng
depart on of them howev who seem to be a great lord call in
a loud voic to hi companion sai it wa hard that nobl should
have to do the errand not of a man but of an ap who would look better
hang to a pole be made no answer onli roll hi yellow ey and
said when the lord wa out of hear
now by the grasshopp and all the god of egypt i swear that in
payment for thi insult i will choke the nile with the armi of the great
king and hang that knave to a pole from the prow of the royal ship
which last thing i hope he did
when the embassi had gone be gave order that the whole armi should eat
and lie down to sleep
i am sure said he that the great king will not attack us at onc
sinc he will hope that we shall flee awai dure the night have seen
hi strength
so the ethiopian fill themselv and then lai down to sleep which
these peopl can do at ani time even if not tire as thei were but
while thei rest be and i and karema with some of the gener
consult togeth long and earnestli for in truth we knew not what
to do but a leagu awai lai the town of amada beset by hundr of
thousand of the eastern so that none could come in or out and within
it wall were the remain of pharaoh armi not more than twenti
thousand men all told if what we heard were true on the nile also
wa the great grecian and cyprian fleet two hundr vessel and more
though as we could see by the light of the set sun the most of these
were made fast to the western bank where the egyptian could not come at
them
for the rest our posit wa good be on high desert beyond the
cultiv land which border the eastern bank but in front of us
separ us from the southern armi of the king stretch a swamp hard
to cross so that we could not hope to make an attack by night as there
wa no moon lastli the main eastern strength to the number of two
hundr thousand or more lai to the north beyond amada
all these thing we consid talk low and earnestli there in the
tent till it grew so dark that we could not see each other face
while behind us slumber our armi that now number some seventi
thousand men
we ar in a trap said be at length if we await attack thei will
weigh us down with number if we flee thei have camel and hors and
will overtak us also ship of which we have none if we attack it must
be without cover through swamp where we shall be bog
meanwhil pharaoh is perish within yonder wall of amada which the
engin batter down by the grasshopp i know not what to do it seem
that our journei is vain and that few of us will see ethiopia more also
that egypt is sped
i made no answer for here my generalship fail me and i had noth
to sai the captain too were silent onli womanlik karema wept a
littl and i too went near to weep who thought of amada pen in
yonder templ like a lamb that await the butcher knife
suddenli come from the door of the tent which i thought wa close i
heard a deep voic sai
i have ever note that those of ethiopian blood ar melancholi after
sundown though of egyptian i had thought better thing
now about thi voic there wa someth familiar to me still i said
noth nor did the other for to speak the truth all of us were
frighten and thought that we must dream for how could ani thing that
breath approach thi tent through a tripl line of sentri so we sat
still stare at the dark till present in that dark appear
a glow of light such as come from the firefli of ethiopia it grew
and grew while we gasp with fear till present it took shape and
the shape it took wa that of the ancient wither face the sightless
ey and the white beard of the holi tanofir ye there not two feet
from the ground seem to float the head of the holi tanofir limn in
faint flame which i suppos must have been reflect on to it from the
light of some campfir without
o my belov master cri karema and threw herself toward him
o my belov cup answer tanofir glad am i to know you well and
unshatt
then a torch wa lit and lo there befor us wrap in hi dark cloak
sat the holi tanofir
whenc come you my greatuncl i ask amaz
from less far than you do nephew he answer name out of amada
yonder oh ask me not how it is easi if you ar a blind old beggar
who know the path and by the wai if you have aught to eat i should be
glad of a bite and a sup sinc in amada food ha been scarc for thi
last month and tonight there is littl left
karema sped from the tent and present return with bread and wine of
which tanofir partook almost greedili
thi is the first strong drink that i have tast for mani a year he
said as he drain the goblet but better a broken vow than broken wit
when on ha much to plan and do at least i hope the god will think so
when i meet them present therei am strong again now sai what is
your forc
we told him
good and what is your plan
we shook our head have none
be he said sternli i think you grow dull sinc you becam a
kingor perhap it is marriag that make you so why in bygon year
scheme would have come so fast that thei would have choke each other
between those thick lip of your and shabaka tell me have you lost
all your generalship whereof onc you had plenti in the soft air of
ethiopia or is it that even the shadow of marriag make you dull
well i must turn to the woman for that is alwai the lot of man your
plan karema and quickli for there is no time to lose
now the face of karema grew fix and her ey dreami as she spoke in a
slow measur voic like on who know not what she sai
my plan is to destroi the armi of the great king and to reliev the
citi of amada
a veri good plan said holi tanofir but the question is how
i think went on karema that about a leagu abov thi place there
is a spot where at thi season the nile can be ford by tall men
without the wet of their shoulder first then i would send five
thousand swordsmen across that ford and let them creep down on the navi
of the great king where the sailor revel in safeti or sleep sound and
fire the ship the wind blow strongli from the south and the flame
will leap fast from on of them to the other most of their crew will
be burn and the rest can be slain by our five thousand
good veri good said the holi tanofir but not enough see that
on the eastern bank is gather the host of over two hundr thousand
men now how will you deal with them karema
i seem to see a road yonder beyond the swamp it run on the edg of
the desert but behind the sandhil i would send the archer of whom
there ar more than thirti thousand under the command of shabaka along
that road which lead them past amada on it farther side ar low hill
strewn with rock here i would let the archer take cover and wait for
the break of the dawn then beneath them thei will see the most of
the eastern host and with such bow as our thei can sweep the plain
from the hill almost to the nile and have a hundr arrow to a man
should slaughter the eastern by the ten thousand for when these turn
to charg a shaft should pierc through two togeth
good again said tanofir but what of the armi of the great king
which li upon thi side of amada
i think that befor the dawn believ us so few it will advanc and
with the first light begin to thread the swamp and therefor we must
keep five thousand archer to gall it as it come still it will win
through though with loss and find us wait for it here shoulder to
shoulder rank upon rank with lock shield against which hors
and foot shall break in vain for who shall drive a wedg through the
ethiopian squar that shabaka ha train and that be the karoon
command i sai that thei shall roll back like wave from a cliff ye
again and again grow ever fewer till the clamour of battl and
the shout of fear and agoni reach their ear from beyond amada where
shabaka and the archer do their work and the sight of the burn ship
strike terror in them and thei fly
good again said the holi tanofir but still mani on both front will
be left for thi armi of eastern is veri vast and how will you deal
with these o karema
on these i would have pharaoh with all hi remain strength pour
from the northern and the southern gate of amada for so shall thei be
caught like wound lion between two wild bull and torn and trampl
and utterli destroi onli i know not how to tell pharaoh what he must
do and when
good again said the holi tanofir veri good and as for the tell
of pharaoh well i shall see him present it is strang my chip
cup which i had almost thrown awai as useless that although broken you
still hold so much wisdom for know wonder though it mai seem that
just such plan as you have spoken have grown up in my own mind onli i
wish to learn if you thought them wise
then he laugh a littl and karema stretch her arm as on doe who
awak from sleep rub her ey and ask if he would not eat more
food
in an instant tanofir wa speak again in a quick clear voic
be or king he said doubtless you will do your wife will
therefor let the host be arous and stand to it arm as it chanc
i have four men without who can be trust two of these will guid the
five thousand to the ford and across it also down upon the ship the
other two will guid shabaka and the archer along the road which karema
rememb so well perhap she trod it as a child for my part i return
to amada to make sure that pharaoh doe hi share and at the right time
for mark unless all thi is carri through tonight amada will fall
tomorrow a certain priestess will die and you be and your soldier
will never look on ethiopia again is it agre
i nod who did not wish to wast time in word and be roll hi
ey and answer
when on can think of noth it is best to follow the counsel of
those who can think of someth also to hunt rather than to be hunt
especi is thi so if that someth come from the holi tanofir or
hi broken cup gener you have heard rous the host and bid them
stand to their arm compani by compani
the gener leapt awai into the dark like arrow from a bow and
present we heard the nois of gather men
where ar these guid of your holi tanofir ask be
tanofir beckon over hi shoulder and out of the gloom on by on
four men stole into the tent thei were strang quiet men but i can
sai no more of them sinc their face were veil nor as it chanc
did i ever see ani of them after the battl in which i suppos that
thei were kill or perhap thei appear afterwel never mind
you have heard said tanofir whereupon all four of them bow their
mysteri veil head
now my brother whisper be into my ear tell me i prai you how
did four men who were not in the tent hear what wa said in thi tent
and how did thei come through the guard who have order to kill anyon
who doe not know the countersign especi men whose face ar
wrap in napkin
i do not know i answer whereon be groan onli karema smile a
littl as though to herself
then have heard obei said the holi tanofir whereon the four
veil on bow again
will you not give them their order o most vener inquir be
doubtfulli
i think it is needless said tanofir in a dry voic why try to teach
those who know
will you not offer them someth to eat sinc thei also must be
hungri i ask of karema
fool be silent she repli look on me with contempt do
thefriendsof tanofir need to eat
i should have thought so after be beleagu for a month in a
starv town if the master want to eat why should not hi men i
murmur
then a thought struck me and i wa silent
a gener return and report that the order had been execut and
that all the armi wa afoot
good said be then start forthwith with five thousand men and burn
those ship accord to the plan laid down by the queen karema which
you heard her speak but now and he name certain regiment that he
should take with him those of the gener own command ad save
some of the ship if you can and afterward cross the nile in them with
your men and join yourself either to my forc or to that of the lord
shabaka accord to what you see mai the grasshopp give you victori
and wisdom
the gener salut and ask
who guid us to and across the ford of the great river
two of the veil men step forward whereon the gener mutter into
my ear
i like not the look of them i prai the grasshopp thei do not guid
us across the river of death
have no fear gener said the holi tanofir from the other end of the
tent if you and your men plai their part as well as the guid will
plai their the ship ar alreadi burn togeth with their compani
onli take fire with you
so that gener depart with the two guid look somewhat
frighten and soon wa march up nile at the head of five thousand
swordsmen
now be look at me and said
it seem that you had better be gone also my brother with the
archer perchanc the holi tanofir will show you whither
no no answer tanofir my guid will show him look not so
doubt shabaka did i fail you when you were in the grip of the king
of king in the east and onli your own life and that of be were at
stake
i do not know i answer
you do not know but i know as i think do be and karema sinc the
on receiv the messag which the other sent well if i did not fail
you then shall i fail you now when egypt is at stake follow these
guid i give you and here he took hold of the quiver of arrow
that lai besid me on the ground and as certainli as though he could
see it with hi blind ey touch on of them on the shaft of which
were two black and a white feather rememb my word after you have
loos thi arrow from your great black bow and note where it strike
then i turn to be and ask
where do we meet again
i cannot sai brother he answer in amada if that mai be if not
at the tabl of osiri or in the field of the grasshopp or in the
black which swallow all god and men togeth
doe karema come with me or bide with you i ask again
she doe neither interrupt tanofir she accompani me to amada
where i have need of her and she will be more safe oh fear noth
for everi hermit howev poor still carri hi staff and hi cup even
if it be crack
then i shook be by the hand and went my wai wonder if i were awak
or dream and the last thing i saw in that tent wa the beauti
face of karema smile at me thi i took to be a good omen sinc i
knew that it wa the heart of the holi tanofir which smile and that
her ey were but it mirror
alreadi my thirti thousand archer were marshal and have made
sure that there wa ampl store of arrow and that all their gourd
were fill with water i set myself at their head while in front of me
walk the two veil guid i look upon them doubtfulli sinc it
seem danger to trust an armi to unknown men who for aught i knew
might lead us into the midst of our foe then i rememb that thei
were vouch for by the holi tanofir my own greatuncl whom i trust
abov ani man on earth and took heart again
how had he come into our tent i wonder and how blind as he wa
would he get back into amada with karema if he took her well who
could account for the go or the come of the holi tanofir who wa
more of a spirit than a man perhap it wa not realli he whom we had
seen but what we egyptian call hi ka or doubl which can pass
to and fro at will onli do ka eat of thi matter i knew onli that
offer of food and drink ar made to them in tomb so leav the
holi tanofir to guard himself i turn my mind to our own busi
which wa to surpris the armi of the great king
skirt the swamp we came to rough and higher ground and though i could
see littl in that dark i knew that we were walk up a hill
present we cross it crest and descend for three bowshot or so
i felt that my feet were on a road now the guid turn to the left
and after them in a long line came my armi of thirti thousand archer
in utter silenc we went sinc we had no beast with us and our
sandal feet made littl nois moreov order had been pass down
the line that the man who made a sound should die
for two hour or more we march thu then bore to the left again and
climb a slope by which time i judg we must be well past the town
of amada here suddenli the guid halt and we after them at whisper
word of command on of them took me by the cloak led me forward a
littl wai to the crest of the ridg and point with hi whitesleev
arm i look and there beneath me well within bowshot were thousand
of the watchfir of the king armi flare some of them in the
strong wind for a full leagu those fire burn and we were opposit
to the midmost of them
see now gener shabaka said the guid speak for the first time
in a curiou hiss whisper such as might come from a man who had no
lip beneath you sleep the eastern host which be so great ha
not thought it need to guard thi ridg now marshal your archer in
a fourfold line in such fashion that at the first break of dawn thei
can take cover behind the rock and shoot everi man of them without
pierc hi fellow do you bide here with the centr where your
standard can be seen by all to north and south i and my companion will
lead your vanguard farther on to where the ridg draw nearer to the
nile so that with their arrow thei can hold back and slai ani who
strive to escap down stream the rest is in your hand for we ar
guid not gener summon your captain and issu your command
so we went back again and i call the offic togeth and told them
what thei were to do then despatch them to their regiment
present the vanguard of ten thousand men drew awai and vanish and
with them the whiterob guid on whom i never look again then i
marshal my centr as well as i could in the gloom and bade them lie
down to rest and sleep if thei were abl also within thirti minut of
the sunris to eat and drink a littl of the food thei carri to
see that everi bow wa readi and that the arrow were loosen in everi
quiver thi done with a few whom i trust to serv me as messeng
and guard i crept up to the brow of the hill or slope and there we
laid us down and watch
chapter xvii the battleand after
two hour went by and i knew by the star that the dawn could not be far
awai my ey were fix upon the nile and on the light that hung to
the prow of the great king ship where were those who had been sent
to fire them i wonder for of them i saw noth well their journei
would be long as thei must wade the river perhap thei had not yet
arriv or perhap thei had miscarri at least the fleet seem veri
quiet none were alarm there and no sentri challeng
at length it grew near to dawn and behind me i heard the gentl stir of
the ethiopian aris and eat as thei had been bidden whereon i
too at and drank a littl though never had i less wish for food the
east brighten and far up the nile of a sudden there appear what at
first i took to be a meteor or a lantern wave in the wind that now wa
blow it strongest as it doe at thi season of the year just at the
time of dawn yet that lantern seem to travel fast and lo now i saw
that it wa fire run up the rig of a ship
it leapt from rope to rope and from sail to sail till thei blaze
fierc and in other ship also nearer to us flame appear that grew
to a great red sheet our men had not fail the navi of the king of
king wa burn oh how it burn fan by the breath of that strong
wind from vessel to vessel leapt the fire like a thing aliv for all
of them were drawn up on the bank with prow fasten in such fashion
that thei could not readili be made loos some broke awai inde but
thei were aflam and onli serv to spread the fire more quickli befor
the rim of the sun appear for a leagu or more there wa noth but
blaze ship from which rose a hideou cry and still more and more
took fire lower down the line
i had no time to watch for now i must be up and do the sky grew
grei there wa light enough to see though faintli i cast my ey about
me and perceiv that no place in the world could have been better for
archeri in front the hill wa steep for a hundr pace or more and
scatter over with thousand of larg stone behind which bowmen might
take shelter then came a gentl slope of loos sand up which attack
would find it hard to climb then the long flat plain whereon the
eastern were camp and beyond it scarc two furlong awai the bank
of nile
inde the place wa illchosen for so great an armi nor could it have
held them all had not the camp ground been a full leagu in length
and even so thei were crowd out of the mist their tent appear
thousand of them farther than my ey could reach and almost opposit
to me near to the bank of the river wa a great pavilion of silk
and gold that i guess must shelter the majesti of the king of king
inde thi wa certain sinc now i saw that over it float hi royal
banner which i knew so well i who had stolen the littl white signet
of signet from which it wa taken truli the holi tanofir or hi cup
karema or hi messeng or the spirit with whom he dwelt i know not
which had a gener ey and knew how to plan an ambuscad
so thought i to myself as i ran back to my armi to meet the gather
captain and set all thing in order it wa soon done for thei were
readi as were the fierc ethiopian fresh from their rest and food
and string their bow everi on of them or loosen the arrow in
their quiver as i came thei lift their hand in salut for speak
thei dare not and i sent a whisper down their rank that thi dai
thei must fight and conquer or fall for the glori of ethiopia and their
king then i gave my order and befor the sun rose and reveal them
thei crept forward in a fourfold line and took shelter behind the
stone ly there invis on their belli until the moment came
the red rim of ra appear gloriou in the east and i from behind the
rock that i had chosen sat down and watch oh truli tanofir or
the god of egypt were order thing aright for us the huge camp wa
awak now and awar of what wa happen on the nile thei could not
see well becaus of the tall reed upon the river rim and therefor
without order or disciplin by the thousand and the ten thousand for
their number were countless some with arm and some without thei ran
to the slope of sand beneath our station and began to climb it to have a
better view of the burn ship
the sun leapt up swiftli as it doe in egypt hi glow edg appear
over the crest of the hill though the hollow beneath were still fill
with shadow the moment wa at hand i wait till i had count ten
glanc to the right and left of me to see that all were readi and to
suffer the crowd to thicken on the slope but not to reach the lowest
rock whither thei were climb then i gave the doubl signal that
had been agre
behind me the banner of the golden grasshopp wa rais upon a tall
pole and broke upon the breez that wa the first signal whereat everi
man rose to hi knee and set shaft on string next i lift my bow the
black bow the ancient bow that few save i could bend and drew it to my
ear
far awai out of arrowreach as most would have said float the great
king standard over hi pavilion at thi i aim make allow for
the wind and shot the shaft leapt forward seen in the sunlight lost
in the shadow seen in the sunlight again and lastli seen onc more
pin that golden standard against it pole
at the sight of the omen a roar went up that roll to right and left of
us a roar from thirti thousand throat now it wa lost in a sound like
to the hiss of thunder rain in ethiopia the sound of thirti thousand
arrow rush through the wind oh thei were well aim those arrow
for i had not taught the ethiopian archeri in vain
how mani went down befor them the god of egypt know alon i do not
all i know is that the long slope of sand which had been crowd with
stand men wa now thick with fallen men mani of whom lai as though
thei were asleep for what mail could resist the ironpoint shaft
driven by the strong bow of the ethiopian
and thi wa but a begin for flight after flight those arrow
sped till the air grew dark with them soon there were no more to shoot
at on the slope for these were down and the order went to lift the
bow and draw upon the camp and especi upon the park of baggag
beast present these were down also or rush madden to and fro
at last the eastern gener saw and understood order were shout
and in a mad confus the score of thousand who were unharm rush
back toward the bank of nile where our shaft could not reach them
here thei form up in their compani and took counsel it wa soon
end for all the vast mass of them preced by a cloud of archer
began to advanc upon the hill
now i pass a command to the ethiopian of whom so far not on
had fallen to lie low and wait on came the glitter multitud of
eastern gai with purpl and gold their mail and sword shine in the
risen sun on thei came by squadron and by compani more than the ey
could number thei reach the sand slope thick with their own dead and
wound and paus a littl becaus thei could see no man sinc the
black bodi of the ethiopian were hid behind the black stone and the
black bow did not catch the light
then from a gorgeou group that i guess hid the person of the great
king surround by hi regiment of guard ten thousand of them who were
call immort messeng sprang forth scream the order to charg
the host began to climb the slipperi sand slope but still i held my hand
till their endless line were within fifti pace of us and their arrow
rattl harmlessli against our stone then i caus the banner of the
grasshopp that had been lower to be lift thrice and at the third
lift onc more thirti thousand arrow rush forth to kill
thei went down thei went down in line and heap riddl through and
through but still other came on for thei fought under the ey of the
great king and to fly meant death with shame and tortur we could not
kill them all thei were too mani we could not kill the half of them
now their foremost were within ten pace of us and sinc we must stand
up to shoot our men began to fall also pierc with arrow i caus
the blast of retreat to be sound on the ivori horn and step by step we
drew back to the crest of the ridg shoot as we went on the crest
we reform rapidli in a doubl line stand as close as we could
togeth and my exampl wa follow all down the rank to right and
left then i bethought me of a plan that i had taught these archer
again and again in ethiopia
with the flag i signal a command to stop shoot and also pass the
word down the line so that present no more arrow flew the eastern
hesit wonder whether thi were a trap or if we lack shaft
and meanwhil i sent messeng with certain order to the vanguard who
sped awai at speed behind the hill run as thei never ran befor
present i heard a voic below cry out
the great king command that the barbarian be destroi let the
barbarian be destroi
now with a roar thei came on like a flood i wait till thei were
within twenti pace of us and shout shoot and fall
the first line shot and oh fear wa it work for not a shaft miss
those crowd host and mani pin two togeth my archer shot and
fell down set new arrow to the string as thei fell whereon the
second line also shot over them then up we sprang and loos again and
again fell down whereon the second line onc more pour in it deadli
hail
now the eastern stai their advanc for their front rank lai prone
and those behind must climb over them if thei could ye stand there
in glitter group thei rock and hesit although their offic
struck them with sword and lanc to drive them forward onc more our
front rank rose and loos and onc more we drop and let the shaft
of the second speed over us it wa too much flesh and blood could not
bear more of those arrow thousand upon thousand were down and the
rest began to flee in confus
then at my command the ivori horn sound the charg everi man slung
hi bow upon hi back and drew hi short sword
on to them i cri and leapt forward
like a black torrent we rush down the hill leap over the dead and
wound the retreat becam a rout sinc befor these ebon greatei
warrior the soft eastern did not care to stand thei fled scream
these ar devil these ar devil
we were among them now hack and stab with the short sword upon
their head and back there wa no need to aim the blow thei were so
mani like a huddl mob of cattl thei turn and fled down nile but
my order had reach the vanguard and these hidden in the grow
crop on the narrow neck of swampi land between the hill and the nile
met them with arrow as thei came also rake them from the steep cliff
side their chariot wheel sank into the mud till the hors were slain
their footmen were pile in heap about them till soon there wa a
mighti wall of dead and dy and our centr and rearguard came up
behind oh we slew and slew till befor the sun wa an hour high over
half the armi of the great king wa no more then we reform have
suffer but littl loss and drank of the water of the nile
all is not done i cri
for the immort still remain behind us gather in mass rank
about their king also there were mani thousand of other between these
and the wall of amada and to the south of the citi yet a second armi
that with which be had been left to deal with what success i knew not
ethiopian i shout ceas cry victori sinc the battl is
about to begin strike and at onc befor the eastern find their heart
again
so we advanc upon the immort all of us for now the vanguard had
join our strength
in long line we advanc over that bloodsoak plain and as we came
the great king loos hi remain chariot against us it avail him
noth sinc the hors could not face our arrow whereof thank
be to the god i had prepar so ampl a store carri in bundl
by lad scarc a chariot reach our line and those that did were
destroi leav us unbroken
the chariot were done with and their driver dead but there still
frown the squar of the immort we shot at them till nearli all
our shaft were spent and gall to mad thei charg we did
not wait for the point of those long spear but ran in beneath them
strike with our short sword and oh grim and desper wa that
battl sinc the eastern were clad in mail and the ethiopian had but
short jerkin of bull hide
fight as we would we were driven back the frai turn against us and
we fell by hundr i bethought me of flight to the hill sinc now
we were outnumb and veri weari but behold when all seem lost a
great shout rose from amada and through her open gate pour forth
all that remain of the armi of pharaoh perhap eighteen or twenti
thousand men i saw and my heart rose again
stand firm i cri stand firm and lo we stood
the egyptian were on them now and in their midst i saw pharaoh
banner by degre the battl swai toward the bank of nile we to
the north the egyptian to the south and the eastern between us thei
were try to turn our flank ye and would have done it had there
not suddenli appear upon the nile a fleet of ship at first i thought
that we were lost for these ship were from greec and cypru till i
saw the banner of the grasshopp wave from a prow and knew that thei
were man by our five thousand who had gone out to burn the fleet
and had save these vessel thei beach and from their crowd hold
pour the five thousand or those that were left of them and rang
themselv upon the bank rais their warshout and attack the end
of the eastern line
now we charg for the last time and the egyptian charg from the
south haha the rank of the immort were broken at length we
were among them i saw pharaoh hi uru circlet on hi helm he wa
wound and sore beset a tall immort rush at him with a spear and
drove it home
pharaoh fell
i leapt over him and kill that eastern with a blow upon the neck but
my sword shatter on hi armour the tide of battl roll up and swept
us apart and i saw pharaoh be carri awai look yonder wa the
great king himself stand in a golden chariot the great king in all
hi glori whom last i had seen far awai in the east he knew me and shot
at me with a bow the bow he thought my own shout die dog of an
egyptian

but could not
the real rout began the immort were broken like an earthen jar thei
retreat in group fight desper and of these the thickest wa
around the great king he whom i hate wa about to escap me he still
had hors he would fly down nile gain hi reserv and so awai back
to the east where he would gather new and yet larger armi sinc men
in million were at hi command then he would return and destroi egypt
when perchanc there were no ethiopian to help her and perhap after
all drag amada to hi hous of women see thei were break through
and alreadi i wa far awai with a wound in my breast a hurt leg and a
shatter sword
what could i do my arrow were spent and the bearer had none left to
give me no there wa on still in the quiver i drew it out on it
shaft were two black feather and on white who had spoken of that
arrow i rememb tanofir i wa to think of certain thing that he
had said when i note what it pierc i unslung my bow strung it and
set that arrow on the string
by now the great king wa far awai out of reach for most archer hi
chariot forg ahead amidst the remnant of hi guard and the nobl
who attend on hi sacr person travel over a littl rise where
doubtless onc there had been a villag long sinc rot down to it
parent clai the sunlight glint on hi shine armour and silken robe
whereof the back wa toward me
i aim i drew i loos swift and far the shaft sped forward by
osiri it struck him full between the shoulder and lo the king of
king the monarch of the world lurch forward fell on to the rail of
hi chariot and roll to the ground next instant there aros a roar
of the king is dead the great king is dead fly fly fly
so thei fled and after them thunder the pursuer slai and slai
till thei could lift their arm no more oh ye some escap though
the men of thebe and countri folk murder mani of them and but a few
ever won back to the east to tell the tale of the blot out of the
mighti armi of the king of king and of the doom dealt to him by the
great black bow of shabaka the egyptian
i stood there gasp when suddenli i heard a voic at my side it
said
you seem to have done veri well brother even better than we did

a thing whereof to make a song also that last shot of your wa worthi
of a good archer for i mark it i mark it a great lord wa laid
low therebi let us go and see who it wa
i threw my arm round the bull neck of be and lean on him advanc
to where the king lai alon save for the fallen about him
thi man is not yet sped said be let us look upon hi face and
he turn him over and stretch him there upon the sand with the arrow
stand two span beyond hi corselet
why said be thi is a certain high on with whom we had deal
in the east and he laugh thickli
then the great king open hi ey and knew us and on hi dy
featur came a look of hate
so you have conquer egyptian he said oh if onli i had you again
in the east whenc in my folli i let you go
you would set me in your boat would you not whenc by the wisdom of
be i escap
more than that he gasp
i shall not serv you so i went on i shall leav you to die as a
warrior should upon a fair fought field but learn tyrant and murder
that the shaft which overthrew you came from the black bow you covet
and thought you had receiv and that thi hand loos itnot at
hazard
i guess it he whisper
know too king that the ladi amada whom you also covet wait to be
my wife that your mighti armi is destroi and that egypt is free by
the hand of shabaka the egyptian and be the dwarf
shabaka the egyptian he mutter whom i held and let go becaus of
a dream and for polici so shabaka you will wed amada whom i desir
becaus i could not take her and doubtless you will rule in egypt for
pharaoh i think is as i am todai o shabaka you ar strong and
a great warrior but there is someth stronger than you in the
worldthat which men call fate such success as your offend the god
look on me shabaka look on the king of king the ruler of the earth
ly shame in the dust befor you and accurs shabaka do not call
yourself happi until you see death as near as i do now
then he threw hi arm wide and di
we call to soldier to bear hi bodi and have set the pursuit with
that royal clai enter into amada in triumph it wa not a veri great
town and the templ wa it finest build and thither we wend in
the outer court we found pharaoh ly at the point of death for from
mani wound hi life drain out with hi flow blood nor could the
leech help him
greet shabaka he said you and the ethiopian have save egypt
my son is slain in the battl and i too am slain and who remain to
rule her save you you and amada would that you had marri her at
onc and never left my side but she wa foolish and headstrong and
iwa jealou of you shabaka forgiv me and farewel
he spoke no more although he live a littl while
karema came from the inner court she greet her husband then turn
and said
lord shabaka on wait to welcom you
i rest myself upon her shoulder for i could not walk alon
what happen to the armi of the karoon i ask as we went slowli
that happen lord which the holi tanofir foretold the eastern
attack across the swamp think to bear us down by number but the
path were too narrow and their column were bog in the mud
still thei struggl on against the arrow to it edg and there the
ethiopian fell on them and be lighterfoot and without armour had
the masteri of them who were encumb by their veri multitud oh i
saw it all from the templ top be did well and i am proud of him as i
am proud of you
it is of the ethiopian that you should be proud karema sinc with
on to five thei have won a great battl
we came to the end of the second court where wa a sanctuari
enter said karema and fell back
i did so and though the cedar door wa left a littl ajar at first
could see noth becaus of the gloom of the place by degre my ey
grew accustom to the dark and i perceiv an alabast statu
of the goddess isi of the size of life who held in her arm an ivori
child also lifes then i heard a sigh and look down saw a
woman clad in white kneel at the feet of the statu lost in prayer
suddenli she rose and turn and the rai of light from the door ajar
fell upon her it wa amada drape onli in the transpar robe of a
priestess and oh she wa beauti beyond imagin so beauti that
my heart stood still
she saw me in my batter mail and the blood flow up to her breast
and brow and in her ey there came a light such as i had never known
in them befor the light that is lit onli by the torch of woman love
ye no longer were her the ey of a priestess thei were the ey of
a woman who burn with mortal passion
amada i whisper amada found at last
shabaka she whisper back return at last to me your home and
she stretch out her arm toward me
but befor i could take her into mine she utter a littl cry and
shrank awai
oh not here she said not here in the presenc of thi holi on who
watch all that pass in heaven and earth
then perchanc amada she ha watch the free of egypt on yonder
field todai and know for whose sake it wa done
hearken shabaka i am your guerdon moreov as a woman i am your
there is naught i desir so much as to feel your kiss upon me for it
and it alon i am readi to risk my spirit death and torment but for
you i fear twice have i sworn myself to thi goddess and she is veri
jealou of those who rob her of her votari i fear that her curs will
fall not onli on me but on you also and not onli for thi life but for
all live that mai be given to us for your own sake i prai you leav
me i hear that pharaoh my uncl is dead or dy and doubtless thei
will offer you the throne take it shabaka for in it i ask no share

and you ar her priestess littl i care for isi who serv the goddess
love come kiss me here and now er perchanc i die kiss me who have
wait long enough and so let us be wed
on moment she paus swai in the wind of passion like a tall reed
on the bank of nile and then ah then she sank upon my breast and
press her lip against my own
and after
for a few moment i shabaka seem to be lost in a kind of delirium
and surround by a rosehu mist then i allan quatermain heard a
sharp quick sound as of a clock strike and look up it wa a lock
a beauti old clock on a mantelpiec opposit to me and the hand
show that it had just struck the hour of ten
now i rememb that centuri ago as i wa drop asleep i did not
know why i had seen that clock and those hand in the same posit and
known that it wa strike the second stroke of ten oh what did it all
mean had thousand of year gone by oronli eight second
there wa a weight upon my shoulder i glanc round to see what it
wa and discov the beauti head of ladi ragnal who wa sweetli

of the new moon abov her breast and not a second ago i had been in a
shrine with amada dress as ladi ragnal wa tonight in circumst
so intim that it made me blush to think of them ladi ragnal

sai that he must do so at onc as hi time wa veri short ye and
i wish that he would go awai oh my good she exclaim and
suddenli sprang up

between us in front of the fire stood the tripod and the bowl of black
stone at the bottom of which lai a pinch of white ash the remain of
the taduki we stare at it and at each other
oh where have we been shabai mean mr quatermain she gasp

in a sanctuari just now with me befor the statu of isi the same that
fell on georg two year ago and kill him and did you or did you not
give me a necklac of wonder rosi pearl which we put upon the neck
of the statu as a peaceoff becaus i had broken my vow to the
goddessthos that you won from the great king

that i should have taken those priceless pearl into battl i gave them
to karema to keep after my mother return them to me on her deathb
i rememb it distinctli
ye and karema hand them to me again as your lovetoken when she

the momentsometh to eat for we were near starv you know well
i threw them over your neck and my own in the shrine to be the symbol
of our etern union but afterward we thought that it might be wise
to offer them to the goddessto appeas her you know oh how dare we
plight our mortal troth there in her veri shrine and presenc and i her
twicesworn servant it wa insult heap on sacrileg
at a guess becaus love is stronger than fear i repli but it
seem that you dream a littl longer than i did so perhap you can
tell me what happen afterward i onli got as far aswel i forget
how far i got i ad for at that moment full memori return and i
could not go on
she blush to her ey and grew disturb

it you were bleed a good deal it stain me here and she touch
her breast and look down wonderingli at her sacr ancient robe as
though she expect to see that it wa red
as there is no stain now it must have been a dream but my word that
wa a battl i answer
ye i watch it from the pylon top and oh it wa gloriou do you
rememb the charg of the ethiopian against the immort why of
cours you must as you led it and then the fall of pharaoh peroah
wa georg you know and the death of the great king kill by your
black bow you were a wonder shot even then you see and the burn
of the ship how thei blaze anda hundr other thing
ye i said it came off the holi tanofir wa a good strategistor
hi cup wa i dont know which
and you were a good gener and so for the matter of that wa be oh
what agoni i went through while the fight hung doubt my heart wa
on fire ye i seem to burn for and she stop
for whom i ask
for egypt of cours and when reflect in the alabast i saw
you enter that shrine where you rememb i wa prai for your
successand safeti i nearli di of joi for you know i had been
well attach to youto shabaka i meanal the timethat my part
of the stori which i daresai you did not see although i seem so cold
and wayward i could love ye in that life i knew how to love and
shabaka look oh a hero with hi rent mail and the glori of triumph
in hi ey he wa veri handsom too in hi wai but what nonsens i
am talk

piti that you forget for i am craze with curios i suppos there is
no more taduki is there
not a scrap she answer firmli and if there were it would be fatal
to take it twice on the same dai we have learn all there is to learn
perhap it is as well though i should like to know what happen after
ourour marriag
so we were marri were we
i mean she went on ignor my remark whether you rule long in
egypt for you or rather shabaka did rule also whether the eastern
return and drove us out or what you see the ivori child went awai
somehow for we found it again in kendah land onli a few year ago
perhap we retir to ethiopia i suggest and the worship of the
child continu in some part of that countri after the ethiopian kingdom

perhap onli i dont think karema would ever have gone back to
ethiopia unless she wa oblig you rememb how she hate the place
no not even to see those black children of her well as we can never
tell it is no us specul
i thought there wa more taduki i remark sadli i am sure i

could look into it it mai be best so for as it stand the stori had
a happi end and i dont want to learn oh i dont want to learn how
the curs of isi fell on you and me
so you believ in that
ye i do she answer with passion and what is more i believ
it is work still which perhap is why we have all come down in the
world you and i and georg and han ye and even old hart whom we
knew in kendah land who i think wa the holi tanofir for as sure
as i live i know beyond possibl of doubt that whatev we mai

amada royal ladi of egypt and between us and about us the curs of
isi waver like a sword that is why georg wa kill and that is
whybut i feel veri tire i think i had better go to bed
as i recal that i have explain i wa oblig to leav ragnal castl
earli the next morn to keep a shoot engag o heaven to keep
a shoot engag
but whatev amada i mean ladi ragnal said there wa plenti more
taduki as i have good reason to know
