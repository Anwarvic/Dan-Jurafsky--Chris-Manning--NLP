chapter i
the storm
now i the editor whose duti it ha been as an executor or otherwis
to give to the world so mani histori of or connect with the
adventur of my dear friend the late allan quatermain or
macumazahn watcherbynight as the nativ in africa us to call
him come to on of the most curiou of them all here i should sai at
onc that he told it to me mani year ago at hi hous call the
grang in yorkshir where i wa stai but a littl while befor
he depart with sir henri curti and captain good upon hi last
expedit into the heart of africa whenc he return no more
at the time i made veri copiou note of a histori that struck me as
strang and suggest but the fact is that afterward i lost them
and could never trust my memori to reproduc even their substanc with
the accuraci which i knew my depart friend would have desir
onli the other dai howev in turn out a boxroom i came upon a
handbag which i recogn as on that i had us in the far past
when i wa practis or try to practis at the bar with a
certain emot such as overtak us when after the laps of mani
year we ar confront by articl connect with the longdead
event of our youth i took it to a window and with some difficulti
open it rust catch in the bag wa a small collect of rubbish
paper connect with case on which onc i had work as devil for
an emin and learn friend who afterward becam a judg a blue
pencil with a broken point and so forth
i look through the paper and studi my own margin note made on
point in caus which i had utterli forgotten though doubtless these
had been import enough to me at the time and with a sigh tore
them up and threw them on the floor then i revers the bag to knock
out the dust as i wa do thi there slip from an inner pocket
a veri thick notebook with a shini black cover such as us to be
bought for sixpenc i open that book and the first thing that my
ey fell upon wa thi head
summari of a qs strang stori of the monstergod or fetish
heuheu which he and the hottentot han discov in central
south africa
instantli everyth came back to me i saw myself a young man in
those dai make those shorthand note late on night in my bedroom
at the grang befor the impress of old allan stori had becom
dim in my mind also continu them on the train upon my journei
south on the morrow and subsequ expand them in my chamber at
elm court in the templ whenev i found time to spare
i rememb too my annoy when i discov that thi notebook
wa nowher to be found although i wa awar that i had put it awai
in some place that i thought particularli safe i can still see myself
hunt for it in the littl studi of the hous i had in a london
suburb at the time and at last give up the quest in despair then
the year went on and mani thing happen so that in the end both
note and the stori thei outlin were forgotten now thei have
appear again from the dustheap of the past reviv mani memori
and i set out the tale of thi particular chapter of the histori of
the adventur life of my belov friend allan quatermain who so
long ago wa gather to the shade that await us all
on night after a dai shoot wethat is old allan sir henri
curti captain good and iwer seat in the smoke room of
quatermain hous the grang in yorkshir smoke and talk of
mani thing
i happen to mention that i had read a paragraph copi from an
american paper which state that a huge reptil of an antediluvian
kind had been seen by some hunter in a swamp of the zambesi and
ask allan if he believ the stori he shook hi head and answer
in a cautiou fashion which suggest to me i rememb hi
unwilling to give hi view as to the continu exist of such
creatur on the earth that africa is a big place and it wa possibl
that in it recess prehistor anim or reptil linger on
i know that thi is the case with snake he continu hurriedli as
though to avoid the larger topic for onc i came across on as larg
as the biggest anaconda that is told of in south america where
occasion thei ar said to reach a length of sixti feet or more
inde we kill itor rather my hottentot servant han didaft
it had crush and swallow on of our parti thi snake wa
worship as a king of god and might have given rise to the tale of
enorm reptil also to omit other experi of which i prefer
not to speak i have seen an eleph so much abov the ordinari in
size that it might have belong to a prehistor ag thi eleph
ha been known for centuri and wa name jana
did you kill it inquir good peer at him through hi
eyeglass in hi quick inquisit wai
allan colour beneath hi tan and wrinkl and said rather sharpli
for him who wa so gentl and hard to irrit
have you not learn good that you should never ask a hunter and
abov all a profession hunter whether he did or did not kill a
particular head of game unless he volunt the inform howev
if you want to know i did not kill that eleph it wa han who
kill it and therebi save my life i miss it with both barrel at
a distanc of a few yard
oh i sai quatermain ejacul the irrepress good do you
mean to tell us that you miss a particularli big eleph that wa
onli a few yard off you must have been in a pretti fright to do
that
have i not said that i miss it good for the rest perhap you ar
right and i wa frighten for as you know i never set myself up as
a person remark for courag in the circumst of the encount
with thi beast jana ani on might have been frighten inde
even you yourself good or if you choos to be charit you mai
conclud that there were other reason for that disgracefuly
disgrac exhibit of which i cannot bear to think and much less
to talk see that in the end it brought about the death of old han
whom i love
now good wa about to answer again for argument wa as the breath of
hi nostril but i saw sir henri stretch out hi long leg and kick
him on the shin after which he wa silent
to return said allan hastili as on doe who desir to escap
from an unpleas subject in the cours of my life i did onc meet
not with a prehistor reptil but with a peopl who worship a
monstergod or fetish of which perhap the origin mai have been a
surviv from the ancient world
he stop with the air of on who meant to sai no more and i ask
eagerli what wa it allan
to answer that would involv a long stori my friend he repli
and on that if i told it good i am sure would not believ also
it is get late and might bore you inde i could not finish it
tonight
there ar whiski soda and tobacco and whatev curti and good mai
do here fortifi by these i remain between you and the door until
you tell me that tale allan you know it is rude to go to bed befor
your guest so pleas get on with it at onc i ad laugh
the old boi hum and haw and look cross but as we all sat round
him in an irrit silenc which seem to get upon hi nerv he
began at last
well if you will have it mani year ago when by comparison i wa a
young man i camp on dai well up among the slope of the
drakensberg i wa go up pretoria wai with a load of trade good
which i hope to dispos of among the nativ beyond and when i had
done so to put in a month or two gameshoot toward the north as
it happen when we were in an open space of ground between two of
the foothil of the berg we got caught in a most aw thunderstorm
on of the worst that ever i experienc if i rememb right it wa
about midjanuari and you my friend thi wa address to me know
what natal thunderstorm can be at that hot time of the year it
seem to come upon us from two quarter of the sky the fact be
that it wa a twin storm of which the compon part were travel
toward each other
the air grew thick and dens then came the usual moan ici wind
follow by someth like dark although it wa earli in the
afternoon on the peak of the mountain around us lightn were
alreadi plai but as yet i heard no thunder and there wa no rain
in addit to the driver and voorloop of the wagon i had with me
han of whom i wa speak just now a littl wrinkl hottentot
who from my boyhood had been the companion of my journei and
adventur it wa he who came with me as my afterrid when as a
veri young man i accompani piet retief on that fatal embassi to
dingaan the zulu king of whom practic all except han and myself
were massacr
he wa a curiou witti littl fellow of uncertain ag and of hi sort
on of the cleverest men in africa i never knew hi equal in resourc
or in follow a spoor but like all hottentot he had hi fault
thu whenev he got the chanc he would drink like a fish and
becom a useless nuisanc he had hi virtu also sinc he wa
faith as a dog andwel he love me as a dog love the master
that ha rear it from a blind puppi for me he would do anyth
lie or steal or commit murder and think it no wrong but rather a
holi duti ye and ani dai he wa prepar to die for me as in the
end he did
allan paus ostens to knock out hi pipe which wa unnecessari
as he had onli just fill it but realli i think to give himself a
chanc of turn toward the fire in front of which he wa stand
and thu to hide hi face present he swung round upon hi heel in
the light quick fashion that wa on of hi characterist and went
on
i wa walk in front of the wagon keep a lookout for bad place
and stone in what in those dai wa by courtesi call the road
though in fact it wa noth but a track twist between the
mountain and just behind in hi usual placefor he alwai stuck to
me like a shadowwa han present i heard him cough in a hollow
fashion as wa hi custom when he want to call my attent to
anyth and ask over my shoulder
what is it han
noth baa he answer onli that there is a big storm come
up two storm baa not on and when thei meet thei will begin to
fight and there will be plenti of spear fly about in the sky and
then both those cloud will weep rain or perhap hail
ye i said there is but as i dont see anywher to shelter
there is noth to be done
han came up level with me and cough again twirl hi dirti
apolog for a hat in hi skinni finger therebi intim that he
had a suggest to make
mani year ago baa he said point with hi chin toward a mass
of tumbl stone at the foot of a mountain slope about a mile to our
left there us to be a big cave yonder for onc when i wa a boi i
shelter in it with some bushmen it wa after the zulu had clean
out natal and there wa noth to eat in the land so that the peopl
who were left fed upon on anoth
then how did the bushmen live han
on slug and grasshopp for the most part baa and buck when
thei were lucki enough to kill ani with their poison arrow fri
caterpillar ar not bad baa nor ar locust when you can get
noth els i rememb that i who wa starv grew fat on them
you mean that we had better make for thi cave of your han if you
ar sure it there
ye baa cave cant run awai and though it is mani year ago i
dont forget a place where i have live for two month
i look at those advanc cloud and reflect thei were uncommonli
black and evid there wa go to be the devil of a storm
moreov the situat wa not pleasant for we were cross a patch
of ironston on which as i knew from experi lightn alwai
strike and a wagon and a team of oxen have an attract for
electr flash
while i wa reflect a parti of kaffir came up from behind run
for all thei were worth no doubt to seek shelter thei were dress
in their fineryevid peopl go to or return from a
weddingfeast young men and girl most of themand as thei went by
on of them shout to me whom evid he knew as did most of the
nativ in those part hurri hurri macumazahn as you know the
zulu call me hurri thi place is belov of lightn and he
point with hi danc stick first to the advanc tempest and then
to the ground where the ironston crop up
that decid me and run back to the wagon i told the voorloop
to follow han and the driver to flog up the oxen then i scrambl
in behind and off we went turn to the left and head for the
place at the foot of the slope where han said the cave wa luckili
the ground wa fairli flat and openhard too moreov although he
had not been there for so mani year hanss memori of the spot wa
perfect inde as he said it wa on of hi characterist never
to forget ani place that he had onc visit
thu from the drive box to which i had climb suddenli i saw him
direct the voorloop to bear sharpli to the right and could not
imagin why as the surfac there seem similar to that over which we
were travel as we pass it howev i perceiv the reason for
here wa a ground spring which turn a larg patch of an acr or more
into a swamp where certainli we should have been bog it wa the
same with other obstacl that i need not detail
by now a great still pervad the air and the gloom grew so thick
that the front oxen look shadowi also it becam veri cold the
lightn continu to plai upon the mountain crest but still there
wa no thunder there wa someth frighten and unnatur in the
aspect of natur even the cattl felt it for thei strain at the
yoke and went off veri fast inde without the urg of whip or
shout as though thei too knew thei were fly from peril doubtless
thei did sinc instinct ha it voic which speak to everyth that
breath for my part my nerv becam affect and i hope earnestli
that we should soon reach that cave
present i hope it still more for at length those cloud met and
from their edg as thei kiss each other came an aw burst of fire
perhap it wa a thunderboltthat rush down and struck the earth
with a loud deton at ani rate it caus the ground to shake and
me to wish that i were anywher els for it fell within fifti yard
of the wagon exactli where we had been a minut or so befor
simultan there wa a most aw crash of thunder show that
the tempest now lai immedi overhead
thi wa the open of the ball the first sudden burst of music
then the danc began with sheet and fork of flame for dancer and
the great sky for the floor upon which thei perform
it is difficult to describ such a hellish tempest becaus as you my
friend who have seen them will know thei ar beyond descript
lightn everywher lightn flash upon flash of them of all
shapeson i rememb look like a crown of fire encircl the
brow of a giant cloud moreov thei seem to leap upward from the
earth as well as downward from the heaven to the accompani of
on continu roar of thunder
where the deuc is your cave i yell into the ear of han who had
climb on to the drive box besid me
he shriek someth in answer which i could not catch becaus of the
tumult and point to the base of the mountain slope now about two
hundr yard awai
the oxen skreck and began to gallop caus the wagon to bump and
swai so that i thought it would overset and the voorloop to leav
hold of the reim and run alongsid of them for fear lest he should
be trodden to death guid them as best he could which wa not
well luckili howev thei ran in the right direct
on we tore the driver ply hi whip to keep the beast straight
and as i could see from the motion of hi lip swear hi hardest
in dutch and zulu though not a word reach my ear at length thei
were brought to a halt by the steep slope of the mountain and
proceed to turn round and tie themselv into a kind of knot after
the fashion of frighten oxen that for ani reason can no longer pull
their load
we leapt down and began to outspan them get the yoke off as
quickli as we couldno easi job i can tell you both becaus of the
mess in which thei were and for the reason that it must be carri out
liter under fire sinc the flash were fall all about us
momentarili i expect that on of them would catch the wagon and make
an end of us and our stori inde i wa so frighten that i wa
sore tempt to leav the oxen to their fate and bolt to the cave
if cave there werefor i could see none
howev pride came to my aid for if i ran awai how could i ever
expect my kaffir to stand again in a difficulti be as much afraid as
you like but never show fear befor a nativ if you do your
influenc over him is gone you ar no longer the great white chief of
higher blood and breed you ar just a common fellow like himself
inferior to himself inde if he chanc to be a brave specimen of a
peopl among whom most of the men ar brave
so i pretend to take no heed of the lightn even when on struck
a thorn tree not more than thirti pace awai i happen to be look
in that direct and saw the thorn in the flare everi bough of it
next second all i saw wa a column of dust the thorn had gone and on
of it splinter hit my hat
with the other i tug and kick at the oxen get the thong
off the yokeskei as best i could till at length all were loos
and gallop awai to seek shelter under overhang rock or where
thei could in accord with their instinct the last two the pole
oxenvalu beastswer particularli difficult to free as thei
were try to follow their brethren and strain at the yoke so much
that in the end i had to cut the rimpi as i could not get them out
of the notch of the yokeskei then thei tore off after the
other but did not get far poor brute for present i saw both of
themthei were run togethergo down as though thei were shot
through the heart a flash had caught them on of them never stir
again the other lai on it back kick for a few second and then
grew as still as it yokem
and what did you sai inquir good in a reflect voic
what would you have said good ask allan sever if you had
lost your best two oxen in such a fashion and happen not to have a
sixpenc with which to bui other well we all know your command of
strong languag so i do not think i need ask you to answer
i should have said began good brace himself to the occas
but allan cut him short with a wave of hi hand
someth about jupit tonan no doubt he said
then he went on
well what i said wa onli overheard by the record angel though
perhap han guess it for he scream at me
it might have been us baa when the sky is angri it will have
someth better the oxen than us baa
the cave you idiot i roar shut your mouth and take us to the
cave if there is on for here come the hail
han grin and nod then hasten by a larg hailston which hit
him on the head began to skip up the hill at a surpris rate
beckon to the rest of us to follow present we came to a tumbl
pile of rock through which we dodg and scrambl in the gloom that
now when the hail had begun to fall wa denser than ever between the
flash at the back of the biggest of these rock han dive among
some bush drag me after him between two stone that form a
kind of natur gatewai to a caviti beyond
thi is the place baa he said wipe the blood that ran down hi
forehead from a cut in the head made by the hailston
as he spoke a particularli vivid flash show me that we were in the
mouth of a cavern of unknown size that it must be larg howev i
guess from the echo of the thunder that follow the flash which
seem to reverber in that hollow place from unmeasur depth in
the bowel of the mountain
chapter ii
the pictur in the cave
we did not reach the cave too soon for as the boi scrambl into it
after us the hail began to come down in earnest and you fellow know
or at ani rate have heard what african hail can be especi among
the mountain of the berg i have known it to go through sheet of
galvan iron like rifl bullet and realli i believ that some of
the stone which fell on thi occas would have pierc two of them
put togeth for thei were as big as flint and jag at that if
anybodi had been caught in that particular storm on the open veldt
without a wagon to creep under or a saddl to put over hi head i
doubt whether he would have live to see a clear sky again
the driver who wa alreadi almost weep with distress over the loss
of kaptein and deutchmann as the two pole oxen were name grew
almost craze becaus he thought that the hail would kill the other
and actual want to run out into it with the wild idea of herd
them into some shelter i told him to sit still and not be a fool
sinc we could do noth to help them han who had a habit of
grow religi when there wa lightn about remark
sententi that he had no doubt that the greatgreat in the sky
would look after the cattl sinc my reverend father who had
convert him to the peculiar faith or mixtur of faith which with
han pass for christian had told him that the cattl on a
thousand hill were hi especi properti and here in the berg were
thei not among the thousand hill the zulu driver who had not found
religion but wa just a raw savag repli with point that if that
were so the greatgreat might have protect kaptein and deutchmann
which he had clearli neglect to do then after the fashion of some
furiou woman by wai of reliev hi nerv he fell to abus
han whom he call a yellow jackal ad that the tail of the
worst of the oxen wa of more valu than hi whole bodi and that he
wish hi worthless skin were catch the hailston instead of
their inestim hide
these nasti remark about hi person appear irrit han who
drew up hi lip as doe an angri dog and repli in suitabl
languag which involv reflect upon that zulu famili and
especi on hi mother in short had i not interven there would
have been a veri pretti row that might have end in a blow from a
kerri or a knife thrust thi howev i did with vigour sai that
he who spoke anoth word should be kick out of the cave to keep
compani with the hail and the lightn after which peac wa
restor
that storm went on for a long while for after it had seem to go
awai it return again travel in a circl as such tempest
sometim do and when the hail wa finish it wa follow by
torrenti rain the result wa that by the time the thunder had
ceas to roar and echo among the mountaintop dark wa at hand
so it becam evid that we must stop where we were for the night
especi as the boi who had gone out to look for the oxen
report that thei could not find them thi wa not pleasant as the
cave wa uncommonli cold and the wagon wa too soak with the rain to
sleep in
here howev onc more hanss memori came in us have borrow
my match he crept off down the cave and present return
drag a quantiti of wood after him dusti and wormeatenlook
wood but dry and veri suitabl for fire
where did you get that i ask
baa he repli when i live in thi place with the bushmen long
befor those black children thi insult refer to the driver and
the voorloop mavoon and induka by name were begotten of their
unknown father i hid awai a great stock of wood for the winter or
in case i should ever come back here and there it is still cover
with stone and dust the ant that run about the ground do the same
thing baa that their children mai have food when thei ar dead so
now if those kaffir will help me to get the wood we mai have a good
fire and be warm
marvel at the littl hottentot foresight that wa bred into hi
blood by the necess of a hundr gener of hi forefath
i bade the other to accompani him to the cach which thei did
glower with the result that present we had a gloriou fire then
i fetch some food for luckili i had kill a duiker buck that
morn the flesh of which we toast on the ember and with it a
bottl of squarefac from the wagon so that soon we were eat a
splendid dinner i know that there ar mani who do not approv of
give spirit to nativ but for my part i have found that when thei
ar chill and tire a tot doe them no harm and wonderfulli
improv their temper the troubl wa to prevent han from get
more than on to do which i made a bedfellow of that bottl of
squarefac
when we were fill i lit my pipe and began to talk with han whom
the grog had made loquaci and therefor interest he ask me
how old the cave wa and i told him that it wa as old as the
mountain of the berg he answer that he had thought so becaus
there were footprint stamp in the rock floor farther down it and
turn to stone which were not made by ani beast that he had ever
heard of or seen which footprint he would show me on the morrow if i
care to look at them further that there were queer bone ly
about also turn to stone that he thought must have belong to
giant he believ that he could find some of these bone when the
sun shone into the cave in the earli morn
then i explain to han and the kaffir how onc thousand of
thousand of year ago befor there were ani men in the world great
creatur had live there huge eleph and reptil as larg as a
hundr crocodil made into on and as i had been told enorm
ap much bigger than ani gorilla thei were veri interest and
han said that it wa quit true about the ap sinc he had seen a
pictur of on of them or of a giant that look like an ap
where i ask in a book
no baa here in thi cave the bushman made it ten thousand year
ago by which he meant at some indefinit time in the past
now i bethought me of a fabul creatur call the ngoloko which
wa said to inhabit an undefin area of swamp on the east coast and
elsewher thi anim in which i mai add i did not in the least
believ for i set it down as a nativ bogei wa suppos to be at
least eight feet high to be cover with grai hair and to have a claw
in the place of toe my chief author for it wa a strang old
portugues hunter whom i had onc known who swore that he had seen
it footprint in the mud also that it had kill on of hi men and
twist the head off hi bodi i ask han if he had ever heard of
it he repli that he had under anoth name that of milhoi i
think but that the devil paint in the cave wa larger than that
now i thought that he wa pitch me a yarn as nativ will and
said that if so he had better show me the pictur forthwith
best wait until the sun shine in the morn baa he repli
for then the light will be good also thi devil is not nice to look
at at night
show it me i repeat with asper we have lantern from the
wagon
so somewhat unwillingli han led the wai up the cave for fifti pace
or more for the place wa veri big he carri on lantern and i
anoth while the two zulu follow with candl in their hand as
we went i saw that on the wall there were mani bushmen paint
also on or two of the carv of thi strang peopl some of these
paint seem quit fresh while other were fade or perhap the
ochr us by the primit artist had flake off thei were of the
usual charact draw of eland and other buck be hunt by men
who shot at them with arrow also of eleph and a lion charg at
some spearmen
on howev which oddli enough wa the best preserv of ani of the
collect excit me enorm it repres men whose face were
paint white and who seem to wear a kind of armour and queer
point cap upon their head of the sort that i believ ar known as
phrygian attack a nativ kraal of which the reed fenc wa clearli
indic as were the round hut behind moreov to the left some
of these men were drag awai women to what from a seri of wavi
line look like a rude represent of the sea
i stare and gasp for sure here befor me wa a pictur of
phoenician carri out on of their womenhunt raid as ancient
writer tell us it wa their habit to do and if so that pictur must
have been paint by a bushman who live at least two thousand year
ago and possibl more the thing wa amaz han howev did not
seem to be interest but push on as though to finish a
disagre task and i wa oblig to follow him fear lest i
should be lost in the recess of that vast cave
present he came to a crevic in the side of the cavern which i
should have pass unnot as it wa exactli like mani other
here is the place baa he said just as it us to be now follow
me and be care where you step for there ar crack in the floor
so i squeez myself into the open where although i am not veri
larg there wa bare room for me to pass within it lip wa a
narrow tunnel either cut out by water or form by the rush of
explos gase hundr of thousand of year agoi think the
latter as the roof which wa not more than eight or nine feet from
the floor had sharp point and rough that show no waterwear
but as i have not the faintest idea how these great african cave were
form i will not attempt to discuss the matter thi floor howev
wa quit smooth as though for mani gener it had been worn by
the feet of men which no doubt wa the case
when we had crept ten or twelv pace down the tunnel han call to
me to stand quit stillnot to move on ani account i obei him
wonder and by the light of my lantern saw him lift hi own which
had a loop of hide fasten through the tin ey at the top of it for
conveni in hang it up in the wagon and set it or rather the
hide loop round hi neck so that it hung upon hi back then he
flatten himself against the side of the cavern with hi face to the
wall as though he did not wish to see what wa behind him and
cautious crept forward with sidelong step grip the rough
in the rock with hi hand when he had gone some twenti or thirti
feet in thi crablik fashion he turn and said
now baa you must do as i did
why i ask
hold down the lantern and you will see baa
i did so and perceiv that a pace or two farther on there wa a
great chasm in the floor of the tunnel of unknown depth sinc the
lamplight did not penetr to it bottom also i note that the ledg
at the side that form the bridg by which han had pass wa
nowher more than twelv inch and in some place less than six
inch wide
is it deep i ask
by wai of answer han found a bit of broken rock and threw it into the
gulf i listen and it wa quit a long while befor i heard it
strike below
i told the baa said han in a superior tone that he had better
wait until tomorrow when some light come down thi hole but the
baa would not listen to me and doubtless he know best now would the
baa like to go back to bed as i think wisest and return tomorrow
if the truth were known there wa noth that i should have like
better for the place wa detest but i wa in such a rage with
han for plai me thi trick that even if i thought that i wa go
to break my neck i would not give him the pleasur of mock me in
hi sly wai
no i answer quietli i will go to bed when i have seen thi
pictur you talk about and not befor
now han grew alarm and beg me in good earnest not to try to
cross the gulf which remind me vagu of the parabl of abraham
and dive in the bibl with myself plai the part of dive except
that i wa not thirsti and han did not in ani wai resembl abraham
i see how it is i said there is not ani pictur and you ar
simpli plai on of your monkei trick on me well im come to
look and if i find you have been tell li ill make you sorri for
yourself
the pictur is there or wa when i wa young answer han
sullenli and for the rest the baa know best if he break everi
bone in hi bodi present dont let him blame me and i prai that he
will tell the truth all of it to hi reverend father in the sky who
left him in my charg sai that han beg him not to come but
that becaus of hi evil temper he would not listen meanwhil the
baa had better take off hi boot sinc the feet of those bushmen
whose spook i feel all about me have made the ledg veri slipperi
in silenc i sat down and remov my boot think to myself that i
would gladli give all my save that were on deposit in the bank at
durban to be spare thi ordeal what a strang thing is the white
man pride especi if he be of the anglosaxon breed or what
pass by that name there wa no need for me to take thi risk yet
rather than be secretli mock at by han and those kaffir here i
wa about to do so just for pride sake in my heart i curs han
and the cave and the hole and the pictur and the thunderstorm that
brought me there and everyth els i could rememb then as it
had no strap like that of han although it smelt horribl i took the
tin loop of my lantern in my teeth becaus it seem the onli thing to
do put up a silent but most earnest prayer and start as though i
like the job
to tell the truth i rememb littl of that journei except that it
seem to take about three hour instead of under a minut and the
voic of woe and lament from the two zulu behind who insist
upon bid me a tender farewel as i proceed amidst other
demonstr of affect call me their father and their mother
for four gener
somehow i wriggl myself along that accurs ridg shove my
stomach as hard as i could against the wall of the passag as though
thi organ possess some prehensil qualiti and grope for knob of
rock on which i broke two of my nail howev i did get over all
right although just toward the end on of my feet slip and i
open my mouth to sai someth with the result that the lantern
fell into the abyss take with it a loos front tooth but han
stretch out hi skinni hand and mean to catch me by the coat
collar got hold of my left ear and thu painfulli support i came
to firm ground and curs him into heap although some might have
thought my languag point he did not resent it in the least be
too delight at my safe arriv
never mind the tooth baa he said it is best that it should be
gone without know it as it were becaus you see you can now eat
crust and hard biltong again which you have not been abl to do for
month the lantern howev is anoth matter though perhap we can
get a new on at pretoria or wherev we go
recov myself i peer over the edg of the abyss there far
far below i saw my lantern which wa a sort that burn oil flare
upon a bed of someth white for the contain had burst and all the
oil wa on fire
what is that white stuff down there i ask lime
no baa it is the broken bone of men onc when i wa young with
the help of the bushmen i let myself down by a rope that we twist
out of rush and buckskin just to look baa there is anoth cave
underneath thi on baa but i didnt go into it becaus i wa
frighten
and how did all those bone come there han why there must be
hundr of them
ye baa mani hundr and thei came thi wai sinc the begin
of the world the bushmen live in thi cave and set a trap here by
lai branch over the hole and cover them with dust so that thei
look like rock just as on make a game pit baasy thei did
thi until the last of them were kill not so long ago by the boer
and zulu whose sheep and beast thei stole then when their enemi
attack them which wa often for it ha alwai been right to kill
bushmenthei would run down the cave and into the cleft and creep
along the narrow edg of rock which thei could do with their ey
shut but the silli kaffir or whoever it might be run after
them to kill them would fall through the branch and get kill
themselv thei must have done thi quit often baa sinc there
ar such a lot of their skull down there mani of them quit black
with ag and turn to stone
on might have thought that the kaffir would have grown wiser
han
ye baa but the dead keep their wisdom to themselv for i
believ that when all the attack were in the passag then other
bushmen who had been hide in the cave came up behind and shot them
with poison arrow and drove them on into the hole so that none went
back inde the bushmen told me that thi us to be their father
plan also if ani did escap in a gener or two all wa
forgotten and the same thing happen again becaus baa there ar
alwai plenti of fool in the world and the fool who come after is
just as big as the fool who went befor death spill the water of
wisdom upon the sand baa and sand is thirsti stuff that soon grow
dry again if it were not so baa men would soon stop fall in
love with women and yet even great oneslik you baasfal in
love
have deliv thi thrust in order to prevent the possibl of
answer han began to chat with the driver and the voorloop on the
other side of the gulf
be quick and come over you brave zulu there he said for you ar
keep your chief wait and me also
the zulu hold their candl forward peer into the pit below
ow said on of them ar we bat that we can fly over a hole
like that or baboon that we can climb on a shelf no wider than a
spear or fli that we can walk upon a wall ow we ar not come
we will wait here that road is onli for yellow monkei like you or
for those who have the white man magic like the inkoo macumazahn
no repli han reflect you ar none of these creatur
which ar all of them good in their wai you ar just a coupl of low
born kaffir coward black skin blown up to look like men i the
yellow jackal can walk the gulf and the baa can walk the gulf
but you windbag cannot even float over it for fear lest you should
burst in the middl well windbag float back to the wagon and fetch
the coil of small rope that is in the voorkissi for we mai want
it
on of them repli in a humbl voic that thei did not take order
from him a hottentot whereon i said
go and fetch the rope and return at onc
so thei went with a deject air for hanss wing word had gone
home and again thei learn that at the end he alwai got the best of
a quarrel the truth is that thei were as brave as men can be but no
zulu is ani good underground and least of all in the dark in a place
that he think haunt
now baa said han we will go and look at the picturethat is
unless you ar quit sure i am ly and that there is no pictur in
which case it is not worth while to take the troubl and you had
better sit here and cut your broken nail until mavoon and induka come
back with the rope
oh get on you poison littl vermin i said exasper by hi
jeer emphas my word with a tremend kick
here howev i made a great mistak sinc i had forgotten that at
the moment i lack boot and either han carri a collect of
hard articl in the seat of hi filthi trouser or hi posterior wa
of a singularli stonelik natur in short i hurt my toe most
abomin and him not at all
ah baa said han with a sweet smile you should rememb what
your reverend father taught me alwai to put on your boot befor you
kick against the thorn prick i have a gimlet and some nail in my
pistol pocket baa that i wa us thi morn to mend that box of
your
then he bolt incontin lest i should experi on hi head and
see if there were nail in that also and as he had the onli lantern
i wa oblig to limp or rather to hop after him
the passag of which the floor wa still worn smooth by thousand of
dead feet went on straight for eight or ten pace and then bent to
the right when we came to thi elbow in it i saw a light ahead of me
which i could not understand till present i found myself stand in
a kind of pit or funnelit mai have measur some thirti feet
acrossthat rose from the level at which we stood right through the
strata to the mountainsid eighti or a hundr feet abov us what
had form it thu i cannot conceiv but there it wasa funnel as i
have said in shape exactli like those that ar us when beer is
pour into barrel or port wine into a decant the place on which
we were be of cours it narrow end the light that i had seen
came therefor from the sky which now that the tempest had pass
awai wa cleanwash and beauti sown with star also for at the
moment a dens black cloud remain from the storm hid the moon now
just past it full
for a littl wai perhap fiveandtwenti feet the side of thi
tunnel were almost sheer after which thei slope outward steepli to
the mouth of the pit in the mountain flank on other peculiar i
noticednam that on the western face of the tunnel which as it
chanc wa in front of us as we stood just where it began to
expand project a slope ridg of rock like to the roof of a lean
to shed which ridg ran right across thi face
well han i said when i had inspect thi strang natur
caviti where is your pictur i dont see it
wacht een beetj that is wait a bit baa the moon is
climb up that cloud present she will get to the top of it and
then you will see the pictur unless someon ha rub it out sinc
i wa young
i turn to look at the cloud and to wit a sight of which i never
have grown tire the upris of the gloriou african moon out of her
secret hall of black alreadi silver rai of light were shoot
across the vast of the firmament caus the star to pale then
suddenli her bent edg appear and with extraordinari swift grew
and grew till the whole splendid orb emerg from a bed of inki vapour
and for a while rest on it marg perfect wonder in an instant
our hole wa fill with light so strong and clear that by it i could
have read a letter
for a few moment i stood thrill with the beauti of the scene and
forget all els in it contempl till han said with a hoars
cackl
now turn round baa and look at the pretti pictur
i did so and follow the line of hi outstretch hand which
point to that face of the rock with the pent roof that look
toward the east next secondmi friend i am not exaggeratingi
nearli fell backward have ani of you fellow ever had a nightmar in
which you dream you were in hell and suddenli met the devil tetea
tete all by your littl selv at ani rate i have and there in
front of me wa the devil onli much wors than fond fanci can paint
him even with the brush of the acutest indigest
imagin a monster doubl life sizethat is to sai eleven or twelv
feet highbrilliantli portrai in the best ochr of which these
bushmen have alwai had the secret name white red black and
yellow and with ey form appar of polish lump of rock
crystal imagin thi thing as a huge ap to which the biggest gorilla
would be but a child and yet not an ap but a man and yet not a man
but a fiend
it wa cover with hair like an ap long grai hair that grew in
tuft it had a great red bushi beard like a man it limb were
tremend the arm be of abnorm length like to the arm of a
gorilla but mark thi it had no finger onli a great claw where
the thumb should be the rest of the hand wa all grown togeth into
on piec like a duck foot although what should have been the
finger part wa flexibl and could grip like finger as shall be
seen
at least that is what the pictur suggest though it occur to me
afterward that it might repres the creatur as wear fingerless
glove such as men in thi countri us when cut fenc the feet
howev which were certainli shown as bare were the same i mean
that there were no toe onli on terribl claw where the big toe
should be the carcass wa enorm suppos it to have been drawn
from life the origin i should guess would have weigh at least
thirti stone the chest wa vast indic strength and the paunch
beneath wrinkl and protuber butand here came on of the human
touchesabout it middl the thing wore a moocha or rather a hide
ti round it by the leg skin which hide seem to have been
dress
so much for the bodi now for the head and face these i know not how
to describ but i will try the neck wa as that of a bull and
perch horribl on the top of it wa quit a small head which
notwithstand the great red beard whereof i have spoken that grew
upon the chin and a wide mouth from whose upper jaw project yellow
tusk like to those of a baboon that hung over the lower lipwa
curious feminin in appear inde that of an old old she
devil with an aquilin nose the brow howev wa disproportion
to the rest of the face be promin massiv and not
unintellectu while set deep in it and unnatur far apart were
those aw glare crystal ey
that wa not all for the creatur seem to be laugh cruelli and
the draw show by it laugh on of it feet wa set upon the
bodi of a man into which the great claw wa driven deep on of it
hand held the head of the man that evid it had just twist
from the bodi the other hand grasp by the hair a live nake girl
badli drawn as though thi detail had not interest the artist whom
appar it wa about to drag awai
isnt it a pretti pictur baa snigger han now the baa will
not sai that i tell li no not for quit a week
chapter iii
the openerofroad
i stare and stare then wa overcom with faint and sat down
upon the ground
i see you laugh at me young man thi wa address to me the
record of the tale who no doubt have alreadi decid that thi
draw wa the work of some imagin bushman who had gone mad and
set down upon the rock the hellish dream of a mind diseas of
cours that wa the conclus i came to myself next morn but at
the time it did not strike me like that
the place wa lonesom and eeri a horribl place with the pit full
of bone near by heavili silent also except for a distant hyena or
jackal howl at the moon and i had gone through some trial that
dayth passag of the deathpit for instanc which remind me of
the oubliett in ancient norman castl that i have read of down
which prison were hurl to doom also as you mai have observ
even in your short career moonlight differ from sunlight and we or
some of us ar much more affect by horribl thing at night than we
ar by dai at ani rate i sat down becaus i felt faint and thought
that i wa go to be ill
what is it baa queri the observ han still mock if you
want to be sick baa pleas dont mind me for ill turn my back i
rememb that i wa sick myself when first i saw heuheujust there
he ad reminisc point to a certain spot
why do you call that thing heuheu han i ask try to
master the reflex action of my interior arrang
becaus that is hi nice name baa given him by hi mammi when he
wa littl perhap
here i nearli wa sick the idea of that creatur with a mother
almost finish melik the sight and smell of a bit of fat bacon in
a gale at sea
how do you know that i gurgl
becaus the bushmen told me baa thei said that their father a
thousand year ago knew thi heuheu far awai and that thei left
that part of the countri becaus of him as thei never slept well at
night there just like a boer when anoth boer come and build a
hous within six mile of him baa i think thei meant that thei
heard heuheu when he talk for thei told me that their greatgreat
grandfath could hear him do it and beat hi breast when he
wa mile awai but i daresai thei li for i dont believ thei
realli knew anyth about heuheu or who paint hi portrait on the
rock baa
no i answer nor do i well han i think i have had enough of
your friend heuheu for thi even and should like to go back to
bed
ye baa so should i baa still take anoth good look at him
befor you leav you dont see a pictur like that everi night baa
and you know you want to come
now i would have kick han again but luckili i rememb those
nail in hi pocket in time so after on linger glanc i onli
rose and loftili motion to him to lead on
thi wa the last that i saw of the like of heuheu or beelzebub
or whoever the monster mai have been somehow although i intend to
return to examin it more close by the light of dai when morn
came i thought that i would not risk anoth scrambl over that ledg
but would be satisfi with the memori of first impress these
thei sai ar alwai the bestlik first kiss as han ad when i
explain thi to him
not that i could forget heuheu on the contrari it is not too much
to sai that thi devilish creatur haunt me i could not dismiss
that pictur as some mere flight of distort savag imagin from
a hundr characterist i knew or thought i knew it erron as
i now believ to be bushmen work and wa certain that no bushman
even if he had delirium tremensnot a complaint from which these
peopl ever suffer becaus thei lack the opportun of do so
could have evolv thi monstrou creation out of hi own soulif a
bushman ha a soul no bushman or not that artist wa draw
someth that he had seen or thought that he had seen
of thi there were sever indic thu on heuheu right arm
the elbow joint wa much swollen as though he had onc suffer an
injuri there again the claw of on of hi horribl handsth left
i thinkwa broken and divid at the point further there wa a
wart or protuber upon the brow just beneath where the long iron
grai tuft of hair part in the middl and hung down on each side of
the demoniac womanish face now the painter must have rememb
these blemish and set them down faithfulli copi from some
origin real or imagin certainli i reflect he would not have
invent them
where then did he get hi model i have mention that i had heard
rumour of creatur call ngoloko which i took it if thei
exist at all were peculiarli terrif ap of an unknown varieti
heuheu then might be a most distinguish and improv specimen of
these ap yet that could scarc be for thi beast wa more man
than monkei notwithstand hi huge claw where the thumb and big
toe should be or perhap i should sai that he wa more devil than
either
anoth idea occur to me he might have been the god of these
bushmen onli i never heard that thei had ani god except their own
stomach afterward i question han on thi point but he repli
that he did not know as the bushmen he live with in the cave had
never told him anyth to that effect it wa true howev that
thei did not go to the place where the pictur wa except through fear
of enemi and that when thei did thei would not look or speak about
it more than thei could help perhap he suggest with hi usual
shrewd heuheu might be the god of some other peopl with whom
the bushmen had noth to do
anoth questionwhen wa thi work execut ow to it shelter
posit the colour were still fairli bright but it must have been a
long while ago han said that the bushmen told him that thei did not
know who paint it or what it repres but that it wa old
old old which might mean anyth or noth sinc to a peopl
without write five or six gener becom remot antiqu on
thing wa certain howev that anoth of the paint in the cave
wa undoubtedli old that of the phoenician raid a kraal of which i
have spoken which can scarc have been execut sinc the time of
christ of thi i am sure for i examin it carefulli on the
follow morn and it wa not more fade than that of the monster
further in thi pictur a piec of the rock had scale off just abov
the left knee and i had notic that the surfac thu expos seem
as much weather as that of the surround rock outsid the limit
of the paint
on the other hand it must be rememb that the phoenician pictur
wa under cover while that of heuheu wa expos to the air and
would therefor ag more rapidli
well all that night i dream of thi horrid heuheu dream that he
wa aliv and challeng me to fight him dream that someon wa
call to me to rescu herit wa certainli hernot himfrom the
power of the beast dream that i did fight him and that he got me
down and wa about to twist my head off as he had done to the man in
the pictur when someth happenedi do not know whatand i woke
up cover with perspir and in a most pitiabl fright
now at the time i visit thi cave i wa not far from the border of
zululand on on of my trade expedit the wagon be laden with
blanket bead iron pot knive hoe and such other articl as
the simpl savag love or in those dai love to pai for in cattl
befor the storm overtook us howev i wa contempl leav the
zulu alon on thi trip and try to break new ground somewher
north of pretoria among less sophist nativ who might put a
higher valu on my ware after see heuheu as it chanc i
chang my mind for two reason the first of these wa that the
lightn had kill my two best oxen and i thought that i could
replac these without cash expenditur in zululand where debt were
ow to me that i might collect in kind the second wa connect
with that confound and obsess heuheu i felt convinc that onli
on man in the world could tell me about thi monster if inde
there were anyth to tell name old zikali the wizard of the
black kloof the thingthatshouldneverhavebeenborn as chaka
the great zulu king name him
i think that i have told you all about zikali befor but in case i
have not i will sai that he wa the greatest witch doctor who ever
live in zululand and the most terribl no on knew when he wa born
but undoubtedli he wa veri ancient and under hi nativ name of
openerofroad had been known and dread in the land for some
gener for mani year sinc my boyhood inde he and i had
been friend in a fashion though of cours i wa awar that from the
first he wa us me for hi own end as inde becam veri clear
befor all wa done and he had triumph over and brought about the
fall of the zulu royal hous which he hate
howev zikali like a wise merchant alwai paid those who serv
him with a gener hand in on coin or anoth as he paid those he
hate my coin wa inform either histor or concern the
hidden secret of the strang land of africa of which for all our
knowledg we white men realli understand so littl if ani on could
give inform about the pictur in the cave and it origin it
would be zikali and therefor to zikali i would go curios about
such matter as perhap you have guess wa alwai on of my
beset sin
we had great troubl in recov our remain fourteen oxen sinc
some of them had wander far to find cover from the storm at last
howev thei were found uninjur except for some bruis from the
hailston for it is wonder if thei ar left alon how cattl
manag to protect themselv against the forc of natur in africa
howev thei seldom take shelter beneath tree dure a thunderstorm
as is their habit here in england perhap becaus such tempest
be so frequent thei have inherit from their progenitor an
instinct knowledg that lightn strike tree and kill anyth
that happen to be underneath them at least that is my experi
well we inspan and trek awai from that remark cave mani
year afterward by the wai when han wa dead i tri to find it
again and could not i thought that i reach the same mountain slope
in which it wa but i suppos that i must have been mistaken sinc
in that neighbourhood there ar multitud of such slope and on the
on that i identifi i could discov no trace of the cave
perhap thi wa becaus there had been a landslid and with the
funnellik shaft in the mountain side down which the moonlight pour
on to the pictur of heuheu the orific that it will be rememb
wa veri small had been cover up with rock or it mai be that i
wa search the wrong slope not have taken my bear
suffici when i visit the place at a time of tempest and hurri
further i wa press and desir to reach a certain outspan befor
night fell could onli give about an hour to the quest and when it
fail wa oblig to get on nor have i ever met ani on who wa
acquaint with thi cave so i suppos that it must have been known
to the bushmen and han onli dead now all of them which is a piti
becaus of the wonder paint that it contain or contain
you will rememb i told you that just befor the storm broke we were
overtaken by a parti of kaffir go to or return from some feast
when we had gone about half a mile we found on of those kaffir again
quit dead but whether he the bodi wa that of a young man had been
kill by the lightn or by the hail i wa not sure evid hi
companion were so frighten that thei had left him where he lai
propos i suppos to return and buri him later so you will see
that when it gave us shelter thi cave did us a good turn
now i will skip all the detail of my trek into zululand which wa as
ar other trek onli slower becaus it wa a hard job to get that
heavili laden wagon along with but fourteen oxen onc inde we
stuck in a river the white umfolozi quit near to the nongela rock
or cliff which frown abov a pool of the river i shall never forget
that accid becaus it caus me to be the unwil wit of a
veri dread sight
whilst we were fast in the drift a parti of men appear upon the brow
of thi nongela rock about two hundr and fifti yard awai drag
with them two young women studi them through my glass i came to
the conclus from the wai thei move their head and stare wildli
about them that these young women were blind or had been blind as
i look at them wonder what to do the men seiz the women by
the arm and hurl them over the edg of the cliff with a piteou
wail the poor creatur roll down the stratifi rock into the deep
pool below and there the crocodil got them for distinctli i saw the
rush of the reptil inde in thi pool thei were alwai on the
lookout as it wa a favourit place of execut under the zulu
king
when their horribl busi wa finish the parti of slayer
there were about fifteen of themcam down to the ford to interview
us at first i thought there might be troubl and to tell the truth
should not have been sorri for the sight of thi butcheri had made me
furiou and reckless as soon as thei found out howev that the
wagon belong to me macumazahn thei were all amiabl and wade
into the water tackl on to the wheel with the result that by
their help we came safe to the farther bank
there i ask their leader who the two murder girl might be he
repli that thei were the daughter of panda the king i did not
question thi statement although know panda kindli charact i
doubt veri much whether thei were actual hi children then i
ask why thei were blind and what crime thei had commit the
captain repli that thei had been blind by the order of princ
cetywayo who even then wa the real ruler of zululand becaus thei
had look where thei should not
further inquiri elicit the fact that these unhappi girl had fallen
in love with two young men and run awai with them against the king
order or cetywayo which wa the same thing the parti were
overtaken befor thei could reach the natal border where thei would
have been safe the young men were kill at onc and the girl
brought up for judgment with the result that i have describ such
wa the end of their honeymoon
moreov the captain inform me cheerfulli that a bodi of soldier
had been sent out to kill the father and mother of the young men and
all who could be found in their kraal thi kind of free love must be
put a stop to he said as there had been too much of it go on
inde he did not know what had come to the young peopl in zululand
who had grown veri independ of late contamin no doubt by the
exampl of the zulu in natal where the white men allow them to do
what thei like without punish
then with a sigh over the degeneraci of the time thi crust old
conserv took a pinch of snuff bade me a hearti farewel and
depart sing a littl song which i think he must have invent
as it wa about the love of children for their parent if it had been
safe i should have like to let him have a charg of shot behind to
take awai as a souvenir but it wa not also after all he wa but
an execut offic a product of the iron system of zululand in the
dai of the king
well i trek on trade as i went and get paid in cow and
heifer which i sent back to natal but could come by no oxen that
were fit for the yoke and much less ani that had been broken in
sinc in those dai such were almost unknown in zululand howev i
did hear of some that had been left behind by a white trader becaus
thei were sick or footsor i forget which who took young cattl in
exchang for them these were said now to be fat again but no on
seem to know exactli where thei were on friendli chief told me
howev that the openerofroad that is old zikali might be
abl to do so as he knew everyth and the oxen had been trade awai
in hi district
now by thi time although i wa still obsess about heuheu i had
almost made up my mind to abandon the idea of visit zikali on thi
trip becaus i had notic that whenev i did so alwai i becam
involv in arduou and unpleas adventur as an immedi
consequ be howev badli in need of more oxen for not to
mention the two that were dead other of my team seem never to have
recov from the effect of the hailstorm and on or two show
sign of sick thi new caus me to revert to my origin plan
so after consult with han who also thought it the best thing to
be done i head for the black kloof which wa onli two short dai
trek awai
arriv at the mouth of that hate and forbid gulf on the
afternoon of the second dai i outspan by the spring and leav
the cattl in charg of mavoon and induka walk up it accompani by
han
the place of cours wa just as it had alwai been and yet as it
ever did struck me with a fresh sens of novelti and amaz in
all africa i scarc know a gorg that is so eeri and depress
those tower cliffsid that look as though thei ar about to fall
in upon the travel the stunt melancholi alo plant which grow
among the rock the pale veget the jackal and hyaena that
start awai at the sound of voic or echo footstep the dens dark
shadow the whisper wind that seem to wail about on even when
the air is still overhead draught i suppos that ar draw
backward and forward through the gullei all of these ar peculiar
to it the ancient us to declar that particular local had
their own genii or spirit but whether these were believ to be
evolv by the local or to come thither becaus it suit their
charact and natur i do not know
in the black kloof and some other spot to which i have wander i
have often thought of thi fabl and almost found myself accept it
as true but then what kind of a spirit would it be that chose to
inhabit thi dread gorg i think some embodimentno that word is
a contradictionsom impalp essenc of tragedi some doom soul
whereof the head wa bow and the wing were lead with a weight of
ineff and unrep crime
well what need wa there to fly to fabl and imagin such an
invis inhabit when zikali the thingthatshouldneverhav
beenborn wa and for uncount year had been the dweller in thi
tomblik gulf sure he wa tragedi personifi and that hoari head
of hi wa crown with ineff and unrep crime how mani had
thi hideou dwarf brought down to doom and how mani were yet destin
to perish in the snare that year by year he wove for them and yet
thi sinner had been sin against and did but pai back hi
suffer in kind he whose wive and children had been murder and
whose tribe had been stamp flat beneath the cruel feet of chaka
whose hous he hate and live on to destroi even for zikali
allow could be made he wa not altogeth bad is ani man
altogeth bad i wonder
muse thu i tramp on up the gorg follow by the deject han
whom the place alwai depress even more than it did myself
baa he said present in a hollow whisper for here he did not
dare to speak aloud baa do you think that the openerofroad wa
onc heuheu himself who ha now shrunk to a dwarf with ag or at ani
rate that heuheu spirit live in him
no i dont i answer for he ha finger and toe like the rest
of us but i do think that if there is ani heuheu he mai be abl to
tell us where to find him
then baa i hope that he ha forgotten or that heuheu ha gone to
heaven where the fire go on burn of themselv without the need
for wood for baa i do not want to meet heuheu the thought of him
turn my stomach cold
no you would rather go to durban and meet a gin bottl that would
turn your stomach warm han and your head too and land you in the
trunk for seven dai i repli improv the occas
then we turn the corner and came upon zikali kraal as usual i
appear to be expect for on of hi great silent bodi servant wa
wait who salut me with uplift spear i suppos that zikali
must have had a lookout man station somewher who watch the plain
beneath and told him who wa approach or possibl he had other
method of obtain inform at ani rate he alwai knew of my
advent and often enough why i came and whenc as inde he did on
thi occas
the father of spirit await you lord macumazahn said the bodi
servant he bid the littl yellow man who is name lightin
dark to accompani you and will see you at onc
i nod and the man led me to the gate of the fenc that surround
zikali great hut on which he tap with the handl of hi spear
it wa open by whom i did not see and we enter whereon someon
slip out of the shadow and close the gate behind us then
vanish there in front of the door of hi hut with a fire burn
befor him crouch the dwarf wrap in a fur kaross hi huge head
on either side of which the grai lock fell down much as thei did in
the pictur of heuheu bent forward and the light of the fire into
which he wa stare shine in hi cavern ey we advanc across
the shini beaten floor of the courtyard and stood in front of him but
for half a minut or more he took no notic of our presenc at
length without look up he spoke in that hollow resound voic
which wa unlik to ani other i ever heard sai
why do you alwai come so late macumazahn when the sun is off the
hut and it grow cold in the shadow you know i hate the cold as the
ag alwai do and i wa mind not to receiv you
becaus i could not get here befor zikali i answer
then you might have wait until tomorrow morn unless perhap
you thought that i should die in the night which i shall not do no
nor for mani night well here you ar littl white wander who
hop from place to place like a flea
ye here i am i repli nettl to visit you who do not wander
but sit in on spot like a toad in a stone zikali
ho ho ho he laughedthat wonder laugh of hi which echo
from the rock and alwai made me feel cold down the back ho ho
ho how easi it is to make you angri keep your temper macumazahn
lest it should run awai with you as your oxen did befor the storm in
the mountain the other dai what do you want you onli come here when
you want someth from him whom onc you name the old cheat so i
dont wander dont i but sit like a toad in a stone how do you know
that is it onli the bodi that wander cannot the spirit wander also
far oh far even to the heaven abov sometim and perhap to
that land which is under the earth the place where thei sai the dead
ar to be found again well what do you want stai and i will tell
you who explain yourself so badli who although you think that you
speak zulu like a nativ have never realli learn it properli
becaus to do that you must think in it and not in your own stupid
tongu that ha no word for mani thing man my medicin
a figur dart out of the hut set down a catskin bag befor him
and wa gone again zikali plung hi clawlik hand into the bag and
drew out a number of knuckl bone polish but yellow with ag
which he threw carelessli on to the ground in front of him then
glanc at them
ha he said someth about cattl i see ye you want to get
oxen broken oxen not wild on and think that i can tell you where
to do it cheap by the wai what present have you brought for me is
it a pound of your white man snuff as a matter of fact it wa a
quarter of a pound now am i right about the oxen
ye i repli rather amaz
that astonish you it is wonder isnt it that the poor old
cheat should know what you want well ill tell you how it is done
you lost two oxen by lightn did you not you therefor natur
would want other especi as some of those which remainher he
glanc at the bone onc morewer hurt ye by hailston veri
larg hailston and other ar show sign of sick redwat
i think therefor it isnt strang that the poor old cheat should
guess that you need oxen is it onli a silli zulu would put such a
thing down to magic about the snuff too which i see you have taken
from your pocketa veri littl parcel by the wai youv brought me
snuff befor havent you therefor it isnt strang that i should
guess that you would do so again is it no magic there
none zikali but how did you learn of the lightn kill the
cattl and of the hailstorm
how did i learn that the lightn kill your poleoxen kaptein and
deutchmann why ar you not a veri great man in whom all ar
interest and is it wonder that i should be told of accid
that happen a hundr mile or so awai you met a parti go to a
wed did you not just befor the storm and found on of them
dead afterward by the wai he wasnt kill either by lightn or
by hail the flash fell near and stun him but realli he di of
the cold dure the night i thought that you might like to know that
as you ar curiou on the point of cours those kaffir would have
told me about it would thei not no magic again you see that how
we poor witch doctor gain reput just by keep our ey and ear
open when you ar old you might set up in the trade yourself
macumazahn sinc you do the same thing even at night thei sai
now while he went on mock me he had gather up the bone out of
the dust and suddenli threw them again with a curiou spiral twist
that caus them to fall in a littl heap perch on on anoth he
look at them and said
why what do these silli thing remind me of thei ar some of the
tool of my trade you know macumazahn us to impress the fool
that come to see us witch doctor who think that thei will tell us
secret and to take off their attent while we read their heart
somehow or other thei remind me of rock pile on on anoth as on a
mountain slope and look there is a hollow in the middl like the
mouth of a cave
did you chanc to take refug from that storm in a cave macumazahn
oh you did well see how cleverli i guess it no magic there
again onli just a guess isnt it like that you would go to a cave
to escap from such a tempest leav the wagon outsid look at that
bone there ly a littl distanc off the other that what made
me think of the wagon be outsid but the question is what did you
see in the cave anyth out of the wai i wonder the bone cant
tell me that can thei i must guess that somehow els mustnt i
well ill try to do so just to give you the wise white man anoth
lesson in the manner that we poor rascal of witch doctor do our work
and take in fool but wont you tell me macumazahn
no i wont i answer crossli who knew that the old dwarf wa
make a butt of me
then i suppos that i must try to discov for myself but how how
come here you littl yellow monkei of a man and sit between me and
the fire so that it light shine through you for then perchanc i
mai be abl to see someth of what is go on in that thick head of
your lightindark as you ar call and get some light in my
dark
han advanc unwillingli enough and squat down at the spot that
zikali indic with hi boni finger be veri care that none of
the magic bone should touch ani portion of hi anatomi for fear lest
thei should bewitch him i suppos there he sat hold hi rag
felt hat upon the pit of hi stomach as though to ward off the gimlet
like glanc of zikali burn ey
hoho yellow man said the dwarf after a few second of inspect
which caus han to wriggl uncomfort and even to colour beneath
hi wrinkl skin like a young woman be studi by her prospect
husband who desir to ascertain whether she will or will not do for
a fifth wife hoho it seem to me that you knew thi cave befor
you went there in the storm but of cours i should guess that for
how otherwis would you have found it in such a hurri also that it
had someth to do with bushmen as most cave have in thi land
the question is what wa in it no dont tell me i want to find
out for myself it is strang that the thought come to me of
pictur no it isnt strang sinc the bushmen often us to paint
pictur in cave now you shouldnt nod your head yellow man
becaus it make the riddl too easi just stare at me and think of
noth at all pictur lot of them but on princip pictur i
think someth that wa difficult to come at ye danger even
wa it perchanc a pictur of yourself that a bushman drew long ago
when you were young and handsom yellow man
there again you ar shake your head keep it quit still will
you so that the thought in it dont rippl like water beneath a
wind at least it wa a pictur of someth hideou but much bigger
than you ah it grow and grow i am get it now macumazahn
come and stand by me and you yellow man turn your back so that you
face the fire bah it burn badli doe it not and the air is so
cold so cold i must make it brighter
ar you there macumazahn ye now look at thi stuff of mine see
what a fine blaze it caus and put hi hand into the bag he
drew out some kind of powder onli a littl of it which he threw on
to the ember then he stretch hi skinni finger over them as
though for warmth and slowli lift hi arm high into the air it is
a fact that after him the flame sprang up to a height of three or
four feet he drop hi arm again and the flame sank down he
lift them onc more and onc more thei rose onli thi time much
higher a third time he repeat thi perform and now the sheet
of flame sprang fulli fifteen feet into the air and so remain
burn steadili like the flame of a lamp
look at that fire macumazahn and you also yellow man he said in
a strang new voic a sort of dreami faroff voic and tell me if
you see anyth in it for i canti cant
i look and for a moment perceiv noth then some shape began to
grow upon the blaze background it waver it chang it becam
fix and definit ye clear and real there befor me etch in
flame i saw heuheuheuheu as he had been in the paint on the
cave wall onli as it seem to me aliv for hi ey blinkedheu
heu look like a devil in hell i gasp but stood firm as for
han he ejacul in hi vile dutch
allemaght da is die leelik auld deil that is almighti
there is the ugli old devil and have said thi roll over on to
hi back and lai still frozen with terror
ho ho ho laugh zikali ho ho ho and from a dozen place
the wall of the kloof echo back ho ho ho
chapter iv
the legend of heuheu
zikali stop laugh and contempl us with hi hollow ey
who wa it who first said that all men ar fool he ask i do
not know but i think it must have been a woman a pretti woman who
plai with them and found that it wa so if so she wa wise as all
women ar in their narrow wai which the sai show sinc thei ar
left out of it well i will add to the proverb all men ar coward
also in on matter or anoth though in the rest thei mai be brave
enough further thei ar all the same for what is the differ
between you macumazahn wise white man who have dare death a hundr
time and yonder littl yellow ap here he point to han ly
upon hi back with roll ey and mutter prayer to a varieti of
god between hi chatter teeth both of you ar afraid on as
much as the other the onli differ be that the white lord tri
to conceal hi fear whilst the yellow monkei chatter it out as
monkei do
why ar you so frighten just becaus by a common trick i show to
your ey a pictur of that which is in the mind of both of you mark
you again not by magic but by a common trick which ani child could
learn if somebodi taught it to him i hope that you will not behav
like thi when you see heuheu himself for if you do i shall be
disappoint in you and soon there will be two more skull in that
cave of hi but then perhap you will be brave ye i think so i
think so sinc never would you like to die rememb how long and
loud i should laugh when i heard of it
thu the old wizard rambl on as wa hi fashion when he wish to
combin hi acrid mockeri with the desir to gain space for thought
till present he grew silent and took some of the snuff which i had
brought him for he had been engag in open the packet while he
talk all the while continu to watch us as though he would search
out our veri soul
now becaus i thought that i must sai someth if onli to show that
he had not frighten me with hi accurs manifest or whatev
thei were i answer
you ar right zikali when you sai that all men ar fool see
that you ar the first and biggest fool among them
i have often thought it macumazahn for reason that i keep to
myself but why do you sai so let me hear who would learn whether
your ar the same as my own
first becaus you talk as though there were such a creatur as heu
heu which as you know well doe not live and never did and
secondli becaus you speak as though han and i would meet it face to
face which we shall never do so ceas from such nonsens and show us
how to make pictur in the firean art you tell us ani child could
learn
if thei ar taught macumazahn if thei ar taught how but were i
to do thi i should inde be the first of fool do you think that i
wish to establish two rival cheatsyou see between ourselv i give
myself my right namein the land to trade against me no no let
each keep the knowledg he ha gain for himself for if it becom
common to all who will pai for it but why do you believ that you
will never stand face to face with heuheu except in pictur on rock
or fire
becaus he doesnt exist i answer with irrit and if he
doe i suppos hi home is a long wai off and i cannot trek without
fresh oxen
ah said zikali that remind me of how you refug in the cave
from the storm and the rest said that you want more oxen so
know that you would be in as great a hurri to get to heuheu as a
young man is to find hi first wife i made readi the stori you heard
wa quit true a white trader did leav a veri fine team of footsor
oxen in thi neighbourhood salt everi on of them which after
three moon rest ar now fat and sound i will have them driven up
tomorrow morn and take care of your while you ar awai
i have no monei to pai for more oxen i said
is not the promis of macumazahn better than ani monei even the red
english gold doe not the whole land know it moreov he ad
slowli when you return from visit heuheu you ought to have
plenti of moneyor rather of diamond which is the same thingand
perhap of ivori though of that i am not so sure no i am not sure
whether you will be abl to carri the ivori if i do not speak truth i
will pai for the oxen myself
now at the word diamond i prick up my ear for just then all
africa wa begin to talk about these stone even han rose from
the ground and began onc more to take interest in earthli thing
that a fair offer i said but stop blow dust ie talk
nonsens and tell me straight out what you mean befor it grow
dark i hate thi kloof in the dark who is heuheu and if he or it
live or live where is heuheu dead or aliv also suppos that
there wa or is a heuheu why do you zikali wish me to find him as
i perceiv you do who alwai have a reason for what you wish
i will answer the last question first macumazahn who as you sai
alwai have a reason for what i want you or other to do
here he stop and clap hi hand whereon instantli on of hi
great serv men appear from the hut behind to whom he gave some
order the man dart awai and present wa back with more of the
skin bag such as witch doctor us to carri their medicin zikali
open on of these and show me that it wa almost empti there
be in it but a pinch of brown powder
thi stuff macumazahn he said is the most wonder of all
drug even more wonder than the herb call taduki that can open
the path of the past with which herb you will becom acquaint on
dai by mean of iti speak not of taduki but of the powder in the
bagi do most of my trick for instanc it wa with a dust of it
that i wa abl to show you and the littl yellow man the pictur of
heuheu in the flame just now
you mean that it is a poison i suppos
oh ye among other thing by ad anoth powder it can be made
into a veri deadli poison so deadli that as littl of it as will lie
upon the point of a thorn will kill the strongest man and leav no
trace but it ha other properti also that have to do with the mind
and the spirit never mind what thei ar if i tri to tell you you
would not understand well the tree of vision from the leav of
which thi medicin is ground grow onli in the garden of heuheu and
nowher els in africa and i got my last suppli of it thenc mani
year ago long befor you were born inde macumazahn never mind
how
now i must have more of those leav or what these zulu call my
magic which wise white men like you know to be but my trick will
fail me and the world will sai that the openerofroad ha lost hi
strength and turn to seek wiser doctor
then why do you not send and get some zikali
whom can i send that would dare to enter the land of heuheu and rob
hi garden no on but yourself macumazahn ah i read your mind you
ar wonder now if that be so why i do not order that the leav
should be brought to me from the place of heuheu for thi reason
macumazahn the dweller there mai not leav their hidden land it is
against their law moreov if thei might thei would not part even
with a hand of that drug except at a great price onc a hundr
year ago by which i suppos he meant a long time i paid such a
price and bought a quantiti of the stuff of which you see the last in
that bag but that is an old stori with which i will not troubl you
oh mani went and but two return and thei mad as those ar apt to
be who have look on heuheu and left him live if ever you see
heuheu macumazahn be sure to destroi him and all that is hi lest
hi curs should follow you for the rest of your dai fallen he will
be powerless but stand hi hate is veri strong and reach far
or that of hi priest doe which is the same thing
rubbish i said if there is ani heuheu he is but a big ap and
live or dead i am not afraid of ani ap
i am glad to hear that macumazahn and hope that you will alwai be
of the same mind doubtless it is onli hi pictur paint on rock or
in the fire that frighten you just as a dream is more terribl than
anyth real some dai you shall tell me which wa the wors heu
heu pictur or heuheu himself but you ask me other question
the first of them wa who is heuheu
well i do not know the legend tell that onc in the begin
there wa a peopl white or almost white who live far awai to the
north thi peopl sai the old tale were rule over by a giant
veri cruel and veri terribl a great wizard also or cheat as you
would call him so cruel and terribl wa he inde that hi peopl
rose against him and strong as he might be forc him to fly
southward with some who clung to him or could not escap him
so south he came with them thousand of mile until he found a
secret place that suit him to dwell in that place is beneath the
shadow of a mountain of a sort that i have heard spout out fire when
the world wa young which even now smoke from time to time here
thi peopl who ar name walloo built them a town after their
northern fashion out of the black stone which flow from the mountain
in past ag but their king the giant wizard continu hi
cruelti to them forc them to labour night and dai at hi citi and
great hous and a cave in which he wa worship as a god till at
last thei could bear no more and murder him by night
befor he di howev which he took long to do becaus of hi
magic he mock them tell them that not thu would thei be rid of
him sinc he would come back in a wors shape than befor and still
rule over them from gener to gener moreov he prophesi
disast to them and laid thi curs upon them that if thei strove to
leav the land that he had chosen and to cross the ring of mountain
by which it is enclos thei should die everi on of them thi
inde happen or so i have heard sinc if even on of them
travel down the river by which alon that countri can be approach
from the desert and set foot in the desert he di sometim by
sudden sick or sometim by the teeth of lion and other wild
beast that live in the great swamp where the river enter the desert
whither the eleph and other game come to drink from hundr of
mile around
perhap fever kill them i suggest
mayb so or poison or a curs at least soon or late thei die and
therefor it come about that now none of them leav that land
and what happen to the walloo after thei had finish off thi
kind king of their i ask for zikali romant fabl interest
me of cours i knew that it wa a fabl but in such tale
magnifi by nativ rumour there is sometim a grain of truth also
africa is a great countri and in it there ar veri queer place and
peopl
someth veri bad happen macumazahn for scarc wa their king
dead when the mountain began to belch out fire and hot ash which
kill mani of them and caus the rest to fly in boat across the
lake that make an island of the mountain to the forest land that
lie around there thei live to thi dai upon the bank of the river
which flow through the forest the same that pass through the gorg
of the mountain into the swamp and there lose itself in the desert
sand so at least my messeng told me a hundr year ago when
thei brought me the medicin that grow in heuheu garden
i suppos that thei were afraid to go back to their town after the
erupt wa over i said
ye thei were afraid at which you will not wonder when you see it
for when the mountain blew up the gase kill veri mani of them and
what is more turn them to stone ay there thei sit macumazahn
to thi dai turn to stone and with them their dog and cattl
now at thi amaz tale i burst out laugh and even han grin
i have note macumazahn said zikali that in the begin it is
you who alwai laugh at me while in the end it is i who laugh at you
and so i believ it will be in thi case also i tell you that there
those peopl sit turn to stone and if it is not so you need not
pai me for the oxen that i bought from the white man even should you
come back with your pocket full of diamond
now i bethought me of what happen at pompeii and ceas to laugh
after all the thing wa possibl
that is on reason why thei did not return to their town even when
the mountain went to sleep again but there wa anoth macumazahn
that wa stronger still soon thei found that it wa haunt
haunt by what by the stone men
no thei ar quiet enough though what their spirit mai be i cannot
tell you haunt by their king who thei had kill turn into a
gigant ap turn into heuheu
now at thi statement i did not laugh although at first sight it
seem much more absurd than that of the dead peopl who had been
petrifi for thi reason as i knew well it is the commonest of
belief among savag and especi those of central africa that
dead chief notabl if thei have been tyrant dure their life ar
metamorphos into some terribl anim which thenceforward
persecut them from gener to gener the anim mai be a
rogu eleph or a mankil lion or perhap a veri poison
snake but whatev shape it take it alwai ha thi characterist
that it doe not die and cannot be killedat ani rate by ani of
those whom it afflict inde in my own experi i have come
across sundri exampl of thi belief among nativ therefor it did
not strike me as strang that these peopl should imagin their
countri to be curs by the spirit of a legendari tyrant turn into a
monster
onli in the monster itself i put no faith if it exist at all
probabl it would resolv itself into a larg ap or perhap a
gorilla live upon an island in the lake where it had becom
maroon or drift upon a tree in a flood
and what doe thi spirit do i ask zikali incredul throw
nut or stone at peopl
no macumazahn accord to what i have been told it doe much
more at time it cross to the mainlandsom sai on a log some sai
by swim some sai as spirit can there if it meet ani on it
twist off hi or her head here i bethought me of the pictur in the
cave for no man can fight against it strength or woman either
becaus if she be old and ugli it serv her in the same fashion but
if she be young and well favour then it carri her awai the
island is said to be full of such women who cultiv the garden of
heuheu moreov it is report that thei have children who cross
the lake and live in the forestterr hairi creatur that ar
half human for thei can make fire and us club and bow and arrow
these savag peopl ar name heuheua thei dwell in the forest and
between them and the walloo there is perpetu war
anyth els i ask
ye on thing at a certain time of the year the walloo must take
their fairest and bestborn maiden and tie her to an appoint rock
upon the shore of the island upon a night of full moon then thei go
awai and leav her alon return at sunris
and what do thei find
on of two thing macumazahn either that the maiden ha gone in
which case thei ar well pleas except those of them to whom she is
relat or that she ha been torn to piec have been reject by
heuheu in which case thei weep and groan not for her but for
themselv
why do thei rejoic and why do thei weep zikali
for thi reason if the maiden ha been taken heuheu or hi
servant the heuheua will spare them and hi priest for that year
moreov their crop will prosper and thei be free from sick if
she ha been kill he or hi servant haunt them snatch awai
other women and thei will have bad harvest also fever and other
ill fall upon them therefor the offer of the maiden is their
great ceremoni which should she be taken is follow by the feast
of rejoic and should she be reject and slain by the fast of
lament and the sacrific of her parent or other
a pleasant religion zikali tell me is it on that pleas these
walloo
doe ani religion pleas ani man macumazahn and do tear want
sick bereav and death pleas those who ar born into the
world for exampl like the rest of us you white peopl suffer these
thing or so i have heard also you have your own heuheu or devil
who claim such sacrific and yet aveng himself upon you you ar
not pleas with him still you go on make your sacrific of war
and blood and all wicked in return for what he did to you therebi
bind yourselv to him afresh and confirm hi power over you
and as you do so do we all yet if you and the rest of us would but
stand up against him perhap hi strength might be broken or he
might be slain why then do we continu to sacrific our maiden of
virtu truth and puriti to him and how ar we better than those who
worship heuheu who do so to save their live
i consid hi argument which wa subtl for a savag howev old
and instruct to have evolv from hi limit opportun of
observ and answer rather humbl
i do not suppos that we ar better at all then to chang the
subject to someth more practic i ad but what about those
diamond
the diamond oho the diamond which by the wai i believ ar on
of the offer that you white peopl make to your own heuheu well
these peopl seem to have plenti of them of cours thei ar useless
to them as thei do not trade still the women know that thei ar
pretti and fasten them about themselv in littl net of hair after
polish them upon stone becaus thei do not know how to make hole
in them be so hard and cannot set them in metal also thei stick
them in the clai of their eat dish befor these ar dri make
pretti pattern with them it seem that these stone and other that
ar red ar wash down by the river from some desert across which it
flow abov through a tunnel in the mountain i believ at ani
rate thei find them in plenti in the gravel on it bank which thei
set the children to sift in a close woven siev of human hair or in
some such fashion stai i will show you what thei ar like for my
messeng brought me a fist or two mani year ago and he clap
hi hand
instantli as befor on of hi servant appear to whom he gave
certain instruct the man went and present return with a
littl packet of ancient wrinkl skin that look like a bit of an
old glove thi he unti and gave to me within were a quantiti of
small stone that look and felt like diamond veri good diamond
as i judg from their colour though none of them were larg also
among them wa a sprinkl of other stone that might have been
rubi though of thi i could not be sure at a guess i should have
estim the valu of the parcel at 200 or 300 pound when i had
examin them i offer them back to zikali but he wave hi hand
and said
keep them macumazahn keep them thei ar no good to me and when
you come to the land of heuheu compar them with those you will find
there just to show yourself that in thi matter i do not lie
when i come to the land of heuheu i exclaim indignantli where
then is thi land and how am i to reach it
that i propos to tell you tomorrow macumazahn not tonight sinc
it would be useless to wast time and breath upon the busi until i
know two thing first whether you will go there and secondli
whether the walloo will receiv you if you do go
when i have heard the answer to the second question we will talk of
the first zikali but why do you try to make a fool of me these
walloo and the savag heuheua with whom thei fight i understand
dwell far awai how then can you have the answer by tomorrow
there ar wai there ar wai he answer dreamili then seem to
go into a kind of doze with hi great head sunk upon hi breast
i stare at him for a while till grow weari of the occup i
look about me and note that of a sudden it wa grow dusk whilst
i did so i began to hear screech in the air sharp thin
screech such as ar made by rat
look baa whisper han in a frighten voic hi spirit
come and he point upward
i did look and far abov as though thei were descend from the
sky saw some widewing flitter shape three of them thei
descend in circl veri swiftli and i perceiv that thei were
bat enorm and evillook bat now thei were wheel about us
so close that twice their outstretch wing touch my face
send a horrid thrill through me and each time that a creatur
pass it screech in my ear set my teeth on edg
han tri to beat awai on of them from investig him whereon it
clung to hi hand and bit hi finger or so i judg from the yell he
gave after which he drag hi hat down over hi head and plung
hi hand into hi pocket then the bat concentr their attent
upon zikali round and round him thei went in a dizzi whirl which grew
closer and closer till at last two of them settl on hi shoulder
just by hi ear and began to twitter in them while the third hung
itself on to hi chin and thrust it hideou head against hi lip
at thi point in the proceed zikali seem to wake up for hi
ey open and grew bright also with hi skinni hand he stroke the
bat upon hi shoulder as though thei were pet bird more he seem
to speak with the creatur that hung to hi chin talk in a
languag which i could not understand while it twitter back the
answer in it slatepencil note then suddenli he wave hi arm and
all three of them took flight again wheel outward and upward
till present thei vanish in the gloom
i tame bat and these ar quit fond of me he said by wai of
explan then ad come back tomorrow morn macumazahn and
perhap i shall be abl to tell you whether the walloo wish for a
visit from you and if so to show you a road to their countri
so we went glad enough to get awai sinc the openerofroad with
hi peculiar talk and manifest as i believ thei call them in
spiritualist circl wa a person who soon got upon on nerv
especi at nightfal as we stumbl down that hate gorg in the
gloom han ask
what were those thing that hung to zikali shoulder and chin
bat veri larg bat what els i answer

whom he is send to those walloo just as he said
do you believ in the walloo and the heuheua then han i dont

them becaus zikali mean that we should and who is there that can
fight against the will of the openerofroad
chapter v
allan make a promis
i never could sleep well in the neighbourhood of the black kloof it
alwai seem to me to give out evil and disturb eman nor
wa thi night ani except to the rule for hour after hour
cogit the old wizard marvel tale of the walloo and heu
heu their devilghost i lai in the midst of the intens silenc of
that lone place which wa broken onli by the occasion scream of a
nighthawk or perhap of the prei that it grip or the echo
bark of some baboon among the rock
the stori wa foolish and yetand yet there were so mani strang
peopl hidden awai in the vast recess of africa and some of them
had these extrem queer belief or superstit inde i began to
wonder whether it is not possibl for these superstit persist
in through ag to produc someth concret at ani rate to the
mind of those whom thei affect
also there were odd circumst connect with thi tale or romanc
that might in a wai be call corrobor for instanc the
pictur of heuheu in the cave which zikali by hi infern art or
trick reproduc in the flame of fire for instanc the diamond
and rubi or crystal and spinel whichev thei might be that at
present repos in the pocket of my shoot coat these presum
them to be the former must have come from some veri faroff or hidden
spot sinc i had never seen or heard of such in ani place that i had
visit as thei were entir unlik those which at that time thei
were begin to find at kimberlei be for on thing much more
waterworn
still the presenc of diamond in a certain district had noth to
do with the possibl exist of a heuheu therefor thei prove
noth on wai or the other
and if there were a heuheu did i wish to meet him face to face in
on sens not at all but in anoth veri much inde my curios
wa alwai great and it would be wonder to behold that which no
white man ey had ever seen and still more wonder also to
struggl with and kill such a monster a vision rose befor my ey of
heuheu stuf in the british museum with a larg paint placard
underneath
shot in central africa by
allan quatermain esq
why then i the most humbl and unknown of person would becom
famou and have my like publish in the graphic and probabl
the illustr london new also perhap with my foot set upon the
breast of the prostrat heuheu
that inde would be glori onli heuheu look a veri nasti
custom and the stori might have a wrong end hi foot might be
set upon my breast and he might be twist off my head as in the
cave pictur well in that case the illustr paper would publish
noth about it
then there wa the stori of the town full of petrifi men and
anim thi must either be true or fals sinc it lack ghostli
implic although i had never heard of anyth of the sort
there might be such a place and if so it would be splendid to be it
discover
oh of what wa i think zikali yarn must be nonsens and rank
fiction yet it remind me of someth i had onc heard in my youth
which for a long while i could not recal at last in a flash it
came back to me my old father who wa a learn scholar had a book
of grecian legend and on of these about a ladi call andromeda
the daughter of a king who in obedi to popular pressur and in
order to avert calam from hi countri ti her up to a rock to
be carri off by a monster that rose out of the sea then a magic
aid hero of the name of perseu arriv at the critic moment
kill the monster and took awai the ladi to be hi wife
why thi heuheu stori wa the same thing over again the maiden wa
ti to a rock the monster came out of the sea or rather the lake
and carri her off wherebi calam were duli avert so similar
wa it inde that i began to wonder whether it were not an echo of
the ancient myth that somehow had found it wai into africa onli
hitherto there had been no perseu in heuheua land that role
appar wa reserv for me and if so what should i do with the
maiden restor her to a grate famili i suppos for certainli i
had no intent of marri her oh i wa grow silli with
think i would go to sleep i would i wo
a minut or two later or so it seem i woke up think not of
andromeda but of the prophet samuel and for a while wonder what on
earth could have put thi auster patriarch and priest into my head
then be a great student of the old testament i rememb that
autocrat seer indign when he heard the low of the oxen
which saul spare from the gener eat up of the amalekit as
the zulu would describ it by divin command what wa the us of
cut the throat of all that good stock person i could never
understand
well in my ear also wa the low of oxen which of cours form
the connect link i marvel what thei could be for our own were
graze at a littl distanc and poke my head out under the wagon
hood to perceiv a realli beauti team of trek cattl eighteen of
them for there were two spare beast which had just been driven up
to my camp by two strang kaffir then of cours i rememb about
the oxen which zikali had promis to sell me upon easi term or
under certain circumst to give me and thought to myself that in
thi matter at ani rate he had prove a wizard of hi word
slip on my trouser i descend from the wagon to examin them
and with the most satisfactori result thei had quit recov from
their poverti and footsor that had caus their former owner to
leav them behind in zikali charg and were now as fat as butter
look as though thei would pull anyth anywher inde even the
critic han express hi unqualifi approv of the beast which
as he point out from variou indic realli seem to be
salt and inocul also some of them as could be seen from the
loss of the end of their tail
have sent them to graze in charg of the kaffir who had brought
them for i did not wish them to mix with my own beast which show
sign of sick i breakfast in excel spirit as wherev i
might go i wa now set up with draught beast and then bethought me
of my undertak to revisit zikali han tri to excus himself from
accompani me sai that he want to studi the new oxen which
those strang zulu might steal etc the fact be of cours that
he wa afraid of the old wizard and would not go near him again
unless he were oblig howev i made him come sinc hi memori wa
first rate and four ear were better than two when zikali wa
concern
off we trudg up the kloof and as befor without delai were
admit within the fenc surround the witch doctor hut to find
the openerofroad seat in front of it as usual with a fire
burn befor him howev hot the weather he alwai kept that fire
go
what do you think of the oxen macumazahn he ask abruptli
i repli with caution that i would tell him after i had prove them
cun as ever said zikali well you must make the best of them
macumazahn and as i told you you can pai me when you get back
get back from where i ask
from wherev you ar go which at present you do not know
no i dont zikali i said and wa silent
he also wa silent for a long while so long that at last he outwor
my patienc and i inquir sarcast whether he had heard from
hi friend heuheu by batpost
ye ye i have heard or think that i have heardnot by bat but
perchanc by dream or vision oho macumazahn i have caught you
again why do you alwai walk into my snare so easili you see some
bat which in truth as i told you ar but creatur that i have
tame by feed them for mani year flitter about me and fly awai
and you half believ that i have sent them a thousand mile to carri a
messag and bring back an answer which is imposs
now i will tell the truth not thu do i commun with those who
ar afar nai i send out my thought and it fli everywher to the
end of the earth so that the whole earth might read it if it could
yet perchanc it is attun to on mind onli among the million by
which it can be caught and interpret but for the vulgary and
even for the wise white man who cannot understandther remain the
symbol of the bat and their messag why will you alwai seek the aid
of magic to explain natur thing macumazahn
now i reflect that my idea of natur and zikali differ but
know that he wa mock me after hi custom and declin to
enter into argument as though it were beneath me i said
all thi is so plain that i wonder you wast breath in set it
out i onli desir to know if you have ani answer to your messag
howev it wa sent and if sowhat answer
ye macumazahn as it happen i have it came to me just as i wa
wake thi morn thi is it substanc that the chief of the
walloo with whom my heart talk and as he believ most of hi
peopl will be veri glad to welcom you in their land though as he
believ again the priest of heuheu who worship him as a god and
ar sworn to hi servic will not be glad should you choos to come
the chief will give you all that you desir of the river diamond or
aught els that he possess and you can carri awai with you also
the medicin that i desir further he will protect you from
danger so far as he is abl yet for these gift he requir
payment
what payment zikali
the overthrow of heuheu at your hand
and if i cannot overthrow heuheu zikali
then certainli you will be overthrown and the bargain will fall to
the ground
is it so well if i go shall i be kill zikali
who am i that i should dispens life or death macumazahn yet he
ad slowli separ hi word by deliber pinch of snuff
yet i do not think that you will be kill if i did i should not
trust you to pai me for those oxen on your return also i believ that
you have much work left to do in the worldmi work some of it
macumazahn that could not be carri out without you thi be so
the last thing i should wish would be to send you to your death
i reflect that probabl thi wa true sinc alwai the old wizard
wa hint of some great futur enterpris in which we should be
mix up togeth also i knew that he had a regard for me in hi own
strang wai and therefor wish me no evil moreov of a sudden a
great long seiz me to undertak thi adventur in which perchanc
i might see remark new thingsi who wa weari of the old on
howev i hid thi if anyth could be hid from zikali and ask
in a businesslik fashion
where do you want me to go how far off is it and if i went how
should i get there
now we begin to handl our assegai macumazahn by which he meant
that we were come to busi hearken and i will tell you
tell me he did inde for over an hour but i will not troubl you
fellow with all that he said sinc geograph detail ar
wearisom and i want to get on with my stori you my friend thi wa
address to me the editor ar onli stop here over tomorrow
night and it will take me all that time to finish itthat is if you
wish to hear the end
it is enough to sai therefor that i had to trek about three hundr
mile north cross the zambesi and then trek anoth three hundr
mile west after thi i must travel norwest for a rather indefinit
distanc till i came to a gorg in certain hill here i must leav
the wagon if by thi time i had ani wagon and tramp for two dai
through a waterless patch of desert till i came to a swamplik oasi
here the river of which zikali had spoken lost itself in the sand of
the desert whenc i could see on a clear dai the smoke of the volcano
of which he had also spoken cross the swamp or make my wai
round it i must steer for thi slope till at length i came to a
second gorg in the mountain through which the river ran from
heuheua land out into the desert there accord to zikali i should
find a parti of walloo wait for me with cano or boat who would
take me on into their countri where thing would go as thei were
fate
befor you leav my friend i will give you a map of the rout
which i drew after travel it in case you or anybodi els should
like to form a compani and go to look for diamond and fossil men
in heuheua land stipul howev that you do not ask me to take
share in the ventur
if allan ever gave me thi map of which after the laps of so
mani year i am not sure i have put it awai so carefulli that it
is entir lost nor do i propos to hunt for it amidst the
accumul correspond of some fiveandthirti year
moreov if it were found and publish it might lead to foolish
specul and probabl loss of monei among maiden ladi the
clergi and other venturesom personseditor
so that the trek i said when at last zikali had finish well
i tell you straight out that i am not go to make it through unknown
countri how could i ever find my wai without a guid im off to
pretoria with your oxen or without them
is it so macumazahn i begin to think that i am veri clever i
thought that you would talk like that and therefor have made readi by
find a man who will lead you straight to the hous of heuheu
inde he is here and i will send for him and he summon a
servant in hi usual wai and gave an order
whenc doe he come who is he and how long ha he been here i
ask
i dont quit know who he is macumazahn for he doe not talk much
about himself but i understand that he come from the neighbourhood
of heuheua land or out of it for aught i know and he ha been here
long enough for me to be abl to teach him someth of our zulu
languag though that doe not matter much sinc you know arab well
do you not
i can talk it zikali and so can han a littl
well that is hi tongu macumazahn or so i believ which will
make thing easier i mai tell you at onc that he is a strang sort
of man not in the least like ani on you would expect but of that
you will judg for yourself
i made no answer but han whisper to me that doubtless he wa on
of the children of the heuheu and just like a great monkei although
he spoke in a low voic and at a distanc zikali seem to overhear
him for he remark
then you will feel as though you had found a new brother is it not
so lightindark which if i have not said so befor wa a
titl that han had earn upon a certain honour occas
thereon han grew silent sinc he dare not show hi resent of
thi comparison of himself to a monkei to the mighti openerofroad
i too wa silent be occupi with my own reflect for now
in a flash as it were i saw the whole trick laid bare of it
mysteri and pseudomag trap a messeng from some strang
and distant countri had come to zikali demand hi help for reason
that i did not know
thi he had determin to give through me whom he thought suit to
the purpos henc hi bribe of the oxen the new of which he had
convei to me while i wa still far off have in some wai becom
acquaint with my dilemma inde it look as though everyth had
been part of a plan though of cours thi wa not possibl sinc
zikali could not have arrang that i should take shelter in a
particular cave dure a thunderstorm
the sum of it wa howev that i should serv hi turn though what
exactli that might be i did not know he said that he want to obtain
the leav of a certain tree which perhap wa true but i felt sure
that there wa more behind
possibl hi curios wa excit and he desir inform about a
distant secret peopl sinc for knowledg of everi kind he had a
perfect lust or perhap in some occult fashion thi heuheu if there
were a heuheu might be a rival who stood between him and hi plan
and therefor wa on to be remov
allow nineti per cent of zikali supernatur power to be pure
humbug without doubt the remain ten per cent were genuin
certainli he live and move and had hi be upon a differ plane
from that of ordinari mortal and wa in touch with thing and power
of which we ar ignor also as i have reason to know though i do
not troubl you with instanc he wa in touch with other of the
same class or hierarchi throughout africay thousand of mile
distantof whom some mai have been hi friend and some hi enemi
but all were mighti in their wai
while i wa reflect thu and old zikali wa read my thoughtsa
i am sure he did for i saw him smile in hi grim manner and nod hi
great head as though in approv of my acumenth servant return
from somewher usher in a tall figur picturesqu drape in a
fur kaross that cover hi head as well as hi bodi arriv in front
of us thi person threw off the kaross and bow in salut first
to zikali and then to myself inde so great wa hi polit that
he even honour han in the same wai but with a slighter bow
i look at him in amaz as well i might sinc befor me stood
the most beauti man that i had ever seen he wa tall someth
over six feet high and superbl shape have a deep chest a sinewi
form and hand and feet that would have done credit to a greek
statu hi face too wa wonder if rather sombr perfectli
chisel and almost white in colour with great dark ey and there
wa someth about it that suggest high and ancient blood he
look inde as though he had just step straight out of the
bygon ag he might have been an inhabit of the lost contin of
atlanti or a sunburn old greek for hi hair which wa chestnut
brown curl tightli even where it hung down upon hi shoulder
though none grew upon hi chin or about the curv lip perhap he
wa shaven in short he wa a gloriou specimen of mankind differ
from ani other i had seen
hi costum too wa strike and peculiar although dilapid
inde it might have been rifl from the bodi of an egyptian
pharaoh it consist of a linen robe that seem to be twist about
him which wa broider at the edg with fade purpl a tall and
batter linen headdress shape like the lower half of a sodawat
bottl revers and come to a point a leather apron narrow at the
top but broaden toward the knee also broider and sandal of
the same materi
i stare at him amaz wonder whether he belong to some peopl
unknown to me or wa anoth of zikali illus and so did han
for hi muddi littl ey nearli fell out of hi head and he ask me
in a whisper
is he a man baa or a spirit
for the rest the stranger wore a plain torqu or necklet appar of
gold and about him wa girdl a crosshilt sword with an ivori
handl and a red sheath
for a while thi remark person stood befor us hi hand fold
and hi head bent in a humbl fashion though it wa realli i who
should have been humbl ow to the physic contrast between us
appar he did not think it proper to speak first while zikali
squat there grimli not help me at all at last see that
someth must be done i rose from the stool upon which i wa seat
and held out my hand after a moment hesit the splendid
stranger took it but not to shake in the usual fashion for he bent
hi head and gentli touch my finger with hi lip as though he
were a french courtier and i a pretti ladi i bow again with the
best grace i could command then put my hand in my trouser pocket
said how do you do and as he did not seem to understand repeat
it in the zulu word sakubona thi also fail i greet him in
the name of the prophet in my best arab
here i struck oil as an american friend of mine name brother john
us to sai for he repli in the same tongu or someth like it
speak in a soft and pleas voic but without allud to the
prophet he address me as great lord macumazahn whose fame and
prowess echo across the earth and a lot of other nonsens with
which i could see that zikali had stuf him that mai be omit
thank you i cut in thank you mr and i paus
my name is issicor he said
and a veri nice name too though i never heard on like it i
repli well issicor what can i do for you an inadequ
remark i admit but i want to come to the fact
everyth he answer fervent press hi hand to hi breast
you can save from death a most beauti ladi who will love you
will she i exclaim then i will have noth to do with that
busi which alwai lead to troubl
here zikali broke in for the first time speak veri slowli to
issicor in zulu which i rememb he said he had been teach him
and sai
the lord macumazahn is alreadi full of woman love and ha no room
for more speak not to him of love o issicor lest you should anger
the ghost of on who haunt thi spot a certain royal mameena whom
onc he knew too well
now i turn upon zikali promis to give him a piec of my mind
when issicor smile a littl repeat
who will love youa a brother
that better i said though i dont know that i want to take on a
sister at my time of life but i suppos you mean that she will be
much oblig
that is so o lord also the reward will be great
ah i repli realli interest now be so good as to tell me
exactli what you want
well to cut a long stori short with variat he repeat zikali
tale i wa to travel to hi remot land bring about the destruct
of a nebul monster or fetish or system of religion and in
payment to be given as mani diamond as i could carri
but why cant you get rid of your own devil i ask you look a
warrior and ar big and strong
lord he repli gentli spread out hi hand in an appeal
fashion i am strong and i trust that i am brave but it cannot be
no man of my peopl can prevail against the god of my peopl if so he
mai be call even to revil him openli would bring a curs upon us
moreov hi priest would murder us
so he ha priest i interrupt
ye lord the god ha priest sworn to hi servic evil men as he
is evil o lord come i beseech you and save sabeela the beauti
why ar you so interest in thi ladi i ask
lord becaus she love menot as a brotherand i love her she
the great ladi of my land and my cousin is my betroth and if the
god is not overthrown as the fairest of all our maiden she will be
taken by the god here emot seem to overcom him veri real
emot which touch me for he bow hi head and i saw tear
trickl down from hi dark ey
hearken lord he went on there is an ancient propheci in my land
that thi god of our whose hideou shape hide the spirit of a long
dead chief can onli be destroi by on of anoth race who can see
in the night some man of great valour destin to be born in due
season now through our dreamdoctor i caus enquiri to be made of
thi master of spirit who is name zikali for i wa in despair and
knew what must happen at the appoint time from him i learn that
there live in the south such a man as is spoken of in the propheci
and that hi name meant watcherbynight then i dare the journei and
the curs and came to seek you and lo i have found you
ye i answer you have found on whose nativ name mean
watcherbynight but who cannot see in the dark better than ani on
els and is not a hero or veri brave but onli a trader and a hunter
of wild beast yet i tell you issicor that i do not wish to
interfer with your god and priest and tribal matter or to give
battl to some great ap if it exist on the chanc of earn a
pocket of bright stone should i live to take them awai and of
get a bundl of leav that thi doctor desir you had better
seek some other white man with ey like a cat and more strength and
courag issicor
how can i see anoth when without doubt you ar the on appoint
lord if you will not come then i return to die with sabeela and all
is finish
he paus a few moment and continu lord i can offer you littl
but is not a good deed it own reward and will not the memori of it
feed your heart through life and death becaus you ar nobl i
beseech you to come not for what you mai gain but just becaus you
ar nobl and will save other from cruelti and wrong i have spoken
choos
why did you not bring zikali hi accurs leav yourself i ask
furious
lord i could not come to the place where that tree grow in the
garden of heuheu nor inde did i know that thi master of spirit
need that medicin lord be nobl accord to your natur which
is known afar
now i tell you fellow when i heard thi i felt flatter we all
think that we ar nobl at time but there ar preciou few who tell
us so and therefor the thing came as a pleasant surpris from thi
extraordinarili dignifi handsom and if it would appear in hi own
fashion welleduc son of hamif he were a son of ham to my
mind he look more like a princ in disguis somebodi of unknown
but highli distinguish race who had walk out of a fairi book but
when i came to think of it that wa exactli what he said he wa
anywai he wa a most discrimin person with a singular insight
into charact it did not occur to me at the moment that zikali wa
also a discrimin person with an insight into charact which had
induc him to bring us two togeth for secret purpos of hi own
or that in order to impress me he had stuf issicor with the
stori of a predestin white man told of in propheci who could see
in the dark as without doubt he had done
also the adventur propos wa of an order so wild and unusu that
it drew me like a magnet suppos that i live to old ag could i
allan quatermain bear to look back and rememb that i had turn
down an opportun of that sort and wa depart into the grave
without know if there wa or wa not a heuheu who snatch awai
love andromedasi mean sabeelasoff rock and combin in hi
hideou person the qualiti of a god or fetish a ghost a
devil and a supergorilla
could i buri my two humbl talent of adventur and straight shoot
in that fashion realli i thought not for if i did how could i face
my own conscienc in those last fail year and yet there wa so
much to be said on the other side into which i need not enter in the
end be unabl to make up my mind i fell into weak and
determin to refer the matter to fate ye i determin to toss up
us han for the spin coin
han i said in dutch a tongu which neither of the other two
understood shall we travel to thi man countri or shall we stai
in our own you have heard all speak and i will accept your judgment
do you understand
ye baa said han twirl hi hat in hi vacant fashion i
understand that the baa as is usual when he is in a deep pit seek
the wisdom of han to get him outof han who ha brought him up from
a child and taught him most of what he know of han upon whom hi
reverend father the predik us to lean as upon a staff that is
after he had made him into a good christian but the matter is
import and befor i give my judgment that will settl it on wai
or anoth i would ask a few question
then he wheel round and address the patient issicor in hi
vile arab said
long baa with a hook nose tell me do you know the wai back to
thi countri of your and if so how much of it can be travel in a
wagon
i do answer issicor and all of it can be travel in a wagon
until the first rang of hill is reach also along it there is
plenti of game and water except in the desert of which you have been
told the journei should take about three moon though myself alon
i accomplish it in two
good and if my baa macumazahn come to your countri how will he
be receiv
well by most of the peopl but not well by the priest of heuheu
if thei think he come to harm the god and certainli not well by the
hairi folk who live in the forest who ar call the children of the
god with these he must be prepar to war though the propheci sai
that he will conquer all of them
is there plenti to eat in your countri and is there tobacco and
someth better than water to drink long baa
there is plenti of all these thing there is wealth of everi kind o
counsellor of the white lord and all of them shall be hi and your
though he ad with mean those who have to deal with the
priest of the god and the hairi folk would do well to drink water
lest thei should be found asleep
have you gun there han ask point to my rifl
no our weapon ar sword and spear and the hairi folk shoot with
arrow from bow
han ceas from hi question and began to yawn as though he were
tire as he did so stare up at the sky where some vultur were
wheel
baa he said how mani vultur do you see up there is it seven
or eight i have not count them but i think there ar seven
no han there ar eight on the highest wa hid behind a cloud
you ar quit sure that there ar eight baa
quit i answer angrili why do you ask such silli question when
you can count for yourself
han yawn again and said then we will go with thi fine hook
nose baa to the countri of heuheu that is settl
what the deuc do you mean han what on earth ha the number of
vultur got to do with the matter
everyth baa you see the burden of thi choic wa too heavi
for my shoulder so i lift my ey and put up a prayer to your
reverend father to help me and in do so saw the vultur then
your reverend father in the heaven abov seem to sai to me if
there ar an even number of vultur han then go if an odd number
then stop where you ar but han do not count the vultur make my
son the baa allan count them for then he will not be abl to
grumbl at you if thing turn out badli whether you go or whether you
stai behind and sai that you count wrong or cheat and now
baa i have had enough of thi and should like to return to our
outspan and examin those new oxen
i look at han speechless with indign in my cowardic i had
left it to hi cun and experi to decid thi matter virtual
toss up as i have said and what had the littl rascal done he
had concoct on of hi yarn about my poor old father and toss up
in hi turn go odd or even on the number of the vultur which he
made me count so angri wa i that i lift my foot with mean
whereon han who had been expect someth of the sort bolt
and i did not see him again until i got back to the camp

becaus you have to leav tomorrow morn earli and must see to your
pack befor you get to bed therefor i am go to skip a lot
all about our journei for instanc although in fact it wa on of
the most interest trek i ever made and for much of the wai
through a countri that wa quit new to me about which on might
write a book
i will simpli sai therefor that in due cours after some necessari
delai to repack the wagon leav behind all articl that were not
want in zikali charg we trek from the black kloof the oxen
that i had boughton creditfrom zikali were in the yoke and we
drove with us hi two extra beast as well as four of the best of my
old team to serv as spare
also i took in addit to my own driver and voorloop mavoon and
induka two other zulu zikali servant who i knew would be
faith becaus thei fear their terribl master although i knew
also that thei would spy upon me and if ever thei return aliv
make report of everyth to him
well leav out all the detail of thi remark trek in which we
met with no fight disast or great troubl and alwai had
plenti to eat game be numer throughout i will take up the tale
on our arriv safe and sound at the first line of hill that i show
upon the map of which zikali had spoken as border the desert here
we were oblig to leav the wagon for it wa imposs to get it
over the hill or through the desert beyond
thi fortun we were abl to do at a littl villag of peaceabl
folk who live in a charm and wellwat situat and have
no near neighbour were abl to cultiv their land unmolest i
place it in the charg of mavoon and induka whom i could trust and
who would not run awai also the oxen of which by good fortun we
had onli lost three with them as issicor declar that we must go
on alon i left zikali servant know that thei would keep an
ey on my men and my men on them and promis the headman of the
villag a good present if we found everyth safe on our return
he said that he would do hi best but ad impressivelyh wa a
melancholi personthat if we were go to the countri of heuheu we
never should return as it wa a land of devil in that event he
ask what wa to happen to the wagon and good i repli that i had
given order that if i did not reappear within a year it wa to trek
back to whenc we came and announc that we were gone but that he
need not be afraid as be a great magician i knew that we should
be back long befor that time
he shrug hi shoulder look doubtfulli at issicor and there
the convers end howev i persuad him to lend us three of
hi peopl to guid us across the mountain and to carri water through
the desert on the understand that thei should be allow to return
as soon as we sight the swamp noth would induc them to go
nearer to the countri of heuheu
so in due cours off we start leav mavoon and induka almost in
tear for the gloom of the headman had spread to them and thei too
believ that thei would see us no more han it is true thei never
would have miss sinc thei hate him as he hate them but in my
case the matter wa differ becaus thei love me in their own wai
our baggag wa light rifl i took a doublebarrel express as
much ammunit as we could manag some medicin blanket etc a
few spare cloth and boot for myself a coupl of revolv and as
mani vessel of on sort or anoth as possibl to carri water
includ two paraffin tin slung at either end of a piec of wood
after the fashion of a milkman yoke also we had tobacco a good
suppli of match candl and a bundl of dri biltong to eat in
case we found no game it doesnt sound much but befor we got across
that desert i felt inclin to throw awai half of it inde i dont
think we could have got the stuff over the mountain pass which prove
to be precipit without the assist of the three waterbear
it took us twelv hour to reach and cross that mountain crest just
beneath which we camp and anoth six to descend the other side
next dai at it foot wa thin tussocki grass with occasion thorn
tree grow in a barren veldt that by degre merg into desert by
the last water we camp for the second night then have fill up
all our vessel start out into the arid sandi wilder
now you fellow know what an african desert is for we went through a
wors on than thi on our journei to solomon mine still the
particular specimen i am speak of wa pretti bad to begin with
the heat wa tremend then in part it consist of roll
slope or wave of sand up which we must scrambl and down which we
must slidea most exhaust process further there grew in it a
varieti of thickleav plant with sharp spine that if touch
caus a pain sore which abomin and useless growth made
it imposs to travel at night or even if the light were low when
thei could not be seen and avoid
we spent three dai cross that wretch desert that had anoth
peculiar here and there in it wast column of stone polish
by blow sand stood up like obelisk sometim in on piec
monolith and sometim in sever pile on each other i suppos
that thei were the remain of strata hard core that had resist the
action of wind and water which in the cours of thousand or million
of year had worn awai the softer rock grind it to dust
those obelisklik column gave a veri strang appear to that
wilder suggest the idea of monument also incident thei
were us sinc it wa by them that our waterbear guid who
were accustom to haunt the place to kill ostrich or to steal their
egg steer their path of these ostrich we saw a good number
which show that the desert could not be so veri wide sinc in it
there seem to be noth for them to live on unless thei at the
prickli plant there wa no other life in the place
fortun by dint of economi and selfdeni our water held out
until on the afternoon of the third dai as we trudg along parch
and weari from the crest of on of the sand wave we saw far off a
patch of dens green that mark the end or rather the begin
of the swamp now our agreement with the guid wa that when thei
came in sight of thi swamp thei should return for which purpos we
had save some of the water for them to drink on their homeward
journei
after a brief consult howev thei determin to come on with
us and when i ask why wheel round and point to dens cloud
that were gather in the heaven behind us these cloud thei
explain foretold a sand tempest in which no man could live in the
desert therefor thei urg us forward at all speed inde
exhaust as we were we cover the last three mile between us and
the edg of the swamp at a run as we reach the reed the storm
burst but still we plung forward through them till we came to a
spot where thei grew dens and where by dig pit in the mud
with our hand we could get water which thick as it wa we drank
greedili here we crouch for hour while the storm rage
it wa a terrif sight for now the face of the desert behind wa
hidden by cloud of driven sand which even among the reed fell upon
us thickli so that occasion we had to rise to shake it weight
off us had we still been in the desert we should have been buri
aliv as it wa we escap though half choke and with our skin
fret by the wear of the particl of sand
so we squat all night till befor dawn the storm ceas and the sun
rose in a perfectli clear sky have drunk more water of which we
seem to need enorm quantiti we struggl back to the edg of
the swamp and from the crest of a sand wave look about us issicor
stretch out hi arm toward the north and touch me on the
shoulder i look and far awai stain the delic blue of the
heaven perceiv a dark mushroomshap patch of vapour
it is a cloud i said let us go back to the reed the storm is
return
no lord he answer it is the smoke from the fire mountain of my
countri
i studi it and said noth reflect howev that in thi
particular at ani rate zikali had not li if so wa it not
possibl that he had spoken truth about other matter also if there
exist a volcano as yet unreport by ani explor might there not
also be a buri citi fill with petrifi peopl and even a heu
heu no in heuheu i could not believ
here after thei had fill themselv and their gourd with water
the three nativ from the villag left us sai that thei would go
no farther and that thei could now depart safe as the sandstorm
would not return for some week thei ad that our magic must be
veri strong sinc had we delai even for a few hour we should
certainli all have been kill
so thei depart and we camp by the reed hope to rest after our
exhaust journei in thi howev we were disappoint for as
soon as the sun went down we becam awar that thi vast area of
swampi land wa the haunt of countless game that came thither i
suppos from all the countri round in order to drink and to fill
themselv with it succul growth
by the light of the moon i saw great herd of eleph appear out
of the shadow and march majest toward the water also there
were troop of buffalo some of which broke out of the reed show
that thei had hidden there dure the dai and almost everi kind of
antelop in plenti while in the morass itself we could hear sea cow
wallow and grunt and great splash which i suppos were caus
by frighten crocodil leap into pool
nor wa thi all sinc so much anim life upon which thei could prei
attract mani lion that cough and roar and slew accord to
their natur whenev on of them sprang on to some helpless buck a
stamped of all the game in the neighbourhood would follow the nois
thei made crash through the reed wa terrif so much so that
sleep wa imposs moreov there wa alwai a possibl that
the lion might be tempt to try a chang of diet and eat us
especi as we had no bush with which to form a boma or fenc
so we made a big fire of dry last year reed of which
fortun there were mani stand near and kept watch
onc or twice i saw the long shape of a lion pass us but i did not
fire for fear lest i should wound the beast onli and perhap caus it
to charg in short the place wa a verit sportsman paradis
and yet quit useless from a hunter point of view sinc if he
kill eleph it would be imposs to carri the ivori across the
desert and onli a boi desir to slaughter game in order to leav it
to rot at dawn it is true i did shoot a reed buck for food which
wa the onli shot i fire
as amidst all thi hubbub the idea of sleep must be abandon i took
the opportun to question issicor about hi countri and what lai
befor us there dure our journei i had not talk much to him on
the matter sinc he seem veri silent and reserv all hi energi
be concentr upon push forward as quickli as possibl also
there wa no object in do so while we were still far awai now
howev i thought that the time had come for a talk
in answer to my queri he said that if we travel hard by
march round the narrow western end of the swamp in three dai we
should arriv at the mouth of the gorg down which the river ran that
flow through the mountain surround hi countri these mountain
i should add we had sight as a black line in the distanc almost as
soon as we enter the desert which show that thei were high here
if we reach it without accid he hope to find a boat wait in
which we could be paddl to hi town though why anybodi should be
expect us i could not elicit from him
leav that question unsolv i ask him about thi town and it
inhabit he repli that it wa larg and contain a great number
of peopl though not so mani as it us to do in bygon gener
the race wa dwindl partli from intermarriag and partli becaus
of the terror in which thei live that made the women unwil to
bear children lest these should be snatch awai by the hairi folk who
dwelt in the surround forest or perhap sacrif to the god
himself i inquir whether he realli believ that there wa such a
god and he repli with earnest that certainli he did as onc he
had seen him though from some wai off and he wa so aw that
descript wa imposs i must judg of him for myself when we met
an occas that i began to wish might be avoid
i crossexamin him persist about thi god but with small
result for the subject seem to be on on which he did not care to
dwell i gather howev that he issicor had been in a cano
when he saw heuheu on a rock at dawn surround by women upon the
occas of some sacrific and that he had not look much at him
becaus he wa afraid to do so he note howev that he wa taller
than a man and walk stiffli he ad that heuheu never came to the
mainland though hi priest did
then drop the subject of heuheu he went on to tell me of the
system of govern amongst the walloo which it appear wa an
hereditari chieftainship that could be held either by men or women
the present chief an old man like the peopl wa name walloo as
inde were all the chief of the tribe in success for walloo
wa realli a titl which he thought had come with them from whatev
land thei inhabit in the dark forgotten ag he had but on child
live a daughter the ladi sabeela of whom he had spoken to me at
the hut of the openerofroad she who wa doom to sacrific he
issicor wa her second cousin be descend from the brother of
her grandfath and therefor of the pure walloo blood
then if thi ladi di i suppos you would be the chief issicor
i said
ye lord by descent he answer yet perhap not so there is
anoth power in the land greater than that of the king or chief
the power of the priest of heuheu it is their purpos lord should
sabeela die to seiz the chieftainship for themselv a certain
dacha who is also of the pure walloo blood is the chief priest and
he ha son to follow him
then it is to thi dacha interest that sabeela should die
it is to hi interest lord that she should die and i also or
better still both of us togeth for then hi part would be clear
but what of her father the walloo he cannot desir the death of hi
onli child
nai lord he love her much and desir that she should marri me
but as i have said he is an old man and terrorhaunt he fear
the god who alreadi ha taken on of hi daughter he fear the
priest who ar the oracl of the god and it is said murder
hi son as thei have striven to murder me therefor be frozen by
fear he is powerless and without hi leadership none can act sinc
all must be done in the name of the walloo and by hi author yet
it wa he also who sent me to seek for help from the great wizard of
the south with whom he and hi father have had deal in bygon
year ye becaus of the ancient propheci that the god could onli be
overthrown and the tyranni of the priest be broken by a white man
from the south he sent me who am the betroth of hi daughter
secretli and without the knowledg of dacha and becaus of sabeela i
dare the curs and went for which deed perchanc i must pai dearli
he it is also who watch for my return
and if he exist which you have not prove to me how am i to kill
thi god issicor by shoot him
i do not know lord it is believ that he cannot be harm by
weapon over whom onli fire and water have power sinc legend tell
that he came out of the fire and certainli he live surround by
water the propheci doe not sai how he will be kill by the stranger
from the south
now listen to thi weird talk in that wildbeastpeopl
wilder from the mouth of a man who evid wa veri frighten
and weari as i wa i confess that i grew frighten also and
wish most heartili that i had never been beguil into thi
adventur probabl the terribl god of whom i could learn no
detail question as i would wa noth but an invent of the
priest or perhap on of their number disguis but howev thi
might be no doubt i wa travel to a fetishridden land in which
witchcraft and murder were rampant in short on of satan peculiar
possess ye i allan quatermain wa brought here to plai the
part of a modern hercul and clean out thi augean stabl of
bloodsh and superstit to sai noth of fight the lion in
the shape of heuheu alwai suppos that there wa a heuheu a
creatur taller than a man that walk stiffli whom issicor
believ he had onc seen from a distanc at dawn
howev i wa in for it and to show fear would be as useless as it
wa undignifi sinc unless i turn and ran back into the desert
which my pride would never suffer me to do i could see no escap
have put my hand to the plough i must finish the furrow so i sat
silent make no comment upon issicor rather nebul inform
onli after a while i ask him casual when thi sacrific wa to
take place to which he repli with evid agit
on the night of the full harvest moon which is thi moon fourteen
dai from now wherefor we must hurri sinc at best it will take us
five dai to reach the town of walloo three in travel round the
swamp and two upon the river do not delai lord i prai you do not
delai lest we should be too late and find sabeela gone
no i answer i shall not be late and i can assur you my
friend issicor that the sooner i am through with thi busi on
wai or anoth the better i shall be pleas and now that all those
beast in the swamp seem to have grown a littl quieter i will try to
go to sleep
happili i wa success in thi effort and obtain sever hour
sound rest which i need sore befor the sun appear and han
woke me i rose and take my rifl shot a fat reedbuck which i
select out of a number which stood quit close by a young femal
off which we breakfast for as you know if the meat of antelop
is cook befor it grow cold it is often as tender as though it had
been hung for a week the odd thing wa that the sound of the shot did
not seem to disturb the other beast at all evid thei had never
heard anyth of the sort befor and thought that their companion
wa just ly down
an hour later we start on our long tramp round the edg of that
swamp i did not like to march befor for fear lest we should get into
complic with the herd of eleph and other anim that were
trek out of it in all direct with the light though where thei
went to feed i am sure i do not know in all my life i never saw such
quantiti of game as had collect in thi place which probabl
furnish the onli water for mani mile round
howev as i have said it wa of no us to us and therefor our
object wa to keep as clear of it as possibl even then we stumbl
right on to a sleep white rhinocero with the longest horn that
ever i saw it must have measur nearli six feet and anywher els
would have been a great prize fortun the wind wa blow from
it to us so it did not smell us and charg off in anoth direct
for as you know the rhinocero is almost blind
now i am not go to give all the detail of that intermin trudg
through sand for in the mud of the swamp we could not walk at all
dure the dai we were scorch by the heat and at night we were
torment by mosquito and disturb by the nois of the game and the
roar of lion which fortun be so full fed never molest
us by the third night bear alwai to the right we had come quit
close to the mountain rang which although it wa not so veri lofti
seem to be absolut precipit face inde by sheer cliff
that rose to a height of from five to eight hundr feet to what
extraordinari geolog condit these black cliff and the desert
by which thei were surround ow their origin i am sure i do not
know but there thei were and no doubt ar
befor sunset on thi third dai by issicor direct we collect
a huge pile of dri reed which we set upon the crest of a sand
mound and after dark fire them so that for a quarter of an hour or
so thei burn in a bright column of flame issicor gave no
explan of thi proceed but as han remark doubtless it wa
a signal to hi friend next morn at hi request we start on
befor the dawn take our chanc of meet with eleph or
buffalo and at sunris found ourselv right under the cliff
an hour later follow a littl bai in them where there wa no
swamp becaus here the ground rose of a sudden we turn a corner
and perceiv a tall whiterob man with a big spear stand upon a
rock evid keep a lookout as soon as he saw us he leapt down
from hi rock with the agil of a klipspring and came toward
us
after on curiou glanc at me he went straight to issicor knelt
down and take hi hand press it to hi forehead which show me
that our guid wa a vener person then thei convers togeth in
low tone after which issicor came to me and said that so far all
wa well as our fire had been seen and a big cano await us we
went on guid by the sentri and after on turn suddenli came on
quit a larg river which had been hidden by the reed to the left
appear thi deep slowflow river to the right within a hundr
pace inde it chang into swamp or morass of which the pool
were fring with veri tall and beauti papyru plant such open
water as there wa be almost cover by everi kind of wild fowl
that rose in flock with a deafen clamour thi stream the black
river as the walloo call it wa border on either side by
precipic through which i suppos it had cut it wai in the cours of
millennium so high and impend that thei seem almost to meet
abov leav the surfac of the water nearli dark it wa a stream
gloomi as the roman styx and glanc at it i half expect to see
charon and hi boat approach to row us to the infern field
inde into my mind there float a memori of the poet line which
i hope i quot correctli
in kubla khan a river ran
through cavern measureless to man
down to a sunless sea
i confess honestli that the aspect of the place fill me with fear
it wa forbiddinginde unholyand i marvel what kind of a
sunless sea lai beyond thi hell gate had i been alon or with han
onli i admit that i should have turn tail and march back round
that swamp upon which at ani rate the sun shone and if i could
across the desert beyond to where i had left the wagon but in the
presenc of the state issicor and hi myrmidon thi i could not
do becaus of my white man pride no i must go on to the end
whatev it might be
if i wa frighten han wa much more so for hi teeth began to
chatter with terror
oh baa he said if thi is the door what will the hous beyond
be like
that we shall learn in due cours i answer so there is no good
in think about it
follow me lord said issicor after some further talk with hi
companion
i did so accompani by han who stuck to me as close as possibl
we advanc round the rock and discov a littl indent in the bank
of the river where a great cano hollow appar from a singl
huge tree or rather it prow wa drawn up on the sandi shore in
thi cano sat sixteen rower or paddlemeni rememb there were
sixteen of them becaus at the time han remark that the number wa
the same as that of a wagon team and subsequ call these
paddler water oxen
as we approach thei lift their paddl in salut appar of
issicor sinc of me and my companion except by swift surreptiti
glanc thei took no notic
with a kind of silent unobtrus hast issicor caus our small
baggag which consist chiefli of cartridg bag to be stow awai
in the prow of the cano that for a few feet wa hollow out in such
a fashion that it made a kind of cupboard roof with solid wood and
show us where to sit next he enter it himself while the lookout
man ran down the cano and took hold of the steer oar
then at a word all the paddler backwat and the craft slid off
the sandi beach into the river which wa full to the bank almost in
flood inde it seem that here the rain had been nearli incess
for some month and the lower sky show that er long there wa
much more to come
chapter vii
the walloo
in perfect still except for the sound of the dip of the
paddl in the water we glide awai veri swiftli up the placid river
i think that noth upon thi strang journei or at ani rate dure
the first part of it struck me more than it quiet the water wa
still flow peacefulli between it rocki wall toward the desert
in which it would be lost just as the life of some good man flow
toward death the rocki precipic on either side were still thei
were so steep that on them noth which breath could find a
foot except bat perhap that do not stir in the daytim the
riband of grei sky abov us wa still though occasion a draught
of air blew between the cliff with a moan nois such as on might
imagin to be caus by the pass wind of spiritu wing but
stillest of all were those rower who for hour after hour labour at
their task in silenc and with a curiou intent or if speak
thei must did so onli in a whisper
gradual an impress of nightmar stole over me i felt as though i
were a sleeper take part in the drama of a dream perhap in fact
thi wa so sinc i wa veri tire have rest but littl for a
good mani night and labour hard dure the dai trudg through the
sand with a heavi rifl and a load of cartridg upon my back so
realli i mai have been in a doze such as is easili induc in ani
circumst by the sound of lap water if so it wa not a
pleasant dream for the titan surround in which i found myself
and the dread possibl of the whole enterpris oppress my
spirit with a sensat of departur from the familiar thing of life
into someth unholi and unknown
soon the cliff grew so high and the light so faint that i could onli
just see the stern handsom face of the rower appear as thei
bent forward to their order stroke and vanish into the gloom as
thei leant back after it wa accomplish the veri regular of the
effort produc a kind of mesmer effect which wa unpleas the
face look to me like those of ghost peep at on through crack
of the curtain round a bed then vanish continu to return and
peep again
i suppos that at last i went to sleep in good earnest it wa a
haunt sleep howev for i dream that i wa enter into some
dim hade where all realiti had been replac by shadow
strengthless but alarm
at length i wa awaken by the voic of issicor sai that we had
come to the place where we must rest for the night as it wa
imposs to travel in the dark and the rower were weari here the
cliff widen out a littl leav a strip of shore upon either side
of the river upon which we land by the last light that struggl
to us from the line of sky abov we at such food as we had
supplement by biscuit of a sort that were carri in the cano for
no fire wa light befor we had finish dens dark fell upon
us for the moonbeam were not strong enough to penetr into that
place so that there wa noth to be done except lie down upon the
sand and sleep with the wail of the night air between the cliff
for lullabi
the night pass somehow it seem so long that i began to think or
dream that i must be dead and wait for my next incarn and
when occasion i half woke up wa onli reassur by hear han
at my side mutter prayer in hi sleep to my old father of which
the substanc wa that he should be provid with a halfgallon bottl
of gin at last a star that shone in the black riband far abov
vanish and the riband turn blue or rather grei which show
that it wa dawn we rose and stumbl into the cano for it wa
imposs to see where to place our feet and start within a few
hundr yard of our sleep place suddenli the cliff that hem in
the river widen out so that now thei rose at a distanc of a mile
or more from either bank of flat waterlevel land
these bank which here were steep were cloth with great dark
colour spread tree of which the bough project far over the
water and cut off the light almost as much as the precipic had done
lower down the stream thu we travel in gloom especi as the
sun wa not yet up present through thi gloom to which my train
ey had grown accustom i thought that i caught sight of tall
darkhu figur move between the tree sometim these figur
seem to stand upright and walk upon their feet and sometim to run
swiftli upon all four
look han i whisperedeveryon whisper in that placether
ar baboon
baboon baa he answer were ever baboon such a size no thei
ar devil
now from behind me issicor also whisper
thei ar the hairi men who dwell in the forest lord be silent i
prai you lest thei should attack us
then he began to consult with the rower in low tone appar as
to whether we should go on or turn back final we went on paddl
at a doubl pace a moment later a sound aros in that dim forest a
sound of indescrib weird that wa half an anim grunt and
half a human cry which to my ear shape itself into the syllabl
heuheu in an instant it wa taken up upon all side and from
everywher came thi wail of heuheu which wa so horrid to hear
that my hair stood up even straighter than usual listen to it i
understood whenc came the name of the god i had travel so far to
visit
nor wa thi all for there follow heavi splash in the water like
to those made by plung crocodil and in the deep shadow beneath
the spread tree i saw hideou head swim toward us
the hairi folk have smelt us whisper issicor again in a voic
that i thought perturb do noth lord thei ar veri curiou
perhap when thei have look thei will go awai
and if thei dont i askeda question to which he return no
answer
the cano wa steer over toward the left bank and driven forward at
great speed with all the strength of the rower now in the space of
open water upon which the light began to shine more strongli i saw a
beastlik beard head that yet undoubtedli wa human yellowei
thicklip with strong gleam teeth come toward us at the
speed of a veri strong swimmer for it had enter the water abov us
and wa travel downstream it reach us lift up a power arm
that wa complet cover with brown hair like to that of a monkei
caught hold of the gunwal of the boat just opposit to where i sat
and rear it shoulder out of the water therebi show me that it
great bodi wa for the most part also cover with long hair
now it other hand wa also on the gunwal and it stood in the water
rest on it arm the hideou head so close to me that it stink
breath blew into my face ye there it stood and jabber at me i
confess that i wa terrifi who never befor had seen a creatur like
thi still for a while i sat quiet
then of a sudden i felt that i could bear no more who believ that
the brute wa about to get into the boat or perhap to drag me out of
it i lost control of myself and draw my heavi huntingknifeth
on you see on the wall there friendsi struck at the hand that wa
nearest the blow fell upon the finger and cut on of them right off
so that it fell into the cano with an appal yell the man or
beast let go and plung into the water where i saw him wave hi
bleed hand abov hi head
issicor began to sai someth to me in frighten tone but just
then han ejacul
allemaght here anoth and a second huge head and bodi
rear itself up thi time on hi side
do noth i heard issicor exclaim but the appear of the
creatur wa too much for han who drew hi revolv and fire two
shot in rapid success into it bodi it also tumbl back into the
water where it began to wallow scream but in a thinner voic i
thought and rightli that it must be femal
befor the echo of the shot had di awai there rose anoth hideou
choru of heuheu and other cri all of them savag and terribl
from both bank more of the creatur precipit themselv into the
water but luckili not to attack us becaus thei were too much
occupi with the plight of their companion thei congreg round
her and drag her to the shore ye i saw them lift the bodi out of
the stream for by thi time i wa sure from it hang arm and leg
that it wa dead an act which show me that although thei had the
shape and the cover of beast in fact thei were human
eleph will do as much interrupt curti
ye said allan that is true sometim thei will i have seen it
twice but everyth about the behaviour of those hairi men wa
human for instanc their wail over the dead which wa dread
and remind me of the tale of banshe moreov i had not far to
look for proof at my feet lai the finger that i had cut off it wa a
human finger onli veri thick short and cover with hair have
the nail worn down too doubtless in climb tree and grub for
root
even then with a shock i realiz that i had stumbl on the miss
link or someth that resembl it veri strongli here in thi
unknown spot still surviv a peopl such as were our forefath
hundr of thousand or million of year ago also i reflect that
i ought to be proud for i had made a great discoveri although to
tell the truth just then i should have been quit will to resign
it glori to someon els
after thi i began to reflect upon other thing for a larg jag
stone whizz within an inch of my head and present wa follow by
a rude arrow tip with fish bone that stuck in the side of the
cano
amidst a shower of these missil which fortun beyond a bruis
or two did us no harm we head out into midstream again where thei
could not reach us and as no more of the hairi peopl swam from the
bank to cut us off soon were pursu our wai in peac for onc
howev the imperturb issicor wa much disturb he came
forward and sat by me and said
a veri evil thing ha happen lord you have declar war upon the
hairi men and the hairi men never forget it will be war to the end
i cant help it i answer feebli for i wa sick with the sight
and sound of those creatur ar there mani of them and ar thei
all over your countri
a good mani perhap a thousand or more lord but thei onli live in
the forest you must never go into the forest lord at ani rate not
alon or on to the island where heuheu live for he is their king
and keep some of them about him
i have no present intent of do so i answer
now as we went the cliff reced farther and farther from the
river till at length thei ceas altogeth we were through the lip
of the mountain if i mai so call it and had enter a stretch of
unbroken virgin forest a verit sea of great tree that occupi
the rich land of the plain and grew to an enorm size and tall
moreov befor us appear clearli the cone of the volcano broad
but of no great height over which hung the mushroomshap cloud of
smoke
all dai long we travel up thi tranquil river rejoic in the
compar bright in it centr although of cours the tree
upon either edg overhung it much
late in the afternoon a bend of the bank brought us within sight of a
great sheet of water from which appar the river issu although
as i learn afterward it flow into it upon the other side from i
know not whenc thi lakefor it wa a big lake mani mile in
circumferencesurround an island of consider size in the
centr of which rose the volcano now a mere greyhu mountain that
look quit harmless although over it hung that omin cloud of
smoke which oddli enough on could not see issu from it crest i
suppos that it must have gone up in steam and condens into smoke
abov at the foot of the mountain upon a plain between it and the
lake with the help of my glass i could see what look like
build of some size construct of black stone or lava
thei ar ruin said issicor who had observ that i wa examin
them onc the great citi of my forefath stood yonder until the
fire from the mountain destroi it
then doe nobodi live on the island now i ask
the priest of heuheu live there lord also heuheu himself live
there in a great cave upon the farther side of the mountain or so it
is said for none of us ha ever visit that cave and with him some
of the hairi peopl who ar hi servant my grandfath did so
howev and saw him there inde as i have told you onc i saw him
myself but what he look like you must not ask me lord for i do
not rememb he ad hastili in front of the cave is hi garden
where grow the magic tree of which the master of spirit yonder in
the south desir leav to mix with hi medicin the tree that
give dream with long life and vision
doe heuheu eat of thi tree i ask
i do not know but i know that he eat the flesh of beast becaus
of these we must make offer to him and sometim of men or so it
is said near the foot of the garden burn the etern fire and
between them is the rock upon which the offer ar made
now i thought to myself i should much like to see thi place of which
it wa evid that issicor knew or would tell veri littl where
there wa a great cave in which dwelt a reput demon with hi slave
and hieroph and where too grew a tree suppos to be magic
flank by etern fire what were these etern fire i wonder i
could onli suppos that thei had someth to do with the volcano
as it happen howev whilst i wa prepar to question issicor
upon the subject we pass round a treeclad headland for here the
river had widen into a kind of estuari and on the shore of the bai
beyond it discov a town of consider size cover sever
hundr acr of ground the hous of thi town most of which stood
in their own garden though some of the smaller on were arrang in
street had an eastern appear inasmuch as thei were low and
flatroof
onli there wa thi differ eastern hous of the primit sort
as a rule ar whitewash but these were all black be built of
lava as i discov afterward all round the town also except on
the lake side ran a high wall likewis of black stone the presenc
of which excit my curios and caus me to inquir it object
it is to defend us from the hairi folk who attack by night answer
issicor in the daylight thei never come and therefor our field
beyond ar not wall and he point to a great stretch of
cultiv land that i suppos had been clear of tree which
extend for mile into the surround forest
then he went on to explain that thei labour there while the sun wa
up and at nightfal return to the town except certain of them who
slept in fort or blockhous to guard the crop and cattl kraal
now i look at thi place and thought to myself that never in my life
had i seen on more gloomi especi in the late afternoon under a
sullen rainladen sky the black hous the high black wall that
remind me of a prison the black water of the lake the outlook on
to the black volcano and the black mass of the forest behind all
contribut to thi effect
oh baa if i live here i should soon go mad said han and upon
my word i agre with him
now we paddl toward the shore and present ran alongsid a littl
jetti form of stone loos thrown togeth on which we land
evid our approach had been observ for a number of peopl
forti or fifti of them perhapswer collect at the shore end of
the jetti await us a glanc show me that although of vari
ag and both sex in type thei all resembl our guid issicor
that is to sai thei were tall wellshap lightcolour and
extrem handsom also cloth in white robe while some of the men
wore hat of the pharaon type that i have describ the women
headdress howev consist of a closefit linen cap with
lappet hang down on either side and wa extraordinarili becom
to their sever cast of beauti from what race could thi peopl have
sprung i wonder i had not the faintest idea to me thei look
like the surviv of some ancient civil
conduct by issicor we advanc carri our scanti baggag a
forlorn and batter littl compani as we drew near the crowd
separ into two line men to the right and women to the left like
the congreg in a veri high church and stood quit silent
watch us intent with their larg melancholi ey never a word
did thei sai as we pass between them onli watch and watch till
i felt quit nervou thei did not even offer ani greet to
issicor although it seem to me that he had earn on after hi
long and danger journei
i observ howev although at the time i took littl notic of the
matter and afterward forgot all about it until han brought the
circumst back to my mind that a certain dark man of auster
counten cloth rather differ from the rest approach
issicor address him and thrust someth into hi hand issicor
glanc at thi object whatev it might be and distinctli i saw him
trembl and turn pale then he hid it awai sai noth
turn to the right we march along a roadwai that border the
lake which wa construct about twelv feet abov it level perhap
to serv as a protect against inund till we came to a wall in
which wa a door built of solid balk of wood thi door open as we
approach and pass it we found ourselv in a larg garden
cultiv with tast and refin for in it were bed of flower
the onli cheer thing i ever saw in thi town that it appear wa
name walloo after the tribe or it ruler at the end of the garden
stood a long solid flatroof hous built of the prevail lava
rock
enter we found ourselv in a spaciou room which as dusk wa
gather wa lit with cressetlik lamp of eleg shape place
upon pedest cut from great tusk of ivori
in the centr of thi room were two larg chair made of eboni and
ivori with high back and footstool and in these chair sat a man
and a woman who were well worth see the man wa old for hi
silver hair hung down upon hi shoulder and hi fine sad face wa
deepli wrinkl
at a glanc i saw that he must be the king or chief becaus of hi
dignifi if somewhat senil appear moreov hi robe with
their purpl border had a royal look and about hi neck he wore a
heavi chain of what seem to be gold while in hi hand wa a black
staff tip with gold no doubt hi sceptr for the rest hi ey
had a rather frighten air and hi whole aspect gave an idea of
weak and indecis
the woman sat in the other chair with the light from on of the lamp
shine full upon her and i knew at onc that she must be the ladi
sabeela the love of issicor no wonder that he love her for she
wa beauti exceedingli tall well develop straight as a reed
greatei with chisel featur that were yet round and womanli
and wonderfulli small hand and feet she too wore purplebord
robe about her waist hung a girdl thickli sewn with red stone that
i took to be rubi and upon her shape head serv as a fillet
for her abund hair which flow down her in long wave strand of
a rich and ruddi hue of brown or chestnut wa a simpl golden band
except for a red flower on her breast she wore no other ornament
perhap becaus she knew that none wa need
leav us by the door of the chamber issicor advanc and knelt
befor the old man who first touch him with hi staff and then laid
a hand upon hi head present he rose went to the ladi and knelt
befor her also whereon she stretch out her finger for him to
kiss while a look of sudden hope and joi which even at that distanc
i could distinguish gather on her face he whisper to her for a
while then turn and began to speak earnestli to her father at
length he cross the room came to me and led me forward follow by
han at my heel
o lord macumazahn he said here sit the walloo the princ of my
peopl and hi daughter the ladi sabeela o princ my cousin thi
is the white nobl famou for hi skill and courag whom the wizard
of the south made known to me and who at my prayer out of the
good of hi heart ha come to help us in our peril
i thank him said the walloo in the same dialect of arab that wa
us by issicor i thank him in my own name in that of my daughter
who now alon is left to me and in the name of my peopl
here he rose from hi seat and bow to me with a strang and foreign
courtesi such as i had not known in africa while the ladi also rose
and bow or rather curtsei seat himself again he said
without doubt you ar weari and would rest and eat after which
perchanc we mai talk
then we were led awai through a door at the end of the great room into
anoth room that evid had been prepar for me also there wa a
place beyond for han a kind of alcov here water which i notic
had been warmedan unusu thing in africawa brought in a larg
earthenwar vessel by two quiet women of middl ag and with it an
undershirt of beauti fine linen which wa laid upon a bed or
cushion couch that wa arrang upon the floor and cover by fur
rug
i wash myself pour the warm water into a stone basin that wa
set upon a stand and put on the shirt also the chang of cloth
that i had with me and with the help of han and a pair of pocket
scissor trim my beard and hair scarc had i finish when the
women reappear bring food on wooden plattersroast lamb it
seem to beand with it drink in jar of earthenwar that were of
eleg shape and powder all over with the littl rough diamond of
which zikali had given me specimen that evid had been set in it
in pattern befor the clai dri thi drink by the wai wa a kind
of nativ beer sweet to the tast but pleasant and rather strong so
that i had to be care lest han should take too much of it
after we had finish our meal which wa veri welcom for we had
eaten no properli cook food sinc we left the wagon issicor
arriv and took us back to the larg room where we found the walloo
and hi daughter seat as befor with sever old men squat
about them on the ground a stool have been set for me the talk
began
i need not enter into all it detail sinc in substanc thei set out
what i had alreadi heard from issicor name that there dwelt
someth or somebodi on the island in the lake who requir annual
the sacrific of a beauti virgin thi wa demand through the
head priest of a colleg also establish on the island which
acknowledg the be real or imaginari that live there as it god
or fetish further that creatur if he exist wa said to be the
king of all the hairi folk who inhabit the forest lastli there wa
a legend that he wa the reincarn of some ancient monarch of the
walloo folk who had come to a bad end at the hand of hi indign
subject at some date undefin walloo it seem wa their correct
name that of heuheua appli onli to the hairi men of the wood
thi stori i dismiss at onc be quit convinc that it wa onli
a variant of a veri common african fabl doubtless heuheu if there
realli were a heuheu wa the ruler of the savag hairi aborigin
of the place that onc in the far past had been conquer by the
invad walloo who pour into the countri from the north or west
be themselv the survivor of some civil but forgotten peopl
thi conclus i mai add i never found ani reason to doubt africa
is a veri ancient land and in it onc live mani race that have
vanish or surviv onli in a debas condit dwindl from
gener to gener until the dai of their extinct come
here i mai state briefli the final opinion at which i have arriv
about thi peopl
almost certainli these walloo were such a dy race hail as
name among them seem to suggest from some region in west africa
where their forefath had been highli civil thu although thei
could not write thei had tradit of write and even inscript
graven upon stone of which i saw sever in a charact that i did
not know though to me it had the look of egyptian hieroglyph also
thei still had knowledg of certain cultur art such as the weav
of fine linen the carv of wood and marbl the make of potteri
and the smelt of metal with which their land abound includ
gold that thei found in littl nugget in the gravel of the stream
most of these craft howev were dy out except those that were
necessari to life such as the mould of potteri and the build of
hous and wall and particularli agricultur in which thei were
veri profici when i saw them all the higher art were practis
onli by the veri old men as thei never intermarri with ani other
blood their hereditari beauti which wa truli remark remain
to them but ow to the caus i have mention alreadi the stock
wa dwindl the total popul be now not more than half of
what it wa within the memori of the father of their oldest men
their melancholi which now had becom constitut doubtless wa
induc by their gloomi surround and the knowledg that as a race
thei were doom to perish at the hand of the savag aborigin who
onc had been their slave
lastli although thei retain trace of some higher religion sinc
thei made prayer to a great spirit thei were fetishridden and
believ that thei could continu to exist onli by make sacrific to
a devil who if thei neglect to do so would crush them with
misfortun and give them over to destruct at the hand of the
dread forestdwel therefor thei or a section of them becam
the priest of thi devil call heuheu and therebi kept peac
between them and the hairi men
nor wa thi the end of their troubl sinc as issicor had told
me these priest after the fashion of priest all the world over
now aspir to the absolut rule of the race and for thi reason
plot the extinct of the hereditari chief and all hi famili
such in substanc wa the lugubri stori that the unhappi walloo
pour into my ear that night end it in these word
now you will understand o lord macumazahn why in our extrem and
in obedi to the ancient propheci which ha come down to us from
our father we commun with the great wizard of the south with
whom we had been in touch in ancient dai prai him to send us the
helper of the propheci behold he ha sent you and now i implor you
to save my daughter from the fate that await her i understand that
you will requir payment in white and red stone also in gold and
ivori take as much as you want of the stone there ar jar full
hidden awai and the fenc of some of my courtyard at the back of
thi hous ar made of tusk of ivori though it is black with ag
and i know not how you would carri it henc also there is a quantiti
of gold melt into bar which my grandfath caus to be collect
whereof we make littl us except now and again for women ornament
but that too would be heavi to carri across the desert still it is
all your take it take everyth you wish onli save my daughter
we will talk of the reward afterward i said for my heart wa
touch at the sight of the old man grief meanwhil let me hear
what can be done
lord i do not know he answer wring hi hand the third
night from thi is that of full moon the full moon which mark the
begin of harvest on that night we must carri my daughter on whom
the lot ha fallen to the island in the lake where stand the smoke
mountain and bind her to the pillar upon the rock of offer that is
set between the two undi fire there we must leav her and at the
dawn so it is said heuheu himself seiz her and carri her into
hi cavern where she vanish for ever or if he doe not come hi
priest do to drag her to the god and we see her no more
then why do you take her to the island why do you not call your
peopl togeth and fight and kill thi god or hi priest
lord becaus not on man among us save perhap issicor yonder who
can do noth alon would lift a hand to save her thei believ that
if thei did the mountain would break into flame as happen in the
bygon ag turn all upon whom the ash fell into stone also
that the water would rise and destroi the crop so that we must die
of starvat and that ani who escap the fire and the water and the
want would perish at the hand of the cruel wooddevil therefor if
i ask the walloo to save the maiden from heuheu thei will kill me
and give her up in accord with the law
i understand i said and wa silent
lord went on the old walloo present here with me you ar safe
for none of my peopl will harm you or those with you but i learn
from issicor that you have stab a hairi man with a knife and that
your servant slew on of their women with the strang weapon that you
carri therefor from the wooddevil you ar not safe for if thei
can thei will kill you both and feast upon your bodi
that cheer i thought to myself but made no further answer
for i did not know what to sai
just then the walloo rose from hi chair sai that he must go to
prai to the spirit of hi ancestor to help him but that we would
talk again upon the morrow after thi he bade us goodnight and
depart without anoth word follow by the old men who all thi
while had sat silent onli nod their head from time to time like
porcelain imag of chines mandarin
chapter viii
the holi isl
when the door had close behind him i turn to issicor and ask
him straight out if he had ani plan to suggest he shook hi nobl
look head and answer none as it wa imposs to resist both
the will of the peopl and the law of the priest
then what is the us of your have brought me all thi wai i
inquir with indign cannot you think of some scheme for
instanc would it not be possibl for you and thi ladi to fly with
us down the river and escap to a land which is not full of demon
it would not be possibl he answer in a melancholi voic dai
and night we ar watch and would be seiz befor we had travel a
mile moreov could she leav her father and could i leav all my
relat to be murder in payment for our sacrileg
have you no thought in your mind at all i ask again is there
noth that would save the ladi sabeela
noth lord except the end of heuheu and hi priest it is to
you great lord that we look to find a wai to destroi them as the
propheci declar will be done by the white deliver from the south
oh dash the propheci i never knew propheci to help anybodi yet
i ejacul in english as i contempl that beauti but helpless
pair then i ad in arab i am tire and am go to bed i hope
that i shall find more wisdom in my dream than i do in you
issicor i ad stare at the man in whom i seem to detect some
subtl chang some access of fatalist helpless even of
despair
now sabeela see that i wa angri broke in
o lord be not wrath for we ar but fli in the spider web and
the thread of that web ar the priest of heuheu and the post to
which it is fix ar the belief of my peopl and heuheu himself is
the spider and in my breast hi claw ar fix
now listen to her allegori i thought to myself that a better on
might have been drawn from a snake and a bird for realli like the
rest of them thi poor girl seem to be mesmer with terror and
to have made up her mind to sit still wait to be struck by the
poison fang
lord she went on we have done all we could did not issicor make
a great journei to find you ye did he not even dare the curs which
fall upon the head of those who try to leav our countri and travel
south to seek the counsel of the great wizard who onc sent
messeng here to obtain the leav of the tree that grow in heu
heu garden the tree that make men drunk and give them vision
ye i answer he did that ladi and might i sai to you that hi
health seem none the wors those curs of which you speak have not
yet hurt him
it is true thei have not hurt hi bodyyet she said in a muse
voic as though a new thought had struck her
well if that is true sabeela mai it not be true also that all thi
talk about the power of heuheu is nonsens tell me have you ever
spoken with or seen heuheu
no lord no though unless you can save me i shall soon see him
well and ha ani on els
no lord no on ha ever spoken with him except of cours hi
priest such as my distant cousin dacha who is the head of them
but whom i us to know befor he wa chosen by heuheu to be on of
their compani
oh so no on ha seen him then he must be a veri secret kind of god
who doe not take exercis but live i understand in a cave with
priest
i did not sai that no on had ever seen heuheu lord mani sai that
thei have seen him as issicor ha done when he came out of the cave
on a night of offer but of what thei saw it is death to speak ask
me and issicor no more of heuheu lord i prai you lest the curs
should fall it is not law that we should tell you of him whose
secret ar sacr even to hi priest she ad with agit
then in despair i gave up ask question about heuheu and inquir
how mani priest he had
about twenti i believ lord she answer ceas from evas
not count their wive and famili and it is said that thei do
not live with heuheu in the cave but in hous outsid of it
and what do thei do when thei ar not worship heuheu sabeela
oh thei cultiv the land and thei rule the wild peopl of the
wood who it is believ ar all heuheu children also thei come
here and spy on us
do thei inde i remark and is it true that thei hope to rule
over you walloo also
ye i believ that it is true at least should my father die and i
die it is said that dacha mean to make war upon the walloo and take
the chieftainship set asid or kill my cousin and betroth
issicor for dacha wa alwai on who desir to be first
so you us to know dacha pretti well ladi
ye lord when i wa quit young befor he becam a priest also
she ad colour i have seen him sinc he becam a priest
and what did he sai to you
he said that if i would take him for a husband perhap i should
escap from heuheu
and what did you answer ladi
lord i answer that i would rather go to heuheu
why
becaus dacha it is report ha mani wive alreadi also i hate
him also from heuheu at the last i can alwai escap
how
by death lord we have swift poison in thi countri and i carri
some of it hidden in my hair she ad with emphasi
quit so i understand but ladi sabeela as you have been so good
as to ask my advic about these matter i will give you some it is
that you should not tast that poison till all els ha fail and
there is no escap while we breath there is hope and all that
seem lost still mai be won but the dead do not live again ladi
sabeela
i hear and will obei you lord she answer weep yet sleep is
better than dacha or heuheu
and life is better than all three of them put togeth i repli
especi life with love
then i bow myself off to bed follow by han also bowinglik a
monkei for penni on a barrelorgan at the door i look back and
saw these two poor peopl in each other arm think doubtless
that we were alreadi out of sight of them ye her head wa upon
issicor shoulder and from the convuls motion of her form i
guess that she wa sob while he tri to consol her in the
ancient worldwid fashion i onli hope that she got more comfort
from issicor than i did to me he now seem to be but a singularli
unresourc member of a playedout race though it is true that he
had courag sinc otherwis he would not have attempt the journei
to zululand also as i have said quit suddenli he had chang in
some subtl fashion
when we were in our own room with the door bolt it had no window
light and ventil be provid by hole in the roof i gave han
some tobacco and bade him sit down on the other side of the lamp
where he squat upon the floor like a toad
now han i said tell me all the truth of thi busi and what
we ar to do to help thi pretti ladi and the old chief her father
han look at the roof and look at the wall then he spat upon the
floor for which i reprov him
baa he said at length i think the best thing we can do is to
find out where those bright stone ar fill our pocket with them
and escap from thi countri which is full of fool and devil i am
sure that beauti on would be better off with the priest dacha or
even with heuheu than with issicor who now ha becom but a carv
and paint lump of wood made to look like a man
possibl han but the tast of women ar curiou and she like
thi lump of wood who after all is brave except where ghost and
spirit ar concern otherwis he would not have journei so far
for her sake moreov we have a bargain to keep what should we sai
to the openerofroad if we return have run awai and without hi
medicin no han we must plai out thi game
ye baa i thought that the baa would sai that becaus of hi
foolish had i been alon by now or a littl later i should
have been in that cano go downstream howev the baa ha
settl that we must save the ladi and give her to the lump of wood
for a wife so now i think i will go to sleep and tomorrow or the
next dai the baa can save her i dont think veri much of the beer in
thi countri baasit is too sweet and all these handsom fool who
talk about devil and priest weari me also it is a bad climat and
veri damp i think it is go to rain again baa
have noth els at hand i threw my tobaccopouch at hanss head
he caught it deftli and in an absentmind fashion put it into hi
own pocket
if the baa realli wish to know what i think he said yawn
it is that the medicin man name dacha want the pretti ladi for
himself also to rule alon over all these dull peopl as for heu
heu i dont know anyth about him but perhap he is on of those
hairi men who came here at the begin of the world i think that
the best thing we can do baa would be to take a boat tomorrow
morn and go to that island where we can find out the truth for
ourselv perhap the lump of wood and some of hi men can row us
there and now i have noth more to sai so if the baa doe not
mind i will go to sleep keep your pistol readi baa in case ani of
the hairi peopl wish to call upon usjust to talk about the on i
shot
then he retir to a corner roll himself up in a skin rug and
present wa snore though as i knew well enough with on ey
open all the time no hairi man or ani on els would have come near
that place without han hear him for hi sleep wa like to that of
a dog who watch hi master
as i prepar to follow hi exampl i reflect that hi remark
casual as thei seem were full of wisdom these folk were
superstitionriddl fool and useless probabl the onli on that
had wit among them becam priest but the hairi aborigin were an
ugli fact as the priest knew sinc appar thei had obtain
rule over them for the rest the onli thing to do wa to visit the
holi island and find out the truth for ourselv as han had said it
would be danger no doubt but at the least it would also be
excit
next morn i rose after an excel night rest and found my wai
into the garden where i amus myself by examin the shrub and
flower some of which were strang to me also i studi the sky
which wa heavi and lower and seem full of rain i could studi
noth els becaus the high wall cut off the view upon everi side so
that littl wa to be seen except the top of the volcano which rose
from the lake at a distanc of sever mile for it wa a larg sheet
of water present the door of the garden open and issicor
appear look weari and somewhat bewild it occur to me
that he had been sit up late with sabeela as thei were to be
part so soon natur thei would see as much as thei could of each
other or for aught i knew he might have been prai to hi
ancestr spirit and try to make up hi mind what to do no doubt
a difficult process under the circumst i went to the point at
onc
issicor i said as soon as possibl after breakfast will you
have a cano readi to take me and han to the island in the lake
to the island in the lake lord he exclaim amaz why it is
holi
i daresai but i am holi also so that if i go there it will be
holier
then he advanc all kind of object and even brought out the
walloo and hi greyhead to reinforc hi argument han and sabeela
also join the parti the latter i note look even more
beauti by dai than she did in the lamplight sabeela inde
prove my onli alli for present when the other had talk
themselv hoars she said
the white lord ha been brought hither that we who ar bewild
and foolish mai drink of the cup of hi wisdom if hi wisdom bid
him visit the holi isl let him do so my father
as no on seem to be convinc i stood silent not know what
more to sai then han took up hi parabl speak in hi bad coast
arab
baa issicor although he is so big and strong and all these
other ar afraid of heuheu and hi priest but we who ar good
christian ar not afraid of ani devil becaus we know how to deal
with them also we can paddl therefor let the chief give us quit a
small cano and show us which wai to row and we will go to the island
by ourselv
in sport parlanc thi shot hit the bull in the ey and issicor
who as i have said wa a brave man at bottom fire up and answer
am i a coward that i should listen to such word from your servant
lord macumazahn i and some other whom i can find will row you to the
island though on it we will not set our foot becaus it is not law
for us to do so onli lord if you come back no more blame me not
then that is settl i repli quietli and now if we mai let us
eat for i am hungri
about two hour later we start from the quai take with us all our
small possess down to some spare powder in flask which we had
brought to reload fire cartridg case for han refus to leav
anyth behind with no on to watch it the cano which wa given to
us wa much smaller than that in which we had come up the river
though like it hollow from a singl log and it crew consist of
issicor who steer and four other walloo who paddl stout and
determinedlook fellow all of them the island wa about five
mile awai but we made a wide circuit to the south i suppos in the
hope of avoid observ and therefor it took us the best part
of two hour to reach it southern shore
as we approach i examin the place carefulli through my glass
and observ that it wa much larger than i had thoughtsever mile
in circumfer inde for in addit to the central volcan cone
there wa a great stretch of lowli land all round it base which
land seem not to rise more than a foot or two abov the level of the
lake in charact except on these flat by the lake it wa stoni
and barren be in fact strewn with lump of lava eject from the
volcano dure the last erupt
issicor inform me howev that the northern part of the island
where the priest live which had not been touch by the lava
stream wa veri fertil i should add that the crater of the volcano
seem to bear out hi statement as to the direct of the flow
sinc on the south it wa blown awai to a great depth wherea the
northern segment rose in a high and perfect wall of rock
the dai wa veri mistya circumst which favour our approach
and the sky which as i have said wa black and pregnant with come
rain seem almost to touch the crest of the mountain these
condit until we were quit close prevent us from see that a
stream of glow lava not veri broad wa pour down the mountain
side when thei discov thi the walloo grew much alarm and
issicor told me that such a thing had not been known for a hundr
year and that he thought it portend someth unusu as the
mountain wa suppos to be asleep
it is awak enough to smoke anywai i answer and continu my
examin
among the stone and sometim halfburi by them i saw what
appear to be the remain of those build of which i have spoken
there issicor said had onc been part of the citi of hi
forefath ad that as he had been told in some of them the
said forefath were still to be seen turn to stone which you
will rememb exactli bore out zikali stori
anyth more desol and depress than the aspect of thi place
seen on that grei dai and beneath the brood sky cannot be imagin
still i burn to examin it for thi tale of fossil peopl
excit me who have alwai love the remain of antiqu and strang
sight
forget all about heuheu and hi priest for the moment i told
the walloo to paddl to the shore and after a moment of mute
protest thei obei run into a littl bai han and i step
easili on to the rock and carri our bag and rifl start on
our search first howev we arrang with issicor that he should
await our return and then row us back round the island so that we
might have a view of the priest settlement with a sigh he promis
to do so and at onc paddl out to about a hundr yard from the
shore where the cano wa anchor by mean of a pierc stone ti
to a cord
off went han and i toward the nearest group of ruin as we
approach them han said
look out baa there a dog between those rock
i stare at the spot he indic and there sure enough saw a larg
grei dog with a point muzzl which seem to be fast asleep we
drew nearer and as it did not stir han threw a stone and hit it on
the back still it did not stir so we went up and examin it
it is a stone dog i said the peopl who live here must have made
statu for as yet i did not believ the stori i had heard about
petrifi creatur which after all must be veri legendari
if so baa thei put bone into their carv look and he
touch on of the dog front paw which wa broken off there in
the middl of it appear the bone fossil then i understood
the anim had been flee awai to the shore when the poison gase
overcam it at the time of the erupt after thi i suppos some
rain of petrifi fluid had fallen on it and turn it into stone it
wa a marvel thing but i could not doubt the evid of my own
ey all the tale wa true and i had made a great discoveri
we hurri on to the hous which of cours now were roofless and
in some instanc choke with lava though the outer wall be
strongli built of rock still stood on certain of these wall were
the faint remain of fresco on of peopl sit at a feast
anoth of a hunt scene and so forth
we pass on to a second group of build stand at some distanc
against the flank of the mountain and more or less protect by an
overhang ledg or shelf of stone these appear to have been a
palac or a templ for thei were larg with stone column that
support the roof we went on through the great hall to the room
behind and in the furthermost which wa under the ledg of rock and
probabl had been us as a store chamber we saw an extraordinari
sight
there huddl togeth and in some instanc clasp each other
were a number of peopl twenti or thirti of themmen women and
childrenal turn to stone doubtless the petrifi fluid had
flow into the chamber through the crack in the rock abov and done
it offic on them thei were nake everi on which suggest that
their cloth had either been burnt off them or had rot awai
befor the process wa complet the former hypothesi seem to be
born out by the fact that none of them had ani hair left upon their
head the featur were not easi to distinguish but the gener type
of the bodi wa certainli veri similar to that of the walloo
speechless with amaz we emerg from that death chamber and
wander about the place here and there we found the bodi of other
who had perish in the great catastroph and onc came across an arm
project from a mass of lava which seem to show that mani more
were buri underneath also we found a number of fossil goat in
a kraal what a place to dig in i thought to myself given some
spade pick and blastingpowd what might on not find in these
ruin
all the relic of a past civil perhapsit inscript it
jewelleri the statu of it god even perhap it domest
furnitur buri beneath the lava and the dust though probabl thi
had rot here certainli wa anoth pompeii and perhap beneath
that anoth herculaneum
whilst i muse thu over glori pass awai and wonder when thei
had pass han dug me in the rib and in hi horribl boer dutch
ejacul a singl word kek which as perhap you know mean
look at the same time nod toward the lake
i did look and saw our cano paddl off for all it wa worth go
hell for leather as my old father us to sai toward the walloo
shore
now why is it do that i ask
i expect becaus someth is behind it baa he repli with
resign then sat down on a rock pull out hi pipe fill it
and lit a match
as usual han wa right for present from round the curv of the
island there appear two other cano veri larg cano row
after our with great energi and determin and as i guess
with malign intent
i think those priest have seen our boat and mean to catch it if
thei can remark han spit reflect though as issicor
ha got a long start perhap thei wont and now baa what ar we
to do we cant live here with dead men and stone goat is not good to
eat
i consid the situat and my heart sank into my boot for the
posit seem desper a moment befor i had been fill with
enthusiasm over thi ruin citi and it fossil remain now i
hate the veri thought of them and wish that thei were at the
bottom of the lake thu do circumst alter case and our poor
variabl human mood then an idea came to me and i said boldli
do why there is onli on thing to do we must go to call on heu
heu or hi priest
ye baa but the baa rememb the pictur in the cave on the
berg if it is a true pictur heuheu know how to twist off men
head
i dont believ there is a heuheu i said stoutli you will have
notic han that we have heard all sort of stori about heuheu
but that no on seem to have seen him clearli enough to give us an
accur descript of what he is like or what he doesnot even
zikali he show us a pictur of the beast on hi fire but after all
it wa onli what we had seen on the wall of the cave and i think that
he got it out of our own mind at ani rate it is just as well to die
quickli without a head as slowli with an empti stomach sinc i am
sure those walloo will never come back to look for us
ye baa i think so too issicor us to have courag but he
seem to have chang as though someth had happen to him sinc
he got back into hi own countri and now if the baa is readi i
think we had better be trek unless inde he would like to look
at a few more stone men first it is begin to rain baa and we
have been much longer here than the baa think sinc it is a slow
busi crawl about these old hous therefor if we ar to get
to the other side of the island befor nightfal it is time to go
so off we went keep to the western side of the volcano sinc
there it did not seem to project so far into the flat land a while
later we turn round and look at the lake there in the far
distanc our cano appear a mere speck with two other speck those
of the pursuer close upon it heel as we watch out of the mist
on the walloo shore came yet other speck which were doubtless walloo
boat paddl to the rescu for the priest cano gave up the
chase and turn homeward
issicor will have a veri nice stori to tell to the ladi sabeela
said han but perhap she will not kiss him after she ha heard it
he wa quit wise to go what good could he have done by stai i
answer as we trudg on ad still you ar right han
issicor ha chang
it wa a hard walk over rough ground at least at first for so soon
as we got round the shoulder of the volcano the charact of the
countri alter and we found ourselv in fertil cultiv land
that appear to be irrig
these field must lie veri low baa said han sinc otherwis
how do thei get the lake water on to them
i dont know i repli crossli for i wa think of the sky
water which wa begin to descend in a steadi drizzl upon
ourselv but all the same the remark stuck in my mind and wa
us afterward on we march till at length we enter a grove of
palm tree that wa travers by a road
present we came to the end of the road and found ourselv in a
villag of wellbuilt stone hous with on veri larg hous in the
middl of it of which the back wa set almost against the foot of the
mountain as there wa noth els to be done we walk on into the
villag at first without be observ for everybodi wa under
cover becaus of the rain soon howev dog began to bark and a
woman look out of the doorwai of on of the hous caught sight
of us and scream a minut later men with shaven head and wear
white priestlylook robe appear and ran toward us flourish
big spear
han i said keep your rifl readi but dont shoot unless you ar
oblig in thi case word mai serv us better than bullet
ye baa though i dont believ that either will serv us much
then he sat down on the trunk of a fallen tree that lai by the
roadsid and wait and i follow hi exampl take the
opportun to light my pipe
chapter ix
the feast
when thei were within a few pace of us the men halt appar
astonish at our appear which certainli did not compar
favour with their own for thei were all of the splendid walloo
type evid what astonish them still more wa the match with
which i wa light my pipe and inde the pipe itself for although
these peopl grew tobacco thei onli took it in the form of snuff
that match went out and i struck anoth and at the sight of the
sudden appear of fire thei step back a pace or two at length
on of them point to the burn match ask in the same tongu
that wa us by the walloo
what is that o stranger
magic fire i answer ad by an inspir which i am
bring as a present to the great god heuheu
thi inform seem to mollifi them for lower their spear
thei turn to speak to anoth man who at thi moment arriv upon
the scene he wa a stout finelook man of consider presenc
with a hook nose and flash black ey also he wore a priestli
cap upon hi head and hi white robe were broider
veri big fellow thi baa han whisper to me and i nod
observ as i did so that the other priest bow as thei address
him
dacha in person thought i to myself and sure enough dacha it wa
he advanc and look at the wax match said
where doe the magic fire of which you speak live stranger
in thi case cover with holi secret write i repli hold
befor hi ey a box label wax vesta made in england and
ad solemnli woe be to him that touch it or him that bear it
without understand for it will sure leap forth and consum that
foolish man o dacha
now dacha follow the exampl of hi companion and step back a
littl wai remark
how do you know my name and who send thi present of self
conceiv fire to heuheu
is not the name of dacha known to the end of the earth i askeda
remark which seem to pleas him veri much ye as far as hi
spell can travel which is the sky and back again as to who send
the magic fire it is a great on a wizard of the best if not quit
so good as dacha who is name zikali who is name the openerof
road who is name the thingthatshouldneverhavebeenborn
we have heard of him said dacha hi messeng were here in our
father dai and what doe zikali want of us o stranger
he want leav of a certain tree that grow in heuheu garden
that is call the tree of vision that he mai mix them with hi
medicin
dacha nod and so did the other priest evid thei knew all
about the tree of vision as i or rather zikali had name it
then why did he not come for them himself
becaus he is old and infirm becaus he is detain by great
affair becaus it wa easier for him to send me who be a lover
of that which is holi wa anxiou to do homag to heuheu and to make
the acquaint of the great dacha
i understand the priest repli highli gratifi as hi face
shew but how ar you name o messeng of zikali
i am name blowingwind becaus i pass where i would none see
me come or go and therefor am the best and swiftest of messeng
and thi littl on thi small but greatsoul on with meher i
point to the smirk han who by now wa quit aliv to the
humour of the situat and to it advantag from our point of view
is name lordofthefir and lightindark thi wa true
enough and work in veri well becaus it is he who is guardian of
the magic fire also true for he had half a dozen spare box in hi
pocket that he had stolen at on time or anoth of which if he is
offend he can make enough to burn up all thi island and everyon
thereon ye more than is hidden in the womb of that mountain
can he by heuheu said dacha regard han with great respect
certainli he can mighti though i be i must be care not to anger
him lest myself i should be burnt to cinder
at thi moment a doubt seem to strike dacha for he ask
tell me o blowingwind and o lordoffir how you came to thi
island we observ a cano man with some of our rebelli
subject who serv that old usurp the walloo which is be hunt
that thei mai be kill for the sacrileg in approach thi holi
place were you perchanc in that cano
we were i answer boldli when we arriv at yonder town i met a
ladi a veri beauti ladi name sabeela and ask her where dwelt
the great dacha she said heremor that she knew you and that you
were the most beauti and noblest of men as well as the wisest she
said also that with some of her servant includ a stupid fellow
call issicor of whom she never can be rid wherev she goe she
herself would paddl us to the island on the chanc of see your
face again i mai explain to you fellow that thi lie wa perfectli
safe as i knew issicor and hi peopl had escap so she brought
us here and land us that we might look at the ruin citi befor
come on to see you but then your peopl roughli hunt her awai so
that we were oblig to walk to your town that is all
now dacha becam agit i prai heuheu he said that those
fool mai not have caught and kill her with the other
i prai so also sinc she is too fair to die i answer who would
be a love wife for ani man but stai i will tell you what ha
chanc lordofthefir make fire
han produc a match and lit it on the seat of hi trouser which
wa the onli part of him that wa not damp he held it in hi join
hand and i stare at the flame mutter then he whisper
be quick baa it is burn my finger
all is well i said solemnli the cano with sabeela the beauti
escap your peopl sinc other cano sevenno eight of them i
correct studi the ash of the match also the blister on hanss
finger came out from the town and drove your awai just as thei were
overtak the ladi sabeela
thi wa a most fortun stroke for at that moment a messeng
arriv and gave dacha exactli the same intellig which he
punctuat with mani bow
wonder said the priest wonder here we have magician
inde and he stare at us with much aw then again a doubt struck
him
lord he said heuheu is the ruler of the savag hairi peopl who
live in the wood and ar name heuheua after him now a tale ha
reach us that on of these peopl ha been mysteri kill with
a nois by some stranger had you aught to do with her death lord
ye i answer she annoi the lordofthefir with her
attent so he slew her as wa right and proper i cut off the
finger of anoth who wish to shake hand with me when i had told
him to go awai
but how did he slai her lord
now i mai explain that there wa on inhabit of thi place that
greet us with no cordial at all name a larg and particularli
feroci dog that all thi while had been growl round us and
final had got hold of hanss coat which it held between it teeth
still growl
scheet han scheet seen dood shoot han shoot him dead
i whisper and han who wa alwai quick to catch an idea put hi
hand into hi pocket where he kept hi pistol and press the muzzl
against the brute head fire through the cloth with the result
that thi dog went wherev bad dog go
then there wa constern inde on of the priest fell down
with fear and the other turn tail all of them except dacha who
stood hi ground
a littl of the magic fire i remark airili and there is plenti
more where that came from at the same time as though by accid
slap hanss pocket which i saw wa smoulder and now nobl
dacha it is set in wet and we ar hungri be pleas to give us
shelter and food
certainli lord certainli he exclaim and start off with us
keep me well between himself and han while the other who had
return follow with the dead dog
present recov from hi fear he ask me whether the ladi
sabeela had said anyth more about him
onli on thing i answer that it wa a piti that a maiden should
be oblig to marri a god when there were such men as you in the
world
here i stop and watch the effect of my shot out of the corner of
my ey
hi coars but handsom face grew cun and he smack hi lip
ye lord ye he said hurriedli but who know thing ar not
alwai what thei seem lord and i have note that sometim the
faith servant tith the master offer
by jingo iv got it thought i to myself you my friend ar
heuheu or at ani rate hi busi part but aloud glanc at the
redoubt han i onli remark someth to the effect that dacha
power of observ were keen and that like the lordofthefir
himself as he said truli thing were not alwai what thei seem
we cross a bare platform of rock to the right of which beyond a
space of garden i observ the mouth of a larg cave at the edg of
thi platform a strang sight wa to be seen for here just on the
border of the lake at a distanc of about twenti pace from each
other burn two column of flame which hitherto had been hidden from
us by the lie of the ground and tree between which column wa a
pillar or post of stone
the etern fire thought i to myself and then inquir casual
what thei were
thei ar flame which have alwai burn in that place from the
begin we do not know why dacha repli indiffer no rain
put them out
ah i reflect natur ga come from the volcano such as i
have heard of in canada
then we turn to the right along the outer wall of the garden i have
mention and came to some fine hous that to my fanci had a kind
of collegi appear all onestori and built against the rock
of the mountain as a matter of fact i wa right for these were the
dwell of the priest of heuheu and their numer femal
belong these priest i should sai had their privileg for
wherea the peopl on the mainland for the most part marri onli on
wife thei were polygam the ladi be suppli to them through
spiritu pressur put upon the unfortun walloo or if that
fail by the simpl and ancient expedi of kidnap onc
howev thei had arriv upon the island and thu becam dedic to
the god thei vanish so far as their kinsfolk were concern and
never afterward were thei allow to cross the water or even to
attempt ani commun with them in short those who becam aliv
in heuheu becam also dead to the world
han and i were led to the largest of thi group of hous that
abut immedi on to the garden wall the inhabit of which
appar had alreadi been advis of our come by messeng sinc
we found them in a bustl of prepar thu i saw handsom white
robe women flit about and heard hurri order be given we
were taken to a room where a driftwood fire had been light on the
hearth becaus the night wa damp and chill at which we warm and
dri ourselv after we had wash a while later a priest summon
us to eat and then retir outsid the door await our conveni
han i said all ha gone well so far we ar accept as the
friend of heuheu not as hi enemi
ye baa thank to the clever of the baa about the match and
the rest but what ha the baa in hi mind
thi han that all must continu to go well for rememb what is
our duti name to save the ladi sabeela if we can as we have
sworn to do now if we ar to bring thi about we must keep our ey
open and our wit sharp han i daresai that thei have strang
liquor in thi place which will be offer to us to make us talk but
while we ar here we must drink noth but water do you understand
han
ye baa i understand
and do you swear han
han rub hi middl reflect and repli
my stomach is cold baa and i should like a glass of someth more
warm than water after all thi damp and the sight of those stone
men yet baa i swear ye i swear by your reverend father that i
will onli drink water or coffe if thei make it which of cours
thei dont
that is all right han you know that if you break your oath my
reverend father will certainli come even with you and so shall i in
thi world or the next
ye baa but will the baa pleas rememb that a gin bottl is not
the onli bait that the devil set upon hi hook differ men have
differ tast baa now if some pretti ladi were to come and tell
the baa that he wa oh so beauti and that she love him oh ever
so much someon like that mameena for instanc of whom old zikali
is alwai talk as have been a friend of your will the baa
swear by hi reverend father
ceas from folli and be silent i said majest is thi the
time and place to chatter of pretti women
nevertheless in myself i appreci the shrewd of hanss
reparte and as a matter of fact an attempt wa made to plai off that
trick on me though if i am to get to the end of thi stori i shall
have no time to tell you about it
our compact seal we went through the door and found the priest
wait outsid he led us down a passag into a fine hall plentifulli
lit with lamp for now the night had fallen here sever tabl were
spread but we were taken to on at the head of the hall where we were
welcom by dacha dress in grand robe and some other priest also
by women all of them handsom and beautifulli arrai in their wild
fashion whom i took to be the wive of these worthi on of them i
notic had a singular resembl to the ladi sabeela although she
appear to be her elder by some year
we sat down at the tabl in curiou carv chair and i found myself
between dacha and thi ladi whose name i discov wa dramana
the feast began and i mai sai at onc that it wa a veri fine feast
for it appear that we had arriv upon a dai of festiv inde i
had not eaten such a meal for year
of cours it wa barbar in it wai thu the food wa serv in
great earthenwar dish alreadi cut up there were no knive or
fork the finger of the eater take their place and the plate
consist of the tough green leav of some kind of waterlili that
grew in the lake which were remov after each cours and replac by
fresh on
of it sort howev it wa excel and includ fish of a good
flavour kid cook with spice wild fowl and a kind of pud
made of ground corn and sweeten with honei also there wa plenti
of the strong nativ beer which wa hand round in ornament
earthenwar cup that were howev inlaid not with small diamond
and rubi but with pearl found i wa inform in the shell of
freshwat mussel and set in the clai when damp

but the effect of them thu emploi wa veri pretti still some
attain to a consider size sinc dramana and other women wore
necklac of them bore and strung upon fibr without go into
further detail i mai sai that thi feast and it equip convinc
me more than ever that these peopl had onc belong to some unknown
but highli civil race which wa now dy out in it last home and
sink into barbar befor it di
in pursuanc of our agreement han who squat on a stool behind me
for he would not sit at the tabl and i sai that we were bound by
a vow to touch noth els drank water onli although i heard him
groan each time the beer cup went round i mai add that thi happen
frequent and the amount of liquor consum wa consider as
becam evid by the behaviour of the drinker mani of whom grew
more or less intox with the usual unpleas result that i
need not describ also thei grew affection for thei threw their
arm about the women and began to kiss them in a wai which i
consid improp i observ howev that the ladi call dramana
drank but littl also as she sat between me and an extrem deaf
priest who becam sleepi in hi cup she wa of cours freed from
ani such unwelcom attent
all these circumst and especi the fact that dacha wa much
occupi with a handsom femal on hi left gave dramana and myself
opportun of convers which i think were welcom to her after
a few gener remark present she said in a low voic
i hear lord that you have seen sabeela the daughter of the walloo
chief of the mainland tell me of her for she is my sister on whom i
have not look for a long while for we never visit the mainland and
those who dwell there never visit usunless thei ar oblig she
ad significantli
she is beauti but live in great terror becaus she who desir
to be marri to a man must be marri to a god i answer
she doe well to be afraid lord for by you sit that god and with
a shiver of disgust and the slightest possibl motion of her head she
indic dacha who had becom quit drunken and at the moment wa

ye save me and my sister if you can
i glanc round dacha who had ceas embrac the ladi wa look
at us suspici as though he had caught some word perhap han
thought so as well for he manag to make a great clatter either by
tumbl off hi stool or drop hi drink cup i know not which

littl blowingwind befor you blow yourself awai and he leer at
me in a manner that made me feel veri uncomfort
i wa ask the ladi dramana about the sacr tree of which the
great wizard zikali desir some of the leav for hi medicin i

glare at me and ad either thei must pass the god live or
if thei prefer it thei mai pass him dead did not zikali tell you
that o blowingwind choos then will you wait upon the god live

am a lord of death doe he seek such a fate as that which befel the
hound without your door learn o priest of heuheu that it is
danger to us illomen word to me or to the lordofthefir
lest we should answer them with lightn
i suppos that these remark or someth in my ey impress him
at ani rate hi manner becam humbl almost servil inde
especi as han had risen and stood at my side hold in hi
extend hand the box of match at which all stare suspici
well thei might have stare had thei known that hi other hand
innoc buri in hi pocket grasp the butt of an excel colt
revolv i should have told you by the wai that as we could not
bring them with us to the feast we had left our rifl hidden in our
bed load and full clock so that thei would be sure to go off if
ani thief began to finger them
pardon lord pardon said dacha could i wish to insult on so
power if i said aught to offend why thi beer is strong
i bow benignantli but rememb the old latin sai to the effect
that drink dig out the truth then by wai of chang the subject
he point to the end of the room here appear two pretti women
dress in exceedingli light attir and with wreath upon their head
who bore between them a larg bowl of liquor in which float red
flower the whole scene i should sai much resembl some pictur i
had seen of an ancient romanor perhap it wa egyptian feast taken
from a fresco thei brought the bowl to dacha and with a
simultan movement of their grace form lift it up whereon
all of the compani who were not too drunk rose bow toward the bowl
and twice cri out togeth
the cup of illus the cup of illus
drink said dacha to me drink to the glori of heuheu then
observ that i hesit he ad nai i will drink first to show
that it is not poison and mutter o spirit of heuheu descend
upon thy priest drink he did a consider quantiti
then the women brought the bowl which remind me of the lovingcup
at a lord mayor feast and held it to my lip i took a pull at it
make motion of my throat as though it were a long on though in
realiti i onli swallow a sip next it wa hand to han to whom i
murmur on boer dutch word over my shoulder it wa beetj
which mean littl and as i turn my head to watch him i think he
took the advic
after thi the bowl in which i should add the liquor wa of a
greenish colour and tast someth like chartreus wa taken from
on to anoth till all present had drunk of it the girl who bore it
finish up the littl that wa left
thi i saw but after it i did not see much els for a while for
small as had been my draught the stuff went to my head and seem to
cloud my brain moreov all kind of queer vision some of them not
too desir sprang up in my mind and with them a sens of vast
that wa peopl by innumer form beauti form grotesqu
form form of folk that i had known now long dead form of other
whom i had never seen all of whom had thi peculiar that thei
seem to be stare at me with a strang intent also these form
group themselv togeth and began to enact drama of on kind or
anoth drama of war and love and death that had all the vivid
of a nightmar
present howev these illus pass awai and i remain fill
with a great calm and a wonder sens of wellb also with my
power of observ render most acut
look about me i note that all who had drunk seem to be
undergo similar experi at first thei show sign of
excit then thei grew veri still and sat like statu with their
ey fix on vacanc speak not a word move not a muscl
thi state last quit a long time till at length those who had
drunk first appear to awak for thei began to talk to each other in
low tone i note that everi sign of drunken had vanish on
and all thei look as sober as a whole bench of judg moreov
their face had grown solemn and their ey seem to be fill with
some cold and fate purpos
chapter x
the sacrific
after a solemn paus dacha rose and said in an ici voic
i hear the god call us let us pass into the presenc of the god
and make offer of the yearli sacrific
then a process wa form dacha and dramana went first han and i
follow next and after us came all who had been at the feast to a
total of about fifti peopl
baa whisper han after i had drunk that stuff which wa so
nice and warm that i wish you had let me have more of it your
reverend father came and talk to me
and what did he sai to you han
he said baa that we were go into veri queer compani and had
better keep our ey skin also that it would be wise not to
interfer in matter that did not concern us
i reflect to myself that within an hour i had receiv advic of the
same sort from a pure terrestri sourc which wa an odd
coincid unless inde han had overheard or absorb it
subconsci to him i onli observ howev that such mandat
must be obei and that whatev chanc he would do well to sit
quit still keep hi pistol readi but onli us it in case of
absolut necess to save ourselv from death
the process left the hall by a back entranc behind the tabl at
which we had sat and enter a kind of tunnel that wa lit with
lamp though whether thi wa hollow in the rock or built of block
of stone i am not sure after walk for about fifti pace down thi
tunnel suddenli we found ourselv in a great cavern also dimli lit
with lamp mere spot of light in the surround black
here all the priest includ dacha left us at least peer
about i could not see ani of them the women alon remain in the
cave where thei knelt down singli and at a distanc from each other
like scatter worshipp in a dimli lit cathedr when no servic is
in progress
dramana to whose charg we seem to have been consign led us to a
stone bench upon which she took her seat with us i note that she did
not kneel and worship like the other for a while we remain thu in
silenc stare at the black in front where no lamp burn it
wa an eeri busi in such surround that i confess began to get
upon my nerv at length i could bear it no longer and in a whisper
ask dramana whether anyth wa about to happen and if so what
the sacrific is about to happen she whisper back be silent
for here the ear of the god ar everywher
i obei think it safer and anoth ten minut or so went by in
an intoler still
when doe the plai begin baa mutter han in my ear onc i had
taken him to a theatr in durban to improv hi mind and he thought
that thi wa anoth as inde it wa if of an unusu sort
i kick him on the shin to keep him quiet and just then at a
distanc i heard the sound of chant it wa a weird and melancholi
music that seem to swing backward and forward between two band of
singer each stroph and antistroph if those ar the right word
end in a kind of wail or cry of despair which turn my blood cold
when thi had gone on for a littl while i thought that i saw figur
move through the gloom in front of us so did han for he
whisper
the hairi peopl ar here baa
can you see them i ask in the same low voic
i think so baa at ani rate i can smell them
then keep your pistol readi i answer
a moment later i saw a light torch float in the air in front of
us though the bearer of it i could not see the torch wa bent
downward and i heard the sound of kindl take fire a littl
flame sprang up reveal a pile of log arrang for burn and
beyond it the tall form of dacha wear a strang headdress and
white priestlik robe differ from those in which he had been
clad at the feast between hi hand which he held in front of him
wa a white human skull revers i mean that it upper part wa
toward the floor
burn dust of illus burn he cri and show us our desir
and out of the skull he empti a quantiti of powder on to the pile of
wood
a dens penetr smoke aros which seem to fill the cave vast
though it wa and blot out everyth it pass awai and wa
follow by a blaze of brilliant flame that lit up all the place and
reveal a terrif spectacl
behind the fire at a distanc of ten pace or so wa an aw
object an appal black figur at least twelv feet in height a
figur of heuheu as we had seen him depict in the cave of the berg
onli there hi like wa far too flatter for thi wa the veri
imag of the devil as he might have been imagin by a mad monk and
from hi ey shot a red light
as i have said befor the figur wa like to that of a huge gorilla
and yet no ap but a man and yet no man but a fiend there wa the
long grai hair grow in tuft about the bodi there wa the great
red bushi beard there were the enorm limb and the long arm and
the hand with claw on them where the thumb should be and the
web finger the bull neck on the top of which sat the small head
that somehow resembl an old woman with a hook nose the huge
mouth from which the baboonlik tusk protrud the round massiv
ablelook brow the deepest glare ey now alight with red fire
the cruel smileal were there intensifi there too wa the shape
of a dead man into the breast of which the claw foot wa driven and
in the left hand the head that had been twist from the man bodi
oh evid the painter of the pictur in the berg can have been no
bushman as onc i had suppos but some priest of heuheu whom fate
or chanc had brought thither in past ag and who had depict it to
be the object of hi privat worship when i saw the thing i gasp
aloud and felt as though i should fall to the ground through fear so
hellish wa it but han grip my arm and said
baa be not afraid it is not aliv it is but a thing of stone and
paint with fire set within
i stare again he wa right
heuheu wa but an idol heuheu did not live except in the heart of
hi worshipp
onli out of what satan mind had thi imag sprung
i sigh with relief as thi knowledg came home to me and began to
observ detail there were plenti to be seen for instanc on either
side of the statu stood a line of the hideou hairi folk men to the
right and women to the left with white cloth ti about their
middl in front of thi line behind their high priest dacha were
the other priest heuheu clergi and on a rais tabl behind them
just at the foot of the base of the statu which i now saw stood upon
a kind of pedest so as to make it more domin lai a dead bodi
that of on of the hairi women as the clear light of the flame
reveal
baa said han again i believ that is the gorillawoman i shot
in the river i seem to know her pretti face
if so i hope we shall not join her on that tabl present i
answer
after thi suddenli i went mad everybodi went mad i suppos that the
vapour from that accurs powder had got into our brain had not
dacha call it the dust of illus certainli of illus there
were plenti most of them bad like those of a nightmar
still befor thei possess me complet i had the sens to
understand what wa happen to me and to grip hold of han who i
saw wa go mad also and command him to sit quiet then came the
illus which realli i cant describ to you you fellow have read
of the effect of opium smoke well it wa that kind of thing onli
wors
i dream that heuheu got off hi pedest and came danc down the
hall also that he bent over me and kiss me on the forehead in
fact i think it wa dramana who kiss me for she too had gone
mad everyth that i had done bad in my life reenact itself in my
mind and all put togeth seem to make me a sinner inde becaus
you see the good wa entir omit the hairi folk began an
infern danc befor the statu the women round us rave and shout
with extraordinari express upon their face the priest wave
their arm and set up yell of ador as did those of baal in the
old testament in short liter there wa the devil to pai
yet strang enough it wa all wildli deliri excit and
realli i seem to enjoi it it show how wick we must be at bottom
a sight of hell while you remain on the terra firma of our earth is
not uninterest even though you be temporarili affect by it
atmospher
present the nightmar came to an end suddenli as it had commenc
and i woke to find my head on dramana shoulder or her on mine i
forget which with han engag in kiss my boot under the
impress that it wa the chast brow of some black maiden whom he
had known about thirti year befor i kick him on hi snub nose
whereon he rose and apolog remark that thi wa the strongest
daccath hemp which the nativ smoke with intox effect
that he had ever tast
ye i answer and now i understand where zikali magic come
from no wonder he want more of the leav of that tree and thought
it worth while to send us so far to get them
then i ceas talk for someth in the atmospher of the place
absorb my attent a sudden chill seem to have fallen upon it
and it occup who in strang contrast to their recent excess
now appear to be possess by the veri spirit of mr grundi there
thei stood exud pieti at everi pore and gaze with rapt
counten at the hideou imag of their god onli to me those
counten had grown veri cruel it wa as though thei await the
consumm of some dread drama with a kind of cold joi which of
cours mai have been an aftermath of their unholi intox it
wa the scene at the feast repeat but with a differ there thei
had been drunken with liquor and sober by the potent stuff thei had
swallow after it now thei had been made drunken with fume and were
sober by i knew not what their master satan perhap
the fire still burnt brightli though it gave off no more of these
fume be fed i suppos with natur fuel and by the light of it i
saw that dacha wa address the imag with impass gestur
what he said i do not know for my ear were still buzz and of it i
could hear noth but present he turn and point to us and then
began to beckon
what is it he want us to do i ask of dramana who now wa seat
at my side a perfect model of proprieti
he sai that you must come up and make your offer to the god
what offer i ask think that perhap it would be of a
pain natur
the offer of the sacr fire that the lord of fire and she
point to han bear about with him
i wa puzzl for a moment till han remark
i think she mean the match baa
then i understood and bade him produc a new box of best wax vesta
and hold it out in hi hand thu arm we advanc and pass round
the fire bow as the bibl potent whom the prophet cure
bargain he should be allow to do in the hous of rimmon to the
beastli effigi of heuheu then in obedi to the mutter
direct of dacha han solemnli deposit the box of match upon
the stone tabl after which we were allow to retreat
anyth more ridicul than thi scene it is imposs to imagin
i suppos that it intens absurd wa caus or at ani rate
accentu by it startl and inde horribl contrast there wa
the tower and demoniac idol there were the rogu priest their
face alight with a fierc fanatic there look onli half human
were the long line of savag hairi folk there wa the burn fire
reflect itself to the farthest recess of the cavern and show
the form of the scatter worshipp
final there wa myself a bronz and tatter individu and the
dirti abjectlook han hold in hi hand that absurd box of
match which final he deposit in the exact middl of the stone
tabl about six inch from the swollen bodi of the aborigin whom he
had shot in the river in those vast surround thi box look so
lone and so small that the sight of it move me to intern
convuls shake with hyster laughter i return to my seat as
quickli as i could drag han after me for i saw that hi case
wa the same although fortun it is not the custom of hottentot
to burst into open merriment
what will heuheu do with the match baa ask han sure
there must be plenti of fire where he is baa
ye lot i repli with energi but perhap of anoth sort
then i observ that dacha wa point to the right and that the ey
of all present were fix in that direct
the sacrific come murmur dramana and as she spoke a woman
appear a tall woman cover with a white robe or veil who wa led
forward by two of the hairi peopl she wa brought to the front of
the tabl on which lai the bodi and the match and there stood quit
still
who is thi i ask
last year bride with whom the priest ha done and pass on into
the keep of the god answer dramana with a stoni smile
do you mean that thei ar go to kill the poor thing i said
horrifi
the god is about to take her into hi keep she repli
enigmat
at thi moment on of the savag attend snatch awai the veil
which drape the victim reveal a veri beauti woman clad in a
white kirtl which wa cut low upon her breast and reach to her
knee tall and state she stood quit still befor us her black
hair stream down upon her shoulder then as though at some
signal all the women in the audienc stood up and scream
wed her to the god wed her to the god and let us drink of the cup
that through her unit us to the god
two of the hairi folk drew near to the girl each of whom had
someth in hi hand though what it wa at the moment i could not
see and stood still as though wait for a sign then follow a
paus dure which i glanc about me at the face of the women made
hideou by the unholi passion that rage within them who stood with
outstretch arm point at the victim thei look horribl and i
hate them all except dramana who i note with relief had not
cri aloud and did not stretch out her hand like the rest
what wa i about to see some dread act of voodooism such as
negro practis in haiti and on the west coast perhap if so i
could not bear it whatev the risk might be i could not bear it
almost automat my hand grasp the stock of my revolv
dacha seem as though he were about to sai someth a word of doom
mayhap i measur the distanc between me and himself with my ey
calcul where i should aim to put a bullet through hi larg head
and give the god a sacrific which it did not expect inde had he
spoken such a word without doubt i should have done it for as you
fellow know i am handi with a pistol and probabl as a result
never have live to tell you thi stori
as thi junctur howev the victim wave her arm and said in a
loud clear voic
i claim the ancient right to make my prayer to the god befor i am
given to the god
speak on said dacha and be swift
she turn and curtsei to the hideou idol then wheel about again
and address it in form although realli she wa speak to the
audienc
o fiend heuheu she said in a voic fill with aw scorn and
bitter whom my peopl worship to their ruin i who wa stolen
from my peopl come to thee becaus i would have none of yonder high
priest and therefor must pai the price in blood so be it but er i
come i have someth to tell these priest who grow fat in
wicked hearken a spirit is in me give me sight i see thi
place a sea of water i see flame burst through the water turn
thy hideou effigi to dust and burn up thy evil servant so that
not on of them remain the propheci the propheci let all who hear
me bethink them of the ancient propheci for at length it hour is
fulfil
then she stare toward han and myself wave her arm and i
thought wa about to address us if so she chang her mind and did
not
so far the priest and the congreg had listen in the silenc of
amaz or perhap of fear now howev a howl of furiou
execr broke from them and when it di down i heard dacha
shout
let thi blasphem witch be slain let the sacrific be
accomplish
the two savag step toward her and now i saw that what thei held
in their hand were coil of rope with which doubtless she wa to be
bound if so she wa too swift for them for with a great bound she
sprang upon the tabl where lai the bodi of the hairi woman and the
box of match next instant i saw a knife flash in her hand i
suppos it had been conceal somewher in her dress she lift it
and plung it to her heart cry as she did so
my blood be on you priest of heuheu
then she fell down there upon the tabl and wa still
in the hush that follow i heard han sai
that wa a brave ladi baa and doubtless all she said will come
true mai i shoot that priest baa or will you
no i began but befor i could get out anoth word my voic wa
overwhelm by a tumult of shout
the god ha been rob of hi sacrific and is hungri let the
stranger be offer to the god
these and other like thing said the shout
dacha look toward us hesit and i saw that it wa time to
act rise i call out
know o dacha that befor on hand is laid upon us i will make you
as my companion lordofthefir made the dog without your door
evid dacha believ me for he grew quiet humbl have no fear
lord he said ar you not our honour guest and the messeng
of a great on go in peac and safeti
then at hi command or sign the brightli burn fire wa scatter
so that the cave grew almost dark especi as some of the light
had gone out
follow me swiftlyswiftli said dramana and take my hand she led
me awai through the gloom
present we found ourselv in the passag though for aught i know
it wa anoth passag at ani rate it led to the hall where we had
feast thi wa now empti although in it light still burn
cross it dramana conduct us back to the hous where a hasti
examin shew us that our rifl were just as we had left them
noth had been touch here see that we were quit alon for
all had gone to the sacrific i spoke to her
ladi dramana i said doe my heart tell me truli or do i onli
dream that you desir to depart from out of the shadow of heuheu
she glanc about her cautious then answer in a low voic lord
there is noth that i desir so muchunless perchanc it be death
she ad with a sigh hearken seven year ago i wa bound upon the
rock of offer where my sister will stand tomorrow have been
chosen by the god and dedic to him by the mad terror of my peopl
which mean lord that i had been chosen by dacha and dedic to
dacha
why then do you still live i ask see that she who wa
chosen last year must be sacrif thi year
lord am i not the daughter of the walloo the ruler of the peopl of
the mainland and might not the titl to that rule be acquir through
me while i breath it is not the best of titl it is true becaus
i wa born of a lesser wife of my father the walloo wherea my
sister sabeela is born of the great wife still at a pinch it might
serv that is why i still live
what then is dacha plan ladi dramana
it stand thu lord hitherto for mani gener it is said sinc
the great fire burn upon the island and destroi the citi there
have been two govern in thi land that of the priest of heu
heu who govern the mind of it peopl also the wild wood folk and
that of the walloo who govern their bodi and ar king by ancient
right now dacha who when he is not lost in drink or other folli
is farse and ambiti purpos to rule both mind and bodi and
it mai be to bring in new blood from outsid our countri and onc more
to build up a great peopl such as tradit tell we were in the
begin when we came here from the north or from the west he doe
but wait until he ha marri my sister the law heiress to the
walloo my father who by now must be an old and feebl man to strike
hi blow and in her name to seiz the govern and power
the priest as you have seen ar but few and cannot do thi of
their own strength but thei command all the savag folk who ar
call the children of heuheu now these peopl ar veri angri
becaus the other dai on of their women wa kill upon the river
she who lai on the altar befor the god and thi thei think wa done
by the walloo not understand that it wa your servant the yellow
man there who slew her or if thei understand thei believ that he
did so by the order of issicor who we hear is betroth to my
sister sabeela
therefor thei wish to make a great war upon the walloo under the
guidanc of the priest of heuheu whom thei call their father
becaus hi imag is like to them alreadi their mankind ar gather
on the island row themselv hither upon log or bundl of reed
and by tomorrow night all will be collect then after what is
call the holi marriag when my sister sabeela ha been brought as
an offer by the walloo and bound to the pillar between the
everlast fire led by dacha thei will attack the citi on the
mainland which thei dare not do alon it will surrend to them and
dacha will kill my old father and the lord issicor who stand next to
him and ani of the ancient blood who cling to him and caus himself
to be declar walloo after thi hi purpos is to poison the forest
folk as he well know how to do and as i have told you perhap to
bring new blood into the land which is rich and wide and found a
kingdom
a big scheme i said not without admir for on hear it to
tell the truth i began to conceiv a certain respect for that villain
dacha who at ani rate had idea and present a strike contrast
to the helpless and superstitionridden inhabit of the mainland
but ladi i went on what is to happen to me and to my companion
who is name lordofthefir
i do not know lord who have had littl talk with dacha sinc you
came or with ani to whom he reveal hi secret i think howev
that he is afraid of you believ you to be magician or in leagu
with the greatest of magician the prophet zikali who dwell in the
south with whom the priest of heuheu commun from time to time
also it is probabl that he hold that you mai be abl to help him to
build up a nation and that therefor he would wish to keep you in hi
servic in thi countri onli kill you if you try to escap on the
other hand when the wood folk come to understand that it wa realli
you or on of you who kill the woman thei mai clamour for your
live then if he think it wisest to pleas them at the great feast
which is call the finish of the holi marriag you mai be ti
upon the altar as a sacrific while the blood is drain from you to
be drunk by the priest with the lip of heuheu perhap that matter
will be settl at the council of the priest tomorrow lord
thank you i said never mind the detail
meanwhil she went on for the present you ar safe inde i who

chapter xi
the sluic gate
all that night it pour not mere in the usual tropic torrent
but posit in waterspout seldom in my life have i heard such
rain as that which fell upon the roof of the hous where we were
which must have been wonderfulli well built for otherwis it would
have given awai when we rose in the morn and went to the door to
look out all the place wa swim and a solid wall of water seem
to stretch from heaven to earth
i think there will be a flood after thi baa remark han
i think so too i answer and if we were not here i wish that it
might be deep enough to drown everi human brute upon thi island
it cannot do that baa becaus at the worst thei would climb up the
mountain though it might get into the cave and give heuheu a wash
which he need
if it got into the cave it would probabl get into the mountain as
well i beganthen stop for an idea occur to me
i had notic that thi cave slope downward somewhat steepli i mean
into the base of the mountain and toward it centr probabl in it
origin it wa a vent blown through the rock at some time in the past
when the volcano wa veri activ which for aught i knew remain
unblock or onli slightli block suppos now that a great volum
of water ran down that cave and vanish into the interior of the
mountain wa it not probabl that someth unusu would happen the
volcano wa still alivethi i knew from the smoke that hung abov
it also by the stream of redhot lava that we had seen trickl down
it southern faceand fire and water do not agre well togeth thei
make steam and steam expand thi thought took such a persist
hold on me that i began to wonder whether it did not partak of the
natur of an inspir howev i said noth of it to han who
be a savag did not understand such matter
a littl later food wa brought to us by on of the serv priest
with it came a messag from dacha to the effect that he griev he
could not wait on us that dai as he had mani matter to which he must
attend but that the ladi dramana would do so shortli and show us all
there wa to be seen if the rain permit
in due cours she arrivedalon as i had hope she wouldand at
onc began to talk of the rainfal of the previou night which she
said wa such as had never been known in their countri she ad that
all the priest had been out that morn drag the great stone
sluic gate into it place so as to keep out the water of the lake
lest the arabl land should be flood and the crop destroi
i told her that i wa much interest in such matter and ask
question about thi sluic which she could not answer as she knew
littl of it work she said howev that she would show it to me
so that i might studi the system
i thank her and inquir whether the lake had risen much she
answer not yet but that probabl it would do so dure the dai and
the follow night when it becam fill with the water brought down
by the flood river which ran into it from the countri to the north
at ani rate thi wa fear and it had been thought best to set the
sluic in place a difficult task becaus of it weight inde a
woman who had gone to help out of curios had been caught by a lever
i understood that wa what she meantand kill she still lai by
the sluic sinc it wa not law for the priest of heuheu or
their servant to touch a dead bodi between the feast of illus
which had been held on the previou night and the feast of marriag
which would be held on the night of the morrow when she ad
significantli thei often touch plenti
it is a feast of blood then i said
ye lord a feast of blood and i prai that it mai not be of your
blood also
have no fear of that i answer airili though in truth i felt much
depress then i ask her to tell me exactli what wa go to
happen as to the deliveri of the holi bride
thi lord she said befor midnight when the moon should be at
it fullest a cano come bring the bride from the citi of the
walloo priest receiv her and tie her to the pillar that stand on
the rock of offer between the everlast fire then the cano
goe and wait at a distanc the priest go also and leav the bride
alon i know it all lord for i have been that bride so she stand
until the first rai of the rise sun strike upon her then from the
mouth of the cave come out the high priest dress in skin to
resembl the imag of the god and follow by women and some of the
hairi savag folk shout in triumph he loos the bride and thei
bear her in the cave and there lord she vanish
do you think that she will be brought at all dramana
certainli she will be brought sinc if my father the walloo or
issicor or ani refus to send her thei would be kill by their
own peopl who believ that then disast would overtak them unless
you can save her by your art lord my sister sabeela must becom the
wife of heuheu which mean the wife of dacha
i will think the matter over i said but if i make up my mind to
help am i right in understand that you also desir to escap from
thi island
lord i have told you so alreadi and i will onli add thi dacha
hate me and when i have serv hi purpos and he ha in hi hand
sabeela the true heiress to the chieftainship over our peopl unless
first i tread her road certainli it will be my lot to stand where
that poor woman stood last night who slew herself to escap wors
thing oh lord save me if you can
i will save youif i can i repli and i meant italmost as much
as i meant to save myself
then i impress upon her that she must obei me in all thing without
question and thi she swore to do also i ask her if she could
provid us with a cano
it is imposs she repli dacha is clever he ha bethought
him that you might depart in a cano therefor everi on of them ha
been move round to the other side of the island where thei ar kept
under watch of the savag folk that is why he give you leav to roam
about the place becaus he know that you cannot leav it unless you
have wing for the lake is too wide for ani man to swim and if it
were not the walloo shore is haunt by crocodil
now my friend as you mai guess thi wa a blow inde howev i
kept my counten and said that as thi wa the case someth els
must be arrang onli ask casual if there were ani crocodil
about thi part of the island coast she answer that there were
none becaus as she suppos the flame of the everlast fire
or some smell from the smoke of the mountain frighten them awai
next as the torrent of rain had ceas at ani rate for a while i
suggest that we should go out and we did so also i did not mind
much about the weather as to protect us from it she had brought with
her for our us and her own three of the strangest waterproof that
ever i saw these consist of two giant leav from some kind of
waterlili that grew on the border of the lake sewn togeth with a
hole at the top of the leav where the stalk come for the wearer
head to go through and two open left for hi arm for the rest
no mackintosh ever turn wet so well as did these leav the onli
drawback about them as i wa inform be that thei must be
renew onc in everi three dai
arrai in these queer garment we went out in rain that here we
should call fairli heavi though it wa but the merest drizzl
compar to what had gone befor thi rain i mai explain had great
advantag so far as we were concern see that in it not even the
most curiou woman put her nose outsid her own door so it came about
that we were abl to examin the villag of the priest of heuheu
quit unobserv and at our leisur
thi settlement wa small sinc there were never more than fifti
priest in the colleg if so it mai be call to whom of cours
must be ad their wive and women on an averag perhap of three
or four per man
the odd thing wa that there seem to be no children and no old
peopl either offspr did not arriv and folk di young upon the
island or in both case thei were made awai with perhap as
sacrific to heuheu i am sorri to sai that in the pressur of great
danger i do not rememb make ani inquiri upon the point or if i
did i cannot recal the answer given it wa onli afterward that i
reflect upon thi strang circumst the fact remain that on the
island there were no young and no ag anoth possibl explan
by the wai is that both mai have been export to the mainland
here i will add that with the except of dramana and a few discard
wive who mai have been doom to sacrific the women were fiercer
bigot and more cruel votari of heuheu than were the men
themselv so inde i had observ when i sat among them at the
feast of illus in the cave
for the rest thei all live in dwell such as that which wa given
to us and were wait upon by servant or slave from the savag race
that wa call heuheua low as these heuheua were and disgust as
might be their appear like our south african bushmen thei were
clever in their wai and when train could do mani thing also
thei were faith to the command of their god heuheu or rather to
those of hi priest though thei hate the walloo from whom these
priest sprang and wage continu war against them
soon we had left the hous and were among the cultiv land all
of which dramana inform us were work by the heuheua slave these
labour here in gang for a year at a time and then were return to
their women in the forest on the mainland for except as servant
none of them were allow upon the island those land were
extraordinarili fertil as wa shewn by the crop on them which
although much beaten down by the torrenti rain were now readi for
harvest thei were enclos by a kind of sea wall built of block of
lava and must at some time have been reclaim from the muddi shallow
of the lake which account for their rich everywher about them
ran irrig channel that were us in the dry sow season and
control by the sluic gate that ha been mention that is all i
have to sai about the garden except that the exist of thi
irrig system is to my mind anoth proof that these walloo
sprang origin from some highli civil race their field
extend to that extrem of the island which wa nearest to the
walloo coast and i know not how far in the other direct for i did
not go there
stand upon thi point we saw in the distanc a number of move
speck upon the water i ask dramana if thei were hippopotami and
she answer
no lord thei ar the hairi folk who in obedi to the summon of
the god cross the lake upon bundl of reed that thei mai be readi
to fight in the come war against the walloo alreadi there ar
hundr of them gather upon the farther side of the mountain and
by tonight all their ablebodi men will have come leav onli the
femal the ag and the children hidden awai in the depth of the
forest on the third dai from now thei will paddl back across the
lake led by the priest under the command of dacha and attack
walloo
a great deal mai happen in three dai i said and drop the
subject
we walk back toward the villag and the cave mouth by the sea wall
upon the top of which ran a path and thu at last came to the rock of
offer upon each side of which burn the two curiou column of
flame that i took it were fed with natur ga gener in the womb
of the volcano thei were not veri larg firesat ani rate when i
saw themth flame mai have been about eight or ten feet high no
more but there thei burn and had done so dramana said from the
begin of thing between them at a littl distanc stood a post
of stone with ring also of stone to which the bride wa bound i
note that from these ring hung new rope place there to serv as
the bond of sabeela dure the come night
have seen all there wa to see on thi rock of offer includ
the step by which the victim wa land we went on to a long shed
with a steep reed roof which contain the machineri if so i can
call it that regul the irrig sluic it had a heavi wooden
door which dramana unlock with an oddshap stone kei that she
produc from a bag she wa wear thi kei she told us had been
given to her by dacha with strict order that she wa to return it
after we had examin the place should we wish to do so
as it happen there wa a good deal to examin near on end of the
shed the main irrig canal which mai have been twelv feet wide
pass beneath it here under the centr of the roof wa a pit of
which the water that stood in it prevent us from see the depth
on either side of thi pit were perpendicular groov cut in the solid
rock veri deep groov that were exactli fill by a huge slab of
dress stone six or seven inch thick when thi stone or the upper
part of it wa lift out of the rock floor of the channel where
normal it stood in it nich form part of the bed of the
channel it entir cut off the inflow of water from the lake and
wa moreov tall enough to stop ani possibl addit inflow at a
time of flood
perhap i can make the thing clear in thi wai when good and i were
last in london togeth we went to madam tussaud and saw the famou
guillotin that wa us in the french revolut the knife of that
guillotin you will rememb wa rais between upright and when
brought into action let fall again to the bottom of the apparatu
sever the neck of the victim in it cours now imagin that those
upright were the rock wall of the pit and that the knife instead
of be but a narrow thing were a great sheet of steel or rather
stone then when it wa drawn to the top of the upright from the
nich at the bottom it would entir fill the space to the head of
the groov and none of the water that normal pass over it could
flow between the upright or rather wall becaus the sheet of stone
bar it passag now do you understand
as good who wa stupid about such matter look doubt allan
went on
perhap a better illustr would be that of a portculli even
you good have seen a portculli which by the wai must mean a door
in a groov imagin a subterranean or rather subaqu portculli
that when it wa desir to shut it rose in it groov from below
instead of fall from abov and you will have an exact idea of the
water door of the priest of heuheu id draw it for you if it wasnt
so late
i see now said good and i suppos thei wound the thing up with a
windlass
why not sai with a donkei engin at onc good windlass had not
occur to the walloo no thei act on a simpler and more ancient
plan thei lift it with a lever near the top of thi slab of rock
or water door wa drill a hole through thi hole pass a bolt of
stone of which the end went into the cutout base of the lever thu
form a kind of hing the lever itself wa a bar of stone
evid thei would not trust to wood which rotsmass and about
twenti feet long so as to obtain the best possibl purchas when the
door wa quit down in it nich at the bottom of the bed of the
channel the end of the lever natur rose high into the air almost
to the top of the pitch roof of the shed inde
when it wa desir to rais the door so as to regul the amount of
water pass into the irrig channel beyond or to cut if off
altogeth in case of flood the lever wa pull down by rope that
were ti to it end by the strength of a number of men and that end
wa pass into or rather under on or other of half a dozen hook
of stone hollow into a face of solid rock here of cours it
remain immov until it wa releas again by the unit strength
of a number of men and flew back to the roof let the portculli
slab drop into it bed or groov at the bottom of the channel thu
admit the lake water
on the present occas as a great flood wa anticip thi slab
wa rais to it full extent and when i saw it the top of it stood
five or six feet abov the level of the water while the end of the
handl of the lever wa made fast beneath the lowest hook of rock
within a foot of the floor
han and i examin thi primit but effect apparatu for
prevent inund veri carefulli suppos thought i that ani
on want to releas that lever so that the door fell and water
rush in over it how could it be done answer it could onli be done
by the applic of the unit forc of a great number of men
press on the end of the lever till it wa push clear of the point
of the hook when natur it would fly upward and the door would
fall or secondli by break the lever in two when of cours the
same thing would happen now two men that is han and myself could
not possibl releas thi beam of stone from it hook inde i doubt
whether ten men could have done it nor could two men possibl break
that beam of stone perhap if thei had suitabl marbl saw such as
worker in stone us and plenti of time thei might cut it in two
although it seem to be made of a kind of rock that wa as hard as
iron but we had no saw therefor so far as we were concern the
task wa imposs that idea must be dismiss
still there is a wai out of most difficulti if onli it can be hit
upon my own mental resourc were exhaust it is true but han
remain and possibl he might have some suggest of valu to make
he wa a curiou creatur han and often hi concentr primit
instinct led him more directli to the mark than did all my civil
reason
so speak without emphasi in dutch for i did not wish dramana to
guess my intern excit i put the problem to han in these
word
suppos and you and i han with none to help except perhap thi
woman found it necessari to break that bar of stone and caus the
water gate to fall so as to let in the lake flood over it how could
we do it with such mean as we have in thi place
han stare about him twiddl hi hat in hi usual vacuou fashion
and remark
i dont know baa
then find out for i want to learn if your conclus agre with my
own i answer
i think that if thei agre with the baass thei will agre with
noth at all said han deliv thi shrewd and perfectli
accur shot with such a wooden express of utter stupid that i
could have kick him
next without more word he remov himself from my neighbourhood and
began to examin the lever in a casual fashion especi the hook of
rock which held it in it place present he remark in arab so
that dramana might understand that he want to see how deep the pit
wa which we could not do from the floor of the shed and instantli
climb up the slope of the beamlik lever with all the agil of a
monkei and sat himself crossleg on the top of it just below
the stone hing that i have describ here he remain for a while
appar stare into the dark of the hole or pit on the farther
side of the stone slab where of cours it wa almost empti as the
door cut off the water from the irrig channel on the island side
that hole is too dark to see into he said present and swarm
down the shaft again then he call my attent to the bodi of the
dead woman who dramana had told us wa struck by the lever and kill
while it wa be drag into place which lai almost out of sight
in the shadow by the wall of the shed we went to look at her she wa
a tall woman handsom like all these peopl and young outwardli
she show no sign of injuri for her long white robe wa unstain
i suppos that she had been crush between the lever and the hook or
perhap struck in the side of the head as it wa be swung into
place whilst we were examin the corps of thi unfortun han
said to me still speak in dutch
doe the baa rememb that we have two pound tin of the best rifl
powder in our bag and that he scold me becaus i did not take them
out when we left the hous of the walloo sai that it wa foolish
to bring them with us as thei would be quit useless to us on the
island
i repli that i had some recollect of the incid and that as a
matter of fact thei had been heavi to carri then han proceed to
set a riddl in hi irrit and sententi wai ask
who doe the baa think know most about thing that ar to happen
the baa or the baass reverend father in heaven
my father i presum han i repli airili
the baa is right the baass father in the sky know much more than
the baa but sometim i think that han know better than either at
ani rate here on the earth
i stare at the littl wretch render speechless by hi irrever
impud but he went on unabash
i did not forget to leav that powder behind baa i brought it with
me think that it might be us becaus with powder you can blow
up men and other thing also i did not wish it to stai where we
might never see it again
well what about the powder i ask
noth much baa at least onli thi these walloo do not bore
stone veri well thei make the hole too big for what ha to go
through them that in the water gate is so larg that there would be
room to put two pound flask of powder beneath the pin so that the
strain lift it up to the top of the hole
and what would be the us of put two flask of powder in such a
place i inquir carelessli for at the moment i wa think about
the dead woman
none at all baa none at all onli i thought the baa ask me how
we could loos that stone arm if two pound of powder were put into
the hole cover with a littl mud and fire i think that thei
would blow out the bit of rock at the top of the hole or break the
pin or both then as there would be noth to hold it the stone
door would fall down and the lake would come in and water the field
of the priest of heuheu if in hi wisdom and kind the baa
think thei want it at harvest time and after so much rain
you littl wretch i said you infern clever littl wretch hang
me if i dont think you have got hold of the right end of the stick
thi time onli the busi will take a lot of think out and
arrang
ye baa and we had better do that in the hous which as the baa
know is quit close onli about a hundr pace awai let us get out
of thi place baa befor the ladi begin to smell rat onli as
you go take a good squint at that hole in the top of the stone door
and the rock pin that goe through it
then han who all thi while had been stare at the bodi of the
woman and appar talk about her bow toward it remark in
arab allah i mean heuheu receiv her into hi bosom and
retreat reverenti
so we went awai but i linger behind examin the hole and the
pin veri carefulli
han wa quit right there wa just room left in the former to
accommod two tin flask of powder also there were not more than
three inch of rock on the topsid of the hole sure two pound of
powder would suffic to blow out thi ring of stone and perhap to
shatter the pin as well
chapter xii
the plot
we left the shed and after she had lock it door veri carefulli and
return the stone kei to her pouch were taken by dramana to see the
famou tree of illus of which the juic and leav if powder
and burnt could produc such strang dream and intox effect
it grew in a larg wall space that wa call heuheu garden
though noth els wa plant there dramana assur us inde that
thi tree had a poison effect upon all other veget
pass the wall by a door of which she also produc some kind of kei
out of her bag we found ourselv stand in front of the famou
tree if so it can be call for it growth wa shrublik and it
topmost twig were not more than twenti feet abov the ground on the
other hand it cover a great area and had a trunk two or three feet
thick from which project a vast number of branch whereof the
extrem lai upon the soil and i think root there after the
manner of wild fig though of thi i am not certain
it wa an unholi product of natur inasmuch as it had no real
foliag onli dark green euphorbialik and flesh fingersinde i
think it must have been some varieti of euphorbia at the extrem
of these green finger appear purplecolour bloom with a most
evil smell that remind me of the odour of someth dead also down
their sidesfor like the orang the tree appear to have the
properti of flower and fruit at the same timewer yellow seed
vessel about the size of those of a prickli pear except that the
trunk wa cover with corrug grai bark and that the fingerlik
leav were full of resin white milk like those of other
euphorbia there is noth more to sai about it i should add
howev that dramana told us no other specimen exist either on the
mainland or the island and that to attempt it propag elsewher
wa a capit offenc in short the tree of illus wa a monopoli
of the priest
han set to work and cut a larg faggot of the leav or finger
which he ti up with a piec of string he had in hi pocket to be
convei to zikali though there seem to be such a small prospect of
their ever reach him it wa not an agreeabl job for when it wa
cut the white juic of the tree spurt out and if it fell upon the
flesh burn like caustic
i wa glad when it came to an end becaus of the stench of the
flower but befor i left i took the opportun when dramana wa
not look of pick some of the ripest of the fruit and put
them in my pocket with the idea of plant the seed should we ever
escap from that countri i am sorri to sai howev that i never did
so as the sharp spine that grew upon the fruit wore a hole in the
line of my pocket which alreadi wa thin from us and thei tumbl
out unobserv evid the tree of illus did not intend to be
reproduc elsewher at least that wa hanss explan
on our wai back to the hous we had to pass round a lava boulder on
the lake side of the sluic shed cross by a littl bridg the
water channel that ran beneath it near to a flight of land step
that were us by fishermen i examin thi channel which pierc the
sea wall and here outsid the sluic gate wa about twenti feet
wide at the side of it built into the wall wa a slab of stone on
which were mark cut there no doubt to indic the height of the
water level and the rate at which it rose i notic that the topmost
of these mark wa alreadi cover and that dure the littl while i
stood and watch it vanish altogeth show that the water wa
rise rapidli
see that i wa interest dramana remark that the priest said
that tradit never told of the water have reach that topmost
mark befor even dure the greatest rain she ad that she
suppos it had done so now ow to the unpreced wet of the
summer and great tempest farther up the river that fed the lake of
which we were experienc the last
it is fortun that you have such a strong door to keep out the
water i said
ye lord she answer sinc if it broke all thi side of the
island would be flood if you look you will see that alreadi the
lake stand higher than the cultiv land and even than the mouth
of the cave of heuheu it is told in tradit that when first
hundr of year ago these land were reclaim from the mud of the
lake and the wall wa built to protect them the priest of heuheu
trust to the rain for their crop then came mani dry season and
thei cut a wai through the wall and let in water to irrig them
make the sluic gate that you have seen to keep it out if it rose
too high an old priest of that time said that thi wa mad and
would on dai prove their destruct but thei laugh at him and
made the sluic he wa wrong also sinc thenceforward their crop
were doubl and the gate is so wellfashion that no flood
howev great have ever pass through or over it nor can thei do
so becaus the top of the stone gate rise to the height of a child
abov the level of the water wall which separ the lake from the
reclaim land
the lake might come over the crest of the wall i suggest
no lord if you look you will see that the wall is rais far abov
it level to a height that no flood could ever reach
then safeti depend upon the gate dramana
ye lord if the flood were high enough which it never ha been
within the memori of man the safeti of the town would depend upon the
gate and that of the cave of heuheu also befor the mountain broke
into flame and destroi the citi of our ancestor the new mouth wa
made on the level for formerli it is said it wa enter from the
slope abov moreov there is no danger becaus if ani accid
happen and the flood broke through all could flee up the mountain
onli then the cultiv land would be ruin for a time and there
might be scarciti dure which peopl must obtain corn from the
mainland or draw it from that which is store in pit in the hillsid
to be us in case of war or sieg
i thank her for her explan of these interest hydraul
problem and after anoth glanc at the scale rock on which the
mark had now vanish complet show me that the lake wa still
rise rapidli we went to the hous to rest and eat
here dramana left us sai that she would return at sundown i
beg her to do so without fail thi i did for her own sake a fact
that i did not explain person i wa indiffer as to whether
she came back or not have learn all she could teach us but as i
wa plan catastroph i wa anxiou should it come to give her
ani chanc of escap that might offer for ourselv after all she
had been a good friend to us and wa on who hate dacha and heuheu
and love her sister sabeela
han led her to the door and in an awkward fashion made much ado in
help her to put on her leaf raincoat which she had discard and
wa carri for now suddenli the rain which had almost ceas while
we walk had begun to fall again in torrent
when we had eaten and were left alon within close door han and i
took counsel togeth
what is to be done han i ask wish to hear hi view
thi i think baa he answer when it draw near to midnight we
must go to hide near the step there by the rock of offer not
the smaller on near the sluic gate then when the cano come and
land the ladi sabeela to be marri as soon as she ha been taken
and ti to the post we must swim out to it get aboard and go back
to wallootown
but that would not save the ladi sabeela han
no baa i wa not troubl my head about the ladi sabeela who i
hope will be happi with heuheu but it would save us though
perhap we shall have to leav some of our thing behind if issicor
and the rest wish to save ladi sabeela thei had better ceas from
be coward who ar afraid of a stone statu and a hand of
priest and do so for themselv
listen han i said we came here to get a bundl of stink
leav for zikali and to save the ladi sabeela who is the victim of
folli and wicked the first we have got the second remain to be
done i mean to save that unfortun woman or to die in the
attempt
ye baa i thought the baa would sai that sinc we ar all fool
in our differ wai and how can ani on dig out of hi heart the
folli that hi mother put there befor he wa born therefor sinc
the baa is a fool or in love with ladi sabeela becaus she is so
prettyi dont know whichw must make anoth plan and try to get
ourselv kill in carri it out
what plan i ask disregard hi crude satir
i dont know baa he said stare at the roof if i had
someth to drink i might be abl to think of on as all thi wet
ha fill my head with fog just as my stomach is full of water
still baa do i understand the baa to sai that if that stone gate
were broken the lake would flow in and flood thi place also the cave
of heuheu where all the priest and their wive will be gather
worship him
ye han so i believ and veri quickli as soon as the water began
to run it would tear awai the wall on either side of the sluic and
enter in a mighti flood especi now as the rain is again fall
heavili
then baa we must let the stone fall and as we ar not strong
enough to do it ourselv we must ask thi to help us and he
produc from hi bag the two pound of powder done up in stout flask
of solder tin as it had left the maker in england as i am call
lordofthefir the priest of heuheu will think it quit natur
he ad with a grin
ye han i said nod but the question ishow
i think like thi baa we must pack these two tin tight into that
hole in the rock door beneath the pin with the help of littl stone
and cover them over thickli with mud to give the powder time to work
befor the tin ar blown out of the hole but first we must bore
hole in the tin and make slow match and put the end of them into
the hole onli how ar we to make these slow match
i look about me there on a shelf in the room stood the clai lamp
with which it wa light at night and by them lai a coil of the wick
which these peopl us made of fine and dry plait rush mani
feet of it
there the veri stuff i said
we got it down we soak it in a mixtur of the nativ oil mix
with gunpowd that i extract from a cartridg and behold in half
an hour we had two splendid slow match that by experi i reckon
would take quit five minut to burn befor the fire reach the
powder that wa all we could do for the moment
now baa said han when we had finish our prepar and
hidden the match awai to dry all thi is veri nice but suppos
that the stone fall and the water run in and everyth goe softli
how ar we to get off the island if we drown the priest of heuheu
though i do not think we shall drown them becaus thei will bolt up
the mountainsid like rock rabbitsw drown ourselv also and
travel in their compani to the place of fire of which your reverend
father wa so fond of talk it will be veri nice to try to drown
the priest of heuheu baa but we shall be no better off nor will
the ladi sabeela if we leav her ti to that post
we shall not leav her han that is if thing go as i hope we
shall leav someon els
han saw light and hi face brighten
oh baa now i understand you mean that you will tie to the post
the ladi dramana who is older and not quit so nicelook as the
ladi sabeela which is why you told her she must stai with us all the
time after she come back that is quit a good plan especi as it
will save us troubl with her afterward onli baa it will be
necessari to give her a littl knock on the head first lest she should
make a nois and betrai us in her selfish
han you ar a brute to think that i mean anyth of the sort i
said indignantli
ye baa of cours i am a brute who think of you and myself befor
i do of other but then who will the baa leav sure he doe not
mean to leav me dress up in a bride robe he ad in genuin
alarm
han you ar a fool as well as a brute for silli as you mai be
how could i get on without you i do not mean to leav ani on live
i mean to leav that dead woman in the gate hous
he stare at me in evid admir and answer
the baa is grow quit clever for onc he ha thought of
someth that i have not thought of first it is a good planif we
can carri her there without ani on see us and the ladi sabeela
doe not betrai us by make a nois laugh and cry both
togeth like stupid women do but suppos that it all happen there
will be four of us and how ar we to get into that cano baa if
those cowardli walloo wait so long
thu han when the cano land the ladi sabeela and she ha been
ti to the post if dramana speak truth it wait for the dawn at a
littl distanc while it is wait you must swim out to it take
your pistol with you which you will hold abov your head with on
hand to keep the cartridg dry but leav everyth els behind
then you must get into the boat tell the walloo and issicor or
whoever is there who you ar later when all is quiet the ladi
dramana and i will carri the dead woman to the post and tie her there
in place of sabeela after thi you will bring the cano to the
land stepsth small land step by the big boulder which we saw
near to the sluic mouth on the lake wall those that dramana told us
were us by fishermen becaus it is not law for them to set foot
upon the rock of offer you rememb them
ye baa you mean the on at the end of a littl pier which
dramana also said wa built to keep mud from the lake from drift
into the sluic mouth and block it
when i see you come han i shall fire the slow match and we
will run down to the pier and get into the cano i hope that the
priest and their women in the cave which is at a distanc will not
hear the powder explod beneath that shed and that when thei come out
of the cave thei will find the water run in and swamp them
thi might give them someth els to do besid pursu us as
doubtless thei would otherwis for i am sure thei have cano hidden
awai somewher near by although dramana mai not know where thei ar
now do you understand
oh ye baa as i said the baa ha grown quit clever all of a
sudden i think it must be that wine of dream he drank last night
that ha woke up hi mind but the baa ha miss on thing
suppos that i get into the cano safe how am i to make those
peopl row in to the land step and take you off probabl thei
will be afraid baa or sai that it is against their custom or that
heuheu will catch them if thei do or someth of the sort
you will talk to them gentli han and if thei will not listen then
you will talk to them with your pistol ye if necessari you will
shoot on or more of them han after which i think the rest will
obei you but i hope that thi will not be necessari sinc if
issicor is there certainli he will desir to win back sabeela from
heuheu now we have settl everyth and i am go to sleep for a
while with the slow match under me to dry them as i advis you to
do also we had littl rest last night and tonight we shall have
none at all so we mai as well take some while we can but first bring
that mat and tie up the twig from the stink tree for zikali on
whom be everi kind of curs for send us on thi job
settl everyth i repeat to myself with inward sarcasm as i
lai down and shut my ey in truth noth at all wa ever less
settl sinc success in such a desper adventur depend upon a
string of hypothes long enough to reach from where we were to
capetown our case wa an excel exampl of the old proverb
if if and and made pot and pan
there be no work for tinker hand
if the cano came if it wait off the rock if han could swim
out to it without be observ and get aboard if he could
persuad those fetishridden walloo to come to take us off if we
could carri out our littl game about the powder undetect if the
powder went off all right and broke up the sluicehandl as per our
plan if we could free sabeela from the post if she did not plai
the fool in some femal fashion if blackguard of sort did not
manag to cut our throat dure all these oper and a score of
other if why then our pot and pan would be satisfactorili
manufactur and perhap the priest of heuheu would be
satisfactorili frighten awai or drown as it wa it look to me
as though so far from not get ani rest that night we should
slumber more soundli than ever we did beforein the last long sleep
of all
well it could not be help so i just fell back upon my favourit
fatal said my prayer and went off to sleep which thank god i
can do at ani time and under almost ani circumst had it not been
for that gift i should have been dead long ago
when i woke up it wa dark and i found dramana stand over me
inde it wa her entri that rous me i look at my watch and
discov to my surpris that it wa past ten oclock at night
why did you not wake me befor i said to han
what wa the us baa see that there wa noth to be done and
it is dull to be idl without a drop to drink
that what he said but the fact wa that he had been fast asleep
himself well i wa thank as thu we got rid of mani weari hour
of wait
suddenli i made up my mind to tell dramana everyth and did so
there wa someth about thi woman that made me trust her also
obvious she wa mad with desir to escap from dacha whom she
hate and who hate her and had determin to murder her as soon as he
had obtain possess of sabeela
she listen and stare at me amaz at the bold of my plan
it mai all end well she said though there is the magic of the
priest to be fear which mai tell them thing that their ey do not
see
i will risk the magic i said
there is also anoth thing she went on we cannot get into the
place where the stone gate is which you would destroi as i wa
bidden when i went back to the cave i gave up the bag in which i
carri the kei and that of heuheu garden to dacha and he ha put
it awai i know not where the door is veri strong lord and cannot
be broken down and if i went to ask dacha for the kei again he would
guess all especi as the water is rise more fast than it ever
rose befor in the memori of man and priest have been to make sure
that the stone gate is fix so that it cannot be movedy and
bound down the handl with rope
now i sat still not know what to sai for i had overlook thi
matter of the kei while i did so i heard han chuckl idiot
what ar you laugh at you littl donkei i ask is it a time
to laugh when all our plan have come to noth
no baa or rather ye baa you see baa i guess that
someth of thi sort might happen so just in case it should i
took the kei out of the ladi dramana bag and put in a stone of about
the same weight in place of it here it is and from hi pocket he
produc that ponder and archaic lockopen instrument
that wa wise onli you sai dramana that the priest have been to
the shed how did thei get in without the kei i ask
lord there ar two kei he who is call the watcher of the gate
ha on of hi own accord to hi oath he carri it about him all
dai at hi girdl and sleep with it at night the kei i had wa that
of the high priest who us it and other that he mai look into all
thing when he pleas though thi he doe seldom if ever
so far so good then dramana have you aught to tell us
ye lord you will do well to escap from thi island tonight if
you can sinc at todai council an oracl ha gone forth from heu
heu that you and your companion ar to be sacrif at the bridal
feast tomorrow it is an offer to the wooddwel who now know
that the woman wa kill by you on the river and sai that if you ar
allow to live thei will not fight against the walloo i think also
that i am to be sacrif with you
ar we inde i said reflect to myself that ani scrupl i
might have had as to attempt to drown out these fanat brute
were now extinct for reason which quit satisfi my conscienc i
did not intend to be sacrif if i could help it then or at ani
futur time and evid the best wai to prevent thi would be to
give the prospect sacrific a dose of their own medicin from
that moment i becam as ruthless as han himself
now i understood why we were be treat with so much courtesi and
allow to see everyth we wish it wa to lull our suspicion
what did it matter how much we learn if within a few hour we were
to be sent to a land whenc we could commun it to no on els
i ask more particularli about thi oracl but onli got answer from
dramana that i could not understand it appear howev that as she
said it had undoubtedli been issu in repli to prayer from the
savag hairi folk who demand satisfact for the death of their
countrywoman on the river and threaten rebellion if it were not
grant thi explain everyth and realli the detail did not
matter
have collect all the inform i could we sat down to supper
dure which dramana told us incident that it had been arrang
that our arm which were known to spit out fire should be stolen
from us while we slept befor dawn so as to make us helpless when we
were seiz
so it came to thi if we were to act at all it must be at onc
i at as much as i wa abl becaus food give strength and han did
the same inde i am sure that he would have made an excel meal
even in sight of the noos which hi neck wa about to occupi eat and
drink for tomorrow we die would have been hanss favourit motto if
he had known it as perhap he did inde we did drink also of some
of the nativ liquor which dramana had brought with her sinc i
thought that a moder amount of alcohol would do us both good
especi han who had the prospect of a cold swim befor him
immedi i had swallow the stuff i regret it sinc it
occur to me that it might be drug howev it wa not dramana
had seen to that
when we had finish our food we pack up our small belong in the
most conveni wai we could on half of these i gave to dramana to
carri as she wa a strong woman and of cours as he had to swim
han could be burden with noth except hi pistol and the bundl
of twig from the tree of illus which we thought might help both
to support and to conceal him in the water
then about eleven oclock we start throw over our head goatskin
rug that had serv for cover on our bed to make us resembl
those anim if that were possibl
chapter xiii
the terribl night
leav the hous veri softli we found that the torrenti rain had
dwindl to a kind of heavi drizzl which thicken the air while on
the surfac of the lake and the lowli cultiv land there hung a
heavi mist thi of cours wa veri favour to us sinc even if
there were watcher about thei could not see us unless we stumbl
right into them
as a matter of fact i think that there wa none all the popul of
the place be collect at the ceremoni in the cave we neither saw
nor heard anybodi not even a dog bark for these anim of which
there were few on the island were sleep in the hous out of the
wet and cold abov the mist howev the great full moon shone in a
clear sky which suggest that the weather wa mend as in fact
prove to be the case the tempest of rain which we learn
afterward had rage for month with some interv of fine weather
have worn itself out at last
we reach the sluic hous and to our surpris found that the door
wa unlock suppos that it had been left thu through
careless by the inspect priest we enter softli and close
it behind us then i lit a candl some of which i alwai carri with
me and held it up that we might look about us next moment i step
back horrorstruck for there on the cope of the water shaft sat a
man with a great spear in hi hand
whilst i wonder what to do stare at thi man who seem to be
half asleep and even more frighten than i wa myself with the
greater quick of the savag han act he sprang at the fellow
as a leopard spring i think he drew hi knife but i am not sure at
ani rate i heard a blow and then the light of the candl shone upon
the sole of the man feet as he vanish backward into the pit of
water what happen to him there i do not know so far as we were
concern he vanish for ever
how is thi you told us no on would be here i said to dramana
savag for i suspect a trap
she fell upon her knee think probabl that i wa go to kill
her with the man spear which i had pick up and answer
lord i do not know i suppos that the priest grew suspici and
set on of their number to watch or it mai have been becaus of the
great flood which is rise fast
believ her explan i told her to rise and we set to work
have fasten the door from within han climb up the lever and
by the light of the candl which could not betrai us as there were
no window to the shed fix the two flask of powder in the hole in
the stone gate immedi beneath the pin of the lever then as we
had arrang he wedg them tight with pebbl that we had brought
with us
thi done i procur a quantiti of the sticki clai with which the
wall of the shed were plaster take it from a spot where the damp
had come through and made it moist thi clai we stuck all over the
flask and the stone to a thick of sever inch onli
immedi beneath the pin we left an open hope therebi to
concentr the forc of the explos on it and on the upper rim of
the hole that wa bore through the sluic gate the slow match
which now were dry we insert in the hole we had made in the
flask bring them out through the clai encas in two long hollow
reed that we had drawn from the roof of our hous where we lodg
hope thu to keep the damp awai from them
thu arrang their end hung to within six feet of the ground where
thei could easili be light even in a hurri
by now it wa a quarter past eleven and the most terribl and
danger part of our task must be face lift the corps of the
dead woman who had been kill presum by a blow from the lever
that morn han and idramana would not touch herbor her out of
the shed follow by dramana with all our good for we dare not
leav them behind as our retreat might be cut off we carri her
with infinit labour for she wa veri heavi some fifti yard to a
spot i had note dure our examin in the morn at the edg of
the rock of offer which spot fortun rose to a height of six
feet or rather less abov the level of the surround ground here
there wa a littl hollow in the rock face wash out by the action of
water a small roofless caviti larg enough to shelter the three of
us and the corps as well
in thi place we hid for there fortun the shape of the
surround rock cut off the glare from the two etern fire which
in so much wet seem to be burn dulli and with a good deal of
smoke the nearer of them at a distanc of not more than a dozen pace
from us the post to which the victim wa to be ti wa perhap the
length of a cricket pitch awai
in thi hide hole we could scarc be discov unless by ill
fortun someon walk right on to the top of us or approach from
behind we crouch down and wait a while later shortli befor
midnight in the great still we heard a sound of paddl on the
lake the cano wa come a minut afterward we distinguish the
voic of men talk quit close to us
lift my head i peer veri cautious over the top of the rock a
larg cano wa approach the land step or rather where these
had been for now except the topmost thei were under water becaus
of the flood on the rock itself four priest clad in white and
wear veil over their face with eyehol cut in them which made
them look like monk in old pictur of the spanish inquisit were
march toward these step as thei reach them so did the cano
next from it prow wa thrust a tall woman entir drape in a
white cloak that cover both head and bodi who from her height might
veri well be sabeela
the priest receiv her without a word for all thi drama wa
enact in utter silenc and half led half carri her to the stone
post between the fire where so far as i could see through the mist
that night i bless the mist as we do in church in on of the
psalmsno it is the mist that bless the lord but it doe not
matterthei bound her to the post then still in utter silenc thei
turn and march awai down the slope rock to the mouth of the
cave where thei vanish the cano also paddl backward a few
yardsnot far i judg from the number of stroke takenand there
float quietli
so far all had happen as dramana told us that it must in a whisper
i ask her if the priest would return she answer no no on would
come on to the rock till sunris when heuheu accompani by women
would issu from the cave to take hi bride she swore that thi wa
true sinc it wa the greatest of crime for ani on to look upon the
holi bride between the time that she wa bound to the rock and the
appear of the sun abov the horizon
then the sooner we get to busi the better i said set my
teeth and without stop to ask her what she meant by sai that
heuheu would come with the women when as we knew well there wa no
such person
come on han while the mist still li thick it mai lift at ani
moment i ad
swiftli desper we clamber on to the rock drag the dead
woman after us stagger round the nearer fire with our aw
burden we arriv with it behind the postit seem to take an ag
here by the merci of provid the smoki reek from the fire propel
by a slight breath of air combin with the hang fog to make us
almost invis on the farther side of the post stood sabeela
bound her head drop forward as though she were faint han
swore that it wa sabeela becaus he knew her by her smell which
wa just like him but i could not be sure be less gift in that
wai howev i risk it and spoke to her though doubtfulli for i
did not like the look of her to tell the truth i rather fear lest
she should have act on her threat that as a last resourc she would
take the poison which she said she carri hidden in her hair
sabeela do not start or cry out sabeela it is we the lord
watcherbynight and he who is name lightindark come to save
you i said and wait anxious wonder whether i should ever
hear an answer
present i gave a sigh of relief for she move her head slightli and
murmur
i dream i dream
nai i answer you do not dream or if you do ceas from
dream lest we should all sleep for ever
then i crept round the post and bade her tell me where wa the knot by
which the rope about her wa fasten she nod downward with her
head with her hand she could not point becaus thei were ti and
mutter in a shaken voic
at my feet lord
i knelt down and found the knot sinc if i cut the rope we should
have noth with which to tie the bodi to the post fortun it
wa not drawn tight becaus thi wa thought unnecessari as no holi
bride had ever been known to attempt to escap therefor although my
hand were cold i wa abl to loos it without much difficulti a
minut later sabeela wa free and i had cut the lash which bound
her arm next came a more difficult matter that of set the dead
woman in her place for be dead all her weight came upon the
rope howev han and i manag it somehow have first thrown
sabeela cloak and veil over her ici form and face
hope heuheu will think her nice whisper han as we cast an
anxiou look at our handiwork
then all be done we retreat as we had come bend low to keep
our bodi in the layer of the mist which now wa thin and hung
onli about three feet abov the ground like an autumn fog on an
england marsh we reach our hole han bundl sabeela over it
edg unceremoni so that she fell on to the back of her sister
dramana who crouch in it terrifi never i think did two
tragic separ relat have a stranger meet i wa the last
of our parti and as i wa slide into the hollow i took a good look
round
thi is what i saw out of the mouth of the cave emerg two priest
thei ran swiftli up the gentl slope of rock till thei reach the two
column of burn natur ga or petroleum or whatev it wa on of
them halt by each column here thei wheel round and through the
hole in their mask or veil stare at the victim bound to the post
appar what thei saw satisfi them for after on glanc thei
wheel about and ran back to the cave as swiftli as thei had come
but in a method manner which show no surpris or emot
what doe thi mean dramana i exclaim you told me that it wa
against the law for ani on to look upon the holi bride until the
moment of sunris
i dont know lord she answer certainli it is against the law
i suppos that the divin must have felt that someth wa wrong
and sent out messeng to report as i have told you the priest of
heuheu ar master of magic lord
then thei ar bad master for thei have found out noth i
remark indiffer
but in my heart i wa more thank than word can tell that i had
persist in the idea of lash the dead woman to the post in place
of sabeela whilst we were drag her from the shed and again when
we were lift her out of the hole on to the rock han had suggest
that thi wa unnecessari sinc dramana had vow that no man ever
look upon the holi bride between her arriv upon the rock and the
moment of sunris and that all we need to do wa to loos sabeela
fortun some provid warn me against give wai had i done
so all would have been discov and humanli speak we must have
perish probabl thi would have happen even had i not rememb
to run back and pick up the piec of cord that i had cut from
sabeela wrist and left ly on the rock sinc the messeng
might have seen them and guess a trick as it wa so far we were
safe
now han i said the time ha come for you to swim to the cano
which you must do quickli for the mist seem to be melt beneath
the moon and otherwis you mai be seen
no baa i shall not be seen for i shall put that bundl from the
tree of dream on my head which will make me look like float
weed baa but would not the baa like perhap to go himself he
swim better than i do and doe not mind cold so much also he is
clever and the walloo fool in the boat will listen to him more than
thei will to me and if it come to shoot he is a better shot i
think too that i can look after the ladi sabeela and the other ladi
and know how to fire a slow match as well as he can
no i answer it is too late to chang our plan though i wish i
were go to get into that boat instead of you for i should feel
happier there
veri good baa the baa know best he repli resignedli then
quit indiffer to convent han strip himself place hi
dirti cloth insid the mat in which wa wrap the bundl of twig
from the tree of illus becaus as he said it would be nice to
have dry thing to put on when he reach the boat or the next world
he did not know which
these prepar made have fasten the bundl on to hi head by
the help of the bond which we had cut off sabeela hand that i
ti for him beneath hi armpit he start shiver a hideou
shrivel yellow object first howev he kiss my hand and ask
me whether i had ani messag for my reverend father in the place of
fire where he remark it would be at ani rate warmer than it
wa here also he declar that he thought that the ladi sabeela wa
not worth all the troubl we were take about her especi as she
wa go to marri someon els lastli he said with emphasi that if
ever we got out of thi countri he intend to get drunk for two
whole dai at the first town we came to where gin could be broughta
promis i rememb that he kept veri faithfulli then he sneak
down the side of the rock and hold hi revolv and littl buckskin
cartridg case abov hi head glide into the water as silent as
doe an otter
by now as i have said the mist wa varnish rapidli perhap befor
a draught of air which drew out of the east as i have notic it
often doe in those part of africa between midnight and sunris even
on still night on the face of the water it still hung howev so
that through it i could onli discov the faint outlin of the cano
about a hundr yard awai
present with a beat heart i observ that someth wa
happen there sinc the cano seem to turn round and i thought
that i heard astonish voic speak in it and saw peopl stand
up then there wa a splash and onc more all becam still and silent
evid han reach the boat safe though whether he had enter
it i could not tell i could onli wonder and hope
as we could do no good by remain in our present most danger
posit i set out to return to the sluic shed where other matter
press carri all our gear as befor but thank good without
the encumbr of the corps sabeela seem to be still half daze
so at present i did not try to question her dramana took her left arm
and i her right and support her thu we ran doubl up back to
the shed and enter it in safeti leav the two women here i went
out on to the littl pier and crouch at the top of the fishermen
step watch and wait for the come of han with the cano to
take us off for as you mai rememb the arrang wa that i wa
not to fire the slow match until it had arriv
no cano appear dure all the long hoursthei seem an etern
befor the break of the dawn did i wait and watch return now
and again to the shed to make sure that dramana and sabeela were safe
on on of these visit i learn that both her father the walloo and
issicor were in the cano which made it nonarriv not to be
explain that is if han reach it safe but if he had not or
perhap had been kill or met with some other accid in attempt
to board it then the explan wa easi enough as her crew would
not know our plight or that we were wait to be rescu lastli thei
might have refus to make the attemptfor religi reason
the problem wa agon befor long there would be light and
without doubt we should be discov and kill perhap by tortur
on the other hand if i fire the powder the nois of the explos
would probabl be heard in which case also we should be discov
yet there wa an argument for do thi sinc then if thing went
well the water would rush in and give those priest someth to
think about that would take their mind off hunt for and captur
us
i look about me the cano wa invis in the mist it might be
there or it might be gone onli if it were gone and han were still
aliv i wa certain that as arrang to advis me he would have
fire hi pistol which to keep the cartridg dry he had carri
abov hi head in hi left hand inde i thought it probabl that
rather than desert me thu he would have swum back to the island so
that we might see the busi through togeth the longer i ponder
all these and other possibl the more confus i grew and the
more despair evid someth had happen but whatwhat
the water continu to rise now all the step were cover and it wa
within an inch or two of the surfac of the pier on which i must
crouch it wa a mighti flood that look as though present it would
begin to flow over the top of the sea wall in which case the sluic
shed would undoubtedli be inund and made uninhabit
as i think i told you a few yard to our right rise abov the top
of the sea wall to a height of seven or eight feet wa a great rock
that had the appear of a boulder eject at some time from the
crater of the volcano which rock would be easi to climb and wa larg
enough to accommod the three of us moreov no flood could reach
it top sinc to do so it must cover the land beyond to a depth of
mani feet consid it and everyth els suddenli i came to a
conclus so suddenli inde and so fixedli that i felt as though it
were inspir by some outsid influenc
i would bring the women out and make them lie down upon the top of
that boulder trust to dramana dark cloak to hide them from
observ even in that brilliant moonlight then i would return to
the shed and set light to the match and after i had done thi join
them upon the rock whenc we could see all that happen and watch
for the cano though of thi i had begun to despair
abandon all doubt and hesit i set to work to carri out thi
scheme with cold yet frantic energi i fetch the two sister who
imagin that relief wa in sight came readili enough made them
clamber up the rock and lie down there on their face throw
dramana larg dark cloak over both of them and our belong then
i went back to the shed struck a light and appli it to the end of
the slow match that began to smoulder well and clearli rush
from the shed i lock the heavi door and sped back to the rock
which i climb
five minut pass and just as i wa begin to think that the
match had fail in some wai i heard a heavi thud it wa not veri
loud inde at a distanc of even fifti yard i doubt whether ani
on would have notic it unless hi attent were on the strain
that shed wa well built and roof and smother sound also thi
on had noth of the crack of a rifl about it but rather resembl
that which is caus by someth heavi fall to the ground
after thi for a while noth particular happen present
howev look down from my rock i saw that the water in the sluic
which be retain by the stone door in the shed hitherto had been
still wa now run like a mill race and with a thrill of triumph
learn that i had succeed
the sluic wa down and the flood wa rush over it
watch intent a minut or so later i observ a stone fall from
the cope of the channel for it wa full to the brim then anoth
and anoth till present the whole work seem to melt awai where
it had been wa now a great and evergrow gap in the sea wall
through which the swollen water of the lake pour ceaselessli and
increasingli next instant the shed vanish like a card hous it
foundat be wash out and i perceiv that over it site and
beyond it a verit river on the face of which float portion of
it roof wa fast inund the lowli land behind that had been
protect by the wall
i look at the east it wa lighten for now the black of the
sky where it seem to meet the great lake had turn to grei the
dawn wa at hand
with a steadi roar through the gap in the sea wall which grew wider
everi moment the water rush in remorseless inexhaust the
aspect of them wa terrifi now our rock wa a littl island
surround by a sea and now in the east appear the first rai from
the unrisen sun stab the rainwash sky like a giant spear it
wa a wondrou spectacl and think that probabl it wa the last i
should ever wit upon earth i observ it with great interest
by thi time the women at my side were sob with terror believ
that thei were go to be drown as i wa of the same opinion for
i felt our rock trembl beneath us as though it were about to turn
over or wash from it foundat to sink into some bottomless
gulf and could do noth to help them i pretend to take no notic
of their terror but onli stare toward the east
it wa just then that emerg out of the mist on the face of the
water within a few yard of us i saw the cano hear the sound of
the paddl i could not becaus of the roar of the rush water in
it at the stern with hi pistol held to the head of the steersman
stood han
i rose up and he saw me then i made sign to him which wai he should
come keep the cano straight over the crest of the broken wall
where the water wa shallow it wa a danger busi for everi
moment i thought it would overset or be suck into the torrent
beyond where the sluic channel had been but those walloo were
clever with their paddl and hanss pistol gave them much
encourag
now the prow of the cano grate against the rock and han who had
scrambl forward threw me a rope i held it with on hand and with
the other thrust down the shrink women he seiz them and bundl
them into the cano like sack of corn next i threw in our gear and
then sprang wildli myself for i felt our stone turn i half fell
into the water but han and someon els grip me and i wa drag
in over the gunwal anoth instant and the rock had vanish beneath
the yellow yeasti flood
the cano oscil and began to spin round happili it wa larg and
strong with at least a score of rower be hollow from a singl
huge tree han shriek direct and the paddler paddl as never
thei had done befor for quit a minut our fate hung doubt for
the torrent wa suck at us and we did not seem to gain an inch at
last howev we move forward a littl toward the rock of
sacrific thi time and with sixti second were safe and out of the
reach of the landward rush of the water
why did you not come befor han i ask
oh baa becaus these fool would not move until thei saw the first
light and when the walloo and issicor want to told them that thei
would kill them thei said it wa against their law baa
curs them all for ten gener i exclaim then wa silent
for what wa the us of argu with such a superstitionridden set
superstit is still king of most of the world though often it call
itself religion these walloo thought themselv veri religi
inde
thu end that terribl night
chapter xiv
the end of heuheu
opposit to the rock of offer the cano came to a standstil quit
close to the edg of the rock i inquir why and the old walloo who
sat in the middl of the boat drape in wondrou and imperi garment
and a headdress that have work itself to on side in the cours
of our struggl made him look as though he were drunk answer
feebli
becaus it is our law lord our law bid us wait till the sun
appear and the glori of heuheu come forth to take the holi bride
well i answer as the holi bride is sit in thi boat with
her head upon my knee thi wa true becaus sabeela had insist
upon stick to me as the onli person upon whom she could reli and
so for the matter of that had dramana for her head wa on my
other knee i should recommend the glori of heuheu whatev that
mai be not to come here to look for her unless inde it want a
hole as big as my fist blown through it i ad with emphasi
tap my doublebarrel express which wa by my side safe in it
waterproof case
yet we must wait lord answer the walloo humbl for i see that
there is still a holi bride ti to the post and until she is loos
our law sai that we mai not go awai
ye i exclaim the holiest of all bride for she is stone dead
and all the dead ar holi well wait if you like for i want to see
what happen and i think thei cant get at us here
so we hung upon our oar or rather paddl and wait till
present the rim of the red sun appear and reveal the strangest
of scene the water of the lake swollen by week of continu rain
and the recent tempest flow in with a steadi rush that somehow
remind me of the order advanc of an infinit armi through the
great gap in the lake wall that wa broaden minut by minut
beneath it devour bitei there anyth so mighti as water in
the world i wonderhad now flood most of the cultiv land to a
depth of sever feet
as yet howev it had not reach the hous built against the
mountain in on of which we had been lodg nor had it overflow
the great rock of offer which you will rememb stood about the
height of a man abov the level of the plain be in fact a larg
slab of consolid lava that onc had flow from the crater into
the lake in a glacierlik stream of limit breadth it is true that
the circumst that the rock slope downward to the cave mouth
seem to contradict that theori but thi i attribut to some
subsequ subsid at it base such as often happen in volcan
area where hidden forc ar at work beneath the surfac of the
earth
well i repeat the rock wa not yet flood and so it came about
that at the proper moment as had happen on thi dai perhap for
hundr of year heuheu emerg from the cave to claim hi holi
bride
how could he do that ask good triumphantli think i suppos
that he had caught allan trip you said that heuheu wa a
statu so how could he come out of the cave
doe not it occur to you good ask allan that a statu is
sometim carri howev in thi case it wa not so for heuheu
himself walk out of that cave follow by a number of women with
some of the hairi folk behind them and look at him as he stalk
along hideou and gigant i understood two thing the first of
these wa how it came about that sabeela had vow to me that mani
had seen heuheu with their ey as issicor also declar he had
done himself walk stiffli the second why it wa a law that the
cano which brought the holi bride should wait until she wa remov
at dawn name in order that those in it might behold heuheu and go
back to their land to testifi to hi bodili exist even if thei
were not allow to give detail as to hi appear becaus to
speak of thi would thei believ bring a curs upon them
but there wasnt a heuheu object good again
good said allan realli you ar what han call mequit clever
with extraordinari acumen you have arriv at the truth there wasnt
a heuheu but good if you live long enough he went on with a
gentl sarcasm which show that he wa annoi ye if you live
long enough you will learn that thi world is full of decept and
that the tree of illus doe not or rather did not grow onli in
heuheu garden as you sai no heuheu exist but there did exist
an excel copi of him made up with a skill worthi of a highclass
pantomim artist so excel inde that from fifti yard or so
awai it wa imposs to tell the differ between it and the
great origin as depict in the cave
there in all hi hairi grin horror walk stiffli march
heuheu eleven or twelv feet high or to come to the fact there
march dacha on stilt artist drape in dy skin and wear
on the top of or over hi head a wickerwork and canva or cloth mask
beautifulli paint to resembl the featur of hi amiabl god
the piou crew of our boat saw him and bow their classic head in
rever to the divin even issicor bow a perform that i
observ caus dramana ye and the love sabeela herself to
favour him with glanc of indign not unmix with contempt at
least thi wa certainli the case with dramana who had live behind
the scene but sabeela mai have been move by other reflect
perhap she still believ that there wa a heuheu and that
issicor would have done better to show himself less devot to these
religi observ and less will to surrend her to the god
divin attent you mai all have notic that howev piousli
dispos there is a point at which the major of women becom veri
practic inde
meanwhil heuheu stalk forward with a gait that might veri
liter be call stilt and the bevi of whiterob ladi
follow after him appar sing a bridal song while behind
these mope and mow came their hairi attend by the aid of
my glass howev i could see that these ladi at ani rate were
not enjoi the entertain whatev mai have been the case with
dacha insid hi past board thei stare at the rise water and on
of them turn to run but wa drag back into place by her
companion for probabl on thi solemn occas flight wa a capit
offenc so on thei came till thei reach the post to which we had
ti the dead woman whereon accord to custom the bridesmaid
skip up to releas her while the hairi folk rang themselv
behind
next moment i saw the first of these bridesmaid suddenli stand still
and stare then she emit a yell so terrif that it echo all over
the lake like the blast of a train the other stare also and in
their turn began to yell then heuheu himself ambl round and
appar had a look a good look for by now someon had torn awai
the veil which i had thrown over the corps head he did not look
long for next moment he wa leg or rather stilt back to the
cave as fast as he could go
thi wa too much for me by my side wa my doublebarrel express
rifl load with expand bullet i drew it from it case lift
it and got a bead on to heuheu just abov where i guess the head
of the man within to be for i did not want to kill the brute but onli
to frighten him by now the light wa good and so wa my aim for a
moment later the expand bullet hit in the appoint spot and
clear awai all that top hamper of wicker and baboon skin or
whatev it mai have been never befor wa there such a sudden
disrob of an ecclesiast dignitari drape in all hi
trap
everyth seem to come off at onc as did dacha from hi stilt
for he went a most imperi crowner that must have flatten hi
hook nose upon that lava rock there he lai a moment then leav
hi stilt behind him he rose and fled after the scream women and
their apelik attend back into the cave
now i remark oracularli to the old walloo and the other who were
terrifi at the report of the rifl now my friend you see what
your god is made of
the walloo attempt no repli appar he wa too astonish
disillusion is often pain you knowbut on of hi compani who
seem to be a kind of offici timekeep said that the sun be up
and the holi bridal be accomplish though strang it wa
law for them to return home
no you dont i answer i have wait here a long time for you
and now you shall wait a littl while for me as i want to see what
happen
the timekeep howev a man of routin if on devoid of curios
dip hi paddl into the water as a signal to the other rower to do
likewis whereon han hit him hard over the finger with the butt of
hi revolv and then held it barrel to hi head
thi argument convinc him that obedi wa best and he drew in
the paddl as did the other make polit apolog to han
so we remain where we were and watch
there wa lot to see for by now the water wa begin to run over
the rock it reach the etern fire with the result that thei
ceas to be etern for thei went out in cloud of smoke and steam
three minut later it wa pour in a cataract down the slope into
the mouth of the cave befor i could count a hundr peopl began to
come out of that cave in the greatest of hurri as wasp do if you
stir up their nest with a stick among them i recognis dacha who
had a veri good idea of look after himself
he and the first of those who follow wade through the water got
clear and began to scrambl up the mountainsid behind but the rest
were not so fortun for by now the stream wa sever feet deep and
thei could not fight it for a moment thei appear struggl amid
the foam and bubbl then thei were swept back into the mouth of the
cave and gather to the breast of heuheu for the last time next as
though at a signal all the hous includ that in which we had
been lodg crumbl awai togeth thei just collaps and vanish
everyth seem finish and i wonder whether i would put a bullet
into dacha who now wa stand on a ridg of rock and wring hi
hand as he watch the destruct of hi templ hi god hi town
hi women and hi servant conclud that i would not for
someth seem to tell me to leav thi wick rascal to destini i
wa about to give the order to paddl awai when han call to me to
look at the mountain top
i did so and observ that from it wa rush a great cloud of
steam such as come from a railwai engin when it is stand still
with too much heat in it boiler but multipli a millionfold
moreov as the engin scream in such circumst so did the
mountain scream or rather roar emit a volum of sound that wa
aw to hear
what up now han i shout
dont know baa think that water and fire ar have a talk
togeth insid that mountain baa and sai thei hate each other
just like badli marri man and woman who quarrel in a small hut
baa and cant get out hiss spit go woman pop bang go man
here he paus from hi nonsens stare at the mountain top with all
hi ey then repeat in a slow voic ye pop bang go man just
look at him baa
at thi moment with an amaz nois like to that of a magnifi
thunderclap the volcano seem to split in two and the crest of it to
fly off into space
baa said han i am call lordofthefir am i not well i am
not lord of that fire and i think that the farther off we get from it
the safer we shall be allemagt look there and he point to a
huge mass of flame lava which appear to descend from the cloud
and plung into the lake about a coupl of hundr yard awai send
up a fountain of steam and foam like a torpedo when it burst
paddl for your live i shout to the walloo who began to get
the cano about in a veri great hurri
as she came roundit seem to take an agei saw a strang and in a
wai a terribl sight dacha had left hi ledg and wa run down
into the lake follow by a stream of molten lava danc while he
ran as though with pain probabl becaus the stream had scorch
him he plung into the water and just then a great wave form
driven outward doubtless by some subterranean explos it rush
toward us and on it veri crest wa dacha
i think that priest want us to give him a row baa said han he
ha had enough of hi happi island home and wish to live on the
mainland
doe he i repli well there is no room in the cano and i
drew my pistol
the wave bore dacha quit close to us he rear himself in the water
or more probabl wa lift up by the pressur underneath so that
almost he appear to be stand on the crest of the wave he saw us
he shout curs upon us and shook hi fist appar at sabeela
and issicor it wa a horribl sight
han howev wa not affect for by wai of repli he point first
to me then to sabeela and lastli to himself after which such wa
hi unconquer vulgar he put hi thumb to hi nose and as
schoolboi sai cock a snook at the struggl high priest
the wave becam a hollow and dacha disappear to look for heuheu
as han remark that wa the end of thi cruel but abl man
i am glad said han after reflect that the predik dacha
should have learn who sent him down to heuheu befor he went there
which he knew well enough or he would not have been so cross baa
ha it occur to the baa what clever peopl we ar all of whose
plan have succeed so nice at on time i thought that thing were
go wrong it wa after i scrambl into thi cano and those fool
would not move to fetch you and the women becaus thei said it wa
against their law while i wa put on my cloth which got here
quit dry becaus i wa so care baa for i had ask them to
paddl to fetch you while i wa still nake and been told that thei
would not i wonder whether i should try to make them do so by
shoot on of them onli i thought that i had better wait a while
baa and see what happen becaus if i shot on the other might
have becom more stupid and obstin than befor and perhap have
paddl awai after thei had kill me so i wait which the baa
will admit wa the best thing to do and everyth came right in the
end have doubtless been arrang by your reverend father watch
us in the sky
ye han but if you had made up your mind otherwis whom would you
have shot i ask the walloo
no baa becaus he is old and stupid as a dead owl i should have
shot issicor becaus he tire me so much and i should like to save
the ladi sabeela from be made weari for mani year what is the
good of a man baa who when he think hi girl is be given over
to a devil sit in a boat and groan and sai that ancient law must
not be broken lest a curs should follow he did that baa when i
ask him to order the men to row to the step
i dont know han it is a matter for them to settl between them
isnt it
ye baa and when the ladi ha got her mind again and at last that
hour come as it alwai doe when there is someth to pai baa i
shall be sorri for issicor for i dont think he will look so pretti
when she ha done with him no i think that when he sai kiss
kiss she will answer smack smack on both side of hi head
baa look she ha turn her back on him alreadi well baa it
doesnt matter to me or to you either who have the ladi dramana
there to deal with she isnt turn her back baa she is eat
you up with her ey and sai in her heart that at last she ha
found a heuheu worth someth even though he be small and wither
and ugli with hair that stick up it is what is in a man that
matter baa not what he look like outsid as women often us to
sai to me when i wa young baa
here with an exclam that i need not repeat for none of us realli
like to have our person appear reflect upon by a candid
friend howev faith i lift the butt of my rifl purpos to
drop it gentli on hanss toe at that point howev my attent
wa divert from thi rubbish which wa hanss wai of show hi
joi at our escap by anoth blaze boulder which fell quit near to
the cano and immedi afterward by the terrif spectacl of the
final dissolut of the volcano
i dont know exactli what happen but sheet of waver flame and
cloud of steam ascend high into the heaven these were accompani
by earthshak rumbl and aw explos that resound like
the loudest thunder each of them follow by the eject of shower
of blaze stone and the rush out of torrent of molten lava which
ran into the lake make it hiss and boil after thi came tidal
wave that caus our cano to rock peril dens cloud of ash
and a kind of hot rain which darken the air so much that for a while
we could see noth no not for a yard befor our nose altogeth
it wa a most terrifi exhibit of the forc of natur which by
some connect of idea made me think of the dai of judgment
heuheu aveng himself upon us wail the old walloo becaus we
have rob him of hi holi bride
here hi speech came to an end for a good reason sinc a larg hot
stone fell upon hi head and as han who wa next to him explain
through the fog squash him like a beetl
when from the outcri of hi follow sabeela realiz that her father
wa dead for he never move or spoke again she seem to wake up in
good earnest just as though she felt that the mantl of author had
fallen upon her
throw that hot coal out of the boat she said lest it burn through
the bottom and we sink
with the help of a paddl issicor obei her and the bodi of the
walloo have been cover up with a cloak we row on desper
by good fortun about thi time a strong wind began to blow from the
shore toward the island which kept back or drove awai the hot rain
and pumic dust so that we could onc more see about us now our onli
danger wa from the rock such as that which had kill the walloo
that fell into the water all around send up spout of foam it wa
just as though we were under heavi bombard but happili no more of
them hit the cano and as we got farther off the island the risk
becam less as we found afterward howev some of them were thrown
as far as the mainland
still there wa on more peril to be pass for suddenli we ran into
a whole fleet of rude cano or rather bundl of reed and brushwood
or sometim log sharpen at both end by fire on each of which on
of the hairi savag sat astrid direct it with a doubleblad
paddl
i presum that these peopl must have been a conting of the
aborigin woodfolk who had start for the island in obedi to
the summon of heuheu where as i have told a great number of them
were alreadi gather preparatori to attack the town of walloo or
thei mai have been escap from the island realli i do not know on
thing wa clear howev low thei mai have been in the scale of
human thei were sharp enough to connect us with the aw natur
catastroph that wa happen for squeak and jabber like so
mani great ap thei point to that vision of hell the flame
volcano now sink to dissolut and to us
then with their horribl yell of heuheu heuheu thei set to work
to attack us
there wa onli on thing to be doneopen fire on them which han and
i did with effect and meanwhil try to escap by our superior speed
i am bound to sai that those hideou and miser creatur show
the greatest courag for undet by the sight of the death of
their companion whom our bullet struck thei tri to close upon us
with the object no doubt of overset the cano and drown us
all
han and i fire as rapidli as possibl but we could deal with onli a
tith of them so that speed and manoeuvr were our princip hope
sabeela stood up in the boat and cri direct to the paddler
while han and i shot first with the rifl and then with our
revolv
still on huge gorillalik fellow whose hair grew down to hi
beetl eyebrow got hold of the gunwal and began to pull the cano
over we could not shoot him becaus both rifl and revolv were
empti nor did our blow make him loosen hi grip the cano rock
from side to side increasingli and began to take in water
just as i fear that the end had come for more hairi men were almost
on to us sabeela save the situat in a bold and desper fashion
by her side lai the broad spear of that priest whom han had kill in
the sluic shed knock him backward into the water pit she seiz
it and with amaz strength stab the great beastlik creatur who
had hold of the cano and wa put all hi weight on it to forc
the gunwal under water he let go and sank by skil steer we
avoid the other and in three minut were clear of them sinc
thei could not keep pace with us on their rude craft
plenti to do tonight baa soliloqu han wipe hi brow
perhap if a crocodil doe not swallow us between here and the
shore or these fool do not sacrific us to the ghost of heuheu or
we ar not kill by lightn the baa will let me drink some of
that nativ beer when we get back to the town all thi fire about ha
made me veri thirsti
well we arriv there at lasta gener seem to have pass
sinc i left that quai which we found crowd with the entir terror
stricken popul of the place thei receiv the bodi of the walloo
in respect silenc but it seem to me without ani particular
grief inde these peopl appear to have outworn the acut human
emot all such extrem i suppos had been smooth awai from
their charact by time and by the degrad action of the vile
fetish under which thei live in short thei had becom mere
handsom human automata who walk about with their ear cock
listen for the voic of the god and catch it in everi natur
sound to tell the truth howev interest mai have been their
origin in their decad thei fill me with contempt
the reappear of sabeela astonish them veri much but seem to
caus no delight
she is the god wife i heard on of them sai it is becaus she
ha run awai from the god that all these misfortun have happen
she heard it also and round on them with spirit have by now quit
recov her nerv or so it seem which is more than could be said
of issicor who although he should have been wild with joi remain
depress and almost silent
what misfortun she ask my father is dead it is true kill
by a hot stone that fell upon him and i weep for him still he wa a
veri old man who must soon have pass awai for the rest is it a
misfortun that through the courag and power of these stranger i
hi daughter and heiress have been freed from the clutch of dacha
i tell you that dacha wa the god heuheu whom you worship wa but a
paint idol if you do not believ it ask the white lord here and
ask my sister dramana whom you seem to have forgotten who in past
year wa given to him as a holi bride is it a misfortun that dacha
and hi priest have been destroi and with him the most of the
savag hairi woodfolk our enemi is it a misfortun that the
hate smoke mountain should have melt awai in fire as it is
do now and with it the cave of mysteri out of which came so
mani oracl of terror thu fulfil the propheci that we should be
deliv from our burden by a white lord from the south
at these vigor word the frighten crowd grew silent and hung
their head sabeela look about her for a littl while then went
on
issicor my betroth come forward and tell the peopl you rejoic
that these thing have happen to save me from heuheu at my prayer
you travel far to ask succour of the great magician of the south
he ha sent the succour and i have been save yet you help to row
the boat which took me to the sacrific for that i do not blame you
becaus you must do so be of the rank you ar or be curs under
the ancient law now i have been save though not by you who
think the white lord dead upon the holi isl consent to my
surrend to the god and the law is at an end with the destruct of
heuheu and hi priest slain by the wisdom and might of that white
lord and hi companion tell them therefor how greatli you rejoic
that you have not journei in vain and thei did not listen in vain
to your petit for help that i stand befor them here also free and
undefil and that henceforth the land is rid of the curs of heu
heu ye tell the peopl these thing and give thank to the nobl
heart stranger who brought them to pass and save me with dramana
my sister
now tire out as i wa i watch issicor not without excit
for i wa curiou to hear what he had to sai well after a paus he
came forward and answer in a hesit voic
i do rejoic belov that you have return safe though i hope
when i led the white lord from the south that he would have save you
in some fashion other than by work sacrileg and kill the
priest of the god with fire and water men who from the begin
have been known to be divin you the ladi sabeela declar that heu
heu is dead but how know we that he is dead he is a spirit and can
a spirit die wa it a dead god who threw the stone that kill the
walloo and will he not perhap throw other stone that will kill us
and especi you ladi who have stood upon the rock of offer
wear the robe of the holi bride
baa inquir han reflect in the silenc which follow
these timor queri do you think that issicor is realli a man
or is he in truth but made of wood and paint to look like on as
dacha wa paint to look like heuheu
i thought that he wa a man yonder in the black kloof han i
answer but then he wa long wai off heuheu now i am not so sure
but perhap he is onli veri frighten and will come to himself by and
by
meanwhil sabeela wa look her extrem handsom lover up and
down up and down she look him and never a word did she sayat
least to him present howev she spoke to the crowd in a
command voic thu
take notic that my father be dead i am now the walloo and on
to be obei go about your task fear noth sinc heuheu is no
more and the most of the hairi folk ar slain i depart to rest
take with me these my guest and deliver and she point to me
and han afterward i will talk with you and with you also my lord
issicor bear the late walloo my father to the burial place of the
walloo
then she turn and follow by us and the member of her household
went to her home
here she bade us farewel for a while sinc we were all half dead
with fatigu and sore need rest as we part she took my hand
and kiss it thank me with tear well from her beauti ey
for all that i had done and dramana did likewis
how come it baa said han as we at food and drank of the nativ
beer befor we lai down to sleep that those ladi did not kiss my
hand see that i too have done someth to help them
becaus thei were too tire han i answer and made on kiss
serv for both of us
i see baa but i expect that tomorrow thei will still be too tire
to kiss poor old han
then he fill the cup out of which he had been drink with the last
of the liquor from the jar and empti it at a swallow there baa
he said that onli right you mai take all the kiss so long as i
get the beer
exhaust as i wa i could not help laugh although to tell the
truth i should have like anoth glass myself then i tumbl on to
the couch and instantli went to sleep
it is a fact that we slept all the rest of that dai and all the
follow night wake onli when the first rai of the sun shone into
our room through the window place at least i did for when i open
my ey feel a differ creatur and bless heaven for it gift
of sleep to man han wa alreadi up and engag in clean the
rifl and revolv
i look at the ugli littl hottentot reflect how wonder it wa
that so much courag cun and fidel should be pack awai
within hi yellow skin and project skull had it not been for han
without a doubt i should now be dead and the women also it wa he
who had conceiv the idea of let down the sluic gate by
explod gunpowd beneath the pin of the lever i had rack my
brain for expedi but thi the onli on possibl escap me how
tremend had been the result of that inspirational of them due
to han
although certain idea had occur to me the most that i had hope
to do wa to flood the lowli land and perhap the cave in order
to divert the attent of the priest while we were attempt
escap as it wa we had loos the forc of natur with the most
fear result the water had run down the venthol of the etern
fire and into the bowel of the volcano there to gener steam in
enorm volum of which the imprison strength had been so great
that it had rent the mountain like a rotten rag and destroi the home
of heuheu for ever and with it all hi votari
it wa a fear event in which i thought i saw the mind of provid
act through han ye the cun of the hottentot had been us
by the power abov to sweep from the earth a vile tyranni and to
destroi a bloodsoak idol and it worshipp
without a doubtor so i believ in my simpl faiththi had been
design from the begin when some escap follow of heuheu
paint the pictur in the bushmen cave probabl hundr of year
ago it wa alreadi design so wa zikali desir for a certain
medicin or hi insati thirst for knowledg or whatev it wa
that caus him to persuad me to undertak thi mission and so wa
all the rest of the stori
again with what wonder judgment han had act after hi brave
swim to the cano
had he tri to forc those fetishridden craven to come to our
rescu at onc as i direct him to do the probabl wa that
fear to break their silli law thei would have resist or perhap
have row right awai leav us to our fate after knock him on
the head with a paddl but he had the patienc to wait although as
he told me afterward hi heart wa torn in two with anxieti for my
sake balanc everyth in hi art and experienc mind he had
found patienc to wait until the condit of their law were
fulfil when thei came willingli enough
from han my thought turn to issicor how wa it that thi man
charact had chang so complet sinc he arriv in hi nativ
countri hi journei to seek aid made alon over hundr of mile
wa a realli remark perform show great courag and
determin also as a guid although silent and abstract he had
never lack for resourc or energi but from the dai that he arriv
home moral he had gone to piec it wa with the greatest
difficulti that he could be persuad to row us to the island where
at the first sign of danger he had left us to our fate and fled awai
again he had meekli help to conduct sabeela whom when he wa at
the black kloof evid he love to desper to her doom without
lift a finger to save her from a hideou destini lastli onli a
few hour ago he had made a pusillanim and contempt speech
which i could see shock and disgust hi betroth who for her
part after her rescu and the death of her father seem to have
gain the courag that he had lost and more
it wa inexplic at ani rate to me and in my bewilder i
refer the problem to han
he listen while i set out the case as it appear to me then
answer
the baa doe not keep hi ey openat ani rate in the daytim
when he think everyth is safe if he did he would understand why
issicor ha becom soft as a heat bar of iron what make men soft
baa
love i suggest
ye at time love make some men softi mean men like the baa and
what els baa
drink i answer savag get it back on han
ye at time drink make some men soft men like me baa who know
that now and again it is wise to ceas from be wise lest heaven
should grow jealou of our wisdom and want to share it but what make
all men soft
i dont know
then onc more i must teach the baa as hi reverend father the
predik told me to do when i saw that the baa had us up all hi
wit sai to me befor he di han whenev you perceiv that
my son allan who doe not alwai look where he is go walk into
water and get out of hi depth swim in and pull him out han
you littl liar i ejacul but take no notic han went on
baa it is fear that make all men soft issicor is bend about
like a heat ramrod becaus within him burn the fire of fear
fear of what han
as i have said if the baa had kept hi ey open he would know
did not the baa notic a tall darkfac priest befor whom the
crowd part who came up to issicor when first we land on the quai
here
ye i saw such a man he bow polit and i thought wa greet
issicor and make him some present
and did the baa see what kind of a present he made him and hear hi
word of wisdom the baa shake hi head well i did the present he
gave to issicor wa a littl skull carv out of black ivori or
shell or it mai have been of polish lava rock and the word of
welcom were the gift of heuheu to the lord issicor that gift
which heuheu send to all who break the law and dare to leav the
land of the walloo those were the word for stand near by i
heard them though i kept them from the baa wait to see what
would happen afterward
then the priest went awai and what issicor did with the littl
black skull i do not know perhap he wear it round hi neck as he
hasnt got a watch chain just as the baa us to wear thing that
ladi had given him or their pictur in a littl silver brandi
flask
well and what about thi skull han what doe it mean
baa i made inquiri of an old man in that cano to pass the time
awai baa as issicor wa at the other end and could not hear me it
mean death baa doe not the baa rememb how we were told at
the black kloof that those who dare to leav the land of heuheu were
alwai smitten with some sick and di well baa issicor got
out all right and left the sick behind him i expect becaus the
priest did not know that he wa go but he made a mistak baa
that of come back again be drawn by hi love of sabeela just as
a fish is drawn by the bait on the hook baa and now the hook is
fast in hi mouth for the priest knew of hi return well enough
baa and of cours were wait for him
what do you mean han how can the priest hurt issicor especi
when thei ar all dead
ye baa thei ar all dead and can harm no on but issicor is
right when he sai that heuheu is not dead becaus the devil never
di baa hi priest ar dead but heuheu could kill the old
walloo and so he can kill issicor there is a great deal in thi
fetish busi baa that good christian like you and i do not
understand it wont work on christian baa which is why heuheu
cant kill us but those who worship the black on at last the black
on take by the throat
i thought to myself that here han although he did not know it wa
enunci on of the profoundest and most fundament of truth
sinc those who bow the knee to baal ar baal servant and live
under hi law even to the death and what is baal but heuheu or
satan the fruit is alwai the same by whatev name the tree mai be
call howev i did not enter upon thi argument with han whom it
would have bewild but onli ask him what he meant and what he
imagin wa go to happen to issicor he answer
i mean just what i have said baa i mean that issicor is go to
die that old man told me that those who receiv the black skull
alwai die within the month and often more quickli from the look of
him i should think that issicor will not last more than a week
although so handsom he is realli veri dull baa so it doe not
much matter especi as the ladi sabeela will get over it quit
soon that is why issicor ha chang baa it is becaus the fear
of death is upon him in the same wai sabeela ha chang becaus the
fear of death and what to her perhap is wors ha pass awai
bosh i exclaim but intern i had my doubt i knew someth
of thi fetish busi although i believ it to be the greatest of
rubbish i wa sure that it is extrem danger rubbish the secret
soul of man especi of savag or primit and untaught man or
the subconsci self or whatev you choos to call it is a
terribl entiti when brought into action by the hereditari
superstit that ar born in hi blood in nine case out of ten if
the victim of those superstit is told with the accustom
ceremoni by the oracl of the god or devil from which thei flow
that he will die he doe die noth kill him but he commit a
kind of moral suicid as han had saidfear make him soft then
some kind of nervou diseas penetr hi system and at the
appoint hour wither up hi physic life and caus him to pass
awai
such as it prove wa to be the fate of that apollolik person the
unhappi issicor
chapter xv
sabeela farewel
now of thi stori there is littl left to tell and as it is veri late
and i see that you ar all yawn my friend thi wa not true for
we were deepli interest especi over the moral or spiritu
problem of issicor i will cut that littl as short as i can it
shall be a mere footnot
after we had eaten that morn we went to see sabeela whom we found
veri agit thi wa natur enough consid all she had gone
through as after mental strain and the pass of great peril a
nervou reaction invari follow also in a sudden and terribl
fashion she had lost her father to whom she wa attach but the
real caus of her distress wa differ
issicor it seem had been taken veri ill nobodi knew what wa the
matter with him but sabeela wa persuad that he had been poison
she beg me to visit him at onc and cure hima request that made
me indign i explain to her that i wa no author on their
nativ poison if he suffer from anyth of the sort and had few
medicin with me the onli on of which that dealt with poison wa
an antidot to snake bite howev as she wa veri insist i said
that i would go and see what i could do which would probabl be
noth
so togeth with han i wa conduct by some of the old headmen or
councillor of the walloo such peopl as in zululand we should call
induna to the hous of issicor a rather fine build of it
sort at the other end of the town we walk by the road that ran
along the edg of the lake which gave us an opportun to observ
the island or rather what had been the island
now it wa noth but a low dark mass over which hung dens cloud
of steam when the wind stir these cloud i saw that beneath them
were red stream of lava that ran into the lake there were no more
erupt and the volcano appear to have vanish awai much dust
wa still fall it lai thick upon the roadwai and all the tree and
other veget were cover with it turn the landscap to a hue
of ashen grei otherwis no damag had been done on the mainland
except that here and there boulder had fallen and some of the lower
ly field were inund by the great flood which wa now abat
although the river still overflow it bank
we reach the hous of issicor and were shown into hi chamber
where he lai upon a couch of skin attend by some women who i
understood were hi rel when han and i enter these women
bow and went out leav us alon with the patient a glanc told
me that he wa a dy man hi fine ey were fix on vacanc he
breath in gasp hi finger clasp and unclasp themselv
automat and from time to time he wa taken with violent
shiver these i thought must be due to some form of fever until i
had test hi temperatur with the thermomet i had in my littl
medicin case and found that it wa two degre below normal on be
question he said that he had no pain and suffer onli from great
weak and from a whirl of the head by which i suppos meant
giddi
i ask him to what he attribut hi condit he answer
to the curs of heuheu lord macumazahn heuheu is kill me
i inquir why for to argu about the folli of the busi wa
futil and he repli
for two reason lord first becaus i left the land without hi
leav and secondli becaus i row you and the yellow man call
lightindark to the holi isl to visit which unsummon is the
greatest of crime for thi caus i must die more quickli than
otherwis i should have done but in ani case my doom wa certain
becaus i left the land to seek help for sabeela here is the proof of
it and from somewher about hi person he produc the littl black
death head which han had describ to me then without allow me
to touch the horrid thing he hid it awai again
i tri to laugh him out of thi idea but he onli smile sadli and
said
i know that you must have thought me a coward lord becaus of the
wai i have born myself sinc we reach thi town of walloo but it
wa the curs of heuheu work within me that chang my spirit i
prai you to explain thi to sabeela whom i love but who i think also
believ me a coward for yesterdai i read it in her ey now while i
have still strength i would speak to you first i thank you and the
yellow man lightindark who by courag or by magici know not
whichhav save sabeela from heuheu and have destroi hi hous
and hi priest and i am told hi imag heuheu it is true live
on sinc he cannot die but henceforward here he is without a home or
a shape or a worshipp and therefor hi power over the soul and
bodi of men is gone and among the walloo in time hi worship will
die out perhap no more of my peopl will perish by the curs of heu
heu lord
but why should you die issicor
becaus the curs fell on me first lord while heuheu reign over
the walloo as he ha done from the begin he who wa onc their
earthli king
i began to combat thi nonsens but he wave hi hand in protest and
went on
lord my time is short and i would sai someth to you soon i shall
be no more and forgotten even by sabeela whose husband i had hope
to becom i prai therefor that you will marri sabeela
here i gasp but held my peac till he had finish
alreadi i have caus her to be inform that such is my last wish
also i have caus all the elder of the walloo to be inform and
at a meet held thi morn thei decid that thi marriag would
be right and wise and have sent a messeng to tell me to die as
quickli as i can in order that it mai be arrang at onc
great heaven i exclaim but again he motion to me to be
silent and went on
lord although she is not of your race sabeela is veri beauti
veri wise also and with you for her husband she mai be abl onc more
to build up the walloo into a great peopl as tradit sai thei
were in the old dai befor there fell upon them the curs of heuheu
which is now broken for you too ar wise and bold and know mani
thing which we do not know and the peopl will serv you as a god
and perhap come to worship you in place of heuheu so that you found
a mighti dynasti at first thi thought mai seem strang to you but
soon you will come to see that it is great and good moreov even if
you were unwil thing must come about as i have said
why i ask unabl to contain myself ani longer
becaus lord here in thi land you must spend the rest of your
life for in it now you ar a prison nor with all your courag can
you escap sinc none will row you down the river nor can you forc
a wai for it will be watch moreov when you return to the hous
of the walloo you will find that your cartridg have been taken so
that except for a few that you have about you you ar weaponless
therefor as here you must live it is better that you should do so
with sabeela rather than with ani other woman sinc she is the
fairest and the cleverest of them all also by right of blood she is
the ruler and through her you will becom walloo as i should have
done accord to our custom
at thi point he close hi ey and for a while appear to becom
senseless present he open them again and stare at me lift
hi feebl hand and cri
greet to the walloo long life and glori to the walloo
nor wa thi all for to my horror from the other side of the
partit that divid the hous i heard the women whom i have
mention echo the salut
greet to the walloo long life and glori to the walloo
then again issicor becam senseless at least noth i said seem
to reach hi understand so after wait for a time han and i
went awai think that all wa over thi howev wa not so
sinc he live till nightfal and i wa told recov hi sens
for some hour befor the end dure which time sabeela visit him
accompani by certain of the notabl or elder it wa then as i
suppos that thi illfat but most unselfish issicor the
handsomest man whom ever i beheld to hi own satisfact if not to
mine settl everyth for what he conceiv to be the welfar of
hi countri and hi ladylov
well baa said han when we were outsid the hous i suppos we
had better go home it is your home now isnt it baa no baa
it is no us look at that river for you see these walloo ar so
kind that thei have alreadi provid you with a chief escort
i look it wa true enough in place of the on man who had guid
us to the hous there were now twenti great fellow arm with spear
who salut me in a most reverenti manner and insist upon stick
close to my heel i presum in case i should try to take to them so
back we went the guard of twenti march in a soldierlik fashion
immedi behind while han declaim at me
it is just what i expect baa for of cours if a man is veri fond
of women in hi insid baa thei know it and like himno need to
tell them in so mani word baasand be kindheart ar quit
readi to be fond of him that is what ha happen here baa from
the moment that the ladi sabeela saw you she didnt care a pinch of
snuff for issicor although he wa so goodlook and had walk
such a long wai to help her no baa she perceiv someth in you
which she couldnt find in two yard and a bit of issicor who after
all wa an empti kind of drum baa and onli made a nois when you
hit hima littl nois for a small tap baa and a big nois for a
bang moreov whatev he wa he is done now so it is no us
wast time talk about him
well thi wont be such a bad countri to live in now that the most
of those heuheua ar deadlook there ar some of their bodi ly
on the shoreand no doubt the beer can be brew stronger and there
is tobacco so it will be all right till we get tire of it baa
after which perhap we shall be abl to run awai still i am glad
none of them wish to marri me baa and make me work like a whole
team of oxen to drag them out of their mudhol
thu he went on pour out hi bosh by the yard and liter i wa
so crush that i couldnt find a word in answer truli it is the
unexpect that alwai happen dure the last few dai i had
foreseen mani danger and dealt with some but thi wa on of which i
had never dream what a fate to be kept a prison in a kind of
gild cage and made to labour for my live too like a perform
monkei well i would find a wai between the bar or my name wasnt
allan quatermain onli what wai at the time i could see none for
those bar seem to be thick and strong moreov there were those
gentlemen with the spear behind
in due cours we arriv at the walloo hous without incid and
went straight to our room where after investig in a corner han
call out
issicor wa quit right baa all the cartridg have gone and the
rifl also now we have onli got our pistol and twentyfour round
of ammunit between us
i look it wa so then i stare out of the windowplac and
behold there in the garden were the twenti men alreadi engag in
mark out ground for the erect of a guardhut
thei mean to settl there so as to be nice and handi in case the
baa want themor thei want the baa said han significantli
ad i believ that wherev he goe the walloo alwai ha an
escort of twenti men
now for the next few dai i saw noth of sabeela or of dramana
either sinc thei were engag in the ceremoni obsequi first of
the walloo and next of the unlucki issicor to which for some
religi reason or other i wa not invit
certain headmen or induna howev were alwai wait to pounc on
me whenev i put my nose outofdoor thei appear bow humbl
and proceed to take the occas to instruct me in the histori and
custom of the walloo peopl till i thought that my boyhood had
return and i wa onc more read sandford and merton and
acquir knowledg through the art of convers those old
gentlemen bore me stiff i tri to get rid of them by take long
walk at a great pace but thei respond nobli be readi to trot
by my side till thei drop talk talk talk moreov if
i could outwalk those ancient councillor the guard of twenti who
form a kind of choru on these expedit were excel hand
with their leg as an irishman might sai and never turn a hair
sometim thei turn me howev if thei thought i wa go where i
should not sinc then half of them would dart ahead and polit bar
the wai
at length on the third or fourth dai all the ceremoni were
finish and i wa summon into sabeela presenc
as han said afterward it wa all veri fine inde i thought it
pathet with it somewhat tawdri condit of ancient almost
forgotten ceremoni inherit from a highli civil race that wa
now sink into barbar there wa the ladi sabeela veri beauti
to see for she wa a love woman and grandli dress in a halfwild
fashion who plai the part of a queen and not without digniti as
perhap her ancestress had done thousand of year befor on some
greater stage here too were her whitehair attend or induna
the same who bore me out walk repres the councillor and
high offici of forgotten ag
yet the queen wa no longer a queen she wa merg into the savag
chieftai as the councillor were into the chatter mob that
surround such a person in a thousand kraal or town of africa the
proceed too were veri long for each of these councillor or
elder made a speech in which he repeat all that the other had said
befor narrat with variat everyth that happen in the land
sinc i had set foot within it togeth with fanci account of what
han and i had done upon the island
from these speech howev i learn on thing name that most
of the wild hairi folk who were name heuheua had perish in the
great catastroph of the blow up of the mountain onli a few
togeth with the old men the children and the femal be left to
carri on the race therefor thei said the walloo were safe from
attack at ani rate for a coupl of gener to come as might be
learn from the wail which aros in the forest at nightthat as
a matter of fact i had heard myselfpathet and horribl sound of
almost anim grief thi said these merciless sage gave the
walloo a great opportun for now wa the time to hunt down and
kill the woodfolk to the last woman and childa task which thei
consid i wa emin fit to carri out
when thei had all spoken sabeela turn came she rose from her
thronelik chair and address us with real eloqu first of all
she point out that she wa a woman suffer from a doubl grief
the death of her father and that of the man to whom she had been
affianc loss that made her heart heavi then veri touchingli
she thank han and myself for all we had done to save her but for
us she said either she would now have been dead or noth but a
degrad slave in the hous of heuheu which we had destroi
togeth with heuheu himself with the result that she and the land
were free onc more next she announc in word which evid had
been prepar that thi wa no time for her to think of past sorrow
or love who now must look to the futur for a man like myself there
wa but on fit reward and that wa the rule over the walloo
peopl and with it the gift of her own person
therefor by the wish of her councillor she had decre that we
were to be wed on the fourth morn from that of the present dai
after which by right of marriag i wa publicli to be declar the
walloo meanwhil she summon me to her side where an empti chair
had been set in prepar for thi event that we might exchang the
kiss of betroth
now as mai be imagin i hung back inde never have i felt more
firmli fix to a seat than at that fearsom moment i did not know
what to sai and my tongu seem glu to the roof of my mouth so i
just sat still with all those old donkei stare at me sabeela
watch me out of the corner of her ey and wait the silenc
grew pain and in it midst han cough in hi huski fashion then
deliv himself thu
get up baa he whisper and go through with it it isnt half
as bad as it look and inde some peopl would like it veri much
it is better to kiss a pretti ladi than to have your throat cut baa
for that is what i think will happen if you dont becaus a woman
whom you dont kiss after she ha ask you in public alwai turn
nasti baa
i felt that there wa forc in thi argument and to cut a long stori
short i went up into that chair and didwellal that wa requir
lord what a fool i felt while those idiot cheer and han below
grin at me like a whole cage of baboon howev it wa but
ceremoni a mere formal just touch the brow of the fair
sabeela with my lip and receiv an acknowledg in kind
after thi we sat a while side by side listen to those old walloo
councillor chant a ridicul song someth about the marriag
of a hero to a goddess which i presum thei must have compos for
the occas under cover of the nois which wa great for thei had
excel lung sabeela spoke to me in a low voic and without
turn her face or look at me
lord she said try to look less unhappi lest these peopl should
suspect someth and listen to what we ar sai the law is that we
should meet no more till the marriag dai but i must see you alon
tonight have no fear she ad with a rather sarcast smile
for although i must be alon you can bring your companion with you
sinc what i have to sai concern you both meet me in the passag
that run from thi chamber to your own at midnight when all sleep
it ha no window place and it wall ar thick so that there we can
be neither seen nor heard be care to bolt the door behind you as
i will that of thi chamber do you understand
clap my hand hilari to show my delight in the music
perform i whisper back that i did
good when the sing come to an end announc that you have a
request to make of me ask that tomorrow you mai be given a cano and
paddler to row to the island to learn what ha happen there and to
discov whether ani of the woodfolk ar still aliv upon it shore
sai that if so measur must be taken to make an end of them lest
thei should escap now speak no more
at length the song wa finish and with it the ceremoni to show
that thi wa over sabeela rose from her chair and curtsei to me
whereon i also rose and return the compliment with my best bow
thu then we bade a public farewel of each other until the happi
marriag morn befor we part howev i ask as a favour in a
loud voic that i might be permit to visit the island or at ani
rate to row round it give the reason she had suggest to thi
she answer let it be as my lord wish and befor ani on could
rais object withdrew herself follow by some serv woman and
by dramana who i thought did not seem too pleas at the turn event
had taken
i pass on to that midnight interview at the appoint time or rather
a littl befor it i went into the passag accompani by han who
wa most unwil to come for reason which he gave in a dutch
proverb to the effect of our own that two compani and three none
here we stood in the dark and wait a few minut later the door at
the far end of it openedit wa a veri long passageand walk down
it appear sabeela clad in white and bear in her hand a nake
lamp somehow in thi garb and in these surround thu illumin
she look more beauti than i had ever seen her almost spiritlik
inde we met and without ani greet she said to me
lord watcherbynight i find you watch by night accord to my
prayer it mai have seem a strang prayer to you but hearken to it
reason i cannot think that you believ me to desir thi marriag
which i know to be hate to you see that i am of anoth race to
yourself and that you onli look upon me as a halfsavag woman whom it
ha been your fortun to save from shame or death nai contradict me
not i beseech you sinc at time the truth is good becaus it is so
good i will add to it tell you the reason why i also do not desir
thi marriag or rather the greatest reason name that i love
issicor who from childhood had been my playmat until he becam more
than playmat
ye i interrupt and i know that he love you onli then why wa
it that on hi deathb he himself urg on thi matter
becaus lord issicor had a nobl heart he thought you the
greatest man whom he had ever known half a god inde for he told me
so he held also that you would make me happi and rule thi countri
well lift it up again out of it long sleep lastli he knew that
if you did not marri me you and your companion would be murder if
he judg wrongli in these matter it must be rememb moreov
that hi mind wa blot with the poison that had been given to him
for myself i am sure that he did not die of fear alon
i understand all honour be to him i said
i thank you now lord know that although i am ignor i believ
that we live again beyond the gate of death perhap that faith ha
come down to me from my forefath when thei worship other god
besid the devil heuheu at least it is mine my hope is
therefor that when i have pass that gate which perhap will be
befor so veri long on it farther side i shall onc more find
issicoreissicor as he wa befor the curs of heuheu fell upon him
and he drank the poison of the priestsand for thi reason i desir
to wed no other man
all honour be to you also i murmur
again i thank you lord now let us turn to other matter tomorrow
after middai a cano will be readi and in it you will find your
weapon that have been stolen and all that is your it will be man
by four rower men known to be spi of the priest of heuheu
station here upon the mainland to watch the walloo who in time
would themselv have becom priest therefor now that heuheu ha
fallen thei ar doom to die not at onc but after a while perhap
as it will seem by sick or accid becaus if thei live the
walloo councillor fear lest thei should reestablish the rule of heuheu
thei know thi well and therefor thei desir abov all thing
to escap the land while their life is yet in them
have you seen these men sabeela
nai but dramana ha seen them now lord i will tell you someth
if you have not guess it for yourself though i do thi not without
shame dramana doe not desir our marriag lord you save dramana
as well as myself and dramana like issicor ha come to look on you
as half a god need i sai more save that of cours for thi reason
she doe desir your escap sinc she would rather that you went free
and were lost to both of us than that you should bide here and marri
me have i said enough
plenti i answer know that she spoke truth
then what is there to add save that i trust all will go well and
that by the dawn of the dai that follow thi you and the yellow man
your servant will be safe out of thi accurs land if that come
about as i believ it will for after the dusk ha fallen and befor
the moon rise those who guid the cano will bring it not to the
quai but into the mouth of the river down which you must paddl by
the moonlight then i prai of you at time in your own countri to
think of sabeela the brokenheart chieftai of a doom peopl
as dai by dai when she rise and lai herself down to sleep she will
think of you who save her and all of us from ruin my lord farewel
and to you lightindark also farewel
then she took my hand kiss it and without anoth word glide
awai as she had come
thi wa the last that ever i saw or heard of sabeela the beauti i
wonder whether she live long somehow i do not think so that night i
seem to see death in her ey
chapter xvi
the race for life
now like a scotch parson i have come to lastlythat inspir
word at which the sleepiest congreg awak the morn follow
thi strang midnight meet han and i spent in our room for it
appear to be the ancient walloo etiquett that save by special
permiss the prospect bridegroom should not go out for sever
dai befor the marriag i suppos becaus of some primit idea
that hi affect might be divert by the sight of alien beauti
at middai we at or so far as i wa concern pretend to eat for
anxieti took awai my appetit a littl while afterward to my
intens relief the captain of our prisonward for that is what
thei were appear and said that he wa command to conduct us to
the cano which wa to paddl us to inspect what remain of the
island i repli that we would gracious consent to go so take
all our small possess with us includ a bundl contain our
spare cloth and the twig from the tree of illus we depart
and were escort to the quai by our guard of whose face i wa
heartili tire here we found a small cano await us man by
four secretfac men strong fellow all of them who rais their
paddl in salut appar the place had been clear of loiter
sinc there wa onli on other person present a woman wrap in a
long cloak that hid her face
as we were about to enter the cano thi woman approach us and
lift her head she wa dramana
lord she said i have been sent by my sister the new walloo to
tell you that you will find the iron tube which spit out fire and all
that belong to them under a mat in the prow of the cano also she
bid me wish you a prosper journei to the island that aforetim wa
name holi which island she wish never to see again
i thank her and bade her convei my greet to the walloo my bride
to be ad in a loud voic that i hope er long to be abl to do
thi in person when her veil fell down
then i turn to enter the cano
lord said dramana with a convuls movement of her hand i make
a prayer to you it is that you will take me with you to look my last
upon that isl where i dwelt so long a slave which i desir to see
onc morenow that i am free
instinct i felt that a crisi had arisen which demand firm and
even brutal treatment
nai dramana i answer it is alwai unlucki for an escap slave
to revisit hi prison lest onc more it bar should close about that
slave
lord she said the loos prison is sometim daze by freedom
so that the heart cri again for it captiv lord i am a good
slave and a love will you not take me with you
nai dramana i answer as i sprang into the cano thi boat is
fulli load it would not be for your welfar or for mine farewel
she gaze at me earnestli with a piti counten that grew
wrath by degre as might well happen in the case of a woman
scorn then mutter someth about be cast off burst into
angri tear and turn awai for my part i motion to the oarsmen to
loos the craft and depart feel like a thief and traitor yet i
wa not to blame for what els could i do dramana it is true had
been a good friend to us and i like her but we had repaid her help
by save her from heuheu and for the rest on must draw the line
somewher if onc she had enter that cano metaphor
speak she would never have got out of it again
present we were out on the open lake where the wavelet danc and
the sun shone brightli and glad i wa to be clear of all those
pain complic and onc more in the compani of pure and natur
thing we paddl awai to the island and made the land or rather
drew near to it at the spot where the ancient citi had stood in which
we had found the petrifi men and anim but we did not set foot on
it for everywher littl stream of glow lava trickl down into
the lake and the ruin had vanish beneath a sea of ash i do not
think that ani on will ever again behold those strang relic of a
past i know not how remot
turn we paddl on slowli round the island till we came to the
place where the rock of offer had been upon which i had
experienc so terribl an adventur it had vanish and with it the
cave mouth the garden of heuheu it tree of illus and all the
rich cultiv land the water of the lake turbid and steam now
beat against the face of a stoni hillock which wa all that remain
of the holi isl the catastroph wa complet the volcano wa but a
lump of lava from the dy heart of which it lifeblood of flame
still palpit in red and eb stream i wonder whether it
smother fire will ever break out again elsewher for aught i know
thei mai have done so alreadi somewher on the mainland
by the time that we had complet our journei round the place on which
no live creatur now wa left though onc or twice we saw the
bloat bodi of a heuheua savag bob about in the water the sun
wa set and it wa dark befor we were again off the town of the
walloo while ani light remain by which we could be seen we head
straight for the land place that which we had left when we start
for the island
the moment that it last rai fade howev there wa a whisper
confer between our four paddlemen the exneophyt of heuheu
then the direct of the cano wa alter and instead of make for
the main land we row on parallel with it till we came to the mouth
of the black river it wa so dark that i could not discern the exact
time at which we left the lake and enter the stream inde i did
not know that we were in it until the increas current told me so
thi current wa now run veri strongli after the great flood and
bore us along at a good pace my fear wa lest in the gloom we should
be dash against rock on the bank or caught by the overhang
branch of tree or strike a snag but those four men seem to know
everi yard of the river and manag to keep us in it centr probabl
by follow the current where it ran most swiftli
so we went on not paddl veri fast for fear of accid until the
moon rose which as she wa onli a few dai past her full gave us
consider light even in that dark place so soon as her rai
reach us our paddler gave wai with a will and we shot down the
flood stream as a great speed
i think we ar all right now baa said han for with so good a
start those walloo could scarc catch us even if thei try we ar
lucki too for you have left behind you two ladi who between them
would have torn you into piec and i have left a place where the
fool who live in it weari me so much that i should soon have di
he paus for a moment then ad in a horrifi voic
allemagt we ar not so lucki after all we have forgotten
someth
what i ask anxious
why baa those red and white stone we came to fetch of which
befor heuheu drop a redhot rock upon hi head that old
kraansick that is mad walloo promis us as mani as we wish
sabeela would have fill the boat with them if we had onli ask her
and we should never have had to work ani more but could have sat in
fine hous and drunk the best gin from morn to night
at these word i felt posit sick it wa too true amongst other
press matter concern life death marriag and liberti i had
forgotten utterli all about the diamond and gold still when i came
to think of it although perhap han might have done so in view of
the manner of our part i did not quit see how i could have ask
sabeela for them it would have been an anticlimax and might have left
a nasti tast in her mouth how could she continu to look upon a man
aswel someth quit out of the ordinari who call her back to
remind her that there wa a littl pecuniari matter to be settl and
a fee to be paid for servic render further the sight of us
bear sack of treasur might have excit suspicion unless
inde sabeela had caus them to be place in the boat as she did in
the case of the gun also thei would have been heavi and inconveni
to carri as i explain to han yet i did feel sick for onc more
my hope of wealth or at ani rate of a solid compet for the
rest of my dai had vanish into thin air
life is more than gold i said sententi to han and great
honour is better than both
it sound like someth out of the book of proverb but somehow i
had not got it quit right though i reflect that fortun han
would not know the differ howev he knew more than i thought
for he answer
ye baa your reverend father us to talk like that also he said
that it wa better to live on watercress with an easi mind howev
angri thei might make your stomach than to dwell in a big hut with a
coupl of cross women which is what would have happen to you baa
if you had stop at walloo besid we ar quit safe now even if
we havent got the gold and diamond which as you sai ar heavi
thing so safe that i think i shall go to sleep baa allemagt
baa what that
onli those poor hairi women howl over their dead in the forest i
answer rather carelessli for their cri which were veri
distress in the silenc of the river still echo in my ear also
i wa still think of the lost diamond
i wish it were baa thei might howl till their head fell off for
all i care but it isnt it paddl the walloo ar hunt us
baa listen
i did listen and to my horror heard the regular stroke of paddl
strike the water at a distanc behind us a great number of them
fifti i should sai on of the big cano must be on our track
oh baa said han it is your fault again without doubt that
ladi dramana love you so much that she cant make up her mind to part
with you and ha order out a big cano to fetch you back unless
inde he ad with an access of hope it is the ladi
sabeela send a farewel gift of jewel after us have rememb
that we should like some to make us think of her afterward
it is those confound walloo send a gift of spear i answer
gloomili ad get the rifl readi han for im not go to be
taken aliv
whatev the caus it wa clear that we were be pursu and in my
heart i did wonder whether dramana had anyth to do with it no
doubt i had treat her rude becaus i could not help it also
dramana had been badli train among those rascal priest but i
hope and still hope that she wa innoc of thi treacheri the
truth of the matter i never learn
our crew of escap priestli spi had also heard the paddl for i
saw the frighten look thei gave to each other and the fierc energi
with which thei bent themselv to their work good heaven how thei
paddl who knew that their live hung upon the issu for hour after
hour awai we flew down that flood rush river while behind us
draw nearer minut by minut sound the beat of those insist
paddl our cano wa swift but how could we hope to escap from on
driven by fifti men when we had but four
it wa just as we pass the place where we had slept on our inward
journeyfor now we had left the forest behind and were between the
cliff travel quit twice as fast as we had done up streamthat
i caught sight of the pursu boat perhap half a mile behind us
and saw that it wa on of the largest of the walloo fleet after
thi ow to the posit of the moon that in thi narrow place
left the surfac of the water quit dark i saw it no more for sever
hour but i heard it draw nearer ever nearer like some sure and
deadli bloodhound follow on the spoor of a flee slave
our men began to tire han and i took the paddl of two of them to
give the pair a rest and time to eat then for a spell the paddl of
the other two while thei did likewis thi howev caus us to
lose wai sinc we were not expert at the game though here after the
flood the river rush so fast that our lack of skill made littl
differ
at length the daylight came and gather till at last the glimmer of
it reach us in our cleft and by that faint uncertain light i saw
the pursu cano not a hundr yard behind in it wai it wa a
veri weird and impress spectacl there were the precipit
tower cliff between or rather abov which appear a line of blue
sky there wa the darksom floodfil foam river and there on
it surfac wa our tini boat propel by four weari and perspir
men while behind came the great war cano whose presenc could just
be detect in a dim outlin and by the white of the water where it
oarsmen smote it into froth
thei ar come up fast baa and we still have a long wai to go
soon thei will catch us baa said han
then we must try to stop them for a while i answer grimli give
me the express rifl han and do you take the winchest
then ly down in the cano and rest the rifl on it stern we
wait our opportun present we came to a place where at some
time there had been a cliffslid for here the debri of it narrow
the river turn it now that it wa so full into someth like a
torrent at thi spot also becaus of the enlarg of the cleft
more light reach us so that we could see our pursuer who were
about fifti yard awai not clearli inde but well enough for our
purpos
aim low and pump it into them han i said and next instant
discharg both barrel of the express at the foremost rower
han follow suit but as the winchest held five cartridg went
on fire after i had ceas
the result wa instantan some men sank down some paddl fell
into the wateri could not tell how manyand a great cry aros from
the smitten or their companion he who steer or captain the cano
from the prow appar wa among the hit she veer round and for a
while wa broadsid on to the current expos her bottom and
threaten to turn over into thi have load i sent two
expand bullet hope to spring a leak in her though i wa not
certain if i should succe as the wood of these cano is thick i
think i did howev sinc even when she had got on her cours again
she came more slowli and i thought that onc i saw a man bail
on we went make the most of the advantag that thi check gave to
us but by now our men were veri tire and their hand were raw from
blister so that onli the terror of death forc them to continu
paddl inde at the last our progress grew veri slow and in fact
wa due more to the current than to our own effort therefor the
follow cano which as wa customari in walloo boat of that size
probabl carri spare paddl men onc more gain upon us
hereabout the river wound between it cliff so that we onli got
sight of it from time to time whenev we did so i took the
winchest and fire no doubt inflict some damag and check it
advanc
at length the wind ceas and we reach the last stretch a clear
run of a mile or so befor the river end in the swamp that i have
describ
by thi time pursuer and pursu both of us were go but slowli
drift rather than paddl sinc all were exhaust whenev i
could get a sight i fire awai but still with a sullen determin
and in utter silenc our assail came up till now thei were
scarc twenti pace from us and some of them threw spear on of
which stuck in the bottom of our cano just miss my foot at thi
spot the cliff drew so near togeth at the top that i ceas
shoot as i could not see to aim and have no cartridg to
wast decid to keep those that remain for the emerg of the
last attack
now we were in the ultim reach of the river and now at last we
ground upon the first mudbank of the swamp those who remain
unhurt of the follow walloo made a final effort to overtak us by
the strong light that flow from the open land beyond us i could see
their glare eyebal and their tongu hang from their jaw with
exhaust i yell an order
seiz everyth we have and run for it i cri grab at my
rifl and such other articl as were within reach includ the
remain cartridg
the other did likewisei do not think that anyth wa left in that
cano except the paddl then i leapt on to the shore and ran to the
right follow the edg of the swamp the rest come after me
fifti yard or more awai i sank down upon a littl ridg from sheer
exhaust and becaus my cramp leg would no longer carri me and
watch to see what would happen inde i wa so worn out that i
felt i would rather die where i wa than try to flee farther
we group ourselv togeth await the crisi for i thought that
sure we should be attack but we were not at the mudbank the
pursu walloo ceas from their effort for a littl while thei
sat dejectedli in their craft till thei had recov breath
then for the first time those mute huntinghound gave tongu for
thei shout maledict on us and especi on our four paddler
the neophyt of heuheu tell these that although to follow them
farther wa not law thei would die as issicor di who left the
land on of our men stung into reparte retali in word to the
effect that some of them had di in attempt to keep us in the
land as thei would find if thei count their oarsmen
to thi obviou truth the pursuer made no answer nor did thei inform
us who sent them on the chase secur our small cano thei laid in
it certain dead men who had fallen beneath the bullet of han and
myself and depart slowli up stream tow it after them thi wa
the last that i saw of their handsom fanat face and of their
confound countri in which i went so near to death or to becom a
prison for life that might have been wors
baa said han light hi pipe that wa a great journei and
on which it will be nice to think about now that it is over though
i wish that we had kill more of those walloo mensteal
i dont han i hate be oblig to shoot them i answer nor
do i wish to think ani more of that race for our live unless it
come back in a nightmar when i cant help do so
dont you baa i find such thought pleasant when the danger is
past and we who might have been dead ar aliv and the other who
were aliv ar dead and tell the tale to heuheu
each to hi tast your isnt mine i mutter
han puf at hi pipe for a while and went on
it funni baa that those carl did not get out of their cano
and come to kill us with their spear i suppos thei were afraid of
the rifl
no han i answer thei ar brave men who would not have stop
becaus of the bullet thei were afraid of more than these thei
fear the curs which sai that those who leav their land will die
and go to hell heuheu ha done us a good turn there han
ye baa no doubt he ha becom a christian in the place of fire
and is repai good for evil turn the other cheek baa i felt
like that myself when i thought those walloo were go to catch us
but now i feel quit differ baa you rememb how your reverend
father us to sai that if you love heaven heaven look after you and
pull you out of everi kind of mudhol that why im sit here
smoke baa instead of make meat for crocodil if it wasnt for
our forget about those jewel it ha look after us veri well
but there ar so mani up there that perhap heaven forgot them also
no han i said heaven rememb that if we had tri to carri
bag of stone out of that boat as well as zikali medicin and the
rest the walloo would have caught us befor we got awai thei were
quit close han
ye baa i see and that wa veri nice of heaven and now baa i
think we had better be move those walloo might forget about the
curs for a littl while and come back to look for us heaven is a
queer thing baa sometim it chang it face all of a sudden and
grow angryjust like the ladi dramana did when you said that you
wouldnt take her with you in the cano yesterdai
allan paus to help himself to a littl weak whiski and water then
said in hi jerki fashion
well that the end of the stori of which i am glad whatev you
mai be for my throat is dry with talk we got back to the wagon
all right after sundri difficulti and a tire march across the
desert and it wa time we did so for when we arriv we had onli
three rifl cartridg left between us you see we were oblig to
fire such a lot at the heuheua when thei attack us on the lake and
afterward at those walloo to prevent them from catch us that
night howev there were more in the wagon and i shot four
eleph with them go home thei had veri larg tusk which
afterward i sold for about enough to cover the expens of the
journei
did old zikali make you pai for those oxen i ask
no he did not becaus i told him that if he tri it on i would not
give him hi bundl of mouti that we cut from the tree of illus
and carri safe all that wai so as he wa veri keen on the
medicin he made me a present of the oxen also i found my own there
grown fat and strong again it wa a curiou thing but the old
scoundrel seem to know most of what had happen to us befor ever i
told him a word perhap he learn it all from on of those acolyt
of heuheu who fled with us becaus thei fear that thei would be
murder if thei stai in their own land i forgot to tell you that
these menmost uncommun personsmelt awai upon our homeward
journei suddenli thei were miss i presum that thei depart to
set up as witch doctor on their own account if so veri possibl on
or more of them mai have come into touch with zikali the head of the
craft in that part of africa and befor i reach the black kloof
the first thing he ask me wa why did you not bring ani gold and
diamond awai with you had you done so you might have becom rich
who now remain poor macumazahn
becaus i forgot to ask for them i said
ye i know you forgot to ask for them you were think so much of
the pain of sai goodby to that beauti ladi whose name i have
not learn that you forgot to ask for them it is just like you
macumazahn oho oho it is just like you
then he stare at hi fire for a while in front of which as usual
he wa sit and ad yet somehow i think that diamond will
make you rich on dai when there is no woman left to sai goodby to
macumazahn
it wa a good shot of hi for as you fellow know that came about
at king solomon mine didnt it when there wa no woman left to
sai goodby to
here good turn hi head awai and allen went on hurriedli i think
becaus he rememb foulata and saw that hi thoughtless remark had
given pain
zikali wa veri interest in all our stori and made me stop at the
black kloof for some dai to tell him everi detail
i knew that heuheu wa an idol he said though i want you to
find it out for yourself and therefor told you noth about it
just as i knew that handsom man issicor would die but i didnt
tell him anyth about that either becaus if i had you see he
might have di befor he had shown you the wai to hi countri and
then i shouldnt have got my mouti which is necessari to me for
without it how should i paint more pictur on my fire well you
brought me a good bundl of leav which will last my time and as the
tree of illus is burn and there is no other left in the world
there will be no more of it i am glad that it is burn for i do not
wish that ani wizard should aris in the land who will be as great as
wa zikali openerofroad while that tree grew the high priest of
heuheu wa almost as great but now he is dead and hi tree is
burn and i zikali reign alon that is what i desir
macumazahn and that is why i sent you to heuheua land
you cun old villain i exclaim
ye macumazahn i am cun just as you ar simpl and my heart
is black like my skin just as your is white like your skin that is
why i am great macumazahn and wield power over thousand and
accomplish my desir wherea you ar small and have no power and
will die with all your desir unaccomplish yet in the end who
know who know perhap in the land beyond it mai be otherwis heu
heu wa great also and where is heuheu todai
there never wa a heuheu i said
no macumazahn there never wa a heuheu but there were priest of
heuheu is it not so with mani of the god men set up thei ar not
and never were but their priest ar and shake the spear of power
and pierc the heart of men with terror what then doe it matter
about the god whom no man see when the priest is there shake the
spear of power and pierc the heart of their worshipp the god
is the priest or the priest is the godhav it which wai you like
macumazahn
not alwai zikali then as i did not wish to enter into argument
with him on such a subject i ask who carv the statu of heuheu
in the cave of illus the walloo did not know
nor do i macumazahn he answer the world is veri old and there
have been peopl in it of whom we have heard noth or so my spirit
tell me without doubt on of those peopl carv it thousand of
year ago an invad peopl the last of their race who had been
driven out elsewher and come south those who were left of them
hid themselv awai from their enemi in thi secret place amid a
hord of savag so hideou that it wa report to be haunt by
demon there in a cave in the midst of a lake where thei could not
be come at thei carv an imag of their god or perhap of the god
of the savag whom it seem that it resembl
mayhap the savag took their name from heuheu or mayhap heuheu
took hi name from them who can tell at ani rate when men seek a
god macumazahn thei make on like themselv onli larger uglier
and more evil at least in thi land for what thei do elsewher i
know not also often thei sai that thi god wa onc their king
sinc at the bottom all worship their ancestor who gave them life if
thei worship anyth at all and often too becaus thei gave them
life thei think that thei must have been devil great ancestor were
the first god macumazahn and if thei had not been evil thei would
never have been great look at chaka the lion of the zulu he is
call great becaus he wa so wick and cruel and so it wa and is
with other if thei succe though if thei fail men speak otherwis
of them
that is not a pretti faith zikali i said
no macumazahn but then littl in the world is pretti except the
world itself the heuheua ar not pretti or rather were not for i
think that you kill most of them when you blew up the mountain
which is a good thing heuheu wa not pretti nor were hi priest
onli the walloo and especi their women remain pretti becaus of
the old blood that run in them the high old blood that heuheu
suck from their vein
well heuheu ha gone zikali and now what will becom of the
walloo
i cannot sai macumazahn but i expect thei will follow heuheu who
ha taken hold of their soul and will drag them after him if so it
doe not matter sinc thei ar but the rot stump of a tree that
onc wa tall and fair the dust of time hide mani such stump
macumazahn but what of that other fine tree ar grow which also
will becom stump in their season and so on for ever
thu zikali held forth though of what he said i forget much i
daresai that he spoke truth but i rememb that hi melancholi and
pessimist talk depress me and that i cut it as short as i could
also it did not realli explain anyth sinc he could not tell me
who the walloo or the hairi folk were or why thei worship heu
heu or what wa their begin or what would be their end
all these thing remain and remain lost in mysteri sinc i have
never heard anyth more of them and if ani subsequ travel
have visit the district where thei live which is not probabl thei
did not succe in ascend the river or if thei did thei never
descend it again so if you want to know more of the stori you must
go and find it out for yourselv onli as i think i said i wont go
with you
well said captain good it is a wonder yarn hang me if i
could have told it better myself
no good answer allan as he lit a hand candl i am quit sure
that you could not becaus you see fact ar on thing and what you
call yarn ar anoth goodnight to you all goodnight
then he went off to bed
the end
