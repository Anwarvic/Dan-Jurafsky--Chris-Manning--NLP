augusta and her publish
now mark you my master thi is comedyold plai
everybodi who ha ani connect with birmingham will be acquaint with
the vast publish establish still known by the short titl of
meeson which is perhap the most remark institut of the sort
in europ there areor rather there were at the date of the begin
of thi historythre partner in meesonsmeeson himself the manag
partner mr addison and mr roscoeand peopl in birmingham us to
sai that there were other interest in the affair for meeson wa a
compani limit
howev thi mai be meeson and co wa undoubtedli a commerci marvel
it emploi more than two thousand hand and it work lit throughout
with the electr light cover two acr and a quarter of land on
hundr commerci travel at three pound a week and a commiss
went forth east and west and north and south to sell the book of
meeson which were larg religi in their natur in all land and
fiveandtwenti tame author who were illustr by thirteen tame
artist satat salari rang from on to five hundr a yearin
vaultlik hutch in the basement and week by week pour out that
hatwork for which meeson wa justli famou then there were editor
and viceeditor and head of the variou depart and subhead
and financi secretari and reader and mani manag but what their
name were no man knew becaus at meeson all the employe of the
great hous were known by number person and person
respons be the abomin of the firm nor wa it allow to
anyon have deal with these item ever to see the same number
twice presum for fear lest the number should rememb that he wa a
man and a brother and hi heart should melt toward the unfortun and
the financi interest of meeson should suffer in short meeson wa
an establish creat for and devot to moneymak and the fact
wa kept studious and even insol befor the ey of everybodi
connect with itwhich wa of cours as it should be in thi happi
land of commerc after all that ha been written the reader will not be
surpris to learn that the partner in meeson were rich beyond the
dream of avaric their palac would have been a wonder even in ancient
babylon and would have excit admir in the corruptest and most
luxuri dai of rome where could on see such hors such carriag
such galleri of sculptur or such collect of costli gem as at the
palati hall of messr meeson addison and rosco
and to think as the mighti meeson himself would sai with a lordli
wave of hi right hand to some astonish wretch of an author whom he
ha chosen to overwhelm with the sight of thi magnific to think
that all thi come out of the brain of chap like you why young man
i tell you that if all the monei that ha been paid to you scribbler
sinc the dai of elizabeth were ad togeth it would not come up to
my littl pile but mind you it aint so much fiction that ha done the
trickit religion it pieti as pai especi when it print
then the unsophist youth would go awai hi heart too full for
word but ponder how these thing were and byandbi he would pass
into the meeson meltingpot and learn someth about it
on dai king meeson sat in hi count hous count out hi monei or
at least look over the book of the firm he wa in a veri bad
temper and hi heavi brow were wrinkl up in a wai calcul to make
the countinghous clerk shake on their stool meeson had a branch
establish at sydnei in australia which establish had until
late been payingit is true not as well as the english on but
still fifteen or twenti per cent but now a wonder had come to pass a
great american publish firm had start an opposit hous in
melbourn and their cute wa more than the cute of meeson
did meeson publish an edit of the work of ani standard author at
threepenc per volum the opposit compani brought out the same work at
twopencehalfpenni did meeson subsidis a newspap to puff their
undertak the opposit firm subsidis two to cry them down and so
on and now the result of all thi were becom appar for the
financi year just end the australian branch had bare earn a
beggarli net dividend of seven per cent
no wonder mr meeson wa furiou and no wonder that the clerk shook
upon their stool
thi must be seen into no 3 said mr meeson bring hi fist down
with a bang on to the balancesheet
no 3 wa on of the editor a mildei littl man with blue
spectacl he had onc been a writer of promis but somehow meeson
had got him for it own and turn him into a publish hack
quit so sir he said humbl it is veri badit is dread to think
of meeson come down to seven per centseven per cent and he held
up hi hand
dont stand there like a stuck pig no 3 said mr meeson fierc
but suggest someth
well sir said no 3 more humbl than ever for he wa terribl afraid
of hi employ i think perhap that somebodi had better go to
australia and see what can be done
i know on thing that can be done said mr meeson with a snarl all
those fool out there can be sack and sack thei shall be and
what more ill go and sack them myself that will do no 3 that will
do and no 3 depart and glad enough he wa to go

eustac had defi him andwhat wa worseh had told him the truth
which he of all men could not bear he had said that hi system of
trade wa dishonest that he took more than hi due and it wa so he
knew it but he could not toler that it should be told him and that
hi whole life should therebi be discredit and even hi accumul
gold tarnishedstamp as illgotten least of all could he bear it
from hi depend he wa not altogeth a bad man nobodi is he wa
onli a coars vulgar tradesman harden and defil by a long career
of sharp deal at the bottom he had hi feel like other men but
he could not toler exposur or even contradict therefor he had
reveng himself and yet as he sat there in solitari glori he
realiz that to reveng doe not bring happi and could even find
it in hi heart to envi the steadfast honesti that had defi him at the
cost of hi own ruin
not that he meant to relent or alter hi determin mr meeson never
relent and never chang hi mind had he done so he would not at
that moment have been the master of two million of monei

when augusta left meeson she wa in a veri sad condit of mind to
explain which it will be necessari to sai a word or two about that young
ladi previou histori her father had been a clergyman and like most
clergymen not overburden with the good thing of thi world when mr
smithersor rather the rev jame smithershad di he left behind
him a widow and two childrenaugusta ag fourteen and jeanni ag

between augusta and jeanni but thei had both preced their father to
the land of shadow mr smither had fortun for herself a life

mr smither had been a save woman and on her death it wa found
that after pai all debt there remain a sum of 600 for the two
girl to live on and noth els for their mother fortun di with
her now it will be obviou that the interest aris from six hundr

take her to the moon ala she had not the monei and did not know where
to turn to get it oh reader prai to heaven that it mai never be your
lot to see your best belov die for the want of a few hundr pound

littl face that her ey fell on although it wa so shockingli thin
with long curv lash delic nostril and a mouth shape like a

befor i di
here the girl who had been speak with a curiou air of certainti and
with a graviti and deliber extraordinari for on so young suddenli
broke off to cough her sister threw herself on her knee besid her
and clasp her in her arm implor her in broken accent not to talk
of dy jeanni drew augusta golden head down on her breast and
stroke it
veri well gussi i wont sai ani more about it she said but it is
no good hide the truth dear i am tire of fight against it it is
no goodnon at all anyhow we have love each other veri much dear
and perhapssomewher elsew mai againand the brave littl heart
again broke down and overcom by the prescienc of approach
separ thei both sob bitterli there upon the sofa present came
a knock at the door and augusta sprang up and turn to hide her tear
it wa the maidofallwork bring the tea and as she came blunder
in a sens of the ironi of thing forc itself into augusta soul
here thei were plung into the most terribl sorrow weep at the
inevit approach of that chill end and still appear must be
kept up even befor a maidofallwork societi even when repres
by a maidofallwork cannot do awai with the intrus of domest
grief or ani other grief and in our heart we know it and act up to
it far gone inde must we be in mental or physic agoni befor we
abandon the attempt to keep up appear
augusta drank a littl tea and at a veri small bit of breadandbutt
as in the case of mr meeson the event of the dai had not tend to
increas her appetit jeanni drank a littl milk but at noth when
thi form had been gone through and the maidofallwork had onc more
made her appear and clear the tabl jeanni spoke again
gu she said i want you to put me to bed and then come and read to
me out of jemima vowwher poor jemima di you know it is the
most beauti thing in the book and i want to hear it again
her sister did as she wish and take down jemima vow jeanni
own copi as it wa call be the veri first that had come into the
hous she open it at the part jeanni had ask for and read aloud
keep her voic as steadi as she could as a matter of fact howev
the scene itself wa as power as it wa pathet and quit suffici
to account for ani unseemli exhibit of feel on the part of the
reader howev she struggl through it till the last sentenc wa
reach it ran thusand so jemima stretch out her hand to him and
said goodby and present know that she had now kept her
promis and be happi becaus she had done so she went to sleep
ah murmur the blueei child who listen i wish that i wa as
good as jemima but though i have no vow to keep i can sai goodby
and i can go to sleep
augusta made no answer and present jeanni doze off her sister
look at her with eager affect she is give up she said to
herself and if she give up she will die i know it it is becaus we
ar not go awai how can i get the monei now that that horribl man
is gone how can i get it and she buri her head in her hand and
thought present an idea struck her she might go back to meeson and
eat her word and sell him the copyright of her new book for 100 as
the agreement provid that would not be enough howev for travel
with an invalid is expens but she might offer to bind herself over to
him for a term of year as a tame author like those who work in the
hutch she wa sure that he would be glad to get her if onli he could
do so at hi own price it would be slaveri wors than ani penal
servitud and even now she shudder at the prospect of prostitut her
great abil to the necess of such work as meeson made their
thousand out ofwork out of which everi spark of origin wa
stamp into nothing as though it were the mark of the beast ye
it would be dreadfulit would break her heart but she wa prepar to
have her heart broken and her geniu wrung out of her by inch if onli
she could get two hundr pound wherewith to take jeanni awai to the
south of franc mr meeson would no doubt make a hard bargainth
hardest he could but still if she would consent to bind herself for a
suffici number of year at a suffici low salari he would
probabl advanc her a hundr pound besid the hundr for the
copyright of the new book
and so have made up her mind to the sacrific she went to bed and
weari out with miseri to sleep and even as she slept a presenc that
she could not see wa stand near her bed and a voic that she could
not hear wa call through the gloom anoth mortal had bent low at
the feet of that unknown god whom men name death and been born awai on
hi rush pinion into the space of the hid on more human item lai
still and stiff on more account wa close for good or evil the echo
of on more tread had pass from the earth for ever the old
millionnumb tragedi in which all must take a part had repeat
itself onc more down to it last and most aw scene ye the grim
farc wa plai out and the littl actor jeanni wa white in death
just at the dawn augusta dream that somebodi with cold breath wa
breath on her face and woke up with a start and listen jeanni
bed wa on the other side of the room and she could gener hear her
movement plainli enough for the sick child wa a restless sleeper but
now she could hear noth not even the faint vibrat of her sister
breath the silenc wa absolut and appal it struck tangibl upon
her sens as the dark struck upon her eyebal and fill her with
a numb unreason terror she slip out of bed and struck a match in
anoth few second she wa stand by jeanni white littl bed
wait for the wick of the candl to burn up present the light grew
jeanni wa ly on her side her white face rest on her white arm
her ey were wide open but when augusta held the candl near her she
did not shut them or flinch her hand toooh heaven the finger
were nearli cold
then augusta understood and lift up her arm in agoni she shriek
till the whole hous rang
chapter iv
augusta decis
on the second dai follow the death of poor littl jeanni smither
mr eustac meeson wa stroll about birmingham with hi hand in hi
pocket and an air of indecis on hi decidedli agreeabl and
gentlemanlik counten eustac meeson wa not particularli cast down
by the extraordinari revers of fortun which he had recent
experienc he wa a young gentleman of a cheer natur and besid
it did not so veri much matter to him he wa in a bless condit of
celibaci and had no wife and children depend upon him and he knew
that somehow or other it would go hard if with the help of the on
hundr a year that he had of hi own he did not manag with hi
educ to get a live by hook or by crook so it wa not the loss of
the societi of hi respect uncl or the prospect enjoy of two
million of monei which wa troubl him inde after he had onc
clear hi good and chattel out of pompadour hall and settl them in
a room in an hotel he had not given the matter much thought but he had
given a good mani thought to augusta smither grei ey and by wai of
get an insight into her charact he had at onc invest in a copi
of jemima vow therebi somewhat against hi will swell the gain
of meeson to the extent of sever shill now jemima vow
though simpl and home wa a most strike and power book which
fulli deserv the reput that it had gain and it affect
eustacewho wa in so much differ from most young men of hi ag that
he realli did know the differ between good work and badmor
strongli than he would have like to own inde at the termin of
the stori what between the beauti of augusta page the memori of
augusta ey and the knowledg of augusta wrong mr eustac meeson
began to feel veri much as though he had fallen in love accordingli he
went out walk and meet a clerk whom he had known in the meeson
establishmenton of those who had been discharg on the same dai as
himselfh obtain from him miss smither address and began to
reflect as to whether or no he should call upon her unabl to make up
hi mind he continu to walk till he reach the quiet street where
augusta live and suddenli perceiv the hous of which the clerk had
told him yield to temptat and rang
the door wa answer by the maidofallwork who look at him a littl
curious but said that miss smither wa in and then conduct him to
a door which wa half open and left him in that kindli and agreeabl
fashion that maidsofallwork have eustac wa perplex and look
through the door to see if anyon wa in the room discov augusta
herself dress in some dark materi seat in a chair her hand
fold on her lap her pale face set like a stone and her ey gleam
into vacanc he paus wonder what could be the matter and as he
did so hi umbrella slip from hi hand make a nois that render
it necessari for him to declar himself
augusta rose as he advanc and look at him with a puzzl air as
though she wa strive to recal hi name or where she had met him
i beg your pardon he stammer i must introduc myself as the girl
ha desert mei am eustac meeson
augusta face harden at the name if you have come to me from messr
meeson and cosh said quickli and then broke off as though struck
by some new idea
inde no said eustac i have noth in common with messr
meeson now except my name and i have onli come to tell you how sorri
i wa to see you treat as you were by my uncl you rememb i wa in
the offic
ye she said with a suspicion of a blush i rememb you were
veri kind
well you see he went on i had a great row with my uncl after that
and it end in hi turn me out of the place bag and baggag and
inform me that he wa go to cut me off with a shill which he
ad reflect he ha probabl done by now
do i understand you mr meeson to mean that you quarrel with your
uncl about me and my book
ye that is so he said
it wa veri chivalr of you she answer look at him with a
newborn curios augusta wa not accustom to find knightserr
thu prepar at such cost to themselv to break a lanc in her caus
least of all wa she prepar to find that knight bear the hate
crest of meesonif inde meeson had a crest
i ought to apologis she went on present after an awkward paus
for make such a scene in the offic but i want monei so dreadfulli
and it wa so hard to be refus but it doe not matter now it is all
done with
there wa a dull hopeless ring about her voic that awok hi
curios for what could she have want the monei and why did she no
longer want it
i am sorri he said will you tell me what you want it so much for
she look at him and then act upon impuls rather then reflect
said in a low voic
if you like i will show you
he bow wonder what wa come next rise from her chair augusta
led the wai to a door which open out of the sittingroom and gentli
turn the handl and enter eustac follow her the room wa a small
bedroom of which the fade calico blind had been pull down as it
happen howev the sunlight such as it wa beat full upon the
blind and came through it in yellow bar thei fell upon the furnitur
of the bare littl room thei fell upon the iron bedstead and upon
someth ly on it which he did not at first notic becaus it wa
cover with a sheet
augusta walk up to the bed and gentli lift the sheet reveal the
sweet face fring round about with golden hair of littl jeanni in
her coffin
eustac gave an exclam and start back violent he had not been
prepar for such a sight inde it wa the first such sight that he had
ever seen and it shock him beyond word augusta familiaris as she
wa herself with the companionship of thi beauteou clai cold terror
had forgotten that suddenli and without warn to bring the live into
the presenc of the dead is not the wisest or the kindest thing to do
for to the live more especi to the young the sight of death is
horribl it is such a fearsom comment on their health and strength
youth and strength ar merri but who can be merri with yon dead thing in
the upper chamber take it awai thrust it underground it is an insult
to us it remind us that we too die like other what busi ha it
pallor to show itself against our ruddi cheek
i beg your pardon whisper augusta realis someth of all thi
in a flash i forgot you do not knowyou must be shockedforg me
who is it he said gasp to get back hi breath
my sister she answer it wa to try and save her life that i want
the monei when i told her that i could not get it she gave up and di
your uncl kill her come
greatli shock he follow her back into the sittingroom and thena
soon as he got hi composureapologis for have intrud himself upon
her in such an hour of desol
i am glad to see you she said simpli i have seen nobodi except
the doctor onc and the undertak twice it is dread to sit alon
hour after hour face to face with the irretriev if i had not been
so foolish as to enter into that agreement with messr meeson i
could have got the monei by sell my new book easili enough and i
should have been abl to take jeanni abroad and i believ that she
would have livedat least i hope so but now it is finish and
cannot be help
i wish i had known blunder eustac i could have lent you the
monei i have a hundr and fifti pound
you ar veri good she answer gentli but it is no us talk about
it now it is finish
then eustac rose and went awai and it wa not till he found himself in
the street that he rememb that he had never ask augusta what her
plan were inde the sight of poor jeanni had put everyth els out
of hi head howev he consol himself with the reflect that he
could call again a week or ten dai after the funer
two dai later augusta follow the remain of her dearli belov sister
to their last rest place and then came home on foot for she wa the
onli mourner and sat in her black gown befor the littl fire and
reflect upon her posit what wa she to do she could not stai in
these room it made her heart ach everi time her ey fell upon the
empti sofa opposit dint as it wa with the accustom weight of poor
jeanni frame where wa she to go and what wa she to do she might
get literari employ but then her agreement with messr meeson
stare her in the face that agreement wa veri wide drawn it bound
her to offer all literari work of ani sort that might come from her pen
dure the next five year to messr meeson at the fix rate of seven
per cent on the publish price obvious as it seem to her though
perhap erron thi claus might be stretch to includ even a
newspap articl and she knew the malign natur of mr meeson well
enough to be quit certain that if possibl that would be done it wa
true she might manag to make a bare live out of her work even at the
beggarli pai of seven per cent but augusta wa a person of spirit and
determin that she would rather starv than that meeson should again
make huge profit out of her labour thi avenu be close to her she
turn her mind elsewher but look where she might the prospect wa
equal dark
augusta remark literari success had not been of much practic
advantag to her for in thi countri literari success doe not mean so
much as it doe in some other as a matter of fact inde the averag
briton ha at heart a consider contempt if not for literatur at
least for those who produc it literatur in hi mind is connect
with the idea of garret and extrem poverti and therefor have the
nation respect for monei he in secret if not in public despis it
a tree is known by it fruit sai he let a man succe at the bar and
he make thousand upon thousand a year and is promot to the highest
offic in the state let a man succe in art and he will be paid on
or two thousand pound apiec for hi most potboileri portrait but
your literari menwhi with a few fortun except the best of them
bare make a live what can literatur be worth if a man cant make a
fortun out of it so argu the britonno doubt with some of hi sound
common sens not that he ha no respect for geniu all men bow to true
geniu even when thei fear and envi it but he think a good deal more
of geniu dead than geniu live howev thi mai be there is no doubt
but that if through ani causesuch for instanc as the sudden
discoveri by the great and highli civil american peopl that the
seventh command wa probabl intend to appli to author amongst
the rest of the worldth pecuniari reward of literari labor should be
put more upon an equal with those of other trade literaturea a
professionwil go up mani step in popular esteem at present if a
member of a famili ha betaken himself to the high and honour call
for sure it is both of letter hi friend and relat ar apt to
talk about him in a shy and diffid not to sai apologet wai much
as thei would had he adopt anoth sort of bookmak as a mean of
livelihood
thu it wa that notwithstand her success augusta had nowher to
turn in her difficulti she had absolut no literari connect nobodi
had call upon her and sought her out in consequ of her book on
or two author in london and a few unknown peopl from differ part
of the countri and abroad had written to herthat wa all had she
live in town it might have been differ but unfortun for her
she did not
the more she thought the less clear did her path becom until at last
she got an inspir why not leav england altogeth she had noth
to keep her here she had a cousina clergymanin new zealand whom she
had never seen but who had read jemima vow and written her a kind
letter about it that wa the on delight thing about write book
on made friend all over the world sure he would take her in for a
while and put her in the wai of earn a live where meeson would not
be to molest her why should she not go she had twenti pound left and
the furnitur which includ an expens invalid chair and book
would fetch anoth thirti or soenough to pai for a secondclass
passag and leav a few pound in her pocket at the worst it would be a
chang and she could not go through more there than she did here so
that veri night she sat down and wrote to her clergyman cousin
chapter v
the rm kangaroo
it wa on a tuesdai even that a mighti vessel wa steam
majest out of the mouth of the thame and shape her impos
cours straight at the ball of the set sun most peopl will rememb
read descript of the steamship kangaroo and be astonish at
the power of her engin the beauti of her fit and the
extraordinari speedabout eighteen knotswhich she develop in her
trial with an unusu low expenditur of coal for the benefit of
those who have not howev it mai be state that the kangaroo the
littl kangaroo as she wa iron name among sailor men wa the
veri latest develop of the scienc of modern shipbuild
everyth about her from the electr light and boiler tube up wa on
a new and patent system
four hundr feet and more she measur from stem to stern and in that
space were crowd and pack all the luxuri of a palac and all the
conveni of an american hotel she wa a beauti and a wonder
thing to look on as with her hold full of costli merchandis and her
deck crowd with her live freight of about a thousand human be
she steam slowli out to sea as though loth to leav the land where she
wa born but present she seem to gather up her energi and to grow
consciou of the thousand and thousand of mile of wide toss water
which stretch between her and the faroff harbour where her mighti
heart should ceas from beat and be for a while at rest quicker and
quicker she sped along and spurn the churn water from her swift
side she wa run under a full head of steam now and the coastlin
of england grew faint and low in the faint low light till at last it
almost vanish from the gaze of a tall slim girl who stood forward
cling to the starboard bulwark net and look with deep grei ey
across the wast of water present augusta for it wa she could see
the shore no more and turn to watch the other passeng and think
she wa sad at heart poor girl and felt what she wasa veri waif upon
the sea of life not that she had much to regret upon the vanish
coastlin a littl grave with a white cross over itthat wa all she
had left no friend to weep for her none but even as she thought it a
recollect rose up in her mind of eustac meeson pleasant handsom
face and of hi kind word and with it came a pang as she reflect
that in all probabl she should never see the on or hear the other
again why she wonder had he not come to see her again she should
have like to bid him goodby and had half a mind to send him a note
and tell him of her go thi on second thought howev she had
decid not to do for on thing she did not know hi address
andwel there wa an end of it
could she by the mean of clairvoy have seen eustac face and heard
hi word she would have regret her decis for even as that great
vessel plung on her fierc wai right into the heart of the gather

must be told he had to hi credit be it said fallen deepli truli and
violent in love inde so far wa he in thi wai gone that he had
determin to make all the progress that he could and if he thought that
there wa ani prospect of success to declar hi passion thi wa
perhap a littl prematur but then in these matter peopl ar apt to
be more prematur than is gener suppos human natur is veri swift
in come to conclus in matter in which that strang mixtur we
call the affect ar involv perhap becaus although the
conclus is not altogeth a pleas on the affect at ani rate
in the begin ar larg depend on the sens
piti a poor young man to come from london to birmingham to woo on
greyei mistress in a thirdclass carriag too and find her gone to
new zealand whither circumst prevent him from follow her
without leav a word or a line or even an address behind her it wa
too bad well there wa no remedi in the matter so he walk to the
railwai station and groan and swore all the wai back to london
augusta on board the kangaroo wa howev in utter ignor of thi
act of devot on the part of her admir inde she did not even know
that he wa her admir feel a curiou sink sensat within her
she wa about to go below to her cabin which she share with a

gruff tone and inform her that if she want to see the last of hold
halbion she had better go aft a bit and look over the port side and
she would see the someth or other light accordingli more to prove to
herself that she wa not seasick than for ani other reason she did so
and stand as far aft as the secondclass passeng were allow to
go stare at the quick flash of the lighthous as second by second
thei sent their messag across the great wast of sea
as she stood there hold on to a stanchion to steadi herself for the

and half stupid for the next three dai on the fourth dai howev she
reappear on deck quit recov and with an excel appetit she
had her breakfast and then went and sat forward in as quiet a place as
she could find she did not want to see mr meeson ani more and she did
want to escap from the stori of her cabinm the ladysmaid thi
good person would after the manner of her kind insist upon repeat to

chroniqu scandaleus so she went forward and wa sit look
at the white hors chase each other across the wateri plain and
reflect upon what the condit of mind of those ladi whose

howev much it exagger the measur of her poor capac and
put other thing asid wa come as it did from on woman to
anoth peculiarli grace and surpris she blush and bow
scarc know what to sai when suddenli mr meeson harsh tone
pitch just now in a respect kei broke upon her ear mr meeson wa
address no less a person than lord holmhurst gcmg lord holmhurst
wa a stout short dark littl man with a somewhat pompou manner and
a kindli face he wa a coloni governor of the first water and wa
perfectli awar of the fact
now a coloni governor even though he be a gcmg when he is at
home is not a name to conjur with and doe not fill an exclus place
in the ey of the english world there ar mani coloni governor in the
present and past tens to be found in the purlieu of south kensington
where their presenc creat no unusu excit but when on of thi
honour corp set foot upon the vessel destin to bear him to the
shore that he shall rule all thi chang he put off the bodi of the
ordinari betitl individu and put on the bodi of the celesti
brotherhood in short from be nobodi out of the common he becom
and veri properli so a great man nobodi knew thi better than lord
holmhurst and to a person fond of observ such thing noth could
have been more curiou to notic than the small but gradual increas of
the pompos of hi manner as the great ship dai by dai steam further
from england and nearer to the countri where he wa king it went up
degre by degre like a thermomet which is taken down into the bowel
of the earth or gradual remov into the sunlight at present howev
the thermomet wa onli rise
i wa repeat my lord said the harsh voic of mr meeson that
the principl of an hereditari peerag is the grandest principl our
countri ha yet develop it give us someth to look forward to in
on gener we make the monei in the next we take the titl which
the monei bui look at your lordship your lordship is now in a proud
posit but as i have understood your lordship father wa a
trader like me
humwel not exactli mr meeson broke in lord holmhurst dear
me i wonder who that exceedingli nicelook girl ladi holmhurst is
talk to can be
now your lordship to put a case went on the remorseless meeson who
like most peopl of hi stamp had an almost superstiti vener for
the aristocraci i have made a great deal of monei as i do not mind
tell your lordship what is there to prevent my successorsuppos i
have a successorfrom take advantag of that monei and rise on it
to a similar posit to that so worthili occupi by your lordship
exactli mr meeson a most excel idea for your successor excus
me but i see ladi holmhurst beckon to me and he fled precipit
still follow by mr meeson
john my dear said ladi holmhurst i want to introduc you to miss
smithersth miss smither whom we have all been talk about and
whose book you have been read miss smither my husband
lord holmhurst who when he wa not deep in the affair of state had a
consider ey for a pretti girland what man worthi of the name ha
notbow most polit and wa proceed to tell augusta in veri
charm languag how delight he wa to make her acquaint when
mr meeson arriv on the scene and perceiv augusta for the first time
quit taken aback at find her appar upon the veri best of term
with peopl of such qualiti he hesit to consid what cours to
adopt whereon ladi holmhurst in a somewhat formal wai for she wa not
veri fond of mr meeson mistak hi hesit went on to introduc
him thereupon all in a moment as we do sometim take such
resolut augusta came to a determin she would have noth more
to do with mr meesonsh would repudi him then and there come what
would of it
so as he advanc upon her with outstretch hand she drew herself up
and in a cold and determin voic said i alreadi know mr meeson ladi
holmhurst and i do not wish to have anyth more to do with him mr
meeson ha not behav well to me
pon my word murmur lord holmhurst to himself i dont wonder she
ha had enough of him sensibl young woman that
ladi holmhurst look a littl astonish and a littl amus suddenli
howev a light broke upon her
oh i see she said i suppos that mr meeson publish jemima
vow of cours that account for it why i declar there is the dinner
bell come along miss smither or we shall lose the place the captain
ha promis us and accordingli thei went leav mr meeson who
had not yet realiz the unpreced natur of the posit posit
gasp on the deck and on board the kangaroo there were no clerk and
editor on whom he could wreck hi wrath
and now my dear miss smither said ladi holmhurst when dinner
be over thei were sit togeth in the moonlight near the
wheel perhap you will tell me why you dont like mr meeson
whom bythewai i person detest but dont if you dont wish
to you know
but augusta did wish to and then and there she unfold her whole sad
stori into her newfound friend sympathet ear and glad enough the
poor girl wa to find a confid to whom she could unbosom her sorrow
well upon my word said ladi holmhurst when she had listen with
tear in her ey to the histori of poor littl jeanni death upon my
word of all the brute i ever heard of i think that thi publish of
your is the worst i will cut him and get my husband to cut him too
but no i have a better plan than that he shall tear up that agreement
so sure as my name is bessi holmhurst he shall tear it up ororand
she nod her littl head with an air of infinit wisdom
chapter vi
mr tombei goe forward
from that dai forward the voyag on the kangaroo wa until the last
dread catastroph a veri happi on for augusta lord and ladi holmhurst
made much of her and all the rest of the firstclass passeng follow
suit and soon she found herself the most popular charact on board the
two copi of her book that there were on the ship were pass on from
hand to hand till thei would hardli hang togeth and realli at last
she got quit tire of hear of her own creation but thi wa not
all augusta wa it will be rememb an exceedingli pretti woman and
melancholi as the fact mai seem it still remain a fact that a pretti
woman is in the ey of most peopl a more interest object than a man
or than a ladi who is not built that wai thu it came to pass that
what between her youth her beauti her talent and her misfortunesfor
ladi holmhurst had not exactli kept that histori to herselfaugusta wa
all of a sudden elev into the posit of a perfect heroin it
realli almost frighten the poor girl who had been accustom to
noth but sorrow illtreat and grind poverti to suddenli find
herself in thi strang posit with everi man on board that great
vessel at her beck and call but she wa human and therefor of cours
she enjoi it it is someth when on ha been wander for hour
after hour in the wet and melancholi night suddenli to see the fair dawn
break and burn overhead and to know that the worst is over for
now there will be light wherebi to set our feet it is someth too to
the most christian soul to utterli and complet triumph over on who
had done all in hi power to crush and destroi you whose grasp greed
ha indirectli been the caus of the death of the person you love best
in the whole world round and she did triumph as mr meeson conduct to
her got about the littl societi of the shipwhich wa after all a
veri fair exampl of all societi in miniaturefel awai from thi
publish princ and not even the jingl of hi moneybag could lure
it back he the great the practic omnipot the owner of two
million and the hard master of hundr upon whose toil he batten
wa practic cut even the clerk who wa go out on a chanc of
get a place in a new zealand bank would have noth to sai to him
and what is more he felt it more even than an ordinari individu would
have done he the printerdevil as poor littl jeanni us to call
him he to be slight and flout by a pack of peopl whom he could bui
up three time over and all on account of a wretch authoressan
authoress if you pleas it made mr meeson veri wilda state of
affair which wa brought to a climax when on morn lord holmhurst
who had for sever dai been show a grow dislik to hi societi
actual almost cut him dead that is he did not notic hi outstretch
hand and pass him with a slight bow
never mind my lordnev mind mutter mr meeson after that
somewhat pompou but amiabl nobleman retreat form well see if i
cant come squar with you im a dog who can pull a string or two in the
english press i am those who have the monei and have got a hold of
peopl so that thei must write what thei tell them aint peopl to be
cut by ani coloni governor my lord and in hi anger he fairli shook
hi fist at the unconsci peer
seem to be a littl out of temper mr meeson said a voic at
hi elbow the owner of which wa a big young man with hard but
kindli featur and a larg moustach what ha the governor been
do to you
do mr tombei he been cut me that allm
meesoncut me as dead as offal or someth like it i held out my
hand and he look right over it and march by
ah said mr tombei who wa a wealthi new zealand landown and now
why do you suppos he did that
why ill tell you why it all about that girl
miss smither do you mean said tombei the big with a curiou flash
of hi deepset ey
ye miss smither she wrote a book and i bought the book for fifti
pound and stuck a claus in that she should give me the right to
publish anyth she wrote for five year at a pricea common sort of
thing enough in on wai and anoth when you ar deal with some idiot
who dont know ani better well as it happen thi book sold like
wildfir and in time the young ladi come to me and want more monei
want to get out of the hang claus in the agreement want
everyth like a femal oliv twist and when i sai no you dont
lose her temper and make a scene and it turn out that what she
want the monei for wa to take a sick sister or cousin or aunt or
someon out of england and when she could not do it and the relat
di then she emigr and goe and tell the peopl on board ship
that it is all my fault
and i suppos that that is a conclus that you do not feel drawn to
mr meeson
no tombei i dont busi is busi and if i happen to have got to
windward of the young woman why so much the better for me she
get her experi that all and she aint the first and wont be
the last but if she goe sai much more about me i go for her for
slander that sure
on the legal ground that the greater the truth the greater the libel
i presum
confound her went on meeson without notic hi remark and
contract hi heavi eyebrow there no end to the troubl she ha
brought on me i quarrel with my nephew about her and now she
drag my name through the dirt here and ill bet the stori will go
all over new zealand and australia
ye said mr tombei i fanci you will find it take a lot of
choke and now mr meeson with your permiss i will sai a word
and try and throw a new light upon a veri perplex matter it never
seem to have occur to you what an outandout blackguard you ar so
i mai as well put it to you plainli if you ar not a thief you ar at
least a veri wellcolour imit you take a girl book and make
hundr upon hundr out of it and give her fifti you tie her down
so as to provid for success swindl of the same sort dure
futur year and then when she come to beg a few pound of you you
show her the door and now you wonder mr meeson that respect
peopl will have noth to do with you well now i tell you my
opinion is that the onli societi to which you would be realli suit is
that of cowhid good morn and the larg young man walk off hi
veri moustachio curl with wrath and contempt thu for a second
time did the great mr meeson hear the truth from the lip of babe and
suckl and the worst of it wa that he could not disinherit number
two as he had number on
now thi will strike the reader as be veri warm advocaci on the part
of mr tombei who be call in to consol and bless curs with
such extraordinari vigour it mai even strike the discern readerand
all reader or at least nearli all reader ar of cours discern
far too much so indeedthat there must have been a reason for it and
the discern reader will be right augusta grei ey had been too
much for mr tombei as thei had been too much for eustac meeson befor
him hi passion had sprung up and ripen in that peculiarli rapid and
vigor fashion that passion do on board ship a passeng steamer is
cupid own hotb and in thi wai differ from a sailingship on the
sailingship inde the preliminari stage ar the same the seed root
as strongli and grow and flower with equal vigour but here come the
melancholi partit wither and decai with equal rapid the voyag is
too long too much is mutual reveal the matrimoni iron cannot be
struck while it is hot and long befor the weari nineti dai ar over it
is onc more cold and black or at the best glow with but a feebl heat
but on the steamship there is no time for thi as ani travel know
myselfi the historianhav with my own ey seen a coupl meet for
the first time at maderia get marri at the cape and go on as man and
wife in the same vessel to natal and therefor it came to pass that
veri even a touch and on the whole melancholi littl scene wa
enact near the smokestack of the kangaroo
mr tombei and miss augusta smither were lean togeth over the
bulwark and watch the phosphoresc foam go flash past mr
tombei wa nervou and ill at eas miss smither veri much at eas and
reflect that her companion moustachio would veri well becom a
villain in a novel
mr tombei look at the starspangl sky on which the southern cross
hung low and he look at the phosphoresc sea but from neither did
inspir come inspir is from within and not from without at
last howev he made a gallant and a desper effort
miss smither he said in a voic trembl with agit
ye mr tombei answer augusta quietli what is it
miss smither he went onmiss augusta i dont know what you
will think of me but i must tell you i cant keep it ani longer i
love you
augusta fairli jump mr tombei had been veri even markedli polit
and she not be a fool had seen that he admir her but she had
never expect thi and the sudden with which the shot wa fire wa
somewhat bewild
why mr tombei she said in a surpris voic you have onli known me
for a littl more than a fortnight
i fell in love with you when i had onli known you for an hour he
answer with evid sincer pleas listen to me i know i am not
worthi of you but i do love you so veri dearli and i would make you a
good husband inde i would i am well off though of cours that is
noth and if you dont like new zealand i would give it up and go to
live in england do you think that you can take me if you onli knew how
dearli i love you i am sure you would
augusta collect her wit as well as she could the man evid did
love her there wa no doubt the sincer of hi word and she like
him and he wa a gentleman if she marri him there would be an end of
all her worri and troubl and she could rest contentedli on hi
strong arm woman even gift woman is not made to fight the world with
her own hand and the prospect had allur but while she thought
eustac meeson bonni face rose befor her ey and as it did so a
faint feel of repuls to the man who wa plead with her took form
and colour in her breast eustac meeson of cours wa noth to her
no word or sign of affect had pass between them and the probabl
wa that she would never set her ey upon him again and yet that face
rose up between her and thi man who wa plead at her side mani
women like enough have seen some such vision from the past and have
disregard it onli to find too late that that which is thrust asid is
not necessarili hidden for ala those face of our depart youth have
an uncanni trick of rise from the tomb of our forget but
augusta wa not of the great order of opportunist becaus a thing might
be conveni it did not accord to the dictat of her moral sens
follow that it wa law therefor she wa a woman to be respect
for a woman who except under most except circumst give her
instinct the lie in order to pander to her conveni or her desir for
wealth and social eas is not altogeth a woman to be respect
in a veri few second she had made up her mind
i am veri much oblig to you mr tombei she said you have done me
a great honour the greatest honour man can do to a woman but i cannot
marri you
ar you sure gasp the unfortun tombei for hi hope had been
high is there no hope for me perhap there is somebodi els
there is nobodi els mr tombei and i am sorri to sai you dont know
how much it pain me to sai it i cannot hold out ani prospect that i
shall chang my mind
he drop hi head upon hi hand for a minut and then lift it
again
veri well he said slowli it cant be help i never love ani
woman befor and i never shall again it is a piti with a hard
littl laughthat so much firstclass affect should be wast
but there you ar it is all part and parcel of the pleasant
experi which make up our live goodby miss smither at least
goodby as a friend
we can still be friend she falter
oh no he answer with anoth laugh that is an explod notion
friendship of that natur is not veri safe under ani circumst
certainli not under these the relationship is antagonist to the fact
of life and the friend or on or other of them will drift either
into indiffer and dislik orsometh warmer you ar a novelist
miss smither perhap some dai you will write a book to explain why
peopl fall in love where their affect is not want and what
purpos their distress can possibl serv and now onc more good
bye and he lift her hand to hi lip and gentli kiss it and then
with a bow turn and went
from all of which it will be clearli seen that mr tombei wa decidedli a
young man abov the averag and on who took punish veri well
augusta look after him and sigh deepli and even wipe awai a tear
then she turn and walk aft to where ladi holmhurst wa sit
enjoi the balmi southern air through which the great ship wa rush
with outspread sail like some huge white bird and chat to the
captain as she came up the captain made hi bow and depart sai
that he had someth to see to and for a minut ladi holmhurst and
augusta were left alon
well augusta said ladi holmhurst for she call her augusta now
and what have you done with that young man mr tombeythat veri nice
young man she ad with emphasi
i think that mr tombei went forward said augusta
the two women look at each other and womanlik each understood what
the other meant ladi holmhurst had not been altogeth innoc in the
tombei affair
ladi holmhurst said augusta take the bull by the horn mr tombei
ha been speak to me and ha
propos to you suggest ladi holmhurst admir the southern cross
through her eyeglass you said he went forward you know
ha propos to me answer augusta ignor the littl joke i
regret she went on hurriedli that i have not been abl to fall in
with mr tombei plan
ah said ladi holmhurst i am sorri for some thing mr tombei is
such a veri nice young man and so veri gentlemanlik i thought that
perhap it might suit your view and it would have simplifi your
futur arrang but as to that of cours while you ar in new
zealand i shall be abl to see to that bythewai it is understood
that you come to stai with us for a few month at govern hous
befor you hunt up your cousin
you ar veri good to me ladi holmhurst said augusta with someth
like a sob
suppos my dear answer the great ladi lai her littl hand upon
augusta beauti hair that you were to drop the ladi holmhurst and
call me bessi it sound so much more sociabl you know and
besid it is shorter and doe not wast so much breath
then augusta sob outright for her nerv were shaken you dont know
what your kind mean to me she said i have never had a friend
and sinc my darl di i have been so veri lone
chapter vii
the catastroph
and so these two fair women talk make plan for the futur as though
all thing endur forev and all plan were destin to be realiz
but even as thei talk somewher up in the high heaven the voic that
rule the world spoke a word and the messeng of fate rush forth to
do it bid on board the great ship wa music and laughter and the
sweet voic of sing women but abov it hung a pall of doom not the
most timid heart dream of danger what danger could there be aboard of
that grand ship which sped across the wave with the light and
confid of the swallow there wa naught to fear a prosper voyag
wa draw to it end and mother put their babe to sleep with as sure
a heart as though thei were on solid english ground oh sure when hi
overflow load of sorrow and dire miseri wa mete out to man some
gentl spirit plead for himthat he should not have foresight ad
to the tale that he should not see the fall knife or hear the water
lap that on dai shall entomb him or wa it kept back becaus man
have knowledg would be man without reasonfor terror would make him
mad and he would end hi fear by hurri their fulfil at least
we ar blind to the futur and let us be thank for it
present ladi holmhurst got up from her chair and said that she wa
go to bed but that first of all she must kiss dick her littl boi
who slept with hi nurs in anoth cabin augusta rose and went with
her and thei both kiss the sleep child a bonni boi of five and
then thei kiss each other and separ for the night
some hour afterward augusta woke up feel veri restless for an
hour or more she lai think of mr tombei and mani other thing and
listen to the swift lap lap of the water as it slip past the
vessel side and the occasion tramp of the watch as thei set fresh
sail at last her feel of unrest got too much for her and she rose
and partial veri partial dress herselffor in the gloom she
could onli find her flannel vest and petticoattwist her long hair
in a coil round her head put on a hat and a thick ulster that hung
upon the doorfor thei were run into chilli latitudesand slip
out on deck
it wa get toward dawn but the night wa still dark look up
augusta could onli just make out the outlin of the huge belli
sail for the kangaroo wa rush along befor the westerli wind under
a full head of steam and with everi inch of her canva set to eas the
screw there wa someth veri exhilar about the movement the
fresh of the night and the wild sweet song of the wind as it sang
amongst the rig augusta turn her face toward it and be
alon stretch out her arm as though to catch it the whole scene
awok some answer great in her heart someth that slumber in
the bosom of the higher race of human be and onli stirsand then
but faintlywhen the passion move them or when natur commun with
her nobler children she felt that at that moment she could write as she
had never written yet all sort of beauti idea all sort of
aspir after that nobl calm and puriti of thought and life for
which we prai and long but ar not allow to reach came flow into
her heart she almost thought that she could hear her lost jeanni
voic call down the gale and her strong imagin began to paint
her hover like a seabird upon white wing high abov the mainmast
taper point and gaze through the dark into the soul of her she
love then by those faint and impercept degre with which
thought fade on into anoth from jeanni her thought got round to
eustac meeson she wonder if he had ever call at the lodg at
birmingham after she left somehow she had an idea that he wa not
altogeth indiffer to her there had been a look in hi ey she did
not quit understand she almost wish now she had sent him a line or a
messag perhap she would do so from new zealand just then her
medit were interrupt by a step and turn round she found
herself face to face with the captain
why miss smither he said what on earth ar you do here at thi
hourmak up romanc
ye she answer laugh and with perfect truth the fact of
the matter is i could not sleep and so i came on deck and veri
pleasant it is
ye said the captain if you want someth to put into your stori
you wont find anyth better than thi the kangaroo is show her
heel isnt she miss smither that the beauti of her she can sail
as well as steam and when she ha a strong wind like thi abaft it
would have to be someth veri quick that would catch her i believ
that we have been run over seventeen knot an hour ever sinc
midnight i hope to make kerguelen island by seven oclock to correct my
chronomet
what is kerguelen island ask augusta
oh it is a desert place where nobodi goe except now and then a
whaler to fill up with water i believ that the astronom sent an
expedit there a few year ago to observ the transit of venu but
it wa a failur becaus the weather wa so mistyit is nearli alwai
misti there well i must be off miss smither good night or rather
good morn
befor the word were well out of hi mouth there wa a wild shout
forwardship ahead then came an aw yell from a dozen
voicesstarboard hardastarboard for god sake
with a wild leap like the leap of a man suddenli shot the captain left
her side and rush on to the bridg at the same instant the
enginebel rang and the steeringchain began to rattl furious on
the roller at her feet as the steam steeringgear did it work then
came anoth yell
it a whalerno light and an answer shriek of terror from
some big black object that loom ahead befor the echo had di awai
befor the great ship could even answer to her helm there wa a crash
such as augusta had never heard and a sicken shock that threw her on
her hand and knee on the deck shake the iron mast till thei
trembl as though thei were willow wand and make the huge sail flap
and for an instant fly aback the great vessel rush along at her
fright speed of seventeen knot had plung into the ship ahead with
such hideou energi that she cut her clean in twocut her in two and
pass over her as though she were a pleasureboat
shriek upon shriek of despair came pierc the gloomi night and then
as augusta struggl to her feet she felt a horribl success of
bump accompani by a crush grind nois it wa the kangaroo
drive right over the remain of the whaler
in a veri few second it wa done and look astern augusta could just
make out someth black that seem to float for a second or two upon
the water and then disappear into it depth it wa the shatter hull
of the whaler
then there aros a faint murmur sound that grew first into a hum
then into a roar and then into a clamour that rent the ski and up
from everi hatchwai and cabin in the great ship human beingsmen
women and childrencam rush and tumbl with face white with
terrorwhit as their nightgear some were absolut nake have
slip off their nightdress and had no time to put on anyth els

them or carri their cloth in their hand up thei came hundr and
hundr of them for there were a thousand soul on board the kangaroo
pour aft like terrifi spirit fly from the mouth of hell and
from them aros such a hideou clamour as few have live to hear
augusta clung to the net to let the rush go by try to collect
her scatter sens and to prevent herself from catch the dread
contagion of the panic be a brave and coolhead woman she
present succeed and with her return clear of vision she
realiz that she and all on board were in great peril it wa clear that
so fright a collis could not have taken place without injuri to
their own vessel noth short of an ironclad ram could have stood such
a shock probabl thei would founder in a few minut and all be
drown in a few minut she might be dead her heart stood still at the
horror of the thought but onc more she recov herself well after
all life had not been pleasant and she had noth to fear from anoth
world she had done no wrong then suddenli she began to think of the
other where wa ladi holmhurst and where were the boi and the nurs

at that instant there wa a loud report forward and the stern of the
vessel lift percept the bulkhead had given wai and there aros
such a yell as sure wa seldom heard befor to augusta ear it
seem to shape itself into the word sink
up from the bowel of the ship pour the firemen the appear of
whose blacken face line with white streak of perspir ad a
new impuls of terror to the panicstricken throng aft thei came
accompani by a crowd of sailor and emigr
rush the boat sung out a voic with a strong irish accent or sure
well be drown
take the hint the madden mob burst toward the boat like a flood
blasphem and shriek as it came in a moment the women and children
who were wait to take to the boat in which augusta and the two
seamen were alreadi were swept asid and a determin effort wa made
to rush it head by a great irishman the same who had call out
augusta saw mr tombei lord holmhurst who had come up and the offic
lift their pistol which explod almost simultan and the
irishman and anoth man pitch forward on to their hand and knee
never mind the pistol lad shout a voic as well be shot as

second fear rush wa made which bore the three gentlemen fire as
thei went right up against the net
bill halloa the man who wa hold on to the foremost tackl
lower awai we shall be rush and swamp
bill obei with heart and soul and down sank the boat below the level
of the upper deck just as the mob wa get the masteri in five
second more thei were hang close over the water and whilst thei were
in thi posit a man leapt at the boat from the bulwark he struck on
the thwart roll off into the water and wa no more seen a ladi the
wife of a coloni judg threw her child augusta tri to catch it but
miss and the boi sank and wa lost in anoth moment the two sailor
had shove off from the ship side as thei did so the stern of the
kangaroo lift right out of the water so that thei could see under her
rudderpost just then too with a yell of terror mr meeson in whom
the elementari principl of selfpreserv at all cost wa strongli
develop cast himself from the side and fell with a splash within a few
feet of the boat rise to the surfac he clutch hold of the gunwal
and implor to be taken in
knock the old varmint over the knuckl bill shout the other man
hell upset us
no no cri augusta her woman heart move at see her old enemi
in such a case there is plenti of room in the boat
hold on then said the man address whose name wa johnni when we
get clear well haul you in
and the reader mai be sure mr meeson did hold on pretti tight till
after row about fifti yard the two men halt and proceed not
without some risk and troublefor there wa a consider sea
runningto hoist mr meeson larg form over the gunwal of the boat
meanwhil the horror on board the doom ship were redoubl as she
slowli settl to her wateri grave forward the steam foghorn wa go
unceasingli bellow like a thousand furiou bull while now and
again a rocket still shot up through the misti morn air round the
boat a hideou war wa be wage augusta saw a great number of men
jump into on of the largest lifeboat which wa still hang to the
davit have evid got the better of those who were attempt to
fill it with the women and children the next second thei lower the
after tackl but by some hitch or misunderstand not the foremost
on with the result that the stern of the boat fell while the bow
remain fix and everi soul in it some forti or fifti peopl wa
shot out into the water anoth boat wa overturn by a sea as it
settl on the water anoth on full of women and children got to the
water all right but remain fasten to the ship by the bow tackl
when a coupl of minut afterward the kangaroo went down nobodi had
a knife at hand wherewith to cut the rope and the boat wa drag down
with her and all it occup drown the remain boat with the
except of the on in which ladi holmhurst wa and which had been got
awai befor the rush began were never lower at all or sank as soon as
lower it wa imposs to lower them ow to the mad behaviour of
the panicstricken crowd who fought like wild beast for a place in
them a few gentlemen and soberhead sailor could do noth against a
mob of frantic creatur each bent on save hi own life if it cost
the live of all els on board
and thu it wa exactli twenti minut from the time that the kangaroo
sank the whaler for although these event have taken some time to
describ thei did not take long to enact that her own hour came and
with the except of some eightandtwenti soul all told the hour
also of everi live creatur who had taken passag in her
chapter viii
kerguelen land
as soon as mr meeson save from drown by her intervent lai
gasp at the bottom of the boat augusta overcom by a momentari
faint let her head fall forward on to the bundl of blanket in
which she had wrap up the child she had rescu and who too
terrifi to speak or cry stare about him with wideopen and
frighten ey when she lift it a few second later a rai from the
rise sun had pierc the mist and strike full on the sink ship
as her stern well out of the water and her bow well under it she roll
sullenli to and fro in the trough of the heavi sea seem to wrap her
from hull to truck in wild and stormi light
she goingbi georg she go said the seaman johnni and as
he said it the mighti ship slowli rear herself up on end slowlyveri
slowli amidst the hideou and despair shriek of the doom wretch
on board of her she lift her stern higher and higher and plung her
bow deeper and deeper thei shriek thei cri to heaven for help but
heaven heed them not for man agoni cannot avert man doom now for
a space she wa stand almost upright upon the water out of which
about a hundr feet of her vast length tower like some monstrou ocean
growth whilst men fell from her in shower like fli benumb by
frost down into the churn foam beneath then suddenli with a swift
and aw rush with a rend sound of break spar a loud explos
of her boiler and a smother boom of burst bulkhead she plung
down into the measureless deep and wa seen no more forev
the water close in over where she had been boil and foam and
suck down all thing in the wake of her last journei while the steam
and prison air came up in huge hiss jet and bubbl that explod
into sprai on the surfac
the men groan the child stare stupifi and augusta cri out oh
oh like on in pain
row back she gasp row back and see if we cannot pick some
of them up
no no shout meeson thei will sink the boat
taint much us anywai said johnni i doubt that preciou few of
them will come up again thei have gone too deep
howev thei got the boat head round againslowli enough augusta
thoughtand as thei did so thei heard a feebl cry or two but by the
time that thei had reach the spot where the kangaroo went down there
wa no live creatur to be seen noth but the wash of the great
wave over which the mist onc more close thick and heavi as a pall
thei shout and onc thei heard a faint answer and row toward it
but when thei got to the spot whenc the sound seem to proce thei
could see noth except some wreckag thei were all dead their agoni
wa done their cri no more ascend to the pitiless heaven and wind
and sky and sea were just as thei had been
oh my god my god wept augusta cling to the thwart of the
toss boat
on boat got awaywher is it ask mr meeson who a wet and
wretch figur wa huddl up in the sternsheet as he roll hi
wild ey round strive to pierc the curtain of the mist
there someth said johnni point through a fogdog in the
mist that seem to grow denser rather than otherwis as the light
increas at a round boatlik object that had suddenli appear to the
starboard of them
thei row up to it it wa a boat but empti and float bottom
upward closer examin show that it wa the cutter which when
full of women and children had been fasten to the vessel and drag
down with her as she sank at a certain depth the pressur of the water
had been too great and had torn the ring in the bow bodili out of her so
that she return to the surfac but those in her did not returnat
least not yet onc more two or three dai henc thei would aris from
the wateri depth and look upon the ski with ey that could not see
and then vanish for ever
turn from thi aw and most move sight thei row slowli through
quantiti of float wreckagebarrel hencoop in on of these thei
found two drown fowl which thei secur and mani other articl
such as oar and wicker deckchairsand began to shout vigor in the
hope of attract the attent of the survivor in the other boat
which thei imagin could not be far off their effort howev prove
fruitless ow to the thick of the fog and in the consider sea
which wa run it wa imposs to see more than twenti yard or so
also what between the wind and the wash and turmoil of the water the
sound of their voic did not travel far the ocean is a larg place and
a rowingboat is easili lost sight of upon it furrow surfac
therefor it is not wonder that although the two boat were at the
moment within half a mile of each other thei never met and each took
it separ cours in the hope of escap the fate of the vessel the
boat in which were ladi holmhurst and some twenti other passeng
togeth with the second offic and a crew of six men after see the
kangaroo sink and pick up on survivor shape a cours for kerguelen
land believ that thei and thei alon remain to tell the tale of
that aw shipwreck and here it mai be conveni to state that befor
nightfal thei were pick up by a sealingwhal that sail with them
to albani on the coast of australia thenc an account of the disast
which as the reader will rememb creat a deep impress wa
telegraph home and thenc in due cours the widow ladi holmhurst
and most of the other women who escap were taken back to england
to return to our heroin and mr meeson
the occup of the littl boat sat look at each other with white
scare face till at last the man call johnni who bythewai wa
not a tar of a veri amiabl cast of counten possibl ow to the
fact that hi nose wa knock almost flat against the side of hi face
swore violent and said it wa no good stop there all the
etcetera dai thereupon bill who wa a more joviallook man
remark that he johnni wa etcetera well right so thei had
better hoist the foresail
at thi point augusta interpos and told them that the captain just as
the vessel came into collis had inform her that he wa make
kerguelen land which wa not more than sixti or seventi mile awai thei
had a compass in the boat and thei knew the cours the kangaroo wa
steer when she sank accordingli without wast further time thei
got as much sail up as the littl boat could carri in the stiff breez
and ran nearli due east befor the steadi westerli wind all dai long
thei ran across the misti ocean the littl boat behav splendidli
without sight ani live thing till at last the night close in
again there wa fortun a bag of biscuit in the boat and a
breaker of water also there wa unfortun a breaker of rum from
which the two sailor bill and johnni were alreadi take quit as
much as wa good for them consequ though thei were cold and wet
with the sprai thei had not to face the ad horror of starvat and
thirst at sundown thei shorten sail consider onli leav enough
canva up to keep the boat ahead of the sea
somehow the long night wore awai augusta scarc close her ey but
littl dick slept like a top upon her bosom shelter by her arm and
the blanket from the cold and penetr sprai in the bottom of the
boat lai mr meeson to whom augusta piti hi conditionfor he wa
shiver dreadfullyhad given the other blanket keep noth for
herself except the woollen shawl
at last howev there came a faint glow in the east and the daylight
began to break over the stormi sea augusta turn her head and stare
through the mist
what is that she said in a voic trembl with excit to the
sailor bill who wa take hi turn at the tiller and she point to a
dark mass that loom up almost over them
the man look and then look again and then hallow out joyfulli
landland ahead
up struggl mr meeson on to hi kneeshi leg were so stiff that he
could not standand began to stare wildli about him
thank god he cri where is it is it new zealand if ever i get
there ill stop there ill never get on a ship again
new zealand growl the sailor ar you a fool it kerguelen land
that what it iswher it rain all dai and nobodi livesnot even a
nigger it like enough that youll stop there though for i dont
reckon that anybodi will come to take you off in a hurri
mr meeson collaps with a groan and a few minut afterward the sun
rose while the mist grew less and less till at last it almost
disappear reveal a grand panorama to the occup of the boat for
befor them wa line upon line of jag and lofti peak stretch as
far as the ey could reach gradual melt in the distanc into the
cold white gleam of snow bill slightli alter the boat cours to the
southward and sail round a point she came into compar calm
water then due north of them run into the land thei saw the mouth
of a great fjord bound on each side by tower mountain bank so
steep as to be almost precipit around whose lofti side thousand of
sea fowl wheel awak the echo with their clamour right into thi
beauti fjord thei sail past a line of flat rock on which sat huge
fantast monster that the sailor said were sealion along the line
of beetl cliff till thei came to a spot where the shore on which
grew a rank soddenlook grass shelv gentli up from the water
edg to the frown and precipit background and here to their huge
delight thei discov two hut roughli built of old ship timber
place within a score of yard of each other and a distanc of some
fifti pace from the water edg
well there a hous anywai said the flatnos johnni though it
dont look as though it had paid rate and tax late
let us land and get out of thi horribl boat said mr meeson
feebli a proposit that augusta second heartili enough accordingli
the sail wa lower and get out the oar the two sailor row
the boat into a littl natur harbour that open out of the main
creek and in ten minut her occup were onc more stretch their
leg upon dry land that is if ani land in kerguelen island that region
of perpetu wet could be said to be dry
their first care wa to go up to the hut and examin them with a result
that could scarc be call encourag the hut had been built some
yearswheth by the expedit which in 1874 came thither to observ
the transit of venu or by former parti of shipwreck marin thei
never discoveredand were now in a state of ruin moss and lichen
grew plentifulli upon the beam and even on the floor while great hole
in the roof let in the wet which lai in littl slimi puddl beneath
still with all their drawback thei were decidedli better than the open
beach a veri short experi of which in that inclement climat would
certainli have kill them and thei thankfulli decid to make the best
of them accordingli the smaller of the two hut wa given up to augusta
and the boi dick while mr meeson and the sailor took possess of the
larg on their next task wa to move up their scanti belong the
boat have first been carefulli beach and to clean out the hut and
make them as habit as possibl by stretch the sail of the boat on
the damp floor and cover up the hole in the roof as best thei could
with stone and bit of board from the bottom of the boat the weather
wa fortun dry and as thei all with the except of mr meeson
who seem to be quit prostrat work with a will not except
master dickwho toddl backward and forward after augusta in high
glee at find himself on terra firmaand by middai everyth that
could be done wa done then thei made a fire of some driftwoodfor
fortun thei had a few matchesand augusta cook the two fowl
thei had got out of the float hencoop as well as circumst would
allowwhich as a matter of fact wa not veri welland thei had
dinner of which thei all stood sadli in need
after dinner thei reckon up their resourc of water there wa an
ampl suppli for not far from the hut a stream ran down into the fjord
for food thei had the best part of a bag of biscuit weigh about a
hundr pound also there wa the cask of rum which the men had move
into their own hut but that wa not all for there were plenti of
shellfish about if thei could find mean to cook them while the rock
around were cover with hundr of penguin includ specimen of the
great king penguin which onli requir to be knock on the head
there wa therefor littl fear of their perish of starvat as
sometim happen to ship wreck peopl inde immedi after
dinner the two sailor went out and return with as mani bird
eggsmostli penguina thei could carri in their hat scarc had
thei got in howev when the rain which is the prevail
characterist of these latitud set in in the most pitiless fashion
and soon the great mountain with which thei were surround and those
befor them were wrap in dens veil of fleeci vapour hour after
hour the rain fell without ceas penetr through their miser
roof and fallingdrop drip dropupon the sodden floor augusta sat
by herself in the smaller hut do what she could to amus littl dick
by tell him stori nobodi know how hard she found it to have to
invent stori when she wa thu overwhelm with misfortun but it wa
the onli wai of keep the poor child from cry as the sens of cold
and miseri forc itself into hi littl heart so she told him about
robinson cruso and then she told him that thei were plai at be
robinson cruso to which the child veri sensibl repli that he did not
at all like the game and want hi mamma
and meanwhil it grew darker and colder and damper hour by hour till at
last the light went out and left her with noth to keep her compani
but the moan wind the fall rain and the wild cri of the
seabird when someth disturb them from their rest the child wa
asleep at last wrap up in a blanket and on of the smaller sail
and augusta feel quit worn out with solitud and the pressur of
heavi thought began to think that the best thing she could do would be
to try to follow hi exampl when suddenli there came a knock at the
board which serv for a door to the shanti
who is it she cri with a start
memr meeson answer a voic can i come in
ye if you like said augusta sharpli though in her heart she wa
realli glad to see him or rather to hear him for it wa too dark to
see anyth it is wonder how under the pressur of a great
calam we forget our quarrel and our spite and ar readi to jump at
the prospect of the human companionship of our deadliest enemi and the
moral of that is as the white queen sai that as we ar all night and
dai face to face with the last dread calamitydeathw should
throughout our live behav as though we saw the present shadow of hi
hand but that will never happen in the world while human natur is human
natureand when will it becom anyth els
put up the door again said augusta when from a rather rawer rush of
air than usual she gather that her visitor wa within the hut

there wa not much chanc of it be seen by anybodi in that mistladen
atmospher even if anybodi came there to see it of which there wa
still less chanc still thei did it as a sort of duti by the time thi
task wa finish it wa middai and for a wonder there wa littl
wind and the sun shone out brightli on return to the hut augusta
got the blanket out to dry and set the two sailor to roast some of the

for thei were now quit sober and veri much asham of themselv
then after give dick some more biscuit and four roast egg which he
took to wonderfulli she went to mr meeson who wa ly groan in
the hut and persuad him to come and sit out in the warmth
by thi time the wretch man condit wa pitiabl for though hi
strength wa still whole in him he wa persuad that he wa go to
die and could touch noth but some rumandwat
miss smither he said as he sat shiver upon the rock i am go
to die in thi horribl place and i am not fit to die to think of me
he went on with a sudden burst of hi old fire to think of me dy
like a starv dog in the cold when i have two million of monei wait
to be spent there in england and i would give them ally everi
farth of themto find myself safe at home again by jove i would
chang place with ani poor devil of a writer in the hutch ye i
would turn author on twenti pound a monththat will give you some idea
of my condit miss smither to think that i should ever live to sai
that i would care to be a beggarli author who could not make a thousand
a year if he wrote till hi finger fell offoh oh and he fairli
sob at the horror and degrad of the thought
augusta look at the poor wretch and then bethought her of the proud
creatur she had known rage terribl through the obsequi rank of
clerk and carri desol to the hutch and the manyhead
editori depart she look and wa fill with reflect on the
mutabl of human affair
ala how chang that meeson

augusta with digniti but i think that you have done a veri wick
thing to disinherit your nephew in that fashion and i dont wonder that
you feel uncomfort about it
the express of thi vigor opinion serv to disturb mr meeson
conscienc all the more and he burst out into lament and regret
well said augusta at last if you dont like your will you had better
alter it there ar enough of us here to wit a will and if anyth
happen to you it will overrid the otherwil it not
thi wa a new idea and the dy man jump at it
of cours of cours he said i never thought of that befor i will
do it at onc and cut addison and rosco out altogeth eustac shall
have everi farth i never thought of that befor come give me your
hand ill get up and see about it
stop a minut said augusta how ar you go to write a will without
pen or pencil or paper or ink
mr meeson sank back with a groan thi difficulti had not occur to
him
ar you sure nobodi ha got a pencil and a bit of paper he ask it
would do so long as the write remain legibl
i dont think so said augusta but i will inquir accordingli she
went and ask bill and johnni but neither of them had a pencil or a
singl scrap of paper and she return sadli to commun the new
i have got it i have got it said mr meeson as she approach the
spot where he lai upon the rock if there is no paper or pen we must
write it in blood upon some linen we can make a pen from the feather of
a bird i read somewher in a book of somebodi who did that it will do
as well as anyth els
here wa an idea inde and on that augusta jump at but in
anoth moment her enthusiasm receiv a check where wa there ani
linen to write on
ye she said if you can find some linen you have got on a
flannel shirt so have the two sailor and littl dick is dress in
flannel too
it wa a fact as it happen not on of the parti had a scrap of linen
on them or anyth that would answer the purpos inde thei had onli
on pockethandkerchief between them and it wa a red rag full of hole
augusta had had on but it had blown overboard when thei were in the
boat what would thei not have given for that pockethandkerchief now
ye said mr meeson it seem we have none i havent even get a
banknot or i might have written in blood upon that though i have got
a hundr sovereign in goldi grab them up befor i bolt from the
cabin but i sayexcus me miss smither butumahoh hang
modestyhav you got some linen on somewher or other that you
could spare a bit of you shant lose by give it to me there i
promis that i will tear up the agreement if ever i get out of
thiswhich i shantwhich i shantand i will write on the linen that
it is to be torn up ye and that you ar to have five thousand pound
legaci too miss smither sure you can spare me a littl bitjust off
the skirt or somewher you know miss smither it never will be
miss and it is so veri import
augusta blush and no wonder i am sorri to sai i have noth of the
sort about me mr meesonnoth except flannel she said i got up
in the middl of the night befor the collis and there wa no light
in the cabin and i put on whatev came first mean to come back and
dress afterward when it got light
stai said mr meeson desper forgiv me for mention them
but sure you put on your stai on could write on them you know
i am veri sorri mr meeson she answer but i did not put ani on
not a cuff or a collar he said catch at a last straw of hope
augusta shook her head sadli
then there is an end of it groan mr meeson eustac must lose the
monei poor lad poor lad i have behav veri badli to him
augusta stood still rack her brain for some expedi for she wa
determin that eustac meeson should not lose the chanc of that
coloss fortun if she could help it it wa but a poor chanc at the
best for mr meeson might not be dy after all and if he did die it
wa probabl that hi fate would be their fate also and no record would
remain of them or of mr meeson testamentari wish as thing look
at present there wa everi prospect of their all perish miser on
that desol shore
just then the sailor bill who had been up to the flagstaff on the rock
on the chanc of catch sight of some pass vessel came walk
past hi flannel shirtsleev were roll up to the elbow of hi
brawni arm and as he stop to speak to augusta she notic someth
that made her start and gave her an idea
there aint noth to be seen said the man roughli and it is my
belief that there wont be neither here we ar and here we stop till
we di and rot
ah i hope not said augusta bythewai mr bill will you let me
look at the tattoo on your arm
certainli miss said bill with alacr hold hi great arm within
an inch of her nose it wa cover with variou tattoo flag ship
and what not in the middl of which written in small letter along the
side of the forearm wa the sailor namebil jone
who did it mr bill ask augusta
who did it why i did it myself a chap made me a bet that i could not
tattoo my own name on my own arm so i show him and a poor sort of
hand i should have been at tattoo if i could not
augusta said no more till bill had gone on then she spoke
now mr meeson do you see how you can make your will she said
quietli
see no he answer i dont
well i do you can tattoo itor rather get the sailor to tattoo it
it need not be veri long
tattoo it what on and what with he ask astonish
you can have it tattoo on the back of the other sailor johnni if he
will allow you and as for materi you have some revolv cartridg
if the gunpowd is mix with water it would do i should think
pon my word said mr meeson you ar a wonder woman whoever
would have thought of such a thing except a woman go and ask the man
johnni there a good girl if he would mind my will be tattoo
upon hi back
well said augusta it a queer sort of messag but ill try
accordingli take littl dick by the hand she went across to where the
two sailor were sit outsid their hut and put on her sweetest
smile first of all ask mr bill if he would mind do a littl
tattoo for her to thi mr bill find time hang heavi upon hi
hand and wish to be kept out of the temptat of the rumcask
gracious assent sai that he had seen some sharp fishbon ly
about which would be the veri thing though he shook hi head at the idea
of us gunpowd as the medium he said it would not do at all well
and then as though suddenli seiz by an inspir start off down
to the shore
then augusta as gentli and nice as she could approach the question
with johnni who wa sit with hi back against the hut hi batter
counten wear a peculiarli illfavor express probabl ow
to the fact that he wa suffer from sever pain in hi head as a
result of the debauch of the previou night
slowli and with great difficulti for hi understand wa none of the
clearest she explain to him what wa requir and that it wa
suggest that he should provid the necessari corpu vile upon which
it wa propos that the experi should be made when at last he
understood what it wa ask that he should do johnni counten
wa a sight to see and hi languag wa more strike than correct the
upshot of it wa howev that he would see mr meeson collect
and mr meeson variou member separ especi hi ey
somewher first
augusta retreat till hi wrath had spent itself and then onc more
return to the charg
she wa sure she said that mr johnni would not mind wit the
document if anybodi els could be found to submit to the pain of the
tattoo all that would be necessari would be for him to touch the hand
of the oper while hi johnni name wa tattoo as wit to the
will well he said i dont know how as i mind do that sinc it
you as ask me miss and not the dd old hulk of a meeson i would
not lift a finger to save him from ell miss and that a fact
then that is a promis mr johnni said augusta sweetli ignor
the garnish with which the promis wa adorn and on mr johnni
state that he look at it in that light she return to mr meeson
on her wai she met bill carri in hi hand a loathsomelook fish
with long feeler and a head like a parrot in short a cuttlefish
now here luck miss said bill exultingli i saw thi gentleman
ly down on the beach there thi morn he a cuttl that what he
is and ill have hi inkbag out of him in a brace of shake just the
ticket for tattoo miss as good as the best indianinkgunpowd is
a fool to it
by thi time thei had reach mr meeson and here the whole
matter includ johnni obstin refus to be tattoo wa
explain to bill
well said augusta at length it seem that the onli thing to be
done but the question is how to do it i can onli suggest mr meeson
that the will should be tattoo on you
oh said mr meeson feebli on me me tattoo like a
savagetattoo with my own will
it wouldnt be much us either governor beg your pardon said
bill that is if you ar ago to croak as you sai caus where
would the will be then we might skin you with a sharp stone perhap
after youv done the trick you know he ad reflect but then
we have no salt so i doubt if youd keep and if we set your hide in the
sun i reckon the write would shrivel up so that all the court of law
in london could not make head or tail of it
mr meeson groan loudli as well he might these frank remark would
have been try to ani man much more were thei so to thi opul
merchant princ who had alwai set the highest valu on what bill rude
call hi hide
there the infant went on bill medit he young and white
and i fanci hi topcrust would work wonder easi but youd have to
hold him for i expect that hed yell proper
ye said mr meeson let the will be tattoo upon the child hed be
some us that wai
ye said bill and there allu be someth left to remind me of a
veri queer time provid he live to get out of it which is doubt
cuttleink wont rub out ill warrant
i wont have dick touch said augusta indignantli it would
frighten the child into fit and besid nobodi ha a right to mark
him for life in that wai
well then there about an end of the question said bill and thi
gentleman monei must go wherev it is he dont want it to
no said augusta with a sudden flush there is not mr eustac
meeson wa onc veri kind to me and rather than he should lose the
chanc of get what he ought to have ii will be tattoo
well bust me said bill with enthusiasm bust me if you aint a
goodpluck on for a femal woman and if i wa that there young man i
should make bold to tell you so
ye said mr meeson that is an excel idea you ar young and
strong and as there is lot of food here i dare sai that you will take
a long time to die you might even live for some month let us begin at
onc i feel dreadfulli weak i dont think that i can live through the
night and if i know that i have done all i can to make sure that eustac
get hi own perhap dy will be a littl easier
chapter x
the last of mr meeson
augusta turn from the old man with a gestur of impati not unmix
with disgust hi selfish wa of an order that revolt her
i suppos she said sharpli to bill that i must have thi will
tattoo upon my shoulder
ye miss that it said bill you see miss on want space for a
doccymint if it were a ship or a flag now or a fanci pictur of your
young man i might manag it on your arm but there must be breadth for a
legal doccymint more especi as i should like to make a good job of
it while i is about it i dont want none of them laryer aturn up
their nose at bill jone tattoo
veri well said augusta with an inward sink of the heart i will
go and get readi
accordingli she adjourn into the hut and remov the bodi of her dress
and turn down the flannel garment underneath it in such a fashion as to
leav as much of her neck bare as is to be seen when a ladi ha on a
moder low dress then she came out again dress or rather
undress for the sacrific meanwhil bill had drawn out the inkbag
of the cuttl had prepar a littl round fragment of wood which he
sharpen like a pencil by rub it against a stone and had put a keen
edg on to a long white fishbon that he had select
now mr bill i am readi said augusta seat herself resolut
upon a flat stone and set her teeth
my word miss but you have a fine pair of shoulder said the sailor
contempl the white expans with the ey of an artist i never had
such a bit of materi to work on afor hang me if it aint almost a
piti to mark em not but what highclass tattoo is an ornimint to
anybodi from a princess down and in that you ar fortunit miss for i
larnt tattoo from them as can tattoo i did
augusta bit her lip and the tear came into her ey she wa onli a
woman and had a woman littl weak and though she had never
appear in a low dress in her life she knew that her neck wa on of
her greatest beauti and wa proud of it it wa hard to think that she
would be mark all her life with thi ridicul willthat is if she
escapedand what wa more for the benefit of a young man who had no
claim upon her at all
that wa what she said to herself but as she said it someth in her
told her that it wa not true someth told her that thi young mr
eustac meeson had a claim upon herth highest claim that a man could
have upon a woman for the truth must outsh love him it seem to
have come home to her quit clearli here in thi dread desol place
here in the veri shadow of an aw death that she did love him truli
and deepli and that be so she would not have been what she wasa
gentlenatur devot womanhad she not at heart rejoic at thi
opportun of selfsacrific even though that selfsacrific wa of the
hardest sort see that it involv what all women hateth endur
of a ridicul posit for love can do all thing it can even make
it votari brave ridicul
go on she said sharpli and let us get it over as soon as possibl
veri well miss what is it to be old gentleman cut it short you
know
i leav all my properti to eustac h meeson that as short as i
can get it and if properli wit i think that it will cover
everyth said mr meeson with a feebl air of triumph anyhow i
never heard of a will that is to carri about two million be got into
nine word befor
bill pois hi fishbon and next second augusta gave a start and a
littl shriek for the oper had begun
never mind miss said bill consolingli youll soon get us to it
after that augusta set her teeth and endur in silenc though it realli
hurt her veri much for bill wa more care of the artist effect and
the perman of the work than of the feel of the subject fiat
experimentum in corpor vili he would have said had he been convers
with the classic without much consider for the corpu vile so
he prick and dug awai with hi fishbon which he dip continu in
the cuttleink and with the sharp piec of wood till augusta began to
feel perfectli faint
for three hour the work continu and at the end of that time the bodi
of the will wa finishedfor bill wa a rapid workerb written in
mediums letter right across her shoulder but the signatur yet
remain to be affix
bill ask her if she would like to let them stand over till the
morrowbut thi although she felt ill with the pain she declin to
do she wa mark now mark with the ineffac mark of bill so she
might as well be mark to some purpos if she put off the sign of
the document till the morrow it might be too late mr meeson might be
dead johnni might have chang hi mind or a hundr thing so she
told them to go on and finish it as quickli as possibl for there wa
onli about two hour more daylight
fortun mr meeson wa more or less acquaint with the formal
that ar necessari in the execut of a will name that the testat
and the two wit should all sign in the presenc of each other he
also knew that it wa suffici if in case of ill some third
person held the pen between the testat finger and assist him to
write hi name or even if someon sign for the testat in hi
presenc and by hi direct and argu from thi knowledg he came
to the conclusionafterward justifi in the great case of meeson v
addison and anotherthat it would be suffici if he inflict the
first prick of hi signatur and then kept hi hand upon bill while
the rest wa done thi accordingli he did clumsili run the point
of the sharp bone so deep into the unfortun augusta that she fairli
shriek aloud and then keep hi hand upon the sailor arm while he
work in the rest of the signatur j meeson when it wa done
the turn of johnni came johnni had at length arous himself to some
interest in what wa go on and had stood by watch all the time
sinc mr meeson have laid hi finger upon augusta shoulder had
solemnli declar the write thereon to be hi last will and testament
as he johnni could not tattoo the same process wa gone through with
refer to hi signatur as in the case of mr meeson then bill jone
sign hi own name as the second wit to the will and just as the
light went out of the sky the document wa final executedth date of
the execut be alon omit augusta got up off the flat stone
where she had been seat dure thi tortur for someth like five
hour and stagger into the hut threw herself down upon the sail and
went off into a dead faint it wa inde onli by a veri strong exercis
of the will that she had kept herself from faint long befor
the next thing she wa consciou of wa a dread smart in her back
and on open her ey found that it wa quit dark in the hut so
weari wa she howev that after stretch out her hand to assur
herself that dick wa safe by her side she shut her ey again and went
fast asleep when she woke the daylight wa creep into the damp and
squalid hut reveal the heavi form of mr meeson toss to and fro
in a troubl slumber on the further side she got up feel
dreadfulli sore about the back and awak the child took him out to
the stream of water and wash him and herself as well as she could it
wa veri cold outsid so cold that the child cri and the rain cloud
were come up fast so she hurri back to the hut and togeth with
dick made her breakfast off some biscuit and some roast penguin
egg which were not at all bad eat she wa inde quit weak with
hunger have swallow no food for mani hour and felt
proportion better after it
then she turn to examin the condit of mr meeson the will had been
execut none too soon for it wa evid to her that he wa in a veri
bad wai inde hi face wa sunken and hectic with fever hi teeth were
chatter and hi talk though he wa now awak wa quit incoher
she tri to get him to take some food but he would swallow noth but
water have done all that she could for him she went out to see the
sailor and met them come down from the flagstaff thei had evid
been though not to ani great extent at the rum cask again for bill
look sheepish and shaki while the illfavor johnni wa more sulki
than ever she gaze at them reproachfulli and then ask them to
collect some more penguin egg which johnni refus pointblank to
do sai that he wasnt go to collect egg for landlubb to eat
she might collect egg for herself bill howev start on the errand
and in about an hour time return just as the rain set in in good
earnest bear six or seven dozen fresh egg ti up in hi coat
augusta with the child by her sat in the miser hut attend to mr
meeson while outsid the pitiless rain pour down in a steadi unceas
sheet of water that came through the wretch roof in stream she did
her best to keep the dy man dry but it prove to be almost an
imposs for even when she succeed in prevent the wet from
fall on him from abov it got underneath him from the reek floor
while the heavi damp of the air gather on hi garment till thei were
quit sodden
as the hour went on hi conscious came back to him and with it hi
terror for the end and hi remors for hi past life for ala the
million he had amass could not avail him now
i am go to die he groan i am go to die and iv been a bad
man iv been the head of a publish compani all my life
augusta gentli point out to him that publish wa a veri respect

compani and you ar talk of privat firm thei ar straight most of
them far too straight i us alwai to sai but you dont know

aunti aunti gasp dick why do the gentleman shout so
then take the frighten child by the hand augusta made her wai
through the rain to the other hut in order to tell the two sailor what
had come to pass it had no door and she paus on the threshold to
prospect the faint foggi light wa so dim that at first she could see
noth present howev her ey got accustom to it and she made
out bill and johnni sit opposit to each other on the ground
between them wa the breaker of rum bill had a larg shell in hi had

then augusta return to her hut with a heavi heart she cover up the
dead bodi as best she could tell littl dick that mr meeson wa gone
bybi and then sat down in that chill and aw compani it wa veri
depress but she comfort herself somewhat with the reflect that
on the whole mr meeson dead wa not so bad as mr meeson in the
anim flesh
present the night set in onc more and worn out with all that she had
gone through augusta said her prayer and went to sleep with littl dick
lock fast in her arm
some hour afterward she wa awaken by loud and uproari shout
made up of snatch of drunken song and that peculiar class of english
that hover ever round the lip of the british tar evid bill and
johnni were rage drunk and in thi condit were take the
midnight air

two men had drop it in the cours of their midnight walk or rather
roll where had thei gone to
straight in front of her a rocki promontori ran out fifti pace or more
into the water of the fjordlik bai she walk along it aimlessli till
present she perceiv on of the sailor hat ly on the ground or
rather float in a pool of water clearli thei had gone thi wai on
she went to the point of the littl headland sheer over the water there
wa noth to be seen not a singl vestig of bill and johnni
aimlessli enough she leant forward and stare over the rocki wall and
down into the clear water and then start back with a littl cry
no wonder that she start for there on the sand beneath a fathom and a
half of quiet water lai the bodi of the two illfat men thei were
lock in each other arm and lai as though thei were asleep upon that
ocean bed how thei came to their end she never knew perhap thei
quarrel in their drunken anger and fell over the littl cliff or
perhap thei stumbl and fell not know whither thei were go who
can sai at ani rate there thei were and there thei remain till the
outgo tide float them off to join the great armi of their companion
who had gone down with the kangaroo and so augusta wa left alon
with a heavi heart she return to the hut press down by the weight of
solitud and the sens that in the midst of so much death she could not
hope to escap there wa no human creatur left aliv in that vast
lone land except the child and herself and so far as she could see
their fate would soon be as the fate of the other when she got back to
the hut dick wa awak and wa cry for her
the still stiff form of mr meeson stretch out beneath the sail
frighten the littl lad he did not know why augusta took him into her
arm and kiss him passion she love the child for hi own sake
and besid he and he alon stood between her and utter solitud
then she took him across to the other hut which had been vacat by the
sailor for it wa imposs to stai in the on with the bodi which
wa too heavi for her to move in the centr of the sailor hut stood
the cask of rum which had been the caus of their destruct it wa
nearli empti nowso light inde that she had no difficulti in roll
it to on side she clean out the place as well as she could and
return to where mr meeson bodi lai fetch the bag of biscuit and
the roast egg after which thei had their breakfast
fortun there wa but littl rain that morn so augusta took dick
out to look for egg not becaus thei want ani more but in order to
emploi themselv togeth thei climb up on to a rocki headland where
the flag wa fly and look out across the troubl ocean there wa
noth in sight so far as the ey could seenoth but the white
wavehors across which the black cormor steer their swift
uner flight she look and look till her heart sank within her
will mummi soon come in a boat to take dick awai ask the child at
her side and then she burst into tear
when she had recov herself thei set to collect egg an occup
which notwithstand the scream and threaten attack of the bird
delight dick greatli soon thei had as mani as she could carri so thei
went back to the hut and lit a fire of driftwood and roast some egg
in the hot ash she had no pot to boil them in thu on wai and
anoth the dai wore awai and at last the dark began to fall over
the rug peak behind and the wild wilder of sea befor she put
dick to bed and he went off to sleep inde it wa wonder to see how
well the child bore the hardship through which thei were pass he
never had an ach or a pain or even a cold in the head
after dick wa asleep augusta sat or rather lai in the dark listen
to the moan of the wind as it beat upon the shanti and pass awai in
gust among the cliff and mountain beyond the loneli wa someth
aw and togeth with the thought of what the end of it would probabl
be quit broke her spirit down she knew that the chanc of her escap
were small inde ship did not often come to thi dread and
uninhabit coast and if on should happen to put in there it wa
exceedingli probabl that it would touch at some other point and never
see her or her flag and then in time the end would come the suppli of
egg would fail and she would be driven to support life upon such
bird as she could catch till at last the child sicken and di and
she follow it to that dim land that li beyond kerguelen and the
world she prai that the child might die first it wa aw to think
that perhap it might be the other wai about she might die first and
the child might be left to starv besid her the morrow would be
christma dai last christma dai she had spent with her dead sister at
birmingham she rememb that thei went to church in the morn and
after dinner she had finish correct the last revis of jemima
vow well it seem like that long befor anoth christma came she
would have gone to join littl jeanni and then be a good and
religi girl augusta rose to her knee and prai to heaven with all
her heart and soul to rescu them from their terribl posit or if
she wa doom to perish at least to save the child
and so the long cold night wore awai in thought and vigil till at last
some two hour befor the dawn she got to sleep when she open her
ey again it wa broad daylight and littl dick who had been awak
some time besid her wa sit up plai with the shell which bill
and johnni had us to drink rum out of she rose and put the child
thing a littl to right and then as it wa not rain told him to
run outsid while she went through the form of dress by take off
such garment as she had shake them and put them on again she
wa slowli go through thi process and wonder how long it would
be befor her shoulder ceas to smart from the effect of the
tattoo when dick came run in without go through the formal
of knock
oh aunti aunti he sang out in high glee here a big ship come
sail along is it mummi and daddi come to fetch dick
augusta sank back faint with the sudden revuls of feel if there
wa a ship thei were savedsnatch from the veri jaw of death but
perhap it wa the child fanci she threw on the bodi of her dress
and her long yellow hairwhich she had in default of better mean been
try to comb out with a bit of woodstream behind her she took the
child by the hand and flew as fast as she could go down the littl rocki
promontori off which bill and johnni had met their end befor she got
halfwai down it she saw that the child tale wa truefor there
sail right up the fjord from the open sea wa a larg vessel she wa
not two hundr yard from where she stood and her canva wa be
rapidli furl preparatori to the anchor be drop
thank provid for the sight as she never thank anyth befor
augusta sped on till she got to the extrem point of the promontori and
stood there wave dick littl cap toward the vessel which move
slowli and majest on till present across the clear water came
the splash of the anchor follow by the sound of the fierc rattl of
the chain through the hawsepip then there came anoth soundth
glad sound of human voic cheer she had been seen
five minut pass and then she saw a boat lower and man the oar
were got out and present it wa back water within ten pace of her
go round there she call point to the littl bai and i will
meet you
by the time that she had got to the spot the boat wa alreadi beach
and a tall thin kindlyfac man wa address her in an unmistak
yanke accent cast awai miss he said interrog
ye gasp augusta we ar the survivor of the kangaroo which sank
in a collis with a whaler about a week ago
ah said the captain with a whaler then i guess that where my
consort ha gone to she been miss about a week and i put in here
to see if i could get upon her tracksalso to fill up with water well
she wa well insur anywai and when last we spoke her she had made a
veri poor catch but perhap miss you will at your conveni favour
me with a few particular
accordingli augusta sketch the histori of their terribl adventur in
as few word as possibl and the tale wa on that made even the
phlegmat yanke captain stare then she took him follow by the crew
to the hut where meeson lai dead and to the other hut where she and
dick had slept upon the previou night
wall miss said the captain whose name wa thoma i guess that you
and the youngster will be almost readi to vacat these apart so if
you pleas i will send you off to the ship the harpoonthat her
nameof norfolk in the unit state you will find her well flavour
with oil for we ar about full to the hatch but perhap under the
circumst you will not mind that anywai my missu who is
aboardhav come the cruis for her healthand who is an englishwoman
like you will do all she can to make you comfort and i tell you
what it is miss if i wa in ani wai piou i should just thank the
almighti that i happen to see that there bit of a flag with my spyglass
as i wa sail along the coast at sunup thi morn for i had no
intent of put in at thi creek but at on twenti mile along and
now miss if youll go aboard some of us will stop and just tuck up the
dead gentleman as well as we can
augusta thank him from her heart and go into the hut got her hat
and the roll of sovereign which had been mr meeson but which he had
told her to take leav the blanket to be brought by the men
then two of the sailor got into the littl boat belong to the
kangaroo in which augusta had escap and row her and dick awai from
that hate shore to where the whalera foreandaftschoonerwa
ly at anchor as thei drew near she saw the rest of the crew of the
harpoon among whom wa a woman watch their advent from the deck
who when she got her foot upon the companion ladder on and all set up
a hearti cheer in anoth moment she wa on deckwhich
notwithstand it abomin smell of oil seem to her the fairest
and most delight place that her ey had ever rest onand be
almost hug by mr thoma a pleasantlook woman of about thirti
the daughter of a suffolk farmer who had emigr to the state and
then of cours she had to tell her stori all over again after which
she wa led off to the cabin occupi by the captain and hi wife and
which thenceforth wa occupi by augusta mr thoma and littl
dick the captain shake down where he could and here for the first
time for nearli a week she wa abl to wash and dress herself properli
and oh the luxuri of it nobodi know what the delight of clean linen
realli mean till he or she ha had to dispens with it under
circumst of privat nor have thei the slightest idea of what a
differ to on wellb and comfort is made by the possess or
nonpossess of an articl so common as a comb whilst augusta wa
still comb out her hair with sigh of delight mr thoma knock at
the door and wa admit
my miss what beauti hair you have now that it is comb out she
said in admir why whatev is that upon your shoulder
then augusta had to tell the tale of the tattoo which bythewai it
struck her it wa wise to do so see that she thu secur a wit
to the fact that she wa alreadi tattoo on leav kerguelen land
and that the oper had been of such recent inflict that the flesh
wa still inflam with it thi wa the more necessari as the tattoo
wa undat
mr thoma listen to the stori with her mouth open lost between
admir of augusta courag and regret that her shoulder should
have been ruin in that fashion
well the least that he allud to eustac can do is to marri you
after you have spoilt yourself in that fashion for hi benefit said the
practic mr thoma
nonsens mr thoma said augusta blush till the tattoo mark on
her shoulder look like blue line in a sea of crimson and stamp
her foot with such energi that her hostess jump
there wa no reason why she should give an innoc remark such a
warm recept but then as the reader will no doubt have observ
the reluct that some young women show to talk of the
possibl of their marriag to the man thei happen to have set
their heart on is onli equal by the alacr with which thei
marri him when the time come
have set dick and augusta down to a breakfast of porridg and coffe
which both of them thought delici though the fare wa realli rather
coars mr thoma be unabl to restrain her curios row off to
the land to see the hut and also mr meeson remain which though not
a pleasant sight were undoubtedli an interest on with her too
went most of the crew bent upon the same errand and also on obtain
water of which the harpoon wa short
as soon as she wa left alon augusta went back to the cabin take
dick with her and laid down on the berth with a feel of safeti and
thank to which she had long been a stranger where veri soon she
fell sound asleep

when augusta open her ey again she becam consciou of a violent
roll motion that she could not mistak thei were at sea
she got up smooth her hair and went on deck to find that she had
slept for mani hour for the sun wa set she went aft to where mr
thoma wa sit near the wheel with littl dick besid her and after
greet them turn to watch the sunset the sight wa a beauti on
enough for the great wave driven by the westerli wind which in these
latitud is nearli alwai blow half a gale were rush past them
wild and free and the sharp sprai of their foam crest struck upon
her forehead like a whip the sun wa set and the arrow of the
dy light flew fast and far across the billowi bosom of the deep fast
and far thei flew from the stormi glori in the west light up the pale
surfac of cloud and ting the grei water of that majest sea with
a lurid hue of blood thei kiss the belli sail and seem to rest
upon the vessel lofti truck and then travel on and awai and awai
through the great empyrean of space till thei broke and vanish upon the
horizon round edg there behind themmil behindkerguelen land
rear it fierc cliff against the twilight sky clear and desol
thei tower in an unutter solitud and on their snowi surfac the
sunbeam beat coldli as the warm breath of some human passion beat on
aphrodit marbl breast
augusta gaze upon those drear cliff that had so nearli prove her
monument pile and shudder it wa as a hideou dream
and then the dark and creep shadow of the night threw their veil
around and over them and thei vanish thei were swallow up in
black and she lost sight of them and of the great sea that forev
beat and churn about their stoni feet nor except in dream did she
again set her ey upon their measureless solitud
the night aros in strength and shook a golden dew of star from the
tress of her stream cloud till the wonder deep heaven sparkl
with a myriad gemmi point the west wind go on hi wai sung hi wild
chant amongst the cordag and rush among the sail as with a rush of
wing the ship leant over like a maiden shrink from a kiss then
shiver fled awai leap from billow to billow as thei rose and
toss their white arm about her fain to drag her down and hold her to
ocean heav breast
the rig tauten and the huge sail flap in thunder as the
harpoon sped upon her cours and all around wa great and the
present majesti of power augusta look aloft and sigh she knew not
why the swift blood of youth cours through her vein and she rejoic
exceedingli that life and all it possibl yet lai befor her but a
littl more of that dread place and thei would have lain behind her
dai would have been number befor she scarc had time to strike a blow
in the great human struggl that rage ceaselessli from ag to ag the
voic of her geniu would have been hush just as it note began to
thrill and her messag would never have been spoken in the world but
now time wa onc more befor her and oh the near of death had
taught her the unspeak valu of that on asset on which we can
relylif not inde that life for which so mani liveth life led
for self and have for it principl if not it onli end the
gratif of the desir of self but an altogeth higher lifea
life devot to tell that which her keen instinct knew wa truth and
howev imperfectli paint with the pigment of her nobl art those

shadow from the heaven of our hone
three month have passedthre long month of toss water and
everpres wind the harpoon shape her cours for norfolk in the
unit state had made but a poor passag of it she got into the
southeast trade and all went well till thei made st paul rock
where thei were detain by the doldrum and variabl wind afterward
she pass into the northeast trade and then further north met a
seri of westerli gale that ultim drove her to the azor just
as her crew were get veri short of water and provis and here
augusta bid farewel to her friend the yanke skipper for the whaler
that had save her life and dick after refit onc more set sail
upon it almost endless voyag she stood on the breakwat at ponta
delgada and watch the harpoon drop past the men recogn her and
cheer lustili and captain thoma took off hi hat for the entir

augusta and the extraordinari offer that thei had made her on
part most of them connect in some wai or other with that nobl
anim the whale suffic to fill a goodsiz packingcas augusta
wave her handkerchief to them in answer but she could not see much of
them becaus her ey were full of tear she had had quit enough of
the harpoon and yet she wa loth so sai farewel to her for her dai on
board had in mani respect been rest and happi on thei had given
her space and time to brace herself up befor she plung onc more into
the struggl of activ life besid she had throughout been treat
with that unvari kind and consider for which the american
peopl ar justli note in their deal with all person in misfortun
but augusta wa not the onli person who with sorrow watch the departur
of the harpoon first there wa littl dick who had acquir a fine
yanke drawl and grown quit half an inch on board of her and who
fairli howl when hi particular friend a remark fierc and
grislylook boatswain brought him as a part offer a larg
whale tooth patient carv by himself with a spirit pictur of
their rescu on kerguelen land then there wa mr thoma herself when
thei final reach the island of st michael in the azor augusta
had offer to pai fifti pound be half of the hundr sovereign
given to her by mr meeson to captain thoma as a passag fee know
that he wa by no moan overburden with the good of thi world but he
stoutli declin to touch a farth sai that it would be unlucki to
take monei from a castawai augusta as stoutli insist and final a
compromis wa come to mr thoma wa anxiou be seiz with that
acut speci of homesick from which suffolk peopl ar no more
exempt than other folk to visit the land where she wa born and the
peopl midst whom she wa bred up but thi she could not well afford to
do therefor augusta proffer fifti pound wa appropri to thi
purpos and mr thoma stop with augusta at ponta delgada wait
for the london and west india line packet to take them to southampton
so it came to pass that thei stood togeth on the ponta delgada
breakwat and togeth saw the harpoon sail off toward the set sun
then came a soft dreami fortnight in the fair island of st michael
where natur is ever as a bride and never reach the stage of the
hardwork toilworn mother lank and lean with the burden of
matern the mental act of look back to thi time in after year
alwai recal to augusta sens the odor of orangeblossom and the
sight of the rich pomegranatebloom blush the rose down it wa a
pleasant time for the english consul there most hospit entertain
themwith much more person enthusiasm inde than he gener
consid it necessari to show toward shipwreck voyagersa class of
peopl of whom consular repres abroad must get rather tire
with their etern misfortun and their perenni want of cloth
inde the onli drawback to her enjoy wa that the consul a
gallant offici with red hair equal charm by her adventur her
literari fame and her person show a decid disposit to fall in
love with her and a redhair and therefor ardent consular offic
is under those circumst a somewhat alarm personag but the
time went on without anyth seriou happen and at last on
morn after breakfast a man came run up with the inform that
the mail wa in sight
and so augusta took an affection farewel of the goldenhair consul
who gaze at her through hi eyeglass and sigh when he thought of what
might have been in the sweet byandbi and the ship bell rang and the
screw began to turn leav the consul still sigh on the horizon and
in due cours augusta and mr thoma found themselv stand on the
quai at southampton the centr of an admir and enthusiast crowd
the captain had told the extraordinari tale to the port offici when
thei board the vessel and on get ashor the port offici had
made hast to tell everi live soul thei met the wonder new that two

thoma and dick were safe on shore their stori or rather sundri
distort version of it wa flash up the wire to the variou press
agenc and run through southampton like wildfir scarc were
their feet set upon the quai when with a rush and a bound wild men
with notebook in their hand sprang upon them and beat them down with
a rain of question augusta found it imposs to answer them all at
onc so content herself with sai ye ye ye to
everyth out of which monosyl she afterward found to her
surpris these fierc and activ pressmen contriv to make up a
suffici move tale which includ glow account of the horror
of the shipwreck and what rather took her aback a posit statement
that she and the sailor had live for a fortnight upon the broil
remain of mr meeson on interview be a small man and
therefor unabl to kick and fight hi wai through the ring which
surround augusta and mr thoma seiz upon littl dick and
commenc to chirp and snap hi finger at him in the interv of ask

dick dreadfulli alarm fled with a howl but thi did not prevent a

them bouquet an old ladi whose brain wa permeat with the idea that
shipwreck peopl went about in a condit of undress for much longer
than wa necessari after the event arriv with an arm of
undercloth stream on the breez and last but not least a tall
gentleman with a beauti moustach thrust into augusta hand a note
hastili written in pencil which when open prove to be an offer of
marriag
howev at last thei found themselv in a firstclass carriag readi
to start or rather start the interview gentlemen two of whom
had their head jam through the window were forcibl drawn

the moustach who wa hover in the background smile a soft
farewel in which modesti struggl visibl with hope the
stationmast took off hi cap and in anoth minut thei were roll

augusta sank back with a sigh of relief and then burst out laugh at
the thought of the gentleman with the fair moustachio on the seat
opposit to her somebodi had thoughtfulli place a number of the dai
paper she took up the first that came to hand and glanc at it idli
with the idea of try to pick up the thread of event her ey fell

mr gladston and hi do whatev evil might be said of him he wa
not an old man of the sea turn the paper over impati she came
upon the report of the probat divorc and admiralti divis of the

mr fiddlestick qc who with mr pearl appear for the applic

the presid wellth amount of the properti ha got noth to do
with the principl on which the court act with regard to the

quit so my lord and i think that in thi case your lordship will be

humanli speak imposs that mr meeson can have escap the gener

no my lord i have an affidavit from a sailor name oker the onli man
who wa pick up in the water after the kangaroo founder which state
that he believ that he saw mr meeson spring from the ship into the

swear that it wa mr meeson
the presid well i think that that will do the court is necessarili
advers to allow the presumpt of death except on evid of the
most satisfactori natur still consid that nearli four month have

eustac bui a paper
in due cours the train that bore augusta and her fortun time to
reach waterloo at 540 pm roll into the station the train wa a
fast on but the telegraph had been faster all the even paper had
come out with account more or less accur of their escap and most
of them had ad that the two survivor would reach waterloo by the 540
train the consequ wa that when the train drew up at the platform
augusta on look out wa horrifi to see a dens mass of human
be be kept in check by a line of policemen
howev the guard wa hold the door open so there wa noth for it
but to get out which she did take dick by the hand a proceed that
necessarili put her ident beyond a doubt the moment she got her foot
on to the platform the crowd saw her and there aros such a tremend
shout of welcom that she veri nearli took refug again in the carriag
for a moment she stood hesit and the crowd see how sweet and
beauti she wa for the three month of sea air had made her stouter
and even more love cheer again with that peculiar enthusiasm which
a discern public alwai show for a pretti face but even while she
stood bewild on the platform she heard a loud make waymak wai
there and saw the multitud be divid by a littl knot of
offici who were escort somebodi dress in widow weed
in anoth second there wa a cry of joi and a sweet pale face littl
ladi had run at the child dick and wa hug him against her heart
and sob and laugh both at onc
oh my boi my boi cri ladi holmhurst for it wa she i thought
you were deadlong ago dead
and then she turn and befor all the peopl there clung about
augusta neck and kiss her and bless her becaus she had save her
onli child and half remov the deadweight of her desol whereat
the crowd cheer and wept and yell and swore with excit and
bless their star that thei were there to see
and then in a haze of nois and excit thei were led through the
cheer mob to where a carriag and pair were stand and were help
into it mr thoma be place on the front seat and ladi holmhurst
and augusta on the back the former with the gasp dick upon her knee
and now littl dick is out of the stori
then anoth event occur which we must go back a littl to explain
when eustac meeson had come to town after be formal disinherit
he had manag to get a billet as latin french and old english reader
in a publish hous of reput as it happen on thi veri afternoon
he wa stroll down the strand have finish a rather stiff dai
work and with a mind fill with those idl and somewhat confus odd
and end of specul with which most brain worker will be acquaint
he look older and paler than when we last met him for sorrow and
misfortun had laid their heavi hand upon him when augusta had
depart he had discov that he wa head over heel in love with her
in that unfortun wayfor ninetynin time out of a hundr it is
unfortunatein which mani men of suscept do occasion fall in
love in their youtha wai that brand the heart for life in a fashion
that can no more be effac than the stamp of a hot iron can be effac
from the physic bodi such an affectionwhich is not altogeth of the
earthwil when it overcom a man prove either the greatest bless
of hi life or on of the heaviest most endur curs that a malign
fate can heap upon hi head for if he achiev hi desir even though
he serv hi seven year sure for him life will be rob of half it
evil but if he lose her either through misfortun or becaus he gave
all thi to on who did not understand the gift or on who look at
love and on herself as a currenc wherewith to bui her place and the
luxuri of dai then he will be of all men among the most miser for
noth can give him back that which ha gone from him
eustac had never seen augusta but twice in hi life but then passion
doe not necessarili depend upon constant previou intercours with it
object love at first sight is common enough and in thi instanc
eustac wa not altogeth depend upon the spoken word of hi
ador or on hi recollect of her veri palpabl beauti for he had
her book to those who know someth of the writersuffici let us
sai to enabl him to put an approxim valu on hi or her sentiment
so as to form a more or less accur guess as to when he is speak
from hi own mind when he is speak from the mind of the puppet in
hand and when he is mere put a casea person book ar full of
inform and bring that person into a closer and more intim
contact with the reader than ani amount of person intercours for
whatev is best and whatev is worst in an individu will be reflect
in hi page see that unless he is the poorest of hack author he
must of necess set down therein the imag that pass across the
mirror of hi heart
thu it seem to eustac who knew jemima vow and also her

alreadi been to hammersmith and back he found himself gravit
toward hanoversquar onc there he had littl difficulti in find
the number there wa a light in the drawingroom floor and the night
be warm on of the window wa open so that the lamplight shone
softli through the lace curtain eustac cross over to the other side
of the street and lean against the iron rail of the squar
look up he wa reward for hi pain for through the filmi curtain
he could make out the form of two ladi seat side by side upon an
ottoman with their face toward the window and in on of these he had
no difficulti in recognis augusta her head wa lean on her hand
and she wa talk earnestli to her companion he wonder what she wa
talk of and had half a mind to go and ring and ask to see her why
should he wait till tomorrow morn present howev better
counsel prevail and though sore against hi will he stop where
he wa till a policeman think hi rapt gaze suspici gruffli
request him to move on
to gaze at on onli love through an open window is no doubt a
delight occup if a somewhat tantalis on but if eustac
ear had been as good as hi ey and he could have heard the
convers that wa proceed in the drawingroom he would have been
still more interest
augusta had just been unfold that part of her stori which dealt with
the import document tattoo upon her shoulder to which ladi
holmhurst had listen or rotundo
and so the young man is come here tomorrow morn said ladi
holmhurst how delight i am sure he look a veri nice young man

cours mr meeson will want to see thi will whatev it mai be worth
and i should like to ask you bessi how i am to show it to him it is

i have not observ said ladi holmhurst drili that ladi as a
rule have an insuper object to show their neck if you have
ani doubt on the point i recommend you to get an invit to a london
ball all you will have to do will be to wear a low dress the fact of
be tattoo doe not make it ani more improp for you to show your
shoulder than it would be if thei were not tattoo
i have never worn a low dress said augusta and i do not want to show
my shoulder
ah well said ladi holmhurst darkli i daresai that that feel
will soon wear off but of cours if you wont you wont and under
those circumst you had better sai noth about the willthough

augusta took her hand and thei began to talk of that great bereav
and of their own wonder surviv till at last she led the
convers round to littl dick and bessi holmhurst smile again at
the thought that her darl boi her onli child wa safe asleep up
stair and not as she had believ wash to and fro at the bottom of
the ocean she took augusta hand and kiss it and bless her for
have save her child till suddenli somewhat to the relief of the
latter the butler open the door and said that two gentlemen want
veri particularli to speak to miss smither and then she wa onc more

repres of the compani and then more special report and then
an artist from on of the illustr paper who insist upon her

tabl to look at them there on her neck wa the will the cuttl ink
had prove an excel medium and the tattoo wa as fresh as the dai
on which it had been done and would no doubt remain so till the last
hour of her life

i should have to be veri much in love and she look meaningli at
augusta befor i would spoil myself in that fashion for ani man
augusta blush at the insinu and said noth at ten oclock
just as thei were half through breakfast there came a ring at the bell
here he is said ladi holmhurst clap her hand well if thi
isnt the veri funniest thing that i ever heard of i told jone to show

solemn as a mute in hi deep mourn open the door and announc mr

of tea augusta give mr meeson a cup of tea
he took the tea which he did not want in the least and then there came
an awkward silenc nobodi seem to know how to begin the convers
how did you find the hous mr meeson said ladi holmhurst at last
miss smither gave you no address and there ar two ladi
holmhurstsmi motherinlaw and myself

a policeman thought i wa a suspici charact and told me to move on
dear me mr meeson you must have been have a good look at us
here augusta interpos fear least her admirerfor with an uner
instinct she now guess how matter stoodshould sai someth
foolish a young man who is capabl of stand to stare at a hous in
hanoversquar is she thought evid capabl of anyth
i wa surpris to see you yesterdai she said how did you know we

eustac told her that he had seen it in the globe i am sure you
cannot have been so surpris as i wa he went on i had made sure
that you were drown i went up to birmingham to call on you after you
had gone and found that you had vanish and left no address the
maidserv declar that you had sail in a ship call the conger
eelwhich i afterward found out wa kangaroo and then she went down
and after a long time thei publish a full list of the passeng and
your name wa not among them and i thought that after all you might have
got off the ship or someth then some dai afterward came a
telegram from albani in australia give the name of ladi holmhurst
and the other who were save and special mention miss
smithersth novelist and lord holmhurst as be among the drown
and that is how the dread suspens came to an end it wa aw i can
tell you
both of the young women look at eustac face and saw that there wa
no mistak the real natur of the trial through which he had pass so
real wa it that it never seem to occur to him that there wa anyth
unusu in hi express such intens interest in the affair of a young
ladi with whom he wa outwardli at ani rate on the term of merest
acquaint
it wa veri kind of you to think so much about me said augusta
gentli i had no idea that you would call again or i would have left
word where i wa go
well thank god you ar safe and sound at ani rate answer eustac
and then with a sudden burst of anxieti you ar not go back to new
zealand just yet ar you
i dont know i am rather sick of the sea just now
no inde she is not said ladi holmhurst she is go to stop with
me and dick miss smither save dick life you know when the nurs
poor thing had run awai and now dear you had better tell mr meeson
about the will
the will what will ask eustac
listen and you will hear
and eustac did listen with open ey and ear while augusta get
over her shyness as best she might told the whole stori of hi
uncl death and of the wai in which he had commun hi
testamentari wish
and do you mean to tell me said eustac astound that you allow
him to have hi confound will tattoo upon your neck
ye answer augusta i did and what is more mr meeson i think
that you ought to be veri much oblig to me for i daresai that i shall
often be sorri for it
i am veri much oblig answer eustac i had no right to expect
such a thing and in short i do not know what to sai i should never
have thought that ani woman wa capabl of such a sacrific forfor a
compar stranger
then came anoth awkward paus
well mr meeson said augusta at last rise brusqu from her
chair the document belong to you and so i suppos that you had better
see it not that i think that it will be of much us to you howev as
i see that probat had been allow to issu whatev that mai mean
of mr meeson other will
i do not know that that will matter said eustac as i heard a friend
of mine mr short who is a barrist talk about some case the other
dai in which probat wa revok on the product of a subsequ will
inde answer augusta i am veri glad to hear that then perhap
after all i have been tattoo to some purpos well i suppos you had
better see it and with a gestur that wa half shy and half defiant she
drew the lace shawl from her shoulder and turn her back toward him
so that he might see what wa inscrib across it
eustac stare at the broad line of letter which with the signatur
written underneath might mean a matter of two million of monei to him
thank you he said at last and take up the lace shawl he threw it
over her again
if you will excus me for a few minut mr meeson interrupt ladi
holmhurst at thi point i have to go to see about the dinner and
befor augusta could interfer she had left the room
eustac close the door behind her and turn feel instinct
that a great crisi in hi fortun had come there ar some men who rise
to an emerg and some who shrink from it and the differ is that
differ between him who succe and him who fail in life and in all
that make life worth live
eustac belong to the class that rise and not to that which shrink
chapter xv
eustac consult a lawyer
augusta wa lean against the marbl mantelpieceinde on of her
arm wa rest upon it for she wa a tall woman perhap she too
felt that there wa someth in the air at ani rate she turn awai
her head and began to plai with a bronz japanes lobster which adorn
the mantelpiec
now for it said eustac to himself draw a long breath to try and
steadi the violent pulsat of hi heart
i dont know what to sai to you miss smither he began
best sai noth more about it she put in quickli i did it and i am
glad that i did it what do a few mark matter if a great wrong is
prevent therebi i am not ever like to have to go to court besid
mr meeson there is anoth thing it wa through me that you lost your
inherit it is onli right that i should try to be the mean of
bring it back to you
she drop her head again and onc more began to plai with the bronz
lobster hold her arm in such a fashion that eustac could not see her
face but if he could not see her face she could see hi in the glass
and narrowli observ it everi chang which on the whole though
natur wa rather mean of her
poor eustac grew pale and paler yet till hi handsom counten
becam posit ghastli it is wonder how frighten young men ar
the first time that thei propos it wear off afterwardswith practic
on get accustom to anyth
miss smithersaugusta he gasp i want to sai someth to you

what you ar go to do about the will suggest augusta
nono noth about the willpleas dont laugh at me and put me
off
she look up innocentlya much as to sai that she never dream of
do either of these thing she had a love face and the glanc of
the grei ey quit broke down the barrier of hi fear
oh augusta augusta he said dont you understand i love you i
love you no woman wa ever love befor as i love you i fell in love
with you the veri first time i saw you in the offic at meeson when
i had the row with my uncl about you and ever sinc then i have got
deeper and deeper in love with you when i thought that you were
drown it nearli broke my heart and often and often i wish that i
were dead too
it wa augusta turn to be disturb now for though a ladi composur
will stand her in good stead up to the veri verg of an affair of thi
sort it gener break down in media re anyhow she certainli
drop her ey and color to her hair while her breast began to heav
tumultu
do you know mr meeson she said at last without dare to look at
hi implor face that thi is onli the fourth time that we have seen
each other includ yesterdai
ye i know he said but dont refus me on that account you can
see me as often as you likethi wa gener of master eustaceand
realli i know you better than you think i should think that i have read
each of your book twenti time
thi wa a happi stroke for howev free from vaniti a person mai be
it is not in the natur of a young woman to hear that somebodi ha read
her book twenti time without be pleas
i am not my book said augusta
no but your book ar part of you he answer and i have learnt
more about your real self through them than i should have done if i had
seen you a hundr time instead of four
augusta slowli rais her grei ey till thei met hi own and look at
him as though she were search out hi soul and the memori of that
long sweet look is with him yet
he said no more nor had she ani word but somehow nearer and nearer
thei drew on to the other till hi arm were around her and hi lip
were press upon her lip happi man and happi girl thei will live to
find that life ha joi for those who ar good and ar well off but
that it ha no joi so holi and so complet as that which thei were now
experiencingth first kiss of true and honest love
a littl while afterward the butler came in in a horribl sudden manner
and found augusta and eustac the on veri red and the other veri pale
stand suspici close to each other but he wa a veri welltrain
butler and a man of experi who had seen much and guess more and
he look innoc as a babe unborn
just then too ladi holmhurst came in again and look at the pair of
them with an amus twinkl in her ey ladi holmhurst like her butler
wa also a person of experi
wont you come into the draw room she said and thei did look
rather sheepish
and there eustac made a clean breast of it announc that thei were
engag to be marri and although thi wa somewhat of an assumpt
see that no actual word of troth had pass between them augusta
stood there never offer a word in contradict
well mr meeson said ladi holmhurst i think that you ar the
luckiest man of my acquaint for augusta is not onli on of the
sweetest and loveliest girl that i have ever met she is also the
bravest and the cleverest you will have to look out mr meeson or you
will be known as the husband of the great augusta meeson
i will take the risk he answer humbl i know that augusta ha more
brain in her littl finger than i have in my whole bodi i dont know
how she can look at a fellow like me
dear me how humbl we ar said ladi holmhurst well that is the wai
of men befor marriag and now as augusta carri both your fortun on
her back as well as in her face and brain i ventur to suggest that you
had better go and see a lawyer about the matter that is if you have
quit finish your littl talk i suppos that you will come and dine
with us mr meeson and if you like to come a littl earli sai
halfpast six i daresai that augusta will arrang to be in to hear what
you have found out about thi will you know and nowan revoir
i think that that is a veri nice young man my dear said ladi
holmhurst as soon as eustac had bow himself out it wa rather
audaci of him to propos to you the fourth time that he set ey upon
you but i think that audac is on the whole a good qualiti in the
male sex anoth thing is that if that will is worth anyth he will
be on of the wealthiest men in the whole of england so take it
altogeth i think i mai congratul you my dear and now i suppos
that you have been in love with thi young man all along i guess as
much when i saw your face as he ran up to the carriag yesterdai and i
wa sure of it when i heard about the tattoo no girl would allow
herself to be tattoo in the interest of abstract justic oh ye i
know all about it and now i am go out walk in the park with dick
and i should advis you to compos yourself for that artist is come to
draw you at twelv
and she depart and left augusta to her reflect which werewel
not unpleas on
meanwhil eustac wa march toward the templ as it happen in the
same lodginghous where he had been live for the last few month two
brother of the name of short had room and with these young gentlemen
he had becom veri friendli the two short were twin and so like on
anoth that it wa more than a month befor eustac could be sure which
of them he wa speak to when thei were both at colleg their father
di leav hi properti equal between them and as thi properti on
realis wa not found to amount to more than four hundr a year the
twin veri rightli conclud that thei had better do someth to
supplement their moder incom accordingli by a stroke of geniu thei
determin that on of them should becom a solicitor and the other a
barrist and then toss up as to which should take to which trade the
idea of cours wa that in thi manner thei would be abl to afford
each other mutual comfort and support john would give jame brief and
jame reflect glori would shine back on john in short thei were
anxiou to establish a legal dong firm of the most approv pattern
accordingli thei pass their respect examin and john took
room with anoth bud solicitor in the citi while jame hire
chamber in pumpcourt but there the matter stop for as john did not
get ani work of cours he could not give ani to jame and so it came to
pass that for the past three year neither of the twin had found the law
as profit as thei anticip in vain did john sit and sigh in the
citi client were few and far between scarc enough to pai hi rent
and in vain did jame artist robe wander like the evil on from
court to court seek what he might devour occasion he had the
pleasur of take a note for anoth barrist who wa call awai
which mean do anoth man work for noth onc too a man with
whom he had a nod acquaint rush up to him and thrust a
brief into hi hand ask him to hold it for him tell him that it
would be on in a short time and that there wa noth in itnoth
at all scarc had poor jame struggl through the brief when the
case wa call on and it mai suffic to sai that at it conclus the
judg gaze at him mildli over hi spectacl and could not help
wonder that ani learn counsel had been found who would consent to
wast the time of the court in such a case as the on to which he had
been listen clearli jame friend would not so consent and had
pass on the respons minu the fee on anoth occas jame
wa in the probat court on motion dai and a solicitora real live
solicitorcam up to him and ask him to make a motion mark
mr 2 gn for leav to dispens with a corespond thi motion
he made and the corespond wa dispens with in the approv
fashion but when he turn round the solicitor had vanish and he
never saw him more or the two guinea either howev the brief hi
onli on remain and after that he took to hover about the
divorc court partli in the hope of onc more see that solicitor and
partli with a vagu idea of drift into practic in the divis
now eustac had often when in the short sittingroom in the
lodginghous in the strand heard the barrist jame hold forth
learnedli on the matter of will and therefor he natur enough
turn toward him in hi recent dilemma know the address of hi
chamber in pumpcourt he hurri thither and wa in due cours
admit by a veri small child who appar fill the respons
offic of clerk to mr jame short and sever other learn gentlemen
whose name appear upon the door
the infant regard eustac when he open the door with a look of such
preternatur sharp that it almost frighten him the begin of
that eagl glanc wa full of inquir hope and the end of resign
despair the child had thought that eustac might be a client come to
tread the path which no client ever had trod henc the hope and the
despair in hi ey eustac had noth of the solicitor clerk about
him clearli he wa not a client
mr short wa in that door to the right eustac knock and enter
into a bare littl chamber about the size of a larg housemaid closet
furnish with a tabl three chair on a basket easi and a
bookcas with a coupl of dozen of law book and some old volum of
report and a broad windowsil in the exact centr of which lai the
solitari and vener brief
mr jame short wa a short stout young man with black ey a hook
nose and a prematur bald head inde thi bald of the head wa
the onli distinguish mark between jame and john and therefor a
thing to be thank for though of cours useless to the perplex
acquaint who met them in the street when their hat were on at the
moment of eustac entri mr short had been engag in studi that
intens legal print the sport time which howev from some
unexplain bash he had hastili thrown under the tabl fill
it space with a law book snatch at hazard from the shelf
all right old fellow said eustac whose quick ey had caught the
quick flutter of the vanish paper dont be alarm it onli me
ah said mr jame short when he had shaken hand with him you see i
thought that it might have been a clienta client is alwai possibl
howev improb and on ha to be readi to meet the possibl
quit so old fellow said eustac but do you know as it happen i
am a clientand a big on too it is a matter of two million of
moneymi uncl fortun there wa anoth will and i want to take
your advic
mr short fairli bound out of the chair in exult and then struck
by anoth thought sank back into it again
my dear meeson he said i am sorri i cannot hear you
eh said eustac what do you mean
i mean that you ar not accompani by a solicitor and it is not the
etiquett of the profess to which i belong to see a client
unaccompani by a solicitor
oh hang the etiquett of the profess
my dear meeson if you came to me as a friend i should be happi to give
you ani legal inform in my power and i flatter myself that i know
someth of matter connect with probat but you yourself said that
you have come as a client and in that case the person relationship
sink into the background and is supersed by the offici relationship
under these circumst it is evid that the etiquett of the
profess interven which overmast forc compel me to point out
to you how improp and contrari to preced it would be for me to
listen to you without the presenc of a properli qualifi solicitor
oh lord gasp eustac i had no idea that you were so particular i
thought perhap that you would be glad of the job
certainlycertainli in the present state of my practic as he
glanc at the solitari brief i should be the last to wish to turn awai
work let me suggest that you should go and consult my brother john in
the poultri i believ busi is rather slack with him just now so i
think it probabl that you will find him disengag inde i dare sai
that i mai go so far as to make an appoint for him herelet us sai
in an hour time stop i will consult my clerk dick
the infant appear
i believ that i have no appoint for thi morn
no sir said dick with a twinkl in hi ey on moment sir i
will consult the book and he vanish to return present with
the inform that mr short time wa not under ani contribut
that dai
veri good said mr short then make an entri of an appoint with
mr john short and mr meeson at two precis
ye sir said dick depart to the unaccustom task
as soon as eustac had depart from tweedledum to tweedlede or in
other word from jame barrist to john solicitor dick wa again
summon and bade go to a certain mr thomson on the next floor mr
thomson had an excel librari which had come to him by will on the
strength of thi bequest he had becom a barristeratlaw and the

meanwhil eustac had made hi wai in a twopenni bu to on of those
busi court in the citi where mr john short practis as a solicitor
mr short offic wa eustac discov by refer to a notic
board on the seventh floor of on of the tallest hous he had ever
seen howev up he went with a stout heart and after some five
minut of a struggl that remind him forcibl of climb the
ladder of a cornish mine he arriv at a littl door right at the veri
top of the hous on which wa paint mr john short solicitor
eustac knock and the door wa open by a small boi so like the
small boi he had seen at mr jame short at the templ that he fairli
start afterward the mysteri wa explain like their master the
two small boi were brother
mr john short wa within and eustac wa usher into hi presenc
to all appear he wa consult a volumin mass of correspond
written on larg sheet of brief paper but when he look at it
close it seem to eustac that the edg of the paper were veri

chapter xvi
short on legal etiquett
well meeson what is it have you come to ask me to lunch ask
mr john short do you know i actual thought that you might have
been a client
well by jove old fellow and so i am answer eustac i have been
to your brother and he ha sent me on to you becaus he sai that it is
not the etiquett of the profess to see a client unless a solicitor is
present so he ha refer me to you
perfectli right perfectli right of my brother jame meeson
consid how small ar hi opportun of becom cogniz with
the practic of hi profess it is extraordinari how well he is
acquaint with it theori and now what is the point
well do you know short as the point is rather a long on and as your
brother said that he should expect us at two precis i think that we
had better take the bu back to the templ when i can tell the yarn to
both of you at onc
veri well i do not as a gener rule like leav my offic at thi
time of dai as it is apt to put client to inconveni especi
such of them as come from a distanc but i will make an except for
you meeson william he went on to the counterpart of the pumpcourt
infant if anyon call to see me will you be so good as to tell them
that i am engag in an import confer at the chamber of mr
short in pumpcourt but that i hope to be back by halfpast three
ye sir said william as he shut the door behind them certainli
sir and then have place the musti document upon the shelf whenc
thei could be fetch down without difficulti on the slightest sign of a
client that ingeni youth with singular confid that nobodi would
be inconvenienc therebi put a notic on the door to the effect that he
would be back immedi and adjourn to indulg in the passion
exhilar game of chuck farth with variou other small clerk of
hi acquaint
in due cours eustac and hi legal advis arriv at pumpcourt and
oh how the heart of jame the barrist swell with pride when for
the first time in hi career he saw a real solicitor enter hi chamber
accompani by a real client he would inde have prefer it if the
solicitor had not happen to be hi twinbroth and the client had
been some other than hi intim friend but still it wa a bless
sighta verybless sight
will you be seat gentlemen he said with much digniti
thei obei
and now meeson i suppos that you have explain to my brother the
matter on which you requir my advic
no i havent said eustac i thought i might as well explain it to
you both togeth eh
hum said jame it is not quit regular accord to the etiquett
of the profess to which i have the honour to belong it is not
customari that matter should be so dealt with it is usual that paper
should be present but that i will overlook as the point appear to be
press
that right said eustac well i have come to see about a will
so i understand said jame but what will and where is it
well it a will in my favour and is tattoo upon a ladi neck
the twin simultan rose from their chair and look at eustac
with such a ridicul ident of movement and express that he fairli
burst out laugh
i presum meeson that thi is not a hoax said jame sever i
presum that you know too well what is due to learn counsel to attempt
to make on of their bodi the victim of a practic joke
sure meeson ad john you have suffici respect for the
digniti of the law not to tamper with it in ani such wai as my brother
ha indic
oh certainli not i assur you it is all squar it is a true bill or
rather a true will
proce said jame resum hi seat thi is evid a case of an
unusu natur
you ar right there old boi said eustac and now just listen
and he proceed to unfold hi move tale with much point and emphasi
when he had finish john look at jame rather helplessli the case wa
beyond him but jame wa equal to the occas he had master that
first great axiom which everi young barrist should lai to heartnev
appear to be ignor
thi case he said as though he were give judgment is doubtless
of a remark natur and i cannot at the moment lai my hand upon ani
author bear on the pointif inde ani such ar to be found but
i speak offhand and must not be held too close to the obit dictum
of a viva voce opinion it seem to me that notwithstand it
peculiar idiosyncrasi and the variou cruce that it present it
will upon closer examin be found to fall within those gener law
that govern the legal cours of testamentari disposit if i rememb
arighti speak offhandth act of 1 vic cap 26 specifi that a
will shall be in write and tattoo mai fairli be defin as a rude
varieti of write it is i admit usual that write should be done on
paper or parchment but i have no doubt that the young ladi skin if
carefulli remov and dri would make excel parchment at present
therefor it is parchment in it green stage and perfectli avail
for write purpos
to continu it appearsi am take mr meeson statement as be
perfectli accuratethat the will wa properli and duli execut by the
testat or rather by the person who tattoo in hi presenc and at hi
command a form of signatur which is veri well cover by the section
of the act of 1 vic cap 26 it seem too that the wit
attest in the presenc of each other and of the testat it is true
that there wa no attest claus but the suppos necess for an
attest claus is on of those fallaci of the lai mind which
perhap cluster more frequent and with a greater persist round
question connect with testamentari disposit than those of ani other
branch of the law therefor we must take the will to have been properli
execut in accord with the spirit of the statut
and now we come to what at present strike me as the crux the will is
undat doe that invalid it i answer with confid no and mark
evidencethat of ladi holmhurstcan be produc that thi will did not
exist upon miss augusta smither previou to dec 19 on which dai the
kangaroo sank and evid can also be producedthat of mr
thomasthat it did exist on christma dai when miss smither wa
rescu it is therefor clear that it must have got upon her back
between dec 19 and dec 25
quit so old fellow said eustac much impress at thi corusc
of legal lore evid you ar the man to tackl the case but i sai
what is to be done next you see im afraid it too late probat ha
issu whatev that mai mean
probat ha issu echo the great jame struggl with hi rise
contempt and is the law so helpless that probat which ha been allow
to issu under an erron apprehens of the fact cannot be recal
most certainli not so soon as the preliminari formal ar conclud
a writ must be issu to revok the probat and claim that the court
should pronounc in favour of the later will or stai there is no
executorther is no executora veri import pointclaim a grant
of letter of administr with the will annex i think that will be
the better cours
but how can you annex miss smither to a grant of letter of
administr whatev that mai mean said eustac feebli
that remind me said jame disregard the question and address
hi brother you must at onc file miss smither in the registri and
see to the prepar of the usual affidavit of script
certainli certainli said john as though thi were the most simpl
busi in the world
what gasp eustac as a vision of augusta impal upon an enorm
billguard rose befor hi ey you cant file a ladi it
imposs
imposs or not it must be done befor ani further step ar taken
let me see i believ that dr probat is the sit registrar at
somerset hous thi sit it would be well if you made an appoint
for tomorrow
ye said john
well went on jame i think that is all for the present you will of
cours let me have the instruct and other paper with all possibl
speed i suppos that other counsel besid myself will be ultim
retain
oh that remind me said eustac about monei you know i dont
quit see how i am go to pai for all thi game i have got about fifti
pound spare cash in the world and that all and i know enough to be
awar that fifti pound do not go far in a lawsuit
blankli jame look at john and john at jame thi wa veri try
fifti pound will go a good wai in outofpocket fee suggest jame
at length rub hi bald head with hi handkerchief
possibl answer john pettishli but how about the remuner of
the plaintiff legal advis cant youaddress eustacemanag
to get the monei from someon
well said eustac there ladi holmhurst perhap if i offer to
share the spoil with her if there wa ani
dear me no said john that would be mainten
certainli not chime in jame hold up hi hand in dismai most
clearli it would be champerti and did it come to the knowledg of the
court nobodi can sai what might not happen
inde answer eustac with a sigh i dont quit know what you
mean but i seem to have said someth veri wrong the odd on a
handicap ar child plai to understand besid thi law he ad sadli
it is obviou jame said john that put asid other matter
thi would prove independ of pecuniari reward a most interest
case for you to conduct
that is so john repli jame but as you must be well awar the
etiquett of my profess will not allow me to conduct a case for
noth upon that point abov all other etiquett rule us with a
rod of iron the stomach of the bar collect and individu is
revolt and scandalis at the idea of on of it member do
anyth for noth
ye put in eustac i have alwai understood thei were
regular nailer
quit so my dear jame quit so said john with a sweet smile a
fee must be mark upon the brief of learn counsel and that fee be
paid to him togeth with mani other smaller fee for learn counsel
is like the cigarettebox and newfashion weighingmachin at the
station he doe not work unless you drop someth down him but there
is noth to prevent learn counsel from return that fee and all
the littl fee inde jame you will see that thi practic is common
amongst the most emin of your profess when for instanc thei
requir an advertis or wish to pai a delic compliment to a
constitu what do thei do then thei wait till thei find 500 mark
upon a brief and then resign their fee why should you not do the same
in thi case in your own interest of cours if we win the caus the
other side or the estat will pai the cost and if we lose you will at
least have had the advantag the priceless advantag of a uniqu
advertis
veri well john let it be so said jame with magnanim your
check for fee will be duli return but it must be understood that thei
ar to be present
not at the bank said john hastili i have recent had to oblig a
client he ad by wai of explan to eustac and my balanc is
rather low
no said jame i quit understand i wa go to sai ar to be
present to my clerk
and with thi solemn farc the confer came to an end

old hypocrit
well went on the innoc and emin respect object of hi
suspicion of cours the absenc of a date doe not invalid a
willit is matter for proof that is all but there i am not in a
posit to give ani opinion about the case it is quit beyond me and
besid that is not my busi but now miss smither as you have
onc put yourself in the custodi of the registri in the capac of a
will might i ask if you have ani suggest to make as to how you ar to
be dealt with obvious you cannot be lock up with the other will
and equal obvious it is against the rule to allow a will to go out
of the custodi of the court unless by special permiss of the court
also it is clear that i cannot put ani restraint upon the liberti of the
subject and order you to remain with me inde i doubt if it would be
possibl to do so by ani mean short of an act of parliament under these
circumst i am i confess a littl confus as to what cours should
be taken with refer to thi import alleg will
what i have to suggest sir said mr short is that a certifi copi
of the will should be file and that there should be a special paragraph
insert in the affidavit of script detail the circumst
ah said the learn doctor polish hi eyeglass you have given
me an idea with miss smither consent we will file someth better
than a certifi copi of the willw will file a photograph copi the
inconveni to miss smither will be trifl and it mai prevent
question be rais hereaft
have you ani object to that my dear ask ladi holmhurst
oh no i suppos not said augusta mournfulli i seem to be public
properti now
veri well then excus me for a moment said the learn doctor
there is a photograph close by whom i have had occas to emploi
offici i will write and see if he can come round
in a few minut an answer came back from the photograph that he would
be happi to wait upon doctor probat at three oclock up to which hour
he wa engag
well said the doctor it is clear that i cannot let miss smither out
of the custodi of the court till the photograph is taken let me see i
think that your wa my last appoint thi morn now what do you
sai to the idea of someth to eat we ar not five minut drive from
simpson and i shall feel delight if you will make a pleasur of a
necess
ladi holmhurst who wa get veri hungri said that she should be most
pleas and accordingli thei allwith the except of mr john
short who depart about some busi sai that he would return at
three oclockdrov off in ladi holmhurst carriag to the restaur
where thi delight specimen of the genu registrar stood them a most
sumptuou champagn lunch and made himself so agreeabl that both the
ladi nearli fell in love with him and even eustac wa constrain to
admit to himself that good thing can come out of the divorc court
final the doctor wound up the proceed which were of a most live
order and includ an account of augusta adventur with a toast
i hear from ladi holmhurst he said that you two young peopl ar
go to take the preliminari stepumtoward a possibl futur
appear in that court with which i had for mani year the honor of
be connectedthat is that you ar go to get marri now
matrimoni is accord to my somewhat extend experi an
undertak of a venturesom order though case occasion come under
on observ where the result have prove to be in everi wai
satisfactori and i must sai that if i mai form an opinion from the
fact as thei ar befor me i never knew an engag enter into
under more promis or more romant auspic here the young gentleman
quarrel with hi uncl in take the part of the young ladi and therebi
is disinherit of vast wealth then the young ladi under the most
terribl circumst take step of a natur that not on woman in
five hundr would have done to restor to him that wealth whether or no
those step will ultim prove success i do not know and if i
did like herodotu i should prefer not to sai but whether the wealth
come or goe it is imposs but that a sens of mutual confid and
a mutual respect and admirationthat is if a more quiet thing
certainli also a more endur thing than mere lovemust and will
result from them mr meeson you ar inde a fortun man in miss
smither you ar go to marri beauti courag and geniu and if you
will allow an older man of some experi to drop the offici and give
you a word of advic it is thi alwai try to deserv your good
fortun and rememb that a man who in hi youth find such a woman
and is enabl by circumst to marri her is inde
smile on by joi and cherish of the god
and now i will end my sermon and wish you both health and happi and
ful of dai and he drank off hi glass of champagn and look so
pleasant and kindli that augusta long to kiss him on the spot and as
for eustac he shook hand with him warmli and then and there a
friendship began between the two which endur till now
and then thei all went back to the offic and there wa the photograph
wait with all hi apparatu and astonish enough he wa when he
found out what the job wa that he had to do howev the task prove an
easi on enough as the light of the room wa suitabl and the dark
line of cuttl ink upon augusta neck would the man said come out
perfectli in the photograph so he took two or three shot at her back
and then depart sai that he would bring a lifes reproduct
to be file in the registri in a coupl of dai
and after that the learn registrar also shook hand with them and said
that he need detain them no longer as he now felt justifi in allow
augusta out of hi custodi
and so thei depart glad to have got over the first step so pleasantli

memor for the unanim and lumin judgment final deliv by
the lord justic of appeal wherebi the sale of the photograph wa
stop and the photograph wa held to have been guilti of a technic
contempt thi judgment contain perhap the most search and learn
definit of construct contempt that ha yet been formul but for
the text of thi i must refer the student to the law report becaus
as it took two hour to deliv i fear that it would notwithstand
it mani beauti be thought too long for the purpos of thi histori
unfortun howev it did not greatli benefit augusta the victim
of the unlaw dissemin of photograph of her shoulder inasmuch
as the judgment wa not deliv till a week after the great case of
meeson v addison and anoth had been settl
about a week after augusta adventur in regentstreet a motion wa
made in the court of probat on behalf of the defend messr addison
and rosco who were the executor and princip beneficiari under the
former will of novemb 1885 demand that the court should order the
plaintiff to file a further and better affidavit of script with the
origin will got up by him attach the object of cours be to
compel an inspect of the document thi motion which first brought
the whole case under the notic of the public wa strenuous resist
by mr jame short and result in the matter be refer to the
learn registrar for hi report on the next motion dai thi report wa
present and on it appear from it that the photographi had taken
place in hi presenc and accur repres the tattoo mark on the
ladi shoulder the court declin to harass the will by order her
to submit to ani further inspect befor the trial it wa on thi
occas that it transpir that the will wa engag to be marri to
the plaintiff a fact at which the court metaphor open it ey
after thi the defend obtain leav to amend their answer to the
plaintiff statement of claim at first thei had onli plead that the
testat had not duli execut the alleg will in accord with the
provis of 1 vic cap 26 sec 2 and that he did not know and
approv the content thereof but now thei ad a plea to the effect
that the said alleg will wa obtain by the undu influenc of augusta
smither or as on of the learn counsel for the defend put it
much more clearli at the trial that the will had herself procur the
will by an undu project of her own will upon the unwil mind of
the testat
and so the time went on as often as he could eustac got awai from
london and went down to the littl riversid hotel and wa as happi as
a man can be who ha a tremend law suit hang over him the law no
doubt is an admir institut out of which a larg number of peopl
make a live and a proport of benefit accru to the commun at
larg but woe unto those who form the subjectmatt of it oper
for instanc the court of chanceri is an excel institut in
theori and look after the affair of minor upon the purest principl
but how mani of it ward after and as a result of on of it
wellintent interfer have to struggl for the rest of their
live under a load of debt rais to pai the crush cost to emploi
the court of chanceri to look after ward is someth as though on set
a tame eleph to pick up pin no doubt he could pick them up but it
would cost someth to feed him it is a perfectli arguabl proposit
that the court of chanceri produc as much wretched and poverti as
it prevent and it certainli is a bold step except under the most
exception circumst to place anybodi in it custodi who ha
monei that can be dissip in law expens but of cours these ar
revolutionari remark which on cannot expect everybodi to agre with
least of all the conveyanc counsel of the court
howev thi mai be certainli hi impend lawsuit prove a fly in
eustac honei never a dai pass but some fresh worri aros jame
and john the legal twin fought like hero and held their own
although their experi wa so smalla men of talent almost
invari do when thei ar put to it but it wa difficult for eustac
to keep them suppli even with suffici monei for outofpocket
expens and of cours as wa natur in a case in which such enorm
sum were at stake and in which the defend were alreadi men of vast
wealth thei found the flower of the entir talent and weight of the bar
arrai against them natur eustac felt and so did mr jame
shortwho notwithstand hi pompos and the technic of hi
talk wa both a clever and sensibl manthat more counsel men of
weight and experi ought to be brief but there were absolut no
fund for thi purpos nor wa anybodi like to advanc ani upon the
secur of a will tattoo upon a young ladi back thi wa awkward
becaus success in law proceed so veri often lean toward the
weightiest purs and judg howev imparti be but men after all
ar more apt to listen to an argument which is urg upon their attent
by an attorneygener than on on advanc by an unknown junior
howev there the fact wa and thei had to make the best of it and a
point in their favour wa that the case although of a most remark
natur wa compar simpl and did not involv ani great mass of
documentari evid
chapter xix
meeson v addison and anoth
the most wearisom time go by at last if onli on live to see the end
of them and so it came to pass that at length on on fine morn about
a quarter to ten of the law court clock that project it ghastli
hideous upon unoffend fleetstreet augusta accompani by
eustac ladi holmhurst and mr thoma the wife of captain thoma who
had come up from visit her rel in the eastern counti in order

meet us by the statu in the hall accordingli thei pass into the
archwai by the oak stand where the causelist ar displai augusta
glanc at them as she went and the first thing that her ey fell on
wa probat and divorc divis court i at 1030 meeson v addison

pass a policeman of gigant size monstrum horrendum inform
ingen who watch and ward the foldingdoor through which so much
human learn wretched and worri pass dai by dai and were
stand in the long but narrow and illproport hall which appear
to have been the best thing that the architectur talent of the
nineteenth centuri wa capabl of produc
to the right of the door on enter is a statu of the architect of a
pile of which england ha certainli no caus to feel proud and here a
black bag full of paper in hi hand stood mr john short wear that
air of excit upon hi counten which is so commonli to be seen in
the law court
here you ar he said i wa begin to be afraid that you would be
late we ar first on the list you know the judg fix it special
to suit the conveni of the attorneygener he on the other side
you know he ad with a sigh im sure i dont know how poor jame
will get on there ar more than twenti counsel against him for all the
legate under the former will ar repres at ani rate he is well
up in hi fact and there doe not seem to me to be veri much law in
the case
meanwhil thei had been proceed up the long hall till thei came to a
poki littl staircas which had just been dug out in the wall the
necess for a staircas at that end of the hall wherebi the court
floor could be reach have to all appear origin escap the
attent of the architect on get to the top of the staircas thei
turn to the left and then to the left again if thei had had ani doubt
as to which road thei should take it would have been speedili decid by
the long string of wig which were stream awai in the direct of
divorc court no 1 thicker and thicker grew the wig it wa obviou
that the caus clbre of meeson v addison and anoth would not want
for hearer inde augusta and her friend soon realis the intens
of the public interest in a wai that wa as impress as it wa
disagre for just past the admiralti court the passag wa entir
block by an enorm mass of barrist there might have been five
hundr or more of them there thei were choke up togeth in their
whitewig rank wait for the door of the court to be open at
present it wa guard by six or eight attend who with the help of
a wooden barrier attempt to keep the surg multitud at baywhil
those behind cri forward and those in front cri back
how on earth ar we go to get through ask augusta and at
that moment mr john short caught hold of an attend who wa
struggl about in the skirt of the crowd like a fly in a cup of
tea and ask him the same question explain that their presenc
wa necessari to the show
im bother if i know sir you cant come thi wai i suppos i must
let you through by the underground passag from the other court why he
went on as he led the wai to the admiralti court hang me if i dont
believ that we shall all be crush to death by them there barrist
it would take a regiment of cavalri to keep them back and thei ar a
ungri lot thei ar and thei aint no work to do and that why thei
come kick and tear and worrit just to see a bit of paint on
a young ladi shoulder
by thi time thei had pass through the admiralti court which wa not
sit and been conduct down a sort of well that termin in the
space occupi by the judg clerk and other offic of the court in
anoth minut thei found themselv emerg in a similar space in the
other court

physiognomi wa engag in studi the legal type befor her which
she found resolv themselv into two classesth sharp keenfac

wore an eyeglass continu fix in hi right ey he wa mr new of
the great firm new and new who were conduct the case on behalf of
the defend
mr short i believ said mr new contempl hi oppon
youth form with piti not unmix with compass
ye

attornei and solicitorgener and mr fiddlestick and we ar quit
will to admit that there ar circumst of doubt in thi case
which would justifi us in make an offer of settlement
befor i can enter into that mr new said john with great digniti
i must request the presenc of my counsel
oh certainli said mr new and accordingli jame wa summon from
hi elev perch where he wa onc more go through hi note and
the head of hi open speech although he alreadi knew hi
briefwhich to do it justic had been prepar with extraordinari care
and elaborationalmost by heart and next moment for the first time in
hi life found himself in consult with an attornei and a
solicitorgener
look here short said the first of these great men address jame as
though he had known him intim for year though as a matter of
fact he had onli that moment ascertain hi name from mr fiddlestick
who wa himself oblig to refer to bean befor he could be sure of
itlook here short dont you think that we can settl thi busi
youv got a strongish case but there ar some ugli thing against you
as no doubt you know
i dont quit admit that said jame
of courseof cours said mr attornei but still in my judgment if
you will not be offend at my express it you ar not quit on firm
ground suppos for instanc your young ladi is not allow to give
evid
i think said a stout gentleman behind who wore upon hi counten
the veri sweetest and most infantil smile that eustac had ever seen
break in rather hastili as though he wa afraid that hi learn
leader wa show too much of hi hand i think that the case is on
that look at from either point of view will bear settlement better
than fightingeh fiddlestick but then im a man of peac and again
he smile most seduct at jame
what ar your term ask jame
the emin counsel on the front bench turn round and stuck their wig
togeth like a lot of whitehead crow over a bone and the slightli
less emin but still highli distinguish junior on the second bench
crane forward to listen
thei ar go to settl it eustac heard the barrist who wa
report for the time sai to hi long assist
thei alwai do settl everi case of public interest grunt the long
man in answer we shant see miss smither shoulder now well i shall
get an introduct to her and ask her to show them to me i take a
great interest in tattoo
meanwhil fiddlestick qc had been write someth on a strip of
paper and hand to hi leader the attorneygener who mr jame
short saw with respect admir had 500 guinea mark upon hi
brief he nod carelessli and pass it on to hi junior who gave it
in turn to the solicitorgener and playford qc when it had gone the
round mr new took it and show it to hi two privileg client
messr addison and rosco addison wa a cholericlook fatfac
man rosco wa sallow and had a thin straggli black beard when thei
look at it addison groan fierc as a wound bull and rosco
sigh and that sigh and groan told augustawho womanlik had all her
wit about her and wa watch everi act of the dramamor than it
wa meant to do it told her that these gentlemen were do someth
that thei did not like and do it becaus thei evid believ that
thei had no other cours open to them then mr new gave the paper to
mr john short who glanc at it and hand it on to hi brother and
eustac read it over hi shoulder it wa veri short and ran
thusterm offer half the properti and defend pai all cost
well short said eustac what do you sai shall we take it
jame remov hi wig and thoughtfulli rub hi bald head it is a
veri difficult posit to be put in he said of cours a million is a
larg sum of monei but there ar two at stake my own view is that we
had better fight the case out though of cours thi is a certainti
and the result of the case is not
i am inclin to settl said eustac not becaus of the case for i
believ in it but becaus of augustaof miss smither you see she will
have to show the tattoo again and that sort of thing is veri
unpleas for a ladi
oh as to that said jame loftili at present she must rememb that
she is not a ladi but a legal document howev let us ask her
now augusta what shall we do said eustac when he had explain the
offer you see if we take the offer you will be spare a veri
disagre time you must make up your mind quick for the judg will
be here in a minut
oh never mind me said augusta quickli i am us to disagre
no i shall fight i tell you thei ar afraid of you i can see it in
the face of that horrid mr addison just now he posit glare at me
and ground hi teeth and he would not do that if he thought that he wa
go to win no dear i shall fight it out now
veri well said eustac and he took a pencil and wrote declin with
thank at the foot of the offer
just at that moment there came a dull roar from the passag beyond the
door of the court were be open anoth second and in rush and
struggl a hideou sea of barrist heaven how thei fought and
kick a madden herd of buffalo could not have behav more
desper on rush the white wave of wig bear the strong men who
hold the door befor them like wreckag on a breaker on thei came and in
forti second the court wa crowd to it utmost capac and still
there were hundr of white wig men behind it wa a fear scene
good graciou thought augusta to herself how on earth do thei all
get a live a question that mani of them would have found it hard
enough to answer
then suddenli an old gentleman near her whom she discov to be the
usher jump up and call silenc in command accent without
produc much effect howev on the palpit mass of human in
front then in came the offic of the court and a moment afterward
everybodi rose as the judg enter and look as augusta thought
veri cross when he saw the crowd condit of the court bow to the
bar and took hi seat
chapter xx
jame break down
the registrar not augusta dear doctor probat but anoth registrar
rose and call on the case of meeson v addison and anoth and in an
instant the wretch jame short wa on hi leg to open the case
what is that gentleman name augusta heard the judg ask of the
clerk after make two or three frantic effort to attract hi
attentiona proceed that the posit of hi desk render veri
difficult
short my lord
do you appear alon for the plaintiff mr short ask the judg
with emphasi
ye my lord i do answer jame and as he said it everi pair of
ey in that crowd assembl fix themselv upon him and a sort of
audibl smile seem to run round the court the thing not unnatur
struck the profession mind as ludicr and without preced
and who appear for the defend
i understand my lord said the learn attorneygener that all my
learn friend on these two bench appear togeth with myself for
on or other of the defend or ar watch the case in the interest
of legate
here a decid titter interrupt him
i mai add that the interest involv in thi case ar veri larg
inde which account for the number of counsel connect in on wai or
other with the defenc
quit so mr attornei said the judg but realli the forc seem a
littl out of proport of cours the matter is not on in which the
court can interfer
if your lordship will allow me said jame the onli reason that
the plaintiff is so poorli repres is that the fund to brief
other council were i understand not forthcom i am howev well
vers in the case and with your lordship permiss will do my
best with it
veri well mr short said the learn judg look at him almost
with piti state your case
jamesin the midst of a silenc that could be feltunfold hi
plead and as he did so for the first time a sicken sens of
nervous took hold of him and made him trembl and of a sudden hi
mind becam dark most of us have undergon thi sensat at on time or
anoth with less caus then had poor jame there he wa put up almost
for the first time in hi life to conduct singlehand a most
import case upon which it wa scarc too much to sai the interest
of the entir countri wa concentr nor wa thi all oppos to him
were about twenti counsel all of them men of experi and includ
in their rank some of the most famou leader in england and what wa
more the court wa dens crowd with score of men of hi own
profess everi on of whom wa he felt regard him with curios
not unmix with piti then there wa the tremend respons
which liter seem to crush him though he had never quit realis
it befor
mai it pleas your lordship he began and then as i have said hi
mind becam a ghastli blank in which dim and formless idea flit
vagu to and fro
there wa a pausea pain paus
read your plead aloud whisper a barrist who wa sit next
him and realis hi plight
thi wa an idea on can read plead when on cannot collect on
idea to speak it is not usual to do so the counsel in a caus state
the substanc of the plead leav the court to refer to them if it
think necessari but still there wa noth absolut wrong about it
so he snatch at the paper and promptli began
i the plaintiff is the sole and univers legate under the true last
will of jonathan meeson deceas late of pompadour hall in the counti
of warwick who di on the 23rd of decemb 1885 the said will be
undat but duli execut on or subsequ to the 22nd dai of
decemb 1885
here the learn judg lift hi eyebrow in remonstr and clear
hi throat preparatori to interf but appar thought better of
it for he took up a blue pencil and made a note of the date of the will
ii went on jame on the 21st dai of mai 1886 probat of an
alleg will of the said jonathan meeson wa grant to the defend
the said will bear date the 10th dai of novemb 1885 the
plaintiff claim
1 that the court shall revok probat of the said alleg will of the
said jonathan meeson bear date the 10th dai of novemb 1885
grant to the defend on the 21st dai of mai 1886
2 a grant of letter of administr to the plaintiff with the
will execut on or subsequ to the 22nd dai of december1885 annex
sign jame short
mai it pleas your lordship jame began again feel dimli that he
had read enough plead the defend have file an answer plead
that the will of the 22nd of decemb wa not duli execut in accord
with the statut and that the testat did not know and approv it
content and an amend answer plead that the said alleg will if
execut wa obtain by the undu influenc of augusta smithersand
onc more hi nervous overcam him and he pull up with a jerk
then came anoth paus even more dread than the first
the judg took anoth note as slowli as he could and onc more clear
hi throat but poor jame could not go on he could onli wish that he
might then and there expir rather than face the hideou humili of
such a failur but he would have fail for hi veri brain wa whirl
like that of a drunken man had it not been for an occurr that caus
him for ever after to bless the name of fiddlestick qc as the name of
an emin counsel is not often bless in thi ungrat world for
fiddlestick qc who it will be rememb wa on of the leader for
the defend had been watch hi unfortun antagonist till
realis how sorri wa hi plight a sens of piti fill hi learn
breast perhap he mai have rememb some occas in the dim and
distant corner of the past when he had suffer from a similar access of
frantic terror or perhap he mai have been sorri to think that a young
man should lose such an unrival opportun of make a name anyhow
he did a nobl act as it happen he wa sit at the righthand
corner of the queen counsel seat and pile upon the desk befor him
wa a tremend mass of law report which hi clerk had arrang there
contain case to which it might becom necessari to refer now in the
presenc of these law report mr fiddlestick in the good of hi
heart saw an opportun of creat a divers and he creat it with
a vengeanc for throw hi weight suddenli forward as though by
accid or in a movement of impati he brought hi bent arm against
the pile with such forc that he sent everi book and there must have
been more than twenti of them over the desk right on to the head and
shoulder of hi choler client mr addison who wa sit
immedi beneath on the solicitor bench
down went the book with a crash and a bang and carri awai by their
weight down went mr addison on to hi nose among thema conting
that fiddlestick qc bythewai had not foreseen for he had
overlook the fact of hi client vicin
the judg made an aw face and then realis the ludicr natur of
the scene hi featur relax into a smile but mr addison did not
smile he bound up off the floor book slip off hi back in everi
direct and hold hi nose which wa injur with on hand came
skip right at hi learn advis
you did it on purpos he almost shout quit forget where he
wa just let me get at him ill have hi wig off and then without
wait for ani more the entir audienc burst out into a roar of
laughter which howev unseemli wa perfectli reason dure
which mr fiddlestick could be seen apologis in dumb show with a
bland smile upon hi counten while mr new and mr rosco between
them drag the outrag addison to hi seat and proffer him
handkerchief to wipe hi bleed nose
jame saw the whole thing and forget hi posit laugh too and
for some mysteri reason with the laugh hi nervous pass awai
the usher shout silenc with tremend energi and befor the sound
had di awai jame wa address the court in a clear and vigor
voic consciou that he wa a thorough master of hi case and the word
to state it in would not fail him fiddlestick qc had save him
mai it pleas your lordship he began the detail of thi case ar of
as remark an order as ani that to my knowledg have been brought
befor the court the plaintiff eustac meeson is the sole nextofkin
of jonathan meeson esquir the late head of the well known birmingham
publish firm of meeson addison and rosco under a will bear
date the 8th of mai 1880 the plaintiff wa left sole heir to the great
wealth of hi unclethat is with the except of some legaci under
a second will now reli on by the defend and date the 10th
novemb 1885 the plaintiff wa entir disinherit and the present
defend togeth with some six or eight legate were constitut
the sole beneficiari on or about the 22nd decemb 1885 howev the
testat execut a third testamentari document under which the plaintiff
take the entir properti and thi is the document now propound thi
testamentari document or rather willfor i submit that it is in
everi sens a properli execut willi tattoo upon the
shoulderssens in the courti tattoo upon the shoulder of
a young ladi miss augusta smither who will present be call befor
your lordship and to prevent ani misunderstand i mai as well at onc
state that sinc thi event thi ladi ha becom engag to be marri to
the plaintiff renew sensat
such my lord ar the main outlin of the case that i have to present
for the consider of the court which i think your lordship will
understand is of so remark and unpreced a natur that i must
crave your lordship indulg if i proce to open it at some length
begin the histori at it commenc
by thi time jame short had complet recov hi nerv and wa
inde almost oblivi of the fact that there wa anybodi present in
the court except the learn judg and himself go back to the
begin he detail the earli histori of the relationship between
eustac meeson and hi uncl the publish with which thi record ha
noth to do thenc he pass to the histori of augusta relat with
the firm of meeson and co which as nearli everybodi in the court not
except the judg had read jemima vow wa veri interest to hi
auditor then he went on to the scene between augusta and the publish
and detail how eustac had interf which interfer had led to a
violent quarrel result in the young man disinherit pass on
he detail how the publish and the publish had taken passag in the
same vessel and the tragic occurr which follow down to augusta
final rescu and arriv in england and final end hi spirit
open by appeal to the court not to allow it mind to be influenc
by the fact that sinc these event the two chief actor had becom
engag to be marri which struck him he said as a veri fit
climax to so romant a stori
at last he ceas and amidst a littl buzz of applaus for the speech
had realli been a veri fine on sat down as he did so he glanc at the
clock he had been on hi leg for nearli two hour and yet it seem to
him but a veri littl while in anoth moment he wa up again and had
call hi first witnesseustac meeson
eustac evid wa of a rather formal order and wa necessarili
limit to an account of the relat between hi uncl and himself and
between himself and augusta such as it wa howev he gave it veri
well and with a complet open that appear to produc a favor
impress on the court
then fiddlestick qc rose to crossexamin devot hi effort to
try to make eustac admit that hi behaviour had been of a natur to
ampli justifi hi uncl behaviour but there wa not veri much to be
made out of it eustac detail all that had pass freeli enough and
it simpli amount to the fact that there had been angri word between
the two as regard the treatment that augusta had met with at the hand
of the firm in short fiddlestick could not do anyth with him and
after ten minut of it sat down without have advanc the case to ani
appreci extent then sever of the other counsel ask a question or
two apiec after which eustac wa told to stand down and ladi
holmhurst wa call ladi holmhurst evid wa veri short mere
amount to the fact that she had seen augusta shoulder on board the
kangaroo and that there wa not then a sign of tattoo mark upon them
and when she saw them again in london thei were tattoo no attempt wa
made to crossexamin her and on the termin of her evid the
court adjourn for lunch when it reassembl jame short call
augusta and a murmur of expect aros from the dens crowd
audienc asfeel veri sick at heart and look more beauti than
eversh step toward the box
as she did so the attorneygener rose
i must object my lord he said on behalf of the defend to thi
wit be allow to enter the box
upon what ground mr attornei said hi lordship
upon the ground that her mouth is ipso facto close if we ar to
believ the plaintiff stori thi young ladi is herself the will of
jonathan meeson and be so is certainli i submit not compet to
give evid there is no preced for a document give evid and
i presum that the wit must be look upon as a document
but mr attornei said the judg a document is evid and
evid of the best sort
undoubtedli my lord and we have no object to the document be
exhibit for the court to draw it own conclus from but we deni that
it is entitl to speak in it own explan a document is a thing
which speak by it written charact it cannot take to itself a
tongu and speak by word of mouth also and in support of thi i mai
call your lordship attent to the gener principl of law govern
the interpret of written document
i am quit awar of those principl mr attornei and i cannot see
that thei touch thi question
as your lordship pleas then i will fall back upon my main content
that miss smither is for the purpos of thi case a document and
noth but a document and ha no more right to open her mouth in
support of the plaintiff case than would ani paper will if it could
be miracul endow with speech
well said the judg it certainli strike me as a novel point what
have you to sai to it mr short
all ey were now turn upon jame for it wa felt that if the point
wa decid against him the case wa lost
the point to which i wish you to address yourself mr short went on
the learn judg isi the person of miss smither so total
lost and merg in what for want of a better term i must call her
documentari capac as to take awai from her the right to appear befor
thi court like ani other sane human be and give evid of event
connect with it execut
if your lordship pleas said jame i maintain that thi is not so
i maintain that the document remain the document and that for all
purpos includ the give of evid concern it execut miss
smither still remain miss smither it would sure be absurd to argu
that becaus a person ha a deed execut upon her she wa ipso facto
incapacit from give evid concern it on the mere ground that
she wa it further such a decis would be contrari to equiti and
good polici for person could not so lightli be depriv of their
natur right also in thi case the plaintiff action would be
absolut put an end to by ani such decis see that the signatur
of jonathan meeson and the attest wit to the will could not of
cours be recognis in their tattoo form and there is no other
live person who could depos under what circumst the signatur
came to be there i submit that the object should be overrul
thi said hi lordship in give hi decis is a veri curiou
point and on which when first rais by the learn attorneygener
struck me with some forc but on consid it and hear mr short
i am convinc that it is an object that cannot be support here
eustac gave a sigh of relief it is argu on the part of the
defend that miss smither is for the purpos of thi case a
document a document and noth but a document and as such that her
mouth is shut now i think that the learn attorneygener cannot have
thought thi matter out when he came to that conclus what ar the
circumst a will is suppos to have been tattoo upon thi ladi
skin but is the skin the whole person doe not the intellig remain
and the individu i think that i can put what i mean more clearli by
mean of an illustr let us suppos that i were to uphold the
defend object and that as a consequ the plaintiff case
were to break down then let us suppos that the plaintiff had persuad
the wit to be partial skinnedher augusta nearli jump from her
seatand that she have surviv the oper wa again tender
to the court as a wit would the court then be abl under ani
possibl to refus to accept her evid the document in the form
of human parchment would then be in the hand of the offic of the
court and the person from whom the parchment had been remov would
also be befor the court could it be still maintain that the two were
so ident and insepar that the disabl attach to a
document must necessarili attach to the person in my opinion certainli
not or to take anoth case let us suppos that the will had been
tattoo upon the leg of a person and under similar circumst the
leg were cut off and produc befor the court either in a flesh or a
mummifi condit could it then be serious advanc that becaus the
inscrib legstand on the tabl befor the courthad onc belong
to the wit sit in the witnessbox therefor it wa not compet
for the wit to give evid on account of hi or her documentari
attribut certainli it could not therefor it seem to me that that
which is separ must for the purpos of law be taken as alreadi
separ and that the will on the back of thi wit must be look
upon as though it were in the hand at thi moment of the offic of
the court and consequ i overrul the object
will your lordship take a note of your lordship decis ask the
attorneygener in view of an appeal
certainli mr attornei let thi wit be sworn
chapter xxi
grant as prai
accordingli augusta wa sworn and eustac observ that when she
remov her veil to kiss the book the sight of her sweet face produc no
small effect upon the crowd court
then jame began hi examin in chief and follow the line which
he had laid down in hi open speech led her slowli whilst allow
her to tell her own stori as much as possibl to the time of the
tattoo of the will on kerguelen land all along the histori had
evid interest everybodi in the courtnot except the
judgeintens but now the excit rose to boil point
well said jame tell hi lordship exactli how it came to pass that
the will of mr meeson wa tattoo upon your shoulder
in quiet but dramat languag augusta accordingli narrat everi detail
from the time when meeson confid to her hi remors at have
disinherit hi nephew up to the execut of the will at her suggest
by the sailor upon her own shoulder
and now miss smither said jame when she had done i am veri
sorri to have to do so but i must ask you to exhibit the document to
the court
poor augusta colour and her ey fill with tear as she slowli undid
the dustcloak which hid her shoulder for of cours she had come in
low dress the judg look up sharpli observ her natur distress
if you prefer it miss smither said hi lordship courteous i
will order the court to be clear of everyon except those who ar
actual engag in the case
at these omin word a shudder of disgust pass through the
denselypack rank it would inde thei felt after all their
strive be hard if thei were depriv of the sight of the will and
thei stare at her despairingli to see what she would answer
i thank your lordship she said with a littl bow but there would
still be so mani left that i do not think that it would greatli matter i
hope that everybodi will understand my posit and extend their
consider to me
veri well said the judg and without further ado she took off the
cloak and the silk handkerchief beneath it and stood befor the court
dress in a low black dress
i am afraid that i must ask you to come up here said hi lordship
accordingli she walk round mount the bench and then turn her
back to the judg in order that he might examin what wa written on
it thi he did veri carefulli with the aid of a magnifi glass
refer now and again to the photograph copi which doctor probat
had file in the registri
thank you he said present that will do i am afraid that the
learn counsel below will wish to have an opportun of inspect
so augusta had to descend and slowli walk along the rank stop
befor everi learn leader to be carefulli examin while hundr of
eager ey in the background were fix upon her unfortun neck
howev at last it came to an end
that will do miss smither said the judg for whose consider
she felt deepli grate you can put on your cloak again now
accordingli she did so and reenter the box
the document which you have just shown the court miss smither said
jame is the on which wa execut upon you in kerguelen land on or
about the 22nd dai of decemb last year
it is
it wa i understand execut in the presenc of the testat and the
two attest wit all three be present togeth and the
signatur of each be tattoo in the presenc of the other
it wa
wa the testat so far as you could judg at the time of the
dictat and execut of the will of sound mind memori and
understand
most certainli he wa
did you beyond the suggest of which you have alreadi given
evid in ani wai unduli influenc the testat mind so as to
induc him to make thi will
i did not
and to those fact you swear
i do
then he pass on to the histori of the death of the two sailor who had
attest the will and to the account of augusta ultim rescu
final close hi examinationinchief just as the clock struck four
whereon the court adjourn till the follow dai
as mai be imagin though thing had gone fairli well so far nobodi
concern of our parti pass an overcomfort night the strain wa
too great to admit of it and realli thei were all glad to find
themselv in the courtwhich wa if possibl even more crowd on the
follow morningfil with the hope that that dai might see the
matter decid on wai or the other
as soon as the judg had come in augusta resum her place in the
witnessbox and the attorneygener rose to crossexamin her
you told the court miss smither at the conclus of your evid
that you ar now engag to be marri to mr meeson the plaintiff
now i am sorri to have to put a person question to you but i must
ask youwer you at the time of the tattoo of the will in love with
mr meeson
thi wa a homethrust and poor augusta colour up beneath it howev
her nativ wit came to her aid
if you will defin sir what be in love is i will do my best to
answer your question she said whereat the audienc includ hi
lordship smile
the attorneygener look puzzl as well he might for there ar some
thing which ar beyond the learn of even an attorneygener
well he said were you matrimoni inclin toward mr meeson
sure mr attorneygener said the judg the on thing doe not
necessarili includ the other
i bow to your lordship experi said mr attornei tartli
perhap i had better put my question in thi wayhad you at ani time
ani prospect of becom engag to mr meeson
none whatev
did you submit to thi tattoo which must have been pain with a
view of becom engag to the plaintiff
certainli not i mai point out she ad with hesit that such
a disfigur is not like to add to anybodi attract
pleas answer my question miss smither and do not comment on them
how did you come then to submit yourself to such a disagre
oper
i submit to it becaus i thought it right to do so there be no
other appar mean at hand of attain the late mr meeson end
alsoand she paus
also what
also i had a regard for mr eustac meeson and i knew that he had lost
hi inherit through a quarrel about myself
ah now we ar come to it then you were tattoo out of regard for
the plaintiff and not pure in the interest of justic
ye i suppos so
well mr attornei interpos the judg and what if she wa
my object my lord wa to show that thi young ladi wa not the pure
impass medium in thi matter that my learn friend mr short would
lead the court to believ she wa act from motiv
most peopl do said the judg drili but it doe not follow that the
motiv wa an improp on
then the learn gentleman continu hi crossexamin direct all
the ingenu of hi practis mind to try to prove by augusta
admiss first that the testat wa act under the undu
influenc of herself and secondli that when the will wa execut he
wa non compo menti to thi end he dwelt at great length on everi
detail of the event between the tattoo of the will and the death of
the testat on the follow dai make as much as wa possibl out of
the fact that he di in a fit of mania but do what he would he could
not shake her evid upon ani materi point and when at last he sat
down jame short felt that hi case had not receiv ani seriou blow
then a few more question have been ask in crossexamin by
variou other counsel jame rose to reexamin and with the object of
rebut the presumpt of the testat mental unsound made
augusta repeat all the detail of the confess that the late publish
had made to her as regard hi method of trade it wa beauti to
see the furi and horror portrai upon the counten of the choler
mr addison and the cadaver mr rosco when thei saw the most
cherish secret of the custom of the trade as practis at meeson
thu parad in the open light of dai while a dozen swiftpencil
report took everi detail down
then at last augusta wa told to stand down which she did thankfulli
enough and mr thoma the wife of captain thoma wa call she
prove the find of augusta on the island and that she had seen
the hat of on of the sailor and the rumcask twothird empti and
also produc the shell out of which the men had drunk the rum which
shell the judg had call augusta to identifi what wa most
import howev wa that she gave the most distinct evid that
she had herself seen the late mr meeson inter and identifi
the bodi as that of the late publish by pick out hi photograph
from among a bundl of a dozen that were hand to her also she
swore that when augusta came aboard the whaler the tattoo mark on
her back were not heal
no crossexamin of the wit worth the name have been attempt
jame call a clerk from the offic of the late owner of the rm
kangaroo who produc the roll of the ship on which the name of the
two sailor johnni butt and bill jone duli appear
thi close the plaintiff case and the attorneygener at onc
proceed to call hi wit reserv hi remark till the
conclus of the evid he had onli two wit mr todd the
lawyer who drew and attest the will of nov 10 and hi clerk who also
attest it and their examin did not take long in
crossexamin howev both these wit admit that the
testat wa in a great state of passion when he execut the will and
gave detail of the live scene that then occur
then the attorneygener rose to address the court for the defend
he said there were two question befor the court reserv for the
present the question as to the admiss of the evid of augusta
smither and those werefirst did the tattoo mark upon the ladi
neck constitut a will at all and secondli suppos that thei did wa
it prove to the satisfact of the court that these undat mark were
duli execut by a sane and uninfluenc man in the presenc of the
wit as requir by the statut he maintain in the first place
that these mark were no will within the mean of the statut but
feel that he wa not on veri sound ground on thi point quickli
pass on to the other aspect of the case with much forc and abil
he dwelt upon the strang of the whole stori and how it rest
sole upon the evid of on wit augusta smither it wa onli if
the court accept her evid as it stood that it could come to the
conclus that the will wa execut at all or inde that the two
attest wit were on the island at all consid the relat
which exist between thi wit and the plaintiff wa the court
prepar to accept her evid in thi unreserv wai wa it prepar
to decid that thi will in favour of a man with whom the testat had
violent quarrel and had disinherit in consequ of that
quarrel wa not if inde it wa execut at all extort by thi ladi
from a weak and dy and possibl a derang man and with thi
question the learn gentleman sat down
he wa follow briefli by the solicitorgener and mr fiddlestick but
though thei talk fluentli enough address themselv to variou
minor point thei had noth fresh of interest to adduc and
finish at halfpast three jame rose to repli on the whole case on
behalf of the plaintiff
there wa a moment paus while he wa arrang hi note and then
just as he wa about to begin the judg said quietli thank you mr
short i do not think that i need troubl you and jame sat down with a
gasp for he knew that the caus wa won
then hi lordship began and after give a masterli summari of the
whole case conclud as followssuch ar the detail of the most
remark probat caus that i ever rememb to have had brought to my
notic either dure my career at the bar or on the bench it will be
obviou as the learn attorneygener ha said that the whole case
realli li between two point is the document on the back of augusta
smither a suffici will to carri the properti and if so is the
unsupport stori of that ladi as to the execut of the document to be
believ now what doe the law understand by the term will sure it
understand some write that express the wish or will of a person as
to the disposit of hi properti after hi deceas thi write must
be execut with certain formal but if it is so execut by a
person not labour under ani mental or other disabl it is
indefeas except by the subsequ execut of a fresh testamentari
document or by it destruct or attempt destruct animo
revocandi or by marriag subject to these formal requir by the
law the form of the documentprovid that it mean is cleari
immateri now do the tattoo mark on the back of thi ladi constitut
such a document and do thei convei the true last will or wish of the
testat that is the first point that i have to decid and i decid it
in the affirm it is true that it is not usual for testamentari
document to be tattoo upon the skin of a human be but becaus it
is not usual it doe not follow that a tattoo document is not a valid
on the ninth section of the statut of 1 vic cap 26 specifi that
no will shall be valid unless it shall be in write but cannot thi
tattoo be consid as write within the mean of the act i am
clearli of opinion that it can if onli on the ground that the materi
us wa inka natur ink it is true that of the cuttlefish but
still ink for i mai remark that the natur product of the cuttlefish
wa at on time larg us in thi countri for that veri purpos
further in refer to thi part of the case it must be born in mind
that the testat wa no eccentr be who from whim or pervers
chose thi extraordinari method of signifi hi wish as to the
dispos of hi properti he wa a man place in about as terribl a
posit as it is possibl to conceiv he wa if we ar to believ the
stori of miss smither most sincer anxiou to revok a disposit of
hi properti which he now stand face to face with the greatest issu
of thi life recognis to be unjust and which wa certainli contrari
to the prompt of natur as experienc by most men and yet in thi
terribl strait in which he found himself and notwithstand the
earnest desir which grew more intens as hi vital forc eb he
could find absolut no mean of carri out hi wish at length
howev thi plan of tattoo hi will upon the live flesh on a
younger and stronger person is present to him and he eagerli avail
himself of it and the tattoo is duli carri out in hi presenc and
at hi desir and as duli sign and wit can it be serious
argu that a document so execut doe not fulfil the bare requir
of the law i think that it cannot and am of opinion that such a
document is as much a valid will as though it had been engross upon the
skin of a sheep and duli sign and wit in the templ
and now i will come to the second point is the evid of miss
smither to be believ first let us see where it is corrobor it
is clear from the testimoni of ladi holmhurst that when on board the
illfat kangaroo miss smither had no tattoo mark upon her
shoulder it is equal clear from the unshaken testimoni of mr
thoma that when she wa rescu by the american whaler her back wa
mark with tattoo then in the heal stagewith tattoo which
could not possibl have been inflict by herself or by the child who
wa her sole live companion it is also prove that there wa seen upon
the island by mr thoma the dead bodi of a man which she wa inform
wa that of mr meeson and which she here in court identifi by mean
of a photograph also thi same wit produc a shell which she
pick up in on of the hut said to be the shell us by the sailor to
drink the rum that led to their destruct and she swore that she saw a
sailor hat ly on the shore now all thi is corrobor evid
and of a sort not to be despis inde as to on point that of the
approxim date of the execut of the tattoo it is to my mind
final still there doe remain an enorm amount that must be accept
or not accord as to whether or no credenc can be place in the
unsupport testimoni of miss smither for we cannot call on a child so
young as the present lord holmhurst to bear wit in a court of
justic if miss smither for instanc is not speak the truth when
she declar that the signatur of the testat wa tattoo upon her
under hi immedi direct or that it wa tattoo in the presenc of
the two sailor butt and jone whose signatur were also tattoo in
the presenc of the testat and of each otherno will at all wa
execut and the plaintiff case collaps utterli sinc from the
veri natur of the fact evid as to handwrit would of cours be
useless now i approach the decis of thi point after anxiou
thought and some hesit it is not a light thing to set asid a
formal execut document such as the will of nov 10 upon which the
defend reli and to entir alter the devolut of a vast amount of
properti upon the unsupport testimoni of a singl wit it seem to
me howev that there ar two test which the court can more or less
set up as standard wherewith to measur the truth of the matter the
first of these is the accept probabl of the action of an individu
under ani given set of circumst as drawn from our common knowledg
of human natur and the second the behaviour and tone of the wit
both in the box and in the cours of circumst that led to her
appear there i will take the last of those two first and i mai as
well state without further delai that i am convinc of the truth of
the stori told by miss smither it would to my mind be imposs for
ani man whose intellig had been train by year of experi in
thi and other court and whose daili duti it is to discrimin as to
the credibl of testimoni to disbeliev the histori so
circumstanti detail in the box by miss smither sensat i
watch her demeanour both under examin and crossexamin veri
close inde and i am convinc that she wa tell the absolut
truth so far as she knew it
and now to come to the second point it ha been suggest as throw
doubt upon miss smither stori that the exist of an engag to
marri between her and the plaintiff mai have prompt her to concoct a
monstrou fraud for hi benefit and thi is suggest although at the
time of the execut of the tattoo no such engag did as a
matter of fact exist or wa within measur distanc of the parti
it did not exist said the attorneygener but the dispos mind
exist in other word that she wa then in loveif notwithstand
mr attornei difficulti in defin it i mai us the term with the
plaintiff thi mai or mai not have been the case there ar some thing
which it is quit beyond the power of ani judg or juri to decid and
on of them certainli isat what exact period of her acquaint with a
futur husband a young ladi regard turn into a warmer feel but
suppos that the attorneygener is right and that although she at
that moment clearli had no prospect of marri him sinc she had left
england to seek her fortun at the antipod the plaintiff wa look
upon by thi ladi with that kind of regard which is suppos to preced
the matrimoni contract the circumst in my mind tell rather in
hi favour than against him for in pass i mai remark that thi young
ladi ha done a thing which is in it wai littl short of heroic the
more so becaus it ha a ludicr side she ha submit to an
oper which must not onli have been pain but which is and alwai
will be a blot upon her beauti i am inclin to agre with the
attorneygener when he sai that she did not make the sacrific without
a motiv which mai have sprung from a keen sens of justic and of
gratitud to the plaintiff for hi interfer on her behalf or from a
warmer feel in either case there is noth discredit about
itrath the revers in fact and taken by itself there is certainli
noth here to caus me to disbeliev the evid of miss smither
on question onli seem to me to remain is there anyth to show that
the testat wa not at the time of the execut of the will of a
sound and dispos mind and is there anyth in hi conduct or histori
to render the hypothesi of hi have execut hi will so improb
that the court should take the improb into account as to the
first point i can find noth miss smither expressli swore that it
wa not the case nor wa her statement shaken by a veri search
crossexamin she admit inde that shortli befor death he
wander in hi mind and thought that he wa surround by the shade of
author wait to be reveng upon him but it is no uncommon thing for
the mind thu to fail at the last and it is not extraordinari that thi
dy man should conjur befor hi brain the shape of those with some
of whom he appear to have dealt harshli dure hi life nor do i
consid it in ani wai imposs that when he felt hi end approach
he should have wish to revers the sentenc of hi anger and restor
hi nephew whose onli offenc had been a somewhat indiscreet us of the
languag of truth the inherit to vast wealth of which he had
depriv him such a cours strike me as be a most natur and proper
on and perfectli in accord with the first principl of human
natur the whole tale is undoubtedli of a wild and romant order and
onc again illustr the sai that truth is stranger than fiction
but i have no choic but to accept the fact that the deceas did by
mean of tattoo carri out by hi order legal execut hi true
last will in favour of hi nextofkin eustac h meeson upon the
shoulder of augusta smither on or about the 22nd dai of decemb
1885 thi be so i pronounc for the will propound by the
plaintiff and there will be a grant as prai
with cost my lord ask jame rise
no i am not inclin to go that length thi litig ha arisen
through the testat own act and the estat must bear the burden
if your lordship pleas said jame and sat down
mr short said the judg clear hi throat i do not often speak
in such a sens but i do feel call upon to compliment you upon the wai
in which you have singlehand conduct thi casein some wai on
of the strangest and most import that ha ever come befor mehav
for your oppon so formid an arrai of learn gentlemen the
perform would have been credit to anybodi of greater experi
and longer year as it is i believ it to be unpreced
jame turn colour bow and sat down know that he wa a made man
and that it would be hi own fault if hi futur career at the bar wa
not now on of almost unexampl prosper

the court broke up in confus and augusta now that the strain wa

did not gild the pill for the possess of monei doe not detract from
the desir for the acquisit of more mr addison wa purpl with furi

mr addison who wa close by overheard thi littl speech and a new

well then we should have to work for our livingthat all i have got
my billet and you could write for the press until your five year
agreement with meeson and co ha run out i would put you in the wai of
that i see lot of write peopl at my shop
well said augusta i will speak to bessi about it
oh of cours ladi holmhurst will sai no said eustac gloomili she
will think about the thing and besid she wont want to lose you
befor she is oblig
that is all that i can do for you sir said augusta with decis
therecomethat enough goodnight and break awai from him she
made a pretti littl curtsei and vanish
now i wonder what she mean to do medit eustac as the butler
brought him hi hat i realli should not wonder if she came round to it
but then on never know how a woman will take a thing if she will she
will etc etc
and now it mai strike the reader as veri strang but as a matter of
fact ten dai from the date of the abov convers there wa a
smallandearli gather at st georg hanoversquar close by i
sai small for the marriag had been kept quit secret in order to
prevent curiositymong from march down upon it in their thousand
as thei would certainli have done had it been announc that the heroin
of the great will case wa go to be marri therefor the parti wa
veri select augusta had no relat of her own and so she had ask
dr probat with whom she had struck up a great friendship to come and
give her awai and though the old gentleman previou career had had
more connect with the undo of the nuptial tie than with it
contract he could not find it in hi heart to refus
i shall be neglect my duti you know my dear young ladi he said
shake hi head it veri wrongveri wrong for i ought to be at the
registri butwel perhap i can manag to comeveri wrong
thoughveri wrong and quit out of my line of busi i expect that i
shall begin to address the courti mean the clergymanfor the
petition
and so it came to pass that on thi auspici dai the regist wa
left to look after itself and as a matter of histori it mai be state
that no question wa ask in parliament about it
then there wa ladi holmhurst look veri pretti in her widow dress
and her boi dick who wa in the highest spirit and burst with
health and wonder at these strang proceed on the part of hi
aunti and of cours the legal twin brought up the rear
and there in the vestri stood augusta in her bridal dress as sweet a
woman as ever the sun shone on and look at her beauti face dr
probat nearli fell in love with her himself and yet it wa a sad face
just then she wa happyveri as a love woman who is about to be made
a wife should be but when a great joi draw near to us it come
companion by the shadow of our old grief
the highest sort of happi ha a peculiar faculti of recal to our
mind that which ha troubl them in the past the truth be that
extrem in thi as in other matter will sometim touch which would
seem to suggest that sorrow and happinesshowev vari in their
bloomyet have a common root thu it wa with augusta now as she
stood in the vestri there came to her mind a recollect of her dear
littl sister and of how she had prophesi happi great and success
for her now the happi and the success were at hand and there in the
aisl stood her own true love but yet the recollect of that dear
face and of the littl mound that cover it rest on them like a
shadow it pass with a sigh and in it place there came the memori of
poor mr tombei but for whom she would not have been stand there a
bride and of hi last word as he put her into the boat he wa food for
fish now poor fellow and she wa left alon with a great and happi
career open out befor hera career in which her talent would have
free space to work and yet how odd to think it two or three score of
year and it would all be on and she would be as mr tombei wa poor
mr tombei perhap it wa as well that he wa not there to see her
happi and let us hope that wherev it is we go after the last event
we lose sight of the world and those we knew therein otherwis there
must be more heart broken in heaven abov than in earth beneath
now then miss smither broke in dr probat for the veri last
timenobodi will call you that again you knowtak my arm hi
lordshipi mean the parsoni there
it wa done and thei were man and wife well even the happiest marriag
is alwai a good thing to get over it wa not a long drive back to
hanoversquar and the veri first sight that greet them on their
arriv wa the infant from the citi john accompani by hi
brother the infant from pumpcourt jame who had presum come to
show him the wai or more probabl becaus he thought that there would be
eatabl goinghold in hi hand a legallook letter
mark immedi sir so i thought that i had better serv it at
onc said the first infant hand the letter to john
what is it ask eustac nervous he had grown to hate the sight of
a lawyer letter with a deadli hate
notic of appeal i expect said john
open it man said eustac and let get it over
accordingli john did so and read as follow
meeson v addison and anoth
dear siraft consult with our client messr addison and
rosco we ar enabl to make you the follow offer if no account is
requir of the mesn profit

profit deriv from real estat just like a solicitor to make such
a blunder
the term is perfectli appropri repli hi twin with warmth
there wa some real estat and therefor the term can properli be
appli to the whole of the incom
for heaven sake dont argu but get on said eustac dont you see
that i am on tenterhook
my client continu john ar readi to undertak that no appeal
shall be present to the recent case of meeson v addison and anoth
if howev the plaintiff insist upon an account the usual step will
be taken to bring the matter befor a higher courtobedi your

pardon i forgot perhap you would like to take counsel advic and
he point to jame who wa rub hi bald bead indignantli
oh no i should not answer eustac iv quit made up my mind
let them stick to their mesn here jame made a face well then to
their middl or intermedi or their anyth els profit no appeal
for me if i can avoid it send new a telegram
that began jame in hi most solemn and legal tone is a view of
the matter in which i am glad to be abl to heartili coincid
although it seem to me that there ar sever point which i will
touch on on by on
good graciou no broke in ladi holmhurst but i think it is rather
mean of them dont you mr short
jame look puzzl i do not quit take ladi holmhurst point he
said plaintiv
then you must be stupid said eustac dont you see the
jokemesn profit mean of them
ah said jame with satisfact i perceiv ladi holmhurst doe not
seem to be awar that although mesnea total erron wordi
pronounc mean it is spelt mesn
i stand correct said ladi holmhurst with a littl curtsei i
thought that mr jame short would take my ignor into account and
understand what i mean
thi atroci pun turn the laugh against the learn jame and then
the telegram to new and new have been dispatch thei all went in to
the wed breakfast
in a gener wai wed breakfast ar not particularli live affair
there is a mock hilar about them that doe not tend to true
cheer and those of the guest who ar not occupi with graver
thought ar probabl think of the dyspepsia that come after but
thi particular breakfast wa an except for the first time sinc her
husband unfortun death ladi holmhurst seem to have entir
recov her spirit and wa her old self and a veri charm self it
wa so charm inde that even jame forgot hi learn and the
respons of hi nobl profess and talk like an ordinari
christian inde he even went so far as to pai her an elephantin
compliment but as it wa three sentenc long and divid into point
it shall not be repeat here
and then at length dr probat rose to propos the bride health and
veri nice he did it as might have been expect from a man with hi
extraordinari familiar with matrimoni affair hi speech wa quit
charm and aptli sprinkl with classic quotat
i have often he end heard it advanc that all men ar in realiti
equal favour by the fate in their passag through the world i have
alwai doubt the truth of that assert and now i am convinc of it
falsiti mr eustac is a veri excel young man and if i mai be
allow to sai so a veri goodlook young man but what i would ask
thi assembl compani ha mr meeson done abov the rest of men to
justifi hi suprem good fortun why should thi young gentleman be
pick out from the multitud of young gentlemen to inherit two million
of monei and to marri the most charmingy the most charm the
most talent and the bravest young ladi that i have ever meta young
ladi who not onli carri twenti fortun on her face but anoth
fortun in her brain and hi fortun on her neckand such a fortun
too sirand he bow toward eustac
love thai sit besid thee
take the good the god provid thee
i salut you as all men must salut on so suprem favour humbl
i salut you humbl i prai that you mai continu deserv the almost
unparallel good that it ha pleas provid to bestow upon you
and then eustac rose and made hi speech and a veri good speech it wa
consid the try circumst under which it wa made he told
them how he had fallen in love with augusta sweet face the veri first
time that he had set ey upon it in the offic of hi uncl at
birmingham he told them what he had felt when after get some work
in london he had return to birmingham to find hi ladylov flown and
of what he had endur when he heard that she wa among the drown on
board the kangaroo then he came to the happi dai of the return and to
that still happier dai when he discov that he had not love her in
vain final end thu
dr probat ha said that i am a suprem fortun man and i admit
the truth of hi remark i am inde fortun abov my desert so
fortun that i feel afraid when i turn and see my belov wife sit
at my side i feel afraid lest i should after all be dream a dream
and awak to find noth but empti and then on the other hand is
thi coloss wealth which ha come to me through her and there again i
feel afraid but pleas heaven i hope with her help to do some good
with it and rememb alwai that it is a great trust that ha been
place in my hand and she also is a trust and a far more inestim
on and as i deal with her so mai i be dealt with here and hereaft
then by an afterthought he propos the health of the legal twin who
had so nobli born the brunt of the affrai singlehand and
disconcert the attorneygener and all hi learn host
thereon jame rose to repli in term of elephantin eloqu and would
have gone through the whole case again had not ladi holmhurst in despair
pull him by the sleev and told him that he must propos her health
which he did with sincer lightli allud to the fact that she wa a
widow by describ her as be in a discovert condit with all the
right and respons of a femm sole
everybodi burst out laugh not except poor ladi holmhurst herself
and jame sat down not without indign that a giddi world should
object to an exact and legal definit of the statu of the individu
as set out by the law
and after that augusta went and chang her dress and then came the
hurri goodby and to escap observ thei drove off in a
hansom cab amidst a shower of old shoe
and there in that hansom cab we will leav them
