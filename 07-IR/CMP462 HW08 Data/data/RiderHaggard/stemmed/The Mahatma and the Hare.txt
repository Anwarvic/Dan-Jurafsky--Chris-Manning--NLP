the mahatma and the hare
a dream stori
by h rider haggard
ultim a good hare wa found which took the field at
there the hound press her and on the hunt arriv at the edg
of the cliff the hare could be seen cross the beach and go
right out to sea a boat wa procur and the master and some
other row out to her just as she drown and bring the
bodi in gave it to the hound a hare swim out to sea is a
sight not often witnessedloc paper januari 1911
a long check occur in the latter part of thi hunt the
hare have laid up in a hedgerow from which she wa at last
evict by a crack of the whip her next place of refug wa a
horsepond which she tri to swim but got stuck in the ic
midwai and wa sink when the huntsman went in after her it
wa a novel sight to see huntsman and hare be lift over a
wall out of the pond the eager pack wait for their prei behind
the wallloc paper februari 1911
the author suppos that the first of the abov extract must have
impress him at ani rate on the night after the read of it just
as he went to sleep or on the follow morn just as he awok he
cannot tell which there came to him the titl and the outlin of thi
fantasi includ the command with which it end with a particular
clear did he seem to see the pictur of the great white road
straight as the wai of the spirit and broad as the breast of death
and of the littl hare travel toward the aw gate
like the mahatma of thi fabl he express no opinion as to the merit
of the controversi between the redfac man and the hare that without
search on hi own part present itself to hi mind in so odd a
fashion it is on on which anybodi interest in such matter can form
an individu judgment
the mahatma
mahatma greatsoul on of a class of person with
preternatur power imagin to exist in india and
thibetnew english dictionari
everyon ha seen a hare either crouch or run in the field
or hang dead in a poulter shop or lastli pathet even
dreadfullook and in thi form almost indistinguish from a
skin cat on the domest tabl but not mani peopl have met a
mahatma at least to their knowledg not mani peopl know even who or
what a mahatma is the major of those who chanc to have heard the
titl ar apt to confus it with anoth that of mad hatter
thi is even done of malic prepens especi for obviou reason
if a hare is in ani wai concern in scorn not in ignor by
person who ar well acquaint with the real mean of the word and
even with it sanscrit origin the truth is that an incredul western
world put no faith in mahatma to it a mahatma is a kind of spiritu
mr harri give an address in thibet at which no letter ar
deliv either it sai there is no such person or he is a
fraudul scamp with no greater occult powerswel than a hare
i confess that thi view of mahatma is on that doe not surpris me
in the least i never met and i scarc expect to meet an individu
entitl to set mahatma after hi name certainli i have no right to
do so who onli took that titl on the spur of the moment when the hare
ask me how i wa call and now make us of it as a nomdeplum
it is true there is jorsen by whose order for it amount to that i
publish thi histori for aught i know jorsen mai be a mahatma but he
doe not in the least look the part
imagin a bluff person with a strong hard face pierc grei ey and
veri promin bushi eyebrow of about fifti or sixti year of ag
add a scotch accent and a meerschaum pipe which he smoke even when he
is wear a frock coat and a tall hat and you have jorsen i believ
that he live somewher in the countri is well off and practis
garden if so he ha never ask me to hi place and i onli meet him
when he come to town as i understand to visit flowershow
then i alwai meet him becaus he order me to do so not by letter or
by word of mouth but in quit a differ wai suddenli i receiv an
impress in my mind that i am to go to a certain place at a certain
hour and that there i shall find jorsen i do go sometim to an
hotel sometim to a lodg sometim to a railwai station or to the
corner of a particular street and there i do find jorsen smoke hi big
meerschaum pipe we shake hand and he explain why he ha sent for me
after which we talk of variou thing never mind what thei ar for
that would be tell jorsen secret as well as my own which i must
not do
it mai be ask how i came to know jorsen well in a strang wai
nearli thirti year ago a dread thing happen to me i wa marri
and although still young a person of some mark in literatur inde
even now on or two of the book which i wrote ar read and rememb
although it is suppos that their author ha long left the world
the thing which happen wa that my wife and our daughter were come
over from the channel island where thei had been on a visit she wa a
jersei woman and andwel the ship wa lost that all the shock
broke my heart in such a wai that it ha never been mend again but
unfortun did not kill me
afterward i took to drink and sank as drunkard do then the river
began to draw me i had a lodg in a poor street at chelsea and i
could hear the river call me at night andi wish to die as the
other had di at last i yield for the drink had rot out all
my moral sens about on oclock of a wild winter morn i went to a
bridg i knew where in those dai policemen rare came and listen to
that call of the water
come it seem to sai thi world is the real hell end in the
etern naught the dream of a life beyond and of reunion there
ar but a demon mock breath into the mortal heart lest by it
univers suicid mankind should rob him of hi torturepit there is
no truth in all your father taught you he wa a clergyman and rather
emin in hi profess there is no hope for man there is noth
he can win except the deep happi of sleep come and sleep
such were the argument of that voic of the river the old familiar
argument of desol and despair i leant over the parapet in
anoth moment i should have been gone when i becam awar that some
on wa stand near to me i did not see the person becaus it wa too
dark i did not hear him becaus of the rave of the wind but i knew
that he wa there so i wait until the moon shone out for a while
between the edg of two rag cloud the shape of which i can see to
thi hour it show me jorsen look just as he doe todai for he
never seem to changejorsen on whom to my knowledg i had not set
ey befor
even a year ago he said in hi strong rough voic you would not
have allow your mind to be convinc by such argument as those which
you have just heard in the voic of the river that is on of the worst
side of drink it decai the reason as it doe the bodi you must have
notic it yourself
i repli that i had for i wa surpris into acquiesc then i grew
defiant and ask him what he knew of the argument which were or were
not influenc me to my surpriseno that is not the wordto my
bewilder he repeat them to me on by on just as thei had arisen
a few minut befor in my heart moreov he told me what i had been
about to do and why i wa about to do it
you know me and my stori i mutter at last
no he answer at least not more than i know that of mani men with
whom i chanc to be in touch that is i have not met you for nearli
eleven hundr year a thousand and eightysix to be correct i wa a
blind priest then and you were the captain of iren guard
at thi new i burst out laugh and the laugh did me good
i did not know i wa so old i said
do you call that old answer jorsen why the first time that we
had anyth to do with each other so far as i can learn that is wa
over eight thousand year ago in egypt befor the begin of record
histori
i thought that i wa mad but you ar madder i said
doubtless well i am so mad that i manag to be here in time to save
you from suicid as onc in the past you save me for thu thing come
round but your room ar near ar thei not let us go there and talk
thi place is cold and the river is alwai call
that wa how i came to know jorsen whom i believ to be on of the
greatest men aliv on thi particular night that i have describ he
told me mani thing and sinc then he ha taught me much me and a few
other but whether he is what is call a mahatma i am sure i do not
know he ha never claim such a rank in my hear or inde to be
anyth more than a man who ha succeed in win a knowledg of hi
own power out of the depth of the dark that li behind us of cours
i mean out of hi past in other incarn long befor he wa jorsen
moreov by degre as i grew fit to bear the light he show me
someth of my own and of how the two were intertwin
but all these thing ar secret of which i have perhap no right to
speak at present it is enough to sai that jorsen chang the current of
my life on that night when he save me from death
for instanc from that dai onward to the present time i have never
touch the drink which so nearli ruin me also the dark ha
roll awai and with it everi doubt and fear i know the truth and
for that truth i live consid from certain aspect such knowledg
i admit is not altogeth desir thu it ha depriv me of my
interest in earthli thing ambit ha left me altogeth for year
i have had no wish to succe in the profess which i adopt in my
youth or in ani other inde i doubt whether the element of worldli
success still remain in me whether thei ar not entir burnt awai by
that fire of wisdom in which i have bath how can we strive to win a
crown we have no longer ani desir to wear now i desir other crown
and at time i wear them if onli for a littl while my spirit grow
and grow it is drag at it string
what am i to look at a small whitehair man with a thin and rather
plaintiv face in which ar set two larg dark ey that continu
seem to soften and develop that is my pictur and what am i in the
world i will tell you on certain dai of the week i emploi myself in
edit a trade journal that ha to do with haberdasheri on anoth
dai i act as auction to a firm which import and sell cheap italian
statuari modern veri modern copi of the antiqu florid marbl
vase and so forth some of you who read mai have pass such mart
in differ part of the citi or even have drop in and purchas a
bust or a tazza for a surprisingli small sum perhap i knock it
down to you onli too pleas to find a bon fide bidder amongst my
compani
as for the rest of my timewel i emploi it in do what good i
can among the poor and those who need comfort or who ar bereav
especi among those who ar bereav for to such i am sometim abl
to bring the breath of hope that blow from anoth shore
occasion also i amus myself in my own fashion thu sure knowledg
ha come to me about certain epoch in the past in which i live in
other shape and i studi those epoch hope that on dai i mai find
time to write of them and of the part i plai in them some of these
part ar extrem interest especi as i am of cours abl to
contrast them with our modern mode of thought and action
thei do not all come back to me with equal clear the earlier
live be as on might expect the more difficult to recov and the
compar recent on the easiest also thei seem to rang over a
vast stretch of time back inde to the dai of primev prehistor
man in short i think the subconsci in some wai resembl the
consciou and natur memori that which is veri far off to it grow dim
and blur that which is compar close remain clear and sharp
although of cours thi rule is not invari moreov there is
foresight as well as memori at least from time to time i seem to come
in touch with futur event and state of societi in which i shall have
my share
i believ some thinker hold a theori that such condit as those of
past present and futur do not in fact exist that everyth alreadi
is stand like a complet column between earth and heaven that
the sum is ad up the equat work out at time i am tempt to
believ in the truth of thi proposit but if it be true of cours
it remain difficult to obtain a clear view of other part of the column
than that in which we happen to find ourselv object consciou at
ani given period and needless to sai imposs to see it from base to
capit
howev thi mai be no individu entiti pervad all the column
there ar great section of it with which that entiti ha noth to
do although it alwai seem to appear again abov i suppos that those
section which ar empti of an individu and hi atmospher repres
the interv between hi live which he spend in sleep or in state
of exist with which thi world is not concern but of such gulf
of oblivion and state of be i know noth
to take a singl instanc of what i do know onc thi spirit of mine
that now by the work of destini for a littl while occupi the bodi
of a fourthrat auction and of the editor of a trade journal dwelt
in that of a pharaoh of egyptnev mind which pharoah ye although
you mai laugh and think me mad to sai it for me the legion fought
and thunder to me the peopl bow and the secret sanctuari were
open that i and i alon might commun with the god i who in the
flesh and after it myself wa worship as a god
well of thi forgotten royalti of whom littl is known save what a
few inscript have to tell there remain a portrait statu in the
british museum sometim i go to look at that statu and try to recal
exactli under what circumst i caus it to be shape puzzl out
the stori bit by bit
not long ago i stood thu absorb and did not notic that the hour of
the close of the great galleri had come still i stood and gaze and
dreamt till the policeman on duti see and suspect me came up and
roughli order me to begon
the man tone anger me i laid my hand on the foot of the statu for
it had just come back to me that it wa a ka imag a sacr thing
ani egyptologist will know what i mean which for ag had sat in a
chamber of my tomb then the ka that cling to it etern awok at my
touch and knew me or so i suppos at least i felt myself chang a new
strength came into me my shape batter in thi world storm put on
someth of it ancient digniti my ey grew royal i look at that
man as pharaoh mai have look at on who had done him insult he saw
the chang and trembledy trembl i believ he thought i wa some
imperi ghost that the shadow of even had caus him to mistak for
man at ani rate he gasp out
i beg your pardon i wa obei order i hope your majesti wont hurt
me now i think of it i have been told that thing come out of these old
statu in the night
then turn he ran liter ran where to i am sure i do not know
probabl to seek the fellowship of some other policeman in due cours i
follow and lift the bar at the end of the hall depart without
further question ask afterward i wa veri glad to think that i had
done the man no injuri at the moment i knew that i could hurt him if
i would and what is more i had the desir to do so it came to me i
suppos with that breath of the past when i wa so great and absolut
perhap i or that part of me then incarn wa a tyrant in those
dai and thi is why now i must be so humbl fate is turn my pride
to it hammer and beat it out of me
for thu in the long histori of the soul it serv all our vice
the great white road
now as i have hint under the teach of jorsen who save me from
degrad and selfmurd ye and help me with monei until onc
again i could earn a livelihood i have acquir certain knowledg and
wisdom of a sort that ar not common that is jorsen taught me
the element of these thing he set my feet upon the path which
thenceforward have the sight i have been abl to follow for myself
how i follow it doe not matter nor could i teach other if i would
i am no member of ani mystic brotherhood and as i have explain no
mahatma although i have call myself thu for present purpos becaus
the name is a conveni cloak i repeat that i am ignor if there
ar such peopl as mahatma though if so i think jorsen must be on
of them still he never told me thi what he ha told is that everi
individu spirit must work out it own destini quit independ
of other inde be rather fond of fine phrase he ha sometim
spoken to me of or rather insist upon what he call the lonesom
splendour of the human soul which it is our busi to perfect
through variou live till i can scarc appreci and am certainli
unabl to describ
to tell the truth the thought of thi lonesom splendour to which
it seem some of us mai attain alarm me i have had enough of be
lonesom and i do not ask for ani particular splendour my onli
ambit ar to find those whom i have lost and in whatev life
i live to be of us to other howev as i gather that the exalt
condit to which jorsen allud is thousand of ag off for ani of
us and mai after all mean someth quit differ to what it seem to
mean the thought of it doe not troubl me over much meanwhil what i
seek is the vision of those i love
now i have thi power occasion when i am in deep sleep some part of
me seem to leav my bodi and to be transport quit outsid the world
it travel as though i were alreadi dead to the gate that all who
live must pass and there take it stand on the great white road
watch those who have been call speed by continu those upon the
earth know noth of that road blind by their pomp and vaniti
thei cannot see thei will not see it alwai grow toward the feet of
everi on of them but i see and know of cours you who read will sai
that thi is but a dream of mine and it mai be still if so it is a
veri wonder dream and except for the chang of the pass peopl
or rather of those who have been peopl alwai veri much the same
there straight as the wai of the spirit and broad as the breast of
death is the great white road run i know not whenc up to those
gate that gleam like moonlight and ar higher than the alp there
beyond the gate the radiant presenc move mysteri thenc at the
appoint time the voic cri and thei ar open with a sound like to
that of deepest thunder or sometim ar burn awai while from the
glori that li beyond flow the sweetfac welcom to greet those for
whom thei wait bear the cup from which thei give to drink i do
not know what is in the cup whether it be a draught of leth or
some baptism water of new birth or both but alwai the thirst
worldworn soul appear to chang and then as it were to be lost in the
presenc that gave the cup at least thei ar lost to my sight i see
them no more
why do i watch those gate in truth or in dream befor my time oh
you can guess that perchanc i mai behold those for whom my heart burn
with a quenchless eat fire and onc i beheldnot the mother but
the child my child chang inde mysteri wonder gleam
like a star with ey so deep that in their depth my human seem
to swoon
she came forward she knew me she smile and laid her finger on her
lip she shook her hair about her and in it vanish as in a cloud yet
as she vanish a voic spoke in my heart her voic and the word it
said were
wait our belov wait
mark well our belov not my belov so there ar other by whom
i am belov or at least on other and i know well who that on must
be
after thi dream perhap i had better call it a dream i wa ill for a
long while for the joi and the glori of it overpow me and brought
me near to the death i had alwai sought but i recov for my hour
is not yet moreov for a long while as we reckon time some year
inde i obei the injunct and sought the great white road no more
at length the long grew too strong for me and i return thither but
never again did the vision come it word wa spoken it mission wa
fulfil yet from time to time i a mortal seem to stand upon the
border of that immort road and watch the newli dead who travel it
toward the gloriou gate
onc or twice there have been among them peopl whom i have known as
these pass me i appear to have the power of look into their heart
and there i read strang thing sometim thei ar beauti thing and
sometim ugli thing thu i have learn that those i thought bad were
realli good in the main for who can claim to be quit good and on the
other hand that those i believ to be as honest as the daywel had
their fault
to take an exampl which i quot becaus it is so absurd the room i
live in were own by a prim old woman who for more than twenti year
wa my landladi she and i were great friend inde she tend me like
a mother and when i wa so ill nurs me as perhap few mother would
have done yet while i wa watch on the road suddenli she came by
and with horror i saw that dure all those year she had been rob
me take i am sorri to sai mani thing in monei trinket and
food often i had discuss with her where these articl could possibl
have gone till final suspicion settl upon the man who clean the
window ye and worst of all he wa prosecut and i gave evid
against him or rather strengthen her evid on faith of which the
magistr sent him to prison for a month
oh mr smither i said to her how could you do it mr
smither
she stop and look about her terrifi so that my heart smote me
and i ad in hast dont be frighten mr smither i forgiv
you
i cant see you sir she exclaim or so i dream but there i
alwai knew you would
ye mr smither i repli but how about the windowclean who
went to jail and lost hi situat
then she pass on or wa drawn awai without make ani answer
now come the odd part of the stori when i woke up on the follow
morn in my room it wa to be inform by the frighten
maidofallwork that mr smither had been found dead in her bed
moreov a few dai later i learn from a lawyer that she had made
a will leav me everyth she possess includ the leas of her
hous and nearli 1000 for she had been a save old person dure all
her long life
well i sought out that windowclean and compens him handsom
sai that i had found i wa mistaken in the evid i gave against
him the rest of the properti i kept and i hope that it wa not wrong
of me to do so it will be rememb that some of it wa alreadi my
own temporarili divert into anoth channel and for the rest i have
so mani to help to be frank i do not spend much upon myself
the hare
now i have done with myself or rather with my own insignific present
histori and come to that of the hare it impress me a good deal at
the time which is not long ago so much inde that i commun the
fact to jorsen he order me to publish them and what jorsen order
must be done i dont know why thi should be but it is so he ha
author of a sort that i am unabl to defin
on night after the usual aspir and concentr of mind which
by the wai ar not alwai success i pass into what occultist call
spirit and other a state of dream at ani rate i found myself upon
the border of the great white road as near to the mighti gate as i am
ever allow to come how far that mai be awai i cannot tell perhap it
is but a few yard and perhap it is the width of thi great world for
in that place which my spirit visit time and distanc do not exist
there all thing ar new and strang not to be reckon by our
measur there the sight is not our sight nor the hear our hear
i repeat that all thing ar differ but that differ i cannot
describ and if i could it would prove past comprehens
there i sat by the border of the great white road my ey fix upon
the gate abov which the tower mount for mile on mile outlin
against an encircl gloom with the radianc of the world beyond the
world foursquar thei stand those tower and fourfold the gate
that open to the denizen of other earth but of these i have no
knowledg beyond the fact that it is so in my vision
i sat upon the border of the road my ey fix in hope upon the
gate though well i knew that the hope would never be fulfil and
watch the dead go by
thei were mani that night some plagu wa work in the east and
unchain thousand the folk that it loos were strang to me who in
thi particular life have seldom left england and i studi them with
curios highfeatur darkhu peopl with a patient air the
knowledg which i have told me that on and all thei were veri ancient
soul who often and often had walk thi road befor and therefor
although as yet thei did not know it were well accustom to the
journei no i am wrong for here and there an individu did know
inde on deepei wist littl woman who carri a babi in her
arm stop for a moment and spoke to me
the other cannot see you as i do she said priest of the queen of
queen i know you well hand in hand we climb by the seven stairwai
to the altar of the moon
who is the queen of queen i ask
have you forgotten her of the hundr name whose veil we lift on
by on her whose breast wa beauti and whose ey were truth in a dai
to come you will rememb farewel till we walk thi road no more
staywhen did we meet
when our soul were young she answer and fade from my ken like a
shadow from the sea
after the eastern came mani other from all part of the earth then
suddenli appear a compani of about six hundr folk of everi ag and
english in their look thei were not so calm as ar the major of
those who make thi journei when i read the paper a few dai later i
understood why a great passeng ship had sunk suddenli in mid ocean
and thei were all cut off unprepar
when follow by a few straggler these had pass and gather
themselv in the red shadow beneath the gatewai tower wait for the
summon an unusu thing occur for a few moment the road wa left
quit empti after that last great stroke death seem to be rest on
hi laurel when thu unpeopl it look a veri vast place like to a
huge arch causewai border on either side by black but itself
gleam with a curiou phosphoresc such as onc or twice i have
seen in the water of a summer sea at night
present in the veri centr of thi illumin desol whilst it
wa as yet far awai someth caught my ey someth so strang to
the place so utterli unfamiliar that i watch it earnestli wonder
what it might be nearer and nearer it came with curiou uncertain
hop ye a littl brown object that hop
well i said to myself if i were not where i am i should sai that
yonder thing wa a hare onli what would a hare be do on the great
white road how could a hare tread the pathwai of etern soul i must
be mistaken
so i reflect whilst still the thing hop on until i becam certain
that either i suffer from delus or that it wa a hare inde a
particularli fine hare much such a on as a friend of my old landladi
mr smither had onc sent her as a christma present from norfolk
which hare i at
a few more hop brought it opposit to my post of observ here it
halt as though it seem to see me at ani rate it sat up in the alert
fashion that hare have it forepaw hang absurdli in front of it
with on ear on which there wa a grei blotch cock and on drag
and snif with it funni littl nostril then it began to talk to me
i do not mean that it realli talk but the thought which were in it
mind were flash on to my mind so that i understood perfectli ye and
could answer them in the same fashion it said or thought thu
you ar real you ar a man who yet live beneath the sun though how
you came here i do not know i hate men all hare do for men ar cruel
to them still it is a comfort in thi strang place to see someth
on ha seen befor and to be abl to talk even to a man which i could
never do until the chang came the dread changei mean becaus of
the wai of it and it seem to shiver mai i ask you some question
certainli i said or rather thought back
you ar sure that thei wont make you angri so that you hurt me
i cant hurt you even if i wish to do so you ar not a hare ani
longer if you ever were on but onli the shadow of a hare
ah i thought as much and that a good thing anyhow tell me man
have you ever been torn to piec by dog
good graciou no
or cours or hunt or caught in a trap or shot all over your back
or twist up in net and choke in snare or have you swum out to sea
to die more easili or seen your mate and mother and father kill
no no pleas stop hare your question ar veri unpleas
not half so unpleas as the thing ar themselv i can assur
you man i will tell you my stori if you like then you can judg for
yourself but first if you will do you tell me why i am here have you
seen more hare about thi place
never nor ani other anim no i am wrong onc i saw a dog
the hare look about it anxious
a dog how horribl what wa it do hunt if there ar no hare
here what could it be hunt a rabbit or a pheasant with a broken
wing or perhap a fox i should not mind so much if it were a fox i
hate fox thei catch young hare when thei ar asleep and eat them
none of these thing i wa told that it belong to a littl girl who
di that broke it heart so that it di also when thei shut her up
in a box therefor it wa allow to accompani her here becaus it had
love so much inde i saw them togeth both veri happi and togeth
thei went through those gate
if dog love littl girl why dont thei love hare at least as
anyth like to be love for the dog didnt want to eat the littl
girl did it i see you cant answer me now would you like me to tell
you my stori someth insid of me is sai that i am to do so if you
will listen also that there is plenti of time for i am not want at
present and when i am i can run to those gate much quicker than you
could
i should like it veri much hare onc a prophet heard an ass speak in
order to warn him but sinc then except veri veri rare in dream
no creatur ha talk to a man so far as i know perhap you wish
to warn me about someth or other through me as the ass warn
balaam
who is balaam i never heard of balaam he wasnt the man who fetch
dead pheasant in the donkeycart wa he if so iv seen him make the
ass talkwith a thick stick no well never mind i daresai i should
not understand about him if you told me now for my stori
then the hare sat itself down plant it forepaw firmli in front of
it as these anim do when thei ar on the watch look up at me and
began to pour the content of it mind into mine
i wa born it said or rather told me by thought transfer in a
field of grow corn near to a big wood at least i suppos i wa born
there though the first thing i rememb is plai about in the wheat
with two other littl on of my own size a brother and a sister that
were born with me it wa at night for a great round shine thing
which i now know wa the moon hung in the sky abov us we gambol
togeth and were veri happi till present my mother camei rememb
how big she lookedand cuf me with her paw becaus i had led the
other awai from the place where she had told us to stop and given her
a great hunt to find us that is the first thing i rememb about my
mother afterward she seem sorri becaus she had hurt me and nurs

young hare or it mai have been a rabbit had got entangl in it and
on of the men wa beat it to death with a stick i rememb that the
sound of it scream made me feel cold down the back for i had never

squeez through but not quit
the sun went down and the big sherabbit came out
now i am go to eat you it said as i at all the other i am

forefeet try to hold me but too late for i wa through leav

length i found my mother in the rough pastur by the wood and told her
everyth
ah she said that what come of greedi and of try to be too
clever now perhap you will learn to stop at home
so i did for a long while
the summer went by without anyth particular happen except that my
brother with the lame foot wa eaten by the mother fox that great red
beast wa alwai prowl about and at night surpris us in a field
near the wood where we were feed on some beauti turnip the rest
of us got awai but my brother be lame wa not quick enough the fox
caught him and i heard her sharp white teeth crunch into hi bone
the sound made me quit sick and my mother wa veri sad afterward she
complain to my father of the cruelti of fox but he who as i have
said wa a philosoph answer her almost in her own word
fox must live and thi on ha young to feed and therefor is
alwai hungri there ar three of them in a hole at the top of the
wood he remark also our son wa lame and would certainli have been
caught when the hunt begin
what the hunt i ask
never mind said my father sharpli no doubt youll find out in time
that is if you live through the shoot
what the shoot i began but my father cuf me over the head
and i wa silent
i mai tell you that my mother soon got over the loss of my brother for
just about that time she had four new littl on after which neither
she nor my father seem to think ani more about us my sister and
i hate those littl on we two alon rememb my brother and
sometim wonder whether he wa quit gone or would on dai come back
the fox i am glad to sai got caught in a trap at least i am not glad
nowi wa glad becaus you see i wa so much afraid of her
the shoot
i wa quit close by on morn when the fox who wa smell about
after me i suppos becaus it had like my brother so much got caught
in the big trap which wa cover over artfulli with earth and bait
with some stuff which stank horribl i rememb it look veri like my
own hindleg the fox not be abl to find me went to thi filth
and tri to eat it
then suddenli there wa a dread fuss the fox yelp and flew into
the air i saw that a great black thing wa fast on it forepaw how
that fox did jump and roll it wa quit wonder to see her she
look like a great yellow ball except for a lot of white mark about
the head which were her teeth but the trap would not come awai
becaus it wa ti to a root with a chain
at last the fox grew tire and ly down began to think lick it
paw as it thought and make a kind of moan nois next it commenc
gnaw at the root after try the chain and find that it teeth
would not go into it while it wa do thi i heard the sound of a man
somewher in the wood so did the fox and oh it look so frighten
it lai down pant it tongu hang out and it ear press back
against it head and whisk it big tail from side to side then it
began to gnaw again but thi time at it own leg it want to bite it
off and so get awai i thought thi veri brave of the fox and though
i hate it becaus it had eaten my brother and tri to eat me i felt
quit sorri
it wa about half through it leg when the man came i rememb that he
had a cat with a littl red collar on it neck and an owl in hi hand
both of them dead for he wa gile the headkeep go round hi
trap he wa a tall man with sandi whisker and a rough voic and he
carri a singlebarrel gun under hi arm
you see now that i am dead i know the us of these thing just as i
understand all that wa said though of cours at the time it had no
mean for me still i find that i have forgotten noth not on word
from the begin of my life to the end
the keeper who wa on hi wai to the place where he nail the
creatur he did not like by dozen upon pole look down and saw the
fox oh my beauti he said so i have got you at last dont you
think yourself clever try to bite off that leg youd have done it
too onli i came along just in time well good night old girl you
wont have no more of my pheasant
then he lift the gun there wa a most dread nois and the fox
roll over and lai still
there you ar all neat and tidi my dear said the keeper now i
must just tuck you awai in the hollow tree befor old grampu sneak
round and see you for if he should it will be almost as much as my
place is worth
next he set hi foot on the trap and open it took hold of the fox
by the foreleg to carri it off the cat and the owl he stuf awai
into a great pocket in hi coat
jemima dont you wholli stink he said then gave a most aw yell
the fox wasnt quit dead after all it wa onli sham dead at ani
rate it got gile hand in it mouth and made it teeth meet through the
flesh
now the keeper began to jump about just as the fox had done when it
set it paw in the trap shout and sai all sort of thing that
somehow i dont think i ought to repeat here round and round he
went with the fox hang to hi hand like hare do when thei danc
togeth for he couldnt get it off anyhow at last he tumbl down
into a pool of mud and water and when he got up again all wet through i
saw that the fox wa realli dead but it had di bite and now i know
that thi pleas it veri much
it wa just then that the man whom the keeper had call grampu came
up he wa a big fat man with a veri red face who made a kind of
blow nois when he walk fast i know now that he wa the lord of
all the other men about that place that he live in the hous which
look over the sea and that the boi and girl who put me in with the
yellowtooth rabbit were hi children he wa what the farmer call
a firstrat allround sportsman which mean my friendbut what is
your name
oh mahatma i answer at hazard
which mean my friend mahatma that he spent most of the year in
kill the lower anim such as me ye he spent quit eight month
out of the twelv in kill us on wai and anoth for when there wa
no more kill to be done in hi own countri he would travel to other
and kill there he would even kill pigeon from a trap or young rook
just out of their nest or rat in a stack or sparrow among
ivi rather than not kill anyth iv heard gile sai so to the
underkeep and call him a regular slaughter and a trueblood
englishman
yet my friend mahatma i sai in the light of the truth which ha come
to me that accord to hi knowledg grampu wa a good man thu
what littl time he had to spare from sport he pass in help hi
brother men by send them to prison although of cours he never
work or earn anyth he wa veri rich becaus monei flow to him
from other peopl who had been veri rich but who at last were forc
to travel thi road and could not bring it with them if thei could have
brought it i am sure that grampu would never have got ani howev he
did get it and he aid a great mani peopl with that part of it which
he found he could not spend upon himself he wa a veri good man onli
he like kill us lower creatur whom he bred up with hi monei to
be kill

at length after gile had beaten nigger till he broke a stick over
him make him howl terribl order wa restor and the line have
reform began to march down on me for mahatma i wa so frighten
by what had happen to my father and i think my mother that i didnt
rememb what he i mean my dead father had told me alwai to run awai
when there is a chanc as poor hare can onli protect themselv by
flight
so as i had lost the chanc i thought that i would just sit tight
hope that thei would not see me nor inde would thei if it hadnt
been for that horribl tom
dure the confus the mother partridg which the redfac man had
shot had been forgotten by everybodi except tom tom you see wa
certain that he had shot it himself be a veri obstin boi and wa
determin to retriev it as hi own
now that partridg had fallen within a yard of me with it beak and
claw point to the sky and when the line had pass where we lai tom
lag behind to look for it he did not find it then whether he ever
found it afterward i am sure i dont know but he found me
by jove here a hare he said and made a grab at me just as he had
done in the furz bush
well i went tom shot when i wasnt more than four yard from him and
the whole charg pass like a bullet between my hind leg and struck
the ground under my stomach send up such a shower of earth and
stone that i wa knock right over
iv hit it yell tom as he cram anoth cartridg into hi

were broken and didnt everybodi els roar and shout and didnt i
danc off i went right over the fat boi who had tumbl down up
to the end of the field then so bewild wa i with shock and the
burn pain back again quit close to them
but now nobodi shot at me becaus thei all thought the boi wa kill
and were gather round him look veri solemn onli i saw that the
redfac man had tom by the neck and wa kick him hard
after that i saw no more for i ran five mile befor i stop and at
last lai down in a littl swamp near the seashor to which my mother had
onc taken me my back wa burn like fire and i tri to cool it in
the soft slush

thought that i wa go to die for although luckili none of my bone
were broken the pain in my back wa dread when i tri to eas the
agoni by rub against root it onli becam wors for the fur fell
off leav sore upon which fli settl i could scarc eat or
sleep and grew so thin that the bone nearli poke through my pelt
inde i want veri much to die but could not on the contrari by
degre i recov till at last i wa quit strong again and like
other hare except for the six littl grei tuft upon my back and on
hole through my right ear
now all thi while i had live in the swamp near the sea but when my
strength return i thought of my old home to which someth seem
to draw me also there were no turnip near the swamp and as the winter
came on i found veri littl to eat there so on dai or rather on
night i travel back home
as it happen the first hare that i met near the big wood wa my
sister she wa veri glad to see me although she had forgotten how we
came to part and when i spoke of our father and mother these did not
seem to interest her still from that time forward we live togeth
more or less till her end came
on daythi wa after we had made our home in the big wood as hare
often do in winterther wa a great disturb when we tri to go
out to feed at daylight we found littl fire burn everywher and
near to them boi who beat themselv and shout so we went back into
the wood where the pheasant were run to and fro in a great state
of mind
some hour later when the sun wa quit high men began to march
about and score of shot were fire a long wai off also a wound
cockpheas fell near to us and flutter awai make a queer nois
in it throat it look veri funni stumbl along on on leg with it
beak gape and two of the long feather in it tail broken
i know what thi is i said to my sister let be gone befor thei
shoot us iv had enough of be shot
so off we went rush past a boi by hi fire who yell and threw a
stick at us but as it happen on the border of the properti of the
redfac man there were poacher who knew that hare would come out
of the wood on thi dai of the shoot and had made readi for us by
set wire noos in the gap of the hedg through which we ran i
got my foot into on of these but manag to shake it off my sister
wa not so lucki for her head went into anoth of them she kick and
tore but the more she struggl the tighter drew the noos
i watch her for a littl while until on of the poacher ran up with a
stick
then i went awai as i could not bear to see her beaten to death and
that wa the end of my sister so now i wa the onli on left aliv of
our famili except perhap some younger brother whom i did not know
though i think it wa on of these that afterward i saw shot quit dead
by gile he went over and over and lai as still as though he had never
move in all hi life death seem a veri wonder thing mahatma but
i wont ask you what it is becaus i perceiv that you cant answer
after thi noth happen to me for a long while inde i had the
best time of my life and grew veri strong and big ye the strongest
and biggest hare of ani that i ever saw also the swiftest of foot
twice i wa chase by dog onc by giless black beast nigger and
onc by that of a shepherd find that i could run right awai from
them without exert myself at all i grew to despis dog ah littl
did i know then that there ar mani differ breed of these anim
on dai in midwint as the weather wa veri mild and open i wa
ly on the rough grass field that i have spoken of which border a
flat stretch of moorland on thi moorland in summer grew tall fern
but now these had di and been broken down by the wind suddenli i woke
up from my sleep to see a number of men walk and ride toward me
thei were tenant and other who although the real cours season had
not yet begun in our neighbourhood had been ask by grampu to come
to try their greyhound upon hi land those of them who walk for the
most part held two long lean dog on a string while on or two carri
dead hare thei were dreadfullook hare that seem to have been
bitten all over at least their coat were wet and broken i shiver at
the sight of them feel sure that i wa go to be put to some new
kind of tortur
besid the men on foot were those on horseback among whom i recognis
the redfac man and my enemi the dread tom most of the other
were peopl call farmer who seem veri happi and excit and from
time to time drank someth out of littl bottl which thei pass
to each other gile wa not there now i know that thi wa becaus he
hate cours which kill down hare hare he thought out to be
shot not cours
whilst i watch wonder what to do there wa a shout of there she
goe and all the long dog began to pull at their string off the
neck of two of them the collar seem to fall and awai thei leapt
pursu a hare the men on the hors gallop after them but the men
on foot remain where thei were
now i wa afraid to get up and run lest thei should loos the other dog
on me so i lai still till present i saw the hare come back toward
me follow by the two dog whose nose almost touch it tail it wa
exhaust and tri to twist and spring awai to the right but as it did
so on of the dog caught it in it mouth and bit it till it di
that wa a rotten hare said tom who canter up just then it gave
no cours at all
ye puf grampu hope the next on will show better sport
hope so too answer tom especi as it is jack and jill turn
to be slip and thei ar the best greyhound for twenti mile round
then the redfac man gave some order and jack and jill were brought
forward by the man whose busi it wa to slip the dog on of them
wa black and on yellow i think jack wa the black onea dread
sneakinglook beast with a white tip to it tail which end in a
sort of curl
forward now said grampu and go slow there sure to be anoth
puss or two in thi rough grass
next second i wa up and awai and befor you could count twelv jack
and jill were after me i saw them stand on their hind leg strain
at the cord then the collar fell from them and thei leapt forward like
the light my thought wa to get back to the wood which wa about
a minut run behind me but i did not dare to turn and head for it
becaus of the long line of peopl through which i must pass if i tri
to do so so i ran straight for the moorland hope to turn there and
reach the wood on it other side although thi meant a long journei
for a while all went well with me and have a good start i began to
hope that i should outrun these beast as i had the shepherd dog and
the retriev but i did not know jack and jill just as i reach the
border of the moor i heard the patter of their feet behind me and
look back saw them come up about as far awai as i wa from tom
when he shot me
thei were run quit close togeth and behind them gallop the
judg and other men there wa a fenc here and i bolt through a hole
in it the greyhound jump over and for a moment lost sight of me for
i had turn and run down near the side of the fenc but tom who had
come through a gap saw me and wave hi arm shout and next instant
jack and jill saw me too
then as the go wa rough by the fenc i took to the open moor alwai
try howev to work round to the left in the hope that i might win
the shelter of the wood
on we went like the wind and now jack and jill were quit close behind
me though befor thei got there i had manag to circl so that at last
my head point to the wood which wa more than half a mile awai their
speed wa greater than mine and i knew that i must soon be caught
at last thei were not more than two yard behind and for the first time
i twist so that thei overshot me which gave me anoth start three
time thei came up and three time i wrench or twist the wood wa
not so far awai now but i wa almost spent
what wa i to do what wa i to do i saw a clump of furz to the
left a big clump and thick and rememb that there wa a hare run
through it i reach it just as jill wa on the top of me and onc
more thei lost sight of me for a while as thei ran round the clump
stare and jump when thei saw me again on the further side i wa
thirti yard ahead of them and the wood wa perhap two hundr and
fifti yard awai but now i could onli run more slowli for my heart
seem to be burst though luckili jack and jill were get tire
also still thei soon came up and now i must twist everi few yard or
be caught in their jaw
i cant tell you what i felt mahatma and until you have been hunt by
greyhound you will never know it wa horribl yet i manag to twist
and jump so that alwai jack and jill just miss me the farmer on the
hors laugh to see my desper leap and wrench
but tom did wors than laugh note that i wa get quit near the
wood he rode between me and it try to turn me into the open for he
wish to see me kill
dont do that it isnt sportsmanlik shout the redfac man
give the poor beast a chanc
i dont know whether he obei or not as just then i made my last
doubl and felt jill teeth cut through the fur of my scut and heard
them snap i had dodg jill but jack wa right on to me and the wood
still twenti yard awai
i could not twist ani more it wa just which of us could get there
first i gather all my remain strength for i wa mad mad with
terror and bound forward
after me came jack i felt hi hot breath on my flank i jump the
ditch ye i found power to jump that ditch where there wa a rabbit
run just by the trunk of a young oak jack jump after me we must both
have been in the air at the same time but i got through the rabbit run
wherea jack hit hi sharp nose against the trunk of the tree and broke
hi neck ye he fell dead into the ditch
i crawl on a few yard to a thick clump and squat down for i could
not stir anoth inch so it came about that i heard them all talk on
the other side
on of them said i wa the finest hare he had ever cours other who
had drag jack out of the ditch lament hi death especi the
owner who vow that he wa worth 50 and abus tom tom he said had
caus him to be killedi dont know how but i suppos becaus he had
ridden forward and tri to turn me the redfac man also scold tom
then he ad
well i am glad she got off for shell give us a good run with the
harrier on dai i shall alwai know that hare again by the white mark
on it back also it is the biggest i have seen for a long while come
on my friend the dog is dead and there an end of it at least we
have had a good morn sport so let go to the hall and get some
lunch
the hare paus for a littl then look up at me in it comic
fashion and ask
did you ever cours hare mahatma
not i thank good i answer
well what do you think of cours
i would rather not sai i repli
then i will said the hare with convict i think it horribl
ye but hare you do not rememb the pleasur thi sport give to
the men and the dog you look at it from an entir selfish point of
view
and so would you mahatma if you had felt jack hot breath on your
back and jill teeth in your tail
the hunt
the hare sat silent for a time while i emploi myself in watch
certain shadow stream past us on the great white road among them wa
that of a politician whom i had much admir upon the earth in thi
land of truth i wa griev to observ certain characterist about him
which i had never befor suspect it seem to me ala that in
hi mundan career he had not been so entir influenc by a
singleheart desir for the welfar of our countri as he had
proclaim and i had believ i gather even that hi own interest
had sometim inspir hi polici
he went by leav so far as i wa concern a somewhat pain
impress from which i sought relief in the compani of the opensoul
hare
well i said i suppos that you di of exhaust after your
cours experi and came on here
di of exhaust mahatma not a bit of it in three dai i wa as
well as ever onli much more cun than i had been befor in the
night i fed in the field upon whatev i could get but in the daytim
i alwai lai up in wood thi i did becaus i found out the shoot
wa over and i knew that greyhound which run by sight would never
come into wood
the week went by and the dai began to lengthen pretti yellow flower
that i had not seen befor appear in the wood and i at plenti of
them thei have a nice flavour then i met anoth hare and love her
becaus she remind me of my sister we us to plai about togeth and
were veri happi i wonder what she will do now that i am gone
consol herself with somebodi els i suggest sarcast
no she wont do that mahatma becaus the hound chop her just
outsid the round plantat i mean thei caught and at her you think
that i am contradict myself but i am not i mean i wonder what she
will do without me in whatev world she ha reach for i dont see
her here well i went to the littl round plantat becaus i found
that gile seldom came there and i thought it would be safer but as it
prove i made a great mistak on dai there appear the redfac man
and tom and the girl ella and a lot of other peopl mount on hors
some of them dress in green coat with ridiculouslook cap on
their head
also with them were i dont know how mani spot dog whose tail
curl over their back not like greyhound whose tail curl between
their leg outsid of the plantat those dog caught and at my
futur wife as i have said it wa her own fault for i had warn her
not to go there but she wa a veri selfwil charact as it wa
she never even gave them a run for thei were all round her in a minut
then thei made a kind of cartwheel their head were in the centr of
thi cartwheel and their tail point out in it exact middl wa my
futur wife
when the wheel broke up there wa noth of her left except her scut
which lai upon the ground
i had seen so mani of such thing that i wa not so much shock as
you might suppos after all a fine hare like myself could alwai get
anoth wife and as i have told you she wa veri selfwil
so i lai still think that those men and dog would go awai
but what do you think mahatma just as thei were go the boi tom
call out
i sai dad i think we might as well knock through the round
plantat gile tell me that the old speckleback buck li up
here
doe he said grampu well if so that the hare i want to
see for i know hed give us a good run here jerri jerri wa the
huntsman just put the hound into that place
so jerri put the hound in make dread nois to encourag them
and of cours i came out as i did not wish to share the fate of my
futur wife
that him screech tom look at the grei mark on hi back
ye that he right enough shout the redfac man lai them on
jerri lai them on were in for a rattl run now ill warrant
so thei were laid on and i went awai as hard as my leg would carri me
veri soon i found that i had left all those curlytail dog a long wai
behind
ah i said to myself proudli these beast ar not greyhound thei
ar like giless retriev and the sheep dog theyll never see me
again so i loop along save my breath and head for a wood which
wa quit five mile off that i had onc visit from the marsh on the
seashor where i lai sick for i wa sure thei would never follow me
there
you can imagin then mahatma how surpris i wa when i drew near
that wood to hear a hideou nois of dog all bark togeth behind
me and on look back to see those spot brute with their tongu
hang out come along quit close to each other and not more than a
quarter of a mile awai
moreov thei were come after me i wa sure of that for the first of
them kept set it nose to the ground just where i had run and then
lift up it head to bai ye thei were come on my scent thei
could smell me as giless curli dog smell the wound partridg my
heart sank at the thought but present i rememb that the wood wa
quit close and that there i should certainli give them the slip
so i went on quit cheerfulli not even run as fast as i could but
fortun wa against me as everyth ha alwai been for i never found
a friend i ran along the side of a hedgerow which went quit up to
the wood not know that at the end of it three men were engag in
cut down an oak tree you see mahatma thei had caught sight of the
hunt and stop from their work so that i did not hear the sound of
their ax upon the tree nor as my head wa so near the ground did i
see them until i wa right on to them at which moment also thei saw me
here she is yell on of them keep her out of covert or theyll
lose her and he threw out hi arm and began to jump about as did the
other two
i pull up short within three or four yard of them behind were the
dog and the peopl gallop upon hors and in front were the three
men what wa i to do now i had stop exactli in a gatewai for a
lane ran alongsid the wood after a moment paus i bolt through the
gatewai think that i would get into the wood beyond but on of the
men who of cours want to see me kill wa too quick for me and
there head me again
then i lost my sens instead of run on past him and leap into
the wood i swung right round and rush back still cling to the
hedgerow inde as i went down on side of it the hound and the
hunter came up on the other so that there were onli a few stick
between us though fortun the wind wa blow from them to me
fear lest thei should see me i jump into the ditch and ran for
quit two hundr yard through the mud and water that wa gather
there then i had to come out of it again as it end but here wa a
fall in the ground so still i wa not seen
meanwhil the hunt had reach the three men and i heard them all
talk togeth the end of it wa that the men explain which wai i
had gone and onc more the hound were laid on to me in a minut thei
got to where i had enter the ditch and there grew confus becaus my
footmark did not smell in the water for quit a long time thei look
about till at length take a wide cast the hound found my smell
again at the end of the ditch
dure thi check i wa make the best of my wai back toward my own
home inde had it not been for it i should have been caught and torn
to piec much sooner than i wa thu it happen that i had cover
quit three mile befor onc more i heard those hound bai behind
me thi wa just as i got on to the moorland at that edg of it which
is about anoth three mile from the great hous call the hall which
stand on the top of a cliff that slope down to the beach and the sea
i had thought of make for the other wood that in which i had save
myself from the greyhound when the beast jack broke it neck against
the tree but it wa too far off and the ground wa so open that i did
not dare to try
so i went straight on head toward the cliff anoth mile and
thei view me for i heard tom yell with delight as he stood up in hi
stirrup on the black cob he wa ride and wave hi cap jerri the
huntsman also stood up in hi stirrup and wave hi cap and the last
aw hunt began
i ranoh how i ran onc when thei were nearli on me i manag to
check them for a minut in a hollow by get among some sheep but
thei soon found me again and came after me at full tear not more than
a hundr yard behind in front of me i saw someth that look
like wall and bound toward them with my last strength my heart wa
burst my ey and mouth seem to be full of blood but the terror
of be torn to piec still gave me power to rush on almost as quickli
as though i had just been put off my form for as i have told you
mahatma i am or rather wa a veri strong and swift hare
i reach the wall there wa an open doorwai in them through which i
fled to find myself in a big garden two garden saw me and shout
loudli i flew on through some other door through a yard and into a
passag where i met a woman carri a pail who shriek and fell on
to her back i jump over her and got into a big room where wa a
long tabl cover with white on which were all sort of thing that i
suppos men eat out of that room i went into yet anoth where a fat
woman with a hook nose wa seat hold someth white in front of
her i bolt under the thing on which she wa seat and lai there
she saw me come and began to shriek also and present a most terribl
nois aros outsid
all the spot dog were in the hous bai and bark and
everybodi wa yell then for a minut the dog stop their clamour
and i heard a great clatter of thing break and of teeth crunch
and of the redfac man shout
those curs brute ar eat the hunt lunch get them out jerri you
idiot get them out great heaven what the matter with her ladyship
is ani on murder her
i suppos that thei couldnt get them out or at least when thei did
thei all came into the other room where i wa under the seat on which
the fat woman wa now stand
what is it mother i heard tom sai
an anim she scream an anim under the sofa
all right he said that onli the hare here hound out with her
hound
the dog rush about some of them with great lump of food still
in their mouth but thei were confus and all went into the wrong
place everyth began to fall with dread crash the fat woman
shriek piercingli and her shriek wa
china oh my chinaa john you wretch help help help
to which the redfac man roar in answer
dont be an infern fool elizaa i sai dont be such an infern
fool
also there were lot of other nois that i cannot rememb except on
which a dog made
thi silli dog had thrust it head up the hole over a fire such as the
stop make outsid the covert when men ar go to shoot either to
hide someth or to look for me there when it came down again becaus
the redfac man kick it the dog put it paw into the fire and
pull it all out over the floor also it howl veri beautifulli just
then anoth hound that on which gener led the pack began to
sniff about near me and final poke it nose under the stuff which hid
me
it jump back and bai whereon i jump out the other side tom made
a rush at me and knock the fat woman off the thing she wa stand
on so that she fell among the dog which cover her up and began to
sniff her all over fly from tom i found myself in front of someth
filmi beyond which i saw grass it look suspici but as noth in
the world could be so bad as tom no not even hi dog i jump at it
there wa a crash and a sharp point cut my nose but i wa out upon the
grass then there were twenti other crash and all the hound were out
too for tom had cheer them on i ran to the edg of the lawn and saw
a steep slope lead to the sand and the sea now i knew what the
sea wa for after tom had shot me in the back i live by it for a long
while and onc swam across a littl creek to get to my form from which
it cut me off
while i ran down that slope fast as my ach leg would carri me i
made up my mind that i would swim out into the sea and drown there
sinc it is better to drown than to be torn to piec but why ar you
laugh friend mahatma
i am not laugh i said in thi state without a bodi i have
noth to laugh with still you ar right for you see that i should be
laugh if i could your stori of the stout ladi and the dog and the
china is veri amus

is go to be eaten aliv
of cours it isnt i answer pleas forgiv me and go on
well i tumbl down that cliff follow by some of the dog and tom
and the girl ella and the huntsman jerri on foot and drag myself
across the sand till i came to the lip of the sea
just here there wa a boat and by it stood gile the keeper he had come
there to get out of the wai of the hunt which he hate as much as he
did the cours the sight of him settl meinto the sea i went the
dog want to follow me but jerri call and whip them off

we must have her for the hound come on ella
best leav her alon master tom said gile i think she an
unlucki on that i do
still the end of it wa that he help to float the littl boat and got
into it with tom and ella
just after thei had push off i saw a man run down the step on
the cliff wave hi arm while he call out someth but of him thei
took no heed i do not think thei notic him as for me i swam on
i could not go veri fast becaus i wa so dreadfulli tire also i did
not like swim and the cold wave broke over my head make the cut
in my nose smart and fill my ey with someth that stung them
i could not see far either nor did i know where i wa go i knew
noth except i wa about to die and that soon everyth would be at
an end men dogseveryth ye even tom i want thing to come
to an end i had suffer so dreadfulli life wa so horribl i wa so
veri tire i felt that it wa better to die and have done
so i swam on a long wai and began to forget thing inde i thought
that i wa plai in the big turnip field with my mother and sister
but just as i wa sink exhaust a hand shot down into the water and
caught me by the ear although from below the finger look as though
thei were bend awai from me i saw it come and tri to sink more

but he wa mad to see me bitten to death and eaten and until he had
done so would attend to no on he onli shout onetwothre now
hound worri worri worri
then he threw me into the air abov the red throat and gnash teeth
which leapt up toward me
the hare paus but ad did you tell me friend mahatma that you
had never been torn to piec by hound broken up i believ thei
call it
ye i did i answer and what is more i shall be oblig if you
will not dwell upon the subject
the come of the redfac man
as you like said the hare certainli it wa veri dread it seem
to last a long time but i dont mind it so much now for i feel that it
can never happen to me again at least i hope it cant for i dont know
what i have done to deserv such a fate ani more than i know why it
should have happen to me onc
someth you did in a previou exist perhap i answer you
see then you mai have hunt other creatur so cruelli that at last
your turn came to suffer what you had made them suffer i often think
that becaus of what we have done befor we men ar also realli be
hunt by someth we cannot see
ah exclaim the hare i never thought of that i hope it is true
for it make thing seem juster and less wick but i sai friend
mahatma what am i do here now where you tell me poor creatur with
four feet never or hardli ever come
i dont know hare i am not wise to whom it is onli grant to visit
the road occasion to search for some on
i understand mahatma but still you must know a great deal or you
would not be allow in such a place befor your time or at ani rate
you must be abl to guess a great deal so tell me why do you think
that i am here
i cant sai hare i cant inde perhap after the gate ar open and
your guardian ha given you to drink of the cup you will go to sleep
and wake up again as someth els
to drink of the cup mahatma i dont drink at least i didnt though
i cant tell what mai happen here but what do you mean about wake up
as someth els pleas be more plain as what els
oh who can know possibl as you ar on the human road you might even
becom a man some dai though i should not advis you to build on such a
hope as that
what do you sai mahatma a man on of those twoleg beast that
hunt hare a thing like gile and tomy tom oh not thatnot
that id almost rather go through everyth again than becom a cruel
tortur man
as it spoke thu the hare grew so disturb that it nearli vanish
liter it seem to melt awai till i could onli perceiv it outlin
with a kind of shock i comprehend all the horror that it must feel at
such a prospect as i had suggest to it and realli thi grasp of
the truth hurt my human pride it had never come home to me befor that
the circumst of their livesand deathsmust caus some creatur
to see us in strang light
oh i have no doubt i wa mistaken i said hurriedli and that your
wish on the point will be respect i told you that i know noth
at these word the hare becam quit visibl again
it sat up and veri reflect began to rub it still shadowi nose with
a shadowi paw i think that it rememb the sting of the salt water in
the cut made by the glass of the window through which it had sprung
believ that it remark stori wa done and that present it
would altogeth melt awai and vanish out of my knowledg i look
about me first i look abov the tower gate to see whether the
light had yet begun to chang then as thei had not i look down the
great white road follow it for mile and mile until even to my
spirit sight it lost itself in the nowher
present come up thi road toward us i saw a man dress in a green
coat ridingbreech and boot and a peak cap who held in hi hand
a huntingwhip he wa a finelook person of middl ag with a
pleasant open counten bright blue ey and veri red cheek
on which he wore lightcolour whisker in short a joviallook
individu with whom thing had evid alwai gone well on to whom
sorrow and disappoint and mental struggl were utter stranger he
at least had never known what it is to endur hard in all hi
life
studi hi natur as on can do on the road i perceiv also that in
him there wa no guil he wa a goodmind godfear man accord
to hi simpl light who had done mani kind and contribut
liber toward the want of the poor though as he had been veri
rich it had cost him littl thu to gratifi the natur prompt of
hi heart
moreov he wa what jorsen call a young soul quit young inde by
which i mean that he had not often walk the road in previou state of
life as for instanc that eastern woman had done who accost me befor
the arriv of the hare so to speak hi crude natur had scarc
outgrown the primit human condit in which necess as well as
tast make it customari and pleasant to men to kill that condit
through which almost everi boi pass on hi wai to manhood i suppos
by the work of some secret law of reminisc
it wa thi thought that first led me to connect the newcom with the
redfac man of the hare stori it mai seem strang that i should
have been so dens but the truth is that it never occur to me ani
more than it had done to the hare that such a person would be at all
like to tread the road for mani year to come i had gather that he
wa compar young and although i had argu otherwis with the
hare had conclud therefor that he would continu to live hi
happi earth life until old ag brought him to a natur end henc my
obtus
the man wa drift toward me thoughtfulli evid much bewild
by hi new surround but not in the least afraid inde there none
ar afraid when thei glide from their deathb to the road thei leav
fear behind them with the other terror of our mortal lot

of it why shouldnt i you were a beast i wa a man with dominion over
you you can read all about that in the book of genesi
i never heard of the book of genesi said the hare but what doe
dominion mean doe thi book of genesi sai that it mean the right to
torment that which is weaker than the tormentor
all you anim were made for us to eat comment the man avoid
an answer to the direct question
veri good answer the hare let us suppos that we were given
you to eat wa it in order to eat me that you came out against me with
gun then with dog that run by sight and then with dog that run by
smell
if you were to be kill and eaten why should you not be kill in on
of these wai hare
why should i be kill in those wai man when other more merci
were to your hand inde why should i be kill at all moreov if
you wish to satisfi your hunger with my bodi why at the last wa i
thrown to the dog to devour
i dont quit know hare never look at the matter in that light
befor butah iv got you now he ad triumphantli if it hadnt
been for me you never would have live you see i gave you the gift of
life therefor instead of grumbl you should be veri much oblig
to me dont you understand i preserv hare so that without me you
would never have been a hare isnt that right mr mri am sorri i
have forgotten your name he ad turn toward me
mahatma i said
oh ye i rememb it nowmrahmr hatter
there is someth in the argument i repli cautious but let us
hear our friend answer
answermi answer well here it is what ar you man who dare to sai
that you give life or withhold it you a lord of life you i tell
you that i know littl yet i am sure that you or those like you have
no more power to creat life than the world we have left ha to bid the
star to shine if the life must come it will come and if it cannot
fulfil itself as a hare then it will appear as someth els if you
sai that you creat life i the poor beast which you tortur tell you
that you ar a presumptu liar
you dare to lectur me said the man me the heir of all the ag
as the poet call me why you nasti littl anim do you know that i
have kill hundr like you and he ad with a sudden afflatu of
pride thousand of other creatur such as pheasant to sai noth
of deer and larger game that ha been my princip occup sinc i
wa a boi i mai sai that i have live for sport got veri littl els
to show for my life so to speak
oh said the hare have you well if i were you i shouldnt boast
about it just now you see we ar still outsid of those gate who
know but that you will find everi on of the live thing you have
amus yourself by slaughter wait for you within them each
prai for justic to it maker and your own
my word said the man what a horribl notion it like a bad
dream
he reflect a littl then ad well if thei do iv got my
answer i kill them for food man must live million of pheasant ar
sold to be eaten everi year at a much smaller price than thei cost to
breed what do you sai to that mr hatter finish him i think
im not argu i repli ask the hare
ye ask me man and although you ar repeat yourself ill answer
with anoth question know that here you must tell the truth did
you realli rear us all for food wa it for thi that you kept your
keeper your run dog and your hunt dog that you might kill
poor defenceless beast and bird to fill men stomach if thi wa
so i have noth more to sai inde if our death or suffer at
their hand realli help men in ani wai i have noth more to sai i
admit that you ar higher and stronger than we ar and have a right to
us us for your own advantag or even to destroi us altogeth if we
harm you
the man ponder then repli sullenli
you know veri well that it wa not so i did not rear up pheasant and
hare mere to eat them or that other might eat them someth forc
me to tell you that it wa in order that i might enjoi myself by show
my skill in shoot them or to have the pleasur and exercis of
hunt them to death still he ad defiantli i who am a christian
man maintain that my religion perfectli justifi me in do all these
thing and that no blame attach to me on thi account
veri good said the hare now we have a clear issu friend mahatma
when those gate open present what happen beyond them
i dont know i answer i have never been there at least not that
i can rememb
still friend mahatma is it not said that yonder live some power
which judg righteous and declar what is true and what is fals
i have heard so hare
veri well man i lai my caus befor that powerdo you the same if i
am wrong i will go back to earth to be tortur by you and your again
if howev i am right you shall abid the judgment of the power and
i ask that it will make of youa hunt hare
now when he heard these aw wordsfor thei were awfulno less the
redfac man grew much disturb he hum and he haw and shift
hi feet about at last he said
you must admit that while you live you had a firstclass time under my
protect lot of turnip to eat and so forth
a firstclass time the hare answer with wither scorn what sort
of a time would you have had if some on had shot you all over the back
and you must creep awai to die of pain and starvat how would you
have enjoi it if from dai to dai you had been forc to live in
terror of cun monster who at ani hour might appear to hurt you in
some new fashion do you suppos that anim cannot feel fear and is
continu fear the kind of friend that give them a firstclass time
to thi last argument the man seem abl to find no answer
mr hare he said humbl we ar all fallibl although i never
thought to find myself in the posit of have to do so i will admit
that i mai possibl have been mistaken in my view and treatment of you
and your kind and inde of other creatur if so i apologis for
ani ahtemporari inconveni i mai have caus you i can do no
more
come hare i interpos that handsom perhap you might let
bygon be bygon
apologis exclaim the hare after all i have suffer i do not
think it is enough at the veri least mahatma he should sai that he is
heartili asham and sorri
well well said the man it no us make two bite of a cherri i
am sorri truli sorri for all the pain and terror i have brought on you
if that wont do let go up and settl the matter and if iv been
wrong ill try to bear the consequ like a gentleman onli mr
hare i hope that you will not wish to put your case more strongli
against me than you need
not i man i know now that you onli er becaus the truth had not
been reveal to youbecaus you did not understand all that i will
ask if i can is that you mai be allow to tell thi truth to other
men
well i am glad to sai i cant do that hare
dont be so sure i broke in it just the kind of thing which might
be decreeda gener or two henc when the world is fit to listen to
you
but he took no heed or did not comprehend me and went on
it is an imposs and if i did thei would think me a lunat or
a snivel sentiment humbug i believ that lot of my old friend
would scarc speak to me again why put asid the pleasur of
sport if the view you preach were to be accept what would becom of
keeper and beater and huntsmen and dogbreed and of thousand of
other who directli or indirectli get their live out of hunt and
shoot where would game rent be also
i dont know i am sure repli the hare wearili i suppos
that thei would earn their live in some other wai as thei must in
countri where there is no sport and that you would have to make up
for shoot rent by grow more upon the land you know that after
all we hare and the other game eat a great deal which might be save if
there were not so mani of us but i am not wise and i have never look
at the question from that point of view it mai seem selfish but i have
to consid myself and the creatur whose caus i plead for someth
insid me is tell me nowy nowthat all of them ar speak
through my mouth it sai that is why i am allow to be here and to
talk with you both for their sake rather than for my own
if you have more to sai you had better sai it quickli i interrupt
address the redfac man i see that the light ar begin to
chang which mean that soon the road will be close and the gate
open
i cant rememb anyth he answer ye there is on matter he
ad nervous i see mr hare that you ar think of my boi tom
not veri kindli i am afraid as you have been so good as to forgiv me i
hope that you wont be hard on tom he is not at all a bad sort of a lad
if a littl thoughtless like mani other young peopl
i dont like tom said the hare with decis tom shot me when you
told him not to shoot tom shut me up in a filthi place with a yellow
rabbit which he forgot to feed so that it want to eat me tom tri
to cut me off from the wood so that the run dog might catch me
although you shout to him that it wa not sportsmanlik tom drag
me out of the sea and blew down my nostril to keep me aliv tom threw
me to the hound although gile remonstr with him and even the
huntsman beg him to let me go i tell you that i dont like tom
still mr hare plead the redfac man i hope that if it should
be in your power when we get through those gate that you will be
merci to tom i cant think of much to sai for him in thi hurri but
there he is my onli son and the truth is that i love him you know he
mai liveto be differentif you dont bring some misfortun on him
who am i to bring misfortun or to withhold it ask the hare
soften visibl well i know what love mean for my mother love me
and i love her in my wai i tell you that when i saw her dead turn
from a beauti live thing into a stain lump of flesh and fur i
felt dread i understand now that you love tom as my mother love me
and man for the sake of your lovenot for hi sake mindi promis
you that i wont sai anyth against tom if i can help it or do
anyth either
your a real good fellow exclaim the redfac man with evid
relief give me your hand oh i forgot you cant hullo what up
now everyth seem to be alter
as he spoke to my ey the light began to chang in earnest all the
sky i call it sky for clear abov the mighti gate becam as
it were aliv with burn tongu of everi colour that an artist can
conceiv by degre these fieri tongu or sword shape themselv
into a vast circl which drove back the wall of dark and through
thi circl guid guard by the spirit of dead sun with odour
and with chant descend that crown citi of the mansion befor
whose glori imagin break and even vision veil her ey
it descend it banner waver in the wind of prayer it hung abov
the gate the flower of all splendour heaven veri rose hung like
an opal on the boundless breast of night and there it stai
the voic in the north call to the voic in the south the voic in
the east call to the voic in the west and up the great white road
sped the angel of the road make report as he came that all hi
multitud were gather in and for that while the road wa bar
he pass and in a flash the gate were burn awai the ash of them
fell upon the head of those wait at the gate whiten their face
and dry their tear befor the chang thei fell upon the man and the
hare besid me veil them as it were and make them silent but
on me thei did not fall then from between the warden of the gate
flow forth the helper and the guardian save those who alreadi were
without comfort the children seek their belov and bear the
cup of slumber and new birth then peal the question
who hath suffer most let that on first tast of peac
now all the dim host surg forward sinc each outworn soul believ
that it had suffer most and wa in the bitterest need of peac but
the helper and the guardian gentli press them back and again there
peal no question but a command
thi wa the command
draw near thou hare
jorsen ask me what happen after thi justif of the hare
which if i heard aright appear to suggest that by the decre of some
judg unknown the woe of such creatur ar not unnot and despis
or left unsolac of cours i had to answer him that i could not tell
perhap noth happen at all perhap all the wonder i seem to
see even the road by which soul travel from there to here and from
here to there and the gate that were burn awai and the citi of the
mansion that descend were but sign and symbol of mysteri which
as yet we cannot grasp or understand
whatev mai be the truth as to thi matter of my vision i need hardli
add howev that no on can be more anxiou than i am myself to learn
in what wai the redfac man speak on behalf of our domin race
and the hare speak as an appoint advoc of the subject anim
creation finish their argument in the light of fuller knowledg
much also do i wonder which of them wa prove to be right a difficult
matter whereon i feel quit incompet to express ani view
but you see at that moment i woke up the edg of the road on which i
wa stand seem to give wai beneath me and i fell into space as on
doe in a nightmar it is a veri unpleas sensat
i rememb notic afterward that i could not have been long asleep
when i began to dream i had onli just blown out the candl and when i
awok again there wa still a smoulder spark upon it wick
but as i have said in that spiritland wither i had journei is to be
found neither time nor space nor ani other familiar thing
