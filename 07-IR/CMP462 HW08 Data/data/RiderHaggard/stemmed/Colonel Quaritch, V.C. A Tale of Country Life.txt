a tale of countri life
chapter i
harold quaritch medit
there ar thing and there ar face which when felt or seen for the
first time stamp themselv upon the mind like a sun imag on a
sensit plate and there remain unalter fix to take the
instanc of a facew mai never see it again or it mai becom the
companion of our life but there the pictur is just as we first
knew it the same smile or frown the same look unvari and
unvari remind us in the midst of chang of the indestruct
natur of everi experi act and aspect of our dai for that
which ha been is sinc the past know no corrupt but live
etern in it frozen and complet self
these ar somewhat larg thought to be born of a small matter but
thei rose up spontan in the mind of a soldierlylook man who
on the particular even when thi histori open wa lean over a
gate in an eastern counti lane stare vacantli at a field of ripe
corn
he wa a peculiar and rather batter look individu appar
over forti year of ag and yet bear upon him that unmistak
stamp of digniti and selfrespect which if it doe not exclus
belong to is still on of the distinguish attribut of the
english gentleman in face he wa ugli no other word can express it
here were not the long mustachio the almond ey the aristocrat
air of the colonel of fictionfor our dreamer wa a colonel these
wereala that the truth should be so plainrepres by somewhat
scrubbi sandycolour whisker small but kindli blue ey a low
broad forehead with a deep line run across it from side to side
someth like that to be seen upon the bust of juliu caesar and a
long thin nose on good featur howev he did possess a mouth of
such sweet and beauti that set as it wa abov a veri squar and
manlylook chin it had the air of be ludicr out of place
umph said hi old aunt mr massei who had just di and left him
what she possess on the occas of her first introduct to him
fiveandthirti year befor umph natur meant to make a pretti
girl of you and chang her mind after she had finish the mouth
well never mind better be a plain man than a pretti woman there go
along boi i like your ugli face
nor wa the old ladi peculiar in thi respect for plain as the
counten of colonel harold quaritch undoubtedli wa peopl found
someth veri take about it when onc thei becam accustom to
it rug air and stern regul express what that someth wa
it would be hard to defin but perhap the nearest approach to the
truth would be to describ it as a light of puriti which
notwithstand the popular idea to the contrari is quit as often to
be found upon the face of men as upon those of women ani person of
discern look on colonel quaritch must have felt that he wa in
the presenc of a good mannot a prig or a milksop but a man who had
attain by virtu of thought and struggl that had left their mark
upon him a man whom it would not be well to tamper with on to be
respect by all and fear of evildo men felt thi and he wa
popular among those who knew him in hi servic though not in ani
hailfellowwellmet kind of wai but among women he wa not popular
as a rule thei both fear and dislik him hi presenc jar upon
the frivol of the lighter member of their sex who dimli realis
that hi natur wa antagonist and the more solid on could not
understand him perhap thi wa the reason why colonel quaritch had
never marri had never even had a love affair sinc he wa fiveand
twenti
and yet it wa of a woman that he wa think as he leant over the
gate and look at the field of yellow corn undul like a
golden sea beneath the pressur of the wind
colonel quaritch had twice befor been at honham onc ten and onc
four year ago now he wa come to abid there for good hi old aunt
mr massei had own a place in the villagea veri small place
call honham cottag or molehil and on those two occas he
visit her mr massei wa dead and buri she had left him the
properti and with some reluct he had given up hi profess in
which he saw no further prospect and come to live upon it thi wa
hi first even in the place for he had arriv by the last train
on the previou night all dai he had been busi try to get the
hous a littl straight and now thoroughli tire he wa refresh
himself by lean over a gate it is though a great mani peopl will
not believ it on of the most delight and certainli on of the
cheapest refresh in the world
and then it wa as he leant over the gate that the imag of a
woman face rose befor hi mind as it had continu risen dure
the last five year five year had gone sinc he saw it and those
five year he spent in india and egypt that is with the except of
six month which he pass in hospitalth upshot of an arab spear
thrust in the thigh
it had risen befor him in all sort of place and at all sort of
time in hi sleep in hi wake moment at mess out shoot and
even onc in the hot rush of battl he rememb it wellit wa at
el teb it happen that stern necess forc him to shoot a man
with hi pistol the bullet cut through hi enemi and with a few
convuls he di he watch him die he could not help do so
there wa some fascin in follow the act of hi own hand to it
dread conclus and inde conclus and commenc were veri
near togeth the terror of the sight the terror of what in defenc
of hi own life he wa forc to do revolt him even in the heat of
the fight and even then over that ghastli and distort face
anoth face spread itself like a mask blot it out from view
that woman face and now again it rearos inspir him with the
rather recondit reflect as to the immut of thing and
impress with which thi domest record open
five year is a good stretch in a man journei through the world
mani thing happen to us in that time if a thought person were to
set to work to record all the impress which imping upon hi mind
dure that period he would fill a librari with volum the mere
tale of it event would furnish a shelf and yet how small thei ar
to look back upon it seem but the other dai that he wa lean
over thi veri gate and had turn to see a young girl dress in
black who with a sprai of honeysuckl thrust in her girdl and
carri a stick in her hand wa walk leisur down the lane
there wa someth about the girl air that had struck him while she
wa yet a long wai offa digniti a grace and a set of the
shoulder then as she came nearer he saw the soft dark ey and the
wave brown hair that contrast so strang and effect with
the pale and strike featur it wa not a beauti face for the
mouth wa too larg and the nose wa not as straight as it might have
been but there wa a power about the broad brow and a forc and
solid nobil stamp upon the featur which had impress him
strang just as she came opposit to where he wa stand a gust
of wind for there wa a stiff breez blew the ladi hat off take
it over the hedg and he as in duti bound scrambl into the field
and fetch it for her and she had thank him with a quick smile and
a light up of the brown ey and then pass on with a bow
ye with a littl bow she had pass on and he watch her walk
down the long level drift till her imag melt into the stormi
sunset light and wa gone when he return to the cottag he had
describ her to hi old aunt and ask who she might be to learn
that she wa ida de la moll which sound like a name out of a
novel the onli daughter of the old squir who live at honham
castl next dai he had left for india and saw miss de la moll no
more
and now he wonder what had becom of her probabl she wa marri
so strike a person would be almost sure to attract the notic of
men and after all what could it matter to him he wa not a marri
man and women as a class had littl attract for him inde he
dislik them it ha been said that he had never marri and never
even had a love affair sinc he wa fiveandtwenti but though he wa
not marri he oncebefor he wa fiveandtwentyveri nearli took
that step it wa twenti year ago now and nobodi quit knew the
histori for in twenti year mani thing ar fortun forgotten
but there wa a histori and a scandal and the marriag wa broken
off almost on the dai it should have taken place and after that it
leak out in the neighbourhood that the young ladi who by the wai
wa a consider heiress had gone off her head presum with
grief and been confin in an asylum where she wa believ still to
remain
perhap it wa the thought of thi on woman face the woman he had
onc seen walk down the drift her figur limn out against the
stormi sky that led him to think of the other face the face hidden
in the madhous at ani rate with a sigh or rather a groan he swung
himself round from the gate and began to walk homeward at a brisk
pace
the drift that he wa follow is known as the mile drift and had in
ancient time form the approach to the gate of honham castl the
seat of the ancient and honour famili of de la moll sometim
written delamol in histori and old write honham castl wa now
noth but a ruin with a manor hous built out of the wreck on on
side of it squar and the broad wai that led to it from the high
road which ran from boisingham the local countri town wa a drift
or grass lane
said to have been so name after the boissei famili whose heiress
a de la moll marri in the fourteenth centuri as howev the
town of boisingham is mention by on of the old chronicl
thi doe not seem veri probabl no doubt the famili took their
name from the town or hamlet not the town from the famili
colonel quaritch follow thi drift till he came to the high road
and then turn a few minut walk brought him to a drive open
out of the main road on the left as he face toward boisingham thi
drive which wa some three hundr yard long led up a rather sharp
slope to hi own place honham cottag or molehil as the villag
call it a titl calcul to give a keen impress of a neat
spick and span red brick villa with a slate roof in fact howev it
wa noth of the sort be a build of the fifteenth centuri as
a glanc at it massiv flint wall wa suffici to show in ancient
time there had been a larg abbei at boisingham two mile awai
which the record tell suffer terribl from an outbreak of the
plagu in the fifteenth centuri after thi the monk obtain ten
acr of land known as molehil by grant from the de la moll of the
dai and so name either on account of their resembl to a molehil
of which more present or after the famili on thi elev spot
which wa suppos to be peculiarli healthi thei built the littl
hous now call honham cottag whereto to fly when next the plagu
should visit them
and as thei built it so with some slight addit it had remain
to thi dai for in those ag men did not skimp their flint and oak
and mortar it wa a beauti littl spot situat upon the flat top
of a swell hill which compris the ten acr of graze ground
origin grant and wa strang to sai still the most
magnificentlytimb piec of ground in the countri side for on the
ten acr of grass land there stood over fifti great oak some of
them pollard of the most enorm antiqu and other which had no
doubt origin grown veri close togeth fine upstand tree
with a wonder length and girth of bole thi place colonel
quaritch aunt old mr massei had bought nearli thirti year
befor when she becam a widow and now togeth with a modest incom
of two hundr a year it had pass to him under her will
shake himself clear of hi sad thought harold quaritch turn
round at hi own front door to contempl the scene the long
singlestori hous stood it ha been said at the top of the rise
land and to the south and west and east command as beauti a view
as is to be seen in the counti there a mile or so awai to the south
situat in the midst of grassi graze ground and flank on either
side by still perfect tower frown the massiv gatewai of the old
norman castl then to the west almost at the foot of molehil the
ground broke awai in a deep bank cloth with timber which led the
ey down by slow descent into the beauti vallei of the ell here
the silver river wound it gentl wai through lush and poplarbord
marsh where the cattl stand kneedeep in flower past quaint
wooden millhous through boisingham old common windi look even
now and brighten here and there with a dash of golden gors till
it wa lost beneath the picturesqu cluster of redtil roof that
mark the ancient town look which wai he would the view wa love
and equal to ani to be found in the eastern counti where the
sceneri is fine enough in it own wai whatev peopl mai choos to
sai to the contrari whose imagin ar so weak that thei requir
a mountain and a torrent to excit them into activ
behind the hous to the north there wa no view and for a good
reason for here in the veri middl of the back garden rose a mound of
larg size and curiou shape which complet shut out the landscap
what thi mound which mai perhap have cover half an acr of
ground wa nobodi had ani idea some learn folk write it down a
saxon tumulu a presumpt to which it ancient name dead man
mount seem to give colour other folk howev yet more learn
declar it to be an ancient british dwell and point
triumphantli to a hollow at the top wherein the ancient british
were suppos to have move live and had their beingwhich must
urg the oppos parti have been a veri damp on thereon the late
mr massei who wa a british dwellingit proceed to show with
much triumph how thei had live in the hole by build a huge
mushroomshap roof over it and therebi turn it into a summer
hous which ow to unexpect difficulti in the construct of
the roof cost a great deal of monei but as the roof wa slate and
as it wa found necessari to pave the hollow with tile and cut
surfac drain in it the result did not clearli prove it us as a
dwell place befor the roman conquest nor did it make a veri good
summer hous inde it now serv as a store place for the garden
tool and for rubbish gener
chapter ii
the colonel meet the squir
as colonel quaritch wa contempl these variou view and
reflect that on the whole he had done well to come and live at
honham cottag he wa suddenli startl by a loud voic salut him
from about twenti yard distanc with such peculiar vigour that he
fairli jump
colonel quaritch i believ said or rather shout the voic from
somewher down the drive
ye answer the colonel mildli here i am
ah i thought it wa you alwai tell a militari man you know
excus me but i am rest for a minut thi last pull is an
uncommonli stiff on i alwai us to tell my dear old friend mr
massei that she ought to have the hill cut awai a bit just here
well here goe for it and after a few heavi step hi visitor
emerg from the shadow of the tree into the sunset light which wa
plai on the terrac befor the hous
colonel quaritch glanc up curious to see who the owner of the
great voic might be and hi ey lit upon as fine a specimen of
human as he had seen for a long while the man wa old as hi
white hair show seventi perhap but that wa the onli sign of
decai about him he wa a splendid man broad and thick and strong
with a keen quick ey and a face sharpli chisel and clean
shave of the stamp which in novel is gener known as
aristocrat a face in fact that show both birth and breed
inde as cloth in loos tweed garment and a gigant pair of top
boot hi visitor stood lean on hi long stick and rest himself
after face the hill harold quaritch thought that he had never seen
a more perfect specimen of the typic english countri gentlemana
the english countri gentleman us to be
how do you do sir how do you domi name is de la moll my man
georg who know everybodi busi except hi own told me that
you had arriv here so i thought i would walk round and do myself
the honour of make your acquaint

not at all if you onli knew how uncommonli dull it is down in these
part you would not sai that the place isnt what it us to be when
i wa a boi there ar plenti of rich peopl about but thei ar not
the same stamp of peopl it isnt what it us to be in more wai
than on and the old squir gave someth like a sigh and
thoughtfulli remov hi white hat out of which a dinner napkin and
two pockethandkerchief fell to the ground in a fashion that
remind colonel quaritch of the climax of a conjur trick
you have drop somesom linen he said stoop down to pick
the mysteri articl up
oh ye thank you answer hi visitor i find the sun a littl
hot at thi time of the year there is noth like a few
handkerchief or a towel to keep it off and he roll the mass of
naperi into a ball and cram it back into the crown replac the
hat on hi head in such a fashion that about eight inch of white
napkin hung down behind you must have felt it in egypt he went on
the sun i mean it a bad climat that egypt as i have good
reason to know and he point again to hi white hat which harold
quaritch now observ for the first time wa encircl by a broad
black band
ah i see he said i suppos that you have had a loss
ye sir a veri heavi loss
now colonel quaritch had never heard that mr de la moll had more
than on child ida de la moll the young ladi whose face remain so
strongli fix in hi memori although he had scarc spoken to her
on that on occas five long year ago could it be possibl that
she had di in egypt the idea sent a tremor of fear through him
though of cours there wa no real reason why it should death ar so
common
notnot miss de la moll he said nervous ad i had the
pleasur of see her onc a good mani year ago when i wa
stop here for a few dai with my aunt
oh no not ida she is aliv and well thank god her brother jame
he went all through that wretch war which we ow to mr gladston
as i sai though i dont know what your polit ar and then caught
a fever or as i think got touch by the sun and di on hi wai
home poor boi he wa a fine fellow colonel quaritch and my onli
son but veri reckless onli a month or so befor he di i wrote to
him to be care alwai to put a towel in hi helmet and he
answer in that flippant sort of wai he had that he wa not go
to turn himself into a dirti cloth bag and that he rather like the
heat than otherwis well he gone poor fellow in the servic of
hi countri like mani of hi ancestor befor him and there an end
of him
and again the old man sigh heavili thi time
and now colonel quaritch he went on shake off hi oppress
with a curiou rapid that wa characterist of him what do you
sai to come up to the castl for your dinner you must be in a mess
here and i expect that old mr jobson whom my man georg tell me
you have got to look after you will be glad enough to be rid of you
for tonight what do you saytak the place as you find it you

go off to boisingham to fetch it thi morn at least that is
what he said he wa go for just an excus to gossip and idl i
fanci
well realli said the colonel you ar veri kind but i dont
think that my dress cloth ar unpack yet
dress cloth oh never mind your dress cloth ida will excus
you i daresai besid you have no time to dress by jove it
nearli seven oclock we must be off if you ar come
the colonel hesit he had intend to dine at home and be a
methodicalmind man did not like alter hi plan also he wa
like most militari men veri punctili about hi dress and person
appear and object to go out to dinner in a shoot coat
but all thi notwithstand a feel that he did not quit
understand and which it would have puzzl even an american novelist
to analysesometh between restless and curios with a dash
of magnet attract thrown ingot the better of hi scrupl and
he accept
well thank you he said if you ar sure that miss de la moll
will not mind i will come just allow me to tell mr jobson
that right halloa the squir after him ill meet you at the
back of the hous we had better go through the field
by the time that the colonel have inform hi housekeep that he
should not want ani dinner and hastili brush hi not too luxuri
lock had reach the garden which lai behind the hous the squir
wa nowher to be seen present howev a loud halloa from the top
of the tumuluslik hill announc hi whereabout
wonder what the old gentleman could be do there harold quaritch
walk up the step that led to the summit of the mound and found him
stand at the entranc to the mushroomshap summerhous
contempl the view
there colonel he said there a perfect view for you talk about
scotland and the alp give me a view of the vallei of ell from the
top of dead man mount on an autumn even and i never want to see
anyth finer i have alwai love it from a boi and alwai shall so
long as i livelook at those oak too there ar no such tree in
the counti that i know of the old ladi your aunt wa wonderfulli
fond of them i hope he went on in a tone of anxietyi hope that
you dont mean to cut ani of them down
oh no said the colonel i should never think of such a thing
that right never cut down a good tree if you can help it im
sorri to sai howev he ad after a paus that i have been
forc to cut down a good mani myself queer place thi isnt it he
continu drop the subject of the tree which wa evid a
pain on to him dead man mount is what the peopl about here
call it and that is what thei call it at the time of the conquest
as i can prove to you from ancient write i alwai believ that it
wa a tumulu but of late year a lot of these clever peopl have
been take their oath that it is an ancient british dwell as
though ancient briton or ani on els for that matter could live in
a kind of drainhol but thei got on the soft side of your old aunt
who by the wai beg your pardon wa a wonderfulli obstin old
ladi when onc she hammer an idea into her headand so she set to
work and built thi slate mushroom over the place and on wai and
anoth it cost her two hundr and fifti pound dear me i shall
never forget her face when she saw the bill and the old gentleman
burst out into a titan laugh such as harold quaritch had not heard
for mani a long dai
ye he answer it is a queer spot i think that i must have a
dig at it on dai
by jove said the squir i never thought of that it would be
worth do hulloa it is twenti minut past seven and we dine at
half past i shall catch it from ida come on colonel quaritch you
dont know what it is to have a daughtera daughter when on is late
for dinner is a seriou thing for ani man and he start off down
the hill in a hurri
veri soon howev he seem to forget the terror in store and
stroll along stop now and again to admir some particular oak
or view chat all the while in a discurs manner which though
somewhat aimless wa by no mean without it charm he made a capit
companion for a silent man like harold quaritch who like to hear
other peopl talk
in thi wai thei went down the slope and cross a coupl of wheat
field came to a success of broad meadow somewhat spars
timber through these the footpath ran right up to the grim gatewai
of the ancient castl which now loom befor them outlin in red
line of fire against the ruddi background of the sunset sky
ay it a fine old place colonel isnt it said the squir
catch the exclam of admir that broke from hi companion
lip as a sudden turn brought them into line with the norman ruin
historythat what it is histori in stone and mortar thi is
histor ground everi inch of it those old de la moll my
ancestor and the boissei befor them were great folk in their dai
and thei kept up their posit well i will take you to see their
tomb in the church yonder on sundai i alwai hope to be buri
besid them but i cant manag it now becaus of the act howev i
mean to get as near to them as i can i have a fanci for the
companionship of those old baron though i expect that thei were a
roughish lot in their lifetim look how squar those tower stand
out against the sky thei alwai remind me of the men who built them
sturdi overbear fellow set their shoulder against the sea
of circumst and care neither for man nor devil till the priest
got hold of them at the last well god rest them thei help to make
england whatev their fault queer place to choos for a castl
though wasnt it right out in an open plain
i suppos that thei trust to their moat and wall and the hagger
at the bottom of the dry ditch said the colonel you see there is
no emin from which thei could be command and their archer
could sweep all the plain from the battlement
ah ye of cours thei could it is easi to see that you ar a
soldier thei were no fool those old crusad my word we must be
get on thei ar haul down the union jack on the west tower i
alwai have it haul down at sunset and he began walk briskli
again
in anoth three minut thei had cross a narrow byroad and were
pass up the ancient drive that led to the castl gate it wa not
much of a drive but there were still some halfdozen of old pollard
oak that had no doubt stood there befor the norman boissei from
whose famili centuri ago the de la moll had obtain the
properti by marriag with the heiress had got hi charter and cut the
first sod of hi moat
right befor them wa the gatewai of the castl flank by two great
tower and these with the except of some ruin were as a matter
of fact all that remain of the ancient build which had been
effectu demolish in the time of cromwel the space within
where the keep had onc stood wa now laid out as a flower garden
while the hous which wa of an unpretenti natur and built in
the jacobean style occupi the south side of the squar and wa
place with it back to the moat
you see i have practic rebuilt those two tower said the
squir paus underneath the norman archwai if i had not done it
he ad apologet thei would have been in ruin by now but it
cost a pretti penni i can tell you nobodi know what stuff that old
flint masonri is to deal with till he tri it well thei will stand
now for mani a long dai and here we areand he push open a porch
door and then pass up some step and through a passag into an oak
panel vestibul which wa hung with tapestri origin taken no
doubt from the old castl and decor with coat of armour spear
head and ancient sword
and here it wa that harold quaritch onc more beheld the face which
had haunt hi memori for so mani month

on of the wildest and most extravag young men in an extravag
regiment and as such had to some extent shun hi societi on the
few occas that he had been thrown in with him perhap ida with a
woman quick divin from hi tone that there wa someth
behind hi remarkat ani rate she did not ask him for particular of
their slight acquaint
he wa my onli brother she continu there never were but we two
and of cours hi loss wa a great blow to me my father cannot get
over it at all although and she broke off suddenli and rest
her head upon her hand
at thi moment the squir wa heard advanc down the stair
shout to the servant as he came
a thousand pardon my dear a thousand pardon he said as he
enter the room but well if you will forgiv particular i wa
quit unabl to discov the whereabout of a certain necessari
portion of the male attir now colonel quaritch will you take my
daughter stop you dont know the wayperhap i had better show you
with the candl
accordingli he advanc out of the vestibul and turn to the left
led the wai down a long passag till he reach the diningroom thi
apart wa like the vestibul oakpanel but the wall were
decor with famili and other portrait includ a veri curiou
paint of the castl itself as it wa befor it destruct in the
time of cromwel thi paint wa execut on a massiv slab of oak
and conceiv in a most quaint and formal style be reliev in the
foreground with stag at gaze and woodeni hors that must accord
to ani rule of proport have been about half as larg as the
gatewai tower evid also it wa of an older date than the
present hous which is jacobean have probabl been remov to it
present posit from the ruin of the castl such as it wa
howev it gave a veri good idea of what the ancient seat of the
boissei and de la moll had been like befor the roundhead had made
an end of it glori the diningroom itself wa commodi though not
larg it wa light by three narrow window which look out upon
the moat and bore a consider air of solid comfort the tabl
made of black oak of extraordinari solid and weight wa match
by a sideboard of the same materi and appar of the same date
both piec of furnitur be as mr de la moll inform hi
guest relic of the castl
on thi sideboard were place sever piec of old and massiv plate
each of which wa rude engrav with three falcon or the arm of
the de la moll famili on piec inde a veri ancient salver bore
those of the boisseysa rag oak in an escutcheon of pretenc
show therebi that it date from that de la moll who in the time of
henri the seventh had obtain the properti by marriag with the
boissei heiress
convers have turn that wai as the dinner which wa a simpl
on went on the old squir had thi piec of plate brought to harold
quaritch for him to examin
it is veri curiou he said have you much of thi mr de la
moll
no inde he said i wish i had it all vanish in the time of
charl the first
melt down i suppos said the colonel
no that is the odd part of it i dont think it wa it wa hidden
somewherei dont know where or perhap it wa turn into monei and
the monei hidden but i will tell you the stori if you like as soon as
we have done dinner
accordingli when the servant had remov the cloth and after the
old fashion place the wine upon the nake wood the squir began hi
tale of which the follow is the substanc
in the time of jame i the de la moll famili wa at the height of
it prosper that is so far as monei goe for sever gener
previou the repres of the famili had withdrawn themselv
from ani activ particip in public affair and live here at
small expens upon their land which were at that time veri larg
had amass a quantiti of wealth that for the ag might fairli be
call enorm thu sir stephen de la moll the grandfath of the
sir jame who live in the time of jame i left to hi son also
name stephen a sum of no less than twentythre thousand pound in
gold thi stephen wa a great miser and tradit sai that he
trebl the sum in hi lifetim anyhow he di rich as croesu and
abomin alik by hi tenant and by the countri side as might be
expect when a gentleman of hi race and fame degrad himself as
thi sir stephen undoubtedli did to the practic of usuri
with the next heir sir jame howev the old spirit of the de la
moll seem to have reviv although it is suffici clear that
he wa by no mean a spendthrift but on the contrari a care man
though on who maintain hi station and refus to soil hi finger
with such base deal as it had pleas hi uncl to do go to
court he becam perhap on account of hi wealth a consider
favourit with jame i to whom he wa greatli attach and from whom
he bought a baronetci inde the best proof of hi devot is that
he on two occas lent larg sum of monei to the king which were
never repaid on the access of charl i howev sir jame left
court under circumst which were never quit clear up it is
said that smart under some slight which wa put upon him he made a
somewhat brusqu demand for the monei that he had lent to jame
thereon the king with sarcast wit congratul him on the fact
that the spirit of hi uncl sir stephen de la moll whose name wa
still a byword in the land evid surviv in the famili sir
jame turn white with anger bow and without a word left the
court nor did he ever return thither
year pass and the civil war wa at it height sir jame had as
yet steadili refus to take ani share in it he had never forgiven
the insult put upon him by the king for like most of hi race of
whom it wa said that thei never forgav an injuri and never forgot a
kind he wa a pertinaci man therefor he would not lift a
finger in the king caus but still less would he help the
roundhead whom he hate with a singular hatr so time went till
at last when he wa sore press charl know hi great wealth
and influenc brought himself to write a letter to thi sir jame
appeal to him for support and especi for monei
i hear said the king in hi letter that sir jame de la moll
who wa aforetym well affect to our person and more especi to
the late king our saint father doth stand idl watch the
grow of thi bloodi struggl and lift no hand such wa not the
wai of the race from which he sprang which unless histori doth
greatli lie hath in the past been ever found at the side of their
king strike for the right it is told to me also that sir jame de
la moll doth thu place himself asid blow neither hot nor cold
becaus of some sharp word which we spake in heedless jest mani a
year that gone we know not if thi be true doubt if a man
memori be so long but if so it be then herebi do we crave hi
pardon and no more can we do and now is our estat on of grievou
peril and sore do we need the aid of god and man therefor if the
heart of our subject sir jame de la moll be not rebelli against
us as we cannot readili credit it to be we do implor hi present
aid in men and monei of which last it is said he hath larg store
thi letter be proof of our urgent need
these were as nearli as i can rememb the veri word of the
letter which wa written with the king own hand and show pretti
clearli how hardli he wa press it is said that when he read it
sir jame forget hi grievanc wa much affect and take
paper wrote hastili as follow which inde he certainli did for i
have seen the letter in the museum my liegeof the past i will not
speak it is past but sinc it hath gracious pleas your majesti
to ask mine aid against the rebel who would overthrow your throne
rest assur that all i have is at your majesti command till such
time as your enemi ar discomfit it hath pleas provid to so
prosper my fortun that i have store awai in a safe place till
these time be past a veri great sum in gold whereof i will at onc
place ten thousand piec at the dispos of your majesti so soon as
a safe mean can be provid of convei the same see that i had
sooner die than that these great monei should fall into the hand of
rebel to the further of a wick caus
then the letter went on to sai that the writer would at onc buckl
to and rais a troop of hors among hi tenantri and that if other
satisfactori arrang could not be made for the convey of the
monei he would bring them in person to the king
and now come the climax of the stori the messeng wa captur and
sir jamess incauti letter taken from hi boot as a result of
which within ten dai time he found himself close besieg by five
hundr roundhead under the command of on colonel playfair the
castl wa but illprovis for a sieg and in the end sir jame
wa driven by sheer starvat to surrend no sooner had he obtain
an entri then colonel playfair sent for hi prison and to hi
astonish produc to sir jamess face hi own letter to the king
now sir jame he said we have the hive and i must ask you to
lead us to the honei where be those great monei whereof you talk
herein fain would i be finger these ten thousand piec of gold
the which you have so snugli store awai

old sir jame laugh and said that shoot him thei might but that
he consign hi soul to the devil if he would enrich them with hi
treasur and then ask that hi bibl might be brought to him that
he might read therein and prepar himself for death
thei gave him the bibl and left him next morn at the dawn a
file of roundhead march him into the courtyard of the castl and
here he found colonel playfair and hi offic wait

but at that moment there came up so furiou a squall of wind and
with it such dens and cut rain that for a while the execut

morn swept out from the sky and reveal the doom man kneel
in prayer upon the sodden turf the water run from hi white hair

tell you the end of the stori if you care to hear ani more i will
join you in the drawingroom
chapter iv
the end of the tale
as soon as her father had gone ida rose and suggest that if colonel
quaritch had done hi wine thei should go into the drawingroom which
thei accordingli did thi room wa much more modern than either the
vestibul or the diningroom and had an air and flavour of nineteenth
centuri young ladi about it there were the littl tabl the
draperi the photograph frame and all the hundr and on knick
knack and odd and end by mean of which a ladi of tast make a
chamber love in the ey of brutal man it wa a veri pleasant place
to look upon thi drawingroom at honham castl with it irregular
recess it somewhat fade colour illumin by the soft light of
a shade lamp and it gener air of feminin dominion harold
quaritch wa a man who had seen much of the world but who had not
seen veri much of drawingroom or inde of ladi at larg thei
had not come in hi wai or if thei did come in hi wai he had avoid
them therefor perhap he wa the more suscept to such
influenc when he wa brought within their reach or perchanc it wa
ida graciou presenc which threw a charm upon the place that ad
to it natur attract as the china bowl of lavend and rose
leav ad perfum to the air anyhow it struck him that he had
rare befor seen a room which convei to hi mind such strong
suggest of refin and gentl rest
what a charm room he said as he enter it
i am glad you think so answer ida becaus it is my own
territori and i arrang it
ye he said it is easi to see that
well would you like to hear the end of the stori about sir jame and
hi treasur
certainli it interest me veri much
it posit fascin me said ida with emphasi
listen and i will tell you after thei had shot old sir jame thei
took the bibl off him but whether or no colonel playfair ever sent
it to the son in franc is not clear
the stori is all known histor and it is certain that as my
father said he ask that hi bibl might be sent but noth more
thi son sir edward never live to return to england after hi
father murder the estat were seiz by the parliamentari parti
and the old castl with the except of the gate tower raze to
the ground partli for militari purpos and partli in the long and
determin attempt that wa made to discov old sir jamess treasur
which might it wa thought have been conceal in some secret
chamber in the wall but it wa all of no us and colonel playfair
found that in let hi temper get the better of him and shoot
sir jame he had done awai with the onli chanc of find it that he
wa ever like to have for to all appear the secret had di
with it owner there wa a great deal of nois about it at the time
and the colonel wa degrad from hi rank in reward for what he had
done it wa presum that old sir jame must have had accomplic in
the hide of so great a mass of gold and everi mean wa taken by
wai of threat and promis of rewardwhich at last grew to half of
the total amount that should be discoveredto induc these to come
forward if thei exist but without result and so the matter went
on till after a few year the quest di awai and wa forgotten
meanwhil the son sir edward who wa the second and last baronet
led a wander life abroad fear or not care to return to
england now that all hi properti had been seiz when he wa two
andtwenti year of ag howev he contract an imprud marriag
with hi cousin a ladi of the name of ida dofferleigh a girl of good
blood and great beauti but without mean inde she wa the sister
of geoffrei dofferleigh who wa a first cousin and companion in exil
of sir edward and as you will present see my lineal ancestor
well within a year of thi marriag poor ida my namesak di with
her babi of fever chiefli brought on thei sai by want and anxieti
of mind and the shock seem to have turn her husband brain at
ani rate within three or four month of her death he commit
suicid but befor he did so he formal execut a rather elabor
will by which he left all hi estat in england now unjustli
withheld from me contrari to the law and natur right by the rebel
pretend cromwel togeth with the treasur hidden thereon or
elsewher by my late murder father sir jame de la moll to john
geoffrei dofferleigh hi cousin and the brother of hi late wife
and hi heir for ever on condit onli of hi assum the name and
arm of the de la moll famili the direct line of which becam
extinct with himself of cours thi will when it wa execut wa
to all appear so much wast paper but within three year from
that date charl ii wa king of england
thereon geoffrei dofferleigh produc the document and on assum
the name and arm of de la moll actual succeed in obtain the
remain of the castl and a consider portion of the land
properti though the baronetci becam extinct hi son it wa who
built thi present hous and he is our direct ancestor for though my
father talk of them as though thei wereit is a littl weak of
histh old de la moll ar not our direct male ancestor
well said harold and did dofferleigh find the treasur
no ah no nor anybodi els the treasur ha vanish he hunt
for it a great deal and he did find those piec of plate which you
saw tonight hidden awai somewher i dont know where but there wa
noth els with them
perhap the whole thing wa nonsens said harold reflect
no answer ida shake her head i am sure it wa not i am sure
the treasur is hidden awai somewher to thi dai listen colonel
quaritchy have not heard quit all the stori yeti found
someth
you what
wait a minut and i will show you and go to a cabinet in the
corner she unlock it and took out a despatch box which she also
unlock
here she said i found thi it is the bibl that sir jame beg
might be sent to hi son just befor thei shot him you rememb
and she hand him a small brown book he took it and examin it
carefulli it wa bound in leather and on the cover wa written in
larg letter sir jame de la moll honham castl 1611 nor wa
thi all the first sheet of the bibl which wa on of the earliest
copi of the authoris version were torn out and the top corner
wa also gone have to all appear been shot off by a bullet a
presumpt that a dark stain of blood upon the cover and edg
brought near to certainti
poor gentleman said harold he must have had it in hi pocket when
he wa shot where did you find it
ye i suppos so said ida in fact i have no doubt of it i found
it when i wa a child in an ancient oak chest in the basement of the
western tower quit hidden up in dusti rubbish and bit of old iron
but look at the end and you will see what he wrote in it to hi son
edward here i will show you and lean over him she turn to the
last page of the book between the bottom of the page and the
conclus of the final chapter of revel there had been a small
blank space now dens cover with crab write in fade ink
which she read aloud it ran as follow
do not griev for me edward my son that i am thu suddenli
done to death by rebel murder for nought happeneth but
accord to god will and now farewel edward till we shall
meet in heaven my moni have i hid and on account thereof i die
unto thi world know that not on piec shall cromwel touch
to whom god shall appoint shall all my treasur be for nought

quaritch the bibl i think wa never sent to hi son but here it
is and in that write as i solemnli believ and she laid her
white finger upon the fade charact li the kei to wherev it
is that the monei is hidden onli i fear i shall never make it out
for year i have puzzl over it think that it might be some form
of acrost but i can make noth of it i have tri it all wai i
have translat it into french and had it translat into latin but
still i can find out nothingnoth but some dai somebodi will hit
upon itat least i hope so
harold shook hi head i am afraid he said that what ha remain
undiscov for so long will remain so till the end of the chapter
perhap old sir jame wa hoax hi enemi
no said ida for if he wa what becam of all the monei he wa
known to be on of the richest men of hi dai and that he wa rich we
can see from hi letter to the king there wa noth found after hi
death except hi land of cours oh it will be found somedai
twenti centuri henc probabl much too late to be of ani good to
us and she sigh deepli while a pain and weari express
spread itself over her handsom face

parti but how can i think of such thing with all thi worri on my
hand well goodnight colonel quaritch goodnight and he turn
and walk awai through the moonlight
harold quaritch watch him go and then stalk off home reflect
not without sad upon the drama which wa open up befor him
that most common of drama in these dai of depressionth break up
of an ancient famili through caus beyond control it requir far
less acumen and knowledg of the world than he possess to make it
clear to him that the old race of de la moll wa doom thi stori
of farm thrown up and monei not forthcom point it own moral
and a sad on it wa even ida almost childish excit about the
legend of the buri treasur show him how present to her mind must
be the necess of monei and he fell to think how pleasant it
would be to be abl to plai the part of the fairi princ and step in
with untold wealth between her and the ruin which threaten her
famili how well that grandlook openmind squir would becom a
great station fit as he wa by natur descent and tradit to
plai the solid part of an english countri gentleman of the good old
fashion kind it wa piti to think of a man of hi stamp forc
by the vile exig of a narrow purs to scheme and fight against
the advanc tide of destitut and ida tooida who wa
equip with everi attribut that can make wealth and power what thei
should bea frame to show off her worth and state well it wa the
wai of the world and he could not mend it but it wa with a bitter
sens of the unfit of thing that with some littl difficultyfor
he wa not yet fulli accustom to it twist and turnsh found hi
wai past the swell heap of dead man mount and round the hous to
hi own front door
he enter the hous and have told mr jobson that she could go to
bed sat down to smoke and think harold quaritch like mani solitari
men wa a great smoker and never did he feel the need for the
consol of tobacco more than on thi night a few month ago when
he had retir from the armi he found himself in a great dilemma
there he wa a hale activ man of threeandforti of busi habit
and regular mind suddenli thrown upon the world without occup
what wa he to do with himself while he wa ask thi question and
wait blankli for an answer which did not come hi aunt old mr
massei depart thi life leav him heir to what she possess
which might be three hundr a year in all thi ad to hi pension
and the littl that he own independ put him beyond the
necess of seek further employ so he had made up hi mind to
come to resid at molehil and live the quiet somewhat aimless life
of a small countri gentleman hi read for he wa a great reader
especi of scientif work would he thought keep him emploi
moreov he wa a thorough sportsman and an ardent though ow to
the small of hi mean necessarili not a veri extens
collector of curios and more particularli of coin
at first after he had come to hi decis a feel of infinit
rest and satisfact had taken possess of him the struggl of
life wa over for him no longer would he be oblig to think and
contriv and toil henceforth hi dai would slope gentli down
toward the inevit end troubl lai in the past now rest and rest
alon await him rest that would gradual grow deeper and deeper as
the swift year roll by till it wa swallow up in that almighti
peac to which be a simpl and religi man he had look
forward from childhood as the end and object of hi life
foolish man and vain imagin here while we draw breath there is
no rest we must go on continu on from strength to strength or
weak to weak we must alwai be troubl about thi or that
and must ever have thi desir or that to regret it is an inevit
law within whose attract all must fall ye even the purest soul
cradl in their hope of heaven and the most swinish wallow in
the mud of their gratifi desir
and so our hero had alreadi begun to find out here befor he had
been fortyeight hour in honham a fresh caus of troubl had
arisen he had seen ida de la moll again and after an interv of
between five and six year had found her face yet more charm than
it wa befor in short he had fallen in love with it and be a
sensibl man he did not conceal thi fact from himself inde the
truth wa that he had been in love with her for all these year
though he had never look at the matter in that light at the least
the pile had been gather and laid and did but requir a touch of
the match to burn up merrili enough and now thi wa suppli and at
the first glanc of ida ey the magic flame began to hiss and
crackl and he knew that noth short of a convuls or a delug
would put it out
men of the stamp of harold quaritch gener pass through three
stage with refer to the other sex thei begin in their youth by
make a goddess of on of them and find out their mistak then
for mani year thei look upon woman as the essenc and incarn of
evil and a thing no more to be trust than a jaguar ultim
howev thi folli wear itself out probabl in proport as the
old affect fade and di awai and is replac by contempt and
regret that so much should have been wast on that which wa of so
littl worth then it is that the danger come for then a man put
forth hi second ventur put it forth with fear and trembl and
with no great hope of see a golden argosi sail into port and if
it sink or is driven back by advers wind and frown ski there
is an end of hi legitim deal with such frail merchandis
and now he harold quaritch wa about to put forth thi second
ventur not of hi own desir or free will inde but becaus hi
reason and judgment were overmast in short he had fallen in
love with ida de la moll when he first saw her five year ago and
wa now in the process of discov the fact there he sat in hi
chair in the old halffurnish room which he propos to turn into
hi diningroom and groan in spirit over thi portent discoveri
what had becom of hi fair prospect of quiet year slope gentli
downward and warm with the sweet drowsi light of afternoon how wa
it that he had not known those thing that belong to hi peac and
probabl it would end in noth wa it like that such a splendid
young woman as ida would care for a superannu armi offic with
noth to recommend him beyond five or six hundr a year and a
victoria cross which he never wore probabl if she marri at all
she would try to marri someon who would assist to retriev the fallen
fortun of her famili which it wa absolut beyond hi power to
do altogeth the outlook did not pleas him as he sat there far
into the watch of the night and pull at hi empti pipe so littl
did it pleas him inde that when at last he rose to find hi wai
to bed up the old oak staircas the onli impos thing in molehil
he had almost made up hi mind to give up the idea of live at honham
at all he would sell the place and emigr to vancouv island or
new zealand and thu place an impass barrier between himself and
that sweet strong face which seem to have acquir a touch of
stern sinc last he look upon it five year ago
ah wise resolut of the quiet night whither do you go in the
garish light of dai to heaven perhap with the mist wreath and the
dew drop
when the squir got back to the castl he found hi daughter still
sit in the draw room
what not gone to bed ida he said
no father i wa go and then i thought that i would wait to hear
what all thi is about janter and the moat farm it is best to get it
over
ye ye my deary but there is not much to tell you janter ha
thrown up the farm after all and georg sai that there is not
anoth tenant to be had for love or monei he tri on man who said
that he would not have it at five shill an acr as price ar
that is bad enough in all conscienc said ida push at the
fireiron with her foot what is to be done
what is to be done answer her father irrit how can i tell
you what is to be done i suppos i must take the place in hand that
is all
ye but that cost monei doe it not
of cours it doe it cost about four thousand pound
well said ida look up and where is all that sum to come from
we have not got four thousand pound in the world
come from why i suppos that i must borrow it on the secur of the
land
would it not be better to let the place go out of cultiv rather
than risk so much monei she answer
go out of cultiv nonsens ida how can you talk like that why
that strong land would be ruin for a gener to come
perhap it would but sure it would be better that the land should
be ruin than that we should be father dear she said appealingli
lai on hand upon hi shoulder do be frank with me and tell me
what our posit realli is i see you wear yourself out about
busi from dai to dai and i know that there is never ani monei for
anyth scarc enough to keep the hous go and yet you will
not tell me what we realli oweand i think i have a right to know
the squir turn impati girl have no head for these thing
he said so what is the us of talk about it
but i am not a girl i am a woman of sixandtwenti and put
other thing asid i am almost as much interest in your affair as
you ar yourself she said with determin i cannot bear thi
sort of thing ani longer i see that abomin man mr quest
continu hover about here like a bird of illomen and i cannot
bear it and i tell you what it is father if you dont tell me the
whole truth at onc i shall cry and she look as though she meant
it
now the old squir wa no more impervi to a woman tear than ani
other man and of all ida mood and thei were mani he most greatli
fear that rare on which took the form of tear besid he love
hi onli daughter more dearli than anyth in the world except on
thing honham castl and could not bear to give her pain
veri well he said of cours if you wish to know about these
thing you have a right to i have desir to spare you troubl that
is all but as you ar so veri imperi the best thing that i can do
is to let you have your own wai still as it is rather late if you
have no object i think that i had better put if off till
tomorrow
no no father by tomorrow you will have chang your mind let us
have it now i want to know how much we realli ow and what we have
got to live on
the old gentleman hum and haw a littl and after variou
indic of impati at last began
well as you know our famili ha for some gener depend upon
the land your dear mother brought a small fortun with her five or
six thousand pound but that with the sanction of her truste wa
expend upon improv to the farm and in pai off a small
mortgag well for mani year the land brought in about two thousand
a year but somehow we alwai found it difficult to keep within that
incom for instanc it wa necessari to repair the gatewai and you
have no idea of the expens in which those repair land me then
your poor brother jame cost a lot of monei and alwai would have the
shoot kept up in such an extravag wai then he went into the
armi and heaven onli know what he spent there your brother wa veri
extravag my dear and well perhap i wa foolish i never could
sai him no and that wa not all of it for when the poor boi di he
left fifteen hundr pound of debt behind him and i had to find the
monei if it wa onli for the honour of the famili of cours you know
that we cut the entail when he came of ag well and then these
dread time have come upon the top of it all and upon my word at
the present moment i dont know which wai to turn and he paus and
drum hi finger uneasili upon a book
ye father but you have not told me yet what it is that we ow
well it is difficult to answer that all in a minut perhap twenti
five thousand on mortgag and a few float debt
and what is the place worth
it us to be worth between fifti and sixti thousand pound it is
imposs to sai what it would fetch now land is practic a drug
in the market but thing will come round my dear it is onli a
question of hold on
then if you borrow a fresh sum in order to take up thi farm you
will ow about thirti thousand pound and if you give five per cent
as i suppos you do you will have to pai fifteen hundr a year in
interest now father you said that in the good time the land
brought in two thousand a year so of cours it cant bring in so
much now therefor by the time that you have paid the interest
there will be noth or less than noth left for us to live on
her father winc at thi cruel and convinc logic
no no he said it is not so bad as that you jump to conclus
but realli if you do not mind i am veri tire and should like to go
to bed
father what is the us of try to shirk the thing just becaus it
is disagre she ask earnestli do you suppos that it is more
pleasant to me to talk about it than it is for you i know that you
ar not to blame about it i know that dear jame wa veri thoughtless
and extravag and that the time ar crush but to go on like
thi is onli to go to ruin it would be better for us to live in a
cottag on a coupl of hundr a year than to try to keep our head
abov water here which we cannot do sooner or later these peopl
quest or whoever thei ar will want their monei back and then if
thei cannot have it thei will sell the place over our head i
believ that man quest want to get it himselfthat is what i believ
and set up as a countri gentleman father i know it is a dread
thing to sai but we ought to leav honham
leav honham said the old gentleman jump up in hi agit
what nonsens you talk ida how can i leav honham it would kill me
at my ag how can i do it and besid who is to look after the
farm and all the busi no no we must hang on and trust to
provid thing mai come round someth mai happen on can never
tell in thi world
if we do not leav honham then honham will leav us answer hi
daughter with convict i do not believ in chanc chanc
alwai go the wrong wayagainst those who ar look for them we
shall be absolut ruin that is all
well perhap you ar right perhap you ar right my dear said
the old squir wearili i onli hope that my time mai come first i
have live here all my life seventi year and more and i know that i
could not live anywher els but god will be done and now my
dear go to bed
she leant down and kiss him and as she did so saw that hi ey
were fill with tear not trust herself to speak for she felt
for him too deepli to do so she turn awai and went leav the old
man sit there with hi grei head bow upon hi breast

take our chanc
meanwhil georg had mount hi cart and depart upon the road to
boisingham urg hi fat poni along as though he meant to be there
in twenti minut but so soon as he wa well out of reach of the
squir shout and sight of the castl gate he deliber turn
up a bye lane and jog along for a mile or more to a farm where he

he quietli made hi wai to hi own littl place where he proceed to
comfort get hi breakfast remark to hi wife that he wa of
opinion that there wa no hurri about the squir letter as the

countri lawyer offic stamp and there at the tabl sat mr quest
himself
mr quest wa a man of about forti year of ag rather under than
over with a pale ascet cast of face and a quiet and pleasant
though somewhat reserv manner hi featur were in no wai

set in hi head ow to some curiou error of natur for wherea hi
gener tone wa dark hi hair in particular be jet black these
ey were grei and jar extraordinarili upon their companion
featur for the rest he wa a man of some presenc and with the

about it but georg i cant possibl get up to the castl at
eleven i have got a churchwarden meet at a quarter to about
that west pinnacl you know it is in a most danger condit and
bythewai befor you go i should like to have your opinion as a
practic man as to the best wai to deal with it to rebuild it would
cost a hundr and twenti pound and that is more than we see our wai
to at present though i can promis fifti if thei can scape up the
rest but about the squir i think that the best thing i can do will
be to come up to the castl to lunch and then i can talk over matter
with him stai i will just write him a note bythewai you would
like a glass of wine wouldnt you georg nonsens man here it is
in the cupboard a glass of wine is a good friend to have handi
sometim
georg who like most men of hi stamp could put awai hi share of
liquor and feel thank for it drank hi glass of wine while mr
quest wa engag in write the note wonder meanwhil what made
the lawyer so civil to him for georg did not like mr quest inde
it would not be too much to sai that he hate him but thi wa a
feel which he never allow to appear he wa too much afraid of
the man for that and in hi queer wai too much devot to the old
squir interest to run the risk of imperil them by the
exhibit of ani avers to mr quest he knew more of hi master
affair than anybodi live unless perhap it wa mr quest
himself and wa awar that the lawyer held the old gentleman in a
bondag that could not be broken now georg wa a man with fault
he wa somewhat sly and perhap within certain line at time
capabl of give the word honesti a liber interpret but
amongst mani other he had on conspicu virtu he love the old
squir as a highlandman love hi chief and would almost if not
quit have di to serv him hi billet wa no easi on for mr de
la moll temper wa none of the best at time and when thing went
wrong as thei pretti frequent did he wa exceedingli apt to visit
hi wrath on the head of the devot georg sai thing to him
which he should not have said but hi retain took it all in the
dai work and never bore malic continu in hi own cadg
pighead sort of wai to labour earli and late to prop up hi master
broken fortun lord sir as he onc said to harold quaritch when
the colonel condol with him after a violent and unjust onslaught
made by the squir in hi presenc lord sir that aint nawth
that aint i dont pai no manner of heed to that folk du sai how as
i wor made for he like a safeti walv for a traction engin
inde had it not been for georg contriv and procrastin
honham castl and it owner would have part compani long befor
chapter vii
edward cossei esquir
after georg had drunk hi glass of wine and given hi opinion as to
the best wai to deal with the danger pinnacl on the boisingham
church he took the note unti the fat poni and ambl off to
honham leav the lawyer alon as soon as he wa gone mr quest
threw himself back in hi chairan old oak on bythewai for he
had a veri pretti tast in old oak and a posit mania for collect
itand plung into a brown studi
present he leant forward unlock the top drawer of hi write
tabl and extract from it a letter address to himself which he
had receiv that veri morn it wa from the princip of the
great bank firm of cossei and son and date from their head offic
in minc lane thi letter ran as follow
privat and confidenti
dear sir
we have consid your report as to the extens mortgag which
we hold upon the honham castl estat and have allow due
weight to your argument as to the advis of allow mr de
la moll time to give thing a chanc of right but we must
tell you that we can see no prospect of ani such solut of the
matter at ani rate for some year to come all the inform
that we ar abl to gather point to a further decreas in the
valu of the land rather than to a recoveri the interest on the
mortgag in question is moreov a year in arrear probabl ow
to the nonreceipt of rent by mr de la moll under these
circumst much as it griev us to take action against mr de
la moll with whose famili we have had deal for five
gener we can see no altern to foreclosur and herebi
instruct you to take the necessari preliminari step to bring it
about in the usual manner we ar presum that mr de la moll
is not in a posit to pai off the mortgag quit awar of the
risk of a forc sale and shall not be astonish if in the
present unpreced condit of the land market such a sale
should result in a loss although the sum recover doe not
amount to half the valuat of the estat which wa undertaken
at our instanc about twenti year ago on the occas of the
first advanc the onli altern howev would be for us to
enter into possess of the properti or to bui it in but thi
would be a cours total inconsist with the usual practic of
the bank and what is more our confid in the stabil of
land properti is so utterli shatter by our recent experi
that we cannot burden ourselv by such a cours prefer to
run the risk of an immedi loss thi howev we hope that the
histor charact of the properti and it great natur
advantag as a residenti estat will avert or at the least
minimis
be so good as to advis us by an earli post of the step you take
in pursuanc of these instruct
we ar dear sir
your obedi servant
cossei son
w quest esq
pswe have thought it better to address you direct in thi
matter but of cours you will commun the content of thi
letter to mr edward cossei and subject to our instruct
which ar final act in consult with him
well said mr quest to himself as he fold up the sheet of paper
that is about as straight as it can be put and thi is the time that
the old gentleman choos to ask for anoth four thousand he mai
ask but the answer will be more than he bargain for
he rose from the chair and began to walk up and down the room in
evid perplex if onli he said i had twentyf thousand i
would take up the mortgag myself and foreclos at my leisur it
would be a good invest at that figur even as thing ar and
besid i should like to have that place twentyf thousand onli
twentyf thousand and now when i want it i have not got it and i
should have had it if it had not been for that tiger that devil
edith she ha had more than that out of me in the last ten year and
still she is threaten and cry for more more more tiger ye
that is the name for her her own name too she would coin on
vital into monei if she could all bell fortun she ha had or
nearli all and now she want anoth five hundr and she will have
it too
here we ar and he drew a letter from hi pocket written in a bold
but somewhat uneduc woman hand
dear bill it ran iv been unlucki again and drop a pot shall
want 500 pound by the 1st octob no shuffl mind monei down
but i think that you know me too well to plai ani more larx when can
you tear yourself awai and come and give your e a look bring
some tin when you come and we will have timesthin the tiger
the tiger ye the tiger he gasp hi face work with passion
and hi grei ey glint as he tore the epistl to fragment threw
them down and stamp on them well be care that i dont on dai
cut your claw and paint your stripe by heaven if ever a man felt
like murder i do now five hundr more and i havent five thousand
clear in the world truli we pai for the folli of our youth it
make me mad to think of those fool cossei and son forc that place
into the market just now there a fortun in it at the price in
anoth year or two i might have recov myselfthat devil of a
woman might be deadand i have sever iron in the fire some of
which ar sure to turn up trump sure there must be a wai out of it
somehow there a wai out of everyth except death if onli on
think enough but the thing is to find it and he stop in hi
walk opposit to the window that look upon the street and put hi
hand to hi head
as he did so he caught sight of the figur of a tall gentleman
stroll idli toward the offic door for a moment he stare at him
blankli as a man doe when he is try to catch the vagu clue to a
new idea then as the figur pass out of hi view he brought hi
fist down heavili upon the sill
edward cossei by georg he said aloud there the wai out of it
if onli i can work him and unless i have made a strang mistak i
think i know the road
a coupl of minut afterward a tall shape young man of about
twentyfour or five year of ag came stroll into the offic where
mr quest wa sit to all appear hard at work at hi
correspond he wa dark in complexion and decidedli distinguish
look in featur with larg dark ey dark moustachio and a
pale somewhat spanishlook skin young as the face wa it had if
observ close a somewhat worn and worri air such as on would
scarc expect to see upon the counten of a gentleman born to
such brilliant fortun and so well fit by natur to do them
justic as wa mr edward cossei for it is not everi young man with
dark ey and a good figur who is destin to be the futur head of
on of the most wealthi privat bank in england and to inherit in
due cours a sum of monei in hard cash various estim at from
half a million to a million sterl thi howev wa the prospect
in life that open out befor mr edward cossei who wa now suppos
by hi old and emin businesslik father to be in process of
acquir a sound knowledg of the provinci affair of the hous by
attend to the work of their branch establish in the eastern
counti
how do you do quest said edward cossei nod somewhat coldli to
the lawyer and sit down ani busi
well ye mr cossei answer the lawyer rise respectfulli
there is some busi some veri seriou busi
inde said edward indiffer what is it
well it is thi the hous ha order a foreclosur on the honham
castl estatesat least it come to that
on hear thi intellig edward cossei whole demeanour underw
the most startl transformationhi languor vanish hi ey
brighten and hi form becam instinct with activ life and beauti
what the deuc he said and then paus i wont have it he went
on jump up i wont have it i am not particularli fond of old de
la moll perhap becaus he is not particularli fond of me he ad
rather drolli but it would be an infern shame to break up that
famili and sell the hous over them why thei would be ruin and
then there idamiss de la moll i meanwhat would becom of her
and the old place too after be in the famili for all these
centuri i suppos that it would be sold to some confound counter
skipper or some retir thief of a lawyer it must be prevent at ani
pricedo you hear quest
the lawyer winc a littl at hi chief contemptu allus and
then remark with a smile i had no idea that you were so
sentiment mr cossei or that you took such a live interest in
miss de la moll and he glanc up to observ the effect of hi
shot
edward cossei colour i did not mean that i took ani particular
interest in miss de la moll he said i wa refer to the
famili
oh quit so though im sure i dont know why you shouldnt miss de
la moll is on of the most charm women that i ever met i think
the most charm except my own wife bell and he again look up
suddenli at edward cossei who for hi part colour for the second
time
it seem to me went on the lawyer that a man in your posit ha
a most splendid opportun of plai knight errant to the love
damsel in distress here is the ladi with her ag father about to be
sold up and turn out of the estat which have belong to her
famili for generationswhi dont you do the gener and grace
thing like the hero in a novel and take up the mortgag
edward cossei did not reject thi suggest with the contempt that
might have been expect on the contrari he appear to be turn
the matter over in hi mind for he drum a littl tune with hi
knuckl and stare out of the window
what is the sum he said present
fiveandtwenti thousand and he want four more sai thirti
thousand
and where am i go to find thirti thousand pound to take up a
bundl of mortgag which will probabl never pai a farth of
interest why i have not got three thousand that i can come at
besid he ad recollect himself why should i interfer
i do not think answer mr quest ignor the latter part of the
question that with your prospect you would find it difficult to get
thirti thousand pound i know sever who would consid it an honour
to lend the monei to a cossei if onli for the sake of the
introductionthat is of cours provid the secur wa of a legal

mr quest wife
mr quest live in on of those ugli but comfortablybuilt old red
brick hous which abound in almost everi countri town and which give
us the clearest possibl idea of the want of tast and love of
materi comfort that characteris the ag in which thei were built
thi hous look out on to the market place and had a charm old
wall garden at the back famou for it nectarin which togeth
with the lawn tenni court wa as mr quest would sai almost
enough to consol her for live in a town the front door howev
wa onli separ by a littl flight of step from the pavement upon
which the hous abut
enter a larg coollook hall mr quest paus and ask a
servant who wa pass there where her mistress wa
in the drawingroom sir said the girl and follow by edward
cossei he walk down a long panel passag till he reach a door
on the left thi he open quickli and pass through into a
charm modernlook room handsom and even luxuri
furnish and light by french window open on to the wall
garden
a littl ladi dress in some black materi wa stand at on of
these window her arm cross behind her back and absent gaze
out of it at the sound of the open door she turn swiftli her
whole delic and love face light up like a flower in a rai of
sunshin the lip slightli part and a deep and happi light shine
in her violet ey then all in an instant it wa instruct to
observ how instantan her glanc fell upon her husband for
the ladi wa mr quest and her entir express chang to on of
cold avers the light fade out of her face as it doe from a
novemb sky and leav it cold and hard
mr quest who wa a man who saw everyth saw thi also and smile
bitterli
dont be alarm bell he said in a low voic i have brought mr
cossei with me
she flush up to the ey a great wave of colour and her breast
heav but befor she could answer edward cossei who had stop
behind to wipe some mud off hi shoe enter the room and polit
offer hi hand to mr quest who took it coldli enough
you ar an earli visitor mr cossei she said

cossei over to ask if you can give him a lift up to the castl thi
afternoon i have to go there to lunch and have borrow hi
dogcart
oh ye with pleasur but why cant the dogcart come back for mr
cossei
well you see put in edward there is a littl difficulti my
groom is ill but there is realli no reason why you should be
bother i have no doubt that a man can be found to bring it back
oh no she said with a shrug it will be all right onli you had
better lunch here that all becaus i want to start earli and go
to an old woman at the other end of honham about some fuchsia
cut
i shall be veri happi said he
veri well then that is settl said mr quest and now i must get
my plan and be off to the vestri meet im late as it is with
your permiss mr cossei i will order the dogcart as i pass your
room
certainli said edward and in anoth moment the lawyer wa gone
mr quest watch the door close and then sat down in a low armchair
and rest her head upon the back look up with a steadi enquir
gaze full into edward cossei face
and he too look at her and thought what a beauti woman she wa
in her own wai she wa veri small round in her figur almost to
stout and possess the tiniest and most beauti hand and
feet but her greatest charm lai in the face which wa almost
infantil in it shape and delic as a moss rose she wa
exquisit fair in colouringinde the darkest thing about her
were her violet ey which in some light look almost black by
contrast with her white forehead and wave auburn hair
present she spoke
ha my husband gone she said
i suppos so why do you ask
becaus from what i know of hi habit i should think it veri like
that he is listen behind the door and she laugh faintli
you seem to have a good opinion of him
i have exactli the opinion of him which he deserv she said
bitterli and my opinion of him is that he is on of the wickedest
men in england
if he is behind the door he will enjoi that said edward cossei
well if he is all thi why did you marri him
why did i marri him she answer with passion becaus i wa
forc into it bulli into it starv into it what would you do if
you were a defenceless motherless girl of eighteen with a drunken
father who beat youy beat you with a stickapologis in the
most gentlemanlik wai next morn and then went and got drunk again
and what would you do if that father were in the hand of a man like
my husband bodi and soul in hi hand and if between them pressur
wa brought to bear and brought to bear until at lastther what
is the good of go on it withyou can guess the rest
well and what did he marri you foryour pretti face
i dont know he said so it mai have had someth to do with it i
think it wa my ten thousand pound for onc i had a whole ten
thousand pound of my own my poor mother left it me and it wa ti
up so that my father could not touch it well of cours when i
marri my husband would not have ani settlement and so he took it
everi farth
and what did he do with it
spent it upon some other woman in londonmost of it i found him
out he gave her thousand of pound at onc
well i should not have thought that he wa so gener he said
with a laugh
she paus a moment and cover her face with her hand and then went
on if you onli knew edward if you had the faintest idea what my
life wa till a year and a half ago when i first saw you you would
piti me and understand why i am bad and passion and jealou and
everyth that i ought not to be i never had ani happi as a girl
how could i in such a home as oursand then almost befor i wa a
woman i wa hand over to that man oh how i hate him and what i
endur
ye it cant have been veri pleasant
pleasantbut there we have done with each other noww dont even
speak much except in public that my price for hold my tongu
about the ladi in london and on or two other littl thingsso what
is the us of talk of it it wa a horribl nightmar but it ha
gone and then she went on fix her beauti ey upon hi face
then i saw you edward and for the first time in my life i learnt
what love wa and i think that no woman ever love like that befor
other women have had someth to care for in their live i never had
anyth till i saw you it mai be wick but it true
he turn slightli awai and said noth
and yet dear she went on in a low voic i think it ha been on
of the hardest thing of allmi love for you for edward and she
rose and took hi hand and look into hi face with her soft full
ey full of tear i should have like to be a bless to you and
not a curs andanda caus of sin oh edward i should have made
you such a good wife no man could have had a better and i would have
help you too for i am not such a fool as i seem and now i shall do
noth but bring troubl upon you i know i shall and it wa my
fault too at least most of it dont ever think that i deceiv
myself for i dont i led you on i know i did i meant tother
think me as shameless as you like i meant to from the first and no
good can come of it i know that although i would not have it undon
no good can ever come of what is wrong i mai be veri wick but i
know that and she began to cry outright
thi wa too much for edward cossei who as ani man must had been
much touch by thi unexpect outburst look here bell he
blurt out on the impuls of the moment i am sick and tire of all
thi sort of thing for more than a year my life ha been noth but
a live lie and i cant stand it and that a fact i tell you what
it is i think we had better just take the train to pari and go off
at onc or els give it all up it is imposs to go on live in
thi atmospher of continu falsehood
she stop cry do you realli care for me enough for that
edward she said
ye ye he said somewhat impati you can see i do or i
should not make the offer sai the word and ill do it
she thought for a moment and then look up again no she said
no edward
why he ask ar you afraid
afraid she answer with a gestur of contempt what have i to be
afraid of do you suppos such women as i am have ani care for
consequ we have got beyond thatthat is for ourselv but we
can still feel a littl for other it would ruin you to do such a
thing social and in everi other wai you know you have often said
that your father would cut you out of hi will if you compromis
yourself and him like that
oh ye he would i am sure of it he would never forgiv the
scandal he ha a hatr of that sort of thing but i could get a few
thousand readi monei and we could chang our name and go off to a
coloni or someth
it is veri good of you to sai so she said humbl i dont deserv
it and i will not take advantag of you you will be sorri that you
made the offer by tomorrow ah ye i know it is onli becaus i
cri no we must go on as we ar until the end come and then you
can discard me for all the blame will follow me and i shall deserv
it too i am older than you you know and a woman and my husband
will make some monei out of you and then it will all be forgotten
and i shall have had my dai and go my own wai to oblivion like
thousand of other unfortun women befor me and it will be all the
same a hundr year henc dont you see but edward rememb on
thing dont plai me ani trick for i am not of the sort to bear it
have patienc and wait for the end these thing cannot last veri
long and i shall never be a burden on you dont desert me or make me
jealou for i cannot bear it i cannot inde and i do not know
what i might domak a scandal or kill myself or you im sure i
cant sai what you nearli sent me wild the other dai when you were
carri on with miss de la molleah ye i saw it alli have
suspect you for a long time and sometim i think that you ar
realli in love with her and now sir i tell you what it is we have
had enough of thi melancholi talk to last me for a month why did you
come here at all thi morn just when i want to get you out of my
head for an hour or two and think about my garden i suppos it wa a
trick of mr quest bring you here he ha got some fresh scheme
on i am sure of it from hi face well it cant be help and
sinc you ar here mr edward cossei tell me how you like my new
dress and she pose herself and courtesi befor him black you
see to match my sin and show off my complexion doesnt it fit
well
charmingli he said laugh in spite of himself for he felt in no
laugh mood and now i tell you what it is bell i am not go
to stop here all the morn and lunch and that sort of thing it
doe not look well to sai the least of it the probabl is that
half the old women in boisingham have got their ey fix on the hall
door to see how long i stai i shall go down to the offic and come
back at halfpast two
a veri nice excus to get rid of me she said but i daresai you
ar right and i want to see about the garden there goodby and
mind you ar not late for i want to have a nice drive round to the
castl not that there is much need to warn you to be in time when you
ar go to see miss de la moll is there goodby goodby
chapter ix
the shadow of ruin
mr quest walk to hi vestri meet with a smile upon hi thin
gentlemanlylook face and rage and bitter in hi heart
i caught her that time he said to himself she can do a good deal
in the wai of deceit but she cant keep the blood out of her cheek
when she hear that fellow name but she is a clever woman bell is
how well she manag that littl busi of the luncheon and how
well she fought her case when onc she got me in a cleft stick about
edith and that monei of her and made good term too ah that the
worst of it she ha the whip hand of me there if i could ruin her
she could ruin me and it no us cut off on nose to spite
your face well my fine ladi he went on with an omin flash of
hi grei ey i shall be even with you yet give you enough rope and
you will hang yourself you love thi fellow i know that and it will
go hard if i cant make him break your heart for you bah you dont
know the sort of stuff men ar made of if onli i did not happen to be
in love with you myself i should not care ifah here i am at the
church
the human anim is a veri complic machin and can conduct the
work of an extraordinari number of differ interest and set of
idea almost if not entir simultan for instanc mr
questseat at the right hand of the rector in the vestri room of
the beauti old boisingham church and engag in an anim and
even warm discuss with the senior curat on the detail of
fourteenth centuri church work in which he clearli took a live
interest and understood far better than did the curatewould have
been exceedingli difficult to identifi with the scheme vindict
creatur whom we have just follow up the church path but after all
that is the wai of human natur although it mai not be the wai of
those who try to draw it and who love to paint the villain black as
the evil on and the virtuou heroin so radiant that we begin to
fanci we can hear the whisper of her wing few peopl ar
altogeth good or altogeth bad inde it is probabl that the vast
major ar neither good nor badthei have not the strength to be
the on or the other here and there howev we do meet a spirit
with suffici will and origin to press the scale down thi wai
or that though even then the oppos forc be it good or evil is
constantli strive to bring the balanc equal even the most wick
men have their redeem point and righteou instinct nor ar their
thought continu fix upon iniqu mr quest for instanc on
of the evil genius of thi histori wa where hi plot and
passion were not immedi concern a man of emin gener
and refin tendenc mani were the good turn contradictori as it
mai seem that he had done to hi poorer neighbour he had even been
known to forego hi bill of cost which is about the highest and
rarest exhibit of earthli virtu that can be expect from a
lawyer he wa moreov emin a cultur man a reader of the
classic in translat if not in the origin a man with a fine
tast in fiction and poetri and a realli sound and ripe
archaeolog knowledg especi where sacr build were
concern all hi instinct also were toward respect hi
most burn ambit wa to secur a high posit in the counti in
which he live and to be class among the resid gentri he hate
hi lawyer work and long to accumul suffici mean to be
abl to give it the goodby and to indulg himself in an exist of
luxuri and learn leisur such as he wa he had made himself for
he wa the son of a poor and inferior countri dentist and had begun
life with a good educ it is true which he chiefli ow to hi
own exert but with noth els had hi natur been a temper
natur with a balanc of good to it credit to draw upon instead of a
balanc of evil he wa a man who might have gone veri far inde for
in addit to hi natur abil he had a great power of work but
unfortun thi wa not the case hi instinct on the whole were
evil instinct and hi passionswheth of hate or love or greed
when thei seiz him did so with extraordinari violenc render him
for the time be utterli callou to the right or feel of
other provid that he attain hi end in short had he been born
to a good posit and a larg fortun it is quit possibl
provid alwai that hi strong passion had not at some period of
hi life led him irremedi astrai that he would have live
virtuou and respect and di in good odour leav behind him a
happi memori but fate had place him in antagon with the world
and yet had endow him with a gnaw desir to be of the world as
it appear most desir to him and then to complet hi ruin
circumst had thrown him into temptat from which inexperi
and the headlong strength of hi passion gave him no opportun to
escap
it mai at first appear strang that a man so calcul and whose
desir seem to be fix upon such a materi end as the acquir
by artific or even fraud of the wealth which he covet should also
nourish in hi heart so bitter a hatr and so keen a thirst for
reveng upon a woman as mr quest undoubtedli did toward hi
beauti wife it would have seem more probabl that he would have
left heroic alon and attempt to turn hi wife folli into a mean
of wealth and selfadvanc and thi would no doubt have been so
had mr quest estim of hi motiv in marri her been an
entir correct on she had told edward cossei it will be
rememb that her husband had marri her for her moneyth ten
thousand pound of which he stood so badli in need now thi wa the
truth to a certain extent and a certain extent onli he had want
the ten thousand pound in fact at the moment monei wa necessari to
him but and thi hi wife had never known or realis he had been
and still wa also in love with her possibl the ten thousand pound
would have prove a suffici induc to him without the love but
the love wa none the less there their relat howev had never
been happi on she had detest him from the fist and had not
spare to sai so no man with ani refinementand whatev he lack
mr quest had refinementcould bear to be thu continu repuls
by a woman and so it came to pass that their intercours had alwai
been of the most strain natur then when she at last had obtain
the clue to the secret of hi life under threat of exposur she drove
her bargain of which the term were complet separ in all but
outward form and virtual freedom of action for herself thi
consid the posit she wa perhap justifi in do but her
husband never forgav her for it more than that he determin if by
ani mean it were possibl to turn the passion which although she
did not know it he wa perfectli awar she bore toward hi busi
superior edward cossei to a refin instrument of vengeanc against
her with what success it will be on of the purpos of thi histori
to show
such put as briefli as possibl were the outlin of the charact
and aim of thi remark and contradictori man
within an hour and a half of leav hi own hous the oak as it
wa call although the tree from which it had been so name had
long sinc vanish from the garden mr quest wa bowl swiftli
along behind edward cossei power bai hors toward the tower
gatewai of honham castl when he wa within three hundr yard an
idea struck him he pull the hors up sharpli for he wa alon in
the dogcart and paus to admir the view
what a beauti place he reflect to himself with enthusiasm
and how grandli those old tower stand out against the sky the
squir ha restor them veri well too there is no doubt about it i
could not have done it better myself i wonder if that place will ever
be mine thing look black now but thei mai come round and i think i
am begin to see my wai
and then he start the hors on again reflect on the unpleas
natur of the busi befor him person he both like and
respect the old squir and he certainli piti him though he would
no more have dream of allow hi like and piti to interfer with
the prosecut of hi scheme than an ardent sportsman would dream
of not shoot pheasant becaus he had happen to take a friendli
interest in their nurtur he had also a certain gentlemanlik
distast to be the bearer of crush bad new for mr quest
dislik scene possibl becaus he had such an intim person
acquaint with them whilst he wa still wonder how he might
best deal with the matter he pass over the moat and through the
ancient gatewai which he admir so fervent and found himself in
front of the hall door here he pull up look about for somebodi
to take hi hors when suddenli the squir himself emerg upon him
with a rush
hullo quest is that you he shout as though hi visitor had
been fifti yard off instead of five i have been look out for
you here william william crescendo william fortissimo
where on earth is the boi i expect that idl fellow georg ha
been send him on some of hi errand instead of attend to them
himself whenev he is want to take a hors he is nowher to be
found and then it is pleas sir mr georg that what he call
him pleas sir mr georg sent me up to the moat farm or somewher
to see how mani egg the hen laid last week or someth of the
sort that a veri nice hors you have got there by the wai veri
nice inde
it is not my hors mr de la moll said the lawyer with a faint
smile it is mr edward cossei
oh it mr edward cossei is it answer the old gentleman with
a sudden chang of voic ah mr edward cossei well it a veri
good hors anyhow and i suppos that mr cossei can afford to bui
good hors
just then a faint cry of come sir come wa heard and a long
hobbledehoi kind of youth whose busi it wa to look after the
not extens castl stabl emerg in a great heat from round the
corner of the hous
now where on earth have you been began the squir in a stentorian
tone
if you pleas sir mr georg
there what did i tell you broke in the squir have i not told
you time after time that you ar to mind your own busi and leav
mr georg to mind hi now take that hors round to the stabl
and see that it is properli fed
come quest come in we have a quarter of an hour befor luncheon
and can get our busi over and he led the wai through the passag
into the tapestri and panel vestibul where he took hi stand
befor the empti fireplac
mr quest follow him stop ostens to admir a particularli
fine suit of armour which hung upon the wall but realli to gain
anoth moment for reflect
a beauti suit of the earli stuart period mr de la moll he
said i never saw a better
ye ye that belong to old sir jame the on whom the roundhead
shot
what the sir jame who hid the treasur
ye i wa tell that stori to our new neighbour colonel quaritch
last nighta veri nice fellow by the wai you should go and call
upon him
i wonder what he did with it said mr quest
ah so do i and so will mani anoth i dare sai i wish that i
could find it im sure it want badli enough nowadai but that
remind me quest you will have gather my difficulti from my note
and what georg told you you see thi man janterthank to that
confound fellow major boston and hi action about those colleg
landsha thrown up the moat farm and georg tell me that there is
not anoth tenant to be had for love or monei in fact you know what
it is on cant get tenant nowadai thei simpli ar not to be
had well under these circumst there is of cours onli on
thing to be done that i know of and that is to take the farm in hand
and farm it myself it is quit imposs to let the place fall out
of cultivationand that is what would happen otherwis for if i were
to lai it down in grass it would cost a consider sum and be seven
or eight year befor i got ani return
the squir paus and mr quest said noth
well he went on that be so the next thing to do is to obtain
the necessari cash to pai janter hi valuat and stock the place
about four thousand would do it or perhap he ad with an access
of gener confid we had better sai five there ar about fifti
acr of those lowli meadow which want to be thoroughli bush
drainedbush ar quit as good as pipe for that stiff land if
thei put in the right sort of stuff and it dont cost half so much
but still it cant be done for noth and then there is a new wagon
shed want and some odd and end ye we had better sai five
thousand
still mr quest made no answer so onc more the squir went on
well you see under these circumstancesnot be abl to lai hand
upon the necessari capit from my privat resourc of cours i have
made up my mind to appli to cossei and son for the loan inde
consid how long and intim ha been the connect between
their hous and the de la moll famili i think it right and proper to
do so inde i should consid it veri wrong of me if i neglect to
give them the opportun of the investmenther a faint smile
flicker for an instant on mr quest face and then went outof
cours thei will as a matter of busi requir secur and veri
properli so but as thi estat is unentail there will fortun
be veri littl difficulti about that you can draw up the necessari
deed and i think that under the circumst the right thing to do
would be to charg the moat farm specif with the amount thing
ar bad enough no doubt but i can hardli suppos it possibl under
ani conceiv circumst that the farm would not be good for five
thousand pound howev thei might perhap prefer to have a gener
claus as well and if it is so although i consid it quit
unnecessari i shall rais no object to that cours
then at last mr quest broke hi somewhat omin silenc
i am veri sorri to sai mr de la moll he said gentli that i can
hold out no prospect of cossei and son be induc under ani
circumst to advanc anoth pound upon the secur of the
honham castl estat their opinion of the valu of land properti
as secur ha receiv so sever a shock that thei ar not at all
comfort as to the safeti of the amount alreadi invest
mr de la moll start when he heard thi most unexpect bit of
new for which he wa total unprepar he had alwai found it
possibl to borrow monei and it had never occur to him that a time
might perhap come in thi countri when the land which he held in
almost superstiti vener would be so valueless a form of
properti that lender would refus it as secur
why he said recov himself the total encumbr on the
properti do not amount to more than twentyf thousand pound and
when i succeed to my father forti year ago it wa valu at
fifti and the castl and premis have been thoroughli repair sinc
then at a cost of five thousand and most of the farm build too
veri possibl de la moll but to be honest i veri much doubt if
honham castl and the land round it would now fetch twentyf
thousand pound on a forc sale competit and radic agit
have brought estat down more than peopl realis and land in
australia and new zealand is now worth almost as much per acr as
cultiv land in england perhap as a residenti properti and on
account of it histor interest it might fetch more but i doubt
it in short mr de la moll so anxiou ar cossei and son in the
matter that i regret to have to tell you that so far from be
will to make a further advanc the firm have formal instruct
me to serv the usual six month notic on you call in the monei
alreadi advanc on mortgag togeth with the interest which i must
remind you is nearli a year overdu and thi step i propos to take
tomorrow
the old gentleman stagger for a moment and caught at the
mantelpiec for the blow wa a heavi on and as unexpect as it wa
heavi but he recov himself in an instant for it wa on of the
peculiar of hi charact that hi spirit alwai seem to rise
to the occas in the face of urgent adversityin short he
possess an extraordinari share of moral courag
inde he said indignantli inde it is a piti that you did not
tell me that at onc mr quest it would have save me from put
myself in a fals posit by propos a busi arrang which
is not accept as regard the interest i admit that it is as you
sai and i veri much regret it that stupid fellow georg is alwai so
dreadfulli behindhand with hi account that i can never get anyth
settl he did not state and inde did not know that the reason
that the unfortun georg wa behindhand wa that there were no
account to make up or rather that thei were all on the wrong side of
the ledger i will have that matter seen to at onc of cours
busi peopl ar quit right to consid their due and i do not
blame messr cossei in the matter not in the least still i must
sai that consid the long and intim relationship that ha for
nearli two centuri exist between their hous and my famili thei
mightwellhav shown a littl more consider
ye said mr quest i daresai that the step strike you as a harsh
on to be perfectli frank with you mr de la moll it struck me as
a veri harsh on but of cours i am onli a servant and bound to
carri out my instruct i sympathis with you veri muchveri much
inde
oh dont do that said the old gentleman of cours other
arrang must be made and much as it will pain me to termin
my connect with messr cossei thei shall be made
but i think went on the lawyer without ani notic of hi
interrupt that you misunderstand the matter a littl cossei and
son ar onli a trade corpor whose object is to make monei by
lend it or otherwiseat all hazard to make monei the kind of
feel that you allud to and that might induc them in
consider of long intimaci and close connect in the past to
forego the opportun of so do and even to run a risk of loss is
a thing which belong to former gener but the present is a
strictli commerci ag and we ar the most commerci of the trade
nation cossei and son move with the time that is all and thei
would rather sell up a dozen famili who had dealt with them for two
centuri than lose five hundr pound provid of cours that
thei could do so without scandal and loss of public respect which
where a bank hous is concern also mean a loss of custom i am
a great lover of the past myself and believ that our ancestor wai
of do busi were on the whole better and more charit than
our but i have to make my live and take the world as i find it
mr de la moll
quit so quest quit so answer the squir quietli i had no
idea that you look at these matter in such a light certainli the
world ha chang a good deal sinc i wa a young man and i do not
think it ha chang much for the better but you will want your
luncheon it is hungri work talk about foreclosur mr quest had
not us thi unpleas word but the squir had seen hi drift
come into the next room and he led the wai to the drawingroom
where ida wa sit read the time
ida he said with an affect of hearti which did not

chapter x
the tenni parti
ida shook hand coldli enough with the lawyer for whom she cherish
a dislik not unmix with fear mani women ar by natur gift with
an extraordinari power of intuit which fulli make up for their
defici in reason forc thei do not conclud from the premiss
of their observ thei know that thi man is to be fear and
that trust in fact thei share with the rest of breath creation
that selfprotect instinct of instantan and almost automat
judgment given to guard it from the danger with which it is
continu threaten at the hand of man overmast strength
and order intellig ida wa on of these she knew noth to
mr quest disadvantag inde she alwai heard him spoken of with
great respect and curious enough she like hi wife but she could
not bear the man feel in her heart that he wa not onli to be
avoid on account of hi own hidden qualiti but that he wa
moreov an activ person enemi
thei went into the diningroom where the luncheon wa set and while
ida allow mr quest to cut her some cold boil beef an oper
in which he did not seem to be veri much at home she came to a rapid
conclus in her own mind she had seen clearli enough from her
father face that hi interview with the lawyer had been of a most
seriou charact but she knew that the chanc were that she would
never be abl to get it upshot out of him for the old gentleman had
a curiou habit of keep such unpleas matter to himself until he
wa absolut forc by circumst to reveal them she also knew
that her father affair were in a most critic condit for thi
she had extract from him on the previou night and that if ani
remedi wa to be attempt it must be attempt at onc and on some
heroic scale therefor she made up her mind to ask her bete noir
mr quest what the truth might be
mr quest she said with some trepid as he at last
triumphantli hand her the beef i hope you will forgiv me for
ask you a plain question and that if you can you will favour me
with a plain answer i know my father affair ar veri much
involv and that he is now anxiou to borrow some more monei but i
do not know quit how matter stand and i want to learn the exact
truth
i am veri glad to hear you speak so miss de la moll answer the
lawyer becaus i wa try to make up my mind to broach the
subject which is a pain on to me frankli thenforg me for
sai it your father is absolut ruin the interest on the
mortgag is a year in arrear hi largest farm ha just been thrown
upon hi hand and to complet the tale the mortgage ar go to
call in their monei or foreclos
at thi statement which wa almost brutal in it brief
comprehens ida turn pale as death as well she might and
drop her fork with a clatter upon the plate
i did not realis that thing were quit so bad she murmur then
i suppos that the place will be taken from us and we shallshal
have to go awai
ye certainli unless monei can be found to take up the mortgag
of which i see no chanc the place will be sold for what it will
fetch and that nowadai will be no great sum
when will that be she ask
in about six or nine month time
ida lip trembl and the sight of the food upon her plate becam
nauseou to her a vision aros befor her mind ey of herself and
her old father depart hand in hand from the castl gate behind
and about which gleam the hard wild light of a march sunset to
seek a place to hide themselv the vivid horror of the phantasi
almost overcam her
is there no wai of escap she ask hoars to lose thi place
would kill my father he love it better than anyth in the world
hi whole life is wrap up in it
i can quit understand that miss de la moll it is a most charm
old place especi to anybodi interest in the past but
unfortun mortgage ar no respect of feel to them land
is so much properti and noth more
i know all that she said impati you do not answer my
question and she lean toward him rest her hand upon the
tabl is there no wai out of it
mr quest drank a littl claret befor he answer ye he said i
think that there is if onli you will take it
what wai she ask eagerli
well though as i said just now the mortgage of an estat as a
bodi ar mere a busi corpor and look at thing from a
busi point of view onli you must rememb that thei ar compos
of individu and that individu can be influenc if thei can be
got at for instanc cossei and son ar an abstract and harshli
dispos in their abstract capac but mr edward cossei is an
individu and i should sai so far as thi particular matter is
concern a benevol dispos individu now mr edward cossei
is not himself at the present moment actual on of the firm of
cossei and son but he is the heir of the head of the hous and of
cours ha author and what is better still the command of
monei
i understand said ida you mean that my father should try to win
over mr edward cossei unfortun to be frank he dislik him
and my father is not a man to keep hi dislik to himself
peopl gener do dislik those to whom thei ar crushingli
indebt your father dislik mr cossei becaus hi name is cossei
and for no other reason but that is not quit what i meanti do not
think that the squir is the right person to undertak a negoti
of the sort he is a littl too outspoken and incauti no miss de
la moll if it is to be done at all you must do it you must put
the whole case befor him at oncethi veri afternoon there is no
time for delai you need not enter into detail he know all about
themonli ask him to avert thi catastroph he can do so if he
like how he doe it is hi own affair
but mr quest said ida how can i ask such a favour of ani man i
shall be put myself in a dreadfulli fals posit
i do not pretend miss de la moll that it is a pleasant task for
ani young ladi to undertak i quit understand your shrink from
it but sometim on ha to do unpleas thing and make compromis
with on selfrespect it is a question whether or no your famili
shall be utterli ruin and destroi there is as i honestli
believ no prospect whatev of your father be abl to get the
monei to pai off cossei and son and if he did it would not help him
becaus he could not pai the interest on it under these circumst
you have to choos between put yourself in an equivoc posit
and let event take their cours it would be useless for anybodi
els to undertak the task and of cours i cannot guarante that even
you will succe but i will not minc mattersa you doubtless know
ani man would find it hard to refus a favour ask by such a
suppliant and now you must make up your own mind i have shown you a
path that mai lead your famili from a posit of the most immin
peril if you ar the woman i take you for you will not shrink from
follow it
ida made no repli and in anoth moment the squir came in to take a
coupl of glass of sherri and a biscuit but mr quest furtiv
watch her face said to himself that she had taken the bait and
that she would do it shortli after thi a divers occur for the
clergyman mr jeffri a pleasant littl man with a round and
shine face and a most uncler eyeglass came up to consult the
squir upon some matter of parish busi and wa shown into the
diningroom ida took advantag of hi appear to effect a retreat
to her own room and there for the present we mai leav her to her
medit
no more busi wa discuss by the squir that afternoon inde it
interest mr quest who wa abov all thing a student of charact
to observ how wonderfulli the old gentleman threw off hi troubl to
listen to him energet argu with the rev mr jeffri as to
whether or no it would be proper as had hitherto been the custom to
devot the proce of the harvest festiv collect 1 pound 18
3d and a brass button to the counti hospit or whether it should
be appli to the repair of the woodwork in the vestri wa under the
circumst most instruct the rev mr jeffri who suffer
sever from the condit of the vestri at last gain hi point by
triumphantli show that no patient from honham had been admit to
the hospit for fifteen month and that therefor the hospit had
no claim on thi particular year wherea the draught in the vestri
wa enough to cut ani clergyman in two
well well said the old gentleman i will consent for thi year
and thi year onli i have been churchwarden of thi parish for
between forti and fifti year and we have alwai given the harvest
festiv collect to the hospit and although under these
except circumst it mai possibl be desir to diverg from
that custom i cannot and will not consent to such a thing in a
perman wai so i shall write to the secretari and explain the
matter and tell him that next year and in the futur gener the
collect will be devot to it origin purpos
great heaven ejacul mr quest to himself and the man must
know that in all human probabl the place will be sold over hi
head befor he is a year older i wonder if he put it on or if he
deceiv himself i suppos he ha live here so long that he cannot
realis a condit of thing under which he will ceas to live here
and the place will belong to somebodi els or perhap he is onli
brazen it out and then he stroll awai to the back of the hous
and had a look at the condit of the outhous reflect that some
of them would be sadli expens to repair for whoever came into
possess here after that he cross the moat and walk through the
somewhat extens plantat at the back of the hous wonder if
it would not be possibl to get enough timber out of them if on went
to work judici to pai for put the place in order present
he came to a hedgerow where a row of veri fine timber oak had stood
of which the squir had been notori fond and of which he had
himself taken particular and admir notic in the cours of the
previou winter the tree were gone in the hedg where thei had
grown were a seri of gap like those in an old woman jaw and the
ground wa still litter with remain of bark and branch and of
faggot that had been made up from the brushwood
cut down thi spring fell wa mr quest ejacul poor old
gentleman he must have been pinch befor he consent to part with
those oak
then he turn and went back to the hous just in time to see ida
guest arriv for the lawn tenni parti ida herself wa stand on
the lawn behind the hous which border as it wa by the moat and
at the further end by a row of ruin arch wa on of the most
picturesqu in the countri and a veri effect set to ani young
ladi as the peopl came thei were shown through the hous on to the
lawn and here she wa receiv them she wa dress in a plain
tightfit gown of blue flannel which show off her perfect
figur to great advantag and a broadbrim hat that shade her
fine and dignifi face mr quest sat down on a bench beneath the
shade of an arbutu watch her close and inde if the studi of
a perfect english ladi of the noblest sort ha ani charm he wa not
without hi reward there ar some womenmost of us know on or two
who ar born to hold a great posit and to sail across the world
like a swan through meaner fowl it would be veri hard to sai to what
their peculiar charm and digniti is ow it is not to beauti onli
for though thei have presenc mani of these women ar not beauti
while some ar even plain nor doe it spring from nativ grace and
tact alon though these thing must be present rather perhap it is
the reflect of a cultiv intellect act upon a natur pure
and elev tempera which make these ladi conspicu and
fashion them in such kind that all men put asid the mere charm
of beauti and the natur soften of judgment in the atmospher of
sex must recognis in them an equal mind and a presenc more nobl
than their own
such a woman wa ida de la moll and if ani on doubt it it wa
suffici to compar her in her simplic to the variou human item
by whom she wa surround thei were a typic counti societi
gather such as need no descript and would not greatli
interest if describ neither veri good nor veri bad veri handsom
nor veri plain but move religi within the line of custom and
on the ground of commonplac
it is no wonder then that a woman like ida de la moll wa facil
princep among such compani or that harold quaritch who wa
somewhat poetic inclin for a man of hi ag at ani rate where
the ladi in question wa concern should in hi heart have compar
her to a queen even bell quest love as she undoubtedli wa in her
own wai pale and look shopgirlish in face of that gentl digniti
a fact of which she wa evid awar for although the two women
were friendli noth would induc the latter to stand long near ida
in public she would tell edward cossei that it made her look like a
wax doll besid a live child
while mr quest wa still watch ida with complet satisfact for
she appeal to the artist side of hi natur colonel quaritch
arriv upon the scene look mr quest thought particularli plain
with hi solid form hi long thin nose light whisker and squar
massiv chin also he look particularli impos in contrast to the
youth and maiden and domest clergymen there wa a graviti
almost a solemn about hi bronz counten and deliber
order convers which did not howev favour impress the
aforesaid youth and maiden if a judgment might be form from such
sampl of convers critic as mr quest heard go on on the
further side of hi arbutu
chapter xi

when ida saw the colonel come she put on her sweetest smile and
took hi outstretch hand

of earnest which struck him as peculiar for of cours he did not
know the new that she had just heard from mr quest
then for the first time for mani year harold quaritch deliv
himself of a speech that might have been capabl of a tender and
hidden mean

must go and sai how do you do
harold quaritch look round feel unreason irrit at thi
interrupt to hi littl advanc and for the first time saw edward
cossei he wa come along in the wake of mr quest look veri
handsom and rather languid when their ey met and to speak the
truth the colonel first impress wa not a complimentari on
edward cossei wa in some wai not a bad fellow but like a great mani
young men who ar born with silver spoon in their mouth he had mani
air and grace on of which wa the affect of treat older
and better men with an assumpt of offhanded and even of
superior that wa rather obnoxi thu while ida wa greet mr
quest he wa engag in take in the colonel in a wai which
irrit that gentleman consider
present ida turn and introduc colonel quaritch first to mr
quest and then to mr cossei harold bow to each and then stroll
off to meet the squir whom he note advanc with hi usual arrai
of protect towel hang out of hi hat and for a while saw

tooah there he is
as he wa speak the squir who wa walk past with colonel
quaritch with the object of show him the view from the end of the
moat suddenli came face to face with edward cossei he at onc
step forward to greet him but to hi surpris wa met by a cold
and most state bow from mr de la moll who pass on without
vouchsaf a singl word
old idiot ejacul mr quest to himself he will put cossei
back up and spoil the game
well said edward aloud and colour almost to hi ey that old
gentleman know how to be insol
you must not mind him mr cossei answer quest hastili the poor
old boi ha a veri good idea of himselfh is dreadfulli injur
becaus cossei and son ar call in the mortgag after the famili
ha dealt with them for so mani gener and he think that you
have someth to do with it
well if he doe he might as well be civil it doe not particularli
inclin a fellow to go asid to pull him out of the ditch just to be
cut in that fashioni have half a mind to order my trap and go
no no dont do thatyou must make allow you must inde
look here is miss de la moll come to ask you to plai tenni
at thi moment ida arriv and took off edward cossei with her not a
littl to the relief of mr quest who began to fear that the whole
scheme wa spoil by the squir unfortun magnific of manner
edward plai hi game have ida herself as hi partner it cannot
be said that the set wa a pleasant on for the latter who poor
woman wa do her utmost to bring up her courag to the point
necessari to the carri out of the appeal ad misericordiam which
she had decid to make as soon as the game wa over howev chanc
put an opportun in her wai for edward cossei who had a curiou
weak for flower ask her if she would show him her
chrysanthemum of which she wa veri proud she consent readili
enough thei cross the lawn and pass through some shrubberi
reach the greenhous which wa place at the end of the castl
itself here for some minut thei look at the flower just now
burst into bloom ida who felt exceedingli nervou wa all the
while wonder how on earth she could broach so delic a subject
when fortun mr cossei himself gave her the necessari open
i cant imagin miss de la moll he said what i have done to
offend your fatherh almost cut me just now
ar you sure that he saw you mr cossei he is veri absentmind
sometim
oh ye he saw me but when i offer to shake hand with him he onli
bow in rather a crush wai and pass on
ida broke off a scarlet turk from it stem and nervous began to
pick the bloom to piec
the fact is mr cosseyth fact is my father and inde i also
ar in great troubl just now about monei matter you know and my
father is veri apt to be prejudicedin short i rather believ that
he think you mai have someth to do with hi difficultiesbut
perhap you know all about it
i know someth miss de la moll said he grave and i hope and
trust you do not believ that i have anyth to do with the action
which cossei and son have thought fit to take
no no she said hastili i never thought anyth of the sortbut
i know that you have influenceand well to be plain mr cossei i
implor of you to us it perhap you will understand that thi is
veri humili for me to be oblig to ask thi though you can
never guess how humili believ me mr cossei i would never
ask it for myself but it is for my fatherh love thi place better
than hi life it would be much better he should die than that he
should be oblig to leav it and if thi monei is call in that is
what must happen becaus the place will be sold over us i believ he
would go mad i do inde and she stop speak and stood befor
him the fragment of the flower in her hand her breast heav with
emot
what do you suggest should be done miss de la moll said edward
cossei gentli
i suggest thatthatif you will be so kind you should persuad
cossei and son to forego their intent of call in the monei
it is quit imposs he answer my father order the step
himself and he is a hard man it is imposs to turn him if he
think he will lose monei by turn you see he is a banker and ha
been handl monei all hi life till it ha becom a sort of god to
him realli i do believ that he would rather beggar everi friend he
ha than lose five thousand pound
then there is no more to be said the place must go that all
repli ida turn awai her head and affect to busi herself in
remov some dri leav from a chrysanthemum plant edward
watch her howev saw her shoulder shake and a big tear fall like
a raindrop on the pavement and the sight strongli attract as he
wa and had for some time been toward the young ladi wa altogeth
too much for him in an instant move by an overwhelm impuls and
someth not unlik a gust of passion he came to on of those
determin which so often chang the whole cours and tenour of
men live
miss de la moll he said rapidli there mai be a wai found out of
it
she look up enquiringli and there were the tear stain on her face
somebodi might take up the mortgag and pai off cossei and son
can you find anyon who will she ask eagerli
no not as an invest i understand that thirti thousand pound
ar requir and i tell you frankli that as time ar i do not for
on moment believ the place to be worth that amount it is all veri
well for your father to talk about land recov itself but at
present at ani rate nobodi can see the faintest chanc of anyth
of the sort the probabl ar on the contrari that as the
american competit increas land will gradual sink to someth
like a prairi valu
then how can monei be got if nobodi will advanc it
i did not sai that nobodi will advanc it i said that nobodi would
advanc it as an investmenta friend might advanc it
and where is such a friend to be found he must be a veri
disinterest friend who would advanc thirti thousand pound
nobodi in thi world is quit disinterest miss de la moll or at
ani rate veri few ar what would you give to such a friend
i would give anyth and everyth over which i have control in
thi world to save my father from see honham sold over hi head
she answer simpli
edward cossei laugh a littl that is a larg order he said
miss de la moll i am dispos to try and find the monei to take
up these mortgag i have not got it and i shall have to borrow it
and what is more i shall have to keep the fact that i have borrow
it a secret from my father
it is veri good of you said ida faintli i dont know what to
sai
for a moment he made no repli and look at him ida saw that hi
hand wa trembl
miss de la moll he said there is anoth matter of which i wish
to speak to you men ar sometim put into strang posit partli
through their own fault partli by forc of circumst and when in
those posit ar forc down path that thei would not follow
suppos miss de la moll that mine were some such posit and
suppos that ow to that posit i could not sai to you word
which i should wish to sai
ida began to understand now and onc more turn asid
suppos howev that at some futur time the difficulti of that
posit of which i have spoken were to fade awai and i were then to
speak those word can you suppos all thistel me how thei would
be receiv
ida paus and thought she wa a strongnatur and clearhead
woman and she fulli understood the posit on her answer would
depend whether or no the thirti thousand pound were forthcom and
therefor whether or no honham castl would pass from her father and
her race
i said just now mr cossei she answer coldli that i would give
anyth and everyth over which i have control in the world to
save my father from see honham sold over hi head i do not wish to
retract those word and i think that in them you will find an answer
to your question
he colour you put the matter in a veri businesslik wai he
said
it is best put so mr cossei she answer with a faint shade of
bitter in her tone it preserv me from feel under an
obligationwil you see my father about these mortgag
ye tomorrow and now i will sai goodby to you and he took her
hand and with some littl hesit kiss it she made no
resist and show no emot
ye she answer we have been here some time mr quest will
wonder what ha becom of you
it wa a random arrow but it went straight home and for the third
time that dai edward cossei redden to the root of hi hair without
answer a word he bow and went
when ida saw thi she wa sorri she had made the remark for she had
no wish to appear to mr cossei the conquest of whom gave her neither
pride nor pleasur in the light of a spite or worst still of a
jealou woman she had inde heard some talk about him and mr
quest but not be of a scandallov disposit it had not
interest her and she had almost forgotten it now howev she
learn that there wa someth in it
so that is the difficult posit of which he talk she said to
herself he want to marri me as soon as he can get mr quest off
hi hand and i have consent to that alwai provid that mr
quest can be dispos of in consider of the receipt of a sum of
thirti thousand pound and i do not like the man it wa not nice of
him to make that bargain though i brought it on myself i wonder if
my father will ever know what i have done for him and if he will
appreci it when he doe well it is not a bad pricethirti
thousand poundsa good figur for ani woman in the present state of
the market and with a hard and bitter laugh and a prescienc of
sorrow to come ly at the heart she threw down the remain of the
scarlet turk and turn awai

georg prophesi
ida for obviou reason said noth to her father of her interview
with edward cossei and thu it came to pass that on the morn
follow the lawn tenni parti there wa a veri seriou consult
between the faith georg and hi master it appear to ida who
wa ly awak in her room to commenc somewher about daybreak and
it certainli continu with short interv for refresh till
eleven oclock in the forenoon first the squir explain the whole
question to georg at great length and with a most extraordinari
multipl of detail for he began at hi first loan from the hous
of cossei and son which he had contract a great mani year befor
all thi while georg sat with a veri long face and tri to look as
though he were follow the thread of the argument which wa not
possibl for hi master had long ago lost it himself and wa mix
up the loan of 1863 with the loan of 1874 and the monei rais in the
sever of the entail with both in a wai which would have driven
anybodi except georg who wa us to thi sort of thing perfectli
mad howev he sat it through and when at last the account wa
finish remark that thing sartainli did look queer
thereupon the squir call him a stupid owl and have by mean of
some test question discov that he knew veri littl of the detail
which had just been explain to him at such portent length in
spite of the protest of the wretch georg who urg that thei
didnt seem to be git no forrad somehow he began and went
through everi word of it again
thi brought them to breakfast time and after breakfast georg
account were thoroughli gone into with the result that confus wa
soon wors confound for either georg could not keep account or
the squir could not follow them ida sit in the drawingroom
could occasion hear her father ejaculatori outburst after thi
kind

hundr and fifti not three hundr and fifti follow by a no
no squir you be alook on the wrong sidethem there is the
dibit and so on till both parti were fairli plai out and the
onli thing that remain clear wa that the balanc wa consider
on the wrong side
well said the squir at last there you ar you see it appear
to me that i am absolut ruin and upon my word i believ that it

the place will be sold if anybodi can be found to bui it the de la
moll have been here between four and five centuri and thei got it
by marriag with the boissei who got it from the norman king and
now it will go to the hammer and be bought by a pictur dealer or a
manufactur of brandi or someon of that sort well everyth ha
it end and god will be done

emot i cant bear to hear you talk like that and what more it

so there no get over it unless you can find thirti thousand

of a miracl can save it that alwai your wai oh someth will
turn up someth will turn up

and that the truth becaus i knaw it and so help me godand if im
wrong it a master on
the squir who wa stride up and down the room in hi irrit
stop suddenli in hi walk and look at hi retain with a sharp
and search gaze upon hi nobl featur notwithstand hi
prejudic hi simplic and hi occasion absurd he wa in
hi own wai an abl man and an excel judg of human natur even
hi prejudic were as a rule found upon some solid ground onli it
wa as a gener rule imposs to get at it also he had a share of
that marvel instinct which when it exist regist the mental
altitud of the mind of other with the accuraci of an aneroid he
could tell when a man word rang true and when thei rang fals and
what is more when the convict of the true and the falsiti of the
fals rest upon a substanti basi of fact or error of cours the
instinct wa a vagu and from it natur an undefin on but it
exist and in the present instanc aros in strength he look at
the ugli melancholi counten of the faith georg with that keen
glanc of hi and observ that for the moment it wa almost
beautifulbeauti in the light of convict which shone upon it
he look and it wa born in upon him that what georg said wa
true and that georg knew it wa true although he did not know where
the light of truth came from and as he look half the load fell from
hi heart
hullo georg ar you turn prophet in addit to your other
occup he said cheerfulli and as he did so edward cossei
splendid bai hors pull up at the door and the bell rang
well he ad as soon as he saw who hi visitor wa unless i am
much mistaken we shall soon know how much truth there is in your
propheci for here come mr cossei himself
befor georg could suffici recov from hi recent agit to
make ani repli edward cossei look particularli handsom and
rather overpow wa shown into the room
the squir shook hand with him thi time though coldli enough and
georg touch hi forelock and said sarvant sir in the approv
fashion thereon hi master told him that he might retir though he
wa to be sure not to go out of hear as he should want him again
present
veri well sir answer georg ill just step up to the poplar
i told a man to be round there todai as i want to see if i can come
to an understand with him about thi year fell in the big wood
there said the squir with an express of infinit disgust
there that just like your wai your horrid cadg wai the idea
of tell a man to be round about the poplar sometim or other
todai becaus you want to speak to him about a fell why didnt
you write him a letter like an ordinari christian and make an offer
instead of dodg him round a farm for half a dai like a wild indian
besid the poplar is half a mile off if it a yard
lord sir said georg as he retir that aint the wai that folk
in these part like to do busi that aint letter write is all
veri well for london and other furrin but it dont do here
besid sir i shall hear you well enough up there sarvant sir
thi to edward cossei and he wa gone
edward burst out laugh and the squir look after hi retain
with a comic air
no wonder that the place ha got into a mess with such a fellow as
that to manag it he said aloud the idea of hunt a man round
the poplar farm likelik an indian squaw he a regular cadger
that what he is and that all he fit for howev it hi wai
of do busi and i shant alter him well mr cossei he went
on thi is a veri sad state of affair at ani rate so far as i am
concern i presum of cours that you know of the step which have
been taken by cossei and son to forc a foreclosur for that is what
it amount to though i have not as yet receiv the formal notic
inde i suppos that those step have been taken under your advic
ye mr de la moll i know all about it and here is the notic
call in the loan and he place a fold paper on the tabl
ah said the squir i see as i remark to your manag mr
quest yesterdai i think that consid the natur of the
relationship which ha exist for so mani gener between our
famili and the busi firm of which you ar a member consid
too the peculiar circumst in which the owner of land find
themselv at thi moment and the ruinou lossto put question of
sentiment asidethat must be inflict by such sale upon the owner of
properti more consider might have been shown howev it is
useless to try to make a silk purs out of a sow ear or to get
blood from a stone so i suppos that i must make the best of a bad
joband with a most polit bowi realli do not know that i have
anyth more to sai to you mr cossei i will forward the notic to
my lawyer inde i think that it might have been sent to them in the
first instanc
edward cossei had all thi while been sit on an old oak chair hi
ey fix upon the ground and slowli swing hi hat between hi
leg suddenli he look up and to the squir surpris said quietli
i quit agre with you i dont think that you can sai anyth too
bad about the behaviour of my peopl a shoreditch jew could not have
done wors and look here mr de la moll to come to the point and
prevent misunderstand i mai as well sai at onc that with your
permiss i am anxiou to take up these mortgag myself for two
reason i regard them as a desir invest even in the present
condit of land and also i wish to save cossei and son from the
discredit of the step which thei medit
for the second time that morn the squir look up with the sharp
and search gaze he occasion assum and for the second time
hi instinct for he wa too headi a man to reason overmuch came into
plai and warn him that in make thi offer edward cossei had other
motiv than those which he had brought forward he paus to consid
what thei might be wa he anxiou to get the estat for himself wa
he put forward by somebodi els quest perhap or wa it someth
to do with ida the first altern seem the most probabl to him
but whatev the lender object the result to him wa the same it
gave him a respit for mr de la moll well knew that he had no more
chanc of rais the monei from an ordinari sourc than he had of
alter the condit of agricultur
hum he said thi is an import matter a most import matter
i presum mr cossei that befor make thi definit offer you have
consult a legal advis
oh ye i have done all that and am quit satisfi with the secur
an advanc of thirti thousand charg on all the honham castl
estat at four per cent the question now is if you ar prepar to
consent to the transfer in that case all the old charg on the
properti will be paid off and mr quest who will act for me in the
matter will prepar a singl deed charg the estat for the round
total
ah ye the plan seem a satisfactori on but of cours in so
import a matter i should prefer to consult my legal advis befor
give a final answer inde i think that it would be better if the
whole affair were carri out in a proper and formal wai
sure sure mr de la moll said the younger man with some
irrit for the old gentleman somewhat magnific manner rather
annoi him which under the circumst wa not unnatur sure
you do not want to consult a legal advis to make up your mind as to
whether or no you will allow a foreclosur i offer you the monei at
four per cent cannot you let me have an answer now ye or no
i dont like be hurri i cant bear to be hurri said the
squir pettishli these import matter requir consider a
great deal of consider still he ad observ sign of
increas irrit upon edward cossei face and not have the
slightest intent of throw awai the opportun though he would
dearli have like to prolong the negoti for a week or two if it
wa onli to enjoi the illusori satisfact of dabbl with such a
larg sum of monei still as you ar so press about it i realli
speak off hand can see no object to your take up the
mortgag on the term you mention
veri well mr de la moll now i have on my part on condit and
on onli to attach to thi offer of mine which is that my name is not
mention in connect with it i do not wish cossei and son to know
that i have taken up thi invest on my own account in fact so
necessari to me is it that my name should not be mention that if it
doe transpir befor the affair is complet i shall withdraw my
offer and if it transpir afterward i shall call the monei in the
loan will be advanc by a client of mr quest is that understood
between us
hum said the squir i dont quit like thi secreci about these
matter of busi but still if you make a point of it why of
cours i cannot object
veri good then i presum that you will write offici to cossei
and son state that the monei will be forthcom to meet their
variou charg and the overdu interest and now i think that we have
had about enough of thi busi for onc so with your permiss i
will pai my respect to miss de la moll befor i go
dear me said the squir press hi hand to hi head you do
hurri me so dreadfullyi realli dont know where i am miss de la
moll is out i saw her go out sketch myself sit down and we will
talk thi busi over a littl more
no thank you mr de la moll i have to talk about monei everi dai
of my life and i soon have enough of the subject quest will arrang
all the detail goodby dont bother to ring i will find my
hors and with a shake of the hand he wa gone
ah said the old gentleman to himself when hi visitor had depart
he ask for ida so i suppos that is what he is after but it is a
queer sort of wai to begin court and if she find it out i should
think that it would go against him ida is not the sort of woman to be
won by a monei consider well she can veri well look after
herself that certain anywai it ha been a good morn work but
somehow i dont like that young man ani the better for it i have it
there someth want he is not quit a gentleman well i must
find that fellow georg and he rush to the front door and roar
for georg till the whole place echo and the pheasant crow in
the wood
after a while there came faint answer yell of come squir

swiftli up the garden
well said hi master who wa in high good humour did you find

up a treemeasur it
no squir i dont rightli know what he wor after but he is a
curiou kind of a chap and he said he had a fanci to wait there
good heaven no wonder the place is go to ruin when you deal
with men who have a fanci to transact their busi up a tree well
never mind that i have settl the matter about the mortgag of
cours somebodi a client of mr quest ha been found without the
least difficulti to take them up at four per cent and advanc the
other five thousand too so that there be no more anxieti about that
well that a good job at ani rate answer georg with a sigh of
relief
a good job of cours it a good job but it is no more than i
expect it wasnt like that such an elig invest as thei

but that just the wai with you the moment there a hitch you come
with your long face and your uneduc sort of wai and swear that we
ar all ruin and that the countri is break up and that there

georg reflect that the squir had forgotten that not an hour befor
he himself had been vow that thei were ruin while he georg
had stoutli sworn that someth would turn up to help them but hi
back wa accustom to those vicari burden nor to tell the truth
did thei go nigh to the break of it

mine
chapter xiii
about art
edward cossei drove from the castl in a far from happi frame of mind
to begin with the squir and hi condescend wai of do busi
irrit him veri much so much that onc or twice in the cours of
the convers he wa within an ac of break the whole thing off
and onli restrain himself with difficulti from do so as it wa
notwithstand all the sacrific and monei risk which he wa
undergo to take up these mortgag and thei were veri consider
even to a man of hi great prospect he felt that he had been place
in the posit of a person who receiv a favour rather than of a
person who grant on moreov there wa an assumpt of superior
about the old man a visibl recognit of the gulf which us to be
fix between the gentleman of famili and the man of busi who ha
grown rich by trade in monei and monei worth which wa the more
gall becaus it wa found on actual fact and edward cossei knew
it all hi foibl and odditi notwithstand it would have been
imposs for ani person of discern to entertain a comparison
between the halfruin squir and the young banker who would shortli
be worth between half a million and a million sterl the former wa
a repres though a somewhat errat on of all that is best
in the old type of englishmen of gentl blood which is now so rapidli
vanish and of the class to which to a larg extent thi countri
ow her great hi veri eccentr were wander light that
show unsuspect height and depth in hi characterlov of
countri and hi countri honour respect for the religion of hi
father loyalti of mind and valour for the right had he live in
other time like some of the old boissei and de la moll who were
at honham befor him he would probabl have di in the crusad or
at cressi or perhap more uselessli for hi king at marston moor or
like that last but on of the true de la moll kneel in the
courtyard of hi castl and defi hi enemi to wring hi secret
from him now few such opportun ar left to men of hi stamp and
thei ar perhap as a consequ dy out of an ag which is
unsuit to them and inde to most strong growth of individu
charact it would be much easier to deal with a gentleman like the
squir of thi histori if we could onli reach down on of those suit
of armour from the wall of hi vestibul and put it on hi back and
take that long twohandl sword which last flash on flodden field
from it restingplac beneath the clock and at the end see him die
as a loyal knight should do in the forefront of hi retain with
the old war cry of a delamola delamol upon hi lip as it is
he is an aristocrat anachron an entiti unfit to deal with the
element of our advanc and in some wai emascul ag hi bodi
should have been where hi heart wasin the past what chanc have
such as he against the quest of thi polit era of polit economi
and penni paper
no wonder that edward cossei felt hi inferior to thi symbol and
type of the thing that no more ar ye even in the shadow of hi
thirti thousand pound for here we have a differ breed goldsmith
two centuri ago then banker from gener to gener monei
bee seek for wealth and count it and hive it from decad to
decad till at last gold becam to them what honour is to the nobler
stockth pervad principl and the clink of the guinea and the
rustl of the bank note stir their blood as the clank of arm
men and the sound of the flap banner with it three golden hawk
flame in the sun wa wont to set the heart of the race of boissei
of dofferleigh and of de la moll beat to that tune to which
england march on to win the world
it is a foolish and vain thing to scoff at busi and those who do
it in the market place and to shout out the old war cri of our
father in the face of a gener which sing the song of capit
or groan in heavi labour beneath the banner of their copyright
trade mark and besid who would bui our book also copyright
except in america if we did let us rather rise up and cloth
ourselv and put a tall hat upon our head and do homag to the new
democraci
and yet in the depth of our heart and the quiet of our chamber let
us sometim cry to the old dai and the old men and the old wai of
thought let us cry av atqu valehail and farewel our
father armour hang abov the door their portrait decor the
wall and their fierc and halftam heart moulder beneath the
stone of yonder church hail and farewel to you our father
perchanc a man might have had wors compani than he met with at your
board and even have found it not more hard to die beneath your
swordcut than to be gentli cozen to the grave by duli qualifi
practition at two guinea a visit
and the upshot of all thi is that the squir wa not altogeth wrong
when he declar in the silenc of hi chamber that edward cossei
wa not quit a gentleman he show it when he allow himself to be
guid by the art of mr quest into the adopt of the idea of
obtain a lien upon ida to be enforc if conveni he show it
again and what is more he commit a huge mistak when tempt
thereto by the opportun of the moment he made a condit
bargain with the said ida wherebi she wa place in pledg for a sum
of thirti thousand pound well know that her honour would be equal
to the test and that if conveni to him she would be readi to pai
the debt he made a huge mistak for had he been quit a gentleman
he would have known that he could not have adopt a wors road to the
affect of a ladi had he been content to advanc the monei and
then byandby though even that would not have been gentlemanlik
have gentli let transpir what he had done at great person expens
and inconveni her imagin might have been touch and her
gratitud would certainli have been excit but the idea of
bargain the idea of purchas which after what had pass could
never be put asid would of necess be fatal to ani hope of tender
feel shylock might get hi bond but of hi own act he had
debar himself from the possibl of ever get more
now edward cossei wa not lack in that afterglow of refin
which is left by a cours of public school and univers educ
no educ can make a gentleman of a man who is not a gentleman at
heart for whether hi station in life be that of a ploughboi or an
earl the gentleman like the poet is born and not made but it can
and doe if he be of an observ natur give him a certain insight
into the habit of thought and probabl cours of action of the
member of that class to which he outwardli and by reput belong
such an insight edward cossei possess and at the present moment it
possess wa troubl him veri much hi trade instinct the
desir bred in him to get someth for hi monei had led him to make
the bargain but now that it wa done hi better judgment rose up
against it for the truth mai as well be told at onc although he
would as yet scarc acknowledg it to himself edward cossei wa
alreadi violent enamour of ida he wa by natur a passion man
and as it chanc she had prove the magnet with power to draw hi
passion but as the reader is awar there exist anoth
complic in hi life for which he wa not perhap entir
respons when still quit a youth in mind he had suddenli found
himself the object of the love of a beauti and enthral woman
and had after a more or less sever struggl yield to the
temptat as out of a book mani young men would have done now to
be the object of the violent affect of such a woman as bell quest
is no doubt veri flatter and even charm for a while but if that
affect is not return in kind if in short the gentleman doe not
love the ladi quit as warmli as she love him then in cours of time
the charm is apt to vanish and even the flatteri to ceas to give
pleasur also when as in the present case the connect is wrong in
itself and univers condemn by societi the affect which can
still triumph and endur on both side must be of a veri strong and
last order even an unprincipl man dislik the act of on
long lie such as an intimaci of the sort necessarili involv and if
the man happen to be rather weak than unprincipl the dislik is
apt to turn to loath some portion of which will certainli be
reflect on to the partner of hi illdo
these ar gener principl but the case of edward cossei offer no
except to them inde it illustr them well he had never been
in love with mr quest to begin with she had shown herself too much
in love with him to necessit ani displai of emot on hi part
her violent and unreason passion weari and alarm him he never
knew what she would do next and wa kept in a continu condit of
anxieti and irrit as to what the morrow might bring forth too
sure of her unalt attach to have ani pretext for jealousi he
found it exceedingli irksom to be oblig to avoid give caus for
it on hi side which howev he dread do lest he should
therebi bring about some overwhelm catastroph mr quest wa as
he well knew not a woman who would paus to consid consequ if
onc her passion jealousi were realli arous it wa even doubt
if the certainti of her own ruin would check her her love wa
everyth to her it wa her life the thing she live for and
rather than tame lose it it seem extrem probabl to edward
cossei that she would not hesit to face shame or even death
inde it wa through thi great passion of her and through it onli
that he could hope to influenc her if he could persuad her to
releas him by point out that a continu of the intrigu must
involv him in ruin of some sort all might yet go well with him if
not hi futur wa a dark on
thi wa the state of affair befor he becam attach to ida de la
moll after which the horizon grew blacker than ever at first he
tri to get out of the difficulti by avoid ida but it did not
answer she exercis an irresist attract over him her calm
and state presenc wa to him what the sight of mountain snow is to
on scorch by continu heat he wa weari of passion outburst
tear agoni alarm presenti and all the paraphernalia of
secret love it appear to him look up at the beauti snow
that if onc he could reach it life would be all sweet and light
that there would be no more thirst no more fear and no more forc
march through those illodour quagmir of deceit the more he
allow hi imagin to dwell upon the pictur the fiercer grew
hi long to possess it also he knew well enough that to marri a
woman like ida de la moll would be the greatest bless that could
happen to him for she would of necess lift him up abov himself
she had littl monei it wa true but that wa a veri minor matter to
him and she had birth and breed and beauti and a presenc which
command homag and so it came to pass that he fell deepli and yet
more deepli in love with ida and that as he did so hi connect
with mr quest although we have seen him but yesterdai offer in a
pass fit of tender and remors to run awai with her becam
more and more irksom to him and now as he drove leisur back to
boisingham he felt that he had imperil all hi hope by a rash
indulg in hi trade instinct
present the road took a turn and a sight wa reveal that did not
tend to improv hi alreadi irrit mood just here the roadwai wa
border by a deep bank cover with tree which slope down to the
vallei of the ell at thi time of the year look it loveliest in
the soft autumn light and here seat on a bank of turf beneath the
shadow of a yellow chestnut tree in such posit as to get a view
of the green vallei and flash river where cattl red and white
stood chew the still luxuri aftermath wa none other than ida
herself and what wa more ida accompani by colonel quaritch thei
were seat on campstool and in front of each of them wa an easel
clearli thei were paint togeth for as edward gaze the colonel
rose came up close behind hi companion stool made a ring of hi
thumb and first finger gaze critic through it at the ladi
perform then sadli shook hi head and made some remark thereupon
ida turn round and began an anim discuss
hang me said edward to himself if she ha not taken up with that
confound old militari frump paint togeth ah i know what that
mean well i should have thought that if there wa on man more than
anoth whom she would have dislik it would have been that
batteredlook colonel
he pull up hi hors and reflect for a moment then hand the
rein to hi servant jump out and climb through a gap in the
fenc walk up to the tree so engross were thei in their argument
that thei neither saw nor heard him
it nonsens colonel quaritch perfect nonsens if you will
forgiv me for tell you so ida wa sai with warmth it is all
veri well for you to complain that my tree ar a blur and the castl
noth but a splotch but i am look at the water and if i am
look at the water it is quit imposs that i should see the
tree and the cow otherwis than i have render them on the canva
true art is to paint what the painter see and as he see it
colonel quaritch shook hi head and sigh
the cant of the impressionist school he said sadli on the
contrari the busi of the artist is to paint what he know to be
there and he gaze complac at hi own canva which had the
appear of a spirit draw of a fortifi place or of the
content of a child noah ark so stiff so solid so formid
were it outlin tree and anim
ida shrug her shoulder laugh merrili and turn round to find
herself face to face with edward cossei she start back and her
express hardenedthen she stretch out her hand and said how do
you do in her veri coldest tone
how do you do miss de la moll he said assum as unconcern an
air as he could and bow stiffli to harold quaritch who return
the bow and went back to hi canva which wa place a few pace off
i saw you paint went on edward cossei in a low tone so i
thought i would come and tell you that i have settl the matter with
mr de la moll
oh inde answer ida hit vicious at a wasp with her paint
brush well i hope that you will find the invest a satisfactori
on and now if you pleas do not let us talk ani more about monei
becaus i am quit tire of the subject then rais her voic she
went on come here colonel quaritch and mr cossei shall judg
between us and she point to her pictur

the happi dai
thi is a troublesom world enough but thank to that mitig fate
which now and again interfer to our advantag there do come to most
of us time and period of exist which if thei do not quit
fulfil all the condit of ideal happi yet go near enough to
that end to permit in after dai of our imagin that thei did so i
sai to most of us but in do so i allud chiefli to those class
commonli known as the upper by which is understood those who have
enough bread to put into their mouth and cloth to warm them those
too who ar not the present subject of remorseless and hideou
ailment who ar not daili agonis by the sight of their famish
offspr who ar not doom to beat out their live against the
madhous bar or to see their heart belov and their most
cherish hope wither toward that cold space from whenc no messag
come for such unfortun and for their millionnumb kin upon
the globeth victim of war famin slave trade oppress usuri
overpopul and the curs of competit the rai of light must
be few inde few and far between onli just enough to save them from
utter hopeless and even to the favour on the well warm and
well fed who ar to a great extent lift by fortun or by their
nativ strength and wit abov the degrad of the world thi
light of happi is but as the gleam of star uncertain fit
and continu lost in cloud onli the utterli selfish or the
utterli ignor can be happi with the happi of savag or
children howev prosper their own affair for to the rest to
those who think and have heart to feel and imagin to realis
and a redeem human sympathi to be touch the mere weight of the
world miseri press round them like an atmospher the mere echo
of the groan of the dy and the cri of the children ar
suffici and more than suffici to dull ay to destroi the
promis of their joi but even to thi finer sort there do come rare
period of almost complet happinesslittl summer in the
tempestu climat of our year greenfring well of water in our
desert pure northern light break in upon our gloom and strang
as it mai seem these breadth of happi dai when the old question
ceas to torment and a man can trust in provid and without on
qualifi thought bless the dai that he wa born ar veri frequent
connect with the passion which is known as love that mysteri
symbol of our doubl natur that strang tree of life which with it
root suck their strength from the dustheap of human yet
spring aloft abov our level and bear it bloom in the face of
heaven
why it is and what it mean we shall perhap never know for certain
but it doe suggest itself that as the greatest terror of our be
li in the utter loneli the unspeak ident and unchang
selfcomplet of everi live creatur so the greatest hope and
the intensest natur yearn of our heart go out toward that
passion which in it fire heat ha the strength if onli for a littl
while to melt down the barrier of our individu and give to the
soul someth of the power for which it yearn of lose it sens of
solitud in convers with it kind for alon we ar from infanc to
deathw for the most part grow not more near togeth but rather
wider apart with the widen year where go the sympathi between
the parent and the child and where is the close old love of brother
for hi brother
the invis fate ar continu wrap us round and round with
the wind sheet of our solitud and none mai know all our heart
save he who made it we ar set upon the world as the star ar set
upon the sky and though in follow our fate orbit we pass and
repass and each shine out on each yet ar we the same lone light
roll obedi to law we cannot understand through space of which
none mai mark the measur
onli as sai the poet in word of truth and beauti
onli but thi is rare
when a belov hand is laid in our
when jade with the rush and glare
of the intermin hour
our ey can in anoth ey read clear
when our worlddeafen ear
is by the tone of a love voic caress
a bolt is shot back somewher in our breast
and a lost puls of feel stir again
and what we mean we sai and what we would we know
and then he think he know
the hill where hi life rose
and the sea whereunto it goe
some such indian summer of delight and forget of troubl and
the tragic condit of our dai wa now open to harold quaritch
and ida de la moll everi dai or almost everi dai thei met and went
upon their paint expedit and argu the point of the valid
or otherwis of the impressionist doctrin of art not that of all
thi paint came anyth veri wonder although in the even
the colonel would take out hi canvas and contempl their rigid
proport with singular pride and satisfact it wa a littl
weak of hi to think that he could paint and on of which he wa
somewhat tenaci like mani anoth man he could do a number of
thing exceedingli well and on thing veri badli and yet had more
faith in that bad thing than in all the good
but strang to sai although he affect to believ so firmli in hi
own style of art and hold ida in such cheap regard it wa a littl
paint of the latter that he valu most and which wa oftenest
put upon hi easel for purpos of solitari admir it wa on of
those veri impressionist product that fade awai in the distanc
and full of soft grei tint such as hi soul loath there wa a
tree with a blot of brown colour on it and altogeth though as a
matter of fact a clever thing enough from hi point of view of art it
wa utterli anathema thi littl pictur in oil faintli shadow
out himself sit at hi easel work in the soft grei of the
autumn even and ida had paint it and given it to him and that
wa why he admir it so much for to speak the truth our friend the
colonel wa go go fastsink out of sight of hi former self
into the depth of the love that possess hi soul
he wa a veri simpl and puremind man strang as it mai appear
sinc that first unhappi busi of hi youth of which he had never
been heard to speak no live woman had been anyth to him
therefor instead of becom further vulgaris and harden by
associ with all the odd and end of womankind that a man
travel about the globe come into contact with gener not
greatli to hi improv hi faith had found time to grow up
stronger even than at first onc more he look upon woman as a young
man look befor he ha had bitter experi of the worlda a be
to be vener and almost worship as someth better brighter
purer than himself hardli to be won and when won to be worn like a
jewel prize at onc for valu and for beauti
now thi is a danger state of mind for a man of three or four and
forti to fall into becaus it is a soft state and thi is a world in
which the softest ar apt to get the worst of it at four and forti a
man of cours should be hard enough to get the better of other
peopl as inde he gener is
when harold quaritch after that long interv set hi ey again
upon ida face he felt a curiou chang come over him all the vagu
idea and more or less poetic aspir which for five long year
had gather themselv about that memori took shape and form and in
hi heart he knew he love her then as the dai went on and he came
to know her better he grew to love her more and more till at last
hi whole heart went out toward hi late found treasur and she
becam more than life to him more than aught els had been or could
be seren and happi were those dai which thei spent in paint and
talk as thei wander about the honham castl ground by degre
ida slight but percept hard of manner wore awai and she
stood out what she wa on of the sweetest and most natur women in
england and with it all a woman have brain and forc of
charact
soon harold discov that her life had been anyth but an easi
on the constant anxieti about monei and her father affair had
worn her down and harden her till as she said she began to feel as
though she had no heart left then too he heard all her troubl about
her dead and onli brother jame how dearli she had love him and
what a sore troubl he had been with hi extravag wai and hi
continu demand for monei which had to be met somehow or other at
last came the crush blow of hi death and with it the certainti of
the extinct of the male line of the de la moll and she said that
for a while she had believ her father would never hold up hi head
again but hi vital wa equal to the shock and after a time the
debt began to come in which although he wa not legal bound to do
so her father would insist upon meet to the last farth for the
honour of the famili and out of respect for hi son memori thi
increas their monei troubl which had gone on and on alwai
get wors as the agricultur depress deepen till thing had
reach their present posit
all thi she told him bit by bit onli keep back from him the last
develop of the drama with the part that edward cossei had plai
in it and sad enough it made him to think of that ancient hous of de
la moll vanish into the night of ruin
also she told him someth of her own life how companionless it had
been sinc her brother went into the armi for she had no real friend
about honham and not even an acquaint of her own tast which
without be gushingli so were decidedli artist and intellectu
i should have wish she said to try to do someth in the
world i daresai i should have fail for i know that veri few women
meet with a success which is worth have but still i should have
like to try for i am not afraid of work but the current of my life
is against it the onli thing that is open to me is to strive and make
both end meet upon an incom which is alwai grow smaller and to
save my father poor dear from as much worri as i can
dont think that i am complain she went on hurriedli or that i
want to rush into pleasureseek becaus i do nota littl of that
goe a long wai with me besid i know that i have mani thing to be
thank for few women have such a kind father as mine though we do
quarrel at time of cours we cannot have everyth our own wai in
thi world and i daresai that i do not make the best of thing
still at time it doe seem a littl hard that i should be forc to
lead such a narrow life just when i feel that i could work in a wide
on
harold look up at her face and saw that a tear wa gather in her
dark ey and in hi heart he regist a vow that if by ani mean it
ever lai within hi power to improv her lot he would give everyth
he had to do it but all he said wa
dont be downheart miss de la moll thing chang in a wonder
wai and often thei mend when thei look worst you know he went on a
littl nervous i am an oldfashion sort of individu and i
believ in provid and all that sort of thing you see and that
matter gener come pretti well straight in the long run if peopl
deserv it
ida shook her head a littl doubtfulli and sigh
perhap she said but i suppos that we do not deserv it anyhow
our good fortun is a long while come and the convers
drop
still her friend strong belief in the efficaci of provid and
gener hi masculin sturdi did cheer her up consider
even the strongest women if thei have ani element that can be call
feminin left in them want somebodi of the other sex to lean on and
she wa no except to the rule besid if ida societi had charm
for colonel quaritch hi societi had almost if not quit as much
charm for her it mai be rememb that on the night when thei first
met she had spoken to herself of him as the kind of man whom she would
like to marri the thought wa a pass on and it mai be safe
said that she had not sinc entertain ani seriou idea of marriag
in connect with colonel quaritch the onli person whom there seem
to be the slightest probabl of her marri wa edward cossei and
the mere thought of thi wa enough to make the whole idea of
matrimoni repugn to her
but thi notwithstand dai by dai she found harold quaritch
societi more congeni herself by natur and also to a certain
degre by educ a cultur woman she rejoic to find in him an
entir kindr spirit for beneath hi somewhat rug and
unpromis exterior harold quaritch hid a vein of consider
rich few of those who associ with him would have believ
that the man had a side to hi natur which wa almost poetic or that
he wa a ripe and finish scholar and what is more not devoid of a
certain dry humour then he had travel far and seen much of men and
manner gather up all sort of quaint odd and end of
inform but perhap rather than these accomplish it wa the
man transpar honesti and simpleminded hi love for what is
true and nobl and hi contempt of what is mean and base which
unwittingli peep out through hi convers attract her more
than all the rest ida wa no more a young girl to be caught by a
handsom face or dazzl by a superfici show of mind she wa a
thought ripen woman quick to perceiv and with the rare talent
of judgment wherewith to weigh the proce of her percept in
plain middleag colonel quaritch she found a veri perfect
gentleman and valu him accordingli
and so dai grew into dai through that love autumntid edward
cossei wa awai in london quest had ceas from troubl and
journei togeth through the sweet shadow of companionship by
slow but sure degre thei drew near to the sunlit plain of love for
it is not common inde it is so uncommon as to be almost
imposs that a man and woman between whom there stand no natur
impedi can halt for veri long in those shadow wai there is
throughout all natur an impuls that push ever onward toward
complet and from complet to fruition like lead to sympathi
sympathi point the path to love and then love demand it own thi
is the order of affair and down it welltrodden road these two were
quickli travel
georg the wili saw it and wink hi ey with solemn mean the
squir also saw someth of it not be want in knowledg of the
world and after much cogit and mani solitari walk elect to
leav matter alon for the present he like colonel quaritch and
thought that it would be a good thing for ida to get marri though
the idea of part from her troubl hi heart sore whether or no
it would be desir from hi point of view that she should marri the
colonel wa a matter on which he had not as yet fulli made up hi
mind sometim he thought it would and sometim he thought the
revers then at time vagu idea suggest by edward cossei
behaviour about the loan would come to puzzl him but at present he
wa so much in the dark that he could come to no absolut decis so
with unaccustom wisdom for so headstrong and precipit a man he
determin to refrain from interfer and for a while at ani rate
allow event to take their natur cours
chapter xvi
the hous with the red pillar
two dai after hi receipt of the second letter from the tiger mr
quest announc to hi wife that he wa go to london on busi
connect with the bank and expect to be awai for a coupl of
night
she laugh straight out realli william she said you ar a most
consumm actor i wonder that you think it worth while to keep up

and you see there is no more of my monei for her to have
mr quest winc visibl beneath thi bitter satir which hi wife
utter with a smile of infantil innoc plai upon her face but
he made no repli she knew too much onli in hi heart he wonder
what fate she would mete out to him if ever she got possess of the
whole truth and the thought made him trembl it seem to him that
the owner of that babi face could be terribl merciless in her
vengeanc and that those soft white hand would close round the
throat of a man she hate and utterli destroi him now if never
befor he realis that between him and thi woman there must be
enmiti and a struggl to the death and yet strang enough he still
love her
mr quest reach london about three oclock and hi first act wa to
drive to cossei and son where he wa inform that old mr cossei

in anoth minut edward cossei enter and the two men shook hand
how do you do quest said edward i think that the old man is

accordingli thei went upstair to a larg and luxuri bedroom on the
first floor where the stricken man lai upon a patent couch
when mr quest and edward cossei enter a ladi old mr cossei

look as though he would have rub hi hand if he had not been
physic incapacit from so do
mr quest came forward to where the invalid lai he wa a gaunt old
man with white hair and a pallid face which look almost ghastli in
contrast to hi black velvet skull cap so far as mr quest could see
he appear to be almost total paralys with the except of hi
head neck and left arm which he could still move a littl hi
black ey howev were full of life and intellig and roam
about the room without ceas
how do you do mr quest he said sorri that i cant shake hand
with you but you see i have been stricken down though my brain is
clear enough clearer than ever it wa i think and i aint go to

can be made in a year if you keep your ey open onc i made a
hundr and twenti thousand for cossei in on year and i mai do it

pleasant to listen to
i am sure i hope you will sir said mr quest polit
thank you take that for good luck you know well well mr quest
thing havent done so bad down in your part of the world not at all

pain but i am not sorri for it is unpleas for a hous like our
to have to sell an old client up not that hi account is worth much
noth at allmor troubl than profitor we should not have done
it he no better than a bankrupt and the insolv court is the
best place for him the world is to the rich and the ful thereof
there an insolv court especi provid for de la moll and
hi likeempti old windbag with long sound name let him go
there and make room for the men who have made moneyhe hee hee
and onc more hi voic went off into a sort of scream
here mr quest who had enjoi about enough of thi kind of thing
chang the convers by begin to comment on variou busi
transact which he had been conduct on behalf of the hous the
old man listen with the greatest interest hi keen black ey
attent fix upon the speaker face till at last mr quest
happen to mention that amongst other a certain colonel quaritch had
open an account with their branch of the bank
quaritch said the old man eagerli i know that name wa he ever
in the 105th foot
ye said mr quest who knew everyth about everybodi he wa an
ensign in that regiment dure the indian mutini where he wa badli
wound when still quit young and got the victoria cross i found it
all out the other dai
that the man that the man said old mr cossei jerk hi
head in an excit manner he a blackguard i tell you he a
blackguard he jilt my wife sister she wa twenti year younger

mr quest and edward look at each other and the old man let hi
head fall back exhaust

quest to edward cossei as soon as thei were well outsid the door

i had found thirti thousand for old de la moll he would cut me off
with a shill here mr quest prick up hi ear and he close
too he went on so close that it is almost imposs to get
anyth out of him i am not particular but upon my word i think
that it is rather disgust to see an old man with on foot in the
grave hang on to hi moneybag as though he expect to float to
heaven on them
ye said mr quest it is a curiou thing to think of but you
see monei is hi heaven
by the wai said edward as thei enter the studi that queer
about that fellow quaritch isnt it i never like the look of him
with hi piou air

that there must be some mistak i do not believ that colonel
quaritch is the man to do thing of that sort without a veri good
reason howev nobodi can tell and it is a long while ago
a long while ago or not i mean to let him know my opinion of him when

it and yet i could never touch it though god know howev much i
wrong her i love her ye and love her now well it is a good bit
of evid if ever i dare to us it it is a game of bluff between

hi heart wa soften by miseri and hi mind fell into a tender
groov he thought of hi longdead mother whom he had dearli love
and of how he us to sai hi prayer to her and of how she sang
hymn to him on sundai even her death had seem to choke all the
beauti out of hi be at the time and yet now he thank heaven
that she wa dead and then he thought of the accurs woman who had
been hi ruin and of how she had enter into hi life and corrupt
and destroi him next there rose up befor him a vision of bell
bell as he had first seen her a maid of seventeen the onli child of
that drunken old villag doctor now also long sinc dead and of how
the sight of her had for a while stai the corrupt of hi heart
becaus he grew to love her and then he marri bell by foul mean
and the woman rose up in hi path again and he learnt that hi wife

rest a long long struggl which ever end in new laps from the
right till at length he saw himself a harden schemer remorselessli
pursu by a furi from whom there wa no escap and yet he knew that
under other circumst he might have been a good and happi man
lead an honour life but now all hope had gone that which he
wa he must be till the end he lean hi head upon the stone rail
in front of him and wept wept in the anguish of hi soul prai to

chapter xviii
what some have found so sweet
time went on mr quest had been back at boisingham for ten dai or
more and wa more cheer than bell we can no longer call her hi
wife had seen him for mani a dai inde he felt as though ten year
had been lift off hi back he had taken a great and terribl
decis and had act upon it and it had been success for he
knew that hi evil geniu wa so thoroughli terrifi that for a long
while at least he would be free from her persecut but with bell
hi relat remain as strain as ever
now that the reader is in the secret of mr quest life it will
perhap help him to understand the appar strang of hi conduct
with refer to hi wife and edward cossei it is quit true that
bell did not know the full extent of her husband guilt she did not
know that he wa not her husband but she did know that nearli all of
her littl fortun had been paid over to anoth woman and that woman
a common vulgar woman as on of edith letter which had fallen
into her hand by chanc veri clearli show her therefor had he
attempt to expos her proceed or even to control her action
she had in her hand an effect weapon of defenc wherewith she could
and would have given blow for blow thi state of affair of necess
forc each parti to preserv an arm neutral toward the other
whilst thei wait for a suitabl opportun to assert themselv
not that their object were quit the same bell mere wish to be
free from her husband whom she had alwai dislik and whom she now
posit hate with that curiou hatr which women occasion
conceiv toward those to whom thei ar legal bound when thei have
been bad enough or unfortun enough to fall in love with somebodi
els he on the contrari had that desir for reveng upon her which
even the gentler stamp of man is apt to conceiv toward on who
herself the object of hi strong affect daili and hourli repel
and repai it with scorn and infidel he did love her truli she
wa the on live thing in all hi bitter lone life to whom hi
heart had gone out true he put pressur on her to marri him or what
come to the same thing allow and encourag her drunken old father
to do so but he had love her and still love her and yet she mock
at him and in the face of that fact about the moneyh monei which
he had paid awai to the other woman a fact which it wa imposs
for him to explain except by admiss of guilt which would be hi
ruin what wa he to urg to convinc her of thi even had she been
open to convict but it wa bitter to him bitter beyond all
concept to have thi the on joi of hi life snatch from him
he threw himself with ardour into the pursuit after wealth and digniti
of posit partli becaus he had a legitim desir for these
thing and partli to assuag the constant irrit of hi mind but
to no purpos these two spectr of hi exist hi tiger wife and
the fair woman who wa hi wife in name constantli march side by
side befor him blot out the beauti from everi scene and sour
the sweet of everi joi but if in hi pain he thirst for reveng
upon bell who would have none of him how much more did he desir to
be aveng upon edward cossei who as it were had in sheer
wanton rob him of the on good thing he had it made him mad to
think that thi man to whom he knew himself to be in everi wai
superior should have had the power thu to injur him and he long
to pai him back measur for measur and through hi heart
affect to strike him as mortal a blow as he had himself receiv
mr quest wa no doubt a bad man hi whole life wa a fraud he wa
selfish and unscrupul in hi scheme and relentless in their
execut but whatev mai have been the measur of hi iniqu
he wa not doom to wait for anoth world to have them mete out to
him again hi life inde wa full of miseri the more keenli
felt becaus of the high pitch and capac of hi natur and perhap
the sharpest of them all wa the sicken knowledg that had it not
been for that on fatal error of hi boyhood that on fals step down
the steep of avernu he might have been a good and even a great man
just now howev hi load wa a littl lighten and he wa abl to
devot himself to hi moneymak and to the weav of the web that
wa to destroi hi rival edward cossei with a mind a littl less
preoccupi with other care
meanwhil thing at the castl were go veri pleasantli for
everybodi the squir wa as happi in attend to the variou detail
connect with the transfer of the mortgag as though he had been
lend thirti thousand pound instead of borrow them the great
georg wa happi in the accustom flow of cash that enabl him to
treat janter with a lofti scorn not unmingl with piti which wa as
balm to hi harass soul and also to transact an enorm amount of
busi in hi own peculiar wai with men up tree and otherwis for
had he not to stock the moat farm and wa not michaelma at hand
ida too wa happi happier than she had been sinc her brother
death for reason that have alreadi been hint at besid mr
edward cossei wa out of the wai and that to ida wa a veri great
thing for hi presenc to her wa what a policeman is to a ticketof
leav mana most unpleas and suggest sight she fulli realis
the mean and extent of the bargain into which she had enter to
save her father and her hous and there lai upon her the deep shadow
of evil that wa to come everi time she saw her father bustl about
with hi busi matter and hi parchment everi time the univers
georg arriv with an air of melancholi satisfact and a long list
of the farm stock and implement he had bought at some neighbour
michaelma sale the shadow deepen and she heard the clank of
her chain therefor she wa the more thank for her respit
harold quaritch wa happi too though in a somewhat restless and
peculiar wai mr jobson the old ladi who attend to hi want at
molehil with the help of a garden and a simpl villag maid her
niec who smash all the crockeri and nearli drove the colonel mad
by bang the door shift hi paper and even dust hi trai
of roman coin actual confid to some friend in the villag that
she thought the poor dear gentleman wa go mad when question on
what she base thi belief she repli that he would walk up and down
the oakpanel diningroom by the hour togeth and then when he
got tire of that exercis wherebi said mr jobson he had alreadi
worn a groov in the new turkei carpet he would take out a rokei
foggi look bit of a pictur set it upon a chair and stare at it
through hi finger shake hi head and mutter all the while
thenfurth and conclus proof of a yield intellecth would
get a halfsheet of paper with some write on it and put it on the
mantelpiec and stare at that next he would turn it upsid down and
stare at it so then sidewai then all wai then he would hold it
befor a lookingglass and stare at the lookingglass and so on when
ask how she knew all thi she confess that her niec jane had
seen it through the keyhol not onc but often
of cours as the practis and discern reader will clearli
understand thi meant onli that when walk and wear out the
carpet the colonel wa think of ida when contempl the
paint that she had given him he wa admir her work and try
to reconcil the admir with hi conscienc and hi somewhat
peculiar view of art and when glare at the paper he wa vainli
endeavour to make head or tale of the messag written to hi son on
the night befor hi execut by sir jame de la moll in the reign
of charl i confid believ by ida to contain a kei to the
whereabout of the treasur he wa suppos to have secret
of cours the tale of thi worthi soul mr jobson did not lose in
the tell and when it reach ida ear which it did at last
through the medium of georgefor in addit to hi numberless other
function georg wa the sole authoris purveyor of villag and
counti newsit read that colonel quaritch had gone rave mad
ten minut afterward thi rave lunat arriv at the castl in
dress cloth and hi right mind whereon ida promptli repeat her
thrill histori somewhat to the subsequ discomfort of mr
jobson and jane
no on as somebodi onc said with equal truth and profund know
what a minut mai bring forth much less therefor doe anybodi know
what an even of sai two hundr and forti minut mai produc for
instanc harold quaritchthough by thi time he had gone so far as
to freeli admit to himself that he wa utterli and hopelessli in love
with ida in love with her with that settl and determin passion
which sometim strike a man or woman in middl agecertainli did
not know that befor the even wa out he would have declar hi
devot with result that shall be made clear in their decent order
when he put on hi dress cloth to come up to dinner he had no more
intent of propos to ida than he had of not take them off when
he went to bed hi love wa deep enough and steadi enough but
perhap it did not possess that wild impetuos which carri peopl
so far in their youth sometim inde a great deal further than
their reason approv it wa essenti a middleag devot and
bore the same resembl to the picturesqu passion of fiveand
twenti that a snowf torrent doe to a navig river the on
rush and roar and sweep awai the bridg and devast happi
home while the other bear upon it placid breast the argosi of
peac and plenti and is gener servic to the necess of
man still there is someth attract about torrent there is a
grandeur in that first rush of passion which result from the sudden
melt of the snow of the heart puriti and faith and high
unstain devot
but both torrent and navig river ar liabl to a common fate
thei mai fall over precipic and when thi come to pass even the
latter ceas to be navig for a space now thi catastroph wa
about to overtak our friend the colonel
well harold quaritch had dine and had enjoi a pleasant as well as
a good dinner the squir who of late had been cheer as a cricket
wa in hi best form and told long stori with an infinitesim
point in anybodi els mouth these stori would have been wearisom
to a degre but there wa a gusto an origin and a kind of
tudor period flavour about the old gentleman which made hi worst and
longest stori accept in ani societi the colonel himself had also
come out in a most unusu wai he possess a fund of dry humour
which he rare produc but when he did produc it it wa of a most
satisfactori order on thi particular night it wa all on view
greatli to the satisfact of ida who wa a witti as well as a
clever woman and so it came to pass that the dinner wa a veri
pleasant on
harold and the squir were still sit over their wine the latter
wa for the fifth time give hi guest a full and particular account
of how hi deceas aunt mr massei had been persuad by a learn
antiquarian to convert or rather to restor dead man mount into it
suppos primit condit of an ancient british dwell and of
the extraordinari express of her face when the bill came in when
suddenli the servant announc that georg wa wait to see him
the old gentleman grumbl a great deal but final got up and went
to enjoi himself for the next hour or so in talk about thing in
gener with hi retain leav hi guest to find hi wai to the
drawingroom
when the colonel reach the room he found ida seat at the piano
sing she heard him shut the door look round nod prettili
and then went on with her sing he came and sat down on a low chair
some two pace from her place himself in such a posit that he
could see her face which inde he alwai found a wonderfulli
pleasant object of contempl ida wa plai without musicth
onli light in the room wa that of a low lamp with a red fring to it
therefor he could not see veri much be with difficulti abl to
trace the outlin of her featur but if the shadow thu rob him
it on the other hand lent her a beauti of it own cloth her face
with an atmospher of wonder soft which it did not alwai
possess in the glare of dai the colonel inde we must rememb that
he wa in love and that it wa after dinner becam quit poetic
intern of cours about it and in hi heart compar her first
to st cecilia at her organ and then to the angel of the twilight he
had never seen her look so love at her worst she wa a handsom and
noblelook woman but now the shadow from without and though he
knew noth of that the shadow from her heart within also aid
mayb by the music swell had soften and purifi her face till it
did inde look almost like an angel it is strong power face
that ar capabl of the most tender not the soft and pretti on
and even in a plain person when such a face is in thi wai seen it
gather a peculiar beauti of it own but ida wa not a plain person
so on the whole it is scarc wonder that a certain effect wa
produc upon harold quaritch ida went on sing almost without a
breakto outward appear at ani rate all unconsci of what wa
pass in her admir mind she had a good memori and a sweet
voic and realli like music for it own sake so it wa no great
effort to her to do so
present she sang a song from tennyson maud the tender and
beauti word whereof will be familiar to most reader of her stori
it began
o let the solid ground
not fail beneath my feet
befor my life ha found
what some have found so sweet
the song is a love on nor did it suffer from her render and
the effect it produc upon harold wa of a most peculiar natur all
hi past life seem to heav and break beneath the magic of the music
and the magic of the singer as a northern field of ic break up
beneath the outburst of the summer sun it broke sank and vanish
into the depth of hi natur those dread unmeasur depth that roll
and murmur in the vast of each human heart as the sea roll
beneath it cloak of ic that roll and murmur here and set toward a
shore of which we have no chart or knowledg the past wa gone the
frozen year had melt and onc more the sweet strong air of youth
blew across hi heart and onc more there wa clear sky abov
wherein the angel sail befor the breath of that sweet song the
barrier of self fell down hi be went out to meet her be and
all the sleep possibl of life rose from the buri time
he sat and listen trembl as he listen till the gentl echo
of the music di upon the quiet air thei di and were gather
into the empti which receiv and record all thing leav him
broken
she turn to him smile faintli for the song had move her also
and he felt that he must speak

her hand fell heavili on the kei
the echo of the crash note roll round the room and slowli di
awaybut still she said noth
chapter xix
in pawn
at last she spoke appar with a great effort
it is stifl in here she said let us go out she rose took up
a shawl that lai besid her on a chair and step through the french
window into the garden it wa a love autumn night and the air wa
still as death with just a touch of frost in it
ida threw the shawl over her shoulder and follow by harold walk
on through the garden till she came to the edg of the moat where
there wa a seat here she sat down and fix her ey upon the hoari
battlement of the gatewai now clad in a solemn robe of moonlight
harold look at her and felt that if he had anyth to sai the time
had come for him to sai it and that she had brought him here in order
that she might be abl to listen undisturb so he began again and
told her that he love her dearli
i am some seventeen year older than you he went on and i suppos
that the most activ part of my life li in the past and i dont
know if put other thing asid you could care to marri so old a
man especi as i am not rich inde i feel it presumptu on my
part see what you ar and what i am not to ask you to do so and
yet ida i believ if you could care for me that with heaven
bless we should be veri happi togeth i have led a lone life
and have had littl to do with womenonc mani year ago i wa
engag and the matter end painfulli and that is all but ever
sinc i first saw your face in the drift five year and more ago it
ha haunt me and been with me then i came to live here and i have
learnt to love you heaven onli know how much and i should be
asham to try to put it into word for thei would sound foolish all
my life is wrap up in you and i feel as though should you see me
no more i could never be a happi man again and he paus and look
anxious at her face which wa set and drawn as though with pain
i cannot sai ye colonel quaritch she answer at length in a
tone that puzzl him it wa so tender and so unfit to the word
i suppos he stammer i suppos that you do not care for me of
cours i have no right to expect that you would
as i have said that i cannot sai ye colonel quaritch do you not
think that i had better leav that question unansw she repli
in the same soft note which seem to draw the heart out of him
i do not understand he went on why
why she broke in with a bitter littl laugh shall i tell you why
becaus i am in pawn look she went on point to the state
tower and the broad land beyond you see thi place i am
secur for it i myself in my own person had it not been for me
it would have been sold over our head after have descend in our
famili for all these centuri put upon the market and sold for what
it would fetch and my old father would have been turn out to die
for it would have kill him so you see i did what unfortun women
have often been driven to do i sold myself bodi and soul and i got a
good price toothirti thousand pound and suddenli she burst into a
flood of tear and began to sob as though her heart would break
for a moment harold quaritch look on bewild not in the least
understand what ida meant and then he follow the impuls common
to mankind in similar circumst and took her in hi arm she did
not resent the movement inde she scarc seem to notic it
though to tell the truth for a moment or two which to the colonel
seem the happiest of hi life her head rest on hi shoulder
almost instantli howev she rais it freed herself from hi
embrac and ceas weep
as i have told you so much she said i suppos that i had better
tell you everyth i know that whatev the temptat and she
laid great stress upon the word under ani conceiv circumst
inde even if you believ that you were serv me in so doingi
can reli upon you never to reveal to anybodi and abov all to my
father what i now tell you and she paus and look up at him with
ey in which the tear still swam
of cours you can reli on me he said
veri well i am sure that i shall never have to reproach you with the
word i will tell you i have virtual promis to marri mr edward
cossei should he at ani time be in a posit to claim fulfil of
the promis on condit of hi take up the mortgag on honham
which he ha done
harold quaritch took a step back and look at her in horrifi
astonish
what he ask
ye ye she answer hastili put up her hand as though to
shield herself from a blow i know what you mean but do not think
too hardli of me if you can help it it wa not for myself i would
rather work for my live with my hand than take a price for there
is no other word for it it wa for my father and my famili too i
could not bear to think of the old place go to the hammer and i
did it all in a minut without consider but and she set her
face even as thing ar i believ i should do it again becaus i
think that no on woman ha a right to destroi her famili in order to
pleas herself if on of the two must go let it be the woman but
dont think hardli of me for it she ad almost pleadingli that
is if you can help it
i am not think of you he answer grimli by heaven i honour
you for what you have done for howev much i mai disagre with the
act it is a nobl on i am think of the man who could drive such
a bargain with ani woman you sai that you have promis to marri him
should he ever be in a posit to claim it what do you mean by that
as you have told me so much you mai as well tell me the rest
he spoke clearli and with a voic full of author but hi bear
did not seem to jar upon ida
i meant she answer humbl that i believeof cours i do not
know if i am righti believ that mr cossei is in some wai entangl
with a ladi in short with mr quest and that the question of
whether or no he come forward again depend upon her
upon my word said the colonel upon my word the thing get wors
and wors i never heard anyth like it and for monei too the
thing is beyond me
at ani rate she answer there it is and now colonel quaritch
on word befor i go in it is difficult for me to speak without
sai too much or too littl but i do want you to understand how
honour and how grate i feel for what you have told me tonighti
am so littl worthi of all you have given me and to be honest i
cannot feel as pain about it as i ought to feel it is feminin
vaniti you know noth els i am sure that you will not press me
to sai more
no he answer no i think that i understand the posit but
ida there is on thing that i must askyou will forgiv me if i am
wrong in do so but all thi is veri sad for me if in the end
circumst should alter as i prai heaven that thei mai or if mr
cossei previou entangl should prove too much for him will you
marri me ida
she thought for a moment and then rise from the seat gave him her
hand and said simpli
ye i will marri you
he made no answer but lift her hand touch it gentli with hi
lip
meanwhil she went on i have your promis and i am sure that you
will not betrai it come what mai
no he said i will not betrai it
and thei went in
in the drawingroom thei found the squir puzzl over a sheet of
paper on which were scrawl some of georg account in figur
which at first sight bore about as much resembl to egyptian
hieroglyph as thei did to those in us todai
hullo he said there you ar where on earth have you been
we have been look at the castl in the moonlight answer ida
coolli it is beauti
umah said the squir dryli i have no doubt that it is
beauti but isnt the grass rather damp well look here and he
held up the sheet of hieroglyph perhap you can add thi up ida
for it is more than i can georg ha bought stock and all sort of
thing at the sale todai and here is hi account three hundr and
seventytwo pound he make it but i make it four hundr and twenti
and hang me if i can find out which is right it is most import
that these account should be kept straight most import and i
cannot get thi stupid fellow to do it
ida took the sheet of paper and ad it up with the result that she
discov both total to be wrong harold watch her wonder at
the nerv of a woman who after go through such a scene as that
which had just occur could deliber add up long row of badli
written figur
and thi monei which her father wa expend so cheerfulli wa part
of the price for which she had bound herself
with a sigh he rose said goodnight and went home with feel
almost too mix to admit of accur descript he had taken a
great step in hi life and to a certain extent that step had
succeed he had not altogeth built hi hope upon sand for from
what ida had said and still more from what she had tacitli admit
it wa necessarili clear to him that she did more or less regard him
as a man would wish to be regard by a woman whom he dearli love
thi wa a great deal more inde than he had dare to believ but
then as is usual the case in thi imperfect world where thing but
too often seem to be carefulli arrang at six and seven came the
other side of the shield of what us to him wa it to have won thi
sweet woman love of what us to have put thi pure water of
happi to hi lip in the desert of hi lone life onli to see
the cup that held it shatter at a blow to him the stori of the
monei loanin consider of which as it were ida had put herself
in pawn as the egyptian us to put the mummi of their father in
pawnwa almost incred to a person of hi simpl and honour
natur it seem a preposter and unheard of thing that ani man
call himself a gentleman should find it possibl to sink so low as
to take such advantag of a woman dire necess and honour
desir to save her father from miseri and her race from ruin and to
extract from her a promis of marriag in consider of valu
receiv put asid hi overwhelm person interest in the
matter it made hi blood boil to think that such a thing could be
and yet it wa and what wa more he believ he knew ida well enough
to be convinc that she would not shirk the bargain if edward cossei
came forward to claim hi bond it would be paid down to the last
farth it wa a question of thirti thousand pound the happi
of hi life and of ida depend upon a sum of monei if the monei
were forthcom cossei could not claim hi flesh and blood but
where wa it to come from he himself wa worth perhap ten thousand
pound or with the commut valu of hi pension possibl twelv
and he had not the mean of rais a farth more he thought the
posit over till he wa tire of think and then with a heavi
heart and yet with a strang glow of happi shine through hi
grief like sunlight through a grei sky at last he went to sleep and
dream that ida had gone from him and that he wa onc more utterli
alon in the world
but if he had caus for troubl how much more wa it so with ida
poor woman under her somewhat cold and state exterior lai a deep
and at time a passion natur for some week she had been grow
strang attract to harold quaritch and now she knew that she
love him so that there wa no on thing that she desir more in
thi wide world than to becom hi wife and yet she wa bound bound
by a sens of honour and a sens too of monei receiv to stai at the
beck and call of a man she detest and if at ani time it pleas him
to throw down the handkerchief to be there to pick it up and hold it
to her breast it wa bad enough to have had thi hang over her
head when she wa herself more or less in a passiv condit and
therefor to a certain extent reckless as to her futur but now that
her heart wa alight with the holi flame of a good woman love now
that her whole natur rebel and cri out aloud against the
sacrileg involv it wa both revolt and terribl
and yet so far as she could see there wa no great probabl of
escap a shrewd and observ woman she could gaug mr cossei
condit of mind toward herself with more or less accuraci also she
did not think it in the least like that have spent thirti thousand
pound to advanc hi object he would be content to let hi advantag
drop such a cours would be repel to hi trade instinct she
knew in her heart that the hour wa not far off when he would claim
hi own and that unless some accid occur to prevent it it wa
practic certain that she would be call upon to fulfil her
pledg and whilst love anoth man to becom the wife of edward
cossei
chapter xx

truth did he requir ani admonit from mr cossei senior to make
him anxiou to do colonel quaritch an illturn if the opportun
should serv mr quest in her numer affection letter had
more than onc possibl for reason of her own given him a full and
vivid resum of the local gossip about the colonel and ida who
were she said accord to common report engag to be marri
now absenc had not by ani mean cool edward devot to miss de
la moll which wa a sincer on enough in it own wai on the
contrari the longer he wa awai from her the more hi passion grew
and with it a vigor undergrowth of jealousi he had it is true
ida impli promis that she would marri him if he chose to ask her
but on thi he put no great relianc henc hi hurri to return to
boisingham
leav london by an afternoon train he reach boisingham about
halfpast six and in pursuanc of an arrang alreadi made went
to dine with the quest when he reach the hous he found bell
alon in the drawingroom for her husband have come in late wa
still dress but somewhat to hi relief he had no opportun of
privat convers with her for a servant wa in the room
attend to the fire which would not burn the dinner pass off
quietli enough though there wa an omin look about the ladi face
which be familiar with these sign of the feminin weather he did
not altogeth like after dinner howev mr quest excus himself
sai that he had promis to attend a local concert in aid of the
fund for the restor of the damag pinnacl of the parish
church and he wa left alon with the ladi
then it wa that all her pentup passion broke out she overwhelm
him with her affect she told him that her life had been a blank
while he wa awai she reproach him with the scarciti and cold
of hi letter and gener went on in a wai with which he wa but
too well accustom and if the truth must be told heartili tire
hi mood wa an irrit on and tonight the whole thing weari
him beyond bear
come bell he said at last for good sake be a littl more
ration you ar get too old for thi sort of tomfooleri you
know
she sprang up and face him her ey flash and her breast heav
with jealou anger what do you mean she said ar you tire of
me
i did not sai that he answer but as you have start the
subject i must tell you that i think all thi ha gone far enough
unless it is stop i believ we shall both be ruin i am sure that
your husband is becom suspici and as i have told you again and
again if onc the busi get to my father ear he will
disinherit me
bell stood quit still till he had finish she had assum her
favourit attitud and cross her arm behind her back and her sweet
childish face wa calm and veri white
what is the good of make excus and tell me what is not true
edward she said on never hear a man who love a woman talk like
that prudenc come with weari and men grow circumspect when
there is noth more to gain you ar tire of me i have seen it a
long time but like a blind fool i have tri not to believ it it is
not a great reward to a woman who ha given her whole life to a man
but perhap it is as much as she can expect for i do not want to be
unjust to you i am the most to blame becaus we need never take a
fals step except of our own free will
well well he said impati what of it
onli thi edward i have still a littl pride left and as you ar
tire of me whygo
he tri hard to prevent it but do what he would a look of relief
struggl into hi face she saw it and it stung her almost to
mad
you need not look so happi edward it is scarc decent and
besid you have not heard all that i have to sai i know what thi
aris from you ar in love with ida de la moll now there i draw
the line you mai leav me if you like but you shall not marri ida
while i am aliv to prevent it that is more than i can bear besid
like a wise woman she wish to marri colonel quaritch who is worth
two of you edward cossei
i do not believ it he answer and what right have you to sai
that i am in love with miss de la moll and if i am in love with her
how can you prevent me from marri her if i choos
try and you will see she answer with a littl laugh and now
as the curtain ha drop and it is all over between us why the
best thing that we can do is to put out the light and go to bed and
she laugh again and courtesi with much assum play good
night mr cossei goodnight and goodby
he held out hi hand come bell he said dont let us part like
thi
she shook her head and onc more put her arm behind her no she
answer i will not take your hand of my own free will i shall
never touch it again for to me it is like the hand of the dead good
bye onc more goodby to you edward and to all the happi that

provid that you do not try to marri ida for that i will not bear
and now go for i am veri tire and turn she rang the bell for
the servant to show him out
in anoth minut he wa gone she listen till she heard the front
door close behind him and then gave wai to her grief fling
herself upon the sofa she cover her face with her hand and moan
bitterli weep for the past and weep too for the long
desol year that were to come poor woman whatev wa the measur
of her sin it had assuredli found her out as our sin alwai do find
us out in the end she had love thi man with a love which ha no
parallel in the heart of wellord and wellbroughtup women she
never realli live till thi fatal passion took possess of her and
now that it object had desert her her heart felt as though it wa
dead within her in that short halfhour she suffer more than mani
women do in their whole live but the paroxysm pass and she rose
pale and trembl with set teeth and blaze ey
he had better be care she said to herself he mai go but if he
tri to marri ida i will keep my wordy for her sake as well as
hi
when edward cossei came to consid the posit which he did
serious on the follow morn he did not find it veri
satisfactori to begin with he wa not altogeth a heartless man
and such a scene as that which he had pass through on the previou
even wa in itself quit enough to upset hi nerv at on time
at ani rate he had been much attach to mr quest he had never
born her ani violent affect that had all been on her side but
still he had been fond of her and if he could have done so would
probabl have marri her even now he wa attach to her and would
have been glad to remain her friend if she would have allow it but
then came the time when her heroic began to weari him and he on hi
side began to fall in love with ida de la moll and as he drew back
so she came forward till at length he wa worn out and thing
culmin as ha been describ he wa sorri for her too know
how deepli she wa attach to him though it is probabl that he did
not in the least realis the extent to which she suffer for neither
men nor women who have intention or otherwis been the caus of
intens mental anguish to on of the opposit sex ever do quit
realis thi thei not unnatur measur the troubl by the depth
of their own and ar therefor veri apt to come to erron
conclus of cours thi is said of case where all the real
passion is on on side and indiffer or compar indiffer
on the other for where it is mutual the grief will in natur of
equal depth be mutual also
at ani rate edward cossei wa quit sensit enough to acut feel
part with mr quest and perhap he felt the manner of it even
more than the fact of the separ then came anoth consider
he wa it is true free from hi entangl in itself an enorm
relief but the freedom wa of a condit natur bell had
threaten troubl in the most decis tone should he attempt to
carri out hi secret purpos of marri ida which she had not been
slow to divin for some occult reason at least to him it seem
occult the idea of thi allianc wa peculiarli distast to her
though no doubt the true explan wa that she believ and not
inaccur that in order to bring it about he wa bent upon
desert her the question with him wa would she or would she not
attempt to put her threat into execut it certainli seem to him
difficult to imagin what step she could take to that end see
that ani such step would necessarili involv her own exposur and
that too when there wa noth to gain and when all hope of therebi
secur him for herself had pass awai nor did he serious believ
that she would attempt anyth of the sort it is on thing for a
woman to make such threat in the acut agoni of her jealousi and
quit anoth for her to carri them out in cold blood look at the
matter from a man point of view it seem to him extrem
improb that when the occas came she would attempt such a move
he forgot how much more violent when onc it ha taken possess
of hi be the storm of passion sweep through such a woman heart
than through a man and how utterli reckless to all consequ the
former sometim becom for there ar women with whom all thing
melt in that white heat of anguish jealousyhonour duti
conscienc and the restraint of religionand of these bell quest
wa on
but of thi he wa not awar and though he recognis a risk he saw
in it no suffici reason to make him stai hi hand for dai by dai
the strong desir to make ida hi wife had grown upon him till at
last it possess him bodi and soul for a long while the intent had
been smoulder in hi breast and the tale that he now heard to the
effect that colonel quaritch had been beforehand with him had blown
it into a flame ida wa ever present in hi thought even at night
he could not be rid of her for when he slept her vision darkei
and beauti came steal down hi dream she wa hi heaven and
if by ani ladder known to man he might climb thereto thither he would
climb and so he set hi teeth and vow that mr quest or no mr
quest he would stake hi fortun upon the hazard of the die ay and
win even if he load the dice
while he wa still think thu stand at hi window and gaze
out on to the market place of the quiet littl town he suddenli saw
ida herself drive in her ponycarriag it wa a wet and windi dai
the rain wa on her cheek and the wind toss a littl lock of her
brown hair the cob wa pull and her proud face wa set as she
concentr her energi upon hold him never to edward cossei had
she look more beauti hi heart beat fast at the sight of her
and whatev doubt might have linger in hi mind vanish ye he
would claim her promis and marri her
present the poni carriag pull up at hi door and the boi who wa
sit behind got down and rang the bell he step back from the
window wonder what it could be
will you pleas give that note to mr cossei said ida as the door
open and ask him to send an answer and she wa gone
the note wa from the squir seal with hi big seal the squir
alwai seal hi letter in the oldfashion wai and contain an
invit to himself to shoot on the morrow georg want me to do a
littl partridg drive it end and to brush through on or two
of the small covert there will onli be colonel quaritch besid
yourself and georg but i hope that you will have a fair rough dai
if i dont hear from you i shall suppos that you ar come so dont
troubl to write
oh ye i will go said edward confound that quaritch at ani rate
i can show him how to shoot and what is more i will have it out with
him about my aunt
chapter xxi
the colonel goe out shoot
the next morn wa fine and still on of those love autumn dai
of which we get four or five in the cours of a season after
breakfast harold quaritch stroll down hi garden stood himself
against a gate to the right of dead man mount and look at the
scene all about him their foliag yellow to it fall rose the
giant oak which were the pride of the countri side and so quiet wa
the air that not a leaf upon them stir the onli sound that
reach hi ear were the tap of the nuthutch as thei sought
their food in the rough cranni of the bark and the occasion
fall of a rich ripe acorn from it lofti place on to the frost
grass beneath the sunshin shone bright but with a chasten heat
the squirrel scrambl up the oak and high in the blue air the
rook pursu their path it wa a beauti morn for summer is
never more sweet than on it deathb and yet it fill him with
solemn thought how mani autumn had those old tree seen and how
mani would thei still see long after hi ey had lost their sight
and if thei were old how old wa dead man mount there to hi left
old inde for he had discov it wa mention in doomdai book
and by that name and what wa ita boundari hill a natur
format or as it name impli a funer barrow he had half a
mind to dig on dai and find out that is if he could get anybodi to
dig with him for the peopl about honham were so firmli convinc
that dead man mount wa haunt a reput which it had own
from time immemori that noth would have persuad them to touch
it
he contempl the great mound carefulli without come to ani
conclus and then look at hi watch it wa a quarter to ten
time for him to start for the castl for hi dai shoot so he got
hi gun and cartridg and in due cours arriv at the castl to
find georg and sever myrmidon in the shape of beater and boi
alreadi stand in the yard
pleas colonel the squir hope youll go in and have a glass of
summut befor you start said georg so accordingli he went not to
have a glass of summut but on the chanc of see ida in the
vestibul he found the old gentleman busili engag in write an
enorm letter
hullo colonel he halloa without get up glad to see you
excus me for a few moment will you i want to get thi off my mind
ida ida ida he shout here colonel quaritch
good graciou father said that young ladi arriv in a hurri
you ar bring the hous down and then she turn round and
greet harold it wa the first time thei had met sinc the event
even describ a chapter or two back so the occas might be
consid a littl awkward at ani rate he felt it so
how do you do colonel quaritch she said quit simpli give him
her hand there wa noth in the word and yet he felt that he wa
veri welcom for when a woman realli love a man there is about her
an atmospher of soft and tender mean which can scarc be
mistaken sometim it is onli percept to the favour individu
himself but more gener is to be discern by ani person of
ordinari shrewd a veri short cours of observ in gener
societi will convinc the reader of the justic of thi observ
and when onc he get to know the sign of the weather he will
probabl light upon more affair of the heart than were ever meant for
hi investig
thi soft or atmospher influenc or subdu glow of affect
radiat from a light within wa clearli enough visibl in ida that
morn and certainli it made our friend the colonel unspeak
happi to see it
ar you fond of shoot she ask present
ye veri and have been all my life
ar you a good shot she ask again
i call that a rude question he answer smile
ye it is but i want to know
well said harold i suppos that i am pretti fair that is at
rough shoot i never had much practic at driven bird and that
kind of sport
i am glad of it
why it doe not much matter on goe out shoot for the sport of
the thing
ye i know but mr edward cossei and she shrank visibl as she
utter the name is come and he is a veri good shot and veri
conceit about it i want you to beat him if you canwil you try
well said harold i dont at all like shoot against a man it
is not sportsmanlik you know and besid if mr cossei is a crack
shot i daresai that i shall be nowher but i will shoot as well as i
can
do you know it is veri feminin but i would give anyth to see
you beat him and she nod and laugh whereupon harold quaritch
vow in hi heart that if it in him lai he would not disappoint her
at that moment edward cossei fast trot hors drew up at the door
with a prodigi crunch of gravel and edward himself enter
look veri handsom and rather pale he wa admir dress that
is to sai hi shoot cloth were beautifulli made and veri new
look and so were hi boot and so wa hi hat and so were hi
hammerless gun of which he brought a pair there exist a certain
class of sportsmen who alwai appear to have just walk out of a
sport tailor shop and to thi class edward cossei belong
everyth about him wa of the best and newest and most expens
kind possibl even hi gun were just down from a famou maker and
the best that could be had for love or monei have cost exactli a
hundr and forti guinea the pair inde he present a curiou
contrast to hi rival the colonel had certainli noth newlook
about him an old tweed coat an old hat with a piec of gut still
twine round it a sadli frai bag full of brown cartridg and
last of all an old gun with the brown worn off the barrel origin
cost 17 pound 10 and yet there wa no possibl of make ani
mistak as to which of the two look more of a gentleman or inde
more of a sportsman
edward cossei shook hand with ida but when the colonel wa advanc
to give him hi hand he turn and spoke to the squir who had at
length finish hi letter so that no greet wa pass between
them at the time harold did not know if thi move wa or wa not
accident
present thei start edward cossei attend by hi man with the
second gun
hullo cossei sang out the squir after him it isnt ani us
bring your two gun for thi sort of work i dont preserv much
here you know at least not now you will onli get a dozen cock
pheasant and a few brace of partridg
oh thank you he answer i alwai like to have a second gun in
case i should want it it no troubl you know
all right said the squir ida and i will come down with the
luncheon to the grove goodby
after cross the moat edward cossei walk by himself follow by
hi man and a veri fine retriev and the colonel talk to georg
who wa inform him that mr cossei wa a pretti shot he wore but
rather snappi over it till thei came to a field of white turnip
now gentlemen if you pleas said georg we will walk through
these here turnip i put two covei of bird in here myself and it
rare good lai for them so i think that we had better see if thei
will let us come nigh them
accordingli thei start down the field the colonel on the right
georg in the middl and edward cossei on the left
befor thei had gone ten yard an old frenchman got up in the front
of on of the beater and wheel round past edward who cut him over
in firstrat style
from that on bird the colonel could see that the man wa a quick and
clever shot present howev a leash of english bird rose rather
awkwardli at about forti pace straight in front of edward cossei and
harold notic that he left them alon never attempt to fire at
them in fact he wa on of those shooter who never take a hard shot
if thei can avoid it be alwai in terror lest thei should miss it
and so reduc their averag
then georg who wa a veri fair shot of the poke order fire
both barrel and got a bird and edward cossei got anoth it wa not
till thei were get to the end of their last beat that harold found
a chanc of let off hi gun suddenli howev a brace of old
bird sprang up out of the turnip in front of him at about thirti
yard as swiftli as though thei had been eject from a mortar and
made off on to the right and on to the left both of them rise
shot he got the righthand bird and then turn kill the other
also when it wa more than fifti yard awai
the colonel felt satisfi for the shot were veri good mr cossei
open hi ey and wonder if it wa a fluke and georg ejacul
well that a master on
after thi thei pursu their cours pick up anoth two brace of
bird on the wai to the outli cover a wood of about twenti acr
through which thei were to brush it wa a good hold wood for
pheasant but lai on the outsid of the honham estat where thei
were liabl to be poach by the farmer whose land march so georg
enjoin them particularli not to let anyth go
into the detail of the sport that follow we need not enter beyond
sai that the colonel to hi huge delight never shot better in hi
life inde with the except of on rabbit and hen pheasant that
flop up right beneath hi feet he scarc miss anyth though
he took the shot as thei came edward cossei also shot well and with
on except miss noth but then he never took a difficult shot
if he could avoid it the except wa a woodcock which rose in front
of georg who wa walk down an outsid belt with the beater he
loos two barrel at it and miss and on it came among the tree
top past where edward cossei wa stand about halfwai down the
belt give him a difficult chanc with the first barrel and a clear
on with the second bang bang and on came the woodcock now fly
low but at tremend speed straight at the colonel head a most
puzzl shot howev he fire and to hi joi and what joi is
there like to the joi of a sportsman who ha just kill a woodcock
which everybodi ha been pop at down it came with a thump almost
at hi feet
thi wa their last beat befor lunch which wa now to be seen
approach down a lane in a donkei cart convoi by ida and the
squir the latter wa advanc in stage of about ten pace and at
everi stage he stop to utter a most fear roar by wai of warn
all and sundri that thei were not to shoot in hi direct edward
gave hi gun to hi bearer and at onc walk off to join them but
the colonel went with georg to look after two run cock which he
had down for he wa an oldfashion sportsman and hate not pick
up hi game after some difficulti thei found on of the cock in the
hedgerow but the other thei could not find so reluctantli thei gave
up the search when thei got to the lane thei found the luncheon
readi while on of the beater wa lai out the game for the squir
to inspect there were fourteen pheasant four brace and a half of
partridg a hare three rabbit and a woodcock

much to the gener convers when it wa done the squir

whereon ida said that she should stop and see someth of the
shoot and the fun began
chapter xxii
the end of the match
thei began the afternoon with sever small drive but on the whole
the bird did veri badli thei broke back went off to on side or the
other and gener misbehav themselv in the first drive the
colonel and edward cossei got a bird each in the second drive the
latter got three bird fire five shot and hi antagonist onli got
a hare and a pheasant that jump out of a ditch neither of which of
cours count anyth onli on brace of bird came hi wai at all
but if the truth must be told he wa talk to ida at the moment and
did not see them till too late
then came a longer drive when the bird were pretti plenti the
colonel got on a lowfli frenchman which he kill as he top
the fenc and after that for the life of him he could not touch a
feather everi sportsman know what a fatal thing it is to begin to
miss and then get nervou and that wa what happen to the colonel
continu there came distant cri of mark mark over follow
by the apparit of halfadozen brown ball show clearli against
the grei autumn sky and sweep down toward him like lightn
whizz in front overhead and behind bang bang bang again with the
second gun and thei were awayvanish gone leav noth but a
memori behind them
the colonel swore beneath hi breath and ida kneel at hi side
sigh audibl but it wa of no us and present the drive wa
done and there he wa with on wretch french partridg to show for
it
ida said noth but she look volum and if ever a man felt
humili harold quaritch wa that man she had set her heart upon
hi win the match and he wa make an exhibit of himself that
might have caus a schoolboi to blush
onli edward cossei smile grimli as he told hi bearer to give the two
and a half brace which he had shot to georg
last drive thi next gentlemen said that univers functionari as
he survei the colonel on frenchman and then glanc sadli at
the telltal pile of empti cartridg case ad youll hev to
shoot up colonel thi time if you ar ago to win them there
glove for miss ida mr cossei hev knock up four brace and a half
and you hev onli got a brace look you here sir he went on in a
portent whisper keep forrard of them well forrard fire ahead
and down theyll come of themselv like your a better shot than he
is a long wai you could give him bird sir that you could and
beat him
harold said noth he wa sore tempt to make excus as ani man
would have been and he might with truth have urg that he wa not
accustom to partridgedriv and that on of the gun wa new to
him but he resist manfulli and said never a word
georg place the two gun and then went off to join the beater it
wa a capit spot for a drive for on each side were young larch
plantat slope down toward them like a v the gun be at the
narrow end and level with the point of the plantat which were at
thi spot about a hundr and twenti yard apart in front wa a larg
stretch of open field ly in such a fashion that the bird were
bound to fly straight over the gun and between the gap at the end of
the vshape cover
thei had to wait a long while for the beat wa of consider
extent and thi thei did in silenc till present a coupl of
singl bird appear come down the wind like lightn for a
stiffish breez had sprung up on went to the left over edward
cossei head and he shot it veri neatli but the other catch
sight of harold hat beneath the fenc which wa not a high on
swerv and cross an almost imposs shot nearer sixti than
fifti yard from him
now said ida and he fire and to hi joi down came the bird with
a thud bound full two feet into the air with the forc of it
impact be inde shot through the head
that better said ida as she hand him the second gun
anoth moment and a covei came over high up he fire both barrel
and got a right and left and snatch the second gun sent anoth
barrel after them hit a third bird which did not fall and then
a nobl enthusiasm and certainti possess him and he knew that he
should miss no more nor did he with two almost imposs except
he drop everi bird that drive but hi crown glori a thing
whereof he still often dream wa yet to come
he had kill four brace of partridg and fire eleven time when at
last the beater made their appear about two hundr yard awai at
the further end of rather dirti barlei stubbl
i think that is the lot he said im afraid you have lost your
glove ida
scarc were the word out of hi mouth when there wa a yell of
mark and a strong covei of bird appear swoop down the wind
right on to him
on thei came scatter and rather stringi harold grip hi gun
and drew a deep breath while ida kneel at hi side her lip
apart and her beauti ey wide open watch their advent through
a space in the hedg love enough she look to charm the heart of
ani man if a man out partridgedriv could descend to such
frivol which we hold to be imposs
now is the moment the lead brace ar someth over fifti yard
awai and he know full well that if there is to be a chanc left for
the second gun he must shoot befor thei ar five yard nearer
bang down come the old cock bird bang and hi mate follow
him fall with a smash into the fenc
quick as light ida take the empti gun with on hand and as he swing
round pass him the cock and load on with the other bang
anoth bird toppl head first out of the thin covei thei ar
nearli sixti yard awai now bang again and oh joi and wonder
the last bird turn right over backward and fall dead as a stone
some seventi pace from the muzzl of the gun
he had kill four bird out of a singl driven covei which as
shooter well know is a feat not often done even by the best drive
shot
bravo said ida i wa sure that you could shoot if you chose
ye he answer it wa pretti good work and he commenc
collect the bird for by thi time the beater were across the
field thei were all dead not a runner in the lot and there were
exactli six brace of them just as he pick up the last georg
arriv follow by edward cossei
well i niver said the former while someth resembl a smile
stole over hi melancholi counten if that beant the masterest
bit of shoot that ever i did see lord walsingham couldnt hardli
beat that hisselffifteen empti case and twelv bird pick up
why and he turn to edward bless me sir if i dont believ the
colonel ha won them glove for miss ida after all let see sir
you got two brace thi last drive and on the first and a leash the
second and two brace and a half the third six and a half brace in
all and the colonel ye he hev seven brace on bird to the good
there mr cossei said ida smile sweetli i have won my glove
mind you dont forget to pai them
oh i will not forget miss de la moll said he smile also but
not too prettili i suppos he said address the colonel that
the last covei twist up and you brown them
no he answer quietli all four were clear shot
mr cossei smile again as he turn awai to hide hi vexat an
incredul smile which somehow sent harold quaritch blood leap
through hi vein more quickli than wa good for him edward cossei
would rather have lost a thousand pound than that hi adversari
should have got that extra bird for not onli wa he a jealou shot
but he knew perfectli well that ida wa anxiou that he should lose
and desir abov all thing to see him humili and then he the
smartest shot within ten mile round to be beaten by a middleag
soldier shoot with a strang gun and total unaccustom to
driven bird why the stori would be told over the counti georg
would see to that hi anger wa so great when he thought of it that
afraid of make himself ridicul he set off with hi bearer
toward the castl without anoth word leav the other to follow
ida look after him and smile he is so conceit she said he
cannot bear to be beaten at anyth
i think that you ar rather hard on him said the colonel for the
joke had an unpleas side which jar upon hi tast
at ani rate she answer with a littl stamp it is not for you
to sai so if you dislik him as much as i do you would be hard on
him too besid i daresai that hi turn is come
the colonel winc as well he might but look at her handsom
face set just now like steel at the thought of what the futur might
bring forth he reflect that if edward cossei turn did come he wa
by no mean sure that the ultim triumph would rest with him ida de
la moll to whatev extent her sens of honour and monei
indebted might carri her wa no butterfli to be broken on a
wheel but a woman whose dislik and anger or wors still whose
cold unvari disdain wa a thing from which the boldest heart
man might shrink aghast
noth more wa said on the subject and thei began to talk though
somewhat constrainedli about indiffer matter thei were both
awar that it wa a farc and that thei were plai a part for
beneath the extern ic of formal the river of their devot
ran strongwhith thei knew not all that had been made clear a few
night back but what will you have necess overrid their
desir compel them along the path of selfdeni and like wise
folk thei recognis the fact for there is noth more pain in
the world than the outburst of hopeless affect
and so thei talk about paint and shoot and what not till thei
reach the grei old castl tower here harold want to bid her
goodby but she persuad him to come in and have some tea sai
that her father would like to sai goodnight to him
accordingli he went into the vestibul where there wa a light for
it wa get dusk and here he found the squir and mr cossei as
soon as he enter edward cossei rose said goodnight to the squir
and ida and then pass toward the door where the colonel wa
stand rub the mud off hi shoot boot as he came harold
be slightli asham of the busi of the shoot match and veri
sorri to have humili a man who pride himself so much upon hi
skill in a particular branch of sport held out hi hand and said in a
friendli tone
goodnight mr cossei next time that we ar out shoot togeth i
expect i shall be nowher it wa an aw fluke of mine kill those
four bird
edward cossei took no notic of the friendli word or outstretch
hand but came straight on as though he intend to walk past him
the colonel wa wonder what it wa best to do for he could not
mistak the mean of the oversight when the squir who wa
sometim veri quick to notic thing spoke in a loud and decid
tone
mr cossei he said colonel quaritch is offer you hi hand
i observ that he is he answer set hi handsom face but i
do not wish to take colonel quaritch hand
then came a moment silenc which the squir again broke
when a gentleman in my hous refus to take the hand of anoth
gentleman he said veri quietli i think that i have a right to ask
the reason for hi conduct which unless that reason is a veri
suffici on is almost as much a slight upon me as upon him
i think that colonel quaritch must know the reason and will not
press me to explain said edward cossei
i know of no reason repli the colonel sternli unless inde it
is that i have been so unfortun as to get the best of mr cossei in
a friendli shoot match
colonel quaritch must know well that thi is not the reason to which
i allud said edward if he consult hi conscienc he will
probabl discov a better on
ida and her father look at each other in surpris while the colonel
by a half involuntari movement step between hi accus and the
door and ida notic that hi face wa white with anger
you have made a veri seriou implic against me mr cossei he
said in a cold clear voic befor you leav thi room you will be so
good as to explain it in the presenc of those befor whom it ha been
made
certainli if you wish it he answer with someth like a sneer
the reason why i refus to take your hand colonel quaritch is that
you have been guilti of conduct which prove to me that you ar not a
gentleman and therefor not a person with whom i desir to be on
friendli term shall i go on
most certainli you will go on answer the colonel
veri well the conduct to which i refer is that you were onc engag
to my aunt julia heston that within three dai of the time of the
marriag you desert and jilt her in a most cruel wai as a
consequ of which she went mad and is to thi moment an inmat of
an asylum
ida gave an exclam of astonish and the colonel start
while the squir look at him curious wait to hear what he had
to sai
it is perfectli true mr cossei he answer that i wa engag
twenti year ago to be marri to miss julia heston though i now for
the first time learn that she wa your aunt it is also quit true
that that engag wa broken off under most pain circumst
within three dai of the time fix for the marriag what those
circumst were i am not at liberti to sai for the simpl reason
that i gave my word not to do so but thi i will sai that thei were
not to my discredit though you mai not be awar of that fact but as
you ar on of the famili mr cossei my tongu is not ti and i
will do myself the honour of call upon you tomorrow and explain
them to you after that he ad significantli i shall requir you
to apologis to me as publicli as you have accus me
you mai requir but whether i shall compli is anoth matter said
edward cossei and he pass out
i am veri sorri mr de la moll said the colonel as soon as he
had gone more sorri than i can sai that i should have been the
caus of thi most unpleas scene i also feel that i am place in a
veri fals posit and until i produc mr cossei written apolog
that posit must to some extent continu if i fail to obtain that
apolog i shall have to consid what cours to take in the
meanwhil i can onli ask you to suspend your judgment
chapter xxiii
the blow fall
on the follow morn about ten oclock while edward cossei wa
still at breakfast a dogcart drew up at hi door and out of it
step colonel quaritch
now for the row said he to himself i hope that the governor wa
right in hi tale that all perhap it would have been wiser to sai
noth till i had made sure and he pour out some more tea a
littl nervous for in the colonel he had he felt an adversari not
to be despis
present the door open and colonel quaritch wa announc he
rose and bow a salut which the colonel whose face bore a
particularli grim express did not return
will you take a chair he said as soon as the servant had left and
without speak harold took oneand present began the
convers
last night mr cossei he said you thought proper to publicli
bring a charg against me which if it were true would go a long wai
toward show that i wa not a fit person to associ with those
befor whom it wa brought
ye said edward coolli
befor make ani remark on your conduct in bring such a charg
which i give you credit for believ to be true i purpos to show to
you that it is a fals charg went on the colonel quietli the
stori is a veri simpl on and so sad that noth short of necess
would forc me to tell it i wa when quit young engag to your
aunt miss heston to whom i wa much attach and who wa then
twenti year of ag though i had littl besid my profess she
had monei and we were go to be marri the circumst under
which the marriag wa broken off were as followthre dai befor
the wed wa to take place i went unexpectedli to the hous and
wa told by the servant that miss heston wa upstair in her sit
room i went upstair to the room which i knew well knock and got
no answer then i walk into the room and thi is what i saw your
aunt wa ly on the sofa in her wed dress that is in half of
it for she had onli the skirt on as i first thought asleep i went
up to her and saw that by her side wa a brandi bottl half empti
in her hand also wa a glass contain raw brandi while i wa
wonder what it could mean she woke up got off the sofa and i saw
that she wa intox
it a lie said edward excitedli
be care what you sai sir answer the colonel and wait to sai
it till i have done
as soon as i realis what wa the matter i left the room again and
go down to your grandfath studi where he wa engag in
write a sermon i ask him to come upstair as i fear that hi
daughter wa not well he came and saw and the sight threw him off
hi balanc for he broke out into a torrent of explan and
excus from which in time i extract the follow factsit
appear that ever sinc she wa a child miss heston had been
addict to drink fit and that it wa on account of thi
constitut weak which wa of cours conceal from me that
she had been allow to engag herself to a penniless subaltern it
appear too that the habit wa hereditari for her mother had di
from the effect of drink and on of her aunt had becom mad from
it
i went awai and thought the matter over and came to the conclus
that under these circumst it would be imposs for me much as
i wa attach to your aunt to marri her becaus even if i were
will to do so i had no right to run the risk of bring children
into the world who might inherit the curs have come to thi
determin which it cost me much to do i wrote and commun
it to your grandfath and the marriag wa broken off
i do not believ it i do not believ a word of it said edward
jump up you jilt her and drove her mad and now you ar try
to shelter yourself behind a tissu of falsehood
ar you acquaint with your grandfath handwrit ask the
colonel quietli
ye
is that it he went on produc a yellowlook letter and
show it to him
i believ soat least it look like it
then read the letter
edward obei it wa on written in answer to that of harold quaritch
to hi betroth father and admit in the clearest term the
justic of the step that he had taken further it beg him for the
sake of julia and the famili at larg never to mention the caus of
hi defect to ani on outsid the famili
ar you satisfi mr cossei i have other letter if you wish to
see them
edward made no repli and the colonel went oni gave the promis
your grandfath ask for and in spite of the remark that were
freeli made upon my behaviour i kept it as it wa my duti to do
you mr cossei ar the first person to whom the stori ha been told
and now that you have thought fit to make accus against me
which ar without foundat i must ask you to retract them as fulli
as you made them i have prepar a letter which you will be so good
as to sign and he hand him a note address to the squir it ran
dear mr de la moll
i beg in the fullest and most ampl manner possibl to retract the
charg which i made yesterdai even against colonel quaritch
in the presenc of yourself and miss de la moll i find that
those charg were unfound and i herebi apologis to colonel
quaritch for have made them
and suppos that i refus to sign said edward sulkili
i do not think answer the colonel that you will refus
edward look at colonel quaritch and the colonel look at edward
well said the colonel pleas understand i mean that you should
sign thi letter and inde see how absolut you ar in the
wrong i do not think that you can hesit to do so
then veri slowli and unwillingli edward cossei took up a pen affix
hi signatur to the letter blot it and push it from him
the colonel fold it up place it in an envelop which he had readi
and put it in hi pocket
now mr cossei he said i will wish you goodmorn anoth
time i should recommend you to be more care both of your fact and
the manner of your accus and with a slight bow he left the
room
curs the fellow thought edward to himself as the front door
close he had me therei wa forc to sign well i will be even
with him about ida at ani rate i will propos to her thi veri dai
bell or no bell and if she wont have me i will call the monei in
and smash the whole thing upand hi handsom face bore a veri evil
look as he thought of it
that veri afternoon he start in pursuanc of thi design to pai a
visit to the castl the squir wa out but miss de la moll wa at
home he wa usher into the drawingroom where ida wa work for
it wa a wet and windi afternoon
she rose to greet him coldli enough and he sat down and then came a
paus which she did not seem inclin to break
at last he spoke did the squir get my letter miss de la moll he
ask
ye she answer rather icili colonel quaritch sent it up
i am veri sorri he ad confusedli that i should have put myself
in such a fals posit i hope that you will give me credit for
have believ my accus when i made it
such accus should not be lightli made mr cossei wa her
answer and as though to turn the subject she rose and rang the bell
for tea
it came and the bustl connect with it prevent ani further
convers for a while at length howev it subsid and onc
more edward found himself alon with ida he look at her and felt
afraid the woman wa of a differ clai to himself and he knew it
he love her but he did not understand her in the least howev if
the thing wa to be done at all it must be done now so with a
desper effort he brought himself to the point
miss de la moll he said and ida know full sure what wa
come felt her heart jump within her bosom and then stand still
miss de la moll he repeat perhap you will rememb a
convers that pass between us some week ago in the
conservatori
ye she said i rememberabout the monei
about the monei and other thing he said gather courag i
hint to you then that i hope in certain conting to be allow
to make my address to you and i think that you understood me
i understood you perfectli answer ida her pale face set like
ic and i gave you to understand that in the event of your lend
my father the monei i should hold myself bound toto listen to what
you had to sai
oh never mind the monei broke in edward it is not a question of
monei with me ida it is not inde i love you with all my heart i
have love you ever sinc i saw you it wa becaus i wa jealou of
him that i made a fool of myself last night with colonel quaritch i
should have ask you to marri me long ago onli there were obstacl
in the wai i love you ida there never wa a woman like younev
she listen with the same set face obvious he wa in earnest but
hi earnest did not move her it scarc even flatter her
pride she dislik the man intens and noth that he could sai
or do would lessen that dislik by on jotprob inde it would
onli intensifi it
present he stop hi breast heav and hi face broken with
emot and tri to take her hand
she withdrew it sharpli
i do not think that there is ani need for all thi she said coldli
i gave a condit promis you have fulfil your share of the
bargain and i am prepar to fulfil mine in due cours
so far as her word went edward could find no fault with their
mean and yet he felt more like a man who ha been abruptli and
final refus than on declar chosen he stood still and look at
her
i think it right to tell you howev she went on in the same
measur tone that if i marri you it will be from motiv of duti
and not from motiv of affect i have no love to give you and i do
not wish for your i do not know if you will be satisfi with thi
if you ar not you had better give up the idea and for the first
time she look up at him with more anxieti in her face than she would
have care to show
but if she hope that her cold would repel him she wa destin
to be disappoint on the contrari like water thrown on burn oil
it onli inflam him the more
the love will come ida he said and onc more he tri to take her
hand
no mr cossei she said in a voic that check him i am sorri
to have to speak so plainli but till i marri i am my own mistress
prai understand me
as you like he said draw back from her sulkili i am so fond
of you that i will marri you on ani term and that is the truth i
have howev on thing to ask of you ida and it is that you will
keep our engag secret for the present and get your father i
suppos i must speak to him to do the same i have reason he went
on by wai of explan for not wish it to becom known
i do not see why i should keep it secret she said but it doe not
matter to me
the fact is he explain my father is a veri curiou man and i
doubt if he would like my engag becaus he think i ought to
marri a great deal of monei
oh inde answer ida she had believ as wa inde the case
that there were other reason not unconnect with mr quest on
account of which he wa anxiou to keep the engag secret by the
wai she went on i am sorri to have to talk of busi but thi
is a busi matter is it not i suppos it is understood that in
the event of our marriag the mortgag you hold over thi place will
not be enforc against my father
of cours not he answer look here ida i will give you those
mortgag bond as a wed present and you can put them in the fire
and i will make a good settlement on you
thank you she said but i do not requir ani settlement on myself
i had rather none wa made but i consent to the engag onli on
the express condit that the mortgag shall be cancel befor
marriag and as the properti will ultim come to me thi is not
much to ask and now on more thing mr cossei i should like to know
when you would wish thi marriag to take place not yet i presum
i could wish it to take place tomorrow he said with an attempt at
a laugh but i suppos that between on thing and anoth it cant
come off at onc shall we sai thi time six month that will be in
mai
veri good said ida thi dai six month i shall be prepar to
becom your wife mr cossei i believ she ad with a flash of
bitter sarcasm it is the time usual allow for the redempt of
a mortgag
you sai veri hard thing he answer winc
do i i daresai i am hard by natur i wonder that you can wish to
marri me
i wish it beyond everyth in the world he answer earnestli
you can never know how much by the wai i know i wa foolish about
colonel quaritch but ida i cannot bear to see that man near you i
hope that you will now drop hi acquaint as much as possibl
onc more ida face set like a flint i am not your wife yet mr
cossei she said when i am you will have a right to dictat to me
as to whom i shall associ with at present you have no such right
and if it pleas me to associ with colonel quaritch i shall do
so if you disapprov of my conduct the remedi is simpley can
break off the engag
he rose absolut crush for ida wa by far the stronger of the
two and besid hi passion gave her an unfair advantag over him
without attempt a repli he held out hi hand and said goodnight
for he wa afraid to ventur on ani demonstr of affect ad
that he would come to see her father in the morn
she touch hi outstretch hand with her finger and then fear
lest he should chang hi mind promptli rang the bell
in anoth minut the door had close behind him and she wa left
alon
chapter xxiv
goodby my dear goodby
when edward cossei had gone ida rose and put her hand to her head
so the blow had fallen the deed wa done and she wa engag to be
marri to edward cossei and harold quaritch well there must be an
end to that it wa hard tooonli a woman could know how hard ida
wa not a person with a long record of love affair onc when she
wa twenti she had receiv a propos which she had refus and
that wa all so it happen that when she becam attach to colonel
quaritch she had found her heart for the first time and for a woman
somewhat late in life consequ her feel were all the more
profound and so inde wa her grief at be forc not onli to put
them awai but to give herself to anoth man who wa not agreeabl to
her she wa not a violent or illregul woman like mr quest she
look fact in the face recognis their mean and bow befor
their inexor logic it seem to her almost imposs that she
could hope to avoid thi marriag and if that prove to be so she
might be reli upon to make the best of it scandal would under ani
circumst never find a word to sai against ida for she wa not a
person who could attempt to consol herself for an unhappi marriag
but it wa bitter bitter as gall to be thu forc to turn asid
from her happinessfor she well knew that with harold quaritch her
life would be veri happyand fit her shoulder to thi heavi yoke
well she had save the place to her father and also to her
descend if she had ani and that wa all that could be said
she thought and thought wish in the bitter of her heart that
she had never been born to come to such a heavi dai till at last she
could think no more the air of the room seem to stifl her though
it wa by no mean overh she went to the window and look out
it wa a wild wet even and the wind drove the rain befor it in
sheet in the west the lurid rai of the sink sun stain the
cloud blood red and broke in arrow of omin light upon the
drive storm
but bad as wa the weather it attract ida when the heart is heavi
and torn by conflict passion it seem to answer to the call of
the storm and to long to lose it petti troubl in the turmoil of
the rush world natur ha mani mood of which our own ar but the
echo and reflect and she can be companion when all human
sympathi must fail for she is our mother from whom we come to whom
we go and her arm ar ever open to clasp the children who can hear
her voic drawn thereto by an impuls which she could not have
analys ida went upstair put on a thick pair of boot a macintosh
and an old hat then she salli out into the wind and wet it wa
blow big gun and as the rain whirl down the drop struck upon
her face like sprai she cross the moat bridg and went out into
the parkland beyond the air wa full of dead leav and the grass
rustl with them as though it were aliv for thi wa the first wind
sinc the frost the great bough of the oak rattl and groan
abov her and high overhead among the sullen cloud a flight of
rook were be blown thi wai and that
ida bent her tall form against the rain and gale and fought her wai
through them at first she had no clear idea as to where she wa
go but present perhap from custom she took the path that ran
across the field to honham church it wa a beauti old church
particularli as regard the tower on of the finest in the counti
which had been partial blown down and rebuilt about the time of
charl i the church itself had origin been found by the
boissei famili and consider enlarg by the widow of a de la
moll whose husband had fallen at agincourt as a memori for
ever there upon the porch were carv the hawk of the de la
moll wreath round with palm of victori and there too within
the chancel hung the warrior helmet and hi dint shield
nor wa he alon for all around lai the dust of hi kindr come
after the toil and struggl of their stormi live to rest within the
wall of that old church some of them had monument of alabast
whereon thei lai in effigi their head pillow upon that of a
conquer saracen some had monument of oak and brass and some had
no monument at all for the puritan had ruthlessli destroi them
but thei were nearli all there nearli twenti gener of the
bearer of an ancient name for even those of them who perish on the
scaffold had been born here for burial the place wa eloqu of the
dead and of the mourn lesson of mortal from centuri to centuri
the bearer of that name had walk in these field and live in
yonder castl and look upon the familiar swell of yonder ground and
the silver flash of yonder river and now their ash were gather
here and all the forgotten turmoil of their live wa lost in the
silenc of those narrow tomb
ida love the spot hallow to her not onli by the altar of her
faith but also by the human associ that clung around and
cloth it as the ivi cloth it wall here she had been christen
and here among her ancestor she hope to be buri also here as a
girl when the full moon wa up she had crept in aw silenc with
her brother jame to look through the window at the white and solemn
figur stretch within here too she had sat on sundai after
sundai for more than twenti year and stare at the quaint latin
inscript cut on marbl slab record the almost superhuman
virtu of depart de la moll of the eighteenth centuri her own
immedi ancestor the place wa familiar to her whole life she had
scarc a recollect with which it wa not in some wai connect
it wa not wonder therefor that she love it and that in the
troubl of her mind her feet shape their cours toward it
present she wa in the churchyard take her stand under the
shelter of a line of scotch fir through which the gale sob and
sang she leant against a side gate and look the scene wa desol
enough rain drop from the roof on to the sodden grave beneath
and ran in thin sheet down the flint face of the tower the dead
leav whirl and rattl about the empti porch and over all shot
on red and angri arrow from the sink sun she stood in the storm
and rain gaze at the old church that had seen the end of so mani
sorrow more bitter than her own and the wreck of so mani summer
till the dark began to close round her like a pall while the wind
sung the requiem of her hope ida wa not of a despond or
pessimist charact but in that bitter hour she found it in her
heart as most peopl have at on time or anoth in their live to
wish the tragedi over and the curtain down and that she lai beneath
those drip sod without sight or hear without hope or dread
it seem to her that the hereaft must inde be terribl if it
outweigh the sorrow of the here
and then poor woman she thought of the long year between her and
rest and lean her head against the gatepost began to cry
bitterli in the gloom
present she ceas cry and with a start look up feel that
she wa no longer alon her instinct had not deceiv her for in
the shadow of the fir tree not more than two pace from her wa the
figur of a man just then he took a step to the left which brought
hi outlin against the sky and ida heart stood still for now she
knew him it wa harold quaritch the man over whose loss she had been
weep
it veri odd she heard him sai for she wa to leeward of him
but i could have sworn that i heard somebodi sob i suppos it
wa the wind
ida first idea wa flight and she made a movement for that purpos
but in do so trip over a stick and nearli fell
in a minut he wa by her side she wa caught and perhap she wa
not altogeth sorri especi as she had tri to get awai
who is it what the matter said the colonel light a fuse
under her ey it wa on of those flame fuse and burnt with a
blue light show ida tall figur and beauti face all stain
with grief and tear show her wet macintosh and the gatepost
against which she had been leaningshow everyth
why ida he said in amaz what ar you do here cry too
im not cry she said with a sob it the rain that ha made
my face wet
just then the light burnt out and he drop it
what is it dear what is it he said in great distress for the
sight of her alon in the wet and dark and in tear move him beyond
himself inde he would have been no man if it had not
she tri to answer but she could not and in anoth minut to tell
the honest truth she had exchang the gatepost for harold broad
shoulder and wa finish her cry there
now to see a young and pretti woman weep more especi if she
happen to be weep on your shoulder is a veri try thing it is
try even if you do not happen to be in love with her at all but if
you ar in love with her howev littl it is dread wherea if
as in the present case you happen to worship her more perhap than
it is good to worship ani fallibl human creatur then the sight is
posit overpow and so inde it prove in the present
instanc the colonel could not bear it but lift her head from hi
shoulder he kiss her sweet face again and again
what is it darl he said what is the matter
leav go of me and i will tell you she answer
he obei though with some unwilling
she hunt for her handkerchief and wipe her ey and then at last
she spoke

to mr cossei
then for about the first time in hi life harold quaritch swore
violent in the presenc of a ladi
oh damn it all he said

reecho it in some feminin equival

alwai rememb that i had to do ith advanc the monei on the
express condit and even if i could pai back the monei i suppos
that i should be bound to carri out the bargain it is not the monei

bitter and jealousi

on address him for the first time in her life by hi christian
name for she felt that after cry upon a man shoulder it is
ridicul to scrupl about call him by hi name harold there is
no help for it i did it myself rememb becaus as i told you i
do not think that ani on woman ha a right to place her individu
happi befor the welfar of her famili and i am onli sorri she

an hour afterward ida came down into the drawingroom dress for
dinner look rather pale but otherwis quit herself present the
squir arriv he had been at a magistr meet and had onli
just got home
why ida he said i could not find you anywher i met georg as i

to the subject that night
chapter xxv
the squir give hi consent
edward cossei did not come awai from the scene of hi engag in a
veri happi or triumphant tone of mind ida bitter word stung like
whip and he understood and she clearli meant he should understand
that it wa onli in consider of the monei advanc that she had
consent to becom hi wife now howev satisfactori it is to be
rich enough to purchas your heart desir in thi fashion it is not
altogeth sooth to the pride of a nineteenthcenturi man to be
continu haunt by the thought that he is a buyer in the market
and noth but a buyer of cours he saw clearli enough that there
wa an object in all thish saw that ida by make obviou her
dislik wish to disgust him with hi bargain and escap from an
allianc of which the prospect wa hate to her but he had no
intent of be so easili discourag in the first place hi
passion for the woman wa as a devour flame eat ever at hi
heart in that at ani rate he wa sincer he did love her so far as
hi natur wa capabl of love or at ani rate he had the keenest
desir to make her hi wife a delicatemind man would probabl have
shrunken from forc himself upon a woman under parallel
circumst but edward cossei did not happen to fall into that
categori as a matter of fact such men ar not as common as thei might
be
anoth thing which he took into account wa that ida would probabl
get over her dislik he wa a close observ of women in a cynic
and half contemptu wai and he remark or thought that he
remark a curiou tendenc among them to submit with compar
complac to the inevit whenev it happen to coincid with
their materi advantag women he argu have not as a class
outgrown the tradit of their primit condit when their
partner for life were chosen for them by lot or the chanc of battl
thei still recognis the claim of the wealthiest or strongest and
their love of luxuri and eas is so keen that if the nest thei lie in
is onli soft enough thei will not griev long over the fact that it
wa not of their own choos argu from these untrustworthi
premis he came to the conclus that ida would soon get over her
repugn to marri him when she found how mani comfort and good
thing marriag with so rich a man would place at her dispos and
would if for no other reason learn to look on him with affect and
gratitud as the author of her gild eas and so inde she might
have done had she been of anoth and more common stamp but
unfortun for hi reason there exist member of her sex who
ar by natur of an order of mind superior to these consider
and who realis that thei have but on life to live and that the
highest form of happi is not depend upon monei or monei
worth but rather upon the indulg of mental aspir and those
affect which when genuin draw nearer to holi than anyth
els about us such a woman more especi if she is alreadi
possess with an affect for anoth man doe not easili becom
reconcil to a distast lot howev quietli she mai endur it
and such a woman wa ida de la moll
edward cossei when he reach boisingham on the even of hi
engag at onc wrote and post a note to the squir sai that
he would call on the follow morn about a matter of busi
accordingli at halfpast ten oclock he arriv and wa shown into
the vestibul where he found the old gentleman stand with hi back
to the fire and plung in reflect
well mr de la moll said edward rather nervous so soon as he
had shaken hand i do not know if ida ha spoken to you about what
took place between us yesterdai
ye he said ye she told me someth to the effect that she had
accept a propos of marriag from you subject to my consent of
cours but realli the whole thing is so sudden that i have hardli had
time to consid it
it is veri simpl said edward i am deepli attach to your
daughter and i have been so fortun as to be accept by her
should you give your consent to the marriag i mai as well sai at
onc that i wish to carri out the most liber monei arrang in
my power i will make ida a present of the mortgag that i hold over
thi properti and she mai put it in the fire further i will
coven on the death of my father which cannot now be long delai
to settl two hundr thousand pound upon her absolut also i am
prepar to agre that if we have a son and he should wish to do so
he shall take the name of de la moll
i am sure said the squir turn round to hide hi natur
gratif at these propos your offer on the subject of
settlement ar of a most liber order and of cours so far as i am
concern ida will have thi place which mai on dai be again more
valuabl than it is now
i am glad that thei meet with your approv said edward and now
there is on more thing i want to ask you mr de la moll and which
i hope if you give your consent to the marriag you will not rais
ani object to it is that our engag should not be announc
at present the fact is he went on hurriedli my father is a veri
peculiar man and ha a great idea of my marri somebodi with a
larg fortun also hi state of health is so uncertain that there is
no possibl of know how he will take anyth inde he is
dy the doctor told me that he might go off ani dai and that he
cannot last for anoth three month if the engag is announc
to him now at the best i shall have a great deal of troubl and at
the worst he might make me suffer in hi will should he happen to
take a fanci against it
umph said the squir i dont quit like the idea of a project
marriag with my daughter miss de la moll of honham castl be
hush up as though there were someth discredit about it but
still there mai be peculiar circumst in the case which would
justifi me in consent to that cours you ar both old enough to
know your own mind and the match would be as advantag for you as
it could be to us for even nowadai famili and i mai even sai
person appear still go for someth where matrimoni is
concern i have reason to know that your father is a peculiar man
veri peculiar ye on the whole though i dont like hole and corner
affair i shall have no object to the engag not be
announc for the next month or two
thank you for consid me so much said edward with a sigh of
relief then am i to understand that you give your consent to our
engag
the squir reflect for a moment everyth seem quit straight
and yet he suspect crooked hi latent distrust of the man
which had not been decreas by the scene of two night beforefor he
never could bring himself to like edward cosseyaros in forc and
made him hesit when there wa no visibl ground for hesit he
possess as ha been said an instinct insight into charact
that wa almost feminin in it intens and it wa lift a
warn finger befor him now
i dont quit know what to sai he repli at length the whole
affair is so suddenand to tell you the truth i thought that ida had
bestow her affect in anoth direct
edward face darken i thought so too he answer until
yesterdai when i wa so happi as to be undeceiv i ought to tell
you by the wai he went on run awai from the covert falsehood
in hi last word as quickli as he could how much i regret i wa the
caus of that scene with colonel quaritch more especi as i find
that there is an explan of the stori against him the fact is i
wa foolish enough to be vex becaus he beat me out shoot and
also becaus well ii wa jealou of him
ah ye said the squir rather coldli a most unfortun affair
of cours i dont know what the particular of the matter were and
it is no busi of mine but speak gener i should sai never
bring an accus of that sort against a man at all unless you ar
driven to it and if you do bring it be quit certain of your ground
howev that is neither here nor there well about thi engag
ida is old enough to judg for herself and seem to have made up her
mind so as i know no reason to the contrari and as the busi
arrang propos ar all that i could wish i cannot see that i
have ani ground for withhold my consent so all i can sai sir is
that i hope you will make my daughter a good husband and that you
will both be happi ida is a highspirit woman but in my opinion
she is greatli abov the averag of her sex as i have known it and
provid you have her affect and dont attempt to drive her she
will go through thick and thin for you but i dare sai you would like
to see her oh by the wai i forgot she ha got a headach thi
morn and is stop in bed it isnt much in her line but i
daresai that she is a littl upset perhap you would like to come up
to dinner tonight
thi proposit edward know full well that ida headach wa a
devic to rid herself of the necess of see him accept with
gratitud and went
as soon as he had gone ida herself came down
well my dear said the squir cheerfulli i have just had the
pleasur of see edward cossei and i have told him that as you
seem to wish it
here ida made a movement of impati but rememb herself and
said noth
that as you seem to wish that thing should be so i had no ground
of object to your engag i mai as well tell you that the
propos which he make as regard settlement ar of the most
liber natur
ar thei answer ida indiffer is mr cossei come here to
dinner
ye i ask him i thought that you would like to see him
well then i wish you had not she answer with anim
becaus there is noth to eat except some cold beef realli
father it is veri thoughtless of you and she stamp her foot and
went off in a huff leav the squir full of reflect
i wonder what it all mean he said to himself she cant care
about the man much or she would not make that fuss about hi be
ask to dinner ida isnt the sort of woman to be caught by the
monei i should think well i know noth about it it is no affair
of mine and i can onli take thing as i find them
and then he fell to reflect that thi marriag would be an
extraordinari stroke of luck for the famili here thei were at the
last gasp mortgag up the ey when suddenli fortun in the shape
of an on the whole perfectli unobjection young man appear
take up the mortgag propos settlement to the tune of hundr
of thousand and even offer to perpetu the old famili name in the
person of hi son should he have on such a state of affair could
not but be gratifi to ani man howev unworldli and the squir
wa not altogeth unworldli that is he had a keen sens of the
digniti of hi social posit and hi famili and it had all hi life
been hi chief and laudabl desir to be suffici provid with
the good of thi world to rais the de la moll to the posit
which thei had occupi in former centuri hitherto howev the
tendenc of event had been all the other wayth hous wa a sink
on and but the other dai it ancient roof had nearli fallen about
their ear but now the prospect chang as though by magic on ida
marriag all the mortgag those heavi accumul of year of
grow expenditur and narrow mean would roll off the back of
the estat and the de la moll of honham castl would onc more take
the place in the counti to which thei were undoubtedli entitl
it is not wonder that the prospect prove a pleas on to him or
that hi head wa fill with vision of splendour to come
as it chanc on that veri morn it wa necessari for mr quest to
pai the old gentleman a visit in order to obtain hi signatur to a
leas of a bakeri in boisingham which togeth with two or three
other hous belong to the estat
he arriv just as the squir wa in the full flow of hi medit
and it would not have need a man of mr quest penetr and
power of observ to discov that he had someth on hi mind
which he wa long for an opportun to talk about
the squir sign the leas without pai the slightest attent to
mr quest explan and then suddenli ask him when the first
interest on the recentlyeffect mortgag came due
the lawyer mention a certain date
ah said the squir then it will have to be met but it doe not
matter it will be for the last time
mr quest prick up hi ear and look at him
the fact is quest he went on by wai of explan that there
arewellfamili arrang pend which will put an end to these
embarrass in a natur and a proper wai
inde said mr quest i am veri glad to hear it
ye ye said the squir unfortun i am under some restraint
in speak about the matter at present or i should like to ask your
opinion for which as you know i have a great respect realli though
i do not know why i should not consult my lawyer on a matter of
busi i onli consent not to trumpet the thing about
lawyer ar confidenti agent said mr quest quietli
of cours thei ar of cours and it is their busi to hold their
tongu i mai reli upon your discret mai i not
certainli said mr quest
well the matter is thi mr edward cossei is engag to miss de la
moll he ha just been here to obtain my consent which of cours i
have not withheld as i know noth against the young mannoth at
all the onli stipul that he made is as i think a reason
on under the circumst name that the engag is to be kept
quiet for a littl while on account of the condit of hi father
health he sai that he is an unreason man and that he might take
a prejudic against it
dure thi announc mr quest had remain perfectli quiet hi
face show no sign of excit onli hi ey shone with a
curiou light
inde he said thi is veri interest new
ye said the squir that is what i meant by sai that there
would be no necess to make ani arrang as to the futur
payment of interest for cossei ha inform me that he propos to
put the mortgag bond in the fire befor hi marriag
inde said mr quest well he could hardli do less could he
altogeth i think you ought to be congratul mr de la moll it
is not often that a man get such a chanc of clear the
encumbr off a properti and now i am veri sorri but i must be
get home as i promis my wife to be back for luncheon as the
thing is to be kept quiet i suppos that it would be prematur for me
to offer my good wish to miss de la moll
ye ye dont sai anyth about it at present well goodby
chapter xxvi
bell pai a visit
mr quest got into hi dogcart and drove homeward full of feel
which it would be difficult to describ
the hour of hi reveng wa come he had plai hi card and he had
won the game and fortun with it for hi enemi lai in the hollow of
hi hand he look behind him at the proud tower of the castl
reflect as he did so that in all probabl thei would belong to
him befor anoth year wa over hi head at on time he had
earnestli long to possess thi place but now thi wa not so much
the object of hi desir what he want now wa the monei with
thirti thousand pound in hi hand he would togeth with what he
had be a rich man and he had alreadi laid hi plan for the futur
of edith he had heard noth late she wa cow but he well knew
that it wa onli for a while byandbi her rapac would get the
better of her fear and she would recomm her persecut thi
be so he came to a determinationh would put the world between
them onc let him have thi monei in hi hand and he would start hi
life afresh in some new countri he wa not too old for it and he
would be a rich man and then perhap he might get rid of the care
which had render so much of hi exist valueless if bell would
go with him well and goodif not he could not help it if she did

is
ye said ida perhap it is better to die but death is not so
easi as for the promis you do not seem to understand that no
gentleman or ladi can break a promis in consider of which monei

she held out her hand but in her humil and shame bell went
without take it and through the angri sunset light walk slowli
back to boisingham and as she walk there wa a look upon her face
that edward cossei would scarc have care to see
chapter xxvii
mr quest ha hi in
all that afternoon and far into the even mr quest wa emploi in
draft and with hi own hand engross on parchment certain deed
for the proper execut of which he seem to find constant refer
necessari to a tin box of paper label honham castl estat
by eleven that night everyth wa finish and have carefulli
collect and docket hi paper he put the tin box awai and went
home to bed
next morn about ten oclock edward cossei wa sit at
breakfast in no happi frame of mind he had gone up to the castl to
dinner on the previou even but it cannot be said that he had
enjoi himself ida wa there look veri handsom in her even
dress but she wa cold as a stone and unapproach as a statu she
scarc spoke to him inde except in answer to some direct remark
reserv all her convers for her father who seem to have
caught the contagion of restraint and wa for him unusu silent
and depress
but onc or twice he found her look at him and then there wa upon
her face a mingl express of contempt and irresist avers
which chill him to the marrow
these qualiti were inde so much more plainli develop toward
himself than thei had been befor that at last a convict which he
at first reject as incred forc itself into hi mind thi
convict wa that bell had disbeliev hi denial of the
engag and in her eager for reveng must have told ida the
whole stori the thought made him feel faint well there wa but on
thing to be donefac it out
onc when the squir back wa turn he had ventur to attempt some
littl verbal tender in which the word dear occur but ida
did not seem to hear it and look straight over hi head into space
thi he felt wa try so try did he find the whole entertain
inde that about halfpast nine he rose and came awai sai that he
had receiv some bank paper which must be attend to that night
now most men would in all human probabl have been dismai by thi
state of affair into relinquish an attempt at matrimoni which it
wa evid could onli be carri through in the face of the quiet but
none the less vigor dislik and contempt of the other contract
parti but thi wa not so with edward cossei ida cold excit
upon hi tenaci and obstin mind much the same effect that mai be
suppos to be produc upon the benight seeker for the north pole
by the sight of a frozen ocean of iceberg like the explor he wa
convinc that if onc he could get over those cold height he would
find a smile sunni land beyond and perchanc mani other delight
and like the explor again he wa metaphor readi to die in
the effort for he love her more everi dai till now hi passion
domin hi physic be and hi mental judgment so that whatev
loss wa entail and whatev obstacl aros he wa determin to
endur and overcom them if by so do he might gain hi end
he wa reflect upon all thi on the morn in question when mr
quest look veri cool compos and gentlemanlik wa shown into
hi room much as colonel quaritch had been shown in two morn
befor
how do you do quest he said in a from high to low tone which he
wa in the habit of adopt toward hi offici subordin sit
down what is it
it is some busi mr cossei the lawyer answer in hi usual
quiet tone
honham castl mortgag again i suppos he growl i onli hope
you dont want ani more monei on that account at present that all
becaus i cant rais anoth cent while my father live thei dont
entail cash and bank share you know and though my credit pretti
good i am not far from the bottom of it
well said mr quest with a faint smile it ha to do with the
honham castl mortgag but as i have a good deal to sai perhap we
had better wait till the thing ar clear
all right just ring the bell will you and take a cigarett
mr quest smile again and rang the bell but did not take the
cigarett when the breakfast thing had been remov he took a chair
and place it on the further side of the tabl in such a posit
that the light which wa to hi back struck full upon edward
cossei face began to deliber unti and sort hi bundl of
paper present he came to the on he wanteda letter it wa not
an origin letter but a copi will you kindli read thi mr
cossei he said quietli as he push the letter toward him across
the tabl
edward finish light hi cigarett then took the letter up and
glanc at it carelessli at sight of the first line hi express
chang to on of absolut horror hi face blanch the perspir
sprang out upon hi forehead and the cigarett drop from hi
finger to the carpet where it lai smoulder nor wa thi
wonder for the letter wa a copi of on of bell most passion
epistl to himself he had never been abl to restrain her from
write these compromis letter inde thi on wa the veri same
that some littl time befor mr quest had abstract from the pocket
of mr cossei loung coat in the room in london
he read on for a littl wai and then put the letter down upon the
tabl there wa no need for him to go further it wa all in the same
strain
you will observ mr cossei that thi is a copi said mr quest
but if you like you can inspect the origin document
he made no answer
now went on mr quest hand him a second paper here is the
copi of anoth letter of which the origin is in your handwrit
edward look at it it wa an intercept letter of hi own date
about a year befor and it content though not of so passion a
natur as the other were of a suffici incrimin charact
he put it down upon the tabl by the side of the first and wait for
mr quest to go on
i have other evid said hi visitor present but you ar
probabl suffici vers in such matter to know that these
letter alon ar almost enough for my purpos that purpos is to
commenc a suit for divorc against my wife in which you will of
cours in accord with the provis of the act be join as
corespond inde i have alreadi drawn up a letter of instruct
to my london agent direct them to take the preliminari step and
he push a third paper toward him
edward cossei turn hi back to hi tormentor and rest hi head
upon hi hand tri to think
mr quest he said present in a hoars voic without admit
anyth there ar reason which would make it ruinou to me if such
an action were commenc at present
ye he answer there ar in the first place there is no know
in what light your father would look on the matter and how hi view of
it would affect your futur interest in the second your engag
to miss de la moll upon which you ar strongli set would certainli
be broken off
how do you know that i am engag ask edward in surpris
it doe not matter how i know it said the lawyer i do know it so
it will be useless for you to deni it as you remark thi suit will
probabl be your ruin in everi wai and therefor it is as you will
easili understand a good moment for a man who want hi reveng to
choos to bring it
without admit anyth answer edward cossei i wish to ask
you a question is there no wai out of thi suppos that i have
done you a wrong wrong admit of compens
ye it doe mr cossei and i have thought of that everybodi ha
hi price in thi world and i have mine but the compens for such
a wrong must be a heavi on
at what price will you agre to stai the action for ever he ask
the price that i will take to stai the action is the transfer into my
name of the mortgag you hold over the honham castl estat
answer mr quest quietli
great heaven said edward why that is a matter of thirti thousand
pound
i know it is and i know also that it is worth your while to pai
thirti thousand pound to save yourself from the scandal the chanc
of disinherit and the certainti of the loss of the woman whom you
want to marri so well do i know it that i have prepar the necessari
deed for your signatur and here thei ar listen sir he went on
sternli refus to accept my term and by tonight post i shall
send thi letter of instruct also i shall send to mr cossei
senior and to mr de la moll copi of these two preciou epistl
and he point to the incrimin document togeth with a copi
of the letter to my agent and where will you be then consent and i
will bind myself not to proce in ani wai or form now make your
choic
but i cannot even if i will i cannot said he almost wring hi
hand in hi perplex it wa on condit of my take up those
mortgag that ida consent to becom engag to me and i have
promis that i will cancel them on our wed will you not take
monei instead
ye answer mr quest i would take monei a littl time ago i
would not have taken it becaus i want that properti now i have
chang my idea but as you yourself said your credit is strain to
the utmost and while your father is aliv you will not find it
possibl to rais anoth thirti thousand pound besid if thi
matter is to be settl at all it must be settl at onc i will not
wait while you make attempt to rais the monei
but about the mortgag i promis to keep them what shall i sai to
ida
sai sai noth you can meet them if you choos after your father
death refus if you like but if you refus you will be mad thirti
thousand pound will be noth to you but exposur will be ruin
have you made up your mind you must take my offer or leav it sign
the document and i will put the origin of those two letter into
your hand refus and i will take my step
edward cossei thought for a moment and then said i will sign let me
see the paper
mr quest turn asid to hide the express of triumph which flit
across hi face and then hand him the deed thei were elabor
drawn for he wa a skil legal draughtsman quit as skil as
mani a lead chanceri conveyanc but the substanc of them wa
that the mortgag were transfer to him by the said edward cossei
in and for the consider that he the said william m quest
consent to abandon for ever a pend action for divorc against hi
wife bell quest whereto the said edward cossei wa to be join as
corespond
you will observ said mr quest that if you attempt to contest
the valid of thi assign which you probabl could not do with
ani prospect of success the attempt must recoil upon your own head
becaus the whole scandal will then transpir we shall requir some
wit so with your permiss i will ring the bell and ask the
landladi and your servant to step up thei need know noth of the
content of the paper and he did so
stop said edward present where ar the origin letter
here answer mr quest produc them from an inner pocket and
show them to him at a distanc when the landladi come up i will
give them to her to hold in thi envelop direct her to hand them
to you when the deed ar sign and wit she will think that it
is part of the ceremoni
present the manserv and the landladi arriv and mr quest in
hi most matteroffact wai explain to them that thei were requir
to wit some document at the same time he hand the letter to
the woman sai that she wa to give them to mr cossei when thei
had all done sign
then edward cossei sign and place hi thumb on the familiar wafer
deliv the variou document as hi act and deed the wit
with much prepar and effort affix their awkward signatur in
the place point out to them and in a few minut the thing wa
done leav mr quest a richer man by thirti thousand pound than
when he had got up that morn
now give mr cossei the packet mr jeffri he said as he
blot the signatur and you can go she did so and went
when the wit had gone edward look at the letter and then
with a savag oath flung them into the fire and watch them burn
goodmorn mr cossei said mr quest as he prepar to part with
the deed you have now bought your experi and had to pai dearli
for it but upon my word when i think of all you ow me i wonder at
myself for let you off at so small a price
as soon as he had gone edward cossei gave wai to hi feel in
languag forcibl rather than polit for now in addit to all the
monei which he had lost and the pain exposur to which he had been
subject he wa face to face with a new difficulti either he must
make a clean breast of it to ida about the mortgag be no longer
in hi hand or he must pretend that he still had them in the first
altern the consider upon which she had agre to marri him
came to noth moreov ida wa therebi releas from her promis
and he wa well awar that under these circumst she would
probabl break off the engag in the second he would be act a
lie and the lie would sooner or later be discov and what then
well if it wa after marriag what would it matter to a woman of
gentl birth there is onli on thing more irretriev than marriag
and that is death anyhow he had suffer so much for the sake of
thi woman that he did not mean to give her up now he must meet the
mortgag after marriag that wa all
facili est descensu averni when a man of the charact of edward
cossei or inde of ani charact allow hi passion to lead him
into a cours of deceit he doe not find it easi to check hi wild
career from dishonour to dishonour shall he go till at length in due
season he reap as he ha sown

chapter xxix
edward cossei meet with an accid
at the best of time thi is not a gai world though no doubt we ought
to pretend that human at larg is as happi as it is repres to
be in let us sai the christma number of an illustr paper how
well we can imagin the thought inhabit of thi countri anno
domini 7500 or thereabout disint from the crumbl remain of
a fireproof safe a christma number of the illustr london new
or the graphic the archaic letter would perhap be unintellig
to him but he would look at the pictur with much the same interest
that we regard bushmen draw or the primit clai figur of
peru and though hi whole artist seventysixth centuri soul would
be revolt at the crude of the colour sure he would
moralis thu oh happi race of primit men how i the child of
light and civilis envi you your longforgotten dai here in
these rude draw which in themselv reveal the extraordinari
capac for pleasur possess by the earli race who could look
upon them and gather gratif from the sight mai we trace your
joyou career from the cradl to the grave here you figur as a babe
at whose appear everybodi seem delight even those of your race
whose inherit will be therebi diminishedand here a merri lad you
revel in the school which the youth of our ag find so wearisom
there grown more old you stand at the altar of a beauti lost
faith a faith that told of hope and peac beyond the grave and by
you stand your blush bride no hard fate no consider of
mean no worldlyminded come to snatch you from her arm as now
thei daili do with her you spend your peac dai and here at last
we see you old but surround by love and tender kind and almost
look forward to that grave which you believ would be but the gate
of glori oh happi race of simplemind men what a commentari upon
our fever avarici pleasureseek ag is thi rude scroll of
primit and infantil art
so will some unborn laudat tempori acti speak in some dim centuri
to be when our sorrow have fade and ar not
and yet though we do not put a record of them in our christma
number troubl ar as troubl have been and will continu be
for howev appar happi the lot of individu it is not
altogeth a cheer world in which we have been call to live at
ani rate so thought harold quaritch on that night of the farewel
scene with ida in the churchyard and so he continu to think for
some time to come a man life is alwai more or less a struggl he
is a swimmer upon an advers sea and to live at all he must keep hi
limb in motion if he grow faintheart or weari and no longer
strive for a littl while he float and then at last moral or
physic he vanish we struggl for our livelihood and for all
that make life worth live in the materi sens and not the less
ar we call upon to struggl with an armi of spiritu woe and
fear which now we vanquish and now ar vanquish by everi man of
refin and mani women will be abl to recal period in hi or
her exist when life ha seem not onli valueless but hate
when our small success such as thei ar dwindl awai and vanish
in the gulf of our mani failur when our hope and aspir fade
like a littl sunset cloud and we were surround by black and lone
mental night from which even the star of faith had pass such a
time had come to harold quaritch now hi dai had not on the whole
been happi dai but he wa a good and earnest man with that touch
faith in provid which is given to some among us and which had
brought with it the reward of an even thank spirit and then out
of the dusk of hi content a hope of happi had arisen like the
angel of the dawn and suddenli life wa aflam with the light of
love and becam beauti in hi ey and now the hope had pass
the woman whom he deepli love and who love him back again had gone
from hi reach and left him desolategon from hi reach not into
the grave but toward the arm of anoth man
our race is call upon to face mani troubl sick poverti and
death but it is doubt if evil hold anoth arrow so sharp as that
which pierc him now he wa no longer young it is true and
therefor did not feel that intens agoni of disappoint passion
that sicken sens of utter loss which in such circumst
sometim settl on the young but if in youth we feel more sharpli
and with a keener sympathi of the imagin we have at least more
strength to bear and hope doe not altogeth die for we know that
we shall live it down or if we do not know it then we do live it
down veri like inde there come a time when we look back upon
our sorrow and he or she who caus it with wonder ye even with
scorn and bitter laughter but it is not so when the blow fall in
later life it mai not hurt so much at the time it mai seem to have
been struck with the bludgeon of fate rather than with her keen
divid sword but the effect is more last and for the rest of
our dai we ar numb and cold for time ha no salv to heal us
these thing harold realis most clearli in the heavi dai which
follow that churchyard separ
he took hi punish like a brave man inde and went about hi
daili occup with a steadfast face but hi bold behaviour did
not lessen it weight he had promis not to go awai till ida wa
marri and he would keep the promis but in hi heart he wonder
how he should bear the sight of her what would it be to see her to
touch her hand to hear the rustl of her dress and the music of her
belov voic and to realis again and yet again that all these
thing were not for him that thei had pass from him into the
ownership of anoth man
on the dai follow that upon which edward cossei had been terrifi
into transfer the honham mortgag to mr quest the colonel went
out shoot he had late becom the possessor of a new hammerless
gun by a wellknown london maker of which he stood in consider
need harold had treat himself to thi gun when he came into hi
aunt littl fortun but it wa onli just complet the weapon wa
a beauti on and at ani other time it would have fill hi
sportsman heart with joi even as it wa when he put it togeth
and balanc it and took imaginari shot at blackbird in the garden
for a littl while he forgot hi sorrow for the woe must inde be
heavi which a new hammerless gun by such a maker cannot do someth
toward lighten so on the next morn he took thi gun and went
to the marsh by the riverwher he wa credibl inform sever
wisp of snipe had been seento attempt to shoot some of them and put
the new weapon to the test
it wa on thi same morn that edward cossei got a letter which
disturb him not a littl it wa from bell quest and ran thu
dear mr cosseywil you come over and see me thi afternoon
about three oclock i shall expect you so i am sure you will
not disappoint mebq
for a long while he hesit what to do bell quest wa at the
present junctur the veri last person whom he wish to see hi
nerv were shaken and he fear a scene but on the other hand he did
not know what danger might threaten him if he refus to go quest had
got hi price and he knew that he had noth more to fear from him
but a jealou woman ha no price and if he did not humour her it
might he felt be at a risk which he could not estim also he wa
nervous anxiou to give no further caus for gossip a sudden
outward and visibl cessat of hi intimaci with the quest might
he thought give rise to surmis and suspicion in a littl countri
town like boisingham where all hi movement were known so albeit
with a faint heart he determin to go
accordingli at three oclock precis he wa shown into the
drawingroom at the oak mr quest wa not there inde he wait
for ten minut befor she came in she wa pale so pale that the
blue vein on her forehead show distinctli through her ivori skin
and there wa a curiou intens about her manner which frighten
him she wa veri quiet also unnatur so inde but her quiet
wa of the omin natur of the silenc befor the storm and when
she spoke her word were keen and quick and vivid
she did not shake hand with him but sat down and look at him
slowli fan herself with a paint ivori fan which she took up from
the tabl
you sent for me bell and here i am he said break the
silenc
then she spoke you told me the other dai she said that you were
not engag to be marri to ida de la moll it is not true you ar
engag to be marri to her
who said so he ask defiantli quest i suppos
i have it on a better author she answer i have it from miss
de la moll herself now listen edward cossei when i let you go i
made a condit and that condit wa that you should not marri
ida de la moll do you still intend to marri her
you had it from ida he said disregard her question then you
must have spoken to iday must have told her everyth i
suspect as much from her manner the other night you
then it is true she broke in coldli it is true and in addit
to your other fail edward you ar a coward anda liar
what is it to you what i am or what i am not he answer savag
what busi is it of your you have no hold over me and no claim
upon me as it is i have suffer enough at your hand and at those of
your accurs husband i have had to pai him thirti thousand pound
do you know that but of cours you know it no doubt the whole thing
is a plant and you will share the spoil
ah she said draw a long breath
and now look here he went on onc and for all i will not be
interf with by you i am engag to marri ida de la moll and
whether you wish it or no i shall marri her and on more thing i
will not allow you to associ with ida do you understand me i will
not allow it
she had been hold the fan befor her face while he spoke now she
lower it and look at him her face wa paler than ever paler than
death if that be possibl but in her ey there shone a light like
the light of a flame
why not she said quietli
why not he answer savag i wonder that you think it necessari
to ask such a question but as you do i will tell you why becaus ida
is the ladi whom i am go to marri and i do not choos that she
should associ with a woman who is what you ar
ah she said again i understand now
at that moment a divers occur the drawingroom look on to the
garden and at the end of the garden wa a door which open into
anoth street
through thi door had come colonel quaritch accompani by mr quest
the former with hi gun under hi arm thei walk up the garden and
were almost at the french window when edward cossei saw them control
yourself he said in a low voic here is your husband
mr quest advanc and knock at the window which hi wife open
when he saw edward cossei he hesit a littl then nod to him
while the colonel came forward and place hi gun by the wall
enter the room shook hand with mr quest and bow coldli to
edward cossei
i met the colonel bell said mr quest come here with the
benevol intent of give you some snipe so i brought him up by
the short wai
that is veri kind of you colonel quaritch said she with a sweet
smile for she had the sweetest smile imagin
he look at her there wa someth about her face which attract
hi attent someth unusu
what ar you look at she ask
you he said bluntli for thei were out of hear of the other two
if i were poetic mind i should sai that you look like the
tragic muse
do i she answer laugh well that is curiou becaus i feel
like comedi herself
there someth wrong with that woman thought the colonel to
himself as he extract two coupl of snipe from hi capaci coat
tail i wonder what it is
just then mr quest and edward cossei pass out into the garden
talk
here ar the snipe mr quest he said i have had rather good
luck i kill four coupl and miss two coupl more but then i had
a new gun and on can never shoot so well with a new gun
oh thank you she said do pull out the painter for me i like
to put them in my ride hat and i can never find them myself
veri well he answer but i must go into the garden to do it
there is not light enough here it get dark so soon now
accordingli he step out through the window and began to hunt for
the pretti littl feather which ar to be found at the angl of a
snipe wing
is that the new gun colonel quaritch said mr quest present
what a beauti on
be care he said i havent taken the cartridg out
if he had been look at her which at that moment he wa not harold
would have seen her stagger and catch at the wall for support then he
would have seen an aw and malevol light of sudden determin
pass across her face
all right she said i know about gun my father us to shoot and
i often clean hi gun and she took the weapon up and began to
examin the engrav on the lock
what is thi she said point to a littl slide abov the lock
on which the word safe wa engrav in gold letter
oh that the safeti bolt he said when you see the word safe
the lock ar bar and the gun wont go off you have to push the
bolt forward befor you can fire
so she said carelessli and suit the action to the word
ye so but pleas be care the gun is load
ye ill be care she answer well it is a veri pretti gun
and so light that i believ i could shoot with it myself
meanwhil edward cossei and mr quest who were walk up the garden
had separ mr quest go to the right across the lawn to pick up
a glove which had drop upon the grass while edward cossei slowli
saunter toward them when he wa about nine pace off he too halt
and stoop a littl look abstractedli at a white japanes
chrysanthemum which wa still in bloom mr quest turn as the
colonel thought to put the gun back against the wall he would have
offer to take it from her but at the moment both hi hand were
occupi in extract on of the painter from a snipe the next
thing he wa awar of wa a loud explos follow by an exclam
or rather a cry from mr quest he drop the snipe and look up
just in time to see the gun which had leapt from her hand with the
recoil strike against the wall of the hous and fall to the ground
instantli whether by instinct or by chanc he never knew he glanc
toward the place where edward cossei stood and saw that hi face wa
stream with blood and that hi right arm hung helpless by hi side
even as he look he saw him put hi uninjur hand to hi head and
without a word or a sound sink down on the gravel path
for a second there wa silenc and the blue smoke from the gun hung
heavili upon the damp autumn air in the midst of it stood bell quest
like on transfix her lip apart her blue ey open wide and
the stamp of terroror wa it guiltupon her pallid face
all thi he saw in a flash and then ran to the bleed heap upon the
gravel
he reach it almost simultan with mr quest and togeth thei
turn the bodi over but still bell stood there envelop in the
heavi smoke
present howev her tranc left her and she ran up flung herself
upon her knee and look at her former lover whose face and head
were now a mass of blood
he is dead she wail he is dead and i have kill him oh
edward edward
mr quest turn on her savag so savag that on might almost
have thought he fear lest in her agoni she should sai someth
further
stop that he said seiz her arm and go for the doctor for if
he is not dead he will soon bleed to death
with an effort she rose put her hand to her forehead and then ran
like the wind down the garden and through the littl door
chapter xxx
harold take the new
mr quest and harold bore the bleed manwheth he wa senseless
or dead thei knew notinto the hous and laid him on the sofa then
have despatch a servant to seek a second doctor in case the on
alreadi gone for wa out thei set to work to cut the cloth from hi
neck and arm and do what thei could and that wa littl enough
toward staunch the bleed it soon howev becam evid that
cossei had onli got the outsid portion of the charg of no 7 that is
to sai he had been struck by about a hundr pellet of the three or
four hundr which would go to the ordinari ounc and an eighth had
he receiv the whole charg he must at that distanc have been
instantli kill as it wa the point of the shoulder wa riddl
and so to a somewhat smaller extent wa the back of hi neck and the
region of the right ear on or two outsid pellet had also struck
the head higher up and the skin and muscl along the back were torn
by the passag of shot
by jove said mr quest i think he is done for
the colonel nod he had some experi of shot wound and the
present wa not of a natur to encourag hope of the patient
surviv
how did it happen ask mr quest present as he mop up the
stream blood with a spong
it wa an accid groan the colonel your wife wa look at
my new gun i told her it wa load and that she must be care
and i thought she had put it down the next thing that i heard wa the
report it is all my curs fault for leav the cartridg in
ah said mr quest she alwai thought she understood gun it is a
shock accid
just then on of the doctor follow by bell quest ran up the lawn
carri a box of instrument and in anoth minut wa at work he
wa a quick and skil surgeon and have announc that the patient
wa not dead at onc began to tie on of the smaller arteri in the
throat which had been pierc and through which edward cossei wa
rapidli bleed to death by the time that thi wa done the other
doctor an older man put in an appear and togeth thei made a
rapid examin of the injuri
bell stood by hold a basin of water she did not speak and on her
face wa that same fix look of horror which harold had observ
after the discharg of the gun
when the examin wa finish the two doctor whisper togeth
for a few second
will he live ask mr quest
we cannot sai answer the older doctor we do not think it like
that he will it depend upon the extent of hi injuri and whether
or no thei have extend to the spine if he doe live he will
probabl be paralys to some extent and must certainli lose the
hear of the right ear
when she heard thi bell sank down upon a chair overwhelm then the
two doctor assist by harold set to work to carri edward cossei
into anoth room which had been rapidli prepar leav mr quest
alon with hi wife
he came stood in front of her look her in the face and then
laugh
upon my word he said we men ar bad enough but you women beat us
in wicked
what do you mean she said faintli
i mean that you ar a murderess bell he said solemnli and you
ar a bungler too you could not hold the gun straight
i deni it she said the gun went off
ye he said you ar wise to make no admiss thei might be
us in evid against you let me counsel you to make no
admiss but now look here i suppos the man will have to lie in
thi hous until he recov or di and that you will help to nurs
him well i will have none of your murder work go on here do
you hear me you ar not to complet at leisur what you have begun in
hast
what do you take me for she ask with some return of spirit do
you think that i would injur a wound man
i do not know he answer with a shrug and as for what i take
you for i take you for a woman whose passion ha made her mad and
he turn and left the room
when thei had carri edward cossei dead or aliveand he look more
like death than lifeup to the room prepar for him see that he
could be of no further us the colonel left the hous with a view of
go to the castl
on hi wai out he look into the drawingroom and there wa mr
quest still sit on the chair and gaze blankli befor her
piti her he enter come cheer up mr quest he said kindli
thei hope that he will live
she made no answer
it is an aw accid but i am almost as culpabl as you for i
left the cartridg in the gun anyhow god will be done
god will she said look up and then onc more relaps into
silenc
he turn to go when suddenli she rose and caught him by the arm
will he die she said almost fierc tell me what you thinknot
what the doctor sai you have seen mani wound men and know better
than thei do tell me the truth
i cannot sai he answer shake hi head
appar she interpret hi answer in the affirm at ani rate
she cover her face with her hand
what would you do colonel quaritch if you had kill the onli thing
you love in the whole world she ask dreamili oh what am i
sayingi am off my head leav mego and tell ida it will be good
new for ida
accordingli he start for the castl have first pick up hi gun
on the spot where it had fallen from the hand of mr quest
and then it wa that for the first time the extraordinari import
of thi dread accid in it bear upon hi own affair flash
upon hi mind if cossei di he could not marri ida that wa clear
thi wa what mr quest must have meant when she said that it would
be good new for ida but how did she know anyth about ida
engag to edward cossei and by jove what did the woman mean
when she ask what he would do if he had kill the onli thing he
love in the world cossei must be the onli thing she love and now
he thought of it when she believ that he wa dead she call him
edward edward
harold quaritch wa as simpl and unsuspici a man as it would be
easi to find but he wa no fool he had move about the world and on
variou occas come in contact with case of thi sort as most
other men have done he knew that when a woman in a moment of
distress call a man by hi christian name it is becaus she is in
the habit of think of him and speak to him by that name not
that there wa much in that by itself but in public she call him
mr cossei edward clearli then wa the onli thing she love
and edward wa secretli engag to ida and mr quest knew it
now when a man who is not her husband ha the fortun or rather the
misfortun to be the onli thing a marri woman ever love and when
that marri woman is awar of the fact of hi devot and engag
to somebodi els it is obviou he reflect that in nine case out
of ten the knowledg will excit strong feel in her breast
feel inde which in some natur would amount almost to mad
when he had first seen mr quest that afternoon she and cossei were
alon togeth and he had notic someth unusu about her
someth unnatur and intens inde he rememb he had told her
that she look like the tragic muse could it be that the look wa
the look of a woman madden by insult and jealousi who wa
medit some fear crime how did that gun go off he did not
see it and he thank heaven that he did not for we ar not alwai
so anxiou to bring our fellow creatur to justic as we might be
especi when thei happen to be young and love women how did it
go off she understood gun he could see that from the wai she
handl it wa it like that it explod of itself or ow to an
accident touch of the trigger it wa possibl but not like
still such thing have been known to happen and it would be veri
difficult to prove that it had not happen in thi case if it should
be attempt murder it wa veri cleverli manag becaus nobodi could
prove that it wa not accident but could it be that thi soft
beauti babyfac woman had on the spur of the moment taken
advantag of hi load gun to wreak her jealousi and her wrong upon
her faithless lover well the face is no mirror of the qualiti of the
soul within and it wa possibl further than that it did not seem to
him to be hi busi to inquir
by thi time he had reach the castl the squir had gone out but
ida wa in and he wa shown into the drawingroom while the servant
went to seek her present he heard her dress rustl upon the stair
and the sound of it sent the blood to hi heart for where is the
music that is more sweet than the rustl of the dress of the woman
whom we love
why what is the matter she said notic the disturb express
on hi face
well he said there ha been an accidenta veri bad accid
who she said not my father
no no mr cossei
oh she said with a sigh of relief why did you frighten me so
the colonel smile grimli at thi unconsci exhibit of the
rel state of her affect
what ha happen to him ask ida thi time with a suitabl
express of concern
he ha been accident shot
who by
mr quest
then she did it on purposei meani he dead
no but i believ that he will die
thei look at on anoth and each read in the ey of the other the
thought which pass through their brain if edward cossei di thei
would be free to marri so clearli did thei read it that ida actual
interpret it in word
you must not think that she said it is veri wrong
it is wrong answer the colonel appar in no wai surpris at
her interpret of hi thought but unfortun human natur is
human natur
then he went on to tell her all about it ida made no comment that is
after those first word she did it on purpos which burst from her
in astonish she felt and he felt too that the question as to
how that gun went off wa on which wa best left uninquir into by
them no doubt if the man di there would be an inquest and the
whole matter would be investig meanwhil on thing wa certain
edward cossei whom she wa engag to wa shot and like to die
present while thei were still talk the squir came in from hi
walk to him also the stori wa told and to judg from the express
of hi face he thought it grave enough if edward cossei di the
mortgag over the honham properti would as he believ pass to hi
heir who unless he had made a will which wa not probabl would be
hi father old mr cossei the banker from whom mr de la moll well
knew he had littl merci to expect thi wa seriou enough and still
more seriou wa it that all the bright prospect in which he had for
some dai been bask of the reestablish of hi famili upon a
secur basi than it had occupi for gener would vanish like a
vision he wa not more worldlymind than ar other men but he did
fondli cherish a natur desir to see the famili fortun onc more
in the ascend the project marriag between hi daughter and
edward cossei would have brought thi about most fulli and howev
much he might in hi secret heart distrust the man himself and doubt
whether the match wa realli accept to ida he could not view it
collaps with indiffer while thei were still talk the
dressingbel rang and harold rose to go
stop and dine wont you quaritch said the squir
harold hesit and look at ida she made no movement but her ey
said stai and he sigh and yield dinner wa rather a melancholi
feast for the squir wa preoccupi with hi own thought and ida
had not much to sai so far as the colonel wa concern the
recollect of the tragedi he had wit that afternoon and of
all the dread detail with which it wa accompani wa not
conduc to appetit
as soon as dinner wa over the squir announc that he should walk
into boisingham to inquir how the wound man wa get on shortli
afterward he start leav hi daughter and harold alon
thei went into the drawingroom and talk about indiffer thing
no word of love pass between them no word even that could bear an
affection signific and yet everi sentenc which pass their
lip carri a messag with it and wa as heavi with unutt
tender as a laden bee with honei for thei love each other
dearli and deep love is a thing that can hardli be conceal by
lover from each other
it wa happi for him mere to sit besid her and hear her speak
to watch the chang of her face and the lamplight plai upon her
hair and it wa happi for her to know that he wa sit there
and watch for the most beauti aspect of true affect is it
accompani sens of perfect companionship and rest it is a sens
which noth els in thi life can give and like a lift cloud
reveal the white and distant peak of that unbroken peac which we
cannot hope to win in our stormi journei through the world
and so the even wore awai till at last thei heard the squir loud

number of shot from the wound man and a number more he left in

w quest
jame de la moll esq jp dl
i see now said ida mr cossei ha no further hold on the
mortgag or on the properti
that it said the squir he ha transfer them to that
rascal lawyer and yet he told mei cant understand it i realli
cant
at thi point the colonel insist upon leav sai he would call
in again that even to see if he could be of ani assist when he
wa gone ida spoke in a cold determin voic
mr cossei told me that when we marri he would put those mortgag
in the fire it now seem that the mortgag were not hi to dispos
of or els that he ha sinc transfer them to mr quest without
inform us
ye i suppos so said the squir
veri well said ida and now father i will tell you someth i
engag myselfor to be more accur i promis to engag myself
to edward cossei on the condit that he would take up these
mortgag when cossei and son were threaten to foreclos or
whatev it is call
good heaven said her astonish father what an idea
i did it went on ida and he took up the mortgag and in due
cours he claim my promis and i becam engag to marri him
though that engag wa repugn to me you will see that have
persuad him to advanc the monei i could not refus to carri out my
share of the bargain
well said the squir thi is all new to me
ye she answer and i should never have told you of it had it
not been for thi sudden chang in the posit of affair what i
did i did to save our famili from ruin but now it seem that mr
cossei ha plai us fals and that we ar to be ruin after all
therefor the condit upon which i promis to marri him ha not
been carri out and my promis fall to the ground
you mean that suppos he live you will not marri edward cossei
ye i do mean it
the squir thought for a minut thi is a veri seriou step ida
he said i dont mean that i think that the man ha behav wellbut
still he mai have given up the mortgag to quest under pressur of
some sort and might be will to find the monei to meet them
i do not care if he find the monei ten time over said ida i
will not marri him he ha not kept to the letter of hi bond and i
will not keep to mine
it is all veri well ida said the squir and of cours nobodi can
forc you into a distast marriag but i wish to point out on
thing you have your famili to think of as well as yourself i tell
you frankli that i do not believ that as time ar it will be
possibl to rais thirti thousand pound to pai off the charg unless
it is by the help of edward cossei so if he livesand as he ha
last so long i expect that he will liveand you refus to go on
with your engag to him we shall be sold up that is all for thi
man quest confound him will show us no merci
i know it father answer ida but i cannot and will not marri
him and i do not think you can expect me to do so i becam engag
or rather promis to becom engag to him becaus i thought that
on woman had no right to put her own happi befor the welfar of
an old famili like our and i would have carri out that engag
at ani cost but sinc then to tell you the truth and she blush
deepli not onli have i learn to dislik him a great deal more but
i have come to care for some on els who also care for me and who
therefor ha a right to be consid think father what it mean
to a woman to sell herself into bodili and mental bondagewhen she
care for anoth man
well well said her father with some irrit i am no author
upon matter of sentiment thei ar not in my line and i know that
women have their prejudic still you cant expect me to look at the
matter in quit the same light as you do and who is the gentleman
colonel quaritch
she nod her head
oh said the squir i have noth to sai against quaritch inde
i like the man but i suppos that if he ha 600 pound a year it is
everi sixpenc he can count on
i had rather marri him upon six hundr a year than edward cossei
upon sixti thousand
ah ye i have heard young women talk like that befor though
perhap thei think differ afterward of cours i have no right
to obtrud myself but when you ar comfort marri what is go
to becom of honham i should like to know and incident of me
i dont know father dear she answer her ey fill with
tear we must trust to provid i suppos i know you think me
veri selfish she went on catch him by the arm but oh father
there ar thing that ar wors than death to women or at least to
some women i almost think that i would rather die than marri edward
cossei though i should have gone through with it if he had kept hi
word
no no said her father i cant wonder at it and certainli i do
not ask you to marri a man whom you dislik but still it is hard upon
me to have all thi troubl at my ag and the old place come to the
hammer too it is enough to make a man wish that hi worri were over
altogeth howev we must take thing as we find them and we find
them pretti rough quaritch said he wa come back thi even
didnt he i suppos there will not be ani public engag at
present will there and look here ida i dont want him to come
talk to me about it i have got enough thing of my own to think of
without bother my head with your love affair prai let the matter
be for the present and now i am go out to see that fellow georg
who hasnt been here sinc he came back from london and a nice bit of
new it will be that i shall have to tell him
when her father had gone ida did a thing she had not done for some
timesh wept a littl all her fine intent of selfdeni had
broken down and she felt humili at the fact she had intend to
sacrific herself upon the altar of her duti and to make herself the
wed wife of a man whom she dislik and now on the first
opportun she had thrown up the contract on a quibblea point of
law as it were natur had been too strong for her as it often is for
peopl with deep feel she could not do it no not to save honham
from the hammer when she had promis that she would engag herself
to edward cossei she had not been in love with colonel quaritch now
she wa and the differ between the two state is consider
still the fall humili her pride and what is more she felt that
her father wa disappoint in her of cours she could not expect him
at hi ag to enter into her privat feel for when look at
through the mist of year sentiment appear more or less foolish she
knew veri well that ag often strip men of those finer sympathi and
sensibl which cloth them in youth much as the winter frost and
wind strip the delic foliag from the tree and to such the music
of the world is dead love ha vanish with the summer dew and in
it place ar cut blast and snow and sere memori rustl like
fallen leav about the feet as we grow old we ar too apt to grow
awai from beauti and what is high and pure our heart harden by
contact with the hard world we examin love and find or believ we
find that it is nought but a varieti of passion friendship and
think it selfinterest religion and name it superstit the fact
of life alon remain clear and desir we know that monei mean
power and we turn our face to mammon and if he smile upon us we ar
content to let our finer vision go where our youth ha gone
trail cloud of glori do we come
from god who is our home
so sai the poet but ala the cloud soon melt into the grei air of
the world and some of us befor our cours is finish forget that
thei ever were and yet which is the shadow of the truththos
dream and hope and aspir of our younger life or the
corrupt with which the world cake our soul
ida knew that she could not expect her father to sympathis with her
she knew that to hi judgment circumst be the same and both
suitor be equal sound in wind and limb the choic of on of
them should to a larg extent be a matter to be decid by the
exterior consider of wealth and gener conveni
howev she had made her choic made it suddenli but none the less
had made it it lai between her father interest and the interest of
the famili at larg and her own honour as a womanfor the mere empti
ceremoni of marriag which satisfi societi cannot make dishonour an
honour thing she had made her choic and the reader of her
histori must judg if that choic wa right or wrong
after dinner harold came again as he had promis the squir wa not
in the drawingroom when he wa shown in
ida rose to greet him with a sweet and happi smile upon her face for
in the presenc of her lover all her doubt and troubl vanish like
a mist
i have a piec of new for you said he try to look as though he
wa rejoic to give it edward cossei ha taken a wonder turn for
the better thei sai that he will certainli recov
oh she answer colour a littl and now i have a piec of
new for you colonel quaritch my engag with mr edward cossei
is at an end i shall not marri him
ar you sure said harold with a gasp
quit sure i have made up my mind and she held out her hand as
though to seal her word
he took it and kiss it thank heaven ida he said
ye she answer thank heaven and at that moment the squir
came in look veri miser and depress and of cours noth
more wa said about the matter

he wa as bent upon thi marriag as he had ever been more so in
fact now that hi father wa out of the wai he knew that ida
dislik him he had known that all along but he had trust to time
and marriag to overcom the dislik and now that accurs quest had
brought about the ruin of hi hope ida had seen her chanc of
escap and like a bold woman had seiz upon it there wa on rai
of hope and on onli he knew that the monei would not be forthcom
to pai off the mortgag he could see too from the tone of the
squir letter that he did not altogeth approv of hi daughter
decis and hi father wa dead like caesar he wa the master of
mani legion or rather of much monei which is as good as legion
monei can make most path smooth to the feet of the travel and why
not thi after much thought he came to a conclus he would not
trust hi chanc to paper he would plead hi caus in person so he
wrote a short note to the squir acknowledg ida and hi letter

so shaken wa he howev that though he tri onc and yet again he
found it imposs to settl himself down to work till he had taken a
coupl of glass of sherri from the decant in the cupboard even as
he did so he wonder if the shadow of the sword disturb him so
much how he would be affect if it ever wa hi lot to face the
glimmer of it nake blade
no further letter came to edward cossei from the castl but
impati as he wa to do so anoth fortnight elaps befor he wa
abl to see ida and her father at last on fine decemb morn for
the first time sinc hi accid he wa allow to take carriag

who wa pass along the passag to tell him
of cours she recognis her admir instantli and wish to leav

stone deaf in my right ear
a pang of piti shot through her heart edward cossei feebl
deject and limp from the jaw of death wa a veri differ

strength inde so much did hi condit appeal to her sympathi
that for the first time sinc her mental attitud toward him had been
on of entir indiffer she look on him without repugn
meanwhil her father had shaken him by the hand and led him to an
armchair befor the fire
then after a few question and answer as to hi accid and merci
recoveri there came a paus
at length he broke it i have come to see you both he said with a
faint nervou smile about the letter you wrote me if my condit
had allow i should have come befor but it would not
ye said the squir attent while ida fold her hand in her
lap and sat still with her ey fix upon the fire
it seem he went on that the old proverb ha appli to my case
as to so mani othersb absent i have suffer i understand from
these letter that my engag to you miss de la moll is broken
off
she made a motion of assent
and that it is broken off on the ground that have been forc by a
combin of circumst which i cannot enter into to transfer the
mortgag to mr quest consequ i broke my bargain with you
ye said ida
veri well then i come to tell you both that i am readi to find the
monei to meet those mortgag and to pai them off in full
ah said the squir

at the squir
it is no us look to me for an answer said he with some
irrit i have no voic in the matter
he turn to ida who put her hand befor her face and shook her head
perhap said edward somewhat bitterli i should not be far wrong
if i said that colonel quaritch ha more to do with your chang of
mind than the fact of the transfer of these mortgag
she drop her hand and look him full in the face
you ar quit right mr cossei she said boldli colonel quaritch
and i ar attach to each other and we hope on dai to be marri
confound that quaritch growl the squir beneath hi breath
edward winc visibl at thi outspoken statement
ida he said i make on last appeal to you i am devot to you

will make your famili what it wa centuri ago the greatest in the
countri side i dont pretend to have been a saintperhap you mai
have heard someth against me in that wayor to be anyth out of
the common i am onli an ordinari everydai man but i am devot to

i have thought mr cossei answer ida almost passion i
have thought until i am tire of think and i do not consid it
fair that you should press me like thi especi befor my father

if thei should take a turn i shall have your support
my dear sir answer the squir i tell you frankli that i wish my

reason be desir but ida is not like ordinari women when she
set her mind upon a thing she set it like a flint time mai chang
howev and that is all i can sai ye if i were you i should
rememb that thi is a changeabl world and women ar the most
changeabl thing in it
when the carriag wa gone he reenter the vestibul ida who wa
go awai much disturb in mind saw him come and knew from the
express of hi face that there would be troubl with
characterist courag she turn determin to brave it out
chapter xxxiii
the squir speak hi mind
for a minut or more her father fidget about move hi paper
backward and forward but sai noth
at last he spoke you have taken a most seriou and pain step
ida he said of cours you have a right to do as you pleas you
ar of full ag and i cannot expect that you will consid me or your
famili in your matrimoni engag but at the same time i think
it is my duti to point out to you what it is that you ar do you
ar refus on of the finest match in england in order to marri a
brokendown middleag halfpai colonel a man who can hardli
support you whose part in life is plai or who is appar too
idl to seek anoth
here ida ey flash omin but she made no comment be
appar afraid to trust herself to speak
you ar do thi went on her father work himself up as he
spoke in the face of my wish and with a knowledg that your
action will bring your famili to sai noth of your father to utter
and irretriev ruin
sure father sure broke in ida almost in a cry you would
not have me marri on man when i love anoth when i made the promis
i had not becom attach to colonel quaritch
love pshaw said her father dont talk to me in that sentiment
and schoolgirl wayyou ar too old for it i am a plain man and i
believ in famili affect and in duti ida love as you call
it is onli too often anoth word for selfwil and selfish and
other thing that we ar better without
i can understand father answer ida struggl to keep her
temper under thi jobat that my refus to marri mr cossei is
disagre to you for obviou reason though it is not so veri long
sinc you detest him yourself but i do not see why an honest
woman affect for anoth man should be talk of as though there
wa someth shame about it it is all veri well to sneer at
love but after all a woman is flesh and blood she is not a
chattel or a slave girl and marriag is not like anyth elseit
mean mani thing to a woman there is no magic about marriag to make
that which is unright righteou
there said her father it is no good your lectur to me on
marriag ida if you do not want to marri cossei i cant forc you
to if you want to ruin me your famili and yourself you must do so
but there is on thing while it is over me which i suppos will not
be for much longer my hous is my own and i will not have that
colonel of your hang about it and i shall write to him to sai so
you ar your own mistress and if you choos to walk over to church
and marri him you can do so but it will be done without my consent
which of cours howev is an unnecessari formal do you hear me
ida
if you have quit done father she answer coldli i should like
to go befor i sai someth which i might be sorri for of cours you
can write what you like to colonel quaritch and i shall write to him
too
her father made no answer beyond sit down at hi tabl and
grab vicious at a pen so she left the room indign inde
but with as heavi a heart as ani woman could carri in her breast
dear sir wrote the not unnatur indign squir i have
been inform by my daughter ida of her entangl with you it
is on which for reason that i need not enter into is
distast to me as well as i am sorri to sai ruinou to ida
herself and to her famili ida is of full ag and must of
cours do as she pleas with herself but i cannot consent to
becom a parti to what i disapprov of so strongli and thi be
the case i must beg you to ceas your visit to my hous
i am sir your obedi servant
jame de la moll
colonel quaritch vc
ida as soon as she had suffici recov herself also wrote to
the colonel she told him the whole stori keep noth back and
end her letter thu
never dear harold wa a woman in a greater difficulti and never
have i more need help and advic you know and have good reason to
know how hate thi marriag would be to me love you as i do
entir and alon and have no higher desir than to becom your
wife but of cours i see the pain of the posit i am not so
selfish as my father believ or sai that he believ i quit
understand how great would be the materi advantag to my father if i
could bring myself to marri mr cossei you mai rememb i told you
onc that i thought no woman ha a right to prefer her own happi
to the prosper of her whole famili but harold it is easi to
speak thu and veri veri hard to act up to it what am i to do what
am i to do and yet how can i in common fair ask you to answer
that question god help us both harold is there no wai out of it
these letter were both duli receiv by harold quaritch on the
follow morn and threw him into a fever of anxieti and doubt he
wa a just and reason man and know someth of human natur
under the circumst did not altogeth wonder at the squir
violenc and irrit the financi posit of the de la moll
famili wa littl if anyth short of desper he could easili
understand how madden it must be to a man like mr de la moll who
love honham which had for centuri been the home of hi race
better than he love anyth on earth to suddenli realis that it
must pass awai from him and hi for ever mere becaus a woman
happen to prefer on man to anoth and that man to hi view the
less elig of the two so keenli did he realis thi inde that
he greatli doubt whether or no he wa justifi in continu hi
advanc to ida final after much thought he wrote to the squir
as follow
i have receiv your letter and also on from ida and i hope you
will believ me when i sai that i quit understand and sympathis with
the motiv which evid led you to write it i am unfortun
although i never regret it till nowa poor man wherea my rival

world is full of thing that ar not right i can give you no advic
for i do not know what advic i ought to give i try to put myself out
of the question and to consid you and you onli but even then i
fear that my judgment is not imparti at ani rate the less we see

other hand we ar doom to a lifelong separ the sooner we begin

thi letter did not tend to rais ida spirit evid her lover
saw that there wa anoth side to the questionth side of duti and
wa too honest to hide it from her she had said that she would have
noth to do with edward cossei but she wa well awar that the
matter wa still an open on what should she do what ought she to
do abandon her love desecr herself and save her father and her
hous or cling to her love and leav the rest to chanc it wa a
cruel posit nor did the laps of time tend to make it less cruel
her father went about the place pale and melancholyal hi jovial
manner had vanish beneath the pressur of impend ruin he treat
her with studiou and oldfashion courtesi but she could see that
he wa bitterli aggriev by her conduct and that the anxieti of hi
posit wa tell on hi health if thi wa the case now what
she wonder would happen in the spring when step were actual
taken to sell the place
on bright cold morn she wa walk with her father through the
field down on the footpath that led to the church and it would have
been hard to sai which of the two look the paler or the more
miser on the previou dai the squir had seen mr quest and made
as much of an appeal ad misericordiam to him as hi pride would
allow onli to find the lawyer veri courteou veri regret but
hard as adam also that veri morn a letter had reach him from
london announc that the last hope of rais monei to meet the
mortgag had fail
the path ran along toward the road past a line of oak halfwai down
thi line thei came across georg who with hi mark instrument in
hi hand wa contempl some of the tree which it wa propos to
take down
what ar you do there said the squir in a melancholi voic
mark squir
then you mai as well save yourself the troubl for the place will
belong to somebodi els befor the sap is up in those oak
now squir dont you begin to talk like that for i dont believ
it that aint ago to happen
aint ago to happen you stupid fellow aint ago to happen
answer the squir with a dreari laugh why look there and he
point to a dogcart which had drawn up on the road in such a
posit that thei could see it without it occup see them
thei ar take note alreadi
georg look and so did ida mr quest wa the driver of the dog
cart which he had pull up in such a posit as to command a view
of the castl and hi companionin whom georg recognis a well
known london auction who sometim did busi in these partswa
stand up an open notebook in hi hand altern look at the
nobl tower of the gatewai and jot down memoranda
damn em and so thei be said georg utterli forget hi
manner
ida look up and saw her father ey fix firmli upon her with an
express that seem to sai see you wil woman see the ruin
that you have brought upon us
she turn awai she could not bear it and that veri night she came
to a determin which in due cours wa commun to harold
and him alon that determin wa to let thing be for the
present upon the chanc of someth happen by mean of which the
dilemma might be solv but if noth happenedand inde it did
not seem probabl to her that anyth would happenthen she would
sacrific herself at the last moment she believ inde she knew
that she could alwai call edward cossei back to her if she like it
wa a compromis and like all compromis had an element of weak
but it gave time and time to her wa like breath to the dy
sir said georg present it boisingham quarter session the
dai after tomorrow aint it mr de la moll wa chairman of

dogcart had driven

paper and numberless theori had been built upon them but the
echo were alreadi begin to die awai both actor in the dim
event were dead and there wa no pend trial to keep the public
interest aliv
the two corps still link in that fierc dy grip had been
pick up on a mudbank an inquest had been held at which an open
verdict wa return and thei were buri other event had occur
the paper were fill with the report of new tragedi and the
affair of the countri lawyer who commit bigami and togeth with
hi law wife came to a tragic and mysteri end began to be
forgotten
in boisingham and it neighbourhood much sympathi wa shown with
bell whom peopl still call mr quest though she had no titl to
that name but she receiv it coldli and kept herself seclud
as soon as her suppos husband death wa beyond a doubt bell had
open hi safe for he had left the kei on hi dressingt and
found therein hi will and other paper includ the mortgag deed
to which as mr quest memorandum advis her she had no claim
nor inde had her right to them been good in law would she have
retain them see that thei were a price wrung from her late lover
under threat of an action that could not be brought
so she made them into a parcel and sent them to edward cossei
togeth with a formal note of explan greatli wonder in her
heart what cours he would take with refer to them she wa not
left long in doubt the receipt of the deed wa acknowledg and
three dai afterward she heard that a notic call in the borrow
monei had been serv upon mr de la moll on behalf of edward cossei
so he had evid made up hi mind not to forego thi new advantag
which chanc threw in hi wai pressur and pressur alon could
enabl him to attain hi end and he wa appli it unmercifulli
well she had done with him now it did not matter to her but she
could not help faintli wonder at the extraordinari tenac and
hard of purpos which hi action show then she turn her mind
to the consider of anoth matter in connect with which her
plan were approach matur
it wa some dai after thi exactli a fortnight from the date of mr
quest death that edward cossei wa sit on afternoon brood
over the fire in hi room he had much busi await hi
attent in london but he would not go to london he could not tear
himself awai from boisingham and such of the matter as could be
attend to there were left without attent he wa still as
determin as ever to marri ida more determin if possibl for from
constant brood on the matter he had arriv at a condit
approach monomania he had been quick to see the advantag
result to him from mr quest tragic death and the return of the
deed and though he knew that ida would hate him the more for do
it he instruct hi lawyer to call in the monei and make us of
everi possibl legal mean to harass and put pressur upon mr de la
moll at the same time he had written privat to the squir
call hi attent to the fact that matter were now onc more as
thei had been at the begin but that he wa as befor will to
carri out the arrang which he had alreadi specifi provid
that ida could be persuad to consent to marri him to thi mr de la
moll had answer courteous enough notwithstand hi grief and
irrit at the cours hi wouldb soninlaw had taken about the
mortgag on the death of mr quest and the suspicion it wa noth
more that he now had as to the origin caus of their transfer to
the lawyer he said what he had said befor that he could not forc
hi daughter into a marriag with him but that if she chose to agre
to it he should offer no object and there the matter stood onc
or twice edward had met ida walk or drive she bow to him
coldli and that wa all inde he had onli on crumb of comfort in
hi daili bread of disappoint and the hope defer which where
a ladi is concern make the heart more than normal sick and it
wa that he knew hi hate rival colonel quaritch had been forbidden
the castl and that intercours between him and ida wa practic
at an end
but he wa a dog and persev man he knew the power of monei
and the shift to which peopl can be driven who ar made desper by
the want of it he knew too that it is no rare thing for women who
ar attach to on man to sell themselv to anoth of their own
free will realis that love mai pass but wealth if the
settlement ar properli drawn doe not therefor he still hope
that with so mani circumst bring an everincreas pressur
upon her ida spirit would in time be broken her resist would
collaps and he would have hi will nor as the sequel will show
wa that hope a baseless on
as for hi infatu there wa liter no limit to it it broke
out in all sort of wai and for mile round wa a matter of public
notorieti and gossip over the mantelpiec in hi sittingroom wa a
fresh exampl of it by on mean and anoth he had obtain sever
photograph of ida notabl on of her in a court dress which she had
worn two or three year befor when her brother jame had insist
upon her be present these photograph he caus to be enlarg
and then at the cost of 500 pound commiss a wellknown artist
to paint from them a fulllength lifes portrait of ida in her
court dress thi order had been execut and the portrait which
although the colour wa not entir satisfactori wa still an
effect like and a fine piec of work now hung in a splendid
frame over hi mantelpiec
there on the afternoon in question he sat befor the fire hi ey
fix upon the portrait of which the outlin wa begin to grow
dim in the wane decemb light when the servant girl came in and
announc that a ladi wish to speak to him he ask what her name
wa and the girl said that she did not know becaus she had her veil
down and wa wrap up in a big cloak
in due cours the ladi wa shown up he had relaps into hi reveri
for noth seem to interest him much now unless it had to do with
idaand he knew that the ladi could not be ida becaus the girl said
that she wa short as it happen he sat with hi right ear in
which he wa deaf toward the door so that between hi infirm and
hi dream he never heard bellefor it wa sheenter the room
for a minut or more she stood look at him as he sat with hi ey
fix upon the pictur and while she look an express of piti
stole across her sweet pale face
i wonder what curs there is laid upon us that we should be alwai
doom to seek what we cannot find she said aloud
he heard her now and look up saw her stand in the glow and
flicker of the firelight which plai upon her white face and black
drape form he start violent as he did so she loos the heavi
cloak and hood that she wore and it fell behind her but where wa the
love round form and where the cluster golden curl gone and
in their place a coars robe of blue serg on which hung a crucifix
and the white hood of the nun
he sprang from hi chair with an exclam not know if he
dream or if he realli saw the woman who stood there like a ghost in
the firelight

from her face the mean of it is that i have left the world and
enter a sisterhood which work among the poor in london and i have
come to bid you farewel a last farewel

idea of thi beauti human love creatur with the cold sanctuari
of a sisterhood he did not know that natur like thi whose veri
intens is often the caus of their destruct ar most capabl of
these strang develop the man or woman who can realli love and
endureand thei ar rarecan also when their passion ha utterli
broken them turn to climb the stoni path that lead to love

father she said again will you give me ten dai that is until
christma dai if noth happen between thi and then i will marri
mr edward cossei
a sudden light of hope shone in hi ey she saw it though he tri
to hide it by turn hi head awai
oh ye he answer as you wish settl it on wai or the other
on christma dai and then we can go out with the new year you see
your brother jame is dead i have no on left to advis me now and i
suppos that i am get old at ani rate thing seem to be too much
for me settl it as you like settl it as you like and he got up
leav hi breakfast half swallow and went off to moon aimlessli
about the park
so she made up her mind at last thi wa the end of her struggl
she could not let her old father be turn out of hous and home to
starv for practic thei would starv she knew her hate lover
well enough to be awar that he would show no merci it wa a question
of the woman or the monei and she wa the woman either she must let
him take her or thei must be destroi there wa no middl cours
and in these circumst there wa no room for hesit onc more
her duti becam clear to her she must give up her life she must give
up her love she must give up herself well so be it she wa weari
of the long endeavour against fortun now she would yield and let the
tide of utter miseri sweep over her like a seato bear her awai till
at last it brought her to that oblivion in which perchanc all thing
come right or ar as though thei had never been
she had scarc spoken to her lover harold quaritch for some week
she had as she understood it enter into a kind of unspoken agreement
with her father not to do so and that agreement harold had realis
and respect sinc their last letter to each other thei had met
onc or twice casual or at church interchang a few indiffer
word though their ey spoke anoth stori touch each other
hand and part that wa absolut all but now that ida had come
to thi moment decis she felt he had a right to learn it and so
onc more she wrote to him she might have gone to see him or told him
to meet her but she would not for on thing she did not dare to
trust herself on such an errand in hi dear compani for anoth she
wa too proud think if her father came to hear of it he might
consid that it had a clandestin and underhand appear
and so she wrote with all she said we need not concern ourselv the
letter wa love even passion more passion perhap than on
would have expect from a woman of ida calm and state sort but a
mountain mai have a heart of fire although it is clad in snow and so
it sometim is with women who seem cold and unemot as marbl
besid it wa her last chancesh could write him no more letter
and she had much to sai
and so i have decid harold she said after tell him of all her
doubt and troubl i must do it there is no help for it as i
think you will see i have ask for ten dai respit i realli
hardli know why except that it is a respit and now what is there
left to sai to you except goodby i love you harold i make no
secret of it and i shall never love ani other rememb all your life
that i love you and have not forgotten you and never can forget for
peopl place as we ar there is but on hopeth grave in the grave
earthli consider fail and earthli contract end and there i
trust and believ we shall find each otheror at the least
forget my heart is so sore i know not what to sai to you for
it is difficult to put all i feel in word i am overwhelm my
spirit is broken and i wish to heaven that i were dead sometim i
almost ceas to believ in a god who can allow hi creatur to be so
torment and give us love onli that it mai be daili dishonour in
our sight but who am i that i should complain and after all what ar
our troubl compar to some we know of well it will come to an end
at last and meanwhil piti me and think of me
piti me and think of me ye but never see me more as soon as thi
engag is publicli announc go awai the further the better
ye go to new zealand as you suggest onc and in piti of our
human weak never let me see your face again perhap you mai write
to me sometimesif mr cossei will allow it go there and occupi
yourself it will divert your mindyou ar still too young a man to
lai yourself upon the shelfmix yourself up with the polit of the
place take to write anyth so long as you can absorb yourself
i sent you a photograph of myself i have noth better and a ring
which i have worn night and dai sinc i wa a child i think that it
will fit your littl finger and i hope you will alwai wear it in
memori of me it wa my mother and now it is late and i am tire
and what is there more that a woman can sai to the man she lovesand
whom she must leav for ever onli on wordgoodby ida
when harold got thi letter it fairli broke him down hi hope had
been reviv when he thought that all wa lost and now again thei
were utterli dash and broken he could see no wai out of it none at
all he could not quarrel with ida decis shock as it wa for
the simpl reason that he knew in hi heart she wa act rightli and
even nobli but oh the thought of it made him mad it is probabl
that to a man of imagin and deep feel hell itself can invent
no more hideou tortur than he must undergo in the posit in which
harold quaritch found himself to truli love some good woman or some
woman whom he think goodfor it come to the same thingto love her
more than life to hold her dearer even than hi honour to be like
harold belov in turn and then to know that thi woman thi on
thing for which he would count the world well lost thi light that
make hi dai beauti ha been taken from him by the bitter of
fate not by death for that he could bear taken from him and given
for monei or monei worthto some other man it is perhap
better that a man should die than that he should pass through such an
experi as that which threaten harold quaritch now for though
the man die not yet will it kill all that is best in him and
whatev triumph mai await him whatev women mai be readi in the
futur to pin their favour to hi breast life will never be for him
what it might have been becaus hi lost love took it glori with
her
no wonder then that he despair no wonder too that there rose up
in hi breast a great anger and indign against the man who had
brought thi last extrem of miseri upon them he wa just and
could make allow for hi rival infatuationwhich inde ida
be concern it wa not difficult for him to understand but he
wa also and abov all thing a gentleman and the spectacl of a
woman be inexor driven into a distast marriag by monei
pressur put on by the man who wish to gain her revolt him
beyond measur and though he wa slow to wrath move him to fieri
indign so much did it move him that he took a resolut mr
cossei should know hi mind about the matter and that at onc
ring the bell he order hi dogcart and drove to edward
cossei room with the full intent of give that gentleman a veri
unpleas quarterofanhour
mr cossei wa in fear lest he should refus to see him the
colonel follow the servant up the stair and enter almost as she
announc hi name there wa a grim and even a formid look upon
hi plain but manli face and someth of menac too in hi formal
and soldierli bear nor did hi aspect soften when hi ey fell
upon the fulllength pictur of ida over the mantelpiec
edward cossei rose with astonish and irrit not unmix with
nervous depict on hi face the last person whom he wish to
see and expect a visit from wa colonel quaritch whom in hi heart
he held in consider aw besid he had of late receiv such a
seri of unpleas call that it is not wonder that he began to
dread these interview
gooddai he said coldli will you be seat
the colonel bow hi head slightli but he did not sit down
to what am i indebt for the pleasur began edward cossei with
much polit
last time i wa here mr cossei said the colonel in hi deep
voic speak veri deliber i came to give an explan now
i come to ask on
inde
ye to come to the point miss de la moll and i ar attach to
each other and there ha been between us an understand that thi
attach might end in marriag
oh ha there said the younger man with a sneer
ye answer the colonel keep down hi rise temper as well as
he could but now i am told upon what appear to be good author
that you have actual condescend to bring directli and indirectli
pressur of a monetari sort to bear upon miss de la moll and her
father in order to forc her into a distast marriag with
yourself
and what the devil busi of your is it sir ask cossei what
i have or have not done make everi allow for the disappoint
of an unsuccess suitor for i presum that you appear in that
charact and again he sneer i ask what busi is it of
your
it is everi busi of mine mr cossei becaus if miss de la moll
is forc into thi marriag i shall lose my wife
then you will certainli lose her do you suppos that i am go to
consid you inde he went on be now in a tower passion i
should have thought that consid the differ of ag and fortun
between us you might find other reason than you suggest to account
for my be prefer if i should be so prefer ladi ar apt to
choos the better man you know
i dont quit know what you mean by the better man mr cossei
said the colonel quietli comparison ar odiou and i will make
none though i admit that you have the advantag of me in monei and in
year howev that is not the point the point is that i have had
the fortun to be prefer to you by the ladi in question and
not you to me i happen to know that the idea of her marriag with
you is as distast to miss de la moll as it is to me thi i know
from her own lip she will onli marri you if she doe so at all
under the pressur of direst necess and to save her father from
the ruin you ar deliber bring upon him
well colonel quaritch he answer have you quit done lectur
me if you have let me tell you as you seem anxiou to know my mind
that if by ani legal mean i can marri ida de la moll i certainli
intend to marri her and let me tell you anoth thing that when onc
i am marri it will be the last that you shall see of her if i can
prevent it
thank you for your admiss said harold still more quietli so
it seem that it is all true it seem that you ar us your wealth
to harass thi unfortun gentleman and hi daughter until you drive
them into consent to thi marriag that be so i wish to tell
you privat what i shall probabl take some opportun of tell
you in public name that a man who doe these thing is a cur and
wors than a cur he is a blackguard and you ar such a man mr
cossei
edward cossei face turn perfectli livid with furi and he drew
himself up as though to spring at hi adversari throat
the colonel held up hi hand dont try that on with me he said
in the first place it is vulgar and in the second you have onli just
recov from an accid and ar no match for me though i am over
forti year old listen our father had a wai of settl their
troubl i dont approv of that sort of thing as a rule but in some
case it is salutari if you think yourself aggriev it doe not take
long to cross the water mr cossei
edward cossei look puzzl do you mean to suggest that i should
fight a duel with you he said
to challeng a man to fight a duel answer the colonel with
deliber is an indict offenc therefor i make no such
challeng i have made a suggest and if that suggest fall in
with your view as and he bow i hope it mai we might perhap
meet accident abroad in a few dai time when we could talk thi
matter over further
ill see you hang first answer cossei what have i to gain by
fight you except a veri good chanc of be shot i have had
enough of be shot as it is and we will plai thi game out upon the
old line until i win it
as you like said harold i have made a suggest to you which you
do not see fit to accept as to the end of the game it is not
finish yet and therefor it is imposs to sai who will win it
perhap you will be checkmat after all in the meanwhil allow me
again to assur you that i consid you both a cur and a blackguard
and to wish you goodmorn and he bow himself out leav
edward cossei in a curiou condit of concentr rage
chapter xxxix
the colonel goe to sleep
the state of mind is difficult to pictur which could induc a
peaceabl christiannatur individu who had moreov in the cours
of hi career been mix up with enough bloodsh to have acquir a
thorough horror of it to offer to fight a duel yet thi state had
been reach by harold quaritch
edward cossei wise enough declin to entertain the idea but the
colonel had been perfectli in earnest about it odd as it mai appear
in the latter end of thi nineteenth centuri noth would have given
him greater pleasur than to put hi life against that of hi unworthi
rival of cours it wa foolish and wrong but human natur is the
same in all ag and in the last extrem we fall back by instinct
on those method which men have from the begin adopt to save
themselv from intoler wrong and dishonour or be it admit
to bring the same upon other
but cossei utterli declin to fight as he said he had had enough of
be shot and so there wa an end of it inde in after dai the
colonel frequent look back upon thi episod in hi career with
shame not unmingl with amus reflect when he did so on the
strang potenc of that passion which can bring men to serious
entertain the idea of such extravag
well there wa noth more to be done he might it is true have
seen ida and work upon her love and natur inclin have
tri to persuad her to cut the knot by marri him offhand
perhap he would have succeed for in these affair women ar apt to
find the argument advanc by their lover weighti and well worthi of
consider but he wa not the man to adopt such a cours he did
the onli thing he could doanswer her letter by sai that what
must be must be he had learnt that on the dai subsequ to hi
interview with hi rival the squir had written to edward cossei
inform him that a decid answer would be given to him on christma
dai and that thereon all vexati proceed on the part of that
gentleman lawyer had been stai for the time he could now no
longer doubt what the answer would be there wa onli on wai out of
the troubl the wai which ida had made up her mind to adopt
so he set to work to make hi prepar for leav honham and thi
countri for good and all he wrote to land agent and put molehil
upon their book to be sold or let on leas and also to variou
influenti friend to obtain introduct to the lead men in new
zealand but these matter did not take up all hi time and the rest
of it hung heavili on hi hand he moon about the place until he
wa tire he tri to occupi himself in hi garden but it wa weari
work sow crop for strang hand to reap and so he gave it up
somehow the time wore on until at last it wa christma ev the ev
too of the fatal dai of ida decis he dine alon that night as
usual and shortli after dinner some wait came to the hous and began
to sing their cheer carol outsid the carol did not chime in at
all well with hi condit of mind and he sent five shill out to
the singer with a request that thei would go awai as he had a
headach
accordingli thei went and shortli after their departur the great
gale for which that night is still famou began to rise then he fell
to pace up and down the quaint old oakpanel parlour think
until hi brain ach the hour wa at hand the evil wa upon him and
her whom he love wa there no wai out of it no possibl wai ala
there wa but on wai and that a golden on but where wa the monei
to come from he had it not and as land stood it wa imposs to
rais it ah if onli that great treasur which old sir jame de la
moll had hid awai and di rather than reveal could be brought to
light now in the hour of hi hous sorest need but the treasur
wa veri mythic and if it had ever realli exist it wa not now to
be found he went to hi dispatch box and took from it the copi he had
made of the entri in the bibl which had been in sir jamess pocket
when he wa murder in the courtyard the whole stori wa a veri
strang on why did the brave old man wish that hi bibl should be
sent to hi son and why did he write that somewhat peculiar messag
in it
suppos ida wa right and that it contain a cypher or cryptograph
which would give a clue to the whereabout of the treasur if so it
wa obviou that it would be on of the simplest natur a man
confin by himself in a dungeon and under sentenc of immedi death
would not have been like to paus to invent anyth complic it
would inde be curiou that he should have invent anyth at all
under such circumst and when he could have so littl hope that
the riddl would be solv but on the other hand hi posit wa
desper he wa quit surround by foe there wa no chanc of hi
be abl to convei the secret in ani other wai and he might have
done so
harold place the piec of paper upon the mantelpiec and sit
down in an armchair opposit began to contempl it earnestli as
inde he had often done befor in case it exact word should not
be rememb it is repeat here it ran do not griev for me
edward my son that i am thu suddenli and wickedli done to death by
rebel murder for nought happeneth but accord to god will and
now farewel edward till we shall meet in heaven my monei have i
hid and on account thereof i die unto thi world know that not
on piec shall cromwel touch to whom god shall appoint shall all my
treasur be for nought can i commun
harold stare and stare at thi inscript he read it forward
backward crosswai and in everi other wai but absolut without
result at last weari out with miseri of mind and the pursuit of a
futil occup he drop off sound asleep in hi chair thi
happen about a quarter to eleven oclock the next thing he knew wa
that he suddenli woke up woke up complet pass as quickli from
a condit of deep sleep to on of wake as though he had never
shut hi ey he us to sai afterward that he felt as though
somebodi had come and arous him it wa not like a natur wake
inde so unaccustom wa the sensat that for a moment the idea
flash through hi brain that he had di in hi sleep and wa now
awaken to a new state of exist
thi soon pass howev evid he must have slept some time for
the lamp wa out and the fire dy he got up and hunt about in the
dark for some match which at last he found he struck a light
stand exactli opposit to the bit of paper with the copi of sir
jame de la moll dy messag on it thi messag wa neatli
copi longwai upon a halfsheet of larg write paper such as the
squir gener us it first line ran as it wa copi
do not griev for me edward my son that i am thu suddenli and
wickedli done
now as the match burnt up by some curiou chanc connect probabl
with the dark and the sudden strike of light upon hi eyebal
it came to pass that harold happen to glanc thereon wa onli
abl to read four letter of thi first line of write all the rest
seem to him but as a blue connect those four letter thei were
dead
be respect the initi of the first the sixth the eleventh
and the sixteenth word of the line given abov
the match burnt out and he began to hunt about for anoth
dead he said aloud repeat the letter almost automat
why it spell dead that is rather curiou
someth about thi accident spell awaken hi interest veri
sharplyit wa an odd coincid he lit some candl and hurriedli
examin the line the first thing which struck him wa that the four
letter which went to make up the word dead were about equidist
in the line of write could it be he hurriedli count the word in
the line there were sixteen of them that is after the first on of
the letter occur at the commenc of everi fifth word
thi wa certainli curiou trembl with nervous he took a
pencil and wrote down the initi letter of everi fifth word in the
messag thu
do not griev for me edward my son that i am thu suddenli and
d e a
wickedli done to death by rebel murder for naught happeneth
d m
but accord to god will and now farewel edward till we
a n
shall meet in heaven my monei have i hid and on account thereof
s m o
i die unto thi world know that not on piec shall cromwel
u n
touch to whom god shall appoint shall all my treasur be for

when he had done he wrote these initi in a line
deadmansmountabc
he stare at them for a littlethen he saw
great heaven he had hit upon the read of the riddl
the answer wa
dead man mount
follow by the mysteri letter abc
breathless with excit he check the letter again to see if by
ani chanc he had made an error no it wa perfectli correct
dead man mount that wa and had been for centuri the name of
the curiou tumulu or mound in hi own back garden it wa thi mount
that learn antiquarian had discuss the origin of so fierc and
which hi aunt the late mr massei had roof at the cost of two
hundr and fifti pound in order to prove that the hollow in the top
had onc been the agreeabl countri seat of an ancient british famili
could it then be but a coincid that after the first word the
initi of everi fifth word in the messag should spell out the name
of thi remark place or wa it so arrang he sat down to think
it over trembl like a frighten child obvious it wa not
accid obvious the prison of more than two centuri ago had
in hi helpless invent thi simpl cryptograph in the hope that
hi son or if not hi son some on of hi descend would discov
it and therebi becom master of the hidden wealth what place would
be more like for the old knight to have chosen to secret the gold
than on that even in those dai had the uncanni reput of be
haunt who would ever think of look for modern treasur in the
buri place of the ancient dead in those dai too molehil or
dead man mount belong to the de la moll famili who had
reacquir it on the break up of the abbei it wa onli at the
restor when the dofferleigh branch came into possess under
the will of the second and last baronet edward de la moll who di
in exil that thei fail to recov thi portion of the properti
and if thi wa so and sir jame the murder man had buri hi
treasur in the mount what did the mysteri letter abc mean
were thei perhap direct as to the line to be taken to discov
it harold could not imagin nor as a matter of fact did he or
anybodi els ever find out either then or thereaft
ida inde us afterward to laughingli declar that old sir jame
meant to indic that he consid the whole thing as plain as
abc but thi wa an explan which did not commend itself to
harold practic mind
chapter xl
but not to bed
harold glanc at the clock it wa nearli on in the morn time to
go to bed if he wa go but he did not feel inclin to go to bed
if he did with thi great discoveri on hi mind he should not sleep
there wa anoth thing it wa christma ev or rather christma
dai the dai of ida answer if ani succour wa to be given at all
it must be given at onc befor the fortress had capitul onc
let the engag be renew and even if the monei should
subsequ be forthcom the difficulti would be doubl but he
wa build hi hope upon sand and he knew it even suppos that
he held in hi hand the kei to the hide place of the longlost
treasur who knew whether it would still be there or whether rumour
had not enorm ad to it proport he wa allow hi
imagin to carri him awai
still he could not sleep and he had a mind to see if anyth could
be made of it go to the gunroom he put on a pair of shoot
boot an old coat and an ulster next he provid himself with a
dark lantern and the kei of the summerhous at the top of dead man
mount and silent unlock the back door start out into the
garden the night wa veri rough for the great gale wa now rise
fast and bitterli cold so cold that he hesit for a moment befor
make up hi mind to go on howev he did go on and in anoth two
minut wa climb the steep side of the tumulu there wa a wan
moon in the cold skyth wind whistl most drearili through the
nake bough of the great oak which groan in answer like thing in
pain harold wa not a nervou or impression man but the place
had a spectral look about it and he could not help think of the
evil reput it had born for all those ag there wa scarc a
man in honham or in boisingham either who could have been persuad
to stai half an hour by himself on dead man mount after the sun wa
well down harold had at differ time ask on or two of them what
thei saw to be afraid of and thei had answer that it wa not what
thei saw so much as what thei felt he had laugh at the time but
now he admit to himself that he wa anyth but comfort
though if he had been oblig to put hi feel into word he could
probabl not have describ them better than by sai that he had a
gener impress of somebodi be behind him
howev he wa not go to be frighten by thi nonsens so
consign all superstit to their father the devil he march on
boldli and unlock the summerhous door now though thi curiou
edific had been design for a summerhous and for that purpos
line throughout with encaust tile nobodi as a matter of fact had
ever dream of us it to sit in to begin with it roof over a
great depress some thirti feet or more in diamet for the top of
the mount wa hollow out like on of those wooden cup in which
juggler catch ball but notwithstand all the encaust tile in
the world damp will gather in a hollow like thi and the damp alon
wa an object the real fact wa howev that the spot had an
evil reput and even those who were suffici well educ to
know the folli of thi sort of thing would not willingli have gone
there for purpos of enjoy so it had suffer the gener fate
of disus place have fallen more or less out of repair and becom
a receptacl for garden tool broken cucumb frame and lumber of
variou sort
harold push the door open and enter shut it behind him it
wa if anyth more disagre in the empti silenc of the wide
place than it had been outsid for the space roof over wa
consider and the question at onc aros in hi mind what wa he
to do now that he had got there if the treasur wa there at all
probabl it wa deep down in the bowel of the great mound well as
he wa on the spot he thought that he might as well try to dig
though probabl noth would come of it in the corner were a pickax
and some spade and shovel harold got them advanc to the centr
of the space and half laugh at hi own folli set to work first
have lit anoth lantern which wa kept there he remov with the
sharp end of the pickax a larg patch of the encaust tile exactli
in the centr of the depress then have loosen the soil beneath
with the pick he took off hi ulster and fell to dig with a will
the soil prove to be veri sandi and easi to work inde from it
appear he soon came to the conclus that it wa not virgin
earth but work soil which had been thrown there
present hi spade struck against someth hard he pick it up and
held it to the lantern it prove to be an ancient spearhead and
near it were some bone though whether or no thei were human he could
not at the time determin thi wa veri interest but it wa
scarc what he want so he dug on manfulli until he found himself
chest deep in a kind of grave he had been dig for an hour now
and wa get veri tire cold as it wa the perspir pour
from him as he paus for breath he heard the church clock strike
two and veri solemnli it sound down the wild wai of the windtorn
winter night he dug on a littl more and then serious thought of
give up what he wa somewhat asham of have undertaken how wa
he to account for thi great hole to hi garden on the follow
morn then and there he made up hi mind that he would not account
for it the garden in common with the rest of the villag believ
that the place wa haunt let him set down the hole to the spook
and their spiritu activ
still he dug on at the grave for a littl longer it wa by now
becom a matter of exceed labour to throw the shovel of soil
clear of the hole then he determin to stop and with thi view
scrambl not without difficulti out of the amateur tomb onc out
hi ey fell on a stout iron crowbar which wa stand among the
other tool such an implement as is us to make hole in the earth
wherein to set hurdl and stake it occur to him that it would
not be a bad idea to drive thi crowbar into the bottom of the grave
which he had dug in order to ascertain if there wa anyth within
it reach so he onc more descend into the hole and began to work
with the iron crow drive it down with all hi strength when he had
got it almost as deep as it would go that is about two feet it
struck somethingsometh hardther wa no doubt of it he work
awai in great excit widen the hole as much as he could
ye it wa masonri or if it wa not masonri it wa someth
uncommonli like it he drew the crow out of the hole and seiz the
shovel commenc to dig again with renew vigour as he could no
longer conveni throw the earth from the hole he took a skep or
leaf basket which lai handi and place it besid him put as much
of the sandi soil as he could carri into it and then lift shot it
on the edg of the pit for threequart of an hour he labour thu
most manfulli till at last he came down on the stonework he clear
a patch of it and examin it attent by the light of the dark
lantern it appear to be rubbl work built in the form of an arch
he struck it with the iron crow and it gave back a hollow sound there
wa a caviti of some sort underneath
hi excit and curios redoubl by great effort he widen
the spot of stonework alreadi laid bare luckili the soil or rather
sand wa so friabl that there wa veri littl exert requir to
loosen it thi done he took the iron crow and insert it beneath a
loos flat stone lever it up here wa a begin and have got
rid of the larg flat stone he struck down again and again with all
hi strength drive the sharp point of the heavi crow into the
rubbl work beneath it began to give he could hear bit of it
fall into the caviti below there it went with a crash more than
a squar foot of it
he leant over the hole at hi feet devoutli hope that the ground on
which he wa stand would not give wai also and tri to look down
next second he threw hi head back cough and gasp the foul air
rush up from the caviti or chamber or whatev it wa had half
poison him then not without difficulti he climb out of the grave
and sat down on the pile of sand he had thrown up clearli he must
allow the air in the place to sweeten a littl clearli also he must
have assist if he wa to descend into the great hole he could not
undertak thi by himself
he sat upon the edg of the pit wonder who there wa that he might
trust not hi own garden to begin with he would never come near
the place at night and besid such peopl talk the squir no he
could not rous him at thi hour and also for obviou reason thei
had not met late ah he had it georg wa the man to begin with
he could be reli upon to hold hi tongu the episod of the
product of the real mr quest had taught him that georg wa a
person of no common power he could think and he could act also
harold threw on hi coat extinguish the larg stabl lantern and
pass out lock the door of the summerhous and start down the
mount at a trot the wind had risen steadili dure hi hour of work
and wa now blow a furiou gale it wa about a quarter to four in
the morn and the star shone brightli in the hard cleanblown sky
by their light and that of the wane moon he struggl on in the
teeth of the rage tempest as he pass under on of the oak he
heard a mighti crack overhead and guess what it wa ran like a
hare he wa none too soon a circular gust of more than usual
fierc had twist the top right out of the great tree and down
it came upon the turf with a rend crash sound that made hi
blood turn cold after thi escap he avoid the neighbourhood of the
groan tree
georg live in a neat littl farmhous about a quarter of a mile
awai there wa a short cut to it across the field and thi he took
breathlessli fight hi wai against the gale which roar and
howl in it splendid might as it swept across the ocean from it
birthplac in the distanc of air even the stiff hawthorn fenc
bow befor it breath and the tall poplar on the skylin bent like
a rod beneath the first rush of a salmon
excit as he wa the immens and grandeur of the sight and sound
struck upon him with a strang forc never befor had he felt so far
apart from man and so near to that dread spirit round whose feet
thousand of roll world rush on at whose word thei ar endur
and ar not
he struggl forward until at last he reach the hous it wa quit
silent but in on of the window a light wa burn no doubt it
occup found it imposs to sleep in that wild gale the next
thing to consid wa how to make himself heard to knock at the door
would be useless in that turmoil there wa onli on thing to be done
throw stone at the window he found a goodsiz pebbl and
stand underneath threw it with such goodwil that it went right
through the glass it lit as he afterward heard full upon the
sleep mr georg nose and nearli frighten that good woman

retir to put on hi boot present he appear again hi red
nightcap still on hi head for he wa afraid that the wind would blow
a hat off and carri an unlight lantern in hi hand
now colonel im readi sir if you be and thei start
the gale wa if anyth fiercer than ever inde there had been
no such wind in those part for year or rather centuri as the
condit of the timber by ten oclock that morn ampli testifi
thi here timpest must be like that as the squir tell us on in the
time of king charl as blew the top of the church tower off on a
christma night shout georg but harold made no answer and thei
fought their wai onward without speak ani more for their voic
were almost inaud onc the colonel stop and point to the
skylin of all the row of tall poplar which he had seen bend
like whip befor the wind as he came along but on remain stand
now and as he point that vanish also
reach the summer hous in safeti thei enter and the colonel
shut and lock the door behind them the frail build wa liter
rock in the furi of the storm
i hope the roof will hold shout georg but harold took no heed
he wa think of other thing thei lit the lantern of which thei
now had three and the colonel slid down into the great grave he had
so industri dug motion to georg to follow thi that worthi
did not without trepid then thei both knelt and stare down
through the hole in the masonri but the light of the lantern wa not
strong enough to enabl them to make out anyth with clear
well said georg fall back upon hi favourit express in hi
amaz as he drew hi nightcap head from the hole if that
aint a master on i niver saw a master that all
what be you ago to du now colonel hev you a ladder here
no answer harold i never thought of that but iv a good rope
ill get it
scrambl out of the hole he present return with a long coil of
stout rope it belong to some men who had been recent emploi in
cut bough off such of the oak that need attent
thei undid the rope and let the end down to see how deep the pit wa
when thei felt that the end lai upon the floor thei pull it up the
depth from the hole to the bottom of the pit appear to be about
sixteen feet or a trifl more
harold took the iron crow and have made the rope fast to it fix
the bar across the mouth of the apertur then he doubl the rope
ti some knot in it and let it fall into the pit preparatori to
climb down it
but georg wa too quick for him forget hi doubt as to the
wisdom of grope about dead man mount at night in the ardour of
hi burn curios he took the dark lantern and hold it with
hi teeth pass hi bodi through the hole in the masonri and
cautious slid down the rope
ar you all right ask harold in a voic tremul with
excit for wa not hi life fortun trembl on the turn
ye answer georg doubtfulli harold look down could see that
he wa hold the lantern abov hi head and stare at someth
veri hard
next moment a howl of terror echo up from the pit the lantern wa
drop upon the ground and the rope began to be agit with the
utmost violenc
in anoth two second georg red nightcap appear follow by a
face that wa liter livid with terror
let me up for goad sake he gasp or hell hev me by the leg
he who ask the colonel not without a thrill of superstiti
fear as he drag the pant man through the hole
but georg would give no answer until he wa out of the grave inde
had it not been for the colonel eager entreati back to some
extent by actual forc he would by thi time have been out of the
summerhous also and halfwai down the mount
what is it roar the colonel in the pit to georg who shiver
with terror wa stand on it edg
it a bless ghost that what it is colonel answer georg
keep hi ey fix upon the hole as though he momentarili expect
to see the object of hi fear emerg
nonsens said harold doubtfulli what rubbish you talk what sort
of a ghost
a white un said georg all bone like
all bone answer the colonel why it must be a skeleton
i dont sai that he aint wa the answer but if he be he nigh
on seven foot high and sit air of hissel in a stone bath
oh rubbish said the colonel how can a skeleton sit and air
himself he would tumbl to bit
i dont know but there he be and thei dont call thi here place
dead man mount for nawth
well said the colonel argument a skeleton is a perfectli
harmless thing
ye if he dead mayb sir but thi on aliv i saw him nod hi
head at me
look here georg answer harold feel that if thi went on
much longer he should lose hi nerv altogeth im not go to be
scare great heaven what a gust im go down to see for myself
veri good colonel answer georg and ill wait here till you
come up againthat is if you iver du
thrice did harold look at the hole in the masonri and thrice did he
shrink back
come he shout angrili dont be a fool get down here and hand
me the lantern
georg obei with evid trepid then harold scrambl through
the open and with mani an inward tremor for there is scarc a
man on the earth who is realli free from supernatur fear descend
hand over hand but in so do he manag to let the lantern fall and
it went out now as ani on will admit thi wa exceedingli try it
is not pleasant to be left alon in the dark and underground in the
compani of an unknown spook he had some match but what between
fear and cold it wa some time befor he could get a light down in
thi deep place the rush of the great gale reach hi ear like a
faint and melancholi sigh and he heard other tap nois too
or he thought he did nois of a creepi and unpleas natur would
the match never light the chill and deathlik damp of the place
struck to hi marrow and the cold sweat pour from hi brow ah at
last he kept hi ey steadili fix upon the lantern till he had lit
it and the flame wa burn brightli then with an effort he turn
and look round him
and thi is what he saw
there three or four pace from him in the centr of the chamber of
death sat or rather lai a figur of death it reclin in a stone
chest or coffin like a man in a hip bath which is too small for him
the boni arm hung down on either side the boni limb project
toward him the great white skull hung forward over the massiv
breast bone it move too of itself and as it move the jawbon
tap against the breast and the teeth clack gentli togeth
terror seiz him while he look and as georg had done he turn
to fly how could that thing move it head the head ought to fall
off
seiz the rope he jerk it violent in the first effort of
mount
hev he got yew colonel sung out georg abov and the sound of a
human voic brought him back to hi sens
no he answer as boldli as he could and then set hi teeth
turn and totter straight at the horror in the chest
he wa there now and hold the lantern against the thing examin
it it wa a skeleton of enorm size and the skull wa fix with
rusti wire to on of the vertebra
at thi evid of the handiwork of man hi fear almost vanish
even in that compani he could not help rememb that it is scarc
to be suppos that spiritu skeleton carri about wire with which to
tie on their skull
with a sigh of relief he held up the lantern and look round he wa
stand in a goodsiz vault or chamber built of rubbl stone some
of thi rubbl had fallen in to hi left but otherwis though the
workmanship show that it must be of extrem antiqu the stone
line wa still strong and good he look upon the floor and then
for the first time saw that the nod skeleton befor him wa not
the onli on all round lai remnant of the dead there thei were
stretch out in the form of a circl of which the stone kist wa the
centr on place in the circl wa vacant evid it had onc
been occupi by the giant frame which now sat within the kist next
he look at the kist itself it had all the appear of on of
those rude stone chest in which the veri ancient inhabit of thi
island buri the ash of their cremat dead but if thi wa so
whenc came the uncrem skeleton
at bungai in suffolk there stood a mound or tumulu on which
wa a windmil some year ago the windmil wa pull down and
the owner of the ground wish to build a hous upon it site
set to work to cart awai the mound hi astonish mai be
conceiv when he found in the earth a great number of skeleton
arrang in circl these skeleton were of larg size and a
gentleman who saw them inform me that he measur on it wa
that of a man who must have been nearli seven feet high the bone
were unhappili cart awai and thrown into a dyke but no hous
ha been built upon the restingplac of those unknown warrior
author
perhap a subsequ race or tribe had found the chamber readi
prepar and us it to buri some among them who had fallen in
battl it wa imposs to sai more especi as with on
except there wa noth buri with the skeleton which would
assist to identifi their race or ag that except wa a dog a dog
had been place by on of the bodi evid from the posit of
the bone of it master arm he had been left to hi last sleep with
hi hand rest on the hound head
bend down harold examin the seat skeleton more close it
wa he discov accur joint togeth with strong wire
clearli thi wa the work of hand which were born into the world long
after the flesh on those mighti bone had crumbl into dust
but where wa the treasur he saw none hi heart sank as the idea
struck him that he had made an interest archaeolog discoveri
and that wa all befor undertak a closer search he went under the
hole and halloa to georg to come down as there wa noth but some
bone to frighten him
thi the worthi georg wa at length with much difficulti persuad to
do
when at last he stood besid him in the vault harold explain to him
what the place wa and how ridicul were hi fear without howev
succeed in allai them to ani consider extent
and realli when on consid the posit it is not wonder that
georg wa scare for thei were shut up in the bowel of a place
which had for centuri own the reput of be haunt face
by a nod skeleton of almost superhuman size and surround by
variou other skeleton all veri fine and larg while the most
violent tempest that had visit the countri for year sigh awai
outsid
well he said hi teeth chatter if thi aint the masterest
on that iver i did see but here he stop languag wa not equal
to the express of hi feel
meanwhil harold with a heart full of anxieti wa turn the
lantern thi wai and that in the hope of discov some trace of
sir jamess treasur but naught could he see there to the left the
masonri had fallen in he went to it and pull asid some of the
stone there wa a caviti behind appar a passag lead no
doubt to the secret entranc to the vault but he could see noth in
it onc more he search there wa noth unless the treasur wa
buri somewher or hidden awai in the passag it wa nonexist
and yet what wa the mean of that joint skeleton sit in the
stone bath it must have been put there for some purpos probabl to
frighten wouldb plunder awai could he be sit on the monei
he rush to the chest and look through the boni leg no hi
pelvi rest on the stone bottom of the kist
well georg it seem were done said harold with a ghastli
attempt at a laugh there no treasur here
mayb it underneath that there stone corn bin suggest georg
whose teeth were still chatter it should be here or hereabout
sure
thi wa an idea help himself to the shoulderblad of some
deceas hero harold us it as a trowel began to scoop awai the
soft sand upon which the stone chest stood he scoop and scoop
manfulli but he could not come to the bottom of the kist
he step back and look at it it must be on of two thingseith
the hollow at the top wa but a shallow cut in a great block of
stone or the kist had a fals bottom
he sprang at it seiz the giant skeleton by the spine he jerk it
out of the kist and drop it on on side in a bristl boni heap
just as he did so there came so furiou a gust of wind that buri as
thei were in the earth thei liter felt the mound rock beneath it
instantli it wa follow by a fright crash overhead
georg collaps in terror and for a moment harold could not for the
life of him think what had happen he ran to the hole and look up
straight abov him he could see the sky in which the first cold
light of dawn were quiver mr massei summerhous had been
blown bodili awai and the ancient british dwell place wa onc
more open to the sky as it had been for centuri
the summerhous ha gone georg he said thank good that we
were not in it or we should have gone too
oh lord sir groan the unhappi georg thi is an aw
busi it like a judgment
it might have been if we had been up abov instead of safe down
here he answer come bring that other lantern
georg rous himself and togeth thei bent over the now empti kist
examin it close
the stone bottom wa not of quit the same colour as the wall of the
chest and there wa a crack across it harold felt in hi pocket and
drew out hi knife which had at the back of it on of those strong
iron hook that ar us to extract stone from the hoof of hors
thi hook he work into the crack and manag befor it broke to pull
up a fragment of stone then look round he found a long sharp
flint among the rubbish where the wall had fallen in thi he insert
in the hole and thei both lever awai at it
half of the crack stone came up a few inch far enough to allow
them to get their finger underneath it so it wa a fals bottom
catch hold gasp the colonel and pull for your life
georg did as he wa bid and set their knee against the hollow
stone thei tug till their muscl crack
it amov said georg now thin colonel
next second thei both found themselv on the flat of their back the
stone had given with a run
up sprang harold like a kitten the broken stone wa stand edgewai
in the kist there wa someth soft beneath it
the light georg he said hoars
beneath the stone were some layer of rotten linen
wa it a shroud or what
thei pull the linen out by hand on two three
oh great heaven
there under the linen were row on row of shine gold coin set
edgewai
for a moment everyth swam befor harold ey and hi heart
stop beat as for georg he mutter someth inaud about
it be a master on and collaps
with trembl finger harold manag to pick out two piec of gold
which had been disturb by the upheav of the stone and held them
to the light he wa a skill numismatist and had no difficulti in
recognis them on wa a beauti threepound piec of charl i
and the other a spur rial of jame i
that prove it there wa no doubt that thi wa the treasur hidden
by sir jame de la moll he it must have been also who had conceiv
the idea of put a fals bottom to the kist and set up the
skeleton to frighten maraud from the treasur if by ani chanc
thei should enter
for a minut or two the men stood stare at each other over the great
treasur which thei had unearth in that dread place shake with
the reaction of their first excit and scarc abl to speak
how deep du it go said georg at length
harold took hi knife and loos some of the top coin which were
veri tightli pack till he could move hi hand in them freeli then
he pull out hand after hand of everi sort of gold coin there
were rose nobl of edward iv sovereign and angel of henri vii
and viii sovereign halfsovereign and gold crown of edward vi

crown of elizabeth thirtyshil piec spur rial angel
unit and laurel of jame i threepound piec broad and half
broad of charl i some in greater quantiti and some in less all
were repres hand after hand did he pull out and yet the
bottom wa not reach at last he came to it the layer of gold
piec wa about twenti inch broad by three feet six long
we must get thi into the hous georg befor ani on is about
gasp the colonel
ye sir ye for sure we must but how be we ago to carri it
harold thought for a minut and then act thu bid georg stai
in the vault with the treasur which he wa with difficulti persuad
to do he climb the improvis rope ladder and got in safeti
through the hole in hi excit he had forgotten about the summer
hous have been carri awai by the gale which wa still blow
though not with so much furi as befor the windswept desol that
met hi view as he emerg into the dawn light broke upon him with
a shock the summerhous wa clean gone noth but a few upright
remain of it and fifti yard awai he thought he could make out the
crumpl shape of the roof nor wa that all quit a quarter of the
great oak which were the glori of the place were down or splinter

chapter xlii
ida goe to meet her fate
most peopl of a certain ag and a certain degre of sensit in
look back down the vista of their live whereon memori
melancholi light plai in fit flash like the altern glow of a
censer swung in the twilight of a tomb can recal some on night of
peculiar mental agoni it mai have come when first we found ourselv
face to face with the chill and hopeless horror of depart life
when in our soul despair we stretch out vain hand and wept
call and no answer came when we kiss those belov lip and
shrunk aghast at contact with their clai those lip more eloqu now
in the rich pomp of their unutter silenc than in the brightest
hour of their unseal it mai have come when our honour and the hope
of all our dai lai at our feet shatter like a sherd on the world
hard road it mai have come when she the star of our youth the type
of complet beauti and woman most perfect measur she who held the
chalic of our hope ruthlessli empti and crush it and as becam
a star pass down our horizon wai to rise upon some other sky it
mai have come when brutu stab us or when a child whom we had
cherish struck us with a serpentfang of treacheri and left the
poison to creep upon our heart on wai or anoth it ha been with
most of us that long night of utter woe and all will own that it is
a ghastli thing to face
and so ida de la moll had found it the shriek of the great gale
rush on that christma ev round the stout norman tower wa not
more strong than the breath of the despair which shook her life she
could not sleepwho could sleep on such a night the herald of such a
morrow the wail and roar of the wind the crash of fall tree and
the rattl of fly stone seem to form a fit accompani to the
turmoil of her mind
she rose went to the window and in the dim light watch the tree
gigant toss in struggl for their life an oak and a birch
were within her view the oak stood the storm outfor a while
present there came an aw gust and beat upon it it would not
bend and the tough root would not give so beneath the weight of the
gale the big tree broke in two like a straw and it spread top wa
whirl into the moat but the birch gave and bent it bent till it
delic filament lai upon the wind like a woman stream hair
and the fierc of the blast wore itself awai and spare it
see what happen to those who stand up and defi their fate said ida
to herself with a bitter laugh the birch ha the best of it
ida turn and close the shutter the sight of the tempest affect
her strain nerv almost beyond bear she began to walk up and
down the big room flit like a ghost from end to end and back
again and again back what could she do what should she do her fate
wa upon her she could no longer resist the inevitablesh must
marri him and yet her whole soul revolt from the act with an
overwhelm fierc which astonish even herself she had known
two girl who had marri peopl whom thei did not like be at the
time or pretend to be attach to somebodi els and she had
observ that thei accommod themselv to their fate with
consider eas but it wa not so with her she wa fashion of
anoth clai and it made her faint to think of what wa befor her
and yet the prospect wa on on which she could expect littl
sympathi her own father although person he dislik the man whom
she must marri wa clearli fill with amaz that she should
prefer colonel quaritch middleag poor and plain to edward
cosseyhandsom young and rich as croesu he could not comprehend
or measur the extraordinari gulf which her love dug between the two
if therefor thi wa so with her own father how would it be with
the rest of the world
she pace her bedroom till she wa tire then in an access of
despair which wa suffici distress in a person of her
reserv and state manner flung herself weep and sob upon
her knee and rest her ach head upon the bed prai as she had
never prai befor that thi cup might pass from her
she did not knowhow should shethat at thi veri moment her prayer
wa be answer and that her lover wa then even as she prai
lift the broken stone and reveal the hoard of ruddi gold but so
it wa she prai in despair and agoni of mind and the prayer
carri on the wild wing of the night brought a fulfil with it
not in vain were her tear and supplic for even now the
deliver delv among
the dust and aw treasur of the dead
and even now the light of her happi wa break on her tortur
night as the cold gleam of the christma morn were break over
the furi of the storm without
and then chill and numb in bodi and mind she crept into her bed
again and at last lost herself in sleep
by halfpast nine oclock when ida came down to breakfast the gale
had utterli gone though it footprint were visibl enough in

she stop dead and stare at the glass door as though she saw a
ghost both her father and edward cossei follow the motion of her
ey and thi wa what thei saw up the step came colonel quaritch
and georg both were pale and wearylook but the former wa at
least clean as for georg thi could not be said hi head wa still

wonder as it mai seem it ha been my fortun to discov the

there wa a gener gasp of astonish
what exclaim the squir why i thought that the whole thing
wa a myth
no that it aint sir said georg with a melancholi smile co
iv seen it
ida had sunk into a chair
what is the amount she ask in a low eager voic
i have been unabl to calcul exactli but speak roughli it
cannot be under fifti thousand pound estim on the valu of the
gold alon here is a specimen of it and harold pull out a hand
of rial and other coin and pour them on to the tabl
ida hid her face in her hand and edward cossei realis what thi
most unexpect develop of event might mean for him began to
trembl
i should not allow myself to be too much elat mr de la moll he
said with a sneer for even if thi tale be true it is treasur
trove and belong to the crown
ah said the squir i never thought of that
but i have answer the colonel quietli if i rememb right the
last of the origin de la moll left a will in which he especi
devis thi treasur hidden by hi father to your ancestor that it
is the ident treasur i am fortun in a posit to prove by
thi parchment and he laid upon the tabl the write he had found
with the gold
quit rightquit right said the squir that will take it out of
the custom
perhap the solicitor to the treasuri mai hold a differ opinion
said cossei with anoth sneer
just then ida took her hand from her face there wa a dewi look about
her ey and the last rippl of a happi smile linger round the
corner of her mouth
now that we have heard what colonel quaritch had to sai she said in
her softest voic and address her father there is no reason why
we should not finish our busi with mr cossei
here harold and georg turn to go she wave them back imperi
and began speak befor ani on could interfer take up her
speech where she had broken it off when she caught sight of the
colonel and georg come up the step

at thi announc the bewild squir put hi hand to hi head
edward cossei stagger visibl and rest himself against the tabl
while georg murmur audibl that a good job

the shadow of all the shame and agoni that she had undergon rose up
within her mind listen mr cossei and she point her finger at

father would be driven from hi home in hi old ag and that the
place he love would pass to strangerswould pass to you no father
do not stop me i will speak my mind
and at last i determin that cost what it might i would yield

well if that beant a master on ejacul georg aloud
ida who had never look more beauti than she did in thi moment
of passion turn to seat herself but the tension of her feel
and the torrent of her wrath and eloqu had been too much for her
she would have fallen had not harold who had been listen amaz to
thi overpow outburst of natur run up and caught her in hi
arm
as for edward cossei he had shrunk back involuntarili beneath the
volum of her scorn till he stood with hi back against the panel
wall hi face wa white as a sheet despair and furi shone in hi
dark ey never had he desir thi woman more fierc than he did
now in the moment when he knew that she had escap him for ever in
a sens he wa to be piti for passion tore hi heart in twain for
a moment he stood thu then with a spring rather than a step he
advanc across the room till he wa face to face with harold who
with ida still half faint in hi arm and her head upon hi
shoulder wa stand on the further side of the fireplac
damn you he said i ow thi to youyou halfpai adventur and
he lift hi arm as though to strike him
come none of that said the squir speak for the first time i
will have no brawl here
no put in georg edg hi long form between the two and
beg your pardon sir dont you go acal of better men than
yourself adwentur at ani rate if the colonel is an adwentur he
hev adwentur to some purpos as is easi for to see and he point
to ida
hold your tongu sir roar the squir as usual reliev hi
feel on hi retain you ar alwai shove your oar in where it
isnt want
all right squir all right said georg the imperturb thin
hi manner shouldnt be sich
do you mean to allow thi said cossei turn fierc to the old
gentleman do you mean to allow thi man to marri your daughter for
her monei
mr cossei answer the squir with hi politest and most old
fashion bow whatev sympathi i mai have felt for you is be
rapidli alien by your manner i told you that my daughter must
speak for herself she ha spoken veri clearli inde and in short
i have absolut noth to add to her word
i tell you what it is cossei said shake with furi i have been
trick and fool and plai with and so sure as there is a heaven
abov us i will have my reveng on you all the monei which thi man
sai that he ha found belong to the queen not to you and i will
take care that the proper peopl ar inform of it befor you can
make awai with it when that is taken from you if inde the whole
thing is not a trick we shall see what will happen to you i tell you
that i will take thi properti and i will pull thi old place you ar
so fond of down stone by stone and throw it into the moat and send
the plough over the site i will sell the estat piecem and blot it
out i tell you i have been trickedy encourag the marriag
yourself you know you did and forbad that man the hous and he
paus for breath and to collect hi word
again the squir bow and hi bow wa a studi in itself you do not
see such bow nowadai
on minut mr cossei he said veri quietli for it wa on of hi
peculiar to becom abnorm quiet in circumst of real
emerg and then i think that we mai close thi pain interview
when first i knew you i did not like you afterward through variou
circumst i modifi my opinion and set my dislik down to
prejudic you ar quit right in sai that i encourag the idea of
a marriag between you and my daughter also that i forbad the hous
to colonel quaritch i did so becaus to be honest i saw no other
wai of avoid the utter ruin of my famili but perhap i wa wrong
in so do i hope that you mai never be place in a posit which
will forc you to such a decis also at the time inde never till
thi moment have i quit realis how the matter realli stood i did
not understand how strongli my daughter wa attach in anoth
direct perhap i wa unwil to understand it nor did i
altogeth understand the cours of action by which it seem you
obtain a promis of marriag from my daughter in the first instanc
i wa anxiou for the marriag becaus i believ you to be a better
man than you ar also becaus i thought that it would place my
daughter and her descend in a much improv posit and that she
would in time becom attach to you i forbad colonel quaritch the
hous becaus i consid that an allianc with him would be
undesir for everybodi concern i find that in all thi i wa
act wrongli and i frankli admit it perhap as we grow old we grow
worldli also and you and your agent press me veri hard mr
cossei still i have alwai told you that my daughter wa a free agent
and must decid for herself and therefor i ow you no apolog on
thi score so much then for the question of your engag to miss
de la moll it is done with
now as regard the threat you make i shall try to meet them as
occas aris and if i cannot do so it will be my misfortun but
on thing thei show me though i am sorri to have to sai it to ani man
in a hous which i can still call my ownthei show me that my first
impress of you were the correct on you ar not a gentleman
mr cossei and i must beg to declin the honour of your further
acquaint and with anoth bow he open the vestibul door and
stood hold the handl in hi hand
edward cossei look round with a stare of rage then mutter on
most comprehens curs he stalk from the room and in anoth
minut wa drive fast through the ancient gatewai
let us piti him for he also certainli receiv hi due
georg follow him to the outer door and then did a thing that nobodi
had seen him do befor he burst out into a loud laugh
what ar you make that nois about ask hi master sternli
thi is no laugh matter
him repli georg point to the retreat dogcarth
ago to pull down the castl and throw it into the moat and to send
the plough over it is he himthat varmint why them old tower
will be astand there when hi beggarli bone is dust and when hi
name aint no more a name and therel be on of the old blood
sit in them too i knaw it and i hev allu knaw it come
squir though you allu du sai how as im a fule what did i tell
yer didnt i tell yer that prowid werent ago to let thi
place go to ani laryer or banker or thim sort why in cours i did
and now you see not but what it is all ow to the colonel he wa
the man as found it but then god almighti taught him where to dig
but he a good un he is and a gintleman not like him and onc
more he point with unutter scorn to the road down which edward
cossei had vanish
now look here said the squir dont you stand talk all dai
about thing you dont understand that the wai you wast time you
be off and look after thi gold it should not be left alon you
know we will come down present to molehil for i suppos that is
where it is no i cant stop to hear the stori now and besid i
want colonel quaritch to tell it to me
all right squir said georg touch hi red nightcap ill be
off and he start
georg halloa hi master after him but georg did not stop he
had a trick of deaf when the squir wa call that is if he
want to go somewher els
confound you roar the old gentleman why dont you stop when i
call you
thi time georg brought hi long lank frame to a standstil
beg pardon squir

better bring your wife and have dinner in the servant hall todai
and drink a glass of port

and look here georg give me your hand man here a merri
christma to you weve gone through some queerish time about thi
place togeth but now it almost look as though we were go to end

the place im a dutchman why ye it been a bad time and were
aget old but there that how it is the sky almost allu
clear toward nightfal god almighti hev a mind to let on down
easi i suppos
if you would talk a littl less about your maker and come to church
a littl more it would be a good thing as iv told you befor
said the squir but there go along with you
and the honest fellow went
chapter xliv
christma chime
the squir turn and enter the hous he gener wa fairli noisi
in hi movement but on thi occas he wa exception so
possibl he had a reason for it
on reach the vestibul he found harold and ida stand side by
side as though thei were be drill it wa imposs to resist
the conclus that thei had suddenli assum that attitud becaus it
happen to be the first posit into which thei could conveni
fall
there wa a moment silenc then harold took ida hand and led her
up to where her father wa stand
mr de la moll he said simpli onc more i ask you for your
daughter in marriag i am quit awar of my mani disqualif
especi those of my ag and the small of my mean but ida and
myself hope and believ that under all the circumst you will no
longer withhold your consent and he paus
quaritch answer the squir i have alreadi in your presenc told
mr cossei under what circumst i wa favour inclin to hi
propos so i need not repeat all that as regard your mean
although thei would have been quit insuffici to avert the ruin
which threaten us still you have i believ a compet and
ow to your wonder and most providenti discoveri the fear of
ruin seem to have pass awai it is ow to you that thi
discoveri which by the wai i want to hear all about ha been made
had it not been for you it never would have been made at all and
therefor i certainli have no right to sai anyth more about your
mean as to your ag well after all fortyfour is not the limit of
life and if ida doe not object to marri a man of those year i
cannot object to her do so with refer to your want of
occup i think that if you marri ida thi place will as time
ar keep your hand pretti full especi when you have an
obstin donkei like that fellow georg to deal with i am get
too old and stupid to look after it myself and besid thing ar so
topsyturvi that i cant understand them there is on thing more that
i want to sai i forbad you the hous well you ar a gener
mind man and it is human to err so i think that perhap you will
understand my action and not bear me a grudg on that account also i
dare sai that at the time and possibl at other time i said thing
i should be sorri for if i could rememb what thei were which i
cant and if so i apologis to you as a gentleman ought when he
find himself in the wrong and so i sai god bless you both and i
hope you will be happi in life togeth and now come here ida my
love and give me a kiss you have been a good daughter all your life
and so quaritch mai be sure that you will be a good wife too
ida did as she wa bid then she went over to her lover and took him
by hi hand and he kiss her on the forehead and thu after all
their troubl thei final ratifi the contract
and we who have follow them thu far and have perhap been a
littl move by their struggl hope and fear will sure not
grudg to reecho the squir oldfashion prayer god bless them
both
god bless them both long mai thei live and happili
long mai thei live and for veri long mai their children children of
the race if not of the name of de la moll pass in and out through
the old norman gatewai and by the sturdi norman tower the boissei
who built them here had their habit for six gener the de
la moll who wed the heiress of the boissei live here for
thirteen gener mai the quaritch whose ancestor marri ida
heiress of the de la moll endur as long
sure it is permit to us to lift a corner of the curtain of
futur and in spirit see ida quaritch state and beauti as we
knew her but of a happier counten we see her seat on some
christma ev to come in the drawingroom of the castl tell to
the children at her knee the wonder tale of how their father and
old georg on thi veri night when the gale blew long year ago
discov the ruddi pile of gold hoard in that aw storehous
amid the bone of saxon or danish hero and thu save her to be
their mother we can see their wide wonder ey and fix face as
for the tenth time thei listen to a stori befor which the joi of
cruso will grow pale we can hear the eager appeal for detail made
to the militarylook gentleman veri grizzl now but grown
betterlook with the advanc year who is stand befor the
fire the best most belov husband and father in all that countri
side
perhap there mai be a vacant chair and anoth tomb among the rank
of the depart de la moll perhap the ancient wall will no longer
echo to the sound of the squir stentorian voic and what of that
it is our common lot
but when he goe the countri side will lose a man of whom thei will
not see the like again for the breed is dead or dy a man whose
veri prejudic inconsist and occasion wronghead violenc
will be held when he is no longer here to have been endear
qualiti and for manli for downright english godfear
virtu for love of queen countri famili and home thei mai search
in vain to find hi equal among the cosmopolitan englishmen of the
dawn twentieth centuri hi fault were mani and at on time he
went near to sacrif hi daughter to save hi hous but he would
not have been the man he wa without them
and so to him too farewel perchanc he will find himself better
place in the valhalla of hi forefath surround by those stout
old de la moll whose memori he regard with so much affect than
here in thi thinblood victorian era for as ha been said
elsewher the old squir would undoubtedli have look better in a
chain shirt and bear a battl ax than ever he did in a frock coat
especi with hi retain georg arm to the teeth behind him
thei kiss and it wa done
out from the church tower in the meadow broke with clash and clangour
a glad sound of christma bell out it swept over layer pitl and
fallow over river plantain grove and wood it float down the
vallei of the ell it beat against dead man mount henceforth to the
vulgar mind more haunt than ever it echo up the castl norman
tower and down the oakclad vestibul awai over the common went the
glad messag of earth saviour awai high into the air startl the
rook upon their airi cours as though the iron note of the world
rejoic would fain float to the throne feet of the world
everlast king
peac and goodwil ay and happi to the children of men while
their span is and hope for the beyond and heaven bless on holi
love and all good thing that ar thi is what those liquid note
seem to sai to the most happi pair who stood hand in hand in the
vestibul and thought on all thei had escap and all that thei had
won
well quaritch if you and ida have quit done stare at each other
which isnt veri interest to a third parti perhap you will not
mind tell us how you happen on old sir jame de la moll
hoard
thu adjur harold began hi thrill stori tell the whole
histori of the night in detail and if hi hearer had expect to be
astonish certainli their expect were consider more than
fulfil
upon my word said the squir when he had done i think i am
begin to grow superstiti in my old ag hang me if i dont
believ it wa the finger of provid itself that point out those
letter to you anywai im off to see the spoil run and get your
hat ida my dear and we will all go togeth
and thei went and look at the chest full of red gold ye and
pass down all three of them into those chill presenc in the
bowel of the mount then come thenc aw and silent thei seal up
the place for ever
conclus
goodby
on the follow morn such of the inhabit of boisingham as
chanc to be about were much interest to see an ordinari farm
tumbrel come down the main street it wa be driven or rather
led by no less a person than georg himself while behind it walk
the wellknown form of the old squir arminarm with colonel
quaritch
thei were still more interest howev when the tumbrel drew up at
the door of the banknot cossei but the opposit bankwher
although it wa box dai the manag and the clerk were appar
wait for it arriv
but their interest culmin when thei perceiv that the cart onli
contain a few bag and yet that each of these bag seem to
requir three or four men to lift it with ani comfort
thu wa the gold safe hous upon be weigh it valu wa
found to be about fiftythre thousand pound of modern monei but as
some of the coin were exceedingli rare and of great worth to museum
and collector thi valu wa consider increas and the
treasur wa ultim sold for fiftysix thousand two hundr and
fiftyfour pound onli ida kept back enough of the choicest coin to
make a gold waistband or girdl and a necklac for herself destin
no doubt in futur dai to form the most cherish heirloom of the
quaritch famili
on that same even the squir and harold went to london and open
up commun with the solicitor to the treasuri fortun thei
were abl to refer to the will of sir edward de la moll the second
baronet in which he special devis to hi cousin geoffrei
dofferleigh and hi heir for ever not onli hi estat but hi
land togeth with the treasur hid thereon or elsewher by my late
murder father sir jame de la moll also thei produc the
write which ida had found in the old bibl and the parchment
discov by georg among the coin these three document form a
chain of evid which even offici interest for the treasuri
could not refus to admit and in the upshot the crown renounc it
claim and the properti in the gold pass to the squir subject to
the payment of the same success duti which he would have been
call upon to meet had he inherit a like sum from a cousin at the
present time
and so it came to pass that when the mortgag monei wa due it wa
paid to the last farth capit and interest and edward cossei
lost hi hold upon honham for ever
as for edward cossei himself we mai sai on more word about him in
the cours of time he suffici recov from hi violent passion
for ida to allow him to make a brilliant marriag with the onli
daughter of an impecuni peer she keep her name and titl and he
plai the part of the necessari husband anyhow my reader if it is
your fortun to frequent the gild saloon of the great you mai meet
ladi honoria tallton and mr cossei if you do meet him howev it
mai be as well to avoid him for the event of hi life have not been
of a natur to improv hi temper thi much then of edward cossei
if after leav the gild saloon aforesaid you should happen to
wander through the london street you mai meet anoth charact in
thi histori you mai see a sweet pale face still stamp with a
childlik round and simplic but half hidden in the coars
hood of the nun you mai see her and if you care to follow you mai
find what is the work wherein she seek her peac it would shock you
but it is her work of merci and love kind and she doe it
unflinchingli among her sister nun there is no on more belov than
sister agn so goodby to her also
harold quaritch and ida were marri in the spring and the villag
children strew the churchyard path with primros and violetsth
same path where in anguish of soul thei had met and part on that
dreari winter night
and there at the old church door when the wreath is on her brow and
the veil about her face let us bid farewel to ida and her husband
harold quaritch
