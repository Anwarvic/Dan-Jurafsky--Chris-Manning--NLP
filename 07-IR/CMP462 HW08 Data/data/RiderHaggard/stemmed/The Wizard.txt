let those who care to studi the histori of the rev thoma owen and
of that strang man who carri on and complet hi work answer thi
question accord to their judgment
the time wa a sundai afternoon in summer and the place a church in
the midland counti it wa a beauti church ancient and spaciou
moreov it had recent been restor at great cost seven or eight
hundr peopl could have found sit in it and doubtless thei
had done so when busscomb wa a larg manufactur town befor the
failur of the coal suppli and other caus drove awai it trade now

agricultur villag with a popul of 300 soul out of thi
popul includ the choir boi exactli thirtynin had elect to
attend church on thi particular sundai and of these three were fast
asleep and four were doze
the rev thoma owen count them from hi seat in the chancel for
anoth clergyman wa preach and as he count bitter and
disappoint took hold of him the preacher wa a deput sent
by on of the larg missionari societi to arous the indiffer to
a sens of duti toward their unconvert black brethren in africa and
incident to collect cash to be spent in the convers of the
said brethren the rev thoma owen himself suggest the visit of the
deput and had labour hard to secur him a good audienc but
the beauti of the weather or terror of the inevit subscript
prevail against him henc hi disappoint
well he thought with a sigh i have done my best and i must make
it up out of my own pocket
then he settl himself to listen to the sermon
the preacher a batteredlook individu of between fifti and sixti
year of ag wa gaunt with recent sick patient and unimagin
in aspect he preach extemporarili with the aid of note and it
cannot be said that hi discours wa remark for interest at ani
rate in it begin doubtless the spars congreg so prone to
slumber discourag him for offer exhort to empti bench is
but weari work inde he wa medit the advis of bring
hi argument to an abrupt conclus when chanc to glanc round he
becam awar that he had at least on sympathet listen hi host

from that moment the sermon improv by degre till at length it
reach a realli high level of excel ceas from rhetor the
speaker began to tell of hi own experi and suffer in the caus
amongst savag tribe for he himself wa a missionari of mani year
stand he told how onc he and a companion had been sent to a
nation who name themselv the son of fire becaus their god wa the
lightn if inde thei could be said to boast ani god other than
the spear and the king in simpl languag he narrat hi terribl
adventur among these savag the murder of hi companion by command
of the council of wizard and hi own flight for hi life a tale
so interest and vivid that even the bucol sleeper awaken and
listen openmouth
but thi is by the wai he went on for my societi doe not ask you
to subscrib toward the convers of the children of fire until that
peopl is conqueredwhich veri like will not be for gener
see that thei live in central africa occupi a territori that
white men do not desireno missionari will dare again to visit them
at thi moment someth caus him to look a second time at thoma
owen he wa lean forward in hi place listen eagerli and a
strang light fill the larg dark ey that shone in the pallor of
hi delic nervou face
there is a man who would dare if he were put to it thought the
deput to himself then he end hi sermon
that even the two men sat at dinner in the rectori it wa a veri
fine rectori beautifulli furnish for owen wa a man of tast which
he had the mean to gratifi also although thei were alon the dinner
wa goodso good that the poor brokendown missionari sip hi
unaccustom port a vintag wine sigh aloud in admir and
involuntari envi

ad that is everyth heaven forgiv me but i who enjoi your
hospit am enviou of you dont think too hardli of me i have a
larg famili to support and if onli you knew what a struggl my life
is and ha been for the last twenti year you would not i am sure

labour is worthi of hi hire well my hire is under two hundr a
year and eight of us must liveor starveon it and i have work
ay until my health is broken a labour inde i am a veri hodman a
spiritu sisyphu and now i must go back to carri my load and roll
my stone again and again among those hopeless savag till i die of

at least it is a nobl life and death exclaim owen a sudden fire
of enthusiasm burn in hi dark ey
ye view from a distanc were you ask to leav thi live of two
thousand a yeari see that is what thei put it at in crockfordwith
it english comfort and easi work that you might lead that life and
attain that death then you would think differ but why should
i bore you with such talk thank heaven that your line ar cast in
pleasant place ye pleas i will take on more glass it doe me
good
tell me some more about that tribe you were speak of in your sermon
the son of fire i think you call them said owen as he pass him
the decant
so with an eloqu induc by the gener wine and a quicken
imagin the deput told himtold him mani strang thing and
terribl for thi peopl wa an aw peopl vigor in mind
and bodi and warrior from gener to gener but
superstitionridden and cruel thei live in the far interior some
month journei by boat and oxwaggon from the coast and of white men
and their wai thei knew but littl
how mani of them ar there ask owen
who can sai he answer nearli halfamillion perhap at least
thei pretend that thei can put sixti thousand men under arm
and did thei treat you badli when you first visit them
not at first thei receiv us civilli enough and on a given dai we
were request to explain to the king and the council of wizard the
religion which we came to teach all that dai we explain and all
the nextor rather my friend did for i knew veri littl of the
languageand thei listen with great interest at last the chief of
the wizard and the first prophet to the king rose to question us he
wa name hokosa a tall thin man with a spiritu face and terribl
calm ey
you speak well son of a white man he said but let us pass from
word to deed you tell us that thi god of your whom you desir that
we should take as our god so that you mai becom hi chief prophet in
the land wa a wizard such as we ar though grater than we ar for
not onli did he know the past and the futur as we do but also he could
cure those who were smitten with hopeless sick and rais those
who were dead which we cannot do you tell us moreov that by faith
those who believ on him can do work as great as he did and that you
do believ on him therefor we will put you to the proof ho there
lead forth that evil on
as he spoke a man wa place befor us on who had been convict of
witchcraft or some other crime
kill him said hokosa
there wa a faint cry a scuffl a flash of spear and the man lai
still befor us
now follow of the new god said hokosa rais him from the dead
as your master did
in vain did we offer explan
peac said hokosa at length your word weari us look now either
you have preach to us a fals god and ar liar or you ar traitor
to the king you preach sinc lack faith in him you cannot do such
work as he give power to do to those who have faith in him out of
your own mouth ar you judg white men choos which horn of the bull
you will you hang to on of them and it shall pierc you thi is
the sentenc of the king i speak it who am the king mouth that you
white man who have spoken to us and cheat us these two weari dai
be put to death and that you hi companion who have been silent be
driven from the land
i can hardli bear to tell the rest of it mr owen thei gave my poor
friend ten minut to talk to hi spirit then thei spear him befor
my face after it wa over hokosa spoke to me sai
go back white man to those who sent you and tell them the word of
the son of fire that thei have listen to the messag of peac
and though thei ar a peopl of warrior yet thei thank them for that
messag for in itself it sound good and beauti in their ear if it
be true tell them that have prove you liar thei dealt with you as
all honest men seek that liar should be dealt with tell them that thei
desir to hear more of thi matter and if on can be sent to them who
ha no fals tongu who in all thing fulfil the promis of hi
lip that thei will hearken to him and treat him well but that for
such as you thei keep a spear
and who went after you got back ask owen who wa listen with
the deepest interest
who went do you suppos that there ar mani mad clergymen in africa
mr owen nobodi went
and yet said owen speak more to himself than to hi guest the
man hokosa wa right and the christian who of a truth believ the
promis of our religion should trust to them and go
then perhap you would like to undertak the mission mr owen said
the deput briskli for the reflect stung him unintent as
it wa
owen start
that is a new idea he said and now perhap you wish to go to bed
it is past eleven oclock
chapter ii
thoma owen
thoma owen went to hi room but not to bed take a bibl from the
tabl he consult refer after refer
the promis is clear he said aloud present as he shut the
book clear and often repeat there is no escap from it and no
possibl of a doubl mean if it is not true then it would seem
that noth is true and that everi christian in the world is trick
and delud but if it is true why do we never hear of miracl
the answer is easi becaus we have not faith enough to work them the
apostl work miracl for thei had seen therefor their faith wa
perfect sinc their dai nobodi faith ha been quit perfect at least
i think not the physic part of our natur prevent it or perhap the
miracl still happen but thei ar spiritu miracl
then he sat down by the open window and gaze at the dreami beauti of
the summer night he thought for hi soul wa troubl onc befor
it had been troubl thu that wa nine year ago for now he wa but
littl over thirti then a call had come to him a voic had seem to
speak to hi ear bid him to lai down great possess to follow
whither heaven should lead him thoma owen had obei the voic
though ow to circumst which need not be detail to do so he
wa oblig to renounc hi success to a veri larg estat and to
content himself with a younger son portion of thirti thousand pound
and the revers to the live which he had now held for some five
year
then and there with singular unanim and despatch hi relat came
to the conclus that he wa mad to thi hour inde those who stand
in hi place and enjoi the wealth and posit that were hi by right
speak of him as poor thoma and mark their disapprob of hi
peculiar conduct by refus with an unvari steadi to subscrib
even a singl shill to a missionari societi how poor thoma speak
of them in the place where he is we mai wonder but as yet we cannot
knowprob with the gentl love and chariti that mark hi everi
action upon earth but thi is by the wai
he had enter the church but what had he done in it shadow thi wa
the question which owen ask himself as he sat that night by the open
window arraign hi past befor the judgmentseat of conscienc for
three year he had work hard somewher in the slum then thi live
had fallen to him he had taken it and from that dai forward hi record
wa veri much of a blank the parish wa small and well order there
wa littl to do in it and the salvat armi had seiz upon and
reclaim two of the three confirm drunkard it could boast
hi guest sai echo in hi brain like the catch of a tunethat
you might lead that life and attain that death suppos that
he were bidden so to do now thi veri night would he inde think
differ he had becom a priest to serv hi maker how would it be
were that maker to command that he should serv him in thi extrem and
heroic fashion would he flinch from the steel or would he meet it as
the martyr met it of old
physic he wa littl suit to such an enterpris for in appear
he wa slight and pale and in constitut delic also there wa
anoth reason against the thing high church and somewhat ascet in
hi principl in the begin he had admir celibaci and in secret
dedic himself to that state but at heart thoma wa veri much a
man and of late he had come to see that which is against natur is
presum not right though fanat mai not hesit to pronounc
it wrong possibl thi convers to more genial view of life wa
quicken by the presenc in the neighbourhood of a young ladi whom
he chanc to admir at least it is certain that the mere thought of
see her no more for ever smote him like a sword of sudden pain
that veri nightor so it seem to him and so he believedth angel
of the lord stood befor him as he wa wont to stand befor the men of
old and spoke a summon in hi ear how or in what seem that summon
came thoma owen never told and we need not inquir at the least he
heard it and like the apostl he aros and gird hi loin to obei
for now in the hour of trial it prove that thi man faith partook
of the natur of their faith it wa utter and virgin it wa not
clog with nineteenthcenturi qualif it had never dalli
with strang doctrin or kiss the feet of pinchbeck substitut for
god in hi heart he believ that the almighti without intermediari
but face to face had bidden him to go forth into the wilder there
to perish so he bow hi head and went
on the follow morn at breakfast owen had some talk with hi friend
the deput
you ask me last night he said quietli whether i would undertak
a mission to that peopl of whom you were tell meth son of fire
well i have been think it over and come to the conclus that i
will do so
at thi point the deput conclud that hi host must be mad
move quietli but decidedli toward the door
wait a moment went on owen in a matteroffact voic the dogcart
will not be round for anoth threequart of an hour tell me if it
were offer to you and on investig you prove suitabl would you
care to take over thi live
would i care to take over thi live gasp the astonish
deput would i care to walk down that garden and find myself in
heaven but why ar you make fun of me
i am not make fun of you if i go to africa i must give up the
live of which i own the advowson and it occur to me that it might
suit youthat is all you have done your share your health is broken
and you have mani depend upon you it seem right therefor that
you should rest and that i should work if i do no good yonder at the
least you and your will be a littl benefit
that same dai owen chanc to meet the ladi who ha been spoken of as
have caught hi heart he had meant to go awai without see her but
fortun brought them togeth hitherto whilst in realiti lead him
on she had seem to keep him at a distanc with the result that he
did not know that it wa her fix intent to marri him to her
with some hesit he told hi plan surpris and frighten into
candour the ladi reason with him warmli and when reason fail to
move him she did more by some subtl movement with some sudden word
she lift the veil of her reserv and suffer him to see her heart
if you will not stai for aught els said her troubl ey then
love stai for me
for a moment he wa shaken then he answer the look straight out as
wa hi natur
i never guess he said i did not presum to hopenow it is too
late listen i will tell you what i have told no live soul though
thereaft you mai think me mad weak and humbl as i am i believ
myself to have receiv a divin mission i believ that i shall execut
it or bring about it execut but at the ultim cost of my own
life still in such a servic two ar better than on if youcan care
enoughif you
but the ladi had alreadi turn awai and wa murmur her farewel in
accent that sound like a sob love and faith after thi sort were not
given to her
of all owen trial thi wa the sharpest of all hi sacrific thi
wa the most complet
chapter iii
the temptat
two year have gone by all but a few month and from the rectori in a
quiet english villag we pass to a scene in central or south central
africa
on the brow of a grassi slope dot over with mimosa thorn and close
to a gush stream of water stand a hous or rather a hut built
of green brick and thatch with grass behind thi hut is a fenc of
thorn rough but strong design to protect all within it from the
attack of lion and other beast of prei at present save for a
solitari mule eat it provend by the wheel of a tent oxwaggon
it is unten for the cattl have not yet been kraal for the
night present thoma owen enter thi enclosur by the back door of
the hut and have attend to the mule which whinni at the sight
of him goe to the gate and watch there till he see hi nativ boi
drive the cattl up the slope of the hill at length thei arriv and
when he ha count them to make sure that none ar miss and in a
few kind word commend the herd for their watch he walk
to the front of the hous and seat himself upon a wooden stool set
under a mimosa tree that grow near the door he look earnestli toward
the west
the man ha chang somewhat sinc last we saw him to begin with he
ha grown a beard and although the hot african sun ha bronz it
into an appear of health hi face is even thinner than it wa and
therein the great spiritu ey shine still more strang
at the foot of the slope run a wide river just here broken into rapid
where the water make an angri music beyond thi river stretch a
vast plain bound on the horizon by mountain rang each line of them
rise higher than the other till their topmost and more distant peak
melt impercept into the tender blue of the heaven thi is the land
of the son of fire and yonder amid the slope of the nearest hill is
the great kraal of their king umsuka whose name be interpret
mean the thunderbolt
in the veri midst of the foam rapid and about a thousand yard
from the hous li a space of rippl shallow water where unless it
chanc to be in flood the river can be ford it is thi ford that
owen watch so intent
john should have been back twelv hour ago he mutter to himself i
prai that no harm ha befallen him at the great place yonder
just then a tini speck appear far awai on the plain it is a man
travel toward the water at a swing trot go into the hut
owen return with a pair of fieldglass and through them scrutinis
the figur of the man
heaven be prais it is john he mutter with a sigh of relief
now i wonder what answer he bring
half an hour later john stand befor him a stalwart nativ of the
tribe of the amasuka the peopl of fire and with uplift hand salut
him give him titl of honour

to do tell me have you seen the king and what is hi word

that titl you bade me make you knownwho for a year ha dwelt in the
land that your spear have wast beyond the bank of the river these

air who tame the thunderbolt and compel the rain and that he must
show himself greater than all of these if he would not pass henc by the
bridg of spear let him therefor take counsel with hi heart and
with him he serv if such a on there is and let him come or let him
stai awai as it shall pleas him
so be it said owen the word of the king ar good and tomorrow we
will start for the great place
john heard and assent but without eager
my father he said in a doubt and tent voic would it not
perhap be better to bide here awhil first
why ask owen we have sown and now is the hour to reap

came into my mind that now is not the time to convert the son of fire
there is troubl brew at the great palac father listen and i will
tell you as i have heard so i will tell you you know well that our
king umsuka ha two son hafela and nodwengo and of these hafela is
the heirappar the fruit of the chief wife of the king and nodwengo

mother whom the king love of late it ha been discov that hafela
weari of wait for power ha made a plot to depos hi father and to
kill nodwengo hi brother so that the land and those who dwell in it
mai becom hi without question thi plot the king knowsi had it from
on of hi women who is my sisterand he is veri wroth yet he dare do
littl for he grow old and timid and seek rest not war yet he is
mind if he can find the heart to go back upon the law and to

firstfruit which shall be held on the third dai from tonight thi
hafela know and nodwengo know it also and each of them ha summon
hi follow number thousand and ten of thousand of spear to

of vultur my father and when the brother and their regiment rush
togeth fight for the throne what will chanc to the white man who
come at such a moment to preach a faith of peac and to hi servant
on john who led him there
i do not know answer owen and it troubl me not at all i go to
carri out my mission and in thi wai or in that it will be carri out

kill you you teach beauti thing but sai ar you a wizard when
the child of a woman yonder lai dead you could not rais it as did the
christ when the oxen were sick with the pest you could not cure them
or at least my father you did not although you wept for the child and
were sorri at the loss of the oxen now my father if perchanc
thei ask you to do such thing as these yonder or die sai what will
happen
on of two thing john either i shall die or i shall do the thing
buthesit johnsur you do not believ that and he broke
off
owen turn round and look at hi discipl with kindl ey i do
believ o you of littl faith he said i do believ that yonder i
have a mission and that he whom i serv will give me power to carri
out that mission you ar right i can work no miracl but he can work
miracl whom everyth in heaven and earth obei and if there is need
he will work them through me hi instrument or perhap he will
not work them and i shall die becaus thu hi end will best be
forward at the least i go in faith fear noth for what ha he
to fear who know the will of god and doe it but to you who doubt i
sayleav me
the man spread out hi hand in deprec hi thick lip trembl a
littl and someth like a tear appear at the corner of hi ey
father he said am i a coward that you should talk to me thu
i who for twenti year have been a soldier of my king and for ten a
captain in my regiment these scar show whether or no i am a coward
and he point to hi breast but of them i will not speak i am no
coward els i had not gone upon that errand of your why then should
you reproach me becaus my ear ar not so open as your as my heart
ha not understand i worship that god of whom you have taught me
but he never speak to me as he doe to you i never meet him as i walk
at night he leav me quit alon therefor it is that i fear that
when the hour of trial come he mai desert you and unless he cover you
with hi shield of thi i am sure that the spear is forg which shall
blush red in your heart my father it is for you that i fear who ar
so gentl and tender not for myself who am well accustom to look in
the ey of death and who expect no more than death
forgiv me said owen hastili for he wa move and be sure that
the shield will be over us till the time come for us to pass whither we
shall need none
that night owen rose from the task at which he wa labour slowli and
painfullya translat of passag from the gospel of st john into
the languag of the amasukaand go to the open windowplac of the
hut he rest hi elbow upon it and thought stare with empti ey
into the black of the night now it wa as he sat thu that a great
agoni of doubt took possess of hi soul the strength which hitherto
had support him seem to be withdrawn and he wa left as john
had said quit alon strang voic seem to whisper in hi ear
reproach and revil him temptat long ago trampl under foot
rose again in might allur him
fool said the voic get you henc befor it is too late you have
been mad you who dream that for your sake to satisfi your pride the
almighti will break hi silenc and strain hi law ar you then better
or greater or purer than million who have gone befor you that for
you and you alon thi thing should be done why were it not that you
ar mad you would be among the chief of sinner you who dare to ask
that the power of heaven should be set within your feebl hand that
the angel of heaven should wait upon your mortal breath worm that you
ar ha god need of such as you if it is hi will to turn the heart
of yonder peopl he will do it but not by mean of you you and the
servant whom you ar delud to hi death will perish miser and
thi alon shall be the fruit of your presumptu sin get you back out
of thi wilder befor the mad take you afresh you ar still
young you have wealth look where she stand yonder whom you desir
get you back and forget your folli in her arm
these thought and mani other of like natur tore owen soul in
that hour of strang and terribl temptat he seem to see himself
stand befor the thousand of the savag nation he went to save and
to hear the mock voic of their witchfind command him if he
were a true man and the servant of that god of whom he prate to
give them a sign onli a littl sign perhap to move a stone without
touch it with hi hand or to caus a dead bough to blossom
then he would beseech heaven with frantic prayer and in vain till at
length amidst a roar of laughter he the fals prophet and the liar
wa led out to hi doom he saw the piteou wonder look of the
believ whom he had betrai to death he saw the fierc face and
the spear on high see all thi hi spirit broke and just as the
littl clock in the room behind him struck the first stroke of midnight
with a great and bitter cry to god to give him back the faith and
strength that he had lost owen head fell forward and he sank into a
swoon there upon the windowplac
chapter iv

becam evid for as he appear a white spot at the foot of the
slope countless head turn and myriad of ey fasten themselv
upon him for an instant he wa dismai there wa someth terrifi
in thi numberless multitud of warrior and the thought of the task
that he had undertaken crush hi spirit then he rememb and
shake off hi fear and doubt alon save for hi discipl john
hold the crucifix aloft he walk slowli up the wide road toward
the place where he guess that the king must be hi arm wa weari er

night we hear the echo of their voic when thei ar angri thei haunt
the thundercloud and when thei ar pleas thei smile in the sunshin
sometim also thei appear in the shape of snake or visit us in
dream and then we offer them sacrific yonder on the hillsid is a
haunt wood it is full of their spirit white man but thei cannot
talk thei onli mutter and their footfal sound like the drop of
heavi rain for thei ar strengthless and unhappi and in the end thei
fade awai
so you sai answer owen who ar not altogeth without
understand yet know littl never have been taught now listen to
me and veri earnestli he preach to him and those about him of peac
of forgiv and of life everlast
why should a god die miser upon a cross ask the king at length
that through hi sacrific men might becom as god answer owen
believ in him and he will save you
how can we do that ask the king again when alreadi we have a god
can we desert on god and set up anoth
what god king
i will show him to you white man let my litter be brought
the litter wa brought and the king enter it with labour breath
pass through the north gate of the great place the parti ascend a
slope of the hill that lai beyond it till thei reach a flat plain some
hundr of yard in width on thi plain veget grew scantili for
here the bed rock of ironston denud with frequent and heavi rain
wa scarc hidden by a thin crust of earth on the further side of the
plain howev and separ from it by a littl stream wa a green
bank of deep soft soil beyond which lai a gloomi vallei full of great
tree that for mani gener had been the buryingplac of the king
of the amasuka
thi is the hous of the god said the king
a strang hous answer owen and where is he that dwell in it
follow me and i will show you messeng but be swift for alreadi the
sky grow dark with come tempest
now at the king command the bearer bore him across the sere plateau
toward a stone that lai almost in it centr present thei halt
and point to thi mass the king said
behold the god
owen advanc and examin the object a glanc told him that thi god
of the amasuka wa a meteor stone of unusu size most of such stone
ar mere shapeless lump but thi on bore a peculiar resembl to
a seat human be hold up on arm toward the sky so strang wa
thi like that other reason apart it seem not wonder that
savag should regard the thing with aw and vener rather would it
have been wonder had thei not done so
sai now said owen to the king when he had inspect the stone what
is the histori of thi dumb god of your and why do you worship him
follow me across the stream and i will tell you messeng answer
the king again glanc at the sky the storm gather and when it
break none ar safe upon thi plain except the heaven doctor such as
hokosa and hi companion who can bind the lightn
so thei went and when thei reach the further side of the stream umsuka
descend from hi litter
messeng he said thi is the stori of the god as it ha come down
to us from the begin our land ha been scourg with lightn
abov all other land and with the flood of rain that accompani the
lightn in the old dai the great place of the king wa out yonder
among the mountain but everi year fire from heaven fell upon it
destroi much peopl and at length in a great tempest the hous of
the king of that dai wa smitten and burn and hi wive and children
were turn to ash then that king held a council of hi wizard
and firedoctor and these have consult the spirit of their
forefath retir into a place apart to fast and prai ye it wa
in yonder vallei the buri ground of king that thei hid themselv
now on the third night the god of fire appear to the chief of the
doctor in hi sleep and he wa shape like a burn brand and smoke
went up from him out of the smoke he spoke to the doctor sai for
thi reason it is that i torment your peopl that thei hate me and
curs at me and pai me littl honour
in hi dream the doctor answer how can the peopl honour a god that
thei do not see then the god said rise up now in the night all the
compani of you and go take your stand upon the bank of yonder stream
and i will fall down in fire from heaven and there on the plain you
shall find my imag then let your king move hi great place into the
vallei beneath the plain and henceforth my bolt shall spare it and
him onli month by month you shall make prayer and offer to me
moreov the name of the peopl shall be chang for it shall be
call the peopl of fire
now the doctor rose and have awaken hi companion he told them
of hi vision then thei all of them went down to the bank of thi
stream where we now stand and as thei wait there a great tempest
burst over them and in the midst of that tempest thei saw the flame
figur of a man descend from heaven and when he touch the earth it
shook the morn came and there upon the plain befor them where
there had been noth sat the like of the god as it sit todai
and shall sit for ever so the name of thi peopl wa chang and the
king great place wa built where it now is
sinc that dai messeng no hut ha been burn and no man kill
in or about the great place by fire from heaven which fall onli here
where the god is though awai among the mountain and elsewher men ar
sometim kill but wait a while and you shall see with your ey
hokosa do you whom the lightn will not touch take that pole of
dead wood and set it up yonder in the crevic of the rock not far from
the figur of the god
i obei said hokosa although i have brought no medicin with me
perhap he ad with a faint sneer the white man who is so great a
wizard will not be afraid to accompani me
now owen saw that all those present were look at him curious
it wa evid thei believ that he would not dare to accept the
challeng therefor he answer at onc and without hesit
certainli i will come the pole is heavi for on man to carri and
where hokosa goe there i can go also
nai nai messeng said the king the lightn know hokosa and
will turn from him but you ar a stranger to it and it will eat you
up
king answer owen i do not believ that hokosa ha ani power over
the lightn it mai strike him or it mai strike me but unless my god
so command it will strike neither of us
on your head be it white man said hokosa with cold anger come
aid me with the pole
then thei lift the dead tree and between them carri it into the
middl of the plain where thei set it up in a crevic of the rock by
thi time the storm wa almost over them and watch it owen perceiv
that the lightn struck alwai along the bank of the stream
doubtless follow a hidden line of the bed of ironston
it is but a veri littl storm said hokosa contemptu such as
visit us almost everi afternoon at thi period of the year ah white
man i would that you could see on of our great tempest for these ar
worth behold thi i fear howev that you will never do see it
is like that within some few minut you will have pass back to that
king who sent you here with a hole in your head and a black mark down
your spine
that we shall learn present hokosa answer owen for my part i
prai that no such fate mai overtak you
now hokosa move himself awai mutter and point with hi finger
but owen remain stand within about thirti yard of the pole
suddenli there came a glare of light and the pole wa split into
fragment but although the shock wa percept thei remain unhurt
almost immedi a second flash leap from the cloud and owen saw
hokosa stagger and fall to hi knee the man is struck he thought
to himself but it wa not so for recov hi balanc the wizard
walk back to the stream
owen never stir from boyhood courag had been on of hi good
qualiti but it wa a courag of the spirit rather than of the flesh
for instanc at thi veri moment so far as hi bodi wa concern
he wa much afraid and did not in the least enjoi stand upon an
ironston plateau at the immin risk of be destroi by lightn
but even if he had not had an end to gain he would have scorn to give
wai to hi human frailti also now as alwai hi faith support
him as it happen the storm which wa slight pass by and no more
flash fell when it wa over he walk back to where the king and hi
court were stand
messeng said umsuka you ar not onli a great doctor you ar also
a brave man and such i honour there is no on among us here not be
a lord of the lightn who would have dare to stand upon that place
with hokosa while the flash fell about him yet you have done it it
wa hokosa who wa driven awai you have pass the trial by fire and
henceforth whether we refus your messag or accept it you ar great
in thi land
there is no need to prais me king answer owen the risk is
someth but i knew that i wa protect from it see that i shall
not die until my hour come and it is not yet listen now your god
yonder is noth but a stone such as i have often seen befor for
sometim in great tempest thei come to earth from the cloud you ar
not the first peopl that have worship such a stone but now we know
better also thi plain befor you is full of iron and iron draw
the lightn that is why it never strike your town below the iron
attract it more strongli than earth and hut of straw again while the
pole stood i wa in littl danger for the lightn strike the highest
thing but after the pole wa shatter and hokosa wise went awai
then i wa in some danger onli no flash fell i am not a magician
king but i know some thing that you do not know and i trust in on
whom i shall lead you to trust also
we will talk of thi more hereaft said the king hurriedli for on
dai i have heard and seen enough also i do not believ your word
for i have note ever that those who ar the greatest wizard of all sai
continu that thei have no magic power hokosa you have been famou
in your dai but it seem that henceforth you who have led must follow
the battl is not yet fought king answer hokosa todai i met the
lightn without my medicin and it wa a littl storm when i
am prepar with my medicin and the tempest is great then i will
challeng thi white man to face me yonder and then in that hour my
god shall show hi strength and hi god shall not be abl to save
him
that we shall see when the time come answer owen with a smile
that night as owen sat in hi hut work at the translat of st
john the door wa open and hokosa enter
white man said the wizard you ar too strong for me though whenc
you have your power i know not let us make a bargain show me your
magic and i will show you mine and we will rule the land between us
you and i ar much akinw ar great we have the spirit sight we
know that there ar thing beyond the thing we see and hear and feel
wherea for the rest thei ar fool follow the flesh alon i have
spoken
veri gladli will i show you my magic hokosa answer owen
cheerfulli sinc to speak truth though i know you to be wick and
guess that you would be glad to be rid of me by fair mean or foul yet
i have taken a like for you see in you on who from a sinner mai
grow into a saint
thi then is my magic to love god and serv man to eschew wizardri
wealth and power to seek after holi poverti and humil to
deni your flesh and to make yourself small in the sight of men that so
perchanc you mai grow great in the sight of heaven and save your soul
aliv
i have no stomach for that lesson said hokosa
yet you shall live to hunger for it answer owen and the wizard
went awai anger but wonder
chapter ix
the crisi
now dai by dai for someth over a month owen preach the gospel
befor the king hi councillor and hundr of the head men of the
nation thei listen to him attent debat the new doctrin
point by point for although thei might be savag these peopl were
veri keenwit and subtl veri patient did owen sow and at length
to hi infinit joi he also gather in hi firstfruit on night as he
sat in hi hut labour as usual at the work of translat wherein
he wa assist by john whom he had taught to read and write the princ
nodwengo enter and greet him for a while he sat silent watch the
white man at hi task then he said
messeng i have a boon to ask of you can you teach me to understand
those sign which you set upon the paper and to make them also as doe
john your servant
certainli answer owen if you will come to me at noon tomorrow
we will begin
the princ thank him but he did not go awai inde from hi manner
owen guess that he had someth more upon hi mind at length it came
out
messeng he said you have told us of baptism wherebi we ar
admit into the armi of your king sai have you the power of thi
rite
i have
and is your servant here baptis
he is
then if he who is a common man can be baptis why mai not i who am a
princ
in baptism answer owen there is no distinct between the
highest and the lowest but if you believ then the door is open and
through it you can join the compani of heaven
messeng i do believ answer the princ humbl
then owen wa veri joy and that same night with john for a wit
he baptis the princ give him the new name of constantin after
the first christian emperor
on the follow dai nodwengo in the presenc of owen who on thi
point would suffer no conceal announc to the king that he had
becom a christian umsuka heard and for a while sat silent then he
said in a troubl voic
truli messeng in the word of that book from which you read to us
i fear that you have come hither to bring not peac but a sword now
when the witchdoctor and the priest of fire learn thi that he whom
i have chosen to succe me ha becom the servant of anoth faith
thei will stir up the soldier and there will be civil war i prai you
therefor keep the matter secret at ani rate for a while see that
the live of mani ar at stake
in thi my father answer the princ i must do as the messeng
bid me but if you desir it take from me the right of success and
call back my brother from the northern mountain
that by poison or the spear he mai put all of us to death nodwengo
be not afraid er long when he learn all that is happen here your
brother hafela will come from the northern mountain and the spear of
hi impi shall be countless as the star of the sky messeng you
desir to draw us to the arm of your godand myself i am at
time mind to follow the path of my son nodwengo and seek a refug
therebut sai will thei be strong enough to protect us from hafela and
the warrior of the north alreadi he gather hi clan and alreadi
my captain desert to him byandbi in the springtimemai i be dead
befor the dayh will roll down upon us like a flood of water
to fall back like water from a wall of rock answer owen let not
your heart be troubl for my master can protect hi servant and he
will protect you but first you must confess him openli as your son ha
done
nai i am too old to hurri said the king with a sigh your tale
seem full of promis to on who is near the grave but how can i know
that it is more than a dream and shall i abandon the worship of my
father and chang or strive to chang the custom of my peopl to
follow after dream nodwengo ha chosen hi part and i do not blame
him yet for the present i beseech you both to keep silenc on thi
matter lest to save bloodsh i should be driven to side against you
so be it king said owen but i warn you that truth ha a loud
voic and that it is hard to hide the shine of a light in a dark
place nor doe it pleas my lord to be deni by those who confess
him
i am weari repli the old king and thei salut him and went
in obedi to the wish of umsuka hi father the convers of
nodwengo wa kept secret and yetnon knew howth thing leak out
soon the women in their hut and the soldier by their watchfir
whisper it in each other ear that he who wa appoint to be
their futur ruler had becom a servant of the unknown god that he had
forsworn war and all the delight of men that he would take but on
wife and appear befor the armi not in the uniform of a gener but
clad in a white robe and carri not the broad spear but a cross of
wood swiftli the strang stori flew from mouth to mouth yet it wa not
altogeth believ till it chanc that on dai when he wa review a
regiment a soldier who wa drunk with beer openli insult the princ
call him a coward who worship a coward
now men held their breath wait to see thi fool led awai to die by
tortur of the antheap or some other dread doom but the princ onli
answer
soldier you ar drunk therefor i forgiv you your word whether he
whom you blasphem will forgiv you i know not get you gone
the warrior stare and murmur for by those word wittingli or
unwittingli their gener had confess hi faith and that dai thei
made ribald song about him in the camp but on the morrow when thei
learn how that the man whom the princ spare had been seiz by
a lion and taken awai as he sat at night with hi companion in the
bivouac hi mouth full of boast of hi own courag in offer
insult to the princ and the new faith then thei look at each other
askanc and said littl more of the matter doubtless it wa chanc and
yet thi spirit whom the messeng preach wa on of whom it seem
wisest not to speak lightli
but still the troubl grew for by now the witchdoctor with hokosa
at the head of them were frighten for their place and power and
foment it both openli and in secret of the women thei ask what
would becom of them when men were allow to take but on wife of the
head of kraal how thei would grow wealthi when their daughter ceas
to be worth cattl of the councillor and gener how the land could
be protect from it foe when thei were command to lai down the
spear of the soldier whose onli trade wa war how it would pleas
them to till the field like girl dismai took hold of the nation and
although thei were much love there wa open talk of kill or drive
awai the king and nodwengo who favour the white man and of set up
hafela in their place
at length the crisi came and in thi fashion the amasuka like mani
other african tribe had a strang vener for certain varieti
of snake which thei declar to be possess by the spirit of their
ancestor it wa a law among them that if on of these snake enter
a kraal it must not be kill or even driven awai under pain of death
but must be allow to share with the human occup ani hut that
it might select as a result of thi enforc hospit death from
snakebit were numer among the peopl but when thei happen in
a kraal it owner met with littl sympathi for the doctor explain
that the real caus of them wa the anger of some ancestr spirit
toward hi descend now befor john wa despatch to instruct
owen in the languag of the amasuka a certain girl wa seal to him
as hi futur wife and thi girl who dure hi absenc had been
orphan he had marri recent with the approv of owen who at
thi time wa prepar her for baptism on the third morn after hi
marriag john appear befor hi master in the last extrem of grief
and terror
help me messeng he cri for my ancestr spirit ha enter our
hut and bitten my wife as she lai asleep
ar you mad ask owen what is an ancestr spirit and how can it
have bitten your wife
a snake gasp john a green snake of the worst sort
then owen rememb the superstit and snatch blueston and
spirit of wine from hi medicin chest he rush to john hut as it
happen he wa fortun in time with hi remedi and succeed
in save the woman life wherebi hi reput as a doctor and a
magician alreadi great wa consider enlarg
where is the snake he ask when at length she wa out of danger
yonder under the kaross answer john point to a skin rug which
lai in the corner
have you kill it
no messeng answer the man i dare not ala we must live with
the thing here in the hut till it choos to go awai
truli said owen i am asham to think that you who ar a christian
should still believ so horribl a superstit doe your faith teach
you that the soul of men enter into snake
now john hung hi head then snatch a kerri he threw asid the
kaross reveal a great green serpent seven or eight feet long with
furi he fell upon the reptil kill it by repeat blow and hurl
it into the courtyard outsid the hous
behold father he said and judg whether i am still superstiti
then hi counten fell and he ad yet my life must pai for thi
deed for it is an ancient law among us that to harm on of these snake
is death
have no fear said owen a wai will be found out of thi troubl
that afternoon owen heard a great hubbub outsid hi kraal and go to
see what wa the matter he found a parti of the witchdoctor drag
john toward the place of judgment which wa by the king hous
thither he follow to discov that the case wa alreadi in cours of
be open befor the king hi council and a vast audienc of
the peopl hokosa wa the accus in brief and pregnant sentenc
produc the dead snake in proof of hi argument he point out the
enorm of the offenc against the law of the amasuka wherewith the
prison wa charg demand that the man who had kill the hous of
hi ancestr spirit should instantli be put to death
what have you to sai ask the king of john
thi o king repli john that i am a christian and to me that
snake is noth but a noxiou reptil it bit my wife and had it not
been for the medicin of the messeng she would have perish of the
poison therefor i kill it befor it could harm other
it is a fair answer said the king hokosa i think that thi man
should go free
the king will is the law repli hokosa bitterli but if the law
were the king will the decis would be otherwis thi man ha
slain not a snake but that which held the spirit of an ancestor and
for the deed he deserv to die hearken o king for the busi is
larger than it seem how ar we to be govern henceforth ar we to
follow our ancient rule and custom or must we submit ourselv to a
new rule and a new custom i tell you o king that the peopl murmur
thei ar without light thei wander in the dark thei cannot
understand plai with us no more but let us hear the truth that we mai
judg of thi matter
umsuka look at owen but made no repli
i will answer you hokosa said owen for i am the spring of all thi
troubl and at my command that man my discipl kill yonder snake
what is it it is noth but a reptil no human spirit ever dwelt
within it as you imagin in your superstit you ask to hear the
truth dai by dai i have preach it in your ear and you have not
listen though mani among you have listen and understood what is it
that you seek
we seek messeng to be rid of you your fantasi and your religion
and we demand that our king should expel you and restor the ancient
law or fail thi that you should prove your power openli befor us
all your word o king
umsuka thought for a while and answer
thi is my word hokosa i will not drive the messeng from the land
for he is a good man he save my life and there is virtu in hi
teach toward which i myself inclin yet it is just that he should
be ask to prove hi power so that an end mai be put to doubt and all
of us mai learn what god we ar to worship
how can i prove my power ask owen further than i have prove it
alreadi doe hokosa desir to set up hi god against my godth fals
against the true
i do answer the wizard with passion and accord to the issu
let the judgment be let us halt no longer between two opinion let us
becom wholli christian or rest wholli heathen for to be divid is to
be destroi the magic of the messeng is great onc and for all let
us learn if it is more than our magic let us put him and hi doctrin
to the trial by fire
what is the trial by fire ask owen
you have seen someth of it white man but not much thi is the
trial by fire to stand yonder befor the face of the god of thunder
when a great tempest ragesnot such a storm as you saw but a storm
that split the heavensand to come thenc unscath listen i who
am a heavenherd i who know the sign of the weather tell you that
within two dai such a tempest as thi will break upon us then white
man i and my companion will be readi to meet you on the plain take
the cross by which you swear and set it up yonder and stand by it and
with you your convert nodwengo the princ and thi man whom you have
name john if thei dare to go over against you around the symbol of
the god by which we swear will stand i and my compani and we will prai
our god and you shall prai your god then the storm will break upon us
and when it is end we shall learn which of us remain aliv if you and
your cross ar shatter to us will be the victori if we ar laid low
take it for your own your judgment king
again umsuka thought and answer
so be it messeng hear me there is no need for you to accept thi
challeng but if you will not accept it then go from my countri in
peac take with you those who cleav to you if on the other hand
you do accept it these shall be the stake that if you pass the trial
unharm and the firedoctor ar swept awai your creed shall be my
creed and the creed of the land but if the firedoctor prevail against
you then it shall be death or banish to ani who profess that creed
now choos
i have chosen said owen i will meet hokosa and hi compani on the
place of fire whenev he mai appoint but for the other i cannot sai
we will come with you said nodwengo and john with on voic where
you go messeng we will sure follow
chapter x
the second trial by fire
when thi moment discuss wa finish as usual owen preach
befor the king expound the scriptur and take for hi subject
the duti of faith as he went back to hi hut he saw that the snake
which john had kill had been set upon a pole in that part of the
great place which serv as a market and that hundr of nativ were
gather beneath it gesticul and talk excitedli
see the work of hokosa he thought to himself mose set up a serpent
to save the peopl yonder wizard set up on to destroi them
that even owen had no heart for hi labour for hi mind wa heavi
at the prospect of the trial which lai befor him not that he care for
hi own life for of thi he scarc thought it wa the prospect of
hi caus which troubl him it seem much to expect that heaven again
should throw over him the mantl of it especi protect and yet
if it did not do so there wa an end of hi mission among the peopl of
fire well he did not seek thi trialh would have avoid it if
he could but it had been thrust upon him and he wa forc to choos
between it and the abandon of the work which he had undertaken with
such high hope and push so far toward success he did not choos the
path it had been point out to him to walk upon and if it end in a
precipic at least he would have done hi best
as he thought thu john enter the hut pant
what is the matter owen ask
father the peopl saw and pursu me becaus of the death of that
accurs snake had i not run fast and escap them i think thei would
have kill me
at least you have escap john so be comfort and return thank
father said the man present i know that you ar great and can do
mani wonder thing but have you in truth power over lightn
why do you ask
becaus a great tempest is brew and if you have not we shall
certainli be kill when we stand yonder on the place of fire
john he said i cannot speak to the lightn in a voic which it
can hear i cannot sai to it go yonder or come hither but he who
made it can do so why do you tempt me with your doubt have i not
told you the stori of elijah the prophet and the priest of baal did
elijah master forsak him and shall he forsak us also thi is
certain that all the medicin of hokosa and hi wizard will not turn a
lightn flash by the breadth of a singl hair god alon can turn it
and for the sake of hi caus among these peopl i believ that he will
do so
thu owen spoke on till in reprov the weak of anoth he felt
hi own faith come back to him and rememb the past and how he
had been preserv in it the doubt and troubl went out of hi mind to
return no more
the third dayth dai of trialcam for sixti hour or more the
heat of the weather had been intens inde dure all that time the
thermomet in owen hut notwithstand the protect of a thick
hatch had shown the temperatur to vari between a maximum of 113 and a
minimum of 101 degre now in the earli morn it stood at 108
will the storm break todai ask owen of nodwengo who came to visit
him
thei sai so messeng and i think it by the feel of the air if so
it will be a veri great storm for the heaven is full of fire alreadi
hokosa and the doctor ar at their rite upon the plain yonder but
there will be no need to join them till two hour after middai
is the cross readi ask owen
ye and set up it is a heavi cross six men could scarc carri it
oh messeng i am not afraidand yet have you no medicin if not
i fear that the lightn will fall upon the cross as it fell upon the
pole and then
listen nodwengo said owen i know a medicin but i will not us
it you see that waggon chain were on end of it buri in the ground
and the other with a spear blade made fast to it hung to the top of the
cross we could live out the fiercest storm in safeti but i sai that
i will not us it ar we witch doctor that we should take refug in
trick no let faith be our shield and if it fail us then let us die
prai now with me that it mai not fail us
it wa afternoon all round the field of fire were gather thousand
upon thousand of the peopl of the amasuka the new of thi duel
between the god of the white man and their god had travel far and
wide and even the veri ag who could scarc crawl and the littl
on who must be carri were collect there to see the issu nor had
thei need to fear disappoint for alreadi the sky wa half hidden
by dens thundercloud pile ridg on ridg and the hush of the come
tempest lai upon the earth round about the meteor stone which thei
call a god each of them stir a littl gourd of medicin that wa
place upon the ground befor him but utter no word were gather
hokosa and hi follow to the number of twenti thei were all of them
arrai in their snakeskin dress and other wizard fineri also each
man held in hi hand a wand fashion from a human thighbon in front
of the stone burn a littl fire which now and again hokosa fed with
aromat leav at the same time pour medicin from hi bowl upon
the holi stone opposit the symbol of the god but at a good distanc
from it a great cross of white wood wa set up in the rock by a spot
which the witchdoctor themselv had chosen upon the bank of the
stream in the place apart were the king hi councillor and the
regiment on guard and with them owen the princ nodwengo and john
the storm will be fierc said the king uneasili glanc at the
western sky upon whose bosom the blue lightn plai with an
incess flicker then he bade those about him stand back and call
owen and the princ to him said messeng my son tell me that your
wisdom know a plan wherebi you mai be preserv from the furi of the
tempest us it i prai of you messeng that your life mai be save
and with it the life of the onli son who is left to me
i cannot answer owen for thu by doubt him i should tempt my

it is well spoken said the king be it as you will
now the compani of wizard leav their medicinepot upon the ground
form themselv in a trebl line and march to where the king
stood thei salut him then thei sang the prais of their god and in
a song that had been prepar heap insult upon the god of the

vast audienc thei march back to their station still sing the
blasphem mock song
now to the west all the heaven were black as night though the
eastern sky still show blue and cloudless natur lai oppress with
silencesil intens and unnatur and so great wa the heat that
the air danc visibl abov the ironston as it danc about a glow
stove suddenli the quietud wa broken by a moan sound of wind
the grass stir the leav of the tree began to shiver and an ici
breath beat upon owen brow
let us be go he said and lift the ivori crucifix abov hi
head he pass the stream and walk toward the wooden cross after
him came the princ nodwengo wear hi royal dress of leopard skin
and after him john arrai in a linen robe
as the littl process appear to their view some of the soldier
began to mock but almost instantli the laughter di awai rude as
thei were these savag understood that here wa no occas for their
mirth that the three men inde seem cloth with a curiou digniti
perhap it wa their slow and quiet gait perhap a sens of the errand
upon which thei were bound or it mai have been the strang unearthli
light that fell upon them from over the edg of the storm cloud at the
least as the multitud becam awar their appear wa impress
thei reach the cross and took up their station there owen in front
of it nodwengo to the right and john to the left
now a sharp squall of strong wind swept across the space and with it
came a flaw of rain it pass by and the storm that had been mutter
and growl in the distanc began to burst the great cloud seem to
grow and swell and from the breast of them swift lightn leapt to
be met by other lightn rush upward from the earth the air wa
fill with a tumult of uncertain wind and a hiss as of distant rain
then the batteri of thunder were open and the world shook with
their volum down from on high the flash fell blind and incess
and by the light of them the firedoctor could be seen run to and
fro point now here and now there with their wand of human bone
and pour the medicin from their gourd upon the ground and upon
each other owen and hi two companion could be seen also stand
quietli with clasp hand while abov them tower the tall white
cross
at length the storm wa straight over head slowli it advanc in
it aweinspir might as flash after flash each more fantast and
horribl than the last smote upon the floor of ironston it plai
about the shape of the doctor who in the midst of it look like
devil in an inferno it crept onward toward the station of the cross
butit never reach the cross
on flash struck inde within fifti pace of where owen stood then of
a sudden a marvel happen or someth which to thi dai the peopl of
fire talk of as a marvel for in an instant the rain began to pour like
a wall of water stretch from earth to heaven and the wind chang
it had been blow from the west now it blew from the east with the
forc of a gale
it blew and roll the tempest back upon itself caus it to return
to the region whenc it had gather at the veri foot of the cross
it march wa stai there wa the waterlin as straight as if it had
been drawn with a rule the thundercloud that were press forward met
the cloud that were press back and togeth thei seem to come
to earth fill the air with a gloom so dens that the ey could not
pierc it to the west wa a wall of black tower to the heaven
to the east light blue and unholi gleam upon the white cross and
the figur of it watcher
for some secondstwenti or morether wa a lull and then it
seem as though all hell had broken loos upon the world the wall of
black becam a wall of flame in which strang and ardent shape
appear ascend and descend the thunder bellow till the
mountain rock and in on last blaze aw and indescrib the
ski melt into a delug of fire in the flare of it owen thought that
he saw the figur of men fall thi wai and that then he stagger
against the cross for support and hi sens fail him
when thei return again he perceiv the storm be drawn back from
the face of the pale earth like a pall from the face of the dead and he
heard a murmur of fear and wonder rise from ten thousand throat
well might thei fear and wonder for of the twenti and on wizard
eleven were dead four were paralys by shock five were fly in
their terror and on hokosa himself stood stare at the fallen a
veri pictur of despair nor wa thi all for the meteor stone with a
human shape which for gener the peopl of fire had worship as a
god lai upon the plain in fuse and shatter fragment
the peopl saw and a sound as of a hollow groan of terror went up from
them then thei were silent for a while owen and hi companion were
silent also sinc their heart were too full for speech then he
said
as the snake fell harmless from the hand of paul so ha the lightn
turn back from me who strive to follow in hi footstep work
death and dismai among those who would have harm us mai forgiv
be their who were without understand brethren let us return and
make report to the king
now as thei had come so thei went back first owen with the crucifix
next to him nodwengo and last of the three john thei drew near to the
king when suddenli move by a common impuls the thousand of the
peopl upon the bank of the stream with on accord threw themselv
upon their knee befor owen call him god and offer him worship
infect by the contagion umsuka hi guard and hi councillor

chapter xi
the wisdom of the dead
on the morrow owen baptis the king mani of hi councillor and
some twenti other whom he consid fit to receiv the rite also he
despatch hi first convert john with other messeng on a three
month journei to the coast give them letter acquaint the bishop
and other with hi marvel success and prai that missionari
might be sent to assist him in hi labour
now dai by dai the church grew till it number hundr of soul and
thousand more hover on it threshold from dawn to dark owen toil
preach exhort confess gather in hi harvest and from
dark to midnight he pore over hi translat of the scriptur
teach nodwengo and a few other how to read and write them but
although hi effort were crown with so signal and extraordinari a
triumph he wa well awar of the danger that threaten the life of
the infant church mani accept it inde and still more toler
it but there remain multitud who regard the new religion with
suspicion and veil hatr nor wa thi strang see that the
heart of men ar not chang in an hour or their ancient custom easili
overset
on on point inde owen had to give wai the amasuka were a
polygam peopl all their law and tradit were interwoven with
polygami and to abolish that institut suddenli and with violenc
would have brought their social fabric to the ground now as he knew
well the missionari church declar in effect that no man can be both a
christian and a polygamist therefor among the follow of that custom
the missionari church make but littl progress not without mani qualm
and hesit owen have onli the scriptur to consult came to a
compromis with hi convert if a man alreadi marri to more than on
wife wish to becom a christian he permit him to do so upon the
condit that he took no more wive while a man unmarri at the time
of hi convers might take on wife onli thi decre liber as it
wa caus great dissatisfact among both men and women but it wa
as noth compar to the feel that wa evok by owen preach
against all war not undertaken in selfdef and against the strict
law which he prevail upon the king to pass suppress the practic
of wizardri and declar the chief or doctor who caus a man to
be smelt out and kill upon charg of witchcraft to be guilti of
murder
at first whenev owen went abroad he wa surround by thousand of
peopl who follow him in the expect that he would work miracl
which after hi exploit with the lightn thei were well persuad
that he could do if he chose but he work no more miracl he onli
preach to them a doctrin advers to their custom and foreign to
their thought
so it came about that in time when the novelti wa gone off and the
stori of hi victori over the firegod had grown stale although the
work of convers went on steadili mani of the peopl grew weari of
the white man and hi doctrin soon thi weari found express in
variou wai and in none more markedli than by the constant desert
from the rank of the king regiment at first by owen advic
the king toler these desert but at length have obtain
inform that an entir regiment purpos abscond at dawn
he caus it to be surround and seiz by night next morn he
address that regiment sai
soldier you think that becaus i have becom a christian and will not
permit unnecessari bloodsh i am also becom a fool i will teach
you otherwis on man in everi twenti of you shall be kill and
henceforth ani soldier who attempt to desert will be kill also
the order wa carri out for owen could not find a word to sai against
it with the result that desert almost ceas though not befor the
king had lost some eight or nine thousand of hi best soldier worst of
all these soldier had gone to join hafela in hi mountain fast
and the rumour grew that er long thei would appear again to claim the
crown for him or to take it by forc of arm
now too a fresh complic aros the old king sicken of hi last
ill and soon it becam known that he must die a month later die
he did pass awai peacefulli in owen arm and with hi last
breath exhort hi peopl to cling to the christian religion to take
nodwengo for their king and to be faith to him
the king di and that same dai wa buri by owen in the gloomi
restingplac of the bloodroy of the peopl of fire where a
christian priest now set foot for the first time
on the morrow nodwengo wa proclaim king with much ceremoni in face of
the peopl and of all the armi that remain to him on captain rais
a cry for hafela hi brother nodwengo caus him to be seiz and
brought befor him
man he said on thi my coron dai i will not stain my hand with
blood listen you cry upon hafela and to hafela you shall go take
him thi messag tell him that i nodwengo have succeed to the crown
of umsuka my father by hi will and the will of the peopl tell him
it is true that i have becom a christian and that christian follow
not after war but peac tell him howev that though i am a christian
i have not forgotten how to fight or how to rule it ha reach my
ear that it is hi purpos to attack me with a great forc which he is
gather and to possess himself of my throne if he should choos to
come i shall be readi to meet him but i counsel him against come
for it will be to find hi death let him stai where he is in peac and
be my subject or let him go afar with those that cleav to him and set
up a kingdom of hi own for then i shall not follow him but let him
not dare to lift a spear against me hi sovereign sinc if he doe so
he shall be treat as a rebel and find the doom of a rebel begon and
show your face here no more
the man crept awai crestfallen but all who heard that speech broke into
cheer which as it purport wa repeat from rank to rank spread
far and wide for now the armi learn that in becom a christian
nodwengo had not becom a woman of thi inde he soon gave them ampl
proof the old king grip upon thing had been lax that of nodwengo
wa like iron he practis no cruelti and did injustic to none
but hi disciplin wa sever and soon the regiment were brought to a
greater pitch of profici than thei had ever reach befor although
thei were now allow to marri when thei pleas a boon that hitherto
had been deni to them moreov by owen help he design an
entir new system of fortif of the kraal and surround hill
which would it wa thought make the place impregn these and mani
other act equal vigor and farse put new heart into the
nation also the report of them put fear into hafela who it wa
rumour had now given up all idea of attack
some there were howev who look upon these chang with littl
love and hokosa wa on of them after hi defeat in the duel by fire
for a while hi spirit wa crush hitherto he had more or less been
a believ in the protect influenc of hi own god or fetish who
would as he thought hold hi priest scatheless from the lightn
often and often had he stood in past dai upon that plain while the
great tempest broke around hi head and return thenc unharm
attribut to sorceri a safeti that wa realli due to chanc from time
to time inde a priest wa kill but so hi companion held the
misfortun result invari from the man neglect of some rite or
wa a mark of the anger of the heaven
now hokosa had live to see all these convict shatter he had seen
the lightn which he pretend to be abl to control roll back
upon him from the foot of the christian cross reduc hi god to
nothing and hi companion to corps
at first hokosa wa dismai but as time went on hope came back to him
strip of hi offic and power and from the greatest in the nation
after the king becom on of small account still no harm or violenc
wa attempt toward him he wa left wealthi and in peac and live
thu he watch and listen with open ey and ear wait till the
tide should turn it seem that he would not have long to wait for
reason that have been told
why do you sit here like a vultur on a rock ask the girl noma
whom he had taken to wife when you might be yonder with hafela
prepar him by your wisdom for the come war
becaus i am a kingvultur and i wait for the sick bull to die he
answer point to the great place beneath him sai why should i
bring hafela to prei upon a carcas i have mark down for my own
now you speak well said noma the bull suffer from a strang
diseas and when he is dead anoth must lead the herd
that is so answer her husband and therefor i am patient
it wa shortli after thi convers that the old king di with
result veri differ from those which hokosa had anticip although
he wa a christian to hi surpris nodwengo show that he wa also a
strong ruler and that there wa littl chanc of the sceptr slip
from hi handnon inde while the white teacher wa there to guid
him
what will you do now hokosa ask noma hi wife upon a certain dai
will you turn to hafela after all
no answer hokosa i will consult my ancient lore listen whatev
els is fals thi is true that magic exist and i am it master for
a while it seem to me that the white man wa greater at the art than i
am but of late i have watch him and listen to hi doctrin and i
believ that thi is not so it is true that in the begin he read my
plan in a dream or otherwis it is true that he hurl the lightn
back upon my head but i hold that these thing were accid again
and again he ha told us that he is not a wizard and if thi be so he
can be overcom
how husband
how by wizardri thi veri night noma with your help i will consult
the dead as i have done in bygon time and learn the futur from their
lip which cannot lie
so be it though the task is hate to me and i hate you who forc me
to it
noma answer thu with passion but her ey shone as she spoke for
those who have onc tast the cup of magic ar ever drawn to drink of
it again even when thei fear the draught
it wa midnight and hokosa with hi wife stood in the buryingground of
the king of the amasuka befor owen came upon hi mission it wa death
to visit thi spot except upon the occas of the lai to rest of on
of the royal blood or to offer the annual sacrific to the spirit
of the dead even beneath the bright moon that shone upon it the place
seem terribl here in the bosom of the hill wa an amphitheatr
surround by wall of rock vari from five hundr to a thousand feet
in height in thi amphitheatr grew great mimosa thorn and abov
them tower pillar of granit set there not by the hand of man but by
natur it would seem that the amasuka led by some fine instinct had
chosen these column as fit memori of their king at the least a
depart monarch lai at the foot of each of them
the smallest of these unhewn obelisksit wa about fifti feet
highmark the restingplac of umsuka and deep into it granit
owen with hi own hand had cut the dead king name and date of death
surmount hi inscript with a symbol of the cross
toward thi pillar hokosa made hi wai through the wet grass follow
by noma hi wife present thei were there stand on upon each
side of a littl mound of earth more like an antheap than a grave for
after the custom of hi peopl umsuka had been buri sit at the
foot of each of the pillar rose a heap of similar shape but mani
time as larg the king who slept there were accompani to their
restingplac by number of their wive and servant who had
been slain in solemn sacrific that thei might attend their lord
whithersoev he should wander
what is that you desir and would do ask noma in a hush voic

cross
it ha no power he said mai it be accurs and mai he who believ
therein hang thereon it ha no power but even if it had accord to

i know it and it is to that i trust the woman answer now begin
befor my courag leav me
good he said seat yourself there upon the mound rest your head
against the stone
she obei and take thong of hide which he had made readi hokosa
bound her wrist and ankl as these peopl bind the wrist and ankl
of corps then he knelt befor her stare into her face with hi
solemn ey and mutter obei and sleep
present her limb relax and her head fell forward
do you sleep he ask
i sleep whither shall i go it is the true sleeptest me
pass to the hous of the white man my rival ar you with him
i am with him
what doe he
he li in slumber on hi bed and in hi slumber he mutter the name
of a woman and tell her that he love her but that duti is more than
love oh call me back i cannot stai a presenc guard him and thrust
me thenc
return said hokosa start pass through the earth beneath you and
tell me what you see
i see the bodi of the king but were it not for hi royal ornament
none would know him now
return said hokosa and let the ey of your spirit be open look
around you and tell me what you see
i see the shadow of the dead she answer thei stand about you
gaze at you with angri ey but when thei come near you someth
drive them back and i cannot understand what it is thei sai
is the ghost of umsuka among them
it is among them
bid him prophesi the futur to me
i have bidden him but he doe not answer if you would hear him
speak it must be through the lip of my bodi and first my bodi must be
empti of my ghost that hi mai find a place therein
sai can hi spirit be compel
it can be compel or that part of it which still hover near thi
spot if you dare to speak the word you know but first it hous
must be made readi then the word must be spoken and all must be done
befor a man can count three hundr for should the blood begin to clot
about my heart it will be still for ever
hearken said hokosa when the medicin that i shall give doe it
work and the spirit is loosen from your bodi let it not go afar no
whatev tempt or threaten it and suffer not that the deathcord be
sever lest flesh and ghost be part for ever
i hear and i obei be swift for i grow weari
then hokosa took from hi pouch two medicin on a past in a box the
other a fluid in a gourd take of the past he knelt upon the grave
befor the entranc woman and swiftli smear it upon the mucou
membran of the mouth and throat also he thrust pellet of it into the
ear the nostril and the corner of the ey
the effect wa almost instantan a chang came over the girl
love face the last aw chang of death her cheek fell in her
chin drop her ey open and her flesh quiver convuls the
wizard saw it all by the bright moonlight then he took up hi part in
thi unholi drama
all that he did cannot be describ becaus it is indescrib the
witch of endor repeat no formula but she rais the dead and so did
hokosa the wizard but he buri hi face in the grei dust of the grave
he blew with hi lip into the dust he clutch at the dust with hi
hand and when he rais hi face again lo it wa grei like the
dust now began the marvel for though the woman befor him remain a
corps from the lip of that corps a voic issu and it sound
wa horribl for the accent and tone of it were masculin and the
instrument through which it spokenoma throatwa feminin yet it
could be recognis as the voic of umsuka the dead king
why have you summon me from my rest hokosa mutter the voic from
the lip of the huddl corps
becaus i would learn the futur spirit of the king answer the
wizard boldli but salut as he spoke you ar dead and to your
sight all the gate ar open by the power that i have i command you
to show me what you see therein concern myself and to point out to
me the path that i should follow to attain my end and the end of her
in whose breast you dwell
at onc the answer came alwai in the same horribl voic
hearken to your fate for thi world hokosa the wizard you shall
triumph over your rival the white man the messeng and by your hand
he shall perish pass to hi appoint place where you must meet
again by that to which you cling you shall be betrai ah you shall
lose that which you love and follow after that which you do not desir
in the grave of error you shall find truth from the deep of sin you
shall pluck righteous when these word fall upon your ear again
then wizard take them for a sign and let your heart be turn that
which you deem accurs shall lift you up on high high shall you be
set abov the nation and it king and from ag to ag the voic of the
peopl shall prais you yet in the end come judgment and there shall
the sin and the aton strive togeth and in that hour wizard you
shall
thu the voic spoke strongli at first but grow ever more feebl as
the spark of life depart from the bodi of the woman till at length
it ceas altogeth
what shall chanc to me in that hour hokosa ask eagerli place
hi ear against noma lip
no answer came and the wizard knew that if he would drag hi wife back
from the door of death he must delai no longer dash the sweat from
hi ey with on hand with the other he seiz the gourd of fluid
that he had place readi and thrust back her head he pour of it
content down her throat and wait a while she did not move in an
extrem of terror he snatch a knife and with a singl cut sever
a vein in her arm then take some of the fluid that remain in the
gourd in hi hand he rub it roughli upon her brow and throat and
heart now noma finger stir and now with horribl contort
and everi symptom of agoni life return to her the blood flow from
her wound arm slowli at first then more fast and lift her head
she spoke
take me henc she cri or i shall go mad for i have seen and
heard thing too terribl to be spoken
what have you seen and heard he ask while he cut the thong which
bound her wrist and feet
i do not know noma answer weep the vision of them pass
from me but all the distanc of death were open to my sight ye i
travel through the distanc of death in them i met him who wa the
king and he lai cold within me speak to my heart and as he pass
from me he look upon the child which i shall bear and curs it and
sure accurs it shall be take me henc o you most evil man for of
your magic i have had enough and from thi dai forth i am haunt
have no fear answer hokosa you have made the journei whenc but
few return and yet as i promis you you have return to wear the
great you desir and that i sent you forth to win for henceforth
we shall be great look the dawn is breakingth dawn of life and the
dawn of powerand the mist of death and of disgrac roll back befor
us now the path is clear the dead have shown it to me and of wizardri
i shall need no more
ay answer noma but night follow dawn as the dawn follow
night and through the dark and the daylight i tell you wizard
henceforth i am haunt also be not so sure for though i know not
what the dead have spoken to you yet it linger on my mind that their
word have mani mean nai speak to me no more but let us fly from
thi dread home of ghost thi habit of the spiritfolk which we
have violat
so the wizard and hi wife crept from that solemn place and as thei
went thei saw the dawnbeam light upon the white cross that wa
rear in the plain of fire
chapter xii
the messag of hokosa
the week pass by and hokosa sat in hi kraal weav a great plot
none suspect him ani more for though he did not belong to it he wa
heard to speak well of the new faith and to acknowledg that the god of
fire which he had worship wa a fals god he wa humbl also toward
the king but he crave to withdraw himself from all matter of the
state sai that now he had but on desireto tend hi herd and
garden and to grow old in peac with the new wife whom he had chosen
and whom he love owen too he greet courteous when he met him
send him gift of corn and cattl for the servic of hi church
moreov when a messeng came from hafela make propos to him he
drove him awai and laid the matter befor the council of the king yet
that messeng who wa hunt from the kraal took back a secret word
for hafela ear
it is not alwai winter wa the word and it mai chanc that in
the springtim you shall hear from me and again sai to the princ
hafela that though my face toward him is like a storm yet behind the
cloud the sun shine ever
at length there came a dai when noma hi wife wa brought to bed
hokosa her husband tend her alon and when the child wa born
he groan aloud and would not suffer her to look upon it face yet
lift herself she saw
did i not tell you it wa accurs she wail take it awai and

messag in hi ear
these ar the word of hokosa my husband which he ha set in my
mouth to deliv to you o princ be guid by them and grow great

in our land the gener of the armi the captain of the council the
head of the doctor and that to him shall be given half the cattl of
nodwengo who now is king also to him shall be given power to stamp out
the new faith which overrun the land like a foreign weed and to deal
as he think fit with those who cling thereto

upon hi own head should he break on word of it and not befor you
shall continu the messag thu these ar the other word that hokosa
set in my mouth know o princ that the king your brother grow
veri strong for he is a great soldier who learn hi art in bygon
war also the white man that is name messeng ha taught him mani
thing as to the build of fort and wall and the drill and
disciplin of men so strong is he that you can scarc hope to conquer
him in open waryet snake mai crawl where men cannot walk therefor
princ let your part be that of a snake do you send an embassi to the
king your brother and sai to him
my brother you have been prefer befor me and set up to be king in
my place and becaus of thi my heart is bitter so bitter that i have
gather my strength to make war upon you yet at the last i have
taken anoth council bethink me that if we fight in the end it
mai chanc that neither of us will be left aliv to rule and that the
peopl also will be brought to noth to the north there li a good
countri and a wide where but few men live and thither i would go
set the mountain and the river between us for there far beyond
your border i also can be a king now to reach thi countri i must
travel by the pass that is not far from your great place and i prai
you that you will not attack my impi or the women and children that i
shall send and a guard befor them to await me in the plain beyond the
mountain see that these can onli journei slowli let us pass by in
peac my brother for so shall our quarrel be end but if you do so
much as lift a singl spear against me then i will give you battl
set my fortun against your fortun and my god against your god
such ar the word that the embassi shall deliv into the ear of
the king nodwengo and it shall come about that when he hear them
nodwengo whose heart is gentl and who seek not war shall answer
softli sai
go in peac my brother and live in peac in that land which you
would win
then shall you hafela send on the most of your cattl and the women
and the children through that pass in the mountain bid them to
await you in the plain and after a while you shall follow them with
your impi but these shall not travel in war arrai for carrier must
bear their fight shield in bundl and their stab spear shall
be roll up in mat now on the sixth dai of your journei you shall
camp at the mouth of the pass which the cattl and the women have
alreadi travel and hi outpost and spi will bring it to the ear
of the king that your forc is sleep there purpos to climb the
pass on the morrow
but on that night so soon as the dark fall you must rise up with
your captain and your regiment leav your fire burn and men
about your fire and shall travel veri swiftli across the vallei so
that an hour befor the dawn you reach the second rang of mountain
and pass it by the gorg which is the buryingplac of king here you
shall light a fire which those who watch will believ to be but the
fire of a herdsman who is acold but i hokosa also shall be watch
and when i see that fire i will creep with some whom i can trust to
the littl northern gate of the outer wall and we will spear those
that guard it and open the gate that your armi mai pass through then
befor the regiment can stand to their arm or those within it ar
awaken you must storm the inner wall and by the light of the burn
hut put the dweller in the great place to the spear and the rai of

follow thi counsel of mine o princ hafela and all will go well
with you neglect it and be lost there is but on thing which you need
fearit is the magic of the messeng to whom it is given to read the
secret thought of men but of him take no account for he is my charg

the marketplac or into the ear of king ask hokosa have i not
told you that befor i see the signalfir yonder the messeng shall
sleep sound i have a medicin noma a slow medicin that none can
trace

on hi messag to anoth and with it hi magic who can sai still
husband strike on for power and great and reveng let the blow
fall where it will

the basket of fruit
three dai later it wa announc that accord to the custom of the
women of the peopl of fire noma have given birth to a stillborn
child wa about to start upon a journei to the mount of purif
here she would abid awhil and make sacrific to the spirit of her
ancestor that thei might ceas to be angri with her and in futur
protect her from such misfortun thi not unusu domest incid
excit littl comment although it wa remark that the four matron
by whom she wa to be accompani in accord with the tribal
etiquett were all of them the wive of soldier who had desert to
hafela inde the king himself notic as much when hokosa made the
customari formal applic to him to sanction the expedit
so be it he said though myself i have lost faith in such rite
also hokosa i think it like that although your wife goe out with
compani she will return alon
why king ask hokosa
for thi reasonthat those who travel with her have husband yonder at
the town of the princ hafela and the mount of purif is on the
road thither have gone so far thei mai go farther well let
them go for i desir to have none among my peopl whose heart turn
otherwher and it would not be wonder if thei should choos to seek
their lord but perchanc hokosa there ar some in thi town who mai
us them as messeng to the princeand he look at him keenli
i think not king said hokosa none but a fool would make us of
women to carri secret word or tide their tongu ar too long and
their memori too bad or too uncertain
yet i have heard hokosa that you have made us of women in mani a
strang work sai now what were you do upon a night a while ago
with that fair witchwif if your yonder in the buryingplac of king
where it is not law that you should set your foot nai deni it not
you were seen to enter the vallei after midnight and to return thenc
at the dawn and it wa seen also that as she came homeward your wife
walk as on who is drunken and she whom it is not easi to frighten
wore a face of fear man i do not trust you and were i wise i should
hunt you henc or keep you so close that you could scarc move
without my knowledg
why should i trust you nodwengo went on vehement can a wizard
ceas from wizardri or a plotter from hi plot no not until the
water run upward and the sun shine at night not until repent
touch you and your heart is chang which i should hold as much a
marvel you were my father friend and he made you great yet you could
plan with my brother to poison him your king nai be silent i know
it though i have said noth of it becaus on that is dear to me ha
interced for you you were the priest of the fals god and with that
god ar fallen from your place yet you have not renounc him you sit
still in your kraal and pretend to be asleep but your slumber is that
of the serpent which watch hi time to strike how do i know that
you will not poison me as you would have poison my father or stir up
rebellion against me or bring my brother impi on my head
if the king think ani of these thing of hi servant answer hokosa
in a humbl voic but with digniti hi path is plain let him put me
to death and sleep in peac who am i that i should full the ear of
a king with my defenc against these charg or dare to wrangl with
him
long ago i should have put you to death hokosa answer nodwengo
sternli had it not been that on ha plead for you declar that
in you there is good which will overcom the evil and that you who now
ar an ax to cut down my throne in time to come shall be a rooftre
for it support also the law that i obei doe not allow me to take
the blood of men save upon full proof and against you as yet i have
no proof still hokosa be warn in time and let your heart be turn
befor the grave claim your bodi and the wick on your soul
i thank you king for your gentl word and your tender care for my
wellb both on earth and after i shall leav it but i tell you
king that i had rather die as your father would have kill me in the
old dai or your brother would kill me now did either of them hate or
fear me than live on in safeti ow my life to a new law and a new
merci that do not befit the great on of the world king i am your
servant and give him the royal salut hokosa rose and left hi
presenc
at the least there goe a man said nodwengo as he watch him
depart
of whom do you speak king ask owen who at that moment enter the
royal hous
of him whom you must have touch in the doorwai messeng hokosa
the wizard answer the king and he told him of what had pass
between them i said he ad that he wa a man and so he is yet
i hold that i have done wrong to listen to your plead and to spare
him for i am certain that he will bring bloodsh upon me and troubl
on the faith think now messeng how full must be that man heart of
secret rage and hatr he who wa so great and is now so littl will
he not certainli strive to grow great again will he not strive to be
aveng upon those who humbl him and the religion thei have chosen
it mai be answer owen but if so he will not conquer i tell
you king that like water hidden in a rock there is good in thi man
heart and that i shall yet find a rod wherewith to caus it to gush out
and refresh the desert
it is more like that he will find a spear wherewith to caus your
blood to gush out and refresh the jackal answer the king grimli
but be it as you will and now what of your busi
thi king john my servant ha return from the coast countri
and he bring me a letter sai that befor long three white teacher
will follow him to take up the work which i have begun i prai that when
thei come for my sake and for the sake of the truth that i have taught
you you will treat them kindli and protect them rememb that at
first thei can know littl of your languag or your custom
i will inde said the king with much concern but tell me
messeng why do you speak of yourself as of on who soon will be but a
memori do you purpos to leav us
no king but i believ that er long i shall be recal i have given
my messag my task is wellnigh end and i must be turn home save
for your sake i do not sorrow at thi for to speak truth i grow veri
weari and he smile sadli
hokosa went home alarm and full of bitter for he had never
guess that the servant of the messeng as he call nodwengo the
king knew so much about him and hi plan hi fall wa hard to him
but to be thu measur up weigh and contemptu forgiven wa
almost more than he could bear it wa the white prophet who had done
thi thing he had told nodwengo of hi hokosa share in the plot to
murder the late king umsuka though how he came to know of that matter
wa beyond guess he had watch him or caus him to be watch
when he went forth to consult spirit in the place of the dead he had
warn nodwengo against him worst of all he had dare to treat him
with contempt had plead for hi life and safeti so that he wa
spare as men spare a snake from which the charmer ha drawn the fang
when thei met in the gate of the king hous yonder thi white thief
who had stolen hi place and power had even smile upon him and greet
him kindli and doubtless while he smile by aid of the magic he
possess had read him through and gone on to tell the stori to the
king well of thi there should be an end he would kill the messeng
or himself be kill
when hokosa reach hi kraal he found noma sit beneath a fruit tree
that grew in it idli emploi in string bead for the work of the
household she left to hi other wife zinti an old and home woman who
thought more of the brew of the beer and the boil of the porridg
than of religion or polit or of the will of king of late noma had
haunt the shadow of thi tree for beneath it lai that child which had
been born to her
doe it pleas the king to grant leav for my journei she ask
look up
ye it pleas him
i am thank she answer for i think that if i bide here much
longer with ghost and memori for compani i shall go mad and
she glanc at a spot near by where the earth show sign of recent
disturb
he give leav hokosa went on take no notic of her speech but
he suspect us listen and he told her of the talk that had pass
between himself and the king
the white man ha read you as he read in hi written book she
answer with a littl laugh well i said that he would be too clever
for you did i not it doe not matter to me for tomorrow i go upon my
journei and you can settl it as you will
ay answer hokosa grind hi teeth it is true that he ha read
me but thi i promis you that all book shall soon be close to him
yet how is it to be done without suspicion or discoveri i know mani
poison but all of them must be administ and let him work never so
cunningli he who give a poison can be trace
then caus some other to give it and let him bear the blame suggest
noma languidli
hokosa made no answer but walk to the gate of the kraal which wa
open he lean against it lost in thought as he stood thu he saw a
woman advanc toward him who carri on her head a small basket of
fruit and knew her for on of those whose busi it wa to wait upon
the messeng in hi hut or rather in hi hous for by now he had
built himself a small hous and near it a chapel thi woman saw hokosa
also and look at him sidewai as though she would like to stop and
speak to him but fear to do so
good morrow to you friend he said how goe it with your husband

her and driven her from hi home fill her place with on younger and
more attract at the question the woman lip began to trembl and

desert her and who come to seek my counsel bring her milk to
drink
there ar some wive who would not find that so great an evil repli

and yet at time thei ar the best master wrinkl and smooth skin
seem strang upon on pillow she ad glanc at noma who came
from the hut carri a bowl of milk in her hand
if you seek counsel said hokosa quickli why do you not go to the
white man that messeng in whom you believ and ask him for a potion
to turn your husband heart
master i have been to him and he is veri good to me for when i wa
driven out he gave me work to do and food but he told me that he had no
medicin for such case and that the great man in the sky alon could
soften the breast of my husband and caus my sister to ceas from her
wicked last night i went to see whether he would do it and you
know what befel me there
that befel you which befal all fool who put their trust in word

ala master i am poor i have noth to offer you for when i would
not stai in my husband kraal to be a servant to hi new wife he took
the cow and the five goat that belong to me as i be childless

chapter xiv
the eat of the fruit
the woman slip awai secretli when she had gone hokosa bade hi wife
bring the basket of fruit into the hut
it is best that the butcher should kill the ox himself she answer
meaningli
he carri in the basket and set it on the floor
why do you speak thu noma he ask
becaus i will have no hand in the matter hokosa i have been the tool
of a wizard and won littl joi therefrom the tool of a murder i will
not be
if i kill it is for the sake of both of us he said passion
it mai be so hokosa or for the sake of the peopl or for the sake
of heaven abovei do not know and do not care but i sai do your own
kill for i am sure that even less luck will hang to it than hang to
your witchcraft
of all women you ar the most pervers he said stamp hi foot
upon the ground
thu you mai sai again befor everyth is done husband but if it
be so why do you love me and tie me to you with your wizardri cut the
knot and let me go my wai while you go your
woman i cannot but still i bid you bewar for strive as you will
my path must be your path moreov till i free you you cannot lift
voic or hand against me
then while she watch him curious hokosa fetch hi medicin and
took from them some powder fine as dust and two tini crowquil place
a fruit befor him he insert on of these quill into it substanc
and fill the second with the powder he shook it content into it
and withdrew the tube thi process he repeat four time on each of
the fruit replac them on by on in the basket so deftli did he
work upon them that howev close thei were scan none could guess
that thei had been tamper with
will it kill at onc ask noma
no inde but he who eat these fruit will be seiz on the third
dai with dysenteri and fever and these will cling to him till within
seven weeksor if he is veri strong three monthsh di thi is the
best of poison for it work through natur and can be trace by none
except perchanc by that spirit whom the white man worship and who
also work through natur as you learn hokosa when he roll the
lightn back upon your head shatter your god and beat down your
compani
then of a sudden terror seiz the wizard and spring to hi feet he
curs hi wife till she trembl befor him
vile woman and doublefac he said why do you push me forward
with on hand and with the other drag me back why do you whisper evil
counsel into on ear and into the other prophesi of misfortun to come
had it not been for you i should have let thi busi lie i should
have taken my fate and been content but dai by dai you have taunt me
with my fall and griev over the great that you have lost till
at length you have driven me to thi why cannot you be all good or all
wick or at the least through righteous and sin faith to my
interest and your own
becaus i hate you hokosa and yet can strike you onli through my
tongu and your mad love for me i am fast in your power but thu at
least i can make you feel someth of my own pain hark i hear that
woman at the gate will you give her back the basket or will you not
whatev you mai choos to do do not sai in after dai that i urg you
to the deed
truli you ar greatheart he answer with cold contempt on for
whom i did well to enter into treacheri and sin so be it have gone
so far upon it come what mai i will not turn back from thi journei
let in that fool
present the woman stood befor them bear with her anoth basket
of fruit
these ar what you seek master she said though i wa forc to win
them by theft now give me my own and the medicin and let me go
he gave her the basket and with it wrap in a piec of kidskin some
of the same powder with which he had doctor the fruit
what shall i do with thi she ask
you must find mean to sprinkl it upon your sister food and
thereaft your husband shall come to hate even the sight of her
but will he come to love me again
hokosa shrug hi shoulder
i know not he answer that is for you to see to yet thi is sure
that if a tree grow up befor the hous of a man shut it off from
the sunlight when that tree is cut down the sun shine upon hi hous
again
it is noth to the sun on what he shine said the woman
if the sai doe not pleas you then forget it i promis you thi
and no more that veri soon the man shall ceas to turn to your rival
the medicin will not harm her ask the woman doubtfulli she ha
work me bitter wrong inde yet she is my sister whom i nurs
when she wa littl and i do not wish to do her hurt if onli he will
welcom me back and treat me kindli i am will even that she should
dwell on beneath my husband roof bear hi children for will thei
not be of my own blood
woman answer hokosa impati you weari me with your talk did
i sai that the charm would hurt her i said that it would caus your
husband to hate the sight of her now begon take or leav it and
let me rest if your mind is troubl throw asid that medicin and go
sooth it with such sight as you saw last night
on hear thi the woman sprang up hid awai the poison in her hair
and take her basket of fruit pass from the kraal as secretli as she
had enter it
why did you give her deathmedicin ask noma of hokosa as he stood
stare after her have you a hate to satisfi against the husband or
the girl who is her rival
none he answer for thei have never cross my path oh foolish
woman cannot you read my plan
not altogeth husband
listen then thi woman will give to her sister a medicin of which in
the end she must die she mai be discov or she mai not but it is
certain that she will be suspect see that the bitter of the
quarrel between them is known also she will give to the messeng
certain fruit after eat of which he will be taken sick and in due
time die of just such a diseas as that which carri off the woman
rival now if ani think that he is poison which i trust none will
whom will thei suppos to have poison him though inde thei can
never prove the crime
the plan is clever said noma with admir but in it i see a
flaw the woman will sai that she had the drug from you or at the
least will babbl of her visit to you
not so answer hokosa for on thi matter the greatest talker in
the world would keep silenc firstli she be a christian dare not
own that she ha visit a witchdoctor secondli the fruit she brought
in payment wa stolen therefor she will sai noth of it thirdli
to admit that she had medicin from me would be to admit her guilt and
that she will scarc do even under tortur which by the new law it is
not law to appli moreov none saw her come here and i should deni
her visit
the plan is veri clever said noma again
it is veri clever he repeat complac never have i made a
better on now throw those fruit to the she goat that ar in the
kraal and burn the basket while i go and talk to some in the great
place tell them that i have return from count my cattl on the
mountain whither i went after i had bow the knee in the hous of the
king
two hour later hokosa have made a wide detour and talk to sundri
of hi acquaint about the condit of hi cattl might have been
seen walk slowli along the north side of the great place toward hi
own kraal hi path lai past the chapel and the littl hous that owen
had built to dwell in thi hous wa furnish with a broad verandah
and upon it sat the messeng himself eat hi even meal hokosa
saw him and a great desir enter hi heart to learn whether or no
he had partaken of the poison fruit also it occur to him that it
would be wise if befor the end came he could contriv to divert all
possibl suspicion from himself by give the impress that he wa
now upon friendli term with the great white teacher and not disinclin
even to becom a convert to hi doctrin
for a moment he hesit seek an excus on soon suggest itself
to hi readi mind that veri morn the king had told him not obscur
that owen had plead for hi safeti and save him from be put upon
hi trial on charg of witchcraft and murder he would go to him now
at onc plai the part of a grate penit and the white man
magic must be keen inde if it avail to pierc the armour of hi
practis craft
so hokosa went up and squat himself down nativ fashion among a
littl group of convert who were wait to see their teacher upon on
busi or anoth he wa not more than ten pace from the verandah
and sit thu he saw a sight that interest him strang have
eaten a littl of a dish of roast meat owen put out hi hand and
took a fruit from a basket that the wizard knew well at thi moment he
look up and recognis hokosa
do you desir speech with me hokosa he ask in hi gentl voic
if so be pleas to come hither
nai messeng answer hokosa i desir speech with you inde but
it is ill to stand between a hungri man and hi food
i care littl for my food answer owen at the least it can wait
and he put down the fruit
then suddenli a feel to which the wizard had been for mani year a
stranger took possess of hima feel of compunct that man wa
about to partak of what would caus hi deathof what he hokosa had
prepar in order that it should caus hi death he wa good he wa
kindli none could alleg a wrong deed against him and foolish
though it might be so wa the doctrin that he taught why should he
kill him it wa true that never till that moment had he hesit by
fair mean or foul to remov an enemi or rival from hi path he
had been brought up in thi teach it wa part of the educ of
wizard to be merciless for thei reign by terror and evil craft
their magic lai chiefli in clairvoy and power of observ
develop to a pitch that wa almost superhuman and the best of
their weapon wa poison in infinit varieti whereof the guild alon
understood the properti and prepar therefor there wa noth
strang noth unusu in thi deed of devilish and cun murder
that the sight of it do should stir him thu and yet it did stir
him he wa mind to stop the plot to let thing take their cours
some sens of the futil of all such strive came home to him and
as in a glass for hokosa wa a man of imagin he foresaw their
end a littl success a littl failur it scarc matter which and
thenthat end within twenti year or ten or mayhap even on what
would thi present victori or defeat mean to him noth so far as
he wa concern that is noth so far as hi life of todai wa
concern yet if he had anoth life it might mean everyth there
wa anoth life he knew it who had drag back from it border the
spirit of the dead though what might be the state and occup of
those dead he did not know yet he believedwhi he could not tellthat
thei were affect vital by their act and behaviour here and hi
intellig warn him that good must alwai flow from good and evil
from evil to kill thi man wa evil and of it onli evil could come
what did he care whether hafela rule the nation or nodwengo and
whether it worship the god of the christian or the god of firewho
by the wai had prove himself so singularli ineffici in the hour of
trial now that he thought of it he much prefer nodwengo to hafela
for the on wa a just man and the other a tyrant and he himself wa
more comfort as a wealthi privat person than he had been as a head
medicineman and a chief of wizard he would let thing stand he would
prevent the messeng from eat of that fruit a word could do it he
had but to suggest that it wa unrip or not wholesom at thi season of
the year and it would be cast asid
all these reflect or their substanc pass through hokosa
mind in a few instant of time and alreadi he wa rise to go to
the verandah and translat their moral into act when anoth thought
occur to himhow should he face noma with thi tale he could give
up hi own ambit but could he bear her mockeri as dai by dai
she taunt him with hi fainthearted and reproach him with hi
failur to regain great and to make her great he forgot that he
might conceal the truth from her or rather he did not contempl such
conceal of which their relat were too peculiar and too intim
to permit she hate him and he worship her with a halfinhuman
passiona passion so unnatur inde that it suggest the horrid
and insati long of the damnedand yet their soul were nake
to each other it wa their fate that thei could hide noth each from
eachthei were curs with the aw necess of candour
it would be imposs that he should keep from noma anyth that he
did or did not do it would be still more imposs that she should
conceal from him even such imagin and thing as it is common for
women to hold secret her veri bitter which it had been polici for
her to cloak or soften would gush from her lip at the sight of him
nor in the depth of hi rage and torment could he on the other hand
control the illtim utter of hi continu and overmast
passion it came to thi then he must go forward and against hi
better judgment becaus he wa afraid to go back for the whip of
a woman tongu drove him on remorselessli it wa better that the
messeng should die and the land run red with blood than that he
should be forc to endur thi scourg
so with a sigh hokosa sank back to the ground and watch while owen at
three of the poison fruit after a paus he took a fourth and bit
into it but not seem to find it to hi tast he threw it to a child
that wa wait by the verandah for ani scrap which might be left over
from hi meal the child caught it and devour it eagerli
then smile at the littl boi delight the messeng call to
hokosa to come up and speak with him
chapter xv
noma come to hafela
hokosa advanc to the verandah and bow to the white man with grave
digniti
be seat said owen will you not eat though i have noth to
offer you but these and he push the basket of fruit toward him
ad the best of them i fear ar alreadi gone
i thank you no messeng such fruit ar not alwai wholesom at
thi season of the year i have known them to breed dysenteri
inde said owen if so i trust that i mai escap i have suffer
from that sick and i think that anoth bout of it would kill me
in futur i will avoid them but what do you seek with me hokosa enter
and tell me and he led the wai into a littl sittingroom
messeng said the wizard with deep humil i am a proud man i
have been a great man and it is no light thing to me to humbl myself
befor the face of my conqueror yet i am come to thi todai when i
wa in audienc with the king crave a small boon of hi gracious
he spoke to me sharp and bitter word he told me that he had been
mind to put me on trial for my life becaus of variou misdo which
ar alleg against me in the past but that you had plead for me
and that for thi caus he spare me i come to thank you for your
gentl messeng for i think that had i been in your place i
should have whisper otherwis in the ear of the king
sai no more of it friend said owen kindli we ar all of us
sinner and it is my place to push back your ancient sin not to drag
them into the light of dai and clamour for their punish it is true
i know that you plot with the princ hafela to poison umsuka the
king for it wa reveal to me it chanc howev that i wa abl
to recov umsuka from hi sick and hafela is fled so why should
i bring up the deed against you it is true that you still practis
witchcraft and that you hate and strive against the holi faith which i
preach but you were brought up to wizardri and have been the priest of
anoth creed and these thing plead for you
also hokosa i can see the good and evil struggl in your soul and
i prai and i believ that in the end the good will master the evil
that you who have been preemin in sin will come to be preemin
in righteous oh be not stubborn but listen with your ear and
let your heart be soften the gate stand open and i am the guid
appoint to show you the wai without reward or fee follow them er it
be too late that in time to come when my voic is still you also mai
be abl to direct the feet of wander into the path of peac it is
the hour of prayer come with me i beg of you and listen to some few
word of the messag of my lip and let your spirit be nurtur with
them and the sun of truth aris upon it dark
hokosa heard and befor thi simpl eloqu hi wisdom sank
confound more hi intellig wa stir and a desir came upon
him to investig and examin the canon of a creed that could produc
such men as thi he made no answer but wait while owen robe
himself he follow him to the chapel it wa full of newmad
christian who crowd even the doorwai but thei gave place to him
wonder then the servic begana short and simpl servic first
owen offer up some prayer for the welfar of the infant church for
the convers of the unbeliev for the safeti of the king and the
happi of the peopl then john the messeng first discipl read
aloud from a manuscript a portion of the scriptur which hi master had
translat it wa st paul exposit of the resurrect from the
dead and the grandeur of it thought and languag were by no mean
lost upon hokosa who savag and heathen though he might be wa also a
man of intellect
the read over owen address the congreg take for hi text
thy sin shall find thee out be now a master of the languag
he preach veri well and earnestli and inde the subject wa not
difficult to deal with in the presenc of an audienc mani of whose
past had been step in iniqu of no common kind as he talk of
judgment to come for the unrepent some of hi hearer groan and
even wept and when chang hi note he dwelt upon the bless futur
state of those who earn forgiv their face were light up with
joi
but perhap among all those gather befor him there were none more
deepli interest than hokosa and on other that woman to whom he
had sold the poison and who as it chanc sat next to him hokosa
watch her face as he wa skill to do saw the thrust of the
preacher go home and grew sure that alreadi in her jealou hast she
had found opportun to sprinkl the medicin upon her rival food
she believ it to be but a charm inde yet know that in us
such charm she had done wickedli she trembl beneath the word of
denunci and rise at length crept from the chapel
truli her sin will find her out thought hokosa to himself and
then in a strang halfimperson fashion he turn hi thought to
the consider of hi own case would hi sin find him out he
wonder befor he could answer that question it wa necessari first
to determin whether or no he had commit a sin the man befor
himthat gentl and yet impass manbor in hi vital the seed
of death which he hokosa had plant there wa it wrong to have done
thi it depend by which standard the deed wa judg accord to
hi own code the code on which he had been educ and which hitherto
he had follow with exact it wa not wrong that code taught
the necess of selfaggrandis or at least and at all cost the
necess of selfpreserv thi white preacher stood in hi path
he had humili him hokosa and in the end either of himself or
through hi influenc it wa probabl that he would destroi him
therefor he must strike befor in hi own person he receiv a mortal
blow and have no other mean at hi command he struck through
treacheri and poison
that wa hi law which for mani gener had been follow and
respect by hi class with the tacit assent of the nation accord to
thi law then he had done no wrong but now the victim by the altar
who did not know that alreadi he wa bound upon the altar preach a
new and a veri differ doctrin under which were it to be believ
he hokosa wa on of the worst of sinner the matter then resolv
itself to thi which of these two rule of life wa the right rule
which of them should a man follow to satisfi hi conscienc and to
secur hi abid welfar apart from the motiv that swai him as a
mere matter of ethic thi problem interest hokosa not a littl and
he went homeward determin to solv it if he might that could be done
in on wai onlybi a close examin of both system the first he
knew well he had practis it for nearli forti year of the second
he had but an inkl also if he would learn more of it he must make
hast see that it expon in some short while would ceas to be in
a posit to set it out
i trust that you will come again said owen to hokosa as thei left the
chapel
ye inde messeng answer the wizard i will come everi dai
and if you permit it i will attend your privat teach also for i
accept noth without examin and i greatli desir to studi thi
new doctrin of your root and flower and fruit
on the morrow noma start upon her journei as the matron who
accompani her gave out with a somewhat suspici persist it
ostens object wa to visit the mount of purif and there by
fast and solitud to purg herself of the sin of have given birth
to a stillborn child for amongst savag peopl such an accid is
apt to be look upon as littl short of a crime or at the least as
indic that the woman concern is the object of the indign
of spirit who need to be appeas to thi mount noma went and there
perform the customari rite
littl wonder she thought to herself that the spirit were angri
with her see that yonder in the buryingground of king she had
dare to break in upon their rest
from the place of purif she travel on ten dai journei with
her companion till thei reach the mountain fast where hafela had
establish himself the town and it surround were of extraordinari
strength and so well guard that it wa onli after consider
difficulti and delai that the women were admit hear of her
arriv and that she had word for him hafela sent for noma at onc
receiv her by night and alon in hi princip hut she came and
stood befor him and he look at her beauti with admir ey for he
could not forget the woman whom the cun of hokosa had forc him to
put awai
whenc come you pretti on he ask and wherefor come you ar
you weari of your husband that you fly back to me if so you ar
welcom inde for know noma that i still love you
ay princ i am weari of my husband sure enough but i do not fly to
you for he hold me fast to him with bond that you cannot understand
and fast to him while he live i must remain
what hinder noma that have got you here i should keep you here
the cun and magic of hokosa mai be great but thei will need to be
still greater to win you from my arm
thi hinder princ that you ar plai for a higher stake than that
of a woman love and if you deal thu by me and my husband then of a
sureti you will lose the game
what stake noma
the stake of the crown of the peopl of fire
and why should i lose if i take you as a wife
becaus hokosa see that i do not return and learn from hi spi
why i do not return will warn the king and by mani mean bring all
your plan to noth listen now to the word of hokosa that he ha
set between my lip to deliv to youand she repeat to him all the
messag without fault or fail
sai it again he said and she obei
then he answer
truli the skill of hokosa is great and well he know how to set a
snare but i think that if by hi counsel i should spring the bird he
will be too clever a man to keep upon the threshold of my throne he
who set on snare mai set twain and he who sit by the threshold mai
desir to enter the hous of king wherein there is no space for two to
dwell
is thi the answer that i am to take back to hokosa ask noma it
will scarc bind him to your caus princ and i wonder that you dare
to speak it to me who am hi wife
i dare to speak it to you noma becaus although you be hi wife all
wive do not love their lord and i think that perchanc in dai to
come you would choos rather to hold the hand of a young king than that
of a witchdoctor sink into eld thu shall you answer hokosa you
shall sai to him that i have heard hi word and that i find them veri
good and will walk along the path which he ha made here befor you i
swear by the oath that mai not be brokenth sacr oath call down
ruin upon my head should i break on word of itthat if by hi aid i
succe in thi great ventur i will pai him the price he ask after
myself the king he shall be the greatest man among the peopl he
shall be gener of the armi he shall be captain of the council
and head of the doctor and to him shall be given half the cattl of
nodwengo also into hi hand i will deliv all those who cling to thi
faith of the christian and if it pleas him he shall offer them as
a sacrific to hi god thi i swear and you noma ar wit to the
oath yet it mai chanc that after he hokosa ha gather up all
thi pomp and great he himself shall be gather up by death that
harvestman whom soon or late will garner everi ear and he look at
her meaningli
it mai be so princ she answer
it mai be so he repeat and when
when it is so then princ we will talk togeth but not till then
nai touch me not for were he to command me hokosa ha thi power over
me that i must show him all that you have done keep noth back
let me go now to the place that is made readi for me and afterward you
shall tell me again and more fulli the word that i must sai to hokosa
my husband
on the morrow hafela held a secret council of hi great men and the
next dai an embassi depart to nodwengo the king take to him that
messag which hokosa through noma hi wife had put into the lip
of the princ twenti dai later the embassi return sai that it
pleas the king to grant the prayer of hi brother hafela and bring
with it the tide that the white man messeng had fallen sick and
it wa thought that he would die
so in due cours the women and children of the peopl of hafela start
upon their journei toward the new land where it wa given out that thei
should live and with them went noma purpos to leav them as thei
drew near the gate of the great place of the king a while after

chapter xvi
the repent of hokosa
hokosa kept hi promis on the morrow of hi first attend there he
wa again to be seen in the chapel and after the servic wa over he
wait on owen at hi hous and listen to hi privat teach dai
by dai he appear thu till at length he becam master of the whole
doctrin of christian and discov that that which at first had
struck him as childish and even monstrou now present itself to him
in a new and veri differ light the convers of hokosa came upon
him through the gate of reason not as is usual among savagesand some
who ar not savagebi that of the emot given the posit of a
univers torn and groan beneath the dual rule of good and evil
two power of wellnigh equal potenc he found no great difficulti in
accept thi tale of the selfsacrific of the god of good that he
might wring the race he love out of the conquer grasp of the god of
ill there wa a simpl majesti about thi scheme of redempt which
appeal to on side of hi natur inde hokosa felt that under
certain condit and in a more limit fashion he would have been
capabl of attempt as much himself
onc hi reason wa satisfi the rest follow in a natur sequenc
within three week from the hour of hi first attend at the chapel
hokosa wa at heart a christian
he wa a christian although as yet he did not confess it but he wa
also the most miser man among the nation of the son of fire the
iniqu of hi past life had becom abomin to him but he had
commit them in ignor and he understood that thei were not beyond
forgiv yet high abov them all tower on coloss crime which
as he believ could never be pardon to him in thi world or the
next he wa the treacher murder of the messeng of god he wa
in the veri act of silenc the voic that had proclaim truth in the
dark place of hi soul and the dull ear of hi countrymen
the deed wa done no power on earth could save hi victim within a
week from the dai of eat that fatal fruit owen began to sicken then
the dysenteri had seiz him which slowli but sure wa wast out
hi life yet he the murder wa helpless for with thi form of the
diseas no medicin could cope with agoni in hi heart an agoni that
wa share by thousand of the peopl hokosa watch the decreas of
the white man strength and reckon the dai that would elaps befor
the end have such sin as thu upon hi soul though owen entreat
him earnestli he would not permit himself to be baptis twice he
went near to consent but on each occas an omin and terribl
incid drove him from the door of merci
onc when the word i will were almost on hi lip a woman broke in
upon their confer bear a dy boi in her arm
save him she implor save him messeng for he is my onli son
owen look at him and shook hi head
how came he like thi he ask
i know not messeng but he ha been sick ever sinc he at of a
certain fruit which you gave to him and she recal to hi mind
the incid of the throw of a fruit to the child which she had
wit
i rememb said owen it is strang but i also have been sick from
the dai that i at of those fruit ye and you hokosa warn me
against them
then he bless the boi and prai over him till he di but when
afterward he look round for hokosa it wa to find that he had gone
some eight dai later have to a certain extent recov from thi
shock hokosa went on morn to owen hous and talk to him
messeng he said is it necessari to baptism that i should confess
all my sin to you if so i can never be baptis for there is
wicked upon my hand which i am unabl to tell into the ear of
live man
owen thought and answer
it is necessari that you should repent all of your sin and that
you should confess them to heaven it is not necessari that you should
confess them to me who am but a man like yourself
then i will be baptis said hokosa with a sigh of relief
at thi moment as it chanc their interview wa again interrupt
for runner came from the king request the immedi presenc of the
messeng if he were well enough to attend upon a matter connect
with the trial of a woman for murder think that he might be of
servic owen lean on the shoulder of hokosa for alreadi he wa too
weak to walk far crept to the litter which wa wait for him and wa
born to the place of judgment that wa befor the hous of the king
hokosa follow more from curios than for ani other reason for
he had heard of no murder be commit and hi old desir to be
acquaint with everyth that pass wa still strong on him the
peopl made wai for him and he seat himself in the first line of
spectat immedi opposit to the king and three other captain
who were judg in the case so soon as owen had join the judg
the prison wa brought befor them and to hi secret horror hokosa
recognis in her that woman to whom he had given the poison in exchang
for the basket of fruit
now it seem to hokosa that hi doom wa on him for she would
certainli confess that she had the drug from him he thought of flight
onli to reject the thought for to fly would be to acknowledg himself
an accessori no he would brazen it out for after all hi word wa as
good as her with the prison came an accus her husband who seem
sick and he it wa who open the case against her
thi woman he said wa my wife i divorc her for barren as
i have a right to do accord to our ancient law and i took anoth
woman to wife her halfsist thi woman wa jealou she plagu me
continu and insult her sister so that i wa forc to drive her
awai after that she came to my hous and though thei said noth
of it at the time she wa seen by two servant of mine to sprinkl
someth in the bowl wherein our food wa cook subsequ my
wife thi woman halfsist wa taken ill with dysenteri i also
wa taken ill with dysenteri but i still live to tell thi stori befor
you o king and your judg though i know not for how long i live my
wife di yesterdai and i buri her thi morn i accus the woman
of have murder her either by witchcraft or by mean of a medicin
which she sprinkl on the food or by both i have spoken
have you anyth to sai ask the king of the prison ar you
guilti of the crime whereof thi man who wa your husband charg you
or doe he lie
then the woman answer in a low and broken voic
i am guilti king listen to my stori and she told it all as she told
it to hokosa i am guilti she ad and mai the great man in the
sky of whom the messeng ha taught us forgiv me my sister blood
is upon my hand and for aught i know the blood of my husband yonder
will also be on my hand i seek no merci inde it is better that i
should die but i would sai thi in selfdef that i did not think
to kill my sister i believ that i wa give to her a potion which
would caus her husband to hate her and no more
here she look round and her ey met those of hokosa
who told you that thi wa so ask on of the judg
a witchdoctor she answer from whom i bought the medicin in the
old dai long ago when umsuka wa king
hokosa gasp why should thi woman have spare him
no further question wa ask of her and the judg consult togeth
at length the king spoke
woman he said you ar condemn to die you will be taken to the
doom tree and there be hang out of those who ar assembl to try
you two the messeng and myself have given their vote in favour of
merci but the major think otherwis thei sai that a law ha been
pass against murder by mean of witchcraft and secret medicin and
that should we let you go free the peopl will make a mock of that law
so be it go in peac tomorrow you must die and mai forgiv await
you elsewher
i ask noth els said the woman it is best that i should die
then thei led her awai as she pass hokosa she turn and look him
full in the ey till he drop hi head abash next morn she wa
execut and he learn that her last word were let it come to
the ear of him who sold me the poison tell me that it wa but
a harmless drug that as i hope to be forgiven so i forgiv him
believ that my silenc mai win for him time for repent befor he
follow on the road i tread
now when hokosa heard these word he shut himself up in hi hous for
three dai give out that he wa sick nor would he go near to owen
be altogeth without hope and not believ that baptism or ani
other rite could avail to purg such crime as hi truli hi sin had
found him out and the burden of it wa intoler so intoler did
it becom that at length he determin to be done with it he could
live no more he would die and by hi own hand befor he wa call
upon to wit the death of the man whom he had murder to thi end
he made hi prepar for noma he left no messag for though hi
heart still hunger after her he knew well that she hate him and
would rejoic at hi death
when all wa readi he sat down to think a while and as he thought a
man enter hi hut sai that the messeng desir to see him at
first he wa mind not to go then it occur to him that it would be
well if he could die with a clean heart why should he not tell all to
the white man and befor he could be deliv up to justic take
that poison which he had prepar it wa imposs that he should be
forgiven yet he desir that hi victim should learn how deep wa hi
sorrow and repent befor he prove it by preced him to death so
he rose and went
he found owen in hi hous ly in a rude chair and prop up by
pillow of bark now he wa wast almost to a shadow and in the pale
pinch face hi dark ey alwai larg and spiritu shone with
unnatur lustr while hi delic hand were so thin that when he
held them up in bless the light show through them
welcom friend he said tell me why have you desert me of late
have you been ill
no messeng answer hokosa that is not in my bodi i have been
sick at heart and therefor i have not come
what hokosa do your doubt still torment you i thought that my
prayer had been heard and that power had been given me to set them at
rest for ever man let me hear the troubl and swiftli for cannot you

you at a while ago wa poison and by my hand for i am a master of
such art from the begin i hate you as well i might for had you
not worst me and torn power from my grasp and place the peopl and
the king under the rule of anoth god therefor when all els fail
i determin to murder you and i did the deed by mean of that woman
who not long ago wa hung for the kill of her sister though in truth
she wa innoc and he told him what had pass between himself and
the woman and told him also of the plot which he had hatch to kill
nodwengo and the christian and to set hafela on the throne
she wa innoc he went on but i am guilti how guilti you and i
know alon do you rememb that dai when you at the fruit how
after it i accompani you to the church yonder and listen to your
preach your sin shall find you out you said and of a sureti mine

you then and afterward i grew to love you and to believ the word you
taught and therefor am i of all men the most miser and therefor
must i who have been great and the councillor of king perish
miser by the death of a dog
now curs me and let me go
chapter xvii
the loos of noma
when owen heard that it wa hokosa who had poison him he groan and
hid hi face in hi hand and thu he remain till the evil tale wa
finish now he lift hi head and spoke but not to hokosa
o god he said i thank thee that at the cost of my poor life thou
hast been pleas to lead thi sinner toward the gate of righteous
and to save aliv those whom thou hast sent me to gather to thy fold
then he look at hokosa and said
unhappi man is not your cup full enough of crime and have you not
suffici tempt the merci of heaven that you would add to all your
evil deed that of selfmurd
it is better to die todai by my own hand answer hokosa than
tomorrow among the mockeri of the peopl to fall a victim to your

then he went to the church and wait there an hour later he wa
summon and found the king seat with owen
man said nodwengo i am told by the messeng here that you have
knowledg of a plot which my brother the princ hafela ha made to fall
treacher upon me and put me and my peopl to the spear how you
come to be acquaint with the plot and what part you have plai
in it i will not now inquir for so much have i promis to the
messeng yet i warn you it will be well that you should tell me all

you shall sure die
king hear all the truth answer hokosa in a voic of desper
calm i have knowledg of the plot for it wa i who wove it but
whether or not hafela will carri it out altogeth i cannot sai for
as yet no word ha reach me from him king thi wa the plan that i
made and he told him everyth
it is fortun for you hokosa said nodwengo grimli when he had
finish that i gave my word to the messeng that no harm should come
to you see that you have repent and confess thi is certain
that hafela ha listen to your evil counsel for i gave my consent to
hi flight from thi land with all hi peopl and alreadi hi women
and children have cross the mountain path in thousand well thi
i swear that their feet shall tread it no more for where thei ar
thither he shall go to join them should he chanc to live to do so
hokosa begon and know that dai and night you will be watch should
you so much as dare to approach on of the gate of the great place
that moment you shall die
have no fear o king said hokosa humbl for i have empti all my
heart befor you the past is the past and cannot be recal for the
futur while it pleas you to spare me i am the most loyal of your
servant
can a man empti a spring with a pitcher ask the king
contemptu by tomorrow thi heart of your mai be full again
with the blackest treacheri o master of sin and li mani month ago i
spare you at the prayer of the messeng and now at hi prayer i spare
you again yet in do so i think that i am foolish
nai i will answer for him broke in owen let him stai here with me
and set your guard without my gate
how do i know that he will not murder you friend ask the king
thi man is a snake whom few can nurs with safeti
he will not murder me said owen smile becaus hi heart is turn
from evil to good also there is littl need to murder a dy man
nai speak not so said the king hastili and as for thi man be it
as you will come i must take counsel with my captain for our danger
is near and great
so it came about that hokosa stai in the hous of owen
on the morrow the great place wa full of the bustl of prepar and
by dawn of the follow dai an impi of some seventeen thousand spear
had start to ambush hafela and hi forc in a certain wood defil
through which he must pass on hi wai to the mountain pass where hi
women and children were gather the armi wa not larg at least in
the ey of the peopl of fire who befor the death of umsuka and the
break up of the nation count their warrior by ten of thousand
but after those event the most of the regiment had desert to hafela
leav to nodwengo not more than twoandtwenti thousand spear upon
which he could reli of these he kept less than a third to defend the
great place against possibl attack and all the rest he sent to fall
upon hafela far awai hope there to make an end of him onc and for
all thi counsel the king took against the better judgment of mani of
hi captain and as the issu prove it wa mistaken
when owen told hokosa of it that old gener shrug hi shoulder
the king would have done better to keep hi regiment at home he
said and fight it out with hafela here where he is well prepar
yonder the countri is veri wide and broken and it mai well chanc that
the impi will miss that of hafela and then how can the king defend
thi place with a hand should the princ burst upon him at the head
of forti thousand men but who am i that i should give counsel for which
none seek
as god will so shall it befal answer owen wearili but oh the
thought of all thi bloodsh break my heart i trust that it beat
mai be still befor my ey behold the evil hour
on the even of that dai hokosa wa baptis the ceremoni took place
not in the church for owen wa too weak to go there but in the
largest room of hi hous and befor some few wit chosen from the
congreg even as he wa be sign with the sign of the cross
a strang and familiar attract caus the convert to look up and
behold befor him watch all with mock ey stood noma hi wife

on the morrow at sundown all that remain of thoma owen wa laid to
rest befor the altar of the littl church nodwengo the king and hokosa
lower him into the grave while john hi first discipl read over
him the burial servic of the christian which it had been on of the
dead man last labour to translat into the languag of the amasuka
befor the ceremoni wa finish a soldier carri a spear in hi
hand push hi wai through the dens and weep crowd and have
salut whisper someth into the ear of the king nodwengo start
and with a last look of farewel at the face of hi friend left the
chapel accompani by some of hi gener who were present mutter
to hokosa that he wa to follow when all wa done accordingli some
few minut later he went and wa admit into the council hut
where captain and messeng were to be seen arriv and depart
continu
hokosa said the king you have dealt treacher with me in the
past but i believ now that your heart is true at the least i follow
the command of our dead master and trust you listen the outpost have
sight an impi of mani regiment advanc toward the great place
though whether or no it be my own impi return victori from the
war with my brother i cannot sai there is thi against it howev
that a messeng ha but just arriv report that the gener have
perceiv the host of hafela encamp upon a ridg over against the
gorg where thei await him if that be so thei can scarc have
given him battl for the messeng is swift of foot and ha travel
night and dai yet how can thi be the impi of hafela who sai the
gener is encamp upon the ridg
he mai have left the ridg king have been warn of the ambush
it cannot be for when the runner start hi fire burn there and
hi soldier were gather round them
then perhap hi captain sit upon the ridg with some portion of hi
strength to deceiv those who await him in the gorg while know
that here men ar few he himself swoop down on you with the main bodi
of hi impi
at least we shall learn present answer the king but if it be
as i fear and we ar outwit what is there that we can do against so
mani
now on of the captain propos that thei should stai where thei were
and hold the place
it is too larg answer the king thei will burst the fenc and
break our line
anoth suggest that thei should fly and avoid the regiment of
hafela in the dark of the night should travel swiftli in search of
the main armi that had been sent to lie in ambush
what said nodwengo leav the ag and the women and children to
perish for how can we take such a multitud no i will have none of
thi plan
then hokosa spoke king he said listen to my counsel command now
that all the women and the old men take with them such cattl and
food as ar in the town depart at onc into the vallei of death and
collect in the open space that li beyond the tree of doom near the
spring of water that is there the vallei is narrow and the cliff ar
steep and it mai chanc that by the help of heaven we shall be abl to
hold it till the armi return to reliev us to seek which messeng
must be sent at onc with these tide
the plan is good said the king though none had thought of it but
so we shall lose the town
town can be rebuilt answer hokosa but who mai restor the live
of men
as the word left hi lip a runner burst into the council cry
king the impi is that of hafela and the princ head it in person
alreadi hi outpost rest upon the plain of fire
then nodwengo rose and issu hi order command that all the
ineffect popul of the town togeth with such food and cattl
as could be gather should retreat at onc into the vallei of death
by thi time the four or five thousand soldier who were left in the
great place had been parad on the open ground in front of the king
hous where thei stood still and silent in the moonlight nodwengo
and the captain went out to them and as thei saw him come thei lift
their spear like on man give him the royal salut of king he
held up hi hand and address them
soldier he said we have been outwit my impi is afar and
that of hafela is at our gate yonder in the vallei though we be
few we can defend ourselv till succour reach us which alreadi
messeng have gone out to seek but first we must give time for the
women and children the sick and the ag to withdraw with food and
cattl and thi we can do in on wai onli by keep hafela at bai
till thei have pass the archwai all of them now soldier for the
sake of your own live of your honour and of those you love swear to
me in the holi name which we have been taught to worship that you will
fight out thi great fight without fear or falter
we swear it in the holi name and by your head king roar the
regiment
then victori is alreadi our answer nodwengo follow me children
of fire and shake hi great spear he led the wai toward that
portion of the outer fenc upon which hafela wa advanc
by now the town behind them wa a scene of almost indescrib tumult
and confus for the compani detail to the task were clear the
numberless hut of their occup and collect women children and
oxen in thousand preparatori to drive them into the defil panic
had seiz mani of these poor creatur who in imagin alreadi
saw themselv impal upon the cruel spear of hafela troop and
inde in not a few instanc believ those who were urg them
forward to be the enemi women shriek and wrung their hand children
wail piteous oxen low and the infirm and ag vent their
grief in groan and cri to heaven or their ancient god for merci
in truth so difficult wa the task of marshal thi motlei arrai
at night number as it did ten or twelv thousand soul that a full
hour went by befor the mob even began to move slowli and uncertainli
toward the place of refug whereof the open wa so narrow that but
few of them could pass it at a time
meanwhil hafela wa develop the attack form hi great armi into
the shape of a wedg he rais hi battlecri and rush down on the
first line of fortif which he storm without difficulti
for thei were defend by a few skirmish onli next he attack the
second line and carri it after heavi fight then hurl himself
upon the weakest point of the main fenc of the vast kraal here it wa
that the frai began in earnest for here nodwengo wa wait for him
thrice the thousand roll on in the face of a storm of spear and
thrice thei fell back from the wide fenc of thorn and the wall of
stone behind it by now the battl had rage for about an hour and a
half and it wa report to the king that the first of the women and
children had pass the archwai into the vallei and that nearli all of
them were clear of the eastern gate of the town
then it is time that we follow them said the king for if we wait
here until the warrior of hafela ar among us our retreat will becom
a rout and soon there will be none left to follow let on compani and
he name it hold the fenc for a while to give us time to withdraw
take the wound with us
we hear you king said on of that compani but our captain is
kill
who among you will take over the command of these men and hold the
breach ask nodwengo of the group of offic about him
i king answer old hokosa lift hi spear for i care not
whether i live or die
go to boaster cri anoth who among us care whether he live or
di when the king command
that we shall know tomorrow said hokosa quietli and the soldier
laugh at the retort
so be it said the king and while silent and swiftli he led off the
regiment keep in the shadow of the hut hokosa and hi hundr
men post themselv behind the weaken fenc and wall now for the
fourth time the attack regiment came forward grimli on thi occas
led by the princ himself as thei drew near hokosa leapt upon the
wall and stand there in the bright moonlight where all could see
him he call to them to halt instinct thei obei him
is it hafela whom i see yonder he ask
ah it is i answer the princ what would you with me wizard and
traitor
thi onli hafela i would ask you what you seek here
that which you promis me hokosa the crown of my father and certain
other thing
then get you back hafela for you shall never win them have i
prophesi fals to you at ani time not soneith do i prophesi
fals now get you back whenc you came and your wolv with you
els shall you bide here for ever
do you dare to call down evil on me wizard shout the princ
furious your wife is mine and now i take your life also and with
all hi strength he hurl at him the great spear he held
it hiss past hokosa head touch hi ear but he never flinch
from the steel
a poor cast princ he said laugh but so it must have been for
i am guard by that which you cannot see my wife you have and she
shall be your ruin my life you mai take but er it leav me hafela
i shall see you dead and your armi scatter the messeng is pass
awai but hi power ha fallen upon me and i speak the truth to you o
princ and warrior who arealreadi dead
now a shriek of dismai and furi rose from the hundr who heard thi
prophesi of ill for of hokosa and hi magic thei were terribl afraid
kill him kill the wizard thei shout and a rain of spear rush
toward him on the wall
thei rush toward him thei pass abov below around but of them
all not on touch him
did i not tell you that i wa guard by that which you cannot see
hokosa ask contemptu then slowli he descend from the wall
amidst a great silenc
when men ar scarc the tongu must plai a part he explain to hi
companion who stare at him wonder by now the king and those
with him should have reach the eastern gate wherea had we fought at
onc hafela would be hard upon hi heel for we ar few and who can
hold a buffalo with a rope of grass yet i think that i spoke truth
when i told him that the garment of the messeng ha fallen upon my
shoulder and that death await him and hi companion as it await
me also and mani of us now friend be readi for the bull charg
and soon we must feel hi horn thi at least is left to you to die
glorious
while he wa still speak the first file of the regiment rush upon
the fenc tear asid the thorn with their hand till a passag wa
made through them then thei sprang upon the wall there to be met
by the spear of hokosa and hi men thrust upward from beneath it
shelter time after time thei sprang and time after time thei fell back
dead or wound till at last dash forward in on dens column thei
pour over the stone as the rise tide pour over the rock on the
seashor drive the defend befor them by the sheer weight of
number
thi game is plai cri hokosa fly now to the eastern gate for
here we can do noth more
so thei fled those who surviv of them and after them came the
thousand of the foe sack and fire the desert town as thei
advanc
hokosa and hi men or rather the half of them reach the gate and
pass it in safeti bar it after them and therebi delai the
attack till thei could burst their wai through now hundr of hut
were afir and the flame spread swiftli light up the countri far
and wide in the glare of them hokosa could see that alreadi a full
twothird of the crowd of fugit had pass the narrow arch while
nodwengo and the soldier were drawn up in compani upon the steep and
rocki slope that led to it protect their retreat
he advanc to the king and report himself
so you have live through it said nodwengo
i shall die when my hour come and not befor hokosa answer we
did well yonder and yet the most of us ar aliv to tell the tale for
i knew when and how to go be readi king for the foe press us close
and that mob behind us crawl onward like a snail
as he spoke the pursuer broke through the fenc and gate of the burn
town and onc more the fight began thei had the advantag of number
but nodwengo and hi troop stood in a wide road upon higher ground
protect on either side by wall and were moreov rest not
breathless and weari with travel like the men of hafela slowli
fight everi inch of the wai nodwengo wa push back and slowli
the long antlik line of women and sick and cattl crept through the
open in the rock till at length all of them were gone
it is time said nodwengo glanc behind him for our arm grow
weari
then he gave order and compani by compani the defend forc follow
on the path of the fugit till at length amidst a roar of rage and
disappoint the last of them vanish through the arch hokosa among
them and the place wa block with stone abov which shone a hedg
of spear
chapter xx
noma set a snare
thu end the first night battl sinc for thi time the enemi had
fought enough nodwengo and hi men had also had enough for out of the
five thousand of them some eleven hundr were kill or wound yet
thei might not rest for all that night assist by the women thei
labour build stone wall across the narrowest part of the vallei
also the cattl women and children were move along the gorg which in
shape mai be compar to a bottl with two neck on at either end
and encamp in the open of the second neck where wa the spring
of water thi spot wa chosen both becaus here alon water could be
obtain without which thei could not hold out more than a singl dai
and becaus the koppi whereon grew the strangelook euphorbia known
as the tree of doom afford a natur rampart against attack
shortli after dawn while the soldier were rest and eat of
such food as could be procuredfor the most part strip of raw or
halfcook meat cut from hastili kill cattleth onslaught wa
renew with vigour hafela direct hi effort to the forc of the
natur archwai but strive as he would thi he could not do for it
wa choke with stone and thorn and guard by brave men
you do but wast your labour hafela said noma who stood by him
watch the assault
what then is to be done he ask for unless we come at them we
cannot kill them it wa clever of them to take refug in thi hole i
thought sure that thei would fight it out yonder beneath the fenc
of the great place
ah she answer you forgot that thei had hokosa on their side did
you then think to catch him sleep thi retreat wa hokosa counsel
i learn it from the lip of that wound captain befor thei kill
him now it seem that there ar but two path to follow and you can
choos between them the on is to send a regiment a dai and a half
journei across the cliff top to guard the further mouth of the vallei
and to wait till these jackal starv in their hole for certainli thei
can never come out
it ha start six hour sinc said hafela and though the
precipic ar steep have the moon to travel by it should reach the
river mouth of the vallei befor dawn tomorrow cut nodwengo off
from the plain if inde he should dare to ventur out upon them
which with so small a forc he will not do yet thi first plan
of your must fail noma see that befor thei starv within the
gener of nodwengo will be back upon us from the mountain catch
us between the hammer and the anvil and i know not how that fight would
go
yet soon or late it must be fought
nai he answer for my hope is that should the impi return to
find nodwengo dead thei will surrend and acknowledg me as king who
am the first of the blood royal but what is your second plan
by wai of answer she point to the cliff abov them on the righthand
side face the archwai wa a flat ledg overhang the vallei at a
height of about a hundr feet
if you can come yonder she said it will be easi to storm thi gate
for there lie rock in plenti and men cannot fight when stone ar
drop on their head
but how can we come to that home of vultur where never man ha set
a foot look the cliff abov is sheer no rockrabbit could stand upon
it
with her ey noma measur the distanc from the brink of the precipic
to the broad ledg command the vallei
sixti pace not more she said well yonder ar oxen in plenti and
out of their hide rope can be made and out of rope a ladder down
which men mai pass ten or even five would be enough
well thought of noma said hafela hokosa told us last night that to
him had pass the wisdom of the messeng but if thi be so i think
that to you ha pass the guil of hokosa
it seem to me that some of it abid with him answer noma
laugh
then the princ gave order and with mani worker of hide toil at
it within two hour the ladder wa readi it stave set twenti inch
apart be form of knobkerri or the broken shaft of stab
spear now thei lower it from the top of the precipic so that it
end rest upon the ledg and down it came sever men who swung upon
it giddi length like spider on a web reach thi great shelf in
safeti and advanc to the edg of it these men start a boulder
which although as it chanc it hurt no on fell in the midst of a
group of the defend and bound awai through them
now we must be go said hokosa look up for no man can fight
against rock and our spear cannot reach those bird had the armi
been taught the us of the bow as i counsel in the past dai we
might still have held the archwai but thei call it a woman weapon
and would have none of it
as he spoke anoth stone fell crush the life out of a man who stood
next to him then thei retreat to the first wall which had been pile
up dure the night where it wa not possibl to roll rock upon them
from the cliff abov thi wall and other rear at interv behind
it thei set to work to strengthen as much as thei could make the
most of the time that wa left to them befor the enemi could clear the
wai and march on to attack
present hafela men were through and sweep down upon them with
a roar think to carri the wall at a singl rush but in thi thei
fail inde it as onli after an hour hard fight and by the
expedi of continu attack the work with fresh compani that at
length thei storm the wall
when hokosa saw that he could no longer hold the place but befor the
foe wa upon him he drew off hi soldier to the second wall a quarter
of a mile or more awai and here the fight began again and so it went
on for hour after hour as on by on the fortif were carri
by the weight of number for the attack fought desper under the
ey of their princ care noth for the terribl loss thei suffer
in men twice the forc of the defend wa chang by order of
nodwengo fresh men be sent from the compani held in reserv to
take the place of those who had born the brunt of the battl thi
inde it wa necessari to do see that it wa imposs to carri
water to so mani and in that burn vallei men could not fight for
long athirst onli hokosa stai on for thei brought him drink in
a gourd and wherev the frai wa fiercest there he wa alwai nor
although spear were rain upon him by hundr wa he touch by on
of them
at length as the night fell the king men were driven back from their
last scherm in the western half of the vallei across the open space
back upon the koppi where stood the tree of doom here thei stai a
while till overmatch and outworn thei were push from it rock
across the narrow stretch of broken ground into the shelter of the great
stone scherm or wall that ran from side to side of the further neck of
the vallei whereon thousand of women and such men as could be spare
had been work incessantli dure the past night and dai
it wa as he retreat among the last upon thi wall that hokosa caught
sight of noma for the first time sinc thei part in the hous of the
messeng in the forefront of hi troop direct the attack wa
hafela the princ and at hi side stood noma carri in her hand a
littl shield and a spear at thi moment also she saw him and call
aloud to him
you have fought well wizard but tomorrow all your magic shall avail
you noth for it will be your last dai upon thi earth
ay noma he answer and your also
then of a sudden a compani of the king men rush from the shelter of
the wall upon the attack drive them back to the koppi and kill
sever so that in the confus and gather dark hokosa lost
sight of her though a man at hi side declar that he saw her fall
beneath the thrust of an assegai thu end the second dai
now when the watch had been set the king and hi captain took counsel
togeth for their heart were heavi
listen said nodwengo out of five thousand soldier a thousand have
been kill and a thousand lie among us wound hark to the groan of
them also we have with us women and children and sick to the number of
twelv thousand and between us and those who would butcher them everi
on there stand but a singl wall nor is thi the worst of it the
spring cannot suppli the want of so great a multitud in thi hot
place and it is fear that present the water will be done what
wai shall we turn if we surrend to hafela perhap he will spare the
live of the women and children but whatev he mai promis the most
of us he will sure slai if we fight and ar defeat then onc
hi regiment ar among us all will be slain accord to the ancient
custom of our peopl i have bethought me that we might retreat through
the vallei but the river beyond is in flood also it is certain that
befor thi multitud could reach it the princ will have sent a forc
to cut us off while he himself harass our rear now let him who ha
counsel speak
king i have counsel said hokosa what were the word that the
messeng spoke to us befor he di did he not sai even now the
heathen is at your gate and mani of you shall perish on hi spear
but i tell you that he shall not conquer did he not sai be faith
cling to the cross and do not dare to doubt your lord for he will
protect you and your children after you and he will be your captain
and you shall be hi peopl did he not bid you also to listen to my
counsel then listen to it for it is hi your case seem desper
but have no fear and take no thought for the morrow for all shall yet
be well let us now prai to him that the messeng ha reveal to us
and whom now he implor on our behalf in that place where he is to
guid us and to save us for then sure he will hearken to our prayer
so be it said nodwengo and go out he stood upon a pillar of stone
in the moonlight and offer up hi supplic in the hear of the
multitud
meanwhil those of the camp of hafela were also take counsel thei
had fought brave inde and carri the schans but at great cost
sinc for everi man that nodwengo had lost three of their had fallen
moreov thei were in evil case with weari and the want of water
as each drop thei drank must be carri to them from the great place in
bag made of raw hide which caus it to stink for thei had but few
gourd with them
now it is strang said hafela that these men should fight so
brave see that thei ar but a hand there can be scarc three
thousand of them left and yet i doubt not that befor we carri those
last wall of their as mani of us or more will be done ay and after
thei ar done with we must meet their great impi when it return and
of what will befal us then i scarc like to think
illfortun will befal you while hokosa live broke in noma had it
not been for him thi troubl would have been done with by now but
he is a wizard and by hi wizardri he defeat us and put heart into
nodwengo and the warrior you yourself have seen him thi dai defi
us not onc but mani time for upon hi flesh steel ha no power ay
and thi is but the begin of evil for i am sure that he lead you
into some deep trap where you shall perish everlastingli did he not
himself declar that the power of that dead white worker of miracl ha
fallen upon him and who can fight against magic
who inde said hafela humbl for like all savag he wa
veri superstiti and moreov a sincer believ in hokosa
supernatur capac thi wizard is too strong for us he is
invulner and as i know well he can read the secret thought of men
and can suck wisdom from the dead while to hi ey the dark is no
blind
nai hafela answer noma there is on crack in hi shield hear
me if we can but catch him and hold him fast we shall have no need to
fear him more and i think that i know how to bait the trap
how will you bait it ask hafela
thu midwai between the koppi and the wall behind which lie the men
of the king stand a flat rock and all about that rock ar stretch
the bodi of dead soldier now thi is my plan that when next on
of those dark stormcloud pass over the face of the moon six of the
strongest of our warrior should creep upon their belli down thi wai
and that as though thei were also number with the slain thi done
you shall despatch a herald to call in the ear of the king that you
desir to treat with him of peac then he will answer that if thi be
so you can come beneath the wall of hi camp and your herald shall
refus sai that you fear treacheri but he must add that if nodwengo
will bid hokosa to advanc alon to the flat rock you will bid me
noma whom none can fear to do likewis and that there we can talk in
sight of both armi and return thenc make report to you and to
nodwengo afterward so soon as hokosa ha set hi foot upon the rock
those men who seem to be dead shall spring upon him and drag him to
our camp where we can deal with him for onc the wizard is taken the
caus of nodwengo is lost
a good pitfal said the princ but will hokosa walk into the trap
i think so hafela for three reason he is altogeth without fear
he will desir if mai be to make peac on behalf of the king and he
ha thi strang weak that he still love me and will scarc
suffer an occas of speak with me to go past although he ha
divorc me
so be it said the princ the game can be tri and if it fail
why we lose noth wherea if it succe we gain hokosa which is
much for with you i think that our arm will never prosper while that
accurs wizard sit yonder weav hi spell against us and bring
our men to death by hundr and by thousand
then he gave hi order and present when a cloud pass over the
face of the moon six chosen men crept forward under the lee of the flat
rock and threw themselv down here and there amongst the dead
soon the cloud pass and the herald advanc across the open space
blow a horn and wave a branch in hi hand to show that he came
upon a mission of peac
chapter xxi
hokosa is lift up
what would you ask hokosa of the herald as he halt a short
spearcast from the wall
my master the princ hafela desir to treat with your master
nodwengo mani men have fallen on either side and if thi war goe on
though victori must be hi at last mani more will fall therefor if
ani plan can be found he desir to spare their live
now hokosa spoke with the king and answer
then let hafela come beneath the wall and we will talk with him
not so answer the herald doe a buck walk into an open pit were
the princ to come here it might chanc that your spear would talk with
him let nodwengo follow me to the camp yonder where we promis him
safe conduct
not so answer hokosa doe a buck walk into an open pit set out
your messag and we will consid it
nai i am but a common man without author but i am charg to make
you anoth offer and if you will not hear it then there is an end
let hokosa advanc alon to that flat rock you see yonder and there he
shall be met also alon by on have power to talk with him name
by the ladi noma who wa onc hi wife thu thei can confer togeth
midwai between the camp and in full sight of both of them nor no man
be near can he find caus to be afraid of an unarm girl what sai
you
hokosa turn and talk with the king
i think it well that you should not go said nodwengo the offer
seem fair and the stone is out of reach of their spear still
behind it mai lurk a scheme to kill or captur you for hafela is veri
cun
it mai be so king answer hokosa still my heart tell me it is
wisest that i should do thi thing for our case is desper and if i
do it not that mai be the caus of the death of all of us tomorrow
at the worst i am but on man and it matter littl what mai chanc to
me nor shall i come to ani harm unless it is the will of heaven that it
should be so and be sure of thi that out of the harm will aris good
for where i go there the spirit of the messeng goe with me rememb
that he bade you listen to my counsel while i remain with you see
that i do not speak of my own wisdom therefor let me go and if it
should chanc that i am taken troubl not about the matter for thu it
will be fate to some great end abov all though often enough i have
been a traitor in the past do not dream that i betrai you keep in
mind that so to do would be to betrai my own soul which veri soon must
render it account on high
as you will hokosa answer the king and now tell those rebel dog
that on these term onli will i make peac with themthat thei withdraw
across the mountain by the path which their women and children have
taken leav thi land for ever without lift anoth spear against
us if thei will do thi notwithstand all the wicked and
slaughter that thei have work i will send command to my impi to let
them go unharm if thei will not do thi i put my trust in the god i
worship and will fight thi frai out to the end know that if i and
my peopl perish thei shall perish also
now nodwengo himself spoke to the herald who wa wait beyond the
wall
go back to him you serv he said and sai that hokosa will meet her
who wa hi wife upon the flat stone and talk with her in the sight of
both armi bear my word with him at the sound of the blow of a
horn shall each of them advanc unarm and alon from either camp sai
to my brother also that it will inde be ill for him if he attempt
treacheri upon hokosa for the man who caus hi blood to flow will
sure die and after death shall be accurs for ever
the herald went and present a horn wa blown
now it come into my mind that we part for the last time said
nodwengo in a troubl voic as he took the hand of hokosa
it mai be so king in my heart i think that it is so yet i do not
altogeth griev thereat for the burden of my past sin crush me
and i am weari and seek for rest yet we do not part for the last time
becaus whatev chanc in the end i shall make my report to you
yonderand he point upward reign on for long year kingreign
well and wise cling to the faith for thu at the last shall you
reap your reward farewel
now again the horn blew and in the bright moonlight the slight figur
of noma could be seen advanc toward the stone
then hokosa sprang from the wall and advanc also till at the same
moment thei climb upon the stone
greet hokosa said noma and she stretch out her hand to him
by wai of answer he place hi own behind hi back sai to your
busi woman yet hi ey search her faceth face which in hi
folli he still love and thu it came about that he never saw sundri of
the dead bodi which lai in the shadow of the stone begin to quicken
into life and inch by inch to aris first to their knee and next to
their feet he never saw or heard them yet as the word left hi lip
thei sprang upon him from everi side hold him so that he could not
move
awai with him cri noma with a laugh of triumph and at her command
he wa halfdrag and halfcarri across the open space and thrust
violent over a stone wall into the camp of hafela
now nodwengo and hi soldier saw what had happen and with a shout of
treacheri some hundr of them leapt into the plain and began to run
toward the koppi to rescu their envoi
hokosa heard the shout and wrench himself round beheld them
back he cri in a clear shrill voic back children of nodwengo
and leav me to my fate for the foe wait for you by thousand behind
the wall
a soldier struck him across the mouth bid him be silent but hi
warn had come to the ear of nodwengo caus him and hi warrior
to halt and begin a retreat it wa well that thei did so for see
that thei would not come on from under the shelter of the wall and
of everi rock and stone soldier jump up by compani and charg
drive them back to their own schans but the king men had the start
of them and had taken shelter behind it whenc thei greet them with
a vollei of spear kill ten and wound twice as mani more
now it wa hokosa turn to laugh and laugh he did sai
my take is well paid for alreadi princ a score of your best
warrior is a heavi price to give for the carcas of on weari and ag
man but sinc i am here among you captur with so much pain and loss
tell me of your courtesi why i have been brought
then the princ shook hi spear at him and curs him
would you learn wizard and traitor he cri we have caught you
becaus we know well that while you stai yonder your magic counsel will
prevail against our might wherea when onc we hold you fast nodwengo
will wander to hi ruin like a blind and moonstruck man for you were to
him both ey and brain
i understand said hokosa calmli but princ how if i left my
wisdom behind me
that mai not be answer hafela sinc even a wizard cannot throw
hi thought into the heart of anoth from afar
ah you think so princ well ask noma yonder if i cannot throw my
thought into her heart from afar though of late i have not chosen
to do so have put asid such spell but let it pass and tell me
have taken me what is it you propos to do with me first howev
i will give you for noth some of that wisdom which you grudg to
nodwengo the king be advis by me princ and take the term that he
offer to younam to turn thi veri night and begon from the land
without harm or hindranc will you receiv my gift hafela
what will happen if i refus it ask the princ slowli
now hokosa look at the dust at hi feet then he gaze upward
search the heaven and answer
did not i tell you yesterdai i think that thi will happen i
thinkbut who can be quit sure of the futur hafelathat you and
the most of your armi by thi hour tomorrow night will be ly fast
asleep about thi place with jackal for your bedfellow
the princ heard and trembl at hi word for he believ that if he
will it hokosa could prophesi the truth
accurs dog he said i am mind to be guid by your sai but
be sure of thi that if i follow it you shall stai here to sleep with
jackal ye thi veri night
then noma broke in
be not mad hafela she said will you listen to the li that thi
renegad tell to work upon your fear will you abandon victori when it
li within your grasp and in place of a great king becom a fugit
whom all men mock at an outcast to be hunt down at leisur by that
brother against whom you dare to rebel but on whom you did not dare
to shut your hand when he lai in it hollow silenc the tongu of thi
captiv rogu for ever and becom a man again with the heart of a man
now said hokosa gentli mani would find it hard to believ that i
rear thi woman from childhood nurs her with my own hand when
she wa sick and give her of the best i had that afterward when
you stole her from me princ i sin deepli to win her back that
i marri her and sin yet more deepli to give her the great she
desir and at last of my own will i loos the bond by which i held
her although i could not thrust her memori from my heart yet i have
earn it all for i made her the tool of my witchcraft and therefor
it is just that she should turn and rend me well if you like it take
her counsel princ and let mine go for i care noth which you take
onli forgiv me if i prophesi onc more and for the last timei am
sure that nodwengo yonder spoke truth when he bade your herald tell
me that he who caus my blood to flow shall sure die and for it be
call to a strict account princ i am a christian now and believ
me whatev you mai do i seek no reveng upon you have been myself
forgiven so much in my turn i have learn to forgiv yet it mai be
ill for that man who caus my blood to flow
let him be strangl said a captain who stood near by and then
there will be no blood in the matter
friend answer hokosa you should have been not a soldier but a
pleader of caus true it is then that the princ will onli caus my
life to fly but whether that is a smaller sin i leav you to judg
keep him prison said anoth till we learn how these matter
end
nai answer hafela for then he will sure outwit us and escap
noma what shall we do with thi man who wa your husband tell us for
you should know best how to deal with him
let me think she answer and she look first at the ground beneath
her next around her then upward toward the ski
now thei stood at the foot of the koppi on the flat top of which grew
the great tree of doom that for gener had serv the peopl of
fire as a place of execut of their crimin or of those who fell
under the ban of the king or of the witchdoctor among and abov the
fingerlik frond of thi strang and dreadfullook tree tower
that white dead limb shape like a cross which owen had point out
to hi discipl john take it to be a sign and a promis thi cross
stood out clear against the sink moon it caught noma ey and a
devilish thought enter into her heart
you would keep thi fellow aliv she said and yet you would
not suffer him to escap see there abov you is a cross such as he
worship bind him to it as he sai the man whom he worship wa bound
and let that dead man help him if he mai
the princ and those about noma shrank back a littl in horror thei
were cruel men render more cruel by their superstiti fear of on
whom thei believ to be uncanni on to whom thei attribut inhuman
power which he wa exercis to their destruct but still thi
doom seem dread to them noma read their mind and went on
passion
you deem me unmerci but you do not know what i have suffer at
thi wizard hand for hi sake and becaus of him i am haunt for
hi own purpos he open the gate of distanc he sent me down among
the dweller in death caus me to interpret their word for him i
did so but the dweller came back out of death with me and from that
hour thei have not left me nor will thei ever leav me for night by
night thei sojourn at my side torment me with terror he ha
told me that through my mouth that spirit whom he drew into my bodi
prophesi that he should be lift up abov the peopl let the
propheci be fulfil let him be lift up for then perchanc the
ghost will depart from me and i shall win peac and sleep also thu
alon can you hold him safe and yet shed no blood
be it so said the princ when we plot togeth of the death of
the king and as your price hokosa you bargain for the girl whom i
had chosen to wife did i not warn you that thi witch of mani spell
who hold both our heart in her littl hand should yet hound you to
death and mock you while you perish by an end of shame what did i
tell you hokosa
now when he heard hi fate hokosa bow hi head and trembl a littl
then he lift it and exclaim in a clear voic
it is true princ but i will add to your word she shall bring
both of us to death for me i am honour inde in that there ha
been allot to me that same end which my master chose to that cross
let my sin be fasten and with them my bodi
now the moon sank but in the dark men were found who dare to climb
the tree take with them strip of raw hide thei reach the top of
it four of them and seat themselv upon the arm of the cross
thei let down a rope the noos of which wa place about the bodi of
hokosa as it tighten upon him he turn hi calm and dread ey
on to the ey of noma and said to her
woman i do not reproach you but i lai thi fate upon you that you
shall watch me die thereaft let god deal with you as he mai choos
now when she heard these word noma shriek aloud for of a sudden she
felt that the power of the will of hokosa from which she had been freed
by him had onc more fallen upon her and that come what might she wa
doom to obei hi last command
littl by littl the soldier drew him up and in the dark thei bound
him fast there upon the lofti cross then thei descend and left him
and would have led noma with them from the tree but thi thei could
not do for alwai she broke from them scream and fled back to it
shadow
then see that she wa bewitch hafela command that thei should
bind a cloth about her mouth and leav her there till her sens
return to her in the sunlightfor none of them dare to stop with
her in the shadow of that tree sinc the odour of it were poison to
man also thei believ the place to be haunt by evil spirit
